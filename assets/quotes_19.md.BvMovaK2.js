A few of the most famous folk arts showcased by Bundeli Utsav are described below. Folk dances * Diwari in Bundelkhand is performed every year during the festival of light Diwali/Deepawali in the end of October or first week of November according to lunar calendar. In this connection the epic story goes that \\"in Gokul\\" when Lord Krishna raised Goverdhan Mountain on his finger to save his associates (milkmen), they danced in joy. The dancers wear multi-coloured apparels and the chief dancer holds the peacock feathers in his hands and the rest stick those feathers in their half pants. The main instruments used in this dance are ‚ÄòDholak‚Äô and ‚ÄòNagaria‚Äô (both being a form of drums). The male dancers with long sticks show the marshal arts when the beats of drums inspire their energy and emotions. This dance is also performed as a ‚Äòthanks giving‚Äô after harvesting. * Ravala dance in Bundelkhand is basically a dance drama. The farm labour community of Bundelkhand performs Ravala during marriages. It is performed with very funny expressions and humorous dialogues. The audiences are entertained by these expressions of dance and the dialogues of drama. * Badhaiya is a ceremonial dance. It is performed on child birth, marriages or any other child social get together to celebrate happiness and joy. The collective moments of dancers show the unique expressions of their faces. With rhythm and movements they greet for the occasion. * Raai ‚Äì Through the centuries Raai has been the folk dance which has touched its peak as a classical dance. Later Raai had degenerated its aesthetical values and lost its classical expressions. Today it remains simply as a folk dance. Raai means a mustard seed. When a mustard seed is thrown into a saucer, the seed starts to swings around. The way mustard seed moves in the saucer, the dancers also swings and when the singers sing the lyrics of the song the dancers follow the beats with foot steps. It is a duet and the competition is between the beats of the drum and foot steps of the dancer. The drummer and the dancer try to win each other and this competition leads towards the bliss. * Horse Dance a ceremonial dance performed by a trained horse with the loud beats of heave drums called Rabbi. With graceful movements, the horse follows beats of the drum with its four steps and the horse rider performs the gymnastics gestures. Typically horse dance follows the ceremonial marriage processions. Folk music * Faag songs and its rhythmic music could be heard in the whole Bundelkhand region during spring season when the crops are ready for harvesting. The spring season of March‚ÄìApril express the vibrant emotions which are hidden in the tender hearts of the youth, invites them to come close to fell each other and to express the mystical attachment between male and female. Finally emotions are transformed into devotion to make devotee divine. * Alha reciting is always organized to entertain the farmers during monsoon. When farmers are free from their agricultural jobs during heavy monsoon and they cannot move anywhere, sitting at one place Alha recital makes their emotions awake through the description of heroic deeds of their historical heroes. * Dadre and Gari is the main folk lore of Bundelkhand. As a ‚ÄòGari‚Äô they show the happiness and joy to express their feeling for the blissful movement when the auspicious marriage is taking place. They evoke the feelings in the heart of bride and groom with love and romance. ‚ÄòDadre‚Äô is sung by a group of ladies to bless the newly wed couple. * Lamtera ‚Äì (Call of God) Lamtera songs are sung by Bundeli pilgrims during devotional festivals of Bundelkhand in the month of January, February and March after rabi crop in winter blossoms. Farmers after seeing their crops flowering, their hearts and minds also bloom like a flower. To show their gratitude to the God, the devotees offer the flowers of their emotions to the lotus feet of the God. They realize that the whole year passed in day-to-day life, and with the feeling of spring season they want to get blessed by going to the pilgrimage places, temples and to take the holy bath in the rivers. * Khyal ‚Äì In ‚ÄòKhyal Gayaki‚Äô, a singer recites mythical stories, heroic deeds, the social events and the deep family relations. In this expression of songs, a very special drum ‚ÄòDhapli‚Äô gives very special beats which harmonize emotions. * Kaharwa ‚Äì In the expression of folk lore Kaharwa, the sentiments of heart culminate into the romantic expression. This song is always sung by a drummer who follows the dancer of Raai, which is why this dance is also known as Raai-Kaharwa.

It is the world's largest outsourced asset manager with over $300 billion USD outsourced assets under management and $15 trillion USD under advisement in total. Headquartered in New York City, the firm operates in more than 130 countries, and is the largest provider of outsourced chief investment officers. Mercer is a subsidiary of global professional services firm Marsh & McLennan. History =Foundation and early years (1937-1959)= William Manson Mercer founded William M. Mercer, Limited in Vancouver, Canada in 1945. It was acquired by Marsh & McLennan and merged into their employee benefits department in 1959. =Post acquisition growth (1959-2002)= Mercer Consulting Group In 1975, Marsh & McLennan converted their benefits operations into a wholly owned subsidiary, William M. Mercer, Inc. In 1992, a holding company was created for Marsh & McLennan's three global consulting businesses, known as Mercer Consulting Group. William M. Mercer, Inc. continued to provide actuarial and employee benefits consulting within the group alongside two sister companies: Mercer Management Consulting and National Economic Research Associates, Inc, which provided corporate strategy consulting and economic consulting, respectively.  Mercer Delta Consulting  In 2000, Mercer Consulting Group acquired Delta Consulting Group for its organizational development and change management expertise. Founded by organizational theorist David A. Nadler in 1980, Delta Consulting Group worked to structure effective executive teams. The firm had an influential client list, including corporations such as 3M, Citicorp, Proctor & Gamble, The New York Times, and Xerox. The new entity was renamed Mercer Delta Consulting, and maintained its specialty in leadership and organizational change. The group grew through further acquisitions of Canadian Johnston Smith International, French Change Management Consultants, Spanish c.r.m. Concord, and American CDR International. They surveyed directors of the Fortune 1000 annually and monitored developments in business governance. In contrast to the traditional organizational structure, where business units within an organization are clearly defined, Mercer Delta was a proponent of strategically aligned business units that were linked to a larger organization with which they could share capabilities when needed, and operate separately from when they were not. =Mercer Human Resource Consulting (2002-2007)= In 2002, William M. Mercer Inc. changed its name to Mercer Human Resource Consulting. In 2004, Marsh & McLennan folded its troubled Putnam Investments defined contribution business into its Mercer line and acquired Houston, TX-based Synhrgy HR Technologies, a human resources technology and outsourcing services company. Also in 2004, Mercer admitted giving the NYSE board a compensation report that contained \\"omissions and inaccuracies\\" that led to a $139.5 million pay package for former NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso. Mercer had been brought in to advise the stock exchange on Grasso's 2003 contract and his request for $139.5 million. The consultancy returned $440,000 in fees it collected from the NYSE and provided key documents in the lawsuit. In 2005, Marsh & McLennan split Mercer Human Resources Consulting from Mercer Consulting Group. The five consultancies which remained in the group were renamed Mercer Specialty Consulting. =Mercer (2007-present)= In 2007, three of the five speciality consulting units - Mercer Delta Consulting, Mercer Oliver Wyman and Mercer Management Consulting - were merged into management consultancy Oliver Wyman. Oliver Wyman, along with the two remaining speciality units (NERA Economic Consulting and Lippincott) became a separate subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan known collectively as Oliver Wyman Group. In September, the Mercer Human Resource Consulting became simply \\"Mercer\\". In December, Mercer acquired H√∂fer Vorsorge-Management, a German actuarial and retirement consulting firm. At the time, the acquisition reportedly gave Mercer the top market position in Germany. In 2008, Mercer's Italian human capital consulting business merged with Tesi, an Italian competitor. The combined business, Mercer Tesi was noted at the time to be the largest HR consultancy in Italy. In 2010, Mercer acquired ORC Worldwide, an expert in international work assignments. Also in 2010, Mercer acquired Brecksville, Ohio-based Innovative Process Administration LLC (IPA), a health benefits and technology provider. In 2011, Mercer acquired Fort Lauderdale, FL-based Mahoney & Associates, a defined contribution plan provider. Also in 2011, Mercer acquired Alicia Smith & Associates, a Washington DC-based Medicaid policy consulting firm. In 2013, Mercer acquired British Columbia-based Hall Consulting Limited (HCL), an HR consultant and salary surveyor focusing on the mining and energy business. Also in 2013, Mercer acquired PricewaterhouseCoopers' pension windup (termination) administration business in Canada, and Global Remuneration Solutions (GRS), a South African compensation and benefits survey data and rewards information provider. In 2014, Mercer acquired Norwell, MA-based Transition Assist, a private health care exchange specializing in coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees. Also in 2014, Mercer acquired Jeitosa Group International, a business and technology consultancy, and a 34% stake in South Africa-based employee benefits specialist Alexander Forbes. Later that year, Mercer acquired Swiss private markets manager and consultant SCM, and Denarius, a Santiago, Chile-based consulting firm focused on compensation and benefits survey and information products. In 2015, Mercer made two acquisitions. It acquired Hopkinton, MA-based Comptryx, a workforce metrics company offering surveying, modeling and analytics services, and also acquired HRBS, a provider of career and talent consulting and information services to clients across Asia, particularly Hong Kong, Singapore and mainland China. In that same year, Mercer sold its US defined contribution administration business to Transamerica. In 2016, Mercer acquired Pillar Administration, Australia from the NSW State Government. Pillar was Australia's fourth largest superannuation administration provider, with more than $100 billion in funds under administration across 1.1 million member accounts. In 2017, Mercer combined its investment and retirement consulting practices into a new Wealth consulting division. In December 2019, Mercer's investment assets under management reached above $300 billion. After Marsh & McLennan's 2018 purchase of London-based Jardine Lloyd Thompson (JLT), operating in employee benefits and other financial services, the JLT business was integrated into Mercer.

His work, consisting largely of single drawings featuring an absurdist view of normal life, was published in many magazines and newspapers, particularly Punch and Private Eye. The pen name under which he worked was inspired by actor Larry Parks.Biography on the official website. Parkes's cartooning style was extremely minimalist. No speech bubbles or captions were used, and he often used a few lines to suggest the outline of some feature, such as an arm or a leg, preferring to concentrate on the main idea of the drawing. Especially in the early part of his career, when cartoonists were expected to produce polished work, he was frequently admonished by his editors to \\"fill in\\" his drawings before they would be published. As styles changed in the 1960s and 1970s, his more fluid, off-the-cuff style became his trademark. He was compared to Bill Tidy, both for his particular way of drawing people, and for the speed at which he could work. In later life, he drew a series of cartoons depicting his usual subjects as if they were sculptures by Rodin on display in a gallery. Instead of \\"Rodin's Thinker\\" or \\"Rodin's Kiss\\" his art- lovers saw sculptures such as \\"Rodin's Babysitter\\" and \\"Rodin's Cleaning Lady\\". He extended this into parodies of other works of art, such as the Supper at Emmaus, his version being \\"the presentation of the bill\\". He also did the cartoon sketches that were used on Carry On film titles, and in the late 1980s provided illustrations for W H Smith's own-label stationery packaging.

As a member of the Brazil women's national football team she participated in two FIFA Women's World Cups and three Olympic Games. Daniela was a box-to-box central midfielder who was renowned for her powerful long range shots. Club career Daniela had already played for four seasons at the women's section of S√£o Paulo club Portuguesa,Portuguesa's female section were sometimes known as Lusa Sant'Anna due to an agreement with a local college of that name. when she was signed by San Diego Spirit of Women's United Soccer Association (WUSA). Having turned 19 the month before her February 2003 transfer, Daniela became WUSA's youngest player. She started 14 of her 17 regular season appearances in 2003 and posted three assists. When WUSA collapsed at the end of that season, Daniela moved to Europe and signed for Kopparbergs/G√∂teborg FC of Sweden's Damallsvenskan. She made three league appearances and scored one goal in a 2004 season beset by injury. For 2005 Daniela moved back to the United States and played four games for Hampton Roads Piranhas in the pro‚Äìam W-League. She finished the 2005 season playing in the Women's Premier Soccer League (WPSL) with Bay State Select, scoring seven goals in 10 appearances. She remained with Bay State for 2006 and was named to the all-league team in both 2005 and 2006, before returning to Brazil with Saad Esporte Clube. At the inaugural 2007 edition of the Copa do Brasil de Futebol Feminino, Daniela was named player of the tournament and was top goalscorer with 14 goals as Saad won the trophy. Sweden's Link√∂pings FC contracted Daniela and her Brazil team mate Cristiane for the 2008 Damallsvenskan season. After signing, Daniela stressed that she had improved as a player since her unhappy experience at G√∂teborg in 2004. She played in all 22 of Link√∂pings' league matches, scoring six goals, as the team finished runners-up behind Ume√• IK. Women's Professional Soccer (WPS), a new professional league formed in the United States, entered Daniela into its inaugural International Draft. She was selected as the Saint Louis Athletica's first pick and joined the team for its 2009 season. In Athletica's fourth game against the Washington Freedom, Daniela scored the club's first two goals of the season in a fractious and controversial 3‚Äì3 draw. During the match, a challenge by Abby Wambach, described as \\"vicious\\" and \\"reckless\\", left Daniela with a broken tibia and torn knee ligaments. Wambach received a yellow card for the tackle but was later given a one-match suspension by the league's disciplinary panel. Saint Louis Athletica's doctor said that the injury would rule Daniela out \\"indefinitely\\". She made a comeback with Hampton Road Piranhas in the 2010 W-League, but featured for 18 minutes of one match. The injury brought about Daniela's early retirement from football. She returned to S√£o Paulo and became the proprietor of a butcher shop. International career Brazil wanted to include Daniela in their squad for the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup but at the age of 15 years she was not eligible to participate. Instead she made her debut in the next game, a friendly defeat to the United States. An inexperienced Brazil lost 6‚Äì0 to the world champions at Mile High Stadium in Denver on 26 September 1999. At 16 Daniela was a member of the Brazil team that participated in the 2000 Sydney Olympics and finished in fourth place. She captained Brazil's under-19 team at the 2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship, scoring three goals as the team reached the semi- final. Ahead of the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup, Daniela was named in Brazil's squad and praised by the coach: \\"She is very good. Everyone is interested in her.\\" At the tournament she performed well and struck a celebrated goal as Brazil upset Olympic champions Norway 4‚Äì1. Sweden defeated Brazil 2‚Äì1 in the quarter-final. Daniela and Brazil collected silver medals at the 2004 and 2008 editions of the Olympic Games. At the 2007 FIFA Women's World Cup in China, Brazil produced a striking 4‚Äì0 semi-final win over the United States but were beaten 2‚Äì0 by Germany in the final.

It is associated with Bungo Province in modern-day ≈åita Prefecture on the island of Ky≈´sh≈´. In the han system, Kitsuki was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B. Hauser. (1987). The Bakufu in Japanese History, p. 150. In other words, the domain was defined in terms of kokudaka, not land area.Elison, George and Bardwell L. Smith (1987). Warlords, Artists, & Commoners: Japan in the Sixteenth Century, p. 18. This was different from the feudalism of the West. History At the start of the Edo period, the territory which became Kitsuki (then spelled Êú®‰ªò) was part of the Nakatsu domain (later called Kokura), the 399,000 koku territory ruled by Hosokawa Tadaoki. The territory's name came from the ' family, the relatives of the ≈åtomo clan, who had once resided there. However, in 1593, ≈åtomo Yoshimune incurred the disfavor of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and had his territory confiscated; the Kitsuki lost their lands at the same time. The land was then passed to Sugiwara Nagafusa, Hayakawa Nagamasa, and finally to Hosokawa Tadaoki in 1599, upon his move from the 120,000 koku fief of Miyazu, in Tango Province. The Kitsuki region, valued at 60,000 koku, was ruled on Tadaoki's behalf by castle wardens (Matsui Yasuyuki, Ariyoshi Tatsuyuki, and others) posted to its central castle. For his distinguished service at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Tadaoki was granted the entire province of Bizen, and moved his seat of government first to Nakatsu Castle, then to Kokura Castle. The Hosokawa remained in Bizen until 1632, when Tadaoki's son Hosokawa Tadatoshi was transferred to the Kumamoto Domain in neighboring Higo Province. The former Hosokawa landholding in Bizen was partitioned; Ogasawara Tadazane, who had ruled the Akashi Domain of Harima Province, was granted 150,000 koku of land in northern Bizen, with the territory's seat of government being placed at Kokura Castle. The secondary castle of Nakatsu became the center of the new Nakatsu Domain, which was granted to Tadazane's nephew Ogasawara Nagatsugu. Simultaneously, Tadazane's younger brother Ogasawara Tadatomo, who had been a hatamoto, was given Kitsuki Castle and the surrounding 40,000 koku worth of territory, making him a daimy≈ç. Tadatomo retained rulership of Kitsuki until 1645, when he was moved to the Yoshida Domain of Mikawa Province. Matsudaira Hidechika, the lord of the Takada Domain in Bungo Province replaced Ogasawara Tadatomo as lord of Kitsuki, being given a slightly reduced domain of 32,000 koku. His descendants ruled Kitsuki until the Meiji Restoration. As flatland was scarce in Kitsuki, land reclamation and industrial arts were encouraged; Hidechika brought around 100 peasants with him from Mikawa; they formed what became commonly known as the Mikawa-shinden farmland.

Kitsuki domain finances deteriorated due to the major famine in the Ky≈çho era; Miura Baien, a scholar then residing in the domain, was commissioned to solve the crisis. Among his reforms was the opening of the domain school, the Gakush≈´kan, in the Tenmei era (1781‚Äì1789). Kitsuki was abolished along with the other Japanese domains in 1871, when it became '.

The daughter of author Capt. Frederick Marryat, she was particularly known for her sensational novels and her involvement with several celebrated spiritual mediums of the late 19th century. Her works include Love‚Äôs Conflict (1865), Her Father's Name (1876), There is No Death (1891) and The Spirit World (1894), The Dead Man's Message (1894) and The Blood of the Vampire (1897). She was a prolific author, writing around 70 books, as well as newspaper and magazine articles, short stories and works for the stage. From 1876 to 1890, she had a performing career, at first writing and performing a comic touring piano sketch entertainment, together with George Grossmith and later performing in dramas, comedies, comic opera with a D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, her own one-woman show, and appearing as a lecturer, dramatic reader and public entertainer. During the 1890s, she ran a school of Journalism and Literary Art. Early life Marryat was born in Brighton, Sussex, in 1833, daughter of author and naval Captain Frederick Marryat and his wife, Catherine (n√©e Shairp). Her parents separated when Marryat was young; her childhood was divided between her parents' residences, where she was privately educated.Pope, Catherine. \\"Florence Marryat: Eminent Victorian\\", Florencemarryat.org, accessed 19 April 2011 Shortly before her 21st birthday, in 1854, she wed Thomas Ross Church, an officer in the Madras staff corps of the British Army in India; they spent the first seven years of their married life travelling extensively in India before she returned to England in 1860 with her children but without her husband, who apparently visited only occasionally. She had eight children with Church, three of them while in India.Neisius, Jean G. \\"Florence Marryat.\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Career Marryat wrote her first novel, Love‚Äôs Conflict (1865), while her young children were suffering from scarlet fever, to distract herself from \\"sad thoughts\\". The novel met with modest success and was followed by Too Good for Him and Woman Against Woman in the same year. Other early works included Woman Against Woman (1866), The Confessions of Gerald Escourt (1867), Nelly Brooke (1868), Veronique (1868) and The Girls of Feversham (1869), mining the British public's taste for sensational fiction: \\"lurid stories of seduction, murder, insanity, extramarital sex, incest, and the exploits of the demi-monde\\".Maunder, Andrew. \\"The Blood of the Vampire (1897)\\", Valancourt Books, accessed 16 June 2018 Marryat continued to write novels for 35 years. In 1872, she wrote a biography of her father, Life and Letters of Captain Marryat. From 1872 to 1876, in addition to writing for newspapers and magazines, she edited the monthly magazine London Society.Stone, David. \\"Florence Marryat\\". The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 27 August 2001, accessed 19 April 2011 By the mid-1870s Marryat was an internationally successful author and was living together with her future husband, Colonel Francis Lean of the Royal Marine Light Infantry. Church eventually sued for divorce in 1878, citing his wife's adultery as the grounds. From 1876 to 1877, she collaborated with George Grossmith, writing and performing a comic touring entertainment called Entre Nous (\\"Between you and me\\"). This piece consisted of a series of piano sketches, alternating with scenes and costumed recitations, including a two-person \\"satirical musical sketch\\", really a short comic opera, by Grossmith called Cups and Saucers. Chapter 5. Marryat and her husband divorced in 1879; later that year, she wed Colonel Lean, but they divorced only a year later, in 1880. At the age of 43, in 1881, Marryat returned to the stage, playing the role of Hephzibah Horton in a drama she wrote based on her novel Her World Against a Lie. The next year, she joined a D'Oyly Carte Opera Company touring company in Gilbert and Sullivan's Patience, playing the role of Lady Jane. In 1884 she played Queen Altemire in a revival of W. S. Gilbert's fairy comedy The Palace of Truth in London with Herbert Beerbohm Tree. In 1886, Marryat wrote a lighthearted book about her travels in the United States called Tom Tiddler's Ground. She later appeared in her own one-woman show, Love Letters, and appeared as a lecturer, dramatic reader and public entertainer. She continued performing until 1890, when she played Cassandra Doolittle in an operetta called The Dear Departed. Last years and death Marryat became active in the Society of Authors, founded in 1884, and also began to breed bulldogs and terriers. Over the last 14 years of her life, she had a relationship with a younger actor, Herbert McPherson, who inherited half of her estate. During the 1890s, she ran a school of Journalism and Literary Art. She continued writing for the rest of her life, and some of her best known books were her late-career writings on spiritualism, and included There Is No Death (1891), The Spirit World (1894) and A Soul on Fire. She influenced wiccan Gerald Gardner in his youth.Judika Illes, The Element Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, HarperElement 2005, p 732 Marryat died in 1899 from diabetes and pneumonia and is buried in Kensal Green Cemetery in London. Works and reaction Marryat published 68 novels before her death, as well as various non-fiction works such as The Life and Letters of Captain Marryat (1872) and Gup (1868), an account of garrison life in India. She also wrote newspaper and magazine articles, short stories and works for the stage. Her works treated such then-controversial themes as marital cruelty, adultery, alcoholism and spiritualism. There is No Death and The Spirit World give accounts of s√©ances she attended. The public found Marryat's work accessible, and reviewers admitted the effectiveness of her \\"graphic, nervous, vital\\" style, but critics called her \\"cynical and 'third-rate', too dependent for her plots on 'the stock in trade of fourth-rate solicitors'\\". Despite critical hostility, her novels remained popular. =Novels= *Love‚Äôs Conflict (1865) *Too Good for Him (1865) *Woman Against Woman (1865) *For Ever and Ever (1866) *The Confessions of Gerald Estcourt (1867) *Nelly Brooke ‚Äì A Homely Story (1868) *The Girls of Feversham (1869) *Veronique (1869) *Petronel (1870) *Her Lord and Master (1871) *The Prey of the Gods (1871) *Mad Dumaresq (1873) *No Intentions (1874) *Fighting the Air (1875) *Open!

Subsequently, the House of Schaumburg were also counts of Holstein and its partitions Holstein-Itzehoe, Holstein-Kiel, Holstein-Pinneberg (until 1640), Holstein-Pl√∂n, Holstein-Segeberg and Holstein-Rendsburg (until 1460) and through the latter at times also the dukes of Schleswig. Count Adolf IV was an active ruler and founded the cities of Stadthagen and Rinteln. From 1500 the County of Schaumburg belonged to the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle of the Holy Roman Empire.

After the childless death in 1640 of Count Otto V, the House of Schaumburg became extinct. The County of Holstein-Pinneberg was merged with the Duchy of Holstein. The County of Schaumburg proper was partitioned among the agnatic Schaumburg heirs into three parts, one incorporated into the ducal Brunswick and Lunenburgian Principality of L√ºneburg, the largest portion becoming the County of Schaumburg-Lippe, and the eastern territory continuing the name County of Schaumburg (), ruled in personal union by Hesse-Cassel. All three are now part of the state of Lower Saxony. When the District of Schaumburg () was formed in middle Lower Saxony in 1977, it chose to use a coat of arms derived from the ancient arms of the Counts of Schaumberg.

Each episode is recorded in a different location around the world, normally with some connection to the topic of discussion. The debate is initially held among a panel of experts, before being opened up to the studio audience. The first series of the programme was aired in 2005, consisting of six hour-long discussions on such topics as outsourcing (recorded in Mumbai) and globalisation (from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland). Presenting duties were shared between CNBC Europe anchors Geoff Cutmore, Ross Westgate and Simon Hobbs. A one-off special on the topic of energy consumption followed from the January 2006 WEF meeting. The format of the programme was altered slightly for the second series in 2006, with the running time of the shows cut to 30 minutes and the topics of conversation confined to aspects of energy such as energy demand, biofuels and sustainability. Cutmore became the permanent presenter of the programme. This format has been retained in the third series, aired in 2007. Since the inception of Questions for the Future, each episode has been preceded by a 'themed week' of short reports related to the subject to be discussed, filmed on location by the presenter.

It was published by Panini Comics and reprinted Marvel Comics from the United States. The title printed Fantastic Four, Iron Man, the Hulk, and before the series ended Avengers comics. This line began in September 1997, after Panini Comics had successfully published Astonishing Spider-Man, Essential X-Men and Wolverine Unleashed (now Wolverine and Deadpool). The series ended in 2000 at #42, due to an \\"overcrowded market\\". The comic was initially priced at ¬£1.99 when it was released, but over the years rose to ¬£2.30. A year later Avengers United took its place on the shelves.  Format  Apart from a special first issue with 92 pages, each issue of Marvel Heroes Reborn hosted two US issues upon its release, with Fantastic Four and Iron Man material being reprinted. From #17 onwards, the comic's logo changed and the format also reduced to 76 pages like all the Collector Editions that exist today. The third slot was taken by the Hulk, up until #39, where the Avengers took that slot. The cover was made out of thick card, unlike the US that has a far thinner paper based cover. The comic contained a letter page which was named \\"'Nuff Said.\\" Marvel Heroes Reborn was published every 28 days throughout its run.  Content  Marvel Heroes Reborn printed the whole of the Heroes Reborn series for Iron Man and the Fantastic Four.

With a focus primarily on selling through Craft Fairs and Trade Fairs in Britain, the magazine developed alongside the UK craft industry and became an important resource for people wanting to earn a living from their work. The publishers, Angie and Paul Boyer, Directors of PSB Design & Print Consultants Limited, first realised there was a need for such a publication when they were selling their own work at UK Craft Fairs in the early 1980s; there was nothing available at that time to inform people about the craft fairs, who organised them, where and when they were taking place or how to book stands at events. As the UK Craft industry expanded and developed over the years, the publishers realised that the profile of the magazine needed to change as well, so in the summer of 2007 they relaunched the publication as Craftsman craft&design; Magazine with a new format, new design and a more contemporary approach to the content. The aims remain the same, to help craftspeople in Britain to earn a living from their work. Development and History Craftsman Magazine Issue 1 The first issue of Craftsman Magazine was published Winter 1983 by Paul and Angie Boyer, Directors of PSB Design and Print Consultants Limited, a small graphic design business based in Commercial Street, London E1. The first issue was 16 pages, printed in 2 colours onto newsprint and 30,000 copies were circulated free of charge at craft fairs all over Britain. The editorial in the first issue featured Bookbinding, Batik, Jewellery, Leather Carving and Craft Fairs. The aim of the magazine was to put craft people in touch with each other, to inform craft makers and buyers about where and when craft fairs were being held, and to provide information about who organised craft fairs in Britain and how to book a stand at the fairs. Advertising was mainly from craft fair organisers. Husband and wife team, Paul and Angie Boyer continued to publish Craftsman Magazine 4 times a year from their London address until 1985 when, with issue number 5, they moved to Littlehampton in Sussex. By that time an annual subscription had been made available, editorial content had been expanded to include Business Advice for craft people and advertising had grown to reflect the growth in the number of craft fairs being held all over Britain. Events being advertised were at venues such as Stately Homes, Town and Village Halls, Wildlife Parks, Schools and Colleges, Hotels, Racecourses, Concert Halls, Community Centres, National Trust Properties, Leisure Centres, Sports Halls, Exhibition Centres, Shopping Centres, Airports and even US military Bases in the UK. Specialist Miniatures shows were also being advertised. The first glossy 2 colour cover appeared on Issue number 10 of Craftsman Magazine in Spring 1986, with the number of pages increased to 36 and a cover price of 20p. The first glossy four colour cover on Issue number 13, Winter 1986, had a cover price of 40p and coincided with WH Smith agreeing to stock the magazine. The first issue to be seen on their shelves throughout Britain was Number 22, June/July 1988, by which time the magazine had increased frequency to six issues a year and was printed on glossy paper throughout. Craftsman Magazine Issue 13 Issue number 50 February/March 1993 marked ten years since the launch of Craftsman Magazine, which was now being produced by Angie and Paul Boyer from their address in East Yorkshire, having moved to the north of England from Sussex in 1987. This anniversary issue had a cover price of ¬£1.70, 84 pages and colour throughout. A celebratory competition was published which gave readers the opportunity to win a hand crafted gold and diamond pendant brooch, which had been specially designed and made for the occasion by jeweller, Pam Crosland. Craftsman Magazine changed from bi-monthly to monthly publication, producing 12 issues a year in April 1998 with Issue Number 81. It was full colour throughout, with a cover price of ¬£2.50. Issue 115 February 2001 of Craftsman Magazine incorporated ‚ÄòFibreAction‚Äô, a 12-page small, independent quarterly publication for textile artists and enthusiasts. Previously published and distributed by spinner and weaver, Veronica Burningham, she continued as Editor of FibreAction in Craftsman Magazine until August 2002, when the Editor changed to weaver Chris Hammacot. The last issue of Craftsman magazine to include FibreAction was August 2003. Issue 134 September 2002 of Craftsman Magazine incorporated The Rocking Horse Magazine, the official magazine for the Guild of Rocking Horse Makers, previously an independent magazine published by rocking horse maker, Anthony Dew. Consisting of 12 pages in full colour, it was included within Craftsman Magazine annually until September 2005. In 2002 and 2003, informative Directories were included within the pages of Craftsman Magazine; subjects included Craft Fair Organisers, Craft Supplies, Courses and Workshops, Craft Galleries, Guilds & Associations. For almost 25 years Craftsman Magazine aimed to help and encourage craftspeople in Britain to earn a living from their creative skills. Known for its promotion of craft makers and their work, as well as the support given to trade and consumer craft fairs, in 2007 Craftsman Magazine changed significantly to expand its readership and coverage with the aim of including more about contemporary craft in Britain. Issue 191 June 2007, with a cover price of ¬£2.50 and 52 pages was the last to be published as Craftsman Magazine. With a new title and a new format, it was relaunched by Angie and Paul Boyer, Directors of PSB Design and Print Consultants Limited, as Craftsman craft&design; Magazine. The first issue under the new title and format was July/August 2007, Issue 192. (The issue numbering continued from one format to the next). Shows and Events =CraftAid= In 1986, Craftsman Magazine organised CraftAid, a national craft auction in aid of Save the Children. Craft people all over Britain donated work, the Craftsman offices in Littlehampton were turned into storage space for all the donated pieces, which ranged from pots by well-known ceramicists Lucie Rie, Michael Cardew and Janet Leach, through to precious metal jewellery, designer clothes, toys and teddy bears - all manner of work from both professional and hobby crafts people. Clandon Park, a National Trust Property in the South East of England, was hired as the venue for the auction, which took place over a weekend just before Christmas. People working in the craft industry donated their time to help with the auction - craft fair organisers, craft makers, friends and family. This unique event not only raised a substantial amount of money for charity, it also brought the British Craft industry together in a way that had never happened before. =National Fleece to Jumper Spinning Competition= In the same year, 1986, Craftsman Magazine organised the first National Fleece to Jumper Spinning Competition, which ran for 10 years at various craft fair venues in England, drawing supporters and participants from all over the world, including New Zealand, where the competition originated. Up to six teams, each made up of six people took part. The challenge was to knit a child's size jumper from a raw, unwashed fleece using a previously unseen pattern in the shortest possible time within a four-hour time limit. Teams started by sorting the fleece, selecting the best fibres, which were then carded, spun, plied and knitted. The final Fleece to Jumper Spinning Competition was held in 1995 at East Riddlesden Hall, Keighley, West Yorkshire, a National Trust property. It was won by the Craven Guild, who retained the title and the trophy as it was their third consecutive win. It was also the 10th year of the competition and the centenary year of the National Trust, a timely conclusion to a popular competition. The Craftsman Magazine Fleece to Jumper Speed Record was developed from the main competition and gave individual teams the opportunity to work against the clock to a set pattern, without competing with any other teams at the same time. In 1989 the Cambridge Carders set the first record at 3 hours, 7 minutes, 5 seconds. The record was subsequently broken a number of times, but the Cambridge Carders finally reclaimed it at the Alexandra Palace Christmas Craft Fair, setting a time of 2 hours, 46 minutes, 12 seconds. =Craftmakers Materials Show= In October 1999, Craftsman Magazine organised their first Craftmakers Materials Show in London. Exhibitors were companies which supplied materials, equipment and services to craftspeople and hobbyists, plus craft guilds and associations, artists, designers and craft book publishers. Visitors could purchase art and craft supplies, watch demonstrations of art and craft techniques, take part in workshops and business advice sessions. Held annually until 2002, also in Harrogate from 2001 - 2002. Craftsman Magazine Awards =British Craft Trade Fair Newcomer Award= In 1996, Craftsman Magazine sponsored the Newcomer Award at the British Craft Trade Fair in Harrogate, North Yorkshire, for the first time. The winner was Christine Cummings from Ormskirk in Lancashire with her Ceramic Swine sculptures. (Sponsorship of this competition continues under the magazine's new title of Craftsman craft&design; Magazine). Ros Ingram, winner of the Craftsman Magazine Student Award at Art in Clay 1998 =Student Award at Art in Clay= In 1999, Craftsman Magazine sponsored the Student Award at Art in Clay (a ceramics show held at Hatfield, Hertfordshire) for the first time. It was presented in recognition of the quality of design and making of the work exhibited, the student/graduate's potential to earn a living from their work. The aim of the award was to help a young graduate to start up and run a successful business working as a potter or ceramic artist. In 1999, the award was presented to Mirka Golden-Hann for her hand thrown salt glazed pottery. Sponsored until 2007, the final Craftsman Magazine Student Award went to Kerry Williamson. Each year's winner had their work featured as a front cover article in Craftsman Magazine and were also presented with a commemorative plate specially made by Laurence McGowan. =Craftsman Award at Potfest= In 2002, Craftsman Magazine sponsored the potters‚Äô competition at Potfest in the Pens (a ceramics show held in Penrith, Cumbria) for the first time. The concept of the competition was for exhibitors at Potfest in the Pens to make a piece to reflect a specific theme; the challenge was to use techniques different from those they usually employed in their work. With a theme of ‚ÄòDish of the Day‚Äô in 2002, the winner was Dennis Kilgallon of Red Dust Ceramics, whose work was subsequently the subject of a front cover feature 138 January 2003. (Sponsorship of this competition continues under the magazine's new title of Craftsman craft&design; Magazine).

In the USSR, the study of history was marked by restrictions imposed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). Soviet historiography is itself the subject of modern studies. Theoretical approaches George M. Enteen identifies two approaches to the study of Soviet historiography. A totalitarian approach associated with the Western analysis of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian society, controlled by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, this school \\"thought that signs of dissent merely represented a misreading of commands from above.\\"363 For Enteen the other school of writing on Soviet historiography is the social-history school which draws attention to \\"important initiative from historians at odds with the dominant powers in the field.\\"363 Enteen is unable to decide between these different approaches based on current literature. In Markwick's view there are a number of important post war historiographical movements, which have antecedents in the 1920s and 1930s. Surprisingly these include culturally and psychologically focused history. In the late 1920s Stalinists began limiting individualist approaches to history, culminating in the publication of Stalin and other's \\"Short Course\\" History of the Soviet Communist Party (1938). This crystallised the piatichlenka or five acceptable moments of history in terms of vulgar dialectical materialism: primitive- communism, slavery, feudalism, capitalism and socialism.284 Following publication of the \\"Short course\\", on 14 November 1938 the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued a special statement that the course and its chapter \\"About dialectic and historical materialism\\" were declared as \\"encyclopedia of philosophical knowledge in a field of Marxism- Leninism\\", in which were given \\"official and verified by the Central Committee interpretation of basic issues of history of the All-Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and Marxism-Leninism and without allowing any other arbitrary interpretations\\". While the triumph of Stalinist history was being imposed, different modes of history began to emerge. These included BA Romanov's People and Morals in Ancient Rus' (1947), a study of mentalit√©s at the height of the Zhdanovshchina. However, it was not until the 20th Congress of the CPSU that different schools of history emerged from the Stalinist freeze. Firstly, a \\"new direction\\" within Leninist materialism emerged, as an effectively loyal opposition to Stalinist dialectical materialism, secondly a social psychology of history emerged through a reading of Leninist psychology, thirdly a \\"culturological\\" tendendency emerged.284‚Äì285 Characteristics of Soviet historiography Soviet-era historiography was deeply influenced by Marxism. Marxism maintains that the moving forces of history are determined by material production and the rise of different socioeconomic formations. Applying this perspective to socioeconomic formations such as slavery and feudalism is a major methodological principle of Marxist historiography. Based on this principle, historiography predicts that there will be an abolition of capitalism by a socialist revolution made by the working-class. Soviet historians believed that Marxist‚ÄìLeninist theory permitted the application of categories of dialectical and historical materialism in the study of historical events. Marx and Engels' ideas of the importance of class struggle in history, the destiny of the working class, and the role of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the revolutionary party are of major importance in Marxist methodology. Marxist‚ÄìLeninist historiography has several aspects. It explains the social basis of historical knowledge, determines the social functions of historical knowledge and the means by which these functions are carried out, and emphasizes the need to study concepts in connection with the social and political life of the period in which these concepts were developed. It studies the theoretical and methodological features in every school of historical thought. Marxist‚ÄìLeninist historiography analyzes the source-study basis of a historical work, the nature of the use of sources, and specific research methods. It analyzes problems of historical research as the most important sign of the progress and historical knowledge and as the expression of the socioeconomic and political needs of a historical period. Soviet historiography has been severely criticized by scholars, chiefly‚Äîbut not only‚Äîoutside the Soviet Union and Russia. Its status as \\"scholarly\\" at all has been questioned, and it has often been dismissed as ideology and pseudoscience. Robert Conquest concluded that \\"All in all, unprecedented terror must seem necessary to ideologically motivated attempts to transform society massively and speedily, against its natural possibilities. The accompanying falsifications took place, and on a barely credible scale, in every sphere. Real facts, real statistics, disappeared into the realm of fantasy. History, including the history of the Communist Party, or rather especially the history of the Communist Party, was rewritten. Unpersons disappeared from the official record. A new past, as well as new present, was imposed on the captive minds of the Soviet population, as was, of course, admitted when truth emerged in the late 1980s.\\" That criticism stems from the fact that in the Soviet Union, science was far from independent. Since the late 1930s, Soviet historiography treated the party line and reality as one and the same. As such, if it was a science, it was a science in service of a specific political and ideological agenda, commonly employing historical revisionism. In the 1930s, historical archives were closed and original research was severely restricted. Historians were required to pepper their works with references‚Äîappropriate or not‚Äîto Stalin and other \\"Marxist‚ÄìLeninist classics\\", and to pass judgment‚Äîas prescribed by the Party‚Äîon pre-revolution historic Russian figures. Nikita Khrushchev commented that \\"Historians are dangerous and capable of turning everything upside down. They have to be watched.\\" The state-approved history was openly subjected to politics and propaganda, similar to philosophy, art, and many fields of scientific research. The Party could not be proven wrong, it was infallible and reality was to conform to this line. Any non-conformist history had to be erased, and questioning of the official history was illegal. Many works of Western historians were forbidden or censored, and many areas of history were also forbidden for research because, officially, they had never happened. For this reason, Soviet historiography remained mostly outside the international historiography of the period. Translations of foreign historiography were produced (if at all) in a truncated form, accompanied by extensive censorship and \\"corrective\\" footnotes. For example, in the Russian 1976 translation of Basil Liddell Hart's History of the Second World War pre-war purges of Red Army officers, the secret protocol to the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, many details of the Winter War, the occupation of the Baltic states, the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina, Allied assistance to the Soviet Union during the war, many other Western Allies' efforts, the Soviet leadership's mistakes and failures, criticism of the Soviet Union and other content were censored out. The official version of Soviet history was dramatically changed after every major governmental shake-up. Previous leaders were denounced as \\"enemies\\", whereas current leaders usually became the subject of a personality cult. Textbooks were rewritten periodically, with figures‚Äîsuch as Leon Trotsky or Joseph Stalin‚Äîdisappearing from their pages or being turned from great figures to great villains. Certain regions and periods of history were made unreliable for political reasons. Entire historical events could be erased, if they did not fit the party line. For example, until 1989 the Soviet leadership and historians, unlike their Western colleagues, had denied the existence of a secret protocol to the Soviet-German Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 1939, and as a result the Soviet approach to the study of the Soviet-German relations before 1941 and the origins of World War II were remarkably flawed. In another example, the Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939 as well as the Polish-Soviet War of 1919‚Äì1920 were censored out or minimized in most publications, and research was suppressed, in order to enforce the policy of 'Polish-Soviet friendship'. Similarly, the enforced collectivisation, the wholesale deportations or massacres of small nationalities in the Caucasus or the disappearance of the Crimean Tatars were not recognized as facts worthy of mention. Soviet historians also engaged in producing false claims and falsification of history; for example Soviet historiography falsely claimed that the Katyn massacre was carried out by Germans rather than by Soviets. Yet another example is related to the case of Soviet reprisals against former Soviet POWs returning from Germany; some of them were treated as traitors and imprisoned in Gulags for many years, yet that policy was denied or minimized by Soviet historians for decades and modern Western scholars have noted that \\"In the past, Soviet historians engaged for the most part in a disinformation campaign about the extent of the prisoner-of-war problem.\\" Marxist influence The Soviet interpretation of Marxism predetermined much of the research done by historians. Research by scholars in the USSR was limited to a large extent due to this predetermination. Some Soviet historians could not offer non-Marxist theoretical explanations for their interpretation of sources. This was true even when alternate theories had a greater explanatory power in relation to a historian's reading of source material. The Marxist theory of historical materialism identified means of production as chief determinants of the historical process. They led to the creation of social classes, and class struggle was the motor of history. The sociocultural evolution of societies was considered to progress inevitably from slavery, through feudalism and capitalism to socialism and finally communism. In addition, Leninism argued that a vanguard party was required to lead the working class in the revolution that would overthrow capitalism and replace it with socialism. Soviet historiography interpreted this theory to mean that the creation of the Soviet Union was the most important turning event in human history, since the USSR was considered to be the first socialist society. Furthermore, the Communist Party‚Äîconsidered to be the vanguard of the working class ‚Äì was given the role of permanent leading force in society, rather than a temporary revolutionary organization. As such, it became the protagonist of history, which could not be wrong. Hence the unlimited powers of the Communist Party leaders were claimed to be as infallible and inevitable as the history itself. It also followed that a worldwide victory of communist countries is inevitable. All research had to be based on those assumptions and could not diverge in its findings. In 1956, Soviet academician Anna Pankratova said that \\"the problems of Soviet historiography are the problems of our Communist ideology.\\" Soviet historians have also been criticized for a Marxist bias in the interpretation of other historical events, unrelated to the Soviet Union. Thus, for example, they assigned to the rebellions in the Roman Empire the characteristics of the social revolution. Often, the Marxist bias and propaganda demands came into conflict: hence the peasant rebellions against the early Soviet rule, such as the Tambov Rebellion of 1920‚Äì21, were simply ignored as inconvenient politically and contradicting the official interpretation of the Marxist theories. Soviet views of history Soviet and earlier Slavophile historians emphasized the Slavic roots in the foundation of the Russian state in contrast to the Normanist theory of the Vikings conquering the Slavs and founding the Kievan Rus'. They accused Normanist theory proponents of distorting history by depicting the Slavs as undeveloped primitives. In contrast, Soviet historians stated that the Slavs laid the foundations of their statehood long before the Norman/Viking raids, while the Norman/Viking invasions only served to hinder the historical development of the Slavs. They argued that Rus' composition was Slavic and that Rurik and Oleg' success was rooted in their support from within the local Slavic aristocracy. After the dissolution of the USSR, Novgorod acknowledged its Viking history by incorporating a Viking ship into its logo.Hall, p. 221 Soviet historians trace the origin of feudalism in Russia to the 11th century, after the founding of the Russian state. The class struggle in medieval is emphasized because of the hardships of feudal relations. For example, Soviet historians argue that uprisings in Kiev in 1068‚Äì69 was a reflection of the class struggle. There was a constant struggle between the powers of the princes and those of the feudal aristocracy, known as the boyars. In regions like Novgorod, the boyar aristocracy was able to limit the prince's power by making the office and the head of church elective. The Mongol conquests of the 13th century had significant consequences for Russia. Soviet historians emphasize the cruelty of Genghis Khan and the suffering and devastation that Russia endured. Soviet historians attribute the success of Genghis Khan to the fact that feudalism among his people had not developed, which would have involved with feudal and political strife. By contrast, the peoples opposed to the Mongols were in a mature state of feudalism and the political disunity that went with it. Soviet historians conclude that the Mongol domination had disastrous consequences for Russia's historical progress and development. It is also argued that by bearing the full weight of the Mongolian invasions, Russia helped to save Western Europe from outside domination. The struggle against foreign domination and the heroism of its participants is a recurring theme in Soviet historiography. Soviet historians have an upbeat assessment of Alexander Nevsky, characterized as one of the greatest military leaders of his time for defeating the German knights' invasions of Russia in the 13th century. Much importance is attached to the Battle of Kulikovo (1380), which marked the beginning of the end of the Mongol domination of Russia. Dmitry Donskoi for his leadership of the anti- Mongol struggle is credited for being an outstanding military commander and contributing significantly to the unity of the Russian lands. Reliability of statistical data Various Sovietologists have raised the issue of the quality (accuracy and reliability) of data published in the Soviet Union and used in historical research. The Marxist theoreticians of the Party regarded statistics as a social science; hence many applications of statistical mathematics were curtailed, particularly during the Stalin era. Under central planning, nothing could occur by accident. The law of large numbers or the idea of random deviation were decried as \\"false theories\\". Statistical journals were closed; world-renowned statisticians like Andrey Kolmogorov or Eugen Slutsky abandoned statistical research. As with all Soviet historiography, the reliability of Soviet statistical data varied from period to period. The first revolutionary decade and the period of Stalin's dictatorship both appear highly problematic with regard to statistical reliability; very few statistical data were published from 1936 to 1956. Notably, the 1937 census' organizers were executed and results destroyed altogether, and no further censuses were conducted until 1959.A. G. Volkov Census of 1937 Facts and Fictions originally published in –ü–µ—Ä–µ–ø–∏—Å—å –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –°–°–°–† 1937 –≥–æ–¥–∞. –ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –∏ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã/–≠–∫—Å–ø—Ä–µ—Å—Å-–∏–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏—è. –°–µ—Ä–∏—è \\"–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è —Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏\\". –í—ã–ø—É—Å–∫ 3‚Äì5 (—á–∞—Å—Ç—å II). –ú., 1990/ —Å. 6‚Äì63 The reliability of data improved after 1956 when some missing data was published and Soviet experts themselves published some adjusted data for the Stalin era; however the quality of documentation has deteriorated. Some researchers say that on occasion the Soviet authorities may have completely \\"invented\\" statistical data potentially useful in historical research (such as economic data invented to prove the successes of the Soviet industrialization, or some published numbers of Gulag prisoners and terror victims‚Äîas Conquest claims). Data was falsified both during collection‚Äîby local authorities who would be judged by the central authorities based on whether their figures reflected the central economy prescriptions‚Äîand by internal propaganda, with its goal of portraying the Soviet state in the most positive light to its own citizens. Nonetheless the policy of not publishing‚Äîor simply not collecting‚Äîdata that was deemed unsuitable for various reasons was much more common than simple falsification; hence the many gaps in Soviet statistical data. Inadequate or missing documentation for much of Soviet statistical data is also a significant problem. Credibility Not all areas of Soviet historiography were equally affected by the ideological demands of the government; additionally, the intensity of these demands varied over time. The impact of ideological demands also varied based on the field of history. The areas most affected by ideological demands were 19th and 20th century history, especially Russian and Soviet history. Part of the Soviet historiography was affected by extreme ideological bias, and potentially compromised by the deliberate distortions and omissions. Yet part of Soviet historiography produced a large body of significant scholarship which continues to be used in the modern research. Life experiences of individual Soviet historians Mikhail Pokrovsky (1862‚Äì1932) was held in the highest regard as a historian in the Soviet Union and was elected to the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1929. He emphasized Marxist theory, downplaying the role of personality in favour of economics as the driving force of history. However, posthumously, Pokrovsky was accused of \\"vulgar sociologism\\", and his books were banned. After Stalin's death, and the subsequent renouncement of his policies during the Khrushchev Thaw, Pokrovsky's work regained some influence. When Burdzhalov, then the deputy editor of the foremost Soviet journal on history, in spring of 1956 published a bold article examining the r√¥le of Bolsheviks in 1917 and demonstrated that Stalin had been an ally of Kamenev‚Äîwho had been executed as a traitor in 1936‚Äîand that Lenin had been a close associate of Zinoviev‚Äîwho had been executed as a traitor in 1936‚ÄîBurdzhalov was moved to an uninfluential post. Underground historiography The Brezhnev Era was the time of samizdat (circulating unofficial manuscripts within the USSR) and tamizdat (illegal publication of work abroad). The three most prominent Soviet dissidents of that era were Alexandr Solzhenitsyn, Andrei Sakharov and Roy Medvedev. Of the tamizdat authors, Solzhenitsyn was the most famous, publishing The Gulag Archipelago in the West in 1973. Medvedev's Let History Judge: The Origins and Consequences of Stalinism was published in 1971 in the West. Neither could publish in the Soviet Union until the advent of Perestroika and Glasnost. Influence of Soviet historiography in modern Russia The 2006 Russian book, A Modern History of Russia: 1945‚Äì2006: A Manual for History TeachersNew Manuals Push A Putin's-Eye View In Russian Schools has received significant attention as it was publicly endorsed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin said that \\"we can't allow anyone to impose a sense of guilt on us,\\" and that the new manual helps present a more balanced view of Russian history than that promoted by the West. The book says that repressions, carried out by Stalin and others, were \\"a necessary evil in response to a cold war started by America against the Soviet Union.\\" It cites a recent opinion poll in Russia that gave Stalin an approval rating of 47%, and states that \\"The Soviet Union was not a democracy, but it was an example for millions of people around the world of the best and fairest society.\\" The Economist contends that the book is inspired by Soviet historiography in its treatment of the Cold War, as it claims that the Cold War was started by the United States, that the Soviet Union was acting in self-defense, and that the USSR did not lose the Cold War but rather voluntarily ended it. According to The Economist, \\"rabid anti- Westernism is the leitmotif of [the book's] ideology.\\" However, this single book is only one out of many approved by the Ministry of Education and Science, many promoting opposite views. In 2009, president Dmitri Medvedev created the Historical Truth Commission, against the perceived anti-Soviet and anti-Russian slander. Officially, the Commission's mission is to \\"defend Russia against falsifiers of history and those who would deny Soviet contribution to the victory in World War II\\". Also, United Russia has proposed a draft law, that would mandate jail terms of three to five years \\"for anyone in the former Soviet Union convicted of rehabilitating Nazism\\".

The ensemble was assembled by advertising agency McCann Erickson for the purposes of singing in a television commercial. McCann Erickson had written the jingle I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony) for Coca-Cola, and had sought to have The New Seekers sing it, but The New Seekers could not fit the project into their schedule and turned it down. McCann Erickson then got in touch with producer Al Ham, who then put together a group of singers for the project (including his wife, Mary Mayo, and their daughter Lorri). The commercial began airing in July 1971 and was extremely popular, convincing Ham to rewrite the song as \\"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing\\" and to record an album and a Christmas record; the single hit No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and No. 5 on the Adult Contemporary chart, which convinced The New Seekers to issue it as a single as well. The Hillside Singers version of the song sold a million copies, earning a gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. The Hillside Singers also sang the vocal version of Move Closer to Your World, a theme created for television news by Ham, and is most well known for its long-time use by WPVI-TV in Philadelphia. In 1972, they also had a minor hit with \\"We're Together\\", which peaked at No. 100 on The Billboard Hot 100 in February 1972. Ham went on to create a syndicated radio music format called Music of Your Life, but he died in 2001. Lorri Ham (now known as Lorri Hafer) continues to work as a professional singer and is also an on-air personality on the Music of Your Life network.

Mukul is producing a film adaptation of the celebrated Man Booker prize- winning novel The White Tiger with Netflix. Adapted from Arvind Adiga‚Äôs bestselling novel by the same name, The White Tiger is written and directed by Ramin Bahrani (Fahrenheit 451 and 99 Homes) and stars debutante Adarsh Gourav, award-winning actor Rajkummar Rao (Stree, Bareily Ki Barfi, Newton), and global icon Priyanka Chopra Jonas (Isn‚Äôt it Romantic, A Kid Like Jake, The Sky Is Pink) in pivotal roles. The White Tiger follows the extraordinary journey of a self-made man from tea-shop worker in a village to successful entrepreneur in a big city. Murder, love and deceit become the ultimate price for ambition. Mukul released his debut album Stray with SONY BMG in 2006. Stray was written, composed and produced by Mukul. Howie B, who has previously produced U2 and Bj√∂rk came on as Executive Producer. Stray reached number 12 in the Indian charts, and was a critical success, with the UK's Guardian newspaper calling it \\"an uneasy, surreal new vision of India.\\" Pennyblackmusic said \\"It's a hallucinatory experience; burgeoning with tension and personal angst, existential bafflement and the estrangement that can only truly occur when utterly surrounded by a metropolis of millions. Think of 'Naked Lunch' set in Bombay, remixed by William Gibson and starring a subcontinental Serge Gainsbourg with a penchant for better living through chemistry ... that's about as close as you're going to get. It's fascinating.\\" Whisperin and hollerin's Huw Jones says - \\"Constantly expanding on themes and getting ever complex, Mukul‚Äôs kaleidoscope of audio delights showcase his heritage, Djing background and innovative thinking. Whilst never outright dark, there‚Äôs a potentially deviant side to his music that slowly hangs in the balance and becomes claustrophobic, but at no point does it become too oppressive, not just yet anyway, it‚Äôs a fine balance, but one that Mukul can strike with ease.\\" Prior to Stray, Mukul founded Transmit Audio Lab, an ambient noise / found sound collective. Transmit Audio had several ground-breaking performances In India, where they pioneered the creation of lengthy soundscapes using sounds recorded from Mumbai's aural fabric, layered with industrial and electronic rhythm patterns. Mukul's debut ambient gig in 2001 is seen by some as India's first. Mukul has performed at the Tate Modern, London, the National Centre for the Performing Arts (India) and the World Social Forum, Mumbai. In 2005, Mukul sold Mipak Polymers Limited, a packaging solutions company that he had started in 1999. Mipak had over 300 employees and 4 factories across India. In 2008, Mukul directed The Body Electric, with Shezaad Dawood. The Body Electric was used to launch the prestigious UK Cultural Olympics, and was projected on Norwich Castle for 2 days. The duo performed under the name Dawood/Deora. Dawood/Deora also performed at the Serpentine Gallery, London, as part of the Indian Highway show, and released Expressway- a compilation of abstract electronica from India. Expressway was released on Dudup, Mukuls record label. In 2009, Mukul had a solo art show titled BREAK in Mumbai. BREAK was a participative experiment. On entering the gallery, the audience was instructed to take a shuttle bus to an undisclosed location. They arrived at a derelict mill compound where they were asked to sign a disclaimer stating that they accepted full responsibility for any injury that might occur. They were then led to the scene which consisted of a car and sledgehammers. A situation was thus created, where the audience joined the experiment by smashing the car. It became an energetic, passionate, struggle, in which extremes of emotion were given free expression against that quintessential symbol of modernity, the automobile. By 2012, BREAK had achieved near-mythological status, and Diesel + Art had an exhibition with images and videos from the 2009 event. GQ voted Mukul Best Dressed Indian in 2011 and 2012. Mukul performed at TED India, where he collaborated with Kalaripayattu dancers to create a piece called The Wandering Arrow- a juxtaposition of an ancient Indian martial form with modern abstract electronic music. In 2011 and 2012, Mukul had a month-long radio show on Bob Dylan. He also performed at a tribute gig for Dylans birthday in May at Blue Frog, Mumbai.

Cobb Seamount is one of the seamounts in the Cobb‚ÄìEickelberg Seamount chain, a chain of underwater volcanoes created by the Cobb hotspot that terminates near the coast of Alaska. It lies just west of the Cascadia subduction zone, and was discovered in August 1950 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service fisheries research vessel R/V John N. Cobb (FWS 1601).noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner: John N. Cobb, Establishing a Rich Legacy nRetrieved August 25, 2018 By 1967, over of soundings and dozens of samples from the seamount had been collected. Cobb Seamount is geologically interesting for its terraced, pinnacle structure, and its biological community. Like many other seamounts, Cobb Seamount acts as a biological center of diversity, and supports a dense oceanic ecosystem. Relatively convenient access and an interesting biological setting have made the seamount an object of several scientific cruises and dives.  Geology  Cobb Seamount lies off the coast of Washington, in the -deep Cascadia Basin. Argon‚Äìargon dating of basalts retrieved from the volcano show that it is about 3.3 million years in age. Cobb Seamount's slopes average 12¬∞ in grade, and are indented by four prominent terraces at various depths; this morphology is partly the result of sub-aerial exposure and wave erosion at sea level and partly due to volcanic processes far below wave base.Chaytor, J. D., R. A. Keller, R. A. Duncan, and R. P. Dziak (2007), Seamount morphology in the Bowie and Cobb hot spot trails, Gulf of Alaska, Geochem. Geophys. Geosyst., 8, Q09016, doi:10.1029/2007GC001712 The volcano's pinnacle is generally flat, and is defined by a pocketed area approximately by in size.  Biology  Red encrusting demosponge of the type found on Cobb Seamount. Although it is one of over 100 underwater features in the region, Cobb Seamount is the only one known to extend well upwards into the region of the ocean penetrated by light. Like many other seamounts, Cobb Seamount is a local biological hotspot and functions as an \\"island of stability\\" for local organisms. It supports an extensive fish population, mostly Sebastes species and especially Sebastes miniatus. Bird life has been noted in the area of its summit, indicating that it is a prime fishing ground. For the complete known species inventory of Cobb Seamount, see Du Preez et al., 2015. The summit of the volcano is dominated by a carpet of Hinnites multirugosus, which forms the base of a dense ecosystem of sponges and other small, sessile organisms. The species is otherwise scarce in its distribution in the Pacific; its abundance is accommodated by the scarcity of its chief predator, the sea star Orthasterias koehleri. The reason for the sea star's disparity is unknown, as it is extremely common on nearby seamounts. The steeper flanks of the volcanoes are carpeted by coralline algae of the Lithothamnion and Lithophyllum genera. In some areas, Borgiola pustulosa is more common. Red-colored colonies of demosponge and related species predominant the ecosystem, which includes sea urchins, sponges, algae, anemones, and gastropods. While overall the species diversity on the seamount is lower than a comparable area on the surface, the species present have grown in greater numbers and have formed larger colonies, to the point that there was little to no bare rock surface on the seamount, and none has been found in expeditionary dives. Some endemism to the seamount has also been noted. The seamount's abundant sea life has made it a target for heavy fishing since the 1960s. However, the fishing is very difficult to monitor, since Cobb lies outside of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone and therefore fishing vessels are not regulated. It is known that it has been the site of trawling, gill net, and long-line fishing for some time, mostly by the Japanese and Oregonian fleets. In 1993, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sponsored a study on the seamount, which concluded that concerns about overfishing at the seamount have some merit. The study also notes that fishermen there have different fishing patterns, because of different physical conditions at the seamount.  Expeditions  Since its discovery in August 1950 by R/V John N. Cobb, Cobb Seamount has been the target of passing cruises and sampling missions, totaling to over of soundings and dozens of samples by 1967. In 1968, Project Sea Use, a multi-party expedition aboard the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey oceanographic research vessel USC&GS; Oceanographer (R 101), visited the seamount, and much of what was initially known about it stems from the expedition. This was followed in 1970, two expeditions in the late 1970s, and 1992, however all have been fairly limited in scope. In 2012, an extensive scientific survey of Cobb Seamount was led jointly by Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) and the United States National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The survey used, among other methods, remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to conduct high-resolution surveys of the benthic (seafloor) community above a depth of 1200 meters (3,937 feet). There was tentative expert interest in installing an experimentation platform on Cobb Seamount. The seamount is an easily accessible distance from shore, and would give scientists the ability to work with Cobb Seamount's unique, isolated, and scientifically significant seamount biology. The idea was proposed by P. L. Peterson et al. in a presentation to the Offshore Technology Conference in 1969.

It is located on top of a hill in Thiksey approximately east of Leh in Ladakh, India.Singh (2006), p.91 It is noted for its resemblance to the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet and is the largest gompa in central Ladakh, notably containing a separate set of buildings for female renunciates that has been the source of significant recent building and reorganisation. The monastery is located at an altitude of in the Indus Valley. It is a twelve-storey complex and houses many items of Buddhist art such as stupas, statues, thangkas, wall paintings and swords. One of the main points of interest is the Maitreya Temple installed to commemorate the visit of the 14th Dalai Lama to this monastery in 1970; it contains a high statue of Maitreya, the largest such statue in Ladakh, covering two stories of the building. History In the early 15th century, Je Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelug School - often called \\"the Yellow Hats\\" - sent six of his disciples to remote regions of Tibet to spread the teachings of the new school. Tsongkhapa gave one of his disciples, Jangsem Sherab Zangpo (), a small statue of Amitayus (the sa·πÉbhogakƒÅya form of AmitƒÅbha), containing bone powder and a drop of Tsongkhapa's own blood. Tsongkhapa directed him to meet the King of Ladakh with a message seeking his help in the propagation of Buddhism.Jina, p.319-320 The King, who was then staying in the Nubra Valley near Shey, loved the gift of the statue. After this meeting, the King directed his minister to help Sherab Zangpo to establish a monastery of the Gelug order in Ladakh. As a result, in 1433, Zangpo founded a small village monastery called Lhakhang Serpo \\"Yellow Temple\\" in Stagmo, north of the Indus. In spite of his efforts, the lamas who embraced the Gelug order were initially few, although some of his disciples became eminent figures over the years.Jina, p.319-320Rizvi, pp. 231-232 Je Tsongkhapa pictured behind a prayer wheel, located in the steps that lead to the main part of Thikshe monastery. In the mid 15th century, Palden Zangpo continued the monastic work started by his teacher, Sherab Zangpo. He decided to build a larger monastery here that was dictated by an unusual event that occurred while choosing a site. Legends narrate that Tsongkhapa had predicted that his doctrine would prosper on the right bank of the Indus River. This prediction came true when the Thiksey Monastery was established. This was followed by others such as Spituk Monastery and Likir Monastery, which are also situated on the right bank of the Indus. According to legend, Sherab Zangpo and Palden Zangpo were performing some sacred rituals near the Yellow Temple. The torma offerings were then taken to a rock outcrop to be thrown down to the valley. As they were about to throw the torma into the valley, two crows appeared suddenly from somewhere and carried away the ceremonial plate with the offering of torma. They then placed the torma at a location on the other side of the hill. When Palden Zangpo and his disciples began looking for the torma, they reached Thiksey, where they found that the crow had placed the torma on a stone in perfect order and in an undisturbed condition. Palden took this finding as a divine directive to build the monastery here.Jina, p.320 The new Thiksey monastery was located a few kilometres away from Stagmo, on a sacred hill above a village of the same name. The monastery is believed to have been built on the site of an earlier Kadam establishment or as a daughter house of the small chapel of Stakmo about to the north.Rizvi (1996), pp. 231-232 Rinchen Zangpo is also known to have built a temple named Lakhang Nyerma at Thiksey dedicated to the protector Dorje Chenmo. Today, all that can be seen are some ruins. Thiksey grew in prominence in Ladakh, second only to Hemis Monastery, administering ten other monasteries in the region, such as Diskit, Spituk, Likir and Stok. The monastery came to own or control of land and some 25 villages became attached to the monastery. In around 1770, the lama of Hanle Monastery dictated that his elder son should inherit the throne of Ladakh while other princes should be lamas at Thikse and Spituk. As a result, princes such as Jigsmet Namgyal served as lamas at Thikse. Entrance of Thiksey Monastery =Modern history= Restoration of the old monasteries in Ladakh, including the Thiksey Monastery, is being carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India, at the request of the concerned Monastery administration. This, however, has not been without its controversy. It is said that the traditional mud and stone courtyards have been changed to granite, which has marred the brightness of the place. Similarly, the restored right wing of the monastery involving construction of new kitchen, the dining hall for the monks by replacing the old traditional central courtyard has caused dissonance to the entire old edifice of the monastery. As a result, a balance to the restoration and renovation works has been sought to retain the old order in consonance with the new works. Structure =Exterior= The courtyard and view from the monastery. Thikse Monastery is the largest such structure in central Ladakh. Located on a hill slope, its building are arranged in an ascending order of importance and are well spaced, from the foot of the hill housing the dwelling units to the top of the hill enshrining the monasteries and potang (official residence) of the chief lama. The architecture of the monastery strongly resembles the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, the former official seat of the Dalai Lamas.Kaur, p.94 Thus, Thikse Monastery is also known as 'Mini Potala'. The motorable approach roadBhasin (2006), p.106 from the valley passes through the east side of the Thikse Monastery's main building. There is statue of the Tibetan protective deity on this path at the entrance at the lower level. The highest level of the complex has a stupa (chorten). The monastery precinct at the foot of the hill has a courtyard from where a flight of steps leads to the main monastery (one of the 10 temples here), which is 12 stories in height. It has two main chambers. The monastery is painted in red, ochre and white and houses 60 lamas.\\"Handa (1987), p. 149\\">Handa (1987), p. 149 It has an attached nunnery. Like Likir and Rangdum monasteries, it was built as a fort monastery in the Central Tibetan pattern.\\"Handa (1987), p. 149\\"Handa (1987), p. 149 There are excellent views across the Indus Valley flood plain both east and westbound from it, from which the gompa at Matho (to the east), the royal palace at Stok (across the valley to the south) and the former royal palace at Shey (to the west) are clearly visible. =Maitreya Buddha= The statue of Maitreya Buddha at Thikse is two storeys tall. One of the main points of interest is the Maitreya (future Buddha) Temple erected to commemorate visit of the 14th Dalai Lama to this monastery in 1970. It contains a high statue of Maitreya Buddha, the largest such statue in Ladakh, covering two stories of the building. He is unusually portrayed as seated in the lotus position rather than his usual representations as standing or in a sitting posture on a high throne. It is the largest Buddha statue in the monastery, and took four years to build. It was made by the local artists under the master Shilp Guru Nawang Tsering of Central Institute of Buddhist Studies (Leh) - in clay, gold paint and copper. =Assembly Hall= The yellow building has the assembly hall. The red building has the guardian deity shrine. A wall at the entrance to the assembly hall or main prayer hall depicts murals of the Tibetan calendar with the Bhavacakra (Wheel of Life). This wheel has insignia images of a snake, a bird and a pig that signify ignorance, attachment, and aversion. The purpose of this depiction is meant to remind that these earthly ties need to be overcome in order to get enlightenment in life and to prevent the cycle of death and rebirth. The main prayer room next to this wall has many handwritten and painted books. Behind this prayer hall is the small inner sanctum of Gautama Buddha flanked by bodhisattvas, Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ to the right and Maitreya to the left. The assembly hall also has an image of the Thousand-armed Avalokite≈õvara with Padmasambhava. The centre of the assembly hall has a seat for the Dalai Lama and to its right, for the head lama and to its left, another deity is pictured. The hall also has murals of the deities Mahakala and SitƒÅtapatrƒÅ. 225 volumes of the Tengyur wrapped in silk are stored in wooden shelves in the hall. =Tara temple= A temple is also dedicated to goddess Tara with her 21 images placed in glass-covered wooden shelves. Also, small shrines devoted to several guardian divinities including Cham-spring - the protector deity of Thikse - can also be seen between the main courtyard and the staircase. The Chi-khang has an image of the Buddha with two of his disciples and the deity Yamantaka. The courtyard mural depicts Tsong Khapa, the Buddha, Padmasambhava, Palden Lhamo and Mahakala. =Lamokhang temple and quarters= The top floor of the monastery houses the Lamokhang temple, which is a repository of numerous volumes of scriptures including Kangyur and Stangyur. Only men are allowed to enter this floor. There are big stupas and mani walls at the entry to the monastery. A small room above the temple is exclusively used as a school room to teach local boys of the villages and some of these boys are chosen as Lamas. The top floor is also the official residence of the incarnate lama of the monastery. A large pillar engraved with the Buddha's teachings is also located here. The monastery complex has a number of white washed huts, which house the Lamas. Nunnery The nunnery or the school for the community of nuns is located within the precincts of the monastery and is managed by the Monastery Administration. In Ladakh, nunneries were held in a grossly inferior status and Buddhist nuns in particular lived in appalling conditions. In the 1990s, awareness was raised on the status of the nuns in Ladakh, and Thiksey received a degree of international attention and support. In 1995, the Sakyadhita Conference of Buddhist Women was held in Leh, leading to the establishment of the Ladakh Nuns Association in 1996. This was important in raising the status of the nuns in Ladakh, to ensure a shift in their functional role of \\"servitude and to one of true spiritual practice\\". The Chief Lama, Thiksey Rinpoche of Thiksey Monastery was also important in these positive developments in the betterment of nuns. The monastery donated the land for a new nunnery at Nyerma, near Thiksey, at the same place where the very first monastic seat was established by Rinchen Zangpo, the Tibetan translator, in the tenth century. The nunnery is now under the patronage of Thiksey Monastery. Today the nunnery houses 26 nuns, ranging from the ages of 43 to 87. The nuns themselves had taken steps to assert their position in the society by changing their traditional name of ‚Äòani‚Äô (literal meaning \\"aunt\\" - a derogatory connotation of a servant) to \\"cho-mos\\", the \\"female religious practitioners\\". They even adopted the testament of Mahaprajapati on this issue, expressed by Buddha's aunt and nun as their anthem. Under the influence of the 14th Dalai Lama's words, Thiksey Rinpoche Nawang Jamyang Chamba Stanzin and Tsultrim Tharchin, a geshe became nuns‚Äô activists at Thiksey. The Dutch Foundation for Ladakhi Nuns (DFLN), a charitable organisation also operates in Nyerma, providing monetary and individual services to support the Buddhist nuns of Ladakh. Festivals The annual festival held in the monastery precincts is known as the Gustor ritual, which is held from the 17th to 19th day of the ninth month of the Tibetan calendar (October‚ÄìNovember). Sacred dances such as the mask dance or Cham dance are performed as a part of this ritual. Another special feature is the trade fair held at the base of the monastery, in which villagers from all over Ladakh assemble to barter and trade items and socialize. Sand mandalas are made for smaller festivals. The morning prayers at 07:00, with synchronized chanting of s≈´tras at this monastery, attract many worshippers to observe the services.

According to the legend, it was founded in the 10th century by Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi,ÿ¥ÿßŸÉÿ± ŸÖÿµÿ∑ŸÅŸâ, ŸÖŸàÿ≥Ÿàÿπÿ© ÿØŸàÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ£ÿ≥ŸÑÿßŸÖŸä Ÿàÿ±ÿ¨ÿßŸÑŸáÿß ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿ≤ÿ° ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿßŸÑÿ´, (ÿØÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑÿπŸÑŸÖ ŸÑŸÑŸÖŸÑÿßŸäŸäŸÜ: 1993), p.1360 a Persian prince of Shiraz.James Hastings, Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics Part 24, (Kessinger Publishing: 2003), p.847 His family ruled the Sultanate until the year 1277. They were replaced by the Arab family of Abu Moaheb until 1505, when they were overthrown by a Portuguese invasion. By 1513, the sultanate was already fragmented into smaller states, many of which became protectorates of the Sultanate of Oman.  History  Principal cities of East Africa, c. 1500. The Kilwa Sultanate held overlordship from Cape Correntes in the south to Malindi in the north. The story of Kilwa begins around 960-1000 AD.Strong (1895: p.399) According to legend, Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi was one of seven sons of a ruler of Shiraz, Persia, his mother an Abyssinian slave. Upon his father's death, Ali was driven out of his inheritance by his brothers.Theal (1902). But according to the chronicle cited in Strong (1895), there were six sons, and all six plus their father fled the kingdom in different directions, after the father distilled a poor omen from a dream. Setting sail out of Hormuz, Ali ibn al-Hassan, his household and a small group of followers first made their way to Mogadishu, the main commercial city of the East African coast. However, Ali failed to get along with the city's Somali elite and he was soon driven out of that city as well. Steering down the African coast, Ali is said to have purchased the island of Kilwa from the local Bantu inhabitants. According to one chronicle (Strong, 1895), Kilwa was originally owned by a mainland Bantu king 'Almuli' and connected by a small land bridge to the mainland that appeared in low tide. The king agreed to sell it to Ali ibn al-Hassan for as much colored cloth as could cover the circumference of the island. But when the king later changed his mind, and tried to take it back, the Persians had dug up the land bridge, and Kilwa was now an island. Rather than being a literal retelling of events, this legendary history serves to legitimize the dynasty through ties to Islam. According to Horton and Middleman, \\"the descent from a noble Islamic family and an Abyssinian (Ethiopian) slave 'explains' why the rulers were both black but also with royal Muslim descent; the giving of cloth to the ruler made him 'civilized' and so his daughter became marriageable.\\"Horton and Middleman (2000: p.56) Kilwa's fortuitous position made it a much better East African trade center than Mogadishu. It quickly began to attract many merchants and immigrants from further north, including Persia and Arabia. In just a few years, the city was big enough to establish a satellite settlement at nearby Mafia Island. Kilwa's emergence as a commercial center challenged the dominance once held by Mogadishu over the East African coast. Suleiman Hassan, the ninth successor of Ali (and 12th ruler of Kilwa, c. 1178-1195), wrested control of the southerly city of Sofala. Wealthy Sofala was the principal entrepot for the gold and ivory trade with Great Zimbabwe and Monomatapa in the interior. The acquisition of Sofala brought a windfall of gold revenues to the Kilwa Sultans, which allowed them to finance their expansion and extend their powers all along the East African coast. At the zenith of its power in the 15th century, the Kilwa Sultanate owned or claimed overlordship over the mainland cities of Malindi, Inhambane and Sofala and the island-states of Mombassa, Pemba, Zanzibar, Mafia, Comoro and Mozambique (plus numerous smaller places) - essentially what is now often referred to as the \\"Swahili Coast\\". Kilwa also claimed lordship across the channel over the myriad of small trading posts scattered on the coast of Madagascar (then known by its Arabic name of Island of the Moon). To the north, Kilwa's power was checked by the independent Somali city-states of Barawa (a self-ruling aristocratic republic) and Mogadishu (the once-dominant city, Kilwa's main rival). To the south, Kilwa's reach extended as far as Cape Correntes, below which merchant ships did not usually dare sail. While a single figure, the Sultan of Kilwa, stood at the top of the hierarchy, the Kilwa Sultanate was not a centralized state. It was more a confederation of commercial cities, each with its own internal elite, merchant communities and trade connections. The Sultan might appoint a governor or overseer, but even his authority was not consistent - in some places (e.g. outposts like Mozambique Island) he was a true governor in the Sultan's name, whereas in more established cities like Sofala his powers were much more limited, more akin to an ambassador to the city, than its governor.  Society and economy  Despite its origin as a Persian colony, extensive inter-marriage and conversion of local Bantu inhabitants and later Arab immigration turned the Kilwa Sultanate into a veritable melting pot, ethnically indifferentiable from the mainland. The mixture of Perso-Arab and Bantu cultures is credited for creating a distinctive East African culture and language known today as Swahili (literally, 'coast-dwellers').Horton and Middleton (2000) Nonetheless, the Muslims of Kilwa (whatever their ethnicity) would often refer to themselves generally as Shirazi or Arabs, and to the unconverted Bantu peoples of the mainland as Zanj or Khaffirs ('infidels'). The Kilwa Sultanate was almost wholly dependent on external commerce. Effectively, it was a confederation of urban settlements, and there was little or no agriculture carried on within the boundaries of the sultanate. Grains (principally millet and rice), meats (cattle, poultry) and other necessary supplies to feed the large city populations had to be purchased from the Bantu peoples of the interior. Kilwan traders from the coast encouraged the development of market towns in the Bantu-dominated highlands of what are now Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. The Kilwan mode of living was as middlemen traders, importing manufactured goods (cloth, etc.) from Arabia and India, which were then swapped in the highland market towns for Bantu-produced agricultural commodities (grain, meats) for their own subsistence and precious raw materials (gold, ivory, etc.) which they would export back to Asia. The exception was the coconut palm tree. Grown all along the coast, the coconut palm was the mainstay of Kilwan life in every way - not only for the fruit, but also for timber, thatching and weaving. Kilwan merchant ships - from the large lateen-rigged dhows that plied the open oceans to the small zambucs used for local transit - were usually built from the split trunks of coconut palm wood, their sails made from coconut leaf matting and the ships held together by coconut coir. The Kilwa Sultanate conducted extensive trade with Arabia, Persia, and across the Indian Ocean, to India itself. Kilwan ships made use of the seasonal monsoon winds to sail across to India in the summer, and back to Africa in the winter. Kilwan pilots had a reputation for extraordinary sailing accuracy. The Portuguese marveled at their navigational instruments, particularly their latitude staves, which they considered superior to their own. Nonetheless, the coir-sewn Kilwan ships were not seaworthy enough to brave the treacherous waters and unpredictable violent gusts around Cape Correntes, so the entire region south of that point was rarely sailed by Kilwan merchants. Inhambane was the most southerly settlement that can be considered part of the Kilwan trading empire.  Decline and fall  In its later years, the Sultans of Kilwa began falling into the hands of their ambitious ministers (viziers and emirs), who played the roles of kingmakers, and de facto rulers, and occasionally tried to foist themselves (or one of their family members) on the throne, in competition with the royal dynasty. The most successful was probably Emir Muhammad Kiwabi, who ruled Kilwa for nearly two decades through several sultans, including himself at one point. Throughout his long 'reign', Emir Muhammad fought an on-again and off-again battle with his nephew, Hassan ibn Suleiman (son of an earlier vizier). Muhammad had, in fact, tried to install Hassan as sultan a couple of times, but it met tremendous resistance from the population of Kilwa. Eventually, Emir Muhammad decided that, in the interests of constitutional propriety and civic peace, Kilwa sultans should always come from the royal dynasty, not families of viziers. Muhammad held that line more-or-less down to the end, thwarting Hassan's ambitions. The last sultan installed by Emir Muhammad before his death was the royal prince al-Fudail ibn Suleiman in 1495. The man who succeeded to Muhammad's post, Emir Ibrahim (known as Mir Habrahemo in Barros, Abraemo in Goes), helped al-Fudail crush the ambitious Hassan once and for all in a great battle outside Kilwa. But it was not long after this battle that Emir Ibrahim is said to have betrayed and murdered sultan al-Fudail. Rather than declare himself sultan, Ibrahim took power merely with the title of emir, and claimed to be exercising rule in the name of a son of an earlier sultan Suleiman (ibn Muhammad?) of the old royal dynasty. That no one had seen or heard of this absent prince for years was quite convenient for Emir Ibrahim. Emir Ibrahim's usurpation was met with shock not only in Kilwa, but in the vassal cities as well. Emir Muhammad had (belatedly) recognized the importance of constitutional propriety for peace in the Kilwa Sultanate. Emir Ibrahim's murderous coup had run roughshod over it. Most of the local governors of the Kilwa vassal cities, many who were either relatives or had owed their positions to Emir Muhammad and the royal dynasty, refused to acknowledge the usurpation of Emir Ibrahim, and began charting an independent course for their own city-states. The writ of Emir Ibrahim probably only covered the city of Kilwa itself and possibly Mozambique Island.Theal (1902: p.110) This was more or less the condition of the Kilwa Sultanate when the Portuguese arrived. Portuguese scout P√™ro da Covilh√£, disguised as an Arab merchant, had travelled the length of the Kilwa Sultanate in 1489-90, and visited the ports of Malindi, Kilwa and Sofala, and delivered his scouting report back to Lisbon, describing the condition of the Kilwa Sultanate in quite some detail. The first Portuguese ships, under Vasco da Gama, on their way to India, reached the sultanate in 1497. Gama made contact with the Kilwa vassals of Mozambique, Mombassa and Malindi, seeking to secure their cooperation as staging posts for the Portuguese India Armadas. In 1500, the 2nd Portuguese India Armada, under Pedro √Ålvares Cabral, visited Kilwa itself, and attempted to negotiate a commercial and alliance treaty with Emir Ibrahim. But emir prevaricated and no agreement was reached. The well-armed Fourth Armada of 1502, under Vasco da Gama again, came in a more mean-spirited mood, indisposed to take no for an answer. Having secured separate treaties with Malindi, Mozambique and all-important Sofala, the Portuguese brought their menacing fleet to bear on Kilwa itself, and extorted a sizeable tribute from emir Ibrahim. Some have speculated whether Emir Ibrahim missed a golden opportunity to restore his fortunes, that had a treaty with Cabral been reached back in 1500, he might have secured the assistance of the Portuguese navy in bringing the half-independent vassals back under his sway. At least one Kilwan nobleman, a certain Muhammad ibn Rukn ad Din (known to the Portuguese as Muhammad Arcone), certainly advised Emir Ibrahim to strike up an alliance with the Portuguese (and for his pains, was given up as a hostage to the Portuguese by the Emir, who then refused ransom him back - allowing him to be subjected to Gama's wrath.) As it turns out, the vassals used the Portuguese, one by one, to secure their permanent break from the Sultanate. The ruler of Malindi was the first to embrace the Portuguese, forging an alliance in 1497 (largely to be directed against Mombassa). After Emir Ibrahim's coup, it was certainly not hard to persuade the ruling sheikh Isuf of Sofala (Y√ßuf in Barros, √áufe in Goes) (apparently a nephew of the late Emir Muhammad) to break away. He signed a treaty with the Portuguese in 1502, and followed it up by allowing the construction of a Portuguese factory and fort in Sofala in 1505. It was in 1505 that Francisco de Almeida brought his fleet into the harbor of Kilwa, and landed some 500 Portuguese soldiers to drive Emir Ibrahim out of the city. Almeida installed the aforementioned Muhammad Arcone on the throne, as a Portuguese vassal. Remembering constitutional proprieties, Arcone insisted that Micante, the son of the late sultan al- Fudail be his designated successor. The Portuguese erected a fortress (Fort Santiago) on Kilwa and left a garrison behind, under the command of Pedro Ferreira Foga√ßa to keep an eye on things. Portuguese rule was not very welcome. Particularly grating was the imposition of Portuguese Mercantilist laws on the sultanate, forbidding all but Portuguese ships to carry trade to the principal coastal towns - essentially putting many leading Kilwan merchants out of business. The Portuguese did not stay very long. In May, 1506, Muhammad Arcone was lured and assassinated by the sheikh of Tirendicunde (a relative of Emir Ibrahim). As per the pre-arranged succession rule, Micante ascended to the throne. But Foga√ßa, seeing that Micante's ascension was supported by the old faction of Emir Ibrahim, concluded he would not do as a Portuguese puppet. Consequently, he deposed Micante and installed Hussein ibn Muhammad, a son of Arcone, as the new sultan. Chaos broke out in the city of Kilwa. Partisans of Micante (& Emir Ibrahim) seized control of much of the city, driving sultan Hussein (and the partisans of Arcone) to seek refuge by the Portuguese Fort Santiago. Street fighting and soon fires broke out. In the chaos, streams of Kilwan residents fled the city, leaving it practically deserted, save for a handful of roving partisan gangs and the terrified Portuguese garrison. Hearing of the Kilwan chaos all the way in India, the Portuguese vice-roy Almeida dispatched a magistrate Nuno Vaz Pereira, to inquire into the matter. Arriving in late 1506, Pereira convened the competing sultans Micante and Hussein, and asked them present their cases. Pereira ruled in favor of Hussein, confirming him as sultan, but softened the blow by relieving the unpopular commander Foga√ßa and lifting the mercantilist restrictions on Kilwa shipping. The Kilwan refugees returned and a modicum of peace resumed, but only briefly. For Hussein put it in his head to lead the Kilwan army against Tirendicunde, to avenge his father's murder. The town was brutally sacked, and numerous prisoners taken. Hussein then dispatched emissaries to all the vassal cities of the Kilwa Sultanate, ordering them to return to obedience, or else meet the same fate. Fearing that Hussein's spate of tyranny might jeopardize Portuguese interests in East Africa, viceroy Almeida reversed Pereira's decision, deposed Hussein and reinstated Micante.  Rulers  The chronology of rulers of the Kilwa Sultanate is reported in a chronicle translated into Portuguese in the 16th century, and recorded by the chronicler Jo√£o de Barros.Jo√£o de Barros (1552) Decadas da Asia (Dec. I, Lib. 8, Cap. 6). There is another surviving chronicle by an unknown author, written in the early 16th century, and compiled in 1862 by (or for) sheikh Moheddin (Majid?) of Zanzibar.The Zanzibar chronicle is translated in Strong (1895) The Barros and Zanzibar chronicles are not always in concordance with each other. The following follows Barros in its outlines, but fills in details from the Zanzibar chronicle. Alternate spellings and nicknames, mainly given in Barros's chronicle, are in italics. Dates are approximate years of ascension.Dates utilize the list compiled in Bosworth (1996:p. 132). Bosworth's dates are often inconsistent with Barros (1552), whose own dating is recorded below in the \\"ruled x years\\" format. =Shirazi era= * 1. (957 CE) Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi (IghawumijStrong (1895: p.388)) - founder of Kilwa * 2. (?) Muhammad ibn Ali (Ali Bumale, son of previous) - ruled forty years. Had no children. * 3. (996) Ali ibn Bashat (Ali Busoloquete, nephew or cousin of previous) - elected by Kilwa colonists. He was the son of Bashat ibn al-Hassan, the brother of sultan Ali ibn al-Hassan; Bashat had been appointed by his brother as the first ruler of Mafia Island. Bashat's son Ali ruled Kilwa for four and a half years. * 4. (c. 1001)Unclear dates given by Bosworth (1996:p.132), who gives simply the range 999-1003 as possible ascension date for Dawud ibn Ali, gives a wide-open ascension date for Ali ibn Dawud (btw 1042-1111); Bosworth also omits Khalid ibn Bakr and Ali ibn Dawud II in his list. Following Barros (1552: p.227-28)'s more precise dating, assuming 996 to be correct for Ali ibn Bashat, then the dates of his successors are 1001 (Dawud ibn Ali), 1005 (Khalid ibn Bakr), 1007 (al-Hassan ibn Suleiman), 1023 (Ali ibn Dawud I), 1083 (Ali ibn Dawud II), 1089 (al-Hassan ibn Dawud), 1113 (Suleiman) after which Barros becomes unclear again. Dawud ibn Ali (son of previous) - deposed after four years by Matata Mandalima, king of the Changa/Xanga.Changa is the name given by the chronicles for a mainland Bantu kingdom that repeatedly harassed the early Kilwa colony. It is a possible reference to the local 'Changamire' dynasty that, in the 15th century, began to challenge the overlordship of the Monomatapa and would go on to overthrow it and establish the Rozwi confederacy. The Changamire is not known to have existed at the time the chronicles suggest, but they were beginning to emerge at the time the chronicle was written down, and so may be a reference to their ancestors. Dawud fled to Mafia island, where he died. * 5. (c. 1005) Khalid ibn Bakr (Hale Bonebaquer; said to be nephew of Matata Mandalima), installed as ruler of Kilwa by the Changa. Ruled only two years, deposed in uprising by Persian colonists.Dating unclear. Not being Shirazi, Khalid ibn Bakr is not in Bosworth's (1996) list. But he is given in Zanzibar Chronicle (Strong, 1895: p.389) and Barros (1552: 226). * 6. (1005/07) al-Hassan ibn Suleiman ibn Ali (Hocen Soleiman, nephew of the late Dawud) - installed by Persian colonists after uprising against Changa puppet, ruled 16 years.Zanzibar Chronicle (Strong 1895: p.389) claims al-Hassan fled to Zanzibar following a second invasion by the Changa, who installed a usurping emir Muhammad ibn al-Hussein al-Mundhiri. But the usurper was quickly toppled in a popular rising, and the exiled sultan al-Hassan was restored. Dates are problematic. Barros (1552: p.226) claims al-Hassan ruled sixteen years and was succeeded by his nephew Ali ibn Dawud, who ruled sixty. But Bosworth (1996) identifies Ali as only ascending around 1042, leaving the intervening gap unaccounted for. *7. (1023?) Ali ibn Dawud I (son of Dawud, nephew of al-Hassan)- ruled 60 years. *8. (1083?) Ali ibn Dawud II (grandson of Ali ibn Dawud) - ruled 6 years, a deranged tyrant, deposed by people of Kilwa, and condemned to die in a well. * 9. (1106)Given 1089 by Barros's calculation, but 1106 in Bosworth al-Hassan ibn Dawud (Hacen ben Daut, brother of Ali ibn Dawud II) - elevated by people of Kilwa, to replace his despised brother. Ruled 24 years. * 10. (1129)Given 1113 by Barros's calculation, but 1129 in Bosworth Suleiman (patronym unclear, \\"of royal lineage\\") - deposed and beheaded by people of Kilwa after only two years. * 11. (1131) Dawud ibn Suleiman (son of previous) made his original career and fortune in Sofala, before being recalled to Kilwa to replace his father. Ruled 40 years. * 12.(1170) Suleiman ibn al-Hassan ibn Dawud (Soleiman Hacen, son of ninth sultan given above), one of the greatest of Kilwa sultans, credited for conquering much of the Swahili Coast, bringing Sofala, Pemba, Zanzibar and portions of the mainland under Kilwa's rule;Barros (1552: p.227) identifies Suleiman ibn al-Hassan as the son of Dawud ibn Suleiman, inheriting his enterprises in Sofala, which he used as a launchpad to become lord of Sofala and master of the Swahili coast. responsible for erecting many buildings in Kilwa itself, including its stone fortress and palaces, transforming the city into a veritable metropolis. Ruled 18 years. * 13. (1189) Dawud ibn Suleiman (son of previous) ruled 2 years. * 14. (1190) Talut ibn Suleiman (brother of previous) ruled 1 year * 15. (1191) Hussein ibn Suleiman (brother of previous) - ruled 25 years. Died without heirs. * 16. (1215) Khalid ibn Suleiman (Hale Bonij brother of previous) - ruled 10 years * 17. (1225) ? ibn Suleiman (Bone Soleiman, nephew of previous, son of ?) - ruled 40 years * 18. (1263-7) Ali ibn Dawud (uncertain connection) - ruled 14 years. End of Persian Shirazi dynasty c. 1277, beginning of Mahdali dynasty of Yemeni Arab sayyids, or what the Zanzibar chronicle calls the \\"family of Abu al-Mawahib\\". =Mahdali era= * 19. (1277) al-Hassan ibn Talut (grandson of Ali ibn Dawud) - seized power by force, ruled 18 years; had a reputation as \\"an excellent knight\\".\\"que foi mui excellente Cavalleiro\\" (Barros, 1552: p.228) * 20. (1294) Suleiman ibn Hassan (son of previous) - ruled 14 years; murdered by conspirators upon leaving a mosque. Partisans proclaimed his son Hassan ibn Suleiman ruler, but as he was on pilgrimage in Mecca at the time, the throne was temporarily passed to Hassan's brother Dawud. * 21.(1308) Daud ibn Suleiman (son of previous) - ruled 2 years in name of his brother Hassan. Stepped down voluntarily on Hassan's return from Mecca. * 22. (1310) Abu al- Mawahib al-Hasan ibn Sulaiman(brother of previous) - acclaimed earlier while absent in Mecca; ruled 24 years. Died without heirs. * 23. (1333) Dawud ibn Suleiman (same as 21st, brother of previous) - second time on throne, this time in his own right. Ruled 24 years.Zanzibar chronicle (Strong, 1895: p.390) claims Dawud ruled for only a few days and was deposed by his uncle. Probably confusing this ith his son, Suleiman. * 24. (1356) Suleiman ibn Dawud (son of previous) - first time, ruled only 20 days. Deposed by his uncle, Hussein al- Ma'tun. * 25. (1356) Hussein ibn Suleiman al-Mat'un (uncle of previous) ruled 6 years. Died in battle against the \\"Almuli\\", a Bantu people on the mainland, without heirs. * 26. (1362) Talut ibn Dawud (nephew of previous, brother of earlier Suleiman) - ruled only one year. Deposed by his brother, the ex-king Suleiman.Zanzibar chronicle (Strong 1895: p.390) cites Talut ibn Dawud as Talut ibn Hussein, suggesting he was a son rather than nephew of previous. Also says he died while on pilgrimage to Mecca, and was succeeded by either his son or brother. * 27. (1364) Suleiman ibn Dawud (brother of previous, 2nd reign) - 2 years and 4 months. Deposed by his uncle Suleiman * 28. (1366) Suleiman ibn Suleiman ibn Hussein (uncle of previous) - ruled 24 years * 29. (1389) Hussein ibn Suleiman (son of previous) - ruled 24 years * 30. (1412) Muhammad ibn Suleiman al-Adil (al-Malik al-Adil, Mahamed Ladil, brother of previous) - ruled 9 years Known as Muhammad Ladil to Barros; Zanzibar chronicle names him as 'al-Malik al-Adil', and gives his real name as Muhammad ibn Suleiman ibn al-Hussein, claiming he had served as vizier, and was elevated to the throne by the nobles and people. Also claims he ruled 22, rather 9 years. * 31. (1421) Suleiman ibn Muhammad (son of previous) - ruled 22 years. Died without heirs. Said to have rebuilt the mosque of Kilwa Zanzibar chronicle reports it was his nephew Hajj Rush (son of earlier sultan Hussein) that rebuilt the mosque of Kilwa, adamant about doing so with his own money and resources. Nonetheless, his uncle sultan Suleiman insisted on donating one thousand pieces of gold to the effort; Hajj Rush accepted the donation reluctantly, but secretly put the money aside, and returned the donation to Suleiman's heirs after the sultan's died. * 32. (1442) Ismail ibn Hussein (uncle of previous) - ruled 14 years. Challenged by pretender Sa'id ibn Hassan, who secured the support of Hassan ibn Abu Bakr, ruler of Zanzibar. The Zanzibaris assembled a coalition to seize Kilwa by force. But Ismail's ministers, vizier Suleiman and Emir Muhammad managed to bribe the key organizer of the expedition, who withdrew the Zanzibari troops and left pretender Sa'id stranded on the beach of Kilwa with only a small body of attendants. Although pardoned by Ismail, Sa'id went into hiding. * 33. (1454) vizier Suleiman (vizier of previous) At death of sultan Ismail, in the first known usurpation by ministers, the vizier Suleiman and Emir Muhammad al-Mazlum launched a coup and seized power together, with Suleiman declaring himself Sultan. However, popular opinion was strongly against the vizier, so he decided to pass the throne over to the more popular Emir Muhammad. * 34. (1454) Muhammad ibn al-Hussein ibn Muhammad ibn Suleiman al-Mazlum ('Emir Muhammad', noble co-conspirator with previous) According to Zanzibar chronicle, after the death of vizier Suleiman, Muhammad appointed the old pretender Sa'id ibn Hassan to the post as his own vizier. Muhammad died shortly after. Reigned for less than a year.(deposed, according to Barros). * 35 (1455) Ahmad ibn Suleiman (son of the late vizier?), deposed within a year by partisans of the old royal family. (Barros omits Ahmad, says the partisans deposed Muhammad directly). * 36 (1456) al-Hassan ibn Ismail (son of 32nd sultan Ismail), installed by coup. Ruled ten years. * 37. (1466) Sa'id ibn al- Hassan/Hussein (son of previous, according to Barros; same old pretender (cf.32nd) according to Zanzibar chronicle) - ruled 10 years, Upon his death, the Kilwa Sultanate fell into disarray. There was another ministerial coup d'√©tat. * 38. (1476) Suleiman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Husayn ('Vizier Suleiman') vizier seized throne after death of Sa'id, declared himself sultan and elevated his own brother, Muhammad Kiwabi, to the dignity of emir. But vizier- turned-sultan Suleiman's rule lasted little over a year. * 39. (1477) Abdullah ibn al-Hassan (brother of 37th sultan Sa'id) elevated by people of Kilwa against usurping vizier Suleiman. Ruled one and half years. * 40. (1478) Ali ibn Hassan (brother of previous). Ruled 1.5 years. Upon his death, Emir Muhammad Kiwabi (brother of the late vizier Suleiman) seized power, and installed his nephew al-Hassan as sultan. * 41 (1479) al-Hassan ibn Suleiman (son of vizier Suleiman), first time, installed by his uncle, Emir Muhammad. But al-Hassan proved an unpopular sultan and was deposed by his own uncle after 6 years. * 42. (1485) Sabhat ibn Muhammad ibn Suleiman ('Xumbo', a scion of royal lineage, son of 31st sultan, al-Adil) installed by Emir Muhammad, after popular opposition to his first choice al-Hassan. Ruled one year, then died. According to Zanzibar chronicle, Emir Muhammad tried to install his nephew al-Hassan again. * 43. (1486) al-Hassan ibn Suleiman (second time) installed by uncle Emir Muhammad once again, but popular opposition proved too strong. Emir Muhammad decided to depose al-Hassan once again and look for a suitable sultan from the royal dynasty. * 44. (1490) Ibrahim ibn Muhammad (brother of Sabhat, another son of al-Adil) installed by Emir Muhammad to replace his nephew al-Hassan. But the deposed al-Hassan ibn Suleiman launched a coup attempt to depose Ibrahim, that resulted in quite some bloodshed. In the end, al-Hassan's ambitions were foiled by his uncle Emir Muhammad, who, seeking to restore order, declared unambiguously that Ibrahim, a descendant of kings, had precedence over al-Hassan, who was only of a family of viziers. al- Hassan driven into exile on the mainland. Ibrahim ruled for two years, until Emir Muhammad decided to depose him himself.Barros suggests Ibrahim was the son of Emir Muhammad, and thus of the vizier family. The Zanzibar chronicle insists he was a brother of Sabhat, and thus of royal lineage (son of 31st sultan Muhammad al-Adil). Our list opts for the latter. * 45. (1495) Muhammad ibn Kiwab ('Emir Muhammad Kiwabi', the powerful emir) declared himself sultan, only very briefly, probably just to show he can or to satisfy his curiosity or perhaps just to forestall a renewed bid by his exiled nephew al-Hassan while he sorted through other candidates. In any case, Muhammad abdicated soon after, and installed another royal family member, al-Fudail. * 46. (1495) al- Fudail ibn Suleiman ('Alfudail', nephew of Ibrahim, thus of royal blood) installed by Emir Muhammad, after his own abdication. This is 1495 AD (901 AH). Immediately after ascension, exiled ex-ruler Hassan ibn Suleiman returned with a mixed army of Bantus and Kilwan exiles to reclaim the throne. The sheikh of Zanzibar offered to mediate, and, through his good offices, al- Fudail even contemplated ceding the throne to Hassan and ending the quarrel. But Emir Muhammad refused to allow it. Instead, he promised al-Hassan an amnesty, but only if he returned to private life in Kilwa. While awaiting Hassan's reply to this offer, the great Emir Muhammad Kiwabi died rather suddenly. In the confusion, pretender Hassan infiltrated troops into Kilwa city, under the command of his own son Sa'id. Caught by city authorities, Sa'id invented a story about just 'preparing the house' for his father's peaceful return to Kilwa as a private citizen. To allay suspicions, Sa'id finally proposed to lead a Kilwan embassy, escorted by a squad of city troops, to his father's encampment to confirm his story. Thinking the crisis had been defused, at least until the embassy returned from its investigation, Kilwa let its guard down. But the embassy did not return. Rather, Sa'id led it to at trap, and it was massacred. The army of al-Hassan attacked that very same night. The surprised city rallied frantically to its defenses, and a great and bloody battle ensued outside the gates of the city. The Kilwans defeated al- Hassan and put an end to the perennial pretender. The victorious Sultan al- Fudail appointed a certain Ibrahim ibn Suleiman as emir, to replace the late Emir Muhammad. But this state of affairs only lasted a few years. End of Mahdali dynasty c. 1495, beginning of a series of usurpers and Portuguese puppets. =Portuguese era = * 47. (1499) Ibrahim ibn Suleiman ('Emir Ibrahim', 'Mir Habraemo' in Portuguese) minister of Sultan al-Fudail; deposed and murdered the sultan and took power himself not as sultan, but in the name of an absent son of an earlier sultan Suleiman. Incensed, the regional vassals of the Kilwan Sultanate refuse to recognize the usurpation. Emir Ibrahim will be driven out and deposed by the Portuguese captain Francisco de Almeida in 1505. * 48. (1505) Muhammad ibn Rukn ad Din (Muhammad 'Arcone' to the Portuguese, Kilwan noble, not of royal lineage) installed by Francisco de Almeida as Portuguese vassal sultan of Kilwa. But remembering the importance of constitutional propriety, Muhammad immediately appointed royal prince Muntari, the son of late al-Fudail, as his successor. He was assassinated after a year. * 49 (1506) Micante Possible link to Australia In 1944, nine coins were found on Marchinbar Island, the largest island in the Wessel Islands of the Northern Territory of Australia. While four coins were identified as Dutch duits dating from 1690 to the 1780s, five with Arabic inscriptions were identified as being from the Kilwa Sultanate.The coins are now held by the Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, Australia. In 2018 another coin, also thought to be from Kilwa, was found on a beach on Elcho Island, another of the Wessel Islands.

Plot A pilot, Captain Greta Cooper (played by Essence Atkins), begins hallucinating while in a United States Air Force jet simulator. Meanwhile, House is being pressured by Cuddy to whittle down his applicant pool. He makes a show of firing many of them arbitrarily, before being paged by Cooper, who seeks to bribe him into diagnosing her off the record, as she doesn't want NASA to disqualify her from the astronaut program. House is initially uninterested, but becomes intrigued when she mentions her sudden synesthesia. House presents her to his recruits, then splits them up to run various tests ‚Äî and wash his car. While talking to his applicants in his office, House thinks he sees Chase walking past the doorway. House orders Cooper into a hyperbaric chamber where Applicants 6, 18, and 24 attempt to flush out excess oxygen, but she collapses with a heart attack. They try to defibrillate, but it starts a fire in the oxygen chamber, setting off the sprinklers. Later, they determine the heart attack was not caused by the treatment. House then sends them to run tests and look for infectious substances in the cafeteria. House confides to Wilson that he saw Chase, but Wilson says Chase is in Scottsdale, Arizona, and suggests House is feeling repressed guilt. House is not amused. The applicants check in with House who orders thyroid tests. Cooper's temperature begins to rise. The applicants inadvertently reveal they broke into her house, and she becomes paranoid and begins to hear color again. They sedate her, but Cuddy notices and wants to know who Cooper is. House thinks he sees Cameron walk through the lobby. Cuddy goes to the applicants for answers and they have to admit they do not know much ‚Äî until one of the applicants squeals. Cuddy insists that House document everything. After figuring out who squealed, House tries to figure out how to test Cooper without having to document anything for Cuddy. He gives them an hour, then goes to Wilson to find out why Cameron is there. Wilson says she is also in Arizona, where she and Chase are engaged, and predicts that House is going to choose the recruits that House himself dislikes the most. House picks up on the idea of stress and suggests that they stress Cooper's liver. Just after being fired, one of the applicants, (Kal Penn), suggests they get her drunk. House likes his idea, and keeps him in the running. He decides to use some of the other applicants as a control group to see how quickly Cooper gets drunk. After seeing his Brigham Young University class ring, House recruits a Mormon applicant as a baseline. House takes a couple of drinks, after which he believes he sees Foreman outside. Meanwhile, Cooper is having breathing problems but refusing treatment. Cuddy interrupts House's pursuit of Foreman and asks why he has ordered irrelevant tests, pointing out Foreman is working in New York City. House returns to the room to find they have taken Cooper to the physical training room so they would have an excuse for giving her oxygen. House determines she has either lung cancer or tuberous sclerosis, and tries to order a biopsy. One of the applicants, Taub the plastic surgeon, proposes they suggest she undergo elective breast augmentation, thus providing a reasonable excuse for any scarring. Cooper undergoes the surgery and they biopsy the lungs, finding cysts. Chase appears at the surgery to suggest a diagnosis: Von Hippel-Lindau disease, which House confirms. The applicants wonder aloud whether House will hire Chase, but Chase quietly shakes his head. After removing the cysts, House confronts Wilson, who admits that Chase and Cameron are still working in the hospital (although Foreman is, indeed, in New York). House visits Cooper and claims he called NASA and told them of her condition. With Cooper diagnosed, House dismisses most of the applicants, and tells the rest to come back the next day. He confronts Henry and observes he has never been to medical school. Henry admits he worked in the Columbia med school admissions office and, while he audited all the classes, never received a diploma. House suggests that Henry could still work as his assistant. House goes to see Cameron in the E.R., and she reveals she's been working there for three weeks, was the one who gave House's pager number to Cooper. House in turn reveals he did not actually tell NASA about Cooper's condition, and in fact lied to prevent anyone else from telling NASA, reasoning that Cooper's knowledge of her risk will make her a more careful pilot. Cameron is skeptical of his reason for doing so, suggesting instead that he was not willing to crush her dream.

History  The basis for the space cooperation between China and Brazil was established in May 1984, when both countries signed a complementary agreement to the cooperation framework agreement in science and technology. In July 1988, China and Brazil signed the protocol establishing the joint research and production of the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellites (CBERS). Brazil, emerging from a long military regime, sought to abandon the Cold War logic and establish new international partnerships. China was dedicated to its great internal reform, but was also seeking international partnerships to develop advanced technologies. The agreement was advantageous for both countries. Brazil had the chance to develop medium-size satellites at a time when it was only capable of building small ones (100 kg size). China had an international partner that posed no military threats and that was receptive of foreigners. Brazil and China negotiated the CBERS project during two years (1986‚Äì1988), exchanging important technical information and visiting each other's facilities, and they concluded that both sides had all the human, technical and material conditions to jointly develop an Earth resource observation satellite program. The Complementary Protocol on Cooperation on Space Technology was renewed in 1994 and again in 2004.  Responsible agencies  In Brazil, the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE or National Institute for Space Research) and the Brazilian Space Agency (; AEB) are involved with the program, as is the Brazilian industrial sector. In China, organizations involved include the China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) (a sub-entity of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation) (CASC), the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and various other organizations.  Satellites  Initially the program included development and deployment of two satellites, CBERS-1 and CBERS-2. A third satellite of the same type, which was named CBERS-2B, was later added to the program. Subsequently, agreement was reached to build and launch three additional satellites, CBERS-3, 4 and 4A. = CBERS-1 and CBERS-2 = The first satellite of the series, CBERS-1, was successfully launched on 14 October 1999 on a Long March 4B. In China, it is sometimes also called ZY 1. It remained functional until August 2003. The second satellite, CBERS-2, was successfully launched on October 21, 2003 by a Long March 4B rocket from China. It was retired from service in January 2009, after the launch of CBERS-2B.  Configuration  CBERS-1 and 2 are almost identical satellites. They have three remote sensing multispectral cameras: * Wide Field Imager Camera. This camera records images in two spectral bands: 0.63 ‚Äì 0.69 Œºm (red) and 0.77 ‚Äì 0.89 Œºm (infrared), with 260 m spatial resolution and 890 km of ground swath. About five days are necessary for a whole coverage of the Earth surface. * Medium Resolution Camera. This camera records images in five spectral bands: 0.51 ‚Äì 0.73 Œºm (panchromatic); 0.45 ‚Äì 0.52 Œºm (blue); 0.52 ‚Äì 0.59 Œºm (green); 0.63 ‚Äì 0.69 Œºm (red); 0.77 ‚Äì 0.89 Œºm (near infrared), with 20 m spatial resolution and 120 km of ground swath. It is possible to operate this camera both on nadir and off-nadir. This last capability allows the system to reduce the temporal resolution from 26 days (nadir operation mode) to three days (off-nadir operation mode). * Infrared Multispectral Scanner Camera. This camera records images in four spectral bands: 0.50 ‚Äì 1.10 Œºm (panchromatic); 1.55 ‚Äì 1.75 Œºm (infrared); 2.08 ‚Äì 2.35 Œºm (infrared) and 10.40 ‚Äì 12.50 Œºm (thermal infrared), with 80 m spatial resolution on the three infrared reflected bands and 120 m in the thermal infrared one. Ground swath is 120 km for all the bands of this camera and 26 days are required to obtain a full coverage of the Earth by this camera. = CBERS-2B = CBERS-2B was launched on 19 September 2007 by a Long-March 4B rocket from the Taiyuan base in China. The satellite operated until June 2010. Sample images from CBERS-2B were made available on January 10, 2007. CBERS-2B is similar to the two previous members of the series, but a new camera was added to this last satellite: High Resolution Panchromatic Camera (HRC). This camera records images in one single panchromatic band 0.50 ‚Äì 0.80 Œºm which comprises part of the visible and of the near infrared portion of electromagnetic spectrum.

He became famous for his exceptional illustrations of the poems of the prominent poet and translator Samuil Marshak, such as Circus, Ice Cream, Tale About a Foolish Mouse, Moustached and Striped, Book of Many Colours, Twelve Months and Luggage. As a young boy, Lebedev started to paint postcards that were sold in a shop in Saint Petersburg. At the age of nineteen, he held his first exhibit at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1913, he began work as a cartoonist for several satirical journals, including the famed \\"Satirikon\\" (–°–∞—Ç–∏—Ä–∏–∫–æ–Ω). At this time he was already a prolific illustrator for the children's magazines \\"Jackdaw\\" (–ì–∞–ª—á–æ–Ω–æ–∫), \\"Blue Journal\\" (–°–∏–Ω–∏–π –ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª), \\"Everyone's Journal\\" (–ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª –¥–ª—è –≤—Å–µ—Ö), and \\"Argus\\" (–ê—Ä–≥—É—Å). He illustrated the children's book \\"The Lion and the Bull\\" in 1917. From 1920-1922, Lebedev worked for The Russian Telegraph Agency (ROSTA) and The Department of Agitation\\" (Agitprop) designing propaganda posters. By the 1920s, Lebedev had friendly relations with many distinguished persons of his time, such as Tatlin, Ivan Puni, Kazimir Malevich, Vladimir Mayakovsky and the literary critic Nikolay Punin. In 1915 he married the sculptor Sarra Lebedeva. In the 1920s, Lebedev had earned the title of \\"King of the Children's Book.\\" A pioneer in the field of children's illustration, he would later say on the influence of his works \\"I still consider to have positively influenced the creation of a new Soviet book for children, and, what is more important, this book acquired a character of its own\\" Nikolai Punin, who wrote the first monograph on Lebedev, cited Lebedev as one of the most important illustrators of the era: \\"After his brilliant experiments with \\"Circus\\" and \\"Ice Cream\\" and a number of other children's books executed by him, bookstores burst into color with numerous imitations of his examples, and book illustrations in the receding cultural tradition‚Äîall the 'World of Art' illustrations‚Äîpaled in comparison, and, in terms of form, began to seem impotent, overly concerned with aesthetics, and unexpressive.\\" In 1930s-1940s he created numerous portraits of his friends, professional models and sportsmen. He always was fond of playing sports himself. From the end of the 1930s he started to use stronger colours and thicker layers of paint, creating effects reminiscent of the works of Renoir. As was the case with many artists and writers working under Stalinism, Lebedev ran afoul of official censorship. The book Inside the Rainbow - Russian Children's Literature 1920-35: Beautiful Books, Terrible Times offered by Dutch publishers Pegasus details threats made by Soviet authorities against Lebedev. The book was the subject of reviews in The Guardian and The Financial Times, among other publications. In 2012, his work was included in an exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art.

Small tucks, especially multiple parallel tucks, may be used to decorate clothing or household linens. When the tucks are very narrow, they are called pintucks or Pin-tucking. Tucks are also used to shorten a finished garment, especially a child's garment, so that it may be lengthened (\\"let down\\") as the child grows by removing the stitching holding the tuck in place. In Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, Amy says: Tucks, made easy with the invention of the sewing machine, were very popular as ornamentation in the latter half of the 19th century, especially in fine linen or cotton fabric for chemisettes, engageantes, blouses, lingerie, summer dresses, and children's garments. Tucks were also used to decorate heavier fabrics: a travelling suit of \\"rough cheviot\\" (sturdy wool) is described as having its skirt \\"tucked, each tuck two inches wide and two inches apart, eight tucks in all, box-pleating at the bottom\\".Cunnington, C.

Pickard-Cambridge in 1889. It includes sixteen described species that occur from South America up to the southern and eastern USA. It is presumably related to Aculepeira, Amazonepeira and Metepeira. They spin small webs from which they hang upside down and attract male moths that fly into a basket formed by their legs. They use a moth pheromone for this, which resembles the one used by the bolas spiders of the genus Mastophora. Though they belong to the same family, the two genera are not closely related, so this is likely an example of convergent evolution. All species are pale yellow-white with scattered, small, white, brown and black random spots, or in some species transverse bands. Females have a body length of about . Males are less than half the size of females and less pigmented. Kaira specimens are uncommon in arachnologist collections, and the females of different species are difficult to separate. Females and immatures can be confused with species of the not closely related genus Pozonia. Behavior When a fly was put into a jar containing a K. alba, the female dropped from the underside of the lid on what seemed a single thread about long and hung there until the fly blundered into her. Then she clamped her legs around it and killed it. Instead of constructing orb webs, they construct a small trapezoidal web, containing two triangular zigzags of threads, which is remade every twenty minutes. The spider then hangs upside-down by the fourth leg on the lower and shorter parallel edge of the trapezoid, which is spread by the other legs. When a moth flies into the basket formed by the spider's legs, it is clasped and bitten, and later wrapped in araneid-like fashion. The moth is then hung from a trapeze line between the last legs of the spider, which resumes the hunting posture. As many as eight moths can be caught in this way before the spider starts feeding.

He is best known for having designed the national flag of Brittany. Biography Marchal's design for the flag of Brittany.A former pupil of the Saint Martin's day college of Rennes, Marchal went on to study architecture at the Rennes School of Art. In 1918 he joined the Breton Regionalist Union and became involved with its journal Breiz Atao (\\"Brittany Always!\\") and the nationalist youth movement Breton Youth. In 1923 he designed the Breton national flag Gwenn ha du (\\"Black and White\\"). An artist, poet and illustrator, he participated in many Breton publications, political and intellectual. He also belonged to \\"Seiz Breur\\", a group of Breton artists. He took part in the creation of the Breton Separatist Party (PAB) at the first congress of Breiz Atao, held in September 1927 at Rosporden. He was a member of the party's management committee. In constant conflict with the pro-Nazi nationalist Olier Mordrel, he finally broke with Breiz Atao.Philippe Rault, Les drapeaux bretons des origines √† nos jours, Coop Breizh, At the 11 April 1931 congress, the PAB split. Mordrel set up the fascist Breton National Party, and Marchal joined the moderate Breton Federalist League, from which in 1932 he founded the journal Federal Brittany. In 1934, he joined the Breton Federalist Movement, with Y. Gestalen, Francis Bayer of Kern, Goulven Maz√©as and Rafig Tullou. In 1938 he signed the manifesto of the Breton federalists, which affirmed: > ...the pressing duty to gather those of our compatriots who do not want to > confuse Brittany with the Church; Brittany with reaction; Brittany with > puerile anti-French bias; Brittany with capitalism; and even less, Brittany > with racism.Manifesto of Breton Federalists, p. 14. Marchal turned to philosophical and occult studies, associated with Druidic revivalism. With other members of the Breton Federalist Movement, he founded the neo-Pagan \\"Kredenn Geltiek Hollvedel\\" (World Celtic Creed) group, of which he was the first arch-Druid. The group is separate from the Gorsedd of Brittany. Wartime activity and later life During the war, Marchal was not associated with the pro-Nazi activities of Mordrel and his followers. However his group Kredenn Geltiek Hollvedel published a Druidic journal, Nemeton, one of the goals of which was to denounce Catholic influence in Brittany in the name of a supposed Aryan (Indo-European) cultural fraternity which bound a Nordic \\"New Europe\\" to the Celtic fatherland in Germany. Following the Liberation of France he suffered from the association of Breton nationalism with collaborationism. He left Brittany to live in Paris, where he worked installing gas. He continued to contribute to some journals, such as Marius Lepage's Le Symbolisme. He died in poverty in 1963 in the commonroom of the Lariboisi√®re hospital. A street of the district of Poulti√®re in the North-East of Vitr√© has been named after him. Morvan Marchal was buried in Paris in 1963 and re-buried in the family grave in Ch√¢teaugiron, near Rennes in Brittany on 24 January 1997. References Bibliography The Breton movement.

In 1999, Dick became editor-in-chief for the Paris-based international literature and arts review Upstairs at Duroc (issues 2-6). At this time, Dick met American poet and translator Michelle Noteboom (author of Edging, Cracked Slab Books, 2005). George Vance, Michelle Noteboom, current Upstairs at Duroc editor Barbara Beck and Jennifer K Dick formed a four-voice poetry performance group called \\"Quadriphonics\\" which drew a full house at each of its events. In 2005, Dick and Noteboom co-founded IVY Writers Paris series for bilingual readings in Paris. Ivy Writers promotes exchange between authors from France and primarily the USA with monthly readings for the public. These performances bring together prominent poets from various countries who work primarily in an experimental vein of writing. In spring 2016 Ivy Writers Paris acquired association 1901 status with the intention of eventually publishing a bilingual anthology of work by Ivy Writers Paris authors. As an extension of the community writing activities in Paris, Jennifer K Dick has guest edited Ivy Writers Paris sections for Paris Lit Up Magazine, and became in 2009 a poetry editor for the Amsterdam-based review Versal Literary Journal.

The exact nature of a cyberocracy is largely speculative as currently there have been no cyberocratic governments, however, a growing number prototype cybercratic elements can currently be found in many developed nations. Cyberocracy theory is largely the work of David Ronfeldt, who published several papers on the theory. Some sources equate cyberocracy with algorithmic governance, although algorithms are not the only means of processing information. Overview Cyberocracy, from the roots \\"cyber-\\" and \\"-cracy,\\" signifies rule by way of information, especially when using interconnected computer networks. The concept involves information and its control as the source of power and is viewed as the next stage of the political evolution. The fundamental feature of a cyberocracy would be the rapid transmission of relevant information from the source of a problem to the people in a position able to fix said problem, most likely via a system of interconnected computer networks and automated information sorting software, with human decision makers only being called into use in the case of unusual problems, problem trends, or through an appeal process pursued by an individual. Cyberocracy is the functional antithesis of traditional bureaucracies which sometimes notoriously suffer from fiefdomism, slowness, and a list of other unfortunate qualities. A bureaucracy forces and limits the flow of information through defined channels that connect discrete points while cyberocracy transmits volumes of information accessible to many different parties. In addition, bureaucracy deploys brittle practices such as programs and budgets whereas cyberocracy is more adaptive with its focus on management and cultural contexts. Ultimately a cyberocracy may use administrative AIs if not an AI as head of state forming a machine rule government. According to Ronfeldt and Valda, it is still too early to determine the exact form of cyberocracy but that it could lead to new forms of the traditional systems of governance such as democracy, totalitarianism, and hybrid governments. Some noted that cyberocracy is still speculative since there is currently no existing cybercratic government, although it is acknowledged that some of its components are already adopted by governments in a number of developed countries. Examples While the outcome or the results of cyberocracy is still challenging to identify, there are those who cite that it will lead to new forms of governmental and political systems, particularly amid the emergence of new sensory apparatuses, networked society, and modes of networked governance. There are, however, specific examples that could demonstrate this futuristic government. The Stasi of East Germany could be considered a prototype cybercratic organization. The Stasi collected files on six million people, or a little over a third of East Germany's total population, but their lack of computers to sort through the files was causing them to choke on their own file system, thus reducing their effective use of information. A cybercratic government would need to quickly and effectively manage the file of the entirety of the nation's people, as well as any relevant foreigners. The no fly list is an example of a prototype cybercratic element. Its substantial false positive ratio is its primary failure of effectiveness. The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and Internet forums are also examples of cybercratic society.

Griffith, based on Helen Hunt Jackson's 1884 novel Ramona. Through a love story, the early silent short explores racial injustice to Native Americans and stars Mary Pickford and Henry B. Walthall. A copy of the print survives in the Library of Congress film archive. The film was remade in 1928 (dir. Edwin Carewe) with Dolores del R√≠o and 1936 (dir. Henry King) with Loretta Young. Plot Ramona chronicles the romance between Ramona (Mary Pickford), a Spanish orphan from the prestigious Moreno family, and Alessandro (Henry B. Walthall), an Indian who appears on her family's ranch one day. Ramona's foster mother's son Felipe (Francis J. Grandon) proclaims his love for Ramona, but she rejects him because she has fallen for Alessandro. They fall deeply in love, yet their desire to wed is denied by Ramona's foster mother, who reacts by exiling Alessandro from her ranch. He returns to his village, only to find that it has been demolished by white men. Meanwhile, Ramona is informed that she also has \\"Indian blood\\", which leads her to abandon everything she has to be with Alessandro. They marry, and live among the wreckage of Alessandro's devastated village. They have a child together and live at peace until the white men come to force them from their home as they claim the land. Their baby perishes, which adds to Alessandro's mental deterioration. Alessandro is then killed by the white men. A devastated Ramona then returns with Felipe back to her family back on the ranch. Production Advertisements for the film emphasized that it was made \\"by arrangement with Little, Brown, & Company,\\" the publishers of Jackson's novel. The film was shot on location in Ventura County, California, \\"at identical locations wherein Mrs. Jackson placed her characters.\\" When D.W. Griffith directed Ramona, the Biograph production company had fallen into hard times. Still based in New York to rival the now broken up Edison Company, Biograph needed a fresh face. Griffith joined the company in 1908 as a writer and actor. Soon, however, the head director of the company, Wallace McCutcheon, fell ill and his son had little success with taking over for him. This led Grifith to become the principal director for the company, and the only director for films made at Biograph between June 1908 and December 1909.https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_3465_300062291.pdf During these few months, Griffith turned out an exceptional amount of films, with estimates of one 12 minute and one 16 long minute piece per week. The company actually began its venture out West to Hollywood thanks to Griffith's work on Ramona because he wanted to film on location in Ventura, California. Longtime friend and colleague of Griffith's Billy Bitzer worked as the cinematographer for the film. Bitzer was hired originally as an electrician for the Biograph company, but his love of cameras pushed him to become one of cinema's most inventive pioneers. He experimented with photography, especially lighting and close-up shots. The Griffith and Bitzer duo formed shortly after Griffith directed his first film, The Adventures of Dollie and continued after both men left the Biograph production company in 1913. Bitzer's experimental nature is beautifully showcased in the film's sweeping landscape shots of the California mountains and distinct editing techniques like cross-cutting.

The idiom literally tells the listener that if they don't wish to follow the speaker's demands they will have to leave, specifically, go take the highway out of town, otherwise, if they choose to stay, they will be required to follow the speaker's demands. The idiom may sometimes be seen with other pronouns, for example, her way or the highway.

Varney's role is radically different from the humorous Ernest P. Worrell character for which he was best known. Premise Close friends Rae and Carla live an impoverished life in a quiet, depressed Southern town. They pay for their drug and alcohol habits through odd jobs, grifting, and occasional prostitution. Rae has a disturbing encounter with her abusive, alcoholic father at a local bar. The two friends then head out to the countryside to score some cocaine and a brutal cycle of violence ensues.

[it] has the look, texture and loose-jointedness of a semi-improvised home movie. Nothing is really explained. You are just plunked into the middle of this infinitely sullen slice of life. It isn't long before the characters' boredom and accumulated hostility begin to seep into you. But beyond an appalled sense of pity, it is impossible to feel much for them. You just want to get out of there as quickly as possible.\\" Ken Fox of TV Guide viewed it as both \\"grueling\\" and admirable: \\"The film attains the dirty, hyperrealism of a reality based cop show, but with a surprising touch of quiet compassion. ...

A native of Kentucky, Hatter played college baseball for Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College in 1928 and 1929. He signed with the Louisville Colonels in October 1929 and spent five years playing in the minor leagues, including four seasons with the Colonels. In September 1934, he was purchased by the Detroit Tigers. He played for the Tigers during portions of the 1935 and 1937 seasons, compiling a 1-0 record and 8.44 earned run average (ERA) in 11 major league games. Hatter concluded his playing career with the Toledo Mud Hens in 1937. He was plagued by alcohol and behavioral problems and by a 1936 nervous breakdown. He died in October 1937 at age 28 after being discovered unconscious in the back seat of his father's car. Newspapers attributed Hatter's death to a heart attack, though teammate Marv Owen attributed it to alcohol. Early years Hatter was born in Poplar Hills, Kentucky, in 1908. He began pitching in the seventh grade in Liberty, Kentucky. He also pitched for Middleburg High School in Middleburg, Kentucky. He once struck out 20 of 21 batters, and caught a pop fly for the other out, in a seven-inning game against Bradfordsville. Eastern Kentucky Hatter attended Eastern Kentucky State Teachers College. He played for the Eastern Kentucky baseball team in 1928 and 1929. In an April 1928 game, he struck out 20 of a possible 24 batters against Georgetown College. He later struck out 23 batters, striking out three batters in five innings, against Transylvania. On April 22, 1929, he threw a no-hitter, the first in school history, against Kentucky Wesleyan. Five days later, he struck out 14 batters and threw a four- hit shutout against the University of Louisville Cardinals. The Courier- Journal reported: \\"Hatter's control featured the game and he was the master of the situation at all times.\\" During the 1929 season, Hatter won 27 of 29 games and averaged 14 strikeouts per game. His two losses were one-run decisions, including a 1-0 loss to Louisville. Professional baseball =Minor leagues (1930-1934)= After Eastern Kentucky concluded its 1929 season, Hatter pitched for an independent team in Somerset, Kentucky, threw a no-hitter against a Chattanooga team, and compiled a 19-0 record in 19 games pitched. In August 1929, the Louisville Colonels of the American Association began pursuing Hatter. After an initial try-out, the Colonels offered Hatter a contract, but he refused to sign in a disagreement over the amount of his signing bonus. Hatter ultimately signed a contract with Colonels on October 29, 1929, in exchange for a signing bonus of $1,000. In April 1930, the Colonels sent Hatter to Dayton Aviators of the Class B Central League. In his first professional game, on April 29, 1930, Hatter pitched \\"masterful ball\\" for five innings and struck out nine batters, allowed two hits and no earned runs, walked five batters, and was reportedly wild but \\"just wild enough to be effective.\\" On September 14, 1930, Hatter pitched a no-hitter and struck out 23 batters in a 3-0 victory over Livingston. He appeared in 40 games for Dayton in 1930, compiling a 12-15 record with 217 strikeouts and a 5.14 earned run average (ERA) in 247 innings pitched. In 1931, Hatter was elevated to the Class AA Colonels. He appeared in 31 games and compiled an 11-12 record with a 4.66 ERA. He remained with the Colonels for four years from 1931 to 1934. In 1934, he compiled an 8-12 record and struck out 170 batters with 3.39 ERA in 178 innings pitched. =Detroit Tigers (1935 season)= On September 10, 1934, the Colonels sold Hatter to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Rip Sewell. The deal allowed Hatter to remain with Louisville through the remainder of the 1934 season and provided that the Tigers would also pay Louisville $15,000 if Hatter remained with the Tigers after June 15, 1935. Hatter was known as the \\"Mad\\" Hatter while with Detroit. Hatter made his major league debut on April 23, 1935, entering the game in the seventh inning as a relief pitcher and pitching two innings against the Chicago White Sox. In late April, Detroit manager Mickey Cochrane said: \\"Hatter has a good fastball and an exceptional curve. He is inclined to be wild. Better control will make him a valuable pitcher. He has a good disposition . . .\\" On July 13, 1935, Hatter had a disastrous outing against the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. Pitching in relief, he gave up 19 hits, five walks, and 11 runs in an 18-5 loss. Four days later, he was sent to the Milwaukee Brewers. At the time of Hatter's demotion, Charles P. Ward wrote in the Detroit Free Press: \\"The silent southpaw looked like a big league pitcher during the spring training season but has not looked so good since the American League season opened. His doom was sealed when he relieved Elden Auker in the opening game of the series in Philadelphia and was batted about like a batting practice pitcher of the first order.\\" During his three months with the Tigers during the 1935 season, Hatter appeared eight games, two as a starter, pitching 33-1/3 innings with no decisions and a 7.56 ERA. =Milwaukee Brewers (1935-1936)= After being sent to the Brewers in July 1935, Hatter performed well. He compiled a 7-3 record and 2.88 ERA in 14 games for the Brewers in 1935. In 1936, he appeared in 38 games for the Brewers, 30 as a starter, led the American Association with 16 wins, and compiled a 16-6 record with a 4.52 ERA. At the end of the 1936 season, Hatter reportedly suffered a \\"nervous breakdown\\" and failed to appear at the ball park for the opening game of the 1936 Little World Series. Teammates discovered him in a hotel where he was reported to be ill. =Detroit Tigers (1937)= In March 1937, and after two strong seasons with Milwaukee, Hatter was returned to the Tigers for spring training. He made the Tigers opening day roster and appeared in three games during the 1937 season. He compiled a 1-0 record and 11.57 ERA in 9-1/3 inning pitched. He appeared in his final major league game on May 10, 1937. On May 15, 1937, he was released on option by the Tigers to the Toledo Mud Hens. At the time, Charles P. Ward of the Detroit Free Press wrote: > \\"Hatter has been a disappointment this year just as he has been on two > previous occasions. He has everything required of a major league hurler but > control and Cochrane blames his lack of control on tension.\\" In addition to Cochrane's comment attributing Hatter's problems to \\"tension\\", other accounts report that Hatter continued to suffer from relapses following his 1936 nervous breakdown. He reportedly lacked confidence and would become upset the day before he was scheduled to pitch. Teammate Marv Owen later gave another account as to the reason for Hatter's release. According to Owen, Hatter failed to show up at the ballpark for a couple days, claiming to be sick. Owen asked the team doctor to check on Hatter, and the doctor discovered two glasses of whisky in a bureau drawer in Hatter's room and concluded that Hatter was drunk. After manager Mickey Cochrane was told of the incident, Cochrane sent Hatter to Toledo. Owen recalled thinking, \\"Holy Almighty, I probably ruined his whole goddamn career.\\" =Toledo Mud Hens (1937)= After being sent to Toledo in May 1937, Hatter's life spiraled downward. He was suspended for 30 days for breaking training rules. On July 6, he was hospitalized in Toledo after collapsing unconscious in the back of at taxi. Hatter claimed at the time that he had taken capsules for a headache. A later account reported that he \\"took an overdose of a sleeping potion\\" while returning to his hotel. On August 20, 1937, Hatter retired the first 16 batters and pitched a two-hit victory over the Minneapolis Millers. On the night of his two-hit victory, Hatter disappeared. After an absence of five days, he showed up at a Toledo hotel where he was reported to be disturbing guests. Team officials were summoned and came to the scene. When they were unable to control Hatter, they consented to his arrest. He was reportedly taken to a sanitarium and released the next day into the custody of his brother. On September 8, 1937, Hatter returned to the Mud Hens and pitched for a 4-3 victory over the Indianapolis Indians. Three days later, he allowed six runs and lacked control in a game against the Louisville Colonels. In all, Hatter appeared in nine games for the Mud Hens in 1937, six as a starter, and compiled a 3-0 record with a 5.22 ERA. Death A newspaper account published on September 29, 1937, reported the Mud Hens had offered to give Hatter \\"the best of medical attention during the coming winter to bring him back to tip- top physical condition\\", and that the Mud Hens had assigned a \\"chaperon\\" to Hatter, but the chaperon had not kept him in shape to pitch. The account further opined that Hatter had blown two shots at the majors due to his behavior and was \\"of little use to the Mudhens during the past campaign because of his wayward acts.\\" Less than three weeks later, on October 17, 1937, Hatter died near Yosemite, Kentucky, at age 29. Accounts as to the cause of Hatter's death are in conflict. The Courier-Journal in Louisville reported that he suffered from a stomach ailment, traveled with his father to Danville, Kentucky, and died of a heart attack in the back seat of his father's automobile while returning to his home in Yosemite. According to that report, Hatter's father believed Hatter was sleeping in the back seat but was unable to revive him after arriving home. The coroner's death certificate reported: \\"Died suddenly before I arrived -- Probably Heart Disease.\\" Teammate Marv Owen recalled events differently. Interviewed in the 1980s, Owen reported on Hatter's death this way: \\"He went home that winter and they found him dead in the back of his father's car. From booze.\\"Bak, Cobb Would Have Caught It (1991), p. 239.

It was associated with Bungo Province in modern-day ≈åita Prefecture on the island of Kyushu. In the han system, Mori was a political and economic abstraction based on periodic cadastral surveys and projected agricultural yields.Mass, Jeffrey P. and William B. Hauser. (1987). The Bakufu in Japanese History, p. 150. In other words, the domain was defined in terms of kokudaka, not land area.Elison, George and Bardwell L. Smith (1987). Warlords, Artists, & Commoners: Japan in the Sixteenth Century, p. 18. This was different from the feudalism of the West. History The Kurushima family, which ruled Mori during the Edo period, were the descendants of the Kurushima who formed part of the Murakami pirates of the Inland Sea, during the Sengoku period. Kurushima Nagachika (later called Yasuchika) held 14,000 koku of territory at Kijima in Iyo Province. In 1600, he sided with the western army; however, as his wife's uncle was Fukushima Masanori, Honda Masanobu was able to arrange for a special disposition allowing Nagachika's domain and family to remain unmolested. The family was moved to the Mori region of Bungo Province in 1601, and granted the same 14,000 koku of landholding. The Kurushima family remained as lords of Mori until the Meiji Restoration. During the Boshin War they supported the Kyoto government, and were assigned to guard the abandoned daikansho at Hita (Êó•Áî∞). The domain was abolished in 1871, first becoming Mori Prefecture, before being absorbed into ≈åita Prefecture, where it remains today. In 1884, the Mori family became shishaku (Â≠êÁàµ, viscounts) in the new kazoku nobility system. The fairy-tale writer Kurushima Takehiko is a descendant of the Kurushima daimy≈ç family.

Named after Mount Katsuragi,Silverstone, p. 332 in Nara Prefecture, and completed late in the war; she never embarked her complement of aircraft and spent the war in Japanese waters. The ship was badly damaged in a July 1945 airstrike by American carrier aircraft on Kure Naval Base. Repaired after the end of the war, Katsuragi was then used as a repatriation transport for a number of months, bringing Japanese soldiers and civilians back to Japan from overseas locations. She was scrapped in Japan beginning in late 1946. Design and description The last purpose-built Japanese carrier construction during World War II was a group of vessels based on an improved design, but with individual units differing in detail reflecting the changing circumstances as the conflict in the Pacific approached its conclusion. Katsuragi was ordered 25 June 1942, under the provisional name of #5003, as part of the Kai-Maru 5 Program of 1942. This was a massive naval construction program intended to replace losses suffered at the Battle of Midway and focused on aircraft and aircraft carriers. The ship was one of 16 s planned, although only three were completed before the end of the war. Katsuragi in 1944 Katsuragi had the same hull design as .Stille, p. 37 She had a length of overall. She had a beam of and, at deep load, a draft of . She displaced at deep load. Her crew consisted of 1,576 officers and men. When acting as a flagship she had a total of 1,600 crewmembers.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 118‚Äì19 A shortage of turbines and boilers led to machinery of the same type as that used in the being used in Katsuragi. These consisted of four geared steam turbine sets with a total of driving four shafts, each fitted with a propeller. Steam was provided by eight Kampon Type B water-tube boilers with a working pressure of at . The ship had a designed speed of , but during sea trials on 12 October 1944, she reached at the light displacement of . Katsuragi carried of fuel oil although no data on her range is known. She had two funnels on the starboard side, each angled below horizontal. They were fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 115, 117, 119 =Flight deck arrangements= Katsuragis flight deck was long and had a maximum width of . A small island was mounted well forward on the starboard side and contained the ship's bridge and air operations control center. It was fitted with a small tripod mast that mounted one of the ship's radar antennaas. The ship was designed with two superimposed hangars that were served by two aircraft elevators, each ; the center elevator as used in Hiry≈´ was deleted to simplify construction and reduce stress in the hull. The elevators had a maximum capacity of and took 19 seconds to go from the lower hangar to the flight deck. Katsuragi was fitted with hydraulically operated Type 3 arresting gear with nine cables. She also mounted three Type 3 crash barricades. No aircraft catapult was fitted. The ship mounted a retractable crane on the starboard side of the flight deck, just aft of the rear elevator.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 110‚Äì12, 118 The ship's air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, plus three in storage, 27 Aichi D3A Val dive bombers, plus three in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\" torpedo bombers (plus two in crates). Katsuragis hangars could not accommodate so many aircraft so eleven planes were planned to be permanently carried on the flight deck. In 1943 the air group was revised to consist of 18 Mitsubishi A7M \\"Sam\\" fighters (+2 in storage), 27 Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy\\" dive bombers and six Nakajima C6N \\"Myrt\\" reconnaissance aircraft. Of these, the C6Ns were intended to be carried on the flight deck. When the ship commissioned in 1944, neither the A7M nor the C6Ns were yet in service, so the air group was reconfigured to consist of 27 Zeros, 12 D4Ys, three of which were to be the reconnaissance version, and nine Nakajima B6N \\"Jill\\" torpedo bombers. By this time, however, the shortage of carrier-qualified aircrew was such that they were ordered to operate from shore bases and Katsuragi never embarked her air group.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 117‚Äì18 Katsuragi carried of aviation gasoline for her aircraft.Lengerer 2010a, p. 154 =Armor, armament and sensors= Katsuragis waterline armored belt was made from New Vickers Non-Cemented armor thick. Her deck armor above the magazines that consisted of of CNC1 armor. The ship's machinery spaces and auxiliary machinery rooms had two layers of Ducol steel, each 25 mm thick, to protect them. Above engine and boiler rooms, the lower deck consisted of 25 mm of CNC2 armor. The deck over the rear auxiliary machinery space was of CNC2 armor while the lower platform deck over the forward auxiliary machinery space consisted of 56 mm of CNC2. The upper hangar deck served as the ship's strength deck and it consisted of five layers of Ducol steel, a total in thickness. Katsuragis aviation gasoline tanks were fore and aft of the auxiliary machinery spaces and were protected by of Ducol steel in two layers while the deck above them consisted of 25 mm of CNC2 armor. The sides, bottom and top of the steering gear compartment consisted of 56 mm of CNC1 armor.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 107, 109, 112‚Äì13, 115 The ship's primary armament consisted of a dozen 40-caliber 12.7 cm Type 89 anti- aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts. Their sponsons were positioned to allow them some measure of cross-deck fire. Katsuragi was also equipped with 22 triple 25 mm Type 96 and thirty single Type 96 AA gun mounts, most on sponsons along the sides of the hull. These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. For defense against submarines, the carrier was fitted with six depth charge throwers and carried between six and ten depth charges for them.Lengerer 2010b, p. 119 Two Type 94 high-angle fire-control directors, one on each side of the ship, were fitted to control the Type 89 guns. Each director mounted a rangefinder. Six Type 95 directors controlled the 25 mm guns and the 12 cm rocket launchers. Early warning was provided by two Type 2, Mark 2, Model 1 air search radars. One of these was mounted on the top of the island while the other retracted into the port side of the flight deck, between the two elevators. In addition, Katsuragi had two smaller Type 3, Mark 1, Model 3 air search radars, one mounted on the tripod mast on the island and the other on the aft starboard retractable radio mast. She also had two radar detectors: a metric Type E-27 and a centimetric Model 3 system. The ship had a Type 93 sonar and two Type 0 hydrophones with which to search for submarines. Before the end of the war, a Type 2, Mark 2, Model 4 surface fire-control radar was installed. In addition, a Type 14 early warning radar, ordinarily land-based, was mounted for trials aboard ship.Lengerer 2010b, pp. 119‚Äì20 Service Katsuragis upper hangar deck after an American bomb detonated therein. Note the two radar antennas visible through the hole in the flight deck. Katsuragis keel was laid down by the Kure Naval Arsenal in Kure, Hiroshima, on 8 December 1942. She was launched on 19 January 1944 and completed on 15 October 1944.Jentschura, Jung and Mickel, p. 56 The ship was transferred among a number of ports on the Inland Sea until she arrived in Kure on 15 February 1945 and she was ordered to be camouflaged. Her flight deck was disguised with fake trees, houses and roads; however, her anti- aircraft batteries remained fully manned. Her intended air group, Air Group 601, was committed to the Battle of Iwo Jima about that same time. On 19 March, the ship was attacked by aircraft from Task Force 58 and lightly damaged by several rocket hits; one man was killed and three wounded in the attack. Five days later, the ship was semi-permanently moored at the island of Mitsukojima in Kure harbor and extensively camouflaged. On 20 April, Captain Toshio Miyazaki was appointed commanding officer of Katsuragi. Aircraft from USN Task Force 38 attacked the ship on 24 July as part of a major raid on Kure and the Inland Sea, but she was only hit once. A bomb struck one of the ship's anti-aircraft mounts on the port side. Thirteen men were killed and five wounded, but the bomb did little other damage. A second raid on 28 July did far more damage to the ship as a bomb penetrated the flight deck and detonated in the upper hangar, between the elevators. The explosion blew out a section of the port hangar wall and the walls of the upper hangar deck were bulged and perforated multiple times. The flight deck between the elevators was bulged up and buckled; one section of the flight deck was blown out and flung over to starboard to land across the funnels. Only 13 men were killed (including her executive officer) and another 12 men were wounded during the attack.Tully Katsuragi survived the war without sustaining any further damage, and was designated as a Special Transfer Ship on 2 October and then assigned to repatriation duty on 13 October after the necessary repairs were made. Her crew at this time consisted only of 12 officers, one warrant officer, and 40 petty officers and crewmen, with Captain Miyazaki still in command. The damage from the July attack was only repaired enough to allow the hangar deck to house some 5,000 returning soldiers and civilians and the ship began her first voyage outside Japanese waters on 19 December. On this first voyage, she called upon Minamidaitojima, Rabaul and Australia. Upon her return, further repairs were necessary to make her rain-tight. These were completed by 15 January 1946 and she made a number of trips in early 1946 to bring back Japanese nationals. before being placed on standby in April. Katsuragi was stricken from the Navy List on 15 November and transferred to the Home Ministry for disposal five days later. Scrapping of the ship began on 22 December 1946 at the Hitachi Zosen facility in Osaka-Sakurajima and was completed on 30 November 1947.Lengerer 2010b, p. 121 Notes Footnotes References   External links Unry≈´-class aircraft carriers Ships built in Japan 1943 ships World War II aircraft carriers of Japan ","title":"Japanese aircraft carrier Katsuragi"},{"id":"13295886","text":"WFNQ (106.3 FM; \\"Frank FM\\") is a radio station in Nashua, New Hampshire, serving the Manchester, New Hampshire area with a classic hits radio format.

Its somber coloration is typical of Matisse's works executed between the end of 1901 and the end of 1903, a period of personal difficulties for the artist. This episode has been called Matisse's Dark Period.Spurling, p. 33 The work is an oil painting on paper mounted on canvas and it measures 72.5 √ó 54.5 cm (28¬Ω √ó 21¬Ω in). It is in the Albright‚ÄìKnox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York. Background Between 1896 and 1901, Matisse's painting had progressed from the subdued tones of his earliest works to an intense colorism that prefigured the Fauvism to come. In 1896 and 1897 he had traveled to Brittany, where the Australian painter John Russell encouraged him to paint en plein air. Through Russell he met Camille Pissarro, whose influence was decisive in making a colorist of Matisse.UCLA Art Council 1966, pp. 9‚Äì10. In 1898 he traveled to London, where he studied the works of J. M. W. Turner; then, after a year spent in Corsica and Toulouse, he returned to Paris, where the startling boldness of his work was admired by other young artists.UCLA Art Council 1966, p. 10 His paintings found few buyers, however, and his wife, Am√©lie, had to open a dress shop to support their household. In May 1902 a major financial scandal, the Humbert Affair, unexpectedly ensnared Am√©lie's family. Her mother (who was the Humbert family's housekeeper) and father became scapegoats in the scandal; as a result, Matisse was forced to spend much of his time during the next year dealing with lawyers and journalists. His studio was searched by detectives, and his wife's family was menaced by angry mobs of fraud victims. According to art historian Hilary Spurling, \\"their public exposure, followed by the arrest of his father-in-law, left Matisse as the sole breadwinner for an extended family of seven. This is why he switched to painting canvases that were at least potentially saleable\\". Inspired by Rodin and Barye, Matisse struggled to master volume in sculpture as well as in painting. He darkened his palette, with the results seen in the present work, and in such paintings as Carmelina (1903, in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston).

It is the boundary between the Mainland and the North Isles and it contains many small islands. Sullom Voe, on the shores of which is a substantial oil terminal, is an arm of Yell Sound. The ferry to the North Isles crosses the sound, which can experience strong tides and adverse weather conditions. There are numerous shipwreck sites and several lighthouses to guide shipping. Yell Sound is mentioned briefly in the medieval Orkneyinga saga and during the 19th century there was a short flourishing of the kelp industry. Commercial fishing has long been a mainstay of the local economy and part of the sound is as Special Area of Conservation set up to protect the local wildlife. Early history The Old Norse name was Alasund although the original meaning of the name is not clear.Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) Orkneyinga Saga. Translated by J√≥n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). \\"Alasund\\" is simply a Norse version of \\"Yell Sound\\" There are various possible derivations of the island's name. It may originally have been a Pictish name of unknown meaning. The Proto-Norse was Jala or Jela which may have meant \\"white island\\" referring to the beaches. The Old Norse gjall signifying \\"barren\\" may be involved. See Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 467. Yell Sound is mentioned briefly in the Orkneyinga saga: :\\"Earl R√∂gnvald... and the chiefs S√∂lmond and J√≥n with him... had a fine body of troops, thought not too numerous, and five or six ships. They arrived at Hjaltland (Shetland) about the middle of Summer, but heard nothing of Fr√°kork. Strong and contrary winds sprung up, and they brought their ships to Alasund (Yell Sound), and went a-feasting over the country.\\" Islands The north western approaches to the sound are guarded by a series of small islands north of the Point of Fethland, which is the northernmost land of Northmavine on the Shetland Mainland. The largest of these islands is Gruney and a small archipelago of reefs and skerries lies north of there known as the Ramna Stacks including (from north to south) Gaut Skerries, Outer Stack, Scordar, Turla, Hyter, Ofoora, Fladda, Flae-ass, and Barlcudda. Samphrey and the view northwards towards Bigga and Yell Yell itself lies east of the sound. South of the headland of Nev of Stuis on Yell there are various islands in the sound including Sweinna Stack, Holm of West Sandwick, Muckle Holm, and Little Holm. Yell Sound narrows between Mio Ness on the Mainland and south Yell. The islands of Bigga, Brother Isle, Lamba, Orfasay, Little Roe, Samphrey and Uynarey lie in this part of the channel. South of Firth Ness the sound widens and Fish Holm, Linga, Setter Holm, Sinna Skerry, and Wether Holm are found here. The eastern approaches lie between Heoga Ness on Yell and Lunna Ness on the Mainland. Gold Skerry, Green Holm and Neapback Skerries lie off the former and Lunna Holm and Sand Skerry north of the latter. Inlets The harbour of Burravoe There are also numerous large bays and inlets that lead off Yell Sound. The long Whale Firth on Yell enters the sound at Nev of Stuis. Southladie Voe is some miles south on the western Yell shore to the south of West Sandwick. The large bay of Hamna Voe is at the south end of Yell north of Orfasay island. The much smaller Burra Voe lies just to the east near the village of Burravoe. The village of North Roe is on the shores of a second Burra Voe on the north Mainland side of the sound. South of there is the larger Colla Firth, separated from Quey Firth by Ness of Queyfirth. Next are Ollaberry Bay, Gluss Voe and Sullom Voe, which is a major inlet and at the longest of Shetland's many voes (Old Norse: \\"bay\\"). It contains the Sullom Voe Terminal operated by BP plc and itself has numerous bays and inlets. Sullom Voe terminates at the extraordinary Mavis Grind, a narrow isthmus separating the North Sea from the Atlantic Ocean.\\"Sullom Voe\\" BP. Retrieved 18 January 2009. Further south are Orka Voe, Tofts Voe, Firths Voe, Swinister Voe, Dales Voe, a second Colla Firth, Swining Voe, Lumna Voe and a second and smaller Hamna Voe with an inner bay called Boatsroom Voe. Ferries Map of Yell Sound and the North Isles The ferry from the Mainland to Yell (and then overland on to ferries for Unst and Fetlar) operates between Toft on the Mainland, and Ulsta on Yell, the route being between the island of Samphrey to the east and Bigga to the north. Daggri and Dagalien are roll-on-roll-off ferries that have been operated since 2004 by Shetland Islands Council. Built in Gda≈Ñsk, they are each long, and are capable of carrying up to 95 passengers and 31 cars or 4 trucks. These boats have a registered tonnage in excess of six times that of the ships they replaced on the route and their increased size has significantly improved transport to the northern isles. The crossing takes about 20 minutes and the services operate at half-hourly intervals.\\"Yell Sound Ferry\\" Undiscovered Scotland. Retrieved 21 January 2009. The first regular ferry to the North Isles was the Janet, which began operating from Lerwick in 1839. The steamer Chieftain's Bride was introduced to this route in 1868 and the SS Lady Ambrosine in 1876. The Earl of Zetland, an iron screw steamer of 253 tons, began a twice weekly Lerwick to Unst service with weekly visits to Out Skerries and the ports of Yell Sound. Originally the service called at numerous small villages in the sound, but after 1932 the stopping- off points were reduced in number due to competition. The ferry twice survived attacks by enemy aircraft during World War 2. A second and larger Earl of Zetland was brought into service after 1945. Weighing 548 tons and with a length of , the ship was popular with summer visitors but cargo was handled by a single derrick and a government subsidy of ¬£100,000 per annum was required to support the operation.Nicholson (1972) pp. 102, 105.The second \\"Earl of Zetland\\" saw brief service on the ferry route in 1939 but was almost immediately requisitioned for the war effort. Initially, passengers were offered a choice of \\"saloon\\" or \\"second class\\" fares. See Nicholson (1972) p. 105. Shipwrecks Ferry passing Samphrey in 2007 In addition to the weather conditions, sailing vessels have to contend with strong currents and numerous shipwrecks and hazardous incidents have occurred in and around the sound.NAFC (2008) Maps 27, 34. In 1832 a fishing boat from Samphrey was caught out in a storm and blown all the way to Norway. The crew returned safely to Shetland the following spring to the relief of their families, who had presumed them drowned.Haswell-Smith (2004) pp. 462‚Äì63. The 18 ton wooden fishing smack Ellen was wrecked on the Rumble Rock, (between Samphrey and Orfasay) on 27 April 1896. In March 1904 the trawler Ibis was wrecked at the same location during a snowstorm, the crew being rescued by the trawler Sunbeam. In June 1914 the steamer Robert Lea was grounded on Stoura Baa at the north end of Brother Isle en route from Colla Firth to Liverpool also without loss of life. In 1992 the wreck was located in of water. The fishing boat Morning Star sank approximately north west of Muckle Holm lighthouse whilst under tow after a fire broke out in the engine room. In 1983, the Royal Navy cleared ordnance from Little Holm, and their bomb disposal team discovered an unrecorded shipwreck nearby. Its identity is still unknown.\\"Unidentified Shipwrecks\\" Shetlopedia.com Retrieved 23 January 2009.\\"Little Holm (Yell Sound)\\" Shetlopedia.com Retrieved 23 January 2009.By contrast, Haswell-Smith (2004) p. 466 states that the wreck of the \\"SS Robert Lee\\" lies near Lamba. There are no protected shipwrecks in the sound.NAFC (2008) Map 11. Lighthouses There are several lights operated by the Northern Lighthouse Board guiding shipping in the sound. To the north Bagi Stack Lighthouse on Yell to the east, and Gruney and Point of Fethaland to the west are the outer lights. To the south, the outermost light is at Lunna Holm Lighthouse. Within the sound from north to south the lights are Muckle Holm Lighthouse, Little Holm Lighthouse, Lamba South Lighthouse, Outer Skerry Lighthouse, Brother Isle Lighthouse, Ness of Sound Lighthouse, Rumble Rock Lighthouse (since 2001) and Firths Voe Lighthouse on the Mainland.\\"Scotland\\" Amateur Radio Lighthouse Society.

Commercial activities Sullom Voe oil terminal at dusk The northern part of the sound provides fishing grounds for haddock, herring and crabs. The inner sound has commercial scallop beds and various fish and shellfish farms.NAFC (2008) Maps 1-4. The profusion of seaweeds including wrack (Fucus serratus) and tangle (Laminaria digitata) was briefly exploited for commercial purposes. Between 1870 and the end of the nineteenth century several hundred tons of kelp used in the production of iodine and bromine were exported annually from Unst, Yell and the mainland shores of Yell Sound. The many small fires burning along the shores apparently made a lasting impression on visitors.Nicholson (1972) refers to exports of \\"kelp\\" and \\"little kelp fires\\" indicating that the export was of the ash, not the seaweed. See pp. 160‚Äì61. Away from the beaches, Yell Sound is little used for recreational purposes, possibly due to the relatively high volume of tonnage accessing Sullom Voe.NAFC (2008) Map 6. As a primary navigation channel, the entire sound is under the control of Shetland Islands Council's Ports and Harbours Operations authority and has been identified as a body of water \\"At Risk\\" of not meeting the EU Water Framework Directive.NAFC (2008) Maps 9-10, 28. Wildlife Part of the sound is as Special Area of Conservation (SAC), in part due to the high concentration of otters. The Shetland populations are possibly the densest in Europe and up to 2% of the British population may live in the site. The low-lying peaty coastlines provide easy access to fresh water, extensive algal beds in the marine environment and large numbers of otter holts. There is also a significant population of the common seal with the local colony representing over 1% of the UK population.\\"Yell Sound Coast\\" JNCC. Retrieved 21 January 2009. Sullom Voe is a separate SAC, qualifying due to the numerous large shallow inlets and bays, coastal reefs and lagoons.NAFC (2008) Map 13. There are horse mussel (Modiolus modiolus) beds both within Sullom Voe and on the mainland coast near Colla Firth.NAFC (2008) Map 16a. Ceteceans are regularly sited in the inner sound, especially harbour porpoise, minke whale and killer whale and there are a wide variety of breeding seabirds, divers and ducks including eider.NAFC (2008) Maps 20, 22-24.

A. Mario. He took the E of his assumed name from the initial letter of the pseudonym Ermes under which he wrote for the newspaper Il Ventesimo; the A came from Alessandro, the paper's chief editor; and Mario was the name of its Polish director. Gaeta composed and wrote the lyrics to more than 2,000 works in Italian and Neapolitan. In 1918, he wrote La leggenda del Piave, which at the birth of the Italian Republic was a candidate for the Italian national anthem. His other famous works include Santa Lucia luntana, Balocchi e profumi, Vipera, Rose rosse, and O' Paese d√≤ sole.Bruna Catalano Gaeta (1989) E.A. Mario: Leggenda E Storia, pag.57. Liguori Editore s.r.l Biography The future E. A. Mario was born to a family of modest means in the Vicaria quarter of Pellezzano, Salerno. His father, Michele Gaeta, was a barber and his mother, Maria della Monica, a housewife. The back of his father's barbershop served as the family's cramped living quarters, housing in addition to Gaeta, his mother and father, brother Ciccillo, and sisters Agata and Anna. Three aunts and an uncle occupied two further small rooms. He married Adelina, the daughter of the famous actress Leonilde Gaglianone, after a short three-month engagement. The couple were to have three daughters: Delia, Italia and Bruna. On February 9 1916, he was initiated in the regular Scottish Rite Masonic Lodge Unione e Lavoro in Naples. In Gaeta's youth he admired the performances of the great Neapolitan actor, poet and playwright Eduardo Scarpetta. Gaeta collaborated greatly with the leading Neapolitan publisher, Ferdinand Bideri, who also produced the works of Gabriele d'Annunzio. Gaeta was destined never to become wealthy, forced by his wife's serious illness to sell the rights to all of his songs to a publishing house in Milan, from which he was to receive only a small percentage. He died in 1961 at the age of 77 on 24 June, the name day of his saint. His wife had died some months earlier.

The membership of more than 700 men and women includes professionals in the industry and students aspiring to sports media careers. AWSM was formed in 1987 by four California sportswriters, Nancy Cooney, Susan Fornoff, Michele Himmelberg and Kristin Huckshorn‚Äîto create a strong network and advocacy group for the few women who were working at the time in sports media. Forty people attended AWSM's first annual convention in 1988 in Oakland, California. 15 years prior to the creation of the Association for Women in Sports Media, the Title XI law was put into place. This law stated that discrimination would not be tolerated when it came to access and how women were treated whether playing a sport, or reporting on a sport. AWSM works to promote and increase diversity in sports media through its internship/scholarship program, which has placed about 100 female college students in paid internships since 1990, as well as through mentoring links and career-enhancement initiatives. AWSM annually pays tribute to individuals who have paved the way for women in sports media with the Mary Garber Pioneer Award, and the organization helps those who encounter roadblocks on the trails yet to be blazed.  Studies involving members of the Association for Women in Sports Media  Several studies were conducted, involving members of the Association for Women in Sports Media, such as one conducted by Indiana University students. That study found that majority of the women within the sports field, that were also members of the association felt as though they were treated fairly. The study also concluded that some women still felt as though they were given the short end of the stick when it came to the amount of assignments they received working with male athletes. (Hardin, Marie; Shain, Stacie (2005-12-01). Another survey of 200 women, also members of the Association for Women in Sports Media was conducted. This survey found that more women working in the sports media field, resulted in women‚Äôs sports being broadcast more frequently. The study also concluded that women have grown accustom to males dominating the field, which has helped women accept their role, and strive to do the same work as men. (Smucker, Michael K.; Whisenant, Warren A.; Pedersen, Paul M. (2003-10-01)) 70 additional members of the Association for Women in Sports Media was also conducted, finding the women felt as though the pay, assignments given, and treatment by the administration was fair, and they were unable to identify any gaps within the companies they worked for, primarily newspapers.

She eschews digital manipulation, instead favoring a conventional darkroom process for developing stills. She does not crop or digitally manipulate her photographs. Her paintings, on the other hand, are made by combining negatives in photoshop to make a whole new image. This new image is then turned into paintings created through the layering of enamel paint on aluminum. Minter and her assistants work directly from this newly created digital image.

Minter later moved to New York City in 1976, after earning a master of fine arts degree at Syracuse University, and began collaborating with the German expressionist painter Christof Kohlhofer. Through the 1980s, she explored Pop- derived pictures often incorporating sexuality, setting the tone for many of her works. Although their joint work gained critical acclaim, when their 1984 and 1986 shows at the Gracie Mansion gallery were not commercially successful, Kohlhofer and Minter parted ways.Mallory Curley, A Cookie Mueller Encyclopedia, pp. 265-266 Minter then began to incorporate imagery borrowed from advertising and the porn industry into her art. In 1989, Minter created a series of works based on images from hardcore pornography, based on her belief that nobody has politically correct fantasies. Her goal was to create sexual imagery for women to enjoy. She reclaimed images from a male-dominated and often abusive industry, asking audiences whether the meaning was changed when the image was used by a woman. In 1990, Minter produced her first video, 100 Food Porn, shot and directed by NY documentary filmmaker Ted Haimes. This video was used as a television advertisement to promote her exhibition at the Simon Watson Gallery in New York. Minter used the gallery's art advertising budget to buy 30 second slots on Late Night with David Letterman in lieu of traditional print advertising, becoming the first artist to advertise an artists' exhibition on late night television. Through the 1990s she refined her works. While still having pornographic undertones, they began to exude a sense of glamour and high-fashion.

It was established under the name Yugoslav Radical Peasants' Democracy as the official party of the state under King Alexander. History On 6 January 1929, the king dissolved the Parliament and abolished the constitution, and banning all political parties. This became known as the 6 January Dictatorship. In 1931, a new constitution was put into place, which provided for limited democracy. However, most of the political power remained in the hands of the King and the government, appointed by him. =1930s= In May 1932, the Yugoslav Radical Peasants' Democracy was established to support Alexander's government, under the leadership of Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá. It was formed mostly by dissident members of the Democratic Party and the People's Radical Party (NRS), as well as the Slovenian section of the Independent Democratic Party (SDS) and the right wing of the Slovene Peasant Party (SKS). Individual members from other parties, and from nationalist organizations like ORJUNA also joined. In June 1933, it was renamed to Yugoslav National Party, and adopted a program stressing the unity of the Yugoslav Nation, centralized government and secularism. =Governing party= From 1932 to 1935, the party was the governing party of Yugoslavia. Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Milan Sr≈°kiƒá and Nikola Uzunoviƒá were the country's prime ministers while the party was in power. After King Alexander was assassinated in 1934, the party remained in power. However, the economic and political instability of the country, and fierce opposition from Croatia challenged the party's power. Elections were called in 1935; although they were not free, the JNS suffered a serious setback.Dieter Nohlen, Dolf Sternberger, Bernhard Vogel, Klaus Landfried (1969) Die Wahl der Parlamente und andere Staatsorgane, Walter de Gruyter, p784 =Reformed party= A former member of the Yugoslav National Party Milan Stojadinoviƒá formed a successor party, called Yugoslav Radical Union (JRZ), based on a more conservative political alliance, which included the Yugoslav Muslim Organization (JMO) and Slovene People's Party (SLS).

It is located in Belgrade's municipality of Zemun.  Location  Zemunski Kej, as its name suggests (Zemun's quay), is located alongside the right bank of the Danube. The promenade itself (officially named Kej Osloboƒëenja, Quay of Liberation) begins below the Gardo≈° hill, at the square of Veliki Trg and after continues into the municipality of New Belgrade. On the west it borders the neighborhoods of Donji Grad and Retenzija and on the south the neighborhood of U≈°ƒáe in New Belgrade. To the east, in the Danube, is the Great War Island and its beach Lido.  Quay  = Promenade = Modern area of Zemun's Donji Grad was regularly flooded by the Danube. After massive 1876 floods, local authorities began the construction of the stony levee along the Danube's bank. Levee, a kilometer long, was finished in 1889. When hydroelectrical plant ƒêerdap I began to fill its reservoir in the late 1960s, due to the backwater of the Danube, underground waters in Zemun and New Belegrade got elevated and the cellars of the buildings got flooded. To prevent this, the high embankment with the promenade was built in 1967 so the Danube rarely flooded the quay (most notably in 1981). In September 2007 reconstruction of the quay's long section began including further elevation of the embankment, widening of the pedestrian path and construction another one on separate level, completion of the cycling path, etc. Works, which were the first works on any embankments in Belgrade since 1990, were finished in 2008.Politika, 27 September 27, 2007, p.26 Works continued in 2010‚Äì2011. After being elevated by one meter in 1967 to the point , embankment was further raised to in 2010 and in 2011, thus preventing any further floodings as the recorded water level was never higher than that. Over of the embankment was first solidified with 17,000 m3 of different materials, then consolidated with beams and further elevated with 20,000 m3 of sand, gravel and stone. = Barges = In the early 1970s, architect Branislav Jovin designed the plateau and the quay in front of the Hotel Jugoslavija. Generally considered beautiful and elegant, the project allows the cascade descent from the hotel to the Danube's bank. Early 1990s saw the expansion of the splavovi (singular, splav), barge-clubs on the rivers. They originated along the banks of the Sava and expanded in the nearby U≈°ƒáe neighborhood. After 1996, they spread along the quay in front of the hotel. The location was favorable as it was one of the rare point at the time, where there was enough parking space and the quay was arranged and concreted, while many other parts of the banks were the barges were located were still muddy and inaccessible. In the 1996‚Äì2000 period, the splavovi were swiftly anchored in front of the hotel and in such numbers, that they became so close to each other that guests from one splav were able to talk to the guests from another one. In this period, barges at Hotel Jugoslavija became one of the most popular hangouts, as the barges became one of the focal points of the vibrant Belgrade's nightlife, but were also connected with criminals and numerous incidents. The entire section of the bank in front of the hotel has since then been colloquially known as \\"Chez Juga\\" (Kod Juge), after the shortened name of the hotel. Majority of the barges placed in the last part of the 1990s are still operational, even under the same names, but are being replaced with much larger and modernized versions, unlike the other locations where splavovi appeared and disappeared, or changed names. = Pier = Zemunski Kej is the main Zemun's landing area for numerous boats. In 2014 the government set the area of the former port as the future revitalized port area. In April 2018 it was announced that the pier for the touristic ships and cruisers will be built on the quay. It was to be constructed near the Old Port Authorty (Stara Kapetanija) where the old Zemun port was located. Designed to accept ships up to long and wide, the project was to be finished by the 2019 nautical season. It will be the second international touristic pier in Belgrade, after the one in Savamala neighborhood, on the Sava river. The central steel pontoon, long and wide, will serve for the boarding and disembarkation of the visitors. Construction ultimately began in June 2019 and was to last for 120 days, or to December 2019. However, since the works didn't go as planned, in November 2019 the deadline was moved to March 2020 and the next nautical season. When construction of the supporting piles began, the slabs from the previous embankment were discovered so as several submerged vessels. The pier's bridge will be also long, with 20 piles, while the pontoon will rest on two dolphins. The piles are being founded to the depth of in order to endure the pressure of river ice, while some pontoons will be attached to the piles so that it may rise and fall, following the change of the Danube's water level. There was some initial resistance to the project among the local population, especially regarding the ecological aspect and influence on the nearby protected area of the Great War Island. The pier was finished on 6 June 2020.  Characteristics  Zemunski Kej during the 2006 European floods The residential areas include blocks 9-a and 11-c, while the mainly non-residential section includes blocks 9 and 11. In the neighborhood there are pedestrian paths or green areas used for recreation (including a large, formerly seasonal amusement park) and commercial facilities. The area used to host seasonal travelling circuses. In time, it became vast, mostly children oriented playground and fair-like attraction, including carousel, children castles, popcorn, cotton candy, street artists, souvenir shops, etc. One of the largest hotels in Belgrade, \\"Hotel Jugoslavija\\" is located in the neighborhood, but it has been closed since the NATO bombing of Serbia in 1999 when it was badly damaged. It was partially reopened in 2007 as the largest casino in Belgrade. The key is also location of several old and famous kafanas in Zemun, like Venecija, Stara Kapetanija, ≈†aran, etc. For the most part, the promenade is parallel to the street opened for traffic. Near the beginning of the promenade is one of major roundabouts in Zemun, with terminal bus stops for many public transportation bus lines (82, 85, 610, 611, 705). The promenade continues around U≈°ƒáe and makes one continuous pedestrian path next to the neighborhoods of Staro Sajmi≈°te and Savski Nasip, alongside the left bank of the Sava. As the bank (and thus the quay, too) follows the line of the nearby Great War Island, it is the beginning point of the pontoon bridge which seasonally connects the Lido beach on the island with the mainland. The main access street to the southern, Hotel Jugoslavija section, is Bulevar Mar≈°ala Tolbuhina, previously called Goce Delƒçeva Street. In the 21st century, a numerous food venues were opened. They were mostly fast food and take-out restaurants and grills, and their number continuously grew (\\"more fast-food venues than elements in Mendeleev's periodic table\\"). In many cases they are opened 24/7, and in time the social phenomenon developed - constant queues of people which spread along the street waiting for food day and night. For this, the street became known as the \\"Street of the Hungry\\", \\"Valley of the Hungry\\" or \\"Has Vegas\\" (has is Belgrade slang for eating). = Memorials = Airmen monument A monument dedicated to 11 pilots of the Royal Yugoslav Army Air Force, killed in action during the Axis attack on Yugoslavia in 1941, was built in 1994. It was sculptured by Miodrag ≈Ωivkoviƒá. Zemun Railway Station memorial There is a memorial commemorating the original Zemun railway station. The station was located close to the modern Hotel Jugoslavija. It was built in 1883, during the rule of Austria-Hungary, when the railway, which connected Zemun to Novi Sad, was finished. In 1884 the railway was extended across the Sava into the Kingdom of Serbia as the first railway in the country. The station was operational until 1970. Architect Milun Stamboliƒá designed a memorial complex which consists of five pillars, which used to hold the station's overhang, and several meters of railroad tracks. The complex is placed on the plateau next to the hotel, on the small elevation above the promenade along the Danube. The memorial complex was set in the 1980s. John Hunyadi monument On 22 July 2019, a monument to the medieval Hungarian knight John Hunyadi (, ), was dedicated on the promenade. Hunyadi defended Belgrade against the Ottoman Turks during the 1456 Siege of Belgrade. Presidents of both Serbia and Hungary, Aleksandar Vuƒçiƒá and J√°nos √Åder, attended the dedication. Map of Urban local communities in Zemun municipality Immediately, the monument became the subject of ridicule. Hunyadi was described as being placed in the shower stall. The statue holding a sword, work of Hungarian sculptor Istv√°n Madarasi, was unfavorably compared to the existing monuments to Hunyadi in Budapest and Romania. Described as looking like a cartoon or a comic book character, it became a hit on social media, where people \\"guessed\\" who is actually represented by the statue: actors Zoran Radmiloviƒá (in his iconic Ubu Roi role) and , theatrical director , DJ and radio host , cartoon, animated or literature characters Asterix, Sir Giles, Don Quixote and Tin Woodman, Joan of Arc with mustache, Kinder Surprise toy, etc. A week after the unveiling, on the night of 30 to 31 July, the statue's sword, which was loosely attached to the statue, was stolen but police apprehended the culprits on the same day. They were three art students, claiming they removed the sword in protest. In September 2019 someone placed a wooden sword, decorated with flowers, in the statue's empty hand. Madarasi reattached the original sword on 2 October 2019. By January 2020 the effects of the elements on the copper statue were quite visible. Branko Najhold memorial bench On 18 June 2020, a memorial to (1947-2016) was dedicated on the promenade. Najhold was an author, founder of the International Zemun's Caricature Salon and an avid chronicler of Zemun. The memorial, representing a figure of Najhold sitting on a bench, was sculptured by Stevan Filipoviƒá.  Administration  Zemunski Kej made a local community (mesna zajednica, municipal sub-administrative division) within the municipality of Zemun. It split from the local community of Donji Grad before the 1991 census, when it had a population of 3,927. In the next census, in 2002, it had 3,649 inhabitants. Local communities in the urban core of Zemun were later abolished. Including local communities which are adjacent to the entire promenade (Dunav and Jugoslavija), the entire neighborhood had a total population of 13,385 in 1991 and 12,112 in 2002.

Close Action is a naval board wargame published by Clash of Arms in 1997 and designed by Mark A. Campbell. The game replicates naval warfare of the 18th and early 19th centuries. The game was inspired by and shares superficial similarities to the Avalon Hill game Wooden Ships and Iron Men (WS&IM;). It was created chiefly in response to perceived errors in the simulation found in WS&IM.; History Close Action was first imagined in the 1980s by Mark Campbell and other avid Wooden Ships and Iron Men players as a \\"fix\\" to WS&IM;'s unrealistic simulation of Age of Reason naval combat. Campbell, while retaining many superficial similarities to Wooden Ships and Iron Men, changed the game mechanics significantly in order to create a more realistic simulation of period naval conflict. Over a decade was spent designing the game and play- testing in both small and large games, chiefly along the Eastern Coast of the United States. Close Action was finally published by Clash of Arms in 1997. Basics Close Action is broken up into turns, which are broken up further into phases. Phases of a turn in Close Action include: *Phase one is the movement plotting phase, where the players plot movement for the turn, and ship captains and admirals write messages to be delivered later in the turn. *Phase two is the movement phase, where movement is resolved. This is a generally straightforward phase, though there are occasional collisions which must be resolved in this phase. *Phase three is the fire plotting phase, where the players plot fire on enemy ships, calculating the distance, their own morale rating, and the ship class. *Phase four is the fire resolution phase, where dice are rolled and damage caused during the firing phase is recorded. *Phase five is when all other types of less important things occur, such as fixing rigging or hull, grappling or un-grappling from another ship, firefighting, and boarding actions *Phase six is when the messages written during phase one are delivered to the rest of the fleet, and the turn ends. \\"Monster\\" games Close Action, though it is at its basis a tabletop wargame with only a few players, is considered especially good with large fleet actions, replicated by numbers of players generally in the tens and twenties, but sometimes expanding into the forties or larger. (Since the game mechanics have all players simultaneously plot their movement, fire, and limited communication via signals, larger numbers of players do not slow down the game waiting for each player in sequence to have a turn.) There are usually large monster games played at the Historical Miniatures Gaming Society conventions in Lancaster, PA, and at other wargaming conventions. Many monster games are played on a massive hex-grid with 2-inch hexes rather than the standard hex- grid which comes with the game. In these monster games, famous, infamous, obscure, or even semi-fantasy battles are fought between fleets. The ideal ratio of ships to players is 1:1, though this is usually not entirely achieved. Mark Campbell himself runs many monster games, including the Trafalgar Day games, which are the largest monster-games, being upwards of 40-50 players. On the first Trafalgar Day game, held in 2005 one day after the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, there were 60+ players in attendance, and there were (on rare occasions) even more players than ships. Criticism The main criticism of Close Action is the apparent complication of its rules, which are far more complex than those in Wooden Ships and Iron Men. This is, however largely illusory and the rules generally play as quickly as those of WS&IM.; Other criticisms are the lack of fleet level morale rules and the tendency of most ships to fight on until completely wrecked. In addition, there are no command control rules other than having a separate player for each ship. Supplements The main Close Action ruleset is accompanied by two supplements. The first, entitled \\"Rebel Seas\\" comprises scenarios covering the American War of Independence, as well as providing some additional and amended rules. The second, \\"Monsoon Seas\\" covers the naval campaigns in India in the 1780s, notably the actions fought between British Admiral Hughes and French Admiral Suffren.

Giobbi's paintings and other renderings appear in collections in the U.S. and, particularly, in Italy. His works have been shown in solo and group shows featuring a range from abstract impressionism to pop art. According to New York Times reviewer Edward Zimmer, Giobbi's early works reveal the influence of expressionism. These works depict a \\"dark sense of ambiguity and longing\\" contradicted by \\"buoyant\\" colors. \\"Mr. Giobbi's art then takes a different turn... more intellectual and formal\\", revealing the impact of cubism and formalism. Zimmer notes Giobbi's use of a protagonist, Linus, addressing issues of loss and abandonment. See the article \\"In Katonah with Nothing But Abstractions to Consider\\" by Vivien Raynor, New York Times, July 19, 1992, and Giobbi's response, \\"The Myth of Linus in Greek Mythology\\" New York Times, September 16, 1992. Giobbi's later works are autobiographical, with a \\"free, seemingly extemporaneous use of paint that contrasts with the deliberately plotted quality of the main compositions.\\" World War Two Edward Giobbi served in the U.S. Army, European Theatre, during World War Two, participating in the final push through Nazi Germany, having been deployed in 1945 to reinforce American units after \\"The Battle of The Bulge\\" or \\"Operation: Watch on The Rhine\\".

They had families, they experienced war, and there was no time for fussing around.\\" \\"Shortly afterwards, my mother suggested I visit Italy. I stayed for three years, learned to speak better Italian and studied fresco painting at the Academia di Belle Arte in Florence. I learned the old master techniques using dried pigments with rabbit skin glue. That is when I fell in love with the early fresco artists: Giotto, Masaccio, Piero della Francesca and Michelangelo. Those are the people that still nourish me through their art.\\" Personal Life In speaking of his return to New York City in 1954, he said: \\"I had a special grant from the Art Students League, affording me time and space in the sculpture studio. I met my wife, Elinor Turner, there. In 1958, we decided to return to Europe. We got married in Switzerland.\\" Returning to the Northeast in 1961, the Giobbis stayed in a friend's home in Greenwich, searching the tristate area for a home before settling in Katonah. \\"I found Munch, C√©zanne, Matisse, Picasso and Giacometti to be artists that nourished me,\\" he said, recalling influences on his work at that time. \\"In those days, Abstract Expressionism was in full swing. I liked the excitement and the abandonment of their technique to a degree, but I do not believe in anarchy. If you look at the growth of masses of various vegetation that grows naturally in the woods, you see extreme anarchy. However, if you really study this vegetation, there is order there.

Overview  The Reer Nuur are one of the biggest sub-divisions of the Gadabursi clan family. Historically, they occupy the buffer zone between the Gadabuursi and Isaaq tribes. Historically, when the clan would meet for political affairs, the Reer Nuur would be counted as one separate branch, on equal standing with the Habar Afan, Mahad Case, Aadan Yonis and the Jibril Yonis, sub groups of the Gadabursi family .  Distribution  The Reer Nuur reside in 3 countries, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Somaliland. Within Somaliland, the Reer Nuur reside in the Awdal province, and dominate the Baki District and Dilla District. They also inhabit the Borama District and Zeila District. Within the Woqooyi Galbeed province, they reside in the Gabiley District, in towns such as Tog Wajaale, El Bardale, and Gabiley. Within the Hargeisa District, they reside in Hargeisa, in the Stadium and State Park neighborhoods. Within Djibouti, the Reer Nuur reside in Quarter 4 and 5 of Djibouti (city). Within Ethiopia, the Reer Nuur reside in the Somali Region, specifically in the Awbare district, the most demographically popular region of the Jigjiga Zone. The Reer Nuur historically have grazed up to Jijiga and make up the majority of the inhabitants of the city of Awbare.  History  As a member of the Dir clan, the Reer Nuur come under the Makahiil branch of the Gadabuursi. As a member of the Dir clan, the Reer Nuur were a part of the Sultanate of Ifat and the Adal Sultanate.Fut≈´·∏• al-·∏§abasha. (n.d.). Christian-Muslim Relations 1500 - 1900. doi:10.1163/2451-9537_cmrii_com_26077 These sultanates were ran by the Walashma dynasty, who were originated by the famous Yusuf bin Ahmad al- Kawneyn. The Reer Nuur also occupy some of the oldest towns of these sultanates, the towns of Amud and Awbare. Which are also known as important historical sites and home to many Somali saints. In the colonial age, the Reer Nuur were adamantly anti colonization, and refused to join the British (along with other Gadabuursi) against the Dervish movement. The Balwo style of music and poetry was invented by a member of the Reer Nuur clan, known as Abdi Sinimo. His new style of music also led to the rise of the Heello genre and gave birth to modern Somali music.

Approximately one kilometre inland is the noted medieval drovers' road known as the Causey Mounth. The geology of Grim Brigs is associated with the harder rock formations north of the Highland Boundary Fault, which forms the boundary between the Scottish Highlands and Lowlands. This Highland Boundary Fault emerges at the North Sea approximately four kilometres south of Grim Brigs near the Chapel of St. Mary and St. Nathalan. History Grim Brigs is situated several kilometres east of the ancient Causey Mounth trackway, which road was constructed to make passable this only available medieval route from coastal points south from Stonehaven to Aberdeen. This ancient passage specifically connected the River Dee crossing (where the present Bridge of Dee is situated) via Portlethen Moss, Muchalls Castle and Stonehaven to the south.C.Michael Hogan. Causey Mounth, Megalithic Portal, ed. by A.

He served as Head Bishop of the International Community of Christ, Church of the Second Advent from 1971 until his death. Rising to prominence as one of the premier explorers of Peru in the 1960s,Covert, \\"The Explorer,\\" p. 28 he is best known for his claims to have discovered more than 40 lost cities in Peru and is credited with bringing to light a number of Peru‚Äôs most important archeological sites, including Vilcabamba, the last refuge of the Incas during the Spanish conquest, and Gran Pajaten, which he named but did not discover.Covert, \\"The Explorer,\\" p. 28Obituary, The Independent, 2007  Early life  Savoy was born in Bellingham, Washington. At age 17 he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and served two years during World War II, after which he enrolled at the University of Portland to begin studies for the priesthood. Following an incident when one of his professors told him that the ideas he expressed in one of his papers were \\"very close to heresy,\\" Savoy went to see the dean of men and legendary counselor, Monsignor John B. Delaunay, who told Savoy that he reminded him of Teilhard de Chardin and, recognizing that Savoy had some mission to perform, encouraged Savoy to take off a year to \\"follow his heart\\" and pursue his studies privately rather than remain in school.Covert, \\"The Explorer,\\" p.26 Initially shocked by this advice, Savoy went on to work as a journalist for the next ten years while he continued his studies of regional Indian petroglyphs and of religion.Project X: The Explorations, 1987, pp. 6-8 During those years, he spent much of his time studying the literature, legends, and folklore of the North American Indians in the Pacific Northwest, intrigued by the possibility that there may have been early contacts between North and South America.Savoy, Antisuyo, pp. 15-17 He also studied mystic Judaism and Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, the Chinese classics, and the Gnostic writings during that time under direct disciples of Khalil Gibran and Paul Brunton.Project X: The Explorations, 1987, pp. 13-19 In 1956 Savoy‚Äôs life changed utterly. His business collapsed and took with it his home, his belongings, and his marriage. As luck would have it, however, his documentary film of Columbia Gorge petroglyphs and carvings was picked up by a national news service, and his theories about similarities between North and South American picture drawings attracted the attention of an American archeologist who offered to take Savoy on an expedition to Peru as a photographer. Eager to fulfill his dream of becoming an explorer, Savoy accepted. In 1957 Savoy moved to Peru and a few years later began to organize his own archaeological expeditions under the auspices of the Andean Explorers Club, which he founded and which later grew into the Andean Explorers Foundation & Ocean Sailing Club.Covert, \\"The Explorer,\\" p.27  Explorer  Throughout the 1960s, Savoy carried out a series of well publicized expeditions in Peru, exploring and documenting various pre-Columbian archaeological sites.Profile of Gene Savoy, \\"We All Search For Something\\", 2009 In 1964 he identified a ruin called Espiritu Pampa as the legendary Vilcabamba, the 16th century capital of the Neo-Inca Empire and the last refuge of the Incas during the Spanish conquest.Savoy, Antisuyo, pp. 73-128Lee, Forgotten Vilcabamba, 2000Hemming, Conquest, pp. 492-499Covert, \\"The Explorer,\\" pp. 27-28Profile of Gene Savoy, \\"We All Search For Something\\", 2009Maugh, \\"Science winces at adventurer's ways\\", 2004 This discovery disproved Hiram Bingham‚Äôs belief that Machu Picchu and Vilcabamba were one and the same.Hemming, Conquest, p. 499Obituary, The Independent, 2007 In 1965 Savoy explored and brought worldwide attention to a site he named Gran Pajat√©n, an ornately ornamented stone city located in northeastern Peru.Savoy, Antisuyo, pp. 131-143Gilbert, \\"Lost Cities,\\" pp. 48-53, 83 His discovery of this site, as well as Vilcabamba and other sites, is disputed.Obituary, The Independent, 2007 From 1965 to 1970 he continued his explorations into Peru‚Äôs eastern monta√±a. In 1969 Savoy built and captained the Kuviqu (also known as the \\"Feathered Serpent I\\"), a totora-reed raft of ancient design, along 2,000 miles of ocean coastline from Peru to Mesoamerica in an effort to prove that Peruvians and Mexicans could have maintained contact in ancient times and that the legendary heroes Viracocha and Quetzalcoatl were one and the same.Savoy,On the Trail of the Feathered Serpent, 1974Heyerdahl, Early Man, pp. 42-43, 68, 381Profile of Gene Savoy, \\"We All Search For Something\\", 2009 Soon afterwards he captained the \\"Feathered Serpent II\\", which he sailed from the United States to the Caribbean, to Central and South America, and finally to Hawaii, to study ocean and wind currents.Profile of Gene Savoy, \\"We All Search For Something\\", 2009 In 1997 he sailed a 73-foot wooden catamaran from Peru to Hawaii in a dramatic effort to demonstrate that ancient Peruvians could have sailed the open seas.Profile of Gene Savoy, \\"We All Search For Something\\", 2009Covert, \\"The Explorer,\\" pp. 30-31 Savoy returned to the United States in the early 1970s, but continued his explorations throughout the latter half of the 20th century.

Savoy‚Äôs uneasy relationship with the academic archaeologist community, who deplored his swashbuckling ways while they built on his discoveries for their own research,Obituary, The Independent, 2007 is exemplified by the comment of archeologist Keith Muscutt, who pointed out that finding ruins \\"is about as hard as finding elephants in a zoo\\" Martin, \\"Gene Savoy, Flamboyant Explorer of Ruins, Dies at 80\\", 2007 on the mountain ridges of northern Peru where Savoy made most of his discoveries, a region University of Florida archeologist Michael Moseley compared to \\"the Amazon jungle stretched over the Rocky Mountains.\\" Maugh, \\"Science winces at adventurer's ways\\", 2004 Scientists have also questioned Savoy‚Äôs tendency to use his explorations to pursue uncommon theories, e.g. his claim that King Solomon acquired gold and precious stones from Peru (Ophir).Martin, \\"Gene Savoy, Flamboyant Explorer of Ruins, Dies at 80\\", 2007 \\"Savoy's involvement in the Chachapoya saga clouds the scientific issues, attracts a lot of crackpots and scares off serious researchers who don't want to constantly have to deal with Savoy's tedious legacy of lost cities/El Dorado fantasies and other delusions,\\" said archaeologist Keith Muscutt.Maugh, \\"Science winces at adventurer's ways\\", 2004 The central driving idea behind all Savoy‚Äôs exploring was to show that the jungle was not on the fringes of Peruvian culture but at its center. It was this concept that led him on his obsessive search for the legendary cities of the Chachapoyas.Obituary, The Independent, 2007 Savoy emphasized that he continually returned to historical sources in order to find clues for his searches: ::No sensible man goes down into the jungle unless he's got something to follow. I see explorers as people with open minds who can scan many different sources for information, unconfined by an academic discipline, just like computers scan the internet. We've all learnt that the great thing is to follow the roads. Roads lead to ruins.Obituary, The Independent, 2007 The advice to 'follow the roads', meaning the Inca roads, was taken to heart by the Andean explorer Vince Lee who had some fruitful discussions with Savoy before embarking on his own Andean explorations. Savoy's major discoveries gained him recognition as the \\"real Indiana Jones\\" by People magazine after his parallel career as religious leader and researcher became known.People Weekly, May 1985, pp. 30-31.  Spiritual researcher and religious educator  Over several decades, Savoy uncovered and institutionalized a modern system for spiritual self-regeneration rooted in the hidden teachings of the Essenes who, he was convinced, were the forebears of Jesus.Savoy, Essaei Document, 1983Melton, \\"International Community of Christ,\\" p. 1128 He called the spiritual discipline Cosolargy,Melton, \\"International Community of Christ,\\" p. 1128 believing that similar esoteric systems were practiced by ancient high holy orders around the world, including those of ancient America, and were eventually lost, in whole or in part, to modern society.Savoy, \\"International Community of Christ\\", 2009 In 1959 he established the Cosolargy Institute (also known as the American Philosophical Institute of Cosolargy) to follow new conditions in the sun and to undertake further research into the spiritual teachings of ancient solar cultures.Melton, \\"International Community of Christ,\\" p. 1128 He later formalized this research under the auspices of the American Cosmic Solar Research Center, established in 1962,Project X: The Explorations, 1987, p. 21 and the research program Project \\"X\\": The Search for the Secrets of Immortality, established in 1970,Project X: The Explorations, 1987, p. 21 all of which continue to function through the Jamilian University. In 1959 Savoy also established the International Community of Christ, Church of the Second Advent to impart Cosolargy as the basis for a new understanding of the authentic Christian teaching and of the Essenes and Jesus as precursors to a modern messianic age.Martin, \\"Gene Savoy, Flamboyant Explorer of Ruins, Dies at 80\\", 2007Savoy, \\"International Community of Christ\\", 2009 He taught that Christ had come again as prophesied, not as a human messiah, but as a celestial mediating force available to all humankind through the manifesting Spiritual Sun spoken of in Malachi 4:1-3 and in the Essene Book of Hymns, to usher in a new epoch.Melton, \\"International Community of Christ,\\" pp. 1127-1128 The church teaches that Jesus prophesied the future coming of Christ as the \\"Sun of Righteousness\\" Savoy, \\"International Community of Christ\\", 2009 and that the cosmic phenomenon of the Messianic Sun began in 1962, as revealed by Savoy‚Äôs son, Jamil (1959‚Äì1962), a wondrous child seer Melton, \\"International Community of Christ,\\" pp. 11-27-1128 who lived in the Andes of Peru.Savoy, \\"International Community of Christ\\", 2009 The notion that Savoy believed his son Jamil to be the Second Coming of Christ is a misunderstanding that arose during his first interview with a local newspaper as head bishop of the church Haq, Reno-Gazette Journal, 1982 and has been repeated in newspapers ever since as a boiler plate item, appearing even in one of his obituaries.Obituary, The Independent, 2007 Bishop Savoy addressed this misconception directly in a 1985 theological lecture: ::People may say that the sun is an ordinary sun. Is it? It is to the person that sees it as an ordinary sun. People may say: \\"Jamil had no purpose. He was just an ordinary child. Why did God have to use The Child? Who needs him?\\" I have been accused of building a monument to my dead son, and people laugh at me because I speak about Jamil in the way that I do. The Child was an Image, and that Image was a vehicle for the manifestation of God‚Äôs Word. Therefore, The Child was necessary. But The Child is not a Jesus Christ. He certainly is not a \\"savior\\" in the strictest sense of the word. He is merely a conveyor of information from one world to the other for our use, much the same as was Jesus. We are not saved by any human, neither Jamil nor Jesus. We are saved by God. Therefore, God teaches us by the creation and the manifestation of the Image as a vehicle and intermediary by which the Word manifests and speaks to us. Therefore, Jamil was not ordinary nor is the sun ordinary. There is a New Sun and there is a new humankind coming into existence. Jamil was the first of that New Race.Savoy, Core Theology Series, Lecture 129, p. 12 Through the years, Savoy produced a steady stream of scholarly and transcendent literature, which included more than 60 volumes on Cosolargy, the Essenes, the origins of Christianity, and comparative religion;Obituary, The Independent, 2007 and he delivered over 400 lectures on metaphysics, philosophy and theology,Gene Savoy website which form the core lectures of the Sacred College program of the Jamilian University of the Ordained.

The mystical marriage of Saint Catherine (or \\"Mystic\\") covers two different subjects in Christian art arising from visions received by either Catherine of Alexandria or Catherine of Siena (1347‚Äì1380), in which these virgin saints went through a mystical marriage wedding ceremony with Christ, in the presence of the Virgin Mary, consecrating themselves and their virginity to him. The Catholic Encyclopaedia notes that such a wedding ceremony \\"is but the accompaniment and symbol of a purely spiritual grace\\", and that \\"as a wife should share in the life of her husband, and as Christ suffered for the redemption of mankind, the mystical spouse enters into a more intimate participation in His sufferings.\\" Catherine of Alexandria was martyred, while Catherine of Siena received the stigmata. Both subjects are frequent subjects in Christian art; the scene usually includes one of the Saint Catherines and either the infant Jesus held by his mother or an adult Jesus. Very rarely both saints are shown in a double ceremony (as at right). Saint Catherine of Alexandria is invariably dressed as a princess in rich clothes, often with a crown, and normally with loose long blonde hair and carrying a martyr's palm, sometimes with her attribute of a wheel; Saint Catherine of Siena is shown as a Dominican nun in white with a black over-robe open at the front, so it is usually easy to tell which saint is depicted.Earls, 56‚Äì57, 203  History  Barna da Siena, c. 1340 Although Saint Catherine of Alexandria was supposed to have lived in the third and fourth centuries, the story of her vision appears first to be found in literature after 1337, over a thousand years after the traditional dating of her death, and ten years before Catherine of Siena was born.Lucetta Scaraffia, Gabriella Zarri. Women and faith: Catholic religious life in Italy from late antiquity to the present, p.80, Harvard University Press, 1999, , , Google books It appears in later versions of the popular Golden Legend, but the earliest version of the account there seems to be in an English translation of 1438.Blum, Shierley Nielson, Early Netherlandish Triptychs, p. 155, note 26, University of California Press, 1969, google books The Barna da Siena panel at right was painted within a few years of the first literary mentions. Although she is a very popular saint in Eastern Orthodoxy, the marriage is not a traditional subject in Orthodox icons. In Western art the vision of Saint Catherine of Alexandria usually shows the Infant Christ, held by the Virgin, placing a ring (one of her attributes) on her finger, following some literary accounts, although in the version in the Golden Legend he appears to be adult, and the marriage takes place among a great crowd of angels and \\"all the celestial court\\",Life of St \\"Katherine\\" in William Caxton's English version of the Golden Legend. and these may also be shown. Saint Catherine of Siena would have been familiar with this story ‚Äì the Barna da Siena panel shown was painted in Siena a few years before she was born ‚Äì and she is recorded as praying as a child that she would have a similar experience, which she eventually did.

However, unlike the Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, there were no large monumental images, such as the main panel of an altarpiece, of the Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Siena until 1528, when the Siennese painter Domenico Beccafumi painted one for the church of Santo Spirito in Siena.Jenkens, 179 A mystical marriage to Christ is also an attribute of Saint Rosa of Lima (died 1617), and many other saints have reported such visions.

Design and development The Type 1 Phoenix was the first design of the Heston Aircraft Company formed in 1934. The Phoenix was a single-engined high- wing monoplane, with a wood monocoque fuselage and wood-framed wing with plywood and fabric covering. It was powered by a 200 hp (149 kW) de Havilland Gipsy VI engine, and had a retractable main undercarriage in stub-wings plus a faired tailwheel. It was the first British high-wing monoplane fitted with a hydraulically operated retractable undercarriage. The prototype Phoenix, registered G-ADAD, first flew at Heston Aerodrome on 18 August 1935, piloted by Edmund G. Hordern. The fourth, fifth and sixth aircraft were designated Phoenix II, and were each fitted with an improved 205 hp (153 kW) de Havilland Gipsy VI Series II engine and a de Havilland constant speed propeller. Operational history The one Australian aircraft crashed shortly after delivery, killing its owner Jimmy Melrose, but four British aircraft were used by private owners and for charter flying. At the outbreak of the Second World War, three surviving aircraft in the UK were impressed into service by the Royal Air Force.Moss 1962 Phoenix II G-AESV survived military service to be sold for renewed civilian use in 1946 and was used for joyriding and charter flights until it crashed in the French Alps in April 1952.

Founding Harlan Page Hall founded the Saint Paul Dispatch on February 29, 1868. Hall was born in 1838 in Ravenna, Ohio, where his father published a country newspaper. After graduating from Ohio Wesleyan in 1861, Hall was admitted to the bar. Poor health inspired him to move to Minnesota in 1862, where he went to work for the St. Paul Union newspaper. The Union merged with the St. Paul Press the following year. In 1865 Hall purchased the St. Paul Pioneer, but sold it a year later. After spending two years in the printing business with David Ramaley, Hall launched the Dispatch. Ramaley, an active Republican, served as the Dispatch's publisher.Castle, History of St. Paul and Vicinity, p. 1196 The Hall and Castle Years When Harlan Hall founded the Dispatch in 1868, he made no secret of his political affiliations.Weber, \\"The Story of the St. Paul Globe,\\" p. 327. In the 1800s newspapers openly aligned with political parties and the Dispatch was no exception. Under Hall's leadership, the paper initially supported the insurgent wing of the Republican Party. But Hall (who was the great uncle of the Minnesota sports broadcaster Halsey Hall) switched parties in the mid-1870s and became a Democrat. When Hall sold the Dispatch in 1878, the newspaper reflected Hall's Democratic affiliation. With the change of ownership in 1878, however, the paper's political orientation once again transformed \\"overnight.\\" Hall sold the paper to Henry Anson Castle, who made the Dispatch \\"an aggressive Republican organ.\\"Castle, History of St. Paul and Vicinity, pp. 1192, 1199-1200 A Union Army veteran, Castle was active in the Minnesota Republican Party and held a seat in the state legislature in the 1870s.Castle, History of St. Paul and Vicinity, pp. 1199-1200 Castle also played a leading role in the successful 1874 gubernatorial campaign of Cushman Kellogg Davis.Castle, History of St. Paul and Vicinity, p. 1200 Castle briefly turned over editorial duties in 1880 to Lucius Nieman, who later founded The Milwaukee Journal. But otherwise Castle set the Dispatch's editorial direction until 1885. George Thompson and the Dispatch Printing Company George Thompson, an Anglo-American banker and entrepreneur, purchased the Dispatch in 1885.Burnquist, Minnesota and Its People, Vol. 3, p. 108 Thompson was born in Devonshire, England, in 1840. After graduating from Eton College and Oxford University, he worked for 17 years as a banker at Willis, Percival & Company. When the bank collapsed as a result of the global wool panic, Thompson took his father's advice and immigrated to the United States in 1882. He worked as an advertising salesman at the Joliet News before moving to Minnesota. He married Abigail Ione Wheeler in 1885 and they settled in St. Paul. After acquiring the Dispatch in 1885, George Thompson established the Dispatch Printing Company. His wife, Abigail, was co-owner of the Dispatch and he relied heavily on her advice in running the newspaper. The Dispatch Printing Company bought the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1909 and managed the two newspapers as independent news outlets. The Pioneer Press became the city's daily morning newspaper and the Dispatch became the city's daily evening newspaper. Thompson was a staunch Republican and the Dispatch advocated on behalf of Republican candidates.Burnquist, Minnesota and Its People, Vol. 3, p. 113 As a long-standing at-large delegate to the Republican National Convention, he wrote the gold standard into the Republican platform. Thompson was a friend of William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and many other national officeholders. Thompson had a Patek Philippe watch custom made for him in 1914 that was sold at auction by Sotheby's in May 2006 for $1.54 million. When George Thompson died in 1917, Charles K. Blandin bought a controlling interest in the Dispatch Printing Company. After Abigail Thompson died in 1923, Blandin took over the remaining shares in the company. Blandin operated the newspaper until he sold it to Ridder Publications in 1927. Ridder Publications (which later became Knight Ridder) acquired both the Dispatch and the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1927. As a young man, Robert Ridder, the philanthropist and co-founder of the Minnesota North Stars, worked as a Dispatch reporter. The 1978 Election Controversy In 1978 the Dispatch became involved in an election dispute that ended up before the Minnesota Supreme Court. In October 1978, William G. Sumner, the Dispatch's editor, interviewed a state legislative candidate named Bob Pavlak. An Independent- Republican, Pavlak ran for the District 67A state legislative seat against the incumbent, Arnold Kempe, a member of the Democratic Farmer Labor Party. During the Dispatch interview, Pavlak produced documents that indicated that Kempe had missed over 300 roll call votes during the 1977 and 1978 legislative sessions. Pavlak warned the Dispatch that there might be computational errors in the documents. On Saturday, November 4, 1978--three days before the election--the Dispatch printed an editorial in which it asserted that the editors \\"have seen nothing to dispute his [Pavlak's] research report that shows the incumbent voted four times in 1967-68 this out of more than 300 opportunities.\\" The editorial misstated the years in question as 1967-68 rather than 1977-78. But the real problem with the editorial was its misrepresentation of Kempe's voting record. In fact, Kempe only missed 329 votes out of 1,798 roll call votes, not 325 votes out of 329 as the Dispatch's editorial erroneously suggested. Pavlak's campaign subsequently informed the Dispatch editors that they had misstated the year, but did not make mention of the newspaper's erroneous tabulation of Kempe's roll call votes. The Minnesota Supreme Court later concluded that copies of the November 4 edition of the Dispatch reached at least 6,000 eligible voters in the district before Election Day. In addition, the Pavlak campaign circulated over 1,800 reprints of the editorial in five St. Paul and West St. Paul precincts. On Monday, November 6, the Dispatch printed a second editorial, this time asserting that it had \\"erred in our endorsement of Robert Pavlak, IR, who is seeking to unseat Rep. Arnold Kempe in 67A. Pavlak's research report stated Kempe voted four times during the years 1977-78, not, as incorrectly reported, 1967-68.\\" But the second editorial failed to correct the major factual error in the November 4 editorial. At the November 7 election, Pavlak narrowly defeated Kempe by a margin of 4,454 votes to 4,133. The Minnesota Supreme Court ultimately determined that Pavlak's campaign had violated Minnesota's Fair Campaign Practices Act by circulating the reprinted copies of the erroneous editorial. As the majority explained: :\\"[I]t is our conclusion that Mr. Pavlak violated Minn.St. 210A.04 and that this violation was \\"deliberate, serious and material\\" within the meaning of Minn.St. 209.02. It was deliberate in the sense that the distribution of the statement as worded was intentional and was intended to affect the voting at the election. It was serious because the distribution of 1,800-1,900 reprints in a single legislative district is a far from trivial amount. It was material because voting is the essence of a representative's position, and attacking voting performance is germane to one's conduct in that position.\\" But citing to the Minnesota Constitution, the majority concluded that the court had no authority to overturn the election results. Section 6 of Article IV of the Minnesota Constitution provides that: \\"Each house shall be the judge of the election returns and eligibility of its own members.\\" The Court thus concluded that \\"[i]n short, we have no jurisdiction to issue a final and binding decision in this matter, and our opinion by statute will be and by the Minnesota Constitution must only be advisory to the House of Representatives.\\" Pavlak took his seat in the Minnesota House of Representatives on January 3, 1979. However, the House immediately investigated the allegation that Pavlak's campaign violated state election law by circulating the editorial reprints. The contest's resolution ultimately came down to a party line vote. Following the 1978 elections, the state house was perfectly divided between Independent Republicans and DFLers: 67 seats to 67.71st Minnesota Legislature But House rules prohibited Pavlak from voting on his own election contest. Accordingly, with party loyalty shaping how both sides viewed the contest, the House voted by a margin of 67 to 66 that Pavlak had violated the election law. Pavlak's seat was declared vacated and the House directed that a special election be held for the seat. Pavlak ran in the special election, but lost to Frank Rodriguez, Sr., the first Hispanic ever elected to the Minnesota legislature. Demise of the Dispatch Name Knight Ridder continued to publish the Pioneer Press and Dispatch as independent daily newspapers until 1985, when they merged to become the St. Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch. In 1990 the owners dropped the word Dispatch from the name, bringing to an end the Dispatch's 122-year run as a prominent feature on the St. Paul media landscape.

The \\"Porus\\" coinage of Alexander, struck circa 325-323 BC in Susa or Babylon, often bears the marks \\"AB\\" and \\"Œû\\" (here \\"Œû\\" appears on the obverse and \\"AB\\" on the reverse -the hoops of the \\"B\\" appear on the left leg of the \\"A\\"), which may correspond to Abulites and Xenophilus. Abulites went to help Alexander in the crossing of the Gedrosian desert, but he brought a huge load of coins rather than much-needed supplies, thus precipitating his demise. Abulites () was the Achaemenid satrap (governor) of Susiana during the reign of Darius III (336‚Äì330 BC), and retained the satrapy as a Hellenistic satrap under Alexander the Great until circa 324 BC, when he was executed for sedition. Surrender to Alexander He may have been of Elamite origin, although his son, Oxathres (Gatha Avestan: Hux≈°athra), bears an Iranian name, \\"one that seems distinctly Zoroastrian\\". After the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BC), the Mesopotamian province of the Achaemenid Empire quickly fell to Alexander. Thereafter, Abulites had no choice but to surrender nearby Susa. After entering Susa, Alexander captured \\"a vast collection of treasure, including 50,000 talents of silver in ingots\\". Treasure from Xerxes' campaign in mainland Greece was found and taken as well. Some statuary from Athens, such as the bronze statue of Harmodius and Haristogiton, \\"the Tyrant-slayers\\", was recovered by Alexander in Susa. Susa was the co-capital of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, but the \\"hoarding of specie\\" does illustrate the \\"shortsightedness of Achaemenid fiscal policy\\" according to C. J. Brunner. As Alexander was preparing to move into Persis, he left a garrison under the Macedonian Xenophilus (who replaced the Persian commandant Mazarus), and reconfirmed Abulites as satrap of Susania, \\"holding civil jurisdiction\\". Abulites remained satrap until Alexander's return from his Indian campaign; in the meantime, Abulites may \\"have moved to assert his independence\\". Though this remains unclear, Abulites and his son were \\"promptly arrested and executed\\". \\"Immediately afterwards\\", Alexander organized the mass weddings at Susa, \\"thus again showing his commitment to the ideal of Greek and Persian partnership\\". Gedrosian desert and coinage Plutarch (Alex. 68.7) relates a story in which Abulites was requested by Alexander to bring supplies after the disastrous crossing of the Gedrosian desert, but Abulites instead brought huge amounts of coinage, about 3000 tales (86 tons). In a rage, Alexander threw the coins at horses, asking what help this would be to a hungry army. Alexander shouted \\"What good have you done having brought this?\\". Thereafter Abulites was jailed by Alexander. Some of these coins may have been the \\"Porus\\" coins of Alexander, struck in 325-323 BC in Babylon or Susa, which often bear the initials \\"AB\\" and \\"Œû\\", possibly identified with the initials of Abulites and his associated Macedonian general Xenophilus.

AADS has developed and tested the entire range of J8's for deployment to various missions including logistical and front line operations. Recently, the J8 has been submitted as a replacement for the Toyota Tacoma, Toyota Hilux, Mitsubishi Triton and HMMWV for US Special Forces.  Design  Jeep J8 at the State Fair of Texas 2008, Fair Park, Dallas The J8 is equipped with larger brakes, axles and suspension components than the civilian version and can be upgraded further depending on the end user requirement. It has a base payload capacity of which can be extended for Armoured or Utility variants. The Jeep J8 is powered by a range of petrol and diesel engines, but more commonly the 2.2 litre or 3 litre V6 diesel power units are used, the latter delivering 260hp and 600Nm of torque. The engine is mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. Available in a number of different variants, the J8 can be produced as a Patrol vehicle, Utility vehicle, Armoured vehicle and an Ambulance. All J8 variants have a range of upgrade options to chose from and design to be easily transportable by rail, sea, fixed wing aircraft, helicopter (either inside a CH-47 or underslung).  Production  AEV J8 Milspec American Expedition Vehicles version The first J8 was first planned for assembly at a Chrysler joint-venture facility in Cairo, Egypt. On July 2, 2008, the production version of the Jeep J8 was unveiled at Euro Camp Jeep 2008, a customer event in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany. On November 13, 2008, Chrysler LLC and Arab American Vehicles officially announced the manufacturing launch of the Jeep J8 at AAV's assembly plant in Cairo. Jeep J8 is also assembled in Israel, by Automotive Industries Ltd. (AIL) of Nazareth. It is locally badged Storm 3, and will be supplied as a command vehicle to the Israeli Defence Force (IDF). A pair of production J8s was tested by Israeli web magazine Jeepolog.com journalists in April 2009. It was dubbed \\"probably best Jeep ever\\". A civilian version was apparently considered for the local Israeli market, but the idea was abandoned. In 2012 a variant of the Storm 3 was introduced by AIL in Israel under the name Storm 3 Type R.

Under US federal law and the National Credit Union Administration regulations Part 712, federal credit unions may make an investment in or a loan to a CUSO. Aggregate investments in CUSOs by federal credit unions may not exceed 1% of paid in and unimpaired capital, and aggregate loans to CUSOs may not exceed 1% of paid in and unimpaired capital. (State chartered credit unions will follow state law and in some instances, these limitations may be different.) Every CUSO must be subject to a legal opinion to ensure the proposed structure is permissible and does not engage in unauthorized activities and to ensure that potential liabilities are limited to the funds invested or loaned to it. Furthermore, every CUSO must explicitly allow the National Credit Union Administration the right to review its books and records, which must be maintained according to GAAP. Permitted services Credit unions may only invest or make a loan to CUSOs that primarily serve credit unions and credit union members and that perform a permitted service. The permitted services fall into several categories which are delineated in the regulation and include checking and currency services, clerical, professional and management services, business loan origination, consumer mortgage origination, electronic transaction services, financial counseling services, fixed asset services, insurance brokerage or agency, leasing, loan support services, record retention, security and disaster recovery services, securities brokerage services, student loan origination, trust agency services, real estate brokerage services, credit card loan origination, and payroll processing services. A CUSO in the US may be organized as a corporation, a limited liability corporation (LLC) or as a limited partnership (LP), where the credit union participating as a limited partner only. Credit unions are not authorized to be general partner. No matter which organizational form is used, the liability of the credit union owners must be limited to their investment. Due to the flexibility and favorable tax treatment, LLCs are the most common organizational entity. Risk management The usual method of splitting profits and loss is based on the percentage of ownership. However, many credit unions, using an old co- operative tradition, reward the users of the CUSO services by providing incentives to the owners to use them. CUSOs providing operational services use a tiered pricing structure that rewards heavy usage. In CUSOs providing financial services, return is sometimes based on the volume of business that is generated by members. There can be a pay or play component where a credit union that is a heavy user of the CUSO services contributes less capital or lower fees. Purpose CUSOs are formed for all sorts of reasons. They can provide avenues for innovation and creativity that would not typically occur within the confines of a credit union. They can provide a revenue stream for credit unions that would not be available within the confines of a credit union. They can reduce service costs incurred within the traditional credit union. Some may do all three. Generally, these outcomes are the result of collaboration and the cooperative spirit that is inherent in the credit union industry. Collaborating in CUSOs allows credit unions to capitalize on these outcomes and provide good member services. It gives the ability to provide better service, cheaper service, and new services that credit unions may not be able to provide. For example, not all credit unions have the capital to gain the expertise to originate business and commercial real estate loans. But, if several credit unions pool their resources they can afford to hire the right individuals and in turn provide a valuable service to their members.

Located on State Hwy 234, the most prominent feature is Waterman Baptist Church, which occupies a red brick building in the north-east corner of town. Just south of the town is one of the first round barns, the W. H. York Round Barn, which was built in 1895. History =Founding= Lazarus Shirk first settled on Coal Creek in 1826 followed by James Marks in March 1830. The town was platted as Fullerton by Peter Blakewell on April 11, 1836. It may have been named for Robert Fulton who built the first successful steamboat. Jesse Bowen and Elijah Thompson owned all of the land and the east hill was called Golderay. =Renamings= Less than a year later though the town would change its name to Lodi on January 26, 1837. It may have been named for the city of Lodi, Italy near Milan, Italy, where Napoleon won a great victory over the Austrians in 1796. The Post Office was officially call Lodiville. Once again the town's name changed in 1857 to Waterman in honor of Dr. Waterman who had opened a pork packing plant and store in town. In 1874 an R.M. Waterman owned large coal fields north of town.http://www.indianagenweb.com/inparke/Maps/1874AtlasPage91And90bLibertyTownshipMap.jpg =Industry and Businesses= The Wabash and Erie Canal passed around Lodi on the west side and wrapped around the south side before crossing Coal Creek and continuing its journey south. A feeder dam was built on coal creek. The last canal boat to pass Lodi was in 1875 heading north to Lafayette. Along with the pork packing plant by the 1880s Lodi's businesses included the Lewis Davis and Charles Bright flour mill, drug store, dry goods store, grocery store, two blacksmith shops, sawmill, Masonic Lodge, G.A.R. Post, and a school. North of town there was a health spa, that was built around the Lodi Artesian Well, that operated for many years. In 1913 the well was purchased by a group of Chicago capitalists. They installed a large pipe that allowed the well to flow into a basin. A large dance pavilion and a baseball diamond were built and the resort was most popular during the Depression. The dance pavilion was later converted to a roller skating rink and the well was used to fill the swimming pool. The business came to an end though when, in an attempt to clean the pipe, Fred Clingan instead plugged it. While it may be noted that many were sad to see the local landmark close, others expressed their gratitude for the relief of the sulfurous smell that came from the water. Today, Lodi remains a small town served by a garage, thrift shop, sign shop, mower and bait shop, vegetable stand, and an archery and gun shop.

Starting in 1955, the area was developed as an upscale master planned community during the post-World War II housing boom, with most of the houses constructed in the mid-century modern style. The area features large homes and residential lots, numerous parks and schools, and includes Garden City Shopping Centre, a regional mall. It has a land area of 2.32 square kilometres, with the population growing to 6,255 as of 2016. The garden themes are continued throughout the development, with many floral inspired street names including Buttercup Avenue, Daffodil Street and Tulip Road. The suburb is within the civic council ward of Old Kildonan and the federal riding of Kildonan-St. Paul. History The suburb was developed by Model Homes Limited, which estimated a cost of $20 million to develop the nearly master planned community. Plans for the project were first announced in 1951, with construction beginning in 1955. The area's boundaries are the CPR Winnipeg Beach subdivision to the east, Carruthers Avenue to the south, McPhillips Street to the west, and Leila Avenue to the north. Prior to the City of Winnipeg's amalgamation in 1972, the neighbourhood made up a large portion of the former City of West Kildonan. Model Homes Limited's plans for the development featured 1,500 homes, the Garden City shopping centre, six schools, churches, synagogues, parks and recreation areas. The area was marketed as the leading Winnipeg area suburb, featuring above average sized lots and larger homes. Expectations were that the building of Garden City would raise the population of the former City of West Kildonan from 14,000 to 20,000. Modern architecture The Garden City development is a showcase for mid-century modern architecture, with most of the homes in the area designed in a modernist-influenced ranch-style. Popular design elements include clean lines, large windows, carports and breeze block detailing and fencing. Many of the homes have retained these original features and the area has continued to grow in popularity with the resurgence of mid-century modern design. Demographics The area is home to a large portion of Winnipeg's Jewish community. Numerous synagogues, organizations, retirement homes and businesses catering to the Jewish community can be found throughout Garden City and the surrounding West Kildonan area. The neighbourhood also has many residents from Winnipeg's Ukrainian, German and Polish communities. Schools in the area feature both Hebrew and Ukrainian bilingual programs.

He served under Robert Surcouf and Jean-Marie Dutertre, and was held as prisoner-of-war by the British for eight years after being captured before being repatriated at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, continuing his career as a painter until his death in 1857. Biography  = Early life = Garneray was born in Paris (on Rue Saint-Andre-des-arts, in the Latin Quarter) on 19 February 1783. He was the elder son of Jean- Fran√ßois Garneray (1755‚Äì1837), painter of the king, who was pupil of Jacques- Louis David. At thirteen, he joined the Navy as a seaman, encouraged by his cousin, Beaulieu-Leloup, commander of the frigate Forte (\\"the Stout one\\"). Garneray sailed from Rochefort to the Indian Ocean with the frigate division under Sercey, to which the Forte belonged. Garneray took part in the various campaigns of Sercey division and witnessed the hardship it met in the battle against Arrogant and Victorious. He then served in 1798 on the corvette Br√ªle Gueule (\\"Mouth burner\\"), which patrolled with the frigate Preneuse (\\"the Taker\\"). Returning from this campaign, the Br√ªle Gueule and Preneuse were chased by a British squadron comprising two ships of the line, one frigate and one corvette; the French flew into a creek near Rivi√®re Noire District whose shallow waters prevented the British from pursuing. The next day, the British squadron attacked; the French had established strong defensive positions by installing the unusable batteries of their ships ashore, and repelled the British squadron. In 1799, Garneray was promoted to quartermaster and \\"first painter of the edge\\" on the Preneuse under captain Jean-Marthe-Adrien l'Hermite. The frigate was the last French official force in the Indian Ocean. This patrol went into trouble, in spite of an exceptional combat against the British ship of the line the Jupiter. Returning to Mauritius, her crew suffered from scurvy, and the Preneuse had to be kept quarantined and had to return to the British forces making the blockade of the island. Garneray escaped captivity by regaining the coast with the stroke. In spite of the disaster, Garneray kept longstanding admiration and friendship for Lhermitte, whom he would continue to visit until his death 1826. Garneray: Capture of Kent by Surcouf For lack of official ships, Garneray joined the Confiance (\\"the Trust\\") of Robert Surcouf as an ensign, from April at December 1800. He took part in the capturing and boarding the Kent in October 1800. It was the only time where Garneray made money as a sailor. Upon returning from patrol, he invested his share in a slave trading ship, l'Union, on which he was a first mate. He sailed on various trading ships during the peace of Amiens, after which he served aboard the Pinson (\\"the Finch\\"), a cutter based in √éle Bourbon. He replaced the commander when he died, and was shipwrecked shortly thereafter. He then served on the corsair Tigre du Bengale and eventually on the frigate Atalante attached to the squadron of Linois. He later served on the Belle Poule (\\"beautiful chick\\"), and was aboard when she was captured by the British in March 1806. Wounded, Garneray was transported to England and spent the eight following years in prison hulks off Portsmouth (on the Prot√©e, the Couronne (\\"Crown\\") Vengeance and Assistance. He was able to improve his standard of living by selling paintings to a British merchant. A statement attributed to him goes: \\"But for piracy, I believe that I practiced about all kinds of navigation\\". = Life as a painter = Garneray: Return from the Isle of Elba Garneray: The Naval Battle of Navarino (1827) Released on 18 May 1814, Garneray did not find employment in the commercial navy and remained in Paris where he devoted himself to painting. Probably thanks to one of his brothers, himself painter and engraver and who knew people in the entourage of Napoleon, he received his first official order: the meeting of l'Inconstant and the Z√©phir, as an anecdote of the return from Elba. The work was carried out only in 1834 as, because of the political climate of the Bourbon Restoration, he felt it more convenient to paint the Descent of the French emigrants at Quiberon, which was exhibited at the Salon de Paris in 1815. Garneray attended the salon every year from then. Garneray came to be employed by the duke of Angoul√™me, then Grand Admiral of France, and became his appointed painter in 1817. He was in fact the first Peintre de la Marine (\\"official painter of the Navy\\"). Between 1821 and 1830, he went in many harbours of France where he made numerous sketches which were used as a basis for engravings or fabrics. In 1833, he was made director of the museum of Rouen. He later joined the Manufacture nationale de S√®vres. In the 1830s he developed a new genre of painting, the aquatint, and also developed a major career of engraving. In the 1840s, his fame seems to have dimmed; he lost most of his political supporters and fell into poverty. By the time of Napoleon III, he took part in the failed coup d'√©tat of Strasbourg. He experienced a short return of glory towards the beginning of the Second French Empire, as he was awarded the Legion of honour in 1852 by vice admiral Bergeret and the Emperor himself. Garneray: View of Genoa (ca 1810) Developing a tremor which prevented him from writing and which complicated his work as a painter, he died in Paris in 1857, a few months only before his wife was mysteriously assassinated. Garneray was buried at the Montmartre cemetery: A close friend of his had the tombstone decorated with a painter's palette, a ship mast and the Legion of Honour.  Paintings  The pictorial work of Garneray comprises 141 oil paintings, 176 engravings and 22 watercolour paintings. Part of his work was inspired by his adventurous life, such as the capture of Kent by Surcouf; others were made as peintre officiel de la Marine, in continuation of the works of Claude Joseph Vernet and Nicolas Ozanne. Most notably, he realised 64 sights of French harbours and 40 sights of foreign harbours (engravings), following the journeys he accomplished in the 1820s. Some of the paintings were given to the Paris Chamber of Commerce by the industrialist Meunier. His two brothers Hippolyte and Auguste, like his sister Pauline, also practised painting to a lesser extent. That explains the variations of signatures (sometimes Garneray, sometimes Garnerey), which were to distinguish the painters of the family. Garneray: Pesche De La Baleine =In literature = Garneray's depictions were mentioned in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick:  Literary works by Garneray  Garneray wrote epic depictions of his adventures, becoming one of the precursors of the maritime novel of adventure. During his stay in Rouen, he published articles about his sailing and captivity days. He offered these texts to the Ministry of Education in 1847 \\"for edification of the youth\\", which politely rebuffed him. His posthumous celebrity stems from the fad of more or less apocryphal memoirs of combatants of Revolution and of Empire which became popular in the 1860s. Garneray's memoirs were published in three volumes as Voyages, Aventures et Combats,Mes Pontons, and Scenes Maritimes. They were probably partly rewritten by professional writers, notably √âdouard Corbi√®re, introducing spectacular but irrealistic elements: * Lhermitte being poisoned in Mauritius, a thesis often repeated in biographies of Lhermitte; in fact, from 1798 until his death, he suffered from a tropical disease, probably an acute form of Malaria. * the obfuscated story of Kernau's death * Garneray being personally involved in incidents which he probably described without being an actor, like the shipwreck of the Amphitrite Richard Rose's detailed analysis of the materials used in the writing of Mes Pontons (The Floating Prison 2003, 2012) shows the general unreliability of Garneray as a writer of verifiable history. Hence, his memoirs are not now considered to be a serious historical source. However, Sentant fort le goudron and Mes Pontons do constitute testimonies of everyday life in the navy of the time.

It formed the terminus of a North British Railway branch line from Edinburgh Waverley. The station was built on a large scale, and it included a trainshed over the platforms. Following the amalgamation of the City of Edinburgh and the Burgh of Leith in 1920, the two formerly separate tram systems were joined (including the conversion of Edinburgh's system from cable haulage to electricity). The improved services provided intense competition with the railway, affecting the viability of Leith Central station. Until 1952 Leith Central had a regular passenger service to Edinburgh. Description of original station The most striking feature of Leith Central Station was its size. The station occupied a whole town block at the foot of Leith Walk, being bounded by Leith Walk on the western side; Easter Road on the east and Duke Street to the north. The four platforms were positioned around fifteen feet above street level, with the buffer stops being at the western end. On this, the Leith Walk side, the station was entered by doors on the corner of Duke Street, leading to stairs up to the ticket office, waiting rooms and other passenger facilities, which were situated at platform level, one storey above the street. Below these consisted of series of retail premises on the Leith Walk and Duke Street sides of the Foot of the Walk, most notably the Central Bar, which still exists. At the eastern side, the station was still as high above street level, however, the four platforms and many sidings contained within the station narrow to cross Easter Road on a four-track bridge. Before crossing Easter Road, the train sheds finished just before the platform ends, around from Easter Road. Between the glass panelled gable end of the train shed and the Easter Road bridge was located Leith Central signal box, controlling the approach to the station, most notably the three scissors crossings at the station mouth. Also provided at the Easter Road end of the station was an additional entrance. From almost underneath the Easter Road bridge, access was gained to the platforms by way of two stairways, meaning passengers did not have to make the long trip from the bottom of Easter Road to the foot of Leith Walk to catch their train. The station is of similar scale to the Caledonian Railway's Princes Street railway station. It is generally believed that it was the threat of this railway company's ambitious plans to complete a circular route of North Edinburgh by building an extension to its existing Newhaven branch via Leith and an extensive tunnel under Calton Hill and under George Street back to Princes Street Station which led to the construction of Leith Central. The size of the completed station was therefore a symbol of the might of the North British, and an indication to the Caledonian of its dominance in Leith. Reuse as a DMU depot Following closure to passengers, the station was adapted to become a motive power depot (MPD) for the new Swindon-built Inter City Diesel multiple unit train sets used on express services (from 1956) between Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Queen Street. By the beginning of the 1970s the Inter City units were becoming unreliable and in May 1971 they were replaced by trains consisting of 6 coaches worked in top 'n tail mode by a pair of Class 27 locomotives. This change rendered Leith Central redundant as a depot. It was finally closed completely in 1972 and became derelict. In the 1980s the derelict station was notorious as a haven for drug addicts, and this inspired a key scene in Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh. The character Begbie is in the station for that purpose, when from the shadows an alcoholic tramp jeers that he must be there for train-spotting. Begbie realises that the tramp is his father. The large train-shed was subsequently demolished and all that remains is the terminal building and clock tower. Remains Supermarket built on the site of the railway station on Duke Street The site of the station currently houses a children's soft-play centre, formerly Leith Waterworld, and a supermarket. The buildings which housed the station offices, waiting room etc. the station clock and the shops at street level all still stand at the foot of Leith Walk. A tenement block on the opposite side of Easter Road which was demolished as part of the construction of the station has now been replaced by modern housing.

The largest of the series, it was designed for long-distance flights. It was completed in 1920 but never flew, crashing on its initial takeoff. Design and development Lawson Midnight AirlinerAfter Alfred Lawson completed his 2000-mile Lawson L-2 flight, the Lawson Airplane Company built the Lawson Midnight Liner for use on the night service between Chicago and New York. The Midnight Liner was larger with three 400-hp Liberty engines ‚Äì one on each wing and another in the nose. The airliner sported sleeping berths and a shower. It was his objective to produce large number of these aircraft to outfit his airline, but the 1920 recession deprived Lawson of the investment funds to meet payroll and other development expenses. The first and only Lawson Midnight Liner was completed on December 9, 1920. Bad weather, however, delayed its maiden flight. As Lawson's financial situation worsened, he decided to fly his new airliner from a space near the factory, rather than make a costly ground transport move to Hamilton Field (now Gen. Mitchell Field). The prepared strip was only about 300 feet long. Lawson finally gave the order to attempt flight on May 8. The aircraft did not clear an elm tree and crashed on takeoff. The pilots were unhurt but the airliner was never repaired. Lawson had a 100-passenger, double-deck version on the drafting board, but the Lawson Midnight Liner was the last. The company folded in 1922, and the assets were auctioned off. The Lawson Air Liners are renowned due to their size (for the time) and the ambition of their flamboyant promoter.

His dam Likely Exchange was a female-line descendant of Strange Device, a half-sister to the Kentucky Oaks winner Mars Shield. Bred by Pamela Firman and her nephew, G. Watts Humphrey, Jr., Creme Fraiche was originally sent as a yearling colt to the 1983 Fasig-Tipton Kentucky July sale, where he was sold to Brushwood Stable for $160,000. He was sent from there to Virginia's Hickory Tree Stable for breaking where he proved unruly and was gelded. Racing career Although thought to be a \\"late bloomer\\", Creme Fraiche was a hardy three-year-old, winning the Derby Trial and the Belmont Stakes, with Eddie Maple astride, becoming the first gelding to win the classic race and the fourth consecutive Belmont winner for his trainer, Woody Stephens. By the end of his three-year-old season, he had five graded stakes wins. As a four-year-old, Creme Fraiche won the Jockey Club Gold Cup, defeating Turkoman, and ended the year with almost $1 million in additional earnings. At five, he again won the Jockey Club Gold Cup (beating Java Gold) as well as the Meadowlands Handicap, and finished that year with a career high of $1,323,666 in earnings. At six, he won both the January and December Tropical Park Handicap but never won another graded race again, with a third at age six in the W. L. McKnight Handicap as his best effort.

It combines the traditional intuition of classical control methods, such as Bode's sensitivity integral, with H-infinity optimization techniques to achieve controllers whose stability and performance properties hold despite bounded differences between the nominal plant assumed in design and the true plant encountered in practice. Essentially, the control system designer describes the desired responsiveness and noise-suppression properties by weighting the plant transfer function in the frequency domain; the resulting 'loop-shape' is then 'robustified' through optimization. Robustification usually has little effect at high and low frequencies, but the response around unity-gain crossover is adjusted to maximise the system's stability margins. H-infinity loop-shaping can be applied to multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. H-infinity loop-shaping can be carried out using commercially available software.The MathWorks, Inc. Synthesizing Robust Multivariable Controllers . Retrieved September 16, 2007. H-infinity loop-shaping has been successfully deployed in industry. In 1995, R. Hyde, K. Glover and G. T. Shanks published a paperComputing and Control Engineering Journal, 6(1):11‚Äì16 describing the successful application of the technique to a VTOL aircraft. In 2008, D. J. Auger, S. Crawshaw and S. L. Hall published another paperProceedings of the UKACC International Conference on Control 2008 describing a successful application to a steerable marine radar tracker, noting that the technique had the following benefits: * Easy to apply - commercial software handles the hard math. * Easy to implement - standard transfer functions and state-space methods can be used. * Plug and play - no need for re-tuning on an installation-by-installation basis. A closely related design methodology, developed at about the same time, was based on the theory of the gap metric Optimal robustness in the gap metric, IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 35:673-686, June 1990..

A few weeks later the Royal Navy schooner HMS Cuttle captured Jordan. Jordan was convicted of piracy and executed in Halifax, Nova Scotia. His body was covered in tar and hanged from chains in an iron cage called a gibbet at Black Rock Beach in Point Pleasant as a warning to others.

Plot A recently released psychiatric patient named Tom Sykes creates a home for himself in the attic of the Dreyer family's newly built house. He uses electronic devices to spy on them. Tom murders the Dreyer's beloved dog Rudolph, when Rudolph attempts to defend his family against the titular hider. After that, Tom starts to focus his attention on the mom, Julie, going so far as to watch her skinny dip in the pool. He interferes secretly in the relationship between Julie and her husband, Phil, planting bogus evidence of secret love affairs. He befriends the Dreyers' son Neal and teaches him fighting techniques. After two explosive arguments, Phil leaves the house and moves into a hotel. Seeing this as an opportunity, Sykes pretends to be a visitor who lives a couple of blocks over. His attempt to insinuate himself into their lives works at first, although the creepy neighbor Gene is the only one who distrusts him. Sykes murders two people who had accidentally discovered his bizarre goings-on and finally Julie becomes sufficiently suspicious to reject his advances. Tom loses it, and he tries to kill Julie. Phil shows up and is severely injured defending her while Julie gets a gun and shoots Tom in the chest. This does not kill him, and Tom gets up and tries to kill both Julie and himself, but the police (summoned by Gene) shoot Tom dead from the doorway.

After a meeting with the psychologist, Gary Busey was excited, saying it was a \\"NAR film.\\" He explained that NAR meant \\"No acting required.\\" Gary said: \\"I am the character!\\" Gary Busey was then involved in a terrible motorcycle accident, where he was not wearing a helmet and got horrible brain damage. This occurred five days after principal photography wrapped on Hider in the House. Writing Hider in the House was the directorial debut of Matthew Patrick, who also reworked the film's script. One of the main things that was changed was that Tom Sykes, the main character and primary antagonist of the film, was originally more sympathetic. The original script showed that he grew up in an abusive household and his actions were motivated by a desperate craving for a family of his own. Because of this, he is unaware of his own strength and if he acts violently, it is done out of fear of a perceived threat. The film is not very graphic, but is rather driven by suspense. Originally, the film ended with Sykes redeeming himself. After being devastated by rejection of the family, he explodes in fury. However, before he can complete the destruction of the family, he is struck with a powerful realization: That he is reenacting the abuse that he suffered as a child. This would cause him to break the chain of violence that is usually carried down from generation to generation. It is a seemingly small, but really is a significant victory for this character. This ending has more optimism, for then the movie is about how abused children can overcome their past. It is about finding the love within themselves. In the original ending, Sykes attempted to burn down the house with the family in it, recreating what he did to his abusive family when he was a child. However, when he sees the terrified faces of the family, he realizes that he has become as evil as his parents. Though he has been rejected, he still loves this family. He pushes them out the window to safety. As he watches them kiss and hug each other, Tom realizes he can never be a part of them, and lets the house burn down around him, killing himself. Although the studio was very supportive of the film director Matthew Patrick wanted to make, the studio eventually decided to have a more commercially safe \\"Fatal Attraction\\"-style ending, where Sykes becomes evil beyond redemption, attempts to murder the family and is eventually shot dead. This is eventually what was filmed and put into the film. A couple years later, Matthew Patrick saw the film's executive producer, Steven Reuther, again at the Academy Awards. Reuther said, \\"you know what‚Ä¶ I think you were right‚Ä¶ that would have made a better ending.\\" On this, Patrick said: \\"I really admire Steve, that he could say that.\\" Release The film was scheduled to be released in 1200 theaters in the United States, which was a lot in 1989. Unfortunately, right at this time, Vestron got into difficult financial trouble and the movie was shelved, never receiving a theatrical release in the United States, only at film festivals. The film had a previous distribution agreement, however, that it had to be released theatrically overseas in Europe. They honored it, but just barely. The film only played for a week in a theater before it was pulled. The film received excellent reviews and notices wherever it opened. Later, it was sold to TV, cable and VHS. In 1991, the film was finally released on videocassette by Vestron Video. The film has been released on DVD in the United Kingdom, but as of February 24, 2010, Lions Gate Home Entertainment has yet to announce any plans for a region 1 DVD release. Hider in the House's earnings have never been confirmed. Still, it went on to win the Saturn Award for best home video, which director Matthew Patrick only discovered many years later, after he was on the Director's Guild.

Schubert composed the work in February 1823, perhaps as a response to his illness the year before. It was however not published until 1839, eleven years after his death. It was given the opus number 143 and a dedication to Felix Mendelssohn by its publishers. The D 784 sonata, Schubert's last to be in three movements, is seen by many to herald a new era in Schubert's output for the piano, and to be a profound and sometimes almost obsessively tragic work. Structure Opening of the first movement I. Allegro giusto This movement, in the tonic key of A minor, employs a new, sparse piano texture not found in Schubert's previous works: indeed, over one-fifth of the movement is in bare octaves. Additionally, Schubert also offers a new method of temporal organization to the movement (its tempo and rhythm), and he very unusually does not use much modulation. The first subject's half-note rhythm, with some dotted notes, is related to the first subject of the D 625 sonata. The \\"sigh motive\\" first encountered in bars 2 and 4, (with an accented first note), plays a very important role throughout the movement, both in its accentuation (on the downbeat) and its rhythm (abruptly breaking off on a short note).http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/semiotics/cyber/hat5.html The proliferation of this motive means that rhythm is of key importance for a pianist to maintain coherence throughout the movement. Melodically, the first subject is based around the resolution of the dissonance D‚ÄìE (‚Äì) and the falling third C‚ÄìA. Bar 9 transfers this rhythm to the bass, and uses repeated plagal cadences (iv-i) to evoke the atmosphere of a funeral march. At b.26 the first subject returns, now in fortissimo and being followed by parallel chords in dotted rhythms suggesting the French overture ‚Äì but still ending abruptly on an eighth note on a weak beat. The transition (b.47) to the second subject is accomplished by accelerating the descending-third motive, now B‚ÄìG, and then reinterpreting the B as A and resolving it to B to prepare the arrival of E major, the dominant major, the key where the second subject will be cast (unusual for a minor-key movement). A victorious passage then follows, firmly establishing E major, and seen by Eva Badura-Skoda to express the rhythm and sentiment of the words \\"Non confundar in aeternam\\" (\\"I shall not perish in eternity\\") from the Te Deum.Nineteenth-Century Piano Music, R. Larry Todd, pp.121‚Äì3. The calm, hymn-like second subject then follows, is thematically related to the first subject in rhythm and melody. It contains the same downbeat accentuation, although the abrupt breaking off on a short note is not encountered until the subject begins to break into distinct registers at b.75 (it is nevertheless suggested throughout by the portato indication), allowing sudden fortissimo intrusions in the minor and firmly reestablishing the sigh rhythm. The second subject area is shorter than normal for Schubert movements, which Brian Newbould speculates as being due to its creating \\"such an illusion of space in [its] scarcely-varied somnambulistic tread\\". The development section (b.104ff) is based on various incarnations of the first subject, the second subject, and the dotted rhythm that first appeared at b.27. The key oscillates between the submediant (F major, the key of the Andante), and the subdominant (D minor, which has previously appeared at b.34ff). The recapitulation (b.166ff) is a varied repeat of the exposition, but forgoes the dramatic transition passage that appears at b.47ff at the exposition in favour of a pianissimo resolution of E (D) and C as part of a fully harmonized augmented sixth to the tonic of A major: Robert S. Hatten notes that, in comparison to the \\"heroic\\" and \\"willful\\" transition in the exposition, the recapitulation's transition (b.213ff) is \\"miraculous\\", and it ties into the even calmer mood of the second subject this time. The calmness of the second subject is further ensured by the triplets that only now appear to lessen the impact of the downbeat accent, and the fortissimo intrusions are now followed by diminuendos that suggest that the tragic weight of the sonata is being resolved in this passage. A coda concludes the movement at b.260ff, based on the \\"heroic\\" transition in the exposition, therefore restoring what was initially excluded from the recapitulation. The long-short rhythm then reappears on a tonic pedal in contrasting high and low registers from b.278ff, suggesting once again the calmness of the second theme; but the rude interruption by the descending third in fortissimo at b.286‚Äì9 (albeit now C‚ÄìA) suggest that this calmness may prove to be only temporary. Opening of the second movement II. Andante F major Opening of the third movement III. Allegro vivace A minor Leo Black has commented that Schubert made use of the same rhythm of the 1818 song \\"An den Mond, in einer Herbstnacht\\" in this sonata's slow movement. In addition, Black has noted that Schubert made a musical allusion in the slow movement of the Arpeggione Sonata to the D. 784 sonata. Notes References * Tirimo, Martino.

It is a specialist Humanities College and has been an academy since October 2012. History Chingford Foundation school (a co-educational all-inclusive school) was opened in 1938, in temporary premises at Hawkwood House in Yardley Lane under the control of Essex County Council, as Chingford County High School. In the following year it was evacuated to the west of England and it did not begin to occupy its present buildings in Nevin Drive until 1941. The school was enlarged in 1957. In 1968, secondary schools in Waltham Forest, to which Chingford had been transferred in 1965, adopted the Comprehensive system. It became Chingford Senior High School with a mixed-ability intake of 14- to 18-year-olds. In the 1980s, pupils aged 11 to 14 studied at Chingford junior high school in Wellington Avenue, which later became a primary school, and then moved to Chingford to senior school to take GCSEs. In the 1980s, pupils aged 11 to 14 studied at Chingford junior high school in Wellington Avenue, which later became a primary school, and then moved to Chingford to senior school to take O levels and later, GCSEs. In the late 80s early 90s, the six form was abolished, and six form pupils moved to either Sir George Monoux college or Leyton sixth form college. Following another borough-wide reorganisation programme in 1986, and a further name change to Chingford School. In 1993, the school became grant maintained, giving the school direct government funding and autonomy from the local authority. This allowed the school to re-establish its sixth form facility, for years 12 and 13. A new Sixth Form Centre was opened in 1997.http://www.chingford- school.co.uk/doc/Prospectus.doc In 2000 the school became a Foundation school, meaning that the school is maintained by the local authority but the governors are responsible for their own admission policy and procedures. The current headteacher of the school is Ms Jane Benton who took control replacing Mr Morall in 2019. Between July 2006 and July 2007 the school had extensive building works, in which a new sports hall and staff room were built. Since converting to an academy, the school is now run by the Chingford Academies Trust, which also includes South Chingford Foundation School. Notable alumni *Brian Altman, barrister.

A main title can consist of a tune sung by the leading character over the credits, such as Moon River, sung by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's, or the main orchestral theme as written by the composer, such as the famous The Pink Panther Theme. It can also be a medley of themes from the film, as in the 1959 Ben-Hur. In the film A Hard Day's Night, the title tune was heard over the opening credits showing The Beatles running from their fans. An overture may serve as a main title, as in The Sound of Music. However, there is a very strong difference in a roadshow theatrical release between an overture and a main title. The overture in such films is heard on pre-recorded tape or film, before the film even begins, while the house lights are still up and there is yet no picture on the screen. The main title begins when the film actually starts. In the case of The Sound of Music though (and also Fiddler on the Roof), no overture was heard before the lights in the theatre went down; therefore, in these cases, the main title did serve as an overture. Both films had pre-credits opening sequences; during these, the first song from the film was sung, and immediately afterwards, the main title music followed.

The route connects the cities of Rochester, Worthington, Albert Lea, and Austin. The city of Winona is also in close proximity to I-90, with about between the Interstate and the city. Route description I-90 enters the state from South Dakota near Beaver Creek. This part of Minnesota has flat to gently rolling terrain and is the beginnings of corn belt farmland. The flat terrain is often subject to blowing and drifting snow in colder months, and the western portions of the highway are closed multiple times each winter. Rock County, where I-90 enters Minnesota, is one of the only counties in the state lacking a natural lake. The change from semi-arid to a wetter climate happens slowly moving eastbound on I-90 through southern Minnesota. The route passes through the cities of Luverne, Adrian, Worthington, Jackson, Fairmont, and Blue Earth. I-90 has an interchange with I-35 at Albert Lea. East of the city of Austin, I-90 changes direction slightly and heads towards Rochester, and the route enters a much more hilly landscape. This is the driftless area of southeast Minnesota. Unlike the rest of the state, where the most recent glaciations left terrain that is either flat or rolling under a deposit of glacial till, this area escaped the most recent glaciation. The bedrock to the top of the I-90 road cuts is noticeable at this point. The other notable feature of this area are deep, steep valleys cut by water that poured through this area as the ice cap melted. The I-90 Bridge between La Crosse, Wisconsin and Dresbach, Minnesota I-90 drops into the scenic Mississippi River valley just west of Dresbach. The carriageways split apart as they descend, and they rejoin west of the junction with U.S. Highway 61. I-90 then parallels the Mississippi River before turning east and crossing into Wisconsin. I-90 is atypical in that just across the Minnesota / Wisconsin state line, (immediately west of the community of Dakota) the median is wide enough that farms exist between the road beds. Legally, the Minnesota section of Interstate 90 is defined as unmarked Legislative Route 391 in the Minnesota Statutes. Interstate 90 is not marked with this legislative number along the actual highway. History Golden Spike Rest Area near the I-90 midpoint Interstate 90 in Minnesota was authorized as part of the original interstate network in 1956. The first section of I-90 in Minnesota constructed was the bypass of Austin in 1961. The wayside rest area near Blue Earth, Minnesota, is where the east-building I-90 and west-building I-90 teams linked up in 1978, thus completing construction in Minnesota and joining the 3,099.07 miles of the interstate. Plaques dedicating the pavement completion and describing the significance of this segment are on display at the rest area. I-90 in Minnesota closely follows the route of old U.S. Highway 16 over most of its route except from just east of Austin, where I-90 turns toward Rochester and is constructed on a new alignment not previously covered by a highway. The section of I-90 east of Rochester was constructed just south of U.S. Highway 14 and south of the city of Winona. I-90 served as a replacement for old U.S. 16 between the South Dakota state line and I-90's interchange with present-day State Highway 16 at Dexter.

The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places and was made a National Historic Landmark in 1978. and History =Previous flagship locations= 14th Street, designated a NYC landmark in 2012alt=left Macy's was founded by Rowland Hussey Macy, who between 1843 and 1855 opened four retail dry goods stores, including the original Macy's store in downtown Haverhill, Massachusetts, established in 1851 to serve the mill industry employees of the area. They all failed, but he learned from his mistakes. He moved to New York City in 1858 and established a new store named \\"R.H Macy Dry Goods\\" at Sixth Avenue on the corner of 14th Street. On the company's first day of business on October 28, 1858, sales totaled $11.08, equivalent to $ today. From the very beginning, Macy's logo has included a star in one form or another, echoing a red star-shaped tattoo that Macy got as a teenager when he worked on a Nantucket whaling ship.Stephen Evans, \\"The death of the department store\\", BBC News, March 1, 2005 As the business grew, Macy's expanded into neighboring buildings, opening more department stores, and used publicity devices such as a store Santa Claus, themed exhibits, and illuminated window displays to draw in customers., pp.945-946 The store later moved to 18th Street and Broadway, on the \\"Ladies' Mile\\", the elite shopping district of the time, where it remained for nearly forty years. In 1875, Macy took on two partners, Robert M. Valentine (1850‚Äì1879), a nephew; and Abiel T. La Forge (1842‚Äì1878) of Wisconsin, who was the husband of a cousin. Macy died just two years later in 1877 from Bright's disease, The following year La Forge died and Valentine died in 1879. Ownership of the company was passed down through the Macy family until 1895, when the company, now called \\"R. H. Macy & Co.\\", was acquired by Isidor Straus and his brother Nathan Straus, who had previously held a license to sell china and other goods in the Macy's store. =Relocation= alt=In 1902, the flagship store moved uptown to Herald Square at 34th Street and Broadway, so far north of the other main dry goods emporia that it had to offer a steam wagonette to transport customers from 14th Street to 34th Street.Abelson, Elaine S. \\"R. H. Macy\\" in , p.1102 Although the Herald Square store initially consisted of just one building, it expanded through new construction, eventually occupying almost the entire block bounded by Seventh Avenue on the west, Broadway on the east, 34th Street on the south and 35th Street on the north, with the exception of a small pre-existing building on the corner of 35th Street and Seventh Avenue and another on the corner of 34th Street and Broadway. Robert H. Smith purchased this latter 5-story building in 1900 for $375,000 () with the idea of getting in the way of Macy's becoming the largest store in the world: it is largely supposed that Smith, who was a neighbor of the Macy's store on 14th Street, was acting on behalf of Siegel- Cooper, which had built what they thought was the world's largest store on Sixth Avenue in 1896. Macy's ignored the tactic, and simply built around the building, which now carries Macy's \\"shopping bag\\" sign by lease arrangement. That building earned the name Million Dollar Corner when it was finally sold for a then record $1 million on December 6, 1911. The original Broadway store was designed in 1901-1902 by architects Theodore de Lemos and A. W. Cordes under their architecture firm De Lemos & Cordes and was erected by the Fuller Construction Company. It has a Palladian facade, but has been updated in many details. Other additions to the west were completed in 1924 and 1928, and the Seventh Avenue building in 1931, all designed by architect Robert D. Kohn, the newer buildings becoming increasingly Art Deco in style., pp.225-226 The store boasts several wooden escalators still in operation. = Renovations = The building in 2018 In 2012, Macy's began the first full renovation of the flagship store at a reported cost of $400 million. Studio V Architecture, a New York-based firm, was the overall master plan architect of the project, with Kevin Kennon Architects providing the exterior and entry way designs. The renovations completed in November 2015 but Macy's continues to modify the store to suit changing customer tastes and maximize return on the real estate. In 2016, the company explored adding one or two towers to the building to house hotel or office space.The next year, it considered turning the structure's roof into a park. Macy's unveiled plans in 2019 to build a office building atop the existing store. The following February, the plans were updated: the store would be over tall and consist of of space, including a sky lobby. The tower's construction would also include improvements to the nearby area. = Incidents = In August 2014, Macy's agreed to a $650,000 penalty proposed by the New York Attorney General to settle a number of claims of racial profiling and false detention involving nearly two dozen African- American, Latino and other customers at the Herald Square store, who had lodged complaints in February 2013. As part of the deal, the retail group agreed to introduce policies to ensure all customers were treated equally regardless of race or ethnicity. On June 1‚Äì2, 2020, during the George Floyd protests in New York City, \\"hundreds\\" of people looted Macy's Herald Square as part of a series of looting incidents around Midtown Manhattan. The store had been boarded up on May 31 in advance of the protests, but looters took the boards apart. Though physical damage was limited, The New York Times reported that it was symbolic of Macy's financial troubles, which had resulted after the location was forced to close during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Events Every year, Macy's is noted for its elaborate animated holiday and Christmas window displays in many locations across the U.S., but most notably at the Herald Square location. Each year presents a different theme shown in six windows on the Broadway side of the building. Each window includes animated displays with complex scenery, attracting thousands of people to view them. Since 2012, the windows have been designed, fabricated and animated by Standard Transmission Productions, located in Red Hook, Brooklyn. In 2007, Macy's launched a curated public art exhibition at the Herald Square flagship using its windows as a means to display pieces from several fashion designers including Misaki Kawai, Anna Sui and John F. Simon Jr.. The exhibit was titled Art Under Glass and was viewable to the public during the summer of 2007 through that year's fashion week.

Sea turtles are a charismatic megafauna and are used as symbols of the marine environment and environmentalism. As a result of its role as a slow, peaceful creature in culture, the turtle can be misconceived as a sedentary animal; however, many types of turtle, especially sea turtles, frequently migrate over large distances in oceans.Plotkin, Pamela, T., 2007, Biology and Conservation of Ridley Sea Turtles, Johns Hopkins University, . In mythology, legends, and folklore A bas-relief from Angkor Wat, Cambodia, shows Samudra manthan- Vishnu in the center and his turtle Avatar Kurma below The tortoise is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge, and is able to defend itself on its own. It personifies water, the moon, the Earth, time, immortality, and fertility. Creation is associated with the tortoise and it is also believed that the tortoise bears the burden of the whole world. The turtle has a prominent position as a symbol of steadfastness and tranquility in religion, mythology, and folklore from around the world. A tortoise's longevity is suggested by its long lifespan and its shell, which was thought to protect it from any foe. In the cosmological myths of several cultures a World Turtle carries the world upon its back or supports the heavens. The mytheme of a World Tortoise, along with that of a world-bearing elephant, was discussed comparatively by Edward Burnett Tylor (1878:341). Turtles were presented in rock art.:File:Rock- painting-turtle.jpg For alchemists, the tortoise symbolizes chaos, or massa confusa. = Africa = Human figure squatting on a turtle, Africa, 19th century In African fairy tales, the tortoise is the cleverest animal. Mzee (Swahili for \\"wise old man\\") is the name of a 130-year-old Aldabra tortoise. In the southern part of Africa, storytales about a tortoise named Fudukazi are common. Fudukazi gave the animals their color.  Nigeria  Ijapa the tortoise (alternatively called Alabahun) is a trickster, accomplishing heroic deeds or getting into trouble in a cycle of tales told by the Yoruba of Nigeria and Benin Republic (West Africa). Also known as \\"Mbe Nwa Aniga\\" (literally translating to \\"Tortoise son of Aniga\\") in folklore among the Igbo people of Nigeria, depicted as slow but smart manipulator able to figure a way out of every dicey situation. = Ancient Egypt = Turtle \\"Shetyw\\", \\"Shetw\\", \\"Sheta\\", \\"shtyw\\" was common in Ancient Egyptian Art (especially Predynastic and Old Kingdom art). Turtle fossils are the most common reptiles found in the Fayoum, including Gigantochersina ammon, a tortoise as large as those living on the Galapagos Islands today. Charles Andrews was the first to write in the West about these tortoises in the early 20th century. Predynastic slate palettes represent freshwater (soft carapace, Trionyx triunguis) turtles as does the hieroglyph for \\"turtle\\" in which the chelonian is always represented from above. Zoomorphic palettes were commonly made in the shapes of turtles. A stone vase in the form of a turtle was found in Naqada. Other art representations of turtles in Ancient Egypt were common. The earliest representations of the Nile turtle date back to pre-dynastic times and were associated with magical significance that was meant to ward off evil. Amulets and objects with depictions of the turtles represent the turtle as a force to defend health and life. Among Ptah's many creatures, Shetw (Tortoise, Turtle) was neither especially remarkable nor esteemed. Though excluded from lists of animal offerings to the deities, there are nevertheless great quantities of turtle and tortoise bones associated with archaeology at the great ceremonial complex at Heirakonpolis in Upper Egypt. This may suggests that sacrifices of Chelonians served some ritual or liturgical purpose within the ancient Egyptian ceremonial system. As an aquatic animal, the turtle was associated with the Underworld.Turtle headed watery messenger of Osiris The turtle was associated with Set, and so with the enemies of Ra who tried to stop the solar barque as it traveled through the underworld. Since the XIXth Dynasty, and particularly in the Late and Greco-Roman periods, turtles were known to have been ritually speared by kings and nobles as evil creatures. The famous Hunters Palette shows most of the hunters carrying a kind of shield which was interpreted as a turtle-carapace shield. In an Early Dynastic tomb at Helwan a man was buried beneath the carapace of a tortoise who had lost his feet in an accident. The carapace may symbolize the \\"way in which the owner used to move slowly like a tortoise,\\" or sitting in the carapace may have been a very useful way for the owner to move around. The Medical Ebers Papyrus cites the use of turtle carapaces and organs in some formulas, including one formula for the removal of hair. An ointment made from the brain of a turtle was the treatment for squinting.Ophthalmology in Ancient Egypt Parts of turtles were used to grind eye paint, which was applied both as a cosmetic and to protect eyes from infection and over-exposure to sun, dust, wind, and insects.Photo of Turtle Palette The flesh of Trionyx was eaten from Predynastic times to as late as the Old Kingdom, and later the flesh of turtles began to be considered an \\"abomination of Ra\\" and the role of these animals became an evil one. Turtle carapaces and scutes from Red Sea Turtles (Chelonia Imbricata) were used in rings, bracelets, dishes, bowls, knife hilts, amulets, and combs. Land tortoise carapaces from Kleinmann's tortoise were used as sounding boards for lutes, harps and mandolins. Turtle shells were also used to make norvas, an instrument resembling a banjo. An example of a Zoomorphic palette, a turtle. In a meticulously documented discussion, Fischer traces the Nile turtle's decline in popularity as food, showing that while eaten in Predynastic, Archaic, and Old Kingdom periods, turtles were used only for medicinal purposes after the Old Kingdom. Carapaces were used well into the New Kingdom.Ancient Egyptian Representations of Turtles book In reliefs and paintings of the Old, Middle, and Early New Kingdoms, the turtle is depicted rarely, and is depicted as an innocuous reptile. After Dynasty XIX, the turtle is usually depicted as a malignant creature associated with Apophis and subject to ritual extermination. Fischer shows that in Predynastic and Archaic times, objects of daily use, such as cosmetic palettes, dishes, and vessels, were made in the shapes of turtles, while after the Old and Middle Kingdoms representations of turtles are more often found on amuletic objects and furniture. After the Middle Kingdom, the turtle's shape is very rarely associated with any object which would come into close contact with a person, a fact which reflects the increasing explicit hostility shown to turtles in scenes and texts. = Ancient Mesopotamia = In ancient Mesopotamia, the turtle was associated with the god Enki and was used on kudurrus as one of Enki's symbols. In the myth of Ninurta and the Turtle, Enki thwarts an attempt by the god Ninurta to seize absolute power by creating a giant turtle and releasing it behind Ninurta, so it bites the hero's ankle. As they struggle, the turtle digs a pit with its claws, which both of them fall into. Enki gloats over Ninurta's defeat. The heron and the turtle is an ancient Sumerian story that has survived to this day. =Ancient Greece and Rome= One of Aesop's fables is The Tortoise and the Hare. The tortoise was the symbol of the ancient Greek city of Aegina, on the island by the same name: the seal and coins of the city shows images of tortoises. The word Chelonian comes from the Greek Chelone, a tortoise god. The tortoise was a fertility symbol in Greek and Roman times, and an attribute of Aphrodite/Venus. Aphrodite Ourania, is draped rather than nude Aphrodite with her foot resting on a tortoise at Mus√©e du Louvre. The playwright Aeschylus was said to have been killed by a tortoise dropped by a bird.

China  bixi holding Kangxi Emperor's stele near Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing, China Zhenwu painted statue with turtle and snake at feet In China the traditional Chinese character symbolizing the turtle (Èæú) shows a head like that of a snake at the top, to the middle left of the paws, to the middle right of the shell, and at the bottom of the tail. According to the \\"Book of ceremonies\\", the white tiger, phoenix, tortoise, and dragon are the four entities that possess spirit. Tortoise shells were used for divination during the ancient Chinese Shang Dynasty and carry the earliest specimens of Chinese writing. Some Chinese are of the opinion that their script was taken from the signs on the back of the tortoise. For the Chinese, the tortoise is sacred and symbolizes longevity, power, and tenacity. It is said that the tortoise helped Pangu (also known as P'an Ku) create the world: the creator goddess Nuwa or Nugua cuts the legs off a sea turtle and uses them to prop up the sky after Gong Gong destroys the mountain that had supported the sky. The flat plastron and domed carapace of a turtle parallel the ancient Chinese idea of a flat earth and domed sky.Allan, Sarah, 1991, The Shape of the Turtle: Myth, Art, and Cosmos in Early China, SUNY Press, . For the Chinese as well as the Indians, the tortoise symbolizes the universe. Quoting Pen T'sao, \\"the upper dome-shaped part of its back has various signs, which correspond with the constellations on the sky, and this is Yan; the lower part has many lines, which relate to the earth and is the Yin. The tortoise is one of the \\"Four Fabulous Animals\\", the most prominent beasts of China. These animals govern the four points of the compass, with the Black Tortoise the ruler of the north, symbolizing endurance, strength, and longevity.Simoons, Frederick J., 1991, Food in China: A Cultural and Historical Inquiry, CRC Press, . The tortoise and the tiger are the only real animals of the four, although the tortoise is depicted with supernatural features such as dragon ears, flaming tentacles at its shoulders and hips, and a long hairy tail representing seaweed and the growth of plant parasites found on older tortoise shells that flow behind the tortoise as it swims. The Chinese believe that tortoises come out in the spring when they change their shells, and hibernate during the winter, which is the reason for their long life. The Chinese Imperial Army carried flags with images of dragons and tortoises as symbols of unparalleled power and inaccessibility, as these animals fought with each other but both remained alive. The dragon cannot break the tortoise and the latter cannot reach the dragon. In China, the tortoise was also called the Black warrior, standing as a symbol of power, tenacity, and longevity, as well as that of north and winter. A tortoise was often put at the base of burial monuments. Legend holds that the wooden columns of the Temple of Heaven in Beijing were built on the shells of live tortoises since people thought that these animals were capable of living for more than 3000 years without food or water and are adorned with a magical power that prevents wood from rotting. It was considered that the tortoise does not remember the day and month of its birth so calling someone a \\"tortoise\\" in China was considered offensive. In Tibet, the tortoise is a symbol of creativity. The tortoise is of the feng shui water elementMoran, Elizabeth, Biktashev, Val and Yu, Joseph, 2002, Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui, Alpha Books, . with the tiger, phoenix, and dragon representing the other three elements. According to the principles of feng shui the rear of the home is represented by the Black Tortoise, which signifies support for home, family life, and personal relationships. A tortoise at the back door of a house or in the backyard by a pond is said to attract good fortune and many blessings. Three tortoises stacked on top of each other represent a mother and her babies. In Daoist art, the tortoise is an emblem of the triad of earth-humankind-heaven.Tresidder, Jack, 2005, The Complete Dictionary of Symbols, Chronicle Books, . The tortoise is a symbol of longevity, with a potential lifespan of ten thousand years. Due to its longevity, a symbol of a turtle was often used during burials. A burial mound might be shaped like a turtle, and even called a \\"grave turtle.\\" A carved turtle, known as bixi was used as a plinth for memorial tablets of high- ranking officials during the Sui Dynasty (581-618 CE) and the Ming periods (1368-1644 CE). Enormous turtles supported the memorial tablets of Chinese emperors and support the Kangxi Emperor's stele near Marco Polo Bridge in Beijing, China. Tortoise shells were used for witchcraft and future forecasting. There are innumerable tales on the longevity of the tortoises and their ability to transform into other forms.  India  In Hindu mythology the world is thought to rest on the backs of four elephants who stand on the shell of a turtle.Cobb, Kelton, 2005, The Blackwell Guide to Theology and Popular Culture, Blackwell Publishing, . In Hinduism, Akupara is a tortoise who carries the world on his back, upholding the Earth and the sea. One Avatar of Vishnu is the giant turtle Kurma. The Sri Kurmam Temple in Andhra Pradesh, India, is dedicated to the Kurma avatar. Kurmavatara is also Kasyapa, the northern star, the first living being, forefather of Vishnu the protector. The plastron symbolizes the earthly world and the carapace the heavenly world. The Shatapatha Brahmana identifies the world as the body of Kurmaraja, the \\"king of tortoises\\", with the earth its plastron, the atmosphere its body, and the vault of the heavens its carapace. The tortoise holds the elephant, on which rests the earth. The elephant is the masculine symbol and the tortoise the feminine.  Japan  Japanese Edo period depiction of a minogame. Japanese culture adopted from China the myth of four Guardian Beasts, said in Japan to protect the city of Heian (Kyoto) from threats arising from each of the four cardinal directions. The Black Tortoise or Gen-bu, sometimes depicted as a combination of a tortoise and a snake, protects Kyoto from the north; the other beasts and associated directions are the Azure Dragon (Sei-ryu, east), the Vermilion Bird (Su-zaku, south), and the White Tiger (Byak-ko, west). In Japan, however, the turtle has developed a more independent tradition than the other three prominent beasts of China. The , which is so old it has a train of seaweed growing on its back, is a symbol of longevity and felicity. A minogame has an important role in the well-known legend of Urashima Tar≈ç. According to traditional Japanese beliefs, the tortoise is a haven for immortals and the world mountain, and symbolizes longevity, good luck, and support. It is the symbol of Kompira, the god of seafaring people. The tortoise is a favored motif by netsuke-carvers and other artisans, and is featured in traditional Japanese wedding ceremonies. There is also a well-known artistic pattern based on the nearly hexagonal shape of a tortoise's shell. These patterns are usually composed of symmetrical hexagons, sometimes with smaller hexagons within them.Niwa, Motoji, 2001, trans, Thomas, Jay W., Snow, Wave, Pine: Traditional Patterns in Japanese Design, .  Vietnam  VƒÉn Mi·∫øu in Hanoi, Vietnam. Many legends of Vietnam connect closely to the turtle. During the time of Emperor Yao in China, a Vietnamese King's envoy offered a sacred turtle (Vietnamese: Th·∫ßn Quy) which was carved in Khoa ƒê·∫©u script on its carapace writing all things happening from the time Sky and Earth had been born.

People buy these cakes at their lineage temple and take them home to assure prosperity, harmony, and security for the following year. = North America = The World Turtle carries the Earth upon its back in myths from North America; for this reason many aboriginal North Americans refer to it as Turtle Island. To some Native American tribes, the turtle is a symbol of the mother of the Earth. Most turtles have 13 scales, or scutes, on the backs of their shells. For Native Americans, these scutes represented the 13 full moons in each year. In addition, on the very outer rim of most turtles‚Äô shells, there are 28 smaller scutes. In Native American culture, these 28 sections represented the 28 days of the lunar month. Thus, turtles were considered to have celestial powers, playing a role in the creation of the world. In Cheyenne tradition, the great creator spirit Maheo kneads some mud he takes from a coot's beak until it expands so much that only Old Grandmother Turtle can support it on her back. In Mohawk tradition, the trembling or shaking of the Earth is thought of as a sign that the World Turtle is stretching beneath the great weight that she carries. Native Americans used combs made of tortoise shell to signify the margin between life and death. According to their beliefs, the cosmic tree emerges from the spine of the tortoise. The expression \\"turtles all the way down\\" comes from the notion of the World Turtle. = South America = Moche Sea Turtle. 200 A.D. Larco Museum Collection. Lima, Peru Turtles are beloved by many Indigenous South American cultures and have thus entered their mythologies.

Polynesia In Polynesia the tortoise personified the war god Tu. Drawing tattoo marks of a tortoise was a custom among warriors. In a story from Admiralty Island, people are born from eggs laid by the World Turtle. There are many similar creation stories throughout Polynesia. =Islam= In Sufism the hatching and return of baby turtles to the sea is a symbol for returning to God through God's guidance.Feild, Reshad Feild, 2002, The Last Barrier: A Journey into the Essence of Sufi Teachings, Publisher: Lindisfarne Books, . There are Quranic verses related to turtles such as \\"Extol the name of your Lord, the Highest, who has created and regulated, and has destined and guided\\" [87:1-3]. =Judaism= According to the laws of Kashrut (Kosher), the turtle is considered \\"impure\\" and cannot be eaten. Back when the Jews still had the temple, when a woman completed her period, she had to give two pigeons and two turtles to a Kohen, a priest. The exact passage from the Torah is: In this case, however, the \\"turtle\\" referred to is a \\"turtle-dove,\\" a kosher bird, and not a reptile. Reptiles, according to Leviticus, are never kosher for eating or for sacrifice. Tortoises were regarded as unclean and often symbolized evil and darkness: ‚ÄúThere also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth: the weasel, and the mouse, and the tortoise after his kind‚Äù (Leviticus 11: 29) = Christianity = The attitude that Judaism took towards Chelonians was inherited by the Christians. The early Christian scholar St Jerome (c. AD 342-420) recounted that the tortoise moves sluggishly because it is ‚Äúburdened and heavy with its own weight . . . signifying the grievous sin of the heretics‚Äù. An early Christian curse tablet has been found that addresses ‚Äúthe most unclean spirit of a tortoise‚Äù.

Named Maturin, the turtle is one of the twelve guardians of the beams which hold up the dark tower. There is also a small carving of the turtle which is described as a 'tiny god'. A rhyme is recited by the characters, \\"See the TURTLE of enormous girth, on his shell he holds the Earth.\\" This rhyme and the turtle also show up in King's novel It, where the turtle represents the opposition to the terror that is It. * Turtle is a character who figures prominently in Barbara Kingsolver's novels The Bean Trees and Pigs in Heaven. She is a Cherokee child whose adoptive mother, Taylor Greer, so nicknamed her because Turtle grabs onto Taylor and will not let go. Taylor explains, \\"In Kentucky where I grew up, people used to say if a snapping turtle gets hold of you it won't let go till it thunders.\\" * In the books by Terry Pratchett, the Discworld is carried on the backs of four elephants, who in turn rest on the back of the gigantic world turtle Great A'Tuin. In the Discworld novel Small Gods, the Great God Om manifests as a tortoise. * In The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck uses the tortoise as an emblem of the resolve and persistence of the \\"Okies\\" that travel west across the US for a better life. * Ursula K. Le Guin's novel The Lathe of Heaven introduces a person whose dreams involuntarily become reality. The novel eventually features sea turtle aliens. Children's literature The Mock Turtle from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland There is a character called the Mock Turtle in Lewis Carroll's 1865 novel Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In the illustration by John Tenniel, the Mock Turtle is depicted as a turtle with the head, hooves, and tail of a calf; referencing the real ingredients of mock turtle soup.Reichertz, Ronald, 1997, The Making of the Alice Books, McGill-Queen's Press, . In the children's story, Esio Trot by Roald Dahl, a character named Mrs. Silver has a small pet tortoise, Alfie, who she loves very much. One morning, Mrs. Silver mentions to Mr. Hoppy that even though she has had Alfie for many years, her pet has only grown a tiny bit and has gained only 3 ounces in weight. She confesses that she wishes she knew of some way to make her little Alfie grown into a larger, more dignified tortoise. Mr. Hoppy suddenly thinks of a way to give Mrs. Silver her wish and (he hopes) win her affection. He eventually begins swapping the tortoise for bigger and bigger ones, with the illusion of using magic. In children's literature such as Dr. Seuss's Yertle the Turtle, the turtle is often depicted as a humorous character having a mixture of animal and human characteristics.Goldstein, Jeffrey H., 1994, Toys, Play, and Child Development, Cambridge University Press, . =Film and television= Bert the turtle * The television show Avatar: The Last Airbender features a magical, ancient, island-sized creature called the \\"Lion Turtle\\". The show also features \\"turtle ducks\\" that are kept in the palatial gardens of the Fire Nation. * Duck and Cover was a six-minute civil defense film that starred an animated character called Bert the Turtle. * Gamera, a Japanese movie monster, is the star of eleven films from 1965 to 2006. * Kung Fu Panda, an animated movie, has a turtle spiritual master - Oogway. * The character Rainbow Dash in the show, My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic, has a pet tortoise named Tank. * The TV British sitcom One Foot in the Grave features a tortoise at the start and end of each episode. * The British speculative fiction documentary series, The Future is Wild shows a giant descendant of tortoises called the Toraton. * The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are comic book characters whose adventures have been adapted for TV and film. The main characters, Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo, were named after the four renaissance artists. They were created in 1983.Long, Mark A., 2002, Bad Fads, ECW Press, . They were a cultural phenomenon between 1988 and 1992, with their images ubiquitous in advertising, cinema, comics, magazines, music, newspapers, and television.Jones, Dudley, and Watkins, Tony, 2000, A Necessary Fantasy?: The Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture, Routledge, . Their action figures were top sellers around the world. In 1990, the cartoon series was shown on more than 125 television stations every day and the comic books sold 125,000 copies a month. Their origin ‚Äì flushed down the toilet and ending up in the sewer system ‚Äì echoed contemporary urban legends of small reptiles that were flushed down toilets growing into fierce animals in city sewers. *Sea Turtles are referred to multiple times in the Pirates of the Caribbean films. First mentioned by Gibbs in The Curse of the Black Pearl about how Sparrow managed to escape the island where Barbossa marooned him years ago. It is stated that two turtles were lashed together by Sparrow with human hair from his back to form a raft. This same trait was apparently used by Will in the second film and the Prison Dog in the third one. *In the film Finding Nemo, Marlin (a Clownfish) and Dory (a Regal Blue Tang) are rescued by a school of sea turtles led by surfer-dude Crush. They reappear in the sequel. * A trio of Looney Tunes cartoons depicts Bugs Bunny racing the slow-moving Cecil Turtle in a contemporary version of one of Aesop's fables. The cartoons are Tortoise Beats Hare, Tortoise Wins by a Hare and Rabbit Transit. Because of this trio, Cecil is the only character in the Looney Tunes series who consistently gets the better of Bugs.Lenburg, Jeff, 2006, Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film & Television, Hal Leonard, . * For the Hammer Films production of One Million Years B.C., Ray Harryhausen created and animated a giant version of the prehistoric turtle Archelon, which attacked a group of cavemen. *A running gag in Tomska's asdfmovie web series is a character stepping on a turtle with a button on its back. The turtle then explodes. This turtle has become known as Mine Turtle. *The Red Turtle is a 2016 anime film about a giant red sea turtle that hinders a man's escape attempts from a desolate island. =Video games= * Koopa Troopas (Japanese: „Éé„Ç≥„Éé„Ç≥ Nokonoko) are common enemies in the Mario series which resemble tortoises, usually displayed as henchmen under the direct leadership of Bowser, who is also a Koopa. There are also various other Koopas in the game universe, such as the Koopalings. However, since Nintendo 64, many Koopas are friendly and very peaceful, living in villages like Koopa Village near Toad Town, the capital of Mushroom Kingdom. And one blue-shelled Koopa, Kooper, helps Super Mario in his Adventures against Bowser and his evil henchman. * The Pok√©mon series has a few species resembling turtles or tortoises. Squirtle, Wartortle, and Blastoise are the water-type 'starter' Pok√©mon in the Kanto Region. Turtwig, Grotle, and Torterra are likewise the grass-type starter Pok√©mon of the Sinnoh Region. Shuckle, in the Johto Region, can often be mistaken for a stylised turtle, but is in fact a Mould Pok√©mon. Tirtouga and Carracosta can be revived from Fossils in the Unova Region. Blastoise, the final evolved form of Squirtle, is the mascot of the Pok√©mon Blue video game. In sports The athletic teams of the University of Maryland, College Park are known as the Maryland Terrapins (often shortened to \\"Terps\\") and compete at the highest level of collegiate athletics in the United States. The school mascot is an anthropomorphic diamondback terrapin named \\"Testudo\\" (named after the Latin name for tortoises). Political use A turtle in an American political cartoon poking fun at the Embargo Act of 1807. Various Native American groups use the term \\"Great Turtle Island\\" as an alternate term for America, use of the term implying that the continent in question belongs to its indigenous inhabitants and that its conquest and settlement by Europeans was illegitimate. A post turtle is a reference to a politician who is being manipulated or controlled.

Tourists interact with turtles in countries such as Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Greece, and the United States. Turtle-based ecotourism activities take place on nesting beaches around the world. Sea turtles are on Tuvalu postage stamps as a national symbol. The mascot of the KAME project is a sea turtle. Due to the turtle's status as a charismatic megafauna, it is a flagship animal for conservation efforts. Educating the public about turtles and conserving their habitats can positively affect other species living in the same habitats as turtles. Turtles are also used as marketing tools to give products the appearance of being environmentally friendly. One of the most famous rescued sea turtles was \\"Allie\\", a 250 lb (113 kg), 50-year-old female loggerhead sea turtle rescued by a local commercial fisherman at Alligator Point, Florida, on May 15, 2012. Allie required 14 months of care at Gulf Specimen Marine Laboratory before she was returned to the wild on June 22, 2013. Thousands of people followed her recovery via social media and 1500 people came to see her released at Bald Point State Park, Florida.Nickerson, E. \\"Allie The Sea Turtle Released Into The Wild\\" WCTV2, Tallahassee, Florida, June 22, 2013, retrieved January 30, 2015.Swoboda, L. Day trippers Flock to Turtle Release , Aplalach Times, June 26, 2013 Ecotourism has become popular in Brazil. In Praia do Forte, a marine conservation project called Tamar (from tartaruga marinha or sea turtle) receives more than 300,000 visitors every year, who are attracted by the idea of saving the habitat of five endangered sea turtle species that nest on the coast. Tamar uses the sea turtle as a symbol for the need for the protection of the coastal environment. Turtle- related souvenirs are sold to tourists, and hotels are \\"turtle-friendly\\": low- rise, dimly lit, and located away from the beach.Levine, Robert M., 1999, The History of Brazil, Greenwood Press, . At the World Trade Organization's 1999 meeting in Seattle, sea turtles were a focal point of protests. A group of protesters from the Earth Island Institute that focused on the issue of TED use in shrimp trawls wore sea turtle costumes. They brought 500 turtle costumes to the demonstration.Berg, John C., 2003, Teamsters and Turtles?: U.S. Progressive Political Movements in the 21st Century, Rowman & Littlefield, . Images of protesters wearing turtle costumes were carried in the media, and they became a symbol of the anti-globalization movement. In 2014, a giant inflatable sea turtle called Alphie the Alpha Turtle was displayed in Darling Harbor, Australia. The artist responsible has used the artwork to draw attention to the need to conserve and protect the Great Barrier Reef.  In Chinese slang  Chinese turtle symbol Firstly, tortoises and turtles are regarded as insufficiently virile. ‚ÄúGui tou‚Äù (‚Äúturtle‚Äôs head‚Äù) is a common euphemism for a penis. From this combination turtles are often associated with cuckolds in China. This folk identification may be reinforced by the old Chinese expression \\"to wear a green hat\\" () or \\"to wear a green scarf\\" (), which derives from sumptuary laws of the Spring-Autumn period (5th to 8th Century BCE) and means \\"to be a cuckold.\\" Secondly, \\"sea turtle\\" () is slang for a returnee, a Chinese person who has studied abroad and returned home. (There is also a pun here, as h«éi g≈´i is also Êµ∑ÂΩí, \\"to come back home from overseas\\"). The term has positive connotations, implying a dynamic ability to travel across the ocean. By contrast, \\"kelp\\" (), is used to describe an unemployed returnee. It has negative overtones, implying the person is drifting aimlessly, and is also a homophonic expression (, literally \\"sea waiting\\").

History and development The dialogue between national medical associations and the WHO began in December 1984 with a meeting of western European national medical associations and WHO in Copenhagen. At this time, it was recognized that clearly, the medical profession had an important role to play if the philosophy of the Health For All (HFA) movement in general and the European regional HFA targets, in particular, were to be achieved. Further meetings involving national medical associations, both from the West and East, took place in 1986, 1987 and 1988. At a meeting in Rome in 1990, the national medical associations recognised that they had created a permanent forum permitting a fruitful dialogue with WHO. This was formalized at Helsinki in 1991 when the aims of the Forum were finalized as follows: \\"The aims of the Forum shall be, by establishing a dialogue and cooperation between National Medical Associations and the WHO Regional Office for the European Region, to: a) improve the quality of health and health care in Europe; b) promote the exchange of information and ideas between national medical associations, and between the associations and the World Health Organization; c) integrate appropriate aspects of policies of Health for All into basic, postgraduate and continuing medical education; and d) formulate consensus policy statements on health issues.\\" For the purposes of membership, a national medical association is defined as a free independent nongovernmental association of physicians constituted in an organization, which elect its own officers, appoints its own staff and determines its own constitution, except for any statutory duties that it undertakes, and whose activities cover all the various aspects of professional practice. With the changes in the eastern part of the region during the 1990s, there was a need for special dialogue between the countries of the east of the region and those in the west. In Budapest (1994), London (1995) and Stockholm (1996) post-Forum meetings were held for the benefit of the newly emerging and re-establishing national medical associations from this part of the region. In 1997, this was merged with the main meeting and devoted to a discussion on health care reform, based on the 1996 WHO Ljubljana Charter on Reforming Health Care. In the annual meetings of the Forum, representatives from medical associations in around 40 countries are represented. Observers have included the Canadian Medical Association, which has attended regularly, and a number of Pan-European medical associations. Each year, national medical associations report not only on their general activities but also on any action they have taken in areas which the Forum has considered. A handbook is updated annually containing information about the constitution, activities, and officers of participating national medical associations. From the beginning, the problems of tobacco and smoking and the subject of continuing medical education have been subjects of continuing report and action and, starting in Sofia in 1988, the quality of care. The meetings have considered a spectrum of subjects including AIDS, new patterns of infectious diseases, health care in the elderly, health promotion, the rights of patients, the physician‚Äôs role in environmental health, financing of health care, development of new health care systems, suicide in the young, quality of care development, use/misuse/abuse of drugs, medical education, health care in prisons, and eHealth. Over the years, the Forum has adopted a number of declarations, statements and recommendations. Some of these statements have been followed up by establishing action groups, notably in relation to tobacco and to the quality of care, in order to assist national medical associations in carrying forward appropriate action in their own countries. Annual meetings A meeting of the Forum is organized once a year (normally March or April), to review developments relevant to the medical profession and to exchange experience. In 2006, the meeting was held in Budapest, hosted by the Hungarian Medical Association, and in 2007 in Lisbon, hosted by the Portuguese Medical Association. On 7 September 2007, EFMA Liaison Committee took place in Yerevan, Armenia, hosted by the Armenian Medical Association.http://moked.it/ame/files/2009/11/ima_news_gennaio08.pdf The annual meeting in 2008 took place in Israel on 10‚Äì11 April 2008 and was hosted by the Israel Medical Association. In 2012, EFMA meeting was hosted by the Armenian Medical Association and took place on 19‚Äì20 April 2012 in Yerevan, Armenia. In addition to Health 2020, the financial crisis, social determinants of health and policies on alcohol were on the agenda.

Note that these formulae are well-behaved for all values of the degree and order, except for those with integer values. However, if we examine these formulae for toroidal harmonics, i.e. where the degree is half-integer, the order is integer, and the argument is positive and greater than unity one obtains : P_{m-\\\\frac12}^n(\\\\cosh\\\\eta)=\\\\frac{(-1)^m}{\\\\Gamma(m-n+\\\\frac12)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi\\\\sinh\\\\eta}}Q_{n-\\\\frac12}^m(\\\\coth\\\\eta) and : Q_{m-\\\\frac12}^n(\\\\cosh\\\\eta)=\\\\frac{(-1)^m\\\\pi}{\\\\Gamma(m-n+\\\\frac12)}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2\\\\sinh\\\\eta}}P_{n-\\\\frac12}^m(\\\\coth\\\\eta) .

Santiago studied Literature, Philosophy and Music. From 1959-66 he was assistant director to Robert Bresson. In 1969, he made his first feature film Invasi√≥n in his native Argentina based on an idea by celebrated writers Adolfo Bioy Casares and Jorge Luis Borges, who also co-wrote the script. Adolfo Bioy Casares described the film in May 1969 as follows: > \\"Invasi√≥n modernises the theme of The Iliad: it does not praise the > shrewdness and effectiveness of the conqueror, but rather the courage of a > handful of warriors ready to defend their Troy-which is far too much like > Buenos Aires-where there is always a group of friends and a tango inviting > you to fight for just and noble causes. Homer will forgive me: the heart is > always on the side of those who resist. I believe Hugo Santiago has created > an extraordinary film\\". This was followed by another collaboration with the famed writers Les Autres in 1974. In 1979 he made √âcoute voir... with Catherine Deneuve cast as a female detective investigating a gang looking to control people using radio waves. He returned to Argentina with Les Trottoirs de Saturne a reflection on his own exile in 1986. Prior to his feature film Le Loup de la c√¥te Ouest (2002), a stylish detective thriller, he directed theatrical adaptations for the screen of Sophocles (√âlectre), Bertolt Brecht (La Vie de Galil√©e) and the Opera by Iannis Xenakis (La Geste gibelline). Prior to directing in 1961 he was a choreographer and metteur en scene for Histoire du Soldat at the Stravinsky Festival. He has supported the work of other filmmakers over the years, including producing S√©rail / Surreal Estate by Eduardo de Gregorio (1976) and narrating Ra√∫l Ruiz's Les Trois couronnes du matelot (1983).

Such a union would call for the creation of a new unified currency, similar to the euro; the hypothetical currency is sometimes referred to as the afro or afriq. The Abuja Treaty, an international agreement signed on June 3, 1991, in Abuja, Nigeria, created the African Economic Community, and called for an African Central Bank to follow by 2028. , the plan is to establish an African Economic Community with a single currency by 2023. Regional currency unions There are two existing regional currency unions in Africa, using the West African CFA franc, and the Central African CFA franc, respectively. Additionally, the Common Monetary Area links several countries in southern Africa based on the South African rand. The African Union's plans for further integration encourage the development of more such regional unions as an intermediate step to full monetary union. One proposed union is the eco, a proposed currency for members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS). AFRO prototype art project In 2002, Mansour Ciss and Baruch Gottlieb created a \\"prototype\\" currency, called the AFRO, which they presented at the Dakar Biennale of Contemporary African Art on May 10 . It was designed by Dr. Professor Boamh The project was a response to the perceived lack of independence created by use of the CFA franc. Notes and coins of the imaginary currency were produced, and given away or sold to the people of Dakar and Senegal to encourage them \\"to reflect on the meaning (value) of money and the future of their own local currency\\".The Afro Today Membership In 2015, Anthony Maruping stated that Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi were committed to join a common currency in the next ten years. So far only three of the 53 member states of the African Union have committed to using the currency. Egypt, Eswatini, and Lesotho have logged reservations over the precise date of monetary union and have requested a two- to three-year delay.(According to the BBC on January 3, 2008) Seychelles may not join as a result of economic fears and may, along with Cape Verde, attempt to join the euro at a later date, while the official currency of Mayotte is the euro. African Central Bank The African Central Bank (ACB) is one of the three financial institutions of the African Union. It will over time take over responsibilities of the African Monetary Fund. The creation of the ACB, to be completed by 2028 was first agreed upon in the 1991 Abuja Treaty. The 1999 Sirte Declaration called for a speeding up of this process with creation by 2020. When it is fully implemented via Pan-African Parliament legislation, the ACB will be the sole issuer of the African single currency (African Monetary Union/Afro), will become the banker of the African Government, will be the banker to Africa's private and public banking institutions, will regulate and supervise the African banking industry, and will set the official interest and exchange rates; in conjunction with the African Government's administration. The current timeline established by the Abuja Treaty calls for a single African currency to be instituted by the African Central Bank by 2028. Although some countries have reservations about full economic and monetary union, a number of regional unions already exist, and others are planned. Signatories Signatories to the treaty were all members of the Organisation of African Unity (predecessor of the AU) at the time (Eritrea, South Africa, South Sudan and Morocco have since joined): { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align: center; width:70%;\\" - !

The patch test uses a partial differential equation on a domain consisting from several elements set up so that the exact solution is known and can be reproduced, in principle, with zero error. Typically, in mechanics, the prescribed exact solution consists of displacements that vary as piecewise linear functions in space (called a constant strain solution). The elements pass the patch test if the finite element solution is the same as the exact solution. It was long conjectured by engineers that passing the patch test is sufficient for the convergence of the finite element, that is, to ensure that the solutions from the finite element method converge to the exact solution of the partial differential equation as the finite element mesh is refined. However, this is not the case, and the patch test is neither sufficient nor necessary for convergence. A broader definition of patch test (applicable to any numerical method, including and beyond finite elements) is any test problem having an exact solution that can, in principle, be exactly reproduced by the numerical approximation. Therefore, a finite-element simulation that uses linear shape functions has patch tests for which the exact solution must be piecewise linear, while higher-order finite elements have correspondingly higher-order patch tests.

The band's best-known line-up consisted of singer Germa√≠n de la Fuente, guitarist Mario Guti√©rrez, keyboardist Jorge Gonz√°lez, bassist Miguel √Ångel \\"Nano\\" Concha, and drummer Luis Ortiz. Their music is a blend of boleros, psychedelic funk and rock music, known as Balada rockm√°ntica. The original members of the band included three teenagers and a worker from a local school. After winning a local competition in June 1968, they recorded and released their first single, \\"Porque Te Quiero\\", which attracted the attention of Chile's Odeon Records representatives, urging two of the four members of the band to record an album with three other studio musicians. As a result, they recorded Porque Te Quiero in 1969, and several chart-topping singles across Latin America in the following years. Following De la Fuente's departure from the group, most of the classic band members also left and established bands with similar names, including Germa√≠n y sus √Ångeles Negros and Los √Ångeles de Chile. Guitarist Mario Guti√©rrez continued to work with other musicians under the name of Los √Ångeles Negros. Songs by Los √Ångeles Negros have been covered by singers including Celia Cruz, Raphael, and Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez, while others have been sampled by hip-hop and rap musicians such as Funkdoobiest, Damian Marley, the Beastie Boys, and Jay-Z. History =Formation, radio competition, and the first LP (1968‚Äì1969)= Cristi√°n Blasser and Mario Guti√©rrez, students from the Escuela Consolidada de San Carlos (now Liceo Polit√©cnico de San Carlos), and Sergio Rojas, who worked at the school, formed a band in 1968. Upon hearing an announcement of a bands tournament organized by La Discusi√≥n radio station from Chill√°n, they recruited Germa√≠n de la Fuente, who was well known in the local scene for his vocal abilities. Blasser and Guti√©rrez played the guitar, Rojas the bass, and De la Fuente became the keyboardist and lead vocalist. Most of the band members were musically inspired by acts such as The Beatles except De la Fuente, who did not like them at all and wanted to do bolero music. As a result, they created a mixed style known as the Balada rockm√°ntica or Bolero- beat. Sergio Rojas suggested the band to be named Los √Ångeles Negros (The Black Angels), in reference to another Chilean band called Pat Henry y Los Diablos Azules (Pat Henry and the Blue Devils). Although the band was initially reluctant to use a name in Spanish, they adopted Los √Ångeles Negros after De la Fuente's mother said she liked it. In June 1968 Los √Ångeles Negros won La Discusi√≥n radio station's competition, in which they competed against a band named Los Cangrejo, and received the opportunity to record a single in Sello Indis, an independent label owned by pianist Ra√∫l Lara. They recorded \\"Porque Te Quiero\\"/\\"D√≠a Sin Sol\\", which was released by Indis as a single. After recording the songs in Santiago, the band returned to San Carlos and became a quintet when drummer Federico Blasser joined them. In the meantime, their single received high airplay in some Chilean provinces, and because of De la Fuente's voice, attracted the attention of Jorge O√±ate, the director of Chile's Odeon Records, who asked the band to go to Santiago to record an LP for his record company. However, only De la Fuente and guitarist Mario Guti√©rrez eventually went. O√±ate quickly contacted three studio musicians --drummer Luis Ortiz, keyboardist Jorge Gonz√°lez, and bassist Miguel √Ångel \\"Nano\\" Concha-- with which De la Fuente and Guti√©rrez recorded Los √Ångeles Negros' debut LP, Porque Te Quiero, released in 1969. =Latin American success, and departure of Ort√≠z and De la Fuente (1969-1974)= Following the release of Porque Te Quiero, Guti√©rrez and De la Fuente suggested the studio musicians to stay permanently in the group, a proposal which they accepted. The new band members used to be part of another Chilean group called Los Minim√°s, whose music was influenced by the psychedelic funk, which they incorporated in their next recordings with Los √Ångeles Negros. Later, in October 1969, they recorded and released their second album, Y Volver√©. The record contained songs which helped the band become popular throughout Chile and Latin America, including \\"Y Volver√©\\" (cover version of \\"Emporte-moi\\" by Alain Barri√®re with new lyrics by De la Fuente), \\"Como Quisiera Decirte\\", and \\"Muri√≥ la Flor\\". Los √Ångeles Negros then began a tour in Latin America, visiting countries including Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela, and Argentina. According to Jorge Leiva from the Chilean National Council of Culture and the Arts' website M√∫sica Popular, they performed at \\"stadiums which were full of people, with an unusual media coverage\\". In 1971, they moved to Mexico, where their LP Y Volver√© sold 700,000 copies. The band released seven new LPs between 1970 and 1974: Te Dejo la Ciudad Sin M√≠ (1970), Esta Noche La Paso Contigo (1971), La Cita (1971), El Tren Hacia El Olvido (1972), D√©jenme Si Estoy Llorando (1973), Qu√©date en Mis Sue√±os (1973), and Aplaude Mi Final (1973). Their popularity in Chile decreased, however. Besides the fact that the country was taken control by a Government Junta after the 1973 coup d'√©tat, the musical scene of the time was mostly \\"folkloric\\", with V√≠ctor Jara and Violeta Parra as some prominent figures. The band was also despectively qualified as \\"cebolleros\\" (drama queens). The internal relationship of the band was deteriorated, which concluded with the departure of Ortiz from Los √Ångeles Negros, following an argument with De la Fuente in early 1973. De la Fuente lost interest in the band, and subsequently quit the group in March 1974. =Mi Vida Como Un Carrusel, continuing success, and return to Chile (1974-1993)= After Ort√≠z and De la Fuente left the band, the remaining members continued to play under the direction of Miguel √Ångel \\"Nano\\" Concha as Los √Ångeles Negros. Ismael Montes replaced De la Fuente as the singer, and Luis Astudillo replaced Ortiz as the drummer. Concha's √Ångeles Negros recorded and released the album Mi Vida Como Un Carrusel in 1974. Meanwhile, De la Fuente along with other Mexican musicians formed the band Germa√≠n y sus √Ångeles Negros, and settled in Mexico City. Concha's √Ångeles Negros played during the following years with Mexican singers Oscar Se√≠n and Enrique Castillo, and Micky Alarc√≥n and Guillermo Lynch from Chile, releasing the albums Despacito, Boler√≠simo, an instrumental one (all three from 1976), Serenata Sin Luna (1977), Pasi√≥n y Vida (1978), Ser√° Var√≥n, Ser√° Mujer (1979), and Tu Enamorado (1980). Drummer Luis Ort√≠z returned to the band in 1981, following Astudillo's departure in 1980. They achieved success with songs such as \\"El Enviado del Amor\\", \\"Volver√°s\\", Jos√© Alfredo Jim√©nez's \\"Despacito\\", and Los Red Juniors' \\"Al Pasar Esa Edad\\". After the successful period in the early 1980s when the band performed live at least 150 times in Mexico in a year, they decided to move to this country in 1983. However, in 1982, keyboardist Jorge Gonzalez left for De la Fuente's band, although he would occasionally play for Los √Ångeles Negros as a \\"hired musician\\". Singer Eddie Mart√≠nez joined Los √Ångeles Negros, while drummer Luis Astudillo returned to the band for the second time in 1986, after Ortiz moved to Canad√° the previous year. From Ort√≠z comeback in 1981 until his new departure, the band released Volver√°s (1981), Siempre Rom√°nticos (1982), Maldito Piano/Locamente M√≠a (1983), Con Alas Nuevas (1984), and Prohibido (1985). The band did not release new albums until the 1990 comeback album El Esperado Regreso. The next year they released De Aqu√≠ En Adelante, an album \\"inspired by tropical music, which showed the band's difficulties finding a new musical path\\", according to Jorge Leiva. \\"Nano\\" Concha decided to return to Chile in 1992, and established an oldies music store in Santiago. Former members Gonz√°lez and De la Fuente also returned to Chile, in 1993. =Guti√©rrez's leadership and the reunion (1993-present)= Guitarist Guti√©rrez continued to be part of Los √Ångeles Negros as the only original member, and later became its leader. Guti√©rrez's √Ångeles Negros recruited another singer in addition to Mart√≠nez, the Chilean Antonio Saavedra. The band plays yearly at least 50 times in Mexico, keeping the √Ångeles Negros' most well-known songs in their live repertoire, and they have released two albums since 1993: Toda Una Vida (1996), and Metamorfosis (2003). Guti√©rrez has been involved in several legal battles against the former members of the band and other unrelated individuals who perform as \\"Los √Ångeles Negros\\" or similar names, who are for him \\"m√∫sicos piratas\\" (illegal musicians). Those individuals include singer Germa√≠n de la Fuente, who performs since 1974 as Germa√≠n y sus √Ångeles Negros, keyboardist Jorge Gonz√°lez with singer Micky Alarc√≥n, who created a band called El Sonido de los √Ångeles in the late 1990s, and drummer Luis Ort√≠z and singer Guillermo Lynch, who created the band Los √Ångeles de Chile. De la Fuente, Gonz√°lez, Concha, and Ort√≠z announced their reunion in February 2009 to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of Y Volver√©, originally released in 1969. Their label EMI qualified the event as \\"unprecedented\\". Guti√©rrez did not want to participate in the √Ångeles Negros reunion, fearing eventual criticism. They played together for the first time since 1974 at the Teatro Caupolic√°n on 14 February 2010. The group's reunion, however, lasted until March of that year, because of \\"economic issues\\" just before a performance at Sala SCD, a concert hall in Santiago. Legacy and recognition The style of Los √Ångeles Negros, Balada rockm√°ntica or Bolero-beat, was immediately imitated by Chilean bands such as Los Golpes, Capablanca, Los Galos, and the Peruvian band Los Pasteles Verdes. They also influenced bands such as Los Bukis from Mexico, and Los Bunkers from Chile. Los √Ångeles Negros are regarded as a \\"classic example of romantic Latin music.\\" Several songs by Los √Ångeles Negros have been covered by bands and artists such as Los Tr3s, Los Bunkers, Sexual Democracia, Jos√© Jos√©, Raphael, and Celia Cruz, while others have been sampled by hip hop and rap acts such as the Beatnuts the Beastie Boys, Jay-Z, Damian Marley, and Funkdoobiest. A documentary titled √Ångeles Negros directed by Chilean filmmakers Pachi Bustos and Jorge Leiva was premiered at the Hoyts and Arte Alameda cinemas in Santiago on 18 October 2007. The documentary, which was recorded in Chile, Mexico, and the United States, is a \\"tribute\\" to the band, and \\"reviews their history\\". The band was awarded \\"El Micr√≥fono de Oro\\" (The Golden Microphone) by the Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Locutores de M√©xico in 2012. The band's 1969 song \\"El Rey y Yo\\" was featured in 2013 videogame Grand Theft Auto V, specifically in the game's radio East Los FM. \\"['El Rey y Yo'] is the gamers' preferred song\\", states a La Cuarta article describing the song's inclusion in the videogame.

It is native to west coast and coastal mountains of California, and northwards through the Cascade Range into Idaho and British Columbia. Description Rupertia physodes is a low bushy perennial with often recumbent branches that may form a dense ground cover. It has deep, woody roots and grows well on the dry edges of woods and prairies where it flowers in late spring and summer when few other nectar sources remain available. It has trifoliate leaves with three dark green tear-shaped entire leaflets which are smooth overall to sparsely hairy along the veins. The flowers are crowded on an auxiliary raceme ~ 5 cm long and with ~ 25 - 40 flowers. The individual papilionaceous (pea-like) flowers are white to cream colored, tinged with green or purple when freshly opened and fading to a rusty brown. A notable characteristic of this species is that the calyx continues to grow after the flower is shed and it soon becomes much longer than the developing seed pod, forming a large expanded conical collar around the one- seeded pod. At maturity the grayish one-seeded pod is tomentulose and membranaceous and can be easily rubbed off the single shiny black 5 mm long reniform seed that it tightly encloses. The mature bracts have a light resinous aromatic odor reminiscent of hops.

A Windows version was made available sometime 2002 and an updated one last 2007 on UnxUtils.UnxUtils project hosted on SourceForge History \`makedepend\` was developed as part of MIT's Project Athena. It was used extensively in building X11 and ancillary packages, but has since become superseded by the dependency generation facilities of various compilers, and is now used primarily as a worst-case fallback, e.g. by depcomp and GNU Automake. Usage \`makedepend\` is invoked with a list of sourcefiles: makedepend [options] foo.c bar.c ... However, it is more often invoked as a target from a makefile, typically under the \`depend\` target, such that \`make depend\` will invoke \`makedepend\` on all source files in the project. One such example target would be as follows: SRCS = file1.c file2.c ... CFLAGS = -O -DHACK -I../foobar -xyz depend: makedepend -- $(CFLAGS) -- $(SRCS) Purpose When building C language projects, it is imperative for incremental compilation (and useful for clean compilation) to be able to track dependencies between compilation units. C expresses interfaces between compilation units via header files; as such, it is often necessary to rebuild a compilation unit when a header it includes is changed. make needs to be informed of these dependencies. \`makedepend\` solves this problem by parsing the code of C source files to generate a list of dependencies (those header files included directly and indirectly). It is able to understand conditional compilation constructs so as to not generate excessive dependencies. It then appends rules expressing the dependencies to the Makefile. Shortcomings Much modern source code uses \\"conditional compilation\\" to control which part of the source code to be used based on C pre-processor symbols defined by the compiler. These symbols may state the compiler name or family, version number, operating system, and word size. Depending on these symbols, the included files may change. However, makedepend isn't itself a compiler and defines no such symbols, so the output may be incorrect. Further, some code will purposefully produce an explicit error if it cannot recognize any supported compiler, and thus will not be usable by makedepend at all. Alternatives Most modern compilers provide a flag (often \`-M\`) that uses the compiler's own source parser to generate a list of dependencies. This may be preferred to \`makedepend\` because it reduces the likelihood of the dependencies generated being at odds with the compiler's own behavior. Since compilers accept different flags for dependency generation, and may behave differently in outputting dependency information, it is desirable to use a wrapper script that can invoke the compiler appropriately (and fall back to \`makedepend\` if necessary). One popular such wrapper script is depcomp, which is distributed with and used by GNU Automake.Dependency Tracking in Automake, Automake Manual Solaris make includes support for dependency tracking that is activated by specifying the \\"special-function target\\" \`.KEEP_STATE\`.Solaris make(1) Man-page References External links * *Directory where the sourcecode is available Unix programming tools ","title":"Makedepend"},{"id":"13297917","text":"The Alpine Sleigh Ride was a dark ride located in the Alpine Valley section of AstroWorld in Houston, Texas. It was one of the original attractions of the park and operated from 1968 until the end of the 1983 operating season. Featuring a ride control system and vehicles (ArrowGlide) designed by Arrow Dynamics, the attraction's initial concept and design was by amusement park planner and architect Randall Duell. Duell‚Äôs company had been hired by Judge Roy Hofheinz to plan AstroWorld. The attraction took riders through an alpine themed forest before reaching the show building which was designed to resemble a large mountain capped with snow. The ride had elements of both a dark ride and a roller coaster. During the first part of the ride, the sleighs moved through a pine forest, past a towering waterfall, and into the ‚ÄúDer Hofheinzberg‚Äù mountain. The second half of the ride took riders through dark tunnels and icy caverns. A waterfall cascaded from atop the mountain and down into a catch pool below. After passing the waterfall, the sleigh themed vehicles entered the mountain's base and traveled through various chambers and tunnels inside. These included an echo-tunnel, an avalanche room with simulated snow, an appearance by an \\"abominable snowman\\" character, and a chamber themed with \\"Alpie\\" characters, among others. The avalanche room kept cooled down to approximately 10 degrees Fahrenheit and contained an elaborate snow machine. This system was developed for the park by Carrier, the company responsible for Astroworld‚Äôs famous ‚Äúoutdoor air conditioning‚Äù in the park‚Äôs queues and other areas. In the Cold Room were two giant air curtains blowing down onto the track from above, one at the entrance of the room and one at the exit. After passing through the second level inside the mountain, the vehicles would exit and travel around the exterior of the mountain themed show building. Exterior features included the high bridge passing in front of the waterfall and a downhill canyon run. Vehicles were powered by an electrical bus bar along sections of track that ascended, and they were gravity powered along the descents which featured several surprise drops. Closed due to high maintenance costs in 1983, the attraction became part of the Enchanted Kingdom children's area, and later part of the Batman The Escape.

Environmental concern has been voiced by both conservative politicians and philosophers throughout the history of modern conservatism, with Edmund Burke (the philosophical founder of modern conservatism), in his Reflections on the Revolution in France, quoted as saying: \\"the earth, the kind and equal mother of all ought not to be monopolised to foster the pride and luxury of any men\\".  Variants  =Americas= Brazil The National Ecologic Party had ties to the Assemblies of God, the largest evangelical denomination present in Brazil, and upheld green conservatism but it has now changed its name to Patriota and renounced its green and pro-ecologist policies in favor of its conservative and nationalist policies; it has maintained and strengthened its religious opposition to abortion, same-sex marriage and other left-wing policies. Canada In Canada, the term 'green conservatism' was popularized in 2006 by Preston Manning, former federal opposition leader and founder of the Reform Party of Canada. Specifically Manning started developing the idea as a way to find common ground between younger and older voters. He has specifically talked about using water pricing in the Oil Sands to make oil producers more efficient. In 1988, then-graduate student Stephen Harper, writing in the Blue Book, which influenced the Reform Party principles, argued for an environmental policy that supports and protects the environment but reduces bureaucratic control. Harper argued that the Reform Party was aware of environmental exploitation found within \\"socialist, capitalist, and social democratic patterns.\\" Canadian idealist and philosopher George Parkin Grant, writing in the Red Tory Manifesto, argued that Tories support environmental incentives as a way to oppose \\"captains of industry who were destroying the environment for a crude and short-sighted notion of profit\\" . In 2006, Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, was honoured as \\"the greenest prime minister in Canadian history\\". He brought in the Canada-U.S. acid rain treaty, added eight new national parks and brought in the Environmental Protection Act. Then-PM Stephen Harper argued that \\"He [Mulroney] didn't produce grandiose schemes and unworkable arrangements and the kind of problems we got into with Kyoto.\\" The Coalition Avenir Qu√©bec's party leader Fran√ßois Legault advocates a 'pragmatic' approach on the issues that would balance between the \\"milltant\\" approach of the environment movement but \\"create wealth, to reduce the wealth gap\\" between Quebec and other Canadian provinces. In 2019, Benoit Charette, the Quebec Environmental minister, denounced remarks made by people stating that they would no longer have children to protect the environment as \\"too alarmist\\". However, Charette pointed to \\"the management of residual materials and the issue of plastic and glass water bottles directly\\" as a way to tackle environmental issues realistically. Mexico The Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVE), founded in 1993, won 47 seats in the 2015 Mexican legislative election. In 2008, the PVEM initiated an advertising campaign in favor of reintroducing the death penalty in Mexico. This led to the European Green Party's withdrawal of recognition of the PVEM as a legitimate green party.Tim Johnson, For Mexico's Ecologist Green Party, 'green' mostly means money, not environment, McClatchy Newspapers (18 June 2012). During an interview, PVE candidate Gamaliel Ram√≠rez verbally attacked an openly gay candidate for Guadalajara mayor and called for criminal laws against homosexuality to be established. In the following days, Ram√≠rez issued a written apology after the party expressed disappointment at his remarks. United States One of the first uses of the term green conservatism was by former United States Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich, in a debate on environmental issues with John Kerry.We Can Have Green Conservatism - And We Should - HUMAN EVENTS. Retrieved 20 February 2010.The Case for Green Conservatism - Redstate. Retrieved 20 February 2010. Broken link. Internet Archive Around this time, the green conservative movement was sometimes referred to as the crunchy con movement, a term popularized by National Review magazine and the writings of Rod Dreher. In the United States, the Republican Party is generally considered as the conservative party. Green conservatism manifested itself as a movement in groups such as ConservAmerica and the American Conservation Coalition,American Conservation Coalition - Home which seek to strengthen the Republican Party's stance on environmental issues and support efforts to conserve natural resources and protect human and environmental health. The Independent Greens of Virginia (or Indy Greens) call themselves \\"common sense conservatives\\". The party, over the last decade, has run many conservative greens for local, state, and federal office. In 2004, the party gave its ballot line to Constitution Party nominee Michael Peroutka for president, and in 2008, once again placed the Constitution Party nominee Chuck Baldwin on the ballot as its presidential candidate. The Indy Greens call for balancing the federal budget and paying off the federal debt. The Republican Party had long supported the protection of the environment in the first half of 20th Century. Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies eventually led to the creation of the modern National Park Service. Republican President Richard Nixon was responsible for establishing the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. More recently, California Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the support of 16 other states, sued the federal government and the United States Environmental Protection Agency for the right to set vehicle emission standards higher than the federal standard, a right to which California is entitled under the Clean Air Act. Democratic President Bill Clinton did not send the Kyoto Protocol to the U.S. Senate for ratification, as he thought it unfair to the United States. President George W. Bush also publicly opposed ratification of the Kyoto Protocols on the grounds that they unfairly targeted Western industrialized nations such as the United States while favoring developing Global South polluters such as China and India. In 2000, the Republican Party adopted as part of its platform support for the development of market-based solutions to environmental problems. According to the platform, \\"economic prosperity and environmental protection must advance together, environmental regulations should be based on science, the government‚Äôs role should be to provide market-based incentives to develop the technologies to meet environmental standards, we should ensure that environmental policy meets the needs of localities, and environmental policy should focus on achieving results processes.\\" The George W. Bush administration, along with several of the candidates that sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, supported increased Federal investment into the development of clean alternative fuels, increased nuclear power, as well as fuels such as ethanol, as a way of helping the U.S. achieve energy independence, as opposed to supporting less use of carbon dioxide- producing methods of generating energy. John McCain, who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008, supported the cap-and-trade policy, a policy that is quite popular among Democrats but much less so among other Republicans. =Asia= Japan In Japan, the Environmental Green Political Assembly, or Midori no Kaigi, emerged from the conservative reformist Sakigake Party. It combined a conservative ideology with an ecologist platform, forcing out a number of non-ecologist members to join the Democratic Party's Ryoun-kai faction. It showed poor performance at the polls, and was dissolved in 2004, merged into the conservative Liberal Democratic Party. =Europe= Austria The Austrian environmental movement (USB) was founded in 1973, out of this, the Electoral community for citizens' initiatives and environmental protection (WBU) has emerged. The WBU was thereby a grouping with bourgeois, liberal and conservative sides, which also did not shy away from the right-wing extremist spectrum.Schandl, Schattauer: Die Gr√ºnen in √ñsterreich. S. 125 f. The United Greens of Austria (VG√ñ) was founded in 1982, this represented the bourgeois wing of the movement.Die Gr√ºnen By former members VG√ñ later the Civil Green Austria (BG√ñ) was founded. The Free Party Salzburg (FPS) claims to be the only party that advocates that no genetically modified seed funds may be spread and has advocated against genetic engineering. It calls for a ban on glyphosate and it \\"deals with the green issues in Salzburg\\".Sch√§dlingsbek√§mpfungsmittel on the Page of the FPS The second Kurz government of the Republic of Austria that has been in office since the 7th of January 2020 introduced a governing program that combines typically green political concepts such as environmental protection but also typically conservative positions on topics such as integration, migration and economic policy. Denmark In Denmark, the Conservative People's Party advocates conservative policies, while being a part of the green bloc of Folketinget. They opposed the Danish 2016 Agriculture Reform due to environmental concerns. France G√©n√©ration √âcologie is an ecologically focused political party in France. It has been nicknamed 'The Blues' due to its association with a number of conservative political groups. Antoine Waechter, a former presidential candidate of Les Verts, founded Mouvement Ecologiste Ind√©pendant after Les Verts adopted left-wing positions. Mouvement Ecologiste Ind√©pendant adheres to centrist politics and so it may include some members who lean towards green conservatism. Germany The governing Greens in the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg under Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann have been described as more conservative than their federal counterparts. Indeed, Kretschmann identifies as a green conservative and has been associated with economically liberal viewpoints. The Green Action Future (GAZ), the predecessor party of the √ñDP, was perceived and criticized in opinion leaders such as Der Spiegel as clearly conservative.Christa Meves: Ad memoriam Herbert Gruhl. In: Naturkonservativ heute. Jahrbuch der Herbert- Gruhl-Gesellschaft e.V. 2003, Essen: Verlag Die Blaue Eule, 2003, S. 99‚Äì100, hier S. 100 In Germany, the Ecological Democratic Party (√ñDP) was formed by more right-wing defectors from Die Gr√ºnen in 1982. It combined a focus on environmental protection with a promotion of the right to life (opposition to abortion, euthanasia and capital punishment); it differs from The Greens by being less supportive of immigration and restrictions on state powers in criminal justice issues, not focusing on gay and lesbian rights, and having a differing view on feminism. While having never gained seats in federal or state legislatures in Germany, it made a name for itself by its involvement in the opposition to a Czech nuclear reactor in Temelin, across the border from Bavaria. It led an initiative for a popular referendum to abolish the Bavarian Senate (that state's upper house) which was successful. The party won a seat in the 2014 EU Parliament election and remains active. Greece Ecologist Greece is a green conservative party. On 11 September 2009, Georgios Karatzaferis, leader of the far-right nationalist Popular Orthodox Rally (Laos) party announced that Ecologists Greece leader Papanikolas would run on the statewide Laos ticket in the 2009 Greek legislative election.ŒüŒô ŒüŒôŒöŒüŒõŒüŒìŒüŒô ŒïŒõŒõŒëŒîŒüŒ£ Œ£Œ§Œü ŒõŒë.Œü.Œ£ , Laos press release, 11 September 2009. Hungary The Green Party of Hungary was founded on 19 November 1989. But when Zolt√°n Medveczki became Party President in March 1993, the party gradually changed its political position from moderate to radical right-wing. The MZP adopted anti-liberal, anti-communist, anti-Semitic and pro-fascist elements (Ecofascism) to its program and also criticized privatization and market economy. Medveczki also founded and registered the party's paramilitary wing, the Alliance of National Green Youth. It was dissolved in 2011. Italy The Greens Greens was founded by Maurizio Lupi, a former member of Christian Democracy and of the Federation of the Greens. In the 2004 provincial elections of Turin the Greens Greens supported the centre-right candidate Franco Botta. In the 2005 Piedmontese regional election the Greens Greens supported the centre-right candidate Enzo Ghigo; the list got 23,761 votes and the 1.16% of the vote. In the 2008 Italian general election Alessandro Lupi ran for the Chamber in The People of Freedom's list, in the division Piedmont 1, but he wasn't elected. In the 2010 Piedmontese regional election the Greens Greens supported the centre-right candidate Roberto Cota, winning the 1.76% of the vote and one seat. In the 2014 Piedmontese regional election the party supported the candidate of Forza Italia Gilberto Pichetto Fratin, but it got only the 0.27% of the vote and no seats. The Five Star Movement, formed in 2009 and which entered government after the 2018 Italian general election, has an inconsistent history regarding environmentalism. The name of the party originates from its five principles: public water access, sustainable transportation, sustainable development, the right to internet access, and environmentalism. The party has been difficult to classify on a traditional left-right political spectrum, as it incorporates positions and features of both sides. From 2009 to 2015, the party was generally seen as somewhat more left-leaning than right-leaning, owing primarily due to its strong performance among young Italians. However, from 2016 onwards, the party saw an influx of disillusioned right-leaning voters, and the party shifted accordingly, particularly on issues such as immigration. In June 2018, M5S entered into government with Lega Nord, a right-wing populist party. The Five Stars Movement claims to support better management of public water resources, promotes the development of renewable energy resources, opposes the construction of pipelines and disposal of household waste via incinerators, and promotes support for small farms against large agri-business in an effort to preserve Italy's natural landscape and local economies. This can be seen as a form of \\"green conservatism\\"; however, the M5S campaign in 2018 rarely featured discussion about the environment, and the party leadership has not signaled that environmentalism will be a priority over the 2018 - 2023 period that they are in power with Lega Nord. In September 2018, M5S supported a deal to keep a highly-polluting steel mill in Castelbuono open, citing employment concerns that trumped environmentalism. The mill was transferred from Ilva to ArcelorMittal. The deal was a violation of promises made in the 2018 election campaign to close the plant, which spewed dioxin into the local environment. Latvia In February 2004, after the breakdown of the four-party government, Indulis Emsis of the Latvian Green Party was appointed to form a new government and became the first head of government of a country anywhere in the world from a Green party.Emilie van Haute: Green Parties in Europe, London: Routledge 2016, p. 118. Following the 2014 Latvian parliamentary election, the Union of Greens and Farmers became the third largest party in the country with 21 seats, 6 of which are held by the Latvian Green Party which is the second largest of the 4 parties which form the Union (in terms of the number of seats it holds). Lithuania In the 2016 Lithuanian parliamentary election, the Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union became the largest party in a surprise victory with 51 seats. Following the success of the Farmers and Greens Union at the 2016 election, chairman Ram≈´nas Karbauskis proposed a grand coalition in combination with a technocratic government focusing on economic growth, including both the center-right Homeland Union and the center-left Social Democratic Party of Lithuania. However, the Homeland Union declined to be part of a coalition in which it would not be needed for the parliamentary majority. Subsequently, the Farmers and Greens Union formed a government with only the Social Democrats. Portugal The Portuguese Earth Party (Partido da Terra) is a green conservative political party in Portugal, founded on 12 August 1993. United Kingdom In 1970, the Conservative Government of Edward Heath created the United Kingdom's first Department of the Environment. At the 1988 Conservative Party Conference Margaret Thatcher said, \\"It‚Äôs we Conservatives who are not merely friends of the Earth ‚Äì we are its guardians and trustees for generations to come. The core of Tory philosophy and for the case for protecting the environment are the same. No generation has a freehold on this earth. All we have is a life tenancy ‚Äì with a full repairing lease. This Government intends to meet the terms of that lease in full.\\"http://green.brightblue.org.uk/project-1 In the early 21st century, the Conservative Party under David Cameron promised a green agenda which included proposals designed to impose a tax on workplace car parking spaces, a halt to airport growth, a tax on low fuel efficiency 4x4s and restrictions on car advertising. The measures were suggested by The Quality of Life Policy Group, which was set up by Cameron to help fight climate change. Bright Blue, a liberal conservative think tank launched the Green Conservatism project to create conservative support for policies that address climate change. Cameron spoke of embracing 'green' issues, and had made climate change a key component of his speeches. He called for an independent climate change commission to ensure that emissions reductions targets are met. However, Cameron's claim of leading the \\"greenest government ever\\" has been repudiated by Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who argued that Cameron had \\"shown little interest in green policy and the sustainability agenda.\\" Zac Goldsmith, who was the Conservative candidate for London Mayor in 2016, describes himself as an environmentalist. He had received the Global Green Award for International Environmental Leadership in 2004. Sir Roger Scruton, former professor of philosophy at Oxford and St Andrews, has spoken and written extensively on the need for a Green Conservatism drawing upon a love of place and heritage. In 2019, Outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservatives passed plans to become the first major economy to pass new laws that would reduce emissions to net zero by 2050. =Oceania= Australia The first significant Green conservative in Australia was Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. During his time in office (1975-1983) he legislated significant environmental-protection laws for the Great Barrier Reef while leader of the centre-right Liberal Party as early as the 1970s. Australian politics became more polemical around the year 2000. Once an uneasy alliance between the Australian Labor Party (the traditional opposition to the Liberal Party) and The Greens had formed, it caused many conservative voters to become suspicious of green politics and so interest in green conservatism waned. In 2004 the conservative Family First Party aired a television advertisement labelling The Australian Greens as the Extreme Greens. Since then, the continuously increasing anti-conservative dominance within The Greens has led to this label receiving broader use in the media. For example: Consequently, green conservatives are entering political parties other than The Greens instead. As a result of the 2019 water crisis in regional New South Wales, the conservative Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party began espousing some green policies to ensure the availability of fresh water in remote areas. These mostly focused around the controversial Murray Darling Basin plan. However, the party's policy on issues such as greyhound racing conflict with those of many animal rights activists who are often present within green politics. New Zealand The Conservative Party of New Zealand has an environmental policy focused around actions within the country that can help the local environment rather than being tied to international agreements. In 2019, the New Zealand National Party supported a New Zealand Labour Party bill that would aiming for net zero emission by 2050.

There are over 1000 species in the genus,Connelly, C. R. Biting midges: Culicoides spp. Featured Creatures, Entomology and Nematology Department, University of Florida IFAS. August 2013 Edition. which is divided into many subgenera. Several species are known to be vectors of various diseases and parasites which can affect animals. Like Leptoconops, the genus has a long fossil record, with earliest known fossils being from the Burmese amber, around 99 million years old. Notable taxa The systematics and taxonomy of this genus are confused. A large number of species are of unknown relations to those that have been assigned to subgenera already. Furthermore, many subgenera are sometimes elevated to full genus status, or additional genera (such as Paradasyhelea) are included as subgenera herein. A widely cited, periodically updated, subgeneric classification of species of Culicoides begins with the warning that the traditional approach to classification of species in this genus has led to \\"phylogenetic chaos\\". Some of the specific consequences are mentioned, as well as recommendations for future work. A molecular phylogeny based on 42 species from 3 continents was proposed in 2017. In this work, the authors found that the subgenera Monoculicoides, Culicoides, Haematomyidium, Hoffmania, Remmia and Avaritia (including the main vectors of bluetongue virus disease) were monophyletic, whereas the subgenus Oecacta was paraphyletic. The study validated the subgenus Remmia (= Schultzei group) as a valid subgenus, outside of the subgenus Oecacta. The authors also considered that in Europe, Culicoides obsoletus, Culicoides scoticus and Culicoides chiopterus should be part of the Obsoletus complex whereas Culicoides dewulfi should be excluded from this complex. The authors concluded that the current Culicoides classification needed to be revisited with modern tools. *Subgenus Avaritia Culicoides brevitarsis Culicoides impunctatus (left) and culicine mosquito (right) Culicoides impunctatus **Culicoides brevitarsis - suspected as vector of Akabane and Aino virus **Culicoides imicola - main vector of bluetongue virus and African Horse Sickness in Southern Europe **Culicoides chiopterus - **Culicoides dewulfi - **Culicoides obsoletus - **Culicoides scoticus - *Subgenus Beltranmyia **Culicoides circumscriptus **Culicoides crepuscularis **Culicoides manchuriensis **Culicoides salinarius *Subgenus Culicoides **Culicoides boyi **Culicoides delta **Culicoides fagineus **Culicoides grisescens **Culicoides impunctatus (Highland midge) - vector for Haemoproteus spp. **Culicoides kalix **Culicoides newsteadi **Culicoides nipponensis **Culicoides pulicaris **Culicoides punctatus **Culicoides selandicus *Subgenus Drymodesmyia **Culicoides loughnani *Subgenus Haematomyidium **Culicoides insinuatus **Culicoides paraensis - vector of Oropouche virus *Subgenus Haemophoructus **Culicoides gemellus *Subgenus Hoffmania **Culicoides foxi **Culicoides fusipalpis **Culicoides ignacioi **Culicoides insignis **Culicoides lutzi **Culicoides maruim **Culicoides paramaruim *Subgenus Macfiella **Culicoides phlebotomus *Subgenus Meijerehelea **Culicoides guttifer *Subgenus Monoculicoides **Culicoides nubeculosus **Culicoides variipennis *Subgenus Oecacta **Culicoides furens transmits Mansonella Ozzardi *Subgenus Remmia **Culicoides oxystoma *Subgenus Tokunagahelea **Culicoides pygmaeus *Subgenus Trithecoides **Culicoides anophelis Species incertae sedis include: * limai group **Culicoides limai * fluviatilis group **Culicoides fluviatilis **Culicoides leopodoi * reticulatus group **Culicoides guyanensis **Culicoides paucienfuscatus **Culicoides reticulatus Taxonomy Wing pattern of 12 species of Culicoides Adults are small dark insects about 1‚Äì3 mm long. The antennae are long (15 segments) densely haired in the males and less hairy in females. The Thorax is hooped and carries a pair of broad mottled wings. Only the first two longitudinal veins are distinct. Midges are morphologically distinct from mosquitoes, lacking a proboscis and limiting their ability to bite through clothing. Biological habits: Both males and females feed on nectar, however only the females take a blood meal, which is needed for the maturation of fertilized eggs. Females typically bite at dusk or dawn often in dense swarms and usually in the vicinity of water, marshes or rotting vegetation. Life cycle of Culicoides: Females lay their eggs en masse in a range of habitats ranging from water vegetation, slow running streams, damp soil or manure heaps. These hatch into tiny smooth white larvae with four pairs of anal gills. Pupae consist of a fused cephalothorax with slender respiratory trumpets and a segmented abdomen. Adults emerge through a straight slit after 3‚Äì7 days. The bite of Culicoides is felt as a sharp prick and is often followed by irritating lumps that may disappear in a few hours or last for days. Culicoides as a vector Various Culicoides species have been shown to be vectors for the following viruses and conditions: Mansonella spp. (M. ozzardi, M. perstans, M. streptocerca), Onchocerca gibsoni and O. cervicalis, Leucocytozoon, Plasmodium agamae, bluetongue virus, Schmallenberg virus, African horse sickness, bovine ephemeral fever (C. osystoma and C. nipponesis), Akabane virus, Queensland itch and epizootic hemorrhagic disease. A typical cycle of transmission of a virus by Culicoides is illustrated in the article Parasitic flies of domestic animals. Bluetongue vectors in Northern Europe In 2006, bluetongue virus was first recorded in Northern Europe. In 2007 and 2008, there were huge outbreaks, going as far as Norway, but in 2009 the outbreak was smaller. The main vector of the virus in Southern Europe does not live in Northern Europe, so other species have been screened. Species belonging to the Culicoides obsoletus complex and the Culicoides pulicaris complex have been found capable of bluetongue transmission.

The legs, which are strengthened in standing exercises, santishi, are kept bent and use the compression and release of the long muscles. The strikes or blows are driven up in a diagonal from the muscles of the rear foot, through the muscles of the torso and out the striking arm.

The French emerged triumphant and incorporated Dahomey into their growing colonial territory of French West Africa. Background In 1890, the Fon kingdom of Dahomey and the French Third Republic had gone to war in what was remembered as the First Franco-Dahomean War over the former's rights to certain territories, specifically those in the Ou√©m√© Valley.Alpern, p. 193. The Fon ceased hostilities with the French after two military defeats, withdrawing their forces and signing a treaty conceding to all of France's demands.Alpern, p. 196. However, Dahomey remained a potent force in the area and quickly re-armed with modern weapons in anticipation of a second, decisive conflict. Casus belli Dahomey warriors firing at the gunboat \\"Topaze\\". After re-arming and regrouping, the Fon returned to raiding the Ou√©m√© Valley,Alpern, p. 21. the same valley fought over in the first war with France. Victor Ballot, the French Resident at Porto-Novo, was sent via gunboat upriver to investigate.Alpern, p. 198. His ship was attacked and forced to depart with five men wounded in the incident. King Benhanzin rejected complaints by the French, and war was declared immediately by the French. Military build up The French entrusted the war effort against Dahomey to Alfred-Am√©d√©e Dodds, an octoroon colonel of the Troupes de marine from Senegal. Colonel Dodds arrived with a force of 2,164 men including Foreign Legionnaires, marines, engineers, artillery and Senegalese cavalry known as spahis plus the trusted tirailleurs. These forces were armed with the new Lebel rifles, which would prove decisive in the coming battle.Alpern, p. 201. The French protectorate kingdom of Porto- Novo also added some 2,600 porters to aid in the fight.Alpern, p. 199. The Fon, prior to the outbreak of the second war, had stockpiled between 4,000 and 6,000 rifles including Mannlicher and Winchester carbines.Alpern, p. 197. These were purchased from German merchants via the port of Whydah. King B√©hanzin also bought some machine-guns and Krupp cannons, but it is unknown (and unlikely) that these were ever put to use. Beginning of hostilities On the 15 June 1892, the French blockaded Dahomey's coast to prevent any further arms sales. Then, on the 4 July the first shots of the war were fired from French gunboats with the shelling of several villages along the lower Ou√©m√© Valley. The carefully organized French army began moving inland in mid- August toward their final destination of the Dahomey capital of Abomey. =Battle of Dogba= The French invasion force assembled at the village of Dogba on the 14 September some upriver on the border of Dahomey and Porto- Novo. At around 5:00am on the 19 September the French force was attacked by the army of Dahomey. The Fon broke off the attack after three to four hours of relentless fighting, characterized by repeated attempts by the Fon for melee combat.Alpern, p. 200. Hundreds of Fon were left dead on the field with the French forces suffering only five dead. =Battle of Poguessa= The French forces moved another upriver before turning west in the direction of Abomey. On the 4 October the French column was attacked at Poguessa (also known as Pokissa or Kpokissa) by Fon forces under the command of King B√©hanzin himself. The Fon staged several fierce charges over two to three hours that all failed against the 20-inch bayonets of the French. The Dahomey army left the field in defeat losing some 200 soldiers.Alpern, p. 202. The French carried the day with only 42 casualties. The Dahomey Amazons were also conspicuous in the battle. Trek to Abomey The French route to Abomey After the defeat at Poguessa, the Fon resorted to guerilla tactics rather than set-piece engagements. It took the French invasion force a month to march the between Poguessa and the last major battle at Cana just outside Abomey. The Fon fought from foxholes and trenches to slow the French invasion. =Battle of Ad√©gon= On 6 October, the French had another major encounter with the Fon, at the village of Ad√©gon.Alpern, p. 203. The Fon fared badly again, losing 86 Dahomey Regulars and 417 Dahomey Amazons. The French suffered six dead and 32 wounded. The French bayonet charge inflicted the lion's share of Dahomey casualties. The Battle was a turning point for Dahomey: the royal court lost hope. The battle was also significant in that much of Dahomey's Amazon corps was lost. =Siege at Akpa= The French column was able to cross another toward Abomey after Ad√©gon, bivouacking at the village of Akpa. From the moment they arrived, they were attacked daily. From the French arrival until 14 October, Dahomey's Amazons were conspicuously absent. Then, on 15 October, they reappeared an were present in nearly every subsequent engagement, inflicting significant losses, especially against officers. Once resupplied, the French departed Akpa on 26 October, heading toward the village of Cotopa.Alpern, p. 204. End of Dahomey Hand-to-hand fighting at Cotopa (from a British book) From the 26 to 27 October the French fought through the Dahomey forces at Cotopa and elsewhere, crossing lines of enemy trenches. Bayonet charges were the deciding factor in nearly all engagements. The Fon penchant for hand-to- hand fighting left them at a disadvantage against French bayonets, which easily outreached Dahomey's swords and machetes. The Amazons are reported by the French to have fought the hardest, charging out of their trenches but to no avail. =Battle of Cana= From the 2 November until the 4 November the French and Fon armies fought on the outskirts of Cana. By this time, B√©hanzin's army numbered no more than 1,500 including slaves and pardoned convicts. On the 3 November the king directed the attack on the French bivouac. Amazons seemed to have made up much of the force. After four hours of desperate combat, the Fon army withdrew. The fighting continued until the next day. The last engagement at Cana, which took place at the village of Diokou√©, site of a royal palace, was the last time Amazons were used.Alpern, p. 205. Special units of the Amazons were assigned specifically to target French officers. After a full day of fighting, the French overran the Dahomey army with another bayonet charge. End of the war Medal of the Dahomey campaign. Law of 12 November 1892. Mus√©e de la L√©gion d'Honneur. On the 5 November Dahomey sent a truce mission to the French, and the next day saw the French enter Cana. The peace mission failed, however, and on the 16 November, the French army marched on Abomey. King B√©hanzin, refusing to let the capital fall into enemy hands, burned and evacuated the city. He and the remnants of the Dahomey army fled north as the French entered the capital on the 17 November. The French tricolor was hoisted over the Singboji palace, which survived the fire and remains in modern Benin to this day.Alpern, p. 206. The king of Dahomey fled to Atcherib√©, north of the capital.

After witnessing an early show, producer Gary Katz negotiated the band's signing to Reprise Records, and produced their eponymous debut album in 1993. In 1994, they appeared on the Red Hot Organization's compilation album, Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool, alongside other prominent jazz artists, Herbie Hancock and Roy Ayers. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as \\"Album of the Year\\" by Time Magazine. They scored two minor dance instrumental and adult contemporary hits in 1996 with a cover of The Beatles' \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" (US Dance/Club Play #45, US Dance Maxi Singles #23) and \\"Lift Off\\" (US R&B;/Hip-Hop #73).[ Billboard Singles], Allmusic.com Groove Collective's musical style reflects the wide- ranging backgrounds and interests of its individual members. Commenting on the group's 1996 release, We the People, critic Michael Casey referred to the numerous influences at work in Groove Collective's sound, specifically the presence of Afro-pop, Latin jazz, hip-hop, and traditional jazz stylings. This mix is born of the members' varying influences, including bebop, funk, old- school hip-hop and classic soul.Michael Casey, \\"The Range Finders: Groove Collective Defies Labels,\\" Bergen Record May 23, 1997, ProQuest Platinum, Online (November 13, 2007).

The soils are made up of clay, chalk and sandstone and have been eroded by water and wind creating surprising shapes, canyons, plateaus, tabular structures and isolated hills, called cabezos. Bardenas Reales lacks urban areas, vegetation is scarce and the many streams that cross the territory have a markedly seasonal flow, staying dry most of the year. Bardenas of Navarra. Location The Bardenas is in the southeast of Navarre, bordering Aragon. It is located in the middle of the depression of the Ebro valley at the foot of the mountains of the Yugo and the Zaragoza region of Cinco Villas. It is from north to south and east-west and at an altitude ranging between . Its area is . There are only sixteen municipalities, of which thirteen are in Navarre and three in the province of Zaragoza. The Navarrese are Valtierra, Arguedas, Carcastillo, Santacara, M√©lida, Rada, Caparroso, Villafranca, Cadreita, Tudela, Cabanillas, Fusti√±ana and Bu√±uel, while the Zaragozan are: Tauste, Ejea de los Caballeros and S√°daba. Las Bardenas are divided into several distinct areas which mainly include two, Black Bardena and White Bardena, but there are other smaller areas of great singularity. =White Bardena= It is the central area and more desert. Its relief is characterized by extensive plains and deep gorges through which rivers flow. This Bardena owes its name to the presence of white salt that extend over the surface due to the abundance of gypsum in the soil. The White Bardena divides into two, the White Lower and Upper White. The first is the most depressed and the second extending from Pisquerra and Eguaras to Carcastillo. =Black Bardena= Black Bardena is situated in the south- eastern part of the territory on the border of the Autonomous Community of Aragon. Formed by plateaus of different altitudes and cut by rivers flowing at the bottom of the cliffs, this part of the Bardenas is covered with vegetation. =Central Plateau= There is a central plateau that lies above the surrounding area where corn is grown. It is formed by Tertiary and Quaternary soils that were raised by pressure associated with the creation of the Pyrenees and the mountains of Central Spain that caused the collapse of the Ebro basin forming an inland sea enclosed by the Catalan Coastal Range. Sediments laid down were then eroded from the Eocene onwards. These formed gravel and sandstone that stayed at the top, fine sand, clay and limestone occupy the lower slopes. Clay remained in the centre and limestone and gypsum formed at the edges. The gravels, sandstones and clay were all associated with alluvial deposits. Mixtures of sandstone and clay formed two mountain ranges in between the centre and perimeter. The sediments may have been thick. Ten million years ago, the basin opened to the Mediterranean Sea and drained, leaving the Ebro, which began water erosion along the southern perimeter, which left the remaining land relatively flat. The folding effect of erosion is caused by the alternate soft and hard materials. If the layers are horizons, then the Cabezas became isolated.

Early life Mills was born in Brentwood. He attended St Martin's School (Brentwood) on Hanging Hill Lane in Hutton, Brentwood. Career Mills worked for over twenty years in marketing and advertising. Having left school with no qualifications, he started with The Economist at the age of fifteen as a copy assistant and then at the Financial Times and Investors Chronicle, where he was responsible for their marketing programmes. From there he moved into advertising in London. In 1981, he led a management buyout of the London office of the New York-based company Nadler & Larimer, becoming the chief executive. In 1985 he found Mills, Smith & Partners. He was also a non-executive director at Tottenham Hotspur Football Club but stepped down in January 2016. In 2011, Mills was awarded an Honorary Degree (Doctor of Laws) from the University of Bath Loyalty cards Mills is chiefly known for inventing the Air Miles (in 1988) and Nectar Card (in 2002) loyalty card schemes. =Air Miles= Air Miles was set up in 1988 when Mills started the Loyalty Management Group, then known as Air Miles International Group BV. He had the idea in 1987 when working at his advertising agency, which had Shell and British Caledonian as clients who were looking to make the most of their customer base without devaluing the image of the products. People would buy Air Miles from Shell petrol to use on British Caledonian. He approached British Airways and they liked the idea. He then sold similar ideas in the United States and Canada, moving to the United States in 1990. In 1993, the US Air Miles system collapsed, costing him ¬£15m. In 1994, his 49% sharehold of the scheme was sold to British Airways, although he still retains the intellectual property rights. =Nectar Card= Loyalty Management UK was started in 2001, which produced the Nectar Card in September,HBR, 5 December 2005, 9-505-031 2002\\\\. In December 2007, the company was sold for ¬£350m to the Canadian company Aeroplan, in which he had 46% of sharehold, netting ¬£160m. Olympics From September 2003, he became Chief Executive and International President of the London 2012 campaign which saw London selected as host for the 2012 Summer Olympics. He served as Deputy Chairman of the London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games. At the end of the project Mills was awarded the Olympic Order. He later set up the charity Sported with ¬£10 million of his own money to deliver on London 2012's legacy promises. Coutts AIG action The same month that Loyalty Management UK was sold, Mills bought ¬£73m of the \\"enhanced fund\\" version of AIG Life \\"premier bonds\\" on the advice of Coutts, the private bank owned by Royal Bank of Scotland. Coutts recommended to Mills that he place his money in AIG Life Premier Bonds as a way of protecting his capital. They also said it would be a safe alternative to bank deposits and would earn a slightly better interest rate. Coutts said Mills' money would be safe, as AIG was the largest insurance company in the world, AA rated, and that the bonds would provide instant access to his money, just like a deposit account. Later, given the negative press reports about the future of AIG, Mills queried Coutts, in writing, the safety of keeping his money with AIG. Coutts replied that they did not have concerns about these bonds, so Mills retained them. AIG Life is a UK subsidiary of American International Group, the US insurer rescued by the US Federal Reserve on 16 September 2008. Personal life He married Maureen in 1974; they have two children and live near Tunbridge Wells in Kent. Lady Mills supports her husband's charity work and support for sport, including the successful bid for the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games. He enjoys sailing; in 1999 he was member of a team captained by Alex Thomson that won the Clipper Round the World Yacht Race. He founded Team Origin in 2007. Honours Mills was knighted in the 2006 New Years Honours List in recognition of his services to sport. He was appointed Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE) in the 2013 New Years Honours List for services to the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

The street market is on the left. Whitechapel Road is a major arterial road in Whitechapel, Tower Hamlets, in the East End of London. It is named after a small chapel of ease dedicated to St Mary and connects Aldgate to the west (as Whitechapel High Street) with Mile End Road to the east. The road is part of the historic Roman road from London to Colchester, now the A11. The road had become built up by the 19th century and is now a main shopping district in the Whitechapel area. Along the road, there is an established market, Whitechapel station and the Royal London Hospital. It remains an important road and is marked with bus lanes, with limited parking. Several ethnic minority communities have centred on Whitechapel Road. The road was a focal point of the Jewish Community from the 1850s to the 1930s, with many Jewish shops and market stalls. Towards the latter part of the 20th century, the street became an established settlement of the British Bangladeshi community, who now sell a range of authentic Asian food and clothes in the market and on shop fronts. Altab Ali Park sits on the site of the original church at the western end of Whitechapel Road, and is a memorial to an Asian worker who suffered a fatal racial attack in 1978. Geography The road's name, along with the area, is derived from the original 14th century White Chapel. It follows the section of the Roman road between Londinium (London) and Camulodunum (Colchester), which connected to the Pye Road to Venta Icenorum (Caistor St Edmund near Norwich). The section of the Roman road that is now Whitechapel Road is a Primary A-road, the A11, and has bus lanes running along its length. Owing to the popularity of the market, parking is heavily restricted, limited to occasional parking metered spaces along the road. Cycle Superhighway CS2 runs along Whitechapel Road. The nearest London Underground stations are Whitechapel station and Aldgate East station and the nearest National Rail station is Bethnal Green railway station. A number of local London Buses routes run along Whitechapel Road, including 25, 205 and 254. History Whitechapel High Street in 1905 The road has been an important thoroughfare and coaching route for centuries. Whitechapel High Street and Whitechapel Road are named as such on John Rocque's Map of London, 1746, both marked as \\"White Chapel\\". On John Cary's \\"Environs of London\\" of 1795 (published in his New Itinerary of 1798) there are properties on both sides of the road. By the ninth edition in 1821, the road is shown as extensively built up. In the mid-19th century, drovers steered livestock from local farms along the road towards Smithfield Market, causing considerable traffic congestion. By the 1870s, the road had become extensively developed with properties along the entire stretch of the road. The Freedom Press Bookshop is on Angel Alley, No. 84b Whitechapel High Street, and was established in the 1880s by Peter Kropotkin and Charlotte Wilson as the first publishing house to deal with anarchism and radical publications. The press has been controversial, and was fire-bombed in 2013, but quickly reopened. The Whitechapel Art Gallery on Whitechapel High Street opened in 1899. It was designed by Charles Harrison Townsend in 1895 and was the first major art gallery in East London. It has shown works of Jackson Pollock, Robert Rauschenberg and David Hockney. It continues to be the centre of the arts scene in the area. St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station on Whitechapel Road, shortly after closure in 1938. The building was destroyed in 1940. The Whitechapel Bell Foundry, a principal supplier of church bells in Britain, was, until its closure in 2017, based at 32‚Äì34 Whitechapel Road. The buildings date from 1670 and are Grade II listed. Originally a coaching inn known as the Artichoke, it was occupied by the foundry from 1738, replacing smaller premises on the north side of the road. Davenant Foundation School moved to No. 173 Whitechapel Road in 1818. The school expanded with a new hall and classrooms in 1896, with further improvements in 1909. However, a decreasing child population meant that in 1965, the school moved to Loughton, Essex. The building remains on the north side and is Grade II listed. Continuing eastwards, Whitechapel station is on the north side of the road, alongside the street market. Behind the tube station is the former site of Blackwall Buildings a set of philanthropic houses built in 1890. Just to the east of the market are almshouses at Trinity House, that were originally built in 1695 for retired seamen. Nearby is the former site of St. Mary's (Whitechapel Road) tube station. It opened in March 1884 but its close proximity to both Whitechapel and Aldgate East tube stations made it superfluous, leading to its closure in April 1938. It was used as an air raid shelter in the Second World War, but was destroyed by bombing in 1940. Opposite to the south is the former Royal London Hospital building, built in 1740. The hospital suffered significant structural damage during the Second World War, but much of the 18th and 19th centuries architecture still remains. A new building now sits adjacent to the original. Whitechapel Road market The Pavilion Theatre opened on Nos.191‚Äì193 Whitechapel Road, the site of a former clothes factory, in 1828. It was the first major theatre to open in the East End of London. The original building was destroyed in a fire in 1856, and was replaced by a larger theatre that could accommodate over 1,000 people, becoming the centre of Yiddish theatre in Britain. It closed in 1934. During the 1940s, the Metropolitan Police attempted to crack down on illegal gambling held in social clubs along Whitechapel Road. The Brancroft Social Club was based at No. 69, and in March 1944, a police raid uncovered unlicensed horse and dog race betting which led to the arrest of the club's owner and 21 patrons. The Albion Brewery was first established at the eastern end of Whitechapel Road in 1808 by Richard Ivory, landlord of the Blind Beggar. In 1860, the brewery was rebuilt, producing an average of 133,000 barrels of beer a year. It closed in 1979. The Eastern District Post Office is based at the eastern end of Whitechapel Road, on the south side. This was the eastern terminus for the former London Post Office Railway (colloquially known as the \\"Mail Rail\\"), built to allow fast mail transfers across London. It closed in 2003. Beyond this is Mile End Gate ‚Äì where the road becomes Mile End Road; and was the site of the former toll gate. Community The East London Mosque has been established on Whitechapel Road since 1985. The road has been the centre of several ethnic minority groups in London. In the 1840s, many Irish emigrated to avoid the Great Famine and began street selling at Whitechapel Market and along Whitechapel Road. The Jewish community settled on and around Whitechapel Road from the 1850s onwards. In the 1880s, the community expanded rapidly as Ashkenazi Jews fled to Britain and took over many of the shops and market stalls on the street. For the remainder of the century and much of the 20th, the road was the focal point of the community. The nearby Jewish Free School was, at one point, the largest educational establishment in the world, with over 4,300 pupils. A fountain opposite the Royal London Hospital in memory of King Edward VII has the inscription \\"erected from subscriptions raised by Jewish inhabitants of East London\\". On 4 October 1936, British Union of Fascists leader Oswald Mosley organised an anti-Jewish parade through the East End that included passing through Whitechapel Road, but was stopped by a crowd of protesters. The sentiment against Jews in Whitechapel Road caused the community to dissolve from the 1930s onwards; the Pavilion Theatre closed and the Jewish Free School was destroyed in the Blitz during the Second World War. The Yiddish newspaper The Jewish Times (Die Zeit) was produced at No. 135 Whitechapel Road from 1913 to 1936. Towards the end of the 20th century, the street, along with nearby Brick Lane became the centre of the British Bangladeshi community. The East London Mosque on Whitechapel Road was opened by Shaykh Abdullah bin Subayl in 1985 and can accommodate over 3,000 worshippers, with dedicated facilities for women. The nearby London Muslim Centre opened in 2003. Whitechapel Market caters well for the community, with stalls stocking Asian fruit and vegetables including okra and mangoes, clothing such as tunics and pashminas, and mobile phone cards for cheap long- distance calls. A racially motivated attack on local worker Altab Ali near Whitechapel Road in May 1978 was a significant event for the local Asian community, and his life is now commemorated in Altab Ali Park at the western end of the road, which was built on the former St Mary's Church grounds. Events The Blind Beggar public house, 337 Whitechapel Road The area around Whitechapel Road is notorious for the 19th century Whitechapel murders, which are believed to be linked to Jack the Ripper. One of the first victims was Martha Tabram, who was found with multiple stab wounds on George Yard Buildings, Whitechapel Road on 7 August 1888. Joseph Merrick, the Elephant Man, moved to Whitechapel Road in 1884. Visitors paid to see him in the back room of a shop owned by showman Tom Norman. The shop was directly opposite the Royal London Hospital, and Merrick was frequently visited by doctors. Merrick later moved to the hospital permanently, where he spent the last years of his life. The Blind Beggar is at No. 337 and was the founding point of the Salvation Army following a meeting outside the pub by William Booth in 1865. On 9 March 1966, the venue became notorious after Ronnie Kray fatally shot George Cornell at the pub. The premises remains open for business, though it has been refurbished several times. The Kray Twins also used the Blackwall Buildings, by then dilapidated, as a form of punishment by locking a victim in a flat alone with Ronnie's German Shepherd dog.

Stone Tracy Co., 220 U.S. 107 (1911), was a United States Supreme Court case in which a taxpayer challenged the validity of a federal income tax on corporations.. The privilege of incorporation is a state function, and the challengers argued that only the states should tax corporations. The Court ruled that the privilege of operating in corporate form is valuable and justifies imposition of a federal income tax: ::The continuity of the business, without interruption by death or dissolution, the transfer of property interests by the disposition of shares of stock, the advantages of business controlled and managed by corporate directors, the general absence of individual liability, these and other things inhere in the advantages of business thus conducted, which do not exist when the same business is conducted by private individuals or partnerships. Background President William Howard Taft proposed a constitutional amendment to allow federal income taxes on individuals and an excise tax \\"upon the privilege of doing business as an artificial entity and of freedom from a general partnership liability enjoyed by those who own the stock\\" on June 16, 1909.President Taft speech of June 16, 1909 The Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which permitted federal income taxation without apportionment, was enacted in 1913; and the Corporation Excise Tax Act, sometimes known as the Corporation Tax Act, was enacted on August 5, 1909 and taxed corporation income at 1%, with the first $5000 exempt.Purpose of ActHistorical perspectives of tax: 1909History of corporate tax rates Dictionaries often cite the case for the definition of excise tax in the United States:Dictionary definitions of excise > Excises are 'taxes laid upon the manufacture, sale, or consumption of > commodities within the country, upon licenses to pursue certain occupations, > and upon corporate privileges.' Cooley, Const. Lim. 7th ed. 680. > The tax under consideration, as we have construed the statute, may be > described as an excise upon the particular privilege of doing business in a > corporate capacity, i. e., with the advantages which arise from corporate or > quasi corporate organization; or, when applied to insurance companies, for > doing the business of such companies. As was said in the Thomas Case, 192 U. > S. supra, the requirement to pay such taxes involves the exercise of > privileges, and the element of absolute and unavoidable demand is lacking. > If business is not done in the manner described in the statute, no tax is > payable.220 U.S. 107, 152 Constitutionality arguments The New International Yearbook reported: ::One of the chief arguments against the constitutionality presented in the public prints was that this is an excise tax on the privilege of doing business in the corporate form; this latter being a privilege derived by franchise from State authorities only, Congress can not impose a burden on it without invading the sovereignty of the States. President Taft in recommending the tax had stated that it is laid \\"upon the privilege of doing business as an artificial entity and the freedom from a general partnership liability enjoyed by those who own stock.\\" While, therefore, it was argued, a tax on the business of a corporation might be constitutional, a tax on the franchise, that is, on the special privileges which the State confers upon the corporation, is an invasion of the State's rights.New International Yearbook (1910 Edition), page 705 According to the Tax History Project, \\"the tax was challenged on the theory that it was a direct tax that had not been apportioned among the states by population.\\"Direct Taxes Under the Constitution: A Review of Precedents, Tax History Project, Alan O. Dixler The U.S. Constitution provides (in part): :The Congress shall have power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises... but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States....U.S. Const., art. I, ¬ß 8, cl. 1. Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers....U.S. Const., art. I, ¬ß 2, cl. 3. No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.U.S. Const., art. I, ¬ß 9, cl. 4. The power to impose taxes, whether direct or indirect, is granted by Article I, section 8, clause 1. Indirect taxes (or \\"duties, imposts and excises,\\" sometimes called simply \\"excises\\") are required to be geographically uniform, according to Article I, section 8, clause 1. Another issue raised in the case was whether section 38 of the Act in question was unconstitutional because it originated in the Senate, in violation of the Origination Clause, section 7 of article 1 of the Constitution, providing that \\"all bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with the amendments, as on other bills.\\" The Court rejected that argument, upholding the statute and ruling that the bill had indeed originated in the House of Representatives: ::...the tariff bill of which the section under consideration is a part, originated in the House of Representatives, and was there a general bill for the collection of revenue. As originally introduced, it contained a plan of inheritance taxation. In the Senate the proposed tax was removed from the bill, and the corporation tax, in a measure, substituted therefor. The bill having properly originated in the House, we perceive no reason in the constitutional provision relied upon why it may not be amended in the Senate in the manner which it was in this case. The amendment was germane to the subject-matter of the bill, and not beyond the power of the Senate to propose. Criticism Henry Campbell Black stated: ::The tax laid by the act of 1909 was specifically denominated a \\"special excise tax\\" and was declared to be imposed \\"with respect to the carrying on or doing doing business by such corporation.\\" This was in reality an income tax very thinly disguised, and restricted to corporations. But the theoretical distinction between a tax on income and a tax on the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity, as measured by income, afforded sufficient ground for the courts to hold that it was not a direct tax and therefore not in conflict with the constitution.A Treatise on the Law of Income Taxation, Henry Campbell Black Similar cases In Quaker City Cab. v. Pennsylvania, the Supreme Court held that the state of Pennsylvania could not discriminate between corporations and individuals and partnerships in imposing taxes on gross receipts of operators of taxicabs: ::The equal protection clause does not detract from the right of the state justly to exert its taxing power or prevent it from adjusting its legislation to differences in situation or forbid classification in that connection, but it does require that the classification be not arbitrary, but based on a real and substantial difference having a reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation.Quaker City Cab v. Pennsylvania, The vote was 6-3, and the dissent by Louis Brandeis cited Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.: ::Why Pennsylvania should have chosen to impose upon corporations a heavier tax than upon individuals or partnerships engaged under like circumstances in the same line of business, or why it should have selected this particular form of tax as the means of doing so, we have no occasion to enquire. The state may have done this, because, in view of the advantages inherent in corporate organization, the Legislature believed that course necessary in order to insure a just distribution of the burdens of government. In Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., this court listed the advantages which justify the imposition of special taxes on corporations‚Ä¶ The Court, 45 years later, explicitly reversed the Quaker City Cab decisionSupreme Court Decisions Overruled by Subsequent Decision, Government Printing Office in upholding an Illinois property tax that was higher on corporations than individuals, and it quoted the dissenting opinion of Holmes in the taxicab case and the Flint v.

He was Archbishop of Abuja from 1994 to 2019 and was made a Cardinal in 2012. He has served as President of the Christian Association of Nigeria, President of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of Nigeria and Bishop of Ilorin. Education and early career Onaiyekan was born in the town of Kabba, in what is now Kogi State, to Bartholomew and Joann Onaiyekan. He attended St. Mary's Catholic School in Kabba from 1949 until 1956, Mount St. Michael's Secondary School in Aliade, Benue State, from 1957 until 1962, and Ss. Peter & Paul Major Seminary in Bodija, Ibadan, from 1963 until 1965. He completed his religious studies in Rome in 1969 and was ordained as a priest on 3 August of that year by Bishop Auguste Delisle of Ilorin. Ahmadu Bello, Premier of Nigeria's Northern Region, had offered him a scholarship to study abroad. Onaiyekan taught at St. Kizito's College, Isanlu, in 1969. He became rector of St. Clement Junior Seminary in Lokoja in 1971. He completed his Licentiate of Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in 1973 and earned his doctorate in 1976. He became Vice Rector of Ss. Peter & Paul in 1977. Church leader In October 1980, Pope John Paul II named Onaiyekan to a five-year term on the International Theological Commission. In November, he joined the International Catholic/Methodist Dialogue Commission. Onaiyekan was consecrated as Auxiliary Bishop of Ilorin, Kwara State, and titular bishop of Thunusuda on 6 January 1983 by Pope John Paul II. He became Bishop of Ilorin in 1984. In 1990 he was named Coadjutor Bishop of the Abuja. When that diocese became an Archdiocese on 26 March 1994, Onaiyekan became its first archbishop.

During the administration of Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, and especially during his second term between 2004 and 2007, Onaiyekan spoke out against the regime for its failure to support democratic principles and its corruption. Speaking in a service in his cathedral in 2005 with the president in attendance, he called on Obasanjo to resist the temptation to stand for a third term, which the Nigerian constitution did not allow, and asked him to \\"resist the deadly temptation to want to remain in power perpetually by hook or by crook\\". His stance was credited with saving Nigeria from the imposition of a dictatorship. He was named Pax Christi International's 2012 Peace Laureate. On 18 September 2012, Pope Benedict XVI named Onaiyekan one of the Synod Fathers for the October 2012 Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization. He was created a Cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in a consistory on 24 November 2012. As Cardinal-Priest he was assigned to the titular church of San Saturnino. On 31 January 2013, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Onaiyekan a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) and a member of the Presidential Committee of the Pontifical Council for the Family. He can hold these positions until his 80th birthday. He was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis. Pope Francis appointed Onaiyekan the Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Ahiara in Imo State in eastern Nigeria on 3 July 2013. Pope Francis appointed him to a five-year renewable term as a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments in October 2016.

Huxley (born 1966) is a chair of the physics department of the University of Edinburgh. Biography Of no relation to Sir Andrew F. Huxley (the English physiologist and biophysicist), Huxley is known in the field of condensed matter physics. While at the CEA laboratory in Grenoble, Huxley was involved in the revolutionary discovery of superconductivity in the ferromagnet UGe2 under applied pressure, in collaboration with a team at the University of Cambridge. This was followed up by a series of breakthroughs in another ferromagnetic material, URhGe [3-5], which was found to turn superconducting under the application of an external magnetic field. This emergence of an unconventional superconducting state by the application of an external tuning parameter such as magnetic field or pressure is hypothesised to be closely related to a 'Quantum critical point' (QCP) - a special phase transition that occurs at temperatures approaching zero kelvins. Quantum fluctuations are enhanced at the QCP, destabilising the conventional phase that dominates under ambient conditions, making conditions propitious for the emergence of a novel unconventional phase such as superconductivity, or possibly even more exotic states. Huxley graduated with a BA from Churchill College, Cambridge, an MS from the University of Pennsylvania, and a PhD from the University of Cambridge. He was subsequently a postdoctoral fellow and then a scientist at CEA, Grenoble before joining the University of Edinburgh as a Professor of Physics in 2006.

It is a water-soluble orange compound is used occasionally for oxidation of organic compounds. It is sometimes called P√©ligot's salt, in recognition of its discoverer Eug√®ne- Melchior P√©ligot. Structure and synthesis Potassium chlorochromate was originally prepared by treating potassium dichromate with hydrochloric acid. An improved route involves the reaction of chromyl chloride and potassium chromate: :K2CrO4 \\\\+ CrO2Cl2 ‚Üí 2KCrO3Cl The salt consists of the tetrahedral chlorochromate anion. The average Cr=O bond length is 159 pm, and the Cr-Cl distance is 219 pm. Reactions Although air-stable, its aqueous solutions undergo hydrolysis. With concentrated hydrochloric acid, it converts to chromyl chloride. When treated with 18-crown-6, it forms the lipophilic salt [K(18-crown-6]CrO3Cl. Peligot's salt can oxidize benzyl alcohol, a reaction which can be catalyzed by acid. A related salt, pyridinium chlorochromate, is more commonly used for this reaction. Safety Potassium chlorochromate can be toxic upon ingestion (may cause acute poisoning and kidney damage amongst other complications) or contact with the human skin (may cause eye burns, irritation, allergy, or ulceration), especially if inhalated.

In January 2015, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) joined Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-MS) in introducing the SKILLS Act (). The bipartisan SKILLS Act would further amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) by requiring state and school districts plan to address the development of effective school library programs to help students gain digital literacy skills, master the knowledge and skills in the challenging academic content standards adopted by the state, and graduate from high school ready for college and careers. The legislation would expand federal investment in school libraries so they can continue to offer students the tools they need to develop the critical thinking, digital, and research skills necessary for success in the twenty-first century. The legislation was previously introduced on June 26, 2007, when Senators Jack Reed of Rhode Island and Thad Cochran of Mississippi introduced and Representatives Raul M. Grijalva of Arizona and Vernon Ehlers of Michigan introduced . Legislative history These bills would amend the provisions of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. In the 110th Congress, S.1699 was referred to Senate committee on June 26, 2007. It was read twice and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. H.R. 2864 was referred to House Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education on September 11, 2007. In the 114th Congress, U.S. Senator Jack Reed (D-RI) and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-MS) introduced the SKILLS Act (S.312) in the U.S. Senate. The bipartisan SKILLS Act would further amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act by requiring state and school districts plan to address the development of effective school library programs to help students gain digital literacy skills, master the knowledge and skills in the challenging academic content standards adopted by the state, and graduate from high school ready for college and careers. Additionally, the legislation would broaden the focus of training, professional development and recruitment activities to include school librarians. The bill would require states and local educational agencies (LEAs) to the extent possible, at least one state certified school library media specialist in every school that receives such funds. Implementation The SKILLS Act authorizes \\"Improving Literacy and College and Career Readiness Through Effective School Library Programs\\" under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) which would provide dedicated funds to develop and enhance effective school library programs, which includes activities to: # acquire up-to-date school library resources, including books and reading materials that are appropriate for all students in all grade levels; # acquire and use advanced technology, incorporated into the curricula of the school, to develop and enhance the digital literacy skills of all students; # facilitate Internet links and other resource-sharing networks among schools and school libraries, and public and academic libraries; # provide professional development in the acquisition of digital literacy skills and literacy instruction that is appropriate for all grades, including activities that foster increased collaboration among school librarians, teachers, and administrators; and # provide students with access to school libraries during non-school hours, including the hours before and after school, during weekends, and during summer vacation periods. On June 26, 2007, Reed and Cochran spoke to dozens of librarians at the American Library Association's Annual Conference in Washington D.C. about the goal of the legislation which is to \\"boost student achievement and improve school libraries by ensuring that all schools have highly qualified librarians and the resources needed to help students keep up with the rapid changes in technology\\" (Whelan) See also *Aliteracy References * Whelan, Debra Lau. \\"Bill Proposes 'Highly Qualified' Librarians.\\" School Library Journal 53.8 (Aug. 2007): 15 External links *American Library Association blog: * ALA-Take Action * District Dispatch - Post details: Only TWO WEEKS Left to Save School Libraries * American Libraries: SKILLs Act Gives High Marks to School Librarians * ALA-AASL - Skills Act of 2007 * School Library Journal: Urge Your Congressmen to Cosponsor the SKILLs Act * I Love Libraries - Protecting one of our nations most important resources Proposed legislation of the 114th United States Congress United States federal education legislation ","title":"Strengthening Kids' Interest in Learning and Libraries Act"},{"id":"13298534","text":"Gardiner Coit Means (June 8, 1896 in Windham, ConnecticutThe Free Dictionary ‚Äì February 15, 1988 in Vienna, Virginia)New York Times obituary was an American economist who worked at Harvard University, where he met lawyer-diplomat Adolf A.

It applies to vehicles such as aircraft and missiles. In skid-to- turn, the vehicle does not roll to a preferred angle. Instead commands to the control surfaces are mixed to produce the maneuver in the desired direction. This is distinct from the coordinated turn used by aircraft pilots. For instance, a vehicle flying horizontally may be turned in the horizontal plane by the application of rudder controls to place the body at a sideslip angle relative to the airflow. This sideslip flow then produces a force in the horizontal plane to turn the vehicle's velocity vector. The benefit of the skid-to-turn maneuver is that it can be performed much quicker than a coordinated turn. This is useful when trying to correct for small errors. The disadvantage occurs if the vehicle has greater maneuverability in one body plane than another. In that case the turns are less efficient and either consume greater thrust or cause a greater loss of aircraft specific energy than coordinated turns.

While other factions of the Democratic Party such as the Blue Dog Coalition, the New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Progressive Caucus, are organized in the Congress, the libertarian faction is not organized in such a way.  Ideology  Libertarian Democrats support the majority of positions of the Democratic Party, but they do not necessarily share identical viewpoints across the political spectrum; that is, they are more likely to support individual and personal freedoms, although rhetorically within the context of Democratic values. Libertarian Democrats oppose NSA warrantless surveillance. In 2013, well over half the House Democrats (111 of 194) voted to defund the NSA's telephone phone surveillance program. Former representative and current Governor Jared Polis, a libertarian-oriented Democrat, wrote in Reason magazine: \\"I believe that libertarians should vote for Democratic candidates, particularly as our Democratic nominees are increasingly more supportive of individual liberty and freedom than Republicans\\". He cited opposition to the Stop Online Piracy Act, support for the legalization of marijuana, support for the separation of church and state, support for abortion rights and individual bodily autonomy, opposition to mass surveillance and support for tax-code reform as areas where the majority of Democrats align well with libertarian values. While maintaining a relatively libertarian ideology, they may differ with the Libertarian Party on issues such as consumer protection, health care reform, anti-trust laws and the overall amount of government involvement in the economy.  History  = Modern era = After election losses in 2004, the Democratic Party reexamined its position on gun control which became a matter of discussion, brought up by Howard Dean, Bill Richardson, Brian Schweitzer and other Democrats who had won in states where Second Amendment rights are important to many voters. The resulting stance on gun control brought in libertarian minded voters, influencing other beliefs. In the 2010s, following the revelations by Edward Snowden about NSA surveillance in 2013, the increasing advent of online decentralization and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the perceived failure of the war on drugs and the police violence in places like Ferguson, Democratic lawmakers such as Senators Ron Wyden, Kirsten Gilibrand and Cory Booker and Representative Jared Polis have worked alongside libertarian Republicans like Senator Rand Paul and Representative Justin Amash to curb what is seen as government overreach in each of these areas, earning plaudits from such traditional libertarian sources as Reason magazine. The growing political power of Silicon Valley, a longtime Democratic stronghold that is friendly to economic deregulation and strong civil liberties protections while maintaining traditionally liberal views on social issues, has also seriously affected the increasingly libertarian leanings of young Democrats. The libertarian faction has influenced the presidential level as well in the post-Bush era. Alaska Senator and presidential aspirant Mike Gravel left the Democratic Party midway through the 2008 presidential election cycle to seek the Libertarian Party presidential nomination, and many anti-war and civil libertarian Democrats were energized by the 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns of libertarian Republican Ron Paul. This constituency has arguably embraced the 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns of independent Democrat Bernie Sanders for the same reasons. In the state of New Hampshire, libertarians operating from the Free State Project have been elected to various offices running as a mixture of both Republicans and Democrats. A 2015 Reuters poll found that 22% of Democratic voters identified themselves as \\"libertarian,\\" more than the percentage of Republicans but less than the percentage of independents.

It is part of the Catterline Gala Weekend and is held annually on the second weekend in June , with the carties being displayed at the gala on the Saturday and then time-trialed down the brae from the Creel Inn to the harbour the following day. It was first held on 11/12 June 2005, when 11 carties were entered. The number of entries has grown in subsequent years, and in 2008 there were 26 carties taking part. Prizes are awarded for the single fastest run (The Connons Shield), fastest aggregate time (Constructors Championship), Best Engineered, Best Decorated, Champagne Moment, Furthest Travelled, Cartie Sprint and \\"The Great Catterline Cartie Race\\". The course is almost exactly 1000 ft (304.8m) long with a drop of almost 100 ft (30.5m) from start to finish, and the carties can reach speeds of around 30 mph at the finish line. As a result, the construction rules require the carties to have adequate brakes and steering. Other than these safety considerations, however, there are very few restrictions on the size and shape of the carties, and as a consequence there tends to be a wide range of designs entered, with many teams eschewing pure speed in favour of colourful novelty carties.

He was an opponent of appeasement and broke the whip on several important occasions, voting to bring down Neville Chamberlain in 1940. A witty and handsome man who very much enjoyed the company of women, Duggan was married only briefly before becoming the plaintiff in a scandalous divorce case. He suffered from ill health; brought up in the Catholic faith, he lapsed in adolescence but returned when on his deathbed. Episodes in his life inspired writers Evelyn Waugh and Anthony Powell to fictionalise him. Family Duggan was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where his father's family had many \\"estancias\\", and was also honorary Attach√© to the Argentine Legation in London.Selina Hastings, \\"Evelyn Waugh: A Biography\\" (Sinclair- Stevenson, London, 1994), p. 454. At an early age the family returned to England where Duggan and his elder brother Alfred Duggan, the historical novelist, were brought up.Selina Hastings, \\"Evelyn Waugh: A Biography\\" (Sinclair-Stevenson, London, 1994), p. 454-455. Alfred Duggan senior was a Roman Catholic and his sons were brought up in that faith, but he died \\"of drink\\" in his early thirtiesAnthony Powell, \\"Infants of the Spring\\", vol. 1 of the Memoirs of Anthony Powell entitled \\"To Keep the Ball Rolling\\" (Heinemann, London, 1976), p. 99. when Duggan was 11.\\"Court Circular\\", The Times, 9 November 1915, p. 11. His immensely rich American mother Grace married leading statesman Lord Curzon in January 1917.\\"Marriage Of Lord Curzon\\", The Times, 3 January 1917, p. 11. Duggan was therefore well-connected with the Conservative Party from an early age. As neither his stepfather nor his mother were Catholic, his faith gradually lapsed.Selina Hastings, \\"Evelyn Waugh: A Biography\\" (Sinclair-Stevenson, London, 1994), p. 455. Duggan regarded his stepfather positively and countered suggestions that the humourless image he projected to the public was accurate in private. In later years he angrily denounced W. Somerset Maugham's comedy Our Betters which gently satirised Americans marrying into aristocratic British families.Anthony Powell, \\"Infants of the Spring\\", vol. 1 of the Memoirs of Anthony Powell entitled \\"To Keep the Ball Rolling\\" (Heinemann, London, 1976), p. 101. Eton Duggan was sent first to Wixenford, a fashionable prep school,Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston, Reminiscences (1955), p. 45 and then to Eton College, where he was placed in Goodhart's House of which he became captain.Anthony Powell, \\"Infants of the Spring\\", vol. 1 of the Memoirs of Anthony Powell entitled \\"To Keep the Ball Rolling\\" (Heinemann, London, 1976), p. 98. His near-contemporary Anthony Powell described him at Eton as reading a great deal despite being \\"never in the least .. part of the Eton .. intellectual world\\". Powell identified Duggan as being witty, something of a show-off, but with a strong vein of melancholy, and a stylish rider in point to point racing.Anthony Powell, \\"Infants of the Spring\\", vol. 1 of the Memoirs of Anthony Powell entitled \\"To Keep the Ball Rolling\\" (Heinemann, London, 1976), p. 100. Evelyn Waugh thought of Duggan as handsome and amusing, but melancholy. Duggan did not complete his studies at Eton owing to ill health. At the age of 18 he underwent an operation for appendicitis\\"Court Circular\\", The Times, 15 March 1923, p. 15. and went to Argentina to convalesce.Anthony Powell, \\"Infants of the Spring\\", vol. 1 of the Memoirs of Anthony Powell entitled \\"To Keep the Ball Rolling\\" (Heinemann, London, 1976), p. 149. When he had recovered, Duggan went up to Christ Church, Oxford in summer term of 1923. He immediately took an intense dislike to life at Oxford, falling into depression and wistfully speaking of the girls of Argentina.Anthony Powell, \\"Infants of the Spring\\", vol. 1 of the Memoirs of Anthony Powell entitled \\"To Keep the Ball Rolling\\" (Heinemann, London, 1976), p. 168. Anthony Powell, who was then at Balliol College, reported once seeing Lord Curzon (then Chancellor of the University) talking to Duggan who had not yet got out of bed.Anthony Powell, \\"Infants of the Spring\\", vol. 1 of the Memoirs of Anthony Powell entitled \\"To Keep the Ball Rolling\\" (Heinemann, London, 1976), p. 169. Army life After only one term, Duggan left Oxford, apparently due to the lack of female company there. Early in 1924, he joined the Life Guards. On 20 December of that year he was promoted to be Second Lieutenant, Supplementary List on probation,London Gazette Issue 33003, p. 15 (19 December 1924). and the appointment was confirmed on 14 November 1925.London Gazette Issue 33102, p. 7 (13 November 1925) On 30 January 1927 he was moved to the regular Army.London Gazette Issue 33246, p. 34 (8 February 1927) Political career He had served only four years before he resigned his commissionLondon Gazette Issue 33381, p. 8 (4 May 1928) on being selected as prospective Conservative Party candidate for East Ham South in 1928.\\"The Times House of Commons 1931\\", p. 85. In the same year he married Miss Joan Dunn, second daughter of Sir James Hamet Dunn.\\"Marriages\\", The Times, 26 May 1928, p. 15. Duggan spent more than a year 'nursing' his prospective constituency, which was narrowly held by the Labour Party; in the 1929 general election he argued that the Ford factory would only be built locally if 'safeguarding' of industries was continued.\\"East And West Ham\\", The Times, 18 May 1929, p. 7. He lost the election as the Labour majority increased to 10,102 votes.\\"The Times House of Commons 1929\\", p. 40. Divorce case and love life On 1 November 1929 Duggan was granted a divorce on grounds of his wife's adultery with Anthony Jenkinson. The President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division stated that petitioner Duggan was absent from home because of his position as a Parliamentary candidate, and criticised the \\"social crimes\\" of Jenkinson in insinuating himself into Mrs Duggan's life. Duggan was granted custody of a child born to his wife on 5 August 1929.\\"Decree Nisi For Peeress's Son\\", The Times, 2 November 1929, p. 4. (Jenkinson, who subsequently married Duggan's ex-wife, committed suicide in October 1935.\\"Death of Mr. Anthony Jenkinson\\", The Times, 30 October 1935, p. 11.) Duggan had many affairs, both before and after his marriage. Among those was with Lady Mary (Maimie) Lygon (third daughter of the 7th Earl Beauchamp), Lady Bridget Parsons (daughter of the 5th Earl of Rosse), Diana Fellowes, and Daphne Weymouth. Election for Acton Meanwhile, Duggan decided not to fight East Ham again,The Times, 7 November 1929, p. 11. He was adopted for Acton in 1930, a seat which Labour held by 467 votes. At the 1931 general election, he gained the seat by a majority of 12,272. He was swiftly appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Euan Wallace, Civil Lord of the Admiralty.\\"Ministers' Secretaries\\", The Times, 19 November 1931, p. 14. Parliamentary activity In April 1932, Duggan made a speech supporting the government's Sunday Performances (Regulation) Bill, which sought to allow cinemas to open on a Sunday. He argued that prohibiting Sunday opening would be \\"a breach of the principle of religious tolerance\\".\\"House Of Commons\\", The Times, 14 April 1932, p. 8. However, Duggan did not prove to be a particularly active Member of Parliament, and spoke only very rarely. His majority was more than halved to 5,578 at the 1935 general election.\\"The Times House of Commons 1935\\", p. 109. He began the new Parliament by joining with other Conservative members to put down a motion opposing \\"the transfer into any other hands of British Colonies or British Mandated Territories\\".\\"'An Inalienable Trust'\\", The Times, 11 February 1936, p. 8. In March 1936 he argued that the Derating Act, which removed local taxation from industries and had been brought in to tackle the depression, was acting to move industry to the South of England and should be withdrawn in order to keep industry in the North of England.\\"House Of Commons\\", The Times, 12 March 1936, p. 8. Opposition to appeasement Duggan seconded an amendment moved by Alan Lennox-Boyd to a Labour Party motion on food storage in wartime in February 1938, during which he argued that Britain had \\"no such menace as that of the German Fleet in 1914, and there was no submarine menace comparable to that of 1914\\".\\"House Of Commons\\", The Times, 10 February 1938, p. 8. However, he was allied with Winston Churchill on the threat in Europe, and abstained rather than support the Government in a vote of censure over the resignation of Anthony Eden later that month.\\"Commons Back To Normal\\", The Times, 24 February 1938, p. 12. In the spring of 1938 Duggan was a member of an informal group of young Conservative back-benchers who called themselves \\"The Group\\" and met to discuss foreign affairs; the Conservative whips derided them as \\"the Glamour Boys\\".Neville Thompson, \\"The Anti-Appeasers\\", Oxford University Press, 1971, p. 167-8. When the Munich Agreement was put to the vote in October 1938, Duggan also abstained.\\"The Division And After\\", The Times, 7 October 1938, p. 8. With the broad group of anti-appeasement Members, he signed a motion calling for a National Government on the \\"widest possible basis\\" in March 1939.\\"Government Policy\\", The Times, 29 March 1939, p. 16. Second World War On the outbreak of the Second World War, Duggan rejoined the Life Guards as a lieutenant, apparently in spite of medical advice.Correspondence to The Times Obituary columns, 30 October 1943, p. 6 Wearing his military uniform, he voted against Neville Chamberlain in the Norway Debate in May 1940, thereby contributing to his fall.\\"The Division And After\\", The Times, 9 May 1940, p. 6. Later that year he ceased to serve on active duty. His health declined but he insisted that he would not be invalided out of the Army. Illness From the late 1930s, Duggan was living with his mistress Phyllis de Janz√© in a small house in Chapel Street, Belgravia. He was much affected by de Janz√©'s death in April 1943. That July, Duggan fell gravely ill with tuberculosis, and was confined to hospital where he was operated on.\\"Invalids\\", The Times, 28 August 1943, p. 4. However, Duggan did not improve, and on 14 September he was removed from the Reserve of Officers and granted the honorary rank of captain.London Gazette Issue 36168, p. 2 (10 September 1943) Death and literary model While on his deathbed, Duggan was visited by his friend Evelyn Waugh (Duggan was god-father to Waugh's daughter Margaret). On 12 October Duggan told Waugh that he was thinking of returning to the Catholic faith from which had been estranged since his youth, but was reluctant to repent of his life with Phyllis de Janz√© because it would be to betray her.\\"Diaries of Evelyn Waugh\\" ed. by Michael Davie (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1976), p. 552. The next day Waugh brought a priest, Father Devas of Farm Street Chapel, to see Duggan. Duggan's sister Marcella Rice did not want the priest to go in to see him, but Waugh insisted and Duggan was given absolution, replying \\"Thank you, father\\". Later that day Waugh and Devas returned with the offer to anoint Duggan; Duggan was reluctant but eventually crossed himself to indicate his acceptance and after receiving the ceremony told Waugh \\"When I became a Catholic it was not through fear\\".\\"Diaries of Evelyn Waugh\\" ed. by Michael Davie (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1976), p. 552-3. Waugh later transposed this scene into his novel Brideshead Revisited.Christopher Howse, \\"Michael Gambon in Brideshead Revisited\\", The Daily Telegraph, 4 August 2007.

Early life Josephine Beatrice Bowman was born in Des Moines, Iowa, on 19 December 1881. She graduated from nurses' training at the Medico-Chirurgical Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1904 and soon enrolled with the American Red Cross Nursing Service. In the spring of 1908, Bowman took part in the first Red Cross disaster relief operation after a tornado caused extensive damage around Hattiesburg, Mississippi. Navy Nurse Corps career On 3 October 1908, Bowman joined the newly established U.S. Navy Nurse Corps as one of its first twenty members (the \\"Sacred Twenty\\"). She was promoted to Chief Nurse in 1911. Chief Nurse Bowman temporarily left the Navy in October 1914 and spent the next several months as a Red Cross nurse caring for war casualties in Great Britain. As the supervising nurse of Unit D, she served at Royal Naval Hospital Haslar, England, for six months. She returned to the Navy in May 1915. In early 1916 she arrived in Guam to conduct a two-year course with three other nurses in modern midwifery and practical nursing at the Navy Nurse's training school in Guam for the local Chamorro women. She also chaired the Department of Physiology and Hygiene at the normal school. After the U.S. entered World War I, she became chief nurse at the Naval Hospital, Great Lakes, Illinois, and guided its nursing staff during that facility's great expansion to meet the needs of war and the 1918-19 influenza epidemic. She also served as chief nurse at Fort Lyon, Colorado, a Navy tuberculosis sanitarium for sailors and marines. In 1919, Chief Nurse Bowman led the first contingent of Navy nurses assigned to the hospital ship USS Relief (AH-1), the first Navy women to serve at sea. She became superintendent of the Navy Nurse Corps in December 1922 and held that position for over twelve years, until her retirement at the beginning of 1935. Contributions as superintendent As superintendent, Bowman worked hard to recruit nurses for the Navy Nurse Corps and to improve the pay benefits and uniforms for the nurses. She advocated for military status and encouraged postgraduate education. Inspections were increased for the purpose of establishing uniform standards across all naval hospitals. Later life Grave at Arlington National Cemetery Following her departure from active duty, she made her home in Pennsylvania and stayed active in national and local nursing affairs. When Navy nurses were included in the Navy's ranking system, she received the retirement rank of lieutenant commander in recognition of her service as Nurse Corps' superintendent.

It is never more than 7 miles (11 km) from City Square, Leeds, but is mainly rural with extensive views in the outlying areas of the Leeds metropolitan district. It follows public Rights of Way including footpaths, bridleways and minor lanes, with a few short sections along roads. History A route was first devised by Fred Andrews of the Ramblers Association, and then developed by West Yorkshire County Council in the early 1980s. This council was abolished in 1986, and the path is now under the care of the Countryside section of Leeds City Council. The Leeds Country Way was realigned in 2006, using a route devised by Bob Brewster, to bring it entirely within the boundary of the Leeds metropolitan district (previously it crossed the boundary into Wakefield), and the path was officially relaunched on 26 September 2006 with a revised set of map leaflets (see external links) and improved waymarking. (With link to audio file) Route The path is waymarked in both directions and can be started at any point, but is described here clockwise from the A660 road at Golden Acre Park (), divided into parts and sections which correspond with the official map leaflets. =Part 1: Golden Acre to Barwick-in-Elmet = Golden Acre Park Section 1: The path crosses Golden Acre Park and passes the Yorkshire Wildlife Trust's Adel Dam Nature Reserve, following the route of the Meanwood Valley Trail. It coincides briefly with the Leeds link to the Dales Way north of Eccup Reservoir, before crossing the Ebor Way and entering the Harewood Estate. Here there is a glimpse of what looks like a small village, not marked on any map, but which is actually the set for the TV series Emmerdale. Walkers may also see red kites which have been successfully reintroduced in this area. Section 2: After crossing the A61, the way passes north of Wike and reaches the village of Bardsey with its Anglo-Saxon church tower and the Bingley Arms public house, which claims to be the oldest in England. The way turns south, crossing the A58, to Scarcroft. Section 3: The path continues through Thorner, crossing the A64 before entering Barwick-in-Elmet () with England's tallest maypole, a Norman motte and an Iron Age fort. =Part 2: Barwick-in-Elmet to Carlton = River Aire at Swillington Section 1: From Barwick the way passes the southern corner of Scholes, then crosses the M1 motorway and enters Garforth. Section 2: It leaves Garforth along the disused Garforth-Kippax railway line (part of the North Eastern Railway and earlier the Leeds, Castleford and Pontefract Junction Railway), then approaches Swillington and passes Little Preston Old Hall. It skirts St Aidan's Country Park, and crosses the River Aire at Swillington Bridge. The path follows the river downstream, past the marina at Fleet Bridge. Section 3: The path continues along the river, here forming the Aire and Calder Navigation, to Mickletown, and then turns south to Methley. It swings eastward, crosses the A642 and continues to Carlton (), heart of the West Yorkshire Rhubarb Triangle. =Part 3: Carlton to Cockersdale = Woodkirk church Section 1: From Carlton the path crosses fields before briefly joining the A61 and recrossing the M1 south of Robin Hood. It turns south across the M62, follows the valley of Dolphin Beck, and reaches East Ardsley on the A650. Section 2: From here the path skirts south of West Ardsley, and reaches Woodkirk with its historic church, on the A653. It passes the ruins of Howley Hall (built 1590 for Sir John Savile) (See \\"History\\" page) before dropping down to reach Scotchman Lane. Section 3: A track through Birkby Brow Wood, just inside the Leeds-Kirklees boundary, leads to the A643, which is followed to recross the M62. The path's longest section of road walking follows the A650 through Gildersome, then a series of field paths leads to Cockersdale (), on the A58 near Tong. =Part 4: Cockersdale to Golden Acre = LCW near Horsforth Section 1: The path follows the valley of Cockersdale, and then goes along Tong Beck, below Fulneck Moravian Settlement, skirting the south of Pudsey. At this point Tong Beck forms the Leeds-Bradford boundary. The path crosses the Leeds to Bradford railway and meets the busy A647 at Thornbury. Section 2: Passing playing fields and old quarries, the path crosses the Woodhall Hills and follows Fagley Beck to cross the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the River Aire at Apperley Bridge, then follows the river past Woodhouse Grove School before climbing up to meet the A65 south of Rawdon. Section 3: From here the path skirts Horsforth, follows for a time the southern boundary of Leeds Bradford International Airport, and goes round the northern edge of Cookridge, before crossing Breary Marsh Local Nature Reserve to return to Golden Acre Park (). Practical aspects As the route is circular it can be started at any point, but the description in the official leaflets starts and finishes at Golden Acre Park, going clockwise. These divide it into four parts each split into three sections, but walkers can choose to divide it in various ways as there are many bus routes and several railway stations (Woodlesford, Garforth, New Pudsey and Horsforth) on or near the path. West Yorkshire Metro provides information about bus routes serving the path and train services in the area. The Ordnance Survey maps covering the route are: * Landranger 1:50,000 sheet 104 (Leeds: covers almost the whole route) and 105 (York: needed for a short distance near Garforth) * Explorer 1:25,000 sheets 289 (Leeds: Golden Acre Park clockwise to Scotchman Lane) and 288 (Bradford: Scotchman Lane clockwise to Golden Acre Park). The route is waymarked with an owl symbol, taken from the Leeds coat of arms. The original route of the path is used for an annual trail running relay race organised by Kippax Harriers. Teams of twelve, with two runners taking each of six sections, complete the route in about seven hours.

Plot Julie asks Susan if she can go to a party. However, Mike tells Susan that he would rather Susan forbade her daughter to go due to the fact he has seen some crazy parties in the house where Julie is going. Even though Susan had already given Julie permission to go to the party, she sides with Mike and Julie is banned. However, Susan decides to go behind Mike‚Äôs back and tells Julie she just wanted Mike to feel as if he were part of the decision-making process, and she allows Julie to attend the party. Later that night Mike tells Susan he drove past the house earlier on and saw things like girls running around topless, people staggering around drunk and music blaring. Susan says she needs to run to the store, and she runs to the party to pick up Julie and Dylan. Mike later finds out about Susan‚Äôs lie and tells Susan that he respects her decisions on how to raise Julie how she wants, as Julie is her child. Dylan is walking by Mrs. McCluskey's, and she strikes up a conversation with Dylan about how she used to always see her playing on her tricycle around the neighborhood with her father close behind. Later, she waits until Katherine leaves then grabs her family photo album. She comes across a baby picture of herself and the picture of her father cropped off from the family portrait, but hides it quickly when her mom comes into the room. Lynette Scavo asks during her lunch if anyone would like to attend chemotherapy with her, seeing as she kicked Tom out for being too emotional. Bree, Susan and even Katherine all offer to do it; however Gabrielle pretends to not hear the question and Lynette confronts her about it. Gabrielle gives in and decides to go with Lynette. However, when she is there to entertain Lynette, she seems uncomfortable and awkward, constantly finds reasons to leave the room and disappear for hours. Seeing Lynette‚Äôs frustration and hurt, Gabrielle reveals that when she was five, her father died from cancer, and her mother told her not to cry because she wanted her husband to feel well dying and not see his daughter cry. She said she smiled all night ‚Äì even after he had died ‚Äì and later made a great career (as a model) where all she had to do was smile. She fights back tears when she tells Lynette she is so scared of losing her that she cannot pretend to smile. Lynette is choked up and promises her she will not die.

During the lunch, everyone tries the pie Bree has brought. Susan and Gabrielle tell her that it is the best she has ever made. However, when Bree tries it, she realizes that it is not hers and stares over at Katherine. Katherine comes clean and announces that she swapped hers with Bree‚Äôs so that everyone could try it. Bree, furious about Katherine's deceit and largely irate about Katherine upstaging her pie, desperately tries to figure out Katherine‚Äôs secret ingredient. When that doesn‚Äôt work she gives Katherine her meat pie recipe and then asks nicely for Katherine's lemon meringue pie recipe. Katherine refuses, but Bree keeps pushing it. They get into a verbal tussle. In her determination, Bree breaks into the Mayfair house to steal it, only to find that Katherine padlocks her recipe box.

Unusually for an NFL player, Crist never played college football. A star quarterback and defensive back in high school football and a standout on the basketball court as well, Crist received an athletic scholarship to Penn State University. Believing himself to be capable of playing quarterback at a high level, he insisted on playing that position if he were to play football, but Penn State coach Joe Paterno insisted he play defensive back. Rebuffing Paterno's request, Crist instead used his scholarship to play college basketball, where he played four years for the Nittany Lions. Crist's reputation as a defensive back was nevertheless still high enough even after not playing college football that the Giants signed him as an undrafted free agent upon graduating in 1972. This time, he agreed to play defensive back, where he spent all seven years of his professional career, never playing quarterback again.Kindberg, Scott (2014).

After Silyn‚Äôs early death in 1930, his widow, Mary Silyn Roberts, succeeded him as Secretary, also a lecturer, and the association continued to grow, with over 3,000 learners by the 1940s.Brooks in England (ed.), 2007 Coleg Harlech was founded in 1927 by Thomas Jones, Cabinet Secretary to both David Lloyd George and Stanley Baldwin, to continue the work of WEA in a residential environment. On 1 August 2001, the Workers‚Äô Educational Association (North Wales) and Coleg Harlech merged to form Coleg Harlech WEA (North). The merged Association continued the common longstanding tradition of liberal arts adult education to enable adults to develop their capacity to learn and fulfil their potential, but also continued to enlarge this by developing vocational education and training, including providing opportunities for socially and educationally disadvantaged adults both in residence at Harlech and in communities and workplaces across North and Mid Wales. =WEA publications= In its heyday, the WEA in Wales published ‚Äò‚ÄôThe Highway‚Äô‚Äô in English, and ‚Äò‚ÄôLleufer‚Äô‚Äô in Welsh, the latter under the editorship of David Thomas.Tomos in England (ed.), 2007 =YMCA Community College= YMCA Community College was an independent body linked to the wider YMCA movement.

It extends for in a northwest‚Äìsoutheast direction from an intersection with NY 46 in the city of Oneida to a junction with NY 31 in the hamlet of Oneida Valley, located in the town of Lenox. NY 316 serves as a connector between Oneida Lake and the city of Oneida, and it parallels Oneida Creek for its entire length. The route was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, following what had previously been part of NY 31 during the 1920s. Route description NY 316 heading northbound from its terminus at NY 46 in Oneida NY 316 begins at an intersection with NY 46 in the outer reaches of the city of Oneida. The road heads to the northwest as the two-lane Lake Road, immediately passing through the linear Old Erie Canal State Historic Park before meeting County Route 76 (CR 76, named Canal Street) at a junction just outside the park limits. From CR 76, NY 316 runs past a handful of isolated homes and farms as it parallels Oneida Creek through the rural, northern section of the city. It eventually crosses into the town of Lenox, where it passes to the east of Kanon Valley Country Club a short distance from the town line. The town line also marks a change in the route's surroundings as the scattered homes give way to undeveloped open fields. NY 316 continues along the western edge of the creek, connecting to CR 11 (Oneida Valley Road) prior to entering the hamlet of Oneida Valley. Here, NY 316 ends at a junction with NY 31 roughly southeast of Oneida Lake. History When NY 31 was assigned in the mid-1920s, it initially served the city of Oneida instead of bypassing it to the north as it does today. NY 31 turned southeast at the hamlet of Oneida Valley, following what is now NY 316 and NY 46 into downtown Oneida, where it ended at NY 5. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 31 was realigned to follow its modern alignment east to Verona while its former alignment into Oneida was redesignated as NY 316. The route originally extended southward into downtown Oneida by way of an overlap with NY 46; however, the concurrency was eliminated by 1970.

It was written by Joey Murphy and John Pardee and directed by Bethany Rooney. It is the third episode of the show‚Äôs fourth season and aired on October 14, 2007. Plot Susan plans a charades get-together for her neighbors. Her girlfriends Bree, Lynette and Gabrielle first make up excuses to get out of the evening, but later change their minds after hearing gossip about a fight in the Mayfair home. (see Smiles of a Summer Night.) They decide to try to get Katherine very drunk at the party to see if they can coax any kind of information out of her. Susan asks Bree for the name of Bree‚Äôs gynecologist. As Bree doesn't actually have one, she pretends not to remember his name. As Susan remains persistent, Bree walks into the house, opens the telephone book and blindly picks a doctor‚Äôs name and gives it to Susan. When Susan goes to her appointment she discovers that the office is filthy and full of junkies. Susan confronts Bree about it at the party, and while Bree is horrified and incredibly apologetic, she can not give Susan an explanation. Earlier in the episode, Adam is washing his car when a random young blonde woman jogs by and asks to drink from his garden hose. Katherine then bitterly confronts him for flirting, alluding to the fact that this might be a recurring character trait with Adam. Lynette‚Äôs mom, fed up with seeing her daughter too sick to eat from her chemotherapy, buys weed from Andrew, bakes it into brownies, and has Lynette‚Äôs son Parker tell her he made them in order to get Lynette to eat them. Lynette, originally too weak and sick to make it to Susan‚Äôs party, suddenly feels great ‚Äì unknowingly thanks to the brownies ‚Äì and shows up to the charades party stoned. Carlos begs Gabrielle to give him just two more weeks to dump Edie, and she reluctantly agrees. However, when getting ready for Susan‚Äôs party, Edie tells Carlos that she plans on announcing their engagement. Carlos is completely against this and asks Edie to not tell anyone yet. Edie agrees, but has secretly purchased an engagement ring for herself to wear. She pulls it out at the party. Gabrielle sees the ring, and angrily pulls Carlos aside. He explains that it will be taken care of, and he needs more time. Gabrielle is not satisfied with this, so she goes into the house and flirts with Adam to make Carlos jealous. Carlos breaks a glass in his fury and Katherine is mad as well. Edie pulls Katherine aside to explain Gabrielle‚Äôs ‚Äúreputation‚Äù around Wisteria Lane. After Gabrielle accidentally spills her drink all over Adam, Katherine confronts Gabrielle in front of everyone, citing her reputation. Gabrielle is indignant and demands that she explain herself, and Katherine tells her in front of everyone at the party that she knows about her affair with her teenage gardener. Gabrielle, in her blind fury, spills the secret that Bree saw her slap Dylan when she asked about her father. Katherine keeps her already cool composure and admits that while she did lose her temper with Dylan, Dylan‚Äôs father had done the most horrible thing a father could possibly do to his daughter. Gabrielle sees Victor in a bedroom at Susan's house crunching poll numbers. She tries to console him and attempts to reassure him that her affair with John was a long time ago and not a big deal. Victor says that he's not jealous at all, he just wants to figure out how it will affect his poll numbers when he's running for Governor. After that, Gabrielle catches Carlos in Susan's bathroom and kisses him. They admit their feelings for each other. Just before Gabrielle and Victor leave the party, Victor has a moment alone with Carlos, asking how he could have not killed John for sleeping with his wife. Carlos says that as much as he wanted to, it wasn't worth going to jail over. Victor chuckles and states that, if you're rich, you can make anybody disappear. Gabrielle then comes down the stairs, and she and Victor leave together. Meanwhile, while the adults are at the party, Dylan and Julie are studying together at the Mayfair house. Dylan tells Julie about her mother freaking out at her over asking about her father, and says that there is a lot of old stuff stored in the bedroom upstairs, but it‚Äôs locked. Julie picks the lock and the girls start going through the boxes. Julie informs Dylan that this was, in fact, her old bedroom, not the one she is in now like her mother said. Katherine then walks in and catches them, and sends Julie home. Adam and Katherine are in the third floor bedroom getting it ready for Dylan to move in, in order to ‚Äústifle‚Äù her curiosity. Adam asks why Katherine had described Dylan‚Äôs father to everyone as doing \\"the worst possible thing a father could do to a child\\". Katherine said that it made people feel uncomfortable, and uncomfortable people don't ask questions. At the end, Katherine lifts up the rug, kneels down to touch a dent in the hardwood floor, and starts to cry.

It is also part of the Great Arctic State Nature Reserve, the largest nature reserve of Russia.Nature Reserve History In 1935, during Soviet times, an Arctic station was established in Russky Island. This outpost was part of the building of a modern polar station network undertaken by the Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route (GUSMP) between 1932 and 1940. Besides taking meteorological measurements, the purpose of Russky Island's station was to monitor Arctic navigation along the Northern Sea Route. One of the route's branches coming from the Vilkitsky Strait passed right off Russky Island's NW shores. For many years this lonely Arctic station was the only permanently inhabited place in the whole Nordenski√∂ld Archipelago. In 1939, the workers of the Russky Island station made the measuring of the ice layer and the height of embacles (accumulated broken ice) on the perpendicular to the bank section as a present to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.F. Romanenko, O. Shilovtseva. Russian-Soviet polar stations and their role in the Arctic Seas exploration. Moscow State University, Geography Department, 1998 On 25 August 1942, during Operation Wunderland, Kriegsmarine heavy cruiser Admiral Scheer fell upon the Russian icebreaker Sibiryakov (under the command of Captain Kacharev) right off the northwest coast of Russky Island while prowling the waters off the northern end of the Nordenski√∂ld Archipelago. The Sibiryakov was sunk in an unequal battle. Then Admiral Scheer headed southwest in order to attack the Soviet military installations at Dikson. Scientific research on Russky Island, including the monitoring of animal species on the island (lemming, purple sandpiper, turnstone, sanderling, and little stint) was conducted after the breakup of the Soviet Union, but the Arctic station was closed in 1999.

St Paul's Church, Sheffield, was a chapel of ease to Sheffield Parish Church. By 1700, Sheffield's population had reached 5,000, and a second Anglican place of worship was required to house a growing congregation. A site on the southern edge of the town was selected, facing on to Pinstone Lane (later redeveloped as Pinstone Street). A public subscription was raised, and St Paul's was largely completed by 1721. The church was built in the Baroque style, with the street frontage dominated by an Italianate tower.Ruth Harman and John Minnis, Pevsner Architectural Guides: Sheffield The chapel had seating for 1,200 people.George Lawton, Collectio rerum ecclesiasticarum de di≈ìcesi Eboracensi Map of Sheffield in 1736. St Paul's is numbered \\"2\\", towards the south west of the map. A dispute over patronage prevented the chapel from opening until 1740. Robert Downes, a local goldsmith, had paid ¬£1,000 towards its construction and promised a further ¬£30 a year, on condition that he and his descendants would have the right to appoint its minister. However, the Vicar of Sheffield objected that, as St Paul's was a chapel of ease to his own church, he had the right to appoint a minister. In 1739, angered by the stand- off, Downes threatened to open the building as a chapel for Dissenters. A compromise was finally reached that the Vicar would have the right to choose the minister, but that the first minister would be a relative of Downes.David Lunn, Chapters towards a history of the Cathedral Church of St Peter and St Paul, Sheffield This required an Act of Parliament, following which, it was consecrated to Saint Paul on 22 May 1740.

In 1824, the church was placed in its own parish.Sheffield Archives: Bishop's Transcripts A memorial to Reverend Alexander Mackenzie, designed by Francis Legatt Chantrey, was added around this time. Following slum clearance in the 1930s, the church's congregation slumped, and St Paul's closed in 1937. It was demolished the following year, and the St Paul's Gardens were laid out on the site, later becoming known as the Peace Gardens.

He is most notable for playing for Clyde ‚Äì during his time there he scored 91 goals in 111 league appearances and won his two Scotland caps ‚Äì and Sheffield United, for whom he scored 30 goals in 42 appearances. Playing career =Scotland= Boyd was born in Cambuslang and began his career with Regent Star Rutherglen. Whilst playing for Junior side Larkhall Thistle he scored over 200 goals in three seasons. This prodigious goal-scoring form led to a transfer to Clyde. Boyd currently holds Clyde's record for the most goals in a season, scoring 32 in 1932‚Äì33. This feat got him noticed by the English clubs, and in December 1933, he was transferred to Sheffield United. =England= At Sheffield United, Boyd was a regular starter, making 22 appearances in his first season in the First Division. However, his 15 goals were not enough to save the Blades from relegation, as they finished in last place. Boyd stayed with the club as they went into Division Two, and scored another 15 goals in 20 appearances. His goalscoring prowess was noticed by Manchester United, who signed him in February 1935. However, his tenure at Old Trafford only lasted a few months, and he was sold on to Workington in September of the same year. He moved back into the Football League set-up in December 1935 when he was signed by Luton Town. There, he scored a creditable 11 goals in only 13 appearances, before moving on to Southampton. By the time he arrived at The Dell he was past his prime. According to Holley & Chalk, \\"he was renowned for having an erratic temperament (so) it was not surprising that his sojourn at the Dell was short\\". He made his debut on the opening day of the 1936‚Äì37 season, playing alongside fellow new signing Jimmy Dunne and Saints stalwart Arthur Holt, but he failed to live up to expectations and by January had lost his place to Dick Neal. In his brief Southampton career, he scored seven goals in 19 games, before moving on to Weymouth in August 1937, and then back to Workington, where he retired. =International= Boyd only made two appearances for Scotland, both in 1931. His international debut came on 20 May 1931 in a 3‚Äì0 loss to Italy. This was followed by a second, and final, appearance against Switzerland four days later. The match was won 3‚Äì2, with Boyd scoring the second of Scotland's three goals. He also played three times and scored three goals for the Scottish Football League XI, with all his caps coming against the Irish League XI.(SFL player) William Gillespie Boyd, London Hearts Supporters Club References External links *International profile at londonhearts.com * 1905 births 1967 deaths Scottish footballers Association football forwards Scotland international footballers Clyde F.C. players Sheffield United F.C. players Manchester United F.C. players Workington A.F.C. players Luton Town F.C. players Southampton F.C. players Weymouth F.C. players Sportspeople from Cambuslang English Football League players Scottish Football League players Scottish Football League representative players Larkhall Thistle F.C. players Scottish Junior Football Association players ","title":"Billy Boyd (footballer)"},{"id":"13299058","text":"Jane Yardley is an English author, raised in a village in 1960s Essex, (where most of her novels are set).

An investigation by the Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria, Portugal's criminal police, concluded that she had been murdered by her mother, Leonor Cipriano, and her uncle, Jo√£o Cipriano, after witnessing them engaged in incestuous sex. Her body was never found. The mother and uncle confessed to police in October 2004; the uncle said he had cut the girl's body into pieces before disposing of it by throwing it into a nearby pigsty. Joana's mother withdrew her confession the day after signing it, alleging that she had been beaten during a 48-hour-long interrogation. The police officers accounted for the bruising on the mother's face and body by maintaining that she had thrown herself down some stairs in the police station in an effort to commit suicide. Both the mother and uncle were convicted of murder and sentenced to sixteen years in jail. It was the first murder trial in Portuguese legal history to take place without the discovery of a body. Five officers were charged with a variety of offences as a result of the allegations of assault; three were acquitted. One of the two officers who was convicted, Chief Inspector Gon√ßalo Amaral, led the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann, a British girl who went missing in May 2007 from the nearby resort of Praia da Luz. Amaral was not present during the alleged assault, but was accused of having covered up for other officers; he was convicted of having falsified police documents in the case and received an eighteen-month suspended sentence. Several similarities between the cases‚Äîboth girls vanished without trace within 11 kilometers (7 miles) and less than three years of each other, both cases had officers who failed to secure the crime scene, both mothers mounted campaigns to find their daughters and both women were accused of involvement‚Äîprompted Joana's family to appeal in 2008 for police to investigate whether there was a link between the disappearances. Disappearance and charges Joana Cipriano, eight years old at the time, was last seen at around 8 pm on the evening she disappeared, after being sent to buy milk and a tin of tuna from a local store. A neighbour saw her around 200 meters from her house, walking back from the store. Her mother, Leonor Cipriano, launched a local campaign to find her daughter, distributing posters around the neighbourhood. The prosecution argued that Joana was killed because she had seen her mother and Jo√£o Cipriano, her mother's brother, having sex. Leonor confessed to killing her daughter after nearly 48 hours of continuous interrogation. Her brother confessed to having assaulted Joana, and said he had cut her body into small pieces and placed her inside a refrigerator, before disposing of it by throwing it into a nearby pigsty. When he was asked if he had sexually abused Joana, he said, \\"I did not harm her - I only killed her.\\" In 2019, Leonor Cipriano was released from prison after serving five sixths of her sentence. Controversy =Allegations of police misconduct= Leonor retracted her confession the day after making it, claiming she had been beaten. She suffered extensive bruising to her face and body, which the police said was caused by her throwing herself down some stairs in the police station in an effort to kill herself. Five officers, including Gon√ßalo Amaral, head of the regional Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria in Portim√£o at the time, were charged with a number of offences. The indictment alleged that several of them had kicked Leonor, hit her with a cardboard tube, put a plastic bag over her head, and made her kneel on glass ashtrays. Three officers, Leonel Marques, Paulo Pereira Crist√≥v√£o and Paulo Marques Bom, were acquitted of torture. Amaral was not present at the time of the alleged beating but was accused of having covered up for the other officers, which he denied. * He was convicted of perjury in May 2009 for having falsified documents in the case, and received an eighteen-month suspended sentence. Another officer, Ant√≥nio Nunes Cardoso, was also found guilty of having falsified documents and received a -year suspended sentence. =Comparison to McCann case= The village of Figueira is only 11 kilometers from Praia da Luz, where Madeleine McCann disappeared on 3 May 2007. In both cases the mothers launched campaigns to find their daughters and in both cases the local Pol√≠cia Judici√°ria investigated the possibility that the mothers had killed their daughters. * (Note: paperback edition). A child protection specialist, Mark Williams-Thomas, who believes that Joana's and Madeleine's disappearances are related, said that the disappearance of two children unknown to each other, within a period of four years in a seven-mile radius, would be a huge coincidence, especially considering that Portugal is a small country with few abductions. Before Joana's disappearance, the previous first- degree murder of a child in the Algarve region was in November 1990 and involved a British girl, nine-year-old Rachel Charles, who was abducted and murdered in Albufeira. Her body was found three days later; a British mechanic and friend of the family, Michael Cook, was arrested and convicted. *On 19 June 1996 a six-year-old German child, Ren√® Has√®e, also disappeared, from the Amoreira beach near Aljezur while walking a few metres ahead of his parents; see The Doe Network: Case File 2075DMPRT and \\"Rene Hasee vermisst seit dem 19.Juni 1996\\".

He started his career as a scrum-half but now plays as a fly-half and occasional fullback and is the all-time leading points scorer for the Georgia national rugby union team. He has also represented the Georgia national rugby league team and Georgia national rugby sevens team. Domestic career Kvirikashvili was born 27 December 1983, Tbilisi, Georgian SSR, Soviet Union. He left Georgia in 2006 for Pro D2 side Pau, and has since moved on to three other French clubs in F√©d√©rale 1 in Massy, Figeac and most recently Saint- Junien where he joined after the 2011 World Cup and currently plays. He has not spent more than two seasons at one club during his stay in France. International career Kvirikashvili made his Georgia debut as a teenager in 2003 against Portugal, and made the squad for Georgia's first ever appearance in a World Cup later that year, playing in all four of Georgia's matches from the bench. However he failed to establish himself in the Georgian side over the next couple of years, with Irakli Abuseridze and Bidzina Samkharadze both ahead of him for selection in the scrum half position. But in 2007 he switched to fly half and in his first start for his country in the position Georgia beat Romania away in Bucharest, he has remained a regular member of the Georgian side ever since. He was an important player in Georgia's 2007 World Cup campaign, starting all four matches and he showed good form against Ireland as Georgia narrowly lost 14‚Äì10 and was named man of the match in Georgia's first ever World Cup win against Namibia. After the 2007 World Cup Kvirikashvili was moved to full back to accommodate a new fly half Lasha Malaghuradze. In 2010 he broke a record he previously shared with Paliko Jimsheladze for most points scored for Georgia in a match, with 32 points in Georgia's 77‚Äì3 thrashing of Germany. Later that year he also kicked a last minute conversion for Georgia to defeat the USA 19‚Äì17 in Tbilisi. After Malaghuradze suffered an injury and then a loss of form, Kvirikashvili returned to the first choice fly half position in 2011 helping Georgia to an undefeated season in the European Nations Cup. However his fortunes were more mixed during the World Cup later that year as he failed to replicate the good form he showed in the 2007 tournament. Notably against England, Georgia were competing well but Kvirikashvili failed to capitalise on England's indiscipline and the Georgian forwards hard work and missed five penalties which would have put Georgia in a very competitive position in the match. He recovered to a better performance scoring 17 points in the win against Romania in the next match, but was dropped for the final match with Argentina. Kvirikashvili returned to the starting position in 2012 though and started every game for Georgia that year, and with some better kicking performances he broke the Georgian record for most points scored in a calendar year. =National records= Kvirikashvili is Georgia's all-time leading points scorer, overtaking Pavle Jimsheladze's previous record during the 46‚Äì0 thrashing of Russia in 2012 on his 60th cap. He also holds the record for most points scored in a match for Georgia with 32 against Germany in 2010. In 2012 he broke the Georgian record previously held by Pavle Jimsheladze for most points in a calendar year with 91 in 8 matches. Road accident In July 2016, Kvirikashvili was involved in a car accident on the Kutaisi-Samtredia highway, while travelling with fellow rugby player Giorgi Lominadze and their respective wives. Lominadze and his wife survived, but Merab's wife and mother of their four children died in hospital, as did three passengers travelling in another vehicle involved in the accident.

The conflict has largely been ethnic-based, with several ethnic armed groups fighting Myanmar's armed forces, the Tatmadaw, for self-determination. Despite numerous ceasefires and the creation of autonomous self-administered zones in 2008, many groups continue to call for independence, increased autonomy, or the federalisation of the country. The conflict is also the world's longest ongoing civil war, having spanned more than seven decades.  Background  Before Myanmar (Burma) gained independence from the United Kingdom, several anti-colonial groups protested against British rule of the country. These groups became especially influential during World War II, when the Empire of Japan promised an \\"independent Burmese state\\" (though it would be de facto controlled by Japan as a puppet state) and appointed Ba Maw as its head of state. During this period, left-wing groups such as the Communist Party of Burma (also known as the Burma Communist Party) and armed ethnic groups began to emerge in opposition to both the British and Japanese. In 1947, the Panglong Agreement was reached between Aung San and ethnic leaders, in an attempt to quell hostilities; however, the agreement was not honoured by the post-independence government following Aung San's assassination, leading to further ethnic tensions. On 4 January 1948, Myanmar gained independence from the United Kingdom. The communists and ethnic minorities in the country were dissatisfied with the newly formed government, believing that they were being unfairly excluded from governing the country. Three months after independence, the communists began an armed insurgency against the government. Similarly, Karen insurgent groups began to fight for independence.Callahan, M., Making Enemies. War and State Building in Burma. United States of America: Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 118 ‚Äì 123 In the early 1960s, the government refused to adopt a federal system, to the dismay of insurgent groups such as the CPB, who proposed adopting the system during peace talks. By the early 1980s, politically motivated armed insurgencies had largely disappeared, while ethnic-based insurgencies continued.Callahan, M., Making Enemies. War and State Building in Burma. United States of America: Cornell University Press, 2003, p. 34 ‚Äì 36 Several insurgent groups have negotiated ceasefires and peace agreements with successive governments, which until political reforms between 2011 and 2015 had largely fallen apart.Licklider, R. (1995). The Consequences of Negotiated Settlements in Civil Wars, 1945‚Äì1993. The American Political Science Review, 89(3), 681. The Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was a landmark agreement signed between the government of Myanmar and eight insurgent groups on 15 October 2015; two other insurgent groups later joined on 13 February 2018.  Timeline  The conflict is generally divided into three parts: Insurgencies during the post-independence period under parliamentary rule (1948‚Äì1962), insurgencies during the post-1962 coup socialist government under the rule of General Ne Win and his Burma Socialist Programme Party (1962‚Äì1988), and insurgencies during the modern post Cold War era; first under the military administration of the State Peace and Development Council (1988‚Äì2011) and now under the newly elected civilian government. = Post-independence conflict (1948‚Äì1962) = Following independence from the United Kingdom, the two largest opposition groups in Burma (Myanmar) were the communists, led by the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) and the Karen nationalists, led by the Karen National Union's predecessor. The former had fought the British colonial government prior to independence; however, during the final days of the Japanese occupation of Burma in World War II, both groups helped the British against the Imperial Japanese Army. Initially there was calm during the transitional period after independence, but on 2 April 1948, the CPB fired the first shots of the conflict in Paukkongyi, Pegu Region (present-day Bago Region). During the post- independence period, the KNU favoured an independent state, administered by the Karen people. The proposed state would have encompassed the territories of Karen State and Karenni State (present-day Kayin State and Kayah State), in Lower Burma (Outer Myanmar). The KNU has since shifted their focus from full independence to regional autonomy, under a federal system with fair Karen representation in the government. = Post-coup conflict (1962‚Äì1988) = \\"They have gone back\\": Insurgents of the Communist Party of Burma walk back to their bases after failed peace talks. ( November 1963) After three successive parliamentary governments governed Myanmar, the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces), led by General Ne Win, enacted a coup d'√©tat in 1962, which ousted the parliamentary government and replaced it with a military junta. Accusations of severe human rights abuses and violations followed afterwards, and the cabinet of the parliamentary government and political leaders of ethnic minority groups were arrested and detained without trial. Around this period, other ethnic minority groups began forming larger rebel factions, such as the Kachin Independence Army, in response to the new government's refusal to adopt a federal government structure. In 1967, following China's initiation of the Cultural Revolution, violence broke out between local Bamars and overseas Chinese in Myanmar, leading to anti-Chinese riots in Rangoon (present-day Yangon) and other cities. The riots left many overseas Chinese dead, which allegedly prompted China to begin giving logistical aid to the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) in 1968. Both immediately after the coup and again in 1972, General Ne Win held peace talks with opposition forces, but both times they fell apart, partly due to General Ne Win's refusal to adopt a multi-party system. After negotiations failed, defectors from the Tatmadaw and ethnic insurgents walked back to their bases, with headlines across Myanmar famously reading \\"They have gone back\\" (). Private property was confiscated by the government, and the Burmese Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) was founded in 1974 to govern the country under a one-party system. Under General Ne Win's 26 year dictatorship, Myanmar became an isolated hermit kingdom and one of the least developed countries in the world. In 1988, nationwide student protests resulted in the BSPP and General Ne Win being ousted and replaced with a new military regime, the State Peace and Development Council. = 8888 Uprising = On 8 August 1988, students began demonstrating in Rangoon (Yangon) against General Ne Win's rule and the disastrous Burmese Way to Socialism system. The protests spread across the country, The uprising ended on 18 September 1988, after a military coup was enacted by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) and the BSPP government was overthrown. Authorities in Myanmar claimed that around 350 people were killed,Ottawa Citizen. 24 September 1988. pg. A.16Associated Press. Chicago Tribune. 26 September 1988 whilst anti- government groups claimed thousands died in the protests, with a high number of deaths attributed to the military.Ferrara (2003), pp. 313Wintle (2007) According to The Economist, over 3,000 people were killed in the public uprising. As a result of the uprising, the new government agreed to sign separate peace treaties with certain insurgent groups. Because the 1988 uprising was mostly politically motivated, ethnic insurgent groups did not receive much support from political movements in Myanmar. In the 1990s, the Tatmadaw severely weakened ethnic insurgent groups, destroying most of their bases and strongholds. = Post-Cold War conflict (1988‚Äìpresent) = In 2006, the Tatmadaw conducted a large military offensive against the Karen National Union (KNU) in Kayin State, which resulted in the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians. One estimate claimed that approximately half a million people were displaced due to fighting between government forces and the KNU, and the forcible relocation of villages by the government. In 2011, Tatmadaw launched a military offensive named Operation Perseverance () against insurgents in Shan State in 2011. During the offensive, the Tatmadaw captured territory from the National Democratic Alliance Army (NDAA) and the Shan State Army - North (SSA-N), with the latter being involved in most of the fighting. The operation was officially a response to the groups' rejections of the junta's \\"One Nation, One Army\\" policy; however, researchers have linked it to the military's interests in the jade trade. Government forces attacked the Kachin Independence Army's headquarters near the city of Laiza on 19 November 2014, killing at least 22 KIA insurgents, according to the government. Between February and May 2015, government forces launched a series of military operations in Kokang, in northern Shan State, after the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) attempted to retake territory it had lost in 2009. Insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) attacked Burmese border posts along the Bangladesh‚ÄìMyanmar border on 9 October 2016, killing nine border officers. Armed clashes continued and on 11 October 2016, four Tatmadaw soldiers were killed by insurgents with recently looted weapons. On 25 August 2017, ARSA launched a second large-scale attack against 24 police posts and the 552nd Light Infantry Battalion army base in northern Rakhine State. A total of 71 people were reportedly killed in the armed clashes.  Main fronts  = Kachin State = Cadets from the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) preparing for military drills at the group's headquarters in Laiza. The Kachin people are a major ethnic minority in Myanmar who mainly inhabit the mountainous northern regions of the Kachin Hills in Kachin State. Kachin regular soldiers previously formed a significant part of the Myanmar military; however, after General Ne Win's regime seized power in 1962, many Kachin soldiers defected from the military and reorganized with already active Kachin insurgents to form the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), under the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO). Religious tensions have also been a source of conflict, as Kachin people have historically been predominantly Christian, while the majority Bamar people have been predominantly Buddhist.Fuller, T. (4 April 2013). \\"Ethnic Rifts Strain Myanmar as It Moves Toward Democracy\\". The New York Times. In 2012 alone, fighting between the KIA and the government resulted in around 2,500 casualties (both civilian and military); 211 of whom were government soldiers. The violence resulted in the displacement of nearly 100,000 civilians and the complete or partial abandonment of 364 villages.KIA claims 211 Tatmadaw soldiers have died in two months of fighting in Hpakant, 10 October 2012, http://www.kachinnews.com/news/2418-kia-says-211-army- soldiers-die-in-two-month-fighting-in-hpakant.html 31 dead in new clashes with Kachin: Myanmar News, 5 May 2012, http://dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2012\\\\story_5-5-2012_pg14_7 Lanjouw, S., Mortimer, G., & Bamforth, V. (2000). Internal Displacement in Burma. Disasters, 24(3), 228‚Äì239. Ceasefire agreements have been signed between the KIA and the government several times; most notably a ceasefire signed in 1994, that lasted for 17 years until June 2011, when government forces attacked KIA positions along the Taping River, east of Bhamo, Kachin State. As a result of the ceasefire breakdown, Kachin State has faced waves of internal displacement, with over 90,000 internally displaced people spread across over 150 camps or camp-like settings as of April 2017. Many IDP camps are located in non-government controlled areas with severely restricted access. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC) estimates that in April and May 2018, over 14,000 people were displaced from fighting between the KIO/KIA and the Tatmadaw. = Kayah State = The largest insurgent group in Kayah State (formerly Karenni State) is the Karenni Army, whose goal for the past few decades has been to obtain independence and self-determination for the Karenni people.Karenni Army (KA) (Myanmar), GROUPS ‚Äì ASIA ‚Äì ACTIVE, Jane's World Insurgency and Terrorism, 13 March 2012 The group has claimed that their grievances towards the government include: the (government's) exploitation and rapid depletion of the natural resources in the region, the forced sale of farmer's agricultural products for low prices, extortion and corruption within local authorities, forced labour, forced relocation of whole villages and farms, destruction of houses, planting of mines in civilian areas, torture, rape, extrajudicial killings, burning of villages, expropriation of food supplies and livestock, arrests without charge and exploitation of the poor. The Karenni Army is currently led by General Bee Htoo, and consists of roughly between 500 and 1,500 soldiers. = Kayin State = IDPs in Hpapun District, Kayin State. The Karen people of Kayin State (formerly Karen State) in eastern Myanmar are the third largest ethnic group in Myanmar, consisting of roughly 7% of the country's total population. Karen insurgent groups have fought for independence and self-determination since 1949. In 1949, the commander-in-chief of the Tatmadaw General Smith Dun, an ethnic Karen, was fired because of the rise of Karen opposition groups, which furthered ethnic tensions. He was replaced by Ne Win, a Bamar nationalist who would go on to become the dictator of Myanmar. The government of Myanmar has been accused of using \\"scorched earth\\" tactics against Karen civilians in the past, including (but not limited to) burning down entire villages, planting land mines, using civilians as slave labour, using civilians as minesweepers and the rape and murder of Karen women.Phan, Zoya and Damien Lewis. Undaunted: My Struggle for Freedom and Survival in Burma. New York: Free Press, 2010. According to a report by legal firm DLA Piper, whose report was presented to the United Nations Security Council, these tactics against the Karen can be identified as ethnic cleansing. The government had however, denied these claims. The initial aim of the largest Karen opposition group, the Karen National Union (KNU), and its armed wing, the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA), was to obtain independence for the Karen people. However, since 1976 they have instead called for a federal union with fair Karen representation and the self- determination of the Karen people. Nearly all of their demands and requests have been ignored or denied by successive governments, a contributing factor to several failed peace talks. In 1995, the main headquarters and operating bases of the KNU had mostly been destroyed or captured by the government, forcing the KNLA (the armed wing of the KNU) to instead operate in the jungles of Kayin State. Up until that year, the Thai government had been supporting insurgents across its border, but soon stopped its support due to a new major economic deal with Myanmar. The KNU signed the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) with the government of Myanmar on 15 October 2015, along with seven other insurgent groups. However, in March 2018, the government of Myanmar violated the agreement by sending 400 Tatmadaw soldiers into KNU-held territory to build a road connecting two military bases. Armed clashes erupted between the KNU and the Myanmar Army in the Ler Mu Plaw area of Hpapun District, resulting in the displacement of 2,000 people. On 17 May 2018, the Tatmadaw agreed to \\"temporarily postpone\\" their road project and to withdraw troops from the area. = Rakhine State = A Rohingya mujahid surrenders his weapon to Brigadier-General Aung Gyi, 4 July 1961. Insurgent groups of the Rakhine (formerly Arakanese), Chin, and Rohingya ethnic minorities have fought against the government for self-determination in Rakhine State since the early 1950s. Ethnic Rakhine insurgent groups, such as the Arakan Army and Arakan Liberation Army (ALA), continue to have hostilities towards the government, though major violence has been rare since political reforms and peace talks. The Arakan Army, founded in 2009, is currently the largest insurgent group in Rakhine State, with around 7,000 fighters. Rohingya insurgents have been fighting local government forces and other insurgent groups in northern Rakhine State since 1948, with ongoing religious violence between the predominantly Muslim Rohingyas and Buddhist Rakhines fueling the conflict. The legal and political rights of the Rohingya people have been an underlying issue in the conflict, with spontaneous bouts of violence such as the 2012 Rakhine State riots and 2013 Myanmar anti-Muslim riots periodically occurring as a result. Despite making up a majority of the population in the three northern townships of Rakhine State, Rohingyas are often targets of religiously motivated attacks. Because the government does not recognise the Rohingya people as an official ethnic group in Myanmar, Rohingyas cannot apply for citizenship and few laws exist to protect their rights. On 9 October 2016, unidentified insurgents attacked three Burmese border posts along Myanmar's border with Bangladesh, starting a new armed conflict in northern Rakhine State. According to government officials in the border town of Maungdaw, the attackers looted several dozen firearms and ammunition from the border posts, and brandished knives and homemade slingshots that fired metal bolts. The attacks left nine border officers and \\"several insurgents\\" dead. On 11 October 2016, four Tatmadaw soldiers were killed on the third day of fighting. A newly emerged insurgent group, the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), claimed responsibility a week later. Members of the Myanmar Police Force patrolling in Maungdaw in September 2017. During the early hours of 25 August 2017, ARSA insurgents launched coordinated attacks on 24 police posts and the 552nd Light Infantry Battalion army base, killing a dozen people. In response, the Tatmadaw launched \\"clearance operations\\" in northern Rakhine State, which critics argued targeted Rohingya civilians rather than insurgents.\\"Myanmar accused of laying mines after refugee injuries,\\" 12 September 2017, Chicago Tribune retrieved 12 September 2017. Quote \\"Accounts from refugees show the military is also targeting civilians with shootings and wholesale burning of Rohingya villages in an apparent attempt to purge Rakhine state of Muslims.\\"\\"Hundreds dead in Myanmar as the Rohingya crisis explodes again.\\" 10 September 2017, The Washington Post in Chicago Tribune retrieved 12 September 2017 Following the violence, 200,000 civilians remained trapped in the region without adequate access to markets, livelihoods, services and medical care. On 4 January 2019, around 300 Arakan Army insurgents launched pre-dawn attacks on four border police outposts‚ÄîKyaung Taung, Nga Myin Taw, Ka Htee La and Kone Myint‚Äîin northern Buthidaung Township. Thirteen members of the Border Guard Police (BGP) were killed and nine others were injured, whilst 40 firearms and more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition were looted. The Arakan Army later stated that it had captured nine BGP personnel and five civilians, and that three of its fighters were also killed in the attacks. Following the attacks, the Office of the President of Myanmar held a high-level meeting on national security in the capital Naypyidaw on 7 January 2019, and instructed the Defense Ministry to increase troop deployments in the areas that were attacked and to use aircraft if necessary. Subsequent clashes between the Myanmar Army and the Arakan Army were reported in Maungdaw, Buthidaung, Kyauktaw, Rathedaung and Ponnagyun Townships, forcing out over 5,000 civilians from their homes, hundreds of whom (mostly Rakhine and Khami) have fled across the border into Bangladesh. Civilian casualties, arbitrary beatings and detentions of ethnic Rakhines, forced seizures of property, and blockage of food aid and medical relief by the Tatmadaw have also been reported. = Shan State = UWSA troops standing at attention during a military ceremony. The Shan people are the largest ethnic group in Shan State and the second largest in Myanmar. In 1947, the Panglong Agreement was negotiated between Aung San, a prominent founding father of Myanmar, and Shan leaders, which would have given the Shan the option to split from Myanmar a decade after independence if they were unsatisfied with the central government. This was, however, not honoured by the post-independence government following Aung San's assassination. During the Tatmadaw's heavy militarisation of the state in the late 1940s and early 1950s, locals accused them of mistreating, torturing, robbing, raping, unlawfully arresting and massacring villagers. As a result, on 21 May 1958, an armed resistance movement, led by Sao Noi and Saw Yanna, was started in Shan State. One the largest Shan insurgent groups in Myanmar is the Shan State Army - South (SSA-S), which has around 6,000 to 8,000 soldiers, and was led by Yawd Serk until his resignation on 2 February 2014. The SSA-S maintains bases along the Myanmar‚ÄìThailand border, and signed a ceasefire agreement with the government on 2 December 2011. The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) is a Kokang insurgent group active in the Kokang Self-Administered Zone in northern Shan State. The group signed a ceasefire agreement with the government in 1989, the same year it was founded, which lasted for two decades until 2009, when violence erupted between the group and government forces. Violence again erupted between the MNDAA and government forces in 2015 and 2017. In late November 2016, the Northern Alliance‚Äîwhich consists of four insurgent groups, the Arakan Army (AA), the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA) and the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA)‚Äîattacked towns and border posts along the China‚ÄìMyanmar border in Muse Township, northern Shan State. The insurgents captured the town of Mong Ko on 25 November 2016 and maintained control of it until they withdrew from the town on 4 December 2016 to avoid civilian casualties from airstrikes by the Myanmar Air Force. On 15 August 2019, Northern Alliance insurgents attacked a military college in Nawnghkio Township, killing 15. Further clashes occurred in the following days, with Myanmar's military warning there could be a full-scale war if the Northern Alliance did not halt their attacks.  Political factors  Prior to independence, Aung San, considered a founding father of Myanmar, had convinced local Shan leaders to join him in his pursuit for independence, and with them, negotiated the Panglong Agreement in 1947. The agreement guaranteed the right to self- determination, political representation in the post-independence government and economic equality amongst the various ethnic groups. It also gave the Chin, Kachin and Shan people the option to separate from Myanmar after a decade if their states' leaders were unhappy with the central government. However, after Aung San's assassination, this was not honoured by the government, and has been one of the causes of insurgencies in those states. Whilst some groups continue to fight for full independence and for the right for self-determination of their people, groups such as the Chin National Front (CNF) and the Karen National Union (KNU) have since fought instead for regional autonomy and a federal system of government in Myanmar. During the 8888 Uprising, Aung San Suu Kyi emerged as a national symbol for democracy, after leading the country's largest opposition party, the National League for Democracy (NLD). The military junta arranged a general election in 1990 and the NLD won a majority of the vote. However, the military junta refused to recognise the results and instead placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest for 15 years. In 2007, hundreds of thousands of monks protested against the military junta's rule, and called for free elections, minority rights and the release of political prisoners in an event now known as the Saffron Revolution. The protest originally began in response to the government's removal of price subsidies for compressed natural gas. The government introduced a new constitution in 2011 and instigated a period of political reforms, with thousands of political prisoners being released, including Aung San Suu Kyi. In November 2014, the NLD attempted to make amendments to the constitution, in response to a clause that made Aung San Suu Kyi ineligible to become President of Myanmar if her party won an election. These amendments however, were rejected.Landler, M. (14 November 2014). Obama and Aung San Suu Kyi Meet Again, With Battle Scars. Retrieved 24 November 2014, from https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/world/asia/obama-aung-san-suu-kyi- myanmar.html?_r=0 Since the end of political reforms in 2015, the government has hosted a number of peace conferences in hopes of ending the conflict. However, these efforts have been criticised for not addressing the main proposals made by ceasefire groups, and for failing to reduce tensions between the government and the country's largest insurgent groups. Critics of the government have argued that the current constitution of Myanmar grants the military too much power, and is preventing the country from achieving peace and democratic reforms. A number of politicians and activists have been killed for voicing their opposition to the military's role in the government, such as constitutional lawyer Ko Ni, who was assassinated after he called for political reforms to reduce the military's influence.  Human rights violations  The government of Myanmar has been accused of using \\"scorched earth\\" tactics against civilians, most notably in Kayin State. The accusations included burning down entire villages, planting landmines, using civilians as slave labour, using civilians as minesweepers and the rape and murder of Karen women. According to a report by legal firm DLA Piper, whose report was presented to the United Nations Security Council, these tactics against the Karen have been identified as ethnic cleansing. Both sides have been accused of using landmines, which have caused hundreds of accidental civilian injuries and deaths. The Karen National Union (KNU) has been accused of planting landmines in rural areas, most of which have not been disarmed. The KNU claims that its use of landmines is vital for repelling government forces, because it \\"discourages them from attacking civilians\\". However, the majority of those who fall victim to landmines which are planted by the KNU are local villagers, not government soldiers. Victims of landmines must travel to the Myanmar‚ÄìThailand border to seek treatment, as local hospitals and facilities lack proper equipment and funding. Both sides have also been accused of using thousands of child soldiers, despite the fact that the government of Myanmar and seven insurgent groups signed an agreement with UNICEF in 2012, promising not to exploit children for military and political gains. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has accused both sides of continuing to use child soldiers in violation of the agreement. According to the ILO, the Tatmadaw has discharged hundreds of child soldiers since 2012; however, the ILO also estimated that at least 340 child soldiers had been recruited by the Tatmadaw between 2013 and 2014. Meanwhile, insurgent groups such as the MNDAA, SSA-S, and TNLA have reportedly press-ganged minors into their armies. One of the most notable cases in which child soldiers were used in Myanmar was that of twins Johnny and Luther Htoo, the leaders of God's Army, a former rebel faction. When God's Army was formed in 1997, the pair were just ten-years-old.  Refugee and internal displacement crisis  Mae La Camp in Tak, Thailand, one of the largest of nine UNHCR camps in Thailand where over 700,000 refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons have fled. Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh, home to nearly 550,000 Rohingya refugees who live in makeshift shelters. The conflict has resulted in a large number of both civilian deaths and refugees, with many refugees fleeing to neighbouring countries such as Thailand, China, India, and Bangladesh. The persecution of Burmese Indians and other ethnic minorities after the 1962 coup led to the expulsion of nearly 300,000 people. The UN estimated that between 1996 and 2006, around 1 million people were internally displaced inside Myanmar, over 230,000 of whom remain displaced in the southeast of the country, and 128,000 refugees lived in temporary shelters on the Myanmar‚ÄìThailand border.Human Rights Council, Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Burma, Paulo Sergio Pinheiro, 12 February 2007 In August 2007, approximately 160,000 refugees fled to nine refugee camps along the Myanmar‚ÄìThailand border and the Thai border provinces of Chiang Mai and Ratchaburi. Approximately 62% of the refugee population consisted of displaced Karen people. Humanitarian organisations such as Doctors Without Borders have since sent workers and medical support to the refugees. Over the course of the conflict, government officials in Myanmar have been accused of forcefully removing civilians living in conflict areas and confiscating their property, in order to repurpose them for commercial, industrial, and military projects.Ethnic Nationalities of Burma.

H., chapter=Chapter 16, State Terrorism in Arakan, author=Islam, Syed Serajul Islam. Edward Elgar Publishing. 2007. p. 342. . The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre reports a total of 401,000 people internally displaced in Myanmar as of 2018, owing both to man-made and natural disasters as well as conflict and violence. This figure includes IDPs across the country, with 131,000 in Rakhine State, 97,000 in Kachin State, 50,000 in Kayin State, 40,000 in Tanintharyi Region, 27,000 in Karenni State, 22,000 in Bago Region, 18,000 in Mon State, 15,000 in Shan State and 1,300 in Chin State. Of these total displacements, IDMC estimates that approximately 42,000 people were newly displaced in 2018 by conflict and violence. Compared to 2017, the rate of new displacements was lower in Rakhine State but higher in Kachin State and northern Shan State, which together saw approximately 36,000 people displaced. The Global Camp Coordination and Camp Management Cluster (CCCM) estimated in 2019 that at least 941,000 people in Myanmar were in need of humanitarian assistance, with over 128,000 people living in IDP camps in Rakhine State and over 105,000 people displaced in Kachin State and northern Shan State. While many displacements last only for the duration of active fighting, protracted displacement is evidenced by camps in Kachin State, Rakhine State, and Shan State. Living situations in these camps are often overcrowded with inadequate shelter, sanitation, healthcare, food, and education. In total, approximately 35 percent of IDPs in Myanmar are estimated to live in non-government controlled areas that have limited if not wholly restricted access as of November 2019, complicating relief efforts both for international and local organizations.  Ceasefire attempts  Under the new constitutional reforms in 2011, state level and union level ceasefire agreements were made with several insurgent groups. 14 out of 17 of the largest rebel factions signed a ceasefire agreement with the new reformed government. According to the Myanmar Peace Monitoring group, clashes between the Kachin Independence Organisation (KIO), its allies, and the government, have displaced hundreds of thousands of people, and created another severe humanitarian crisis in Kachin and northern Shan State. All of the 14 signatories wanted negotiations in accordance with the Panglong Agreement of 1947, which granted self-determination, a federal system of government (meaning regional autonomy), religious freedom and ethnic minority rights. However, the new constitution, only had a few clauses dedicated to minority rights, and therefore, the government discussed with rebel factions using the new constitution for reference, rather than the Panglong Agreement. There was no inclusive plan or body that represented all the factions, and as a result, in resent, the KNU backed out of the conference and complained the lack of independence for each party within the ethnic bloc.Nai, A. (3 September 2014). Democratic Voice of Burma: UNFC opens 2 top positions for KNU. Retrieved 10 November 2014. However, most of the negotiations between the State Peace Deal Commission and rebel factions were formal and peaceful. On 31 March 2015, a draft of the Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement (NCA) was finalised between representatives from 15 different insurgent groups (all part of the Nationwide Ceasefire Coordination Team or NCCT) and the government of Myanmar. However, only eight of the 15 insurgent groups signed the final agreement on 15 October 2015. The signing was witnessed by observers and delegates from the United Nations, the United Kingdom, Norway, Japan and the United States. The Union Peace Conference - 21st Century Panglong was held from 31 August to 4 September 2016 with several different organisations as representatives, in an attempt to mediate between the government and different insurgent groups. Talks ended without any agreement being reached. The name of the conference was a reference to the original Panglong Conference held during British rule in 1947, which was negotiated between Aung San and ethnic leaders.  International responses  Since 1991, the UN General Assembly has adopted twenty-five different resolutions regarding Myanmar's government, condemning previous military juntas for their systematic violations of human rights and lack of political freedom. In 2009 they urged the then ruling junta to take urgent measures to end violations of international human rights and humanitarian laws in the country.\\"UN General Assembly Resolution: Time for Concrete Action\\" (Press release). International Federation for Human Rights. 20 November 2009. Retrieved 4 January 2010. The request was mostly honoured during political reforms that begun in 2011 and ended in 2015. Reports of human rights abuses committed by the military and local paramilitaries prompted the UN Human Rights Council to launch an independent international fact-finding mission in March 2017, with which Myanmar's government failed to cooperate. The mission's report (A/HRC/39/64) released in September 2018 highlighted \\"clear patterns\\" of serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law in Kachin State, Rakhine State, and Shan State since 2011. The Tatmadaw are accused of deliberate and systematic targeting of civilians, sexual violence, discriminatory rhetoric against minorities, and impunity for its soldiers. Eyewitness testimony alleged that in Rakhine State, \\"clearance operations\\" by the Tatmadaw amounted to planned and deliberate mass killings in at least 54 locations. Hundreds and perhaps thousands of Rohingya women and girls were reported to have been raped, including in mass gang rapes, and at least 392 Rohingya villages were burned to the ground. The report also highlighted the conviction of Wa Lone and Kyaw Soe Oo, two Reuters reporters who had exposed the military's extrajudicial killing of ten Rohingya men and were subsequently imprisoned; the journalists have since been released and awarded a 2019 Pulitzer Prize for their reporting. In addition to violence against Rohingya communities, the report noted Tatamadaw abuses against ethnic Rakhine, including forced labor, sexual violence, forced evictions, and killings. It also highlighted abuses committed by insurgent groups in Kachin State, Rakhine State, and Shan State, including forced taxation, destruction of property, rape, and killings. The mission further documented similar patterns of human rights violations in Kachin and Shan States, which witnessed a drastic increase in fighting between the military and ethnic insurgent groups in the years preceding the report. The alleged abuses perpetrated include the widespread looting and destruction of homes, unlawful killings, forced labor, sexual violence, and enforced disappearances. The mission called for an investigation and the prosecution of military leaders, in particular commander-in-chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. On 11 November 2019 The Gambia filed a lawsuit in the International Court of Justice against Myanmar; State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi defended Myanmar's military generals against genocide accusations in public hearings in December 2019.  Foreign support  = China = The People's Republic of China has long been accused of having a multifaceted role in the conflict, given its close relations with both the Myanmar government and insurgent groups active along the China‚ÄìMyanmar border. China allegedly gave logistical aid to the Communist Party of Burma (CPB) during the communist insurgency in Myanmar, in support of the party's Maoist ideology. After the CPB's armed wing agreed to disarm in 1988, China was accused by Myanmar of continuing to support insurgent groups operating along its border, such as the United Wa State Army and Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, the latter enjoying closer ties to China due to a common Han Chinese ethnic background. In 2016, China pledged to support Myanmar's peace process by encouraging China-friendly insurgent groups to attend peace talks with the Burmese government and by sending more soldiers to secure its border with Myanmar. China also offered $3 million USD to fund the negotiations. However, the Burmese government has expressed suspicion over China's involvement in the peace process, due to China's alleged links to the Northern Alliance and the United Wa State Army. In a July 2020 interview, Myanmar's commander-in-chief Min Aung Hlaing claimed that \\"strong forces\\" were backing insurgent groups in the country, and asked for assistance from the international community to end the insurgency. The \\"strong forces\\" comment has been interpreted by critics of China as a reference to the Chinese government. = India = India and Myanmar share a strategic military relationship due to the overlapping insurgency in northeast India. India has provided Myanmar's military with training, weapons, and tactical equipment. The two countries' armies have conducted joint operations against insurgents at their border since the 1990s. Myanmar has also taken an active role in finding and arresting insurgents that fled from northeast India; in May 2020 Myanmar handed over 22 insurgents, included several top commanders, to Indian authorities. Similarly, India has been the only country to forcefully repatriate Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar despite global outcry. = Pakistan = From 1948 to 1950, Pakistan sent aid to mujahideen in northern Arakan (present-day Rakhine State). In 1950, the Pakistani government warned their Burmese counterparts about their treatment of Muslims. In response, Burmese Prime Minister U Nu immediately sent a Muslim diplomat, Pe Khin, to negotiate a memorandum of understanding. Pakistan agreed to cease aid to the mujahideen and arrest members of the group. In 1954, mujahid leader Mir Kassem was arrested by Pakistani authorities, and many of his followers later surrendered to the Burmese government.U Nu, U Nu: Saturday's Son, (New Haven and London: Yale University Press) 1975, p. 272. The International Crisis Group reported on 14 December 2016 that in interviews with the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), its leaders claimed to have links to private donors in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. The ICG also released unconfirmed reports that Rohingya villagers had been \\"secretly trained\\" by Afghan and Pakistani fighters. In September 2017, Bangladeshi sources stated that the possibility of cooperation between Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and ARSA was \\"extremely high\\". = Thailand = Thailand had been a vocal supporter of various insurgent groups in Myanmar, condemning actions done by the then ruling military juntas and allowing weapons and ammunition to be smuggled through its border through lax enforcement. However, in 1995, the Thai government secured its border with Myanmar and stopped all logistical support going through Thailand after they signed a major economic deal with Myanmar. = United States = Starting in 1951, the CIA began aiding Kuomintang soldiers that fled to Myanmar from China following the advance of Chinese communist forces into Yunnan Province. This included Operation Paper, which involved supplying them with non-lethal aid via Thailand until 1953, when they airlifted 7,000 soldiers to Taiwan and ended the operation. = Vietnam = Vietnam has supported modernisation efforts by Myanmar's military, providing them with ammunition and military hardware. Burmese military officials have likewise toured Vietnam to receive military advice from their counterparts in the People's Army of Vietnam. = Foreign fighters = Dave Everett was a member of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment before leaving in 1986 and joining the Karen National Liberation Army (KNLA) as a mercenary. Everett fought alongside the KNLA under the alias \\"Steve\\" and trained insurgents, helping them improve their marksmanship and teaching them how to use claymore anti-personnel mines. In order to fund his time with the KNLA, Everett perpetrated several robberies in Australia with the help of accomplices and took piloting lessons so he could smuggle weapons into Myanmar. Everett returned to Australia a year later in 1987. Former members of the British green berets, French Foreign Legion, and Russian Spetsnaz have also been reported fighting alongside insurgents as recently as 2012.

The division was then sent to the Western Front, entering the line north of the Ailette River, where it remained until April 1918. It then fought in the Somme region until it was dissolved on September 19, 1918. Allied intelligence rated the division as third class.Histories of Two Hundred and Fifty-One Divisions of the German Army which Participated in the War (1914-1918), compiled from records of Intelligence section of the General Staff, American Expeditionary Forces, at General Headquarters, Chaumont, France 1919 (1920), pp. 595-597. Order of battle on formation The 108th Infantry Division was formed as a triangular division. The order of battle of the division on October 3, 1915, was as follows:Hermann Cron et al., Ruhmeshalle unserer alten Armee (Berlin, 1935). *5. Infanterie-Brigade **1.

The regular methods of voting in such bodies are a voice vote, a rising vote, and a show of hands. Additional forms of voting include a recorded vote and balloting. Regular methods = Voice vote = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised (RONR) states that a voice vote (viva voce) is the usual method of voting on any motion that does not require more than a majority vote for its adoption. It is considered the simplest and quickest of voting methods used by deliberative assemblies. The chair of the assembly will put the question to the assembly, asking first for those in favor of the motion to indicate so verbally (\\"aye\\" or \\"yes\\"), and then ask those opposed to the motion to indicate so verbally (\\"no\\"). The chair will then estimate which side had more members. = Rising vote = A simple rising vote (in which the number of members voting on each side rise to their feet) is used principally in cases in which the chair believes a voice vote has been taken with an inconclusive result, or upon a motion to divide the assembly. A rising vote is also often the normal method of voting on motions requiring a two-thirds vote for adoption. It can also be used as the first method of voting when only a majority vote is required if the chair believes in advance that a voice vote will be inconclusive. The chair can also order the rising vote to be counted. Robert's Rules Online: Art. VIII. Vote. = Show of hands = A show of hands is an alternate to voice voting, often used in small boards, committees or also informal gatherings, but also in larger assemblies. It is more precise than a voice vote but does not require members to rise from their seats. However, it does not count as a division of the assembly, and is not always as effective as a rising vote in causing a maximum number of members to vote who have not done so.  Recorded vote  A recorded vote is a vote in which the votes (for or against) of each member of the assembly are recorded (and often later published). RONR explains: Recorded votes may either be taken by actually calling the roll (a task typically ordered by the chair and performed by the secretary) or, in some assemblies, by electronic device. = Signed ballot = A signed ballot is sometimes used as a substitute for a roll call vote. It allows the members' votes to be recorded in the minutes without the chair having to call the names of each member individually. A motion to use a signed ballot is one of the motions relating to methods of voting and the polls.  Balloting  Balloting is a form of voting in which the secrecy of the member's choices is desired. Members mark their choices on pieces of paper (or electronic devices tailored for such a purpose) and deposit the paper into a ballot box. This procedure is typically the usual method in elections. Robert's Rules of Order states that if a candidate does not receive a majority vote, the balloting is repeated until a candidate obtains a majority vote. Exceptions to this rule must be stated in the organization's rules. Such exceptions may include preferential voting, cumulative voting, and runoffs. = Repeated balloting = Repeated balloting is done when no candidate achieves a majority vote. In this case, no candidates are involuntarily eliminated. Mason's Manual states, \\"In the absence of a special rule, a majority vote is necessary to elect officers and a plurality is not sufficient. A vote for the election of officers, when no candidate receives a majority vote, is of no effect, and the situation remains exactly as though no vote had been taken.\\" Demeter's Manual states, \\"The fact that a majority (or a plurality) of the votes are cast for an ineligible candidate does not entitle the candidate receiving the next highest number of votes to be declared elected. In such a case, the voters have failed to make a choice, and they proceed to vote again.\\" Repeated balloting allows a dark horse or compromise candidate, who received few votes in the first round, to become the candidate that opposing factions agree to settle on. Moreover, it can prevent a candidate who is opposed by the majority of the electorate from being elected, as might happen under plurality.(TSC) A disadvantage is that if no one drops out of the race, and the voters are unwilling to switch sides, balloting can theoretically go on forever. In the U.S. presidential election of 1800, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr were tied at 73 electoral votes each, and in accordance with the Constitution the election was determined via a contingent election in the House of Representatives, where it took six days of debate and 36 ballots to elect Jefferson as the winner. Between rounds of balloting, members can make motions to help the assembly complete the election within a reasonable time. For instance, the assembly may vote to drop the candidate having the lowest vote after each successive vote, or reopen nominations for the office in order to secure a candidate on whom the majority can agree. This can help break a deadlock. In the 1855-56 election for Speaker of the House, the chamber, which had been deadlocked for 129 ballots, adopted a plurality rule stating that, if after three more ballots no one garnered a majority of the votes, the person receiving the highest number of votes on the next ensuing ballot would be declared to have been chosen speaker. On the decisive 133rd ballot, Nathaniel P. Banks received the most votes, 103 votes out of 214, or five less than a majority, and was elected speaker. =Preferential voting= Preferential voting allows members to vote on more than one proposal or candidate at a time, and to rank the various options in order of preference. Robert's Rules of Order states that preferential voting \\"affords less freedom of choice than repeated balloting, because it denies voters the opportunity of basing their second or lesser choices on the results of earlier ballots, and because the candidate or proposition in last place is automatically eliminated and may thus be prevented from becoming a compromise choice.\\" In any case, preferential voting can be used only if the bylaws specifically authorize it. Elimination of the candidate with fewest votes is a feature of instant runoff voting, but not of all preferential voting methods. =Cumulative voting= Cumulative voting allows members to cast more than one vote for a candidate. Regarding this method of voting, RONR states, \\"A minority group, by coordinating its effort in voting for only one candidate who is a member of the group, may be able to secure the election of that candidate as a minority member of the board. However, this method of voting, which permits a member to cast multiple votes for a single candidate, must be viewed with reservation since it violates the fundamental principle of parliamentary law that each member is entitled to one and only one vote on a question\\". =Runoffs= A runoff is when a second round of voting is held where the lowest vote-receiving candidates or all but two candidates are eliminated after the first round. RONR states, \\"The nominee receiving the lowest number of votes is never removed from the ballot unless the bylaws so require, or unless he withdraws - which, in the absence of such a bylaw, he is not obligated to do. The nominee in lowest place may turn out to be a 'dark horse' on whom all factions may prefer to agree\\".  Motions relating to methods of voting and the polls  Motions relating to methods of voting and the polls are incidental motions used to obtain a vote on a question in some form other than by voice or by division of the assembly; or to close or reopen the polls. For instance, a motion can be made to vote by ballot. These motions generally cannot be used to specify alternative forms of voting such as cumulative voting or preferential voting. Those methods can only be done through a provision in the bylaws. Likewise, proxy voting is generally prohibited, except in situations in which membership is transferable, as in stock corporations and even then, only by authorization in the bylaws. Voting systems in legislatures Many legislative bodies use electronic voting systems for recorded votes. =Ancient Rome= In the various types of legislative assemblies (comitia) of the Roman Republic, the voting was preceded by a contio (public meeting at which issues or candidates were presented). After the presiding magistrate called an end to this, citizens were dispersed into roped-off areas and were called forth in groups across raised gangways. Initially, each voter gave his vote orally to an official who made a note of it on an official tablet, but later in the Republic, the secret ballot was introduced, and the voter recorded his vote with a stylus on a wax- covered boxwood tablet, then dropped the completed ballot in the sitella or urna (voting urn), sometimes also called cista.The Oxford Companion to Classical Civilization (eds. Simon Hornblower, Antony Spawforth, Esther Eidinow: Oxford University Press, 2014), p. 267. =United States= United States House of Representatives The U.S. House of Representatives taking a roll-call vote to elect its speaker for the 112th Congress, as broadcast by C-SPAN. In 1869, Thomas Edison filed for a patent on the first electric vote recorder, and demonstrated the system to the United States Congress.Jacob R. Straus, Electronic Voting System in the House of Representatives: History and Evolution, Congressional Research Service (Feb. 11, 2008). The first proposal for automated voting in Congress was made in 1886. Over the next 84 years, fifty bills and resolutions to establish an automatic, electrical, mechanical, or electronic voting system in Congress were introduced. The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 authorized electronic voting for the first time. Electronic voting was first used in the House on January 23, 1973, to record a quorum call. Under the system implemented in the 1970s, members of the House may vote at any one of a number of stations located throughout the chamber. Each member has a small plastic card, punched identically on either end. To cast a vote, the representative inserts the card into the station in any direction and presses one of three buttons: \\"Yea,\\" \\"Nay,\\" or \\"Present.\\" The representative's vote is then displayed in two summary panels above the press gallery seats and to the right and left of the speaker's dais. The panel shows the member's name and a light corresponding to how that member voted (green for yea, red for nay, and amber for present), keeps a running count of vote casts, and displays time remaining for a vote (most votes are held open for at least fifteen minutes). The system as used today is much the same as that used in the 1970s, although today, member's voting cards are magnetic stripe cards that contain identification information. Once a representative has voted, he or she may check the vote by reinserting the card and seeing which light is illuminated at the voting station. For the first ten minutes of a vote, a representative may also change his or her vote by reinserting the card to change the vote. If a representative wants to change his or her vote in the last five minutes of a fifteen-minute vote, the representative must use a teller card in the well of the House. A tally clerk then manually enters the vote into the electronic voting system. In 1977, the electronic voting system was updated to be compatible with the House's newly installed closed-circuit television system showing the House chamber. The updates enabled in-progress voting counts to be displayed on the closed-circuit TV system. In-progress vote counts are now also shown on C-SPAN. United States Senate The three means of voting in the Senate are voice, division, and \\"the yeas and nays\\" (recorded votes or roll-call votes).Walter J. Oleszek, Voting in the Senate: Forms and Requirements, Congressional Research Service (May 19, 2008). On a voice vote, the presiding officer first asks those in favor to say \\"aye,\\" and then opposed to say \\"no.\\" The presiding officer then announces who appeared to win the vote (\\"The ayes [noes] appear to have it.\\"). One variation of a voice vote is for the presiding officer to state: \\"Without objection the amendment [bill, resolution, motion, etc.] is agreed to [or not agreed to].\\" If any senator objects to the presiding officer's determination, a vote will occur by another method (usually a recorded vote). A division vote (taken by having each side stand) is rare in the Senate, but may be requested by any senator or ordered by the presiding officer if the outcome of the voice vote is doubtful. Like the voice vote, a division does not provide a record of how each senator voted. The chair announces the result of a division vote. As in a voice vote, any senator may ask for a recorded vote. The third method is a recorded vote (\\"the yeas and nays\\"), currently taken by a roll call. The clerk calls the roll of senators alphabetical by name, and each Senator individually responds. Following the call, the clerk then identifies those who voted in the affirmative and those in the negative. The time limit for roll-call votes is nominally fifteen minutes as set by unanimous consent at the start of a two- year Congress, but votes are sometimes held open for longer so that senators may arrive. Unlike the House, the Senate does not use electronic voting.Niels Lesniewski, Voting by Electronic Device ‚Äî in the Senate?, Roll Call (December 4, 2013). In December 2013, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid suggested that he would not be opposed to setting up an electronic system similar to that used in the House, but also stated that he didn't see any change occurring \\"in the near future.\\" Use of electronic system would make it possible for the Senate to vote more quickly during \\"vote-a-rama\\" sessions on amendments to budget resolutions. S. Res. 480, a Senate resolution passed in 1984, created a standing order of the Senate requiring that each senator vote from his or her assigned desk. The resolution was sponsored by Democratic Senator Jennings Randolph of West Virginia. However, the rule is widely ignored, and senators typically vote while milling about the Senate chamber. All senators do vote from their desks, however, when asked to do so by the Senate majority leader. This typically is done on particularly solemn or important votes. The Senate Historical Office maintains a list of occasions when senators voted from their desks: these included the passage of the Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act; the confirmation votes of Supreme Court justices; and votes on articles of impeachment.Sean Sullivan, All 100 Senators voted on the immigration bill from their desks. That's a rarer occurrence than you might think, Washington Post (June 28, 2013).Voting from Desk in the Senate Chamber, Senate Historical Office.Richard Cowan & Thomas Ferraro, Senate passes sweeping immigration legislation, Reuters (June 27, 2013). State legislatures The Wisconsin State Assembly chamber, with the electronic vote board on the wall. In 1917, the Wisconsin State Assembly became the first state legislative chamber to adopt an electronic voting system. Many state legislatures use electronic voting systems for recorded votes. The first state legislative chambers to install electronic voting systems were the Wisconsin State Assembly (1917), Texas House of Representatives (1919), and Virginia House of Delegates (1923).Roll Call Voting Machines and Practices, National Conference of State Legislatures. Electronic voting systems continued to spread, and by 1980, nearly half of legislatures used such a system. Today, almost two-thirds of the legislative bodies have installed electronic voting systems. About 40 percent of chambers have made updates to their system since 1990. Electronic voting systems typically have voting controls at the front desk and running vote total displays. The National Conference of State Legislatures has reported on various differences in state electronic voting-systems: *In more than half of chambers, the clerk or secretary opens and closes the roll-call system. In seventeen chambers, the presiding officer opens and closes the system; in five chambers, the reading clerk opens and closes the system, and in nine chambers, some other legislative staffer opens and closes the system. *In 36 chambers, electronic roll-call votes are not subject to change. In one-third of chambers, however, changes are allowed if requested at the time of the vote. Seventeen chambers allow a roll-call vote to be changed upon a member's request at a later time. *In 42 chambers, a running vote total is displayed to the chamber; running vote totals appear on the presiding officer's monitor in 62 chambers and on the clerk's monitor in 59. More sophisticated electronic voting systems are sometimes linked to other technology to assist the legislatures in their work: *In 48 chambers, the voting system is linked to journal production. *In 40 chambers, the voting system is linked with the calendar. *In 24 chambers, the system has a debate timer. *In ten chambers, the presiding officer has a monitor displaying which legislators wish to speak and the order of the requests. A minority of state legislative chambers do not use an electronic voting system. Fourteen chambers use a traditional manual roll-call system in which the clerk calls the roll orally, records each member's vote on paper, and then tallies the ayes and nays. Twelve chambers use a hybrid system in which the clerk orally calls the roll, but each member's vote is then entered into a system. =United Kingdom= Parliament of the United Kingdom The House of Lords votes on the Parliament Act 1911 In the Parliament of the United Kingdom (Westminster), at the close of debate, the presiding officer of the chamber‚Äîthe Speaker of the House of Commons or the Lord Speaker of the House of Lords‚Äî\\"puts the motion\\" by asking members to call out their votes, typically saying \\"As many as are of that opinion, say 'aye'\\". The supporters of the measure shout \\"aye\\". The Speaker then says, \\"Of the contrary, 'no'\\" and the opponents of the measure shout \\"no\\". The Speaker then makes a determination of which side has won (\\"I think the Ayes [or Noes] have it.\\").E. E. Reynolds, Ourselves and the Community (Cambridge University Press, 3d ed. 1950), pp. 125-26.Divisions, Parliament of the United Kingdom. If the result of the vote is unclear (or challenged by any member of the house), the Speaker will call for a division of the house. Once a division has been called, the order \\"Clear the Lobby\\" is given in the Commons, and \\"division bells\\" ring out throughout the Parliamentary Estate to alert members that a vote is to take place. Members then physically separate themselves into the division lobbies, the Aye lobby to the Speaker's right and the No lobby to the Speaker's left, respectively. As members pass through the lobbies, clerks record their names and they are counted by tellers. Members have eight minutes to vote before the doors to the division lobbies are locked. In the Commons, the tally is complete, the tellers approach the presiding officer and announce the tally, and then the Speaker or Lord Speaker announces the result. The House of Lords follows are similar procedure, though the words \\"aye\\" and \\"no\\" are replaced by \\"content\\" and \\"not content\\" and the order given before a division is \\"Clear the Bar\\". Proposals to adopt electronic voting in Parliament have been considered but rejected. Devolved assemblies Among the devolved assemblies, the Northern Ireland Assembly uses the Westminster mode of voting; members use \\"Aye\\" and \\"No\\" lobbies unless a unanimous voice vote is taken. By contrast, the Scottish Parliament (Holyrood) and National Assembly for Wales both use electronic voting systems.How does Holyrood's electronic voting system work?, BBC News (September 23, 2016). =European Parliament= In the European Parliament, decisions are usually made by show of hands. If the show of hands leads to a doubtful result, the vote is taken by standing and sitting. If this, too, leads to a doubtful result, the vote is taken by roll call. (A roll-call vote is also taken if any political group or any 21 members request). The president of the European Parliament may also decide to hold a vote using the Parliament's electronic voting system. Electronic voting systems are installed in each of the European Parliament's two locations: Strasbourg and Brussels.Michael Palmer, The European Parliament: What It Is, What It Does, How It Works (Pergamon: 1981), pp. 91, 94. If at least 20% of the Parliament requests it before voting begins, the vote will be taken by secret ballot. =Russian State Duma= In the Russian State Duma, relatively few roll call votes have been published that identify individual deputies' votes. The votes of individuals are recorded only if the voting is open and the electronic method is used. While not all votes are officially roll call votes, every time a deputy electronically votes a computer registers the individual deputy's vote.

Early life  Davidson attended the Severn School, a preparatory high school for the Naval Academy, graduating in 1976.  Career at Oracle  Davidson joined Oracle in 1988, as a product manager in Oracle's financial software business unit. = Security at Oracle = Davidson's involvement in computer security dates to 1993, when she took a position as product marketing manager in Oracle's secure systems business unit. She has served on the Defense Science Board and as a member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th Presidency. She has testified about cybersecurity before a number of committees in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the Senate Committee. Davidson has a BSME from the University of Virginia and an MBA from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. She has also served as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy Civil Engineer Corps, during which she was awarded the Navy Achievement Medal. = Criticism = In January 2005, Davidson was criticized by David Litchfield, who called on Oracle to replace Davidson, pointing to a series of delayed or ineffective security patches in Oracle's database server as evidence of \\"categorical failure\\". In August 2015, Davidson published a blog post criticizing engineers who use static analysis tools to find and report potential vulnerabilities in Oracle software. Articles about her post soon appeared on technology news sites, where comments were extremely critical of its content and tone. The post was subsequently removed. In December 2015, while Davidson was still Oracle's Chief Security Officer, Oracle agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that it deceived consumers about the security provided by updates to its Java Platform, Standard Edition software (Java SE). Under the terms of a proposed consent order, Oracle will be required to give consumers the ability to easily uninstall insecure, older versions of Java SE.
