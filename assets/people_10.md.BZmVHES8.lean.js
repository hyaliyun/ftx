His father was a wealthy farmer, merchant and the highest civil authority of the village. Thus, Raffi‚Äôs economic background and special status within the family eventually made it possible for him to acquire a privileged education, one in which he was exposed to the full spectrum of classical, Russian and Western European masterpieces of literature. His education began in the home of the village priest, Father Mser. There, in a small room adjacent to the barn, boys of all ages and levels of learning were taught under pressure of corporal punishment for failing in their lessons. In his novel called Kaytser (\\"Sparks\\"), Raffi gives a vivid description of these punishments and denounces them. At the age of 12 his father sent him to Tiflis [Tbilisi], at that time a major center of Armenian intellectual life, to continue his secondary education at a boarding school run by a distinguished Armenian teacher. Raffi was on the verge of beginning his studies at a Russian university when he had to return home to help his ailing father with the family business. This was the end of his formal education. He subsequently took teaching posts in Armenian language and history at the Armenian schools in Tabriz, Akoulis and Tiflis. Throughout his life, Raffi made many trips to the villages and provinces of Eastern and Western Armenia. Wherever he visited, he became aware of the daily misery experienced by the unarmed Armenian population, who lived in constant terror of the Turks and Kurds. Raffi, like other Armenian intellectuals, was convinced that it was not viable to continue living thus. He would thereafter seek to deeply transform Armenian society. In order to do so, it was necessary for him to make the people themselves aware of the tragic reality in which they lived. Raffi was a prolific writer. His works were published in the newspapers Mshak and Ardzakank. \\"The Fool\\", his most popular work, appeared first in serialized form in the pages of Mshak [Tiflis] between 26 February and 4 June 1880. It first appeared as a book the following year. \\"Mshak\\" (\\"The Tiller\\") was founded as a weekly in 1872 by Grigor Artsruni. It played an important role in awakening the Armenian people from the lethargy that had overcome the majority of them since the loss of Armenian independence at the end of the 14th century. Raffi‚Äôs patriotic writings were read by virtually all Armenian youth of the time and of subsequent generations. In his novels, Raffi depicted characters of national heroes and Armenian revolutionaries. In fact, there is a well-known Armenian phrase that goes: \\"there are no Armenian freedom fighters (Feddayines) that have not read Raffi\\". Tombstone of Raffi at the Armenian Pantheon of Tbilisi Raffi considered that teaching the population the Armenian language was a fundamental and vital measure, but he felt they were bereft of a secular literature attractive enough to help realize that goal.Tajkahayk (The Armenian Question) by Raffi, p. 4, Taderon Press (Gomidas Institute), London It was to fill that void that he set out from 1874 to 1888 to create a complete and varied body of fiction. It was through these works that generations of Armenians learned to read Armenian, became acquainted with their history, and acquired the critical standards by which they could assess their lives and society. From 1880‚Äì1888, Raffi lived at present day Chonkhadze Str. 3, in the Sololaki area of Tbilisi, Georgia. Raffi died in 1888 in Tiflis, and his funeral attracted an unprecedented crowd. He was buried in the Pantheon of Armenians at the Khodjivank cemetery in Tbilisi, where Hovhannes Tumanyan, Gabriel Sundukian, Ghazaros Aghayan and Grigor Artsruni were also buried. Raffi's widow Anna died in London in June 1920.The Times, 21 June 1920, p. 18. Presently, there is a school as well as a street named after Raffi in Yerevan, Armenia. His works have been translated into several languages.

In 411 BC, during the oligarchic coup, he supported the oligarchy and was one of the ten commissioners (probouloi) appointed to draw up a new constitution. Hagnon's first appearance in the historical records comes in 437/6 BC, when he led a group of Greek colonists to found a city at the mouth of the river Strymon. Two previous attempts to found an Athenian colony on this valuable location (the site was desirable both because of its strategic position on the trade routes between the Hellespont and mainland Greece and because it was the primary outlet for trade from the wealthy Strymon valley)\\"Amphipolis,\\" from The Oxford Classical Dictionary, Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, ed. had been defeated by hostile native populations, but Hagnon, leading a multinational force of settlers, defeated the Edonians who held the location and founded the city of Amphipolis on an island in the river.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 4.106 For a number of years, Hagnon was honored as the founder of Amphipolis, but in 422 BC, with Amphipolis allied to Sparta and at war with Athens, the Amphipolitans transferred that honor to the Spartan general Brasidas, who died fighting outside that city while preventing an Athenian attempt to recapture it.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 5.11 Hagnon held military command for Athens on several occasions, sharing in the command of the force that sailed against Samos in the Samian War of 440 BC and commanding a force that attempted to capture Potidaea in 430 BC. In 421 BC, he was one of the Athenian signers of the Peace of Nicias, the treaty, negotiated by an Athenian general with the same name as his father (no relation), that brought an end to the so-called Archidamian War, the first stage of the Peloponnesian War;Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 5.19 he also signed the alliance between Athens and Sparta that was concluded in that same year.Thucydides, The Peloponnesian War 5.24 In 411 BC, when revolutionary forces at Athens took advantage of the disorder in the wake of the Sicilian Expedition to overthrow the Athenian democracy and replace it with an oligarchy, Hagnon was a member of the government of 400 oligarchs that was established, and served as one of the ten commissioners charged with drafting a new constitution.

Origins The band was originally called J.S. & The Imperials and was led by singer Jim Snowdon and featured pianist Pat Riccio Jr, who was replaced in 1964 by Marty Fisher (born December 26, 1945, Vancouver, British Columbia). The other original members comprised guitarist Al Waugh, bass player Brian Sefchek, saxophone players Jerry Shymanski (aka Mann) and John Crone (born February 4, 1945, Toronto), and drummer Gordon MacBain (born August 5, 1947, Toronto). During the early part of 1965, the group underwent further changes in personnel, which saw Gene Martynec (born March 28, 1947, Germany) replace Waugh and Rick Haynes replace Sefchek. Band becomes Bobby Kris & The Imperials Around May 1965, the group changed name when Bobby Kris (real name: Bob Burrows), who was studying philosophy at the University of Toronto, joined as lead vocalist. (Originally the band had asked Jay Smith of The Majestics but he declined the offer). During August, Dave Konvalinka aka Dave Wayne (born July 4, 1944, Gimli, Manitoba) succeeded Haynes on bass and Rick Loth came in on saxophone to replace Crone who left to join The Majestics. Haynes later played with Gordon Lightfoot. One of the new line up's first shows was the Purple Candle Club, Wasaga Beach in Ontario on August 7, 1965. The group's debut single, a cover of Burt Bacharach and Hal David's \\"Walk On By\\" was released in November 1965 and reached No. 8 on Canada's RPM chart early the following year. The follow-up 45 was a Bob Dylan cover but was not as successful. The group also did an orange juice commercial, which was never released, around this time. In early 1966, the group opened for Wilson Pickett at Toronto's Masonic Temple (when Jimi Hendrix was his guitarist) and supported The Beach Boys in Port Arthur (now Thunder Bay). Working with the ballet In a surprising coupling, the band appeared at the O'Keefe Centre on April 13, 1966 with the Canadian National Ballet Company, playing in the lobby during the intermission. Bobby Kris & The Imperials were chosen as opening act for The Lovin' Spoonful at Toronto's Massey Hall on May 8, 1966. Shortly afterwards, Wayne Davis (born April 28, 1946 in Toronto) from The Just Us replaced Dave Wayne who left to join The Majestics. Loth and Shymanski also left at this point. Loth then later joined the Silhouettes led by Doug Reilly (Dr. Music). The new line-up continued to play extensively in the Toronto area, although no other singles appeared. They were one of 14 local groups to play at a 14-hour pop show at the Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto on September 24, 1966. The following month, former member Jerry Shymanski joined Eddie Spencer & The Power, which evolved into Grant Smith & The Power. Bobby Kris & The Imperials supported Sam the Sham & The Pharaohs at the Club Kingsway in Toronto on October 22, 1966 alongside The Ugly Ducklings and The Ardels. The group fragments In the spring of 1967, the band started to fragment. Martynec left to form Kensington Market in May and was replaced by former Majestics keyboard player Jimmy Oskirko. The new lineup started to experiment more and played regularly at the Concord Tavern where the band performed a cover of The Beatles' \\"A Day in the Life\\". This version of the group also opened for Jose Feliciano at Massey Hall. However, by September, it was all over. Fisher and MacBain left to join Bruce Cockburn's Flying Circus. Kris replaced Jimmy Livingston in Livingston's Journey in late October while Davis subsequently joined 3's a Crowd in December. Bobby Kris reformed the band Bobby Kris reformed the band in mid-1968 with MacBain, Oskirko, Davis and former Jon and Lee & The Checkmates guitarist Larry Leishman (born April 4, 1947, Dunfermline, Scotland). One of the reconstituted band's first dates was at the Night Owl on June 13‚Äì14, 1968. The new look group played for another year but after appearing at the Night Owl on June 19‚Äì21, 1969, the band finally imploded. Leishman subsequently played with Rhinoceros while MacBain joined Peter Quaife's post-Kinks band, Mapleoak in England.

Character's background Becky first arrived in Charnham in January 2000 along with her brother Darren, their mother Nikki, stepfather Andrew and step-siblings Luke and Sara. Becky and Darren's father Adrian soon made a reappearance in their lives after serving time for being an accessory to armed robbery and took up residence locally. Later that year, Adrian left Charnham incensed, after discovering Nikki's affair with Luke and took Becky and Darren to live with his parents in Tottenham. Becky was resistant and hated it there and later ran back home to the Warringtons. At Christmas, the secret was exposed which resulted in the Warrington family diminishing. Andrew soon left Nikki, Sara moved out and Becky and Darren had to adjust to Nikki and Luke being an item. In December 2001, Luke returned looking for Sara who had gone missing for several days. Sara was eventually found, but Luke stayed in the area and rekindled his relationship with Nikki. Becky and Luke later had a fling of their own, which ended badly after Becky contracted cystitis and Luke left town. Becky later had relationships with Lewis Davenport, Benji McHugh and Brendan Boulter. Over the next year or so, things would seem tough for Becky and the family but things fell into place once Nikki began a relationship with Roy Farmer and eventually married him. The family were all set to leave town for newer pastures in November 2003, but the dream was shattered when Roy was killed during a fire in his cybercafe (which had been started by Mike Shaw as a plot to frame Pete Callan for arson). Following Roy's funeral, Becky, Darren and Nikki left Charnham for a new start elsewhere.

The mobile operator A1 launched in Croatia in July 1999 and since then has introduced many products and services including prepaid telephony, MMS and international roaming. Until the A1 brand was introduced in Croatia, the company was known as Vipnet. In August 2011, A1 acquired B.net, the largest Croatian cable operator that offers fixed telephony, broadband Internet access and television services such as cable television and satellite television. This acquisition was the biggest takeover within the Croatian telecom market. A1 is the first and only operator that has made available, in all areas of Croatia, the complete 5-play service, which includes A1 TV, mobile and fixed telephony, as well as mobile and fixed Internet. In November 2012 the number of mobile network customers amounted slightly over 2 million, and the number of households using A1's fixed communication and TV services grew for 19.6 percent more compared to 2011. History (1999‚Äì2009) Granted the concession for the second GSM network in Croatia in September 1998, A1 started its commercial operations on July 1, 1999. Because of the profound impact it had on the Croatian telecommunications market, A1 is also known for having the best market entrance as a second GSM operator in Europe ever. In 1999, A1 was the first on the Croatian market to offer its customers Vipme prepaid, with no subscription fee and a year later A1 introduced the first mobile payment service in Croatia ‚Äì Vip parking, which was later used and introduced by other global operators. Also, in 2002, A1 was among the first to launch MMS roaming. As a part of Telekom Austria Group and because of TAG's partnership agreement with Vodafone, A1 was the first in Croatia to present a new business communications solution ‚Äì Vodafone Blackberry, in 2004. Later on, in 2006, A1 offered an alternative to fixed telephony line with the Vodafone Homebox to its private customers, small and medium enterprises and in February 2008 Vipnet introduced the first prepaid fixed line in Croatia‚Äì Vipme Homebox. A1 was the first in Croatia to introduce technologies such as GPRS, EDGE, UMTS and HSDPA. In March 2007 it was the first in Europe to demonstrate mobile Internet access via its HSDPA 7.2 network and in February 2009 was among the first in the world to successfully test the latest technology for mobile broadband ‚Äì HSPA+. At the end of 2008, A1 had 2.5 million customers, up 14.1% compared to end of 2007. Its market share is 42.2%, down from 43% share at the end of 2007. , it had 1.964 million customers. Recent years (2010‚Äì2013) In 2010 A1 introduced ADSL and in the same year presented Dual Carrier HSDPA technology. The same year A1 developed a range of services based on cloud computing such as Vip auto nadzor (Vip car surveillance), Vip nadzor radnog vremena (Vip business hours surveillance), Vip nadzor prodaje (Vip sales surveillance) and Vip nadzor brodova (Vip ship surveillance). With these services customers achieve significant savings, because they do not have to invest in expensive technology or have their own IT infrastructure. In March 2011, A1 was the first in Croatia to test LTE technology at 800 MHz for covering Croatia with the most advanced wireless broadband. In August 2011, A1 acquired B.net, the largest Croatian cable operator. Total value of this acquisition was EUR 93 million which represents the biggest takeover within the Croatian telecom market so far. At the beginning of 2012, A1 was the first on the market to offer combi packages for fixed and mobile services. In March 2012, A1 and Ericsson Nikola Tesla launched the first commercial LTE network in Croatia. Following the April 2012 and the introduction of a high quality digital television VipTV, in October 2012 A1 became the first and only operator that has made available, in all areas of Croatia, the complete 5-play service, which includes Vip TV, mobile and fixed telephony, as well as mobile and fixed Internet ‚Äì and all on one bill. Also, in May 2012 A1 was first to set a world record in data transmission on the fixed network with speeds of up to 4.3 Gbit/s which is 1000 times greater than the average in Croatian households. A1 finished the year 2012 presenting its new technological and business complex in ≈Ωitnjak. The complex was worth 50 million HRK, it is energy self-sufficient and also contains one of the largest data center in the region. Today A1 is still best known for its mobile network. It is a 900 MHz GSM, 2100 MHz 3G (WCDMA), 1800 and 2600 MHz 4G (LTE) network which supports GPRS, MMS, EDGE, UMTS, HSDPA and LTE technologies. A1 introduced a number of these technologies to the Croatian market first and remain a technological leader in the field. In 2013, A1 acquired 100 percent ownership of Digi satelitska televizija d.o.o. Digi TV Croatia is one of the providers of digital television services on the Croatian market, which began operating in November 2006, and provides exclusively satellite television service using Direct to Home (DTH) technology. By integrating Digi TV Croatia into A1, satellite television will become a standard part of the service offering under the A1 brand.Vipnet, \\"Vipnet acquired satellite television provider Digi TV\\", Vipnet References  External links  * Vodafone Telecommunications companies of Croatia Telecommunications companies established in 1999 Mobile phone companies of Croatia Croatian companies established in 1999 ","title":"A1 Hrvatska"},{"id":"4992148","text":"Mana mana may refer to: *Mana Mana, a Finnish rock group *Mah N√† Mah N√† (sometimes \\"Mana Mana\\" or \\"Mahna Mahna\\"), a popular song written by Piero Umiliani ","title":"Mana mana"},{"id":"4992169","text":"The Indian desert jird or Indian desert gerbil (Meriones hurrianae) is a species of jird found mainly in the Thar Desert in India. Jirds are closely related to gerbils. Distribution The Indian desert jird is found in southeastern Iran and Pakistan to northwestern India. In India they can be found in Rajasthan and Gujarat. Description Meriones hurrianae The Indian desert jird has a grey-brown coat with yellowish-grey belly. It is approximately long and has a tail long. The distinguishing characteristics include short ears, long black claws and orange incisors. Habitat Jirds inhabit desert and barren areas preferring firm soil. They are not to be found in pure sand dunes or rocky outcrops. Desert jird found at Desert National Park, Jaisalmer, Rajasthan Habits The jirds are gregarious and their burrows are seen close by. Each jird will have at least two or more entrances to his burrow complex. Often the entrance is in the shade of a tree or near the trunk of bushes. They feed on seeds, roots, nuts, grasses and insects. Difference between 'jirds' and 'gerbils' Jirds are closely related to gerbils but can be distinguished by the lack of long hind feet and the characteristic erect posture of a gerbil. The tail of a jird is generally shorter than the head and body. It also has much shorter ears. In addition, the Indian desert jird is diurnal, in comparison to the three common gerbil species found in India which are nocturnal.

It is distributed throughout most of continental Europe but is absent from Denmark and practically all European islands including Great Britain, Ireland, Azores, Balearic Islands, Channel Islands, Canary Islands, Crete, Cyprus, Iceland, etc. This is a rather variable species with a wingspan of 22‚Äì32 mm (not always particularly \\"large\\") with several subspecies having been described. As with most Pyrgus species it has dark brown wings with pale chequered margins and is rather difficult to identify specifically in the field but good views reveal clear, well-spaced white spotting on the forewing and much fainter markings on the hindwings. The most likely confusion species is the safflower skipper (P. carthami). P. alveus is on the wing from June to August with one or two generations produced each year.

The Russian text by the composer was based on Russian folk tales from the collection by Alexander Afanasyev. The full Russian name of the piece is ' (‚Äì The Fable of the Vixen, the Cock, the Cat and the Goat. A burlesque for the stage with singing and music). History In April 1915, Winnaretta Singer, Princesse Edmond de Polignac, commissioned Stravinsky to write a piece that could be played in her salon. She paid the composer 2,500 Swiss francs. The work was completed in Morges, Switzerland in 1916, and Stravinsky himself made a staging plan, trying to avoid any resemblance to conventional operatic staging . He created, rather, a new form of theatre in which the acrobatic dance is connected with singing, and the declamation comments on the musical action. However, the piece was never performed in the salon of the princess. It was not in fact staged until 1922. The premiere, a double bill with Mavra, was given on 18 May 1922 by the Ballets Russes at the Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôOp√©ra, Paris. Other sources indicate 2 June as the date of the premiere. Festival d'Aix en Provence : 1948‚Äì2008, and Conversations page 89 says \\"in June 1922\\" It was conducted by Ernest Ansermet with choreography by Bronislava Nijinska and decorations and costumes by Mikhail Larionov. Stravinsky remained pleased with Nijinska's \\"acrobatic Renard, which coincided with my ideas... Renard was also a real Russian satire. The animals saluted very like the Russian Army (Orwell would have liked this), and there was always an underlying significance to their movements.\\" In 1929, Sergei Diaghilev staged a revival with the Ballets Russes with choreographed by Michel Fokine. Stravinsky was not happy with the revival, saying, \\"[it] was ruined chiefly by some jugglers Diaghilev had borrowed from a circus.\\" Stravinsky regretted Chagall's refusal of a commission to do the sets.Conversations page 102 Synopsis This is a moralizing story, a farmyard fairy tale about Reynard the Fox, who deceives the Cock, the Cat and the Goat; but in the end they catch and punish him. The Cock is twice tricked and captured by the Fox, only to be rescued each time by the Cat and the Goat. After the Cock's second rescue, the Cat and the Goat strangle the Fox, and the three friends dance and sing. It also contains a slight irony relating to religion and the church ‚Äì to be invulnerable the Fox wears the black gown of the nun (nuns used the privilege of inviolability in Russia). As in his later ballet , Stravinsky employs here the singers as part of the orchestra, and the vocal parts are not identified with specific characters.

Score and music sample Stravinsky first developed here an original technique of composition that was almost unknown in the European classical tradition, though quite typical of folk music. The main features of this are the repetition of small, simple melodic phrases (called in Russian ), often in syncopated rhythm, with an irregular meter (changing the time signature almost in every bar); the multi-voiced texture is not a real polyphony, but rather a heterophony, representing monophony or a ‚Äúragged unison‚Äù, where the melody of one instrument is accompanied and embellished with the fragments of the same melody.

The major drawback of malonic ester synthesis is that the alkylation stage can also produce dialkylated structures. This makes separation of products difficult and yields lower.Malonic Ester Synthesis ‚Äì Alkylation of Enolates :Malonic ester synthesis Mechanism The carbons alpha to carbonyl groups can be deprotonated by a strong base. The carbanion formed can undergo nucleophilic substitution on the alkyl halide, to give the alkylated compound. On heating, the di-ester undergoes thermal decarboxylation, yielding an acetic acid substituted by the appropriate R group. Thus, the malonic ester can be thought of being equivalent to the ‚àíCH2COOH synthon. The esters chosen are usually the same as the base used, i.e. ethyl esters with sodium ethoxide.

It is a silvery-coloured herring-like fish, long. It is found in most of the Great Lakes and in Lake Nipigon, and inhabits underwater slopes. This fish is not to be confused with the extinct deepwater cisco (Coregonus johannae), a large fish that shared a common name with the bloater.  Description  The bloater is a small, silvery-coloured whitefish with a pink and purple iridescence. It has a greenish tinge above, and a whitish belly. It is very similar to the kiyi, from which it may be distinguished by its lighter upper lip and smaller eye. Its body is deepest at its middle, it has small and pale fins, and it has 40‚Äì47 long gill rakers. The discoverer of the bloater, P. R. Hoy, thought it to be \\"the most beautiful of the white fish\\". It reaches a maximum total length of and commonly is .  Distribution  The bloater is native to all of the Great Lakes (except Lake Erie) and in Lake Nipigon. Across its range it is in decline, and it is listed as Vulnerable to global extinction by the IUCN Red List. It was extirpated in Lake Ontario and is extirpated in Lake Nipigon, is uncommon in Lake Michigan and is in decline Lakes Superior and Huron. This decline is caused mostly by predation by the alewife, and also by sea lamprey predation and pollution. However, efforts to re-introduce the species in to Lake Ontario have been met with great success.New York State. Department of Environmental Conservation.

USFWS - Bloater Reintroduction Efforts (2012).  Taxonomy and etymology  The specific epithet of the bloater is given after Dr. P. R. Hoy of Racine, Wisconsin. Dr. Hoy collected the first specimens of this species in 1870 while dredging in Lake Michigan at least off Racine, at depths of 50 to 70 fathoms (90‚Äì130 m). Hoy did not describe the fish himself, but had ichthyologist James W. Milner name the species. Milner placed it in the genus Argyrosomus, now considered a junior synonym of Coregonus, the genus in which the bloater is now placed. The generic name Coregonus, given by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 tenth edition of Systema Natur√¶, is derived from Greek and means \\"angled eye\\", referring to the tilted pupil of whitefishes. It is closely related to the cisco or lake herring, Coregonus artedi, and the shortjaw cisco, both of which it is known to hybridise with. The common name of the bloater comes from the swollen appearance it has after being brought up from the deep waters it inhabits. The same name is given to certain type of smoked herring in Britain, which is swelled in its preparation. The bloater is one of the several taxa in the Coregonus artedi complex of freshwater whitefishes, which sometimes all are considered to belong to a single species.  Ecology and behaviour  Illustration from The Natural History of Useful Aquatic Animals The bloater is found at depths of . There it inhabits underwater slopes, and is tolerant of temperatures between 34.7 and 52.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 11.4 Celsius). When it is brought to the surface its gas bladder expands, giving it a swollen appearance. The bloater feeds mostly on animals living at the lake bottom (zoobenthos), but will sometimes eat small drifting animals, or zooplankton. The shrimp Mysis diluviana, and the amphipod Diporeia hoyi, also named after P. R. Hoy, are recorded as food items. The lake trout, various species of introduced salmon, and the burbot all are known to prey on the bloater. In the nineteenth century it was abundant, and was often caught by fishermen, among whom it was known as the \\"moon-eye\\". It was considered a good panfish, but too small to be marketable. Since most of the other \\"chubs\\" of the Great Lakes have become extinct, the average size of the bloater has increased, and it is caught and smoked in the United States. The bloater is ignored by sport fishermen, since it is small and found at great depths, and it has too small of a mouth to be used as bait.Wisconsin Sea Grant 2010 Spawning occurs all year round, but is usually in the winter or autumn. Spawning occurs at depths of . The amount of eggs produced by the female varies depending upon her size, and ranges between 3,230 and 18,768. Eggs incubate for 4 months, and bloaters are in length at hatching. Larval bloaters head to the cool bottom of lakes before becoming pelagic, and by their first summers they become bottom-dwellers. Larval bloaters have a high mortality until they become large enough to avoid predation by other bloaters and alewives. It is slow-growing, because of the scarcity of food in its habitat. The bloater's average length at maturity is , and maximum age reported from otoliths is 10 years.

It forms part of the ring-road of Bordeaux and carries the A630 autoroute. It was completed in 1967 and its main span is long. The eastern and western aspects of the bridge are dramatically different. To the east there is a ridge of land which allows the roadway to enter the bridge with little or no slope. By contrast, to the west there is an area of flat land, forming part of the Medoc, which means the roadway across the bridge slopes dramatically upwards in order to gain sufficient height to enter the bridge. History The first bridge for the city of Bordeaux, the stone bridge, built by order of Napoleon, was completed in 1822. By the Second Empire, the bridge was already considered insufficient to allow the city to develop normally. From 1891, the studies multiplied leading in 1909, to the choice of a Transporter bridge whose construction was entrusted to the Cail- Fives-Lille. The President of the Republic, Armand Falli√®res, laid the foundation stone on 19 September 1910. In 1914, only the pylons were built, but Great War interrupted the works and was not resumed as that type of works was now obsolete. The studies were resumed, and in 1939 the solution was finally found. The stone bridge would be demolished and replace it with a new, sufficiently wide bridge. This idea was confirmed by the ministerial decision of 3 December 1941. Circumstances did not allow the projects execution and the worst was thus avoided. In 1949, the state, the city of Bordeaux and the communities concerned recognised that it was wiser to create a new bridge, but the choice of its location posed a major difficulty. In the spring of 1953, it was decided, to increase the roadway of the stone bridge to four lanes, which could be done without notable modifications and at a low cost. The works were quickly completed in 1954. The same year, the mayor of Bordeaux, Jacques Chaban-Delmas, became Minister of Public Works and as of 13 August 1954, the decision was made in principle, to build a suspension bridge. Public Works Minister Robert Buron laid the foundation stone on 20 May 1960. Begun in 1961 the construction was spread over six years. The work was officially inaugurated on 6 May 1967, under the presidency of the Minister of Public Works of the time, Fran√ßois-Xavier Ortoli. Specifications The Pont d'Aquitaine's central span, 393.75 m, is the second largest French suspension bridge behind the Pont de Tancarville, remains a modest work. In 2008, it ranked 80th in the world of suspension bridges. However, it is extended on the left bank by a viaduct of 1014 m, which brings it to the 8th rank in terms of length of French bridges when all categories combined. Cross-section of the bridge.

Profile Modern residential housing in Pandacan In 2000, Pandacan had a total population of close to 82,194. The original residents of the district are Tagalog migrants from the province of Bulacan. When the district grew and progressed as a manufacturing center for Manila, several ethnic groups from other parts of the country migrated into the district after the Second World War. The district is bounded to the north and northeast by the Pasig River, the Estero de Pandacan to the west and south and the district of Santa Ana to the southeast. Socioeconomically, the majority of the residents of Pandacan range from lower- to upper-middle class. Original residents are gainfully employed as blue-collar workers in the nearby factories and oil depots, while those in the service sector are generally employed in nearby Makati, the country's central business district. Pandacan was originally established as the industrial center for the city of Manila during the turn of the 20th century. Oil depots which service more than half of the fuel requirement of the country were established along the banks of the Pasig River in the district. =Landmarks= The district is home to a few well-known historical figures, including Apolinario Mabini, one of the key figures in the Philippine fight for independence during the late 19th century against Spanish rule. The National Historical Commission of the Philippines has declared Mabini's former residence as a national historical shrine. Former First Lady Imelda Marcos claims Pandacan as her ancestral home in Manila. Since marrying former President Ferdinand Marcos in the 1960s, caretakers have been constantly maintaining her home. The house is Marcos' tie as a resident of Manila, despite her family's roots in Leyte province in the Visayas. =Schools= Public elementary schools serving the district includes Jacinto Zamora Elementary School, Bagong Diwa Elementary School (under construction), Beata Elementary School and Bagong Barangay Elementary School; the district has one public high school, the Carlos P. Garcia High School. Private education is provided by a Catholic school called St. Joseph's School ‚Äì Pandacan, located beside the Santo Ni√±o Parish along Jesus Street. In 1994, the ERDA Technical And Vocational Secondary School was built by Fr. Pierre Tritz, a Jesuit from France for the disadvantaged Filipino youth. =Churches= Four of the leading Christian religious dominations in the Philippines established their presence in the district. For Roman Catholics, there is the Santo Ni√±o Parish along Jesus Street. The Iglesia ni Cristo and the United Methodist Church both have a church along Quirino Avenue, and the Philippine Independent Church has a church (Parish of Sto. Ni√±o) at the corner of Central and Labores Streets. History Officially, Pandacan was established as a community in 1574 when Franciscan priests of the Roman Catholic Church established the first mission in the district. Pandacan was originally part of the parish of Sampaloc; it was later established as a separate parish in 1712. Pandacan was a farming community, producing small quantities of rice and sugar that were sold to the Spanish enclave in Intramuros. Aside from a few vegetable plots, the old Pandacan produced bricks and tiles, colored cotton laces but in limited quantities. The district also produced shoes and small boats. In the 19th century, Pandacan was described as a \\"Little Venice\\" or \\"Little Italy\\" for its numerous canals or estuaries leading to the Pasig River. Many would leisurely row through the estuaries in the late afternoons as described by Francisco Balagtas in his early writings. Pandacan was home to balladeers and a source of musicians in the early times. Late in the Spanish era and into the American regime, Pandacan was developed into becoming the first industrial estate in the Philippines. The first modern manufacturing company was built in Pandacan and was called the Compa√±ia General de Tabacos de Filipinas in 1882, a modern cigar-making plant. The first stone church in Pandacan was built in 1732 by Father Francisco del Rosario. The church would take 30 years to complete. The image of the Holy Child of Jesus or popularly known as Sto. Ni√±o was enshrined at the church and its feast is traditionally celebrated on the third Sunday of January. According to legend, the image of the Santo Ni√±o was recovered from a well near the church and some say the water from the well resulted in the miraculous healing of the infirm. The well has long been sealed due to pollutants but a shrine stands on what was once the well. The original church, completed in 1760, was twice destroyed by earthquakes. A modern church now stands on the ruins including a parish school which stands on what was the Catholic cemetery of the district. Pandacan was home to prominent Filipino artists of the 19th century, including Francisco Baltazar (also known as Balagtas) who authored Florante at Laura; musician Ladislao Bonus; Tagalog language theorist Lope K. Santos; and playwrights Miguel Masilungan and Pantaleon Lopez. By the turn of the 19th century, the American colonial government decreed Pandacan as the center for industrial activity and had oil companies build their storage and distribution facilities in the district. With the presence of several manufacturing facilities in the district, a modern housing facility was built to house the workers at the nearby oil depots. The housing project was called \\"Kapitan Tikong\\" (Captain Tikong) subdivision, named after a popular local leader. The housing facility was built on the southeastern banks of the Estero de Beata. In honor of Francisco Baltazar, the streets in the subdivision were named after the characters of Florante at Laura. Modernization =From industrial to commercial= The manufacturing facilities in Pandacan have long transferred to other locations outside of Manila. Only the major \\"Big Three\\" oil companies operate oil distribution depots in Pandacan: Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron's Caltex and San Miguel Energy Corp. majority-owned Petron Philippines. During the second term of Manila Mayor Joselito L. Atienza, Jr., he led an effort to convert Pandacan from an industrial classification into commercial, in an effort to have the oil depot removed from the district. Atienza and several city councilors were concerned that the oil depot served as a security, environment, and safety hazard to the densely populated Pandacan. Several fires have been attributed to the presence of the oil depot and terrorist attacks were a major concern. Difficulty in finding a reasonable relocation site for the depots, without disturbing the national distribution process of fuel, resulted in a compromise in place of the eviction. However, a gradual phase out of large oil tanks that lined residential areas has been completed and a Pandacan Linear Park was built along the oil depot and residential units up to the banks of the Pasig River. =Beautification programs= Plaza Balagtas monument to playwright Francisco Balagtas Atienza spearheaded a beautification program and spruced up parks and recreational facilities. This included the Plaza Balagtas that sits atop the Estero de Beata in 2003 and the Ladislao Bonus Park in 2006. In September 2006, as part of Atienza's sidewalk redevelopment and street lighting program, the main highway from the corner of Jesus Street and Quirino Avenue at the foot of Nagtahan Bridge southwards into Palumpong Street and the whole of Laura Street up to the foot of the Padre Zamora Bridge was renovated, linking the walkways into the Pandacan Linear Park, a buffer zone made into a park separating the oil distribution facilities from the residential- commercial areas. The Pandacan Linear Park, developed under the support of the big three oil companies and the city government of Manila, allows for a leisure walk and recreational activities along the Pasig River. =Modern housing= Sections of the district are seeing improvements with a low-cost housing development in the site of the compound of the Manila City Engineer's Office beside the Nagtahan Bridge called \\"Residencias de Manila\\". Tourism and Events The Sto. Ni√±o de Pandacan Parish, which celebrates its fiesta every third Sunday of January. Manila boasts its rich cultural history every year in Pandacan with the traditional \\"Buling Buling\\" Dance Festival. Because many of the country's literary and musical geniuses of the 19th century came from Pandacan, an annual traditional dancing in the streets of Pandacan is featured every Saturday before the main celebrations for the feast of the Santo Ni√±o every third week of January.

The district includes several suburban and rural areas east of Nashville. A Republican, she was previously elected to the Tennessee Senate, serving as floor leader of the Republican Caucus. She unsuccessfully ran for the Republican nomination in the 2018 Tennessee gubernatorial election. Early life and education Diane Lynn Warren was born on January 16, 1951 in Baltimore, Maryland, to Joseph and Audrey Warren. Warren graduated from Andover High School in Linthicum, Maryland, in 1969 and was the first member of her family to earn a college degree. Following graduation from Anne Arundel Community College in Arnold, Maryland, with an associate's degree in nursing, went on to Belmont University, earning a bachelor's degree in nursing in 1991. Career Black worked as a registered nurse until she ran for the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1998. Later, she served as an educator at Volunteer State Community College in Gallatin, Tennessee. = Tennessee legislature = Before becoming a state Senator in 2004, she had previously served as a state Representative for six years from 1998. Prior to her election as a Republican state representative, Black had voted in two Democratic primaries in 1996. Black was the Assistant Floor Leader of the Senate Republican Caucus, a member of the Senate Government Operations Committee, and the Vice-Chairwoman of the Senate General Welfare, Health, and Human Resources Committee. She was elected the Tennessee Senate Republican Caucus Chairwoman in 2006. In May 2009, Black's legislative aide forwarded an e-mail depicting a collage of United States Presidents. President Barack Obama's section of the collage was represented by a black square with two eyeballs. Black's reprimand of her aide was criticized as too lenient by two political blogs and Tennessee Democratic Party Chairwoman Chip Forrester. Black said the e-mail did not represent her views, and that the reprimand of her aide was in keeping with the legislator's human resource policy for e-mail guideline violations. =U.S. House of Representatives= Black was one of two female U.S. Representatives who prefer the title \\"congressman\\"; the other was Republican Marsha Blackburn, also of Tennessee. Both departed the House at the end of the 115th Congress. 2010 election In December, 2009, she became a candidate for Tennessee's 6th congressional district to succeed Bart Gordon, who did not run for re-election. Her biggest competition in the Republican primary came from former Rutherford County GOP chairwoman Lou Ann Zelenik and State Senator Jim Tracy. On August 5, 2010, Black won the Republican primary with 31% of the vote, over Zelenik and Tracy, who earned 30% each. Brett Carter won the Democratic nomination, after well-known elected officials declined the candidacy, leading most Democratic observers to write off the seat as a Republican pick-up. CQ Politics rated this race as \\"Safe Republican\\". In the November election, Black won with 67 percent of the vote. 2012 to present In the 2012 general election, Black was a surrogate for Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney. Black made appearances for Romney in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and in various cable news interviews. Black has been a member of the following committees: Committee on the Budget, Committee on Ways and Means, Subcommittee on Human Resources, Tea Party Caucus, Republican Study Committee, and the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus. In October 2013, Black introduced the Student and Family Tax Simplification Act (H.R. 3393; 113th Congress), a bill that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to consolidate several different education tax incentives into an expanded American Opportunity Tax Credit. The American Opportunity Tax Credit, under this legislation, would provide a maximum credit of $2,500.

Black was a member of the U.S.-Japan Caucus. 2018 gubernatorial run On August 2, 2017, Black announced her intention to run for Governor of Tennessee in the 2018 election. In March 2018, the Tennessean reported that Black had missed over 50 votes in the U.S. House, the most out of any member of the Tennessee delegation. The newspaper noted that it is typical for members of Congress running for a higher office to miss votes, but that some votes were on major pieces of legislation, including re-opening the government following the 2018 shutdown and funding the U.S. military. Black lost to Bill Lee in the Republican primary on August 2, 2018. Political positions During her 2018 gubernatorial run, Black \\"positioned herself as an ally of President Trump who would crack down on illegal immigration and introduce work requirements for government benefits,\\" according to The Washington Post. The American Conservative Union gave her a 91% evaluation in 2017. =National security= Black supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. She stated that \\"We should insist upon the most careful and cautious vetting possible for refugees from failed states and hostile nations and I commend the President for taking this duty seriously after the failures of the Obama administration.\\" =Environmental Protection Agency= Black often advocated against the Obama administration's EPA rules. She also supported the Trump administration's repeal of the Obama-era Clean Power Plan. Black championed a loophole which allowed one trucking company (Fitzgerald) to skirt emissions rules, allowing the firm to produce trucks that emit 40 to 55 times the air pollutants of other new trucks. When the Obama administration sought to close the loophole, Black introduced legislation in 2015 to protect the loophole; the bill failed. She later appealed to the Trump administration's EPA head, Scott Pruitt, to protect the loophole, which he did. As of February 2018, individuals and entities related to the Fitzgerald trucking company had donated $225,000 to Black's 2018 campaign for Tennessee Governor; 12% of the total money from outside sources in her campaign. In September 2017, Fitzgerald hired its first federal lobbyist; it was a former aide to Black. =Sanctuary cities= She opposed sanctuary cities. = Comments on school shootings = In May 2018, Black said that pornography was \\"a big part of the root cause\\" of school shootings.CNN, May 29, 2018, Veronica Stracqualursi, Tennessee lawmaker says pornography is a 'root cause' of school shootings, Retrieved May 31, 2018, \\"...Why do we see kids being so violent? ...Pornography. It's available. ...\\" She also said that school shootings were rising due to the \\"deterioration of the family,\\" mental illness, and violent movies. Personal life Since 1980, Diane Black has been married to David Black. Although the two met in high school, they went their separate ways after graduation. She married her high school sweetheart shortly after graduating, but he struggled with alcoholism and abruptly abandoned the family when she was pregnant with her third child. David's first marriage, which lasted seven years, ended amicably in divorce. The two met again several years later, and he proposed to her on a ski lift. David legally adopted her three children. In 2013 financial disclosure forms, Black listed 115 assets jointly held with her husband. These assets were valued between $32 million and $146.9 million. In 2012, these assets were worth between $34.4 million and $142.19 million.

He performed on pop music programs, Six O'Clock Rock, Bandstand, Johnny O'Keefe Show, Sing Sing Sing, Saturday Date, and Woody's Teen Time. He issued a compilation album, A Tribute to the King Rare Songs 1957-1965, in 1988. Stanton released singles via Leedon Records, starting with \\"Don't Let Go\\" in April 1960. His second, \\"Don't You Worry 'Bout That\\" (September), was written by O'Keefe, which reached number 3 on the local Top 40\\\\. His fourth single, \\"Beggin' on My Knees\\" (November 1961), was written by his brother Rod and reached number 16, nationally. Stanton was signed by RCA in 1964 and issued another single, \\"A Tribute to the King\\". This was written by fellow musician and the label's A&R;, Johnny Devlin. He followed with \\"My Little Emmy\\" in July 1965, which was written by Stanton. Even though he was a popular performer locally, he achieved little commercial success internationally. Stanton subsequently performed with other early Australian rockers. Early life Barry Stanton was born in London on 23 January 1941. The Stanton family‚ÄîStella Rose, Carl Leopold, Barry John and Rodney‚Äîmigrated to Australia in 1948. They settled in the Sydney suburb of Neutral Bay. At the age of 15 Stanton became interested in rock and roll. He left school and worked as apprentice motor mechanic. His early bands included the Boppers and the Bellairs; they played gigs at local dance halls. Stanton provided \\"some Presley-type singing and guitar-playing.\\" In 1957 he recorded material, which was not released until 1988, issued on his compilation album, A Tribute to the King Rare Songs 1957-1965, via Canetoad Records. According to Ainslie Baker of The Australian Women's Weekly, he \\"has brown eyes, is 6ft. 1in. tall, weighs 13- stone, likes cars and car-racing, surfing, and football.\\" Lee Gordon/Leedon Stanton was \\"talent spotted\\" in 1959 while playing during the interval in between Marlon Brando and James Dean films at Manly's Embassy Theatre, by 2SM radio DJ, Allan Lappan. He was recommended to Johnny O'Keefe who recruited Stanton for a spot on the rocker's TV pop music show, Six O'Clock Rock. He became \\"one of the most popular young male artists of the day.\\" He also appeared regularly on pop, variety TV show, Bandstand. One of the few artists to use his real name, O'Keefe branded him the \\"Big Boy of Rock\\" due to his solid physique. Stanton signed to O'Keefe and Lee Gordon's label, Leedon Records, in 1960, which issued his debut extended play, Barry Stanton Sings. His first single ‚Äì a cover version of Roy Hamilton's \\"Don't Let Go\\" ‚Äì appeared in April. It was recorded with chorus and orchestra directed by Eddie Cash, Jr. He began touring with other local artists, Digby Richards, Jimmy Little, and Warren Williams. In May to June that year he took part in an interstate tour supporting Johnny O'Keefe and the Dee Jays, Laurel Lea, Booka Hyland, Lonnie Lee, the Sapphires and Ray Hoff. Stanton left the tour in mid- June as he was \\"too exhausted to sign on for an extra week of engagements.\\" In the following week O'Keefe lost control of his Plymouth Belvedere near Kempsey and was involved in a serious car accident. Stanton's follow-up single, \\"Don't You Worry 'Bout That\\", written by O'Keefe, appeared in September 1960. It was well received in most states, reaching No. 37 on the Sydney music charts. Late in the following year he issued his fourth single, \\"Beggin's on My Knees\\", which became his most successful hit when it reached No. 16 on the national top 40. The track is written by his younger brother, Rod Stanton, who later explained how \\"One day, strumming on an old guitar given to him by Barry, he asked his brother to have a listen to a fresh composition he was quite happy with. Its potential was immediately recognised by Barry and, perhaps even more importantly, by his producer, [O'Keefe].\\" Warren Carr played its \\"ear grabbing tinkling piano.\\" 1964-1980 Stanton was approached to switch to RCA by New Zealand-born rocker Johnny Devlin, who from late 1963 was the label's Australian A&R; manager and house producer. Stanton's first single on the label, \\"Tribute to the King\\" was released in 1964. It was written by Devlin as a tribute to Presley, which \\"consisted of 32 Elvis Presley song titles set to rocking instrumental backing provided by Devlin's backing band The Devils.\\" His next single, \\"My Little Emmy\\", which was written by Stanton, was released in July 1965. Stanton undertook interstate tours supporting Billy Thorpe & the Aztecs and Ray Brown & the Whispers. Though only releasing two singles while at RCA, he recorded more material, however after leaving the label in 1966, the recordings were unreleased. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, \\"with the lack of success of his RCA sides, Stanton gave up his rock'n'roll career to work as an electrician.\\" In 1974 he resumed his music career to join O'Keefe and fellow 1960s rockers Ray Brown, Lonnie Lee, Jade Hurley, Johnny Devlin, Dinah Lee and Tony Brady as part of a touring ensemble, The Good Old Days of Rock 'n' Roll. The nostalgia circuit was successful with the tour continuing for four years. In 1978 he issued a single, \\"City of Armidale\\", via the Bunyip label. 1981-onward In 1981 Raven Records issued a compilation, split album, Rock On!, with \\"most of Stanton's singles as one half\\" and the rest from fellow rocker, Johnny Rebb. Stanton's early material, including previously unreleased tracks, was issued as a solo compilation album, A Tribute to the King Rare Songs 1957-1965, via Canetoad Records. Concert bookings had become rarer, and Stanton returned to working a day job, as a warehouse manager. He periodically played shows until 2006, when he took a break from showbiz to spend time with his grandchildren. After two years, he performed a comeback concert in Melbourne.  Personal life  Barry Stanton married fellow singer, Kelly Green, and the couple had two children. They had met in Green's hometown of Perth at the Fiesta Theatre, and after Green relocated to Sydney in 1962 Stanton saw her on Bandstand and they started dating. Stanton wrote one of Green's tracks, \\"Tell Me That You Love Me Too\\", which was the B-side of her single, \\"Do You?\\" (August 1964). The couple separated in 1965 before their second child was born, with Green returning to Perth. In the mid-1970s he married a second time, to Rena, and this couple had three children. Stanton died of renal failure on 21 January 2018, two days short of his 77th birthday. Discography * Don't Let Go (1960) Lee Gordon # Don't Let Go (I. Hayes) # I Got A Woman (R. Richard/R.

He studied under Morihei Ueshiba (the founder of Aikido) and Ogasawara (a teacher of the Kototama Principle) for many years. Born in the Kagoshima prefecture of Japan, he relocated to France in 1961 where he remained until the early 1970s as a representative of the Aikikai in Europe and North Africa. According to an article by his son, Jei Atacama, Mutsuro Nakazono \\"changed his name to Masahilo Mikoto Nakazono in his late fifties when he came to realize how his whole life was about his pursuit for 'the truth of life.' 'Masahilo' stood for 'searcher for the beautiful truth of life.'\\" During this period he was also Chief instructor of Aikido for the international Budo Council. According to Henry Ellis, a pioneer of UK Akido, Nakazonon Sensei's Aikido technique was \\"the first seen in the U.K. to combine the power found with other instructors, with the grace normally associated with Akido today.\\" He operated the Nakazono Clinic, a natural healing center in San Diego, California. He moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1972 and lived there until he died on October 8, 1994. Nakazono was an authority on kototama (also known as kotodama) and wrote privately published books on the subject. His study of kototama was greatly influenced by his studies with ≈åsensei Ueshiba who cultivated a spiritual outlook in his teachings. He is believed to have mastered kototama to a certain degree, yet few of his disciples demonstrated an interest in learning this aspect of aikido from him. The exception was Nakazono Sensei. Nakazono was also deeply involved in the spiritual aspect of healing such as Inochi. Having descended from a long family tradition of healers he passed on both his interest in Aikido and his spiritual approach to healing to his son Jiro Nakazono (now known as Jei Atacama) who practiced spiritual healing in New York City until his own death. In 2007 there was a series of memorial events in Rosfall, Switzerland and Neath, UK sponsored by Nakazono Sensei's students in memory of their beloved teacher.  Works  * M.

It is a mesotrophic lake located in the headwaters of the River Aeron, whose low nutrient waters are home to a number of locally rare water plants. Waterfowl and passing sea birds can be seen on the lake as can dragonflies, damselflies, and caddis flies in the summer. The lake has a surface are of and a maximum depth of . It lies in a hollow probably scoured out glacially, and is dammed by a moraine. Palynological studies show that it has developed since the last ice age and is a remnant of a larger lake, Llyn Farch, which has otherwise dried up. It is surrounded by pasture grazed by cattle and sheep and at the southern end is a small peat mire. There are tussocks of purple moor-grass and tall cushions of common hair moss and Sphagnum recurvum. In the old peat cuttings, marsh cinquefoil, bog asphodel, bogbean, beaked sedge and Sphagnum spp. grow. In the open water at the southern end, yellow water lilies and European white water lilies float on the surface, and at the northern end can be found water lobelia, lake quillwort, Littorella uniflora and a few plants of water awlwort, all uncommon species in this area. In the sometimes boggy rough grassland surrounding the lake are also common spike-rush, water horsetail, sharp-flowered rush and soft rush, marsh willowherb, marsh-bedstraw, floating sweet-grass, bogbean and lesser spearwort.

In the Americas the term was applied to native villages or bunkhouses. English adopted the term with both these meanings, usually to designate the residential area of a rancho in the American Southwest, housing aboriginal ranch hands and their families. The term is still used in other parts of Spanish America; for example, the Wayuu tribes in northern Colombia call their villages rancher√≠as. The Columbia Encyclopedia describes it as: :a type of communal settlement formerly characteristic of the Yaqui Indians of Sonora, Tepehuanes of Durango, Mexico, and of various small Native American groups of the Southwestern U.S., especially in California. These clusters of dwellings were less permanent than the pueblos (see Pueblo) but more so than the camps of the migratory Native Americans.Rancheria. The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition. 2001-07 (retrieved 12 April 2009) The term could be applied to the settlements of the California Mission Indians beyond the Spanish missions, such as Maugna of the Tongva people. History In California, the term refers to a total of 59 Indian settlements established by the U.S. government, 54 of them between 1906 and 1934, for the survivors of the aboriginal population. San Diego State University maintains a reference titled California Indians and Their Reservations: An Online Dictionary. It says: The word migrated north with the 49ers to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in an adapted form, \\"rancherie\\". It survives in British Columbia as a somewhat archaic but still commonly used word, in rural areas and small towns, as well as in general First Nations English usage, meaning the residential area of an Indian Reserve. It especially means the historical residential area, as opposed to newer subdivisions. It was further extended to refer to other non-white residential communities, such as the Kanaka Rancherie in early Vancouver, British Columbia, which came to house the city's Kanaka (Hawaiian) residents. In an even more truncated form, the Ranche was used to refer to the Tlingit portion of Sitka, Alaska.

Plot The book tells the story of three women, Claire, Guinea, and Deb, who are co-workers in the beauty salon of an exclusive Sydney hotel. The story weaves together these characters with their familial and romantic relationships, as they struggle to manage the realities of working for the privileged upper classes, to whom no rules apply, while their own families cope with wartime deaths and losses, rationing, government manpower recruitment, and stiflingly conservative attitudes surrounding the role and perception of the \\"acceptable\\" behaviour of women. Publication The original novel was so controversial that it could only be published in abridged form. The characters' journeys cover such topics as abortion, adultery, prostitution and rape, as well as promiscuity and the black market. The book was restored to its original form by Florence James and republished in 1987, partly due to the interest caused by the development of a television adaptation of the book. Unfortunately Dymphna Cusack was not able to take part in this restoration or witness the renewed popularity of the novel, as she died in 1981. Film and television In the 1950s, film director Jack Lee expressed interest in making a movie out of the novel. In 1989‚Äì90, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation made a television mini-series based on the novel, starring Lisa Harrow, Kerry Armstrong and Rebecca Gibney. It was well received by critics and audiences, and was released on DVD in 2005.Ed.

It was a non-profit international organization based in Switzerland. DAVIC was closed, according to its statutes, after 5 years of activity. At the most DAVIC had 222 companies from more than 25 countries as members, although over its life 295 organisations were members at some stage. It represented all sectors of the audio-visual industry: manufacturing (computer, consumer electronics and telecommunications equipment) and service (broadcasting, telecommunications and CATV), as well as a number of government agencies and research organisations. The four major sets of specifications culminated in 1999 with the 1.4 version. The 1.5 version of DAVIC was a set of additional tools and service definitions opening the road towards the setting of IP based audiovisual services such as the TV Anytime and TV Anywhere services. Version 1.3.1 was re-structured and was approved as an ISO/IEC standard and technical report (ISO/IEC 16500 and ISO/IEC TR 16501). The management of DAVIC had proposed the continuation beyond the 5-year date with a program of work centred on two projects: TV Anytime and TV Anywhere.

It is 493 km by road from Adelaide. Franklin Harbor is a natural harbour 49 km¬≤ in area with a channel to the sea just 100 metres wide. The town of Cowell is the major population centre of the District Council of Franklin Harbour, and the centre of an agricultural district, farming wheat and sheep. The district covers an area of 3,283 square kilometres with a district population in 2011 of 1070. Fishing, and more recently, oyster farming has also been an important industry. History When settlers commenced farming the area in 1853, Franklin Harbour became a logical place to load ships for export of wheat and wool and a small settlement was soon established. The town was surveyed during July 1880 and was proclaimed on 28 October 1880. It was named after John Clayton Cowell who was a British soldier who served as the Governor of Windsor Castle. The locality's boundaries were gazetted on 23 December 1998 and include the Government Town of Cowell and the site of the ceased Government Town of Ferns, and the unbounded localities of Yabmana and Elbow Hill. In 1965, a deposit of jade was discovered in the nearby Minbrie Ranges. To date over 100 outcrops have been found within an area of 9 square kilometres and as such has been designated by the South Australian Department of Minerals and Energy Resources as the \\"Cowell Jade Province\\". The Franklin Harbour Historical Museum, situated in the old post office residence in Main Street, Cowell preserves many historically important artefacts of the region, both natural and manmade. The historic Franklin Harbour Hotel in Main Street is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Geography The township of Cowell lies on Franklin Harbour, a naturally a land-locked bay with a narrow entrance through which the tide rushes in and out. This results in calm waters inside the harbour, with much of the bay being dominated by shallow tidal mud flats and associated mangrove ecosystems. Due to the velocity of the tide through the harbour‚Äôs entrance, the waters of the bay are constantly filled with clay and silt particles that are kept in suspension by the moving water. There are very few sandy beaches lining the harbour due to this fact. The Franklin Harbor Conservation Park is established on the southern arm of the harbour and Entrance Island. The waters of Franklin Harbour lie within the outer boundary of the Franklin Harbor Marine Park. Fishing is permitted within the park, but is prohibited within several internal sanctuary zones. The park extends into Spencer Gulf and northward past Lucky Bay to Port Gibbon.\\"Department of Environment, Water & Natural Resources - Franklin Harbor\\" Government of South Australia. Retrieved 2013-12-10. Inland, the landscape is dominated by agricultural land, as well as areas of untouched vegetation on the coastal margins. The Minbrie Ranges can be found further inland. Economy Agriculture and commercial fishing have long been the dominant sectors of the local economy, with commodities such as wheat and wool being the driving force for the establishment of the town. In earlier years such produce was exported from Cowell by means of sailing ketches. The first jetty at Cowell was built in 1881, and although several extensions were added later, it was still of an inadequate length. A new main jetty was opened in 1913 but the old jetty remained until demolished in 1975. The old jetty was then replaced by a structure on concrete piles with wood deck, some 146 metres long, known as the fishermen's jetty. The major crops of the area are cereals such as wheat, barley and oats, with legumes also grown. Sheep are still farmed in the district, with Cattle and Goats introduced more recently. Aquaculture has become a vital part of the economy in Franklin Harbour in recent years. The excellent tidal flow makes it suitable for the farming of Pacific Oysters, which are regarded as some of the best quality produced in South Australia. Tourism is an important economic drive for the town, with tourists flocking to the area at Easter and over the summer holidays. Fishing for many species including King George and Silver whiting, Garfish, Mullet, Flathead, Snapper, Tommy Ruff, Snook, Yellowfin Whiting, squid and crabs is very popular, with other forms of water sport available further up the coastline. There are other attractions such as Cowell Jade, which showcases the region‚Äôs Jade, as well as numerous scenic drives, some of which are suitable for 4x4 only. Historical locations include the site of children's author May Gibbs' first Australian residence. A memorial stands 10 km from Cowell, along the Cowell to Cleve road. Community and demographics At the time of the , the combined population of the localities of Cowell and Port Gibbon was recorded as being 1069 while the population of the Cowell town centre or 'urban centre' as it was described as by the Australian Bureau of Statistics was 942. Of the 1069, 523 were female and 546 were male. The indigenous population in Cowell is 1%. The most common response for religious affiliation was \\"No Religion\\" 27.1%, followed by Uniting Church 19.5%, Catholic 13.3%, Lutheran 11.1% and Anglican 10.6%, with a number of churches in the town to support this. There are two hotels present in the town, both on the main street. There is a variety of sporting clubs, including football, cricket and netball clubs; all of which compete in local leagues. The town also has a hospital, an area school, Cowell Area School, and a police station to service the district. Government Cowell is located in the District Council of Franklin Harbour local government area, the state electoral district of Giles and the federal Division of Grey. Transport Cowell is located on the Lincoln Highway (B100), five to six hours drive from Adelaide. Stateliner coach services run daily between Port Lincoln and Adelaide, stopping in Cowell. The Sea SA ferry service departs from nearby Lucky Bay across the Spencer Gulf to Wallaroo. The journey takes approximately 2 hours dependent on conditions.SeaSA website Retrieved 2013-11-05. Services were suspended in August 2014, with the company announcing plans to recommence in late 2016 using a new ferry that is currently under construction. On the day of the , 6.7% of employed people travelled to work on public transport and 57.5% by car (either as driver or as passenger). Cowell Airport is located near the town, offering access by small aircraft but is not served by any airlines.

Later, in Cork Prison, Maurice Ahern was the first man to go on hunger strike. Liams' son Michael Ahern was a Fianna F√°il TD for Cork East from 1982 to 2011. Another son, auctioneer Maurice Ahern was a long-standing Fianna F√°il councillor for the Midleton electoral area of Cork County Council from 1979 to 2009. Liam's grand-daughter Ann - Marie Ahern was co-opted by Fianna Fail to Cork County Council in 2020. Political career A farmer and agricultural contractor, Ahern was first elected to the 9th Seanad in 1957 on the Labour Panel. In 1961 he was returned to the 10th Seanad on the Administrative Panel, and re-elected by the same panel to the 11th Seanad in 1965. At the 1969 general election, he stood for election to the 19th D√°il in the Cork North-East constituency, but was narrowly beaten by his Fianna F√°il colleague Se√°n Brosnan. After his defeat, Ahern was returned to the 12th Seanad by the Administrative Panel. At the 1973 general election, he again contested Cork North-East, where he came fourth out of the four successful candidates, unseating the sitting Fianna F√°il TD Se√°n Brosnan. A Fine Gael‚ÄìLabour Party coalition government under Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave took power at that election, ending a sixteen-year period of Fianna F√°il government, and Ahern found himself in opposition for the first time in his career in the Oireachtas. He caused a minor sensation during the D√°il debate on the seizure of IRA arms on the MV Claudia in May 1973 when he shouted out, \\"More guns we want, bags of guns.\\" He died in July 1974 at the age of 58, triggering a by-election on 13 November 1974 in which his seat was retained for Fianna F√°il by Se√°n Brosnan.

It was founded by American Australian entrepreneur Lee Gordon in early 1958. Establishment and early releases In Australian in the 1950s and early 1960s, locally distributed labels such as His Masters Voice, London Records, Pye and Parlophone and indigenous labels such as Coronet and W&G; Records had few Australian rock'n'roll artist on their rosters; their main focus was on local releases of British and American artists or, local mainstream vocalists or artists, as well as others. The advent of Leedon Records in 1958, soon after the establishment of Australia's first Top 40 charts, played a significant role in the development of Australia's local rock and pop scene, especially in the decade following the label's acquisition by Festival Records in 1960. Entrepreneur Lee Gordon had broken into the Australian entertainment scene in 1955 with a record-setting tour by vocalist Johnnie Ray, followed by a string of star-studded \\"Big Show\\" jazz/pop package tours featuring stars including Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong and Thelonious Monk. In 1957 he promoted the first rock'n'roll bill to tour Australia, headlined by Bill Haley & the Comets Leedon and its sister label Lee Gordon Records as an adjunct to his hugely successful tour promotion business. Through his American connections, Gordon had promoted many historic jazz tours and in January 1957 he brought the first rock'n'roll tour to Australia, featuring. He then secured the Australian release rights to the American Roulette Records label and signed a pressing and distribution deal with the Australian Record Company (which was later taken over by CBS Records). Leedon's first releases were \\"Oh, Oh I'm Falling In Love Again\\" by Jimmie Rodgers and \\"(Make With) The Shake\\" by The Mark IV. Other releases included singles by Duane Eddy, Huey Piano Smith, Dion & The Belmonts, Dick Dale and Little Junior Parker. Most of their early releases featured overseas acts, as illustrated above, however they did provide a release for some local recordings including Johnny Rebb & The Rebels' 'Hey Sheriff' in 1958. =Johnny \\"Scat\\" Brown= Notable among Leedon's early releases were a couple of wild singles credited to the mysterious Johnny 'Scat' Brown - \\"Indeed I Do\\" (Leedon 514) and \\"Mama Rock\\" (Leedon 518). The flip sides of both records were performed by totally different artists, despite the fact the b-side of \\"Indeed I Do\\" also listed Johnny Scat Brown as the singer. The performer of \\"Little Star\\", the flip of \\"Mama Rock\\" was shown as Moon Rockets, another mystery act. These singles were preceded by another Leedon single (#008) also billed to Johnny 'Scat' Brown which featured cover versions of current American chart hits, Sheb Wooley's \\"The Purple People Eater\\" and David Seville's \\"Witch Doctor\\". However aural evidence suggests this first Johnny Scat Brown single release is a completely different artist. Some of these singles were released locally in the face of 'embargo' restrictions placed on them by publishing companies such as Chappell Music. \\"Indeed I Do\\" and \\"Mama Rock\\" had been recorded in the US, featuring vocals performed by an Elvis Presley-soundalike singer. The singer's identity was unknown to Leedon staff at the time, as the tapes had been sent to them from the US by Lee Gordon without any recording details. As a result, company manager Alan Heffernan created the pseudonym Johnny \\"Scat\\" Brown. According to former Leedon employee Max Moore, Heffernan's cousin discovered decades later (the 70s), that although there was a real Johnny \\"Scat\\" Brown performing in the US, the person who had recorded \\"Indeed I Do\\" and \\"Mama Rock\\" was noted rockabilly artist Johnny Powers.Moore, Max 2003: Some Days Are Diamonds (New Holland Publishing, Sydney, 2003), pp.102-107 Johnny O'Keefe becomes A&R; manager During 1959 leading Australian rock'n'roll singer Johnny O'Keefe was engaged as the label's A&R; manager. Although he was still contracted to Festival Records at the time, O'Keefe was able to work as a consultant to Leedon, and he signed a number of other prominent Australian artists including Lonnie Lee, The Delltones and Warren Williams. According to Leedon employee Max Moore, O'Keefe did not receive a salary for this work, so he was compensated with an increase in his fee for appearances on Gordon's famous \\"Big Show\\" concert tours, on which he had become a regular featured attraction. Acquisition by Festival By 1960, Lee Gordon's business enterprises were making significant losses, and without consulting Heffernan (who was also the general manager and chief accountant of Gordon's promotions company Big Show Pty Ltd), he sold the label to Festival Records for a reported figure of AU¬£10,000. Leedon continued operation as a wholly owned subsidiary of Festival until 1969. Gordon died in London in 1963. The Leedon \\"LK\\" series was started in June 1961 with Lonnie Lee's \\"You're Gonna Miss Me\\" and from this point on the label's releases were made up almost entirely of Australian artists. Johnny O'Keefe featured very prominently in this series. Internationally, Leedon's most significant signing was a young British-born vocal trio, The Bee Gees, who recorded numerous singles and one LP for the label. Although they penned several local hits for other performers, none of their own Leedon recordings were commercially successful, and by 1966 Festival was on the verge of dropping them. However their manager at that time, Nat Kipner had just been appointed to head new Sydney label Spin Records and he was able to negotiate the group's move from Leedon to Spin, in exchange for Festival being granted the Australian distribution rights to their subsequent recordings, a lucrative deal that continued for several years after the band moved back to UK in 1967 and signed internationally with the Robert Stigwood Organisation and Polydor. In the mid-1960s Leedon released many classic beat- era singles and albums by bands including Ray Brown & The Whispers, The Showmen, The Pogs, The Amazons, which featured singer Johnny Cave (aka William Shakespeare) and bassist Harry Brus. The label's final release was a reissue of \\"She's My Baby\\" by Johnny O'Keefe. which had been recorded in 1959. By the time the label was folded in 1969, it had released 420 singles. The Leedon LK Series featured many prominent Australian artists including Barry Stanton, Booka Hyland, Warren Williams, Ian Crawford, Paul Wayne, Jerry J. Wilder, The Barry Sisters, The Dee Jays, The Crescents, The Taylor Sisters etc. All got their big break with Leedon, who nourished and supported them throughout their careers‚Äîwith shows and gigs along the way.

It is a thin cr√©pe roll made from a wide strip of shahe fen (rice noodles), filled with shrimp, beef, vegetables, or other ingredients. Seasoned soy sauce‚Äîsometimes with siu mei drippings‚Äîis poured over the dish upon serving. When plain and made without filling, the rice noodle is also known as jyu cheung fan. The name, jyu cheung fan, ‚Äújyu‚Äù means ‚Äúpig‚Äù in Cantonese, ‚Äúcheung‚Äù means ‚Äúintestine‚Äù, and ‚Äúfan‚Äù means ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù. Combining means the pig intestine noodle roll because the appearance of the noodle roll looks like pig's intestine. There is no official recording of the history of the rice noodle roll. Most cooking books mention that the jyu cheung fan was begun in the 1930s. A snack or breakfast that sold in many street restaurants. In Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, people called it laai cheung because it is a noodle roll that pulled or pushed by hand. Preparation The rice noodle sheets are made from a viscous mixture of 1 cup of rice flour and 1/4 cup tapioca or glutinous rice flour and water; this recipe will scale well as long as the ratio of flours and water remain the same. The combination of both types of flour and water should be a consistency of heavy cream. The rice flour serves as the bulk and flavor of rice, the tapioca flour gives the noodle elasticity and springiness. The tapioca or glutinous rice flour may be omitted when using rice flour made from certain kinds of aged rice, as chemical changes in the aged rice produce the same texture as the addition of the second starch. Either way, it should never crumble nor be too chewy. It should never have the al dente texture as with Italian pasta. Boric acid is sometimes used to make it have a very smooth texture or plastic sheen. Boric acid is banned for human consumption as a food ingredient in the United States, European Union, and developing countries as it may cause kidney failure. This liquid mixture is poured into a specially made flat pan with holes (similar to a flat colander). Commercial restaurants instead use special oversized steamers that are lined with a steam-permeable cloth. The noodle mixture is steamed in the pan from the bottom up to produce the square rice noodle sheets. The thickness of the noodle should be very thin (roughly thickness), never thick, or it will have a gummy texture. Once the liquid mixture is ladled and set, the chef can add a filling such as shrimp or beef before the noodle is fully cooked. As the noodle is cooking, it will start to set around the filling and take hold without falling out when transferring from steamer to dish. After steaming for several minutes, the entire freshly steamed noodle is melded onto the cloth thereby the necessity to be scraped off with a scraper and onto a usually a metal table surface with a thin coat of oil to prevent sticking. The resulting freshly made noodle is lightly folded about three times. The resulting size is usually anywhere from 5 to 7 inches long by 1.5 to 2 inches wide. Traditionally, the noodles are finished with the addition of a warm, sweetened soy sauce just before serving. Cantonese/Hong Kong style Cheungfan is usually lightly folded (about 1.5 to 2 inches wide and 5 to 7 inches long) when there is filling inside, resulting in a much more pleasing look rather than a rolled up as a fruit roll up. Two common Cantonese words are typically used to describe a well-made rice noodle roll: heung (È¶ô; \\"fragrant\\") and waat (Êªë; \\"smooth\\"). The actual noodle by itself has little flavor; it is just as bland as plain white steamed rice. The fillings and the soy sauce that accompanies it provides the bulk of the flavor. Traditional fillings are marinated fresh or dried shrimp, beef (heavily mixed with rice flour), or pork and chopped green onions. As mentioned earlier, presentation is very important when serving dim sum. The rice noodle, when fully cooked, should be slightly transparent to slightly reveal the filling. If the edges after folding are not lined up then the edges are to be cut to get that even look, similar to getting the outer crust cut off a sandwich. The rice noodle roll is generally served in \\"threes\\" and usually scored to reveal the filling inside. Most other countries will roll them plain with no filling inside and instead serve them with toppings and a heavy/thick sauce on top. The rice noodle roll is always served hot and fresh and accompanied with a splash of plain or flavored (fried shallot) oil to give it a nice sheen and aroma with a generous amount of warm sweet soy sauce added right before serving. Most establishments will have a slightly different flavor of sweet soy sauce such as an addition of hoisin sauce. Regional =Cantonese cuisine= Mushroom Garlic Soy Sauce plain cheungfan with hoisin sauce, sesame sauce and roasted sesame seeds. Rice noodle roll with char siu In Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore, a hugely popular street food is plain cheungfan and is often served with soy sauce, hoisin sauce, sesame sauce and roasted sesame seeds. In Cantonese cuisine, rice noodle roll is most often served in dim sum. The most common types traditionally offered as part of dim sum cuisine are: * Beef rice noodle roll () * Shrimp rice noodle roll () *Dried shrimp rice noodle roll () *Char siu rice noodle roll () *Zhaliang () Rice noodle roll with chicken and bitter melon Other modern varieties that may be offered include: * Rice noodle roll with chicken and bitter melon * Rice noodle roll with conpoy and pea shoot * Rice noodle roll with fish * Stir- fried rice noodle roll with XO sauce A version of cheungfan notably absent outside of Guangzhou is the sliced meat filling variety. This variety is typically found in street side restaurants as a meal in itself, and uses whole meat pieces, typically beef or pork, rather than ground meat. Prior to rolling the crepe, briefly blanched lettuce or romaine is added as part of the filling, giving the cheungfan a crunch as well as volume. Guangdong jyu cheung fan sauce recipe: For the sauce recipe (one person's serving) : two pieces of garlic, 5 grams of dried mushroom, 20 grams of vegetable oil, 20ml of soy sauce, 15 grams of oyster sauce, 100ml of water, and 4 grams of sugar. * Put dry mushroom into water and let stand until it is softened. * Chop garlic and mushroom into small pieces. * Add oil into fryer and put chopped garlic * When chopped garlic turns yellowish, put chopped mushroom * Add oyster sauce, soy sauce, fry 30 seconds * Add water and sugar, let it boil. The most important ingredient is garlic and mushroom. =Southeast Asian cuisine= The Malaysian Penang style Chee cheong fun is served with a shrimp paste called hae ko in Hokkien dialect and \\"petis udang\\" in Malay language. Ipoh, being another food capital of Malaysia, Chee cheong fun is mainly served in two ways, the dry or wet versions. In the 'dry version', it is served with bright red sweet sauce and in most cases, chilli sauce as well as pickled green chilli. In the 'wet version', it is served with curry with pork rind and long bean or minced meat and shiitake mushroom gravy. Both dry or wet versions are topped with sesame seeds and fried shallots. Teluk Intan, one of the town in the state of Perak, has another variations of Chee cheong fun which contain turnips, shallots and deep fried shrimps. Chee cheong fun is a popular breakfast food in Singapore and Malaysia. Chee cheong fun is frequently served in kopitiams and Chinese restaurants. \\"Chee cheong fun\\" can also be found in Bagansiapiapi, a small town in Riau, Indonesia. It is called \\"tee long pan\\" or \\"tee cheong pan\\" in local Hokkian dialect. \\"Tee long pan\\" is served with red chilli sauce, crushed roasted-peanuts, fried onions, and dried shrimp. =Vietnamese cuisine= In Vietnamese cuisine, there is a similar dish called b√°nh cu·ªën, and it is mostly eaten for breakfast. It is a cr√™pe-like roll made from a thin, wide sheet of rice noodle (similar to Shahe fen) that can be filled with ground pork and other ingredients. Sides for this dish usually consist of ch·∫£ l·ª•a (Vietnamese pork sausage) and bean sprouts, while the dipping sauce is called n∆∞·ªõc ch·∫•m. Sometimes, a drop of c√† cu·ªëng, which is the essence of a giant water bug, Lethocerus indicus, is added to the n∆∞·ªõc ch·∫•m for extra flavor, although this ingredient is scarce and quite expensive.

The group released three albums and was perhaps Australia's most notable Gothic metal band for a number of years before splitting up in 2007. The band was formed by singer/keyboards player Shiralee Morgan and drummer Adrian Bickle in late 1996. The pair was at the time in a band called Jeneaha that released a demo before breaking up. Morgan and Bickle continued the project under the new name of Chalice. With guitarists Sean Graetz and Darren McLennan (from fellow Adelaide band Fury), bass player Mark Bodossian and Russell providing violin, the band recorded Chronicles of Dysphoria which won them the attention of Melbourne label Modern Invasion. In the meantime Justin Hartwig had replaced McLennan, who departed to continue with Fury and Alannah Probert also joined the band playing flute in place of the violinist. Chronicles of Dysphoria was then re-recorded with updated arrangements and released through Modern Invasion in 2000. In October they then featured at the Metal for the Brain festival in Canberra. Chalice recorded their second album during 2001 and it was released in October to coincide with another appearance at Metal for the Brain, this time on the main stage. Bodossian left the group after this and was replaced by Simon Henderson in time for a tour of the east coast in early 2002. Bodossian later joined the British doom band Esoteric. During 2003 Chalice completed their third album, Augmented, featuring some cello parts from Joel Baligod and Infernal Method member Joss Separovic contributing Spanish guitar in the track \\"Child of the Matador\\". The band also supported Opeth and Mayhem during their Australian tours that year. Adrian Bickle departed Chalice in 2005 and was replaced by Matt Enright. The group then did a tour of New Zealand during the year. A new EP was completed by mid-2006. Featuring strings provided by the Zephyr Quartet, \\"The Calm That Was the Storm\\" was Probert's last release with the band as she left prior to its release. A video was made of the title track and was included on the resultant CD. After this, the band's activities seemed to freeze for almost a year. On 5 May 2007, Justin Hartwig posted to the group's internet forum that he and the rest of Chalice had split from Morgan, bringing the group to an end and announcing a forthcoming new band called Black Orchid. Morgan has since contended that she too will continue a separate musical avenue.

Plot 33 Snowfish follows the character of Custis, a 10-year-old orphan living with his \\"owner\\" Bob Motley, who sexually abuses him, in a dilapidated house in Rockdale, Illinois. After overhearing that he was to star in a snuff movie, Custis steals a small pistol and escapes through a hole in the wall. While hiding from Motley's crew and begging for quarters in a video arcade at the Joliet Mall, Custis spots Boobie (whose real name is Darrin Flowers), a strange boy with black eyes and a single painted fingernail. Custis decides to follow Boobie into Crazy Lou's Woods, a private woodland supposedly owned by an ex-military cat farmer. Custis and Boobie soon become friends. Custis, having no home, and Boobie, who has an unstable relationship with his parents, set up a makeshift home in the woods with a tent and steal electricity from a nearby paper factory. Soon they are joined by Curl, Boobie's 14-year-old girlfriend who is addicted to drugs and supports herself as a prostitute, and finally Boobie's baby brother, whom Boobie abducts after murdering his parents. The four of them take to the road in a stolen Buick Skylark to flee the police who are searching for Boobie, engaging in dumpster diving, robbery and begging in various Chicago suburbs along the way. Characters * Custis ‚Äì A 10-year-old homeless boy who escaped from a child pornography operation. Custis carries a loaded handgun (a \\"gat\\") with three bullets and a broken trigger. He suffers from a seizure-like condition that he refers to as \\"migration (sic) headaches\\" which cause him to black out and wake up in different locations. He has frequent dreams about a mysterious individual called Big Tiny, who was said to have been his mother. * Curl ‚Äì A 14-year-old girl from Bolingbrook, Illinois, who used to live with her disabled aunt Frisco who forced her to turn tricks in their apartment. Curl is kind-hearted, acting as an older sister to Custis, as well as extremely superstitious, believing that she had met Boobie because she sat on top of a pile of Chex cereal on the first of May. She expresses a desire to settle down and marry both Custis and Boobie. * Boobie (Darrin Flowers) ‚Äì A 17-year-old boy from Joliet, Illinois who is a violent pyromaniac. Boobie rarely speaks, choosing to express himself via his drawings. He is possessive of Curl and extremely protective of Custis, with whom he shares a special friendship. Boobie eventually murders his parents and abducts his infant brother, and goes on the run from the police in a stolen Buick Skylark. * Boobie's brother ‚Äì An unnamed infant who sleeps in a gutted Magnavox TV in the back of Boobie's car. He has blue eyes and an odd seam down his forehead, for which he is thought to be unintelligent or defective by the others. He is regarded as a likely source of income if he can be sold. Reception Critical reception for 33 Snowfish has been positive, with the book garnering praise from the School Library Journal and Kirkus Reviews. Publishers Weekly commented on the book's language and content, stating \\"Readers may have trouble stomaching the language..., as well as the horrors so flatly depicted and, in the end, so handily overcome.\\" A reviewer for Kliatt also mentioned the book's mature themes, saying the book was \\"Not for every taste, but the grittiness and realistic dialogue here may help this bleak though ultimately uplifting novel find a readership.\\" The English Journal commented on the book's mature themes, citing it as one of several books that would help challenge teen readers.

Plot As the Fifth Doctor and his companions vacation in Tasmania they become caught up in a scheme by the Time Lord Ruath to resurrect the vampire Yarven (from Blood Harvest). Ruath sends a vampire baby to attack the Doctor and turn him into a vampire, but the child instead attacks and converts Nyssa. Unable to provide Yarven with the Doctor's Time Lord blood, Ruath gives her own blood to Yarven, causing her to die and regenerate into a vampire Time Lord. Nyssa, while trying fight her new vampire nature, is drawn to Yarven's castle, where she learns more about Ruath's plan. Ruath has created a genetically enhanced mist that can turn normal humans into vampires, and kill those who use traditional methods (garlic, crosses, etc.) to protect themselves. Ruath has also invented a Time Freeze, a small Time Loop that can hold the Earth in a perpetual night, leaving the vampires free to roam and feed.

This species is a deep bodied fish that possesses five to seven dark stripes laterally along the sides, the lowest few of these are often broken or disrupted anterior to the origin of the anal fin. This species is somewhat similar to two other species in the family Moronidae, the white bass and the striped bass. The yellow bass is distinguishable from both of these species by having the offset lateral stripes above the anal fin and from not possessing tooth patches on the tongue. The yellow bass differs further from the white bass by having nine to ten anal rays in comparison to eleven or thirteen. The back of the fish is usually a dark olive green, and the abdomen and sides are often a silvery yellow. Diet Food exploited by young yellow bass include small invertebrates including copepods and aquatic insects. The juvenile yellow bass feeds almost exclusively on aquatic insects and crustaceans, and once they reach adulthood they feed primarily on other small fishes; the rest of their diet consists of small crustaceans. Habitat and distribution Yellow bass may be found in somewhat clear waters of the Mississippi River from Minnesota to Louisiana and may also be found in the Trinity River and the Tennessee River. The yellow bass can also be found in lakes surrounding these rivers, especially in areas with dense vegetation and low turbidity. Reproduction and life cycle The reproductive biology of the yellow bass is similar to that of the white bass, where spawning occurs during the spring with fish swimming into the tributaries to make spawning runs. Spawning usually occurs in moderately shallow waters during which the female lays on her side and exposes the eggs as the male fertilizes from above. The larvae of the yellow bass school together to avoid predation and they grow fairly quickly in size. Yellow bass have average lifespan of about six years. Importance to humans The yellow bass is not as popular a gamefish as either the white bass or the striped bass because of its small size. They are usually caught by anglers fishing with crappie jigs or minnows. These fish may also be caught in large numbers because of their large populations. The yellow bass is edible and this fish is commonly eaten in its range. Etymology The specific name, mississippiensis, comes from the Mississippi River.

This sometimes (but not always) coevolutionary association is derived from insect pollination (entomophily) and is particularly well developed in some parts of the world, especially in the tropics, Southern Africa, and on some island chains. The association involves several distinctive plant adaptations forming a \\"pollination syndrome\\". The plants typically have colourful, often red, flowers with long tubular structures holding ample nectar and orientations of the stamen and stigma that ensure contact with the pollinator. Birds involved in ornithophily tend to be specialist nectarivores with brushy tongues and long bills, that are either capable of hovering flight or light enough to perch on the flower structures. Plant adaptations A lesser violetear Inflorescences of Butea allow birds to perch on the stalk Plant adaptations for ornithophily can be grouped primarily into those that attract and facilitate pollen transfer by birds, and those that exclude other groups, primarily insects, protecting against 'theft' of nectar and pollen. The ovules of bird flowers also tend to have adaptations that protect them from damage during vigorous foraging by hard bird bills. The flowers of generalist bird-pollinated plant species differ from those pollinated by specialized birds, such as hummingbirds or sunbirds by lacking long corolla tubes and having brush-like, exserted stamens. Most bird pollinated flowers are red and have a lot of nectar. They also tend to be unscented. Flowers with generalist pollinators tend to have dilute nectar but those that have specialist pollinators such as hummingbirds or sunbirds tend to have more concentrated nectar. The nectar of ornithophilous flowers vary in the sugar composition, with hexoses being high in passerine pollinated species while those that are insect pollinated tend to be sucrose rich. Hummingbird pollinated flowers however tend to be sucrose rich. Different plants have also developed specific adaptations for bird pollination. Many plants of the family Loranthaceae have explosive flowers that shower pollen on a bird that forages near it. They are associated mainly with flowerpeckers in the family Dicaeidae. In Australia, some species of Banksia have flowers that open in response to bird actions thereby reducing the wastage of pollen. In tropical dry forests in southern India, ornithophilous flowers were found to bloom mainly in the hot dry season. Calceolaria uniflora, a species of Scrophularaceae from South America, has a special fleshy appendage on the lower lip of the flower that is rich in sugar. This is fed on by the least seedsnipe (Thinocorus rumicivorus) and in the process the birds brush pollen onto their head and transfer them to other flowers. The rat's tail babiana (Babiana ringens) produces a strong stalk within the inflorescence that serves as a perch for the malachite sunbird as it visits the flower. Heliconias have special sticky threads that help in the adhesion of pollen to smooth structures such as the bill of a hummingbird. Some African orchids of the genus Disa have pollinaria that stick to the feet of visiting sunbirds. Plants need to protect against nectar and pollen being taken by non-pollinators. Such animals are sometimes classified as thieves, which simply remove resources without pollinating, and robbers, which damage the flower to access resources. Flowers specialized for pollination by long-billed birds may be especially vulnerable to theft. For example, some bees and birds that cannot reach down the long tubes of bird pollinated flowers simply pierce the flower at the base to obtain nectar, without pollinating.  Bird adaptations  Ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) at scarlet beebalm flowers (Monarda didyma) The main families of specialized nectar feeding birds that are involved in ornithophily are the hummingbirds (Trochilidae), sunbirds (Nectariniidae), and the honey-eaters (Meliphagidae). Other important bird groups include those in the families the Icteridae, the honeycreepers (Thraupidae, Drepanidae), white- eyes (Zosteropidae) and the South African sugar-birds (Promeropidae). Birds may obtain nectar either by perching or by hovering with the latter mainly found in the hummingbirds and sunbirds. Within the hummingbirds, two kinds of foraging are noted with territorial \\"hermit\\" hummingbirds and the non-hermits which forage longer distances Hummingbirds have the ability to digest sucrose unlike many passerines that prefer hexoses (fructose and glucose). Starlings and their relatives will completely avoid sucrose. Nectar feeding birds typically have a mechanism to quickly excrete excess water. They may have to drink four to five times their body mass of liquid during the day to obtain enough energy. Hummingbirds are capable of excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia since they can afford more water loss than birds that feed on low- moisture food sources. Hummingbirds and sunbirds also have special anatomical and physiological adaptations that allow them to quickly excrete excess water. Hummingbirds are also able to turn off their kidney function at night. In some birds such as white-eyes, the pollen dusted by the plants on the forehead of the birds may increase the wear of these feathers leading to increased moulting and replacement. Patterns in the evolution of ornithophily About 7000 neotropical plant species are hummingbird-pollinated in contrast to about 129 species of North American plants that have evolved ornithophilous associations. Nearly a fourth of the 900 species of the genus Salvia are bird- pollinated in Central and South America and a few also occur in South Africa. Tropical China and the adjacent Indochinese countries harbor relatively few bird-pollinated flowers, among them is Rhodoleia championii, a member of the family Hamamelidaceae, which at any one site can be visited and pollinated by up to seven species of nectar-foraging birds, including Japanese white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus, Zosteropidae) and fork-tailed sunbirds (Aethopyga christinae, Nectariniidae). Hummingbirds and ornithophilic flowers have a symbiotic relationship. A symbiotic relationship is a close relationship between species in which at least one species benefits. In the case of hummingbirds and flowers, both species receive benefits, creating a mutualistic relationship. Hummingbirds rely on nectar for energy, and ornithophilous flowers need hummingbirds‚Äô assistance with pollination in order to reproduce. While the birds are feeding, pollen sticks to their beaks, which will rub off on the next flower they visit, pollinating it. Over time, the co- dependence on one another causes the co-evolution of pollination syndromes. For example, different species of hummingbirds have differently shaped beaks, presumably to allow them to drink nectar from the flowers around them. It is widely believed that short-billed hummingbirds drink from wider flowers with short petals, and hummingbirds with longer bills have close relationships with flowers with long, narrow corollas. Most of the time, long-billed species have access to both short and long flowers, but they often avoid short flowers to avoid competition. Further, hummingbirds with curved bills will forage at straight-petaled flowers, but straight-billed birds are less likely to visit curved flowers. Ornithophilous flowers pollinated by hummingbirds often have reproductive structures that are vertically oriented. This creates a favorable upright body position for hummingbirds during feeding, one that allows them to sufficiently flap their wings for hovering. Hummingbirds prefer to visit larger and taller floral displays, and it has been proven and confirmed through many studies that birds prefer flowers with red or pink petals over other colors. Bird pollination is considered as a costly strategy for plants and it evolves only where there are particular benefits for the plant. High altitude ecosystems that lack insect pollinators, those in dry regions or isolated islands tend to favour the evolution of ornithophily, most by specialized nectarivorous birds, such as hummingbirds or sunbirds. Plants pollinated by generalist birds are most diverse in tropical and subtropical lowlands with a pronounced climatic seasonality. These plants are mostly large, woody species that produce a large number of open flowers at the same time in contrast to the mostly small shrubs and herbs that are pollinated by specialized nectarivorous birds. Since generalist bird-pollinated plants are mostly self-incompatible they needed to adapt to pollinators that mostly provide outcrossing, such as generalist birds. These birds mostly feed on arthropods, fruits or seeds even if lots of nectar is available and therefore move a lot through the forest. By this activity they often move between nectar-providing plants and provide outcrossing. Generalist bird-pollinated plants even evolved deterring mechanisms against specialized nectarivorous birds and bees since these groups tend to establish feeding territories within one tree and thus most conduct self-pollination. On islands however, generalist bird pollination did not evolve to avoid self-pollination but adapted to a reliable pollinator since bees and butterflies are rare just as on montane forests.  Migration and flowering synchrony  Anthropogenic induced warming has the potential to alter both plant and pollinator phenologies. Time of flowering is often used to mark the start of spring in temperate climate zones. Recently, studies have consistently found that plants respond to increasing temperatures by flowering earlier. Such synchronized timing is critical for pollination of plants and survival of hummingbirds. Hegland et al. discuss how hummingbird-flower mutualisms are disrupted by either distributional or phenological mismatches that could affect the availability of one partner. A recent study found that within a highly advanced plant-pollinator network, 17 to 50% of pollinators were impaired by disturbance of food supply as a result of phenological mismatch. Strong coevolution between hummingbirds and flowers has led to an adaptive specialization outcome in which important behaviors of both hummingbirds and flowers become synchronized. Because hummingbirds depend heavily on nectar, it is very possible that their migration is correlated with the time of flowering of flower species. For specialist hummingbird species, flowering phenology is extremely important for survival during and following fall migration. For example, the migratory route of the S. Rufus is linked to the florescence of a unique collection of flower species. S. rufus prefer S. iodantha flowers. Studies have found that the presence of S. rufus is coupled with the flowering of S. iodantha in specific locations. Time of flowering is therefore significant for the survival of S. rufus during fall migration. Similarly, peak flowering of Impatiens biflora flowers corresponds to the peak migration time of the Ruby-Throated Hummingbird. Other associations Several mite species (mainly in the genera Proctolaelaps, Tropicoseius and Rhinoseius, family Ascidae) have evolved a phoretic mode of life, climbing into the nostrils of hummingbirds that visit flowers and hitching a ride to other flowers where they can feed on the nectar. Hummingbird flower mites favour plants in the families of Heliconiaceae, Costaceae, Zingiberaceae, Amaryllidaceae, Rubiaceae, Apocynaceae, Bromeliaceae, Gesneriaceae, Lobeliaceae and Ericaceae, members of which are associated with hummingbirds.

Such referrals often happen spontaneously but businesses can influence this through appropriate strategies. Overview Referral marketing is a process to encourage and significantly increase referrals from word of mouth, perhaps the oldest and most trusted marketing strategy. This can be accomplished by encouraging and rewarding customers, and a wide variety of other contacts, to recommend products and services from consumer and B2B brands, both online and offline.Jansen, B. J., Zhang, M, Sobel, K, and Chowdury, A (2009) Twitter Power: Tweets as Electronic Word of Mouth. Journal of the American Society for Information Sciences and Technology, 60(11), 2169‚Äì2188 Online referral marketing is the internet-based, or Software as a Service (SaaS) approach, to traditional referral marketing. By tracking customer behavior online through the use of web browser cookies and similar technology, online referral marketing can potentially increase brand awareness, referrals and, ultimately, revenue. Many platforms allow organizations to see their referral marketing return on investment (ROI), and to optimize their campaigns to improve results. Many of the newest systems provide users with the same experience whether they are on a desktop or mobile device. Offline referral marketers sometimes use trackable business cards. Trackable business cards typically contain QR codes linking them to online content for sale while providing a way to track that sale back to the person whose card was scanned. Online referral marketing focuses on interactions between customers. The Internet is a common channel for referral-based marketing. It delivers abundant outlets for customers to share their opinions, product favourites, and experiences, including the company's website and through social media such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and Google+. The marketers can encourage the referring parties by providing pre-scripted messages. Advocates can provide their family members and friends with personalised links including unique referral codes and advertisement information through e-mails, blogs and instant messages. The company can give rewards to advocates when their family members and friends buy through the link. These same technologies also help companies set up a system that integrates referrals into the marketing plan. By tracking user traffic, the companies can offer referrals to other online customers. Benefits of referral programs A study conducted by the Goethe University Frankfurt and the University of Pennsylvania, on referral programs and customer value which followed the customer referral program of a German bank that paid customers 25 euros for bringing in a new customer, was released in July 2010. The study found that referred customers were both more profitable and loyal than normal customers. Referred customers had a higher contribution margin, a higher retention rate and were more valuable in both the short and long run.\\"Referral Programs and Customer Value There are two types of rewards provided by referral programs. In one option, current customers are given an incentive. The referral rewards can be in different forms, such as cash, prizes, discounts, shopping vouchers, or redeemable points. For example, mobile phone operators give a referring customer a one-time reward and add long-term savings depending on his or her individual usage. The operators also offer a lower rate for interactions between customers than for interactions with noncustomers. The second program is where the referrers benefit from existing customers by having increased visibility or recognition as a specialist or by gaining special treatment, especially if the customers become the partners of company.  Advantages  Referral-based customers are better matched. The referred customers are likely interacting with people similar to themselves. Existing customers know the purpose of marketing and understand the need for potential clients. The referrers can measure a good fit between the two and the well-matched customers can help the company produce more profits at a lower cost. The value and contribution of customers acquired through referral campaigns are higher than those of non-referred customers. Referral programs are a good method to define consumer satisfaction. If comparatively few consumers are willing to act as referrers, a company's customer satisfaction may be low. Referral programs help the company establish long-term relations with customers. The company can match motivations with consumer expectations and raise the effectiveness of market programmes. Referral reward programs can also be regarded as a tool for retaining current customers.  Disadvantages  The referral program may be abused by opportunists. They may recommend unsuitable products to other people to acquire referral fees. The financial motivation of the referring customers may harm the sincerity of their recommendations. To recognise referrers and trace purchases by referred consumers on social media, the referral programs rely heavily on a database. The precisely targeted advertising and direct mail campaigns based on the database help the company classify customers and increase the referral rate.

It became part of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, now the Co-operative Group. The SSCS came into existence in 1918 with the amalgamation of the Croydon (formed 1887), Bromley and Crays (formed 1882 and 1870) and Penge and Beckenham (formed 1879) Societies. In 1930, SSCS merged with the Reigate Industrial and Provident Society, followed by the Tonbridge Industrial Society in 1938. In May 1947, a sports centre was opened at Beckenham and in May 1949 employees were accorded full membership rights. The SSCS registered office was at 99 London Road, Croydon, Surrey, where it remained until it merged with the Co-operative Wholesale Society on 28 July 1984. Following the merger of the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society (RACS) with CWS in February 1985, administration of both the SSCS and RACS was moved to Woolwich on 6 May 1985. The London Road offices closed on 17 May 1985 and moved to 18 Blackhorse Lane, Addiscombe until later that year. Co- operative education was an important part of the SSCS philosophy and in 1920 an Education Department was formed to arrange numerous educational, cultural and social activities and events. It became very influential in both local and national co-operative educational affairs. The SSCS financially supported a local Co-operative Party Committee, which initiated and sponsored local political candidates and events. The merger with CWS saw the SSCS operating shops and services over an area of of eastern Surrey and western Kent. In its last full trading year, the SSCS had a turnover of ¬£47m, share capital of ¬£1.7m, membership of 167,000, and 1,100 staff.

They formed in Bratislava in May 1992 to combine the spirit of old school Batcave and Deathrock with new musical sounds and patterns. The name originates from a headline band member MaryO read in an American newspaper. History MaryO formed the band with Vajco on drums and Sulo, an organist. They then collected Fe≈°≈°y and Andrea, an early bass player. During 1994 this line-up recorded their first demotape and played several shows around Slovakia culminating in a support slot for Das Ich and Faith and the Muse. They continued to tour throughout 1995 including Germany with Marquee Moon and Forthcoming Fire and completed another demo tape, gaining considerable interest within the European goth scene. A few lineup changes have occurred since then and apart from bringing in a session bass player for their studio albums their current lineup continues to record and play live. The band has made many (mainly gothic) festival appearances almost every year since their formation including Wave- Gotik-Treffen five times. In 2003 and 2004 they did two mini-tours of the UK which included Beyond the Veil and Dead and Buried. Also in 2004 they were featured in a Slovak music TV show which resulted in their only live album to date.

Its name comes from its ability to bind advanced glycation endproducts (AGE), which include chiefly glycoproteins, the glycans of which have been modified non-enzymatically through the Maillard reaction. In view of its inflammatory function in innate immunity and its ability to detect a class of ligands through a common structural motif, RAGE is often referred to as a pattern recognition receptor. RAGE also has at least one other agonistic ligand: high mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1). HMGB1 is an intracellular DNA- binding protein important in chromatin remodeling which can be released by necrotic cells passively, and by active secretion from macrophages, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells. The interaction between RAGE and its ligands is thought to result in pro-inflammatory gene activation. Due to an enhanced level of RAGE ligands in diabetes or other chronic disorders, this receptor is hypothesised to have a causative effect in a range of inflammatory diseases such as diabetic complications, Alzheimer's disease and even some tumors. Isoforms of the RAGE protein, which lack the transmembrane and the signaling domain (commonly referred to as soluble RAGE or sRAGE) are hypothesized to counteract the detrimental action of the full-length receptor and are hoped to provide a means to develop a cure against RAGE-associated diseases.  Gene and polymorphisms  The RAGE gene lies within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC class III region) on chromosome 6 and comprises 11 exons interlaced by 10 introns. Total length of the gene is about 1400 base pairs (bp) including the promoter region, which partly overlaps with the PBX2 gene. About 30 polymorphisms are known most of which are single- nucleotide polymorphisms.  RNA and alternative splicing  The primary transcript of the human RAGE gene (pre-mRNA) is thought to be alternatively spliced. So far about 6 isoforms including the full length transmembrane receptor have been found in different tissues such as lung, kidney, brain etc. Five of these 6 isoforms lack the transmembrane domain and are thus believed to be secreted from cells. Generally these isoforms are referred to as sRAGE (soluble RAGE) or esRAGE (endogenous secretory RAGE). One of the isoforms lacks the V-domain and is thus believed not to be able to bind RAGE ligands.  Structure  RAGE exists in the body in two forms: a membrane-bound form known as mRAGE, and a soluble form, known as sRAGE. mRAGE has three domains, and sRAGE has only the extracellular domain. sRAGE is either the product of alternative splicing or the product of proteolytic cleavage of mRAGE. The full receptor consists of the following domains: The cytosolic domain, which is responsible for signal transduction, the transmembrane domain which anchors the receptor in the cell membrane, the variable domain which binds the RAGE ligands, and two constant domains.  Ligands  RAGE is able to bind several ligands and therefore is referred to as a pattern-recognition receptor. Ligands which have so far been found to bind RAGE are: *AGE *HMGB1 (Amphoterin) *S100A12 (EN-RAGE) *S100B *S100A7 (psoriasin) but not highly homologous S100A15 (koebnerisin) *S100P *S100A8/A9 complex referred to as calprotectin *Amyloid-Œ≤-protein *Mac-1 *Phosphatidylserine. *S100A4  RAGE and disease  RAGE has been linked to several chronic diseases, which are thought to result from vascular damage. The pathogenesis is hypothesized to include ligand binding, upon which RAGE signals activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-Œ∫B). NF-Œ∫B controls several genes involved in inflammation. RAGE itself is upregulated by NF-Œ∫B. Given a condition in which there is a large amount of RAGE ligands (e.g. AGE in diabetes or amyloid-Œ≤-protein in Alzheimer's disease) this establishes a positive feed-back cycle, which leads to chronic inflammation. This chronic condition is then believed to alter the micro- and macrovasculature, resulting in organ damage or even organ failure. However, whilst RAGE is up-regulated in inflammatory conditions, it is down- regulated in lung cancer and pulmonary fibrosis. Diseases that have been linked to RAGE are: *Alzheimer's disease *Arthritis *Atherosclerosis *Congestive heart failure *Congenital diaphragmatic hernia *Diabetes *Myocardial infarction *Peripheral vascular disease *Psoriasis *Rheumatoid arthritis *Takayasu's arteritis RAGE is expressed at the highest levels in the lung compared to other tissues, in particular in alveolar type I cells, and is lost in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) indicating that expression and regulation of RAGE in the pulmonary system differs from that in the vascular system. Blockade/knockdown of RAGE resulted in impaired cell adhesion, and increased cell proliferation and migration  Inhibitors  A number of small molecule RAGE inhibitors or antagonists have been reported. ;Azeliragon: vTv Therapeutics (formerly TransTech Pharma) sponsored a Phase 3 clinical trial of their RAGE inhibitor Azeliragon (TTP488) for mild Alzheimer's disease. These trials were halted in 2018.vTv Halts Trials of Alzheimer's Candidate Azeliragon after Phase III Failure Apr 2018  AGE receptors  Besides RAGE there are other receptors which are believed to bind advanced glycation endproducts. However, these receptors could play a role in the removal of AGE rather than in signal transduction as is the case for RAGE. Other AGE receptors are: *SR-A (Macrophage scavenger receptor Type I and II) *OST-48 (Oligosaccharyl transferase-4) (AGE-R1) *80 K-H phosphoprotein (Proteinkinase C substrate) (AGE-R2) *Galectin-3 (AGE-R3) *LOX-1 (Lectin-like oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor-1) *CD36  References   Further reading    External links  AGER on the Atlas of Genetics and Oncology Receptors ","title":"RAGE (receptor)"},{"id":"4992646","text":"Birdy is the debut novel of William Wharton, who was more than 50 years old when it was published.

The towns native population are of Igbo ethnicity. History Spirit masquerade in Amankwo Ngwo. Ngwo people descended from the man called Ngwu-Ako who lived at a place now called \\"Isi Okpoto\\" the present day St. Mary Catholic Church and its environs with his wife. Ngwu-Ako gave it the name \\"Okpotokpo\\" literally in English (large) because the fruits and trees that grew there were of very large sizes and shapes. That is, for him, they were \\"okpotokpo\\" (very large/huge). Living there with his wife, they begot their ten (10) male children who eventually metamorphosed into the ten villages of Ngwo, namely: Uboji, Amankwo, Ameke, Ukaka, Enugu, Etiti, Amachala, Amaebo, Okwojo, and Umuase. While the first three (3) got settled at a place now called Ngwo-uno, the last seven (7) settled at a place also now called Ngwo-asaa. That accounts for the two (2) big shades/components of Ngwo, namely: (Ngwo-uno) and Ngwo-asaa (Ngwo-egu). While Ngwo-uno is made up of three main villages, namely: Amankwo, Ameke, and Uboji, Ngwo-asaa is composed of seven villages, viz: Enugu, Etiti, Amachala, Ukaka, Amaebo, Okwojo, and Umuase. Geography Ngwo is the only town in Nigeria that is in three Local Government Areas. Those Local Government Areas include: Udi, Enugu North and Enugu South Local Government Areas. This has been so, either for political reasons or for Ngwo being critical, as a major landlord, to the commercial nerve centres of those Local Government Areas, namely: Ninth Mile Corner and Enugu township. Geographically, Ngwo is bounded to the north by Abor, to the south by Nsude, to the west by Ek√©, and to the east by Nik√©. Ngwo remains a historically important place in Enugu state. Ngwo is a hilly area, with much of the land area being up to 600 meters above sea level. The hills are moderately sloping and undulating. Development is fast enveloping Ngwo town considering the high spate of commercial activities both at Enugu township and Ninth mile Corner, Ngwo. Governance The first \\"Okpoto\\" (High chief) of Ngwo was Chief Donald Nnadi Oji, brought in by British colonialism.The second \\"Okpoto\\" of Ngwo was Chief Josiah O. Agu. Ameke Ngwo is one of the ten formative villages of Ngwo, which, in 2001, was upgraded to the status of an Autonomous Community by the Enugu State Government which gave rise to the establishment of the position of the traditional ruler, called the Igwe. Igwe Jerome Charles Okolo, ‚ÄòOgwugwuebenebe XXI‚Äô, of Ameke Ngwo, became the first holder of this position having been unanimously elected by the entire community in October 2003. His coronation was one of those huge community-wide festivals, for which the Igbo people of Eastern Nigeria are renowned. The ever impressive Ijele Masquerade ‚Äì the king of Igbo masquerades, a multi-storey towering ensemble of carvings, masks and fabrics - made one of its very rare outings to grace the occasion, which was held on the football grounds of the local community primary school. (The creation of the so-called autonomous communities is sowing the seeds of disunity within the greater Ngwo community; instead of just one 'Okpoto of Ngwo', we now have Igwe of Ameke, Igwe of Uboji, Igwe of Amankwo, Ama of Ime- Ama (Okwojo), and the Esa of Ngwo Asa, making a total number of 5 Igwes in Ngwo Clan. At this rate, we may end up with over ten (10) mushroom 'igwe's or petit chiefs - the end result will be the loss of the real meaning of any of these titles. Uboji is the first son of Ngwo, and Amokwe is the first son of Uboji, Amokwe-uwani; the ehums; aborigines hold the owhor, the staff and give interpretation to tradition and traditional practices, the present traditional ruler of uboji, Igwe Engr Basil Chibunine Ugwuozor was chosen based on this progenital fact. On issues of controversies in Ngwo, such issues are resolved by reaching the Ndinka (council of elders) Amokwe-uwani. The immediate past owhor holder, was Pa Jacob Ani Mba, he died at the age of 106 years. A successor will be announced after one year of his death. Next to Pa Jacob Mba is Pa Michael Onyia followed by Elder Elias O Ugwuozor, who also is the first surviving son of late pa Mark Ugwuozor; one of the first people to embrace Christianity in Ngwo.

Commonly a country's second city is the city that is thought to be the second-most important, usually after the capital or first city according to criteria such as population size, economic importance and cultural contribution. The UK, in urban geography terms, has been classified as adhering to the primate city rule, meaning that the largest city in the nation outweighs every other city by orders of magnitude, London, the UK's capital, is by far the largest city, leaving other cities to be closer in prominence having been outshone by London, hence the competition for the 'Second City' of the UK is a rather subjective debate. Historically several cities have been considered the \\"second city of the British Empire\\". In the early 19th century, Dublin was considered by many to be the second city; later in the century, Glasgow and Liverpool burgeoned as major industrial centres and had competing claims to be the busiest ports in the world for ship building and freight transport. Calcutta also laid the claim from as far away as India as the most populous city, while in 1911 the editor of the Irish Times laid a second claim for Dublin during a ceremonial visit by George V. Birmingham has generally been regarded as the second city of the United Kingdom in terms of populace and GDP while Edinburgh has been promoted as the second city by virtue as the capital of Scotland.The New York Times, 6 August 1989: \\"Edinburgh's castle high on the rock has looked down on many a triumph and tragedy in the proud Scots capital, but every year since 1947, Britain's Second City steals the spotlight from London during the three weeks of the international festival.\\" Less authoritative claims have been made on behalf of Cardiff and Belfast due to their status as the respective capital cities of Wales and Northern Ireland. Furthermore, a number of opinion polls have been conducted since 2000 and complicate the issue further, with public response showing a consistent view amongst the British population that Manchester is the second city. History Since the formation of the United Kingdom, several places have been described as the \\"second city\\". Aristocrat-dominated Georgian Dublin was the second-most populous city at the time of the formation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801 (it was also the fifth-most populous in Europe), and was often described as the second city of the UK.Sidney Edwards Morse and Jedidiah Morse, A New System of Geography, Ancient and Modern, p.177, 1824 Though it lost that position towards the end of the 19th century as the empire's Victorian cities grew through more rapid industrialisation.BBC: \\"A Short History of Ireland\\" ‚Äì \\"The population, which had been 58,000 in 1683, was close to 129,000 by 1772 and 182,000 including the garrison by 1798, making Dublin the second largest city in the British Empire.\\" Dublin, and the rest of what would become after partition the Republic of Ireland, became independent of the UK in the 1920s. Later, the title Second City of Empire or Second City of the British Empire was claimed by a number of cities in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. Commercial trading city Liverpool was regarded as holding this title with its massive port, merchant fleet and world-wide trading links. Liverpool University: \\"... the city's pre-eminent position at the turn of the 19th century resulted from the port's willingness to handle a very wide range of cargo (including millions of migrants to the new world). Liverpool was second only to London in this respect ‚Äì and this, together with its great ethnic diversity, was the basis of its claim to being the 'second city of empire'.\\" Liverpool was constantly referred to as the New York of Europe. Others included Dublin,\\"When you remember that Dublin has been a capital for thousands of years, that it is the second city of the British Empire, that it is nearly three times as big as Venice it seems strange that no artist has given it to the world.\\" James Joyce, Letter to Stanislaus Joyce, c. 24 September 1905 (Letters of James Joyce, vol.

Prior to the union with Scotland in 1707, from the English Civil War until the 18th century, Norwich was the second- largest city of the Kingdom of England, being a major trading centre, Britain's richest provincial city and county town of Norfolk, at that time the most populous county of England. Bristol was the second-wealthiest city in England in the 16th century;J. E. T. and A. G. L. Rogers, A History of Agriculture and Prices in England, p.82, 1887 and by the 18th century, Bristol was often described as the second city of England.Charles Knight, The Popular History of England, p.8, 1859 During the 19th century, claims were made for Manchester,Robert Southey, Letters from England, p.177, 1836 LiverpoolJames Richard Joy, An Outline History of England, p.26, 1890 and York.John Major, Aeneas James George Mackay and Thomas Graves Law, A History of Greater Britain as Well England as Scotland, p.xxxvi, 1892 York had also been named as the second city in earlier centuries.John Macky, A Journey Through England, p.208, 1722 By the early 19th century, Glasgow was frequently referred to as the second city;For example, see T. H. B. Oldfield, The Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland, p.566, 1816 or Spencer Walpole, A History of England from the Conclusion of the Great War in 1815, p.103, 1878 and during much of the 20th century it had a population of over one million, larger than that of Birmingham until the 1951 census. For example, the Official Census population for Glasgow was 0.784 million in April 1911; 1.034 million in April 1921; 1.088 million in April 1931 and 1.090 million in April 1951.Roberson, D. J. (1958). \\"Population, Past and Present\\". Chapter 2 in: Cunnison, J. and Gilfillan, J. B. S. (1958). The Third Statistical Account of Scotland, Volume V. The City of Glasgow. Glasgow: William Collins Sons & Co. Ltd. However, slum clearance in the 1960s led to displacement of residents from the city centre to new communities located outside the city boundaries. This, together with local government reorganisation, resulted in the official population of Glasgow falling sharply. The Glasgow City Council area currently has a population of 600,000 although the surrounding conurbation of Greater Glasgow has a population of 1,199,629. In contrast, the population of the city of Birmingham has remained steady around the one million mark; its central population fell like Glasgow's, but the city boundaries were extended several times in the early 20th century. Occasional claims were made for Liverpool,D. Appleton, Appletons' American Standard Geographies, p.130, 1881. BirminghamW. Stewart & Co., The Journal of Education, p.38, 1867. and Manchester.Chetham Society, Remains, Historical and Literary, Connected with the Palatine Counties of Lancashire and Chester, 1862, p.531. Modern points of view Since World War I, and up to the beginning of the 21st century, Birmingham had been considered by many to be the second city. Based on population within actual city boundaries the City of Birmingham, the most populous local government district in Europe, is substantially larger than the City of Manchester, which is the fifth largest in the UK (2006 estimates, see List of English districts by population). However, most sources do not use formal city boundaries as the sole criterion for population comparison. The surrounding conurbations and the areas that can be considered informally part of each city are hard to define. However, after the 1974 reorganisation of local government and the creation of metropolitan counties, the City of Birmingham was included with the City of Coventry and five other metropolitan boroughs (one, Wolverhampton gained city status in 2000) in a new West Midlands county. The City of Manchester joined with the neighbouring City of Salford and eight other Metropolitan boroughs within the County of Greater Manchester. While the second city status of any country is decided upon a variety of economic or cultural indices, both Birmingham and Manchester have shown an edge in each over the years. For example, in 2010, Manchester City Centre became second to London for new office building take-up with almost a million square foot (86,400 m2) occupied in the year, whilst praise for Birmingham's striking modern architecture was cited as confirmation of its claim to second city status.Birmingham: Britain‚Äôs second city  EuroCheapo's Travel Tips =Public opinion polls= As the Second City is an unofficial title and one of subjective opinion, a number of polls have been conducted over the years. Despite Birmingham being viewed as the traditional second city, public polls have shown a consistent preference for Manchester since 2000. This shift has been attributed to Manchester's and the wider Greater Manchester region's rebranding of itself, most notably after the 1996 Manchester bombing and the successful hosting of the 2002 Commonwealth Games: *A 2002 survey conducted by Ipsos MORI, commissioned by \\"Visit Manchester\\" (Manchester's tourism department), Manchester received the highest response for the category of second city at 34%, compared to Birmingham at 29%; and in the same poll, Manchester had the highest response for the category of third city with 27% of the vote, 6% more than the 21% for Birmingham. 85% of respondents put London as first City. *A 2007 survey conducted by GfK commissioned by the BBC in December 2006 investigating the subject of the \\"'Second city' of England\\" (as opposed to the UK as a whole), 48% of 1,000 people placed Manchester, with 40% choosing Birmingham. *A 2015 survey by YouGov showed that 30% thought Manchester was the second city, 20% thought Birmingham and 12% thought Edinburgh. *A 2017 survey by BMG Research, commissioned by the Birmingham Mail, showed 38% preferred Manchester as the second city versus 36% for Birmingham. 16% choose Edinburgh with 10% for other cities. The opinion poll also found a stark generational divide with 44% of 18 to 24 year olds choosing Manchester as their preferred second city compared with only 19% who stated Birmingham and 25% of this age group also selecting Edinburgh over Birmingham. However, of those 65 and older, 40% preferred Birmingham and 38% preferred Manchester. =Ministerial statements= There have been a variety of Ministerial statements and opinions on the subject for some time. These include: * In February 2015 UK Prime Minister David Cameron stated \\"Birmingham is Britain‚Äôs second city, it is a powerhouse.\\" On 16 February 2016 he emphasised that \\"We recognise Birmingham‚Äôs status as Britain‚Äôs second city\\". He repeated this claim on 16 March 2016 when he stated \\"Birmingham is the second city of our country\\" during Prime Minister's Questions. * David Miliband, the former Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and former Shadow Foreign Secretary said \\"However, if you look at Birmingham, I think a lot of people would say that it's a city, Britain's second city...\\" * Digby Jones, Baron Jones of Birmingham (born and raised in Birmingham), former Minister of State at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Foreign Office (former Director-General of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said \\"Birmingham is naturally the second-most important city in Britain after London because of where she is and how important she is as part of that crossroads,\\". Jones later said \\"As a Brummie it's not easy to say, but I can find no better place than the north west in terms of having a diverse manufacturing base, whether it's engineering manufacturing at Rolls-Royce, automotive manufacturing at Bentley or pharmaceuticals manufacturing at AstraZeneca.\\" which contradicts what he said about Birmingham being the most important base outside London. He also praised \\"Manchester's 'first-class global' university, knowledge and transport infrastructure were the two key factors that determined the success of a city or region.\\" In 2011, Jones stated that Birmingham is now in danger of losing its unofficial title to ManchesterLeading Article: Second Best, www.independent.co.uk. accessed 18 May 2011 * John Prescott (born in Wales and raised in Cheshire), former Deputy Prime Minister and Member of Parliament for the constituency of Kingston upon Hull East, was also quoted as saying \\"Manchester ‚Äì our second city\\", but this was later played down by his department, claiming they were made in a \\"light-hearted context\\". * Graham Stringer (born and raised in and currently representing Manchester), MP for Blackley and Broughton, responded with \\"Manchester has always been the second city after the capital, in many ways it is the first. Birmingham has never really been in the competition.\\" * Sandra White (born and raised in and representing Glasgow), a Scottish National Party MSP for Glasgow, claimed \\"Glasgow was always seen as the second city in the Empire, and Glasgow is still the second British city. Manchester is probably the second city in England after London.\\" * Phil Woolas (born in Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, living in Lees, Greater Manchester and representing the constituency of Oldham East and Saddleworth), Former Minister of State for the Environment ‚Äì \\"And, of course, I, and colleagues in Manchester, am pleased to see its very sensible plans to relocate to Manchester ‚Äì Britain's third city.\\" See also *List of city nicknames in the United Kingdom *List of towns and cities in England by historical population References Cities in the United Kingdom Culture in Belfast Culture in Birmingham, West Midlands Culture in Bristol Culture in Cardiff Culture in Edinburgh Culture in Glasgow Culture in Leeds Culture in Liverpool Culture in Manchester ","title":"Second city of the United Kingdom"},{"id":"4992694","text":"Mapping Agency Chart 'Nell Island (Marshallese: ', \\"Place Names of the Marshal Islands: Atolls & Islands: K.\\" 3 September 2010. Retrieved 19 April 2011.) is part of Kwajalein Atoll in the Ralik Chain in the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), 2,100 nautical miles (3900 km) southwest of Honolulu, Hawaii. It lies at a convergence of deep, narrow, protected channels and small islands. This area was the traditional seat of power for the Iroij (High Chiefs) at Kwajalein, prior to foreign occupation and population displacement. Nel(N≈çl) is part of a group of four islands ‚Äì including Enmaat, Pikon-N≈çl and Anƒì-Ruo ‚Äì with special historical importance in Marshallese culture. Marshallese consider these islands some of the most sacred or \\"mo\\" (tabu) islands in Kwajalein Atoll. Enmaat was the residence of the high chiefs' families. Traditional Marshallese cultural leadership and land-ownership for these islands resides with the Kabua family. According to Ato Langio, a Marshallese elder, the area just inside Enmaat ‚Äì protected by Enmaat, Anƒì-ruo, N≈çl and Pikon-N≈çl ‚Äì is one of the most protected canoe anchorages in the atoll. Early Marshallese cultures relied heavily on their expert navigation skills, their skill in building and sailing the large (up to 100') ocean-going outrigger canoes known as Proa and on the unique Marshall Islands stick chart as a means of navigational documentation. The Nel area was called \\"mien wa\\" (sheltered haven for canoes for the chief), and protected by \\"Limejwa\\", a Marshallese idol. With wistful sadness modern day Marshallese relate how children could cross the channel with immunity protected by \\"Limejwa\\" using coconuts for flotation. Pacific cultures anthropologist Dr. Larry Carucci did extensive research on the cultural significance of sites in Kwajalein Atoll. He explains that the Nel area is especially significant because the Iroij and Leiroj lived there and also because the island of Anƒì-ruo was \\"uliej\\", the graveyard or cemetery of high chiefs. To this day, out of respect and a sense of \\"mo\\" many Marshallese transiting the area stop across the channel from N≈çl ‚Äì on Enmaat ‚Äì and do not make landfall on N≈çl. These islands fall within the \\"mid-atoll corridor\\" which was evacuated in 1965 to establish a safe area for ICBM testing (NIke X program) when Kwajalein Atoll was part of the United Nations Trust Territories. The residents were moved to Ebeye where they remain up to this day under terms of a Compact of Free Association. There's confusion within the non-native population at Kwajalein regarding just which island here is Nel. Many refer to the group of four islands ‚Äì Nel, Enmaat, Pikon-N≈çl, Ane- ruo ‚Äì as Nel. Nel Island is the larger, longer island east of the chiefs' island and Nel Pass, but recent residents of the Atoll have come to refer to the smaller Anƒì-Ruo(Enero) island as Nel. This small (1/8 x 1/4 mi) island ‚Äì the \\"king's island\\" ‚Äì lies lagoon-side of Enmaat and west of Nel Pass. This is the \\"Nell\\" that is destination for many current visitors to the area while Nel itself is the much larger (1/8 x 3.5 mi) island east of Nel pass.

The title MicroMega is probably inspired by a tale by Voltaire. History and profile MicroMega was founded in March 1986 by the editors Giorgio Ruffolo and Paolo Flores d'Arcais. The magazine is published by the GEDI Gruppo Editoriale and is based in Rome. Its editor is Paolo Flores d'Arcais. During the first years, the magazine had a subtitle: \\"le ragioni della sinistra\\" (\\"the reasons of the Left\\"). Later this subtitle was removed. Each number has now a different title, inspired by a discussion theme. Given its format, which includes long essays and articles, the journal tends to cater to an intellectual elite. Journalist Marco Travaglio is one of its better known contributors. Many philosophers, social scientists and men and women of science and other leading figures have written on this paper, including Massimo Cacciari, Joseph Ratzinger, Bruno Forte, Michele Santoro, Gianni Vattimo, Leszek Ko≈Çakowski, Marcel Gauchet, Margherita Hack and Walter Veltroni. The magazine was issued monthly from 20 February to 20 April 2006, then weekly (over an eight-week period) during the 2006 Italian political campaign. In this time, it was issued with the title La primavera di MicroMega. In 2007, the magazine returned to the original bimonthly format. MicroMega has an average circulation of 25,000/30,000 copies. In 2006, some issues sold more than 100,000 copies. On 8 July 2008, MicroMega organised a rally against Silvio Berlusconi's attempt to limit the power of the judiciary by getting parliament to pass a law that granted individuals occupying the four highest offices of the land (retroactive) immunity from prosecution during their mandate: they are the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Speaker of the House of Deputies and the Speaker of the Senate. As prime minister, Berlusconi is thus be protected from prosecution until he leaves office. Roughly 100,000 people gathered in Rome's Piazza Navona to express their indignation at the new law and in defence of democracy. In 2009 that law was judged unconstitutional and repealed by the Constitutional Court.

It shows that even though the question of safety is in general undecidable, for specific systems it is decidable in linear time. The model represents a system as directed graph, where vertices are either subjects or objects. The edges between them are labeled and the label indicates the rights that the source of the edge has over the destination. Two rights occur in every instance of the model: take and grant. They play a special role in the graph rewriting rules describing admissible changes of the graph. There are a total of four such rules: * take rule allows a subject to take rights of another object (add an edge originating at the subject) * grant rule allows a subject to grant own rights to another object (add an edge terminating at the subject) * create rule allows a subject to create new objects (add a vertex and an edge from the subject to the new vertex) * remove rule allows a subject to remove rights it has over on another object (remove an edge originating at the subject) Preconditions for take(o,p,r): * subject s has the right Take for o. * object o has the right r on p.

Distribution and habitat In the 19th century, swamp deer ranged along the base of the Himalayas from Upper Assam to the west of the Jumna River, throughout Assam, in a few places in the Indo-Gangetic plain from the Eastern Sundarbans to Upper Sind, and locally throughout the area between the Ganges and Godavari as far east as Mandla. Swamp deer was also common in parts of the Upper Nerbudda valley and to the south in Bastar. They frequent flat or undulating grasslands and generally keep in the outskirts of forests. Sometimes, they are also found in open forest. In the 1960s, the total population was estimated at 1,600 to less than 2,150 individuals in India and about 1,600 in Nepal. Today, the distribution is much reduced and fragmented due to major losses in the 1930s‚Äì1960s following unregulated hunting and conversion of large tracts of grassland to cropland. Swamp deer occur in the Kanha National Park of Madhya Pradesh, in two localities in Assam, and in only 6 localities in Uttar Pradesh. They are regionally extinct in West Bengal. They are also probably extinct in Arunachal Pradesh.Choudhury, A. U. (2003). The mammals of Arunachal Pradesh. Regency Publications, New Delhi .

After a census conducted in 2016, 1148 individuals were estimated in the park.  Ecology and behaviour  Swamp deer are mainly grazers. They largely feed on grasses and aquatic plants, foremost on Saccharum, Imperata cylindrica, Narenga porphyrocoma, Phragmites karka, Oryza rufipogon, Hygroryza and Hydrilla. They feed throughout the day with peaks during the mornings and late afternoons to evenings. In winter and monsoon, they drink water twice, and thrice or more in summer. In the hot season, they rest in the shade of trees during the day. In central India, the herds comprise on average about 8‚Äì20 individuals, with large herds of up to 60. There are twice as many females than males. During the rut they form large herds of adults. The breeding season lasts from September to April, and births occur after a gestation of 240‚Äì250 days in August to November. The peak is in September and October in Kanha National Park.Schaller, G. B. (1967). The Deer and the Tiger ‚Äì A Study of Wildlife in India. University Chicago Press, Chicago, IL, USA. They give birth to single calves. When alarmed, they give out shrill, baying alarm calls. Captive specimens live up to 23 years.  Threats  Illustration of barasingha antler The swamp deer populations outside protected areas and seasonally migrating populations are threatened by poaching for antlers and meat, which are sold in local markets. Swamp deer lost most of its former range because wetlands were converted and used for agriculture so that suitable habitat was reduced to small and isolated fragments. The remaining habitat in protected areas is threatened by the change in river dynamics, reduced water flow during summer, increasing siltation, and is further degraded by local people who cut grass, timber and fuelwood, and by illegal farming on government land. George Schaller wrote: \\"Most of these remnants have or soon will have reached the point of no return.\\"  Conservation  Rucervus duvaucelii is listed on CITES Appendix I. In India, it is included under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. = In captivity = In 1992, there were about 50 individuals in five Indian zoos and 300 in various zoos in North America and Europe. Swamp deer were introduced to Texas.McCarthy, A., Blouch, R., Moore, D., and Wemmer, C. M. (1998). Deer: status survey and conservation action plan IUCN Deer Specialist Group. IUCN, Gland, Switzerland. They exist only in small numbers on ranches. Sport hunters for whom bagging a stag with huge antlers with as many points as possible is a novelty, pay about $4,000 as trophy fees for hunting a swamp deer.  In culture  Rudyard Kipling in The Second Jungle Book featured a barasingha in the chapter \\"The Miracle of Purun Bhagat\\" by the name of \\"barasingh\\". It befriends Purun Bhagat because the man rubs the stag's velvet off his horns. Purun Bhagat then gives the barasinga nights in the shrine at which he is staying, with his warm fire, along with a few fresh chestnuts every now and then. Later as pay, the stag warns Purun Bhagat and his town about how the mountain on which they live is crumbling. Barasingha is the state animal of the Indian states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

Astronauts on the International Space Station use foot straps to stand in place at workstations or on exercise equipment.https://www.businessinsider.com/scott-kelly-weirdest-thing-year-in- space-2016-2 Use in science fiction Although many science fiction works assume some type of artificial gravity or use rotation to \\"create\\" gravity, magnetic boots still feature for purposes of exterior repairs or in emergency situations. Magnetic boots were notably used in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country to stage a surprise attack by disabling the artificial gravity on a ship and so providing a tactical advantage to attackers wearing them. The investigation of who had access to magnetic boots featured prominently in the plot. Other Star Trek depictions include Star Trek: First Contact where the crew battle cyborgs on the hull of the ship and Star Trek: Enterprise where they are used for hull repairs. Such boots were featured in The Adventures of Tintin comic Explorers on the Moon, to prevent the characters from floating around in the cabin if the artificial gravity failed. The Celestial Voyages historical science fiction series by Jeff Provine uses magnetic boots as the main sense of balance in its Edwardian starships. In the Ratchet & Clank series, one of the gadgets is a pair of \\"Magneboots\\", which are used to traverse special ventilation shafts in the first installment of the series Ratchet & Clank. Though in Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando and later, the Magneboots were replaced with the Gravity Boots, allowing one to walk up special vents and surfaces, to jump and walk like normal, and also to use weapons and other gadgets. In 2010: Odyssey Two, it is stated that Soviets view artificial gravity as a luxury, and as such their vessel the Alexi Leonov features very limited artificial gravity. The crew uses magnetic shoes to easily walk around the ship. Magnetic shoes are a running theme of the series and are used by crews of small Pan Am shuttles as well. In the novel and television series The Expanse, characters frequently use magnetized boots to keep themselves upright when not using thrust acceleration to simulate gravity.

He represented Lincoln in the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal member from 1868 to 1874. He was born in Mayville, New York in 1824, the son of William Hamilton Merritt. He studied at Upper Canada College and Grantham Academy in St. Catharines. In 1839, he was working at a store in St. Catharines. In 1843, he opened a general store there in partnership with James Rea Benson. The partners bought flour mills and had two ships built to transport flour. The partnership split up in 1849 and Merritt kept the mills and ships. In 1850, he set up a shipping line that transported goods to Brantford and returned to St. Catharines with wheat. In 1853, he married Mary Benson, the daughter of his former partner's brother Thomas Benson . Merritt served on the St. Catharines town council from 1857 to 1859. He was elected in an 1868 by-election to represent Lincoln in the House of Commons and was reelected in 1872. In 1869, his mills and ships were sold to the firm of Norris and Neelon. Merritt served as vice-president of the Niagara District Bank and became vice-president of the Imperial Bank of Canada after the two banks merged. He was also president of several companies in the area, including the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge Company and the St Catharines Gas Light Company. He retired from politics in 1874. He helped found Bishop Ridley College at St. Catharines and served as president from 1888 to 1899. He died in St. Catharines in 1906. His former home, Rodman Hall, now serves as an art gallery.

Agni the Hindu deity of fire, has a very prominent place among Rigvedic deities. Worship or deification of fire (also pyrodulia, pyrolatry or pyrolatria) is known from various religions. Fire has been an important part of human culture since the Lower Paleolithic. The earliest known traces of controlled fire were found at the Daughters of Jacob Bridge, Israel, and dated to 790,000 years ago. Religious or animist notions connected to fire are assumed to reach back to such early pre-Homo sapiens times. Indo-European religions In Indo-European languages, there were two concepts regarding fire: that of an animate type called *egni- (cf. Sanskrit agni English ignite from Latin ignis, and Russian ogon), and an inanimate type *paewr- (cf. English - fire, Greek pyr, Sanskrit pu). A similar distinction existed for water. Archaeologically, the earliest evidence for Indo-Iranian fire worship is found at the transition from the Sintashta-Petrovka to the Andronovo culture around 1500 BC, together with first evidence of cremation. While cremation became ubiquitous in Hinduism, it came to be disavowed in Zoroastrianism. However, even earlier evidences of vedic fire altars have been found at the Indus Valley sites of Kalibangan and Lothal, giving rise to speculations toward earlier assumed the geographical location of the early Indo-Iranians. Although the term \\"fire-worshippers\\" is primarily associated with Zoroastrians, the idea that Zoroastrians worship fire is originally from anti-Zoroastrian polemic. Instead, fire--even in a fire temple (the Zoroastrian terms are more prosaic and simply mean \\"house of fire\\")--is considered to be an agent of purity and as a symbol of righteousness and truth. In the present day this is explained to be because fire burns ever- upward and cannot itself be polluted. Nonetheless, Sadeh and Chaharshanbe Suri are both fire-related festivals celebrated throughout Greater Iran and date back to when Zoroastrianism was still the predominant religion of the region. In Vedic disciplines of Hinduism, fire is a central element in the Yajna ceremony, with Agni, \\"fire\\", playing the role as mediator between the worshipper and the other gods. Related concepts are the Agnihotra ritual, the invocation of the healing properties of fire; the Agnicayana ritual, which is the building of a fire altar to Agni; and Agnistoma, which is one of the seven Somayajnas. In the Vaishnav branch of Hinduism, Agni or Fire is considered the tongue of the Supreme Lord Narayana, hence all the sacrifices done even to any demigod ultimately is a sacrifice to the Supreme Lord Narayana. In Albanian mythology the deification of fire is associated with En or Enji, a fire deity firstly worshiped by the Illyrians whose name continues to be used in the Albanian language to refer to Thursday (enjte). Fire worship in Graeco-Roman tradition had two separate forms: fire of the hearth and fire of the forge. Hearth worship was maintained in Rome by the Vestal Virgins, who served the goddess Vesta, protector of the home, who had a sacred flame as the symbol of her presence in the city (cf. Sacred fire of Vesta). The Greek equivalent of the goddess was Hestia, whose worship took place more commonly within the household. The fire of the forge was associated with the Greek god Hephaestus and the Roman equivalent Vulcan. These two seem to have served both as craft- guild patrons and as protectors against accidental fires in cities. Also associated with fire is the titanic god Prometheus, who stole fire for humans from the gods. Most forms of worship in Graeco-Roman religion involved either cooking or burning completely an animal on a fire made on an altar in front of a temple (see hecatomb). Celtic mythology had Belenus, whose name, \\"shining one\\", associated him with fire. In Slavic mythology, Svarog, meaning \\"bright and clear\\", was the spirit of fire. The best known and dramatic among numerous Slavic Pagan fire rituals is the jumping over the bonfire on the Ivan Kupala Day. Semitic religions Fire is an element of theophany in the Hebrew Bible's burning bush, pillar of fire, and the flame of the Menorah. The highest form of sacrifice was the Korban Olah, performed twice-daily, which is an animal sacrifice completely consumed by fire. Islam on the other hand has no rituals associated with fire and burning. The Quran describes the devil as a creature of fire. The devil's rejection and contempt toward humans originate from the devil's perception that fire is superior to mud. This sentiment was the cause of the devil's banishment from the heavens. Other religions Fire continues to be a part of many human religions and cultures. For example, it is used in cremation and bonfires; candles are used in various religious ceremonies; eternal flames are used to remind of notable occasions; and the Olympic Flame burns for the duration of the games. The Holy Fire in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem has been consecutively documented since 1106 AD. In Japanese mythology, Kagu-tsuchi, is the god of destructive fire.

It is one of three watermills in Luxembourg with the same name. It marks the southern limit of the Dumontshaff Project at Dumontshaff/Dumontshof which converted a stretch of the upper Alzette into a nature reserve. The area is rich in wildlife, especially waterbirds. There has been a mill at the same site since at least the twelfth century when, along with Esch, Mittendal and Bergem it formed part of the parish (forerunner of the Commune) of Schifflange. Existing buildings date from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, with further alterations in the 20th and 21st centuries. 1530: Johanna de Mercy built the moated castle of Mittendal at Bergem, to which the rights over the Lamescher Mill belonged. 1664: A stone bearing this date was found in the millers cottage. 1700: Marie- Marguerite Bosch (Widow Gennetais) and Ludwina Petronella Bosch (Widow Stassin), let Lameschm√ºhle to Jean Eydt and Marguerite Berchem. 1712: Lease signed between Ludwina Petronella de Bosch and Paul Schweich, husband of Ludwina Petronella Eydt. 1719: Paul Schweich marries Johanna Nicholas. 1723: Paul Schweich marries Catherine Calmes. 1731: Marie-Marguerite de Stassin (Widow Bost-Moulin) lets Lameschm√ºhle to Nicolas Kribs of Huncherange. 1743: Wilhelm Franck of the Lamescher M√ºhle marries Anna Helena Reuter of Altwies. 1759: Countess de Chanclos leases the mill to Theodore Franck, son of Guillaume Franck and Madeleine Krips. 1765: Anna Franck of the Lameschm√ºhle marries Nicholas Zeller of Budersberg. 1766: The Land Registry of the Empress Maria Theresa lists Theodore Franck as the Miller. 1768: Stable building erected. 1776: A door lintel of this date found in the Miller's cottage, with T. FA - 17 ihs 76 O. C.? inscribed. By this time the Franck family owned the Mill outright. 1820: Bastien Klensch of Bergem and Krips of the Udinger Mill take the Miller Michel Franck, son of Theodore Franck, to court, because Franck had raised the level of his waterwheel and the depth of the mill-race. It was decided that the mill-race should be lowered by 47 inches along its entire length. A sluice must be put back in the mill-race. This must be open for at least a full day to clean the by-flow, and for other specified reasons. It was forbidden to obstruct the race or the sluice. On the first Sunday of each January, April, July and October all the sluices must be open all day. In September the mill-race and canal must be thoroughly cleaned. 1824: The land register names the Widow of Michel Franck as owner. 1876: A new mill building was built (the door lintel was dated and initialled MP 1881 ML) with a turbine underneath. 1904: The owner was Peter M√ºller. 1922: New living quarters constructed between the Stable and the miller's cottage; a turret added with initials GW-1922-JS. The owners were Gustav Wilhelm and his wife Josephine Scheltgen. Wilhelm recalled that on his first evening at the mill upon taking possession, he shouted aloud to express his joy, knowing that all around him was his land, and nobody in earshot. Josephine's sister and her husband, Herr Diderich, also lived on the property. They named their son Gustav after his uncle, and he in due course inherited the mill. 1940: The mill was temporarily taken over by the German Army. Stores hidden by the Wilhelm and Diderich families (behind a false wall where the Mazout now stands) were not discovered. One of the mill's four dray horses was commandeered. 1960: Milling of wheat ceased; milling for fodder continued. 1970: All milling ceased, when the last miller, Paul Brockmeyer and his wife, Marianne Bauler, took to commercial stabling. Additional adjacent land was acquired by them in 1973, 1981 and 1990. The whole property was divided into two - the Stables and the Domaine. 2004: The mill, cottage and corner building with turret amalgamated to form a single dwelling. Facade of the cottage building altered to include a front door and two large ground floor windows, with a gabled window above. 2016: The Biddinger family sells the riding school.

Since 1993, papaveretum has been defined in the British Pharmacopoeia (BP) as a mixture of 253 parts morphine hydrochloride, 23 parts papaverine hydrochloride, and 20 parts codeine hydrochloride. It is commonly marketed to medical agencies under the trade name Omnopon. Although the use of papaveretum is now relatively uncommon following the wide availability of single-component opiates and synthetic opioids (e.g. pethidine) it is still used to relieve moderate to severe pain and for pre-operative sedation. In clinical settings, papaveretum is usually administered to patients via subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous routes. Additionally, the morphine syrettes found in combat medical kits issued to military personnel actually contain omnopon. Prior to 1993, papaveretum also contained noscapine, though this component was removed from the BP formulation due to the genotoxic potential of noscapine.

The finals are then held over two to three days, usually in August. Unless explicitly stated, Tougeki usually refers only to the finals. For 2012, Tougeki was held as part of the larger outdoor gaming event GAME SUMMER FESTIVAL 2012, which also included Ongeki ~Game Sound Impact 2012~, for music games, and Wasshoi 2012 Summer!, for shoot 'em up games, and was held in Narita, Chiba.http://shoryuken.com/2012/08/04/tougeki-2012-super- battle-opera-this-weekend/ The event was streamed on niconico for 1500 niconico points (1500 JPY) for one day, and 2500 niconico points (2500 JPY) for two days. As the first tournament held outdoors, there were many reported problems with the event, including low attendance, very high temperatures, glare on the screens, and network problems that required tournament matches to be restarted.

It is held in a scabbard of wood, ivory, horn, or sometimes even silver or gold. The rencong is worn on one's belt around the waist. The design of a rencong depends largely on the social status of its owner. The most common type is made of brass or silver steel with a sheath of wood or buffalo horn. The rencong used by royalty is more ornate and less functional. Royal rencong have sheathes of ivory and blade made from gold, engraved with Quranic verses. Technique Rencong technique is dependent on the weapon's size. Smaller lengths are favoured because they are more easily concealed. The rencong is worn on the left side and drawn with the left foot forward. A quick step forward with the right foot adds momentum to the thrust. It is then whipped to the right with a snap of the hand, bringing the palm upwards while the elbow is close to the body. The thrusting arm is almost fully extended and the palm is turned downward just before piercing the target. While the thrust is the primary method of attack, circular and elliptical slashing techniques exist as well. The main targets are the throat, kidneys, groin, and abdomen. Culture Aceh folklore ascribes mystical attributes and supernatural powers to the rencong. The form of the weapon is said to represent the Basmala. The rencong is today worn as part of traditional attire on ceremonial occasions. Aceh is also known as the \\"Land of the Rencong\\" (Tanah Rencong).

When such thoughts are associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, body dysmorphic disorder (BDD), and sometimes attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the thoughts may become paralyzing, anxiety-provoking, or persistent. Intrusive thoughts may also be associated with episodic memory, unwanted worries or memories from OCD,Baer (2001), pp. 58‚Äì60 posttraumatic stress disorder, other anxiety disorders, eating disorders, or psychosis. Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, and generally have aggressive, sexual, or blasphemous themes.Baer (2001), p. xiv. Description =General= Many people experience the type of bad or unwanted thoughts that people with more troubling intrusive thoughts have, but most people can dismiss these thoughts. For most people, intrusive thoughts are a \\"fleeting annoyance\\".Baer (2001), p. 5. Psychologist Stanley Rachman presented a questionnaire to healthy college students and found that virtually all said they had these thoughts from time to time, including thoughts of sexual violence, sexual punishment, \\"unnatural\\" sex acts, painful sexual practices, blasphemous or obscene images, thoughts of harming elderly people or someone close to them, violence against animals or towards children, and impulsive or abusive outbursts or utterances.As reported in Baer (2001), p. 7: Such thoughts are universal among humans, and have \\"almost certainly always been a part of the human condition\\".Baer (2001), p. 8 When intrusive thoughts occur with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), patients are less able to ignore the unpleasant thoughts and may pay undue attention to them, causing the thoughts to become more frequent and distressing. The suppression of intrusive thoughts often cause these thoughts to become more intense and persistent. The thoughts may become obsessions that are paralyzing, severe, and constantly present, these might involve such topics such as thoughts of violence, sex, or religious blasphemy to name a few examples. Distinguishing them from normal intrusive thoughts experienced by many people, the intrusive thoughts associated with OCD may be anxiety provoking, irrepressible, and persistent.Colino, Stacey. \\"Scary Thoughts: It's Normal for New Parents to Worry Their Baby May Face Harm. For Some Women, Though, Such Fears Become Overwhelming\\". The Washington Post (March 7, 2006). Retrieved on December 30, 2006. How people react to intrusive thoughts may determine whether these thoughts will become severe, turn into obsessions, or require treatment. Intrusive thoughts can occur with or without compulsions. Carrying out the compulsion reduces the anxiety, but makes the urge to perform the compulsion stronger each time it recurs, reinforcing the intrusive thoughts. According to Lee Baer, suppressing the thoughts only makes them stronger, and recognizing that bad thoughts do not signify that one is truly evil is one of the steps to overcoming them.Baer (2001), p. 17 There is evidence of the benefit of acceptance as an alternative to the suppression of intrusive thoughts. In one particular study, those instructed to suppress intrusive thoughts experienced more distress after suppression, while patients instructed to accept the bad thoughts experienced decreased discomfort. These results may be related to underlying cognitive processes involved in OCD. However, accepting the thoughts can be more difficult for persons with OCD. In the 19th century, OCD was known as \\"the doubting sickness\\";. the \\"pathological doubt\\" that accompanies OCD can make it harder for a person with OCD to distinguish \\"normal\\" intrusive thoughts as experienced by most people, which lead them to be too embarrassed to talk about it out of fear that other people would think they were insane.. The possibility that most patients suffering from intrusive thoughts will ever act on those thoughts is low. Patients who are experiencing intense guilt, anxiety, shame, and are upset over these thoughts are very different from those who actually act on them. The history of violent crime is dominated by those who feel no guilt or remorse; the very fact that someone is tormented by intrusive thoughts and has never acted on them before is an excellent predictor that they will not act upon the thoughts. Patients who are not troubled or shamed by their thoughts, do not find them distasteful, or who have actually taken action, might need to have more serious conditions such as psychosis or potentially criminal behaviors ruled out.Baer (2001), pp. 37‚Äì38. According to Lee Baer, a patient should be concerned that intrusive thoughts are dangerous if the person does not feel upset by the thoughts, or rather finds them pleasurable; has ever acted on violent or sexual thoughts or urges; hears voices or sees things that others do not see; or feels uncontrollable irresistible anger.Baer (2001), pp. 43‚Äì44. =Aggressive thoughts= Intrusive thoughts may involve violent obsessions about hurting others or themselves.Baer (2001), pp. 33, 78 They can be related to primarily obsessional obsessive compulsive disorder. These thoughts can include harming a child; jumping from a bridge, mountain, or the top of a tall building; urges to jump in front of a train or automobile; and urges to push another in front of a train or automobile. Rachman's survey of healthy college students found that virtually all of them had intrusive thoughts from time to time, including: * causing harm to elderly people * imagining or wishing harm upon someone close to oneself * impulses to violently attack, hit, harm or kill a person, small child, or animal * impulses to shout at or abuse someone, or attack and violently punish someone, or say something rude, inappropriate, nasty, or violent to someone. These thoughts are part of being human, and need not ruin the quality of life.Baer (2001), p. xv Treatment is available when the thoughts are associated with OCD and become persistent, severe, or distressing. A variant of aggressive intrusive thoughts is L'appel du vide, or the call of the void. Sufferers of L'appel du vide generally describe the condition as manifesting in certain situations, normally as a wish or brief desire to jump from a high location. =Sexual thoughts= Sexual obsession involves intrusive thoughts or images of \\"kissing, touching, fondling, oral sex, anal sex, intercourse, and rape\\" with \\"strangers, acquaintances, parents, children, family members, friends, coworkers, animals and religious figures\\", involving \\"heterosexual or homosexual content\\" with persons of any age. Common sexual themes for intrusive thoughts for men involve ‚Äú(a) having sex in a public place, (b) people I come in contact with being naked, and (c) engaging in a sexual act with someone who is unacceptable to me because they have authority over me.‚Äù While common sexual intrusive thoughts for women are (a) having sex in a public place, (b) engaging in a sexual act with someone who is unacceptable to me because they have authority over me, and (c) being sexually victimized. Like other unwanted intrusive thoughts or images, most people have some inappropriate sexual thoughts at times, but people with OCD may attach significance to the unwanted sexual thoughts, generating anxiety and distress. The doubt that accompanies OCD leads to uncertainty regarding whether one might act on the intrusive thoughts, resulting in self-criticism or loathing. One of the more common sexual intrusive thoughts occurs when an obsessive person doubts their sexual identity. As in the case of most sexual obsessions, sufferers may feel shame and live in isolation, finding it hard to discuss their fears, doubts, and concerns about their sexual identity. A person experiencing sexual intrusive thoughts may feel shame, \\"embarrassment, guilt, distress, torment, fear of acting on the thought or perceived impulse, and doubt about whether they have already acted in such a way.\\" Depression may be a result of the self-loathing that can occur, depending on how much the OCD interferes with daily functioning or causes distress. Their concern over these thoughts may cause them to scrutinize their bodies to determine if the thoughts result in feelings of arousal. However, focusing their attention on any part of the body can result in feelings in that body part, hence doing so may decrease confidence and increase fear about acting on the urges. Part of the treatment of sexual intrusive thoughts involves therapy to help sufferers accept intrusive thoughts and stop trying to reassure themselves by checking their bodies.Baer (2001), p. 35. This arousal within the body parts is due to conditioned physiological responses in the brain, which do not respond to the subject of the sexual intrusive thought but rather to the fact that a sexual thought is occurring at all and thus engage an automatic response (research indicates that the correlation between what the genitalia regard as \\"sexually relevant\\" and what the brain regards as \\"sexually appealing\\" only correlates 50% of the time in men and 10% of the time in women).. This means that an arousal response does not necessarily indicate that the person desires what they are thinking about. However, rational thinking processes attempt to explain this reaction and OCD causes people to attribute false meaning and importance to these physiological reactions in an attempt to make sense of them.. Sufferers can also experience heightened anxiety caused by \\"forbidden\\" images or simply by discussing the matter which can then also cause physiological arousal, such as sweating, increased heart rate and some degree of tumescence or lubrication. This is often misinterpreted by the sufferer as an indication of desire or intent, when it is in fact not.. =Religious thoughts= Blasphemous thoughts are a common component of OCD, documented throughout history; notable religious figures such as Martin Luther and Ignatius of Loyola were known to be tormented by intrusive, blasphemous or religious thoughts and urges.Baer (2001), p.106 Martin Luther had urges to curse God and Jesus, and was obsessed with images of \\"the Devil's behind.\\"Erickson, Erik H. Young Man Luther: A Study in Psychoanalysis and History. New York: W.W. Norton, 1962 St. Ignatius had numerous obsessions, including the fear of stepping on pieces of straw forming a cross, fearing that it showed disrespect to Christ.Ciarrocchi, Joseph W. \\"Religion, Scrupulosity, and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder,\\" in Michael A. Jenike, Lee Baer, and William A. MInichiello, eds., Obsessive-Compulsive Disorders: Practical Management, 3rd ed. St. Louis: Mosby, 1998 A study of 50 patients with a primary diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder found that 40% had religious and blasphemous thoughts and doubts‚Äîa higher, but not statistically significantly different number than the 38% who had the obsessional thoughts related to dirt and contamination more commonly associated with OCD. One study suggests that the content of intrusive thoughts may vary depending on culture, and that blasphemous thoughts may be more common in men than in women. According to Fred Penzel, a New York psychologist, some common religious obsessions and intrusive thoughts are: * sexual thoughts about God, saints, and religious figures * bad thoughts or images during prayer or meditation * thoughts of being possessed * fears of sinning or breaking a religious law or performing a ritual incorrectly * fears of omitting prayers or reciting them incorrectly * repetitive and intrusive blasphemous thoughts * urges or impulses to say blasphemous words or commit blasphemous acts during religious services. Suffering can be greater and treatment complicated when intrusive thoughts involve religious implications; patients may believe the thoughts are inspired by Satan,Baer (2001), p. 108 and may fear punishment from God or have magnified shame because they perceive themselves as sinful.Baer (2001), p. 109 Symptoms can be more distressing for sufferers with strong religious convictions or beliefs. Baer believes that blasphemous thoughts are more common in Catholics and evangelical Protestants than in other religions, whereas Jews or Muslims tend to have obsessions related more to complying with the laws and rituals of their faith, and performing the rituals perfectly.Baer (2001), pp. 111‚Äì112 He hypothesizes that this is because what is considered inappropriate varies among cultures and religions, and intrusive thoughts torment their sufferers with whatever is considered most inappropriate in the surrounding culture.Baer (2001), p. 112  Age factors  Adults under the age of 40 seem to be the most affected by intrusive thoughts. Individuals in this age range tend to be less experienced at coping with these thoughts, and the stress and negative affect induced by them. Younger adults also tend to have stressors specific to that period of life that can be particularly challenging especially in the face of intrusive thoughts. Although, when introduced with an intrusive thought, both age groups immediately look for ways to reduce the recurrence of the thoughts. Those in middle adulthood (40-60) have the highest prevalence of OCD and therefore seem to be the most susceptible to the anxiety and negative emotions associated with intrusive thought. Middle adults are in a unique position because they have to struggle with both the stressors of early and late adulthood. They may be more vulnerable to intrusive thought because they have more topics to relate to. Even with this being the case, middle adults are still better at coping with intrusive thoughts than early adults, although it takes them longer at first to process an intrusive thought. Older adults tend to see the intrusive thought more as a cognitive failure rather than a moral failure in opposition to young adults. They have a harder time suppressing the intrusive thoughts than young adults causing them to experience higher stress levels when dealing with these thoughts. Intrusive thoughts appear to occur at the same rate across the lifespan, however, older adults seem to be less negatively affected than younger adults. Older adults have more experience in ignoring or suppressing strong negative reactions to stress. Associated conditions Intrusive thoughts are associated with OCD or obsessive-compulsive personality disorder,Baer (2001), p. 40, 57 but may also occur with other conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, clinical depression, postpartum depression, and anxiety. One of these conditionsBaer also mentions Tourette syndrome (TS), but notes that it is the combination of comorbid OCD‚Äîwhen present‚Äîand tics that accounts for the intrusive, obsessive thoughts. People with tic-related OCD (OCD plus tics) are more likely to have violent or sexual obsessions. is almost always present in people whose intrusive thoughts reach a clinical level of severity.Baer (2001), p. 51 A large study published in 2005 found that aggressive, sexual, and religious obsessions were broadly associated with comorbid anxiety disorders and depression. The intrusive thoughts that occur in a schizophrenic episode differ from the obsessional thoughts that occur with OCD or depression in that the intrusive thoughts of schizophrenics are false or delusional beliefs (i.e. held by the schizophrenic individual to be real and not doubted, as is typically the case with intrusive thoughts) . =Post-traumatic stress disorder= The key difference between OCD and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is that the intrusive thoughts of PTSD sufferers are of content relating to traumatic events that actually happened to them, whereas OCD sufferers have thoughts of imagined catastrophes. PTSD patients with intrusive thoughts have to sort out violent, sexual, or blasphemous thoughts from memories of traumatic experiences.Baer (2001), pp. 62‚Äì64 When patients with intrusive thoughts do not respond to treatment, physicians may suspect past physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.Baer (2001), p. 67 If a person who has experienced trauma practices looks for the positive outcomes, it is suggested they will experience less depression and higher self well-being. While a person may experience less depression for benefit finding, they may also experience an increased amount of intrusive and/or avoidant thoughts. One study looking at women with PTSD found that intrusive thoughts were more persistent when the individual tried to cope by using avoidance-based thought regulation strategies. Their findings further support that not all coping strategies are helpful in diminishing the frequency of intrusive thoughts. =Depression= People who are clinically depressed may experience intrusive thoughts more intensely, and view them as evidence that they are worthless or sinful people. The suicidal thoughts that are common in depression must be distinguished from intrusive thoughts, because suicidal thoughts‚Äîunlike harmless sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts‚Äîcan be dangerous.Baer (2001), pp. 51‚Äì53 Non-depressed individuals have been shown to have a higher activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is the area of the brain that primarily functions in cognition, working memory, and planning, while attempting to suppress intrusive thoughts. This activation decreases in people at risk of or currently diagnosed with depression. When the intrusive thoughts re-emerge, non depressed individuals also show higher activation levels in the anterior cingulate cortices, which functions in error detection, motivation, and emotional regulation, than their depressed counterparts. Roughly 60% of depressed individuals report experiencing bodily, visual, or auditory perceptions along with their intrusive thoughts. There is a correlation with experiencing those sensations with intrusive thoughts and more intense depressive symptoms as well as the need for heavier treatment. =Postpartum depression and OCD= Unwanted thoughts by mothers about harming infants are common in postpartum depression.Baer (2001), p. 20 A 1999 study of 65 women with postpartum major depression by Katherine Wisner et al. found the most frequent aggressive thought for women with postpartum depression was causing harm to their newborn infants.As reported in Baer (2001), pp. 20‚Äì23, 139‚Äì40: A study of 85 new parents found that 89% experienced intrusive images, for example, of the baby suffocating, having an accident, being harmed, or being kidnapped. Some women may develop symptoms of OCD during pregnancy or the postpartum period. Postpartum OCD occurs mainly in women who may already have OCD, perhaps in a mild or undiagnosed form. Postpartum depression and OCD may be comorbid (often occurring together). And though physicians may focus more on the depressive symptoms, one study found that obsessive thoughts did accompany postpartum depression in 57% of new mothers. Wisner found common obsessions about harming babies in mothers experiencing postpartum depression include images of the baby lying dead in a casket or being eaten by sharks; stabbing the baby; throwing the baby down the stairs; or drowning or burning the baby (as by submerging it in the bathtub in the former case or throwing it in the fire or putting it in the microwave in the latter).Baer (2001), p. 21 Baer estimates that up to 200,000 new mothers with postpartum depression each year may develop these obsessional thoughts about their babies;Baer (2001), p. 22 and because they may be reluctant to share these thoughts with a physician or family member, or suffer in silence out of fear they could be \\"crazy\\", their depression can worsen.Baer (2001), p. 23 Intrusive fears of harming immediate children can last longer than the postpartum period. A study of 100 clinically depressed women found that 41% had obsessive fears that they might harm their child, and some were afraid to care for their children. Among non-depressed mothers, the study found 7% had thoughts of harming their childAs reported in Baer (2001), p. 51: ‚Äîa rate that yields an additional 280,000 non-depressed mothers in the United States with intrusive thoughts about harming their children.Baer (2001), p. 24 Treatment Treatment for intrusive thoughts is similar to treatment for OCD. Exposure and response prevention therapy‚Äîalso referred to as habituation or desensitization‚Äîis useful in treating intrusive thoughts. Mild cases can also be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps patients identify and manage the unwanted thoughts.. =Exposure therapy= Exposure therapy is the treatment of choice for intrusive thoughts.Baer (2001), p. 91 According to Deborah Osgood-Hynes, Psy.D. Director of Psychological Services and Training at the MGH/McLean OCD Institute, \\"In order to reduce a fear, you have to face a fear. This is true of all types of anxiety and fear reactions, not just OCD.\\" Because it is uncomfortable to experience bad thoughts and urges, shame, doubt or fear, the initial reaction is usually to do something to make the feelings diminish. By engaging in a ritual or compulsion to diminish the anxiety or bad feeling, the action is strengthened via a process called negative reinforcement‚Äîthe mind learns that the way to avoid the bad feeling is by engaging in a ritual or compulsions. When OCD becomes severe, this leads to more interference in life and continues the frequency and severity of the thoughts the person sought to avoid. Exposure therapy (or exposure and response prevention) is the practice of staying in an anxiety- provoking or feared situation until the distress or anxiety diminishes. The goal is to reduce the fear reaction, learning to not react to the bad thoughts. This is the most effective way to reduce the frequency and severity of the intrusive thoughts. The goal is to be able to \\"expose yourself to the thing that most triggers your fear or discomfort for one to two hours at a time, without leaving the situation, or doing anything else to distract or comfort you.\\"Baer (2001), p. 73 Exposure therapy will not completely eliminate intrusive thoughts‚Äîeveryone has bad thoughts‚Äîbut most patients find that it can decrease their thoughts sufficiently that intrusive thoughts no longer interfere with their lives.Baer (2001), p. 86 =Cognitive behavioral therapy= Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a newer therapy than exposure therapy, available for those unable or unwilling to undergo exposure therapy. Cognitive therapy has been shown to be useful in reducing intrusive thoughts, but developing a conceptualization of the obsessions and compulsions with the patient is important. One of the strategies sometimes used in Cognitive Behavioral Theory is mindfulness exercises. These include practices such as being aware of the thoughts, accepting the thoughts without judgement for them, and ‚Äúbeing larger than your thoughts.‚Äù =Medication= Antidepressants or antipsychotic medications may be used for more severe cases if intrusive thoughts do not respond to cognitive behavioral or exposure therapy alone.Baer (2001), pp. 113‚Äì14. Whether the cause of intrusive thoughts is OCD, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) drugs (a class of antidepressants) are the most commonly prescribed. Intrusive thoughts may occur in persons with Tourette syndrome (TS) who also have OCD; the obsessions in TS-related OCD are thought to respond to SSRI drugs as well.Baer (2001), p. 144 Antidepressants that have been shown to be effective in treating OCD include fluvoxamine (trade name Luvox), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), citalopram (Celexa), and clomipramine (Anafranil).Baer (2001), p. 116 Although SSRIs are known to be effective for OCD in general, there have been fewer studies on their effectiveness for intrusive thoughts.Baer (2001), p. 115 A retrospective chart review of patients with sexual symptoms treated with SSRIs showed the greatest improvement was in those with intrusive sexual obsessions typical of OCD.As reported in Baer (2001), p. 115: A study of ten patients with religious or blasphemous obsessions found that most patients responded to treatment with fluoxetine or clomipramine.As reported in Baer (2001), p. 115: Women with postpartum depression often have anxiety as well, and may need lower starting doses of SSRIs; they may not respond fully to the medication, and may benefit from adding cognitive behavioral or response prevention therapy.Baer (2001), p. 120 Patients with intense intrusive thoughts that do not respond to SSRIs or other antidepressants may be prescribed typical and atypical neuroleptics including risperidone (trade name Risperdal), ziprasidone (Geodon), haloperidol (Haldol), and pimozide (Orap).Baer (2001), p. 119 Studies suggest that therapeutic doses of inositol may be useful in the treatment of obsessive thoughts. * Epidemiology A 2007 study found that 78% of a clinical sample of OCD patients had intrusive images. Most people who suffer from intrusive thoughts have not identified themselves as having OCD, because they may not have what they believe to be classic symptoms of OCD, such as handwashing. Yet, epidemiological studies suggest that intrusive thoughts are the most common kind of OCD worldwide; if people in the United States with intrusive thoughts gathered, they would form the fourth-largest city in the US, following New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.Baer (2001), p. xvii The prevalence of OCD in every culture studied is at least 2% of the population, and the majority of those have obsessions, or bad thoughts, only; this results in a conservative estimate of more than 2 million sufferers in the United States alone (as of 2000).Baer (2001), pp. 36‚Äì37 One author estimates that one in 50 adults have OCD and about 10‚Äì20% of these have sexual obsessions. A recent study found that 25% of 293 patients with a primary diagnosis of OCD had a history of sexual obsessions.

These organizations are involved in a series of workshops and seminars that the students themselves conduct. The organizations have been detailed below. These three student organizations are the main source of extracurricular and technical activities hosted by the college. =Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers= IEEE-SAKEC is the student chapter of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. It helps organize Nucleus, an annual intercollegiate technical symposium. It is the most active student body in the whole Bombay Section. Apart from organizing events in the college like international university fairs, technical and non-technical seminars and workshops, it organizes a yearly industrial visit to parts of the country. IEEE-SAKEC is a big milestone of this college. =Indian Society for Technical Education= ISTE-SAKEC is the student chapter of the Indian Society for Technical Education, established in 2005. It organizes workshops, seminars and field trips. It helps organize Nucleus, the annual intercollegiate technical symposium. =Computer Society of India= CSI-SAKEC is the student chapter of the Computer Society of India. It conducts workshops during holidays for SAKEC students. The students started a CSI website and CSI magazine, Cache in March 2010. =Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers= IETE-SAKEC is the student chapter of the Institute of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineers. The IETE SAKEC has been instrumental in bringing all the students of the college in the Electronics and telecommunication branch closer and making shah and anchor a closely knit family. It is a new organization and was made famous for its classy opening ceremony, wherein the inauguration of the organization's name (IETE-SAKEC) was done by the chairman with the help of a remote controlled curtain raiser. This is just the beginning of the many more events that would be conducted successfully by the newly christened student organisation. Festivals The college holds multiple events in its annual festival. They are broadly classified into six categories: Nucleus (the technical fest), R1 (national level robotics), Verve (the cultural fest), Marathon, Olympus (comprising all sports based events) and Portal. = Nucleus = Nucleus is the annual technical symposium of the college. It is jointly organised by the student bodies and the college student council. Companies like HP, Videocon, Bank of Baroda, Samsonite, Charagh Din, MTNL and Asian Paints are associated with it. It covers 50 colleges with more than 3000 students coming from all the parts of the city. Nucleus is SAKEC's annual technical festival promoting technical events and contests for all Mumbai University students. It aims to provide a platform for students to come out of their usual syllabus and experience practical knowledge. Nucleus hosts the following events: :Technical: The technical events are widely ranged, from coding competitions, events involving practical and interdisciplinary knowledge and various contests that explore creativity and curiosity among students. :Non-technical: There are also a variety of non-technical events associated with the festival. The prominent ones include contests that encourage lateral thinking. There is also a Minute to Win it based contest as well as a gaming contest. Simulation events include handling a virtual IPL team and getting placed via interview. :Robotics: The robotics based events are one of the most prominent features of the technical fest. Together, the events incorporate challenges for the first three levels of robotics. :Challenges include robots playing football, Pacman, maneuvering through various themed courses, remote maze navigation, autonomous line following as well as a robot battle and many others. = R1 = R1 is a national-level robotics event held annually in the college grounds.

History The Rainbow Interchange opened to traffic on March 22, 1991. The cost of constructing the interchange was $121 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Jim Weinberg designed the color scheme for the overpasses. He used Art Deco-stylized shades of color for the overpasses: winter blue, mural pink, cockleshell, natural grain, sailor's sky, and hazy sun. In 1990, while the interchange was still under construction, the Miami Herald ran a contest in which its readers were requested to submit names for the soon-to-be important connection between two Interstate highways. The winning name was the Lauderloop, an ironic choice as four-level stack interchanges do not incorporate loops in their design. The contest was a short-term joke as virtually nobody in the local media referred to \\"Lauderloop\\" in their articles and reports involving the interchange, choosing the Rainbow moniker instead.History of Interstate 595 In 2002, the Florida Department of Transportation decided to repaint the interchange in bold colors. Description The Rainbow Interchange marks the southern end of a segment of I-95 that sees traffic levels of roughly 300,000 automobiles per day in its 14 lanes, making it the busiest stretch of highway in the State of Florida; History of Interstate 95 in South Florida Interstate 595 carries half that load in its eight lanes just west of the colorful junction of two Interstate highways. Future Due to Phase 3 of the I-95 Express Lanes extension, the interchange will be expanded with more overpasses and flyover ramps. The existing overpasses and flyover ramps will remain open since they will remain intact, but the girders will be repainted blue. The construction of the new overpasses and flyover ramps and the repaint of the existing ones are scheduled to begin by either 2019 or 2020 and expected to be completed by 2023.

The creation of (973) was intended as a long-term solution. However, within three years it was close to exhaustion once again.

Early years He was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1909. Greenberg and his parents were Jewish. On the streets of New York is where he met Siegel and 1930s Murder, Inc. leader Louis Buchalter. Alleged tie to organized crime His first known arrest was in September 1927 for drowning Benjamin Goldstein; he was arrested with two other low-level criminals named Joseph Lefkowitz and Irving Rubinzahl. Greenberg was acquitted, and only Lefkowitz was convicted for the crime and sentenced to the electric chair, although he was later acquitted. On 11 November, 1928, police raided a home and arrested Greenberg and Siegel, Harry Teitelbaum, Louis Kravitz, Philip Kovolick, Hyman Holtz, Joseph Stacher and Jacob Shapiro. Most of these men were the assassins and backbone of Murder Inc. The men met together to discuss their rival Waxey Gordon. In 1934, dynamite was dropped through the chimney of an office owned by Siegel on Grand Street, Manhattan as retribution for Siegel murdering rival bootleggers; luckily it had exploded too early before Siegel walked into the room although he and others were wounded. Three days later, Louis and Andy Fabrizzo who were members of Gordon's crew, were murdered and found near a distillery owned by Gordon. Shapiro, Stacher, Greenberg himself and Siegel were involved but it is alleged that only Siegel pulled the trigger. In 1936, he was ordered by Louis \\"Lepke\\" Buchalter to lead a raid into the office of Needle Trades Workers Industrial Union, who were having a meeting at the time. Murder On November 22, 1939, Greenberg was murdered by Bugsy Siegel, Whitey Krakow, and Lucchese crime family soldier Frankie Carbo. Prosecutors claimed that Siegel had brought them to his house and drove the getaway car, and that Carbo shot Greenberg in the head 5 times. His wife Ida Greenberg found him murdered at his driveway. Greenberg allegedly ordered $5,000 from Buchalter to keep his silence from law enforcement, however Buchalter subsequently ordered his murder. Siegel was sent to trial in 1940 but not convicted. The second trial began in 1942 and Carbo was the main defendant. Krakow was murdered in 1941. Abe Reles, a notorious hitman for Murder Inc, agreed to testify however his death occurred in 1941 in an apparent-suicide (that appeared staged) and the murder case was dismissed; Reles' actual cause of death is highly debated. Another Murder Inc hitman Albert Tannenbaum also became an informant, said he brought the murder weapons to Los Angeles from New York and gave them to Carbo and Siegel. Media Greenberg was portrayed by Academy Award nominee Elliott Gould in the 1991 film Bugsy. References Further reading *Block, Alan A. East Side-West Side: Organizing Crime in New York, 1930-1950.

He is also credited with giving guitarist George Benson his first break. Career Born Eugene McDuffy in Champaign, Illinois, McDuff began playing bass, appearing in Joe Farrell's group. Encouraged by Willis Jackson in whose band he also played bass in the late 1950s, McDuff moved to the organ and began to attract the attention of Prestige while still with Jackson's group. McDuff soon became a bandleader, leading groups featuring a young George Benson on guitar, Red Holloway on tenor saxophone and Joe Dukes on drums.\\"Hammond Technique and Methods: Music Written for the Hammond Organ\\" by JR Whiteley - 2013. York University masters thesis McDuff recorded many classic albums on Prestige, including his debut solo Brother Jack in 1960; The Honeydripper (1961), with tenor saxophonist Jimmy Forrest and guitarist Grant Green; Brother Jack Meets The Boss (1962), featuring Gene Ammons; Screamin‚Äô (1962), with alto saxophonist Leo Wright and guitarist Kenny Burrell; and Brother Jack McDuff Live! (1963), featuring Holloway and Benson, which includes his biggest hit, \\"Rock Candy\\". After his tenure at Prestige, McDuff joined the Atlantic label for a brief period, and in the 1970s he recorded for Blue Note. To Seek a New Home (1970) was recorded in England with a line-up featuring blues shouter Jimmy Witherspoon and some of Britain's top jazz musicians of the day, including Terry Smith on guitar and Dick Morrissey on tenor saxophone. Decreasing interest in jazz and blues during the late 1970s and 1980s meant that many jazz musicians went through a lean time.\\"Joey DeFrancesco: Comeback for jazz organ\\".

This is known as their Advantage Matrix. The matrix was published in a 1981 Perspective titled \\"Strategy in the 1980s\\" by Richard Lochridge. Overview Similar to the growth-share matrix, the Advantage Matrix groups businesses into four categories. These are volume, stalemated, specialized and fragmented businesses. However, this matrix takes as its axes the two contrasting alternatives, economies of scale (described by them as 'potential size of advantage') against differentiation (shown as 'number of approaches to achieving advantage'). In essence, the former category covers the approach described in the more popular growth-share matrix, while the latter represents the approach (described by Michael Porter) of differentiating products so that they do not compete head-on with their competitors. * Volume business. In this case there are considerable economies of scale, but few opportunities for differentiation. This is the classic situation in which organizations strive for economies of scale by becoming the volume, and hence, cost leader. Examples are volume cars and consumer electronics. * Stalemated business. Here there is neither the opportunity for differentiation nor economies of scale; examples are textiles and shipbuilding. The main means of competition, therefore, has been reducing the \`factor costs' (mainly those of labor) by moving to locations where these costs are lower, even to different countries in the developing world. * Specialized business. These businesses gain benefits from both economies of scale and differentiation (often characterized by experience effects in their own, differentiated, segment); examples being branded foods and cosmetics. The main strategies are focus and segment leadership. * Fragmented business. These organizations also gain benefit from differentiation, particularly in the services sector, but little from economies of scale; examples being restaurants and job-shop engineering. Competition may be minimized by innovatory differentiation. Practical Use of the Advantage Matrix \\"These two factors ‚Äì the size of the advantage and the number of ways it can be achieved ‚Äì can be combined into a simple matrix to help guide more creative strategy development. The specific requirements for success are different in each quadrant.\\"--Richard Lochridge =Size of Advantage= The Boston Consulting Group described the size of advantage as a company's ability to gain economies of scale. =Number of Approaches to Achieving Advantage= The number of approaches to achieving advantage is the company's ability to differentiate from their competitors. Critical Reception Apart from the fact that it has not suffered as badly at the hands of later popularizers, the particular advantage of this matrix is that it highlights the assumptions that are hidden in the Growth-Share Matrix. It may also give a better feel for the optimum strategy and the likely profits, but it does not give any feel for the cash flow, which was the main feature of the original matrix.

He was the son of Agness Roberson (1745-1827) and Peter McMicking (1731-1823), a United Empire Loyalist who immigrated to Upper Canada during the American Revolutionary War and settled in Stamford in 1780. Gilbert served as quartermaster for the local militia during the War of 1812. He was appointed coroner for the Niagara District in 1811. In 1838, he became customs collector at [Queenston, Ontario]. He represented the 4th riding of Lincoln in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada from 1834 to 1841 as a Reformer. He also served as reeve of Stamford Township, Welland Co. He married Catherine Swayze (1793-1877) on April 16, 1811 and had two daughters, Sarah Catherine (1814-1882, m. John Keefer) and Mary Ann (1818-1892, m. James Fergus McGlashan).McMicking Family Website http://www.mcmickingfamily.com/mcmicking- gilbertsopeter/4589585343 Gilbert McMicking died November 1, 1847 at Willoughby Twp, Welland Co., Canada West. He is buried at the Stamford Presbyterian Church Cemetery in Niagara Falls, ON., Canada. Land Deeds On 24 Apr 1835 the Executive Council ordered to Gilbert McMicking a licence of occupation for Lots 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 Concession 4 Willoughby Twp. containing five hundred acres, reserved as a Glebe. (Willoughby Township Papers 267) Extract from a report of a Committee of the Executive Council dated 22 Nov 1842: Peter Sayler and others inhabitants of the Township of Willoughby informing the Government that Gilbert McMicking who obtained a licence of occupation of certain Glebe Lots 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 in the 4th Concession of the said township has been cutting the best timber and otherwise injuring the said lots. The lots for which licence of occupation was given to Mr. McMicking are Glebe Lots or Clergy Reserves and as such should not be used for any purpose foreign to the trust upon which they are placed at the disposal of the Provincial Government. The committee therefore recommend that Mr. McMicking be informed that the licence of occupation is revoked and that the lands be treated in future as ordinary Clergy Reserves. (Willoughby Township Papers 0269) On 23 Dec 1842 David Thorburn wrote to the Commissioner of Crown Lands saying his friend Mr. McMicking of Chippawa has shown Thorburn a letter from the Commissioner informing that the licence of occupation which he held under date of 24 Apr 1835 for Lots No. 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 in the Township of Willoughby had been cancelled. If the Executive Council could reconsider their decision, Thorburn felt confident that Mr. McMicking has strong claims upon the Government relative to his being allowed to use those lands for a longer period. First the ground on which he obtained them were to procure fuel to a steam flouring mill, no water mill being in that part of the country for a great distance to enable the inhabitants of the five townships composing the fourth riding of Lincoln to gey funding with the exception of two which were far from the steam mill and they only by the spring and fall freshet did grinding for a few weeks in the year. The steam mill was erected at great expense and without the advantage of the wood from those uncultivated lands in its vicinity the erection would not have answered the purpose. But unfortunately the mill has been totally consumed during our recent trouble by two incendianis (sic incendiaries) who came from the American side expressly to destroy them. One of the incendianis was afterwards apprehended and remained in our gaol for over one year and was discharged on his giving information relative to the plot. The loss to Mr. McMicking was three thousand five hundred pounds which has nearly ruined him. Another reason is that roads in that township are of the very worst kind. Indeed, there is scarcely a road in it and on that account he has done much and still is opening new roads much to the advantage of the interior settler. He has leased the Block out to a few poor Germans in fifty acre parcels for a few years. (Willoughby Township Papers 0273) On 3 May 1822 Gilbert McMicking as agent for his father Peter McMicking paid to the Receiver General‚Äôs Office the surveying fees for the west half of Lot 44 in the Township of Stamford containing 50 acres. ¬£1.0.0 fees of survey.

Admissions It has about 1,013 pupils of whom 261 are in the Sixth Form. It is situated just north of the A4 next to Kedermister Park. Cycle route 61 passes north-south next to the west side of the school. Langley Grammar School selects its incoming students on the basis of examined ability, at age 11 by NFER 11+ examination or for Sixth Form by performance at GCSE and interview. Mr John Constable is the current headteacher of the school. Around 70% of pupils come from outside of the LAA, with many from Hillingdon. History The school was founded in 1956 by Buckinghamshire County Council; Slough and Langley at that time being in Buckinghamshire. The founding Headmaster was Mr J. G. Day. Since 1 April 2011 the school has been an Academy Trust and a Charitable Company limited by guarantee registered in England and Wales (registered number 7536795). In the early 1980s, there were plans to close the school to reduce Slough's grammar schools from 5 to 4. In the end, two single-sex grammar schools merged instead to form Upton Grammar School (now Upton Court Grammar School). Facilities Langley Grammar School has recently sold tracts of land at the end of the former school field to fund building and restoration works including, amongst others, a new teaching block of six classrooms, a sports hall, fitness suite, multi-purpose area, and astro-turf pitch. On 11 September 2006, the new Sports Hall was officially opened by the mayor of Slough. A new sixth form centre was completed in August 2007, which was opened on 28 September 2007 by Princess Anne.

It is located in the district of Pandacan in the City of Manila, Philippines, established by Cardinal Rufino Jiao Santos, D.D. in 1955 to provide a school that would enable the children of Pandacan and its neighboring towns an opportunity to receive good Roman Catholic oriented education. History of St. Joseph's School The collaboration of Cardinal Rufino Jiao Santos, the Sisters of the Immaculate Heart of Mary (ICM), who were also planning to build a school in Pandacan, and Sto. Ni√±o Parish Priest Guilermo Mendoza led to the establishment of St. Joseph's School's very first building at the adjacent vacant lot to the Sto. Ni√±o Parish Church. The school's first few years saw the rapid growth in the population of the school, and in 1959, under the direction of Sister Marie Alice Dieltiens, ICM, the school's first principal, a new building was built for the high school level, which would admit only female students. The school's enrollment continued to grow, however, with some classes being held in makeshift classrooms in the Parish Office building. Thus, with the assistance of parents, the school was able to obtain a loan to build a new building. This annex to the high school building was blessed and opened on November 28, 1971 by Cardinal Santos with Bishop Bienvenido Lopez and Parish Priest Victor Serrano. The ICM Sisters managed the school for anumber of decades. In 1993, when the Sisters' charism and mission were changed, with a focus on deploying their sisters abroad, the ICM Sisters informed Cardinal Jaime Sin, Manila's Archbishop, of their intention to give up administering St. Joseph's School and turned over its management directly to the parish priest of Sto. Ni√±o Parish. In schoolyear 1994, after the introduction of a facilities improvement project to help elevate the conditions and teaching facilities of the school, the Sisters of the Missionary Apostles of Christ (MACE) were invited to help in the financial aspect of the administration of the school, as well handle areas of religious education. During the same year, the admission criteria were adjusted to accommodate male students in the high school department. In 2002, the parish priest of the church gave up the directorship of the school to concentrate on parish work. Cardinal Archbishop of Manila Jaime Sin appointed Fr. Nolan A. Que, Ph.D., to the post of School Director. Long time St. Joseph teacher Emolyn G. Guamil was appointed Assistant Director in 2004, while Elizabeth D. Mendoza was appointed Institutional Principal the same year. In schoolyear 2005-06, the school opened its multi-purpose gymnasium at what used to be the location of the elementary school chapel. The new gym serves as the main facility for the various physical education-related programs of the school. Also during this schoolyear, Fr. Que was given the task of supervising other schools nearby, including Paco Catholic School, St. Peter the Apostle School, Ermita Catholic School, Pius the X School, Malate Catholic School and as Assistant Director at St. Anthony School, Manila. For schoolyear 2007-08, the school is set to change its official school uniform colors for girls from green (skirt and tie) to a dark red plaid (skirt and tie). =Directors of SJS from 1955 to present= *Guillermo Mendoza - 1955 to 1970 *Victorino Serrano - 1970 to 1986 *Felipe Ocol - 1986 to December1988 *Manny Sebastian - January 1989 to March 1989 *Severino O.

Located in the capital of Gujarat, the complex was built over 13 years and is a tribute to Swaminarayan and his life and teachings. At the center of the 23-acre complex is the Akshardham mandir, which is built from 6,000 metric tons of pink sandstone from Rajasthan. The complex's name refers to the divine abode of Swaminarayan in the BAPS philosophy; followers of Swaminarayan believe that the jiva or soul goes to Akshardham after attaining moksha, or liberation. BAPS followers worship Swaminarayan as God almighty. Akshardham Mandir The focal point of the complex is the Akshardham Mandir, which measures 108 feet high, 131 feet wide and 240 feet long and features 97 carved pillars, 17 domes, 8 balconies, 220 stone beams and 264 sculpted figures. In accordance with Vedic architectural principles, no steel or iron has been used anywhere in the mandir. 20 foot- long stone beams, each weighing five tons, have been used as load-bearing support throughout the mandir. The mandir's central chamber houses a seven- foot-tall, gold-leafed murti, or sacred image, of Swaminarayan, who is worshipped by followers as God. The murti rests upon a three-foot pedestal and weighs 1.2 tons. It is flanked by the murtis of the ideal devotee, Aksharbrahma Gunatitanand Swami and Aksharmukta Goplanand Swami, both in postures of loving devotion toward Swaminarayan. In each of the four corners of the mandir sits a life-sized marble murti of the lineages of gurus or successors of Swaminarayan revered by BAPS. The first floor of the mandir is known as the Vibhuti Mandapam and features lotus-shaped displays describing the spiritual character of Swaminarayan, while the basement of the mandir, called the Prasadi Mandapam, houses a historical display of various sacred relics from Swaminarayan's life. Abhishek Mandapam The complex houses an Abhishek Mandapam an area designated for all visitors to perform abhishek on the murti of Neelkanth Varni - a yogic form of Swaminarayan. The murti of Neelkanth Varni was consecrated in 2014 by Pramukh Swami and the Abhishek Mandapam was inaugurated on 14 December 2015 by Mahant Swami, the sixth spiritual successor of Lord Swaminarayan according to the denomination of Swaminarayan Hinduism. The abhishek ritual begins with the tying of a Kalava, a sacred Hindu thread, on the visitor's wrist along with the recitation of Hindu shlokas. Following the tying of the thread, the visitors bath the murti of Neelkanth Varni with a small pot of sanctified water. While the murti is bathed, visitors are encouraged to pray for their personal wishes. Exhibition Halls The complex's five exhibition halls use audio-visual presentations and life-sized dioramas to explore various themes in Hinduism. The Neelkanth and Sahajannd Halls depict Swaminarayan's life, work and teachings. The Mystic India Hall features an IMAX theater which screens a 40-minute film portraying the country-spanning pilgrimage Swaminarayan had embarked on at the age of eleven, when he assumed the name Neelkanth Varni. The film, directed by Keith Melton and narrated by Peter O‚ÄôToole, was shot at 108 locations across India and boasts a cast of over 45,000 people. It has received numerous plaudits including the Audience's Choice Award at the 10th International Large Format Film Festival at La Geode in Paris, France and the \\"Most Popular Film\\" at the San Jose IMAX Film Festival. The Premanand Hall is divided into three sub-sections, the first is dedicated to the Hindu scriptural texts, the Upanishads, the Ramayan, and the Mahabharat; the second explores religions more generally and features photographic displays of the symbols, scriptures, sacred sites, moral codes and prayers of the world's major faiths; and the third section serves as a tribute to some of India's most famous poets. The fifth exhibition hall, Sant Param Hitakari, houses an audio-animatronics show conveying a message of everlasting happiness. Sat- Chit-Anand Water Show The Sat-Chit-Anand Water Show is an interpretative performance of the parable of Nachiketa, as told in the Kathopanishad. The show's title translates to Truth-Knowledge-Bliss and is an appellation of the Hindu ontological reality Aksharbrahma or Akshardham. The show was inaugurated on 3 April 2010 by Pramukh Swami. The vibrant show employs fire, fountain animations, laser, water screen projections, music and live characters in a 45-minute retelling of Nachiketa's choice. Nachiketa was the son of a rishi named Udalak, who organized a yagna in which he gifted sickly, barren cattle to Brahmin attendees. Nachiketa was troubled by his father's deception and asked to whom he himself would be offered to in charity. Angered by this question, Udalak banished Nachiketa to the realm of Yamapuri, the underworld. Nachiketa stood at King Yama's doorstep for three days waiting for Yama's arrival; Yama was impressed by Nachiketa's resoluteness, and offered him three boons. Firstly, Nachiketa requested that his father may welcome him lovingly upon his return home; next that he be granted the knowledge by which he can be worthy of living in the heavens; and lastly he may attain knowledge of the eternal soul, the Atma, which transcends death. The story of Nachiketa offers lessons in realizing one's true Self, living by one's principles, perseverance in the face of difficulties, and keeping spiritual perspective in any circumstance. AARSH (Akshardham Centre for Applied Research in Social Harmony) AARSH is a research institute focused on the Swaminarayan tradition as well as the role of Hindu principles in solving social problems. It serves as a forum for scholars to discuss pragmatic application of religion and philosophy to raise social harmony in society The research facility includes a library of more than 7,000 works in Sanskrit, Hindi, Gujarati and Tamil as well as a large collection of rare manuscripts that cover the various denominations and schools of philosophy in Hinduism. AARSH regularly hosts academic conferences; past events include the Sanskrit Scholars‚Äô Conference, the Sanskrit Journalists‚Äô Conference, the Saints Poets Conference and the National Conference on Vaidikatva. AARSH, led by its director, Dr. Shrutiprakash Swami, is an independent research institute affiliated with Shree Somnath Sanskrit University in Veraval, Gujarat. Sahajanand Van Sahajanand Van is a 15-acre garden with various attractions, including rock arrangements, fountains, a waterfall, and an 18,000 sq. ft. plant nursery. In addition, throughout the garden are six cultural wisdom spots which depict specific incidents and teachings of Hinduism. The first spot is a marble sculpture which depicts Swaminarayan on his favourite mare, Manki. Swaminarayan traveled in Gujarat on horseback, visiting villages and homes of devotees. Manki's love and emotion for Swaminarayan is notable. The second spot is a sculpture depicting Vishnu on the coils of the multi-headed serpent, Shesha. At Vishnu's side is Laxmiji, his choicest devotee. This spot expresses the role of the ideal devotee ‚Äì to remain eternally in the service of God. The third spot is the Surya Rath, which depicts the Sun Chariot being drawn by seven stallions. Indian culture honors the Sun for it is the provider of light, energy and life. The fourth spot is the Samudra Manthan, which depicts the churning of the ocean, through a joint effort between the demi-gods and demons, in the search for immortalizing nectar, or amrut. Before amrut was discovered, a lethal poison was churned out. Shiva came to the rescue and saved the world from destruction. The moral of the story is that God should be sought when calamities emerge in life. The fifth spot depicts the holy rivers of Ganga, Yamuna and Saraswati. Along the banks of these rivers, Hindu culture has flourished. The sixth spot is Lake Narayan Sarovar. At the center of the lake is a 20-foot fountain. Sahajanand Van also hosts an open air assembly ground with a seating capacity of 9,000. This area is used for cultural programs and festivals. Also within Sahajanand Van is a vegetarian restaurant titled, Premvati, serving Indian cuisine with regional choices. Construction and opening The foundation stone-laying ceremony for the Akshardham mandir was conducted by Pramukh Swami on 14 December 1979, and the foundation was completed in 1981. Artisans skilled in stonework prepared the stones used in the Akshardham mandir; the process consisted of smoothing, contouring, detailing and polishing. Smoothing entails chiseling the hewn stone into smaller pieces; contouring involves stenciling the bare designs onto stone, and to give approximate contours to the stone; the artisans use chisels to detail the designs and figurines into stone; and finally, emery is used to file and polish the stone to a smooth finish. While the mandir structure itself was completed in 1985, the concepts and designs for the exhibition halls were developed over the next three years and work on the exhibitions and colonnade began in 1988. The completed complex was inaugurated on 4 November 1992. Terror attack On 24 September 2002, two armed terrorists attacked Akshardham, killing 33 people and wounding 70. The Indian National Security Guard intervened and ended the siege by killing both terrorists. A prayer assembly led by Pramukh Swami was organized for 29 September 2002, with attendees praying for the departed souls and their families and also for communal and sectarian peace. More than 30,000 people attended assembly. The Akshardham complex was reopened fourteen days after the attack. Pramukh Swami's peaceful response to the incident from beginning to end has been termed by a brigadier general involved in the operation as the \\"Akshardham Response\\" and described as a model to be emulated to maintain peace and harmony in society.

New material from La√±o, Spain described by Diaz et al. (2013), which includes cervical, dorsal and caudal vertebrae, dorsal ribs, and a haemal arch, has been assigned to Lirainosaurus.D√≠ez D√≠az, V., Pereda Suberbiola, X. and Sanz, J.L. 2013. The axial skeleton of the titanosaur Lirainosaurus astibiae (Dinosauria: Sauropoda) from the latest Cretaceous of Spain. Cretaceous Research, 43:145-160. According to Diaz et al., Lirainosaurus can be distinguished by the presence of a lamina in the interzygapophyseal fossa of the most proximal caudal vertebrae; and the spinopostzygapophyseal structure not posteriorly projected in the posterior caudal vertebrae. With respect to phylogeny, the combination of characters present in the new axial remains described, supports the placement of Lirainosaurus as a derived lithostrotian titanosaur closely related to the Saltasaurinae. The results of an unpublished SVPCA abstract published in 2016 narrow down the exact position of Lirainosaurus by placing it as closer to Alamosaurus and Opisthocoelicauda than to Saltasaurus.

It postulates that animals, people, and even well-designed machines will naturally choose the path of least resistance or \\"effort\\". It is closely related to many other similar principles: see Principle of least action or other articles listed below. This is perhaps best known or at least documented among researchers in the field of library and information science. Their principle states that an information- seeking client will tend to use the most convenient search method in the least exacting mode available. Information-seeking behavior stops as soon as minimally acceptable results are found. This theory holds true regardless of the user's proficiency as a searcher, or their level of subject expertise. Also, this theory takes into account the user‚Äôs previous information-seeking experience. The user will use the tools that are most familiar and easy to use that find results. The principle of least effort is known as a ‚Äúdeterministic description of human behavior‚Äù.Bierbaum, Esther: ‚ÄúA Paradigm for the ‚Äò90s‚Äù, American Libraries, 21(1): 18. The principle of least effort applies not only in the library context, but also to any information-seeking activity. For example, one might consult a generalist co-worker down the hall rather than a specialist in another building, so long as the generalist's answers were within the threshold of acceptability. The principle of least effort is analogous to the path of least resistance.  History  The principle was first articulated by the Italian philosopher Guillaume Ferrero in an article in the Revue philosophique de la France et de l'√©tranger, 1 January 1894.Ferrero, G., 1894. L‚Äôinertie mentale et la loi du moindre effort. Revue Philosophique de la France et de l‚Äô√âtranger 37, 169‚Äì182. About 50 years later this principle was studied by linguist George Kingsley Zipf who wrote Human Behaviour and the Principle of Least Effort: An Introduction to Human Ecology, first published in 1949. He theorised that the distribution of word use was due to tendency to communicate efficiently with least effort and this theory is known as Zipf's Law. Within the context of information seeking, the principle of least effort was studied by Herbert Poole who wrote Theories of the Middle Range in 1985. Librarian Thomas Mann lists the principle of least effort as one of several principles guiding information seeking behavior in his 1987 book, A Guide to Library Research Methods. Likewise, one of the most common measures of information seeking behavior, library circulation statistics, also follows the 80-20 rule. This suggests that information seeking behavior is a manifestation not of a normal distribution curve, but a power law curve.  Applications  The principle of least effort is especially important when considering design for libraries and research in the context of the modern library. Libraries must take into consideration the user's desire to find information quickly and easily. The principle must be considered when designing individual Online Public Access Catalogs (OPACs) as well as other library tools. The principle is a guiding force for the push to provide access to electronic media in libraries. The principle of least effort was further explored in a study of library behavior of graduate students by Zao Liu and Zheng Ye (Lan) Lang published in 2004. The study sampled Texas A&M; distance learning graduate students to test what library resources they used, and why they used those particular resources. In this study the Internet was used the most, while libraries were the next most used resource for conducting class research. The study found that most students used these resources due to their quickness and ability to access from home. The study found that the principle of least effort was the primary behavior model of most distance learning students.Zao Liu and Zheng Ye (Lan) Lang. ‚ÄúFactors Influencing Distance-Education Graduate Students‚Äô Use of Information: A User Study‚Äù, Journal of Academic Librarianship, 30(1), 2004. This means that modern libraries, especially academic libraries, need to analyze their electronic databases in order to successfully cater to the needs of the changing realities of information science. Professional writers employ the principle of least effort during audience analysis. The writer analyzes the reader's environment, previous knowledge, and other similar information which the reader may already know. In technical writing, recursive organization, where parts resemble the organization of the whole, helps readers find their way. Consistency of navigational features is a common concern in software design.

History Paseo in la Reforma in Lomas de Chapultepec, 24 June 1929. In the early 1920s, Mexico City suffered a housing shortage as a result of internal migrants fleeing from uncertainty in the provinces caused by the Mexican Revolution. To meet demand, the Ayuntamientos of the Distrito Federal passed various city ordinances in order to make it easier for private investors to develop urban subdivisions. Also beneficial was Article 27 of the 1917 Constitution, which was used to promote agrarian land reform and indirectly encouraged the construction and emergence of new urban developments when it prompted the change of land-use of the properties surrounding the capital. A total of 26 to 32 colonias were built as a direct result, one of which was Lomas de Chapultepec. On September 28, 1921, the corporation, Chapultepec Heights Company, was formed with the objective of developing the land acquired from the Hacienda de los Morales (also known as Rancho del Huizachal de Alberto Cuevas Lascur√°in). The company was founded by five investors (two Americans, two Mexicans and one Briton) who were able to buy the 687 hectares of the ex-Hacienda for about one cent per square meter. In 1922, Chapultepec Heights was planned by Jos√© Luis Cuevas Pietrasanta in the \\"Garden City\\" fashion. With large lots, large gardened yards, wide winding streets, gardened boulevards and scattered small shopping areas within walking distances from homes. The early settlers attracted to the area were young professionals and some of the nouveau riche revolutionaries, bureaucrats and the new business class of Mexico City. Smaller homes were built on the side streets while mostly large houses were built on Paseo de la Reforma and Paseo de Las Palmas, the two main avenues. INBA-catalogued property built in the Colonial Californiano style. This mansion was on the market for an asking price of 75.88 million Mexican pesos, or about US$6 million. Most of the early houses were built in the \\"Colonial Californiano\\" style, with stone carvings around windows and doors and pitched roofs. Many of these early homes are catalogued and protected by the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes as they have been deemed a cultural patrimony. Later on, Modern houses designed by notable architects such as Luis Barrag√°n, Juan Sordo, Ricardo Legorreta and Enrique Norten were built. Many of the houses built during the era known as the Mexican Miracle are still standing, and constitute the largest mansions in the western area of the city. The colonia grew in size, being mostly inhabited by the upper class and by wealthy immigrants that arrived in Mexico in the early 20th century. Today, Lomas de Chapultepec is inhabited by Mexican and foreign business professionals, celebrities, politicians and other wealthy individuals. In recent years commercial and business areas have developed on the edges of the neighborhood and there are also various embassies located in the area. Sales in the northwestern part of Mexico City, which includes luxury areas like Lomas de Chapultepec, generally average US$1 million per house. =Use of \\"Lomas\\" in subsequent developments= Starting in the early 1950s, riding on Lomas de Chapultepec's success and the glitter of its name, other developers opened subdivisions further out into adjacent Estado de Mexico with names including the magic word \\"Lomas\\" (Spanish for hills). Some of the neighborhoods that stemmed from these expansions are Lomas de Tecamachalco, Lomas de la Herradura, Lomas de las Palmas, Lomas Anahuac, Lomas Altas, Lomas de Bezares, Lomas de Santa Fe, Lomas de Vistahermosa and Interlomas. Today, the area encompassing Lomas de Chapultepec and neighboring developments is sometimes incorrectly referred to as simply Las Lomas, though locals specify which neighborhood they live in, be it Tecamachalco, Herradura, etc. Geography Lomas de Chapultepec is located in the northwestern hills of the Anahuac Valley, which is mostly contiguous with Mexico City, and was mostly created following the contour of the terrain, leaving the natural drainage as open space. The developed area was planted with a large number and variety of trees, and is now one of the most wooded areas in the city. The colonia's borders are: * On the northwest and north, the Tecamachalco area of Cuajimalpa borough (colonias Lomas de Tecamachalco, San Miguel Tecamachalco, etc.) and colonia Reforma Social * On the northeast, the Anillo Perif√©rico ring road and Polanco district * On the east, colonia Molino del Rey and the Bosque de Chapultepec * On the south, the 2nd and 3rd sections of the Bosque de Chapultepec; colonias Lomas Altas and Lomas de Reforma * On the west, colonia Bosques de las Lomas Demographics Lomas de Chapultepec is divided into eight sections, in 2005 their population was as follows: Section I had 1,855 individuals, Section II had 1,528, Section III had 3,302, Section IV had 3,161, Section V had 2,379, Section VI had 2,069, Section VII had 707, and Section VIII had 5,439. Combining for a population of 20,440 inhabitants in the colonia. =Jewish community= In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, Mexico City's Jews tended to move from Condesa, Roma and the Downtown to Polanco, Lomas de Chapultepec, Interlomas, Bosques de las Lomas, and Tecamachalco, where the majority are now based.

The park was created by an Act of Congress in 1964 to protect the Current and Jacks Fork rivers, and it was formally dedicated in 1971. The park's are used for many forms of recreation and are home to abundant animal and plant species. 1.3 million recreational visits are estimated annually. Canoeing is one of the most popular activities. Kayaking and inflatable rafts and tubes add to the volume of river floaters. Motorized boating with jonboats is also a popular activity of locals and nearby Missourians. Other activities include horseback riding, hunting, hiking, fishing, camping, birdwatching, nature photography, and sightseeing. The park service promotes the Current River as one of the midwest's best float streams, in part due to the contributions of some of the nation's largest springs. The headwaters of the Current River begin at the confluence of Pigeon Creek and Montauk Springs in Montauk State Park. Other notable springs along its course include Welch Spring, Cave Spring, Pulltite Spring, Round Spring, Fire Hydrant Spring, Ebb and Flow Spring, Blue Spring, Big Spring, and Gravel Spring. The park contains the United States' largest concentration of first magnitude springs (which are defined as having average flow of more than ) in dolomite rock. The only comparable spring collections are the limestone springs of North Florida near Gainesville and the igneous-based springs of Idaho's Snake River. The park includes many caves, including Round Spring Caverns, which offers ranger-led tours in the summer. Other notable caves include the Devils Well sink and Jam-Up Cave.Geologic Map of the Jam Up Cave and Pine Crest Quadrangles, Shannon, Texas, and Howell Counties, Missouri United States Geological Survey The park is traversed by the Ozark Trail, a popular long-distance hiking trail that passes Rocky Falls and crosses the Current River on Highway 106 at Powder Mill. The park has resident feral horses and elk have been reintroduced on state lands nearby and are expected to eventually populate the park. Historic sites include Alley Spring and Alley Spring Roller Mill, Buttin Rock School, Walter Klepzig Mill and Farm, Reed Log House, Welch Hospital and many CCC structures at Big Spring. Facilities include campgrounds along the two rivers at Alley Spring, Round Spring, Pulltite, Two Rivers and Big Spring. There are also a number of less developed primitive campsites, and there are group sites at Akers, Round Spring, Alleywww/nps.gov/ozar and Pulltite. Park rangers present campfire programs and nature hikes at the bigger campgrounds during the summer. There are also traditional craft demonstrations and free bluegrass concerts. The park is located mostly in Shannon County with parts extending into Carter, Dent, and Texas counties. Communities surrounding the Ozark National Scenic Riverways include Eminence, Licking, Salem, Van Buren, Ellington, Bunker, and Mountain View, Missouri. Administrative offices are located in Van Buren. The Big Spring Historic District in Carter County was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.alt= History alt= Sarvis (2002, 2000) traces the controversy over the creation of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways (ONSR) in southeastern Missouri. Boasting clear rivers and spectacular landscape, the area saw a political contest for control of river recreational development between two federal agencies, the National Park Service (NPS) and the Forest Service. Local residents opposed NPS plans that included eminent domain acquisition of private property. Both agencies presented rival bills in Congress, and in 1964 the NPS plan was selected by Congress. In the long run the NPS has successfully accommodated and supervised OSNR recreation for two million visitors a year. By contrast, the Forest Service's nearby recreational activities have handled no more than 16,000 visitors yearly.Will Sarvis, \\"A Difficult Legacy: Creation of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways,\\" Public Historian, Winter 2002, Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp 31-52; and, \\"Old Eminent Domain and New Scenic Easements: Land Acquisition for the Ozark National Scenic Riverways,\\" Western Legal History, 13:1 (Winter / Spring 2000): 1-37.

He was repeatedly questioned by police and reporters for possible leads, but was of little help. Some Hearst reporters suspected that Peavey was withholding information, so they kidnapped him a few weeks after the crime and attempted to scare him into a confession.Los Angeles Times (February 22, 1922), reprinted in Taylorology, p. 6. For the perspective of one of the kidnappers, see Florabel Muir, Headline Happy (Holt, 1950), pp. 100-102.

It usually appears as raised, spongy lesions, and typically occurs in children. This honeycomb is a painful inflammatory reaction with deep suppurative lesions on the scalp. Follicles may be seen discharging pus. There may be sinus formation and rarely mycetoma- like grains are produced. It is usually caused by dermatophytes (fungal infections of the skin affecting humans and animals) such as Trichophyton verrucosum, T. mentagrophytes, and Microsporum canis. Treatment with oral griseofulvin common. Symptoms There may be loss of hair as hair will come out easily. Sometimes, there is growth of organisms. Lymph and fever symptoms may be present. This condition can be mistaken for a case of impetigo. Diagnosis The basis for the diagnosis of Kerion is clinical finding, positive microscopic examinations (such as positive KOH preparation, Lactophenol cotton blue wet mount, Chicago sky blue stained (CSB) slide, Calcofluor white stained slide, Periodic acid‚ÄìSchiff stained slide, and Gomori‚Äôs methenamine silver stained slide), mycological culture and modern molecular tests (such as PCR-reverse line blot test, real-time PCR test, multiplex PCR test, PCR-ELISA test, and MALDI-TOF test) of clinical specimens.

Mentagrophytes, in kerion infection caused by Trichophyton verrucosum Invaded hairs show an ectothrix infection and fluorescence under Wood's ultra-violet light has been noted in cattle but not in humans. Treatment Unlike most other manifestations of Tinea dermatophyte infections, Kerion is not sufficiently treated with topical antifungals and requires systemic therapy. Typical therapy consists of oral antifungals, such as griseofulvin or terbinafine, for a sustained duration of at least 6-8 weeks depending on severity.

It was written using Allegro Common Lisp and used in the development of the entire Jak and Daxter series of games.  Design  GOAL's syntax resembles the Lisp dialect Scheme, though with many idiosyncratic object-oriented programming features such as classes, inheritance, and virtual functions. GOAL encourages an imperative programming style: programs tend to consist of a sequence of events to be executed rather than the functional programming style of functions to be evaluated recursively. This is a diversion from Scheme, which allows such side effects but does not encourage imperative style. GOAL does not run in an interpreter, but instead is compiled directly into PlayStation 2 machine code to execute. It offers limited facilities for garbage collection, relying extensively on runtime support. It offers dynamic memory allocation primitives designed to make it well-suited to running in constant memory on a video game console. GOAL has extensive support for inlined assembly language code using a special \`rlet\` form, allowing programs to freely mix assembly and higher-level constructs within one function. The GOAL compiler is implemented in Allegro Common Lisp. It supports a long term compiling listener session which gives the compiler knowledge about the state of the compiled and thus running program, including the symbol table. This, in addition to dynamic linking, allows a function to be edited, recompiled, uploaded, and inserted into a running game without having to restart. The process is similar to the edit and continue feature offered by some C++ compilers, but allows programs to replace arbitrary amounts of code (even up to entire object files), and does not interrupt the running game with the debugger. This feature was used to implement code and to level streaming in the Jak and Daxter games.  Uses  GOAL's first use was for the Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy game. The predecessor language, Game Oriented Object Lisp (GOOL), was also developed by Andy Gavin for Crash Bandicoot. Since Naughty Dog no longer employs GOAL's primary development and maintenance engineer, and they were under pressure from their new parent company, Sony, to share technology between studios, Naughty Dog transitioned away from Lisp: However, they have since resumed using it for scripting on some PlayStation 3 games, including The Last of Us.

It was founded in October 1990 by Hiroshi Hamagaki and Tomo Kimura, who left Sega to form the company. The company is best known for its racing game titles. History In its early years, Genki released games in different genres, looking for its niche. On one end of the spectrum, there was Devilish, a game similar to Arkanoid that was released for Sega's Game Gear and Mega Drive systems in 1991. On the other end, there was Kileak: The DNA Imperative, a first-person mecha shooting game for the PlayStation which was released in 1995 and received a sequel, Epidemic. They developed two MotoGP video games for the SNES: GP-1 (1993) and GP-1 RS: Rapid Stream (1994). Genki found its niche in 1994 with the release of Shutok≈ç Battle '94 Keichii Tsuchiya Drift King for the SNES‚Äîthe first in a long- running series of racing games. Shutokou Battle 2 followed one year later, in 1995, and was also for the SNES. Within the same year, Genki shifted towards developing 3D games, continuing the Shutokou Battle series with Highway 2000 (released in Japan as Wangan Dead Heat) on the Sega Saturn. Genki also produced major titles for both the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 consoles in the following two years, including another Shutokou Battle game for the PlayStation (known in Western markets as Tokyo Highway Battle) and Multi- Racing Championship for the N64. They also developed Jade Cocoon for the PlayStation in 1998. =Shutokou Battle= Continuing with the genre that is consistently the most rewarding for them, Genki continued the Shutokou Battle series, releasing a title for Sega's Dreamcast console in 1999. This game was released in Western markets, where it came to be known as Tokyo Xtreme Racer (U.S.) and Tokyo Highway Challenge (Europe). The Dreamcast version of Shutokou Battle enjoyed much greater success than any of its predecessors, and was followed by Shutokou Battle 2, also for the Dreamcast, and Shutokou Battle Zero for the PlayStation 2. In 2002, Namco partnered with Genki to produce a game based on Michiharu Kusunoki's racing manga, Wangan Midnight. Namco developed the arcade version (based largely on Genki's gameplay mechanics), which was imported to the U.S., while Genki developed the Japan-only PlayStation 2 version. In 2003, Genki released Shutokou Battle 01 (Tokyo Xtreme Racer 3) for the PlayStation 2. Namco partnered with Sega to continue its arcade game series with the release of Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune in 2004. Genki released the Japan-only home version for PlayStation 3 (with online mode) and PlayStation Portable in June and September 2007. =GRP: Genki Racing Project= In response to the success of their racing titles, particularly the Shutokou Battle series, Genki established a division dedicated to that genre in 2003 called the Genki Racing Project, or GRP. The GRP's first title was Shutokou Battle Online for Microsoft Windows, which tried to apply an MMO-like aspect to the existing gameplay of the series. The game and its update version were sold only in Japan but were playable from anywhere as free online trial versions (with free registration) were available for download on the game's website. Less than two months later, the GRP released the touge-based drifting/racing game Kaido Battle, which was a rather stark departure from the Tokyo-highway-based Shutokou Battle series. Kaido Battle was followed by Kaido Battle 2: Chain Reaction in 2004 and Kaido Battle: Touge No Densetsu in 2005. All three titles were released for the PS2. Kaido Battle and Kaido Battle: Touge no Densetsu were both released in North America, under the titles Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift and Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Drift 2, respectively. By comparison, European markets received Kaido Battle 2: Chain Reaction and Kaido Battle: Touge no Densetsu, under the names Kaido Racer and Kaido Racer 2. In 2005, Genki released Shutokou Battle: Zone of Control for PlayStation Portable. It was translated and released in the US as Street Supremacy. Among the various other adaptations of Shutokou Battle lies another unique title marketed as a \\"Car Tuning RPG\\", called Racing Battle: C1 Grand Prix, which was released for the PS2 in 2005. Racing Battle departed from highway and mountain racing, focusing on real-life tracks such as Tsukuba Circuit, Suzuka Circuit, and TI Circuit. The last Shutokou Battle game at the time of this writing is Shutokou Battle X for the Xbox 360, which was released in 2006 and is known in western markets as Import Tuner Challenge. In late 2006, Genki announced they would end the Shutokou Battle series, and eventually shut down the Genki Racing Project, as a part of the cost-cutting operation. But now, on 22 July 2016 after 10 years, Genki announced that the Project would be rebooted, hoping to have new Shoutoku and/or Kaido Battle games for the Next Generation. In December 27, 2016, they release the countdown for the new racing project. The countdown ended up being for the 2017 Shoutoku Battle Mobile Game, Shoutoku Battle Xtreme, which servers went offline in November of that year. =Kengo= Kengo (Ââ£Ë±™) is the name of a series of fighting video games developed by Genki. Kengo is considered a spiritual successor to the Bushido Blade game series for the PlayStation. Genki released four games in the series, between 2000 and 2006, for the Playstation 2 and Xbox 360: Kengo: Master of Bushido, Kengo 2, Kengo 3 and Kengo Zero (Kengo: Legend of 9 in North America). =Recent works= In 2010, Genki created an alternate reality game division called Genki ARG, to replace the discontinued Genki Racing Project. This division was closed in late of March 2012. The Shutokou Battle series was revived with a Mobage version for mobile phones released on January 27, 2017. This is the first Shutokou Battle game after GRP was discontinued. On September 28 of the same year, however, Genki announced that they were discontinuing the service, to be shut down in end-November.„ÄåÈ¶ñÈÉΩÈ´ò„Éê„Éà„É´XTREME„Äç„Çµ„Éº„Éì„ÇπÁµÇ‰∫Ü„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„Çã„ÅäÁü•„Çâ„Åõ See also *:Genki (company) games Notes External links * *MobyGame's entry on Genki Software companies based in Tokyo Video game companies established in 1990 Video game companies of Japan Video game development companies Video game publishers Japanese companies established in 1990 ","title":"Genki (company)"},{"id":"4993449","text":"Jesse Ketchum (March 31, 1782 - September 7, 1867) was a tanner and political figure in Upper Canada. He was born in town Spencertown, New York in 1782 to parents Mollie Robbins Ketchum and Jesse Ketchum Senior.Hathaway, E. J. Jesse Ketchum And His Times, Chapter 1. After his mother died, he was taken into a foster home; his foster father was a tanner. He ran away from home in 1799 and joined his brother Seneca (1780-1850), who was farming north of York (York Mills, now part of Toronto) in Upper Canada. At the beginning of the War of 1812, he purchased a tannery from a recent immigrant from the United States who had decided to return there after war was declared. Ketchum joined the local militia, but his loyalty was called into question after York was temporarily held by the Americans. After the war, he helped fund the rebuilding of the bridges over the Don River and also contributed to the building of the first common school at York. Ketchum was known for his great and practical interest in schools, a quality that won him the affectionate title, \\"Father Ketchum.\\" He taught Sunday school at the Methodist church, which he helped to establish in the area. He opposed the exclusive control of the clergy reserves by the Anglican church and was known as an opponent of the Family Compact. In 1828, he was elected to represent York in the 10th Parliament of Upper Canada; he was reelected in 1830 but did not run again in 1834. Although he had supported William Lyon Mackenzie in the assembly, he did not take part in the Upper Canada Rebellion. Shortly after the rebellion, he relocated his tannery to Buffalo, New York, although he continued to live in Toronto. In 1845, he moved to Buffalo, leaving his property in Toronto to his children from his first wife. He continued to be a generous benefactor to the community there until his death in 1867. Ketchum contributed to churches and schools in Buffalo. Ketchum Hall at Buffalo State College was named in his honour, as is Ketchum Street on the city's Lower West Side. Ketchum is buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo. A public school in Toronto was named \\"The Jesse Ketchum School\\" and in Buffalo twelve schools were named after him. His brother Seneca remained in Canada and died in York Mills in 1850.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/ketchum_seneca_7E.html Jesse Ketchum's home was a recognized landmark in early York, largely because of its size. It was a large frame building, painted white, and stood at the north west corner of Yonge and Adelaide. Henry Scadding described the home as a \\"dwelling in the American style with a square turret bearing a rail rising out of the ridge of the roof.\\" The date of construction is unknown, but estimated to be around 1813 or 1814. John Ross Robertson claims Jesse Ketchum was one of the first people to bring sidewalks to York after he placed tanned bark outside of his home. The house was ultimately destroyed around 1838 or 1839 to cut up the land for building lots. Ketchum Manufacturing, a company now located in Brockville, Ontario, which manufactures agricultural supplies, was founded by Jesse Ketchum's descendants in Ottawa, Ontario. Jesse Ketchum Public School, Toronto Jesse Ketchum School was founded in the Town of York in 1832 in Yorkville area, 2 years prior to the founding of the City of Toronto in 1834. The current Jesse Ketchum Junior and Senior Public School building at 161 Davenport Rd dates to 1914.http://www.tdsb.on.ca/Findyour/Schools.aspx?schno=5239 A nearby park, Jesse Ketchum Park, is also named for him as both it and the school were made possible by donations by Ketchum. Famous former students include the Conacher family of sporting fame, actors Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) and Zack Ward (A Christmas Story), and noted citizen scientist R. Vishnu Bose. Temperance Hall Ketchum donated land to be used to build a Temperance Hall at 21 Temperance Street in 1846-1848.http://canada.yodelout.com/toronto-normal- school-temperance-hall/ Used as temporary home to Toronto Normal School 1847 to 1852.

It is published biweekly in London, and is also posted online. It began publication in September 2002, and its 108th issue was released in mid- September 2007. The magazine features stories, poems, riddles, and puzzles. The site states it is for \\"the young builders of the future\\". It has a link to the Hamas non-official website PIC, so Israel said that it is owned by Hamas.  Criticism  Several Israeli reviews and news coverages of the site describe it as hate-mongering and accuse it of glorifying death and suicide for Allah. =Glorification of operations= According to MEMRI, the magazine includes incitement to jihad and martyrdom and glorification of terrorist operations and of their planners and perpetrators. as well as characterizations of Jews as \\"murderers of the prophets\\" and laudatory descriptions of parents who encourage their sons to kill Jews. In each issue, a regular feature titled \\"The Story of a Martyr\\" presents the \\"heroic deeds\\" of a mujahid from one of the organisations who died in a suicide operation (including operations against civilians) or who was killed by the IDF. MEMRI also says that the magazine includes illustrations of figures (including child warriors) who embody the ancient Islamic ethos of jihad and martyrdom, presenting them as role models. These include the magazine's titular character, Al-Fateh (\\"The Conqueror\\") ‚Äì a small boy on a horse brandishing a drawn scimitar ‚Äì as well as children carrying guns, and photos of Hamas fighters launching Qassam rockets. The Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies (C.S.S) and others argued that \\"Issue number 38 of Al-Fateh, includes a photograph of the severed head of a female suicide bomber.\\" The Anti-defamation League reported that an issue from 1 March 2006 (after Hamas won control of the Palestinian parliament) highlights Hamas suicide bomber, Nassim Jabari, who participated in an August 2004 attack that killed 16 people in Israel. The issue also shows a figure (below) of a girl throwing stones from a slingshot, and a poem next to the figure which in part reads: \\"The blood of the shahid has taught us/that martyrdom is like a new life‚Ä¶/and indeed martyrdom is an evident victory.\\". An issue from 1 May 2007 includes a \\"games\\" section with a virtual \\"Chutes and Ladders\\" board game consisting of images of Israeli soldiers with snake bodies and tongues and caricatures of children throwing stones, titled \\"The Palestinian kid and the Israeli soldier\\". According to PMW, suicide terror for children is glorified on Hamas children's website. On 15 March 2006 the website posted a short fictional story for children, glorifying a young girl's suicide terror attack. It describes how she calmly progresses, step by step, planning and executing her death in a suicide terror attack. The girl heroically leads \\"Zionist soldiers\\" to their death, all the while knowing she will be killed along with them. In death she is said to be \\"smiling, lying on the grass, because she died as a Shahida (Martyr for Allah) for Palestine.\\" The story is entitled \\"A Palestinian Girl's Heroism.\\" The ADL stated that the website also \\"advocates hatred of Jews\\". MEMRI reported that Issue No. 35 tells of a girl named Asra who accompanies her grandmother on a visit to Palestinian prisoners in an Israeli jail. She asks her grandmother about the peace \\"that everyone is talking about,\\" and her grandmother replies: \\"Do not forget, Asra, that we are dealing with the Jews, whom the Koran describes very explicitly. All these descriptions are clearly confirmed by today's [reality]. The Koran gives a very accurate characterization [of the Jews]. For example... they lie. In the past, they murdered the envoys of peace, prophets whom Allah had sent to [bring] justice and peace [to the world] and to deliver people from the darkness into the light. [The Jews] killed them, and also tried to kill the Prophet Muhammad in Medina. Today, they kill the followers of God's messenger.\\"  Response  After PMW publicized that the Hamas children's website was encouraging children to seek martyrdom, the Russian server (CORBINA TELECOM Network Operations) immediately closed down the website on 9 March 2006. However, the site reopened a couple of days later and is now being hosted by a Malaysian web-hoster. Hamas has denied involvement in the website. Farhat Abu-Assad, a Hamas official in Ramallah, told The Jerusalem Post that many Islamic sites sympathise with Hamas \\"but that does not make them Hamas Web sites. The [people who run these sites] are private individuals that might sympathise with Hamas, but Hamas does not recognise these Web sites.\\". However, according to Palestinian Media Watch, a man by the name of Nizar Hussein who sits in Lebanon runs the children's Hamas website, and works together with leading Hamas official in Lebanon, Osama Hamdan.

It is designated as a National Historic Site of Canada. Fort Chambly was formerly known as Fort St. Louis. It was part of a series of five fortifications built along the Richelieu River to protect travellers on the river from the Iroquois. The region is informally known as la Vall√©e-des- Forts. History Fort Chambly at the foot of the Chambly rapids on the Richelieu River in Quebec, Canada, was built by the French in 1711. It was the last of three forts to be built on the same site. The first ‚Äî then called Fort Saint Louis ‚Äî was constructed in 1665 by captain Jacques de Chambly, to protect New France from Iroquois attacks. Fort Chambly 1840 by William Henry Bartlett After minor repairs, the fort was burned by the Indians in 1702,Encyclopedia of Quebec History, Fort Chambly ‚Äì accessed May 31, 2008 but was reconstructed the same year. By then it was already known as Fort Chambly. However, with the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701, the war between the French and Iroquois was over. Also at this time the War of the Spanish Succession broke out, and boiled over into the colonies of France and England. Thus, to defend against a more powerful European attack, including the threat of cannon fire, Governor Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil ordered that the fort be rebuilt in stone in 1709. The engineer responsible for the design and construction of the new fort was Josu√© Boisberthelot de Beaucours. He also oversaw major improvements carried out on the fort between 1718 and 1720, modifications he felt would greatly increase the fort's defenses. For many years Fort Chambly was the main footing of the defensive chain of fortifications along the Richelieu River, which was the easiest invasion route into New France. However, with the construction of Fort Saint-Fr√©d√©ric (1731) and Fort Saint- Jean (Quebec) (1748) further south, Fort Chambly lost most of its defensive purpose and so was converted into a warehouse and rally-point for soldiers, although the fort was never abandoned. With the Seven Years' War, Fort Chambly was re-fortified and reoccupied, although it failed to stop the British from approaching Montreal and Quebec City. The substantial stone structure which still stands today was lost to the British in August 1760 in the Montreal Campaign during the French and Indian War. Captured by American forces on October 20, 1775 during the American Invasion of Canada of 1775‚Äì76, it was held until the spring of 1776 when it was evacuated and burned, as the Americans retreated southward to Fort Ticonderoga. Subsequently, prisoners-of- war from the Continental Army, including Colonel William Stacy, were held at Fort Chambly until the end of the American Revolutionary War. After the Fenian Raids in the 1860s, during which the fort was reoccupied, it was allowed to fall into ruin. In 1881 a citizen of Chambly, Joseph-Octave Dion, personally repaired and restored the site. In the 20th century the Canadian government recognized Fort Chambly's cultural and historical worth and undertook its maintenance. Between 1965 and 1985 extensive archaeological digs were carried out, and today a fully reconstructed version of the final phase of Fort Chambly (1718‚Äì1720) is maintained by Parks Canada and is open to the public as the Fort Chambly National Historic Site of Canada. http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage- display.aspx?id=13717&page;=1 Fort Chambly National Historic Site of Canada Legacy On 28 June 1985 Canada Post issued 'Fort Chambly, Que.' one of the 20 stamps in the \\"Forts Across Canada Series\\" (1983 & 1985).

He was born in Thornbury, South Gloucestershire, England in 1794 and came to Upper Canada with his family around 1808. He studied law in York (Toronto). He served as lieutenant in the local militia during the War of 1812. He lived in Vittoria until 1816, then moved to Dundas. He became the first clerk of the peace for the Gore District. Rolph was apparently resented by the Tories of the region and, in June 1826, was tarred and feathered by a group of masked men who claimed that Rolph had been sleeping with his female servant. Several leading Tories were later arrested and sued for trespass and assault. Rolph represented Halton in the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada from 1828 to 1830 as a Reformer. He died in Dundas in 1875. His brother John was also a member of the assembly.  References  *Becoming Prominent: Leadership in Upper Canada, 1791-1841, J.K.

Edvin Marton (born Lajos Edvin Cs≈±ry, February 17, 1974, Vylok, Ukraine) is a Ukrainian-born Hungarian composer and violinist. He became known as the violinist of the skaters, mainly because Evgeni Plushenko, St√©phane Lambiel, Yuzuru Hanyu (as a tribute to Plushenko), and other famous skaters often skated to his music.  Biography  He was born in an area of Ukraine largely inhabited by ethnic Hungarians. He was born into a musical family and by the age of four was already learning the violin from his parents. He was eight years old when accepted into that alma mater for the most talented musicians of the Soviet Union, the Central Tchaikowsky Music School in Moscow to study under Leo Lundstrem. He continued his studies with Eugenia Tchougaeva. He gave his first important concert at the age of twelve, with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra. At the age of seventeen he became a student at the Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music Budapest, in the class of G√©za Kap√°s. He took part in a masterclass given by Ruggiero Ricci, where he won the prize for the best participant. He was also the Grand Prize winner of the International Course Competition in Berlin, after having been invited by Ruggiero Ricci. Since 1993 he has been a \\"young soloist\\" for the National Philharmonic Concert Agency in Hungary. He has performed with almost all the main Hungarian orchestras, and given concerts in Austria, Italy, Germany and Switzerland. In May 1994 the famous violin teacher Dorothy DeLay invited him to the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado. where he gave a concert with Rohan de Silva. In New York he won a scholarship and was admitted to the class of Dorothy Delay at the Juilliard School of Music. His studies in New York City at the Juilliard School of Music brought professional contacts which meant changes in his musical style. There, in one of the most revered classical music environments of Juilliard, he mingled with DJs and jumped from high level classical to what is referred today as crossover. While still in his twenties, Marton had traveled to more than thirty countries and played in such renowned concert halls as the Berliner Philharmonie and Vienna's Konzerthaus. But he was looking for a change. A former classmate said of him, \\"After he graduated from the music academy the talented, jovial and rotund Lajos disappeared, only to return as a slim, easy listening, music playing Edvin Marton.\\"  Education  * In 1983 Tchaikovsky Academy, Moscow for Prof. Leo Lundstrem * in 1991 Liszt Ferenc Academy of Music (Zeneakad√©mia), Budapest * In 1994 Juilliard School of Music in New York * In 1995 graduating at Music Academy in Vienna  Awards  *At the Gala exhibitions of the Torino 2006 Olympic Winter Games, Marton played violin and performed together with figure skating Gold Medal Winners Evgeni Plushenko (\\"Tosca Fantasy\\"), and Tatiana Totmianina & Maxim Marinin (\\"Romeo and Juliet\\"). *2008 Eurovision Song Contest ‚Äî featured performer and co-writer of Dima Bilan's winning song \\"Believe\\"  Discography  Five (5) albums to date: =1996 Sarasate= # Eight Spanish Dances: Malague√±a Op.21 No 1. # Habanera # Romanza andaluza # Jota Navarra # Playera # Zapateado # Spanish Dance # Spanish Dance # Caprice Basque: Moderato # Allegro moderato # Zigeunerweisen: Moderato.

They are designed to be staged simultaneously, with the same cast in adjacent auditoria, and were published together as House & Garden. House takes place in the drawing room, and Garden in the grounds, of a large country house. Each play is self- contained (although each refers more or less obliquely to events in the other), and they may be attended in either order. As is typical of his work, Ayckbourn portrays the mostly bittersweet relationships between more or less unhappy, upper-middle-class people. The title is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the magazine House & Garden, in which country houses and gardens are often portrayed as idyllic, peaceful places. Production history After performances in 1999 at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough, the plays were staged in 2000 at the Royal National Theatre in London with a cast including Jane Asher, David Haig and Sian Thomas, and in 2001 at the Royal and Derngate theatres in Northampton and then again in 2005 at Harrogate Theatre directed by Hannah Chissick. The plays Act I of each play takes place in the morning, before lunch, and Act II in the afternoon, of a single Saturday in August. =Synopses= House In House, the marriage of Teddy and Trish Platt is breaking up because of Teddy's affair with their near neighbour Jo Mace (who is married to Giles, one of Teddy's best friends). Jake Mace, Giles and Jo's son, is in love with Teddy and Trish's politically aware daughter, Sally, although his regard for her seems not to be reciprocated. It is the day of the garden f√™te, and the French film actress Lucille Cadeau arrives to open it. The novelist and political advisor Gavin Ryng-Mayne also arrives for lunch, to sound Teddy out about continuing his family's tradition of standing for Parliament. Although Lucille speaks no English, everyone except Teddy seems to be able to speak French. Even so, Teddy hits it off with Lucille over lunch (his friends and family practically ignoring him because of his affair with Jo), but he completely fails to convince Ryng-Mayne that he is up to politics, and equally fails to save his marriage. We also witness Ryng- Mayne's callous upsetting of Sally. Trish, after a heart-to-heart talk with Jake, leaves for good, and Jake at last gets around, albeit awkwardly, to asking Sally to go out with him. Garden In Garden, preparations are underway for the f√™te, which is seemingly organised every year by Barry and Lindy Love (with minimal assistance), who are kept busy throughout the first act erecting tents and putting up side shows. We see the development of the unconventional relationship between Izzie, the Platts' housekeeper, Pearl, her daughter, and Warn, the Platts' taciturn gardener. We witness Trish's denouement with Jo. Jo, finally realising that her affair with Teddy has not been kept secret, faces up to the consequences with limited effectiveness. During an afternoon downpour, which is just one of many mishaps to befall the f√™te, we also witness the hilarious consummation of Teddy's and Lucille's infatuation. Lindy's exasperation with the boredom of her marriage to the patronising Barry finally hits home, and she quietly absconds to London with Ryng-Mayne in his Porsche. As Lucille is carted off to the alcoholics' clinic, Trish leaves, and Teddy is left alone on stage. Dramaturgy The dramatic devices employed for humour are many, such as Teddy's ironic insensitivity in asking Giles for marital advice, when the audience can see that the problem is Teddy's affair with Giles' wife. Giles extends the irony further by suggesting the problem is lack of sex. Trish spends most of House ignoring her husband, to the extent of bemoaning his absence to guests when he is actually in the room with them. In Garden there is an innovative scene where the two characters on stage (Teddy and Lucille) expound their situations and frustrations in their respective languages, and while neither understands what the other is saying each believes the other to be a kindred spirit. The chilling, merciless Gavin Ring-Mayne was perceived as a satirical portrait of the politician Peter Mandelson (indeed Paul Allen reports that some people worried that the portrait was too accurate), but Ayckbourn also sees elements of Jeffrey Archer in the character. Paul Allen has observed that Ayckbourn's range is such that he has no need to limit himself to the lampooning of just one political figure.

Its name comes from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is based on the BLEU metric, but with some alterations. Where BLEU simply calculates n-gram precision adding equal weight to each one, NIST also calculates how informative a particular n-gram is. That is to say when a correct n-gram is found, the rarer that n-gram is, the more weight it will be given. For example, if the bigram \\"on the\\" is correctly matched, it will receive lower weight than the correct matching of bigram \\"interesting calculations\\", as this is less likely to occur.

He graduated with a degree in Journalism in 1973 with a thesis titled 'Towards Informative Theatre'. Upon finishing his degree, he worked as a lecturer in Contemporary Spanish Literature at Lebanon Valley College in Pennsylvania, living in the United States during the decisive year of the Watergate case. He interviewed the editor of The Washington Post, Ben Bradlee, for the magazine La Actualidad Espa√±ola, along with other important figures at the time in US media. Lebanon Valley College presented him with an 'honorary degree' in Humanities.  Professional beginnings  From 1975 to 1980 he worked at the newspaper ABC, writing the Sunday section on political analysis called Cr√≥nica de la Semana. On 17 June 1980, at 28 years old, he was appointed editor of the newspaper Diario 16, then selling barely 15,000 copies and threatened with closure. However, within two years the newspaper had reached a circulation of 100,000 copies, and five years after that it would attain 150,000, according to figures of the OJD, the Office of Circulation Verification. The most important event of the time was coverage of the attempted coup d'√©tat on 23 February 1981. Diario 16 maintained a resolute editorial stance against those leading the coup. On 23 February 1982, on the first anniversary of the coup attempt, Pedro J. Ram√≠rez was expelled from the Court of Justice where the trial was held against those involved, as supporters of the coup refused to appear in court as long as the editor of Diario 16 was present. The Military Justice Supreme Council revoked his credentials and forced him to leave the courtroom. This incident led to a historic resolution issued by the Constitutional Court, dismissing the decision by the Military Justice and proclaiming readers' rights to information for the first time since the establishment of democracy. In 1986 he was named publications director for the newspaper's parent company, Grupo 16. He was elected president of the Spanish Committee of the International Press Institute (IPI), and in September 1988 joined the organisation's global Executive Committee. On 8 March 1989 he was dismissed as director of Diario 16 because of disagreements with the editor of the newspaper about the allegedly sensationalist tone of reports concerning the GAL (Anti-terrorist Liberation Groups). During this period, Ram√≠rez was sued several times for libel, the most serious of these being when he was found guilty on 4 October 1993 by the Supreme Court of Spain and disqualified from the exercise of journalism. This sentence was appealed, and the appeal denied and the first sentence confirmed by the Constitutional Court of Spain on 14 October 1998.  Editor of El Mundo  On 23 October 1989, seven months after his dismissal, he founded the newspaper El Mundo, along with three high- ranking executives from Grupo 16: Alfonso de Salas, Balbino Fraga and Juan Gonz√°lez. More than 50 Diario 16 journalists quit their jobs and joined the project. The parent group of the British newspaper The Guardian was one of its first shareholders, and the Italian daily Corriere della Sera invested a year later. In the 1990s, El Mundo stood out for its investigations on corruption scandals carried out by successive socialist governments, and particularly for its exclusive exposure of the socialist government's implication in the GAL plot that led to the murder of more than two dozen Basque activists, mainly in the south of France. These revelations led to trials and convictions, including those of the former Interior Minister Jos√© Barrionuevo and his associate Rafael Vera, for the kidnapping of Segundo Marey; those of General Galindo and the civil governor of Guipuzcoa, Julen Elgorriaga, for the murder of Lasa and Zabala, and that of Rafael Vera himself for illegal appropriation of funds belonging to the Ministry. In 1997, Pedro J. Ram√≠rez was appointed president of the Commission for Freedom of Expression of the World Association of Newspapers (WAN), and for many years travelled to countries including China, Algeria, Turkey and Venezuela to request the freedom of imprisoned journalists and the repeal of oppressive laws against the media. El Mundo supported the Aznar government in general terms during its first term (1996-2000), but was somewhat critical when during its second term when it decided to support the Bush policy in Iraq. On the eve of the Azores summit, Pedro J. Ram√≠rez published one of his routine Sunday letters, titled 'One Hundred Reasons against the Invasion of Iraq.' After Zapatero's rise to power, El Mundo pushed forward with the investigation of the March 11 massacre, presenting what the newspaper deemed significant flaws in the official version, but with a less rigorous investigation policy than their former exclusives during the 1990s. From the editorial perspective, it has opposed negotiations with ETA and the new Catalan Statute, which led to votes cast for the Partido Popular and the small party headed by Rosa D√≠ez during the general elections held on 9 March 2008. The Office of Circulation Verification (OJD) confirmed that during its first year El Mundo obtained a circulation of more than 100,000 copies, while in 2007 it surpassed the mark of 335,000. According to the General Study on Media (EGM), El Mundo has more than 1,300,000 readers. All of these indicators consolidate it as the second-largest national newspaper, behind El Pa√≠s. According to the OJD, at the end of 2007 elmundo.es had more than 11 million individual users per month. Based on the Alexa rankings, it was the world leader for electronic information in Spanish. In 2013 it became evident that the Rajoy government was not happy about some of the content of El Mundo, for example, the publication of text messages from Rajoy to Luis Barcenas. Ramirez blamed government pressure for his being replaced as editor in 2014, although there may have been other factors given the decline in the paper's finances since 2007. After being ousted as editor he contributed a series of Sunday letters to the newspaper for a few months,Pedro J. demandar√° a 'El Mundo' por no dejarle escribir en ning√∫n peri√≥dico. Libertad Digital before turning his attention to setting up a news website El Espa√±ol, which went online in 2015.  Sex video scandal  In October 1997 a covertly filmed sex video was circulated which involved Ram√≠rez and a woman, Exuperancia Rap√∫ Muebake. \\"El Mundo\\" convierte en conspiraci√≥n pol√≠tica la difusi√≥n de un v√≠deo sexual de su director El Pa√≠sDiario de Le√≥n report of 2002 trial Following a criminal investigation, the Madrid Court convicted the former personal aide of Felipe Gonz√°lez at the Moncloa, √Ångel Pat√≥n, the former civil governor of Guip√∫zcoa, Jos√© Ram√≥n Go√±i Tirapu, and four others, of violation of the right to privacy, sentencing them from two to four years in prison. The sentence, upheld by the Supreme Court, established that the purpose of the entrapment had been to change the editorial stance of El Mundo. His wife, Agatha Ruiz de la Prada, never did mention this matter in public.  The purchase of Recoletos  In 2007, Unedisa, the publishing company of El Mundo -already widely controlled by the RCS group, owner of Corriere della Sera- acquired 100% of the shares in Grupo Recoletos, a leader in specialised press in Spain. As a result of this operation, Pedro J. Ram√≠rez, as General Editorial Director, was put in charge of content published in newspapers such as Marca, Expansi√≥n and Diario M√©dico; magazines including Telva and Actualidad Econ√≥mica, and the television channel Televisi√≥n Digital Veo TV. Until 2014 he shared these responsibilities along with those of Editor of El Mundo.  Awards  * 1981. Golden Oscar of Communication for Best Information Contributor * 1983.

Even though the missionaries had banned traditional music, he learned to play from his brother and other village elders. His mother also encouraged him through her singing of traditional songs. As a teenager Chartwell moved to the capital, Harare, and became saxophonist with the Salvation Army band. A little later, in 1986, he joined the world-famous band Thomas Mapfumo & the Blacks Unlimited. Touring the world for eight years with that band, he was their arranger, mbira player and saxophonist. From 1994 until his death in 2019, Chartwell based himself in Britain where he continued to teach and play mbira. Chartwell had academic qualifications in music, including a degree in Ethnomusicology from SOAS in London where he also taught for many years. Chartwell's solo album, released in 2000, is entitled Voices of Ancestors. He also has several recordings on CD in which he plays with the band Spirit Talk Mbira: Ndonga Mahwe (1997), Nhimbe (1999), Dzoro (2000), and Taanerimwe. Chartwell also worked with Serenoa String Quartet to combine classical string quartet style with traditional African music. Chartwell Dutiro died in Devon surrounded by three of his nine children on 22 September 2019. A week prior to his death he was awarded an Honorary PhD from Bath Spa University.

Under Chapter 15 a representative of a corporate bankruptcy proceeding outside the U.S. can obtain access to the United States courts. It allows cooperation between the United States courts and the foreign courts, as well as other authorities of foreign countries involved in cross-border insolvency cases. Jurisdiction issues It happens with increasing frequency that a bankruptcy proceeding in one country has a connection to assets or information located in another. Because of the involvement of multiple jurisdictions, unique problems arise. In order to solve some of these problems, the United States enacted Section 304 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in 1978. Section 304 was repealed in 2005 and replaced with Chapter 15, titled \\"Ancillary and Other Cross Border Cases.\\" This section has increased the range of options available in the United States in support of foreign bankruptcy proceedings. UNCITRAL Chapter 15 incorporates the Model Law on Cross Border Insolvency drafted by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. The law provides solutions to problems which arise in connection with cross-border bankruptcy, allowing US courts to issue subpoenas, orders to turn over assets, the issuance of stays on pending actions, and orders of other types as circumstances dictate. The ancillary proceeding permitted under Chapter 15 is often a more efficient and less costly alternative to initiating an independent bankruptcy proceeding in the United States. It also avoids the conflicts which could arise between the jurisdictions involved in two independent bankruptcy proceedings initiated in connection with the same debtor. Chapter 15 also establishes mechanisms for the cooperation between US and foreign courts and representatives regarding proceedings which involve the same debtor. Discretionary assistance Whether the US courts will extend the \\"additional assistance\\" sought in connection with a foreign proceeding under Chapter 15 is a matter of discretion. The main consideration the US courts will take into account in making this decision is whether the laws of the foreign jurisdiction in connection with which the additional assistance is sought violate the laws or public policy of the United States and if the foreign courts conduct their proceedings according to basic rules of procedural fairness. Among other factors the US courts will consider how the foreign jurisdiction treats creditors, whether it prevents the fraudulent transfer of debtor's property, if US creditors are protected against prejudice in the processing of their claims there, and the manner in which assets are distributed. The court may conduct an evidentiary hearing, including the hearing of expert testimony, to determine whether the proceedings of the foreign forum are sufficiently just to grant the assistance requested. Original Chapter 15 (1978‚Äì1984) The original 1978 Bankruptcy Code had a different Chapter 15 dealing with the United States Trustee Program, which it established as a trial in some judicial districts to assume roles which formerly belonged to the bankruptcy judge and others, including the selection and oversight of private trustees in individual cases. At that time, the other chapters of the Bankruptcy Code described how bankruptcy worked in districts without United States Trustees; original Chapter 15 modified the text of the other chapters for districts with United States Trustees. Section numbers in original Chapter 15 incorporated the section numbers in the main Code that they modified; for example, section 151325 (a section of original Chapter 15) modified section 1325, which sets the requirements of Chapter 13 plans. Since the trial program was considered a success, Congress in 1984 ordered the creation of United States Trustees in all states except Alabama and North Carolina. Since original Chapter 15 is now applied in most states, its text was then merged into the main Bankruptcy Code; separate provisions were enacted for Alabama and North Carolina, where other officers of the court assume the role of the United States Trustee.

It was founded in 1667 by shipping families from the nearby village Kappeln who wanted to avoid serfdom. The local Skipper's Church was erected in 1673. Originally Arnis was a skipper town with up to 90 sailing-ships (1864). In the late 20th century four shipyards were the basis of its economy. Today Arnis is a tourism showplace.Nicolaus Schmidt, Arnis 1667‚Äì2017, Deutschlands kleinste Stadt, Wachholtz Verlag, 2017  History  Originally Arnis was a peninsula in the fjord-like Schlei. During the conflicts with the Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein and the Hanseatic League about the status of Schleswig the Danish king Eric of Pomerania ordered in 1415 the construction of two primitive castles in the Schlei, Schwonsburg and the opposite height of the today cemetery of Arnis. For better defence the isthmus between Arnis and Angeln was cut. Arnis became an island. In 1666 the nobleman Detlef von Rumohr tried to press the families of the nearby village Kappeln into serfdom. They had fought before against this noble family and now asked the Duke Christian Albrecht to help them. Because Detlef von Rumohr was an ally of the Danish King Duke Christian Albrecht responded positively ‚Äì he hoped to debilitate a political enemy. Kappeln skippers were successful, so he also hoped to establish a new prosperous port on his land and offered the island of Arnis as the place for a new settlement. To support this project he granted a charter of twenty privileges (‚ÄûArnisser Privileg‚Äú) to the families of Kappeln.Nicolaus Schmidt, Arnis 1667‚Äì2017, Deutschlands kleinste Stadt, Wachholtz Verlag, 2017, p. 35 On the 11th of May 1667 65 families from Kappeln gathered on the island Arnis to administer the oath to Duke Christian Albrecht. Detlef von Rumohr reacted with a dual strategy, he resigned the plan to force the Kappeln inhabitants into serfdom but put pressure on the emigrants. In the end only 30 houses were built in Arnis and the new settlement faced a crisis during the Scanian War and the following conflicts between Holstein-Gottorp and Denmark. In Arnis for some years more people died than were born. When Christian Albrecht's son, Frederick IV., offered a new 11 years tax exemption for new settlers Arnis began to grow and became in the late 18th and during the 19th century a prosperous skippers place with up to 1000 inhabitants and almost 90 sailing ships (1864).Nicolaus Schmidt, Arnis 1667‚Äì2017, Deutschlands kleinste Stadt, Wachholtz Verlag, 2017 Arnis skippers and shipowners were together with those from Kappeln initiative to build a new estuary of the Schlei which actually was the duty of the city of Schleswig. Because state money was not sufficient for this ambitious project private money from both skipper communities led, after several setbacks, to a final success. Today ‚ÄûSchleim√ºnde\\" is still based on the construction from the years 1794 to 1796. To push the project a skippers and shipowners society, the ‚ÄûCombinierte Schiffergesellschaft zu Kappeln und Arnis‚Äú was founded. With having also a sailors association (‚ÄûMatrosengesellschaft‚Äú) Arnis stood out among German ports.Nicolaus Schmidt, Arnis 1667‚Äì2017, Deutschlands kleinste Stadt, Wachholtz Verlag, 2017, p. 114 For centuries shipyards were typical of the economy in Arnis. The first documented construction of a ship was the ‚ÄûHoffnung‚Äú in 1728.Nicolaus Schmidt, Arnis 1667‚Äì2017, Deutschlands kleinste Stadt, Wachholtz Verlag, 2017, p. 120 With four shipyards in the second half of the 20th century the peak was reached.

The purpose of motor vehicle registration is to establish a link between a vehicle and an owner or user of the vehicle. This link might be used for taxation or crime detection purposes. While almost all motor vehicles are uniquely identified by a vehicle identification number, only registered vehicles display a vehicle registration plate and carry a vehicle registration certificate. Motor vehicle registration is different from motor vehicle licensing and roadworthiness certification. Motor vehicles may also be registered with property owners or managers to gain benefits. For example, organisations with parking facilities may require registration of a vehicle with them to allow authorised users to park there. Australia In Australia, all motor vehicles are required to be registered before being driven on public roads. Registration can be with one of the registration authorities set up by each state or territory.Road and road transport authorities These authorities also issue registration plates (commonly known as number plates), which are affixed to the vehicle when it is first registered, and registration certificates for the vehicle. Registration must be renewed annually, with the payment of a fee. A compulsory third party insurance policy is required to renew the vehicle, as well as inspections for older or commercial vehicles.http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/roads/registration/inspections/ Increasingly, many registration functions can be performed online. Some vehicles are registered with the federal government, e.g. military vehicles or through the Federal Interstate Registration Scheme (FIRS) via state or territory agencies.https://infrastructure.gov.au/roads/motor/firs/ Registration certificates record the registered owner of a vehicle, as well as the vehicle model, make, year, shape, VIN Chasis number and engine number, weights, engine capacity and number of passengers.

Along with the certificate, the agency also issues vehicle registration number plates. European Union Generally, privately built cars registered in any of the European Union countries must demonstrate compliance with a range of National regulations and EU directives, including, for example, that they have adequate seat-belt arrangement and a calculation of frontal/side impact resistance likely to protect passengers and pedestrians in certain types of accidents. Kit cars supplied as bare chassis without bodywork and with unguarded wheels do not meet EU safety criteria for registration. =United Kingdom= Vehicle registration for England, Scotland and Wales is the responsibility of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. Registration of new vehicles The United Kingdom operates a four-track type approval system that can lead to a Certificate of Conformity (CoC). The first two tracks are regular schemes for production vehicles that can be registered anywhere in the EC; the other schemes, known as National Small Series Type Approval (which consists of the SVA/ESVA) and the Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA), are intended for vehicles that are to be registered in the UK. * European Community Whole Vehicle Approval (ECWVA) is a single EC- wide Certificate of Conformity for volume manufacturers producing any number of similar vehicle types or products each year, who can then sell their wares via authorized agents in any EC country without further testing. The ECWVTA is integrated with the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe agreement of 1998 concerning the establishing of global technical regulations for wheeled vehicles, equipment and parts which can be fitted and/or be used on wheeled vehicles in diverse non-EC countries including, for instance, Russia and South Africa. * European Union Small Series Type Approval (ECSSTA) is for manufacturers selling up to 1,000 passenger cars each year of any one type. Although ECSSTA allows sales anywhere in the EU, there may be some technical and administrative requirements in some countries to ensure to ongoing adherence to the certificate of compliance, notably where small and medium enterprises act as sales agents or may offer customization services without the clear and verifiable imposition of international training and quality control standards. * Single Vehicle Approval (SVA) is for small vehicles such as ambulances and hearses which are often highly customized production automobiles and for vehicles manufactured to unrecognized standards which are imported to Britain from outside the EC. * Enhanced Single Vehicle Approval (ESVA) is for small batches of special vehicles. * Individual Vehicle Approval (IVA) is for kit cars and home-built vehicles. Of necessity‚Äîsince EC registered vehicles may circulate freely in any EC country‚Äîthese are broadly similar to registration requirements and procedures in other EC countries, although some authorities may be reluctant to admit prototypes or low-volume vehicles without very stringent testing. India Registration of motorised road vehicles in India is done by local Regional Transport Offices of the states. Commercial vehicles registered in one state cannot enter another state without a permit, which usually incurs a significant cost. Passenger vehicles registered in one state are allowed to pass through another state, but are not allowed to stay in another state for longer than a fixed number of months unless the road-tax being paid depending on Transport Rules of the States. A latest move by the Government of India may centralise the registration procedure in order to curb the corruption which prevails with all the regional transport offices. This is expected to make the registration of a vehicle valid in all states, unlike now, when many vehicle owners need to have separate registration certificates for each separate state, which is very hectic now. United States Vehicle registration in the United States is managed by each state's department of motor vehicles (DMV), which goes by different names such as the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) in Indiana and Ohio, the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) in Maryland, the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD) in Arizona, and the Registry of Motor Vehicles (RMV) in Massachusetts, etc. In some states another agency manages the same or similar functions such as the Secretary of State in Michigan or the Tennessee Department of Revenue. Passenger and commercial vehicles must be registered as a condition of use on a public road. Vehicles not used on public roads, such as tractors or vehicles whose use is limited to private property, are not always required to be registered. Vehicle registration laws vary from state- to-state. There are different types of vehicle registration including: Antique, Combo, Apportioned, Commercial, and SUB. In most U.S. states, a liability insurance policy that meets the state's auto insurance requirements must be purchased before a vehicle may be registered through the department of motor vehicles. =California= Registration is handled by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). It is the responsibility of the automobile dealerships to register new and used vehicles sold by their dealership. Dealerships employ registration specialists to accumulate and complete the paperwork necessary to title and register the vehicle. Although many dealerships are run, technologically, by large Dealership Management System's (DMS), the vast majority of work performed at the registration desk is manual. Registration clerks, up until 2006, had to track each deal using paper calendars and logbooks, a relatively inefficient process that resulted in millions of dollars in DMV fines and penalties incurred by dealerships. Technology was introduced with the introduction of the Business Partner Automation program (BPA), which allowed participating dealerships to file registrations electronically. The vast majority of vehicles registered in California are via third party transactions, where the vehicle is sold from one entity to another, without the use of a dealership. The registration of vehicles sold in this manner is done through local DMV branches or through the use of independent \\"Registration Service Providers\\". Anyone who has applied for or received a vehicle registration must notify DMV of a new residence within 10 days or face a typical fine of $178.California Vehicle Code ¬ß 4159Sacramento County Grand Jury 2009-2010 Final Report, pg. 173  See also  * Electric vehicle conversion *Motor Car Act 1903 * Type approval * Proof- of-parking  References  Vehicle law ","title":"Motor vehicle registration"},{"id":"4993756","text":"The Baroque Mariatrost Basilica on top of the Purberg hill in Mariatrost, a district of Graz, is one of the most famous pilgrimage sites of Styria in Austria. The pilgrimage church stands prominently on top of the Purberg hill (469 m) in the northeast of Graz. It can be reached using the 200 or more steps of the Angelus stair. The basilica is classified as a Baroque building. Two front towers (61 m) and a dome, visible from a great distance, are the characteristic attributes of the church, which is enclosed by two projecting wings of a former monastery once occupied by the Pauline Fathers (1708‚Äì86) and later by the Franciscans (1842‚Äì1996). The building was begun in 1714 by Andreas Stengg and his son Johann Georg Stengg and finished in 1724. The pulpit by Veit K√∂niger (1730/31) is the masterpiece of the furnishings. The frescoes on the ceiling by Lukas von Schram and Johann Baptist Scheidt are of particular importance. The main altar includes a statue of the Madonna originally created in the Gothic period around 1465, but altered to the Baroque style in 1695 by Bernhard Echter. Father David Bauer, a Canadian ice hockey coach and Basilian priest, attracted a following while coaching in Austria and conducted mass on several occasions at the basilica. On 28 October 1999 the church was nominated as a basilica minor. The Mariatrost Basilica is the second most important Marian shrine of Styria after Mariazell Basilica.

The term 'Britten-Norman Defender' relates to all militarised variants of the BN-2 product line including the BN-2 Piston Defender, BN-2T Turbine Defender (sometimes known as the Defender 2000), the BN-2T-4R Defender (also known as AEW Defender and highlighted by its large bulbous nose) and the stretched variant BN-2T-4S, designated Defender 4000 (sometimes known as D4K). Development First flown in May 1970, the Defender was based on the civilian Islander, and has a larger airframe with four underwing hardpoints for pylons to attach of fuel tanks, bombs, missiles, 7.62-mm (0.3-inch) machine-gun pods, rocket pods, flares, sensors and other stores. The BN-2B (piston version) and BN-2T (turbine version) are used in military, coastguard, and police operations in several countries. =Defender 4000= Defender of the Greater Manchester Police, England The BN-2T-4S Defender 4000 is an enhanced version of the BN-2T Defender intended for the aerial surveillance role. Compared to earlier Defenders, it has a stretched fuselage, the enlarged wing from the Trislander, a new nose structure capable of accommodating an EO/IR sensor and radar, and an increased payload. The prototype Defender 4000 first flew in 1995 and entered production from 1997. Operational history =Law enforcement use= The FBI deployed one Defender for electronic aerial surveillance on the Branch Davidians' compound during the siege of Waco in 1993.FBI brings out secret electronics weapons as Waco siege drags on, by James Adams. The Sunday Times, p. 23, 21 March 1993 In August 2017, in an attempt to calm a gang war in Copenhagen, the Danish police force used at least one of the Danish National Guard's two Defenders to fly reconnaissance missions over the city. =Military use= The Mauritanian Air Force employed six BN-2A-21 Defenders in the Western Sahara War against POLISARIO forces in 1976, losing two of them in action. A Rhodesian Air Force Alouette III, configured as a gunship or 'K-Car' (20mm cannon), shot down a Botswana Defence Force Air Wing Islander on 9 August 1979. In 1996, the Royal Cambodian Air Force deployed its three BN-2 Defenders in support of the dry season offensive against Khmer Rouge insurgents. The Defenders were armed with machine guns and rockets, and even dropped mortar rounds. One Defender was lost during the operation. In 2014 the Philippine Navy sent one of its Defenders to assist a multinational search and rescue party led by the government of Malaysia in search of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370. United Kingdom In January 2004, the British Army placed an urgent order for four BN-2T-4S Defender 4000 aircraft designated the AL Mk 1 for ISTAR missions in Iraq. The Defender was to be configured similar to the Army Islander AL Mk 1 and Defenders in use with Hampshire Constabulary and Greater Manchester Police. In October 2004, the first aircraft was delivered to No. 1 Flight AAC and deployed to Iraq that month. The final Mk 1 was delivered in September 2006 to No. 651 Squadron AAC which had been reformed to operate the Defender. The Mk 1 was fitted with a Wescam MX-15 Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) turret under the nose, cabin- mounted cameras, COMINT and C2 equipment. During the fleet's bi-annual return to the UK for in-depth servicing new ISTAR equipment was fitted. A second order was placed for four fully re-designed aircraft designated the Mk 2 and a trainer. In September 2008, the first Mk 2 aircraft and also one Mk 1 upgraded to Mk 2 standard were delivered. The Mk 2 was fitted with TCAS, EGPWS, improved DAS, improved avionics suite and had ISTAR equipment enhancements. The Mk 2 had a longer endurance to the Mk 1 being able to carry more fuel and was also able to operate at a lower height. The training variant was also delivered in September 2008 designated the T Mk 3. The final Mk 2 aircraft was to be delivered by 2012 together with the three Mk 1s upgraded to Mk 2 standard. In June 2009, the Defender's deployment to Iraq ended with 651 Squadron serving continuously since October 2004 in which time it had provided over 8,000 hours in support of UK Forces. In January to February 2010, the Defender was trialled in the Middle East with a Counter-IED capability for potential use in Afghanistan. Defenders deployed to Afghanistan from November 2010 through to 2012. In 2012, Defenders flew daily missions prior to and during the London 2012 Summer Olympics. In April 2019, the Defender was transferred from the Army to the Royal Air Force with No. 1 Group.

The founder of the group was William John Stewart, the Ulster Unionist Party United Kingdom Member of Parliament for Belfast South between 1929 and 1945. He continued to take the Conservative and Unionist whip at Westminster, even though Progressive Unionist candidates opposed Ulster Unionist ones in the 1938 Northern Ireland general election and the 1943 Antrim by-election. The Association provided the main opposition in the 1938 general election, as the Nationalist Party decided to boycott in some areas, and the Northern Ireland Labour Party was only able to contest five seats. It represented a former section of the Ulster Unionist Party which opposed the official economic policy; in particular, the lack of urgency in dealing with unemployment and housing shortages. It proposed the maintenance of the union with the rest of the United Kingdom, the equalisation of taxation with the rest of the UK (which would have increased government revenues), and the use of this to tackle unemployment and provide housing with cheap rents. It also proposed to adopt the programme of the Ulster Farmers Union.John F. Harbinson, The Ulster Unionist Party, 1882-1973, p.219‚Äì222 While it soon became apparent that the Association would not win a significant number of seats, it was widely believed that Stewart would either win or come very close in Belfast Cromac, against the young official candidate Maynard Sinclair. However, Sinclair won comparatively easily, with a majority of 29% of the total of votes cast. The closest contest came in East Down, where W. J. Price came within 1,000 votes of taking a seat, but even there, where the Nationalists were not contesting, the UPUA was unable to attract tactical votes from nationalists.

Thus creditors willing to restructure can outmaneuver holdouts by using the supermajority voting features of existing bonds to secure changes, which reduce their value as they are tendered in exchange for restructured debt. Reason Government bond issued by sovereign nations are often perceived as safe investments. But over time, countries in difficulty economic situations have needed to restructure their debt structure, or see its national economy collapse. During that process, it must restructure the outstanding debt by offering its old bonds holders new instruments that reflect new financial terms. It is a process that sees the emergence of holdout creditors who refuse the proposed restructuring, posing a problem to the reorganization process the holdout problem. Therefore, the threat of an exit consent is used to encourage (or coerce) minority creditors to accept the exchange offer so they are not left with diminished bonds.

Woolworths, however, has no association to Australia's Woolworths supermarket chain. The South African Woolworths business consists of full-line fashion, home and beauty stores, many of which incorporate a premium food retail offering. Stand-alone food stores and \\"Food Stops\\" attached to Engen petrol stations are also located in urban areas. Woolworths operates 218 full line stores and 430 food stand alone stores in South Africa, with 64 stores throughout the rest of Africa. Woolworths sells clothing and accessory items under a number of premium brands, namely Studio W, RE: and Edition, with the Group‚Äôs Australian brands Country Road, Witchery and Trenery also represented. The Group's Australian- based specialty apparel and homewares retail subsidiary Country Road Group operates 557 stores (and a further 242 concession locations within David Jones), The Group operates under separate brands Country Road, Witchery, Trenery, Mimco and Politix. History Founded by Max Sonnenberg, Woolworths first opened its doors on 30 October 1931 in Plein Street Cape Town, in the dining room of the recently-closed down Royal Hotel. It was an immediate success, and two more stores were opened in the Cape. It was clear that the new business had the potential to expand nationwide except for a lack of capital. Sonnenberg's friend Elie Susman put up the money for the expansion of the business into the Transvaal and became Sonnenberg's business partner.The first Woolworths store, in the stately dining room of The Royal Hotel, Cape Town The choice of name came from Sonnenberg's friendship with a London shipper and financier called Percy (P.R.) Lewis. Lewis was a director of Australasian Chain Stores, ACS, a London shipping and finance house that had been formed to service a rapidly expanding Australian business founded by W.T. Christmas. London shippers commonly provided finance and often selected goods, sight unseen, which were dispatched to their clients. Given that the (now defunct) American company F.W Woolworth Company had no desire to trade in Australia, \\"Father\\" Christmas as he was known, used the name for his new Woolworths enterprise. Lewis proposed to Sonnenberg that ACS could add to 'Father' Christmas's order sheet and send a scaled-down quantity of every item that was succeeding in Australia, to South Africa. Sonnenberg therefore also adopted the name for his new venture. Two years later, a South African court ruled that sufficient goodwill had been established to refuse an injunction brought against the use of the name by the American retailer.  Corporate Affairs and Culture  =Good Business Journey= Started in 2007, the Good Business Journey set specific public targets in sustainability for the company. It also aims to achieve a consistent approach to sustainability issues across its global supply chain, as part of Woolworths' declared target of being the most sustainable retailer in the southern hemisphere. In 2016, the company launched its GBJ goals through to 2020 including embedding the programme into the Group‚Äôs Australian businesses which now account for over forty per cent of turnover. The WHL Group GBJ 2020 commitments include: contributing over R3.5-billion across the Group to communities over the next 5 years; saving 500 billion litres of water over 5 years; ensuring the company halves its energy impact by 2020 and achieves 100% clean energy by 2030; driving responsible sourcing of all key commodities by 2020; and affirming that every private-label product sold has at least one sustainability attribute by 2020. = Sustainable development goals = Zero packaging waste to landfill In June 2018, Woolworths announced its intention to achieve zero packaging waste to landfill by 2022, aiming to have none of their packaging end up in landfills, which would require a 100% recyclable material for its packaging and a supportive recycling infrastructure. Woolworths also committed to phasing out single-use plastic shopping bags completely by 2020. In August 2018, the Palmyra store in Claremont introduced in-store recycling vending machines.  Reusable bags  As part of the phasing out of plastic bags, Woolworths launched a new in-store reusable bag trial in October 2018. Starting on 5 November 2018, these new, entry level, reusable shopping bags were made available in four stores across the Western Cape (V&A; Waterfront, Palmyra, Pinelands and Steenberg), and have since been distributed to additional stores. Woolworths Steenberg went completely plastic bag free for the duration of the trial, with customers having the choice of either purchasing a reusable bag or bringing their own bags. In the remaining three stores, the current single-use plastic bags were still available. April 2019, additional plastic bag free stores were announced in Maroun Square, Moreleta Village and Delcairn Centre. Partnership with Pharrell Williams In 2015, Woolworths announced a partnership with Grammy Award-winning musician, record producer and philanthropist, Pharrell Williams. The strategic collaboration was the first of its kind for a South African retailer. Williams took on the role of Style Director in a collaboration across a series of sustainability-focused projects. The campaign had four layers: entertainment, showcasing young talent, fundraising for education, and driving sustainable fashion. =Black Economic Empowerment Employee Share Ownership Scheme= In July 2015, Woolworths announced the maturity of its Black Economic Empowerment Employee Share Ownership Scheme (BEEESOS). The scheme was launched in 2007 as part of the company‚Äôs Good Business Journey and is one element of the company‚Äôs commitment to socio-economic transformation. Woolworths was the first retailer to launch an empowerment scheme with BEESOS shares allocated to previously disadvantaged employees on the basis of both length of service and seniority. The scheme represented approximately 10% of the ordinary share capital of Woolworths at the time. The strong performance of the business over the past eight years has created R2.4 billion for the participants, who have also enjoyed dividends of R332 million during the life of the scheme. =World Retail Congress‚Äôs International Women in Retail: Woman of the Year award= Zyda Rylands, CEO of Woolworths South Africa received the inaugural Woman of The Year award at the World Retail Congress‚Äôs International Women in Retail Reception held on 5 April 2017. Zyda was given the special award in recognition of her work, both as an international leader, philanthropist and for her outstanding commercial success. Rylands joined Woolworths in 1996 and worked in the finance and store operation teams. She was appointed the People and Transformation Director of Woolworths in 2005 and was appointed to the Board in August 2006. Controversies =Christian magazines= In October 2010, Woolworths came under fire as they opted to remove Christian magazines from their shelves and discontinue their sale. This was met with a huge outcry from the Christian community, many voicing that they would boycott the chain store. Woolworths maintained it was strictly a business decision, with CEO Simon Susman attributing their decision to diminishing number of sales. Woolworths returned the five magazines to its shelves following a public outcry.Woolworths repents ‚Äì Times LIVE =Affirmative action= In September 2012 Woolworths was accused of racism by some groups for allegedly discriminating against white job applicants and staff. The accusations followed after claims that the retailer's advertising on their career site said its jobs are only open to \\"African, Coloured and Indian\\" candidates. Shortly after the incident, Woolworths changed the advert text to say \\"In accordance with Woolworths' Employment Equity approach, preference will be given to candidates from designated groups\\". =Plagiarism=  Pillow designs  In October 2013, rumours of plagiarism surfaced when Euodia Roets, a South African artist, accused Woolworths of using her designs that were kept as samples after contract negotiations failed. In her article Euodia Roets shows illustrative images of her design and compares it to a cushion later sold by Woolworths on which a strikingly similar design was used. Woolworths denied these allegations on their website. Cushion Design Allegation In her allegations Euodia Roets also claimed \\"If that text is in fact from Wikipedia, Wiki requires attribution on all commercial use of their text. You'd be correct in assuming Woolies did no such thing.\\" The text used on the design is an exact match of portions of text lifted from Wikipedia's Hummingbird article, without attribution, in violation of its Creative Commons License. When pressed on the matter, the official Woolworths South Africa Twitter account opined that \\"We've checked with our lawyer; Wikipedia does not own the content.\\"  Baby carriers  In January 2019, Woolworths withdrew a line of baby carriers the design of which was allegedly copied from a domestic South African designer and manufacturer (Ubuntu Baba) and sold at one third the price of Ubuntu Baba's version. The baby carrier scandal broke out after Shannon McLaughlin of Ubuntu Baba wrote a blog post about it that then became a popular issue on social media. McLaughlin alleged that a number of Ubuntu's carriers were purchased by and delivered to Woolworths Head Office in June 2017 around a year before the Woolworths carriers hit the market. Woolworths admitted that their baby carriers were derivatives of McLaughlin's product and issued an apology. Soft drink imitation In early 2012, the South African Advertising Standards Authority ruled that Woolworths' vintage cold drink range was an imitation of Frankie's Soft Drinks range. It was ruled that Woolworths intentionally copied the phrase \\"Good Old Fashioned Soft Drinks\\" to promote its own line of beverages thereby infringing on the rights of Frankie's Soft Drinks. Woolworths agreed to remove the range immediately. After the event Woolworths South Africa's CEO Ian Moir publicly stated that \\"Public opinion is so much against us and, whether we're right or whether we're wrong, customer opinion is against us.\\" References Department stores of South Africa Supermarkets of South Africa Companies based in Cape Town Retail companies of South Africa Retail companies established in 1931 Companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange South African brands ","title":"Woolworths Holdings Limited"},{"id":"4993909","title":"National Board of Review Awards 1939"},{"id":"4993921","text":"Woolworths was a New Zealand supermarket chain and a unit of Woolworths Group in Australia. The brand was phased-out in the late 2000s, with all stores rebranded as Countdown by 2009. History = 1929‚Äì1979 Woolworths = Ad for Woolworths NZ from 1949. Founded in 1929 by Percy Christmas, the chain was separated from the parent company Woolworths Group in Australia and was called Woolworths New Zealand. During this period, the chain sold mainly variety and general merchandise products trading under the Woolworths brand. In 1956, Woolworths first entered food retailing with their Food Fair store, and its first dedicated food store opened in 1963 in New Lynn. It wasn't until 1967 that Woolworths launched its first Supermarket in Henderson. Woolworths Supermarket, Upper Hutt, 1974 An article on NZ Foodstuffs history blog longwhitekid - \\"Research Sucks: Woolworths and the Advent of American Style\\" about Woolworths Food Fair and food supermarkets, and the advent of American- type convenience shopping elements, explores the discrepancies in dates and who was first in the race to become the country's first, dedicated \\"U.S.-style\\" supermarket, depending on the definition of such. Woolworths was expanding and in 1971 acquired the Self Help grocery chain and later rebranded these as Woolworths. = 1979‚Äì1990 L.D. Nathan = In 1979, Woolworths was sold to L.D. Nathan. At that time, L.D Nathan owned the Super Value North Island supermarkets. They rebranded these stores to Woolworths. 1980 saw L.D. Nathan acquire the McKenzies General Merchandise stores. These stores were then rebranded as Woolworths. With the large number of general merchandise and supermarkets L.D Nathan decided in 1985 to split the into two separate divisions: supermarkets and general merchandise. L.D Nathan rebranded their General Merchandise business in 1988 to DEKA. 1987 and 1988 saw the launch of the Price Chopper and Big Fresh brands. = 1990‚Äì2001 Dairy Farm International= Woolworths Wanganui now a Countdown Ownership changed hands in 1990 when Hong Kong's Dairy Farm International acquired the Woolworths supermarket chain. The chain had three supermarket brands, each with a different offering: Woolworths is a full-service supermarket; Big Fresh offered a themepark style shopping experience with model animals, dioramas and music; and Price Chopper was positioned in the discount sector. The Woolworths stores are broad-range supermarkets with an average size of . The Big Fresh stores were larger, with an average size of and offered the widest possible selection and excellent value. The Price Chopper stores were compact with an average size of and were limited-range discount stores located mainly in small towns. In 1995, Woolworths introduced a pilot online shopping site with a small group of users. This was early days for online shopping in New Zealand. Woolworths was a key player in introducing online supermarket shopping to the New Zealand market. In 1999, Woolworths developed a mini supermarket format at two BP fuel forecourts in a trial project, but BP pulled out of the project in 2000. In 2000, The Food Safety First (FSF) Programme was introduced in all Woolworths and Big Fresh stores nationally. This programme employed HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point). This programme was created by the Ministry of Health to identify all potential hazards and controls them before they result in food poisoning problems. In 2001, Woolworths partnered with Gull Petroleum to establish mini supermarkets at Gull fuel forecourts called Woolworths @ Gull =2001‚Äì2009 Progressive Enterprises= Former Woolworths Logo used until 2009 In 2001, Dairy Farm International sold its Woolworths New Zealand Limited business and it merged with Progressive Enterprises, the operator of Foodtown, Countdown, SuperValue and FreshChoice. In 2005, Woolworths Limited re-acquired the New Zealand unit. In 2003, the onecard was launched. This card offers shoppers exclusive discounts on products and entry into competitions. The card was previously known as the Foodtown card, but was relaunched with a new name after the merger between Progressive and Woolworths (NZ) Ltd. The card can now be used in Woolworths, Foodtown and Countdown stores. Unlike membership-loyalty schemes in most retail outlets, Woolworth's Onecard specials are the predominant visible price on member-discounted products; you have to look closer to see the non-member price, which is typically above the price available at competing supermarkets. In October 2006, Progressive Enterprises announced a Discount Fuel Scheme with Gull Petroleum and Shell to offer discounts on petrol when shoppers spend $40 or more in their Woolworths, Foodtown or Countdown Stores. This scheme is similar to the one their parent company Woolworths Limited offers in Australia. In 2008 Progressive Enterprises approached its 943 New Zealand suppliers (which Woolworths calls \\"Trade Partners\\") to use electronic commerce or EDI to integrate supply chain orders (such as Purchase Orders and Invoices) in the same way that Woolworths does in Australia.http://www.b2be.com/company_profile/case_studies/progressivewoolworths =2009‚Äìpresent: Rebranding= In September 2009, it was announced that the Woolworths brand would almost cease to exist as most of the stores would be rebranded as Countdown over a five-year period. In spite of the change of name, the new Countdown stores would adopt the design and much of the branding of Australian Woolworths stores, including their \\"W\\" symbol launched in 2008. Progress in the re-branding was swift. In August 2010, the Woolworths brand ceased to exist in the South Island. By 14 November 2011, the re-branding process was completed as the Meadowlands store was changed to Countdown. In 2018, Woolworths Mount Maunganui was rebranded as a Countdown supermarket following the closure of its shopping centre competitor and sister store of the same name on the opposite side of the shopping mall, marking the end of the Woolworths supermarket brand in New Zealand.

The monument is on the verge of collapsing, but is to be substantially rebuilt at the cost of up to ¬£4 million by the National Trust. Rockwell Green has a railway bridge, under which a steam train, the City of Truro, was first recorded travelling at over 100 mph (160 km/h) in 1904. Although this has been the subject of much debate since then, recent research supports the claim. There have been numerous requests for a plaque or monument to be placed at the Beam Bridge hotel or Westford rail bridge: however very little has come of this so far. Two large water towers, both disused, bring a small number of visitors to the village. The older (redbrick) tower was built in the late 19th century and includes a circular steel tank. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II listed building. The more recent concrete tower was built in the 1930s. A number of houses in the original village are council owned. In 1991 the population was estimated at 1,618. Since then more houses have been built and the population estimate from the 2001 census was 2,246. The population estimate in 2016 was 2,945.

He was the seventh Bishop of Boise. He retired on August 8, 2014. Early life and ministry Michael Driscoll was born in Long Beach, California. As a child, he would pretend to celebrate Mass, giving Necco candy wafers as communion to his younger siblings. He attended St. John's Seminary in Camarillo, and was ordained to the priesthood by James Cardinal McIntyre on May 1, 1965. He did pastoral work in Los Angeles and Burbank, and earned a Master's degree in Social Work from the University of Southern California in 1973. He served as Chancellor (1976‚Äì1987), Vicar for Religious and for Charities, and Vicar General in the Diocese of Orange. Episcopal career On December 19, 1989, Driscoll was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Orange and Titular Bishop of Maxita by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on March 6, 1990 from Bishop Norman McFarland, with Bishops John Steinbock and Thomas Connolly serving as co- consecrators. Driscoll was later named Bishop of Boise, Idaho, on January 18, 1999. Replacing Bishop Tod Brown, he was formally installed on the following March 17. After 15 years with the Diocese of Boise, Bishop Driscoll retired on August 8, 2014 and Bishop Peter Christensen was named his successor. Diocese of Boise Bishop Michael Driscoll apologized for his role in Orange County, California's Roman Catholic Church sex-abuse scandal. Driscoll, who was in charge of priest personnel affairs for the Diocese of Orange County from its 1976 inception until leaving for Idaho in 1999, made the stunning admission in a letter printed in the Idaho Catholic Register, stating he was \\"deeply sorry for the way we handled cases [in Orange County] allowed children to be victimized by permitting some priests to remain in ministry, for not disclosing their behavior to those who might be at risk, and for not monitoring their actions more closely.\\" A Los Angeles Superior Court judge was expected to release priest personnel files that were supposed to become public as part of a $100-million settlement reached in 2005 between the Orange diocese and sex-abuse victims, the largest in the history of the Catholic Church. Church sources say Driscoll's name is all over the documents, which molestation survivors claim will show the various cover-ups Orange County diocesan officials executed while Driscoll served as chancellor and auxiliary bishop.

These invertebrates were important reef-formers throughout the Paleozoic and the Late Mesozoic. The group was previously thought to be related to the corals and placed in the Phylum Cnidaria. They are now classified in the phylum Porifera, specifically the sclerosponges. There are numerous fossil forms with spherical, branching or encrusting skeletons of laminated calcite with vertical pillars between the laminae. Specimen of its oldest genus, Priscastroma, have been found within the Middle Ordovician Sediments. This same genus has been referred to as the species P. gemina Khrom., and is known to have been known to branch off into two forms, A and B. Form A gave rise to the genus Cystostroma while form B gave rise to the genus Labechia and its descendants. Stromatoporoids are useful markers whose form and occurrence can diagnose the depositional environment of sedimentary strata. Paleozoic stromatoporoids hosted various symbiotic endobionts such as rugosans, syringoporids, worms and cornulitids.

He insists on being hurt - whether by one he loves or by a professional dominatrix. Theo is a victim of the child welfare system. Told in reverse chronological order, Happy Baby begins when 36-year-old Theo returns to Chicago after six years away, to visit an ex-girlfriend called Maria. He knows Maria from their years growing up together in a state institution, where Theo was sent aged thirteen after his abusive father was killed and his mother died from multiple sclerosis. Theo then drifts into relationships with women who are willing to abuse him. His need for pain stems from the brutal treatment he received as a child in state custody. He recalls the memory of Mr. Gracie, a pedophile caseworker who regularly raped him when he was aged twelve but also protected him from the other boys. Elliott explores the psychology of child sexual abuse and physical abuse.

It is pastored by Reverend Colin Dye, and is the largest church in its denomination, the Elim Pentecostal Church. History The present church building was founded as Horbury Chapel, and used by the Hornton Street Congregational church, Notting Hill, in 1849. The building was purchased in 1930 by George Jeffreys. William K. Kay, Apostolic Networks in Britain: New Ways of Being Church, Wipf and Stock Publishers, USA, 2007, p. 143 This became the Bible-Pattern Church Fellowship, Elim's flagship church, becoming Kensington Temple, Church of the Foursquare Gospel in 1935. The use of the building reverted to the Elim Church in the early 1960s, and the church as it is known today was founded in 1965 by the Elim minister Rev. Eldin Corsie. Under his ministry in the late 1960s-1970s the congregation grew to 600, and then to several thousand under Rev. Wynne Lewis (later to become the Elim Church's General Superintendent) during the 1980s. Since the 1980s, nicknamed by members of the church as 'KT', Kensington Temple has planted 150 churches across London. Today, it has around 29 churches in its Kensington Temple London City Church (KTLCC) network and 4 regional Elim churches linked to it. Over the years, many churches KT has planted have opted to become independent churches or to have an official status as a self-standing Elim church. In 2000, Kensington Temple began to transition into a cell church, and today it has hundreds of cell groups meeting weekly across London. The same year, KT moved its offices from Tabernacle, an ex-BBC warehouse in North Acton, to Monarch House in North Acton. In 2005, the church moved its offices to Summit House, Hanger Lane, London. In 2020, Kensington Temple has 7,000 members. The church continues to hold services in Notting Hill, as well as running a Bible School, online learning, rooms to let, a bookshop and a publishing company; Dovewell Communications. Theology and ministry Kensington Temple's theology is Pentecostal, emphasizing the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of the church and individuals. The emphasis of ministry at KT is to equip all Christians to follow Jesus Christ and to grow both individually and collectively to be like him. Much of this equipping happens through cells, small groups that gather throughout the city. During the week, cell groups provide pastoral care, support and training for church members.

On May 4, 1932, a 32-year-old sex worker, Lilly Lindestr√∂m, was found murdered in her small apartment in the Atlas area of Stockholm near Sankt Eriksplan. She had been dead for 2‚Äì3 days before police broke into her apartment; she had suffered blunt force trauma to her head. Lilly was found completely naked and face-down on her bed. According to reports, sexual activity had taken place, with a condom found to be protruding from her anus. The detectives noted that a gravy ladle was found at the scene and on further inspection of the body, they realized her body had been drained of all of her blood. Police suspected the implement was used by the perpetrator to drink Lilly's blood. Various clients fell under suspicion but after a lengthy investigation, none were charged with her murder. The murder remains unsolved.  Crime scene  The case of the Atlas Vampire became a national sensation. May 4, 1932 Stockholm police discovered the corpse of 32-year-old prostitute Lilly Lindestrom. Lindestrom was a novelty in 1932 Stockholm. Lilly was ‚Äúcall girl‚Äù her clients contacted her in order to arrange meetings at her apartment. At the time, Lilly lived in the Atlas neighbourhood of Stockholm, which is known today as Vasastan.  The origins of the nickname  The killer became known as the Atlas Vampire. Despite the brutality of the crime scene, only a small amount of blood was actually found, thus convincing many that the killer had either drunk it all or stored it in some sort of container.  Facts about the case  Detectives noted that, judging by the decomposition, Lilly had been dead for a few days prior to being found. Also, it was theorised that Lilly's killer had slept with her before murdering her. This conclusion was reached because police found a used condom hanging from Lilly's anus.

Under this rule, if a settlement offer designated as an offer of judgment is made in civil litigation, the offer is rejected and the final court decision is less favorable than the final offer that was made, then the party who rejected the offer is subject to certain penalties. The same principle can be found in the Calderbank offer jurisprudence in England. The penalties vary by state, but often include some combination of an award to the other party of certain attorneys' fees, compensable litigation costs and prejudgment interest. Most jurisdictions limit these awards to fees, costs and interest accumulated after the offer is made or rejected. In addition, the party who rejected the offer may lose their entitlement to certain attorneys' fees, compensable litigation costs and prejudgment interest. Here again, most jurisdictions provide that the party who rejected the offer loses no more than their entitlement to the attorneys' fees, costs and interest incurred after the making or rejection of the settlement offer. The rule is not applicable in divorce proceedings or child custody proceedings. This rule was first introduced in a number of states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, subsequently adopted in 1938 in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and is currently designated as Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Many states have modified the rule by varying degrees. A survey of state Offer of Judgement Provisions has been compiled by the American College of Trial Lawyers and indicates the use by each state. In the U.S. state of Maryland the rule is only applicable to medical malpractice cases. This rule became law in the U.S. state of Georgia on 27 April 2006. In Georgia, the threshold was set such that the final court decision must be no more than 25% less favorable than the last settlement offer or the rejector becomes liable for attorney fees. However, the Georgia Supreme Court struck the statute down in 2007, on the ground that it purported to act retroactively and was therefore unconstitutional.Fowler Properties, Inc. v. Dowland, 282 Ga. 76 (2007) A new version of the statute survived subsequent challenge and is now law. Official Code of Georgia Annotated ¬ß 9-11-68 (2015) The Nevada Supreme Court's 1998 adoption of a replacement offer of judgment rule in NRCP 68 introduced a tremendous degree of flexibility to parties that choose to serve offers of judgment. This high degree of flexibility is unique to Nevada, and it has greatly complicated Nevada's offer of judgment law. In departing from prior law and from the practice in every other state, the 1998 Rule allows for the following: unapportioned offers of judgment may be served to multiple parties under limited circumstances; any unrelated parties may serve an unapportioned offer to any party; a party may draft an offer for a lump sum or for an amount that includes any combination of costs, attorneys' fees and interest; a party may draft an offer that apportions the offered amounts by claim; a party (or multiple parties) may serve an apportioned offer to multiple parties that includes a condition that it be accepted by all parties; and a party may proceed to trial but shield itself from offer of judgment penalties by \\"accepting\\" an apportioned offer of judgment that is conditioned by the acceptance of all parties where all parties do not accept.

The council had 17 elected members. The head of the council had the title of Mayor. Limerick City Council was the smallest local council in Ireland by area (20.35 km¬≤) and 30th (out of 34 authorities) in terms of population. It was abolished in 2014 when the Local Government Reform Act 2014 was implemented. It was succeeded by Limerick City and County Council. History The Council was formerly known as Limerick Corporation after the City of Limerick received its Charter of Incorporation from King John I of England in 1197. The first Mayor of Limerick was Adam Sarvant. Between 1197 and 1651, Limerick City Council was dominated by English settlers. The period between 1651 and 1656 was a break in the existence of Limerick Corporation. This came about by the surrender of the Old English settlers to Cromwellian forces in 1651. During this time, the city was administered by a Military Governor. In 1656, the Corporation was restored, but under Protestant rule. Catholics who had previously run the corporation were excluded from taking part in local government. There was a brief Catholic restoration of power in 1687 when Lord Tyrconnal, appointed by James II of England, deposed the Protestant Mayor and his sheriffs and replaced them with a Catholic Mayor, one Catholic and one Protestant sheriff. Limerick Corporation would remain in Catholic control until the Treaty of Limerick in October 1691. Between 1691 and 1841, Limerick Corporation was ruled by only a few powerful families. This period is known both as \\"The long eighteenth Century\\" and the \\"Corrupt Corporation\\". The Corrupt Corporation was brought to an end after the passing of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act 1840. The act also brought an end to Protestant control of the council. Limerick had its first female Mayor in 1921 Alderman Maire O'Donovan was appointed Mayor while the incumbent of the position was fund-raising for the newly established government of Ireland in the United States. She held the position for seven months, from 21 May 1921 until 30 January 1922. In 1934, the Free State government of Ireland enacted the Limerick City Management Act. This new law took away much of the day-to-day responsibilities from the Mayor and gave it to an appointed City Manager. Following the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001, Limerick Corporation became Limerick City Council. Throughout its history Limerick City Council has met in a number of different locations. One of the earliest known locations was the Tholsel building on Mary Street. This building had various different uses throughout its history. Prior to being demolished in the early 20th century, it was in use as a women's gaol. In medieval times Limerick Corporation moved to the Exchange building on Nicholas Street beside St. Mary's Cathedral. All that remains of the Exchange building is a row of Tuscan columns in the wall surrounding the graveyard of St. Mary's Cathedral. The Exchange was replaced by the new Town Hall on Rutland Street which was built in the 1800s. The Rutland Street site continued in use until 1990 when Limerick Corporation moved to a new purpose built building on Merchants Quay. The powers of the Mayor had been greatly reduced since the 1934 Act and the role was mainly ceremonial. The Mayor chaired city council meetings. On 28 June 2011, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government Phil Hogan announced that Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council would be merged into a single local council. The merger came into effect following the 2014 local elections. Seats For the purposes of elections, the city was divided into three local electoral areas: Limerick East (4), Limerick North (6) and Limerick South (7).

University College houses 340 undergraduate and graduate students each year from the University of Melbourne, RMIT University, Monash University Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, the Victorian College of the Arts, Australian Catholic University and other universities in close proximity to its campus. University College was renovated between 2007 and 2008 to include a new recreation complex with indoor sporting and other facilities including a design studio, TV room, gym, band room and a spacious multi-purpose area with billiard and table tennis tables. The college underwent another redevelopment in 2019, the major feature being 190 modern, en-suite student rooms with double beds. The first part of the project to be completed was the Syme Dining Hall, which opened in 2017 and features an innovative and energy efficient design reflective of the German 'Passivhaus' concept.

The Mobipocket software package was free and consisted of various publishing and reading tools for PDAs, smartphones, mobile phones, the e-readers Kindle and iLiad, and applications on devices using Symbian, Windows, Palm OS, Java ME and Psion. Amazon.com bought Mobipocket.com in 2005 and kept it running until October 2016, when it permanently shut down the Mobipocket website and servers.  History  Amazon.com bought Mobipocket.com in 2005. Amazon's acquisition was believed to be a result of Adobe Systems' announcement that it would no longer sell its eBook-packaging and -serving software. An alpha release of the Java-based version of the Mobipocket reader became available for cellphones on June 30, 2008. There is also a reader for desktop computers running Microsoft Windows, which also works with computers running Mac OS X or Linux using Wine. It has been widely reported that since Amazon's acquisition of Mobipocket, software support, user support, and platform growth ended. In December 2011 Amazon reportedly officially notified the book publishers that it was ending support for Mobipocket. The status of Mobipocket digital rights management (DRM) content previously purchased by users remains unclear since no other ebook-reader supports its proprietary DRM method. On October 31, 2016, Amazon permanently shut down the Mobipocket website and servers.Mobipocket to Turn Off Its Website and Servers on 31 October The Digital Reader  Design  The software provides: *A personalized press review using the Mobipocket Web Companion, an automated content extraction tool dedicated to press articles. *eBooks, including for each book a biography of the writer. Each downloaded eBook is registered in the My Mobipocket personal virtual library, from which a user has access to any previously downloaded eBook. *A secure reading system, as a result of the encryption of eBooks using DRM and unique signature, a timestamp added to each book at the time of purchase. Mobipocket on a Psion Series 5 PDA (with further information) Depending on the device, different functions are available. Those are usually managing of books and their metadata, assigning books to arbitrary categories, auto-scroll, rotate by 90¬∞ or 180¬∞, bookmarks, custom hyperlinks within one or between different documents, highlighting, comments and by sketches. When transferring documents to other device types, functions that are not supported on the device will be ignored, but the information one is reading will not be altered or deleted. Each book has one or two language attribute(s); in the later case it is meant to be a dictionary. As a typical example, reading a book in Fr language, a word may be selected and asked to translate with Fr ‚Üí En dictionary provided the appropriate dictionary is installed on the reader-device. Dictionaries are always unidirectional so Fr ‚Üí En dictionary cannot be used in reverse - a separate En ‚Üí Fr dictionary is needed for that.  Implementations  There is a reader for personal computers that works with either encrypted or unencrypted Mobipocket books. Unencrypted Mobipocket books can be read on the Amazon Kindle natively, as well as in Amazon Kindle programs on Mac OS X, iOS devices, Android devices, Windows, and Windows Phone devices. By using third-party programs such as Lexcycle Stanza, calibre or Okular, unencrypted Mobipocket books can also be read on Mac OS X, iOS, Android devices and Linux. Third party tools exist to decrypt encrypted Mobipocket books, allowing them to be read using software that does not support encryption. A user can thus create documents in the Mobipocket format .mobi (which is the same as the Palm OS format .PRC) and use personal comments, bookmarks, and more on all devices supporting those features. Additionally, Amazon offers a free program called KindleGen that can convert or create documents in the Mobipocket format. User-added information, such as annotations and bookmarks, are kept in separate \\".mbp\\" files by the official Mobipocket Reader and Kindle applications. In October 2012, Amazon also introduced an encrypted variant of the file (\\".smbp\\"), preventing access to the information by third-party applications. Mobipocket has not released a version for Android. Owners of Android devices can download Amazon's Kindle application from the Android App store, which can read .mobi files, though no official Mobipocket reader for the Android platform has been released. Long term plans for the Mobipocket platform are in question in the wake of Amazon's announcement of the Kindle Format 8, which moves in the direction of HTML5 and CSS3. As one of the most popular e-readers, the Kindle has great sway in the popularity of e-reader formats.  Legacy  The Amazon Kindle's AZW format (a.k.a. Kindle File Format) is basically just the Mobipocket format with a slightly different serial number scheme (it uses an asterisk instead of a dollar sign). In late 2011, the Kindle Fire introduced \\"Kindle Format 8\\" (KF8), also known as AZW3 file formatKindle Format 8, Amazon.com, October 2011. that supports a subset of HTML5 and CSS3 features, while acting as a container for a backwards-compatible MOBI content document.\\"Amazon Throws A Minor Curveball With HTML5-Powered Kindle Format 8\\", TechCrunch, October 20, 2011.

It chronicled the adventures of a superhero team based in Atlanta, Georgia. Initially known as \\"The Crusaders\\", they were renamed The Southern Knights with their second issue due to Archie Comics' Red Circle Imprint having their own group called The Mighty Crusaders, though an in-context explanation is proffered in issue #2. Jackson Guice and Chuck Wojtkiewicz both made their comics debut on the series before going on to greater fame with other titles. Cast = Team members = *Electrode (David Shenk) ‚Äî The leader of the group, a scientist whose love of comics motivated him to give himself super-powers. Can generate electricity‚Äîup to and including lightning bolts‚Äîand can fly. He often pressures the team into adopting superhero conventions such as wearing costumes and patrolling the city, but underneath such superficial pretensions, he is genuinely concerned with saving lives. *Connie Ronnin ‚Äî A former Olympic fencing silver-medalist. She can create a 'psychic sword' which causes people struck by it to react as though it were a real sword, but leaves no lasting damage. Being a projection of psychic energy, her sword is not at all inhibited by armor. Though this is never revealed in the comics, creator Henry Vogel has stated that Connie's sword works through latent telepathic and telekinetic powers. *Kristin Austin ‚Äî A petite graduate of Clemson University who is strong enough to destroy a tank and tough enough to withstand at least .50 cal. machine gun rounds. Confident, outgoing, flirtatious, and hot- tempered, she becomes enraged by any show of chauvinism. Having had her powers since early childhood, she is comfortable with being superpowered and rarely hesitates to use her strength in public. *Dragon (Moranderin/Mark Dagon) ‚Äî The last of the dragons (or so he initially believes). After his mate and child were slain by men, he found that he could take on the form of a human male. After having his revenge on the slayer of his family, he wandered the world for a thousand years until meeting up with the Knights. In dragon form he is immensely strong and tough, can fly and breathe fire. In human form he is no tougher or stronger than a normal human. He was eventually featured in his own four-issue limited series, which chronicled several of his adventures from the centuries before the other Southern Knights were born. *Aramis Merrow ‚Äî A teenage sorcerer from the 17th century who was placed in suspended animation by his parents when their coven was attacked. He was awakened by Kristin while she was exploring the house the team had moved into. His magical powers include flight, scrying, summoning illusions, mystical shields, and bolts of magical energy. His major weakness is trying to adjust to modern-day life. The only non-founding member, he was introduced in issue #5. A running joke of the series is that despite his participating in nearly all of the Knights' missions, often playing the key role to their victories, he is persistently denied membership on the grounds that their work is too dangerous for someone his age. He is finally given official membership in issue #26. The team's groundskeeper, Bryan Daniels, would sometimes don a high-tech suit of armor, designed by David Shenk, to help them out. = Enemies = *Franklin John Barl - A wealthy socialite, and neighbor to the Knights. After they rescued him, he became their official sponsor, but when he failed to relay crime reports, they publicly humiliated him in retaliation. The most frequently appearing villain of the series, he repeatedly threatens to get the team thrown out of the neighborhood, but this plot thread is never actually developed. *Dread - A sociopath who has the mental power to draw forth a person's deepest fear and make it appear real to the victim. *Viper - A powerful criminal organization led initially by Serpent, then by Zephyr Flint, then by an unidentified man. (Not to be confused with the VIPER from Champions and League of Champions.) *Carl and Larry - Two hitmen who rely on their wits. *Morrigan - A goddess who draws power from the sacrifice of living creatures. It was a worshipper of Morrigan who slew Dragon's mate. Publication history The superteam debuted in The Crusaders #1 (December 1982). The original creative team included three writers: co-creators Henry and Audrey Vogel and co-plotter/letterer David H. Willis. The team was filled out by Jackson Guice on both pencils and inks, though Guice would be penciling only on Southern Knights #2 and gone entirely after that. The series was published quarterly at first by the Guild, a company founded by Willis and Henry Vogel for the sole purpose of publishing the series. Artists came and went in quick succession, but with issue #5 penciler Chuck Wojtkiewicz and inker Steve Kent came on as the steady art team, and sales became exceptionally high for a self-published series. After issue #7, Southern Knights was taken on by Comics Interview (a company which had previously only put out magazines), and following a half-year's hiatus, went bi-monthly. Comics Interview president David Anthony Kraft quickly came up with the idea of using the tagline \\"The #1 Super Team of the South\\". However, the success of the Knights was mixed with creative turnover. Issue #8 was the first to be published by Comics Interview, and the last to feature Audrey Vogel as writer (though several later issues of the series credit her as \\"story consultant\\"). According to Henry Vogel, she gradually fell out of writing the series due to exhaustion from working a full-time job. Willis left two issues after, leaving Henry Vogel to write the series by himself. Southern Knights gradually became less oriented on long-term plot threads and character development, and increasingly consisted of short story arcs and single-issue stories. Wojtkiewicz left after issue #11, and with issue #13 Mark Propst began both penciling and inking the Knights. The look he brought to the series broadened the series' readership, and Comics Interview began publishing numerous Southern Knights spin-offs, mostly using reprints. For instance, a \\"Dread Halloween Special\\" was actually just a reprint of Southern Knights #14, and a three-issue Aramis limited series was simply a reprinting of select Aramis appearances from issues #5-26, with brief textual segues. The Southern Knights also guest-starred in Aristocratic Xtraterrestrial Time-Traveling Thieves (vol.2) #1. Propst left the series after issue #19, and from that point on Southern Knights would be drawn only by short-term or fill-in artists. Ultimately the series's popularity faded, and it was canceled with issue #33 (June 1989), though a Christmas issue would be published at the end of the year. From 1986 to 1989 Comics Interview released a series of collections of the title. Rather than being comic-sized reprints like the soon to be standard trade paperback, these collections were 8 1/2\\" by 11\\" and collected fewer issues than a typical trade paperback.

Parts two and five were published as Southern Knights #35 and 36, and both the Knights themselves and their supporting cast figured prominently throughout the crossover. Though all the installments are credited as being co-written by Vogel, in fact his role was limited to the crossover's basic plot; the scripting and issue-by-issue plotting were done solely by Flare/League of Champions writer/editor Dennis Mallonee. Mallonee gave the series a more character-driven approach, and also introduced a romance between Kristin and Aramis. Propst, having since become regular artist on Flare, inked most of the crossover. Mallonee expressed hope that Heroic would be able to continue the series beyond the crossover, but interest proved insufficient, and Southern Knights #36 is the final issue to date. In 2010, Heroic reprinted \\"The Morrigan Wars\\", with color added, in Champions #47-50 and Flare Adventures #27-28. This was the first time any of the Southern Knights' adventures were published in color.

Pre-Portuguese times Pliny mentions certain Purple Islands, the position of which with reference to the Fortunate Islands or Canaries might seem to indicate Madeira islands. Plutarch (Sertorius, 75 AD) referring to the military commander Quintus Sertorius (d. 72 BC), relates that after his return to C√°diz, \\"he met seamen recently arrived from Atlantic islands, two in number, divided from one another only by a narrow channel and distant from the coast of Africa 10,000 furlongs.

There is a romantic tale about two lovers, Robert Machim and Anna d'Arfet in time of the King Edward III of England, fleeing from England to France in 1346, were driven off their course by a violent storm, and cast on the coast of Madeira at the place subsequently named Machico, in memory of one of them. On the evidence of a portolan dated 1351, preserved at Florence, Italy, it would appear that Madeira had been discovered long before that date by Portuguese vessels under Genoese captains. Portuguese discovery In 1419 two captains of Prince Henry the Navigator, Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco and Trist√£o Vaz Teixeira, were driven by a storm to the island they called Porto Santo, or Holy Harbour, in gratitude for their rescue from shipwreck. The next year an expedition was sent to populate the island, and, Madeira being described, they made for it, and took possession on behalf of the Portuguese crown, together with captain Bartolomeu Perestrello. The islands started to be settled circa 1420 or 1425. On September 23, 1433, the name Ilha da Madeira (Madeira Island or \\"island of the wood\\") appears in a map, by the first time, in a document. Statue of Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco. The three captain-majors had led, in the first trip, the respective families, a small group of people of the minor nobility, people of modest conditions and some old prisoners of the kingdom. To gain the minimum conditions for the development of agriculture, they had to rough-hew a part of the dense forest of laurisilva. Then fires were started, which are said to have burned for seven years. The colonists constructed a large number of canals (levadas), since in some parts of the island, they had water in excess while in other parts water was scarce. The manual work was done by enslaved Africans brought from the African mainland. They were soon put to growing and refining sugar, which was much in demand in Europe and highly profitable. As the slaves were worked to death and the women were unable to bear children, more and more Africans were captured and brought to the island. This pattern for sugar cultivation became the model that would soon be transferred to the Caribbean and Brazil. In Madeira it became evident that a warm climate, winds to work windmills for sugar crushing and easy access to the sea (for transportation of the raw sugar to Europe) were, together with slave labour, important components in what became a huge and highly profitable industry, which funded industrialisation and European expansion. Some years before his voyages across the Atlantic, Christopher Columbus, who at the time was a sugar trader, visited Madeira. It is generally accepted that he was born in Genoa, Italy as Cristoforo Colon. In Portugal it has been claimed that he was born in that country, as Salvador Fernandes Zarco but this is disputed. Columbus married the daughter of a plantation owner on Porto Santo and so was well aware of the profits to be made. He also understood the necessary growing conditions for sugar and the navigational technique known as the Volta do mar. On one of his voyages to the Caribbean he took sugar cane plants with him. By the end of the 15th century, Madeira was the world's greatest producer of sugar. In the earliest times, fish constituted about half of the settlers' diet, together with vegetables and fruit. The first local agricultural activity with some success was the raising of wheat. Initially, the colonists produced wheat for their own sustenance but, later began to export wheat to Portugal. The discoveries of Porto Santo and Madeira were first described by Gomes Eanes de Zurara in Chronica da Descoberta e Conquista da Guin√©. (Eng. version by Edgar Prestage in 2 vols. issued by the Hakluyt Society, London, 1896-1899: The Chronicle of Discovery and Conquest of Guinea.) Arkan Simaan relates these discoveries in French in his novel based on Azurara's chronicle: L‚Äô√âcuyer d‚ÄôHenri le Navigateur, published by √âditions l‚ÄôHarmattan, Paris. 17th, 18th and 19th centuries However, in time grain production began to fall. To get past the ensuing crisis Henry decided to order the planting of sugarcane - rare in Europe and, therefore, considered a spice - promoting, for this, the introduction of Sicilian beets as the first specialized plant and the technology of its agriculture. Sugarcane production became a leading factor in the island's economy, and increased the demand for labour. Genoese and Portuguese traders were attracted to the islands. Sugarcane cultivation and the sugar production industry developed until the 17th century. Since the 17th century, Madeira's most important product has been its wine, sugar production having since moved on to Brazil, Portuguese S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, and elsewhere. Madeira wine was perhaps the most popular luxury beverage in the colonial Western Hemisphere during the 17th and 18th centuries. The British Empire occupied Madeira as a result of the Napoleonic Wars, a friendly occupation which concluded in 1814 when the island was returned to Portugal. When, after the death of king John VI of Portugal, his usurper son Miguel of Portugal seized power from the rightful heir, his niece Maria II, and proclaimed himself 'Absolute King', Madeira held out for the Queen under the governor Jos√© Travassos Valdez until Miguel sent an expeditionary force and the defence of the island was overwhelmed by crushing force. Valdez was forced to flee to England under the protection of the Royal Navy (September 1828). In 1891 a census revealed the population on Madeira to be 132,223 inhabitants. Twentieth century On 23 July 1905, the Paris edition of the New York Herald carried a report headed: \\"German Company Plans to Make Madeira an up- to-date Resort\\". In return for a promise to build a sanatorium and hospitals and treat 40 tuberculosis patients a year free, the Madeira Aktiengesellschaft, headed by Prince Friedrich Karl Hohenlohe-√ñhringen, was in an arrangement with the Portuguese government, that in turn for building these facilities it will take over all business concerns on Madeira. When plans for some of the hospitals were exposed as being designs for hotels and holiday camps, the Madeirans realized that they were being colonized through the back door and promptly withdrew the concession. Just before this the Germans were constructing what is today the \\"Hospital dos Marmeleiros\\" (the only building the Germans began to build), the Germans were given a tax break and did not need to pay tax on anything needed to construct the hospital. The site was left abandoned until 1930 when the Madeirans continued to build the Hospital dos Marmeleiros. Locals say that the reason that the hospital construction was abandoned by the Germans was not just because of their colonization plans being discovered. It was that during the construction of the hospital the Germans needed special materials not available on Madeira, so it was agreed that Madeirans would take the materials up to the site from the German ship in the harbour. The strongest horses were used to bring up the wooden barrels. The local Madeiran with the strongest horses bringing up the materials was suspicious that what he was taking up the hill was heavier than what should be needed to construct the hospital, so he on purpose let one of the barrels roll down the hill and smash open. It is alleged that it was filled with rifles. When the locals looked inside what was already constructed they found ammunition and more guns. This caused the Madeirans to confiscate all German property in Madeira and stop the construction of the hospital. =World War I= In 1914 all German property was confiscated in Madeira, including the ship, the Colmar, built in 1912 which was interned in Madeira in 1914. In 1916 it was renamed Machico and in 1925 it was bought from the Portuguese Government and renamed Luso; in 1955 it was scrapped after grounding damage. On 9 March 1916, Germany declared war on Portugal, followed by Portugal declaring war on Germany and starting to organise Portuguese troops to go to the Western Front. The effect of the Portuguese participation in World War I was first felt in Madeira on 3 December 1916 when the German U-boat, , captained by Max Valentiner went into Funchal harbour on Madeira and torpedoed and sank 3 ships, CS Dacia (1,856 tons), (2,493 tons) and Surprise (680 tons). The commander of the French Gunboat Surprise and 34 of her crew (7 Portuguese) died in the attack. The Dacia, a British cable laying vessel, had previously undertaken war work off the coast of Casablanca and Dakar, was in the process of diverting the South American cable into Brest, France. Following the attack on the ships, the Germans proceeded to bombard Funchal for two hours from a range of about . Batteries on Madeira returned fire and eventually forced the Germans to withdraw. In 1917 on December 12, two German U-boats, and (captained by Max Valentiner) again bombarded Funchal, Madeira. This time the attack lasted around 30 minutes. Forty, 4.7 inch and 5.9 inch shells were fired. There were 3 fatalities and 17 wounded, In addition, a number of houses and Santa Clara church were hit. A priest, Jos√© Marques Jardim, promised in 1917 to build a monument should peace ever return to Madeira. In 1927 at Terreiro da Luta he built a statue of Nossa Senhora da Paz (Our Lady of Peace) commemorating the end of World War I. It incorporates the anchor chains from the sunken ships from Madeira on 3 December 1916 and is over 5 metres tall. Charles I, the last Emperor of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, went into exile in Madeira after his second unsuccessful coup d'√©tat in Hungary. He died there on 1 April 1922 is buried in the Church of Our Lady of Monte. Charles I had tried in 1917 to secretly enter into peace negotiations with France. Although his foreign minister, Ottokar Czernin, was only interested in negotiating a general peace which would include Germany as well, Charles himself, in negotiations with the French with his brother-in-law, Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, an officer in the Belgian Army, as intermediary, went much further in suggesting his willingness to make a separate peace. When news of the overture leaked in April 1918, Charles denied involvement until the French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau published letters signed by him. This led to Czernin's resignation, forcing Austria-Hungary into an even more dependent position with respect to its seemingly-wronged German ally. Determined to prevent a restoration attempt, the Council of Allied Powers had agreed on Madeira because it was isolated in the Atlantic and easily guarded.The New York Times, Nov. 6, 1921 (accessed 4 May 2009) =World War II= Monument to remember the Gibraltarian evacuees in Madeira Portugal in World War II was neutral and become non-belligerent in 1943. Salazar's decision to stick with the oldest alliance in the world, cemented by the Treaty of Windsor (1386) between Portugal and England (still in force today), meant that the Anglo- Portuguese Alliance allowed Madeira to take in refugees on a humanitarian basis; in July 1940, around 2,000 Gibraltarian Cadiz News (accessed 13 December 2010) evacuees were shipped to Madeira due to the high risk of Gibraltar being attacked by either Spain or Germany; the Germans had planned but never initiated an attack on the British colony, code-named Operation Felix. The Gibraltarians are fondly remembered on the island, where they were called Gibraltinos. Some Gibraltarians had married Madeirans during this time and stayed after the war was over. Tito Benady, a historian on Gibraltar Jewry, noted that when some 200 Jews of the 2000 evacuees from Gibraltar were evacuated as non-combatants to Funchal at the start of World War II, they found a Jewish cemetery that belonged to the Abudarham family. This is the same family after whom the Abudarham Synagogue in Gibraltar was named. On November 12th 1940, Adolf Hitler issued F√ºhrer Directive No. 18, which provided the possibility to invade Portugal. He stated \\"I also request that the problem of occupying Madeira and the Azores should be considered, together with the advantages and disadvantages which this would entail for our sea and air warfare. The results of these investigations are to be submitted to me as soon as possible.\\"Directive No. 18 (accessed 14 December 2010) On the May 28th 1944, the first party of evacuees left Madeira for Gibraltar; by the end of 1944, only 520 non-priority evacuees remained on the island.Garcia, pp. 20 In 2008, a monument was made in Gibraltar and shipped to Madeira, where it has been erected next to a small chapel at Santa Caterina park in Funchal. The monument is a gift and symbol of everlasting thanks given by the people of Gibraltar to the island of Madeira and its inhabitants.www.love-madeira.com (accessed 13 December 2010) The city of Funchal and Gibraltar were twinned on 13 May 2009 by their then-mayors, the mayor of Funchal Miguel Albuquerque and the mayor of Gibraltar, who had been an evacuee from Gibraltar to Madeira Solomon Levy, respectively. The mayor of Gibraltar then had a meeting with the then-President of Madeira Alberto Jo√£o Jardim. Autonomy On 1 July 1976, following the democratic revolution of 1974, Portugal granted political autonomy to Madeira, celebrated on Madeira Day. The region now has its own government and legislative assembly. On September 1978, the Madeira flag was adopted. The blue part symbolizes the sea surrounding the island and the yellow represents the abundance of life on the island. The red cross of the Order of Christ, with a white cross on it, is identical to the one on the flag of Prince Henry's ships that discovered the island. On September 1980, the official anthem was adopted. In 1980, the Madeira International Business Centre was created. From 1976 to 2019, the center-right Social Democratic Party (PPD/PSD) had a majority of MPs in the regional parliament and ruled on its own. During most of that time, from 1978 to 2015 (37 years), the regional government was headed by Alberto Jo√£o Jardim, making him one of the longest- serving democratically elected leaders in the world. In the 2019 election, PPD/PSD won once again, but lost the majority it had always held. Now it governs in coalition with the Popular Party.

SPECS was originally manufactured by Speed Check Services Limited, from which it takes its name. The company was acquired by Vysionics in 2010, which in turn was acquired by Jenoptik in 2014.  About SPECS cameras  SPECS cameras operate as sets of two or more cameras installed along a fixed route that can be from 75 metres (246 feet). Maximum distance was 10km with SPECS1 (SVDD) but with the event of SPECS3 became unlimited although legal requirements limit the maximum practical distance . They work by using an automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) system to record a vehicle's front number plate at each fixed camera site. As the distance is known between these sites, the average speed can be calculated by dividing this by the time taken to travel between two points. The cameras use infrared photography, allowing them to operate both day and night. There is a popular misconception that the Home Office has approved the SPECS system for single-lane use only. The cameras can only operate in pairs, where each pair only monitors one lane of a multi lane road. http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7048645.stm BBC magazine article on SPECS So in theory, one can escape detection by changing lanes between the entry and exit cameras. In reality, two or more sets of pairs of cameras are arranged to have overlapping areas of monitoring; since the driver cannot tell which cameras are 'entry' and which are 'exit', as they look identical, they cannot tell where to change lane to escape detection. With the introduction of SPECS3-Vector cameras were able to monitor more than one lane including traffic going in different directions as long as the orientation of a pair of cameras is the same. The system has another deficiency in that since the cameras only read the front number plate of a vehicle, speeding motorcycles escape detection because they have no front number plate to read. This issue went away with the introduction of SPECS3 which can be set up to be forward facing as well as rear facing allowing motorcyclists to be caught. A prime example of a site setup for this is the A537 Cat-and-Fiddle site.Google Maps - A537 Cat and Fiddle (September 2018) https://www.google.co.uk/maps/@53.2372039,-1.9667081,3a,75y,278.3h,94.6t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sVAL89MnKcMTfEGpxvAtH0A!2e0!7i13312!8i6656 Retrieved 2019-02-09 The cameras are often painted yellow and have been given the nickname \\"yellow vultures\\".

The Social Security tax is one component of the Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax (FICA) and Self-employment tax, the other component being the Medicare tax. It is also the maximum amount of covered wages that are taken into account when average earnings are calculated in order to determine a worker's Social Security benefit. In 2019, the Social Security Wage Base was $132,900 and in 2020 will be $137,700; the Social Security tax rate was 6.20% paid by the employee and 6.20% paid by the employer.The Kiplinger Letter, Vol. 96, No. 33 (August 16, 2019), p. 2.Publication 15, Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E) (April. 2018), p. 23, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury. A person with $10,000 of gross income had $620.00 withheld as Social Security tax from his check and the employer sent an additional $620.00. A person with $130,000 of gross income in 2017 incurred Social Security tax of $7,886.40 (resulting in an effective rate of approximately 6.07% ‚Äì the rate was lower because the income was more than the 2017 \\"wage base\\", see below), with $7,886.40 paid by the employer. A person who earned a million dollars in wages paid the same $7,886.40 in Social Security tax (resulting in an effective rate of approximately 0.79%), with equivalent employer matching. In the cases of the $130k and $1m earners, each paid the same amount into the social security system, and both will take the same out of the social security system. Details The Congressional Budget Office considers the employer share of taxes to be passed on to employees in the form of lower wages than would otherwise be paid, and counts them as part of the employees‚Äô tax burden. Self- employed individuals pay the entire amount of applicable tax. When an employee works for several different companies during a tax year, his or her Social Security deductions could exceed the cap, because each employer may not know how much the employee has already paid in Social Security tax in other jobs. The Social Security tax coverage will be calculated on his or her personal return, and any excess is applied towards his or her Federal taxes. For example, in 2017 an employee works two jobs (either concurrently or consecutively) paying $70,000 each. Since each employer calculates the social security taxes independently, each employer will withhold 6.2% of the $70,000 employee‚Äôs salary, or $4,340, for a grand total of $8,680 -- which exceeds the cap of $7,886.40 by $739.60. The over-payment would be entered on the applicable line of Form 1040 and, assuming the employee did not owe any other Federal taxes, would be refunded to the employee. The employers who each paid $4,340 will not get a refund, since they are not aware that the employee overpaid in aggregate for the year. The government keeps the $818.40 overage. Even if the employers become aware of the overpayment, there is no method to claim the overpayment. Several occupations are exempted from the current cap with a far lower cap, such as food service employees and domestic help employees. For the year 2014, the cap was $6,500 in wages.

The maximum employee share in 2012 is reduced to $4,624.20, but the maximum employer share remains at $6,826.20. Effectively, this was a 4.2% rate charged to the employee, and 6.2% rate to the employer. This resulted in an approximately 40/60 split but reduced the total contribution. See here for a complete historical list of the Social Security Wage Base. (**) Since 1990, the employer & employee share has usually been 6.2% each for a 50/50 split of the 12.4% combined total. The changes shown below applied In 2011 and 2012 when the rates were temporarily lowered to 4.2% for the employee (but remained at 6.2% for the employer). In 2013, the employee rate returns to 6.2% for a 50/50 split with the employer and a higher Maximum Contribution. For self-employed people, the 2013 guidance from SSA indicates the full rate OASDI is 12.4% for 2013. See footnote a. at 2013 SSA.gov link. Returning to the traditional 6.2% OASDI employee share for 2013 effectively reduces take home pay by 2% and increases the maximum OASDI contribution by the same amount, returning it to traditional levels. The dip in the maximum OASDI contributions for 2011 and 2012 causes the 2013 rate to appear as a spike, when in fact it is a return to the levels imposed in the years 1990 through 2010. Note that although self-employed individuals pay 12.4%, this is mitigated two ways. First, half of the amount of the tax is reduced from salary before figuring the tax (you don't pay Social Security tax on the tax your employer pays for you.) Second, the \\"employer\\" half is an adjustment to income on the front page of Form 1040. =Employee Contribution changes in 2011= As part of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 enacted on December 17, 2010, the employee Social Security tax rate is reduced from 6.2% to 4.2% for wages paid during the year 2011 and 2012. The employer Social Security tax rate and the Social Security Wage Base were not directly impacted by this act, though they did change; only the employee's tax rate changes. This is reflected in the above table, showing the reduction from $6,621.60 to $4,485.60. Use in pension plans Because taxes and benefits are based only on earnings up to the SSWB, pension plans can base contributions and or benefits in greater degree on earnings above the SSWB (excess plans) or reduce benefits or contributions below the SSWB (offset plans). The pension compensation nondiscrimination laws (Internal Revenue Code Section 401(a)(4)) require that qualified pension plans not discriminate in benefits, rights and features in favor of highly compensated employees (in 2007, the threshold is $100K of 2006 gross pay including bonuses and overtime). Because Social Security provides a progressive benefit formula and stops taxation at the SSWB, pension plans may integrate benefits or contributions according to a wage base, frequently at a fraction (e.g. 50%) of the SSWB. =Defined contribution plans = Plans can contribute a higher percentage to base salaries above an integration base. If that integration base is identical to the SSWB the contributions may be double above the base not to exceed 5.7% for excess plans. For offset plans the defined-contribution plan may base contributions on total base salary and then reduce or \\"offset\\" the contribution rate for salary below the integration base. If the integration base for such offset plans is identical to the SSWB, then the reduction could be up to 5.7%. =Defined benefit plans = For defined benefit plans the integration base is a career average of the SSWB for each year of the worker's career, which in pension law is called \\"covered compensation\\" base. Under pension law, the SSWB may not be projected to increase in the future so a new hire's covered compensation base would contain all future years at the current year's SSWB. Excess and offset plans also exist for defined-benefit plans.

The anterior fontanelle typically closes between the ages of 12 and 18 months. Clinical significance The anterior fontanelle is useful clinically. Examination of an infant includes palpating the anterior fontanelle. A sunken fontanelle indicates dehydration whereas a very tense or bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. However, this is not a certain indicator for raised pressure as prolonged crying by the baby may produce the same effect .

Because osteocalcin has gla domains, its synthesis is vitamin K dependent. In humans, osteocalcin is encoded by the BGLAP gene. Its receptors include GPRC6A, GPR158, and possibly a third, yet-to-be-identified receptor.  Function  Osteocalcin is secreted solely by osteoblasts and thought to play a role in the body's metabolic regulation. In its carboxylated form it binds calcium directly and thus concentrates in bone. In its uncarboxylated form, osteocalcin acts as a hormone in the body, signalling in the pancreas, fat, muscle, testes, and brain. * In the pancreas, osteocalcin acts on beta cells, causing beta cells in the pancreas to release more insulin. * In fat cells, osteocalcin triggers the release of the hormone adiponectin, which increases sensitivity to insulin. * In muscle, osteocalcin acts on myocytes to promote energy availability and utilization and in this manner favors exercise capacity. * In the testes, osteocalcin acts on Leydig cells, stimulating testosterone biosynthesis and therefore affects male fertility. *In the brain, osteocalcin plays an important role in development and functioning. An acute stress response, colloquially known as the fight-or-flight response, stimulates osteocalcin release from bone within minutes in mice, rats, and humans. Injections of high levels of osteocalcin alone can trigger an ASR in the presence of adrenal insufficiency. Use as a biochemical marker for bone formation As osteocalcin is produced by osteoblasts, it is often used as a marker for the bone formation process. It has been observed that higher serum osteocalcin levels are relatively well correlated with increases in bone mineral density during treatment with anabolic bone formation drugs for osteoporosis, such as teriparatide. In many studies, osteocalcin is used as a preliminary biomarker on the effectiveness of a given drug on bone formation. For instance, one study which aimed to study the effectiveness of a glycoprotein called lactoferrin on bone formation used osteocalcin as a measure of osteoblast activity.

The fravashi of an individual sends out the urvan (often translated as 'soul') into the material world to fight the battle of good versus evil. On the morning of the fourth day after death, the urvan is imagined to return to its fravashi, where its experiences in the material world are collected to assist the next generation in their fight between good and evil. In the 9/10th-century works of Zoroastrian tradition (Pahlavi books), Avestan fravashi continues as Middle Persian (and -w- forms, etc), , or . The last days of a year, called , are dedicated to the . The first month of the year as well as the 19th day of each month are considered under the protection of, and named after, the fravashis. The winged-disc symbol of Zoroastrianism is traditionally interpreted as a depiction of a . Etymology The word is commonly perceived to have var- \\"to choose,\\" as its root. From reconstructed (/rt/ clusters in Avestan usually appear as /≈°/), could then mean \\"one who has been selected (for exaltation).\\" The same root, in the sense of \\"to choose/profess a faith,\\" is found in the word , the name of the Zoroastrian credo. Other interpretations take other meanings of var- into consideration: Either as var- \\"to cover\\" that in a bahuvrihi with fra- \\"to ward\\" provides \\"protective valor,\\" or a derivation from var- \\"to make/be pregnant\\" which gives \\"promoter of birth, birth-spirit.\\" One interpretation considers a derivation from vart- \\"turn\\" hence \\"turning away, departing, death.\\" The Epistles of Zadspram, a 10th century exegetical work, derives fravashi from fra-vaxsh \\"to grow forth.\\" In scripture Like most other Zoroastrian yazatas, the fravashis are not mentioned in the Gathas. The earliest mention of them is in the Old Avestan Yasna Haptanghaiti (Y. 37) which includes an invocation of \\"the fravashis of the righteous\\" (ashavan). In chapter 57 of the Yasna, the fravashis are responsible for the course of the sun, moon, and stars (and will do so until the renovation of this world), and in nurturing waters and plants, and protecting the unborn in the womb. The principal source of information on the is Yasht 13 ( Yasht), the hymn that is addressed to them and in which they appear as beings who inhabit the stratosphere, and aid and protect those who worship them, and in which the fravashis are presented on the same level as the lesser yazatas. Yasht 13 is one of the eight \\"great\\" yashts, and at 158 verses the longest text in the collection, and one of the better preserved ones as well. It is also the second-most frequently recited Yasht (after Yasht 1 to Mazda). Several different authors contributed to the hymn, and its literary quality is uneven; while some verses are rich in traditional poetic phrases, others are of dully imitative prose. The frequently repeated kshnuman (formulaic invocation) of Yasht 13 is \\"We worship the good, strong, bounteous frava≈°is of the righteous (ashavan).\\" Yasht 13 begins with a cosmogonical chapter in which the Creator Ahura Mazda is portrayed as acknowledging that material creation was brought about with the assistance of \\"many hundreds, many thousands, many tens of thousands\\" of \\"mighty, victorious fravashis\\" (13.1-2). Moreover, Mazda is presented as acknowledging that without the help of the fravashis, cattle and men would have been lost to Angra Mainyu. \\"This declaration is wholly unorthodox, and unsupported by any other text.\\" Verses 14-15, as also several other verses scattered through the text, describe how the fravashis continue to sustain the material world and mankind in the post-creation phase of the world. Verses 16-17, as also several other later verses, celebrate their military prowess and assistance in battle, where they are invoked. Verse 20 includes an injunction to memorize their invocation, so as to be able to call on them in times of need. In 13.49-52, the hymn turns to the function of the fravashis in relation to the dead. There, the fravashis of the dead are said to return to their (former) homes during the last days of the year (Hamaspathmaedaya, frawardigan), hoping to be worshipped and receive gifts, in exchange for which they bless those who live there. This section (karda), known to priests by its opening words as the ya visatha, also appears in Siroza 1/2 and several Afrinagans, notably those of Arda Fravash (the 'righteous fravash') and Dahman (the yazata of prayer), and is thus a frequently recited passage. In Yt. 13.65-68, the are associated with prosperity, and annually strive to ensure that \\"family, set}} and as distinct parts of a mortal's immaterial nature. And while they are said to have martial prowess in some passages, elsewhere (13.49-52, 13.96-144), they are co-eval with the relatively helpless urvan. This co-identification also occurs elsewhere in the Avesta, such as in Yasna 16.7, where it is explicit. According to Mary Boyce, the perplexing anomalies of Yasht 13 are residual traces of fravashi cult, which she defines as a form of an ancestor worship and/or hero-cult that developed during (what she calls) the 'Iranian Heroic Age' (c. 1500 BCE onwards). In tradition A graphic depiction similar to one carved in Persepolis. Although there is no physical description of a fravashi in the Avesta, the faravahar, one of the best known symbols of Zoroastrianism, is commonly believed to be the depiction of one. The attribution of the name (which derives from the Middle Iranian word for fravashi) to the symbol is probably a later development. In Avestan language grammar, the fravashi are unmistakably female, while the faravahar symbol is unmistakably male. In the Denkard's myth of Zoroaster's conception (Dk., 7.2.15-47), his frawahr is sent down from heaven within a unique hom-plant to be united on earth with his mortal body (tanu) and appointed glory (xwarrah). In the Bundahishn's creation myth narrates a fable in which the fravashis are given a choice of either remaining protected with Ahura Mazda, or being born into mortals, suffering but also helping bring about the defeat of Angra Mainyu. The fravashis are shown the future before the creation of the getik material world. Ohrmazd's offer of security with inaction is rejected and the fravashi consent to enter the material world as active allies in the battle against evil (GBd. 34.12f). In another cosmological myth (Zadspram 3.2-3), when Angra Mainyu breaks into the created world, the fravashis draw together on the rim of the sky to imprison him. The Denkard, Shikand gumanic vichar, Menog i khrat, Zatspram, and several other works together include an extensive theological exegesis on the distinction between and (material and immaterial) aspects of creation, and between the and . In the hierarchy of the yazatas, the fravashis are the assistants of the Amesha Spenta Haurvatat (Middle Persian: Khordad) of \\"Wholeness\\", whose special domain are \\"the Waters\\" (Avestan Apo, Middle Persian: Aban). In the day-name dedications of the Zoroastrian calendar, the fravashis preside over the 19th day of the month and the first month of the year, and both are named after the frawards. The intersection of the month-name and day-name dedications are the name-day feast of the frawards. This feast day of farvardin jashan is especially observed by Zoroastrians who have lost a relative in the preceding year. Additionally, the fourth watch (gah) of the twenty-four-hour day, from sunset to midnight, is under the protection of the frawards. References ;Citations ;Works cited * . .

Merton. Similar to Max Weber's famous claim on the link between Protestant work ethic and the capitalist economy, Merton argued for a similar positive correlation between the rise of Protestant Pietism and early experimental science.Sztompka, 2003 The Merton thesis has resulted in continuous debates.Cohen, 1990 Although scholars are still debating it, Merton's 1936 doctoral dissertation (and two years later his first monograph by the same title) Science, Technology and Society in 17th- Century England raised important issues on the connections between religion and the rise of modern science, became a significant work in the realm of the sociology of science and continues to be cited in new scholarship.Merton Awarded Nation's Highest Science Honor Merton further developed this thesis in other publications. Thesis The Merton thesis has two separate parts: firstly, it presents a theory that science changes due to an accumulation of observations and improvement in experimental technique and methodology; secondly, it puts forward the argument that the popularity of science in England in the 17th century, and the religious demography of the Royal Society (English scientists of that time were predominantly Puritans or other Protestants) can be explained by a correlation between Protestantism and the scientific values (see Mertonian norms).Gregory, 1998 Merton focuses on English Puritanism and German Pietism as being responsible for the development of the scientific revolution of the 17th and 18th centuries. He explains that the connection between religious affiliation and interest in science is a result of a significant synergy between the ascetic Protestant values and those of modern science.Becker, 1992 Protestant values encouraged scientific research by allowing science to identify God's influence on the world and thus providing religious justification for scientific research. Criticism The first part of Merton's thesis has been criticized for insufficient consideration of the roles of mathematics and the mechanical philosophy in the scientific revolution. The second part has been criticized for the difficulty involved in defining who counts as a Protestant of the \\"right type\\" without making arbitrary distinctions. It is also criticized for failing to explain why non-Protestants do science (consider the Catholics Copernicus, da Vinci, Descartes, or Galileo) and conversely why Protestants of the \\"right type\\" are not all interested in science.Ferngen, 2002Porter & Teich 1992 Merton, acknowledging the criticism, replied that the Puritan ethos was not necessary, although it did facilitate development of science.Heddendorf, 1986] He also noted that when science had acquired institutional legitimacy, it no longer needed religion, eventually becoming a counterforce, leading to religious decline. Nonetheless, early on, in Merton's view religion was a major factor that allowed the scientific revolution to occur. While the Merton thesis does not explain all the causes of the scientific revolution, it does illuminate possible reasons why England was one of its driving motors and the structure of the English scientific community.Cohen, 1994 Support In 1958, American sociologist Gerhard Lenski's empirical inquiry into The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life in the Detroit area (Michigan) revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with regard to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported the basic hypotheses of Max Weber's work The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. According to Lenski, the \\"contributions of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory.\\" Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, John Wesley, one of the founders of the Methodist church, had observed that \\"diligence and frugality\\" made Methodists wealthy. \\"In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress.\\" However, Lenski said, asceticism was rare among modern Protestants, and the distinctive Protestant doctrine of \\"the calling\\" was largely forgotten. Instead, modern (white) Protestants and Jews had a high degree of \\"intellectual autonomy\\" that facilitated scientific and technical advance.Gerhard Lenski (1963), The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics, and Family Life, Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352 By contrast, Lenski pointed out, Catholics developed an intellectual orientation which valued \\"obedience\\" to the teachings of their church above intellectual autonomy, which made them less inclined to enter scientific careers. Catholic sociologistsThomas F. O'Dea (1958), The Catholic Dilemma: An Inquiry into the Intellectual Life, New York, N.Y.Frank L. Christ and Gerard Sherry (Eds.) (1961), American Catholicism and the Intellectual Ideal, New York, N.Y. had come to the same conclusions.Gerhard Lenski, The Religious Factor, pp. 283-284 Lenski traced these differences back to the Reformation and the Catholic church's reaction to it. In Lenski's view, the Reformation encouraged intellectual autonomy among Protestants, in particular the Anabaptists, Puritans, Pietists, Methodists, and Presbyterians. In the Middle Ages, there had been tendencies toward intellectual autonomy, as exemplified in men like Erasmus. But after the Reformation, the Catholic leaders increasingly identified these tendencies with Protestantism and heresy and demanded that Catholics be obedient and faithful to ecclesiastical discipline. In Lenski's opinion, his study showed that these differences between Protestants and Catholics survived to the present day. As a consequence, \\"none of the predominantly and devoutly Catholic nations in the modern world can be classified as a leading industrial nation. Some Catholic nations ‚Äì such as France, Italy, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile ‚Äì are quite highly industrialized, but none of them are leaders in the technological and scientific fields, nor do they seem likely to become so. Recently [1963] some Brazilian Catholic social scientists compared their country's progress with that of the United States and concluded that the chief factor responsible for the differential rates of development is the religious heritage of the two nations.\\"Gerhard Lenski, The Religious Factor, pp. 347-349 Puritans and Pietists both contributed to intellectual autonomy and provided intellectual tools and values important for science.Gregory, Andrew (1998). handouts for course 'The Scientific Revolution' at The Scientific Revolution, doc file online As an example, pietism challenged the orthodoxy via new media and formats: Periodical journals gained importance versus the former pasquills and single thesis, traditional disputation was replaced by competitive debating, which tried to gain new knowledge instead of defending orthodox scholarship.Martin Gierl, Pietismus und Aufkl√§rung: theologische Polemik und die Kommunikationsreform der Wissenschaft am Ende des 17.

The Non-League Background Unusually for a Football League manager, McNally's playing career was spent as an amateur at Skelmersdale United. Upon retirement as a player, he became coach at the club and later served as manager at Southport in their first season in non-league football and was a member of coaching staff at Altrincham as Football League clubs began to take note of his achievements. McNally was a stonemason by trade, and the son of a miner. Joining the Latics He joined Wigan as a coach in 1981, becoming assistant manager the following year. The club's manager, Larry Lloyd quit to become the manager of Notts County at the end of the 1982‚Äì83 season, and at about the same time, owner Ken Bates pulled his investment out of the club, forcing the sale of most of the first team. McNally was appointed manager and rebuilt the squad with youth players and lower‚Äìleague signings (one of them being Paul Jewell, who would eventually steer the club into the Premier League as manager), leading the side to a creditable 13th-place finish the following season. He ended up having to sell his new squad at the end of the season to alleviate the continuing financial problems, forcing another rebuild. The following season was not as successful, and McNally resigned in February 1985. A few months after McNally's departure, Wigan won the Associate Members Cup at Wembley Stadium, thanks largely to the squad McNally had put together. The Early Chester years When he became Chester City manager in July 1985, McNally inherited a side that had finished bottom of the Football League a year before and had needed an excellent run under Mick Speight to avoid a similar fate in 1984‚Äì85. Despite's Speight's success, McNally was appointed in his place amid protests from supporters. He was to soon silence his doubters, as with the help of successful new signings of David Glenn, Milton Graham and John Kelly, the Blues finished runners‚Äìup in Division Four for only their second promotion since joining the Football League in 1931. Although he had to contend with the loss of key players Andy Holden and the prolific Stuart Rimmer through injury, Chester sealed promotion with three games still to play. After comfortably guiding Chester to safety in 1986‚Äì87 and 1987‚Äì88, McNally enjoyed his most successful season with the club in 1988‚Äì89. He led the Blues to eighth position in Division Three (now League One), missing out on a play‚Äìoff spot by just four points. The campaign included a 7‚Äì0 home win over Fulham, the club's biggest league win for more than 30 years. Unfortunately the following season saw Chester struggle home in 16th place, amid growing uncertainty over the club's future as it became clear they would be leaving their cherished Sealand Road home. During his early years at the club, McNally had given Football League debuts to several players who went on to have long professional careers. Graham Abel, Barry Butler, Carl Dale and David Pugh were successfully captured from non-league football, while Brian Croft, Chris Lightfoot, Aidan Newhouse, Robbie Painter and Colin Woodthorpe all progressed through the youth ranks. Later years Chester spent the 1990‚Äì91 season exiled more than 40 miles away at Moss Rose in Macclesfield, operating on the lowest average attendance in the whole Football League. McNally guided Chester to safety before the end of the season in 19th place, although he attracted publicity for the wrong reasons after being hospitalised along with new signing Keith Bertschin after events got out of hand at the club's Christmas party.FourFourTwo, March 2005, A Minute's Silence, p.40 During the first 12 months in exile, McNally broke Chester's transfer record three times when signing Neil Morton, Eddie Bishop and Stuart Rimmer, who made a shock return to the club on the eve of the 1991‚Äì92 season and went on to become the club's record goalscorer. The following season saw Chester struggling at the foot of the table and when they were thrashed 5‚Äì2 at home by fellow strugglers Darlington on 4 January 1992, there appeared little hope for City to survive. But McNally helped oversee an unlikely great escape, with just four defeats in the final 18 matches of the season (including an outstanding 1‚Äì0 win at promotion chasing Stoke City on 25 April 1992) seeing Chester finish five points above the relegation zone. At the end of the season, The Sun named McNally as their manager of the year for his achievements on a shoe‚Äìstring budget. McNally brought the club home to Chester in the newly renamed Division Two with optimism growing for what lay ahead, but unfortunately age was to catch up on many of his side. A 3‚Äì0 win over Burnley in the first Football League match at the Deva Stadium was the only win in the opening 12 games of the 1992‚Äì93 season and McNally was sacked after a 2‚Äì2 home draw with Bolton Wanderers on 17 October 1992. His final signing was Shaun Garnett, on loan from Tranmere Rovers. The Maverick Manager Everyone who knew Harry McNally has a favourite story about him. Players who played under him often speak with affection about a number of the bizarre incidents he was involved in, such as jumping in a bath containing no cold water when raging at how Chester had thrown the points away in a 4‚Äì4 draw with Bury in 1987. Earlier that year, McNally had astounded spectators during a Freight Rover Trophy tie away at Chester's arch-rivals Wrexham. Frustrated as Chester trailed 1‚Äì0 with time ticking away, he hauled an injured Chester player to his feet, saying they should be prepared to die for the cause. The move did the trick as Chester equalised and went on to record a derby victory in extra‚Äìtime. His belief in players giving their all and being prepared to risk all was reflected when Chester embarked on a pre‚Äìseason tour of Scotland in 1992. McNally suffered a broken leg when playing in a friendly match, claiming he had to set the right example to his players and could not pull out of the challenge.

McNally was one of the biggest critics of Terry Smith's ownership of the club, and resigned after only a few days as a consultant at the club in 2000. McNally died from a heart attack in Chester on 12 December 2004, aged 68. While he had no surviving close relatives, several notable footballing figures attended his funeral. Chester City Football Club have now renamed a stand to honour their former manager, known as the Harry McNally Terrace. This was opened on 26 December 2006 by EX chairman Stephen Vaughan, with a plaque also presented the same day on behalf of the fans by Chester City Supporters' Trust.

There are several theories about the origins of the word Efe. The organization of the Efe and Zeybeks were first seen in the 16th century during the Jelali revolts which dismantled power throughout the Ottoman Empire. After that time, men who rebelled against local pressures and injustices and settled in the mountains were called Efe or Zeybek. The Efe were distinctive in their attire, weapons and general appearance, which were created for survival and to best suit the life of an Efe. For example, they wore shorter trousers than were common at the time, and a yataghan with only one side with a sharpened point which was useful in m√™l√©e combat. After the World War I Efes were known for leading their bands of Zeybeks in guerrilla strikes against the Greek forces during the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), before voluntarily joining the newly formed national army in the Turkish War of Independence. After the declaration of the Republic, Efe groups were awarded with The Medallion of Independence for their participation in the war. Most Efe leaders received military ranks and pensions for their services. When they retired after the foundation of the new Turkish Republic in 1923, they resettled in the cities of western Anatolia. The most widely known Efes are Y√∂r√ºk Ali Efe, Demirci Mehmet Efe, Kƒ±llƒ±oƒülu H√ºseyin Efe, Postlu Mestan Efe, At√ßalƒ± Kel Mehmet Efe, Molla Ahmet Efe, Sa√ßlƒ± Efe, G√∂k√ßen Huseyin Efe, Mesutlu Mestan Efe, and √áakƒ±rcalƒ± Mehmet Efe, and Efe Karanci.

He later represented Thirsk in Parliament. His son, the second Baronet, also represented Thirsk as well as Hedon in the House of Commons. In 1683 Frankland married Elizabeth Russell, daughter of Sir John Russell, 4th Baronet, of Chippenham and his wife Frances Cromwell, daughter of Oliver Cromwell. His son, the third Baronet, sat as a Member of Parliament for Harwich and Thirsk and served as a Lord of the Admiralty from 1730 to 1741. He was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Baronet, who notably served as Consul- General in Lisbon. The fourth Baronet's younger brother, the fifth Baronet, was an Admiral of the White and also represented Thirsk in Parliament for over 30 years. His son, the sixth Baronet, was a Fellow of the Royal Society and a Member of Parliament for Thirsk. It was the sixth baronet who built Thirkleby Hall. His son, the seventh Baronet, also represented Thirsk in the House of Commons. In 1837 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Russell after Frankland on inheriting Chequers Court in Buckinghamshire from his kinsman Sir Robert Greenhill-Russell, 1st Baronet, of Chequers Court. He was succeeded in the Baronetcy but not in the estates by his cousin, the eighth Baronet. He was the son of the youngest son of the fifth Baronet. Frankland notably fought at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. His grandson, the tenth Baronet, married as his second wife Mary Cecil Frankland, 16th Baroness Zouche (see the Baron Zouche). He was succeeded by his eldest son, the eleventh Baronet, and on the latter's death in 1944 the title passed to his only son, the twelfth and present holder of the Baronetcy. In 1965 he succeeded his grandmother as eighteenth Baron Zouche. Consequently, the Baronetcy is now a subsidiary title of the Barony of Zouche.

The band's name was later changed to Industry. Caronia and Geyer worked with experimental electronic music, odd time signatures, tape loops, synthesizers and innovative guitar playing into various methods of recording. In 1981, Geyer and Kelly left the band. Guitarist Brian Unger, new lead singer Jon Carin and Rudy Perrone (who was previously in a progressive rock band called Cathedral, with Mercury Caronia) joined the group which signed to Capitol Records. The band's best-known single, \\"State of the Nation\\", entered the Swedish and Italian charts between 1983 and 1984, earning them a place as the support act for artists such as Billy Idol, Talk Talk and INXS. The second single from the same album, \\"Still of the Night\\", was less successful. The band split up in 1984. Post-split After the split, Carin started a successful session musician and solo career, becoming a permanent member of the Pink Floyd live band and co-writing Pink Floyd's hit single \\"Learning to Fly\\". Unger and Perrone went on to form their own bands. Reformation In October 2014, Mercury Caronia, Andy Geyer, Sean Kelly and Steven Northshield reformed as a band, naming themselves 'MASS', before changing the group's name back to 'Industry'.

As a county council, it was governed by the Local Government Act 2001. The council had 28 elected members. Elections for the council were held every five years and were by single transferable vote. The head of the council had the title of Cathaoirleach (Chairperson). The county council was originally based at Limerick Courthouse and then moved to County Buildings in O'Connell Street in two stages; Nos. 82 and 83 were acquired in 1911 and Nos. 80 and 81 in 1966. The county council then moved to County Hall, Dooradoyle in 2003. Limerick County Council was also responsible of a large proportion of Limerick city's suburbs. The remaining areas of Limerick city were under the authority of Limerick City Council which was a separate authority. It was abolished in 2014 when the Local Government Reform Act 2014 was implemented. It was succeeded by Limerick City and County Council.

Bhutia Busty monastery or Karma Dorjee Chyoling monastery is a Buddhist monastery located in Bhutia Busty, Darjeeling district, India. It belongs to the Red Sect of Buddhist Lamas. History Originally a branch of the Nyingma sect's Phodang Monastery in Sikkim, it was transferred to Darjeeling in 1879. The original location was on the Observatory Hill. The monastic practice was violently interrupted around 1788, when Nepali troops overran the land, destroyed the monastery and converted Dotsug into a place of worship dedicated to Mahakala. The foreign troops were driven out by the British East India Company during the Anglo- Nepalese War and the territory was returned to the Chogyal of Sikkim in 1817. In the 1860s the monastery was relocated to its present location in Bhutia Busty. However, the monastery in the new location was also destroyed by an earthquake in 1934. The Chogyal of Sikkim helped rebuild it. The monastery has a collection of old Buddhist scripts. One of the original pieces of the \\"Book of Dead\\" is its prized possession. The 193-year-old Sangchhen Thongdor Ling Gonpa or Ging Gompa (8 kilometers from town) which was set up by Pemayangtse monastery (West Sikkim) in 1818 also belongs to the Red hat sects.

Publishing history =The original collection= The original Story Teller was released from December 1982 and throughout 1983 as a fortnightly partwork. Each magazine contained a selection of children's stories, some traditional folk tales like \\"Anansi the Spiderman\\", some children's tales such as Gobbolino, the Witch's Cat, and some contemporary works written especially for the series, like \\"Timbertwig\\". Most issues contained a poem or two, as well. The stories were accompanied by lavish colour artwork, and inside each issue was an offer to purchase custom made binders for the magazine as well as cases to hold the tapes. Each issue of Story Teller came with a cover-mounted cassette tape containing a reading of the stories, complete with music and sound effects. What set Story Teller apart from other partworks was the stories were read by professional actors and celebrities of the time, including Richard Briers, Sheila Hancock, Derek Jacobi, and Nigel Lambert. Two distinguishing features of the audio cassettes were the \\"Story Teller\\" jingle that introduced and ended each tape and the characteristic \\"ping\\" that sounded when the time came to turn the pages to encourage children to read along. The \\"Story Teller\\" jingle is an existing track called \\"Children's Carnival\\" by Ted Atking and Alain Feanch.MobiusVideo posted the theme at YouTube, under the title: \\"Story Teller Theme Tune Rag Time Style\\".Cyberhops posted the theme at YouTube, under the title \\"Ted Atking and Alain Feanch - Children's Carnival\\" Longer stories were split over multiple issues to encourage parents to buy the next issue. These were referred to as Story Teller Serials. As one serial came to end, another would start. Many of these would be simple two-part stories, but a selection of stories (usually well-known ones such as Peter Pan and the Wizard of Oz) were spread over several issues. Pinocchio was the longest serial, with seven installments. The original collection was 26 issues long with each tape lasting up to 45 minutes. An exception was issue 26, which was 90 minutes long because it also contained the special preview issue for Story Teller 2, which immediately followed the original series. (The New Zealand and Australian Story Time only ran for 1 series, so the final Issue 26 was the standard 45 minutes long and did not feature the special preview for the next series. This was the sole difference between its UK counterpart; the cassettes and artwork were otherwise identical. Similarly, the cassette carry case was available in Australia. However, in New Zealand, a smaller box was provided, made out of cardboard wrapped in a red plastic with small domes at the corners joining it all together and a piece of Velcro for the flap on the top). =Storyteller 2= Story Teller 2, which was previewed in issue 26 of the original Story Teller series in the UK, continued the tradition of the original by combining traditional and contemporary children's stories. (In New Zealand and Australia, Story Time only ran for 1 series.) =Little Story Teller= When Story Teller 2 ended, Marshall Cavendish followed it up with another 26-part series, Little Story Teller, which, as its title suggests, was aimed at a younger audience than the original series. Many of the stories in Little Story Teller featured the adventures of the inhabitants of the Magic Mountain, which included Leroy the Lion, Dotty the Dragon, and Morris and Doris the hamsters. =Christmas specials= Three Christmas specials were also published. Released annually along with each series, the Christmas Story Tellers featured festive stories and even songs. The third Christmas Story Teller included stories suited to both the original series and Little Story Teller. Of the Christmas specials only Christmas Story 2 was made available in New Zealand or Australia, under the title of Christmas Story Time. =Story Teller Song Book= Christmas Story 3 was widely assumed to be the last title from the Story Teller series but in 1986, Marshall Cavendish released the Story Teller Song Book. The 52-page publication contained 20 all-time sing-along favourites rather than stories but it still retained the Story Teller tradition of featuring colouring and activity pages as well as an accompanying cassette tape. =My Big Book of Fairy Tales= In 1987, Marshall Cavendish revisited the world of Story Teller by publishing a big hardback book called My Big Book of Fairy Tales. Although the publication lacked the Story Teller branding, it was essentially a compilation of the best stories from Story Teller; it contained 73 stories from the two series and three Christmas issues. The original text and illustrations were used, except for the story \\"The Frog Prince\\", which featured new artwork (for no apparent reason). The book was rereleased in 1989 with a different cover and again in 1994. Unlike the partwork, My Big Book of Fairy Tales was not accompanied by a cassette. =Availability= The partwork is now regarded as highly collectible, and issues can still be found today in secondhand and charity shops, but finding a complete set can be very difficult. Digital copies can also be found on auction sites such as eBay, but these are of dubious legality.

In addition to \\"clones\\" of the Story Teller series, several paperback books containing selections from the actual Story Teller series were released (with accompanying cassettes) in the US, under the title \\"Look, Listen and Read\\". These compilations contained stories or themes that related to each other, either by author or content. Examples include The Best of Aesop, The Legend of King Arthur, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Rapunzel. =Disney's Storytime= The main differentiator between Story Teller and Disney's Storytime was the fact that the latter featured only Disney characters. Storytime hit newsagents' shelves soon after Story Teller proved to be a bestseller. It was published in 24 parts and customised binders and cassette boxes were produced to house the collection (just like Story Teller). Disney movies, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Sleeping Beauty (1959), were serialised. (Note: the Australian and New Zealand versions of Story Teller were published as Story Time - not to be confused with Disney's Storytime series.)

Origins Ogilvy was born at 60 George StreetEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1805 in Edinburgh on 17 March 1803, eldest of the nine children of Sir William Ogilvy (sometimes Ogilvie), and his wife, Sarah Morley (Lady Ogilvy). He was educated at Harrow School and Christ Church, Oxford where he matriculated on 5 November 1821. He succeeded to the family baronetcy on the death of his father in 1823. Career With his wife Lady Jane Ogilvy, he was largely responsible for the foundation of Baldovan Institute in 1852, Scotland's first residential hospital for learning disabled children. He was closely involved, along with Dr James Arrott, the head physician, in the moving of Dundee Royal Infirmary to a new site, and played a prominent part in the laying of the foundation stone for the new building on 22 July 1852. He also established the Dundee Corn Exchange in 1856. He made an unsuccessful attempt to represent Montrose in parliament when a by-election was called there in 1855. He had better luck in the general election two years later, when he was elected to represent Dundee.

Some salient provisions of the legislation are as follows: * A government institution may not collect personal information unless it relates directly to an operating program or activity of the institution (section 4). * With some exceptions, when a government institution collects an individual's personal information from the individual, it must inform the individual of the purpose for which the information is being collected (section 5(2)). * With some exceptions, personal information under the control of a government institution may be used only for the purpose for which the information was obtained or for a use consistent with that purpose, unless the individual consents (section 7). * With some exceptions, personal information under the control of a government institution may not be disclosed, unless the individual consents (section 8). *Every Canadian citizen or permanent resident has the right to be given access to personal information about the individual under the control of a government institution that is reasonably retrievable by the government institution, and request correction if the information is inaccurate (section 12). *A government institution can refuse requests for access to personal information in four cases: *#The request interferes with the responsibilities of the government, such as national defence and law enforcement investigations (sections 19-25) *#The request contains the personal information of someone other than the individual who made the request (section 26). *#The request is subject to solicitor-client privilege (section 27). *#A request for an individual's own medical records can be rejected if there is no benefit to the individual in reading it (section 28). * The Privacy Commissioner of Canada receives and investigates complaints, including complaints that an individual was denied access to his or her personal information held by a government institution (section 29).  History  The first privacy law in Canada was enacted in 1977 in part four of the Canadian Human Rights Act by creating the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada, which would be responsible for investigating privacy violation complaints by members of the public and reporting to lawmakers. During the 32nd Parliament in 1983, Bill C-43 was passed. This legislation created the Privacy Act and the Access to Information Act, separate from the Canadian Human Rights Act. Case law An individual who has been refused access to personal information may ultimately apply to the Federal Court for a review of the matter, pursuant to section 41 of the Act. The Court may order the head of the government institution to disclose the information to the individual (sections 48 and 49). Decisions of the Federal Court on such matters may be appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal, and, if leave is granted, further appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Some important court decision concerning the Privacy Act are: * Canada (Information Commissioner) v. Canada (Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police), 2003 SCC 8 (considering the definition of \\"personal information\\" in section 3 of the Privacy Act) * Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2002 SCC 75 (holding that section 51(2)(a) of the Privacy Act is unconstitutional because it requires that the entire hearing of certain applications to Federal Court be held in camera) * Lavigne v. Canada (Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages), 2002 SCC 53 (holding that the Privacy Act is 'quasi-constitutional' legislation, and considering section 22(1)(b), the exemption for information the disclosure of which could be injurious to the conduct of lawful investigations) * Privacy Act (Can.) (Re), 2001 SCC 89 (holding that the Privacy Act was not violated by a program whereby Canada Customs gave information about travellers to the Canada Employment Insurance Commission, to identify those who received employment insurance benefits while outside Canada) * Dagg v.

The pilot film first aired on May 4, 1975 and the series itself premiered September 8, 1975; the last episode aired January 9, 1976. Barbary Coast was inspired by a similar 19th-century spy series, The Wild Wild West, and like the earlier program, Barbary Coast mixed the genres of Western and secret agent drama. Synopsis Doug McClure in Barbary Coast Barbary Coast features the adventures of 19th century government agent Jeff Cable (played by William Shatner), and his pal, conman and gambler Cash (\\"Cash makes no enemies\\") Conover (Doug McClure; played by Dennis Cole in the pilot) who is the owner of the Golden Gate Casino. This was Shatner's first attempt at a live-action series since Star Trek (also produced by Paramount Television). In their battle against various criminals and foreign spies, Cable and Conover operated out of the latter's saloon and casino located on San Francisco's notorious Barbary Coast. Like Wild Wild West's Artemus Gordon, Cable frequently donned disguises in the course of his investigations. The producers modeled the show's Byzantine plotlines/conspiracies on the Mission: Impossible paradigm (in fact, they hired a number of Mission: Impossible's writers). Other regulars on the series included recurring Wild Wild West villain actor Richard Kiel as Moose Moran and Dave Turner as Thumbs.

As of 2020, the Act allowed \\"people who pay $5 to request an array of federal files\\". Paragraph 2. (1) of the Act (\\"Purpose\\") declares that government information should be available to the public, but with necessary exceptions to the right of access that should be limited and specific, and that decisions on the disclosure of government information should be reviewed independently of government. Later paragraphs assign responsibility for this review to an Information Commissioner, who reports directly to parliament rather than the government in power. However, the Act provides the commissioner the power only to recommend rather than compel the release of requested information that the commissioner judges to be not subject to any exception specified in the Act. Historical synopsis By 1982, Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, and the U.S. (1966), had enacted modern Freedom of information legislation. Canada's Access to Information Act came into force in 1983, under the Pierre Trudeau government, permitting Canadians to retrieve information from government files, establishing what information could be accessed, mandating timelines for response. By the standards of that era, it came to be considered a model of good practice, having taken the implementation of the law more seriously than other countries. The Act created new offices staffed with trained professionals to manage the inflow of requests, and developed formal procedures to encourage prompt processing of requests. Furthermore, the Information Commissioner served as an easily accessible ombudsperson to arbitrate cases of possible maladministration. A complementary Privacy Act also came into force in 1983. The purpose of this Act was to extend the present laws of Canada that protect the privacy of individuals with respect to personal information about themselves held by a federal government institution and that provide individuals with a right of access to that information. It is a Crown copyright. This Act stipulates that complaints about possible violations of the Act may be reported to the Privacy Commissioner. In 1998, following the Somalia Affair, a clause was appended to the Act, making it a federal offence to destroy, falsify, or conceal public documents. Canadian access to information laws distinguish between access to records generally and access to records that contain personal information about the person making the request. Subject to exceptions, individuals have a right of access to records that contain their own personal information under the Privacy Act but the general public does not have a right of access to records that contain personal information about others under the Access to Information Act. From 1989 to 2008, requests made to the federal government were catalogued in the Coordination of Access to Information Requests System (CAIRS). Although CAIRS was not originally designed for public use, the information contained in the database generated substantial and continued public interest. Two non- governmental websites offered information from CAIRS to the public with a search facility. In April 2008, the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper terminated the maintenance of this database. Proposed refinements =Mulroney government= In 1987, the Solicitor General tabled a report to Parliament with the authorship and unanimous support of a \\"Justice Committee\\" consisting of the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice together with himself, entitled Open and Shut: Enhancing the Right to Know and the Right to Privacy. It contained over 100 recommendations for amending the ATI and Privacy Acts. Many of these dealt with exemptions from access, recommending the addition of a discretionary injury test in most cases, which would evaluate \\"the harm to the interest (e.g., the conduct of international affairs) that could reasonably be expected to result from disclosure\\". The Committee proposed that the complete exclusion of Cabinet records from the operation of the Act be deleted and replaced with an exemption that would not be subject to an injury test. This crucial change would have allowed the Information Commissioner and the Federal Court of Canada to review alleged \\"cabinet documents\\" in order to determine whether or not they are, in fact, Cabinet confidences and eligible for exemption. The government response to the report, published in 1987 by the Minister of Supply and Services and entitled \\"Access and Privacy: The Steps Ahead\\", generally supported the administrative, but not the legislative, changes proposed in the Justice Committee report. The concept of significant injury as a basis for the application of exemptions was rejected and the exemption for information received in confidence from other governments was justified on the basis that, \\"[t]he willingness of other governments to continue to share their information with Canada would likely be adversely affected by the lesser degree of protection which would be given if these recommendations were implemented\\". =Chretien government= In 2000, Information Commissioner John Grace presented his case for reform of the Act. He recognized that \\"while the Act has served well in enshrining the right to know, it has also come to express a single-request, often confrontational approach to providing information ‚Äì an approach which is too slow and cumbersome for an information society.\\" He made forty-three recommendations for updating the Act. In August 2000, the Minister of Justice and the President of the Treasury Board launched a task force to review the Act. The committee's report delivered in June 2002, entitled, Access to Information: Making it Work for Canadians, found \\"a crisis in information management\\" within the government. It made 139 recommendations for legislative, administrative and cultural reform. Nothing came of this report. =Martin government= In the fall of 2003, the Member of Parliament John Bryden attempted to initiate a comprehensive overhaul of the Act through a private members bill, Bill C-462, which died on the Order Paper with the dissolution of the 37th Parliament in May 2004. A similar bill was introduced by NDP MP Pat Martin on 7 October 2004 as Bill C-201. It met a similar fate. In April 2005, the Minister of Justice Irwin Cotler introduced a discussion paper entitled A Comprehensive Framework for Access to Information Reform. Later in 2005, a draft bill, entitled the Open Government Act, was tabled before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. Developed by Information Commissioner John Reid at the request of the Standing Committee, the proposed act included substantial changes to the law.Some information about the development of this draft is available in a document of Notes, Sources and References. A primary objective was to address concerns about a \\"culture of secrecy\\" within political and bureaucratic environments. This draft bill initially received multi-party support, but not enough to result in the introduction by a government or passage in the form of either of two private member's bills based on this draft. =Harper government= Essentially this same draft bill with the same title \\"Open Government Act\\", but with the crucial addition of full order-making powers for record release, was introduced by NDP MP Pat Martin as Bill C-554 in 2008, and as Bill C-301 in 2011. The latter reached First Reading on 29 September in the first session of the 41st Parliament, and then was reinstated in the second session on 16 October 2013. As of September 2014, it remained on the Order Paper awaiting Second Reading. In 2009, the Information Commissioner Robert Marleau appeared before the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics. The Commissioner emphasized that \\"work [was] urgently needed to modernize\\" and strengthen the Act. He presented \\"a list of twelve specific recommendations that represent an important first step\\" to \\"address only the most pressing matters\\". (About 15 weeks later, Mr. Marleau abruptly resigned five years before his normal end of term, for \\"entirely personal and private\\" reasons. This was reported to have raised \\"doubts about the pace and direction of reforms to Canada's access to information laws that he was spearheading.\\" ) On 6 June 2012, the Legal and Legislative Affairs Division of the Parliamentary Information and Research Service published a Library of Parliament Background Paper, entitled The Access to Information Act and Proposals for Reform. The purpose of the Paper was to identify the key points emerging from the major studies of the Act that had been conducted over the previous two decades, and to analyze in some detail some recent proposals concerning the reworking of the legislation. The Paper summarized eleven significant efforts within parliament and the federal government from 1987 to 2009. It then concluded by noting that the Conservative government of Stephen Harper in power in 2011‚àí2012 had proposed to improve access to information, not by amending the Act, but rather by introducing what it called \\"open government\\" and \\"open data\\" initiatives. The Paper goes on to report that, in response, Canada's information and privacy commissioners suggested that the Action Plan on Open Government represents a missed opportunity for comprehensive reform of the Act. Information Commissioner Suzanne Legault suggested in a letter that the government recognizes and supports the relationship between open government and a modernized Act. She observed, \\"Our investigations in recent years have demonstrated not only the obsolescence of the statute but also a number of deficiencies in it which may well impede or hamper the development of a truly open government that is receptive to the needs of its citizens and its economy and in step with other administrations.\\" Progressive erosion in accessibility of federal government information Universit√© de Moncton professor Donald Savoie's 2003 book, Breaking the Bargain, observes that in Canada there is a reluctance to put anything in writing, including e-mail, that might find its way into public discourse. As context, he argues that the role of bureaucracy within the Canadian political machine has never been properly defined, that the relationship between elected and permanent government officials is increasingly problematic and that the public service cannot function if it is expected to be both independent of, and subordinate to, elected officials. In February 2005, the Canadian Newspaper Association published a report entitled In Pursuit of Meaningful Access to Information Reform: Proposals to Strengthen Canadian Democracy. The report was motivated by the increasing difficulty experienced by journalists employed by members of the Association in obtaining \\"information about government that they required to inform the public on matters of national interest\\". The report notes that \\"successive Information Commissioners have criticised a 'culture of secrecy' in Ottawa, in which government departments frustrate the will of Parliament with impunity.\\" A set of twenty specific features of a revised Act were recommended, based on a set of seven \\"Core Principles\\". In 2006, Alasdair Roberts, presently at the Suffolk University Law School and the author of several books on public affairs, presented a report entitled Two Challenges in Administration of the Access to Information Act to the Gomery Commission investigating the Sponsorship scandal in the federal government. In the context of 2006, Prof. Roberts found that \\"In many respects, Canadian practice [was] superior to practice under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), although the popular conception [was] often the reverse, and also superior to emerging practice under the more recently drafted UK FOIA\\". The Two Challenges that he identified were Adversarialism in the administration of the Act, and the excessively limited Scope of the Act. Regarding the former, the \\"balance of forces\\" between the \\"sharply opposed interests\\" for and against disclosure may not \\"be preserved over time; one side may prove more skilled at developing new strategies than the other. Evidence suggests that federal institutions have developed techniques for managing politically sensitive requests which now undercut basic principles of the ATIA.\\" These techniques were observed to result in substantial delays in processing information requests perceived to be politically sensitive, possibly because they originated from journalists. Prof. Roberts observed that \\"such delays suggest that a basic principle of the ATIA is widely and routinely flouted by federal institutions. The ATIA is supposed to respect the rule of equal treatment: a presumption that requests for information will be treated similarly, without regard to the profession of the requester or the purpose for which the information is sought\\". Regarding Scope, Prof. Roberts observed that \\"a longstanding difficulty with the ATIA has been its failure to include many key federal institutions. For many years, the difficulty [had] centered on the exclusion of Crown Corporations; more recently, the problem has extended to include government contractors and a range of quasi- governmental entities that perform critical public functions.\\" In September 2008, a 393-page report, sponsored by several Canadian newspaper groups together with the B.C. Freedom of Information and Privacy Association and two Vancouver lawyers, compared Canada's Access to Information Act to the \\"Freedom of Information\\" laws of the provinces and of 68 other nations. As the title of the report implies: \\"Fallen Behind: Canada's Access to Information Act in the World Context\\", it concludes that \\"Canada surely needs to at least raise its own FOI laws up to the best standards of its Commonwealth partners‚Äìand then, hopefully, look beyond the Commonwealth to consider the rest of the world. This is not a radical or unreasonable goal at all, for to reach it, Canadian parliamentarians need not leap into the future but merely step into the present.\\" In 2009, Justice Minister Rob Nicholson was reported to have emphatically told the House of Commons Standing Committee on Access to Information, Privacy and Ethics on 4 May that: \\"I want you to know that I completely disagree with anybody who would suggest that this country has a dismal record on anything related to access to information issues\\". Mr. Nicholson went on to say \\"this country has an outstanding record, and if anyone has anything different to say, then I say they are completely wrong.\\" On 29 September 2009, Stanley Tromp, the Freedom of Information caucus coordinator of the Canadian Association of Journalists and author of the 2008 Fallen Behind report, addressed the Conference for Parliamentarians: Transparency in the Digital Era. Mr. Tromp reported that \\"FOI experts in other countries have publicly noted the forlorn status of our ATI Act in the world context\\". Examples he provided include: * David Banisar, Senior Legal Counsel for the London-based human rights organization ARTICLE 19, wrote in his 2006 Global FOI Survey \\"There is wide recognition that the ATI Act, which is largely unchanged since its adoption, is in need of drastic updating\\". * Australian law professor Rick Snell called the Canadian Act \\"fairly abysmal,\\" and Ottawa's approach to providing information as a 19th-century, horse-and- buggy attempt at \\"managing secrecy.\\" * A report from the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative found that the right of access in Canada \\"falls short\\" of compliance with Article 19 of the 1976 United Nations' International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In October 2010, an international comparison of access to government information ranked Canada last among four commonwealth nations together with ireland; a significant change from only a decade earlier when the country often served as a model for freedom of information internationally. The University College London study comparing Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Ireland was published in Government Information Quarterly. In September 2014, a book was published entitled Irresponsible Government: The Decline of Parliamentary Democracy in Canada. The author is Brent Rathgeber, sitting as an Independent Member of Parliament in 2014 since his resignation from the Conservative caucus in 2013. He had formerly been a Progressive Conservative member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta. In the book, Mr. Rathgeber contrasted the current state of Canadian democracy to the founding principles of responsible government established by the Fathers of Confederation in 1867. He examined the consequences of the inability or disincentive of modern elected representatives to perform their constitutionally mandated duty to hold the prime minister and his cabinet to account and the resultant disregard with which the executive now views Parliament. With this as context, Mr. Rathgeber devoted Chapter 11 to Withholding the power: Canada's broken Access to Information laws. He conveyed the opinion of Information Commissioner Suzanne Legault that two of the most fundamental shortcomings of the present Act were that it was not updated to cope with either the impact of digital information technology or the increase in scale and complexity of government and the centralization and concentration of decision making. Another key problem is that the commissioner lacks the power to compel rather than only recommend the release of requested information that does not merit secrecy on the basis of limited, justifiable grounds, a power that exists in other jurisdictions including several Canadian provinces. To add to the problem, the list of exceptions available in the existing Act had grown much larger in recent years. Mr. Rathgeber reported the commissioner to have said that \\"Canada's access regime [was] so dysfunctional that the RCMP has actually stopped responding to access requests entirely, and the Department of National Defence has stated that it will require 1100 days to complete a single request it has been working on\\". He also noted \\"a growing body of evidence that government bureaucrats, and especially political staff, are conducting their business verbally, without retaining notes, or alternatively, are exchanging correspondences through private email addresses and/or employing digital devices that leave no trace\\". The commissioner was reported to recommend that a reworked Act should correct the aforementioned shortcomings as well as extend the act to cover Parliament, including parliamentary administration, and ministers' offices, where much of the policy development and decision making regarding taxpayer dollars is done. In September 2014, Canadian Press reported that a previously obscure Treasury Board directive in the summer of 2013 introduced a policy that required federal bureaucrats to consult departmental lawyers about whether documents should be classified as secrets. Such decisions were formerly made by the Privy Council Office (PCO), the secretariat of the federal cabinet. After the policy change, the PCO is consulted in \\"complex cases only\\", a practice that was described as \\"outrageous\\" by Errol Mendes, a constitutional expert at the University of Ottawa and former Senior Advisor to the PCO. He stated that only the PCO is fully informed about whether a document has been prepared for ‚Äî or seen by ‚Äî the federal cabinet and is, therefore, eligible for exclusion. The effect of the directive was the suppression of a much wider range of documents, doubling the rate of complaints to the Information Commissioner, an independent ombudsman. Suzanne Legault, the Commissioner incumbent in this period, expressed concern, describing the scope of the new basis for exclusion from release as \\"extremely broad\\", and failing to \\"respect fundamental tenets of freedom of information\\". Liberal Member of Parliament John McKay described his attempts to extract information required to make \\"independent judgments\\" in the fulfillment of parliamentary duties as \\"an exercise in frustration\\". Complaints were expressed also by news media as well as federal officers responsible for oversight, including the Auditor General, the Parliamentary Budget Officer, and the military ombudsman. Michael Ferguson (Auditor General) said that his attempts in early 2014 to audit public pension plans to evaluate their long-term health had been stymied by bureaucrats at Department of Finance and Treasury Board. Kevin Page, the Parliamentary Budget Officer during the period 2008‚àí2013, stated that neither Parliament nor his office could obtain the information that it needed. He elaborated: \\"the government was asking Parliament to vote on bills without relevant financial information and were hiding behind the veil of cabinet confidence. This undermined accountability for Parliament and the accountability of the public service.\\" He concluded that the Act required a major revision.

He is a former head coach of Sale Sharks, England Under 21s, England Saxons and Northampton Saints. Playing career In his playing days, Mallinder was a fullback at Sale Sharks, where he stayed for 15 years as a player and a coach. He was formerly a PE and Mathematics teacher at William Hulme's Grammar School in Manchester before the game turned professional. He retired from playing in 2001 after nearly 400 games for Sale and two England caps. Coaching career =Sale Sharks and England roles= Mallinder was appointed as the Sharks' head coach in 2001 after retiring from his playing career. In his first season, he took the Sharks from 11th to 2nd in the Premiership and their first Heineken Cup qualification. In 2002 he led Sale to the Parker Pen Shield, now the European Challenge Cup, and their first silverware. In 2004 Mallinder left Sale to take up a post in the RFU's National Academy. There he worked with Brian Ashton and Dorian West, as he masterminded the England Under 21s into winning the Under 21s' version of the Six Nations in 2006 with a clean sweep of five wins out of five. He was also named by UK Sport in their prestigious Elite Coach scheme. He was subsequently handed the reins of the England Saxons, where he had an impressive record of 15 wins from 16 matches. His last match in charge saw the Saxons defeat the New Zealand Maori at Twickenham to win the Churchill Cup. =Northampton Saints= In June 2007, Mallinder took up the post of head coach at the recently relegated Northampton Saints. In his first year there, he led the Saints straight back to the Guinness Premiership with an undefeated \\"perfect\\" season. On 25 June 2008, he signed a new 3-year contract to remain at Franklin's Gardens until at least the end of the 2010/11 season. In preparation for the 2008‚Äì09 season, Mallinder raided his former club Sale Sharks, signing Ben Foden, Chris Mayor, Christian Day and Ignacio Fern√°ndez Lobbe where they joined other former Sale colleagues, Barry Stewart and Nick Johnson. In addition Mallinder brought players like Roger Wilson and Neil Best to the Saints from Ulster, and the squad he put together finished eighth in their first year back in the Premiership, as well as reaching the semi-finals of the Anglo-Welsh Cup. An unbeaten pool campaign in the European Challenge Cup brought home advantage in the knockout stages, and after beating Connacht and Saracens the Saints defeated Bourgoin at the Twickenham Stoop to lift their first piece of major silverware in a decade and secure a place in the Heineken Cup in the process. The 2009/10 season was another campaign of progression for the Saints, who won their first major domestic trophy, the Anglo-Welsh Cup, by beating Gloucester at Worcester's Sixways Stadium. The Saints won more Premiership games than anyone else to finish second in the table, but were beaten in the semi-final with just a few minutes remaining. In the Heineken Cup the Saints reached the quarter finals. 2010/11 saw Mallinder become the first coach to guide a team unbeaten through the Heineken Cup pool stages and all the way to the final. At the Millennium Stadium the Saints put in their best first half performance in many years, but were pegged back by Leinster and eventually lost the game. Northampton were defeated by East Midlands rivals Leicester Tigers in the 2012/13 Premiership final, but became Premiership champions for the first time the following year, defeating Saracens in extra time to clinch the 2013/14 season trophy. This followed success in the Amlin Challenge Cup final against Bath Rugby the previous week, representing an historic double trophy winning season for the club. On 2 June 2014 Mallinder signed a new five-year contract, keeping him at Northampton until 2019. Northampton Saints suffered a series of heavy defeats early in the 2017/18 season, winning one game from ten in all competitions. As a result of this poor run of form, including a heavy defeat to a massively depleted Ospreys side, Mallinder was sacked at the Director of Rugby on 12 December 2017, with Attack Coach Alan Dickens taking on the role of head coach in the interim term. =England Rugby= Mallinder was offered the role of head coach at Cardiff Blues in February 2018 but turned down the role. In June he was announced as the new performance pathway coach at England Rugby, working with young players. =Scottish Rugby Union= In August 2019 Mallinder was appointed Performance Director of the Scottish Rugby Union.

As a result of the derailment, more than 200,000 people were evacuated in what was the largest peacetime evacuation in North America until the New Orleans evacuations during Hurricane Katrina. There were no deaths resulting from the incident. This was the last major explosion in the Greater Toronto Area until the Sunrise Propane blast in 2008. Causes On the 33rd car, heat began to build up in an improperly-lubricated journal bearing on one of the wheels, one of the few still in use at that time as most had long since been replaced with roller bearings, resulting in the condition known among train workers as a \\"hot box\\". Residents living beside the tracks reported smoke and sparks coming from the car, and those who were close to Mississauga thought the train was afire. The friction eventually burned through the axle and bearing, and as the train was passing the Mavis Road level crossing, a wheelset (one axle and pair of wheels) fell off completely. Explosion and evacuation At 11:53 p.m., at the Mavis Road crossing, the damaged bogie (undercarriage) left the track, causing the remaining parts of the train to derail. The impact caused several tank cars filled with propane to burst into flames. The derailment also ruptured several other tankers, spilling styrene, toluene, propane, caustic soda, and chlorine onto the tracks and into the air. A huge explosion resulted, sending a fireball into the sky which could be seen from away. As the flames were erupting, the train's brakeman, Larry Krupa, 27, at the suggestion of the engineer (also his father- in-law), managed to close an air brake angle spigot at the west end of the undamaged 32nd car, allowing the engineer to release the air brakes between the locomotives and the derailed cars and move the front part of the train eastward along the tracks, away from danger. This prevented those cars from becoming involved in the fire, important as many of them also contained dangerous goods. Mr. Krupa was later recommended for the Order of Canada for his bravery, which a later writer has described as \\"bordering on lunacy.\\" After more explosions, firefighters concentrated on cooling cars, allowing the fire to burn itself out, but a ruptured chlorine tank became a cause for concern. With the possibility of a deadly cloud of chlorine gas spreading through suburban Mississauga, more than 200,000 people were evacuated. A number of residents (mostly the extreme west and north of Mississauga) allowed evacuees to stay with them until the crisis abated. Some of these people were later moved again as their hosts were also evacuated. The evacuation was managed by various officials including the mayor of Mississauga, Hazel McCallion, the Peel Regional Police and other governmental authorities. McCallion sprained her ankle early during the crisis, but continued to hobble to press conferences. Aftermath Within a few days Mississauga was practically deserted, until the contamination had been cleared, the danger neutralized and residents were allowed to return to their homes. The city was finally reopened on the evening of November 16. The chlorine tank was emptied on November 19. It was the largest peacetime evacuation in North American history until the evacuation of New Orleans due to Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and remained the second-largest until Hurricane Irma in 2017. Due to the speed and efficiency with which it was conducted, many cities later studied and modelled their own emergency plans after Mississauga's. As a result of the accident, rail regulators in both the U.S. and Canada required that any line used to carry hazardous materials into or through a populated area have hotbox detectors.Bibel, 174 Larry Krupa was inducted into the North America Railway Hall of Fame for his contribution to the railway industry. He was recognized in the \\"National\\" division of the \\"Railway Workers & Builders\\" category.The North America Railway Hall of Fame  Inductees: Larry Krupa The city of Mississauga sued CP in hopes of holding the railroad responsible for the massive emergency services bill. However, the city dropped its suit after CP dropped its longstanding opposition to passenger service on its trackage near Mississauga. This cleared the way for GO Transit to open the Milton line two years later. Hazel McCallion, in her first term as mayor at the time of the accident, was continuously re-elected ever since until her retirement in 2014 at age 93. The song Trainwreck 1979 by Canadian band Death From Above 1979 is about the derailment: It ran off the track, 11-79 While the immigrants slept, there wasn't much time The mayor came calling and got 'em outta bed They packed up their families and headed upwind A poison cloud, a flaming sky, 200,000 people and no one died And all before the pocket dial, yeah!

From Southern Wildflowers and Trees. Alice Lounsberry (6 November 1873 in New York City - 1949) was an American botanist and author active in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. (Some sources give her birth year as 1872.) She worked closely with the Australian botanical artist Ellis Rowan, publishing three books with her as illustrator.  Biography  Lounsberry was the daughter of James Smith Lounsberry and Sarah Woodruff (Burrows) Lounsberry. She was educated at Mrs. Sylvanus Reed's School, New York City (Leonard, 1914). Lounsberry came to visit Ellis Rowan when Rowan was hospitalized with influenza in Washington, D.C., circa 1896-1897 (Samuel 1961). Lounsberry then proposed that the artist illustrate her upcoming book on wildflowers. Rowan agreed, changing plans to return to Europe. Over a period of two or more years, the two traveled over the Southeastern United States in search of native plants. The first year, they traveled to Florida, exploring the St. Johns River, among other sites. They then visited the Southern Appalachian region, including Roan Mountain, Tennessee and Grandfather Mountain, North Carolina. The next year they returned to that region, working at the herbarium of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. Presumably this is where Lounsberry became acquainted with Chauncey Beadle. According to Samuel (1961), it was while in Asheville that Rowan received news that her son Eric (called \\"Puck\\") had been killed in Africa. This would have taken place in the period 1899-1900, presumably during the Second Boer War (1899-1902). Lounsberry and Rowan did not work on another book after Southern Wildflowers and Trees was published in 1901. Rowan went on to tour the western United States, and returned to Australia circa 1904-1905. Lounsberry wrote several more works on botany and gardening, but none seemed to enjoy the popularity of her works with Rowan, based on their abundance on the used book market, circa 2006.

This indicates a date of approximately 1897 for their meeting. *The National Library of Australia account, Flower Hunter, states the death of Rowan's son occurred shortly after Rowan arrived in America, but this may be a reference to the death of her father. *Lounsberry is listed as the author of The Land of the Garden of Allah in this genealogical source, apparently quoting Sandusky Star Journal, Sandusky, Ohio, 8 Oct 1907. This is likely an error. The Stokes company published an edition of Garden of Allah by Robert Hichens in 1907, see The Book Art of Richard Minsky. This was perhaps taken for a work by Lounsberry in an advertisement by the publisher for several books.

Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley, who had rented a house nearby, were frequent visitors. Because of poor weather, in June 1816 the group famously spent three days together inside the house creating stories to tell each other, two of which were developed into landmark works of the Gothic horror genre: Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and The Vampyre, the first modern vampire story, by Polidori. Origin Originally called the ‚ÄúVilla Belle Rive‚Äù, Byron named it the Villa Diodati after the family that owned it. The family was distantly related to Italian translator Giovanni Diodati, uncle of Charles Diodati, the close friend of poet John Milton. Despite the presence of a plaque at the Villa heralding a supposed visit of Milton in 1638, in fact the villa was not built until 1710, long after Milton's death.\\"Milton and the Villa Diodati\\", William S. Clark, Review of English Studies, 1935:os-XI: 51-57. Summer of 1816 Portrait of Byron by Thomas Phillips Lord Byron rented the Villa from 10 June to 1 November 1816. The scandal of his separation from his wife, rumours of an affair with his half-sister, and ever-increasing debt, had forced him to leave England, never to return, in April of that year.Jerome McGann, \\"Byron, George Gordon Noel, sixth Baron Byron\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Byron arrived at Lake Geneva in May where he met and befriended the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley who was travelling with his future wife Mary Godwin (now better known as Mary Shelley). Byron settled at the Villa Diodati with his personal physician, John William Polidori, and Shelley rented a smaller house called \\"Maison Chapuis\\" on the waterfront nearby. The group was also joined by Mary's stepsister, Claire Clairmont, with whom Byron had had an affair in London.Gittings, Robert and Jo Manton. Claire Clairmont and the Shelleys; p.33.

Mary Shelley produced what would become Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, and Polidori was inspired by a fragmentary story of Byron's, Fragment of a Novel, to produce The Vampyre, the progenitor of the Romantic vampire genre.Sunstein, Emily W.

This event has also been inspiration for other artists, such as the Colombian writer William Ospina who dedicated his novel, El a√±o del Verano que nunca lleg√≥, to the villa, the remarkable guests who inhabited it and the events that served as inspiration for literature since then. Subsequent history After Byron's death, the Villa Diodati soon became a place of pilgrimage for devotees of Byron, and of Romanticism. The French writer Honor√© de Balzac, who had become obsessed with the villa, had one of the characters in his 1836 novel Albert Savarus remark that the Villa Diodati is \\"now visited by everybody, just like Coppet and Ferney\\" (the homes of Madame de Sta√´l and Voltaire respectively). The villa has remained in private ownership. In 1945, the French artist Balthus moved into the property for a short period. The columnist Taki has written that when he visited the Villa Diodati in 1963 with the Belgian tennis player Philippe Washer it was then owned by the latter's family. However, the New York Times has reported that, as of 2011, the villa had been split up into \\"luxury apartments\\". In popular culture In 2020 the Villa was featured in the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who, in an episode titled \\"The Haunting of Villa Diodati\\".

It is not a newly built railway line, but a project to upgrade the existing railway line which was opened in 1841 by the Rhenish Railway Company. When it was continued into Belgium in 1843, it became the world's first international railway line. The line inside Germany has a length of about . The first from Cologne to D√ºren have been rebuilt. Since 2002 the line allows for speeds up to . Separate tracks have been built parallel to the high-speed tracks for local S-Bahn traffic. The remaining line from D√ºren to Aachen allows speeds up to with some slower sections. Upgrades of D√ºren‚ÄìAachen are planned for the near future. In Belgium, the high-speed line is continued as HSL 3. Regional- Express services on the line are RE 1 (NRW-Express) and RE 9 (Rhein-Sieg- Express) with push-pull trains with six double-decker carriages. Long-distance trains are operated by Thalys between Paris and Cologne (six pairs of trains each day), three pairs of ICE 3M trains daily between Frankfurt and Brussels Monday to Saturday and a morning ICE 2 between Aachen and Berlin.  History Plans for the construction of a railway between Cologne and the Belgian border began in December 1833 with the issue of concession to the Cologne Railway Committee, which was to develop a line under the direction of Cologne Lord Mayor Johann Adolph Steinberger and the entrepreneur Ludolf Camphausen. The Cologne Railway Committee presented a draft route that would bypass Aachen to reduce costs: the line would run from Eschweiler to Kornelim√ºnster along the Inde and from there to the Belgian border. D√ºren would also not have been connected to the railway. The Aachen merchants resisted this proposal and they founded the Aachen Railway Committee under the direction of David Hansemann and Philipp Heinrich Pastor. This was the beginning of the so-called Eisenbahnstreites zwischen K√∂ln und Aachen (railway dispute between Cologne and Aachen). In October, the Aachen Railway Committee presented an alternative proposal for the route that ran from Cologne via D√ºren and Aachen to the Belgian border. On 6 April 1836, a conference of representatives of the traders of Aachen and Cologne in J√ºlich, chaired by the Oberpr√§sident of the Rhine Province Ernst von Bodelschwingh, could not resolve to the railway dispute. Hansemann and the Aachen cloth manufacturer Joseph van G√ºlpen then travelled to Berlin and lodged an application for a line running through Aachen. In Berlin, lengthy negotiations took place between representatives of Aachen and Cologne. Prussian king Frederick William III decided on 12 February 1837 that the line would run through Aachen and thus ended the railway dispute. Information board at the opening of the line from Cologne to Aachen in D√ºren Burtscheider Viaduct In June 1837, the Aachen and Cologne representatives agreed to the merger of the two committees of their cities and founded the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft), which received a concession to build the line from Cologne to the Belgian border in Herbesthal. Construction of the line began on 11 April 1838. The proposal to develop a direct line from D√ºren to Aachen was discarded due to the geological conditions of the northern Eifel and a curve to the north was adopted between D√ºren and Aachen that is still used by the line. The share capital of 9 million marks was raised to enable the Rhenish Railway to build the line by the issuing of shares. But due to the difficult route, construction costs increased to 21 million marks. The additional costs of 12 million marks were raised by issuing additional shares worth 4.5 million marks and bonds worth 7.5 million marks. The Belgian government alone acquired bonds for 3 million marks. The first section from Cologne to M√ºngersdorf was opened on 2 August 1839, less than four years after the Nuremberg‚ÄìF√ºrth railway, the first German railway, and was the seventh railway on German territory. To this end, open and closed carriages and wagons were delivered by Waggonfabrik Talbot of Aachen using road transport at the beginning of the year. Another section from M√ºngersdorf to L√∂venich was opened on 2 July 1840. The last section from L√∂venich to Aachen was opened on 1 September 1841 with an inaugural trip from Cologne to Aachen and back, during which a banquet for 360 invited guests was held. Regular passenger services on the whole route commenced on 6 September 1841. A panel on the east side of D√ºren station still marks this event. With the connection of the line from Belgium, a special train ran from Antwerp to Cologne on 15 October 1843. This made the line between Cologne and Aachen part of the world's first cross-border railway. The Belgian railways were connected to the French railway network in 1845, so the Cologne-Aachen line handled traffic to and from France. = Operations until the First World War = Initially, the line was single-track and the timetable was set up so that trains leaving from Aachen and Cologne crossed at the multi-track D√ºren station. After the line on the Belgian side had been duplicated, the Rhenish Railway Company decided to duplicate the entire line in 1844. According to a report by Gustav von Mevissen, the president of the Rhenish Railway Company on 20 May 1845, the volume of traffic on the line between Cologne and Aachen exceeded the expectations of the planners in the early years. The passenger traffic was one of the largest in Prussia and the freight traffic was \\"the highest of all continental railways\\". Freight traffic exceeded passenger traffic in 1847. Work on the Aachen‚ÄìEschweiler section is documented as starting in 1848 and was completed in 1852. The Rhenish Railway Company covered the cost by issuing shares and taking out loans. During the German revolutions of 1848‚Äì1849, the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway was used for occasional arms shipments. Numerous factories were soon established along the line and coal mining was also important from the start. The Eschweiler Mining Association (Eschweiler Bergwerks-Verein) established coal storage at the stations of Aachen, D√ºren and Cologne immediately after the opening of a coal loading track. As a result of the opening of the line, the EBV's transport costs fell by two-thirds and contracts were also concluded with the Rhenish Railway Company for coal deliveries to supply its steam locomotives. Every second freight train on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line transported coal from the Aachen coalfield in 1847. The coal from the individual mines was originally carried to the railway line by horsecars on field railway tracks, but were increasingly replaced by standard gauge steam trains. The Reserve colliery (Grube Reserve) was connected to the railway line between Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof and Nothberg in 1865 and the Mariagrube-Stolberg railway was opened in 1870. = First World War and the Occupation= D√ºren station in 1920 The Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway also became increasingly strategic for military traffic to Belgium and for connecting the strategically important Vennbahn. Numerous improvements were carried out from 1912 to 1914 to improve the performance of the line, including the upgrade of tracks and the establishment of an overtaking loop in Derichsweiler. Quadruplication between Langerwehe and Nothberg was planned in 1914, but this was prevented by the outbreak of the First World War. During the war, the railway was used to transport troops and supplies to the western front. After the German declaration of war on France on 3 August 1914, the line was closed to civilian traffic and only used for the transport of troops. Regular traffic resumed in mid-September. The marshalling yard in D√ºren was extended for military reasons as late as 1917. After the First World War, the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway was located in the French occupation zone. France intended to transport raw materials via this line from the Ruhr, which was also occupied, but the German railway workers refused to work with them as passive resistance. During the occupation, the line was blocked to regular traffic several times so that French crews could operate coal trains from the Ruhr to France without having to observe German signalling and rail regulations. Occasional acts of sabotage to prevent these operations were mostly unsuccessful. The line was returned to German control with the end of the occupation of the Rhineland. The Buir rail accident occurred between D√ºren and Horrem on 25 August 1929, resulting in 14 dead and 43 people injured. Due to construction work, trains towards Cologne had to be diverted on the wrong line and the affected points should have been operated at 50 km/h. Due to a mistake on the part of the dispatcher, the Paris‚ÄìWarsaw express ran over these points at full speed and derailed. = Second World War = The Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway was used for military purposes again during the Battle of France. Trains carrying troops and war equipment ran over the line. During the war, the line was a frequent target of air raids, causing damage particularly in Aachen and Cologne. The last through train from Aachen to Cologne ran on 12 September 1944. A refugee train from Eschweiler was strafed on 15 September 1944. The locomotive of a passenger train occupied by about 200 was attacked, so it stopped at H√ºcheln near Langerwehe. Subsequently, a train formed of locked freight wagons was attacked with bombs and gunfire. About 80 people died in the process. Rail traffic from Eschweiler was discontinued on that day. Rail traffic from D√ºren was discontinued after the air raid on D√ºren on 16 November 1944. When German troops withdrew, they blew up bridges, such as parts of the Burtscheid Viaduct and the Three Arch Bridge (Dreibogenbr√ºcke). = Postwar period= After the withdrawal of German troops, Allied troops gradually took over the towns along the line and restored operations, initially on one track. The first passenger trains ran from Aachen to D√ºren on 10 September 1945. A bus service between D√ºren and Cologne was temporarily established in January 1946. Operations were resumed on the whole line on 15 May 1946. Immediately after the line was restored to traffic, the volume of traffic was very high. On the one hand, there was a lack of alternative means of transport, such as trucks and private cars, on the other hand the number of passengers rose due to the return of soldiers, Heimatvertriebene (\\"homeland expellees\\") and Hamsterfahrten (\\"hamster trips\\", that is travel by townspeople to the countryside to barter for food). It was announced on 18 November 1947 that services would be severely limited due to a coal shortage. The most significant single structure of this line was the 1623 metre-long K√∂nigsdorf Tunnel, which was demolished in 1954. A serious railway accident occurred in the resulting cutting on 27 May 1983 when an express crashed into a landslide at a speed of 130 km/h after heavy rainfall. Seven people died and 23 were injured. The cutting at K√∂nigsdorf was widened for the quadruplication of the line in 2000. After the electrification of the federal German network reached Cologne from the south in the late 1950s, the Cologne‚ÄìAachen route was also electrified. This involved the conversion of several tunnels into cuttings. Due to the different power system of the Belgian State Railways, Aachen Hauptbahnhof was upgraded to become a system change station, the first (and for 42 years the only place) where the German and Belgian rail electrification systems met directly. With the change of timetable in May 1966, electric train operations commenced on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen‚ÄìLi√®ge route, using the standard Belgium system (3000 V DC) from Aachen. (Li√®ge had been accessible for electric operations from Brussels since 1955.) At that time, Belgium already had a multi-system locomotive. In the autumn of 1966, DB also received its first multi-system locomotives, which could run under both the German and Belgian electric systems, but did not prove themselves, so that ultimately only some of the international express trains were hauled with Belgian multi-system locomotives and the others still had to change locomotive in Aachen until the 1990s. With the dual-class Intercity system of DB introduced in 1979, the line benefitted at the edges of the day: a morning IC service from Cologne to Hamburg already started in Aachen, stopping in D√ºren, and connected in Cologne to become part of the IC regular interval pattern. It was given the name Karolinger (after Charlemagne) and returned from Hamburg to Aachen in the evening and remained a constant in the timetable for over two decades. A real cyclical service pattern did not develop between Cologne and Aachen until 1984, when the Belgian State Railways introduced its new nationwide timetable concept, which included a service every two hours from Cologne via Aachen and Brussels to Oostende, which was operated with air-conditioned Eurofima coaches. The rest of the services operated, on the other hand, was only switched to regular intervals when the regional rail regular interval timetable was established in 1991. = Line upgrade= Typical S-Bahn stop in Merzenich The new Frechen-K√∂nigsdorf S-Bahn station, with the old entrance building in the background The line is to be upgraded at a total cost of ‚Ç¨952 million (as of 2013). The first and third of three sections designated under this project have been completed. The planning approval procedure for the second section, which includes passing tracks and increased speeds, was initiated at the Federal Railway Authority in August 2014. The works are divided into six phases of construction with commissioning due in the second quarter of 2020. Preparatory work began in June 2018.  Planning  The Cologne‚ÄìAachen line was already included in the Bundesverkehrswegeplan (Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan) of 1973 as one of eight planned upgraded lines (Ausbaustrecken) in the field of railways. After the development project was not included in the Koordiniertes Investitionsprogramm f√ºr die Bundesverkehrswege (coordinated investment program) of 1977, it was listed in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1980 as a project to be completed by 1990 (stage I). The line was also included in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 1985. Planning for the upgrade between Cologne and Aachen started in 1988. In November 1989, the transport ministers of the countries involved in the PBKA project agreed on a schedule according to which the line would be completed in 1995. The project was also included in the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan of 1992. In 1992, it was planned to complete work by 1997. Of the estimated cost of DM 1.1 billion, around DM 800 million was to be allocated to the section between Cologne and D√ºren, half of which would be provided by the federal government and half would be funded under the municipal transport finance law (Gemeindeverkehrsfinanzierungsgesetz). Around DM 150 million (as of 1990) would be allocated to the section west of D√ºren. The upgraded line project and the construction of a new Cologne‚ÄìHorrem‚ÄìD√ºren S-Bahn line (S 12 and S 13) on its own track were planned together. The PBKA project is a European railway project that is connecting the cities of Paris, Brussels, Cologne and Amsterdam with high-speed lines. The project is funded by the EU as part of the TEN initiative under the acronym PBKAL (Paris, Brussels, Cologne, Amsterdam, London). This line described here was to be upgraded for high-speed traffic and upgraded for around ‚Ç¨950 million. The timing of the completion of this project is open.  Reconstruction measures D 438 on the Cologne‚ÄìOostende route near Merzenich on 17 July 2002 The construction work began with a symbolic ramming on 22 October 1997. Among the guests of this event for the construction of section 1 (triangular junction near Cologne station) were Federal Minister of Transport Wissmann and state minister of transport Clement. According to the then planning two new tracks would first be built between Cologne and D√ºren for the high-speed and the existing line would be upgraded for the S-Bahn line at a cost of DM 1.1 billion. More than 80 percent of the costs would be covered by the federal government and the rest by the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Completion was expected in May 2002. By the end of 2002, the existing line between Cologne and D√ºren had gained one or two more tracks and been upgraded to a high-speed line. Since 14 December 2003, the mainline tracks on this 42 kilometre-long section can be operated at up to 250 km/h. All stations on this section of the line have been rebuilt and some of them have been converted into S-Bahn only stations. The S-Bahn started operating at the timetable change in December 2002 on the S-Bahn tracks, which are now operationally separated from the main line. The tracks on the high-speed line are used by regional and international express train services. Until the opening of the Cologne/Bonn Airport station in mid-2004, line S 13 of the Cologne S-Bahn (the southern part of the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn) operated to D√ºren, but since then line S 12 has run from Au (Sieg) via Hennef, Troisdorf and Cologne to D√ºren. K√∂ln-Weiden West station, which serves as a link to Cologne Stadtbahn line 1, was opened on 28 May 2006. In particular, it is intended to facilitate arrivals and departures at events in the RheinEnergieStadion. The single-track S-Bahn line was duplicated over a length of 1.6 km between Buir and Sindorf to allow the equalisation of S-Bahn frequencies between D√ºren and Cologne. At night, the S13 runs beyond Horrem to Aachen and back. This gives the region a better connection to Cologne/Bonn Airport. Around 2002 the line was used by around 150 passenger and 70 freight trains per day. In mid-2003, the ICE S reached a speed of 275 km/h on the newly built high-speed section as part of approval and acceptance tests. = Development since 2003 = Rhein-Sieg-Express near Nothberg The long-distance pair of tracks is designed for shared use by long-distance passenger and freight traffic from Ehrenfeld freight yard (line-kilometre 6) towards Aachen. The S-Bahn section between Cologne and Sindorf also has two tracks. Continuing towards D√ºren, single-track sections alternate with double-track crossing sections. The entrance to D√ºren station (from Merzenich station) is single- track. The long-distance tracks are designed for operations at 250 km/h and the S-Bahn tracks for 120 km/h. From Merzenich station east of D√ºren (line- kilometre 34.480), the design speed of the long-distance tracks is 220 km/h, from line-kilometre 38.0 it is 200 km/h and from line-kilometre 39.6 it is 160 km/h. The S-Bahn was designed for a 20-minute cycle (during peak hour) with the possibility of shorter cycles. 53 S-Bahn trips per day and direction were planned. Regional trains running on the long-distance tracks between Cologne and D√ºren still stop in Horrem and Cologne-Ehrenfeld. No plans were made to run the S 6 to Horrem and thus create a ten-minute cycle between Horrem and Cologne. In a second construction phase, the section between D√ºren and Langerwehe is to be upgraded for speeds of up to 200 km/h. The subsequent section via Eschweiler to Aachen is to be upgraded for 140 km/h. Currently, speeds of up to 120 km/h are possible between Eschweiler and Stolberg, although sometimes only up to 110 km/h. Top speeds of 140 or 160 km/h are already permitted on the rest of the line. It should be possible for trains to pass through D√ºren station at 200 km/h after completion of the second stage of construction. In the final state, it should be possible to run at a minimum of 200 km/h over an almost 50 km-long section between Cologne and Langerwehe. The investment framework plan for federal transport infrastructure of 2010 (Investitionsrahmenplan bis 2010 f√ºr die Verkehrsinfrastruktur des Bundes) specified total costs of ‚Ç¨951.7 million (as of 2006) for new construction and upgrading between Cologne and the German-Belgian border (including the Busch Tunnel). ‚Ç¨769.8 million of this was spent up to 2005. Federal funds totaling ‚Ç¨88.9 million were invested between 2006 and 2010. Beyond this period, there is a need for finance of ‚Ç¨93.0 million (federal funds from 2011, own funds of Deutsche Bahn and contributions from third parties from 2006). In November 2008, additional investments in the Aachen‚ÄìStolberg‚ÄìEschweiler section were approved as part of an economic stimulus package. It was planned that the Aachen-Rothe Erde‚ÄìStolberg section would be partially upgraded to three tracks from 2010. This project has not yet been implemented. Only the Aachen-Rothe Erde station has been modernised. Due to the construction delay, the European Commission cut funding for the project by ‚Ç¨2.9 million at the end of 2010. In June 2010, EVS Euregio Verkehrsschienennetz (EVS) acquired Stolberger Hauptbahnhof including the entrance building. Only the dispatcher signal box and the mainline through tracks remained the property of Deutsche Bahn. The EVS started the reconstruction of Stolberg Hauptbahnhof in 2012 and the height of the main platform was increased to 760 millimetres. The last remaining level crossing is at J√§gerspfad in Eschweiler In 2017, Deutsche Bahn began construction work on the island platform on the mainline through tracks at Stolberger Hauptbahnhof. The existing underpass is to be replaced by an overpass with lifts. The work was expected to take until the middle of 2019. Construction work on the Upgraded line 4, II. upgrade phase, 1. construction stage project at Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof began in 2018. Platforms at the Hauptbahnhof have been raised to 76 cm and barrier-free access has been created to the island platform via lifts and the two passing tracks (platform 1 and 4) have been extended to a useful length of 750 m. The relay interlocking has been replaced by connecting the station to a computer-based interlocking and the last level crossing between Cologne and Aachen at J√§gerspfad in Eschweiler is to be closed. Work in Aachen should also begin in 2019. In the district of Eilendorf, the third track is to be extended by about 1,700 metres between Eilendorf and the former Aachen-Rothe Erde freight yard. Measures for noise and vibration protection are also planned. The line between Stolberg Hauptbahnhof and Aachen Hauptbahnhof was declared an overloaded railway on 11 November 2019.  Route description = Cologne Hauptbahnhof= Entrance building of Cologne Hauptbahnhof Train shed The original starting point of the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway was a terminal station of the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn). When the Cathedral Bridge made it possible for trains to cross the Rhine in 1859, the line ran to the Centralbahnhof (central station). This was a combined terminus and through station. The trains of the Rhenish Railway Company from Aachen ended at four terminal tracks. Two thoroughfares mainly served trains of the Cologne-Minden Railway Company (C√∂ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft). Today's Cologne Hauptbahnhof (main station) was built from 1892 to 1894 because the capacity of the station was no longer able to cope with the increased traffic. The station was badly damaged during the Second World War and the station building had to be demolished and replaced by a new building. Around 1990, two tracks were added on the north side for S-Bahn traffic, which are independent of the rest of the infrastructure. Today's station is one of the busiest stations in Germany because all trains that use the Cologne‚ÄìAachen high-speed line stop here. = K√∂ln Hansaring station= The halt (Haltepunkt, technically a station without points) of K√∂ln Hansaring, which is named after the ring road it lies above, was opened at line-km 0.8 (on this line, distance from Cologne Hauptbahnhof) at the same time as the construction of two additional S-Bahn tracks at Cologne Hauptbahnhof and on the Hohenzollern Bridge in 1990. It is connected to the Cologne Stadtbahn station of the same name, which was opened in 1974, and has an island platform and is served by all S-Bahn trains that pass through the Hauptbahnhof, as well as Regionalbahn line RB 25 (Oberbergische Bahn), which is to be converted to an S-Bahn line. Immediately behind the stop is the Cologne ICE workshop (Bahnbetriebswerk K√∂ln), which is bypassed to the north by mainline trains running towards Aachen and the S-Bahn line and to the south by mainline trains running towards Cologne Hauptbahnhof. The S-Bahn line, which runs north of the tracks for other traffic near Cologne Hauptbahnhof, crosses to the south over a flyover between K√∂ln Hansaring and K√∂ln-Ehrenfeld and it remains to the south to its end in D√ºren. = K√∂ln- Ehrenfeld station = K√∂ln-Ehrenfeld station, view from platform 3 K√∂ln- Ehrenfeld station was built at line-km 3.7 between Cologne and M√ºngersdorf with the construction of the first section in 1839. K√∂ln-Ehrenfeld station has two platforms with four platform tracks, to the north of which there are two tracks without a platform for through passenger and freight trains. Tracks 1 and 2 are used for S-Bahn traffic, tracks 3 and 4 for regional traffic. Cologne-Ehrenfeld is a scheduled stop for all regional services passing through it. Not far from the station is the Venloer Stra√üe/G√ºrtel underground station of the Cologne Stadtbahn. The Cologne-Aachen high-speed railway crosses Ehrenfeldg√ºrtel (Ehrenfeld belt), part of the Cologne ring road, at K√∂ln-Ehrenfeld Cologne station. In and around K√∂ln-Ehrenfeld station, the railway runs on a viaduct. Some arches of this viaduct were formerly used as storage space, others were neglected. There were also problems with moisture penetration. The arches were to be refurbished in 2015, with self-supporting inner shells. Subsequently, a private investor was to create a shopping mile with restaurants. There is currently a discotheque in three of the arches. = K√∂ln-M√ºngersdorf Technologiepark station = The halt of K√∂ln-M√ºngersdorf Technologiepark is located in the east of Cologne's M√ºngersdorf district at line-km 5.9. It was established with the construction of the S-Bahn to D√ºren in 2002. The station has a partially covered island platform, which is connected by two sets of stairs and a lift to the street below, on which there is a K√∂lner Verkehrsbetriebe (Cologne Transport) bus stop. = Belvedere station= Station building of the former Belvedere station The first section of the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line, which was opened on 2 August 1839, ran to M√ºngersdorf, with the terminus of the line at Belvedere station (line-km 7.0) until the opening of L√∂venich station. For excursion guests from downtown Cologne, a small station building that housed a restaurant was built on a hill north of the cutting through which the line ran. With the extension of the line to Aachen, M√ºngersdorf station, the ‚ÄúBelvedere house‚Äù, became less and less important. The station was never very important for operations and was closed before 1892. Today there are no operating facilities at the station. The station building, which has meanwhile been used as a residential building, still exists and is listed as the \\"oldest station in Germany in its original form\\" in the Cologne heritage list. = L√∂venich station = K√∂ln-L√∂venich station was opened on 2 July 1840 with the second phase of construction of the line at line-km 9.0 and was the western terminus of the line for about a year. In 2002, an S-Bahn stop was built west of the station at 9.7 km. At the same time, the former Cologne-L√∂venich station was dismantled and is now used only for passing loops. The S-Bahn stop has an island platform between the S-Bahn tracks. = K√∂ln-Weiden West station = Stadtbahn stop The halt of K√∂ln- Weiden West was built in 2006 in the run-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup at line-km 11.1. At the same time, line 1 of the Cologne Stadtbahn was extended by about a kilometre to the west and a new terminus was built with four tracks. The Cologne‚ÄìAachen line in Weiden West is located on an embankment. The Stadtbahn station is on ground level just south of the line, enabling direct interchange. = Frechen-K√∂nigsdorf station= The old station building in Frechen-K√∂nigsdorf With the extension of the line to Aachen in 1841, Gro√ük√∂nigsdorf station was established at line-km 13.8 km. In 2000 the station was renamed Frechen-K√∂nigsdorf and in 2002 it was converted into an S-Bahn stop as part of the line upgrade. The station has an island platform and is connected to a pedestrian bridge running over the tracks. The station building north of the railway line still exists, but no longer has a platform and is currently used as a taxi control centre. = K√∂nigsdorf Tunnel = K√∂nigsdorf Tunnel was a 1623-metre-long tunnel between Gro√ük√∂nigsdorf and Horrem at line- km 15.0. Construction began in 1837 and was completed in 1841. Up to 2,000 workers were employed in its construction. When it opened, the tunnel was the longest railway tunnel in Europe. The maximum coverage of the tunnel was 35 metres. Chimneys were built at this height to remove the smoke caused by steam locomotives. The masonry was continuously damaged by seepage and exhaust gases from the steam locomotives, so that the tunnel was in great need of restoration at the beginning of the 1930s. The tunnel was not exactly straight when built, so over time work was carried out to straighten it, which further reduced its stability. Refurbishment began in 1937, but was never completed due to the Second World War. After parts of the tunnel wall flaked off in early 1954 and protruded into the clearance profile, a third track was laid in the middle of the tunnel to make room for supporting scaffolding. In March 1954 the speed limit in the tunnel was 10 km/h. Because the electrification of the railway line was planned anyway, requiring an expansion of the structure gauge of the tunnel for the overhead wire, it was considered necessary to dismantle the tunnel and convert it into a cutting. By December 1955, 4 million cubic metres of soil had been excavated using bucket chain excavators and transported via a conveyor belt to a pit at a nearby briquette factory. At the same time, the Horrem Bridge was built for the North-South Railway from Rheinbraun (now part of RWE Power). The cutting was widened with the help of sheet piling and the line was raised to allow for the laying of two additional tracks for the S-Bahn in 2002. Today there is nothing left of the former tunnel. Parts of the east portal are commemorated. = Horrem station= Newly built Horrem station building Horrem station was opened in 1841 at line-km 18.7. It was converted into an S-Bahn station in 2002. The Erft Railway branches off from the Cologne-Aachen high-speed line at the station. It has two island platform tracks for operations on the Erft Railway and four platform tracks and three through tracks for operations on the high-speed line. Until 2001, Horrem station had a freight yard to its north. There are commuter parking spaces in this area. The forecourt and entrance building were fundamentally rebuilt from 2010 to 2014. A \\"green station\\" was built, with CO2-neutral operations. This involved the installation of photovoltaic and geothermal systems and the use of ecological building materials. There are now a waiting room, a kiosk and a bookshop in the entrance building. There is a tectonic fault in the area of Horrem station. The long-distance tracks pass over this on a special structure that is underground and can hydraulically compensate for earth movements. The other tracks have special rail joints at this point. = Sindorf station = Sindorf station Sindorf station was opened at line-km 22.4 between Dorsfeld and Horrem in 1912. The station had a platform north and south of the old line. The former Dorsfeld station was abandoned at the same time. Dorsfeld was a junction for sidings to the nearby gravel pits. Dorsfeld station became the location of overtaking loops for freight traffic with the opening of the parallel S-Bahn line in 2002. The Blatzheim block post was located at line-km 25.8 from 1952 to 1966. With the commissioning of the S-Bahn line, Sindorf station was also relocated to line- km 21.4 and redesignated as a halt. The station is in the south-east of the Kerpen district of Sindorf and has a side platform on the south side of the S-Bahn line. This is bounded to the south by a noise barrier and the entrances and exits are at the ends of the platform. = Buir station = Buir station had two platform tracks at an island platform and a passing track from its construction at line-km 30.3 in 1841 to the reconstruction of the line in 2002. Since the upgrade of the line, the tracks used by timetable route 480 and two S-Bahn lines have run through the station. A malt factory located next to the station formerly had a siding. While all of the S-Bahn only stations on the upgraded line have an island platform except for Sindorf station (single side platform), Buir station has two side platforms north and south of the S-Bahn tracks. The northern side platform is separated from the mainline tracks by a noise barrier. Access to the northern platform is via an underpass. In the Buir area, the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line runs for about eight km next to the Hambach lignite mine railway and autobahn 4. = Merzenich station = There was a station in the Merzenich area from 1841 to 1880 at line-km 35.0 at the site of the former junction of the D√ºren‚ÄìNeuss railway. This was never served by trains on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line. The new Merzenich station opened on 29 April 2003 and put into operation for the S-Bahn. It has an island platform and a large commuter parking area. It is served by lines S 13 and S 19 and can be reached using tickets issued by both the Aachener Verkehrsverbund (Aachen Transport Association) and the Verkehrsverbund Rhein- Sieg (Rhine-Sieg Transport Association). Overtaking loops were also built at line-km 36.7 as part of the upgrade of the line. = D√ºren station = D√ºren station building D√ºren station was opened in 1841 at line-km 39.2 and soon developed into a hub for rail transport. By 1900, the D√ºren‚ÄìHeimbach, J√ºlich‚ÄìD√ºren, D√ºren‚ÄìNeuss and D√ºren‚ÄìEuskirchen lines had been established with D√ºren as the starting point. From 1933 to 1986 there was a motive power depot (Bahnbetriebswerk) in D√ºren. The entrance building was opened in 1874 and, unlike the city centre of D√ºren, was not destroyed in the air raid of 16 November 1944. It is located as an island station (Inselbahnhof) between the tracks for traffic to J√ºlich to the north and the tracks of the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line to the south. Regional express trains towards Aachen stop at the home platform (platform 1). The platforms for regional express trains and S-Bahn trains running towards Cologne and trains of the Euregiobahn towards Aachen can be reached via an underpass. Some long-distance trains also stop in D√ºren. Although there are other stations in the area of the city of D√ºren, D√ºren station does not bear the designation of Hauptbahnhof (main station), unlike most main stations in German towns with several stations. = Triangular Truss bridge = The Cologne‚ÄìAachen line crosses the Rur river over the Triangular Truss bridge (Dreigurtbr√ºcke) at line-km 39.8. The bridge has a span of 78 metres and was built from 1928 to 1929 as a replacement for a brick bridge built with the original railway. The structure, which is now a listed building, is currently in a dilapidated condition. The economics of its renovation are doubtful. = Hubertushof and G√ºrzenich = The Hubertushof connection point as required (Bedarfsanschlussstelle) is located at line-km 41.3. This junction served the Bundeswehr (federal defence forces) for its premises in the H√ºrtgenwald (G√ºrzenicher Bruch). The G√ºrzenich block post was also located there from 1925 to 1952. About a kilometre south of the village, but still part of G√ºrzenich, there is a Bundeswehr depot where weapons and material were stored mainly for the Air Force airbase in N√∂rvenich, about 15 km away. The 150-hectare depot was closed in 2009. Guerzenich also had a freight yard. The branch line to the freight yard branched off from the tram line to Guerzenich on today's Papierm√ºhle (formerly M√ºhlenweg). There was a connecting track to the Distelrath‚ÄìSchneidhausen railway (Ringbahn) at Breuer's H√§uschen. The G√ºrzenich freight yard had a loading and transfer track and there was a connection to the D√ºren‚ÄìAachen railway. All freight traffic towards R√∂lsdorf and Lendersdorf was handled on this track from 1944 until the Rur Bridge of the Ringbahn was restored. = Derichsweiler and Merode = Until November 2002, the Derichsweiler overtaking loops were located at line- km 44.3. It was a halt for passenger traffic from 1843 to 1928. When this section of the line was converted to computer-based interlocking technology, the Derichsweiler overtaking loops were abandoned and the points and the catenary on the passing tracks were dismantled. The western part of the former yard is now controlled from the Langerwehe electronic signalling control centre, while the eastern part is controlled from D√ºren. The former signal box building has been preserved, but is no longer used. The Merode block post was established at line-km 46.5 in 1965/1966. = Langerwehe station = Langerwehe entrance building Langerwehe station (line-km 48.9) has two platform tracks on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line with side platforms north and south of the two through line tracks. The Eschweiler-Weisweiler Langerwehe line, built in 2009, ends in Langerwehe. Euregiobahn trains from Eschweiler- Weisweiler arrive at a third platform built in 2009. The through platform tracks on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway are used by Regional-Express services and Euregiobahn trains that are bound for D√ºren. The two-storey station building dates from the time the line was built (1841) and was enlarged by two one- storey extensions at the beginning of the 20th century. As the platforms were moved a few metres to the west during the reconstruction of the line around 2000, the entrance building now has no direct access to the platform. = Nothberg station = Nothberg station two years before its closure The halt of Nothberg was built in 1905 at the southern end of the Eschweiler district of Nothberg at line-km 54.1. It had two side platforms and a small building with a ticket office until the 1970s. A road underpass west of the halt had to be used to connect the platforms. Recently, Nothberg station was only served by the Rhein-Sieg-Express every hour. When the new Eschweiler-Weisweiler Langerwehe line went into operation in 2009, Nothberg station on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway was closed due to the low number of passengers and replaced by the Eschweiler-Nothberg Euregiobahn station. The platforms and a small parking lot at the western end still exist. Signs forbid entry to the closed station. A siding branched off to the Reserve colliery between Nothberg station and Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof from 1864. The coal mined there was loaded onto trains at a yard at the mine site. After the coal mining ended, the colliery buildings including the siding were demolished. However, its course can still be seen in modern satellite images. The H√ºcheln block post was built at line-km 52.0 in 1965/1966. = Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof = Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof entrance building Since 1841, Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof has been located at line-km 56.9 in the R√∂thgen district of Eschweiler and has four tracks, three of which are platform tracks with the house platform (next to the entrance building) as a side platform and an island platform. The station is served by the NRW-Express and the Rhein-Sieg-Express. The Euregiobahn service stops instead at the Eschweiler Talbahnhof (valley station) on the M√∂nchengladbach‚ÄìStolberg railway. The entrance building was built in 1860 and is now owned by the city of Eschweiler. A kiosk, a travel agency and a dental practice are located in the entrance building. In the past, the station was served by a line of the Aachen Tramway and handled freight. The tram line was discontinued in 1954 and general freight operations ended in 1984. The goods shed was replaced by a parking lot in 2008. The station is currently being renovated because it is not barrier-free due to its 38 centimetre-high platforms and lack of lifts. = Ichenberg Tunnel = The Ichenberg tunnel is located at line-km 57.0 immediately west of Eschweiler Hauptbahnhof and is now 95 metres long. During the Second World War, it was blown up by retreating Wehrmacht troops and rebuilt by American pioneers. Since the cross-section of the tunnel was too narrow for the upcoming electrification, the tunnel was opened out for a length of 255 metres in 1962 and the modern shorter tunnel was rebuilt in concrete. = Three Arch bridge= The railway line crosses the Inde river and the M√∂nchengladbach‚ÄìStolberg railway over the Three Arch bridge (Dreibogenbr√ºcke) (line-km 57.9). The bridge is built of brick and has existed since the opening of the railway in 1841. In the Second World War, an arch was blown up and initially replaced by American pioneers with a temporary steel structure and then restored to its original design in 1950. = Stolberg Hauptbahnhof = Renovated entrance building of the Stolberg Hauptbahnhof Due to the changes in the route as a result of the railway dispute, Stolberg Hauptbahnhof was built in 1841, not in the centre of the city of Stolberg, but three kilometres north of Stolberg in what was then part of Eschweiler. Due to the location outside the centre of the town at line-km 60.3, there were large open areas that made it possible to develop Stolberg Hauptbahnhof into a railway junction. The M√∂nchengladbach‚ÄìStolberg, Stolberg‚ÄìWalheim, Stolberg‚ÄìHerzogenrath lines and the now closed Stolberg‚ÄìM√ºnsterbusch and Stolberg‚ÄìKohlscheid lines were built by 1900, all starting from Stolberg Hauptbahnhof. The entrance building was completed in 1888. Due to its location at the divergence of the Cologne‚ÄìAachen and the Stolberg‚ÄìWalheim lines, Stolberg Hbf is a wedge-shaped station (Keilbahnhof). Freight tracks were built to the west, south and east of the station, which in the meantime were connected to each other by a connecting railway that used a bridge structure. A locomotive depot with a roundhouse was built south of the station. Of these facilities, only the freight tracks east of the station are still used today. Stolberger Hauptbahnhof has three platform tracks on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line. The central platform is used for traffic with Regional-Express and Euregiobahn services to Aachen and the house platform for Euregiobahn services from Aachen. The station building was acquired in 2010 by EVS Euregio Verkehrsschienennetz, which renovated it for ‚Ç¨3 million and converted it into a control centre. There is now a signal box for the lines maintained by EVS and used by the Euregiobahn. = Eilendorf Tunnel and Nirm Tunnel = Bombardier Talent of Euregiobahn leaves Eilendorf Tunnel A 727-metre-long tunnel called the Nirmer Tunnel (Nirm Tunnel) was built between Stolberg and the location of modern Eilendorf at line-km 63.6 during the construction of the line and completed in 1841. Both miners from Eschweiler and workers from the Leipzig‚ÄìDresden railway were employed in the construction of the tunnel, using a method known as core construction (Kernbauweise‚Äîusing three narrow tunnels to build the walls of the final tunnel before the tunnel core was removed). There were eight chimneys above the tunnel for the extraction of smoke produced by the steam locomotives. During the Second World War a bunker was built over the west portal. In 1963, it became clear that the cross- section of the tunnel, like the K√∂nigsdorf Tunnel and the Ichenberg Tunnel, was too narrow to allow the catenary to be installed. Therefore, the Nirm tunnel was partially opened out and converted into two smaller tunnels lined with concrete. The western tunnel is the Eilendorf Tunnel with a length of 357 metres (line-km 63.9) and the eastern tunnel is the Nirm Tunnel with a length of 125 metres. Although the two newly constructed tunnels were designed for speeds of up to 200 km/h and high-speed tests had been carried out with class E 03 locomotives, the permissible top speed today is 130 km/h. From 1944 to 1986, the Nirm block post was located at line-km 63.2. = Eilendorf station= Eilendorf station photographed from the road bridge. Eilendorf Tunnel is in the background The halt of Eilendorf was opened at line-km 64.9 as Nirm halt along with the line on 1 September 1841. It later closed but reopened in 1897. In 1920, an entrance building was built, which was demolished in the 1980s. By 1963, Nirm had an island platform and a passing track. During the electrification of the line, the halt was renamed Eilendorf, the passing track was dismantled and two side platforms, which still exist, were built. In 2018, the platforms had a height of 38 cm and were therefore below the boarding height of the rail vehicles operated, which prevented barrier-free entry. In 2018, the platforms were raised to 76 cm to enable level, barrier-free entry into the trains. The platforms, which were previously over 200 metres long, were shortened to 125 m. There is no connection between the two platforms with a bridge or a tunnel; instead a road bridge to the west or an underpass to the east must be used, both of which require several hundred metres of walking. Therefore, passengers often cross the tracks without authorisation. = Aachen-Rothe Erde station= Platform in Aachen-Rothe Erde Aachen-Rothe Erde station was built in 1875 as an interchange station for the Haaren‚ÄìAachen-Rothe Erde railway at line-km 68.2. From 1880 it was also used in passenger transport. The Vennbahn, which branched off the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway in Rothe Erde was opened in 1885. The station received a locomotive depot and the freight yard was expanded. The current station building has existed since 1892 and is built into the railway embankment. After the Second World War, the connection with the Vennbahn and parts of the freight yard were closed. Today there is a shopping centre in the area. The passenger station has a platform with one-way tracks running towards Aachen and Cologne. To the east of this is a carriage yard for Euregiobahn railcars and for regional express sets. A branch line ran to the Aachen freight yard (Moltkebahnhof) from Rothe Erde station. = Aachen freight yard = Aachen freight yard, also known as the Moltkebahnhof (Moltke station) due to its location on Moltkestrasse (Moltke street), was a freight yard in the south of the city of Aachen, which was connected via a branch line to the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway. The freight yard was opened in 1895, but freight traffic decreased from the mid-1960s, so that the freight yard was closed in the mid-1990s. Today there are, among other things, a park and a comprehensive school on the site. = Burtscheid Viaduct = Burtscheid Viaduct was built from 1838 to 1840 according to plans by engineers Wittfeld and Pickel. The originally 277 metre-long viaduct was partially blown up during the Second World War and rebuilt. It now has a length of 251 m. A reinforced concrete pavement slab was added in the 1960s, and it was renovated from 2007 to 2009. Burtscheid Viaduct has two tracks. Aachen Hauptbahnhof is directly to its west. = Aachen Hauptbahnhof = Aachen Hbf, view from the station forecourt The Rhenish Railway Company opened the Rheinischen Bahnhof (Rhenish station) as the terminus of the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway (line-km 70.2) in 1841. The current entrance building and the station concourse date from 1905 when the station was rebuilt as part of its merger with Aachen Marschierthor station, the terminus of the Aachen‚ÄìM√∂nchengladbach railway. In the run-up to the electrification of the station, the tracks within the station hall were rearranged in 1966. Since then, Aachen Hauptbahnhof has had nine platform tracks, four of which are designed to enable the transition between electrical systems: the overhead lines can be switched to use either the 15 kV/16.7 Hz AC used in Germany or the 3 kV DC used in Belgium. A 3-S-Zentrale (a DB Station&Service; station control centres) has been located in the entrance building since 2003. All local and long-distance trains stop at Aachen Hauptbahnhof. With the exception of ICE International, Thalys and Euregiobahn services, all trains start and end here. The rolling stock of the NRW-Express, the Rhein-Sieg-Express and Euregiobahn are maintained in a DB Regio NRW depot to the west of the station.  Rolling stock and operations  The Rhenish Railway Company started operations on the section to M√ºngersdorf with four steam locomotives, three of which were manufactured in England. The Carolus Magnus was built by the newly founded Dobbs & Poensgen locomotive factory in Aachen, but it was prone to failure and had to be rebuilt. It was only used to haul work trains and was sold early. The 10 locomotives were estimated to have operated a total at 5361 Prussian miles () in 1841. After the opening of the whole line, the number of locomotives used grew to a total of 21. The original timetable provided three passenger trains (morning, noon and evening) between Cologne and Aachen per day and direction. Due to the line being single-track initially, trains were scheduled to cross in D√ºren. The two morning trains started or ended in Herbesthal. Passenger trains initially served all stops on the way until a pair of express trains was introduced between Cologne and Herbesthal in 1857. The first night train ran on the railway in May 1859. The first trains from Cologne to Paris were initially unlit, but lamps were eventually attached to the locomotives after an accident at a level crossing. = Prussian state railways = Under the nationalisation policy of Otto von Bismarck, the Cologne‚ÄìAachen railway became part of the Prussian state railways (Preu√üische Staatseisenbahnen). This greatly expanded the connections operated on the line. In 1913, there were also direct through coaches from Aachen via the line to Cologne, Berlin, Bremen, Frankfurt, Hamburg, Hanover, Kiel, Munich and Wiesbaden. The Ostend‚ÄìVienna Express started as a luxury train in 1894 and later operated as an international express. It included coaches that were attached/detached to the Orient-Express and was one of the most important connections between Western Europe and the Balkans. The service only ended in 1993. = Deutsche Bundesbahn = After the Second World War, Deutsche Bundesbahn took over the line that had been operated by Deutsche Reichsbahn from 1920 to 1945. In the first few years, steam locomotives from the Reichsbahn era were predominantly used: class 01 and class 03 locomotives in front of express trains and class 38.10 locomotives in front of other passenger trains. Class 50 and class 55.25 locomotives hauled most freight trains. Individual trains were operated with VT 36.5 diesel railcars. In addition, the line was used by international express trains such as the Ostend‚ÄìVienna Express, which took only 1:03 hours from Cologne to Aachen. In the 1960s and 1970s, several Trans Europ Express train pairs ran on the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line. Diesel railcars of class VT 11.5 (e.g. Hamburg‚ÄìParis) and trains with French TEE coaches were used. The VT 08 class was used for long- distance express (F) trains. In addition, international expresses hauled by Belgian steam locomotives ran to Cologne. Electrification was completed in 1966, and from then on electric locomotives were mostly used for passenger transport. Mainly class 110 and Belgian multi-system locomotives of class 16 and later also class 18 ran in long-distance transport and initially class 141 were operated in local transport. The new class 184 multi-system locomotives delivered in the autumn of 1966 (also marketed as Europalokomotiven‚Äî\\"European locomotives\\") were extensively tested in Germany‚ÄìBelgium traffic, but were only rarely used later because the locomotives often failed due to frequent strong voltage fluctuations in the Belgian overhead line, so from 1971 they were no longer used for passenger services to Belgium and were relocated to the Saarland in 1979. The international daytime passenger services were therefore largely operated from the 1970s to the 1990s with Belgian multi- system locomotives. Locomotives for freight transport were changed in Aachen- West and locomotives for overnight express trains were changed in Aachen Hbf. = Current operations =  Passenger services  NRW-Express service in Stolberg Hbf ICE International service near Nothberg In long-distance traffic, the Cologne‚ÄìAachen high-speed line is operated with ICE International services using class 406 sets and Thalys services using PBKA sets. This offer is supplemented by individual Intercity and Intercity Express services that run once a week and thus create direct connections to/from other regions in Germany at the weekend. The Regional-Express services RE 1 (NRW-Express) and RE 9 (Rhein-Sieg-Express) serve the entire length of the line hourly and together provide an approximately 30-minute cycle. The NRW-Express is operated with push‚Äìpull trains composed of double-deck carriages from Bombardier and class 146.0 locomotives. The Rhein-Sieg-Express is operated with locomotives of class 146.0 or class 111 as well as Talent 2 railcars in coupled sets. Class 120.2 locomotives were also used until 2018. Between Cologne Hauptbahnhof and K√∂ln-Ehrenfeld, the RE 8 regional express (Rhein-Erft- Express) service is operated with class 425 multiple units and the Regionalbahn RB 27 service (Rhein-Erft-Bahn) with push-pull trains consisting of three double-decker coaches and a locomotive of class 143. Between Cologne and Horrem, the Regionalbahn RB 38 service (Erft-Bahn) is operated with class 644 railcars and S-Bahn services S 13 and S 19 with class 423 multiple units. The S 12 service also runs between Cologne and D√ºren with class 423 sets. Euregiobahn services on the section between Aachen Hauptbahnhof and Stolberg Hauptbahnhof are operated with Bombardier Talent DMUs every 30 minutes in coupled sets on weekdays and in single sets on Sundays. The Euregiobahn services leave the Cologne‚ÄìAachen line between Stolberg and Langerwehe and return to Langerwehe and D√ºren, running hourly.  Freight transport The Cologne‚ÄìAachen high-speed line is used by numerous freight trains due to its location between the K√∂ln-Eifeltor freight yard on the West Rhine railway and Aachen West, the eastern end of the Aachen‚ÄìTongeren railway. Much of the freight traffic is carried by DB Cargo and Cobra (Corridor Operations Belgium Rail), a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn, and SNCB. Other regular services are a SBB Cargo Combined transport train hauled by TRAXX locomotives and freight trains operated by Crossrail (now part of Cargologic) and RTB Cargo, which uses diesel-hauled goods exchange trains (√úbergabeg√ºterzuge) from D√ºren to Stolberg and back. The line is also used by freight trains to and from M√∂nchengladbach on the section between the Cologne-Ehrenfeld and K√∂ln- M√ºngersdorf Technologiepark stations.

Built in 1751 and restyled in the 1830s, it is the oldest ecclesiastical building in the State of Connecticut that has been continuously used for religious purposes. In 1977 it was included on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The Abington Congregational Church is located in the rural village of Abington, on the east side of Route 97, south of its junction with United States Route 44. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. The main facade is three bays wide, the bays articulated by Doric pilasters, and topped by a pedimented gable that is flushboarded, with a round window at the center. A three-stage square tower rises above the entrance. History The church was built in 1751 for a congregation established in 1749 after the main Pomfret congregation grew too large. It is one of the few surviving examples of the peg and beam construction typical of 18th century New England. The building was significantly enlarged and altered in the 1830s, giving it its present Greek Revival styling; this work was one by Edwin Fitch of Mansfield. A parsonage for the church was built in 1851, and an adjacent parish hall was built in 1951. Today the church is the spiritual home to a small congregation, and is a member of the United Church of Christ. Its website includes records of interest to genealogists and historians. The Old Cemetery of the Abington Church was used from 1760 to 1900, and includes gravestones of 82 American Revolutionary War soldiers. The New Cemetery includes many Civil War gravemarkers, and is still in use today. Lists from both cemeteries are included on the church's website, as well as a record of all Civil War veterans and units from Pomfret, Connecticut. The current pastor is the Reverend Bruce A. Hedman, Ph.D., who graduated from Princeton Theological Seminary and was ordained to the Presbyterian ministry in 1980. He served churches in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and in Union, Connecticut and Hampton, Connecticut, before coming to Abington in 1988.

It takes the view that homosexual activity is sinful, but being homosexual is not sinful in and of itself and, therefore, advocates celibacy for those of its gay and lesbian members who do not consider marriage to someone of the opposite sex to be a viable option. While this view is usually strongly rejected by LGBT organizations and individuals, there are some LGBT-identified Christians who emphatically support and practice it.  History  True freedom Trust was founded in 1977 by Anglican clergyman Canon L. Roy Barker and Martin Hallett, a man who had been \\"involved in a homosexual lifestyle\\" for nine years. Canon Barker died in 2004, and the organisation was led by Martin Hallett until his retirement in 2009. TFT was a founding member of Exodus International, the international arm of the world's largest ex-gay organization, but resigned its membership in 2000 because of Exodus's rhetoric, which they believed tended to \\"set people up for disillusionment\\" by promising change of orientation.Director Martin Hallett, quoted in David L Rattigan, \\"Out and Cowed?\\" in Third Way (UK), May 2006 In 2001, when UK ex-gay ministry Courage UK announced it was now gay-affirming, TFT Director Martin Hallett told supporters that TFT would not be following suit, and that it retained the belief that homosexual \\"genital activity\\" was always wrong. In 2004, the Holy Trinity Church in Barnet pledged to give ¬£5,500 a year to the True Freedom Trust to encourage sexual transformation. In October 2009, Jonathan Berry was appointed as the new Director. Berry says that he was converted out of homosexuality at the age of 24.https://truefreedomtrust.co.uk/beliefs In January 2018, Stuart Parker was appointed as the new Director.  Description  True Freedom Trust is based in Wirral, UK. In 2018, True Freedom Trust had 1800 members and 14 local support groups for men and women and their families in the UK and Ireland. TFT generally works on a referral basis, where Christians who are \\"struggling\\" with their sexuality are put in touch with the main office, assessed, and advised what to do next. Often this involves one- to-one support, referral to a Christian counsellor, or referral to a local \\"Barnabas\\" group for ongoing support. The Barnabas groups are informal meetings designed for Christians (in theory, both gay and straight) to offer one another support and encouragement.\\"What TFT offers\\", TFT Website There are several nationwide. TFT does not offer counselling itself, but has a list of qualified counsellors for referral who agree to respect a client's orthodox biblical beliefs. TFT has made it clear that it does not advocate conversion therapy, but rather Christian discipleship, as the hope for same-sex attracted Christians.\\"Can sexual orientation be changed?\\", TFT Website TFT does not generally encourage gay Christians to expect to be healed of their orientation, although it says that change is possible. Therefore, although because of its historical affiliations and its stance against homosexual behavior, it is often considered to be a part of the ex-gay movement, but this is actually not the case.

Produced since 1900, the Cr√©mant d'Alsace AOC was recognized in 1976 by the INAO and the designation Cr√©mant regulated by the European Parliament in 1996.INAO: AOC Cr√©mant d'Alsace appellation regulations, updated until February 20, 2002 , retrieved 2011-04-20. Cr√©mant d'Alsace is usually made of some blend among pinot blanc, pinot gris, pinot noir, riesling, auxerrois and chardonnay. Cr√©mant d'Alsace ros√©, while rare, is made of pinot noir. The method of production is identical with that of champagne. In comparison to champagne, cr√©mant d'Alsace is usually at a lower price levels; cr√©mant d'Alsace cannot age in cellar as long as champagne (5 years maximum). In 2009, 31 million bottles were produced.  History  The Alsatian vineyard is one of the oldest ones of France. Gregory of Tours praised Marlenheim's vineyard in 589. There were 108 wine-producing villages in 800, 160 in 900 and 430 in 1400. By this time, Alsatian wine, red or white, was one of the most famous wines of Europe and one of the most expensive. Many wars, unfavorable economical circumstances and keeping of obsolete laws led through the following centuries Alsatian wine next to the depths. This situation recovered after World War I. Just before 1900, while Alsace was part of the German Empire, some Champagne winemakers like Hommel in Ribeauvill√©, Dirler in Bergholtz, Cosse in Pfastatt or Vix Barra in Schiltigheim settled into Alsace to make sparkling wine and got around customs rights upon export towards Germany. Julien Dopff au MoulinJulien Dopff au Moulin from Riquewihr has been the first Alsatian winemaker to adapt the m√©thode champenoise after attending a demonstration during the Exposition Universelle in Paris. He started to sell the Champagne Dopff after a two years training period in √âpernay by proceeding to a second fermentation in bottles. After World War I and Alsace's return into France, the transposition of the French 1905-law about designation of origin forbade the use of the word Champagne. The distinction between both products came by Pierre Hussherr, an earlier manager of Wolfberger, who retrieved the term Cr√©mant, then obsolete in Champagne. On 4 July 1975, a law allowed the word \\"Cr√©mant\\" only for sparkling wines under AOC-rules. After that, Cr√©mant de Loire and Cr√©mant de Bourgogne were defined by decrees. On 24 August 1976, the AOC Cr√©mant d'Alsace was defined by a decree too. On 21 June 1996, the European Parliament consolidated the denomination Cr√©mant, then used in France and Luxembourg, making clear that it must be a quality sparkling wine following strict production rules and having been named Cr√©mant before July 1986.  Geography  Cr√©mant d'Alsace is produced in north-eastern France, in the region Alsace, nearly in the whole Alsatian vineyard but mainly in Barr, Bennwihr, Eguisheim. Ingersheim, Riquewihr, Wintzenheim and Andolsheim. = Geology and orography = Alsace plain occupies the south part of the Upper Rhine Plain, which formed from a collapse during the Oligocene and is followed since the Miocene by the river Rhine. The vineyard stays on the lower slopes of the Vosges Mountains, on the fault zone of the graben, covered by alluvial fans of the many rivers and creeks flowing from the nearby heights. This explains the variety of the subsurface materials and their succession forming a true mosaic: limestones, granites, shales, gneiss or sandstones. Mainly, the upper part of the slopes of the subvosgian hills consists of old rocks: plutons and metamorphic rocks like granite, gneiss or slate. Vine-planted parcels are rather steep and climb up to 478 m height (near Osenbach). The lower part of the slopes consists of layers of limestones or marls covered by loess where the slope is rather smooth. Finally, the plain consists of a thick layer of alluvium deposited by the Rhine (silt and gravels). This zone is very more fertile than the two previous with an important aquifer mainly close to the surface (less than 5 m deep): the Upper Rhine aquifer. Means of temperature and precipitation near Strasbourg (1949-2001) = Climatology = On the western side, the Vosges Mountains shield the Alsatian vineyards from wind and rain. Dominating western winds lose their moisture on the eastern side of the Vosges and arrive as foehn winds into the Alsace plain. The precipitation mean in Alsace is the lowest of all French vineyards and Colmar one of the dryest towns of France. Consequently, the climate is more temperate than expected at this latitude: the annual mean temperature is about 1.5 ¬∞C higher. The climate is semi-continental and dry with hot springs, sunny and dry summers, long autumns and cold winters.  Wine making  Cr√©mant d'Alsace ros√© The grapes for Cr√©mant d'Alsace are harvested many days before grapes for the other Alsace AOCs. As with Champagne, grapes must be manually harvested. Grapes come from varieties grown within the AOC Alsace area. The allowed varieties are limited to riesling, pinot blanc, pinot noir, pinot gris, auxerrois blanc and chardonnay. For ros√© wines, only pinot noir is allowed. The AOC Cr√©mant d'Alsace is elaborated according to the methods used for Champagne elaboration. In 2004, the grape harvest for Cr√©mant d'Alsace elaboration represented 214,946 hectolitres, showing a rise of 35.6% compared with the mean of the five latest years.Source: Conseil Interprofessionnel des Vins d'Alsace (CIVA). In 2005, it represented 273,733 hectolitres, a new rise of 27.3% in one year and about 36.5 million bottles. In 2006, Cr√©mant d'Alsace represented the fourth of all AOC Alsace designations and gathered 500 winemakers together. A tenth of its production was exported, mainly into Belgium, Germany, Denmark, United States, Sweden, Switzerland and Netherlands (decreasingly ordered).Downloadable document on CIVA's site , p. 2/2. In 2008, it represented 248,000 hectolitres, that was 5% more than in 2007. From less than 1 million bottles in 1979, the annual production of Cr√©mant d'Alsace grew to 33 million bottles in 2009 (22% of all AOC Alsace wines) while sales climbed from 2.2 million bottles in 1982 to 30 million bottles in 2009.  Wines and gastronomy  Wines designated Cr√©mant d'Alsace must be bottled in the production area. The bottles have the same shape as Champagne bottles. Wines are labelled according to their make-up: blanc de blancs (white wine from white grapes), blanc de noirs (white wine from black grapes), brut (very dry), mill√©sim√© (vintage wine), ros√©, sigill√© (sealed, promoted by the Confr√©rie Saint-√âtienne d'Alsace). Varietal labelling is allowed if any of the allowed varieties is exclusively used (blanc de noirs and ros√© are inevitably varietal). Cr√©mant d'Alsace is recommended served between 5 and 7 ¬∞C in Champagne stemware. It can be offered as ap√©ritif. It can also be served during a whole meal. It suits seafoods and cheese.

Biography Deakin made four appearances in professional rugby league as a for Oldham,http://www.orl- heritagetrust.org.uk/HTML%20docs/player_stats_d.htm but was forced to retire due to injury. After a spell learning the industry of sports marketing in America, he returned to England and joined Bradford Bulls as a marketing executive in 1995. Along with coach Brian Smith, Deakin helped revolutionise the club's image ahead of the inaugural Super League season. As a result, crowds at Odsal Stadium rose sharply; the club's average crowd was over 10,000 in 1996, and by the end of the club's second season in Super League in 1997, the average attendance was over 15,000. Following this success, Saracens owner Nigel Wray lured him to Watford, where he delivered five-figure crowds for Premiership club Saracens, including the then record 19000 crowd at Saracens Watford home. His love of Rugby League proved too great, however, and he leapt at the chance to take over at Warrington Wolves. But he felt there were those at Wilderspool who did not share his vision, and after securing the Community Stadium (now renamed Halliwell Jones Stadium), he left. After a short tenure he bought into the vision of Sale Sharks' owner Brian Kennedy and started the processes which eventually led to Sale Sharks crowds of over 10000, and the Guinness Premiership victory in 2006. Peter was hit by the cancer, and although he battled bravely and had another spell at Saracens, it finally ended his life prematurely in 2003. Peter was remembered by the naming of the Man Of the Match Trophy in the Guinness Premiership Final.

Brother Daniel (Swedish: Broder Daniel), often abbreviated as BD, was an alternative rock band from Gothenburg, Sweden. They formed in the late 1980s and then consisted of classmates Henrik Berggren and Daniel Gilbert. The band claims they started playing \\"to gain social respect\\" and it was decided early on that emotional expression would be more important to their sound than musical correctness. Musically, they have been inspired by bands such as The Jesus And Mary Chain, Iggy Pop and The Velvet Underground, relying heavily on distorted guitars and simple arrangements. Their lyrics have mostly centered on existential issues and youth angst. Broder Daniel was largely regarded as an entitative cornerstone of Swedish alternative music during the 1990s, even though the band has proven to be quite unstable ever since the beginning, with members leaving the band every few years. History While attending G√∂teborgs H√∂gre Samskola in Gothenburg, Henrik Berggren was looking for a way to express himself, and decided that the easiest way would be to form a pop band. The first six years of the band's existence consisted of a number of name changes until the band finally settled on the name Broder Daniel - translating to Brother Daniel. A couple of new members joined and they slowly started to find their sound. Swedish music press soon caught on to the hype of the now notorious band featuring charismatic singer Henrik who in a short time had gained a cult following of maladjusted youth, looking for a leader. Journalists, however, tended to mostly focus on the violent shows and Henrik's make-up and out of tune voice. Music label Jimmy Fun Music, owned by Roxette member Per Gessle, picked the band up and promoted them until they signed to EMI Music Sweden. In 1995 the band released their debut album Saturday Night Engine which was characterized by its simple songs with relatively low respect for musical correctness. They soon gained a relatively large following of fans throughout Sweden. After releasing their second album, self-titled Broder Daniel, the band resigned from EMI in 1997 and found themselves without a record deal - something few people in the music industry could understand. While they did not sell many records, the band was indeed a popular act in clubs and on music festivals. One year later they signed to record label Dolores Recordings and released their most critically acclaimed album so far: Broder Daniel Forever. The new record was dark, with a focus on topics of love and death. Its sound was inspired by Psychocandy, the debut album of indie rockers The Jesus and Mary Chain. The popularity of Forever soon took off, and the band reached a larger audience than ever before in their career, much thanks to the inclusion of three Broder Daniel-songs on the soundtrack for the movie Show Me Love which was one of the most popular films in Sweden in the 1990s. Following the release of Forever, the band embarked on a controversial tour across Sweden, which the band later ended prematurely. A few shows were played in England as an attempt to sign a record deal for international release of their albums. That, however, didn't succeed. After the tour, the members parted ways to recover and did not maintain any contact with each other in the year that followed. In 2001, bass player H√•kan Hellstr√∂m released a solo record which hit big and soon after that he left the band, since the other members didn't think his reputation as a spreader of joy would reflect well on the band. Guitar player Theodor Jensen also released a celebrated record with his band The Plan. Five years after the release of Forever, the band once again got together to record their new album Cruel Town which was released in 2003. This time around they had a clear focus on the lyrics which were now more complex and less repetitive than before. This album showed a matured Broder Daniel, with themes based around society and nostalgia. Berggren was now singing about the cold society which had made him the person he is today, while looking back at his childhood. Since the Cruel Town tour, the band has performed only a few times together. Singer Henrik Berggren has performed several acoustic solo sets playing Broder Daniel-songs. On 30 March 2008, guitarist Anders G√∂thberg committed suicide in Stockholm. The band played together for the last time at Way Out West Festival in Gothenburg in honour of the late Anders G√∂thberg. During the concert they played their newly written song \\"Hold On to Your Dreams\\", dedicated to G√∂thberg. In August 2014, a memorial to the band was raised at the site of their last concert in Slottsskogen.

The sixth Baronet represented Penrhyn and Boroughbridge in Parliament. The eighth Baronet was Member of Parliament for New Shoreham.

In the process, he broke the yardage mark held by the legendary Joe Theismann. (All of Jackson's records were subsequently broken by Brady Quinn.) Jackson also threw for 17 touchdowns during his senior year, ranking third behind Ron Powlus and Rick Mirer. He was second on the team in rushing with 140 carries for 464 yards (3.3 avg) and 7 scores. Professional career =Denver Broncos= Jackson was drafted in the 7th round of the 2000 NFL Draft, 214th overall, by the Denver Broncos. Pro scouts projected that Jackson could develop into a solid NFL quarterback if placed into the right system. However, after four seasons as a Bronco backup, he saw action in only five games, completing 11 of 22 passes for 114 yards. =Barcelona Dragons= Jackson also spent one season (2001) in Barcelona, as part of NFL Europe, where he competed in the 2001 World Bowl. =BC Lions= In 2004, Jackson signed onto the practice squad of the BC Lions in the CFL.

He saw action in 2 games, had 3 completions out of 6 attempts for a total of 30 yards and rushed four times for a total of 35 yards. At the beginning of 2006 season, Jackson began as the third-string quarterback, behind Dickenson and Buck Pierce. However, with alternating injuries to Dickenson and Pierce, he made appearances in all but the final regular season game. 2007 proved, however, to be Jackson's break-out season as he became starting quarterback when Dickenson and Pierce were both out with injuries. For the 11 games Jackson was starting, he had a record of 9‚Äì2, threw for 2,553 yards, 18 TDs on 167 completions and 10 interceptions. On February 4, 2008, Jackson re-signed with the Lions 12 days before qualifying as a free-agent. At the beginning of the 2008 season, he was the back-up to Buck Pierce, but has started some games. His only pass in the Western semi-final was a touchdown toss to Geroy Simon. He was released by the Lions on February 1, 2012.Lions release veteran quarterback Jackson =Toronto Argonauts= On February 22, 2012, it was announced that Jackson had signed a two-year contract with the Toronto Argonauts.Argonauts take action and sign QB Jackson He dressed in all 18 games, starting in four, and was a member of the 100th Grey Cup winning team while throwing a touchdown pass in that game.

William Malet the younger forfeited his English lands and was banished from England, some time between the older Malet's death, circa 1106, and 1113. (Several other barons lost their lands in 1110, so that year is a likely date.) The precise cause is not known, but may be connected to conflict between King Henry I of England and King Louis VI of France. After his exile from England, Malet re-established himself in Normandy where he retained the Lordship of Graville. His descendants rose to prominence in France through their military exploits for the French crown.

Among his noted works include stories for the French M√©tal Hurlant and the Italian L'Eternauta magazines, and the comic series Metabarons co-developed by Alejandro Jodorowsky. Biography Gim√©nez L√≥pez was born in Mendoza, Argentina. He finished his high school education as an industrial designer. He then attended the National University of Cuyo's School of Arts and Design followed by the Academy of Fine Arts in Barcelona. While his early professional career was spend in advertising, with writing and drawing comics as a side activity, he eventually moved into comics as a full- time profession by his thirties. Gim√©nez had started getting his own stories published when he was sixteen years old in Argentine magazines Frontera, Misterix and Hora Cero. His first stories, for Argentine editors such as Colomba and Record, were largely inspired by Hugo Pratt (during the years he spent in Argentina) and Francisco Solano L√≥pez. Back to Spain, he worked for the Spanish magazines Zona 84 and Comix International, and Italian (Lanciostory, Skorpio) magazines. His work of this period is mainly related to war and science-fiction genres. He published his first French release Leo Roa (The Starr Conspiracy) in 1979. In 1980, he designed the \\"Harry Canyon\\" segment of the film Heavy Metal. During the 1980s, he collaborated with several European magazines, including Josep Toutain's Spanish edition of 1984, the French M√©tal Hurlant and the Italian L'Eternauta magazines, experimenting with graphical and narrative innovations. To this period dates what is ranked among his best series, the short science-fiction stories known under the title of Time Paradox. Also noteworthy are Ciudad, written by Ricardo Barreiro, and Le Quatri√®me Pouvoir (The Fourth Power), which he wrote by himself. Gim√©nez's style has become famous for the extreme attention he devotes to technical and historical details; his series Pik As has been defined as \\"a comic encyclopedia of World War II.\\" Gim√©nez also collaborated with important authors such as Carlos Trillo, Emilio Balcarce, and Roberto Dal Pr√†. One of his most famous collaborations was with Chilean Alejandro Jodorowsky for the popular Metabarons comic series started in 1992 and ran through 2003 published by Humanoids. The work was based on characters that had appeared in Jodorowsky's and Jean Giraud's The Incal, and adapted elements that Jodorowsky had been planning to use in a film adaption of Frank Herbert's Dune. Gim√©nez' art for the series was praised for spanning the vast vision and range that Jodorowsky had set up. Jodorowsky said on Gim√©nez's death: \\"I closely collaborated with Juan Gim√©nez for 10 years and together, we created The Metabarons saga. What facilitated my task as we offered him to work on the complex world of the Metabarons was that he already embodied the immortal No- Name, the last Metabaron. In my unconscious, Juan Gim√©nez cannot die. He will continue on, drawing like the master warrior that he was.\\" Gim√©nez was recognized with the Yellow Kid Award for Best Foreign Artist at the 1990 Lucca International Comic Fair, and the Gaudia Award at the 1990 Feria Internacional del Comics de Barcelone, among others. He died in Mendoza on 2 April 2020 from COVID-19; he had been hospitalized since 22 March having recently returned from a trip to Sitges, Spain where it was believed he had been infected.

Then following a brief residence in Nashville, he relocated to Natchez, Mississippi where he rose to prominence as an attorney and politician. Adams was reckoned by U.S. Senator Henry S. Foote to be an able orator despite an inferior formal education, able to expound upon a great variety of subjects in such a compelling manner that his listeners felt themselves in the presence of \\"one of nature's most wonderful productions.\\" =Political career= Adams was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1828, representing a district including the city of Natchez there. In the 19th century, state legislatures elected U.S. Senators, sometimes creating unusual paths for advancement. This was particularly true in the case of Robert Adams, who barely one year after being elected a state representative was surprisingly tapped to fill the seat vacated the recently deceased Thomas B. Reed, narrowly winning election to the open seat by vote of the legislature in a four-man field. Adams, a Jacksonian, advanced to the office and was sworn in on January 6, 1830. He served in Washington, D.C. throughout the winter and spring, returning to Mississippi for summer recess in May of that year. =Death and legacy= Not long after his return to Natchez, Adams was stricken ill and died suddenly on July 2, 1830, at the age of just 38. His body was interred in Natchez City Cemetery. Adams was remembered by Henry Foote as a talented and able public speaker for whom \\"there is no knowing what amount of fame he might have acquired, or what wonders he would have achieved upon the theatre of national affairs\\" had he not suffered a premature death.Henry S.

Its sources include prayer book rubrics, writings on sacramental theology by Anglican divines, and the regulations and orientations of ecclesiastical provinces. The principal source material is the Book of Common Prayer (abbr: BCP), specifically its eucharistic prayers and Article XXVIII of the Thirty-Nine Articles. Article XXVIII comprises the foundational Anglican doctrinal statement about the Eucharist, although its interpretation varies among churches of the Anglican Communion and in different traditions of churchmanship such as Anglo-Catholicism and Evangelical Anglicanism. Anglican eucharistic theologies universally affirm the real presence of Christ in the Eucharist, though Evangelical Anglicans believe that this is a pneumatic presence, while those of an Anglo-Catholic churchmanship believe this is a corporeal presence. In the former interpretation, those who receive the form or sign of the body and blood (bread and wine) in faith, receive also the spiritual body and blood of Christ. Those who receive the form or sign without faith, or for those who are wicked, Christ is not present spiritually and they consume only the physical signs of this holy presence, which further adds to their wickedness ‚Äì in accordance with Article XXIX. In the latter interpretation, there exists the corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, although the precise manner of how that presence is made manifest is a mystery of faith. To explain the manner of Christ's presence, some high-church Anglicans, however, teach the philosophical explanation of consubstantiation, associated with the English Lollards and, later, erroneously with Martin Luther, though Luther and the Lutheran churches explicitly rejected the doctrine of consubstatiation and actually promulgated their dogma of the sacramental union. A major leader in the Anglo-Catholic Oxford Movement, Edward Pusey, championed the view of consubstantiation. Sacramental theology With the Eucharist, as with other aspects of theology, Anglicans are largely directed by the principle of lex orandi, lex credendi which means \\"the law of prayer is the law of belief\\". In other words, sacramental theology as it pertains to the Eucharist is sufficiently and fully articulated by the Book of Common Prayer of a given jurisdiction. As defined by the 16th-century Anglican theologian Richard Hooker, the sacraments are said to be \\"visible signs of invisible grace\\"; similarly the Catechism of the 1662 version states that a sacrament is \\"an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given to us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.\\" It thus has the effect of conveying sanctification in the individual participating in the sacrament. According to this, in the Eucharist the outward and visible sign is \\"bread and wine\\" and the \\"thing signified\\", the \\"body and blood of Christ\\", which are truly taken and received by the faithful in the Lord's supper. Sacraments have both form and matter. Form is the verbal and physical liturgical action, while the matter refers to material objects used (bread and wine). In an Anglican Eucharist the form is contained in the rite and its rubrics, as articulated in the authorised prayer books of the ecclesiastical province. Central to the rite is the eucharistic prayer or \\"Great Thanksgiving\\". For the vast majority of Anglicans, the Eucharist (also called \\"Holy Communion\\", \\"Mass\\", the Divine Liturgy, the \\"Lord's Supper,\\" or The Great Thanksgiving), is the central act of gathered worship, the appointed means by which Christ can become present to his church. For the majority of Anglicans this event constitutes the renewal of the Body of Christ as the Church through the reception of the Body of Christ as the Blessed Sacrament, his spiritual body and blood. In this sacrament, Christ is both encountered and incorporated (they \\"partake\\" of him). As such, the eucharistic action looks backward as a memorial of Christ's sacrifice, forward as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet and to the present as an incarnation of Christ in the lives of the community and of individual believers. Anglican doctrine concerning the eucharist is contained in Article XXVIII - Of the Lord's Supper and XXIX - Of the Wicked which eat not the Body of Christ of the Thirty-Nine Articles. The Catechism of the Church of England, the foundational church of the Anglican Communion, is found in the Book of Common Prayer and states that, as with other sacraments, the eucharist is \\"an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace given unto us, ordained by Christ himself, as a means whereby we receive the same, and a pledge to assure us thereof.\\" The outward sign, in this instance, is the bread and wine; and the thing signified is the body and blood of Christ. Varieties of eucharistic theology Because of the various theological movements which have influenced Anglicanism throughout history, there is no one sacramental theory accepted by all Anglicans. Early Anglican theologians, such as Thomas Cranmer and Richard Hooker, held to a sacramental theology similar to John Calvin. Cranmer's belief was substantially Calvinist, Receptionism and Virtualism, as shown by Peter Brooks in 1965.The Study of Liturgy, 1991, p. 316 Hooker's was a more nuanced combination of Receptionism and Real Presence but agnostic as to what the elements were in themselves but insistent that \\"the sacrament is a true and a real participation of Christ, who thereby imparteth himself even in his whole entire Person as a Mystical Head...\\"John R. H. Moorman, IX Bishop of Ripon, The Anglican Spiritual Tradition, 1983, p. 77, He brushes aside transubstantiation and consubstantiation and urges people to meditate in silence and less to dispute the manner 'how.'Moorman, p. 77 The views were congenial for centuries to the majority of Anglicans.Study of Liturgy, p. 316 The 19th-century Oxford Movement sought to give the Eucharist a more prominent place and upheld belief in the real presence of Christ in the sacrament. Anglicans now hold a variety of sacramental theologies, representing a spectrum of theories found in other Christian traditions. =Corporeal presence= Anglicans of Anglo-Catholic churchmanship, as well as some high-church Evangelicals, hold to a belief in the corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, but maintain that the details of how Christ is made present remain a mystery of faith, a view also held by the Orthodox Church, Lutheran Church, and Methodist Church. Holding this view, \\"the Tractarians were concerned ... to exalt the importance of the sacrament\\", but were \\"generally hostile to the doctrine of transubstantiation.\\" Article XXVIII of the Thirty-Nine Articles declares that \\"Transubstantiation ... cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.\\" Edgar Gibson, the Bishop of Gloucester, who was Anglo-Catholic in churchmanship, defended the phrase \\"cannot be Proved by Holy Writ\\" in Article XXVIII, stating, =Pneumatic presence= Low-church Anglicans reject belief in a corporeal presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and accordingly, usually any belief in the reservation and adoration of the sacrament. Reservation was eliminated in practice by the rubric at the end of the 1662 Communion service which ordered the reverent consumption of any consecrated bread and wine immediately after the blessing, and adoration by the \\"Declaration concerning Kneeling\\". Instead, they hold to a \\"spiritual real presence\\" view of the Eucharist similar to the views held by Reformed Protestant denominations such as Presbyterians. Low-church parishes and ministers tend to celebrate the Eucharist less frequently (e.g., monthly) and prefer the terms \\"Holy Communion\\" or \\"Lord's Supper\\". This view has historical precedent. During the seminal years of the English Reformation, Thomas Cranmer was in correspondence with many continental Reformers, several of whom came to England at his request to aid in reforms there. They included Martin Bucer, Paul Fagius, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Bernardino Ochino and Jan ≈Åaski. The views of these men were in line with the Reformed doctrine of the sacrament. Cranmer wrote on the Eucharist in his treatise On the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Lord's Supper that Christians truly receive Christ's \\"self-same\\" Body and Blood at Communion ‚Äì but in \\"an heavenly and spiritual manner\\" which is close to the Calvinistic doctrine.Farris, Joshua; Hamilton, S. Mark; Speigel, James, S, Idealism and Christian Theology: Idealism and Christianity. Vol. I, . This is in agreement with the continental Reformed view found in Chapter XXI of the Second Helvetic Confession: This emphasis on the faith of the receiver instead of the elements, common to both the Continental Reformed churches and the Church of England, has also been called \\"receptionism\\". However, Christ's presence in the sacrament is objective and is in no way dependent on the attitude of the recipient who perceives it by faith. =Consubstantiation= The doctrine of consubstantiation, which originated out of the pre-Reformation Lollardy movement in England, is one with which some Anglicans identify. The 19th-century Anglo-Catholic divine Edward Bouverie Pusey (a leader of the Oxford Movement) argued strongly for the idea of consubstantiation. Discussing Pusey's view, Thomas S. L. Vogan wrote: In this doctrine, the bread and wine do not disappear at the consecration, but that the Body and Blood become present without diminishing them. Although it originated with Lollardism, consubstantiation is erroneously said to be the doctrine of Martin Luther and the Lutheran churches, which actually reject consubstantiation and instead teach the doctrine of sacramental union. A maxim in Anglicanism concerning Christ's presence is that \\"it may not be about a change of substance, but it is about a substantial change.\\" Cited in . If substantial denotes a spiritual property of the sacraments themselves this is the Reformed view, since, after consecration, the elements are only fit for holy use and may no longer be used as common bread and wine. This view is expressed in the allied but metaphysically different doctrines of consubstantiation and sacramental union. Both views hold that Christ is present in the eucharistic elements spiritually. Such spiritual presence may or may not be believed to be in bodily form, depending on the particular doctrinal position. It may in fact be a mystical, yet still physical, Body of Christ, as some Anglicans hold, or a superphysical reality \\"superimposed\\" in, with, and under the bread and wine. Although this is similar to consubstantiation, it is different as it has a decidedly mystical emphasis. =Receptionism= An imprecisely defined view common amongst 16th- and 17th-century Anglican theologians is known as \\"receptionism\\", a term not found before 1867. According to this view, although the bread and wine remain unchanged, through the worthy reception of the sacrament the communicant receives the body and blood of Christ. It remained \\"the dominant theological position in the Church of England until the Oxford Movement in the early nineteenth century, with varying degrees of emphasis\\". It is important to remember that it is \\"a doctrine of the real presence\\" but one which \\"relates the presence primarily to the worthy receiver rather than to the elements of bread and wine\\".Crockett, William R., 'Holy Communion,' in Sykes, Stephen; Booty, John, The Study of Anglicanism, 1988 p. 275 Shape of the rite As mentioned above, the liturgy for the Eucharist is important in Anglican eucharistic theology because of the principle of lex orandi, lex credendi. The liturgy is defined in the authorised prayer books of the various national churches and ecclesiastical provinces of the communion. The eucharistic rites follow one or other of two main sources, either the First English Prayer Book of 1549 or the Second of 1552 which, with minor modifications, became the 1662 Book BCP which is still today the official and legal reference-point for the Church of England.Canons A3, A5 The author of both rites was Thomas Cranmer, who maintained that there was no theological difference between the two, but was forced to make its reformed theology more obvious when conservative clergy hostile to the English Reformation took advantage of loopholes in the 1549 prayer book to make the new liturgy as much like the old Latin Mass as possible, including elevating the Eucharist. Some or all of the following elements may be altered, transposed, or absent depending on the rite used by the province or national church. In modern liturgies whichever source (1549 or 1552) they follow for the sacrament, the Liturgy of the Word has, with variations, a fairly standard pattern: *The Liturgy of the Word ** The Gathering of the Community: Beginning with a Trinitarian-based greeting or seasonal acclamation; followed by the Collect for Purity; the Gloria in Excelsis Deo, Kyrie eleison, and/or Trisagion; and then the Collect of the day. During Lent and/or Advent especially, this part of the service may begin or end with a penitential rite. ** The Proclamation of the Word: Usually two to three readings of Scripture, one of which is always from the Gospels, plus a psalm (or portion thereof) or canticle. This is followed by a sermon or homily; the recitation of the Apostles' or Nicene Creed; ** The Prayers of the People: Very varied in form. The passing of the peace may be placed here. *The Liturgy of Sacrament (1549, Scottish Canon, recent prayer books) **The Celebration of the Eucharist: The gifts of bread and wine are received, along with other gifts (such as money and/or food for a food bank, etc.), and an offertory prayer is recited. Following this, a eucharistic prayer (called \\"The Great Thanksgiving\\") is recited. This prayer consists of a dialogue (the Sursum Corda), a preface, the sanctus and benedictus, the Words of Institution, the anamnesis, the oblation or presentation of the gifts to God in the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving, the epiclesis or request that the Holy Spirit descend upon the gifts and sanctify them to be the Body and Blood of Jesus, an eschatological statement about the end time, doxology and congregational assent, Amen. The entire prayer is consecratory. The Lord's Prayer follows, and is followed by the fraction (the breaking of the bread), the Prayer of Humble Access, which is optional, the Agnus Dei, and the distribution of the sacred elements (the bread and wine). There is a post-Communion prayer. A doxology or general prayer of thanksgiving may follow. The service concludes with a Trinitarian blessing and the dismissal. *The Liturgy of Sacrament (1552/1662 style): **The priest prepares the table. Invitation to examine oneself, confession, absolution, \\"comfortable words\\".Mt 11:28; John 3:16; I Tim 1:15 1 John 2:1 The Sursum Corda, preface, the sanctus, Prayer of Humble Access, Words of Institution. Then comes the distribution of the elements, the Lord's Prayer, concluding prayer of thanksgiving, the Gloria in Excelsis Deo and blessing. The theology of these rites has been considerably modified in the last 200 years, with the reintroduction of oblationary language as pertaining to an objective, material sacrifice offered to God in union with Christ. The Prayer Books of 1552, 1559, 1604 and 1662 placed sacrificial language in a post- communion prayer in order to detach it from the context of the eucharistic prayer. A prime example of these modifications can be found in the American Book of Common Prayer introduced by the first American Episcopal bishop Samuel Seabury and adopted by the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church in 1789. He insisted on the adoption of a full eucharistic prayer of the non-Juror Scottish Episcopal Church Rite to replace the truncated version of the earlier English rites beginning in 1552. The adopted prayer included the words, \\"with these thy holy gifts, which we now offer unto thee\\", which were inserted after the words from the 1549 Rite \\"we, thy humble servants, do celebrate and make before thy Divine Majesty, and before the words \\"the memorial thy Son hath commanded us to make\\" BCP (cf. these changes in the article on Samuel Seabury). An epiclesis was also restored. The insertion of these ten words in effect undid Cranmer's theology that the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving was restricted to words and sentiments in prayer. = Church of England = Throughout the 20th century the Eucharist in the Church of England has undergone a number of significant changes and in most churches the BCP is no longer used for many services. The Prayer Book (Alternative and Other Services) Measure of 1965 redefined where \\"lawful authority lay\\". * The Book of Common Prayer 1662 * A new concept of alternative services that could be authorised for up to seven years. Further authorisation of seven years could be granted by General Synod. * Provision for making legal other services outside the range of Book of Common Prayer such as family services. Under the new measure all services that the 1928 deposited prayer book that had been in use for nearly 40 years on the say so of individual bishops lost all legal authority. They would then have to authorised as alternate services. The Liturgical Commission would not assist in this process so it was left to the House of Bishops to edit a set of rites from 1928 and publish them. These were published in December 1965 as were later to be known as Series 1. At the same time the Liturgical Commission also produced and published texts in readiness for the new measures to come into force and these were known as Series 2. The eucharist in this series met with dissent in two key places: the use of 'offer' in relation to the bread and wine in the eucharistic prayer and the provision of prayers for the dead. It took until 1967 for General Synod to agree to a shape for the service. But in 1969 the whole of Series 2 was to disappear into obscurity following a dispute between the Houses of Laity and Clergy over the funeral service. At the same that Series 1 and 2 were going through General Synod there was a growing shift in the English speaking world away from the use of Tudor language in worship. Use of modern English and addressing God as you gave birth to a further version of the eucharist which would be called Series 3. The International Consultation on English Texts (ICET) produced some recommended common texts for English speaking Christians. Unlike Series 1 and 2 which had a shape based on the BCP the series 3 communion service followed the shape that many today would recognise. Its first presentation to General Synod in 1971 led to severe criticism but after some minor revisions it was approved the following year. Although the BCP remained the norm in many parishes a high proportion were being prepared for a new series of services where God was addressed as 'you' all the way throughout. Alternative Service Book The time limits introduced in 1966 hampered the usefulness of the new services. Many were produced in chap booklet forms. But the Church of England (Worship and Doctrine) Measure 1974 permitted General Synod to provide by canon the unlimited use of alternative services. In 1976 a working party was set up to bring all of the various series three booklets including that for the eucharist together into a single volume of reasonable This work was completed by the end of 1979 and the volume was authorised by synod the following year. Initially this was for 10 years but in 1990 this was extended for a further 10 years. The Alternative Service Book 1980 (ASB) had two communion services - Rite A and Rite B. Rite B was based on Series 1 in as far as it was based on the shape of the BCP service and was in traditional language. Rite A was based on the Series 3 communion service and the majority of the volume was written in contemporary language in recognition that English over the centuries since the BCP was produced had changed in meaning and usage. The order for Rite A is as follows: * The preparation: a greeting, the collect of purity and the penitential rite. * Kyrie Elesion or Gloria in Excelsis depending on the season. * Ministry of the Word: scriptural readings, a psalm (often not used), sermon and creed. * Prayers of intercession and an alternative place for the penitential rite if needed. * Sharing of The peace * Ministry of the Sacrament including the offertory and the use of one of four eucharistic prayers to consecrate the bread and wine. The shape of which were as outlined above including prayer 4 which was version of the BCP prayer in modern English. * The provision for the use of hymns and other sacred music There was also an order of service for parishes who wished to have a service in modern English but still keep the shape of that found in the BCP. This prayer book proved to be successful with it being taken up by the majority of parishes with rite A being the most popular of the two. But work did not stop here. There was a distinctive language shift which included the use of inclusive language as outlined in the report Making Women Visible (1988) but which was only adopted when the revised text for Common Worship was compiled. Seasonal material was produced. Firstly in 1986 was Lent, Holy Week and Easter which was followed in 1992 by The Promise of His Glory which contained a series of material for use between All Saints and Candlemas. = Common Worship = Common Worship is the name given to the library of volumes that replace the Alternative Service Book 1980. In 1994 the Liturgical Commission suggested to General Synod that it was better to produce a series of separate texts rather than to squeeze everything into one volume. This reflected the findings of the Faith in the City report published in 1985 which identified that to give people a volume of 1300 pages was a symptom of the gulf between church and ordinary people. Ease of handling was the aim of producing the new worship material. This was available in separate booklets, congregational cards, downloadable files and also part of Visual Liturgy Service composing programme. The main volumes for the eucharist are * Common Worship: Services and Prayers for the Church of England: The main or core volume from which congregational worship is drawn * Common Worship: President's Edition which is used from where the service is lead * Common Worship: Times and Seasons bringing together season material. Parishes were able to draw upon the core material to produce user friendly booklets to match the season and their local situation. Within Common Worship as in the ASB there are two orders of service - Order 1 and Order 2. Order 1 is a gentle revision of Rite A found in the ASB. The shape of the service was on the whole kept unchanged but the compilers of Common Worship were able to draw upon experience of post ASB seasonal material as well as changes to worship occurring in other denominations. Major changes to the text took place to ensure that inclusive language was used as well as giving a much wider choice of text. The rite was available in both modern and traditional language as was that in Order 2. The shape of Order 1 is as follows Introduction * The people and the priest greet each other in the Lord's name * Confess their sins. This is the only place it can now happen * Gloria unless in the penitential seasons * Collect of the day The Word * At least two readings including the Gospel * A sermon * The creed or some other profession of faith Prayers of intercession The Meal * Sharing of the peace * Receiving of offerings * Consecration of bread and wine * Receiving of communion Ending departing with God's blessing Order 2 has a more prayer book feel to the service. Introduction * The people and priest prepare for worship by hearing and responding to the commandments * Pray a collect The word * At least two readings * A sermon * A profession of faith The Prayers * Prepare the table * Pray for the church and world * Confess their sins The Meal Praise God for his goodness * Consecrate the bread and wine * Receive communion * Respond with thanksgiving Ending by departing with God's blessing Each order can draw on one of eight communion prayers Prayers A to C were drawn from those that had been in rite A of the ASB with some revisions Prayer D is responsorial in nature and good for all age worship Prayer E is the shortest and has some of the flavour of prayer A Prayer F is responsorial and has its origins in the Eastern Christian tradition Prayer G is a redraft of a prayer produced by the Roman Catholic Church Prayer H is a dialogue between the priest and the people which ends with sanctus as an offering of praise But Common Worship does not end there as the material that is now available for the eucharist is considerable. It includes * Two versions of the summary of the law * Two versions of the commandments * The Beatitudes * Two versions of the comfortable words * Four invitations to Confession * Six Confessions * Two Absolution * Seven Gospel Acclamations * Four prayers after communion * Seven authorised affirmations of faith as well as the Nicene and Apostles' Creed * Fifteen sets of seasonal provisions This allows churches to have a lot more variety within their worship as well as to mark the seasons in a meaningful way. The most common way of presenting the material is through service booklets to make it user friendly rather than presenting the whole volume. Customary of the rite Typical style of an Anglican altar The rubrics of a given prayer book outline the parameters of acceptable practice with regard to ritual, vestments, ornaments and method and means of distribution of the sacrament. The communal piety of a given parish or diocese will determine the expression of these rubrics and the implicit eucharist theology. Until the latter part of the 19th century, the so-called \\"Ornaments Rubric\\" of the 1662 Prayer Book was interpreted to inhibit much of the ceremonial contemporary Anglicans take for granted. Priests were directed to stand at the north side or north end of the altar and candles on the altar were considered forbidden, as was the wearing of a chasuble or maniple. The Ritualist controversies of the late 19th century solidified the ascendancy of the Oxford Movement in the United Kingdom and many other parts of the Anglican Communion, introducing a much greater diversity of practice. =Low church= William White celebrating communion in choir dress in the 19th century. Such practice remains typical of low-church clergy, who object to the use of sacramental vestments. In low-church parishes ceremonial is generally kept at a minimum, according to the rubrics of historical Anglican prayer books. The service is more often called Holy Communion than the eucharist. The priest is typically attired simply in a cassock, surplice, and a black scarf (called a tippet). This is a priest's \\"choir habit\\" as worn at a service of the word, but may also be worn as eucharistic vestments as was commonly done in earlier years. In some provinces identifying Low Church tradition by vesture alone is becoming more difficult as boundaries become blurred. Many parishes that have a more charismatic flavour have generally abandoned the use of robes at most of their services and their services are similar to that found in Pentecostal churches. But even this is not universal and will depend on parish tradition with some being vested for special occasions and the eucharist if it is celebrated less frequently, or if it is part of confirmation. In some Low Church parishes the minister may replace the black preaching scarf with a stole reflecting the colour of the season. Manual action is kept to the standards of the rubrics found in the Book of Common Prayer (often confined to placing one's hands on the elements during the words of institution). The altar is referred to as the \\"Lord's table\\", the \\"holy table\\", or simply the \\"table\\". Candles are either absent or two in number. The material on the table may be limited to the chalice and paten, a cloth covering and, in some instances, the prayer book. The celebration of Holy Communion may be weekly or monthly. This frequency is in keeping with the Anglican practice that predominated prior to the 20th century. After the service, and following historical rubrics, the unconsumed bread and wine are reverently eaten by the priest and other ministers. If there is more than the clergy can finish, lay persons are called to help eat the remaining elements. In accordance with the Articles of Religion, the remaining bread and wine are not reserved in a tabernacle or aumbry. In some parishes, the president stands at the north-side of the holy table to read the service, in accordance with some interpretations of the rubrics of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer. =Broad church / Central churchmanship= In most broad-church parishes there is slightly more elaboration. Attending the eucharist at a broad-church parish nowadays is likely to be similar in many respects to a contemporary Roman Catholic Mass. Priests will generally be vested in an alb and stole and also, in many instances, a chasuble. They may make use of a lavabo in preparation for the celebration and the chalice and paten may be initially concealed by a burse and ornamental veil. Candles will almost always be present on the altar. Broad-church Anglicans typically celebrate the eucharist every Sunday, or at least most Sundays. The rite may also be celebrated once or twice at other times during the week. The sacrament is often reserved in an aumbry or consumed. Broad-church Anglicans may not reverence the sacrament, as such, but will frequently bow when passing the altar. =Anglo-Catholic= Anglo- Catholic worship involves further elaboration. The priest will often be joined by a deacon and often a reader (the deacon being ordained in Holy Orders). A Reader is a lay person authorised to lead worship and preach who will also be found in low-church and broad-church traditions as well. The former will be dressed in the historic eucharistic vestments specific to their office (chasuble, dalmatic and tunicle, respectively). They will sometimes wear maniples and ornamented amices. The Reader will always wear cassock, surplice and blue scarf as laid down by canon. In many churches the altar will be fixed against the \\"east wall\\" and the sacred ministers will celebrate Mass facing the tabernacle (often surmounted by a crucifix) above the altar, i.e., the sacred ministers and the congregation will all be facing the same direction. Apart from the tabernacle (containing the reserved sacrament) the altar is often adorned with six candles. Incense and sanctus bells are often used during the liturgy and the eucharist itself is often supplemented by a number of prayers from earlier liturgies prayed by the priest, sacred ministers, and servers and sometimes the people as well. Anglo-Catholic eucharistic theology places an emphasis on frequent communion, ideally daily. The unconsumed elements are typically reserved in a tabernacle or aumbry safe, either attached to a fixed altar or placed behind or to one side of a free-standing altar. Reserved sacrament is often used when visiting the sick or housebound, as well as in ministry to the dying. When the sacrament is present, Anglo- Catholics will often genuflect when passing in front of it. When absent they will bow to the altar. Often an aumbry is dignified in the same way. Many Anglo-Catholics practice eucharistic adoration and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, either informally or through a corporate liturgical rite. Administration While the matter is always bread and wine, there is some variation. The bread may be in the form of individual wafers or an actual loaf from which pieces are torn off and distributed. Wine is typically red, but may be white. In some instances, fortified wine, such as sherry or port wine, is used. In still others, the option of juice is offered, usually in consideration of recipients who may be alcoholic (although it is considered acceptable and valid to receive the sacrament in only in one kind, i.e., the bread, pace the rubrics of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer). The manner of administration varies. Many Anglican parishes retain the use of an altar rail, separating the area around the altar from the rest of the church. This practice is meant to convey the sanctity associated with the altar. In such churches, those who wish to receive communion will come forward and kneel at the altar rail, sometimes making the sign of the cross and cupping their hands (right over left) to receive the bread, then crossing themselves again to receive the chalice. Anglo-Catholics are often careful not to chew the bread (hence the overwhelming use of wafers in these parishes) or touch the chalice. Some prefer to have the bread placed directly on their tongue. In other parishes recipients stand before the administrators to receive Communion, while in still others participants may pass the sacrament from one to the next, often standing in a circle around the altar. The practice of using individual cups and handing out individual wafers or pieces of bread to be consumed simultaneously by the whole congregation is extremely uncommon in Anglicanism, but not unheard of. Anglican practice is that those who administer the sacrament must be licensed by the diocesan bishop. Traditionally, priests and deacons were the only ministers authorised to administer; however, many provinces now permit the licensing of lay administrants. The question of who may receive communion likewise varies. In historic Anglican practice, the altar was \\"fenced\\" from those whose manner of living was considered to be unrepentantly sinful. As parishes grew and the private lives of individuals became less accessible to public knowledge, this practice receded -- although priests will, on occasion, refuse to admit to communion those whom they know to be actively engaged in notoriously sinful behaviour, such as criminal activity. Most Anglican provinces keep an \\"open table\\", meaning that all baptised Christians are welcome to receive communion. In many others, access to the sacrament is reserved for those who have been both baptised and confirmed, either in the Anglican or another tradition. Those who are ineligible or do not wish to receive are frequently encouraged to come forward and cross their arms to form a sign of the cross to indicate that they wish to receive a blessing. Reservation, consumption, disposal A rubric following the Order of Holy Communion in the 1662 Book of Common Prayer instructs that any remaining bread and wine should be consumed as soon as the service concludes: In American Prayer Books (until 1979), the rubric read thus: Article XXVIII of the Articles of Religion states that, \\"The Sacrament of the Lord‚Äôs Supper was not by Christ‚Äôs ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.\\" Edgar Gibson, the Bishop of Gloucester explains this article, writing that \\"The statement in the Article is worded with the utmost care, and with studied moderation. It cannot be said that any one of the practices is condemned or prohibited by it. It only amounts to this: that none of them can claim to be part of the original Divine institution.\\" The Anglican priest Jonathan A. Mitchican rehashes this view, stating that Article XXVIII does not forbid the practice of reservation, but notes that it does not have an origin in Sacred Scripture. As such, today, only a minority of Anglican dioceses do not authorize their individual churches to reserve the sacrament between services. In these churches, reverent consumption or disposal is often practiced. When disposed, the elements may be finely broken/poured over the earth or placed down a \\"piscina\\" in the sacristy, a sink with a pipe that leads underground to a pit or into the earth. What is done with the remaining elements is often reflective of churchmanship. Where reservation is permissible parishes will place the sacrament (along with holy oils) in an aumbry - a cupboard inserted in the wall of the chancel. As mentioned above, Anglo-Catholic parishes believing in the corporeal presence of the blessed sacrament make use of a tabernacle or hanging pyx, with which is associated various acts of reverence and adoration. Ecumenical developments In 1910, Raphael of Brooklyn, an Eastern Orthodox bishop, \\"sanctioned an interchange of ministrations with the Episcopalians in places where members of one or the other communion are without clergy of their own\\". Raphael stated that in places \\"where there is no resident Orthodox Priest\\", an Anglican priest could administer Marriage, Holy Baptism, and the Blessed Sacrament to an Orthodox layperson. In 1912, however, Raphael ended the intercommunion after becoming uncomfortable with the fact that the Anglican Communion contained different churchmanships within it, e.g. high church, Evangelical, etc. Representatives of the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches have declared that they have reached \\"substantial agreement on the doctrine of the Eucharist\\" in the Windsor Statement on Eucharistic Doctrine developed by the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission, as well as the commission's Elucidation of the ARCIC Windsor Statement. In 1994, the Anglican‚ÄìRoman Catholic Consultation in the United States of America released Five Affirmations on the Eucharist as Sacrifice, which stated This amounts to an acceptance of the doctrine, with an expression of a reservation about the use of the name of the doctrine in English because the word is misunderstood by English speakers.

The Marlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship holds that the Elizabethan poet and playwright Christopher Marlowe was the main author of the poems and plays attributed to William Shakespeare. Further, the theory says Marlowe did not die in Deptford on 30 May 1593, as the historical records state, but that his death was faked. Marlovians (as those who subscribe to the theory are usually called) base their argument on supposed anomalies surrounding Marlowe's reported death \\"Doctor Hotson's brilliant discovery of the documents relating to Marlowe's death, raises almost as many questions as it answers.\\" and on the significant influence which, according to most scholars, Marlowe's works had on those of Shakespeare.The International Marlowe-Shakespeare Society has a relevant selection of quotations on its website. They also point out the coincidence that, despite their having been born only two months apart, the first time the name William Shakespeare is known to have been connected with any literary work whatsoever was with the publication of Venus and Adonis just a week or two after the death of Marlowe. The argument against this is that Marlowe's death was accepted as genuine by sixteen jurors at an inquest held by the Queen's personal coroner, that everyone apparently thought that he was dead at the time, and that there is a complete lack of direct evidence supporting his survival beyond 1593. While there are similarities between their works, \\"A nearly collusive relationship between the two dramatists, starting around 1590, really ensured that Tamburlaine's revolution in form and significant ideas would not die out. Much depended upon a fresh attitude to creativity itself, and it was Marlowe who most encouraged Shakespeare to bring stateliness and a high poetic habit to the drama.\\" Marlowe's style, vocabulary, imagery, and his apparent weaknesses‚Äîparticularly in the writing of comedy. However, Donna N. Murphy proposed that some Shakespeare plays were co-authorships between Marlowe and his friend, humorist Thomas Nashe.‚Äîare said to be too different from Shakespeare's to be compatible with the claims of the Marlovians. The convergence of documentary evidence of the type used by academics for authorial attribution‚Äîtitle pages, testimony by other contemporary poets and historians, and official records‚Äîsufficiently establishes Shakespeare of Stratford's authorship for the overwhelming majority of Shakespeare scholars and literary historians,; Further arguments for the orthodox position can be found in chapters 3 and 4 of , and the last chapter of . who consider the Marlovian theory, like all other alternative theories of Shakespeare authorship, a fringe theory.: \\"...antiStratfordism has remained a fringe belief system\\". Proponents In August 1819 an anonymous writer for The Monthly Review, or Literary Journal suggested that 'Christopher Marlowe' might be a pseudonym assumed for a time by Shakespeare, and this idea was developed further in the same journal in September 1820, noting how Shakespeare \\"disappears from all biographical research just at the moment when Marlowe first comes on the stage; and who re-appears in his proper name\\" shortly after the first reports of Marlowe's death. In other words, they argued, just one person was the main author of both the Marlowe and Shakespeare canons. Marlowe's candidacy was initially suggested by Thomas William White, M.A., in the 1892 book Our English Homer; Or, Shakespeare Historically Considered, as a member of a group of authors.. The first person to propose that the works of Shakespeare were primarily by Marlowe was Wilbur G. Zeigler, who presented a case for it in the preface to his 1895 novel, It was Marlowe: a story of the secret of three centuries, which creates an imaginary narrative about how the deception might have occurred. On the tercentenary of Shakespeare's death, in 1916, the Pulitzer prize-winning editor of Louisville's Courier-Journal, Henry Watterson, supported the Marlovian theory also by using a fictional account of how it might have happened. The first essay solely on the subject was written by Archie Webster in 1923. All three were published before Leslie Hotson's discovery in 1925 of the inquest on Marlowe's death, but since then there have nevertheless been several other books supporting the idea, with perhaps the two most influential being those by Calvin Hoffman (1955) and A.D. Wraight (1994). Hoffman's main argument centred on similarities between the styles of the two writers, particularly in the use of similar wordings or ideas‚Äîcalled \\"parallelisms\\". Wraight, following Webster, delved more into what she saw as the true meaning of Shakespeare's sonnets. To their contributions should perhaps also be added that of Michael Rubbo, an Australian documentary film maker who, in 2001, made the TV film Much Ado About Something in which the Marlovian theory was explored in some detail, and the creation in 2009 of the International Marlowe-Shakespeare Society which has continued to draw the theory to the public's attention. Marlowe's death As far as is generally accepted by mainstream scholars, Christopher Marlowe died on 30 May 1593 as the result of a knife wound above the right eye inflicted upon him by Ingram Frizer, an acquaintance with whom he had been dining. Together with two other men, Robert Poley and Nicholas Skeres, they had spent that day together at the Deptford home of Eleanor Bull, a respectable widow who apparently offered, for payment, room and refreshment for such private meetings. As new information has become available over the years, however, the Marlovian argument about Marlowe's death has itself changed from (1) thinking that because, in their view, he later wrote under the name of Shakespeare, his death must have been faked;The Marlovian theory existed before Hotson's discovery of the inquest details in 1925, so neither Zeigler nor Watterson nor Webster had any details of the killing to challenge. to (2) challenging the details of the inquest in an attempt to show that it must have been untrue;Immediately following their publication, the inquest details were challenged by such scholars as Eug√©nie de Kalb, William Poel and Samuel Tannenbaum (), and these complaints, plus others of their own, were of course used by most Marlovian theory authors as excellent ammunition. to (3) claiming that the circumstances surrounding it suggest that the faking is the most likely scenario, whether he went on to write Shakespeare or not.The publication of Marlovian Peter Farey's article Marlowe's Sudden and Fearful End (), in which there was no mention of Shakespeare at all, signalled a shift of emphasis which is evident in the Introduction to Daryl Pinksen's Marlowe's Ghost (). See also Rosalind Barber's lecture on her doctoral research, Rethinking Shakespeare , published by the University of Sussex. =The inquest= On 1 June, two days after the reported killing, the inquest was held in the same house by the Coroner of The Queen's Household, William Danby, and a 16-man jury found it to have been in self- defence. The body of this \\"famous gracer of tragedians\\", as Robert Greene had called him, is recorded as being buried the same day in the churchyard of St. Nicholas, Deptford, but the exact location of his grave is unknown. The Queen sanctioned Frizer's pardon just four weeks later. Most scholars would now agree that the official verdict of the inquest was to some extent untrue, concluding that Marlowe's stabbing was not done in self-defence, as claimed by the witnesses, but was a deliberate murder. Of those books or articles written about‚Äîor including an explanation of‚ÄîMarlowe's death over the past twenty years or so, most of the authors believe that the witnesses were probably lying.Those suspecting this include: ; ; ; ; (a different theory); ; ; ; and . Only , and , accepted the verdict of the jury as it was reported. Usually they suggest that it was a political murder, citing the fact that the two witnesses, Robert Poley and Nicholas Skeres, were or had been agents in the pay of members of the government. Some commentators have found details of the killing itself unconvincing.For example, Park Honan () cites forensic reasons for doubting that the wound would have killed him instantly. There is, however, hardly any agreement as to exactly why such a murder occurred or who was behind it. Marlovians say that this confusion arises from scholars asking the wrong question. Instead of trying to find out why he was killed, they should be asking why those particular people would have met at that particular place on that particular day. The Marlovian theory argues that the most logical reason for that meeting to have taken place would have been to fake his death. = Means, motive and opportunity = William Cecil, Lord Burghley.It is generally accepted that Marlowe had been employed in some capacity as a secret agent, either by the late Sir Francis Walsingham or by the Cecils (Lord Burghley and his son Sir Robert Cecil), or both. He could therefore, theoretically at least, call on powerful friends, with all of the means at their disposal to organize a faked death. He was also in deep trouble at the time. \\"But counterfeiting, treason, homosexuality, and blasphemy were all capital offences: the only question was whether hanging, beheading or being burnt at the stake was the most appropriate punishment.\\" Accusations of his having persuaded others to atheism were coming to the Privy Council thick and fast and, whether true or not, he was certainly suspected of having written an atheistic book which was being used for subversive purposes., . For such crimes, trial and execution would have been almost guaranteed. Within the past two months, at least three people, Henry Barrow, John Greenwood and John Penry, had gone to the scaffold for offences no worse than this. Marlovians therefore contend that Marlowe would have had a strong motive for either being complicit in or agreeing to some means of escape. Most biographers concede that those accusations concerning Marlowe contained in various documents sent to the Privy Council at the time were very serious. \\"More generally, Marlowe was under suspicion because of his religious views, variously described by those who claimed to have heard them as 'monstrous', 'damnable', 'horrible' and (perhaps most to the point) 'dangerous'. Charges of atheism and heresy against him filled the air at this time; or rather, they filled certain sheets of paper.\\" It is therefore surprising that, despite the initial summons for his arrest being on 18 May, he was apparently still at liberty on 30 May to attend the Deptford meeting. Whatever the reason for this, it would have certainly given the opportunity for a faked death to be organized and carried out, if the Marlovians are right in claiming that this is what happened. =The witnesses= Marlovians suggest it is significant that every person involved in the incident seems to have been associated in one way or another either with his friend and patron Thomas Walsingham (Frizer and Skeres) or with his employers the Cecils (Poley, Bull and Danby). They point to the lengthy period (10 hours) in which the four men remained together at Eleanor Bull's house that day, and suggest this seems unnecessary if the intent had been simply to dispose of Marlowe. The most likely reason for the get- together, they say, would have been to save him in some way from the peril facing him. They claim that the faking of his death fits more of the facts as known than any other scenario.See \\"The Great Puzzle\\" on the website of the International Marlowe-Shakespeare Society. =The coroner= Support for the possible involvement of people in high places (whether it was to have Marlowe assassinated or to fake his death) has recently come to light with the discovery that the inquest was probably illegal. and Farey's Was Marlowe's Inquest Void? The inquest should have been supervised and enrolled by the local County Coroner, with the Queen's Coroner being brought in by him only if he happened to know that it was within 12 (Tudor) miles of where the Queen was in residence (i.e. that it was \\"within the verge\\") and, if so, for it to be run by both of them jointly. Marlovians argue that therefore the only way for Danby to have finished up doing it on his own‚Äîgiven that it was only just within the verge, the Court in fact some 16 of today's statute miles away by road‚Äîwould be because he knew about the killing before it actually occurred, and just \\"happened\\" to be there to take charge. If there was a deception, they say, Danby must have been involved in it and thus almost certainly with the tacit approval of the Queen. This does, of course, give as much support to David Riggs's theory that the Queen ordered Marlowe's death as it does to the faked death theory. =The body= The body was buried in an unmarked grave in the churchyard of St Nicholas, Deptford. The plaque shown here is modern. Marlovians argue that if Frizer, Poley and Skeres could lie about what happened, they could just as easily have been lying about the identity of the corpse itself. In other words, that although they claimed it was Marlowe's‚Äîand as far as we know they were the only ones there in a position to identify him‚Äîit was in fact someone else's body that the jury was called upon to examine. If a death is to be faked, however, a substitute body has to be found, and it was David A. More who first identified for Marlovians a far more likely \\"victim\\" than had been suggested earlier.See More's Drunken Sailor or Imprisoned Writer? On the evening before their 10 a.m. meeting at Deptford, at a most unusual time for a hanging, John Penry, about a year older than Marlowe, was hanged (for writing subversive literature) just two miles from Deptford, and there is no record of what happened to the body. Also of possible relevance is that the same William Danby would have been responsible for authorizing exactly what was to happen to Penry's corpse. Those who reject the theory claim that there would have been far too many obvious signs that the corpse had been hanged for it to have been used in this way, although Marlovians say that Danby, being solely in charge, would have been able quite easily to ensure that such evidence remained hidden from the jury. However, this remains a fringe view within academia. In his Shakespeare and Co., referring to the documentation concerning Marlowe's death, Stanley Wells reflects the view of virtually all scholars that Marlowe did die then when he wrote: \\"The unimpugnable documentary evidence deriving from legal documents ... makes this one of the best recorded episodes in English literary history\\" and \\"Even before these papers turned up there was ample evidence that Marlowe died a violent death in Deptford in 1593.\\" Marlowe and Shakespeare =The \\"Shakespeare\\" argument= Two Latin lines (arrow) from Ovid's Amores, which Marlowe had completely translated into English years earlier, on the title page of the first printed work of Shakespeare (1593), here reprinted in 1594 The mainstream or Stratfordian view is that the author known as \\"Shakespeare\\" was the same William Shakespeare who was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564, moved to London and became an actor, and \\"sharer\\" (part-owner) of the acting company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, which owned the Globe Theatre and the Blackfriars Theatre. In contrast, Marlovians argue that this William Shakespeare was only a \\"front\\" for the real author,In his book Marlowe's Ghost (), Daryl Pinksen draws an interesting parallel between the Marlovian scenario and the fronts used by blacklisted writers in Hollywood in the 1950s. and that any evidence supporting him as the true author can be just as easily explained by this version of events. A central plank in the Marlovian theory is that the first clear association of William Shakespeare with the works bearing his name was just 13 days after Marlowe's supposed death.It is usually claimed as a fact that Robert Greene referred to Shakespeare in his pamphlet Greene's Groatsworth of Wit, published in 1592, but Marlovians argue that it wasn't Shakespeare that Greene had meant, but the actor/manager Edward Alleyn. Shakespeare's first published work, Venus and Adonis, was registered with the Stationers' Company on 18 April 1593, with no named author, and appears to have been on sale‚Äînow with his name included‚Äîby 12 June, when a copy is first known to have been bought. Their argument remains highly contentious and no mainstream scholar of Shakespeare's life and work currently accepts it. Stanley Wells summarizes the reasons why Shakespearean scholars in general utterly reject any such idea: \\"All of this [documentary evidence of his death] compounds the initial and inherent ludicrousness of the idea that he went on to write the works of William Shakespeare while leaving not the slightest sign of his continuing existence for at least twenty years. During this period he is alleged to have produced a string of masterpieces which must be added to those he had already written, which no one in the busy and gossipy world of the theatre knew to be his, and for which he was willing to allow his Stratford contemporary to receive all the credit and to reap all the rewards.\\" =Internal evidence= Style As discussed above, this is a much- disputed area. Much has been made‚Äîparticularly by Calvin Hoffman‚Äîof so-called \\"parallelisms\\" between the two authors. For example, when Marlowe's \\"Jew of Malta\\", Barabas, sees Abigail on a balcony above him, he says An 1870 oil painting by Ford Madox Brown depicting Romeo and Juliet balcony scene > But stay! What star shines yonder in the east? > The lodestar of my life, if Abigail! Most people would immediately recognize how similar this is to Romeo's famous > But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? > It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! when she appears on the balcony above. There are many such examples, but the problem with using them as an argument is that it really is not possible to be sure whether they happened because they were by the same author, or because they were‚Äîwhether consciously or unconsciously‚Äîsimply copied by Shakespeare from Marlowe. It is worth noting, however, that Marlowe is the only contemporary dramatist from whom Shakespeare appears to 'copy' so much, \\"the abundance of Shakespeare‚Äôs quotations, echoes, and allusions [of Marlowe] is especially important because he lets his other literary contemporaries severely alone\\" and that the influence Marlowe had on Shakespeare is universally acknowledged.See http://marloweshakespeare.info/MarloweScholarship.html for a selection of relevant quotations from scholars over the years. With stylometric approaches it is possible to identify certain characteristics which are very typical of Shakespeare, such as the use of particular poetic techniques or the frequency with which various common words are used, and these have been used to argue that Marlowe could not have written Shakespeare's works. In every case so far where these data have been plotted over time, however, Marlowe's corpus has been found to fit just where Shakespeare's would have been, had he written anything before the early 1590s as all of Marlowe's were.The graphs (given as Appendices VII and VIII) in Chapter 8 of Farey's A Deception in Deptford illustrate this. On the other hand, whereas stylometry might be useful in discerning where two sets of work are not by the same person, it can be used with less confidence to show that they are. This was something that T.C. Mendenhall, whose work some Marlovians have nevertheless thought proves their theory, was at pains to point out. As for the less quantifiable differences‚Äîmainly to do with the content, and of which there are quite a lot‚ÄîMarlovians suggest that they are quite predictable, given that under their scenario Marlowe would have undergone a significant transformation of his life‚Äîwith new locations, new experiences, new learning, new interests, new friends and acquaintances, possibly a new political agenda, new paymasters, new performance spaces, new actors,Having Richard Burbage instead of Edward Alleyn as his lead actor, for example, in much the same way that Shakespeare's material for the 'Clown' changed with the departure of William Kempe and the arrival of Robert Armin. and maybe (not all agree on this) a new collaborator, Shakespeare himself. Shakespeare's Sonnets Cover of the 1609 quarto edition of the Sonnets.The current preference among Shakespearean scholars is to deny that the Sonnets are autobiographical.. For a discussion of how such approaches have changed over time, see . Marlovians say that this is because‚Äîother than the references to his name \\"Will\\" and a possible pun on \\"Hathaway\\"‚Äîthere is no connection between what is said in the Sonnets and anything that is known about Shakespeare's life. In contrast, assuming that Marlowe did survive and was exiled in disgrace, Marlovians claim that the Sonnets reflect what must have happened to him after that.Archie Webster, The National Review Vol.82, (1923), Was Marlowe the Man?, In Sonnet 25, for instance, a Marlovian interpretation would note that something unforeseen (\\"unlooked for\\") has happened to the poet, which will deny him the chance to boast of \\"public honour and proud titles\\", and which seems to have led to some enforced travel far away, possibly even overseas (26‚Äì28, 34, 50‚Äì51, 61). They would note that this going away seems to be a one-off event (48), and whatever it was, it is clearly also associated with his being \\"in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes\\", his \\"outcast state\\" (29), and his \\"blots\\" and \\"bewailed guilt\\" (36). The poet also says that he has been \\"made lame by fortune's dearest spite\\" (37). Each one of these segments, along with many other throughout the Sonnets, might be seen by a Marlovian as reflecting some aspect of Marlowe's alleged faked death and subsequent life. Marlovians also claim that their interpretation allows more of Shakespeare's actual words to be interpreted as meaning literally what they say than is otherwise possible. For example, they can take \\"a wretch's knife\\" (74) to mean a wretch's knife, rather than assume that he must have really meant Old Father Time's scythe, take an \\"outcast state\\"(29) to mean an outcast state, not just a feeling that nobody likes him, and accept that when he says his \\"name receives a brand\\" (111) it means that his reputation has been permanently damaged, and not simply that acting is considered a somewhat disreputable profession. Jonathan Bate nevertheless gives reasons for Shakespeare scholars claiming that \\"Elizabethans did not write coded autobiography\\". Clues in the plays Faked (or wrongly presumed) death, disgrace, banishment, and changed identity are of course major ingredients in Shakespeare's plays, and Stephen Greenblatt puts it fairly clearly: \\"Again and again in his plays, an unforeseen catastrophe...suddenly turns what had seemed like happy progress, prosperity, smooth sailing into disaster, terror, and loss. The loss is obviously and immediately material, but it is also, and more crushingly, a loss of identity. To wind up on an unknown shore, without one‚Äôs friends, habitual associates, familiar network‚Äîthis catastrophe is often epitomized by the deliberate alteration or disappearance of the name and, with it, the alteration or disappearance of social status.\\" Whilst noting the obvious relevance of this to their own proposed scenario Marlovians do not seek multiple parallels between Marlowe's known or predicted life and these stories, believing that the plays are so rich in plot devices that such parallels can be found with numerous individuals. On the other hand, there are some places where they point out how difficult it is to know just why something was included if it were not some sort of in-joke for those who were privy to something unknown to most of us.Hoffman and the Authorship. For example, when in The Merry Wives of Windsor (3.1) Evans is singing Marlowe's famous song \\"Come live with me...\\" to keep his spirits up, why does he mix it up with words based upon Psalm 137 \\"By the rivers of Babylon...\\", perhaps the best known song of exile ever written? And in As You Like It (3.3), Touchstone's words \\"When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a man's good wit seconded with the forward child, understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room\\", apparently referring to Marlowe's death, are puzzled over by many of Shakespeare's biographers. As Agnes Latham puts it, \\"nobody explains why Shakespeare should think that Marlowe's death by violence was material for a stage jester.\\" =External evidence= The main case against the 'faked death' theory is that, whilst there is evidence for Marlowe's death, there is no equally unequivocal counter-evidence that he survived, or did anything more than exert a considerable influence on Shakespeare.See, for example, the 'Marlowe's Ghost' chapter in Jonathan Bate's The Genius of Shakespeare (). So far the only external evidence offered has been in the form of claiming that someone who was alive after 1593 must have been Marlowe, or finding concealed messages on Shakespeare's grave, etc. Identity after 1593 Illustration for the 1916 newspaper article by Henry Watterson supporting the Marlovian theory.Various people have been suggested as having really been the Christopher Marlowe who was supposed to have died in 1593. Some examples are a Hugh Sanford, who was based with the Earl of Pembroke at Wilton House in Wiltshire and a Christopher Marlowe (alias John Matthews, or vice versa) who surfaced in Valladolid in 1602, and a Monsieur Le Doux, a spy for Essex, but working as a \\"French tutor\\" in Rutland in 1595.A.D. Wraight, Shakespeare: New Evidence (). Henry Watterson's almost certainly fictional account of an Englishman called Marlowe who died in Padua in 1627 has nevertheless triggered research by some Marlovians among the Paduan archives, without finding any confirmation so far. And if Don Foster's hypothesis is correct that the \\"begetter\\" of the Sonnets may have meant the poet himself,. then Marlovians would point out that \\"Mr. W.H.\\" might not have been a misprint, as Foster suggests, but merely showed that the identity being used by Marlowe in 1609 (including the name \\"Will\\"?) most probably had those initials too. Hidden messages Many anti-Stratfordians search for hidden messages in the form of acrostics and transposition ciphers, although this approach is not so popular with Marlovians. Peter Bull nevertheless claims to have found such a hidden message deeply concealed in the Sonnets,See Peter Bull's Research Site, and at least two Marlovians‚ÄîWilliam HoneyWilliam Honey, The Shakespeare Epitaph Deciphered (1969) and Roberta BallantineRoberta Ballantine, The Shakespeare Epitaphs‚Äîhave taken the famous four-line \\"curse\\" on Shakespeare's grave to be an anagram, however coming up with different messages. Anagrams as such are useful for conveying hidden messages, including claims of priority and authorship, having been used in this way, for example, by Galileo and Huygens;William Friedman and Elizebeth Friedman, The Shakespearean Ciphers Examined (Cambridge University Press, 1957), pp. 16‚Äì17. however, given the number of possible answers, they are really of use only if there can be some confirmation from the originator that this was the answer intended. Another method for finding hidden messages lies in interpreting passages that could be construed as ambiguous, since a favourite technique of the poet/dramatists of the time was irony, the double meaning or double entendre. For example, orthodox scholars often cite the poems in the First Folio as evidence for Shakespeare, such as Jonson's introductory poem describing the engraved portrait as having \\"hit his face\\" well, his eulogy that calls Shakespeare \\"sweet Swan of Avon\\", and Digges's line that refers to when \\"Time dissolves thy Stratford monument\\". Yet Marlovians say that those can each be interpreted in quite different ways. The \\"face\\", according to the Oxford English Dictionary (10.a) could mean an \\"outward show; assumed or factitious appearance; disguise, pretence\\". The inscription on Shakespeare's monumentWhen Jonson writes of \\"Swan of Avon\\", we may choose to take it as meaning the Avon that runs through Stratford, or we may think of Daniel's Delia, addressed to the mother of the First Folio's two dedicatees, in which he refers to the Avon in Wiltshire where they all lived: > But Avon rich in fame, though poor in waters, > Shall have my song, where Delia hath her seat. And, when Digges writes \\"And Time dissolves thy Stratford monument\\", one Marlovian argument says that it is quite reasonable to assume that he is really saying that Time will eventually \\"solve, resolve or explain\\" it (O.E.D. 12), which becomes very relevant when we see thatwhether the author intended it or notthe whole poem on Shakespeare's monument (\\"Stay Passenger...\\") may be re-interpreted as inviting us to solve a puzzle revealing who is \\"in\\" the monument \\"with\\" Shakespeare. The apparent answer turns out to be \\"Christofer Marley\\"as Marlowe is known to have spelt his own namewho, the poem would then say, with Shakespeare's death no longer has a \\"page\\" to dish up his wit.The Riddle of the Monument. The Hoffman Prize Calvin Hoffman, author of The Man Who Was Shakespeare (1955),. It was reissued in 1960 by Julian Messner, New York, as The Murder of the Man who was Shakespeare. died in 1988, still absolutely convinced that Marlowe was the true author of Shakespeare's works. Anxious that the theory should not die with him, he left a substantial sum of money with the King's School, Canterbury‚Äîwhere Marlowe went as a boy‚Äîfor them to administer an annual essay competition on this subject. The Trust Deed stipulated that the winning essay should be the one: > ...which in the opinion of the King's School most convincingly > authoritatively and informatively examines and discusses in depth the life > and works of Christopher Marlowe and the authorship of the plays and poems > now commonly attributed to William Shakespeare with particular regard to the > possibility that Christopher Marlowe wrote some or all of those poems and > plays or made some inspirational creative or compositional contributions > towards the authorship of them. (Emphasis added) The adjudication of the prize, which as of 2019 was around nine thousand pounds (UK), has always been delegated to an eminent professional Shakespearean scholar and, despite Hoffman's clear intentions, the winning essay has seldom espoused the Marlovian cause,Only four times in twenty-five years in fact. Michael Rubbo's film had a share of the prize in 2002, and in 2007 Peter Farey's Hoffman and the Authorship, an out-and-out Marlovian essay, was selected as a joint winner, as was Donna Murphy's Christopher Marlowe and the Authorship of Early English Anonymous Plays in 2010, and Dr. Ros Barber's novel-in-verse, The Marlowe Papers, in 2011. the prize having usually gone to essays along entirely orthodox lines. A further stipulation of the initial Trust Deed was that: > If in any year the person adjudged to have won the Prize has in the opinion > of The King's School furnished irrefutable and incontrovertible proof and > evidence required to satisfy the world of Shakespearian scholarship that all > the plays and poems now commonly attributed to William Shakespeare were in > fact written by Christopher Marlowe then the amount of the Prize for that > year shall be increased by assigning to the winner absolutely one half of > the capital or corpus of the entire Trust Fund... In fiction Apart from the stories by Zeigler and Watterson, others have used Marlovian theory as an inspiration for fiction as well. Rodney Bolt's History Play (2005) was inspired partly by Mark Twain's writings. It portrays Marlowe as being the true author of Shakespeare's works after staging his own death. In The Marlowe Papers (published in 2012), a novel by Ros Barber, Marlowe's \\"death\\" is a ruse, and he writes plays under the Shakespeare name. The novel is written in blank verse and won the Hoffman Prize in 2011 and the Desmond Elliott Prize in 2013. Ben Elton's 2016 sitcom Upstart Crow inverts the Marlovian theory. In the series, Shakespeare is persuaded to write plays for Marlowe (including Doctor Faustus, Tamburlaine and The Jew of Malta) in order to maintain Marlowe's cover as a playwright.

Chauncey Delos Beadle (August 5, 1866 in St. Catharines, Ontario ‚Äì 1950) was a Canadian-born botanist and horticulturist active in the southern United States. He was educated in horticulture at Ontario Agricultural College (1884) and Cornell University (1889). In 1890 the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted hired him to oversee the nursery at Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina on a temporary basis. Olmsted had been impressed by Beadle's \\"encyclopedic\\" knowledge of plants. Beadle ended up working at Biltmore for more than 60 years, until his death in 1950. He is best known for his horticultural work with azaleas, and described several species and varieties of plants from the southern Appalachian region. He and three friends, including his \\"driver and companion\\" Sylvester Owens, styled themselves the Azalea Hunters. The group traveled over the eastern United States for a period of fifteen years, studying and collecting native plants. In 1940 Beadle donated his entire collection of 3,000 plants to Biltmore Estates. He also designed the landscape at Gunston Hall, Biltmore Forest, North Carolina and Intheoaks at Black Mountain, North Carolina. Beadle wrote scientific papers describing new species and varieties of North American plants, for example, papers in the journal Biltmore Botanical Studies and his major work on the genus Crataegus (hawthorns) in John Kunkel Small's 1903 book Flora of the Southeastern United States. (See, for example, to the scientific description of Florida Mock- orange, Philadelphus floridus.) Two of his important collaborators at Biltmore were Charles Lawrence Boynton and Frank Ellis Boynton.

The name Sidi Brahim comes from a tomb located in western Algeria near the Moroccan frontier. On September 21, 1845, a detachment of men from the 8th Chasseurs d'Orl√©ans and some attached individuals fought a large force of Berber tribesmen twenty times their number near that location. The fight lasted 3 days as the French struggled to escape. In the end only a handful survived. The battle lent its name to their marching song and later to a French veterans' organization that sprung up. A couple of original buildings on Sidi Brahim Barracks A barracks named after Sidi Brahim was located just blocks from the center of √âtain. It was given this name in honor of the French Chasseurs √† pied () that were stationed there in 1913 and 1914 until shortly before the Germans arrived. In 1916 the battalion was commanded by one of the great heroes of the Battle of Verdun, Lieutenant Colonel Driant. When the German attack began they were located at Cavres near Fort Douaumont and received the first onslaught. Within days the unit was annihilated and the commander killed, but the delay helped save the French army. Their name is legend in France. The barracks was rebuilt after World War I for the French 6th military district and served in that capacity until the Germans returned in 1940. The premises were badly damaged when the U.S. 3rd Army under General Patton was pinned down here for some months in 1944 after running out of fuel nearby. They were fiercely attacked by the retreating German army and were immobilised in and around Sidi Brahim until the Battle of the Bulge three months later. For a while after the war the base was home for the French Army‚Äôs 702nd Material Company. In 1950 it was transferred to the U.S. Army and was occupied by various small units as the Cold War developed.

Camp history The work camp in Kriebethal, 2003 The camp operated from February 1941. The International Red Cross, following an inspection tour of 11-16 March 1945, reported that there were a total of 5,233 prisoners, of which 4,457 were British and Commonwealth, and 776 American. Of these only 20 POW were at the HQ in Oschatz, performing administration tasks, while the rest were assigned to 76 separate Arbeitskommando (\\"Work details\\"), working in agriculture, forestry, and industry. The Arbeitskommando varied in size from around 20 to over 100 men, who worked between 8 and 11 hours a day, 6 days a week, with only Sundays free.

According to Manusmriti, the Brahmavarta, where the Rishis composed the Vedas and other Sanskrit texts of the Vedic religion, was at the confluence of the Saraswati and Drishadwati rivers during the Vedic period. Location Although the Drishadvati is mentioned several times in Sanskrit Granthas, a detailed description of the river is not found in other ancient literature and this has generated speculation about its source and route. The Latyayana Srautasutra (10.17) describes it as a seasonal river, with the Saraswati a perennial river until its vinasana (10.15-19). The Drishadwati is mentioned in Brahmanas written primarily in the state of Brahmavarta. According to these texts, the river originated in the pot of Brahma: Pushkar Lake, near Ajmer. The Sarasvati, with four branches flowing in different directions, originated in the hills near Pushkar. Drashadwati was the branch flowing north. Most of the ashrams of the Rishis who compiled the Rigveda were on the river, between Pushkar and Dhosi Hill in Brahmavarta.Sudhir Bhargava; Saraswati-a perspective, 2009 According to the Rigveda, the Drashadwati was preferred for religious sacrifices by the Vedic people. In the Manu Smriti, the Drishadwati and the Sarasvati define the boundaries of the Vedic state of Brahmavarta:Manusmriti, Chapter 2, Shalok 17 \\"It says that the land, created by the Gods, which lies between the two divine rivers Sarasvati and Drishadvati, the (sages) call Brahmavarta.\\" The text also says that although the Sarasvati formed the northern boundary of Kuru Pradesh, the Drishadwati flowed in south of Kuru Pradesh and north of Brahmavarta. According to the Mahabharata, the southern boundary of Kuru Pradesh was Guru Drona's ashram (present-day Gurgaon at one end and Rohtak and Jhajjar at the other); therefore, the Drishadwati flowed in the southern portions of these cities. Although about 100 streams flowed south to north in the -wide Aravalli Range during the Vedic period, the only large river is the present-day Sahibi.Sudhir Bhargava, Convenor, Brahmavarta Research Foundation, Rewari, \\"Location of Brahmavarta and Drishadwati river is important to find earliest alignment of Saraswati River\\", Presentation in Seminar 'Saraswati River-a perspective', on Nov. 20-22, 2009, Kurukshetra university, Kurukshetra, pages 114-117, Seminar report, published by Saraswati Nadi Shodh Sansthan, Haryana. The Sahibi has a lower flow at present because of low rainfall in its catchment area and has a wide, dry bed which carries water from the districts of Jaipur, Sikar, Alwar Rewari, Jhajjar, Rohtak and Delhi in Yamuna. The Drishavati is mentioned in the Rigveda (RV 3.23.4) with the Sarasvati and Apaya. According to the Rigveda, the Brahmanas and the Kalpa, Vedic sacrifices were performed on this river and on the Sarasvati. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, the Drsadvati is a transcendental river. Origin The Drishadvati was identified by Oldham as the Chautang River,e.g. Keith and Macdonell. 1912. Vedic Index of Names and Subjects.; Oldham: Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 25, 58; see Amal Kar and Bimal Ghose 1984 and in 2000 Talageri identified it with the Hariyupiya and Yavyavati Rivers. In 1871 Alexander Cunningham identified the Rakshi River as the old Drishadvati and demonstrated its flow to have been from Chunar, near Varanasi. According to the Brahman Granthas, before its confluence with the Saraswati the Drishadwati flowed from the east to west. The Saraswati flowed from north to south during the Vedic period close to Aravallies, and the Drishadwati flowed from south to north through the Aravallis from Pushkar Lake in Rajasthan to Nangal Chaudhery in southern Haryana. The river then turned to reach Satnali and meet the Saraswati. After major tectonic/seismic activity in the Aravalli Range some 6500 years ago, the river Saraswati changed its course, to what is now known as Ghaggar-Hakra river bed at present times, and dried up later.Sudhir Bhargava, \\"Location of Brahmavarta and Drishadwati river is important to find earliest alignment of Saraswati river\\" Seminar, Saraswati river-a perspective, Nov. 20-22, 2009, Kurukshetra University, Kurukshetra, organised by: Saraswati Nadi Shodh Sansthan, Haryana, Seminar Report: pages 114-117 According to Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar,Namah Shivaya Shantaya, English edition, chap. 7, Ananda Marga Publications, 1982 (written under the spiritual name of P. R. Sarkar, that is, Shri Anandamurti). the Drishadwati originated in the Vindya Mountains of Baghelkhand and joined the Charmanwati. After an earthquake, it flowed north to join the Son River.

Several other pictures exist , (see below) but as they are from the early nineteenth century, more than a hundred years after the theatre had been demolished,Edward Langhans, 1965. they cannot be considered reliable sources. The Dorset Garden Theatre in London, built in 1671, was in its early years also known as the Duke of York's Theatre, or the Duke's Theatre. In 1685, King Charles II died and his brother, the Duke of York, was crowned as James II. When the Duke became King, the theatre became the Queen's Theatre in 1685, referring to James' second wife, Mary of Modena. The name remained when William III and Mary II came to the throne in 1689. It was the fourth home of the Duke's Company, one of the two patent theatre companies in Restoration London, and after 1682 continued to be used by the company's successor, the United Company. It was demolished in 1709.The London Stage (part 2), p.194, quoting The Daily Courant of 1 June 1709. By that time a new Queen's Theatre had been built (1705) in the Haymarket. Background After years of being banned during the Interregnum, theatre performances were again permitted on the Restoration of Charles II with the grant of Letters Patent to two companies to perform \\"legitimate drama\\" in London. The Duke's Company was patronised by the Duke of York (later James II); the other patent theatre company, the King's Company enjoyed the patronage of his brother, Charles II. Both companies were briefly based, from 1660, in an old Jacobean theatre, the Cockpit Theatre (also known as the Phoenix Theatre) in Drury Lane. After a short period in the Salisbury Court Theatre, the Duke's Company moved in 1662 to Lincoln's Inn Fields, to a building on Portugal Street that was formerly Lisle's Tennis Court. The company remained there until 1671. Meanwhile, the King's Company moved to the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane,then called Bridges Street theatre, as the entrance was in that street where they stayed. The founder of the Duke's Company (and Poet Laureate) Sir William Davenant, was a proponent of changeable scenery and theatrical machinery, which he is credited with introducing to the English public stage. He died before ground was broken on the new theatre in 1670, and so Dorset Garden was built under the auspices of the Davenant family who was running the Duke's Company with aid of a leading actor of the company, Thomas Betterton. The shareholders agreed to raise the funds, which ultimately amounted to some ¬£9,000. They leased a site in Dorset Garden for a period of 39 years (i.e. until 1709) at an annual rent of ¬£130.55. Just before the opening of the Dorset Garden (probably in the summer of 1671) the leading actor of the Duke's Company, Thomas Betterton, took a trip to France. It is believed that the purpose of this trip was to see the latest in French scenic technology to import it to the English stage. This assumption is largely based on the fact that Betterton, serving as William Davenant's deputy, had gone to France for that purpose at the behest of Charles II in 1661 and would go again in 1683 on the king's behalf to bring back an opera and a troupe of dancers for the court's entertainment. After Betterton's return to England in 1671 the Dorset Garden produced a number of increasingly elaborate spectacles, including operatic adaptations of Shakespeare's Macbeth (1673) and The Tempest (1674), and Thomas Shadwell's Pysche (1675). Characterizing these Restoration spectaculars was the use of changeable perspective scenery; theatrical machinery for moving scenery and flying actors and objects, instrumental and vocal music, dancing, and large casts.) The building The Duke's Theatre at Dorset Garden, on the riverfront, London's most luxurious playhouse. The theatre was built in the former grounds of Dorset House, London seat of the Sackville Earls of Dorset, which was destroyed in the Great Fire of London and was soon densely built over with speculative tenements.O. L. Brownstein, \\"New Light on the Salisbury Court Playhouse\\" Educational Theatre Journal 29.2 (May 1977:231‚Äì242) p. 232. Part of the site had been used as a theatre in the time of Charles I: in 1629 the Earl of Dorset leased the \\"stables and out howses towards the water side\\" behind Dorset House... to make a playhouse for the children of the revels.\\"Letter of Sir George Gresley to Sir Thomas Puckering, 24 October 1629, quoted in Brownstein 1977:232. The site for the new theatre, by Dorset Stairs in Whitefriars on the Thames, was slightly upstream from the outlet of the New Canal, part of the Fleet River. Its position on the Thames permitted the patrons to travel to the theatre by boat, avoiding the nearby crime-ridden neighbourhood of Alsatia. It opened on 9 November 1671 and was almost twice the size of the Duke's Company's former theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields. It became the principal playhouse in London when the Theatre Royal burned down in January 1672, soon to be rivalled however by the new Theatre Royal, which opened in March 1674. After the Duke's Company merged with the King's Company in 1682 to form the United Company, the theatre in Dorset Garden was used mainly for opera, music, and spectaculars, and from the 1690s it was also used for other entertainments, such as weight lifting,Judith Milhous, 1979, p.70. until it was demolished in 1709. Apart from the illustrations in the libretto of The Empress of Morocco, no contemporary pictures of the interior are known. The rivalry between the two companies led to descriptions of the Dorset Garden theatre in prologues and other verse of the period, thus providing us with some evidence as to what the theatre was actually like. Thomas Betterton lived in an apartment on an upper floor on the south side. A number of eminent people lived nearby: Aphra Behn in Dorset Street; John Dryden in Salisbury Square from 1673 to 1682; John Locke in Dorset Court in 1690. It is not known who designed the new theatre building, though tradition ascribes it to Sir Christopher Wren. This however seems unlikely on both practical and stylistic grounds. Perhaps Robert Hooke, an associate of Wren's had something to do with the design.Diana de Marly, 1975 The outside measurements were 147‚Äì148‚Äô by 57‚Äô, including a 10‚Äô deep porch.Morgan & Ogilby's map of London, 1677. A foreign visitor reported in 1676 that it contained a central \\"pit\\", in the form of an amphitheatre, two tiers of seven boxes each holding twenty people, and an upper gallery.Edward Langhans, 1972, quoting Fran√ßois Brunet (1676) It could accommodate approximately 850 patrons.Robert Hume, 1979, calculation based on box office receipts. The theatre represented a great investment to the Duke's Company. The interior was richly decorated: the proscenium arch had carvings by Grinling Gibbons. The stage Inside the Dorset Garden Theatre: part of the forestage with doors and balconies on both sides, the proscenium arch with the music box above it and one of the scenes for Elkanah Settle's The Empress of Morocco, performed in 1673. Settle's play included numerous spectacular stage effects. The Dorset Garden theatre had a large forestage, a typically English feature. Edward Langhans in his reconstruction calculated the forestage to be 19‚Äô6\\" feet deep and 30‚Äô6\\" wide at the proscenium arch .Edward Langhans, 1972 The forestage provided actors, singers and dancers with a sizeable downstage, a well-illuminated performance space, free of grooves. When a locale was depicted by the scenery, the forestage was understood to be an extension of that place. It served as a vital link between the audience and the performers, the auditorium and the stage, the playgoers and the play.Edward Langhans, 2000 Primary access to the forestage was by permanent proscenium doors, probably two on each side of the stage. Above the doors were balconies, acting spaces that could also serve for seating. The scenic stage was probably some 50‚Äô deep and 30‚Äô high. The proscenium arch may have been some 30‚Äô wide and at least 25‚Äô high to accommodate the scenery in operas such as Dioclesian,Frans Muller, 1993, including a reconstruction of the stage and the scenery for the final masque in Dioclesian, The Fairy-Queen,Frans & Julie Muller, 2005, including a reconstruction of the stage and the scenery for the final masque in The Fairy-Queen. or The World in the Moon. Both the forestage and the scenic stage were raked. The music box above the proscenium arch could hold perhaps 8 to 10 musicians, to provide incidental music. A full orchestra would be sitting in the pit, just in front of the stage. The Duke's Company had already been using moveable scenery to good effect in their previous playhouses. It was first employed by Davenant at Rutland House, using shutters in grooves, which could be quickly slid open or closed to reveal a new scene, but Dorset Garden was also equipped to fly at least four separate people and large objects like a cloud covering the full width of the stage and carrying a large group of musicians (Psyche 1675). There were also numerous floor traps. It was designed for staging Restoration spectaculars, and was the only playhouse in London capable of all the effects these exuberant spectacles required.

Early life and career Born in Canada in 1960 and raised in the United States, she studied classical mime with Desmond Jones in London and in 1978 joined his company, SILENTS, at that time the largest mime company in Britain. In 1979, along with Robert Pereno, LA Richards, Carole Caplin, Tim Dry and Sean Crawford (Tik and Tok), Miss Wilde formed SHOCK: a rock/mime/burlesque/music troupe. SHOCK toured with Depeche Mode and Classix Nouveaux in the early 1980s and supported Adam and the Ants at The Venue (London), Ultravox at The Rainbow Theatre (London) and Gary Numan at Wembley Arena (April 1981). SHOCK released two singles with RCA Records: 'Angel Face' and 'Dynamo Beat' produced by Richard James Burgess of Landscape. In 1986 she robotically mimed with British TV legends Morecambe and Wise in their Christmas TV Special of 1983 and appeared as a robotic mime as part of the duo Technical Glamour on The Sooty Show, the longest running children's TV program in the UK. As well as Hellbound: Hellraiser II, her other film appearances include Death Wish 3 (1985) starring Charles Bronson and Grizzly II: The Predator (1987) starring Charlie Sheen, George Clooney and Laura Dern. In the 1980s, Miss Wilde wrote and hosted 'The American Hot 100' (Skytrax TV) as well as 'The Morning Show' & 'Supersonic' for Music Box, where she interviewed Jimmy Somerville from Bronski Beat, Roger Meddows-Taylor of Queen and The Sisters of Mercy. In 1987, Miss Wilde presented a long-running music show for Granada Television called 'Hold Tight', where she interviewed such pop personalities as Cliff Richard, John Lydon (AKA Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols), Iggy Pop, The B-52's, Black, Pepsi & Shirlie and Lisa Stansfield. In 1988, she wrote and presented 'The Small Screen', a film review program for the Night Network on London Weekend Television, where she interviewed actor Hugh Grant. In the 1990s, Miss Wilde hosted a live music program, 'The Gig', for London Weekend Television and the movie history program, 'Sprockets' for Sky Digital Television. Barbie Wilde has also worked as an assistant casting director for the BBC production of The Buddha of Suburbia (1993) and as a casting director for MTV's London production of The Real World (1995). Writing Short horror stories by Barbie Wilde include 'Sister Cilice' for the anthology 'Hellbound Hearts' (Pocket Books September 2009), edited by Paul Kane and Marie O'Regan and inspired by Clive Barker's Hellraiser universe; 'U for Uranophobia' for the anthology 'Phobophobia' (Dark Continents 2011), 'American Mutant: Hands of Dominion' for 'Mutation Nation: Tales of Genetic Mishaps, Monsters, and Madness' (Rainstorm Press 2011) and 'Polyp' for 'The Mammoth Book of Body Horror' (Constable & Robinson 2012). Barbie Wilde's first dark crime novel, 'The Venus Complex', was published by Comet Press on 1 November 2012. (The cover art for 'The Venus Complex' is by award-winning artist Daniele Serra.) Wilde has been called \\"...one of the finest purveyors of erotically charged horror fiction around\\" by Fangoria Magazine, Issue No. 320. And Gabino Iglesias of Horror Talk placed 'The Venus Complex' in his Top Books of 2012, saying: \\"A novel by a female Cenobite that gives the world a smart, artistic, cynical, cultured serial killer who could give Hannibal Lecter a run for his money. On top of that, this is a poignant, funny, sexually-charged, hardcore critique of popular culture and a deconstruction of relationships, academia, and art.\\" Sources *Interview with Barbie Wilde for 3:AM Magazine *Interview with Barbie Wilde for Horror News *Interview with Barbie Wilde for That Horror Thing *Interview with Barbie Wilde for Fatally Yours *Reviews for Sister Cilice in All Things Horror, Fatally Yours, Fangoria, SFX Magazine and Darkling Tales *Interview With The Ginger Nuts of Horror *Interview with The Death Rattle *Interview with Gabriel Ricard (Drunk Monkeys Website) *Interview with The Horror Society *Interview with Fangoria's Editor-in-Chief, Chris Alexander *Author's biog on the Comet Press website External links * *The Barbie Wilde Web Site 1960 births 21st-century British novelists British female singers British film actresses British women short story writers British television actresses American emigrants to the United Kingdom Canadian emigrants to the United Kingdom British women novelists Living people 21st-century British women writers 21st-century British short story writers Canadian emigrants to the United States ","title":"Barbie Wilde"},{"id":"4995110","text":"Jim Metzler (born June 23, 1951) is an American actor, best known for guest- appearances on popular TV series.

Many forensic electrical engineering investigations apply to fires suspected to be caused by electrical failures. Forensic electrical engineers are most commonly retained by insurance companies or attorneys representing insurance companies, or by manufacturers or contractors defending themselves against subrogation by insurance companies. Other areas of investigation include accident investigation involving electrocution, and intellectual property disputes such as patent actions. Additionally, since electrical fires are most often cited as the cause for \\"suspect\\" fires an electrical engineer is often employed to evaluate the electrical equipment and systems to determine whether the cause of the fire was electrical in nature. Goals The ultimate goal of these investigations is often to determine the legal liability for a fire or other accident for purposes of insurance subrogation or an injury lawsuit. Some examples include: * Defective appliances: If a property fire was caused by an appliance which had a manufacturing or design defect (for example, a coffee maker overheating and igniting), making it unreasonably hazardous, the insurance company might attempt to collect the cost of the fire damage (\\"subrogate\\") from the manufacturer; if the fire caused personal injury or death, the injured party might also attempt an injury lawsuit against the manufacturer, in addition to the carrier of health or life insurance attempting subrogation. * Improper workmanship: If, for example, an electrician made an improper installation in a house, leading to an electrical fault and fire, he or she could likewise be the target of subrogation or an injury lawsuit (for this reason, electricians are required to carry liability insurance). * Electrical injury: If an electrical fault or unreasonably hazardous electrical system causes an electrical injury (\\"electrocution\\" if the injury is fatal), the party responsible for the electrical accident can be the target of insurance subrogation or an injury lawsuit. * Equipment failure: if electrical equipment stops functioning, it can cause a loss of income (such as a factory losing productivity due to inoperative equipment) or additional damage (such as food products spoiling due to loss of refrigeration), and again be the subject of a subrogation or liability case. Liability in such a case can also include the cost of repairing or replacing the equipment, which can be substantial. Applications Forensic electrical engineers are also involved in some arson and set-fire investigations; while it is not common for arsonists to cause electrical failures to ignite fires, the presence of electrical appliances and systems in many fires scenes often requires them to be evaluated as possible accidental causes of the fire. Some electrical means of ignition, when discovered, are fairly obvious to an origin and cause investigator and most likely do not require consulting with a forensic electrical engineer. (Note that \\"arson\\" refers specifically to a criminal act, subject to criminal prosecution; a more general term is a \\"set fire\\". A homeowner setting a fire deliberately in order to defraud an insurance company might be prosecuted for arson by a government body; however, the insurance company would concern itself only with denying the insurance claim, possibly leading to a civil lawsuit.) Patent disputes may also require the expert opinion of an electrical engineer to advise a court. Issues in conflict may include the precise meaning of technical terms, especially in the patent claims, the prior art in a particular product field and the obviousness of various patents. Liability Most states have a statute of ultimate repose (similar to, but not to be confused with, a statute of limitations) that limits the length of time after which a party can legally be held liable for their negligent act or defective product. Many states have a \\"useful life\\" statute of ultimate repose. Therefore, a determination of the length of time the product would normally be expected to be used before wearing out needs to be made. For example, a refrigerator might have a longer \\"useful life\\" than an electric fan; an airplane might have a longer useful life than a car. Some states pick an arbitrary number of years for the statute of ultimate repose. It may be short (six or seven years) or longer 15 or 25 years. If a coffee maker starts on fire after the statute of ultimate repose has expired, the manufacturer can no longer be held liable for manufacturing or design defects. The statute of ultimate repose is different from the statute of limitations. In a state with a short statute of ultimate repose, it is common that a person's right to bring a claim in court expires before their injury ever occurs. Thus, if a defective product (for example a car) caused a collision when the steering failed, but the collision occurred after the expiration of a statute of ultimate repose, no claim could be brought against the manufacturer for selling a defective product. The right to bring the claim expired before the claim even occurred.

Scripted instruction has often been advocated for schools where teachers have had inadequate teacher training and is also seen as way to standardize the quality of instruction. Critics say that such programs stifle teachers' creativity, undermine teachers' expertise, and fail to provide for the diverse needs of many classrooms. Advocates see it as the easiest way to provide teachers with the essential elements of effective reading instruction. Scripted instruction has also been applied to preparation of lessons in many other subject matter areas. One widely used program using scripts is the Success for All reading instruction program. Scripted instruction has been an integral part of the direct instruction (DI) approach to education which has been presented as a structured alternative to the constructionist approaches to teaching such as discovery learning. There is extensive additional information on scripted teaching available on the International Reading Association website.  Scripted Teaching  = Meaning of Scripted Teaching = Scripted teaching can be traced back as far as 1888 where Samuel and Adeline Monroe published text for teachers that provided them with scripts for teaching reading readiness, phonics, and oral reading (Commeyras 2007). In this method of teaching, the teacher is expected to read the lesson scripts verbatim. It is a form of direct instruction meant to guide teachers in order to sustain consistency in teaching strategies by teachers. It also hopes to eliminate the risk of poor instruction by inexperienced teachers (Lee). Its purpose of strict adherence to the script is targeted more towards schools with low standardized test scores so that the concepts being taught can be delivered in a consistent manner, in hopes that the students will understand the lessons more clearly. This strategy is becoming more prevalent in US school districts, as well as schools throughout the world (Reeves 2010). = The Goal of Scripted Teaching = Many school districts are moving to scripted teaching programs with a goal of improving students‚Äô standardized test scores. With more pressure being put on teachers to have their students achieve higher standardized test scores, teachers are looking to use scripted teaching programs as an aid to teach these concepts to their students, hoping that it will be a more effective way of teaching (Guccione 2011). Scripts designed for teaching curriculum are not meant to eliminate the amount of teacher preparation, but are to be used as a scaffold for teachers to adhere to the topics and skills required of students. When used properly, scripted teaching programs are used as a tool that teachers can add and subtract parts of the structure to create a learning environment that facilitates appropriate instruction individualized to the needs of their learners (Guccione 2011). Hundreds of schools could be using the same scripted curriculum; however, if used appropriately, their lessons will be carried out differently as a reflection of the diverse learners in their respective classrooms. The goal is that all of the students will learn the same concepts and be able to use the knowledge that comes from the scripted lessons. = Behaviorist Learning Theory = Scripted teaching is influenced by behaviorist learning theory (Reeves 2010). It uses repetition as a way to reinforce the concepts that students are learning. Some scripted learning programs (for example, Language for Learning) go through an error correction process when a student answers a question incorrectly. Using a behavioral approach to teaching and learning, micro skills such as spelling are practiced meticulously and are perfected before moving onto macro skills such as writing or reading longer passages (Reeves 2010). = Critiques = A common critique about scripted teaching presumes that any person can come into a classroom and teach a lesson if they follow the script (Commeyras 2007). However, proponents of scripted teaching maintain that just like an actor brings life to his script, a teacher can and must use his own personality to breathe life into the teaching script (Commeyras 2007). Scripted teaching programs are meant to be used as a support for teachers to help them develop their own teaching style and confidence in their teaching ability (Reeves 2010). Teachers who are first introduced to scripted teaching tend to feel that they are being held back from utilizing their own knowledge when they are required to instruct using an external script (Reeves 2010). This also leads to teachers feeling that they cannot respond when a student answers with an unusual answer (Parks & Bridges-Rhoads 2012); however, teachers who are experienced in scripted teaching find a way to build on the unusual answers and find their way back to the script. Teachers who have learned that reading written language involves accuracy, fluency, self-monitoring, and comprehension are more successful at scripted teaching (Commeyras 2007). A final critique is that scripted teaching de-professionalizes teachers, stifling their creative potential (Reeves 2010). = References = Commeyras, M. (2007, January). Scripted reading instruction?

They particularly praised the ability to create one's own robot and save it to memory card, the winner's claiming of one of their opponent's arms as a prize, and the generally fun quality of the gameplay.

Baggara of Sudan: Culture and Environment, Amazon online Books. Baggara of Sudan: Culture and Environment Their language is the Sudanese Arabic. Numbering over one million, the Baggara are the second largest ethnic group in Western Sudan, extending into Eastern Chad. They are primarily nomadic cattle herders and their journeys are dependent upon the seasons of the year. The use of the term Baggara carries negative connotations as slave raiders, so they prefer to be called instead Messiria.  Geography of Messiria Country (Dar Al Messiria)  This photo was taken during the early 20th century but could equally well be modern. The Baggara in general and the Messiria in particular still frequently travel on ox-back. The term Dar means land or location. The word Al or al and sometimes El or el corresponds to the definite article The in English. The term Dar Al Messiria means the land or location of the Messiria. According to Ian Cunnison 1966,Ian Cunnison, 1966, Baggara Arabs, Power and the lineage in a Sudanese Nomad Tribe, Clarendon Press, Oxford, pages: 1‚Äì3 the Arab nomads of the Sudan and Chad republics are of two kinds: camelmen (called Abbala) and cattlemen (called Baggara).Richard Crockett. 2010.Yale University Press. Sudan. Darfur and the failure of an African state. the Term Baggara means simply cowman but the Sudanese apply the word particularly to the nomadic cattlemen, who span the belt of savanna between Lake Chad and the White Nile. This belt of territory has. been the homeland of the Baggara people for centuries. Ian Cunnison, referenced above said \\"History and environment together throw light on their distribution\\". In Sudan, while the Abbala live in the semi-desert part of the region: northern Kordofan and Darfur, the Baggara, by contrast, live on their southern fringes; occupying the area roughly south of 12 degrees north and extending well into flood basins of the White Nile to the south. In general the Dar Al Messiria or their zones can be divided into three areas: 1.1. Dar Al Messiria in Kordofan, Sudan. 1.2. Dar Al Messiria in Darfur, Sudan. 1.3. Dar Al Messiria in Chad. The Messiria in the three different zones have been separated for so long that they have developed localized cultural and social differences. The Messiria in Kordofan know little if anything about the Messiria in Dar Fur and Chad, but they belong to the same tribe and they have similar subtribal divisions and diversities. =Dar Al Messiria in Kordofan, Sudan= In Kordofan, the Messiria occupies the area historically known as West Kordofan, among their well known locations are: Abyei, Babanousa, El Muglad, Lagawa, El Mairam, and Lake Kailak.  Messiria Divisions in Kordofan  The main divisions of Messiria in Kordofan are Messiria Zurug; literally the name means The dark ones and Messiria Humr; means The red ones. These names: Zurug and Humr do not mean in any way that the Zurug are darker in skin color than Humr, but most likely the Humr are darker than Zurug ones. According to MacMichael, 1967:Harold Alfred MacMichael, 1967, The Tribes of Northern and Central Kordof√°n, Published by Cass, , , 260 pages. The two divisions have become so distinct that the Humr have ceased to rate themselves Messiria. However, in Sudan today, still they are called Messiria Humr and Messiria Zurug and still they acknowledge their common history and ancestry. The Messiria Humr pastoralists migrate across the four regions of their homeland (\\"Dar el Humr‚Äú): Babanusa, Muglad, Goz and Bahr el Arab. *Messiria Zurug ‚Äì According to MacMichael, 1967 the Messiria Zurug have the following divisions: A ‚Äì Awl√°d Um S√°lim B ‚Äì El Ghaz√°ya C ‚Äì El Dir√°wi D ‚Äì El Enen√°t E ‚Äì Awl√° Abu Na'am√°n F ‚Äì El Zurug G ‚Äì Awl√°d Hayb√°n Still there subtribal divisions with each subtribes. *Messiria Humr ‚Äì According to Ian Cunnison, 1966: The Humr are divided into: A ‚Äî'Ajaira: 1\\\\.

Second Sudanese Civil War: 1983‚Äì2005 = Background of the conflict = The Misseriyya mostly live around Kordofan and migrate south into the Dinka territory. They are marginally represented in Darfur and there they live a semi-sedentary life. The Misseriyya was once a larger group, but fragmented into smaller groups over time.Flint, J. and Alex de Waal, 2008 (2nd Edn), Darfur: A new History of a Long War, Zed Books. The location of Messiria of Kordofan is at the border zone between Sudan and Southern Sudan, specially the southern Fringes of their nomadic zone. The Abyei area is claimed by Messira as well as by Ngok Dinka, to be theirs. While the Messiria are Baggara Arabs, Sunni Muslims and identified as Northerners, on the other hand, Ngok Dinka are Southerners and identified as Africans either Christians or Animists. The Messiria historians tell that, one of their grand parents named sheikh Abu Nafisa his burial is found far southern of present Abyei town and he had died around the early 1770s. Henderson, MacMichael and Ian Cunnison all attest the presence of Messiria in the eighteenth century. Similar history is also available for the nine Ngok Dinka chiefdoms on the same area. Being both nomads, The Messiria and Dinka coexisted for long time and shared the grazing resources. Those Messiria who have most contact with Ngok Dinka are the Messiria Humr. The Messiria Zurug share most of their land with the Nuba tribes, along the western sides of the national highway connecting Deling city to Kadugli; the capital city of South Kordofan and extending to Talodi city. On the eastern side of this national highway found the Hawazma tribes sharing the land also with the Nuba tribes. The Nuba are indigenous Africans inhabiting the area known as Nuba Mountains of Southern Kordofan and mostly Sunni Muslims. Both Nuba and Dinka are sided with Southern Rebels (SPLA/SPLM) during the civil war, while Messiria and Hawazma sided with Sudanese Government. = Historical grazing disputes = During the dry season the Misseriya migrate to the river Kiir in Abyei. They call the region the Bahr Al Arab. Both branches of Messiria, the Humr and the Zurug, are involved in historical grazing disputes and isolated fights along their southern borders, either with Dinka,Richard Crockett 2010.Yale University Press Sudan Darfur and the Failure of an African State pp.112-113. Nuer or Nuba over grazing and water resources. The traditional fighting was intensified during the first Southern guerrilla‚Äôs fighting, called Anyanya,Richard Crockett 2010.Yale University Press Sudan Darfur and the Failure of an African State p. 45 (also spelled Anya-Nya, a term for snake poison) in 1964 when a whole Messiria nomad camp around lake Abyyad was massacred in a terrible human slaughter by Anyanya fighters, none were spared including children, elderly and brides; many Messiria were abducted and women were raped by the rebels. The Messiria retaliated with a sequence of attacks targeting Southern villages and nomadic camps; they abducted children and raided cattle. At the time, the abductions and retaliations became the norm in the region, but, mostly children and cattle were retrieved by local authorities and the spirit and will of coexistence always prevailed. Such targeting of Anyanya fighters on Messiria nomads lead to Messiria starting to accumulate weaponry to counterbalance the rebel fighters' force. Earlier incidents in the early eighteenth century during British rule, had led to both Hawazma and Messiria taking up arms. In around 1908, the British armed the Nuba to fight against the expansion of the Northern Arabs in the region. Weapons, known locally as Marmatoun and Ab‚Äôgikra, were as common among Nuba as AK-47 among Baggara Arabs today. All these indicate that the ingredients of ethnic war already exist in the region and the new SPLA war was just an ignition of an existing ethnic chasm in the area. In Abyei the Dinka Ngok and Misseryia are engaged in territorial disputes. =The Civil War= See the Civil War under Hawazma. The Messiria are the first Northern tribes and the first Baggara tribes to suffer from the Southern war. The Sudanese government gave the Misseriya Arab militia machine guns and ordered them to drive the Nilotic peoples from the Western Upper Nile oil region. They successfully took the Luk Nuer in Bentiu and Eastern Jikany Nuer in 1984.Richard Crockett 2010.Yale University Press Sudan Darfur and the Failure of an African State References Baggara tribes ","title":"Messiria tribe"},{"id":"4995253","text":"Edward Cary Walthall (April 4, 1831April 21, 1898) was a general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War and a postbellum United States Senator from Mississippi.

Normal human hearing is recognised as having an upper bound of 15‚Äì28 kHz, depending on the person. Ultrasonic sinusoids as high as 120 kHz have been reported as successfully perceived. Two competing theories are proposed to explain this effect. The first asserts that ultrasonic sounds excite the inner hair cells of the cochlea basal turn, which are responsive to high frequency sounds. The second proposes that ultrasonic signals resonate the brain and are modulated down to frequencies that the cochlea can then detect. Researchers Tsutomu Oohashi et al. have coined the term hypersonic effect to describe the results of their controversial study supporting audibility of ultrasonics.T. Oohashi, E. Nishina, M.

First point on the list demands re-legalization of the NZS. Independent Students' Association (, NZS) is a Polish student society, created in October 1980, in the aftermath of the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement and the anti-government strike actions (see: History of Solidarity). It was a student arm, or suborganization, of Solidarity, and together with it, as well as other similar organizations, was banned after the martial law in Poland, (December 13, 1981). Some activists were arrested, and others organized an underground NZS. After the fall of Communism in 1989, the organization was recreated, and its focus was changed from political to cultural, although it still stands by its origins, as seen by Polish students‚Äô support for the Orange Revolution in Ukraine. It now is the largest independent student organization in Poland, with 90 chapters at Polish universities and a total of 20,000 members.  Beginnings  The first meeting of students demanding independent Association took place on August 27, 1980 in Gda≈Ñsk. On September 2, the Temporary Founding Committee of the University of Gda≈Ñsk was created, followed by similar bodies in other Polish cities, such as Warsaw, Pozna≈Ñ, and Krak√≥w. Between 18 and 19 October 1980, at the Warsaw University of Technology, a founding meeting of a newly-created student organization took place, with 60 chapters, representing different Polish universities and colleges. At this point, the name Independent Students‚Äô Association was approved. There were other suggestions for the name, such as Solidarity of the Association of Polish Students, but they were not popular. During the meeting, it was decided that the NZS would be seated in Warsaw, and the National Founding Committee was established, with eleven members (among them Maciej Kuro≈Ñ, and Piotr Bikont). The NZS associated itself with the late 1970s organization, Student Committee of Solidarity, created in 1977, following the murder of Stanis≈Çaw Pyjas. In 1980, the Association may have been viewed as a student equivalent of Solidarity, as it was created following the strikes of the so-called Polish August 1980. It led to the gathering of young people who wished to organize themselves independently of the Communist regime. They called for democratization of Polish universities, as well as respect for the Polish patriotic traditions of fighting for independence. The NZS was an alternative to the official Polish Students' Association (ZSP), which was subordinated to the Polish United Workers' Party.  Legalization  The first request for legalization of the NZS was presented in the Provincial Court in Warsaw on October 20, 1980, but the Justice refused. On November 13, the Warsaw Court stated that only laborers were entitled to create trade unions. In response, strikes and protests were organized throughout the fall of 1980 and winter of 1980-1981, with the most extensive taking place at the University of Pozna≈Ñ (November 1980), and the University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ (January - February 1981). Among those who took part in the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ strikes was an international soccer player, Stanis≈Çaw Terlecki, who used his connections to get food for students. Desperate students of the Warsaw University began to occupy the college in late November 1980, but due to the mediation of rector Henryk Samsonowicz, the protest was terminated. = 1981 strikes in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ = On January 11, 1981, students of the Mathematics - Physics - Chemistry Department of the University of ≈Å√≥d≈∫ began a strike, which on January 21 spread across the whole college. According to NZS sources, it was the longest occupational strike of students in the history of Europe, with 10 000 students participating. On February 9, University of Pozna≈Ñ joined their ≈Å√≥d≈∫ colleagues, declaring a solidarity strike. On February 17, 1981, the government accepted registration of the Association, under the condition that it would abide by the Constitution. The following day, the strikes in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ended. The government pledged to grant more autonomy to the students and agreed that the students would no longer be obliged to study the Russian language. Another concession was the elimination of compulsory Marxist- Leninist courses. The Government's decision to register the association was met by ≈Å√≥d≈∫ student's applause. The students stood up and sang the Polish national anthem. The ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Agreement is still regarded as the student equivalent of the Gda≈Ñsk Agreement. Furthermore, the student strikes in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ were mentioned by the Communist services as one of reasons for establishing the law.  Period of independence  Between 3‚Äì6 April 1981, at Krak√≥w's Pedagogical University, the First Meeting of NZS Delegates took place. It gathered 240 activists from 66 Polish colleges and universities (out of 89 such schools existing then nationwide). The National Coordinating Commission was elected, and the first chairman of the NZS was Jagiellonian University's Jaros≈Çaw Guzy. Statutes of the Association were written by a young student of law, Jan Maria Rokita. The Association quickly grew, reaching by May 1981 some 80 000 members. Its Coordinating Commission was planning to open an independent students‚Äô magazine, but the government refused, explaining that there was \\"lack of paper\\". NZS was a very active association, which organized meetings with key members of the opposition movement (such as Adam Michnik, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, Jacek Kuro≈Ñ). Furthermore, the Association was deeply engaged in political actions. On May 25, 1981, in several Polish cities, the students organized street marches in defence of political prisoners. In November 1981, 55 000 students of 81 Polish colleges declared a general strike to demand the ouster of a newly appointed rector at the Radom Engineering School. In late November and early December 1981, another important event took place. On November 25, students of Warsaw's School of Fire Service Officers went on strike to protest their college's being subjected directly to the Ministry of Interior and Administration versus the Higher Education Bill. The cadets demanded both an exemption from police duties, and academic rights.  Banning and re-establishment  Polish students did not enjoy their freedom for long. Following the martial law in Poland, the Association was banned on February 5, 1981, and many of its activists were arrested. The NZS was still active in the underground, especially in large population centers, such as Warsaw, Wroc≈Çaw and Krak√≥w. Some of its members, such as Teodor Klincewicz from Warsaw, were actively involved in various forms of anti-government protests. Also, students of the Law Department at ≈Å√≥d≈∫ University, in opposition to martial law, organized a sit-in, which was brutally broken by the riot police. Another strike was broken at Krak√≥w's Pedagogical University. At some point in the mid-1980s, the Association began cooperation with high-school students organization Federation of Fighting Youth. The NZS, which in the years 1984-1985 was in the decline, began to flourish, beginning in 1986, when a new generation of students replaced the old. The number of self-published magazines grew, new chapters were created, and finally, in September 1988, during the Third Meeting of NZS Delegates in Gda≈Ñsk, new leaders were elected. Soon afterwards, the Registration Committees were opened across the nation, and thousands of students joined the Association. During the round table talks, it was agreed that the NZS would be re-registered. However, the government did not keep this promise. This resulted in the creation of the National Student Strike Committee, which consisted of: Tomasz Ziemi≈Ñski, Mariusz Kami≈Ñski, Przemys≈Çaw Gosiewski, P. Nycz, W. Kili≈Ñski, S≈Çawomir Skrzypek, R. Kosiorek, Grzegorz Schetyna, B. Pichur, Artur Olszewski, Igor W√≥jcik, P. Janiszewski, A. Jasionowski, K. Zemler, R. Bitner, A. Szczepkowski i P. Swaczyna. As Lech Kaczy≈Ñski later recalled, the Communists did not want to give up their monopoly of youth organizations. Most Polish colleges began a sit-in, and in Krak√≥w, street fights erupted. During the historic semi-free June 1989 elections, the NZS actively helped Solidarity candidates. The Association was re-legalized on September 22, 1989, when Poland was already ruled by the oppositional government of Tadeusz Mazowiecki. In the 1990s, NZS limited its political activities, concentrating on cultural events, as well as entertainment. Across the years, NZS total membership has been around 180 000. Several of its activists are now public figures - politicians, journalists, businessmen, artists. Among the most prominent are Donald Tusk, Grzegorz Schetyna, Waldemar Pawlak, Cezary Grabarczyk, Bogdan Zdrojewski, Maciej P≈Ça≈ºy≈Ñski, Marek Jurek, W≈Çodzimierz Julian Korab-Karpowicz, Jan Maria Rokita, Maciej Kuro≈Ñ, Bronis≈Çaw Wildstein, Marcin Meller, Pawe≈Ç Piskorski, Adam Bielan, Tadeusz Nowicki.

President Park Chung-hee restored the Government-General Building from 1962 for government functions until the early 1980s and housed the National Museum of South Korea from 1986. The Government-General Building was controversially planned for demolition in 1993, long felt to be a symbol of Japanese imperialism and impeding reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung, and was demolished from 1995 to 1996. History =Japanese Korea= In 1910, Japanese rule in Korea began when the Empire of Japan formally annexed the Korean Empire in the Japan‚ÄìKorea Annexation Treaty, ending over 500 years of Joseon rule and losing its sovereignty after five years of indirect Japanese rule as a protectorate. The Japanese established the Korean capital city of Hanseong (Seoul) as the colonial capital of Japanese Korea, renaming it to Keij≈ç in Japanese and Gyeongseong in Korean. In 1911, the Japanese decided to erect a new building in Seoul to house the new colonial administration under the Governor-General of Korea. The Government-General Building was designed by architect Georg De Lalande in the Neoclassical style popular in Japan at the time. The new structure was a grey granite building with a copperplate dome. De Lalande, who was German and had lived in Japan since 1901, had designed numerous administrative buildings there until he died in 1914, and was succeeded on the project by Japanese architect Nomura Ichiro. Construction of the Government- General Building began on 25 June 1916 inside the grounds of the Gyeongbokgung Palace, the former royal palace complex of the Joseon dynasty, located north of central Seoul. The location was chosen to deliberately obstruct the view of Gyeongbokgung from central Seoul and to legimitize Japanese colonial rule. All but 10 of the 400 Gyeongbokgung palace buildings were demolished to make way for the construction of the Government-General Building and its grounds, and further demolitions were prevented only by a campaign by Japanese intellectual Muneyoshi Yanagi The Government-General Building was officially completed ten years later on 1 October 1926, and the office of the Governor-General was transferred there. =Korean independence= President Syngman Rhee is sworn- in at a ceremony in front of the former colonial headquarters on 24 July 1948. Japanese rule in Korea ended upon the Surrender of Japan in August 1945 and the United States occupied the territory of Korea south of the 38th parallel (including Seoul) where the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK) was established. The US occupation government renamed the Government-General Building to Capitol Hall and it became internationally known as the Seoul Capitol. On 31 May 1948, the Government-General Building became the seat of South Korea's constitutional assembly, the precursor to the National Assembly of South Korea. On 24 July, the swearing in ceremony of Syngman Rhee as the first President of South Korea was held in front of the Government-General Building. On 15 August, the inauguration of the First Republic of Korea (South Korea) occurred at the Government-General Building following the official transfer of power from the USAMGIK to the Government of South Korea, becoming the first seat of National Assembly, and was occupied by a variety of government offices. The Japanese Governor-General's office became the Prime Minister's office. The Government-General Building was heavily damaged following the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, when the forces of North Korea invaded South Korea across the 38th parallel, and the Korean People's Army briefly occupied the building as an army headquarters until United Nations forces recaptured Seoul in September 1950. The North Koreans set fire to the Government-General Building upon their retreat, completely destroying the interior, and it was left abandoned and in a ruinous state, even after the war ended in 1953. The nationalistic President Rhee refused either to repair the building or reoccupy it, as its ruinous state was partly symbolic of the end of the Japanese occupation, but started using the remaining outdoor space as an outdoor music hall. The Government-General Building was survived to enjoy two more decades as the seat of government following Park Chung Hee's 1961 May 16 coup, establishing the Supreme Council of National Reconstruction military government. On 22 November 1962, General Park carried out extensive repair and refurbishing work on the derelict Government-General Building to use it as much-needed offices for the central government. As a witness to the major political and social upheavals of modern Korean history, the building housed government offices including that of the Prime Minister, until early 1980s when new quarters were constructed nearby. In 1968, the Western-style front gate was demolished for the reconstruction of Gwanghwamun, the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. In 1970, many government offices were moved to the newly constructed Central Government Complex located adjacent to the Government-General Building. On 25 May 1981, President Chun Doo-hwan gave instruction to move the National Museum of Korea to the Government-General Building. In 1982, the South Korean Government announced a moving plan to the people of Korea, and the project begun. After the last State Council meeting was held there on 19 May 1983, it underwent a period of refurbishment, reopening in August 1986 as the National Museum of Korea. =Demolition= The issue of the Government-General Building's future was opened after Kim Young-sam became president in 1993. In August of that year, President Kim announced that it would be demolished beginning in 1995, the 50th anniversary of the end of Japanese colonial rule and the 600th anniversary of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Plans were announced for a new National Museum to be built on the site. The Government-General Building had been subject to calls for demolition since the presidency of Syngman, almost immediately after the end of Japanese colonial rule. The Government-General Building's demolition proposal was controversial in South Korea and there was intense public debate on the issue. President Kim and proponents of the demolition argued that the building was a symbol of Japanese imperialism that had been built deliberately to deface Gyeongbokgung Palace. Opponents of the demolition countered that South Korea, now a wealthy nation, was no longer troubled by such symbolism and that reminders of the colonial era were needed. Many opposed the demolition on the grounds of the expense incurred and the architectural merit of the existing building, as other Japanese colonial-era buildings in Seoul, such as the old Seoul Station and Seoul Metropolitan Library, are considered landmarks of the city. Additionally, the building itself was the site of important events such as the declaration of independence of the Republic of Korea. A proposal was made to move the Government-General Building to a new site, although this would have been far more expensive than demolition. Nevertheless, demolition began on South Korea's Liberation Day (Gwangbokjeol) on 15 August 1995, with the removal of the dome. On 13 November 1996, the building was completely demolished. Today, the top of the dome and several other recognizable pieces of the building can be seen at the Independence Hall Museum in Cheonan, as part of a monument to commemorate the history behind the building and its demolition.

By producing a software-compatible system, the intention was to reduce time and cost to develop software. However, the lengthy process of developing manufacturing capability meant that the system was soon outpaced by systems from other vendors. Only a few systems were sold during its 5 years of production. Due to the consolidation of the British computer industry, English Electric's computer division became one of the components of what would become ICL. Background During the late 1950s English Electric embarked on two major computer projects. Firstly, English Electric built a version of the RCA 501 computer which was known as the KDP10 (KDP for Kidsgrove Data Processing). This was a machine intended for commercial data processing applications, with fixed length instructions, and capabilities for processing variable-length numeric and alpha-numeric data. RCA's original design was adapted to use the types of transistors, diodes and other components manufactured in the UK. The KDP10 was first delivered in 1961. In 1964 it was re-designated as the KDF8 and sales continued to 1965. Simon Hugh Lavington, Early British Computers: The Story of Vintage Computers and the People who Built Them, Manchester University Press, 1980 page 76 The machine was essentially the same as the RCA 501 and manufactured under license so that English Electric could offer a full range of computer systems for all its customers, without the expense of developing an entirely new machine. The machine sold for ¬£400,000. Only 13 were sold. B. Jack Copeland (ed.) , Alan Turing's Electronic Brain: The Struggle to Build the ACE, the World's Fastest Computer, OUP Oxford, 2012, , pp. 166-168A. Gandy,The Early Computer Industry: Limitations of Scale and Scope, Springer, 2012, , pp. 196-198 The second large computer to emerge from development work at Kidsgrove was the KDF9, primarily designed for scientific work. One KDF8 was installed at the Kidsgrove (Staffordshire) site of The English Electric Company's computer bureau. Over the years, and a succession of mergers, this organisation became English Electric Leo Marconi (EELM), International Computing Services Limited (ICSL), and finally under a joint arrangement between ICL and Barclay's Bank, Baric. Basic features = Processor/main store = KDF8 was a transistor based machine with magnetic core memory. The core memory of the machine installed at the Kidsgrove computer bureau was upgraded from 64k to the then maximum of 96k of core memory. KDF8 used an octal (base eight) addressing system. A machine-code instruction was fixed length, ten octal characters long. The instruction set was specifically designed for commercial use. It had machine-code level instructions for all four of the decimal arithmetic functions operating on variable length numbers, and also had instructions for efficient manipulation of variable-length data-strings. Not all instructions required all ten characters. Given the minimal core memory available, programmers frequently used \\"spare\\" characters in instructions for storage of constants and similar storage-saving tricks. KDF8 was strictly a batch processing computer, running one program at a time. Only one compute instruction could be processed at one time, but it was also possible to have one read and/or one write instruction (typically from and to magnetic tape) executing in parallel. A system of hardware \\"gates\\" set and checked at machine code level were used to control the degree of synchronous operation. However, since there was no operating system of any kind, this had to be controlled entirely at the individual program level. The KDP10 in the service bureau was updated in situ, as the system was built with RCA germanium transistors. Part of the update was to convert the main logic to silicon transistors. There was also a three character address adder added, and the machine cycle was 15 microseconds, with six timing pulses, where sixth pulse was for settling time, thus the machine cycle was reduced to 12.5 microseconds. The level of programmer skill to control full read/write/compute overlap, especially if data records were \\"batched\\" several to the \\"real\\" block of data on magnetic tape, was considerable, since all simultaneity checks had to be hand-coded into the program. Automatic error-detection was essentially limited to hardware parity checks at the character level, and there were no processor hardware checks on what the programmer could do. For example, the computer would simply stop if instructed to access a memory location beyond physical memory. =Peripherals= There were no magnetic disks, drums or other similar temporary backing-storage devices. Bulk storage was limited to magnetic tapes, on open reels, each reel of which was about one inch thick and nine inches (229 mm) across, holding a maximum of of tape. Data and programs were kept on these tapes. Peripheral error-checking was again limited to parity checks on all reads and writes and the use of write permit rings. The Kidsgrove KDF8 had eight magnetic tape units on-line, each rated at 40k characters per second read/write speed. Each tape unit was about tall and wide, and the processor and memory cabinets were about the same in size and number. The Kidsgrove configuration required a large air-conditioned room. Eight was considered the working maximum number of tape units, one per channel, for any actual KDF8 configuration. It was possible for each tape channel to be split through additional hardware units into a sub-group of eight tape decks, giving a theoretical maximum of 61 on-line tape units. (Tt least three uniquely coded I/O channel identifiers were required for other devices.) Other tape unit/printer pairs were available, able to operate independently of the mainframe. These provided an off-line printing facility for volume output, freeing the KDF8 to run other work. Other peripherals included: * a paper-tape reader (1000cps) for data and (initial) program input, * an operator's teleprinter device (with a slow paper tape punch built-in) permitting programs to display information to the operator, and the operator to use the keyboard to punch up short program or data items on paper-tape. This teleprinter could not be used to input data directly to the computer, all operator commands had to be input through the operator's console. * an on-line printer, used mainly for core dumps of failed programs. Both on and off-line printers were impact printers, capable of printing a line of either 120 or 160 characters, depending on the model They were single type-face, no lower case. Fan fold paper for the printers was continuous, with perforations between the pages, and sprocket-holes at each side of the paper for the paper-feed mechanism. Custom paper sizes, with pre-printed lines/text/colours etc. were common, especially for applications like payroll, and small paper-tape control loops were needed to match page-throw size to each paper type. Instruction Set Each KDF8 machine-code instruction took the format OO AAA RR BBB In this representation OO represents a two-(octal) character operation code, identifying the instruction to be performed, in the range 00 to 77, AAA represents a six-(octal) character \\"A\\" core address ranging from 000000 to 777777. (A theoretical Meg directly addressable main store, an actual 96K!) RR represents a two-character Register setting (one character for each of two possible registers numbered 1 to 7 used to modify the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" addresses, with 0 indicating no register modification) and BBB represents the \\"B\\" address, the same as the \\"A\\" address in format. Instructions were read in turn from main store into registers, then executed. Example. An instruction to read data from the on-line paper-tape reader to locations starting at store location (octal) 200000 would look like 14 200000 00 770000 (spaces for clarity only) Where 14 was the operation code for this type of read, 200000 was the lowest store location the data would be read to, 00 indicates that no register modification was to be done to the A or B addresses of the instruction, and 77 was the (fixed) device identifier of the paper tape reader. (Note - 77 used as a device ID for a write operation would direct the write to the operator's teleprinter. Embarrassing if this was due to a program error, and it was a large data block intended for mag tape.....) The last four octal characters (0000) were not required in this instruction, and would be ignored when the instruction was processed. Such \\"spare\\" characters were frequently, given the extremely limited main store available used by programmers to store constants. Some aspects of the instruction set were advanced, and greatly eased programming of commercial systems. The operation codes 51-54 did decimal arithmetic Add, Subtract, Multiply and Divide on variable length numbers, stored as decimal characters. One end of each operand was stored at the \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" addresses of the instruction. The other end was identified by an ISS (Item Separator Symbol), octal 74. Thus numbers could be any length. A \\"Sector Compare\\" instruction (Octal 43) permitted three-way conditional branching of program control depending on whether the data stored in the range from the \\"A\\" address to the \\"B\\" address was greater, less than, or equal to, the value of the same number of characters stored at locations to the left of the (previously set) \\"T\\" register, as the following Assembler language version attempts to demonstrate. Tag Op A-Address RR B-Address COMPARE SET ¬£T SALARY,R SC TAXLIMIT TAXLIMIT,R CTC BELOWTAXLIMIT ABOVETAXLIMIT EQUAL TC EQUALTAXLIMIT This example compares a salary with a tax limit, and jumps to one of three program locations depending on the respective values. The \\",R\\" Assembler convention represents the rightmost character of the named field. CTC stood for \\"Conditional Transfer of Control\\" and TC for (unconditional) Transfer of Control In the above \\"compare\\" code, the original (KDP10?) instruction set compared from right to left, requiring the whole length of the data strings to be compared, a character at a time. KDP8 was enhanced to compare from left to right, so the comparison could stop as soon as the relative values were clear, speeding up processing of such instructions considerably. Variable length data was handled with the aid of specially designated characters. The ISS or Item Separator Symbol, octal 74, usually represented as \\"‚óè\\" was used to separate variable length data fields. Octal 75 \\"<\\" and 76 \\">\\" identified the start and end of a data message, Octal 777777 was by custom and practice used to identify End of File. So data such as names and addresses could be punched onto paper tape for data input as (for example) Various instructions could operate directly on this variable length data, and records could be batched say ten to the batch onto magnetic tape, for efficient storage. Given the relatively slow (by today's standards) processor and I/O rates, a significant aspect of the programmer's task was to balance the batching of data on tape, with the computing needed per record and organise the simultaneous I/O and compute operations with the aim of maximising overlap of computing with I/O and avoiding the tape-decks stopping between batch reads. Software There was no operating system. Programs were initiated by an on-line operator, via an operator's console. Operators were also responsible for manually clearing memory and re-setting the computer between programs, mounting and changing tapes, controlling off-line printing and the like. Some standard software packages were available, or became available, all written in the USA by the RCA organisation. These included the following. * A parameter-driven sort-merge program, capable of handling very large volumes of data. Sort parameters could either be read in from the paper- tape reader, for one-off sorts, or \\"compiled\\" in (really just stored in the program). There were extensive user \\"hooks\\" where user-supplied code could be put in at various stages of the sort/merge process. * An assembler-language compiler called EZ-Code. This was not used commercially for some time, since compilation time was then seen as a heavy overhead, but became increasingly used in later years. To save on computer time, typically a programmer would do an initial compile, dry-check the program manually, re-compile, and then test and de-bug the compiled machine-code version of the program, building up a reel of paper-tape machine-code patches to the program as each correction was made. Once a fairly robust copy was available, the changes would be replicated in Assembler and the program re-compiled and re-tested. Frequently, the last stage was never quite completed, and it was not unknown for production programs to require machine code-patches to be loaded from paper tape for each run. Also, a number of major commercial packages for payroll, accounts and share registration were written by Bureau staff before the Assembler compiler was accepted, and remained entirely in machine code. A further quirk was that the I/O generation routines of the assembler were not used by one programming section, who had written their own generalized I/O package, called Tape Control, based on the COBOL file description table formats. This automated much of the error-prone programming of batching/unbatching of records and controls of simultaneous read/write operations and end-of-file conditions. * A COBOL compiler. This was very rarely used, early experiences not having been entirely favourable. One notable exception was a wiring design program called \\"WRS1\\", used to help design the hardware for the later English Electric KDF9 and System 4 range of Mainframe computers. Another oddity was a decision table pre-processor for COBOL programs, itself written in COBOL. This was of some interest, since bureau programming staff were at the time experimenting with using decision tables as an alternative to flowcharts. However, while these programmers continued to hand-code in assembler from the hand-written decision tables with some success, the compilation overheads prevented the use of the pre-processor. To optimize throughput of production programs, standard packages of software were produced by bureau programmers for payroll, sales and purchase ledgers, share registration, stock control and the like, and some applications ‚Äì such as payroll ‚Äì supported the processing of data from many bureau customers in one computer run, with individual parameter settings managing individual customer's requirements. More complex client requirements were met by custom-built programs. Computer operation A very small (about 20 instructions) bootstrap loader could be held at the front of each program tape, but even this approach was not always used. Tape labels were (with the exception of COBOL and Tape Control managed applications) almost non-existent. A grandfather/father/son cycle of tape rotation protected production tapes from major disasters, but required careful manual controls. Programmers (or for operational suites Production Control staff) gave the operator written instructions on which program tape and data tapes to load, on which devices, and a written summary of how to load and initiate each program. The operator would then load the tapes, and load and initiate each program in turn manually from the console. The console consisting of a vertical display panel about high by about long with a similarly sized slightly angled control panel below it. Each of these two parts was filled with labeled buttons and illuminated indicators each (roughly) one inch square. The display section was made up of indicators which when illuminated showed, in binary (grouped as octal) characters, the machine's current running (or static) status at the individual machine core address and register level, for the compute, read and write operations then in progress. When a program was running, this display was a kaleidoscope of quickly changing, flashing, multi-colored lights. The control panel section consisted of press-buttons to select the next register to be set and a central part that mirrored the lay-out of a single machine core address. Other buttons accessed more complex operations. Use of these buttons enabled the operator to select and then directly input to the machine's core storage locations and registers the octal pattern he/she keyed in manually. For an operator to input a single machine instruction, each of up to ten octal characters of the instruction had to be selected and keyed in as its binary pattern ‚Äì each with the correct (odd) parity bit.

He adopted the Latinized name of Noviomagus, possibly suggesting that he came from the town of Nijmegen, called Ulpia Noviomagus Batavorum by the Romans. In 1561, Santbech compiled a collected edition of the works of Regiomontanus (1436‚Äì1476), De triangulis planis et sphaericis libri quinque (first published in 1533) and Compositio tabularum sinum recto, as well as Santbech's own Problematum astronomicorum et geometricorum sectiones septem. It was published in Basel by Henrich Petri and Petrus Perna. Santbech's work consisted of studies on astronomy, sundials, surveying, and levelling for water courses. It also includes descriptions of astronomical instruments, information for navigators and geographers, and general information about astronomy in the first years after Nicolaus Copernicus. Santbech also studied the subject of gunnery and ballistics as a theoretic discourse as well as for the practical application of war, and utilized the foundations of geometry, with ample references to Euclid and Ptolemy, in order to do so. Santbech seem not to have been aware of similar studies by Niccol√≤ Fontana Tartaglia. Santbech's text included theoretical illustrations of trajectories. These were depicted with abruptly acute angles and straight lines, allowing him to create a right- angled triangle from which ranges were computed with the help of a table of sines. Santbech was of course fully aware that a cannonball's true trajectory would not consist of a straight line and a sudden drop, but these depictions were meant to assist with mathematical calculations. In 1651, Riccioli gave Santbech's name to the crater Santbech on the Moon. References *Andreas Kleinert: Zur Ballistik des Daniel Santbech. In: Janus 63(1976), p. 47-59.

It is now one of three Voluntary Aided Secondary Schools in the Diocese of Llandaff and serves a much wider geographical and spiritual 'catchment' area; many students come from the Diocese of Monmouth and as far away as Caerphilly. As a Voluntary Aided school, the Local Education Authority maintains it, but the Church through its Governing Body, has considerable spiritual, financial, administrative, and educational duties towards it. The teaching staff are appointed by the Governing Body and have a responsibility to ensure that the curriculum and general life of the school is maintained through a sound Christian foundation.

In 2015 the school created controversy when they demanded that pupils provide a doctor's note to be allowed to use the lavatory during lesson periods. In June 2019, it was announced that headteacher Ceri Weatherall would step down from her post, and that current deputy headteacher Ian Loynd would take up the role from September 2019.https://www.stteilos.com/new-headteacher- for-st-teilos/ New building The front exterior of the new building. In September 2013, St Teilo's High School officially moved from its location on Llanedeyrn Road to the playing fields of Llanedeyrn High School, with the former site becoming the home of Ysgol Gyfun Gymraeg Bro Edern. The new school was designed by architects Austin-Smith:Lord in a 'five finger' design, to accommodate over 1400 pupils. The school has a curved design which acts as a sound barrier against the noise pollution caused by the large volume of traffic on the nearby A48 road. However, air pollution is an issue due to the school's close proximity to the A48. The school has 97 full-size classrooms, of which 8 are ICT computing suites. As part of the new building, a biometric payment system was introduced. Students can now pay for lunch using their fingerprint and load money onto their account via ParentPay, as well as being able to print using their biometrics through PCounter Secure Printing. A deal was also reached with the local Sony UK Technology Centre in Pencoed to provide digital signage services, projectors and video recording facilities for the school. The school was built in 5 stages, the last stages including the construction of the MUGA, 3G pitch and football and rugby playing fields.

It is located in Chandler, Arizona. Founded by former Formula One driver Bob Bondurant in 1968, it was originally located at Orange County International Raceway in California, later moving to Ontario Motor Speedway in 1970, and to Sears Point International Raceway in 1973. In 1990 a purpose-built training facility was opened in Phoenix, Arizona. The Bondurant High Performance Driving School is the largest purpose-built driving school in the world. It features a 15-turn, 1.6-mile road course, an eight-acre asphalt pad for advanced training, and more than 100 race-prepared vehicles, sedans, and open- wheel cars. It teaches competition driving, police pursuit driving, evasive driving for chauffeurs and bodyguards, stunt driving, and other courses. History The Bondurant High Performance Driving School was initially opened by Bob Bondurant at the Orange County International Raceway near Los Angeles, CA. He initially approached Porsche for backing, but was declined due to the uncertainty of his school. Bob then approached Datsun, which immediately agreed to support his plans. The starting lineup of cars included two Datsun roadsters and 510, a Lola T70 Can-Am car, and a Formula Vee. By 1970, the school relocated to the nearby Ontario Motor Speedway. Porsche, after witnessing how the school increased Datsun's profile, donated a few 911s and two 914s. The Bondurant School relocated to Sears Point International Raceway (now Infineon Raceway) near Sonoma, CA in 1973. In 1976, Nissan was not able to further support the school with additional loaned cars. Bob turned to Ford, who gladly stepped in and has sponsored the school for the rest of its time in California. In March 1990, Bob's vision of a purpose-built driver training facility finally came true as he opened a new training facility in Chandler, Arizona at Firebird Raceway, now known as Wild Horse Pass Motorsports Park. Today, the school if the official driving school of Dodge SRT. The Bondurant High Performance Driving School has seen over 300,000 drivers since its opening. Many NASCAR drivers have used the school for road course training, and many film actors and actresses have used it for driving scenes. Paul Newman was one of its first students. Vehicles Dodge ‚Äì The Dodge SRT brand is the official vehicle manufacturer for the Bondurant High Performance Driving School.

The idea of a Gasparilla-type observance centered on a ‚Äúpirate‚Äù theme, and they unanimously chose as their patron pirate the notorious and legendary William Augustus Bowles, a pirate of controversial authenticity whose alleged dastardly deeds were widespread throughout the area. Nathan Fleet, a downtown Fort Walton Beach retail merchant at that time, was chosen as the first Captain Billy Bowlegs to reign over the Festival and lead the pirate ‚Äúraids.‚Äù (In later years, his son, Judge Erwin Fleet, reigned as Cap‚Äôn Billy XIV.) The overwhelming success and acceptance of the initial celebration sparked great enthusiasm and interest among other businessmen of the community. A small group of merchants, of which two, together with two from the JAYCEES, were secretly delegated to choose from the member list the Billy Bowlegs as reigning pirate of the three-day festival, his identity to remain unknown until the unmasking ceremonies took place on the evening of the grant ball. Due to the huge success of the festival, events were added such as treasure hunts - typically the most popular part of the entire festival, but inexplicably eliminated in 2009 - parades, gigantic fireworks displays, athletic events, a landing to include the townspeople with the ‚Äúcapture‚Äù of the City and the hoisting of the Jolly Roger to signify the total surrender of the City. Beards were grown, costumes made, and over the years became more elaborate. Professional floats were added to the Grand Torchlight Parade and a glittering Coronation Pageant, open to the public, at which a new Cap‚Äôn Billy, his queen, a first mate and his lady, ten honor guard couples and children of the court are unmasked each year, with a private ball and midnight breakfast for Krewe members and honored guests climaxing the now week-long festival. Thus a tradition was born: The Billy Bowlegs Festival, with the infamous Krewe of Bowlegs and its current Cap‚Äôn as the ‚ÄúStar‚Äù of the show. The annual Billy Bowlegs Pirate Festival is held in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. The festival honors the local pirate legend, and is unrelated to the Seminole chief Billy Bowlegs. Similar to Mardi Gras, the festival consists of a parade, fireworks, and associated celebrations. The festival originated in the 1950s as a boat and water skiing show. Contrary to popular belief, there is no period documentation supporting claims that William Augustus Bowles was named \\"Billy Bowlegs\\" (nor is there any evidence Bowles even set foot near what is today Fort Walton). The confusion over the names seems to stem from the similarity of the name \\"William Bowles\\" and \\"Billy Bowlegs\\", the Seminole Chief who warred with the United States during the Seminole Wars. Billy Bowlegs was born five years after Bowles' death, though both did live and fight in Florida. Coupled with that is the fact that William Bowles bore the British Army rank of Ensign as a young man, which confuses many modern Americans as the rank is also a modern, naval rank. The festival has a Mardi Gras flair rather than a historical focus, with locals dressing up in cocked hats (such headgear was not in fashion when Bowles was active in the late 1790s to early 19th century from his base near Apalachicola). 2020 was to be in its 68th year; however, the festival was scrapped on grounds of COVID-19 pandemic. That was deferred to 2021.

In 1751, it was numbered like most other Army regiments and named the 10th (North Lincoln) Regiment of Foot. After the Childers Reforms of 1881, it became the Lincolnshire Regiment after the county where it had been recruiting since 1781. After the Second World War, the regiment was honoured with the name Royal Lincolnshire Regiment, before being amalgamated in 1960 with the Northamptonshire Regiment to form the 2nd East Anglian Regiment (Duchess of Gloucester's Own Royal Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire) which was later amalgamated with the 1st East Anglian Regiment (Royal Norfolk and Suffolk), 3rd East Anglian Regiment (16th/44th Foot) and the Royal Leicestershire Regiment to form the Royal Anglian Regiment.

The 10th would also see action at the Relief of Multan in January 1849 and the Battle of Gujrat in February 1849 during the Second Anglo-Sikh War. In 1857, at the outbreak of the Indian Rebellion, the Regiment was stationed at Dinapore, taking part in the failed first relief of the Siege of Arrah and going on to play an important role in the relief of Lucknow where Private Denis Dempsey won the Victoria Cross. The 1st Battalion, 10th Foot served in Japan from 1868 through 1871. The battalion was charged with protecting the small foreign community in Yokohama. The leader of the battalion's military band, John William Fenton, is honoured in Japan as \\"the first bandmaster in Japan\\" and as \\"the father of band music in Japan\\". He is also credited for initiating the slow process in which Kimi ga Yo came to be accepted as the national anthem of Japan. The regiment was not fundamentally affected by the Cardwell Reforms of the 1870s, which gave it a depot at the \\"old barracks\\" in Lincoln from 1873. The regiment moved to the \\"new barracks\\" further north on Burton Road in 1880. Nor was the regiment affected by the Childers reforms of 1881 ‚Äì as it already possessed two battalions, there was no need for it to amalgamate with another regiment. The depot was the 30th Brigade Depot from 1873 to 1881, and the 10th Regimental District depot thereafter Under the reforms, the regiment became The Lincolnshire Regiment on 1 July 1881. The Royal North Lincolnshire and Royal South Lincolnshire Militia regiments became the 3rd and 4th Battalions, and the 1st and 2nd Lincolnshire Rifle Volunteer Corps became the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Battalions (a 3rd Volunteer Battalion was added in 1900).Army ListWestlake, pp. 156‚Äì9. The 1st Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment was posted at Malta from 1895, and took part in the Battle of Omdurman in September 1898 during the Mahdist War. It was then stationed in British India, where it was in Bangalore until late 1902 when it transferred to Secunderabad. The 2nd Battalion embarked for South Africa in January 1900 and saw action during the Second Boer War. The 3rd (Militia) battalion, formed from the Royal North Lincoln Militia in 1881, was a reserve battalion. It was embodied in May 1900, disembodied in July the following year, and later re-embodied for service in South Africa during the Second Boer War. Almost 540 officers and men returned to Southampton on the SS Cestrian in early October 1902, following the end of the war, when the battalion was disembodied at Lincoln. In 1908, the Volunteers and Militia were reorganised under the Haldane Reforms, with the former becoming the Territorial Force (TF) and the latter the Special Reserve; the regiment now had one Reserve and two Territorial battalions. These were the 3rd Battalion (Special Reserve) at Lincoln, with the 4th Battalion (TF) at Broadgate in Lincoln and the 5th Battalion (TF) at Doughty Road in Grimsby (since demolished).Monthly Army List, August 1914. =First World War= The regiment started the First World War with two regular battalions, one militia battalion and two territorial battalions.

The battalion returned to England on 3 October 1914, and was sent to the Western Front as part of the 25th Brigade in the 8th Division soon after, arriving in France on 5 November 1914. Major engagements included the Battle of Aubers Ridge in May 1915 where the battalion incurred heavy losses and the Battle of the Somme in Autumn 1916 where the second-in-command of the battalion, Major F W Greatwood, was injured. A contingent from the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps composed of Captain Richard Tucker and 88 other ranks was detached in December 1914 to train for the Western Front. It was hoped this could join 2nd Lincolns, but 1 Lincolns' need for reinforcement was greater and it was attached to that battalion organised as two extra platoons of one of the battalion's companies (the 2nd Lincolns had recruited three Bermudians before it left the colony, including two Constables from the Bermuda Police, Corporal G.

The contingent arrived in France with 1 Lincolns on 23 June 1915, the first colonial volunteer unit to reach the Western Front. The Contingent was withered away by casualties over the following year. 50% of its remaining strength was lost at Gueudecourt on 25 September 1916. The dozen survivors were merged with a newly arrived Second BVRC Contingent, of one officer and 36 other ranks, who had trained in Bermuda as Vickers machine gunners. Stripped of their Vickers machine guns (which had been collected, for the new Machine Gun Corps), the merged contingents were retrained as Lewis light machinegunners, and provided 12 gun teams to 1 Lincolns headquarters. By the end of the war, the two contingents had lost over 75% of their combined strength. Forty had died on active service, one received the O.B.E, and six the Military Medal. Sixteen enlisted men from the two contingents were commissioned, including the Sergeant Major of the First Contingent, Colour-Sergeant R.C. Earl, who would become Commanding Officer of the BVRC after the War (some of those commissioned moved to other units in the process, including flying ace Arthur Rowe Spurling and Henry J.

The 2/4th Battalion and 2/5th Battalion moved to Ireland as part of the 177th Brigade in the 59th (2nd North Midland) Division and took part in the response to the Easter Rising before landing in France in February 1917 for service on the Western Front. New Armies The 6th (Service) Battalion landed at Suvla Bay in Gallipoli as part of the 33rd Brigade in the 11th (Northern) Division in August 1915 and, having been evacuated at the end of the year, moved to Egypt in January 1916 and then to France in July 1916 for service on the Western Front. The 7th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne as part of the 51st Brigade in the 17th (Northern) Division in July 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The 8th (Service) Battalion landed at Boulogne as part of the 63rd Brigade in the 21st Division in September 1915 also for service on the Western Front. The 10th (Service) Battalion (Grimsby, often known as the Grimsby Chums, landed in France as part of the 101st Brigade in the 34th Division in January 1916 also for service on the Western Front and saw action at the First day on the Somme in July 1916 and the Battle of Passchendaele in Autumn 1917. =Second World War= Governor and General Officer Commanding, Lieutenant-General Sir Denis Bernard, inspects the First Contingent of the BVRC to the Lincolnshire Regiment at Prospect Camp on 22 June 1940. The Second World War was declared on Sunday, 3 September 1939 and the two Territorial Army battalions, the 4th and the 6th (a duplicate of the 4th), were called-up immediately. The 2nd Battalion embarked for France with the 9th Infantry Brigade attached to the 3rd Infantry Division commanded by Major-General Bernard Montgomery in October 1939.Heathcote, p. 215 They were followed by the 6th Battalion, part of 138th Brigade with the 46th Infantry Division, in April 1940; both served with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) and managed to return from Dunkirk after the battles of France and Belgium. After returning to England, both battalions spent years in the United Kingdom on home defence anticipating a possible German invasion of the United Kingdom.Operation Instruction No. 7: \\"Defence Scheme\\", 24 September 1940, issued by the Adjutant of the 7th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment The 2nd Battalion, remaining with the same brigade and division throughout the war, then spent the next four years training in various parts of the United Kingdom before taking part in the D-Day landings in June 1944. The battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Christopher Welby-Everard was then engaged throughout the Normandy Campaign, taking part in Operation Charnwood, Operation Goodwood, and throughout the rest of the Northwest Europe Campaign until Victory in Europe Day in May 1945. The 1st Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment was stationed in British India and saw no active service until 1942. They remained in India and the Far East throughout the war and were assigned to the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade, part of 26th Indian Infantry Division, in 1942. fighting the Imperial Japanese Army in the Burma Campaign and during the Battle of the Admin Box, the first major victory against the Japanese in the campaign, in early 1944 where Major Charles Ferguson Hoey was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the only one to be awarded to the Lincolnshire Regiment during the Second World War. Men of the 4th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment at Skage, Norway after marching 56 miles across the mountains to escape being cut off, April 1940. A Norwegian soldier is seen examining one of their rifles. The Territorials of the 4th Battalion, part of 146th Brigade attached to 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, were sent to Norway and were among the first British soldiers to come into contact against an advancing enemy in the field in the Second World War. Ill-equipped and without air support, they soon had to be evacuated. Within a few weeks, they were sent to garrison neutral Iceland. They trained as Alpine troops during the two years they were there. After returning to the United Kingdom in 1942, when the division gained the 70th Brigade, they were earmarked to form part of the 21st Army Group for the coming invasion of France and started training in preparation. After two years spent on home defence, the 6th Battalion left the United Kingdom, still as part of the 138th (Lincoln and Leicester) Brigade in the 46th Infantry Division, in January 1943 to participate in the final stages of the Tunisia Campaign. In September 1943, the battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel David Yates, took part in the landings at Salerno in Italy as part of Mark Clark's U.S. Fifth Army, suffering heavy losses and later captured Naples, crossed the Volturno Line and fought on the Winter Line and in the Battle of Monte Cassino in January 1944. The battalion returned to Egypt to refit in March 1944, by which time it had suffered heavy casualties and lost 518 killed, wounded or missing. It returned to the Italian Front in July 1944 and, after more hard fighting throughout the summer during the Battles for the Gothic Line, it sailed for Greece in December to help the civil authorities to keep order during the Greek Civil War. In April 1945, the 6th Lincolns returned to Italy for the final offensive but did not participate in any fighting and then moved into Austria for occupation duties. 8th Battalion, Lincolnshire Regiment, abandon their bicycles and advance along a country lane during anti-invasion exercises at Weybourne in Norfolk, 23 July 1941 (IWM H11931). The Lincolnshire Regiment also raised two other battalions for hostilities-only, the 7th and 8th, created in June and July 1940 respectively. However, both were converted into other arms of service, the 7th becoming 102nd Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery on 1 December 1941 and the 8th becoming the 101st Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. The Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps again provided two drafts; one in June 1940, and a full company in 1944. Four Bermudians who served with the Lincolns during the war (three from the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps) reached the rank of Major with the regiment: Major General Glyn Gilbert (later of the Parachute Regiment), Lieutenant Colonel John Brownlow Tucker (the first Commanding Officer of the Bermuda Regiment, amalgamated from the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps and the Bermuda Militia Artillery in 1965), Major Anthony Smith (killed-in-action at Venrai, in 1944, and subject of an award-winning film, In The Hour of Victory), and Major Patrick Purcell, responsible for administering German newspapers in the British area of occupation. =Post-war years= After the war, both the 4th and 6th battalions were placed in 'suspended animation' in 1946 but were both reformed on 1 January 1947. However, on 1 July 1950, the 6th was merged with the 4th to create the 4th/6th Battalion. On 28 October 1948, the 2nd Battalion was amalgamated with the 1st Battalion. In 1960, the regiment amalgamated with the Northamptonshire Regiment to form the 2nd East Anglian Regiment (Duchess of Gloucester's Own Royal Lincolnshire and Northamptonshire) which was later amalgamated with the 1st East Anglian Regiment (Royal Norfolk and Suffolk), 3rd East Anglian Regiment (16th/44th Foot) and the Royal Leicestershire Regiment in September 1964 to form the Royal Anglian Regiment.Swinson, p. 270 Currently, 674 Squadron Army Air Corps uses the Sphinx as an emblem within its crest in honour of its local connections with the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment. The Royal Anglian Regiment maintains the same parental relationship with the Royal Bermuda Regiment that the Royal Lincolnshire Regiment had maintained with the Bermuda Volunteer Rifle Corps (retitled Bermuda Rifles in 1951, before amalgamating with the Bermuda Militia Artillery to form the Bermuda Regiment in 1965).

The constitution was written in June, July, and August 1945, when Indonesia was emerging from Japanese control at the end of World War II. It was abrogated by the Federal Constitution of 1949 and the Provisional Constitution of 1950, but restored on 5 July 1959. The 1945 Constitution then set forth the Pancasila, the five nationalist principles devised by Sukarno, as the embodiment of basic principles of an independent Indonesian state. It provides for a limited separation of executive, legislative, and judicial powers. The governmental system has been described as \\"presidential with parliamentary characteristics.\\" Following major upheavals in 1998 and the resignation of President Suharto, several political reforms were set in motion, via amendments to the Constitution, which resulted in changes to all branches of government as well as additional human rights provisions. History =The writing= The Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies in 1942, defeated the Dutch colonial regime, and occupied it for the duration of World War II. The territory then fell under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Group (Nanpo Gun), based in Saigon, Vietnam. The Japanese divided the territory into three military government regions, based on the largest islands: \\"Sumatra\\" was under the Japanese 25th Army, \\"Java\\" under the Japanese 16th Army and \\"East Indonesia\\" (the eastern islands), including part of \\"Borneo\\" (Sarawak and Sabah were under the Japanese 38th Army) was under the Imperial Japanese Navy. As the Japanese military position became increasingly untenable, especially after their defeat at the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944, more and more native Indonesians were appointed to official positions in the occupation administration. On 1 March 1945, the 16th Army established the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (), for Java. The 25th Army later established a BPUPK for Sumatra.Kusuma (2004) No such organisation existed for the remainder of Indonesia. The BPUPK in Java, when established, consisted of 62 members, but there were 68 in the second session. It was chaired by Dr Radjiman Wedyodiningrat (1879‚Äì1951). The future president Sukarno and vice- president Mohammad Hatta were among its members. It met in the building that had been used by the Dutch colonial quasi-parliament, the Volksraad (\\"People's Council\\") in central Jakarta. It held two sessions, 29 May ‚Äì 1 June and 10‚Äì17 July 1945. The first session discussed general matters, including the philosophy of the state for future independent Indonesia, Pancasila. the philosophy was formulated by nine members of the BPUPK: Sukarno, Hatta, Yamin, Maramis, Soebardjo, Wahid Hasjim, Muzakkir, Agus Salim and Abikoesno. The outcome was something of a compromise, and included an obligation for Muslims to follow Sharia (Islamic law), the so-called Piagam Jakarta (Jakarta Charter) which later changed to the current version of Pancasila. The second session produced a provisional constitution made up of 37 articles, 4 transitory provision and 2 additional provision. The nation would be a unitary state and a republic. A 1946 print edition of the constitution On 26 July 1945, the Allies called for the unconditional surrender of Japan in the Potsdam Declaration. The Japanese authorities, realising they would probably lose the war, began to make firm plans for Indonesian independence, more to spite the Dutch than anything else.Ricklefs (1982), p. 197 On 6 August, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. On 7 August, the Nanpo Gun headquarters announced that an Indonesian leader could enact a body called the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (). The dropping of a second atomic bomb on Nagasaki, and the Soviet invasion of Manchuria on 9 August prompted the Japanese to surrender unconditionally on 15 August 1945. Sukarno and Hatta declared independence on 17 August 1945, and the PPKI met the following day.Ricklefs (1982), pp. 197-198 In the meeting chaired by Sukarno, the 27 members, including Hatta, Supomo, Wachid Hasjim, Sam Ratulangi and Subardjo, began to discuss the proposed constitution article by article. The Committee made some fundamental changes, including the removal of 7 words from the text of Jakarta Charter which stated the obligation for Muslims to follow Sharia. The new charter then became the preambule of the constitution, and the clause stating that the president must be a Muslim was removed. The historical compromise was made possible in part by the influence of Mohamad Hatta and Tengku Mohamad Hasan. The Committee then officially adopted the Constitution. =Other constitutions= The 1945 Constitution (usually referred to by the Indonesian acronym \\"UUD'45\\") remained in force until it was replaced by the Federal Constitution on 27 December 1949. This was in turn replaced by the Provisional Constitution on 17 August 1950. In 1955 elections were held for the People's Representative Council (DPR) as well as for a Constitutional Assembly to draw up a definitive constitution. However, this became bogged down in disputes between nationalists and Islamists, primarily over the role of Islam in Indonesia. Sukarno became increasingly disillusioned by this stagnation and with the support of the military, who saw a much greater constitutional role for themselves, began to push for a return to the 1945 Constitution. This was put to the vote on 30 May 1958 and 2 June 1959, but the motion failed to gain the required two-thirds majority. Finally, on 5 July 1959 President Sukarno issued a decree dissolving the assembly and returning to the 1945 Constitution.Ricklefs (1982), p. 254 =Constitutional amendments= The Indonesian political system before and after the constitutional amendments Suharto, who officially became president in 1968, refused to countenance any changes to the Constitution despite the fact that even Sukarno had viewed it as a provisional document.Adnan Buyung Nasution (2001) In 1983, the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) passed a decree stipulating the need for a nationwide referendum to be held before any amendments were made to the Constitution. This led to a 1985 law requiring such a referendum to have a 90% turnout and for any changes to be approved by a 90% vote. Then in 1997, the activist Sri Bintang Pamungkas and two colleagues were arrested and jailed for publishing a proposed modified version of the 1945 Constitution.Sri Bintang Pamungkas (1999) With the fall of Suharto and the New Order regime in 1998, the 1983 decree and 1985 law were rescinded and the way was clear to amend the Constitution to make it more democratic. This was done in four stages at sessions of the MPR in 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002. As a result, the original Constitution has grown from 37 articles to 73, of which only 11% remain unchanged from the original constitution.Denny Indrayana (2008), p331 The most important of the changes were:Jimly Asshiddiqie (2009)Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 360-381 * Limiting presidents to two terms of office * Establishing a Regional Representative Council (DPD), which together with the DPR makes up an entirely elected MPR. * Purifying and empowering presidential system of government, instead of a semi presidential one. * Stipulating democratic, direct elections for the president, instead of the president being elected by the MPR * Reorganizing the mechanism of horizontal relation among state organs, instead of giving the highest constitutional position to the People's Assembly. * Abolishing the Supreme Advisory CouncilJimly Asshiddiqie (2005) * Mandating direct, general, free, secret, honest, and fair elections for the House of Representatives and regional legislatures * Establishing a Constitutional Court for guarding and defending the constitutional system as set forth in the constitution. * Establishing a Judicial Commission * The addition of ten entirely new articles concerning human rights. Among the above changes, the establishment of Constitutional Court is regarded as a successful innovation in Indonesia constitutional system. The court was established in 2003 by 9 justices head by Professor Jimly Asshiddiqie,a prominent scholar from the University of Indonesia. There are five jurisdictions of the court, i.e. (i) constitutional review of law, (ii) disputes of constitutional jurisdiction between state institutions, (iii) disputes on electoral results, (iv) dissolution of political parties, and (v) impeachment of the president/vice-president. The other icon of success in Indonesian reform is the establishment of the Corruption Eradication Commission which independently fights against corruption and grafts. Corruption in Indonesia is regarded an extraordinary crime. The legal standing The 1945 Constitution has the highest legal authority in the country's system of government. The executive, legislative and judicial branches of government must defer to it. The Constitution was originally officially enacted on 18 August 1945. The attached Elucidation, drawn up by Prof. Raden Soepomo (1903‚Äì1958), Indonesia's first justice minister, was officially declared to be a part of the Constitution on 5 July 1959. The Preamble, the body of the Constitution and the Elucidation were all reaffirmed as inseparable parts of the Constitution in 1959, and then again in Provisional MPR Decree No. XX/MPRS/1966.Dahlan Thaib (1999) However, since the amendments, the Elucidation has not been updated, and still refers to the original document, including parts that have been removed, such as Chapter IV. During the sessions in the People's Assembly, all the ideas setforth in the Elucidation was transformed become articles in the new amendments.Jimly Asshiddiqie(2009) Then, final article of the amended Constitution states that the Constitution consists of the Preamble and the articles.Denny Indrayana (2008), pp. 312-313 Contents =Preamble= The preamble to the 1945 Constitution of Indonesia contains the Pancasila state philosophy. =Chapter I: Form of state and sovereignty= States that Indonesia is a unitary republic based on law with sovereignty in the hands of the people and exercised through laws. =Chapter II: The People's Consultative Assembly= States that the People's Consultative Assembly is made up of the members of the People's Representative Council and the Regional Representatives Council, all of the members of both bodies being directly elected.

Built immediately to the west of the ramparts of the city of Samothrace, it was nonetheless independent, as attested to by the dispatch of city ambassadors during festivals. It was celebrated throughout Ancient Greece for its Mystery religion. Numerous famous people were initiates, including the historian Herodotus, one of very few authors to have left behind a few clues to the nature of the mysteries, the Spartan leader Lysander, and numerous Athenians. The temple complex is mentioned by Plato and Aristophanes. During the Hellenistic period, after the investiture of Phillip II, it formed a Macedonian national sanctuary where the successors to Alexander the Great vied to outdo each other's munificence. It remained an important religious site throughout the Roman period. Hadrian visited, and Varro described the mysteries. The cult fades from history towards the end of Late Antiquity, when the temple would have been closed during the persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire.  Cult of the Great Gods  The identity and nature of the deities venerated at the sanctuary remains largely enigmatic, in large part because it was taboo to pronounce their names. Literary sources from antiquity refer to them under the collective name of \\"Cabeiri\\" (Greek: K√°biroi), while they carry the simpler epithet of Gods or Great Gods, which was a title or state of being rather than the actual name, ( Meg√°loi Theo√≠) on inscriptions found on the site. = The pantheon of Samothrace = Site plan of the sanctuary, showing chronology of major construction The Pantheon of the Great Gods consists of numerous chthonic deities, primarily predating the arrival of Greek colonists on the island in the 7th century BC, and congregating around one central figure ‚Äì the Great Mother. * The Great Mother, a goddess often depicted on Samothracian coinage as a seated woman, with a lion at her side. Her original secret name was Axi√©ros. She is associated with the Anatolian Great Mother, the Phrygian Mount, and the Trojan Mother Goddess of Mount Ida. The Greeks associated her equally with the fertility goddess Demeter. The Great Mother is the all-powerful mistress of the wild world of the mountains, venerated on sacred rocks where sacrifices and offerings were made to her. In the sanctuary of Samothrace, these altars correspond to porphyry outcroppings of various colours (red, green, blue, or grey). For her faithful, her power also manifested itself in veins of magnetic iron, from which they fashioned rings that initiates wore as signs of recognition. A number of these rings were recovered from the tombs in the neighbouring necropolis. * Hecate, under the name of Zerynthia, and Aphrodite-Zerynthia, two important nature goddesses, are equally venerated at Samothrace, their cult having been distanced from that of the Great Mother and more closely identified with deities more familiar to the Greeks. * Kadmilos (), the spouse of Axi√©ros, is a fertility god identified by the Greeks as Hermes; a phallic deity whose sacred symbols were a ram's head and a baton (kerykeion), which was obviously a phallic symbol and can be found on some currency. * Two other masculine deities accompany Kadmilos. These may correspond to the two legendary heroes who founded the Samothracean mysteries: the brothers Dardanos () and Iasion (). They are associated by the Greeks with the Dioscuri, divine twins popular as protectors of mariners in distress. * A pair of underworld deities, Axiokersos and Axiokersa, are identified to Hades and Persephone, but do not appear to be part of the original group of pre-Hellenic deities. The legend (familiar to the Greeks) of the rape of the goddess of fertility by the god of the underworld also plays a part in the sacred dramas celebrated at Samothrace; although less so than at Eleusis. * During a later period this same myth was associated with that of the marriage of Cadmos and Harmony, possibly due to a similarity of names to Kadmilos and Electra. = The rituals = General view of the remains of Hieron, from the southwest (site plan, number 13) A picturesque view of the Hieron The whole of the sanctuary was open to all who wished to worship the Great Gods, although access to buildings consecrated to the mysteries was understood to be reserved for initiates. These rituals and ceremonies were presided over by the priestess in service to the people. The head priestess, and often a prophetess, was titled a Sybil, or Cybele. The most common rituals were indistinguishable from practice at other Greek sanctuaries. Prayer and supplications accompanied by blood sacrifices of domestic animals (sheep and pigs) burnt in sacred hearths ( esch√°rai), as well as libations made to the chthonic deities in circular or rectangular ritual pits ( b√≥thros). A large number of rock altars were used, the largest of which was surrounded by a monumental enclosure at the end of the 4th century BC (site plan, number 11). The major annual festival, which drew envoys to the island from throughout the Greek world, probably took place in mid-July. It consisted of the presentation of a sacred play, which entailed a ritual wedding (ŒπŒµœÅœåœÇ Œ≥Œ¨ŒºŒøœÇ hier√≥s g√°mos); this may have taken place in the building with the Dancer's Wall which was built in the 4th century BC. During this era the belief arose that the search for the missing maiden, followed by her marriage to the god of the underworld, represented the marriage of Cadmos and Harmonia. The frieze (see photo below) on which the Temenos is indicated may be an allusion to this marriage. Around 200 BC, a Dionysian competition was added to the festival, facilitated by the construction of a theatre (site plan, number 10) opposite the great altar (site plan, number 11). According to local myth, it is in this era that the city of Samothrace honoured a poet of Iasos in Caria for having composed the tragedy Dardanos and having effected other acts of good will around the island, the city, and the sanctuary. Numerous votive offerings were made at the sanctuary, which were placed in a building made for the purpose next to the great altar (site plan, number 12). Offerings could be statues of bronze, marble or clay, weapons, vases, etc. However, due to Samothrace's location on busy maritime routes the cult was particularly popular and numerous often very modest offerings found their way there: excavations have turned up seashells and fish hooks offered by mariners or fishermen who were likely thanking the divinities for having protected them from the dangers of the sea. = The initiation = A unique feature of the Samothracean mystery cult was its openness: as compared to the Eleusinian mysteries, the initiation had no prerequisites for age, gender, status or nationality. Everyone, men and women, adults and children, Greeks and non- Greeks, the free, the indentured, or the enslaved could participate. Nor was the initiation confined to a specific date and the initiate could on the same day attain two successive degrees of the mystery. The only condition, in fact, was to be present in the sanctuary. The first stage of the initiation was the myesis (). A sacred account and special symbols were revealed to the mystes (); that is to say the initiate. In this fashion, Herodotus was given a revelation concerning the significance of phallic images of Hermes-Kadmilos. According to Varro, the symbols revealed on this occasion symbolized heaven and earth. In return for this revelation, which was kept secret, the initiate was given the assurance of certain privileges: Hope for a better life, and more particularly protection at sea, and possibly, as at Eleusis, the promise of a happy afterlife. During the ceremony the initiate received a crimson sash knotted around the waist that was supposed to be a protective talisman. An iron ring exposed to the divine power of magnetic stones was probably another symbol of protection conferred during the initiation. Frieze with bulls from the Arsino√© rotunda (Samothrace Museum) (site plan, number 15) The preparation for the initiation took place in a small room south of the Anaktoron (site plan, number 16; literally the House of the Lords), a type of sacristy where the initiate was dressed in white and was given a lamp. The myesis then took place in the Anaktoron, a large hall capable of accommodating numerous already initiated faithful, who would attend the ceremony seated on benches along the walls. The initiate carried out a ritual washing in a basin situated in the southeast corner and then made a libation to the gods in a circular pit. At the end of the ceremony, the initiate took his place seated on a round wooden platform facing the principal door while ritual dances took place around him. He was then taken to the north chamber, the sanctuary where he received the revelation proper. Access to this sanctuary was forbidden to non-initiates. The initiate was given a document attesting to his initiation in the mysteries and could, at least during the later period, pay to have his name engraved on a commemorative plaque. The second degree of the initiation was called the epoptia (, literally, the contemplation). Unlike the one year interval between degrees which was demanded at Eleusis, the second degree at Samothrace could be obtained immediately after the myesis. In spite of this, it was only realized by a small number of initiates, which leads us to believe that it involved some difficult conditions, though it is unlikely that these conditions were financial or social. Lehman assessed that it concerned moral issues, as the candidate was auditioned and required to confess his sins. This audition took place overnight in front of the Hieron (site plan, number 13; literally the holy place). A foundation was recovered here which could have supported a giant torch; generally speaking, the discovery of numerous lamps and torch supports throughout this site confirms the nocturnal nature of the initiation rites. After the interrogation and the eventual absolution awarded by the priest or official the candidate was brought into the Hieron, which also functioned as an epoption (place of contemplation) where ritual cleansing took place and sacrifice was made into a sacred hearth located in the center of the \\"holy of holies\\". The initiate then went to an apse in the rear of the building, which was probably intended to resemble a grotto. The hierophant ( hieroph√°ntes), otherwise known as the initiator, took his place on a platform (Œ≤ŒÆŒºŒ± b√©ma), in the apse where he recited the liturgy and displayed the symbols of the mysteries. During the Roman era, towards 200 AD, the entrance to the Hieron was modified to permit the entrance of live sacrificial offerings. A parapet was constructed in the interior to protect the spectators and a crypt was fitted into the apse. These modifications permitted the celebration of the Kriobolia and the Taurobolia of the Anatolian Magna Mater, which were introduced to the epopteia at this time. The new rites saw the initiate, or possibly only the priest by proxy, descend into a pit in the apse. The blood of the sacrificial animals then flowed over him or her in the fashion of a baptismal rite.  Description of the sanctuary  Foundation of the Arsino√© Rotunda and fragment of the dedication (site plan number 15) The Samothrace site may appear to be somewhat confusing at first glance; this is due to a combination of the unusual topography and the two century long period over which the site was developed. The sanctuary occupies three narrow terraces on the west slopes of mount Hagios Georgios, separated by two steep- banked torrents. The entrance is in the east through the Ptolemy II propylaeum, also known as the Ptolemaion (site plan number 20), which spans the eastern brook and functions as a bridge. Immediately to the west, on the first terrace, there is a somewhat circular paved depression, containing an altar in the centre, which was undoubtedly a sacrificial area; although the precise function of this place has not further been determined. A winding path descends towards the main terrace, between two brooks, where the main monuments to the cult can be found. A large tholos, the Arsino√´ion, or Arsino√´ Rotunda (site plan number 15), the largest covered round space in the ancient Greek world (20 m in diameter), may have served to welcome the theoroi, sacred ambassadors delegated by cities and associations to attend the great festivals at the sanctuary. The decoration of rosettes and garlanded bull's heads leads some to believe that sacrifices may have also taken place here. The rotunda was built on an older building of which only the foundation has remained. The Arlington Massachusetts Reservoir is an exact copy of the rotunda. Right at the opening of the path leading to the sanctuary, one finds the largest building, the Building of the Dancer's Frieze (site plan number 14), sometimes called the Temenos, as it corresponds to a monumental enclosure marking a much older sacrificial area. There is a great deal of variance in reconstructed plans for this portion of the site (compare for example the different editions of Lehman's archeological guide ‚Äî the plan used in this article reflects the 4th edition). It is in essence a simple court preceded by an ionic propylaeum decorated with the well-known dancer's frieze (photo below). The celebrated architect Scopas may have been the designer. The most important building of the cult, the epopteion, is located to the south of the Temenos. This building bears the inscription of Hieron (site plan number 13). It is not known who dedicated this building, but given the magnificence was likely a royal. It is some type of temple, but there is no peripteros (surround of columns) and only a single prostyle (partly restored ‚Äì see photo above). The architectural ornamentation of the facade is noteworthy for its elegance. The interior boasts the largest unsupported span in the ancient Greek world ‚Äì 11 metres. The south end of this building is an apse (fr: abside inscrite), which constitutes the most sacred portion. This apse may represent, according to R. Ginouv√®s, a grotto for conducting chthonic rituals. The main altar, and the building for displaying votive offerings, are located to the west of the Hieron (site plan numbers 11 & 12). Capital of the front of the west facade of the Ptolemy II Propylaeum: Griffons devouring a doe (site plan number 20) The Anaktoron, the building for greeting the myesis is located north of the Arsino√´ Rotunda, though the version currently visible dates to the imperial era. The third and final terrace, West of the spiritual centre of the sanctuary, is primarily occupied by votive buildings such as the Miletean Building, so named as it was dedicated by a citizen of Miletus (site plan number 5), and the Neorion, or naval monument (site plan number 6). It is also the location of a banquet hall (site plan number 7). Three other small Hellenistic treasures are not well known (site plan, numbers 1 to 3). Overlooking the central terrace, the space is above all dominated by a very large portico (104 m long; site plan number 8) which acts as a monumental backdrop to the sanctuary, above the theatre. It is in this area of the site that the most recent traces of occupation can be found: a square Byzantine fort in effect built of treasure; as it re-used building material from the original site. Diodorus Siculus (III.55) relates a legend of the temple being founded by Myrina, before she was defeated by Mopsus and Sipylus, and slain: > After that, while subduing some of the rest of the islands, she was caught > in a storm, and after she had offered up prayers for her safety to the > Mother of the Gods, she was carried to one of the uninhabited islands; this > island, in obedience to a vision which she beheld in her dreams, she made > sacred to this goddess, and set up altars there and offered magnificent > sacrifices. She also gave it the name of Samothrace, which means, when > translated into Greek, 'Sacred Island', although some historians say that it > was formerly called Samos and was then given the name of Samothrace by > Thracians who at one time dwelt on it. However, after the Amazons had > returned to the continent, the myth relates, the Mother of the Gods, well > pleased with the island, settled in it certain other people, and also her > own sons, who are known by the name of Corybantes; who their father was, is > handed down in their rites as a matter not to be divulged; and she > established the mysteries which are now celebrated on the island and > ordained by law that the sacred area should enjoy the right of sanctuary.  A Macedonian national sanctuary  > And we are told that Philip, after being initiated into the mysteries of > Samothrace at the same time with Olympias, he himself being still a youth > and she an orphan child, fell in love with her and betrothed himself to her > at once with the consent of her brother, Arymbas. > (Plutarch, Life of Alexander , II, 2) According to Plutarch, this is how Macedonian king Phillip II met his future spouse Olympias, the Epirote princess of the Aeacid dynasty, during their initiation to the mysteries of Samothrace. This historical anecdote defines the Argead dynasty's allegiance to the sanctuary, followed by the two dynasties of the Diadochi; the Ptolemaic dynasty and the Antigonid dynasty who continually attempted to outdo one another in the 3rd century BC, during their alternating periods of domination over the island and more generally the Northern Aegean. The first sovereign of whom epigraphic traces remain was the son of Philip II and half-brother of Alexander, Philip III of Macedon, who would be the principal benefactor of the Sanctuary during the 4th century BC: he probably commissioned the Temenos by 340 BC, the Main Altar in the next decade, the Hi√©ron by 325 BC, as well as the Doric monument and the border of the eastern circular area; these dedicated in his name as well as that of his nephew Alexander IV of Macedon, who jointly ruled from 323-317 BC. Dancer's Frieze from the Temenos (site plan number 14) The second surge of major construction commence started in the 280's with the Arsinoe II Rotunda, which may date from the period (288-281 BC) when this daughter of Ptolemy I was married to the Diadochi Lysimachus, then king of Macedon. Widowed after his death in battle in 281 BC, she married her half-brother, Ptolemy Keraunos and later her brother Ptolemy II in 274 BC. Of the monumental dedication which surmounted the door, only a single block remains, and it is thus not possible to determine the complete inscription. Ptolemy II himself had the Propylaeum built across the entrance to the sanctuary: the powerful Ptolemaic fleet which allowed him to dominate the bulk of the Aegean up to the Thracian coast, and the construction at Samothrace bear witness to his influence. The re- establishment of the Antigonid dynasty on the Macedonian throne with Antigonus II Gonatas, soon led to a clash for maritime supremacy on the Aegean: Antigonus Gonatas celebrated his victory at the naval battle of Kos by dedicating one of his victorious ships to the shrine by 255‚Äì245 BC; displayed in a building constructed on an ad hoc basis on the west terrace; the Neorion (site plan number 6). It may have been inspired by another Neorion, at Delos, probably built at the end of the 4th century BC, which he re-used and dedicated to another of his ships at the same time. The naval war between the Ptolemaics and the Antigonids continued intermittently through the second half of the 3rd century BC, until Philip V of Macedon, the last Antigonid king to attempt to establish a Macedonian thalassocracy, was finally beaten by an alliance between Rhodes and Pergamon. A monumental column was dedicated to him in front to the large stoa of the upper terrace by the Macedonians by 200 BC. It was probably during one of these episodes that the monumental fountain containing a ship's prow of limestone and the famous Winged Victory of Samothrace statue were built. This could actually be a dedication from Rhodes rather than Macedon, as analysis of the limestone used for the prow and the type of vessel indicated that it came from Rhodes. The sanctuary became the final refuge for the last king of Macedon, Perseus of Macedon, who went to the island after his defeat at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC and was there arrested by the Romans.  Site exploration  Winged Victory of Samothrace, displayed in the Louvre (site plan number 9) Fascination with mystery religions renewed interest in the site during the 17th and 18th centuries. Following the 1863 discovery of the Winged Victory of Samothrace statue ‚Äì now in the Louvre ‚Äì by French consul Charles Champoiseau (posted to Adrianople), the French team of Deville and Coquart carried out the first archeological digs of the site in 1866. The Austrian A. Conze was next to excavate the site in 1873 and 1876: he cleared the Ptol√©maion and the stoa and carried out some superficial digs at the Hi√©ron, the Arsino√©ion as well as the Temenos. This work was published in two volumes of unusually high quality for the time. Under an agreement with the Turkish government, the Austrians shared their discoveries: numerous architectural fragments went to the Vienna Kunsthistorisch Museum, while others were sent to Gallipoli and then on to the Istanbul Archeological Museum ‚Äî part of this material unfortunately disappeared in transit. Champoiseau returned in 1891 to look for the blocks which formed the ship's prow upon which the Winged Victory of Samothrace statue had been installed in Paris, and at this time discovered the theatre. The √âcole fran√ßaise d'Ath√®nes and the Charles University in Prague (Salaƒç and Fernand Chapouthuer) also carried out joint work between 1923 and 1927, before the Institute of Fine Arts (at New York University) started their first excavations in 1938, which uncovered the Anaktoron. Interrupted by the war, during which time the site suffered greatly as a result of Bulgarian occupation, they returned in 1948 and continue to the present. In 1956 a partial reconstruction (anastylosis) of the Hi√©ron facade was carried out.

At the special ASEAN Summit on SARS, held in Bangkok on 29 April 2003, Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra raised the idea of establishing what was then called the ‚ÄúEconomic Cooperation Strategy\\", with leaders of Cambodia, Lao PDR and Myanmar. The objectives of this new initiative are to bridge the economic gap among these five countries and to promote prosperity in the sub-region in a sustainable manner. Such prosperity, it is expected, will not only benefit the four countries, but also add value to ASEAN and its solidarity. It is hoped that a stronger Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand will also mean a stronger ASEAN. In this way the new cooperation framework is expected to act as a building block and move ASEAN forward at a more even pace, on the basis of self-reliance and shared prosperity. Leaders of Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand met for the first time on 12 November 2003 in Bagan, the Union of Myanmar. At the Summit, the four Leaders adopted the Bagan Declaration, affirming their commitment to cooperate in five priority areas of cooperation, and endorsed the Economic Cooperation Strategy Plan of Action, under which 46 common projects and 224 bilateral projects were listed for implementation over the next ten years. The Leaders agreed to call this newly created economic cooperation framework the \\"Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy\\" or \\"ACMECS\\". The joining of Vietnam with the group on 10 May 2004 has increased ACMECS to 5 member countries. The emphasis of ACMECS is on using self-help and partnership to achieve sustainable development, including poverty reduction, in line with the UN Millennium Development Goals. ACMECS is intended to act as a catalyst to build upon existing regional cooperation programs and complement bilateral frameworks with a view to transforming the border areas of the five countries into zones of economic growth, social progress and prosperity, and to blending local, national and regional interests for common benefits, shared prosperity, enhanced solidarity, peace, stability and good neighborliness.

Born in Frederick, Maryland, he was the son of John Geyer, saddler of Frederick Town. Geyer was of German descent, his father having come from Prussia.  Early life  Geyer was instructed privately, studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1811 and practiced law in Frederick. Most of Geyer's legal knowledge was gained by working in the office of his maternal uncle, Daniel Sheaffee, who was a prominent lawyer. He also wrote for the Frederick Town papers and had knowledge of the printing business. Geyer moved from Maryland to Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia.  Military career  During the War of 1812 he served as a first lieutenant in the Thirty-sixth Regiment, Maryland Infantry from 1813 to 1815. He reached the position of pay- master and spent some time stationed at Norfolk, Virginia. After the war ended, Geyer settled in St. Louis, Missouri, still holding the office of pay- master. He also began pursuing the study of law. After a year, Geyer resigned his pay-master position and began practicing law. Around the same time, he was appointed captain of the first military company west of the Mississippi River. Geyer was known as captain for the rest of his life. Geyer became involved in a feud with Captain George Kennerby, the origin of which is unknown. Geyer was offended by Kennerby and challenged him to a duel. The two met at Bloody Island with pistols and exchanged shots. Kennerby was struck in the leg and was unable to stand. Both agreed to return to the fight at a later time, but before they could meet again, the argument was settled by the intervention of mutual friends and Geyer and Kennerby became friends for life.  Political career  In addition to his political career, in St. Louis, Geyer wrote for the Missouri Republican and was an editor of the St. Louis Times in 1833. Geyer was a member of the convention of Missouri and helped to write the first Missouri constitution. He was a member of the Territorial assembly in 1818 and a delegate to the constitutional convention in 1820. In 1818, Geyer published a compilation of Missouri's territorial laws, known as \\"Geyer's Digest.\\" From 1820 to 1824 he was a member of the Missouri House of Representatives and again in 1834-1835, serving as speaker on two occasions. In the 1830s, Geyer helped form and lead Missouri's Whig Party. He authored the Geyer Act of 1839 establishing public education in Missouri as well as the University of Missouri. In 1850, Geyer was offered the position of secretary of war by President Millard Fillmore, but Geyer declined. He was elected senator after gaining support from both Whigs and Democrats over his ambiguous stance on slavery. Geyer succeeded Thomas Hart Benton, who ended his senatorial career by insisting that Congress had the power to restrict slavery in the federal territories. Benton was a senator for thirty years, and it was the first time he had been defeated in Missouri for the senatorship. Geyer was elected as a Whig to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1851, to March 4, 1857. Geyer was elected to the Senate just as his own Whig party was dissolving and prominent leaders took other positions. The last Whig convention was in Baltimore on June 16, 1852. For two years, Geyer was the only senator from Missouri. Missouri became the first state to be represented by only one senator for a considerable period of time. The views of Bentonites and anti- Bentonites were so contentious, that the legislature did not elect another senator and the governor did not appoint anyone, believing it was not within the governor's ability to do so. During his time in the Senate, Geyer voted for the Kansas-Nebraska bill, which demonstrated his proslavery views.  Legal career  In the late 1830s or early 1840s, Henry Geyer had a law partnership with Benjamin B. Dayton, which was in business until Geyer was elected to the Senate. The firm of Geyer & Dayton had a large business and tried many important land suits. Geyer did not seek reelection to the Senate after 1857 and resumed the practice of law. He was recruited to assist Reverdy Johnson in defending John F.A. Sanford, the slave-owner in the Dred Scott case. Geyer was asked to join Johnson because of his knowledge of Missouri law, his experience arguing in front of the Supreme Court, and his strong southern views. During the trial, Geyer argued for limited federal oversight of state supreme court decisions, against Dred Scott's right to bring suit in federal court, and stated that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional. Geyer gained national recognition as a lawyer when he argued the case of The State vs. Darnes in 1840. Darnes was indicted for manslaughter for killing Mr. Davis, the publisher of the St. Louis Democratic newspaper, The Argus. An article in the paper denounced certain politicians, which offended Darnes. Darnes confronted Davis and struck him with an iron cane several times. Davis was taken to the hospital, but died after eight days. On the eighth day, Dr. Beaumont, a skilled surgeon, performed a trephining procedure on Davis to relieve pressure on the skull. In his argument, Geyer maintained that Davis' death was caused by the surgery and not the injuries he sustained from Darnes. Davis was convicted of manslaughter in the third or fourth degree, essentially amounting to an acquittal. Geyer's two day argument was published in pamphlet form, republished in Boston, and used by the New England bar in similar cases.  Personal life  Henry Geyer married one of seven daughters of Rufus Easton, the first postmaster of St. Louis. This was one of three wives that Geyer married. At his death, he left a widow, one son, and two daughters.  Death and legacy  Geyer died in St. Louis on March 5, 1859 and was interred at Bellefontaine Cemetery. He was sixty-eight years old. Geyer Road in St. Louis is named in his honor.

Based on the 1941 novel by James M. Cain, this was Crawford's first starring film for Warner Bros. after leaving Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, and won her the Academy Award for Best Actress. In 1996, Mildred Pierce was deemed \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\" and selected for preservation in the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry. Plot From the trailer for the film Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is murdered. The police tell Mildred that her first husband, Bert Pierce, has confessed. Mildred protests that he is too kind to commit murder and reveals her story to the officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must sell her baked goods to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert accuses Mildred of favoring their two daughters over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they separate. Mildred retains custody of 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide Veda's material possessions, who longs for high social status and is ashamed of her mother being a baker. Mildred hides the fact that she has taken a job as a waitress, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her. While the two are at his beach house for a weekend, Kay contracts pneumonia and dies after a trip with Veda and Bert. Mildred channels her grief into work and throws herself into opening a new restaurant. With her friend and former supervisor, Ida Corwin, Mildred's restaurant is a success. Wally helps Mildred buy the property, and soon she owns a chain of restaurants throughout Southern California. Veda secretly marries well-to-do Ted Forrester for his money and position, but his mother objects. Veda agrees to dissolve the marriage but claims she is pregnant and demands $10,000 from the Forresters. Veda smugly confesses her pregnancy is a sham to Mildred, who tears up the check and throws Veda out of the house. Bert, too distraught to tell Mildred about Veda's latest escapade, takes her to Wally's nightclub, where Veda performs as a lounge singer. After seeing several sailors in the audience wolf-whistle at Veda in her sexy costume, Mildred begs her to come home. Still, Veda sneers and says her mother can never give her the lifestyle she deserves. Desperate to reconcile with her daughter, Mildred coaxes Monte into a loveless marriage to improve her social status, with Monte's price being a one-third share of Mildred's business to allow him to settle his debts. Veda, eager to live out her dream as a debutante, pretends to reconcile with her mother and moves into Beragon's lavish mansion. Eventually, the cost of supporting Monte and Veda's rich lifestyles, and Monte's underhanded ploy to retain his share in the business while causing his wife to forfeit her own, bankrupts Mildred, forcing her to sell the restaurant chain. After driving to his beach house to confront Monte, Mildred finds Veda in his arms. Veda scornfully tells her mother that Monte intends to marry her after divorcing Mildred, who runs to her car in tears. When Monte tells Veda he would never marry her because she is a \\"rotten little tramp,\\" she shoots him. Veda begs her mother to help conceal the murder; Mildred reluctantly agrees. Fed up with Wally's misdeeds--helping Veda blackmail the Forresters, hiring her to sing in his seedy nightclub, assenting to Monte's business move against her making constant sexual overtures toward her--Mildred tries to pin the murder on Wally by luring him to the beach house. Police officers arrest Wally when he flees in panic after seeing Monte's body. Still, the investigating officer tells Mildred that Wally cannot be the killer because he has no motive. Back in the present, the detectives admit they knew all along that Veda committed the murder. Mildred tries to apologize as her daughter is led away to jail, but Veda rebuffs her. Mildred leaves the police station to find Bert waiting for her outside. Cast Comparison to the novel Although James M. Cain was often labeled a \\"hard- boiled crime writer\\", his novel Mildred Pierce (1941) was mostly a psychological work, with little violence. The adaptation, released four years later, was designed as a thriller, and a murder was introduced into the plot. The novel spans nine years (from 1931 to 1940), whereas the film is set from 1939 to the 1940s and spans only four years. Its characters do not age as a consequence. Mildred's physical appearance does not change, although her costumes become more elegant as her business grows. Veda ages from around 13 to 17. Mildred is more of a tycoon in the film; her restaurants are glamorous places, and she owns a whole chain (\\"Mildred's\\") instead of the novel's three. Evil, spoiled Veda, who is prodigiously talented and brilliantly devious in the novel, is somewhat less formidable in the film. All references to the Depression and the Prohibition era, which are important in the novel, are absent from the screenplay. The plot is simplified and the number of characters reduced. Veda's training and success as a singer (including her performance at the Hollywood Bowl) were dropped in the film and her music teachers only mentioned in passing. Lucy Gessler, a key character in the novel and Mildred's good friend, is eliminated. Ida, Mildred's boss at the restaurant where she works as a waitress, is given much of Gessler's wise- cracking personality. Monte does not die in the novel, and Veda never goes to jail. The murder portion of the story was invented by the filmmakers because the censorship code of that time required evildoers to be punished for their misdeeds. The 2011 HBO miniseries, Mildred Pierce, follows the novel more faithfully in this respect. Production The working title for Mildred Pierce was House on the Sand;\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com and filming began on December 7, 1944.\\"Mildred Pierce\\" on TCM.com Ralph Bellamy, Donald Woods, and George Coulouris were considered for the role of Bert, while Bonita Granville, Virginia Weidler, and Martha Vickers were considered for Veda. Scenes for the film were shot in Glendale, California and Malibu, California. Permission had to be granted from the U.S. Navy to shoot in Malibu because of wartime restrictions. In 1942, two years earlier, Joan Crawford had been released from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer due to a mutual agreement. Crawford campaigned for the lead role in Mildred Pierce, which most lead actresses did not want because of the implied age as mother of a teenage daughter. Warner Bros. and director Michael Curtiz had originally wanted Bette Davis to play the title role, but she declined. Curtiz did not want Crawford to play the part. He campaigned for Barbara Stanwyck, who was working on My Reputation (1946) at the time. When he learned that Stanwyck was not, however, going to be cast, he then tried to recruit either Olivia de Havilland or Joan Fontaine to play Mildred, although both were only in their twenties. He ultimately approved Crawford's casting after seeing her screen test. Even so, the director and the star were often at odds on the set, with producer Jerry Wald acting as peacemaker.Ben Mankowitz, intro to the Turner Classic Movies presentation of Mildred Pierce on February 3, 2013 Reception =Box Office= The film was a box office success. According to Warner Bros. it earned $3,483,000 domestically and $2,155,000 foreign. =Critical response= Joan Crawford's performance garnered widespread critical acclaim. Contemporary reviews praised Crawford's performance but had mixed opinions about other aspects of the film. A review in The New York Times said that although Crawford gave \\"a sincere and generally effective characterization,\\" the film \\"lacks the driving force of stimulating drama,\\" and it did \\"not seem reasonable that a level-headed person like Mildred Pierce, who builds a fabulously successful chain of restaurants on practically nothing, could be so completely dominated by a selfish and grasping daughter, who spells trouble in capital letters.\\" The staff at Variety liked the film, especially the screenplay, and wrote, > At first reading James M. Cain's novel of the same title might not suggest > screenable material, but the cleanup job has resulted in a class feature, > showmanly produced by Jerry Wald and tellingly directed by Michael Curtiz > ... The dramatics are heavy but so skillfully handled that they never cloy. > Joan Crawford reaches a peak of her acting career in this pic.

Film review, 1945. Last accessed: February 7, > 2008. Harrison's Reports wrote that Crawford gave a \\"good performance\\", but the story \\"lacks conviction, and the main characterizations are overdrawn. For example, the daughter's hatred for her mother has no logical basis, consequently, it weakens the story.\\" John McCarten of The New Yorker wrote: > Certainly, despite its unconscionable length ‚Äî it takes almost two hours ‚Äî > 'Mildred Pierce' contains enough excitement to jolt even the most lethargic > customer ... it is pleasant to report that Miss Crawford is no longer as > frantic in appearance as she once was.

Historian June Sochen (1978) argues the film lies at the intersection of the \\"weepie\\" and \\"independent woman\\" genres of the 1930s and 1940s. It accentuates common ground of the two: women must be submissive, live through others, and remain in the home.June Sochen, \\"'Mildred Pierce' and Women in Film,\\" American Quarterly, Jan 1978, Vol. 30 Issue 1, pp. 3‚Äì20, in JSTOR The film currently holds a score of 86% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 42 reviews, with an average rating of 7.98/10.

Separate actresses portray Veda at different ages, as opposed to Ann Blyth alone in the 1945 film. Wally Fay's character in the original has been changed back to the novel's Wally Burgan, and is portrayed by James LeGros. The cast also includes Melissa Leo as Mildred's neighbor and friend, Lucy Gessler, a character omitted from the Crawford version. The film is told in chronological order with no flashbacks or voice-over narration, and eliminates the murder subplot that was added for the 1945 version. Mildred Pierce in popular culture =In movies= The movie Mommie Dearest mentions the screen test Crawford (played by Faye Dunaway) must endure, a rehearsal scene at her home for the movie, a portrayal of her at home during the Academy Awards radio broadcast announcing the 1945 winners, and her acceptance speech outside her home for a team of reporters. =In television= In 1976, the ninth episode of the tenth season of The Carol Burnett Show featured a take- off of the film called \\"Mildred Fierce\\", with Carol Burnett as Mildred, Vicki Lawrence as Veda and Harvey Korman as Monte. In the third episode of The Deuce, \\"The Principle Is All\\", Darlene watches Mildred Pierce with one of her regulars. =In music= The eighth track on the 1990 album Goo by alternative rock band Sonic Youth is an instrumental called \\"Mildred Pierce\\". =Other= Gainesville, Florida restaurant Mildred's Big City Food is named after the film's titular character.

Johnstown Traction Company (JTC) was a public transit system in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, United States. For most of its existence it was primarily a street-railway system, but in later years also operated rubber-tired vehicles. JTC operated trolley (tram) service in Johnstown from February 23, 1910 to June 11, 1960.

They are abundant within their range, but rarely seen due to their secretive nature.Schmidt, K.P., and D.D. Davis. 1941. Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. G.P. Putnam's Sons. New York. 365 pp. (Carphophis amoena vermis, pp. 102-104, Figure 20.) Reproduction Little is known about their mating habits, but breeding likely occurs in the early spring. Eggs are laid in the early summer. Clutch size is normally 1-8 eggs, and hatching takes place in August or September. Hatchlings range in size from in total length. Diet The worm snake's diet consists almost entirely of earthworms, but it will also consume soft-bodied insects. Defense If harassed, it will often release foul smelling musk from its cloaca. If handled, it may press its tail tip into the captor's hand as a defense mechanism. References Further reading * Behler, J.L., and F.W. King. 1979.

It generally refers to the extent of continental, rather than alpine, glaciers. In the northern hemisphere, glaciers advanced from the north during the Pleistocene epoch. The glacial boundary thus represents the farthest southern extent of the glaciers at that time. In North America, the boundary from the most recent ice sheet passes through the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington. It also crosses the Canada‚ÄìUS border in several locations. See Timeline of glaciation. See the U.S. National Atlas for a map of the boundary in North America.

Occupying the spot of an ancient Greek settlement (Tavrida-Œ§Œ±œÖœÅŒØŒ¥Œ±), Masandra was acquired by Counts Potocki in 1783. In the mid-19th century, it passed to Prince Vorontsov Jr, whose father was the governor of New Russia. Enraptured by a picturesque setting, Vorontsov in 1881 engaged a team of French architects to design for him a ch√¢teau in the Louis XIII style. He died the following year and construction work was suspended until 1889, when the messuage was purchased by Alexander III of Russia. The tsar asked architect Maximilian Messmacher to finish the palace for his own use but he did not live to see it completed in 1900. During the Soviet years, the palace was employed by Joseph Stalin as his dacha. Today, Masandra is known for its viniculture and production of dessert and fortified wines.

Released on 13 November 2001 through Inside Out Music, it is the first album to feature guitarist Henrik Danhage and bassist Michael H√•kansson, as well as the only one to feature keyboardist Sven Karlsson. Recording and concept The album was recorded at Los Angered Studios in Gothenburg, Sweden from January to April 2001. Production was handled by Andy LaRocque who had previously produced all earlier Evergrey albums. LaRocque also contributed musically, playing slide guitar. It is the last album he produced for the band, although he engineered the following album, Recreation Day. The song \\"Dark Waters\\" features the Mercury Choir on vocals, who also performed on the previous album, Solitude, Dominance, Tragedy. As with most Evergrey albums, female vocals were contributed by Carina Kjellberg. Although the album does not have a title track, the lyrics \\"in search of the shocking truth\\" are featured in the song \\"Watching the Skies\\". The album is a concept album dealing with alien abductions, primarily based on and inspired by the allegedly factual account of alien abduction victim Whitley Strieber's book Communion. Speaking of the influence of the book, frontman Tom S. Englund stated: > \\"That book really affected me deeply and I think it's very sincere and > honest book and no matter what you think about it serves as an introduction. > This man believes he has been experiencing something in that way and that > it's the most important thing that you got to think about. You know that he > believes this all happened to him. So you gotta respect his ideas and cause > for that. On this album I tend to reflect more on the personal level of him > and try to reflect more on the emotional side of the character - his fears, > sadness and all that.\\" The album cover was created by Swedish graphic designer Mattias Nor√©n. Reception and legacy The album received favorable reviews. AllMusic stated that \\"the overall picture is that of a very well-crafted concept album that certainly should please fans of progressive metal\\", and noted of the concept: \\"rather than addressing the subject in a cheesy sort of universal mode, though, it is the story of one man's struggle to understand what is happening to him. The lyrics, and the strong delivery by vocalist Tom S. Englund, convey the confusion, fear, and sense of helplessness splendidly.\\" Metal Storm praised it as \\"full of fresh ideas and perfect in their complexity\\" and \\"undoubtedly the best prog album of the year\\". Sputnikmusic gave it a perfect 10/10 score, saying that \\"odd time signatures and extremely technical riffs bounce off of haunting keyboard lines and severely dark stylings in perfect harmony, creating a sound that has yet to be matched.\\" The album debuted on the Swedish Albums Chart at No. 59 and stayed on the chart for 11 weeks. Since the album's release, it has been critically acclaimed and is generally considered to be the band's 'magnum opus' as well as one of the best progressive metal albums ever made. Loudwire placed the album at No. 20 on its list \\"Top 25 Progressive Metal Albums of All Time.\\" To celebrate its 10th anniversary, the album was played in its entirety at the ProgPower USA Festival in Atlanta, Georgia on 15 September 2011. Speaking of the event, frontman Tom Englund said: \\"Glenn [Harveston, ProgPower USA festival promoter] asked me for a special show,‚Ä¶.what else is new as he always does‚Ä¶ hrmpff. So to pay tribute to one of our most loved albums, we decided to celebrate the tenth anniversary of 'In Search Of Truth' by playing the whole damned thing. This will be an exclusive for Atlanta and the ProgPower USA show alone.\\" A remastered version of the album, titled In Search of Truth: Remasters Edition, was released in 2019, featuring live versions of the songs \\"Rulers of the Mind\\", \\"Mark of the Triangle\\" and \\"Misled\\"; \\"Misled\\" had previously been released on the live album A Night to Remember in 2005. The original recordings were remastered by Jacob Hansen, who produced the band's 2014 album Hymns for the Broken. Track listing Personnel *Tom S.
