Upon his father's death, he inherited the title of Marquis de Maintenon. He chose not to follow in the footsteps of his ancestors and joined the Navy in 1669 and arrived in the Caribbean on La Sybille. He took command of the ship after the death of her captain in 1672. He joined the expedition against Cura√ßao and attacked British ships near Saint-Domingue. He returned to France in 1673, and in 1674, he sold the Maintenon estate to Fran√ßoise d'Aubign√©, who was granted the title of Marquise de Maintenon by King Louis in 1675. After the sale, d'Angennes returned to the West Indies. In October 1675, d'Angennes left Nantes as commander of the 24 gun ship Fontaine d'Or. He gathered a fleet of ten ships crewed by 800 buccaneers and in 1676 attacked Isla Margarita, Trinidad and Cuman√°. He became a sugar planter and was appointed governor of the island of Marie-Galante (1679‚Äì1686). During this period, he hunted down his former buccaneer allies on the French naval ship La Sorci√®re.

GPA attempts to solve two frequently cited problems with OPS. First, OPS gives equal weight to its two components, on-base percentage (OBP) and slugging percentage (SLG). In fact, OBP contributes significantly more to scoring runs than SLG does. Sabermetricians have calculated that OBP is about 80% more valuable than SLG. A second problem with OPS is that it generates numbers on a scale unfamiliar to most baseball fans. For all the problems with a traditional stat like batting average (AVG), baseball fans immediately know that a player batting .365 is significantly better than average, while a player batting .167 is significantly below average. But many fans do not immediately know how good a player with a 1.013 OPS is. The basic formula for GPA is: \\\\frac{{(1.8)OBP} + SLG}{4} Unlike OPS, this formula both gives proper relative weight to its two component statistics and generates a number that falls on a scale similar to the familiar batting average scale.

He first appeared in JLA Secret Files 2004 # 1 (November 2004), and was created by Dan Slott and Dan Jurgens. Publication history The Red King's first historical appearance was in JLA Secret Files 2004 #1 (November 2004), set up to tie into an arc in the main JLA book. But the 4th Parallel arc in which he is introduced was shelved for three years until JLA Classified #32-36 which were published bi-weekly in January, February and March 2007. Fictional character biography Darrin Profitt just happened to be one of six billion innocent bystanders in the dreamscape during a battle between the Justice League and Doctor Destiny. After the defeat of Doctor Destiny on the dreamplane, the Materioptikon gem on his chest sucks him inside and falls at the feet of Darrin Profitt's dreamself. Doctor Destiny's physical body is rendered catatonic and the Justice League wake up, the Martian Manhunter turns Destiny's body over to the custody of Arkham Asylum. Darrin Profitt discovers that the gem is in his possession, and is accidentally sucked inside the artifact where he meets Doctor Destiny's trapped consciousness.JLA Classified #32 (March 2007) According to Doctor Destiny, the Materioptikon has the ability to reshape reality, but it is flawed, anyone who enters the gem automatically generates multiple physical copies from multiple possible universes, splitting that person up among these universes. Also according to Doctor Destiny space and time was never meant to do this, using the gem in this fashion threatens the spacetime continuum. Destiny created special tools that re-integrate his own multiples and those of anyone else who enters the gem. In order to return to the real world without damaging reality, and generating any more dangerous alternate universes, Destiny stated that he had to repair all six billion flaws in the gem. Every time he repaired a flaw, he destroyed one of many possible universes and in all of them his body remained catatonic and dreaming in Arkham Asylum. Profitt overpowers Destiny and traps him in a facet of the gem, he then creates a few duplicates of himself using Doctor Destiny's tools and sends them out to place a bet at the race track and then invest that money in stocks, both the winners and losers return to the gem and report their results, he then uses the favorable results in his own reality. According to Doctor Destiny he endangered all of reality, all of Space and Time so that he could win a bet at the track. Darrin uses the Parallels to create favorable outcomes by sending his duplicates into a Parallel to test for a specific outcome; if they fail, he deletes that Parallel, but if they succeed, he uses their solution. Darrin used the billions he'd made from manipulating the stock market via the Parallels to become a billionaire philanthropist and playboy. =Becoming the King= Due to boredom and in answer to a challenge posed by Doctor Destiny, he used the Parallels to acquire technology capable of defeating the Justice League and conquering the world. Under the guise of altruism his alternates prompt the scientists of their worlds to develop protocols for jamming JLA teleporters in case the Justice League Watchtower is compromised, telepathic shields, satellites for tracking metahumans, cutting edge weapons and armor to take down H.I.V.E. cells, strategies for defeating alien invaders, renegade Green Lanterns, rampaging Bizarros, and rogue speedsters, countermeasures against Themysciran magic in the event of an Amazon Attack, plans to construct and defuse theoretical doomsday devices, and ways to isolate, reproduce, and implant the metagene in ordinary humans. The parallel Red Kings share their knowledge and in the end the Darrin Profitts of the three final realities of the Materioptikon don their liquid metal Red King armor and set out to conquer their realities. According to Profitt his three-to-one chances for success are very good odds. Profitt secretly kept a fourth Parallel hidden from Doctor Destiny in the event that the three Red Kings failed, this fourth Parallel's Profitt wore a different costume and called himself Fallback.JLA Classified #33 (March 2007) This Profitt had a world in which he never changed anything from his life, and lived in the same state as he was before Doctor Destiny's battle, serving as a \\"reset switch\\" that would allow Profitt to go back to his beginnings if something failed. He was executed by another Red King, who had no interest in becoming a loser again. =Third Parallel= In the Third Parallel the Red King (3) uses one of his uncounted metahuman abilities to direct a swarm of meteors towards Earth. The unexpected kinetic bombardment wipes Keystone City and Central City off the map, killing the entire population of both cities along with Batman and Plastic Man. The Red King (3) injects Superman with a newly created Bizarro virus that rapidly mutates him taking away his intellect. He then taps into the JLA Satellite's teleporter and scatters the League around the planet. He hits Wally West with a beam that takes away his protective aura, so that the very act of running damages him faster than his healing factor can keep up with. He then beheads Wonder Woman, crushes the Flash's chest, and smashes John Stewart. He then defeats an assembly of responding heroes including the Justice Society of America, Booster Gold and Doctor Fate, all of whom he refers to as \\"a collection of second stringers, benchwarmers and amateurs\\". He heads to Metropolis and calls out Superman, who can no longer think clearly due to the Bizarro virus. He is then blindsided by Batman, Flash, Green Lantern, and Wonder Woman in an attack co-ordinated by the Martian Manhunter who had faked their deaths, and assisted by Superman. Impatient and angry, the Red King (3) releases a massive blast wave which vaporizes all the remaining League members leaving only the Batman who was apparently the Martian Manhunter masquerading as the dead hero. The Red King (3) incinerates the Martian Manhunter, and then sits in the ruins of Metropolis until nightfall. According to his assistant, his blast wave destroyed every city on the planet and no one will ever trust him. The Red King (3) abandons that reality and then erases it from the Materioptikon.JLA Classified #35 (April 2007) =Second Parallel= The Red King (2) confronts the JLA, from JLA Classified #34. Artist Dan Jurgens In the Second Parallel, the Red King (2) projects a hologram above the city of Metropolis demanding the unconditional surrender of all Earth's governments or else he will trigger a Doomsday device and destroy the planet. During the middle of his speech the device prematurely activates apparently killing him, and the hologram disappears. Superman and the League discover that they have ninety-eight hours to evacuate the Earth. Superman, Green Lantern, the Martian Manhunter and Wonder Woman use their powers and advanced Kryptonian technology to terraform Mars. The Martian Manhunter links Wonder Woman's mind to that of everyone on Earth so she can tell them of the coming evacuation. Superman puts every criminal on Earth into the Phantom Zone. The Flash (Wally West) and Plastic Man collect samples of every plant on Earth. Aquaman and John Stewart move most of Earth's oceans and sea life to the newly terraformed Mars. Wonder Woman talks Earth's animals into peacefully co-existing on an alien \\"interstellar ark\\" until they get to Mars. Superman and Ray Palmer use White Dwarf Star Matter to shrink fifty-eight of Earth's most important cities and place them in bottles like Kandor, including Metropolis but not Central City or Keystone City. A fleet of alien ships summoned by the Green Lantern Corps help evacuate the planet but not everyone makes it off, Batman apparently dies as the planet explodes while confronting the Red King (2) near the center of the Earth; just before he dies, Profitt apologizes for his mistake.JLA Classified #34 (April 2007) Back on Mars, Batman returns alive with Profitt and his main accomplice; he then informs the League of what they need to do in order to stop the other Red Kings and do it before one of the other Red Kings erase their reality. =First Parallel= This attempt to take over a Parallel by the Red King (1) begins well, the plan being to be asked and allowed to rule the world rather than to take it by force. This version helps the JLA defeat a newly empowered version of the Royal Flush Gang on two separate occasions, after the second battle he is invited to become a member by Superman. Red King (1) begins to have a light romantic relationship with Wonder Woman that blooms once she learns he is Profitt (which in this Parallel was solving world hunger and had already known her for sometime). When Superman expressed some concern that Red King (1) possessed too much power for any one person, Green Lantern (John Stewart), stated that Red King (1) \\"probably wouldn‚Äôt even bother\\" working with the League if it wasn‚Äôt for Wonder Woman. The Martian Manhunter stated that he couldn‚Äôt read Red King's mind, but Red King (1) genuinely seemed to care for Wonder Woman and she trusted him, so they decided they should trust him as well. This Parallel's League soon learned of the truth behind the Red King (1) when Batman learned the comatose Doctor Destiny had been repeating his name over and over; Dee then awakened and told him the truth about the Parallels, and ultimately the JLA attacked Profitt. Red King (1) defended himself but made an effort to solve the situation without violence, (asking them to surrender) but just then the third Parallel‚Äôs Red King (3) arrived and demanded to merge with Red King (1). Red King (1) refused saying that he had changed his mind, but the other Red King (3) forced the merge regardless. =Downfall= Though he had stayed clear of the core reality, the Justice League indigenous to the Second Parallel realize its existence, the truth about their own being nothing but a facet in the Materioptikon, and the fact that the Second Parallel had to be destroyed to protect the core reality. However, to counter this, the Second Parallel Justice League retrieved their own Materioptikon from their reality's defeated Red King; using the power of the stone, they sent their reality's Plastic Man over to the other reality to communicate with their counterparts in there to do battle with that reality's Red King. This Plastic Man ended up in the First Parallel after releasing Doctor Destiny in the hub world of the Materioptikon, where he posed as a bomb similar to the one which destroyed the Earth in the Second Parallel. The Red King (3) was cornered in the JLA's base in the moon, where he was duped into believing the bomb would kill him if he could not defeat the entire Justice League in under a minute, with time to get away clear of the blast. With the Martian Manhunter manipulating his emotions, he had no escape, and was tricked by the First Parallel's League into a vortex to the core reality generated by the First Parallel's Materioptikon. That reality's Wonder Woman crushed the stone, destroying the link between the final Parallel and the Materioptikon and sealing Profitt within the core reality's Materioptikon, where Destiny's dreamself, free to roam at his leisure, prepares to torture the Red King with his now omnipotent powers, having sealed all of the gem's flaws and completing it as the true Materioptikon. Powers and abilities *According to JLA Classified #35 he has over 63 different metahuman abilities including electrokinesis and cryokinesis. *Using Doctor Destiny's Materioptikon Darrin is able to create mathematically modeled parallel earths. He is able to generate a finite number of Parallels, parallel universes generated by the Materioptikon but based on his home reality. Profitt uses the parallels as elaborate mathematical models, testbeds to determine favorable outcomes for his plans. Since the Materioptikon's power comes from the absorbed dream energy of six billion humans, every use of this power diminishes the number of available Parallels that can be generated and maintained; Profitt was unaware of this until he had destroyed all but four of the Parallels. *As the Red King he also wears a suit of high tech armor which incorporates technology solutions gathered from dozens of parallels designed to defeat individual members of the Justice League; as noted by Superman, he had the necessary strength to defeat all of them in the long term. *As Fallback he might have had powers, but was unable to use them as another Red King killed him before he could demonstrate them.

The Des Moines Rapids between Nauvoo, Illinois and Keokuk, Iowa-Hamilton, Illinois is one of two major rapids on the Mississippi River that limited Steamboat traffic on the river through the early 19th century. The rapids just above the confluence of the Des Moines River were to contribute to the Honey War in the 1830s between Missouri and Iowa over the Sullivan Line that separates the two states. Various attempts to make the river navigable started in 1837 when a channel was blasted through the rapids by U.S. Army Corps of Engineers team led by Robert E. Lee. A canal around the rapids was built in 1877. It is now obliterated by Lock and Dam No. 19. The other major rapids barring traffic on the Mississippi is the Rock Island Rapids. The Mississippi in its natural state widens from to in width at Nauvoo as it drops over over shallow limestone rocks to the confluence with Des Moines. According to records its mean depth through the rapids was and \\"much less\\" in many places. Beginning in 1804 United States government- sponsored trading posts for Native Americans as part of the Native American factory system began being built at the rapids. Forts were associated with the trading posts including Fort Johnson, Fort Madison. The forts were burned during the War of 1812. After the war Fort Edward was established and commanded by Jefferson Davis. In 1816 U.S. Government surveyor John C. Sullivan surveyed a line stretching north from the confluence of the Kansas River with the Missouri River in Kansas City, Missouri and then back east to the Des Moines River. The distance matched the rapids but when Missouri entered the Union in 1820 its constitution instead referred to the Sullivan line as \\"the parallel of latitude which passes through the rapids of the River Des Moines.\\" Missouri did not attempt to clarify the mistake even when the Iowa (tribe), Sauk and Fox (tribe) ceded all land \\"in Missouri\\" along the line from the Mississippi to the Indian Territory Line (Sullivan's line going north from the Kansas) in 1824. This created the Half-Breed Tract. When interest in the rapids increased in the late 1830s as work began on making the rapids navigable, along with Iowa's beginning the process of entering as a state, Missouri took an interest in asserting control of the west side of the rapids. However, thwarted by its constitution which clearly stated the Des Moines River was the border, it instead asserted that there were no rapids where the Sullivan line crossed the Des Moines and conducted a new survey which said the rapids of the Des Moines were about north, near Keosauqua, Iowa, and attempted to collect taxes in the area. This prompted the bloodless Honey War, with Iowa resisting the effort. The Supreme Court was to ultimately decide in State of Missouri v. State of Iowa, 48 U.S. 660 (1849), that Iowa's southern boundary was the foot of the rapids at modern day Keokuk (although accepting the Sullivan Line for the rest of the border from about west).

Eastwood (born 3 December 1965) is a former Rugby League International goal kicking winger who played for Hull FC and Hull Kingston Rovers between 1984 and 1996. He also made 18 test appearances for the Great Britain between 1990 and 1992. Background Eastwood was born in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England Career Paul Eastwood was signed by Hull F.C. as a teenager and made his first appearance for them in 1984. Eastwood played , i.e. number 5, in Hull FC's 24-31 defeat by Castleford in the 1986 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1986‚Äì87 season at Headingley, Leeds on Saturday 11 October 1986.1986 Yorkshire Cup Final He set up the second try for Russ Walker as Hull F.C. won the 1991 Premiership final against Widnes at Old Trafford.1991 RFL Premiership Final After 10 seasons with Hull, Eastwood finished his career with local rivals Hull Kingston Rovers and, as of 2007, worked as the manager of a plumbing and heating company BSS in Manchester. By his own admission he was never the type of winger who would score length of the field tries, but his nuggety strength saw him cross for 117 tries in his English club career while his accurate goal kicking saw him as a valuable player at both club and test match level. Eastwood's Testimonial match at Hull F.C. took place in 1994 at their home ground, The Boulevard. International Eastwood won the first of his 18 test and World Cup caps for Great Britain against Papua New Guinea in Goroka during the 1990 Great Britain Lions tour as the Lions suffered a shock 20‚Äì18 defeat by the Kumuls. He would score the first of his 7 test tries in the game at the Danny Leahy Oval. Later that year played in all three Ashes series tests against the touring Australians, scoring 2 tries in the Lions 19‚Äì12 win in the opening test at Wembley Stadium. In the second test at Old Trafford he missed two pressure, but relatively simple goals that could have won Britain The Ashes for the first time since 1970, as Australia won a tense game 14‚Äì10. After hooking an earlier conversion attempt, when Paul Loughlin scored an intercept try Eastwood, a left foot kicker, asked the St. Helens goal kicking centre if he wanted to take the kick (which was in almost the same spot as his earlier attempt) which suited his right foot kicking. Loughlin however declined and Eastwood ultimately sliced his kick to the left of the posts. Had it gone over it would have given the Lions a 12‚Äì10 lead with just 10 minutes remaining. Australia would go on to win the third and deciding test 14‚Äì0 at the Elland Road stadium in Leeds. Eastwood was selected to go on the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia, playing in 5 of the 6 test matches on the tour (one against PNG and 2 each against Australia and New Zealand). With 58 points from 3 tries and 23 goals, Eastwood was the leading point scorer on tour. While in Australia, Eastwood came under fan and media criticism for the amount of time he took with his goal kicks. He kicked at around 80% accuracy during his 8 games on tour. He played the last of his 18 tests, kicking 3 goals in Great Britain's 19‚Äì16 win over New Zealand at Carlaw Park in Auckland on 19 July 1992.New Zealand vs Great Britain, Second Test 1992 References External links *!Great Britain Statistics at englandrl.co.uk (statistics currently missing due to not having appeared for both Great Britain, and England) *(archived by web.archive.org) Meninga saves the day *(archived by web.archive.org) When Britain defeated the Aussies *(archived by web.archive.org) \\"Caught in time - Hull win 1991 RL Premiership\\" 1965 births English rugby league players Great Britain national rugby league team players Hull F.C. players Hull Kingston Rovers players Living people Rugby league wingers Sportspeople from Kingston upon Hull ","title":"Paul Eastwood"},{"id":"9714335","text":"Anthony Stephen King (17 November 1934 ‚Äì 12 January 2017) was a Canadian- British professor of government, psephologist and commentator.

(short for \\"Zero Population Growth\\") is a 1972 Danish-American dystopian science fiction film directed by Michael Campus and starring Oliver Reed and Geraldine Chaplin. It is inspired by the non-fiction best-selling book The Population Bomb by Paul R. Ehrlich. The film concerns an overpopulated future Earth, whose world government executes those who violate a 30-year ban on having children. Filmed in Denmark, the film is almost entirely set-bound featuring art direction designed to reflect a bleak, oppressive future. Plot Set in the future, the Earth has become severely polluted (people need to wear breathing masks when outside) with severe overpopulation affecting available resources. Because of the permanent thick smog that has settled over the dismal cities that now cover the Earth‚Äôs entire surface, all animals ‚Äì even common household pets - are extinct; people eat tasteless bright-colored paste out of plastic containers. To reduce the world's population, the world's government decrees that no children may be conceived for the next 30 years. Breaking this law will result in a death penalty for both the parents as well as the newborn. Brainwashing and robot substitutes are used to end the yearning for children, with the death penalty as the ultimate deterrent, by being placed under a plastic dome and suffocated to death. Couples of child-bearing age visit \\"Babyland\\" and are given life- size animatronic children instead. Russ (Oliver Reed) and Carol McNeil (Geraldine Chaplin) work in a museum recreating life in the 20th century. Carol is desperate for a child and when she conceives she avoids the abortion machine installed in their bathroom to remain pregnant. After the child's birth, the couple must shield the baby from being discovered. Once Carol decides to break the law and have a baby, they must not only avoid the prying eyes of the Big Brother-like government, but also the growing jealousy of their own friends. Neighbors finding a couple with a real child will go into the streets screaming \\"baby, baby,\\" until authorities show up. When neighbours George (Don Gordon) and Edna Borden (Diane Cilento) find out about the baby, their initial offer to help conceal the baby leads quickly to trouble. Jealousy and envy arises as the Bordens want to share the baby as if it is a new car. The McNeils and the Bordens begin to fight over the baby and the Bordens then seek to keep the child for themselves. Finally, the McNeils are captured and placed under one of the state's execution domes, but the couple, along with the baby, manage to escape by digging underground, making their way through darkened tunnels in a raft to a remote island where there is no visible pollution. However, the whole island may lay in a radioactive state, as it was used to bury old nuclear missiles in 1978.

A year prior to the film's release, Max Ehrlich published the science fiction novel, The Edict, based on the screenplay. In the novel, the earth's resources have been strained to the limit, and in many parts of the world cannibalism and food riots are commonplace. Seeking a solution to this crisis, the leaders of WorldGov meet in emergency session. Their computers spin through billions of facts, and the reports are more than disquieting - they are chilling. Further growth of the population is unthinkable, and the leaders finally settle on the only possible solution, which is soon announced by the World Gov satellite: To give the world some semblance of normalcy, realistic mechanical babies are devised to pacify the maternal instincts of 10 billion women. But to Carol, the very idea of accepting one of the robot infants is abhorrent. She wants and needs a real child, and this slowly becomes an obsession. Special effects Derek Meddings created the life-size realistic animatronic children for the film. Awards Geraldine Chaplin won Best Actress at the 1972 Sitges Film Festival for her performance.

He is voiced by Takahiro Sakurai and his younger self is voiced by Akeno Watanabe. Character outline Suzaku Kururugi, born on July 10, 2000 a.t.b., is the son of Japan's last prime minister, Genbu Kururugi. His existence was kept a secret from the public until after the war. Suzaku met Lelouch vi Britannia and his sister Nunnally vi Britannia when they moved to the Kururugi residence as a diplomatic peace trade. At first, Suzaku despised Lelouch because he thought that he was a prince who didn't care about anyone. As time passed by, however, he came to know Lelouch better, and they soon became best friends. They become separated when Britannia invaded Japan, but are reunited in the Shinjuku Ghetto. When Britannia began its invasion of Japan, Suzaku was mortified by the violence and his father's belief that resisting to the bitter end was preferable to surrender. Unable to change his father's mind, Suzaku murdered him during a heated exchange. The incident was covered up and Suzaku's life was spared, while the government was thrown into disarray and surrendered to Britannia. Lelouch believes that, had Genbu lived, Japan would have likely been torn apart by war once the other major powers decided to intervene. His guilt over the incident causes Suzaku to constantly place himself on the frontlines in the hope of atoning for his actions with his death. It also inspires his belief that the ends achieved with immoral means are meaningless, since he created peace through murder. However, after firing the F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead, under the command of Lelouch's Geass, he abandons this belief and decides to achieve his goals regardless of the means. This causes him to finally join Lelouch. Character history =First season= Suzaku is introduced in the first episode of the series as an Honorary Britannian soldier. While searching the Shinjuku ghetto for poison gas stolen by resistance members, he finds Lelouch standing next to it. He refuses to carry out an order to kill Lelouch, and is shot by his superior officer for his insubordination. However, the bullet is stopped by a broken pocket watch belonging to his deceased father. Lancelot While recovering from his injuries at the command center, Suzaku is approached by Lloyd Asplund and offered a chance to pilot the experimental Knightmare Frame Lancelot, since the pilot that Lloyd had originally been looking for was already on the front lines. The Lancelot's advanced systems combined with his unprecedented piloting skill allow him to almost single-handedly dismantle Lelouch's plan to rout the massacre of Shinjuku ghetto, but he finds himself under arrest afterward for the murder of Prince Clovis; though Lelouch was in fact responsible for this, the military used him as a scapegoat since they had no suspect, citing his Japanese heritage as motive in spite of his Honorary Britannian status. Lelouch rescues Suzaku from his impending execution by assuming the identity of Zero and taking credit for Clovis' murder, forcing the military to acquit Suzaku due to lack of evidence. He asks Suzaku to join his cause, but Suzaku refuses. While he agrees with Zero on the latter's assertion that the Britannian Empire is corrupt and not worth serving, he wants to change and improve the Empire from within, to show that his father's death was not in vain. From this point on, Suzaku remains the pilot of the Lancelot. He is reunited with Lelouch and Nunnally after enrolling into Ashford Academy at Euphemia's suggestion. His rank within the military is initially Private, but he is promoted to Warrant Officer by Cornelia li Britannia when she first arrives in Japan. He is appointed as Euphemia's personal Knight, granting him the rank of Major, after a televised battle with the Black Knights makes his occupation public knowledge. This ruins Lelouch's plan to have Suzaku protect Nunnally once his role as Zero took him away from Area 11. During the battle on Shikine Island, in which Suzaku is ordered to sacrifice himself to kill Zero, Lelouch is forced to use the power of Geass on Suzaku in order to escape destruction, and commands him to \\"live,\\" forcing him to survive by any means from then on. Suzaku falls in love with Euphemia, and thus is emotionally crushed by her murder at Zero's hands. He is visited by V.V., who explains Zero's power of Geass to him, which drives him to find and kill Zero at all costs. He follows Lelouch to Kamine and confirms his identity, admitting that he had tried to convince himself that Zero and Lelouch were not the same person. Lelouch tries to offer Suzaku a truce in order to rescue Nunnally, but Suzaku is too swept up in his grief to care. Enraged, Suzaku insists that Lelouch's very existence is a mistake; one he intends to correct. Lelouch draws his pistol and both men attempt to shoot one another, at which point the screen fades to black and the season ends with the sound of a single gunshot. =Akito The Exiled= Suzaku makes his debut in Episode 2 of the OVA, The Wyvern Divided. He was revealed along with C.C. during the preview of Episode 2. Suzaku is a Knight of Round in this OVA. He is seen accompanying Julius Kingsley, arriving at St. Petersburg. This was ordered by the Emperor. In OVA 3, Suzaku's Lancelot's shield is adorned with a custom made Knight Of Honor emblem to honor Euphemia. Julius and Suzaku were granted authority to take command of Euro Britannia thanks to the Imperial Sceptre granted by the Emperor. Suzaku continues to show hostility towards Julius Kingsley. Later Julius launches his campaign \\"World Liberation Ark Fleet\\" as a ruse to causes chaos amongst the E.U. This causes a feud between the higher ups of E.U. regarding innocents and as a result, the Archduke of Verance was arrested thanks to Shin's support. While Julius and Shin were playing chess, Suzaku stood by until Julius started to breakdown. Shin later confirms that Julius is a terrorist Zero and that Suzaku is the greatest proof. Suzaku pointed a gun at him by refuting the fact and that Zero was executed by the Emperor but regardless Shin started to deduce what happened back in the attack of Japan before becoming Area 11 by comparing him when they both killed their parents. The Knights of St Michael attacked to protect Shin but were completely outmatched against the Lancelot. His ruthless and devastating defeat of the knights gained him the title \\"White Reaper\\". While Suzaku is fighting Jean, Shin asks Suzaku what it takes to change the world. After sparing both Jean and Julius, they were imprisoned in OVA 4 with the Lancelot imprisoned and during that time Lelouch begins talking to Suzaku by hallucinating his past memories. In the Final OVA, Lelouch asks Suzaku for some water. Suzaku gives him the water jug, then he tries to avenge Euphemia by choking him to death. Lelouch begs him to kill him as Suzaku sees a tear from his Geass eye, but then he releases him, seemingly horrified by his own actions. Afterwards, Suzaku lets Lelouch rest his head on his shoulder. Suzaku and Lelouch are later released by Rolo, who tells them that the emperor wishes an audience with Lelouch. Suzuku knowing that Lelouch will get his memory wiped looked on depressed. =Second season (R2)= In the second season, Suzaku receives a promotion into the Knights of the Round, the most powerful order of warriors in the Britannian Empire, as a reward for capturing Zero. He intends to become the Knight of One, which will allow him to rule Area 11 by his choosing. He still holds his desire to kill Zero. However, he seems to still have some faith in Lelouch, and looks forward for a chance to clear his doubts about his friend by asking him about the incident with Euphemia. Suzaku and the other Knights of the Round watch as Zero announces that he will continue his plans to create the United States of Japan. Suzaku returns to Area 11 as a student in Ashford Academy to discover if Lelouch has regained his memories of being Zero. Unable to find any sort of sign, Suzaku lets Lelouch speak to the new Viceroy of Area 11, Nunnally, which also ends in failure thanks to Rolo Lamperouge using his Geass to freeze Suzaku temporarily. When Lelouch attempts to kidnap Nunnally as she is being brought to Area 11, Suzaku steps in to rescue her. Zero later unexpectedly announces that he will accept Nunnally's offer in exchange for exile; this is revealed to be a clever ruse when Zero has all one million Elevens participating dress exactly like him, leaving Suzaku no choice but to exile the entire group to prevent another massacre. Suzaku is deployed to the Chinese Federation's capital, where the First Prince of Britannia and the Empress Tianzi are to be wed; however, Zero kidnaps the Empress during the ceremony. Britannian aid is requested in recovering the Empress, and Suzaku personally has Kallen Stadtfeld transferred into Britannian custody before heading into the battle. In the aftermath of Shirley's death, Suzaku investigates Shirley's supposed suicide and comes to the conclusion that Lelouch murdered her. He decides to question Kallen about Zero's true identity, threatening to use Refrain if she does not cooperate. In the end, Suzaku does not use the Refrain, realizing that by doing so he would be no better than Lelouch. Frustrated, he goes to confront Lelouch personally and discovers that the Intelligence Agency is under the effect of Geass, confirming that Lelouch has regained his memories. After the creation of the United Federation of Nations is cut short by the Emperor's appearance, Suzaku is contacted by a desperate Lelouch, who asks him to protect Nunnally from the Emperor. Suzaku agrees to his request, but only if Lelouch meets him alone at the Kururugi shrine. The meeting goes well at first and Suzaku decides to help him if Lelouch ends his war, but Schneizel's unexpected attempt to arrest Lelouch makes him believe Suzaku went back on his word. During the second battle of Tokyo, Suzaku is attacked by Guilford under the influence of Lelouch's Geass and Jeremiah Gottwald who Lelouch convinced to join the Black Knights. Though both are drawn away from Suzaku, he is forced to battle Kallen in her improved Guren. Driven to the edge, Suzaku realizes he cannot win and comes to terms with his death as an atonement. In doing so, Suzaku's Geass command activates and forces him to use the F.L.E.I.J.A. bomb. Kallen dodges and the bomb instead hits the government complex, wiping out the entire government building and most of the surrounding area. The Lancelot Albion Realizing that he has been naive, Suzaku decides that the ends are more important than the means used to reach them and takes a more active approach to becoming Knight of One, offering to kill the Emperor for Schneizel. Schneizel agrees and Suzaku heads to Kamine Island to complete his mission, as well as kill the one responsible for the chain of events leading to Lelouch's actions and Euphemia's death. However, Suzaku is derailed by the Knight of One, Bismarck Waldstein, eventually submitting to his Geass and falling back. He later enters the Sword of Akasha with C.C. and agrees with Lelouch that the wishes of Charles and Marianne are selfish, even stopping Marianne from approaching Lelouch. One month later, he assists Lelouch in taking the throne, becoming his \\"Knight of Zero.\\" When the surviving Knights of the Round attempt to remove Lelouch from power, Suzaku easily defeats them with his new Lancelot Albion. He also assists in taking the U.F.N. leaders hostage. During the battle against Schneizel and the Black Knights, he joins Lelouch in boarding the Damocles, holding Gino off while Lelouch goes ahead. Suzaku comes out victorious, but Gino's last attack opens the shields and allows Kallen to take over. Kallen manages to land a fatal blow on the Lancelot while his last attack disables her Knightmare. The Lancelot explodes shortly after Kallen is rescued by Gino. Despite being nearly defeated in the duel itself, Suzaku is the one to attain the goal of the fight: to prevent Kallen from going after Lelouch, thus winning him the final victory and keeping the Zero Requiem on track. Suzaku is believed dead in the blast, but reappears before the world as the new Zero to kill Lelouch, now the despised tyrannical Emperor of the world, as part of their plan for world peace. With the Zero Requiem complete, Suzaku weeps silently as he impales Lelouch and watches him die. Lelouch gives Suzaku his final order: As punishment for betraying his native homeland many years ago and for all else he has done, Lelouch tells Suzaku that he is dead from that day on and must continue to exist as Zero, relinquishing his identity and the right to happiness for the sake of the world so long as he lives; an order Suzaku accepts. Afterwards Suzaku becomes Nunnally's protector in the following months, aided by Schneizel, who is still under a Geass command to obey Zero. =Lelouch of the Resurrection= In the events of the 2019 film Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection, which takes place a year after the events of the alternate universe trilogy movies, Suzaku is escorting Nunnally when they are captured by the Zilkhistans. Suzaku was imprisoned before being freed and reunited with Lelouch, who was resurrected from the dead by C.C. and who briefly resumes his cover as Zero long enough to save his sister and bequeaths the title back to Suzaku. Abilities While Suzaku possesses no outwardly superhuman powers, such as Geass, his physical prowess is top-notch. He possesses superior hand-eye coordination and has extensive military training in both firearms and hand-to-hand combat. He is also strong enough to lift both Lelouch and Shirley on his own with one arm. Before Britannia's invasion of Japan, Suzaku was trained by his instructor, Kyoshiro Tohdoh, in martial arts, and has spent most of his time training to become stronger. He is also skilled in the art of kendo. His trademark is a spinning kick first used on Lelouch in the first episode, which he is able to replicate in his Knightmare. His sensorial perception is likewise above normal: he is able to detect Kallen trying to sneak up on him twice and stops a dagger in mid-air without even turning to face it. Suzaku's physical prowess has been shown to be almost superhuman. In episode 16, he manages to destroy a ceiling-mounted remote machine gun while unarmed by running up a wall and kicking it (the gun's motion tracker was said to have a lag time of 0.05 seconds). He has also dodged machine-gun fire from Knightmares on multiple occasions. In the light novels, he is depicted at ten years of age as being able to defeat several adult men with a wooden training sword used in kendo. Suzaku is an extremely skilled pilot, rated at 94% operational efficiency by Lloyd based on his performance at the Shinjuku ghetto. C√©cile also notes that his simulator scores were the highest of his class. His lack of any tactics confuses Lelouch, as he fights with reflex instead of strategy. The Lancelot's superior abilities also help, as few other Knightmare Frames can match its astonishing speed or overcome its considerable defenses. Even when Lelouch manages to predict his movements, Suzaku's reflexes allowed him to narrowly escape what would have otherwise been certain death. Despite not possessing a Geass power, Suzaku has the peculiar ability to detect C.C. and others who grant the power of Geass. C.C. speculates that this is either due to her having previously used her abilities on him, or another unidentified factor. Following episode 18 in the first season, Suzaku is also placed under a command by Lelouch to \\"live.\\" As this command gives no time or event limitations, it activates every time Suzaku feels suicidal (or otherwise accepts his death as an inevitability) and forces him to survive by any means. It also activates to a lesser extent when his life is in immediate danger. He is the only character other than Mao whom Lelouch has placed a permanent Geass ever to become aware of it, having been told so by V.V.. Suzaku eventually learns to intentionally trigger his Geass command to help unleash his full potential during combat. He used this ability to defeat Bismarck Waldstein and to deploy a countermeasure to the F.L.E.I.J.A. warhead in tandem with Lelouch, which contained a program that had to be executed within 0.04 seconds of detonation to have an effect. Appearances in other media =Lost Colors= In the video game spin-off Code Geass: Lost Colors, if the player uses Rai's geass on Suzaku to make him join the Black Knights, Suzaku joins and brutally fights off the Britannian forces. He also participates in the Black Rebellion, which has the Black Knights winning the war. However, in forcing Suzaku to join, the player angers Lelouch, who wanted to recruit Suzaku without using Geass. Lelouch puts Rai into an eternal sleep, resulting in a game over. The player may choose to pursue Suzaku as a friend by joining the Britannian military. In the All Hail Britannia route, Rai becomes Suzaku's partner in battle and receives a Knightmare Frame of his own similar to the Lancelot. He may use his own Geass to stop Euphemia from ordering the infamous massacre portrayed in episode 22-23 under Lelouch's accidental Geass. After ordering the Princess to stop and then ordering the crowd to forget her order, Euphemia's plan to create the Special Zone of Japan succeeds. Rai and Suzaku are then known as the new country's two White Knights. In the Black Knights path, if Rai stops Princess Euphemia from following through with Lelouch's accidental Geass (an alternate version to episode 22-23), Suzaku (who is standing nearby) will catch the princess as she suddenly collapses. She wakes up in his arms without any recollection of being under the control of Lelouch's Geass. =Nightmare of Nunnally= In the manga spin-off series, Suzaku's appearance is changed slightly. Some parts of his hair are down, and his eye color is blue instead of green. Both his knight outfit and his pilot outfit are also customized with a blue samurai arm gauntlet. Suzaku also owns his own ≈åkatana with a custom Britannian hilt. Suzaku first appeared in chapter 7 of the manga series, and has received approval from Schneizel for Euphemia to have Suzaku as her knight. In the manga, Suzaku is shown to have an ability to sense the power of other people with Geass. When Suzaku first fought against Lelouch as Zero in his Lancelot Knightmare Frame, Lelouch noticed that his powers are negated, hinting that Suzaku might have another ability. This is further hinted in chapter 14, when he meets Alice; she notes it is impossible for anyone to sneak up on her, and when she shakes his hand, she notes later that she felt a chill. However, Suzaku doesn't appear to be aware of this, or indeed of Alice's abilities. In Chapter 13, it is revealed that in this timeline, Suzaku did not kill his father; C.C. did in order to protect Lelouch and Nunnally. Later, Suzaku is revealed to be a being known as a 'Wired' a being who can access the power of Eden Vital without entering into a Geass Contract and thus having the qualifications to become a 'Demon King' like Zero, but was shocked when the identity of Zero was revealed to be Lelouch. After the Mark Nemo pilot was captured, Suzaku was approached by Lelouch, who was shocked when he revealed the pilot was Nunnally and had no choice but to help him, and later passed the information to Euphemia. Suzaku, along with Lelouch as Zero, arrived on time to stop Nunnally from being executed by her other brother, Rolo Vi Britannia, on Euphemia's orders and proceeds to fight Rolo and his knight, Anya Alstreim, only to be defeated by Anya's Tristan Knightmare Frame. After Alice flees with Nunnally and Emperor Charles zi Britannia declares the Holy Nation of Eden Vital, Suzaku is arrested along with Euphemia, Cornelia as well as his comrades Guilford, Lloyd and Cecile. He is rescued by Zero and, despite his mistrust, helps him make Euphemia the Empress of Britannia. Having lost his original Lancelot, Suzaku deploys the Lancelot Albion with Zero in his Gawain against the Emperor's Knights of Rounds (who are revealed to be undead zombies). Suzaku and his Albion are almost defeated, but are saved by Charles' defeat. At the end of the series, Suzaku remains as Euphemia's knight and the two of them meet Lelouch for the last time when he appeared to them in Euphemia's office to bid farewell. =Suzaku of the Counterattack= In the manga spin-off series shows, Suzaku as the main protagonist, wearing a bionic combat suit and going by the alias Lancelot. Suzaku also develops a close friendship with Lloyd's assistant Mariel Lubie, and later meets her father, Lenard Lubie, who requested Suzaku to take care of her. After a renegade Black Knights faction had attacked the Lubie automobile, which killed Lenard and injured Mariel when the wrecked car was destroyed, Suzaku is fueled in anger as he seeks to defeat Zero. Fulfilling Lenard's request, Suzaku is taking care of Mariel until she gets better. It is revealed that he had killed his father Genbu, but it was done when Suzaku found out that he and the Emperor of Japan were willing to collaborate with Britannia and kill off anti-occupation Japanese officials and civilians. In a fit of anger, he stabs Genbu in the chest. When Suzaku meets Schneizel, he is moved by his words that he wished to create a world were everyone is equal, and offers Suzaku a position as his knight. Suzaku accepts, believing that Schneizel can end the fighting. When an art gallery, with the Emperor Charles, was in control by the Black Knight, Suzaku was sent by Schneizel to try and prevent any civilian from getting hurt and was surprised to find that Kallen was a member and revealed that she is half Britannian-Japanese, but left her when he realised that Zero is after the Emperor. When he arrived he saw not only the Emperor dead but saw Schneizel being shot by Zero, causing him to shoot shot his gun at his mask, which cracked and was shocked to see that it was Lelouch as Zero. When he demand why he did it, Lelouch replied that he only did it for the both of them. Suzaku find it hard to believe as the two point the gun at each other and fired, with Lelouch missed the shot and Suzaku shot away Lelouch's gun, but later one of the Glaston Knights shot at Lelouch and leaving him injured. Schneizel praises Suzaku for his efforts, but mentions the event that happened seven years ago, which he shouldn't have known about. Suzaku is torn over the decision to execute Lelouch, since it will take Nunnally's brother from her. Later Suzaku discovers C.C., who reveals that it was Schneizel, not Lelouch, who killed the Emperor. He plans to take C.C.'s immortality. Realizing that he's been serving the wrong man, Suzaku frees Lelouch to help confront Schneizel. Suzaku and Lelouch infiltrate the Government building and confront Schneizel, who has already absorbed some of C.C.'s powers, allowing him to easily dispatch them. With Schneizel about to fully gain C.C.'s powers and her immortality, Suzaku reveals himself as a Regulator, negating Schneizel's ability and then kills him with his sword. With Schneizel now dead, C.C.'s powers are instead transferred to Suzaku, now possessing all of her abilities and her immortality. With Suzaku and Lelouch preparing to leave with C.C., Jeremiah arrived and shot Lelouch before the floor collapsed and he fell to his death. Suzaku managed to save Lelouch and escape with C.C. before the entire Government building collapsed, with the fate of Lloyd surviving is unknown. Five years later with the Black Knights supposed victory, an immortal Suzaku went past a 22-year-old Kallen, still a member of the Black Knights, and arrived at a house, where Lelouch and Nunnally were then living, and happily greeted a surprised Lelouch, now 22 and his right eye covered with his hair. =Code Geass (manga)= Suzaku is present in the manga adaptation with many differences. He was already a student at Ashford Academy from the start. He was not present with Lelouch when C.C. was revealed to be in the capsule. Finally, he met Euphemia while at the Academy and not on the streets. He still believes that he can change the system from within. =The Miraculous Birthday= In a special Code Geass Picture Drama episode, Suzaku arrived at Ashford Academy with Nunnally, Shirley, and Nina, and had met with Lelouch, but also brought C.C. with him and commented if she's Lelouch's girlfriend, to which she replied that he proposed to her, and suggested a wedding being held at the Kururugi Shrine for them. However a battle erupted in school grounds by the Neo-Chinese Federation and took everyone hostage. While everyone escape to the student council room, Lelouch thought of a plan to defeat the enemy, but requires assistance from the others, to which Suzaku agreed with the plan and went with Kallen. After defeating all of the Chinese soldiers in the school's east hall, the two reflect on each other's performance, with Kallen talking about Suzaku's spinkick move that he also used on the Lancelot, to which Suzaku revealed the name of his spinkick move to her as \\"Hinoboru-ryu Makoto- ichi-Shiki Hurricane Kick\\", to which he commented from his former Master, Kyoshiro Tohdoh, that most kids find it hard to say and named it \\"Suzaku Kururugi spinkick\\" instead, to which Suzaku has taken a shine to it. The two arrived at the school's chapel, acting as the Neo-Chinese's HQ, and confronted the leader, but was tricked and their souls were absorbed into mystic item known as the \\"Thousand-man Silver Vase\\". However Suzaku manage to return to his body with Kallen, with help from Lelouch who used his Zero persona, and used his spinkick on the eunuchs. In the aftermatch, Suzaku watches Lelouch's body disappearing and was thanked by him before giving him an inspirational speech. When the group realized Rolo, Shirley, and C.C. were gone, Suzaku realized the date being December 5 being Lelouch's birthday. Suzaku once again donned his Zero persona and commented that he still will not say thanks to Lelouch because of everything that has happened, but still says Happy Birthday to him in respect.Code Geass: The Miraculous Birthday („Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„ÇÆ„Ç¢„Çπ ÂèçÈÄÜ„ÅÆ„É´„É´„Éº„Ç∑„É• „Ç≠„Çª„Ç≠„ÅÆË™ïÁîüÊó•, K≈çdo Giasu: Kiseki no Tanj≈çbi) =Another Century's Episode: R= The fourth installment of the Another Century's Episode series, Another Century's Episode R will feature Suzaku with his Lancelot. The setting in his world will be an alternative version of the event of R2. A brief plot was revealed in the second promotional video in the official website and a short detail of the event set in the A.C.E. R main planet, Eria. Set in an alternative event of the second season of episode 06, Suzaku arrived with Gino and Anya when a Britannian ship was attacked by the Black Knights and were confronted by Kallen, and was overpowered by her. While Suzaku wishes to continue, Gino however convinced him to return to the Chinese Federation to regroup. After the eunuchs defeat in the Chinese Federation, Suzaku arrive with the three Rounds member, Gino, Anya, and Luciano, and a fleet of Britannian Knightmare Frames led by Schneizel. As they are about to fight the Black Knights an unknown black energy appeared and was suddenly transported to Eria, where he was separated with the other Britannian forces and the other Rounds, but manage to board the Avalon with Lloyed and Ceclie, who were also sucked in. In Eria, Suzaku and co have appeared on a mountain landscape, were Cecil discovered Zero near their area. After finding Zero, he encountered different mechs who are with him. Kei and Olson D. Verne from Super Dimension Century Orguss, and Kei ask whether he would join them, which Suzaku refuse because of their alliance with Zero and prepares to attack, but was interrupted by one of the Seasons, Spring One, in her Core unit, Sea Plant, with a group of Icon units. When Spring offered them allegiance, Suzaku hesitated because he will not forgive Zero, but will not trust anyone that would protect Zero, and he refuses. After Spring ordered the attack, Suzaku ordered the Avalon to assist Zero and his new allies. After her defeat and the appearance of more Icons, he and the others witness Macross Quarter from the Macross Zero series, with the Ark Alpha, and witness it destroying a fleet of Icon. As the Macross Quarter captain, Jeffrey Wilder, offered the group to join up with them, Zero agreed and asked Suzaku to come with them, which he hesitated but accepts. Later in their first mission together with Zero and the others, Suzaku and the others fought against Spring One in her Core unit, Sea Stand, which Autumn later delivered the final blow in her Core unit, Alpharto, causing Spring to escape. When Zero question if she is really human, Suzaku was surprised when Autumn revealed she isn't but an android. Suzaku, along with Alto Saotome and other mechs from the Macross Frontier, followed Brera Sterne, who had also sided with Seasons along with Grace O'Conner, to a ruined city, where he was shocked that Gino and Anya, along with some Britannian forces had sided with the Season. and tried to convince them to stop, which Gino replied if he enjoyed being a Black Knight and tells him to come to their side, leaving Suzaku in doubt. However Zero manage to convince him that the battle is not about Britannia or Japan but their worlds, leading Suzaku to reject Gino's offer and fight alongside Zero and defeating both Gino and Anya. As the plot progresses, The group later encountered a group of Gareth Knightmare Frames, along with the Knight of Ten, Luciano Bradley, and surprisingly Li Xingke, who have sided with Seasons. With Xingke beginning the assault, Suzaku, along with Zero, C.C. and Kallen, have fought and defeated him, but when Xingke was about to be killed by Bradley, Suzaku had blocked his attack and saved him, leading Xingke to switch sides and defeating Luciano, leading him to his death. Suzaku and Co then confronts the other four Season's in their Core units and later Dr. Shiki, in Winter's body, piloting the ACE Core. After his defeat and Autumn using all of her powers to prevent the hole to expand, Suzaku returns to his own world along with Zero, Kallen, and others. Suzaku was then requested by Zero that the two discuss, and later went their separate ways, knowing they'll be enemies again. =Another Century's Episode: Portable= Suzaku appears in the sequel with his Lancelot Albion. =Super Robot Wars Z 2 Hakai-Hen= Suzaku and the rest of the Code Geass R1 cast will make their debut to the Super Robot Wars franchise in this game, using their R1 Knightmares. =Nunnally in Wonderland= In a special OVA parody episode, based on the Alice in Wonderland story, Suzaku appears in the role as the White Knight.Code Geass: Nunnally in Wonderland Reception In the 29th Anime Grand Prix, Suzaku was sixth place with 143 votes,Favorite Male Character, 29th Annual Anime Grand Prix then 19th and 13th, respectively, in the following two. In the 2007 Seiyu Awards, Takahiro Sakurai was a nominee in the category \\"Best Actors in supporting roles\\" for his portrayal as Suzaku, but lost to Akira Ishida and Kouki Miyata. Critical reception to Suzaku has been mainly positive. Anime News Network's Bamboo Dong regarded Suzaku as a likable character, contrasting his role and personality with Lelouch's. Kevin Leathers from UK Anime Network agreed with Dong, as Suzaku \\"counter-balance[s]\\" Lelouch's alterego due to how he does not wish violence. Moreover, IGN's D.F. Smith described Suzaku as Lelouch's \\"opposite number\\", and also gave praise to the friendship the two share. While reviewing an episode from the series, Ramsey Isler found comical and disappointing how was Suzaku forced to stay at school for extra hours having just finished a highly dangerous mission. His confrontation against Lelouch in the first season's finale was praised mainly because of Suzaku's mentality and his feelings regarding Zero's identity which he confesses he denied accepting such revelation. Kotaku found Suzaku as an interesting lead due to his irony of working for Britannia in order to change the Empire once taking over. While this causes to see himself as \\"monster\\" due to working for them, he maintains a good duality with Lelouch's methods which are seen similar too. As the series' second half goes across, Kotaku noted that Suzaku finds himself more tormented by his actions, mostly when he nukes Tokyo using military weapons forced by Lelouch's powers to survive to a fight. As a result, the site felt Suzaku sees himself as \\"irredeemable\\". His final actons in the series' finale were also the subject of praise due to how Suzaku and Lelouch decide to become \\"evil\\" in order to end the chaos and create a greater good. DVDTalk.com praised the handling of the first season's finale in regards to Suzaku's relationship with Lelouch who while, about to become allies, the a plot twist involving Euphemia causes a large impact in their roles in the story which might appeal to the audience. THEM Anime Reviews stated that their relationship is one of the most entertaining part of the movie as a result of how they are childhood friends yet across the story, they become enemies. The Fandom Post noted that Suzaku and Lelouch's relationship might attract female viewers so he recommended an anthology manga to them, praising the multiple designs presented. The Fandom Post enjoyed how in Code Geass: Lelouch of the Re;surrection, Suzaku is still Lelouch's best friend. Meanwhile, Anime News Network noted that the film explored Lelouch's consequences in regards to the series' finale with Suzaku and C.C. being the only ones who took his side. On the other hand, Kotaku criticized Suzaku and Lelouch's role in the OVAs Akito the Exiled due to their lack of relevance while making the former angst for having the job of bodyguarding Lelouch during the time he hated him following the events of the first season.

Prior to its publication in 1936 by Farrar & Rinehart, Inc., the novel was serialized in six issues of The Saturday Evening Post (February 29 ‚Äì April 4, 1936). Appearing in one 1960 paperback edition titled To Kill Again, The Rubber Band was also collected in the omnibus volume Five of a Kind (Viking 1961). Plot introduction The Rubber Band opens with the revelation that Wolfe has added a workout to his daily schedule. He hurls yellow-feathered darts at a poker- dart board that Fritz hangs in the office from 3:45 to 4 p.m. Archie had joined in at first, but quit when he found he had lost nearly $100 to Wolfe in the first two months. \\"There was no chance of getting any real accuracy with it, it was mostly luck,\\" Archie writes. On this particular Sunday, Wolfe exercises alone while Archie needles him by reading aloud, at length, from The New York Times Magazine. The novel introduces Lieutenant Rowcliff, not one of the NYPD's finest (in the opinion not only of Wolfe but Inspector Cramer). Rowcliff's search throughout the brownstone for Wolfe's client, Clara Fox, earns Wolfe's enmity, which lasts until the final Wolfe novel in 1975. In addition, The Rubber Band contains the first documented death to occur in Wolfe's office. Plot summary Nero Wolfe is approached by Anthony Perry, president of the Seaboard Products Corporation, who is concerned that one of his employees is being unjustly accused of theft. A package containing $30,000 has gone missing, and Ramsey Muir, the company's vice-president is accusing Clara Fox, Perry's personal assistant. Perry's meeting with Archie Goodwin is interrupted by Harlan Scovil, who has recently arrived in New York City from Wyoming and is one of a group that has a later appointment with Wolfe. At one point Scovil seems to mistake Perry for another man, Mike Walsh. Before Archie can attend to Scovil, he is summoned to Perry's offices, where Muir‚Äîmotivated by jealousy and spite after Clara rejected his advances‚Äîis threatening to call the police. Archie's preliminary investigations turn up little, and he arrives back to the brownstone to learn that Scovil has left, summoned away by a telephone call. However, the other members of his group have arrived, including the real Mike Walsh, and Archie is surprised to discover that Clara Fox is their leader. Clara wishes to hire Wolfe to recover a sum of money owed to the group by the Marquis of Clivers, a British nobleman in America on confidential government business. Years ago, the group (or in the case of Clara, her father) were a Wild West posse called \\"The Rubber Band\\", and they saved the future Marquis from a lynching. The Marquis promised them a substantial share of his fortune in return but has rebuffed Clara's claims. Rico Tomaso illustrated the six-part serialized printing of The Rubber Band for The Saturday Evening Post (February 29‚ÄìApril 4, 1936) The discussion is interrupted by a police detective who brings the news that Harlan Scovil has been murdered. In his pockets were found the contact details for the Marquis of Clivers, prompting the police -- eager to avoid inconveniencing the Marquis and causing diplomatic issues with Britain -- to suspect the group of blackmail. Wolfe also learns from Fred Durkin that the police have found the missing $30,000 in Clara's car, and a warrant has been issued for her arrest. Once the policeman has left, Wolfe questions Fox concerning the stolen money and the murder. Satisfied as to her honesty and innocence on both matters, he accepts her as his client, and persuades her to remain in the brownstone. Mike Walsh rejects Wolfe's offer of protection and storms out. Wolfe sends a letter to the Marquis informing him of the group's claims and suggesting that legal action may be taken. He also informs Perry that he will not be investigating on behalf of him or the corporation. For several days, the numerous charges that Clara is facing mean that Wolfe is forced to keep her as his guest in the brownstone. However the police, led by the obnoxious Lt. Rowcliff, soon arrive with a search and arrest warrant to enter the brownstone and arrest Clara for the theft of the $30,000. Wolfe is outraged by Rowcliff's impertinence, but is forced to allow the police to search the premises. Clara, however, cannot be found, and once the police have left Wolfe reveals that he concealed her in the orchid rooms. Wolfe receives a visit from the Marquis of Clivers himself, who insists that he has already paid his debt to the Rubber Band. He claims that the group's leader, Rubber Coleman, approached him years ago representing the Band, and that on receiving the money Coleman provided him with a receipt signed by the other members. The next day, Archie receives a phone call from Mike Walsh claiming that he has found \\"him\\", only for the call to be ended by a loud noise that sounds like a gunshot. Moments after the call Walsh is found dead, with the Marquis of Clivers standing over the body. Inspector Cramer, Police Commissioner Hombert and District Attorney Skinner arrive at the brownstone and demand that Wolfe share what he has learned about the case. Wolfe produces Clara and provides proof that she neither stole the $30,000 nor murdered Scovil and Walsh. He reveals to the authorities that he is almost ready to solve the case, but one lingering unresolved detail is troubling him. The next morning, Archie is surprised to find Wolfe slamming wooden boards in the orchid rooms, to no purpose that Archie can see. Wolfe takes notice of Archie's bundle of papers secured with a rubber band. After doing so, Wolfe has him summon everyone, including Ramsey Muir, Anthony Perry and the Marquis of Clivers, to his office. Once he arrives, the Marquis recognizes Anthony Perry instantly ‚Äî he is Rubber Coleman. Wolfe reveals that Perry, or rather Coleman, swindled the money from the other members of the Rubber Band and used it to fund his numerous business enterprises, only to discover that Clara was pursuing the Rubber Band's claim. Coleman hired her to keep her close, and attempted to discourage her from her pursuit but framed her for the theft of the $30,000 when he was unable to do so. Although intending to hire Wolfe to cover his tracks and throw suspicion off himself, Coleman had the misfortune to be recognised by Scovil at Wolfe's office, and so murdered him and Walsh to preserve his secret. Coleman staged the phone call that purported to record Walsh's death with the use of a rubber band to simulate a gunshot, thus giving himself an alibi. Though Coleman is defiant, Wolfe reveals that he has obtained the \\"receipt\\" that Coleman used to forge the signatures of the other members of the band when claiming the money from the Marquis; even by chance he cannot be convicted of murder in New York, this will be sufficient to convict him of fraud in England, which will equally expose and ruin him. Thwarted, Coleman attempts to shoot Wolfe but is gunned down by the Marquis and Archie before he can do so. Having proven Clara's innocence, Wolfe negotiates with the Marquis to claim the remainder of the Band's fair share of his inheritance. Guilt-ridden by the deaths she believes have been caused by her quest, Clara attempts to turn it down, but Wolfe persuades her to accept it. The unfamiliar word \\"Nero Wolfe talks in a way that no human being on the face of the earth has ever spoken, with the possible exception of Rex Stout after he had a gin and tonic,\\" said Michael Jaffe, executive producer of the A&E; TV series A Nero Wolfe Mystery.Quoted in Vitaris, Paula, \\"Miracle on 35th Street: Nero Wolfe on Television,\\" Scarlet Street, issue #45, 2002, p. 36 Nero Wolfe's erudite vocabulary is one of the hallmarks of the character.

Before taking Clara Fox as his client, Wolfe ascertains her level of personal involvement with her employers: :Wolfe sighed. \\"Really, Miss Fox, we are wasting time that may be valuable. Tell me, I beg you, about Mr. Perry and Mr. Muir. Mr. Muir hinted this afternoon that Mr. Perry is enjoying the usufructs of gallantry. Is that true?\\" :\\"Of course not.\\" She frowned, and then smiled. \\"Calling it that, it doesn't sound bad at all, does it? But he isn't.\\" *Necromancer, chapter 6. Telling his client that no sorcery is responsible for his conclusions, Wolfe says, \\"I am not a necromancer, Miss Fox.\\" *Acarpous, chapter 13. Wolfe encounters another twist in the case while speaking to Lord Clivers: :He looked at me. \\"Confound it, Archie. I have you to thank for this acarpous entanglement.\\" :It was a new one, but I got the idea. *Weltschmerz, chapter 15. Archie returns to the office to find that Wolfe is in conference with himself: :I would have tried some bulldozing if I thought he was merely dreaming of stuffed quail or pickled pigs' feet, but his lips were moving a little so I knew he was working. I fooled around my desk, went over Johnny's diagrams again in connection with an idea that had occurred to me, checked over Horstmann's reports and entered them in the records, reread the Gazette scoop on the affair at 55th Street, and aggravated myself into such a condition of uselessness that finally, at eleven o'clock sharp, I exploded, \\"If this keeps up another ten minutes I'll get Weltschmerz!\\" :Wolfe opened his eyes. \\"Where in the name of heaven did you get that?\\" :I threw up my hands. He shut his eyes again. Reviews and commentary * Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime ‚Äî In the manner of its time, this early tale is long and brings up past history. ...

The short collection of poems was first published in 1827. Today, it is believed only 12 copies of the collection still exist. Poe abandoned his foster family, the Allans, and moved to Boston to find work in 1827. Having only minor success, he enlisted in the United States Army. He brought with him several manuscripts, which he paid a printer named Calvin F. S. Thomas to publish. The 40-page collection was called Tamerlane and Other Poems and did not include Poe's name. Distribution was limited to 50 copies and it received no critical attention. The poems were largely inspired by Lord Byron, including the long title poem \\"Tamerlane\\", which depicts an historical conqueror who laments the loss of his first romance. Like much of Poe's future work, the poems in Tamerlane and Other Poems include themes of love, death, and pride. Poe's first published collection is so rare that after Poe's death, Rufus Wilmot Griswold believed it had never existed until one was found in 1859. It has since been recognized as one of the rarest first editions in American literature. Background Edgar Poe was unable to complete studies at the University of Virginia due to gambling debts. He left the university in March 1827Sova, 267 and the already-strained relationship with his foster father, John Allan, grew worse. Poe determined to go to Boston, where he was born.Stashower, 42‚Äì43 When Poe's biological mother Eliza Poe died, the only object she left him was a watercolor painting of the city, on the back of which she had written, \\"For my little son Edgar, who should ever love Boston, the place of his birth, and where his mother found her best and most sympathetic friends.\\"Hutchisson, 7 John Allan, a merchant in Richmond, Virginia, refused to give his foster son the $12 for the trip, though it is likely Poe got the money from his foster mother Frances Allan.Bittner, 48‚Äì49 John Allan was not aware of Poe's decision or whereabouts and, not concerned, wrote \\"I'm thinking Edgar has gone to Sea to seek his own fortunes\\".Bittner, 49 After arriving in Boston in April 1827, Poe served briefly as clerk for a wholesale merchandise warehouse on the waterfront, then as an office clerk and reporter for an obscure newspaper, the Weekly Report. After several weeks, in desperation, he enlisted in the United States Army for a five-year term under the pseudonym \\"Edgar A. Perry\\"; he gave his age as 22, though he was only 18,Stashower, 43 likely because he would have needed parental consent if under 21.Bloomfield, 41 He was assigned to the First Regiment of Artillery and stationed at Boston Harbor's Fort Independence.Hutchisson, 22 Up to this point, Poe had not written much poetry. His earliest lines of verse were a couplet labeled \\"Poetry\\", presumably written sometime in 1824 in the ledger book of Allan & Ellis, his foster father's mercantile company. The lines read: \\"Last night with many cares & toils oppress'd / Weary, I laid me on a couch to rest‚Äî\\".Thomas & Jackson, 81 The earliest known full-length poem by Poe, \\"O, Tempora! O, Mores!\\", is a satirical poem whose authorship is the subject of some dispute.Hubbell, Jay B. \\"'O, Tempora! O, Mores!' A Juvenile Poem by Edgar Allan Poe\\", Studies in the Humanities. University of Colorado Studies. Series B, vol. 2, no. 4: 314‚Äì321. Nevertheless, calling himself \\"irrecoverably a poet\\",Peeples, Scott. Edgar Allan Poe Revisited. New York: Twayne Publishers, 1998: 28. he had been working on a few longer poems at the University of Virginia,Meyers, 32 whose manuscripts he brought with him to Boston.Silverman, 38 Publication history Back cover with an advertisement for printer Calvin F. S. Thomas Sometime in the spring of 1827, Poe turned over his manuscripts to an 18-year-old printer named Calvin F. S. Thomas, whose family may have been known by Poe's birth parents. Thomas had previously only printed labels, flyers, and other small jobs.H L Poe, 34 Poe used his own money to pay for the publication of his poems as the 40-page collection Tamerlane and Other Poems, the only known book printed by Thomas.Randall, David Anton. Dukedom Large Enough: Reminiscences of a Rare Book Dealer, 1929-1956. New York: Random House, 1969: 186. The collection was pamphlet-sized, 6.75 by 4.5 inches.Porges, Irwin. Edgar Allan Poe. New York: Chilton Books, 1963: 64. Poe was 18 years old when the collection was released in July 1827 and only 50 copies were printed. The total production number is the subject of dispute; various scholars believe the number was slightly lower (only 20 copies) or substantially higher (as many as 200).Bloomfield, 39 Tamerlane and Other Poems was published anonymously with the credit granted to \\"a Bostonian\\". His name, typically listed as \\"Edgar A. Poe\\", was not published with his work until his second collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems in late 1829.Silverman, 54‚Äì55 Poe may have chosen not to give his name so that his foster father, John Allan, would not know where he was;Sova, 253 moreover, his choice to embrace his Bostonian heritage may have been an attempt to distance himself from the Allan family in Richmond.Cornelius, Kay. \\"Biography of Edgar Allan Poe\\" in Bloom's BioCritiques: Edgar Allan Poe, Harold Bloom, ed. Philadelphia: Chelsea House Publishers, 2002: 12. Boston was, at the time, a center for publishing and the literary world. By the time the book was released, Poe was already in the Army.Silverman, 41 Poe introduced the collection with an apologetic notice admitting the low quality of his poems. He said they were not intended ever to be published and \\"why they are now published concerns no one\\" but the author.Sova, 233 He claimed, however, that the majority of the poems were written between 1820 and 1821, \\"when the author had not completed his fourteenth year\\"Silverman, 39 though this is assumed to be an exaggeration. Poe used the low circulation of this collection to attract readers later in his career, suggesting the 1827 poetry book had been \\"suppressed through circumstances of a private nature\\".Sova, 5 That second collection, Al Aaraaf, Tamerlane, and Minor Poems, included revised versions of five of the nine poems from Tamerlane and Other Poems.Silverman, 55 Distribution of Tamerlane and Other Poems was so light that Rufus Wilmot Griswold in 1850 claimed it had never existed, noting that none had been found. The first known copy turned up in 1859 with a second found in 1874. A type facsimile of a copy held by the British Museum, edited and introduced by Richard Herne Shepherd, was published as a limited edition in 1884. Another copy of Tamerlane and Other Poems was published in a 1941 facsimile by Thomas Ollive Mabbott,Mabbott, Thomas Ollive, Tamerlane and Other Poems, New York: The Facsimile Text Society by Columbia University Press, 1941 who provided the introduction; his correction and additions to this are found in a subsequent publication.Mabbott, Thomas Ollive, ‚ÄúDigressions, C: Supplementary Notes on Tamerlane, 1827,‚Äù The Raven and Other Poems, New York: The Facsimile Text Society by Columbia University Press, 1942, pp. xxvi-xxvii. cited at eapoe.org Themes Many of the poems in Tamerlane and Other Poems were inspired by Lord Byron. A character in the title poem was named Ada after Byron's daughter Ada Lovelace. The poems, many of which had a theme of youth, were inspired in part by the works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Krutch, 65 The largest inspiration on Poe, however, came from the work of Lord Byron;Hutchisson, 21 the character of the title poem \\"Tamerlane\\" has a daughter named \\"Ada\\", named after Byron's own daughter Ada Lovelace. Poe admired Byron both for his poetry and for his rebellious personality. John Allan blamed Poe's interest in Byron for his licentiousness.Sova, 41 Some biographers suggest that Poe's wandering to Boston and joining the Army represent a need to live like an outcast inspired by Byron.Hutchisson, 26 The title poem, \\"Tamerlane\\", depicts a dying conqueror who regrets leaving his childhood sweetheart and his home to pursue his ambitions.Bittner, 47 In its original form, \\"Tamerlane\\", based on the historical Timur, was 406 lines. The choice of an eastern character was unusual for a westerner at the time, though Byron, Fran√ßois-Ren√© de Chateaubriand, Thomas Moore and others had written other Orientalist works.Erkkila, Betsy. \\"The Poetics of Whiteness: Poe and the Racial Imaginary\\" in Romancing the Shadow: Poe and Race, J. Gerald Kennedy & Liliane Weissberg, eds. New York: Oxford University Press, 2001: 45. Autobiographical overtones suggest Poe based the poem on the loss of his own early love, Sarah Elmira Royster, or of his birth mother Eliza Poe.Hoffman, Daniel. Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe Poe. Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1972: 27. The poem may also mirror Poe's relationship with his foster father John Allan; similar to Poe, Tamerlane is of uncertain parentage, with a \\"feigned name\\". The \\"other poems\\", which Poe admitted \\"perhaps savour too much of egotism; but they were written by one too young to have any knowledge of the world but from his own breast\\". These poems present the poet as solitary figure who was faced some unnamed transforming childhood event.Silverman, 40 Poe adopted some of the common themes of the day, including imagery of heavenly bliss and angelic beauty. He steps away from the typical use of didacticism of the time and instead focuses on psychological reverie and symbolist aesthetics,Reynolds, David S. Beneath the American Renaissance: The Subversive Imagination in the Age of Emerson and Melville. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1988: 44. beginning his lifelong poetic refusal to write for the masses. Poe would continue to revisit themes of death, beauty, love, and pride in his later works.H L Poe, 35 He would later rewrite one poem, \\"Imitation\\", as \\"A Dream Within a Dream\\" and use images from \\"Evening Star\\" in \\"Ulalume\\".Quinn, 127 Critical reception Tamerlane and Other Poems was virtually ignored and received no significant critical attention upon its publication.Meyers, 33‚Äì34 The only public notice of it was a mention of the title in a couple lists of recent books:Campbell, Killis. \\"Contemporary Opinions of Poe\\", The Mind of Poe and Other Studies. New York: Russell & Russell, Inc., 1962: 373‚Äì378. The United States Review and Literary Gazette listed it in August and the North American Review listed it in October 1827.Thomas & Jackson, 82‚Äì83 Samuel Kettell listed Tamerlane and Other Poems in his \\"Catalogue of American Poetry\\" section of his three-volume anthology Specimens of American Poetry in 1829.Thomas & Jackson, 101 Literary historian Joel Porte suggests the American reading public during this period was more interested in fiction than poetry.Porte, Joel. In Respect to Egotism: Studies in American Romantic Writing. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991: 77. Despite its lack of attention, the publication of Tamerlane and Other Poems gave a young Poe the confidence to continue writing. After Poe became more popular with \\"The Raven\\", a reviewer who saw parts of Tamerlane and Other Poems commented, \\"'Poems written during youth' no matter by whom written, are best preserved for the eye of the writer\\".Hayes, Kevin J. Poe and the Printed Word. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2000: 19‚Äì20. Modern scholar Joseph Wood Krutch said the collection \\"save for a few poems, [was] distinctly prentice work\\". Poe biographer Arthur Hobson Quinn wrote: \\"The perfection which marked Poe's great lyrics was, of course, not yet present. But the promise was there.\\"Quinn, 128 Quinn also credits Poe for publishing a collection of poetry before slightly older contemporaries who would become popular poets, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.Quinn, 129 Scholar Harry Lee Poe, a distant relative of Poe, wrote in 2008 that the collection did not include great poetry. However, he added, \\"it was the trumpet blast announcing that a new poet had stepped upon the stage\\".H L Poe, 36 It is believed only a dozen copies of the original printing of Tamerlane and Other Poems remain, making it one of the rarest of first editions in American literature.Rose, Lloyd. \\"Yo, Poe: In Richmond, A Museum Rises From The Dead\\", Washington Post. May 10, 1998 Ironically, the value of one copy today is more money than Poe ever made in his lifetime.Meyers, 139 Its rarity was recognized in 1925, when the Saturday Evening Post ran an article titled \\"Have You A Tamerlane in Your Attic\\"?Nelson, 71 After the article ran, a woman in Worcester, Massachusetts named Ada S. Dodd searched and found a copy, prompting others to search as well.Basbanes, 213 Today, most of the surviving copies are owned by libraries and museums. Two copies, for example, were purchased by The Huntington Library in New York in 1915.Basbanes, 201 One copy is on display as part of the collection at the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond, Virginia. Though copies do not circulate often, they command high prices when they do. One sold at auction for $125,000Nelson, 70 and, later, another sold for $198,000. In December 2009, a copy from the William E. Self collection sold at Christie's, New York for $662,500, a record price paid for a work of American literature.

It governed parochial libraries established for ministers of the Church of England. This Act was partly in force in Great Britain at the end of 2010.The Chronological Table of the Statutes, 1235 - 2010. The Stationery Office. 2011. . Part I. Page 80, read with pages viii and x. The Act is one of the oldest pieces of legislation concerning libraries in the United Kingdom. The preamble to the Act noted that throughout the country, many parish clergy were provided with stipends so small that they were not able to purchase books for their studies, and as a result many small charitable libraries for this purpose had been recently established. In order to better protect these libraries from misuse or disposal, the Act stipulated that such establishments were to be maintained for the purpose for which they had been provided, and that the incumbent of the parish was to provide security, if so requested, \\"by bond or otherwise\\", to ensure this. The appropriate ordinary of the Church, or the supervising archdeacon, was given authority to enquire into the condition of parochial libraries and appoint visitors to examine them, to ensure that they were maintained in a good condition. On the death of an incumbent, or his removal, the library was to be locked and secured until they were replaced, to prevent the loss of the books, excepting any routine use made of the room it was stored in. Within six months of taking up the incumbency of a parish with a parochial library, or of the establishment of a new library, the incumbent was to produce a catalogue of all the books then in the library and deposit it with the bishopric; likewise, all parochial libraries in existence as of the time of the Act were to have such a catalogue produced and deposited by 29 September 1709. As a counterpart to these periodic records, a current register of any donated books or other donations was to be kept, recording the name of the benefactor and the details of the gift. It was also provided that the ordinary (and, if still living, the original benefactor) were able to make regulations for the use and upkeep of the library, providing that they did not conflict with the original terms of the donation. No book was permitted to be sold or otherwise disposed of without the consent of the ordinary, and then only in cases where it was a duplicate of an existing work. If any book was taken from the library, the incumbent was permitted to bring a lawsuit for damages in the name of the ordinary, any such damages (rated at three times the cost of the book plus legal fees) being used for the maintenance of the library, or to apply to a Justice of the Peace for a warrant to find the book and immediately return it to the library. The Act is prospectively repealed and replaced (except as to Wales) by the draft Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction and Care of Churches Measure, a Measure of the General Synod of the Church of England.

She was the author of three memoirs about the imperial family and about her own escape from Russia. In her book Before the Storm, Sophie describes a side of old Russia seldom seen elsewhere, a family in the old-fashioned provincial country life of the gentry in the years before the revolution. As a child, Sophie shared picnics and mushroom hunts with other famous players in the story such as Anna Vyrubova, Felix Yussupov, Dmitri Pavlovich and the sons of poet Konstantin Romanov. Service as lady-in-waiting According to her memoirs, Buxhoeveden's father, Baron Karlos Matthias Konstantin Ludwig Otto von Buxhoeveden, was the Russian minister in Copenhagen, Denmark during World War I. Her mother was Lyudmila Petrovna Osokina. In her youth, she was a part of the social life of St. Petersburg. Buxhoeveden was chosen as an honorary Lady in Waiting to the Tsarina in 1904, and became an official Lady in Waiting in 1913. She was nicknamed \\"Isa\\" by the Tsarina and her four daughters and, during World War I, was often chosen by the Tsarina to accompany the four grand duchesses to official duties. She had no time for Grigori Rasputin, but witnessed his miracles first-hand and was baffled by his powers. Alexandra would have liked her to accept Rasputin as a holy man, but knew Buxhoeveden's opinion was not likely to be changed. The fact she kept her negative opinion to herself was appreciated by the Empress, who knew Buxhoeveden would say nothing to discredit her. She followed the family to exile in Siberia following the Russian Revolution of 1917. She was released by the Bolsheviks, unlike many of the other people in the family's entourage, most likely because they mistook her Danish name for Swedish (She was Baltic German). The Bolsheviks did not imprison foreign nationals in fear of reprisals from other nations. Sophie spent many months on the run across Siberia, with other members of the royal household, including Gibbes and Gilliard. She was only allowed safe passage out of Russia when she made it to Omsk, which was then under the control of the Russian White Army and the British Military. Her experiences can be read in her book \\"Left Behind.\\" Allegations of betrayal of the Romanovs Amateur historians, usually Anna Anderson supporters, have accused her of betraying the family by taking money from them and later informing their guards that the Romanov children had sewn jewels into their clothing. This was based on a claim by Anderson that Buxhoeveden, after she denounced Anderson as a fraud pretending to be Grand Duchess Anastasia, had betrayed the family.Frances Welch, \\"A Romanov Fantasy: Life at the Court of Anna Anderson\\", p.104 She allegedly told Rodionov that \\"The buttons on her coat aren't buttons, they are diamonds; the aigrette of that hat conceals a diamond from the shah of Persia; and that belt there ‚Äì underneath it are ropes of pearls.King, Greg, and Wilson, Penny, The Fate of the Romanovs, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2003, , pp. 68‚Äì69, 141‚Äì143 Such a proposition has been completely disproven since the Bolsheviks had no idea the jewels were in the clothes until after the execution. Yurovsky stated \\"They shot the daughters but nothing happened, then Yermakov set the bayonet in motion and that didn't help; then they were finally finished off by being shot the head. Only in the forest did I discover what hampered the shooting of the daughters.\\"\\"The Fall of the Romanovs\\", By Mark D. Steinberg and Vladimir M.Khrustalev, Yale University Press 1995, , p.359 According to King and Wilson, Yurovsky wrote in his 1922 memoirs about \\"the damn valuables and jewels we knew they had concealed in their clothes when they arrived, which caused troubles to no end.\\" King, Greg, and Wilson, Penny, \\"The Fate of the Romanovs, p. 143. It is fact that Yurovsky explained that while the truck was stuck in the forest, \\"some of Yermakov's people started to pull at the girls' blouses, where they discovered the valuables.\\"..\\"Things that had been sewn into the daughters' clothing were discovered when the bodies began to be undressed..The daughters had bodices made up of diamonds and other precious stones that served not just as a receptacle for valuables but as protective armor. This is why neither bullets nor bayonets yielded results during the shooting and bayonet blows..there turned out to be eighteen pounds of such valuables.\\"Steinberg and Khrustalev, p. 361-362 One of the large diamonds that had been carefully covered and concealed in a button was never discovered by the Bolsheviks, and was later found by the Whites after they took Ekaterinburg, trampled into the mud at the grave site. The diamond was identified by two former servants who had helped the Grand Duchesses sew the jewels into the clothing.Robert Wilton, \\"Last Days of the Romanovs\\", 1920, p.344-345 King and Wilson allege that Buxhoeveden borrowed 1,300 rubles from the Romanov children's tutor Charles Sydney Gibbes to escape Russia. It is claimed she told him she'd return the money, but never did. \\"I knew she was greedy, but I never knew she'd go that far!\\" Gibbes allegedly wrote to the French tutor Pierre Gilliard.King and Wilson, p. 505 Others said that Sophie's apparent poverty, as described by Gilliard and Gibbes, is proof she never had any money and certainly hadn't stolen anything from anyone. At her own admission, Sophie's rooms had been searched, and nothing of value had been found. One source of the allegations blaming her with theft from the family was Boris Soloviev, the true guilty party. He was the husband of Maria Rasputin, author of historically disproven books, having married her to gain the trust of Rasputin supporters who were financing a plot to rescue the Romanovs. It was he who betrayed the family, and attempted to cast doubt on others. Soloviev really was involved in a scheme to defraud the family of the money sent by supporters to rescue them, and betray the rescuers to the Bolsheviks.Sokolov report, pages 126‚Äì131Robert K. Massie, \\"Nicholas and Alexandra\\"p.464-467 old hardback, p.489-492 new softback The maid Anna Romanova was an accomplice of Soloviev. Romanova, said by some to have joined Buxhoeveden in the alleged 'betrayal' over the jewels and was supposedly interrogated in on the subject in Ekaterinburg, actually never even made the trip and stayed in Tobolsk.\\"Last Days of the Romanovs,\\" p.125 Involvement in the Anna Anderson affair In 1922 in Berlin, a woman, later known to the world as Anna Anderson, was reportedly claiming to be a Romanov Grand Duchess. It was said that she was Grand Duchess Tatiana. She claimed, however, according to nurse Thea Malinovski to be Grand Duchess Anastasia in the fall of 1921. Baroness Buxhoeveden went to Berlin to visit the woman and pronounced her \\"too short\\" to be Tatiana.Hall, Coryne, Little Mother of Russia, London, Shepheard-Walwyn (Publishers) Ltd. 1999, , p.340 :\\"She was in bed close to the wall, she was turned facing against the window, in full sunlight. When she heard us enter the room, she hid herself under the cover to hide herself from our stares, and we were not able to get her to show us her face....The unknown one spoke German with Miss Peuthert. Although she was permitted to get up, she preferred to stay in bed as long as possible. This is how I found her. After asking my companions to move away from the bed a little, I tried to attract the young woman's attention as I caressed her hair and speaking to her in English while using the types of phrases I would have used while speaking with the Grand Duchesses, but I did not refer to her by any name other than 'Darling'. She did not reply and I saw that she did not understand a word of what I had said, for when she raised the cover after a certain period of time, and I saw her face, there was nothing in her eyes which showed she had recognized me. The eyes and forehead showed some resemblance to the Grand Duchess Tatiana Nicolaievna, resemblance that disappeared, nevertheless, as soon as her face was not covered. I had to remove the cover by force, and I saw that neither the nose, the mouth, nor the chin were formed like that of the Grand Duchess. The hair was lighter in color, some of her teeth were missing-and the remaining ones were not like those of the Grand Duchess...Her hands were also completely different, the fingers were longer and the nails narrower. I wanted to measure her height, but she refused, and I found it impossible to get an exact measurement without force. We judged roughly that in any case, she was smaller than me, while the Grand Duchess Tatiana was more than ten centimeters taller than me. I have been able to verify this, thanks to the patient's official measurement at the time of her arrival at the hospital and that corresponded exactly with the one which was taken in my presence. :\\"I tried to awaken the memory of the young woman by all the possible means; I showed to her an 'icon', with the date of the Romanov jubilee, that the emperor had given to some persons of the suite, after that a ring that had belonged to the empress; the latter had been given to her in the presence of the Grand Duchess Tatiana. But none of these things seemed to evoke in her the slightest recognition. She remained completely indifferent, she whispered some incomprehensible words into Ms. Peuthert's ear. Although I noted a certain similarity in the upper part of the face with the unknown -currently Mrs. Tschaikovski- with the Grand Duchess Tatiana, I am sure that she is not her. I later learned that the she supposes that she is the Grand Duchess Anastasia, but she does not physically resemble her in the least. She has none of the special characteristics that would allow any one who knew the Grand Duchess Anastasia well to identify her.\\"Pierre Gilliard, \\"La Fausse Anastasie\\" It was after that Anderson mentioned Buxhoevden's alleged treachery and betrayal of the family to the Bolsheviks, claiming that was why she denied her. Except among diehard supporters, this vicious counter-attack did little to cushion the blow of having been flatly rejected by someone who was very close to the Imperial family. Sophie Buxhoeveden never wavered in her view that Anderson was an impostor. Baroness Buxhoeveden was also involved in disproving another Romanov claimant, this time Eugenia Smith, who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia. She wrote about Smith, \\"I found no likeness whatsoever to the Grand Duchess physically .... Although a total stranger, she is sympathetic on the whole, but seemed to be labouring under a mental delusion.\\"Hall, Coryne, Little Mother of Russia Exile, Death and Legacy After being refused permission to join the family in the Ipatiev house, Sophie, along with the foreign tutors, Pierre Gilliard and Sydney Gibbes, lodged in a fourth class railway car while they tried to find a way to help the family. Every day, the three of them persistently badgered Sir Thomas Preston, the British consulate, discussing all possible options. She and her two companions even made personal representations to the Ural Soviet on behalf of the Romanovs.Helen Rappaport,Last Days of the Romanovs: Tragedy at Ekaterinburg, p.34 These attempts failed and they were forced to leave Ekaterinburg. Following many long months of fleeing across Siberia in fear for her life, Buxhoeveden was finally able to leave Russia with the help of the British military, namely General Alfred Knox, who got her safe passage on a military train. While in Omsk, she had a surprise reunion with Joy, Alexei's spaniel, who had been rescued by Colonel Paul Rodzianko. Though now almost blind, the dog seemed to recognize her.Rappaport p.214 Joy had been traumatized by the loss of the family, and was heartbroken. It was a sad but bittersweet reunion for her too; seeing the dog brought back vivid memories of the Tsarevich. From Omsk, they had to travel across China to avoid unsafe parts of Siberia. Upon reaching Vladivostok, she described it as \\"Vladivostok, being the base of the Allied forces, was full of foreigners. There was the military element as well as representatives of the various Red Cross units, some Canadian detachments that had never gone any farther, as well as civilians and diplomats.\\" She also described seeing the Pacific coast for the first time in her life, and expressed her sadness as she sailed away from her native country: :\\"I was leaving Russia. Would I ever see my country again, and in what condition would I find it if I ever returned? Who among my friends and relations would have survived the storm? The Russia I had known, the old Russia, disappeared slowly from view.\\" After she passed through Japan and Hawaii, regretting not having more time to see these places, her ship landed in San Francisco, where she took a train across the United States. She marveled at the sights she had never seen before: :\\"Everything in America seemed to me on such a monumental scale that it dwarfed every bit of European scenery I had ever seen before, or have ever seen since. What were the Norwegian fjords, or even the Alps, after the Rocky Mountains? What are the largest buildings of other towns after those in San Francisco and New York?\\" When she finally arrived in Denmark at the home of her father, she told of seeing the Dowager Empress in Copenhagen, and how melancholy it was to hear \\"God Save the Tsar\\" played, knowing what had happened to the country she'd loved. :\\"Was this to be the last time that they would hear that hymn? The Empire had been wiped out, the Emperor was no more, our great country had lost even its name. In the notes of our anthem was the echo of one of the world's greatest tragedies. It seemed to set a seal on a past that for us was gone... gone forever.\\" In exile, Buxhoeveden lived in Copenhagen with her father, then at Hemmelmark in northern Germany, the estate owned by Prince Heinrich of Prussia, younger brother of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and his wife, Princess Irene, the Tsarina's sister. Finally at Kensington Palace in London, Baroness Buxhoeveden faithfully performed lady-in-waiting services for the late Tsarina's older sister Victoria, Marchioness of Milford Haven. It is quite incorrectly claimed, without any historical verification, that the Baroness was not trusted by the Tsar's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, who warned Victoria that \\"Isa\\" was not to be trusted.King and Wilson, pp. 505‚Äì506 The truth of the matter was revealed through a statement made in March 1958 by Grand Duchess Xenia that she believed in her.Van der Kiste, John and Hall, Coryne, Once a Grand Duchess: Xenia Sister of Nicholas II, Phoenix Mill, Sutton Publishing, 2002, , p.233 \\"Isa\\" died in England in grace and favor rooms granted to her by the Queen, the drawers chests were crammed with mementos of the family, photo albums and pieces of Faberg√©. After her death she left a number of items that had belonged to the Russian imperial family to Grand Duchess Xenia including, \\"a green enamel Faberg√© pencil given to me by Empress Alexandra ... a white china cup with a pattern of cornflowers and the mark NII used by the Emperor at Tobolsk .. a small wooden Ikon .. with a few words of prayer written by the Empress at Tobolsk ... \\".Van der Kiste and Hall, p. 233 Writings The Baroness wrote three books that are considered to give one of the best accounts of the Romanov family's life and final days. They were Life and Tragedy of Alexandra Feodorovna, published in 1928; Left Behind: Fourteen Months in Siberia During the Revolution, published in 1929; and Before the Storm.

He contributed occasional lead vocals, and played acoustic guitar (6- and 12-string), banjo, harmonica, kazoo and jug. His songs on the first Mungo Jerry album and on the early maxi-singles were generally more folksy and lighter in style than those of group leader Ray Dorset, and he was frustrated when his own songs were constantly rejected for subsequent albums. On the second album, Electronically Tested, his composition \\"Black Bubonic Plague\\" appeared on European copies only, but not on the British release. In 1972, King recorded a solo album, Been in the Pen Too Long; he left Mungo Jerry shortly afterward. He and the group's keyboard player Colin Earl (born 6 May 1942, Hampton) formed the King Earl Boogie Band with guitarist Dave Lambert, bassist Russell John Brown and washboard player Joe Rush, who had been a part- time Mungo Jerry member. Their album Trouble at Mill, produced by Dave Cousins of Strawbs, was well reviewed, but a single, \\"Plastic Jesus\\", was banned by the BBC on grounds of blasphemy. The group disbanded a few months later, and Lambert later joined Strawbs. King then pursued a solo career, releasing occasional records under the names P.

Prior to its first publication in 1937 by Farrar & Rinehart, Inc., the novel was serialized in five issues of The American Magazine (December 1936 ‚Äì April 1937). Adapted twice for Italian television, The Red Box is the first Nero Wolfe story to be adapted for the American stage. Plot introduction Wolfe and Archie investigate the death of a model who ate a piece of poisoned candy. One of the suspects begs Wolfe to handle his estate and especially the contents of a certain red box. Wolfe is at first concerned about a possible conflict of interest, but feels unable to refuse when the man dies in his office before telling Wolfe where to find the red box. The police naturally think that he told Wolfe somewhat more before dying. This novel presents the series' first instance of a murder taking place in Wolfe's office. Plot summary James Schucker illustrated The Red Box for its appearance in five issues of The American Magazine, beginning in December 1936. Molly Lauck, a beautiful model, has died after eating a poisoned Jordan almond, and wealthy socialite Llewellyn Frost has hired Nero Wolfe to investigate the case. His true purpose, however, is to ensure that his ortho-cousin Helen is freed from the employment of Boyden McNair, the owner of the fashion boutique where Lauck died. He pressures Wolfe to leave his home and investigate the crime scene directly, producing a letter signed by the directors of the Metropolitan Orchid Show urging him to do so. Although highly reluctant, Wolfe eventually relents and travels to the boutique with Frost and Archie Goodwin. Wolfe and Archie interview McNair, who is noticeably ill and distressed by recent events, and several of the models including Helen Frost. Although the interview is apparently unhelpful, Wolfe is intrigued when Helen indicates that she knew the contents of the chocolate box containing the candy that killed Lauck despite claiming to have never seen it before. Llewellyn Frost, who has romantic feelings for his cousin and believes that Wolfe intends to incriminate her, tries to terminate his contract with Wolfe. Outraged by Frost's actions, Wolfe refuses to drop the matter without being paid his full fee, despite being pressured by both Helen's mother Calida and Frost's blustering father Dudley. Intrigued by Wolfe investigating a crime scene personally, Inspector Cramer tries to find out what Wolfe has learned. Although Wolfe offers him little, he does suggest that Cramer and Archie gather the people of interest in the case and one-by-one offer them a chocolate from a box similar to that which contained the poisoned item that killed Molly Lauck. Making note of who selects what, Archie notes that Boyden McNair‚Äôs response is different from the others in that he initially goes to select a Jordan almond, as the victim did, but then reacts skittishly and chooses something else. Wolfe and Archie also learn that Boyden McNair displays a particular fondness towards Helen, apparently due to her resemblance to his own long-dead daughter. Boyden McNair meets with Wolfe and confesses that, as the chocolate box had been intended for him, he believes someone is trying to murder him. Although he refuses to identify a suspect, McNair reveals that he has made Wolfe the executor of his estate and has willed to him a red leather box containing papers relating to a shameful incident in his past. Before he can reveal any more, however, he is killed in front of Wolfe and Archie by a poisoned aspirin. Although this voids Wolfe's original contract, Helen hires Wolfe to locate McNair's murderer. Wolfe determines that the red box will most likely reveal the culprit, and orders it found. As executor of McNair‚Äôs estate, Wolfe sends Saul Panzer, Orrie Cather, Fred Durkin, and Johnny Keems to McNair‚Äôs cottage in the country to search the grounds for the box, with orders to keep the police out should they attempt to interfere. Wolfe learns that Helen is the heir to the Frost family fortune, which is held in a trust managed by Dudley Frost until her 21st birthday, but if anything were to happen to her it would instead go to Llewellyn Frost. Later that night, the operatives at the cottage catch Perren Gebert, a family friend of the Frosts with designs of marrying Helen, trying to break in. Archie is sent to collect Gebert and bring him to Wolfe for questioning, but before he can the authorities arrive to search for the red box. Archie manages to prevent them from doing so, but is forced to surrender Gebert to their custody. While the police are unable to get any useful information from Gebert, Cramer reveals to Archie that Gebert has been receiving monthly payments of $1,000 from Helen Frost‚Äôs trust fund. The next night, after being released from custody Gebert is murdered with a nitrobenzene trap set in his car. A package arrives for Wolfe that prompts him to summon the main players to his office. Once everyone has arrived, Wolfe reveals that he has discovered that Helen Frost is in fact Glenna McNair, the daughter of Boyden McNair. The real Helen Frost was the child who had died years before, but Calida Frost bought Glenna from the then-impoverished Boyden McNair and raised her as Helen in order to eventually control the inheritance. Bitterly regretting what he had done ever since, McNair proceeded to make his fortune, formed an attachment with Helen/Glenna and planned to reveal the truth to her, but Calida Frost killed him to prevent this. Perren Gebert was also murdered because he knew of the arrangement and had been blackmailing Calida, and also planned to marry Glenna. Wolfe produces the red box that he claims holds the proof of his accusations. In fact, it is a mock-up containing a bottle of cyanide, which Calida Frost uses to commits suicide. The actual red box is eventually found in Boyden McNair‚Äôs boyhood home in Scotland with plenty of evidence to support Wolfe‚Äôs theories but, as Archie notes, \\"by that time Calida Frost was already buried\\". The unfamiliar word \\"Nero Wolfe talks in a way that no human being on the face of the earth has ever spoken, with the possible exception of Rex Stout after he had a gin and tonic,\\" said Michael Jaffe, executive producer of the A&E; TV series, A Nero Wolfe Mystery.Quoted in Vitaris, Paula, \\"Miracle on 35th Street: Nero Wolfe on Television,\\" Scarlet Street, issue #45, 2002, p. 36 Nero Wolfe's erudite vocabulary is one of the hallmarks of the character. Examples of unfamiliar words‚Äîor unfamiliar uses of words that some would otherwise consider familiar‚Äîare found throughout the corpus, often in the give-and-take between Wolfe and Archie. * Ortho-cousin, chapter 1. Wolfe to Archie: :More transparent was the reason for Mr. Frost's familiarity with so strange a term as 'ortho-cousin,' strictly a word for an anthropologist, though it leaves room for various speculations. ... Ortho- cousins are those whose parents are of the same sex‚Äîthe children of two brothers or of two sisters; whereas cross-cousins are those whose parents are brother and sister. In some tribes cross-cousins may marry, but not ortho- cousins. Obviously Mr. Frost has investigated the question thoroughly. *Spiff, chapter 3. Archie: :He [Llewllyn Frost] stopped, smiling from Wolfe to me and back again like a haberdasher's clerk trying to sell an old number with a big spiff on it. *Yclept, chapter 8. Archie: :Boyden McNair, with his right elbow on his knee and his bent head resting on the hand which covered his eyes, sat near Wolfe's desk in the dunce's chair, yclept that by me on the day that District Attorney Anderson of Westchester sat in it while Wolfe made a dunce of him. Reviews and commentary * Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, A Catalogue of Crime ‚Äî Stout rarely has Nero Wolfe lured away from home on a case, but in this one Archie does it with orchids. Poisoning at a fashion show is the crime that Wolfe's method of exhaustive interrogation mixed with bluff is involved to solve. Archie is thinner and less amusing here than elsewhere, but we learn more about Wolfe from himself.Barzun, Jacques and Taylor, Wendell Hertig. A Catalogue of Crime.

Racing career He made his debut in 1950 and won two of the seven races he competed in 1953 in the #46 Buckshot Morris Oldsmobile (including the 1953 Wilkes 160). Thompson made 15 starts in 1955 and made a serious attack on the Championship the next year, competing in 42 races in Carl Kiekhaefer's factory-backed Chryslers and Dodges, winning eight times and finishing third in points. 1957 saw a switch to Hugh Babb's and his own Chevrolet's and another third-place result, capturing only two victories that year. Speedy drove his own Chevy for the entire 1958 season, and another third place was the reward for his four victories in 38 starts. Another third place in points came in 1959 from 29 starts in a variety of different cars, this time with no wins. 1959 would be his last full-time effort in the series (participating in 24 different racing event including the 1959 Hickory 250) and he left Grand National after the 1962 season, choosing to race at late models at local North Carolina short tracks.

The group is composed of two subgroups: Diplodocoidea and Macronaria. Arising in the early Jurassic and persisting until the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, Neosauropoda contains the majority of sauropod genera, including genera such as Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, and Diplodocus.Rogers, Kristina Curry, and Jeffrey A. Wilson. The Sauropods: Evolution and Paleobiology. Berkeley: U of California, 2005. It also includes giants such as Argentinosaurus, Patagotitan and Sauroposeidon, and its members remain the largest land animals ever to have lived.Souza, L. M. De, and R. M. Santucci. \\"Body Size Evolution in Titanosauriformes (Sauropoda, Macronaria).\\" Journal of Evolutionary Biology J. Evol. Biol. 27.9 (2014): 2001-012. When Bonaparte first coined the term Neosauropoda in 1986, he described the clade as comprising ‚Äúend-Jurassic‚Äù sauropods. While Neosauropoda does appear to have originated at the end of the Jurassic period, it also includes members throughout the Cretaceous. Neosauropoda is currently delineated by specific shared, derived characteristics rather than the time period in which its members lived.Rogers, et al. 2005 The group was further refined by Upchurch, Sereno, and Wilson, who have identified thirteen synapomorphies shared among neosauropods.Wilson, Jeffrey A., and Paul C. Sereno. \\"Early Evolution and Higher-Level Phylogeny of Sauropod Dinosaurs.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 18.Sup002 (1998): 1-79. As Neosauropoda is a subgroup of Sauropoda, all members also display basic sauropod traits such as large size, long necks, and columnar legs.Wilson, Jeffreya. \\"Sauropod Dinosaur Phylogeny: Critique and Cladistic Analysis.\\" Zool J Linn Soc Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 136.2 (2002): 215-75.  History of Discovery  Paleontologist Richard Owen named the first sauropod, Cetiosaurus, in 1841. Due to the fragmentary evidence, he originally believed it to be a type of massive crocodile. Cetiosaurus has at times been classified as a basal member of Neosauropoda, which would make it the first member of this group discovered.Taylor, Mike P. \\"The Evolution of Sauropod Dinosaurs from 1841 to 2008.\\" 2008. Most current research, however, places Cetiosaurus outside Neosauropoda as a sister taxon.D.T. Ksepka and M.A. Norell, 2010, \\"The Illusory Evidence for Asian Brachiosauridae: New Material of Erketu ellisoni and a Phylogenetic Reappraisal of Basal Titanosauriformes\\", American Museum Novitates 3700: 1-27 The first dinosaurs discovered which are conclusively known to fall within Neosauropoda were Apatosaurus and Camarasaurus, both found in North America in 1877, and Titanosaurus discovered the same year in India.Taylor 2008 There were other sauropods besides Cetiosaurus which were described before the 1870s, but most were known from only very fragmentary material and none were described in sufficient detail that they may conclusively be classified as neosauropods. A great number of neosauropod skeletons were unearthed in western North America during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, primarily Apatosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus.  Evolution  Sauropodomorpha, of which Neosauropoda is a subclade, first arose in the late Triassic. Around 230 million years ago, animals such as Eoraptor, the most basal known member of Dinosauria and also Saurischia, already displayed certain features of the Sauropod group. These derived characters began to distinguish them from Theropoda.Sereno, Paul; Martinez Ricardo; Alcober, Oscar. 2012. Osteology of Eoraptor lunensis (Dinosauria, Sauropodomorpha). J Vertebr Paleontol. 32(Suppl 1):83‚Äì179. There were several major trends in the evolution of sauropodomorphs, most notably increased size and elongated necks, both of which would reach their culmination in neosauropods. Basal members of Sauropodomorpha are often collectively termed prosauropods, although this is likely a paraphyletic group, the exact phylogeny of which has not been conclusively determined. True sauropods appear to have developed in the Upper Triassic, with trackways from a basal member known as the ichnogenus Tetrasauropus being dated to 210 million years ago.Rogers, et al. 2005. p. 23 At this point, the forelimbs had lengthened to at least 70% of the length of the hindlimbs and the animals moved from a facultatively bipedal to a quadrupedal posture. The limbs also rotated directly under the body, in order to better support the weight of the steadily increasing body size.Rogers, et al. 2005 p. 23 During the Middle Jurassic, sauropods began to display increased neck length and more specialized dentition. They also developed a digitigrade posture in the hindlimbs, in which the heel and proximal metatarsals were raised completely off the ground. The foot also became more spread out, with the ends of the metatarsals no longer in contact with each other. These developments have been used to distinguish a new clade among sauropods, termed Eusauropoda.Rogers, et al. 2005 p. 27-28 Neosauropoda diverged from the rest of Eusauropoda in the Early Jurassic and quickly became the dominant group of large herbivores. The earliest known neosauropod is Lingwulong, a dicraeosaurid from the late Early Jurassic or early Middle Jurassic of China. Diplodocid and brachiosaurid members of the group composed the greater portion of neosauropods during the Jurassic, but they began to be replaced by titanosaurs in most regions through the Cretaceous period. By the late Cretaceous, titanosaurs were the dominant group of neosauropods, especially on the southern continents. In North America and Asia, much of their role as large herbivores had been supplanted by hadrosaurs and ceratopsians, although they remained in smaller numbers all the way until the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction.Lehman, T. M., 2001, Late Cretaceous dinosaur provinciality: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press.  Description  In addition to the basic features of sauropods in general and eusauropods in particular, neosauropods share certain derived features, which have been used to distinguish them as a cohesive group. In their 1998 paper, Sereno and Wilson identified thirteen characteristics that distinguish neosauropods from more basal sauropods (described below).Sereno and Wilson 1998 p. 46-49 = Skull = Neosauropods display a large opening in the skull located ventral to the antorbital fenestra, known as the preantorbital fenestra. This opening is differentially shaped among various species of neosauropods, and it has been proposed that the preanorbital fenestra is reduced or closes up completely in adult Camarasaurus, but is otherwise ubiquitous among neosauropods.Sereno and Wilson 1998 p. 46 The ventral process of the postorbital bone is broader when viewed from the anterior when compared to the width when viewed from the lateral side.Sereno and Wilson 1998 p.46-47 Neosauropods lack a point of contact between the jugal bone and the ectopterygoid arch. Instead, the ecterpteryoid arch abuts the maxilla, anterior to the jugal. The external mandibular fenestra, present in prosauropods and some basal sauropods, is entirely closed.Sereno and Wilson 1998 p. 47 = Dentition = Neosauropods lack denticles on the majority of their teeth. In some species, including Camarasaurus and Brachiosaurus, they are retained on the most posterior teeth, but most advanced forms have lost them entirely. Certain members of the subgroup Titanosauria have ridges along their posterior teeth, but these are not large enough to be considered denticles of a form similar to those found in more basal sauropods. = Manus = The number of carpal bones in neosauropods is reduced to two or fewer. This continues a trend of successive carpal loss seen in the evolutionary record. Early dinosaurs such as Eoraptor tend to have four distal carpals. In prosauropods, this is reduced to three and the proximal carpals are usually lost or shrink in size. Basal sauropods also tend to have three carpal bones, but they are more block-like than in earlier forms. Neosauropods further reduce this number to two, and in some cases even fewer. The metacarpals of neosauropods are bound together, allowing a digitigrade posture with the manus raised up off the ground. Prosauropods and basal sauropods have metacarpals which are articulated at the base, but this is further developed in neosauropods such that the articulation continues down the shafts. The ends of the metacarpals also form a tight arch with wedge-shaped shafts fitting closely together.Sereno and Wilson 1998 p. 48 =Tibia= The tibia of neosauropods has a subcircular proximal end. The transverse and anteroposterior dimensions of the proximal end are also equal or nearly so in neosauropods, whereas the transverse dimension of the tibia is always shorter than the anteroposterior dimension in prosauropods, theropods, and those basal sauropods for which evidence is available.Sereno and Wilson 1998 p. 49 =Ankle= The astragalus displays two unique features in neosauropods. When viewed from the proximal side, the ascending process extends to the posterior end of the astragalus. The astragalus is also wedge shaped when viewed from the anterior side due to a reduction in the medial portion. = Skin = Skin impressions from Haestasaurus Among macronarians, fossilized skin impressions are only known from Haestasaurus, Tehuelchesaurus and Saltasaurus. Haestasaurus, the first dinosaur known from skin impressions, preserved integument over a portion of the arm around the elbow joint approximately in area. Small, hexagonal scales are preserved, ranging from in diameter. It has been suggested that the convex surface of the scales was from the internal size of the integument, facing the bones, but this has been rejected as the convex surfaces are preserved on the outside of Saltasaurus and titanosaur embryos. Dermal impressions are more widespread in the material of Tehuelchesaurus, where they are known from the areas of the forelimb, scapula and torso. There are no bony plates or nodules, to indicate armour, but there are several types of scales. Skin associated with the scapular blade is the largest, arranged in rosettes (spiral formations) with a smooth, hexagonal shape. These largest tubercles are , surrounded by smaller scales. The other type of scales are very small, only between in diameter, and are preserved in small fragments from the forelimb and thoratic region. Ths skin types are overall more similar to those found in diplodocids and Haestasaurus than in the titanosaur embryos of Auca Mahuevo. As the shape and articulation of the preserved tubercles in these basal macronarians are similar in other taxa where skin is preserved, including specimens of Brontosaurus excelsus and intermediate diplodocoids, such dermal structures are probably widespread throughout Neosauropoda. Classification = Phylogeny = Jos√© Bonaparte originally described Neosauropoda as comprising members of four sauropod groups: Dicraeosauridae, Diplodocidae, Camarasauridae, and Brachiosauridae. Upchurch's 1995 paper on sauropod phylogeny proposed the current definition for Diplodocoidea, which was then classified as a subgroup of Titanosauridae. Cetiosaurus was linked to Neosauropoda by a trichotomy, as the genus‚Äô fragmentary and often dubious description meant that it could be placed as a sister taxon to the Titanosauridae-Diplodocoidae clade, the Brachiosauridae- Camarasauridae clade, or Neosauropoda as a whole.Upchurch P. 1995. The evolutionary history of sauropod dinosaurs. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. London Ser. B 349:365-90. From Upchurch 1995:Upchurch 1995. p. 369 In 1998, Sereno and Wilson published a cladistic analysis of the sauropod family which proposed Macronaria as a new taxon containing Camarasaurus, Haplocanthosaurus, and Titanosauriformes. Titanosauriformes was considered to include Brachiosaurus, Saltasaurus, and all descendants of their most recent common ancestor. This represented a significant deviation from Upchurch's 1995 phylogeny as well as much of the traditional understanding of neosauropod taxonomy. Conventional cladistics had long considered titanosaurs and diplodocoids to be more closely related, with brachiosaurids and camarasaurids together forming a sister taxon.Sereno and Wilson 1998. From Sereno and Wilson 1998:Sereno and Wilson 1998. p. 54 = Subgroups = Neosauropoda is divided into two major subgroups: Macronaria and Diplodocoidea. These taxa are differentiated on the basis of several morphological features. From Upchurch et al. 2004: Macronaria Macronaria is defined as all neosauropods more closely related to Saltasaurus loricatus than Diplodocus longus. This classification was introduced by Wilson and Sereno in 1998. Macronaria comes from the Latin for ‚Äúlarge nose,‚Äù referring to the large external naris.Rogers et al. 2005 The subgroup Titanosauriformes comprises all sauropods descended from the common ancestor of Brachiosaurus and Saltasaurus. Macronaria is an exceedingly diverse clade, with members ranging in size from anywhere between six and thirty-five meters in length and sporting a broad array of body shapes. Some synapomorphies which have been used to characterize macronarians include flared neural spines on the dorsal vertebrae and nearly coplanar ischial distal shafts.Sereno and Wilson 1998 Diplodocoidea Diplodocoidea is defined as all neosauropods more closely related to Diplodocus longus than Saltasaurus loricatus. The group is named after Diplodocus, its best known member. Other prominent dinosaurs contained in this clade include Apatosaurus, Supersaurus, and Brontosaurus. Diplodocoids are distinguished by a unique head shape, which displays certain highly derived features when compared to other sauropods. The teeth are located entirely anterior to the antorbital fenestra and the snout is especially broad. In some rebbachisaurids, this is taken to such an extreme that the teeth are packed into a row along the transverse portion of the jaw. Several unique features are also noted in the tails of certain diplodocoids. Among the diplodocids, there was a marked increase in the number of caudal vertebrae. Most sauropods have between forty and fifty caudal vertebrae, but in diplodocids this number jumps to eighty or more. In addition, the most distal vertebrae develop a biconvex shape and together form a long, bony rod at the end of the tail, often referred to as a ‚Äúwhiplash tail.‚Äù Increased caudal count and a whiplash tail may be features shared by all members of the Diplodocoid group, but, due to a scarcity of evidence, this has yet to be proven.

There was a large variety, mostly based on much older conservative designs. Although wider and more frequent communications within Europe meant exposure to a variety of improvements, experimental failures were costly and rarely attempted. Ships in the north were influenced by Viking vessels, while those in the south by classical or Roman vessels. However, there was technological change. The different traditions used different construction methods; clinker in the north, carvel in the south. By the end of the period, carvel construction would come to dominate the building of large ships. The period would also see a shift from the steering oar or side rudder to the stern rudder and the development from single to multi-masted ships. As the area is connected by water, it would make sense that people in the Mediterranean would build different kinds of ships to accommodate different sea levels and climate. Within the Mediterranean area during the Medieval times ships were used for a multitude of reasons, like war, trade, and exploration. Sailing ships =Early Middle Ages= Knarr Model of a Knarr The knarr, a relative of the longship, was a type of cargo vessel used by the Vikings. It differed from the longship in that it was larger and relied almost entirely on its square rigged sail for propulsion. =High Middle Ages= Cog A cog Cogs were single-masted vessels, clinker-built with steep sides and a flat bottom Mcgrail (1981), p.36 Although the name cog is recorded as early as the 9th century,Mcgrail, 1981, p.36 the seagoing vessel of that name seems to have evolved on the Frisian coast during the 12th century.Crumlin Pederson (2000) Cogs progressively replaced Viking-type ships in Northern waters during the 13th century. Why this was the case is uncertain but cogs could carry more cargo than knarr of a similar size. Their flat bottoms allowed them to settle flat in harbour, making them easier to load and unload. Their high sides made them more difficult to board in a seafight, which may have made them safer from pirates.Mcgrail (1981), p.38 Cogs were also used as military transports and warships, fitted with towers fore and aft. The cog traditionally reached the Mediterranean in 1304. This led to a Mediterranean variant, the cocha.Bass (1972), p.190 Hulk The hulk (OE:hulc) is first recorded in the 10th century, when it is distinguished from a keel (OE:ceol), a ship in keeled longship tradition such as the knarr. Although clinker-built, the distinguishing feature of hulks were that they had no stem or stern posts or deep keel, being flat bottomed like a cog. Early images of hulks show them strongly curved upwards at stem and stern.McGrail (1981) pp 38-40 Hulks continued to be mentioned in use throughout the Middle Ages and into the 16th century, when it is particularly associated with the Baltic and the Hanseatic League. These late hulks could be as large as contemporary great ships. Jesus of L√ºbeck of 1544 was a ship of 700 tons, the same as the Mary Rose.Davies (2005), p.94 However, how similar later medieval hulks were to their ancestors is unknown. There is some evidence of a hybridisation with the cog form, showing both hulk and post construction.Friel (1995), p37 Others have suggested that late hulks were partially carvel-built.Davies (2005), p. 20 =Late Middle Ages= Caravel Caravela Latina / Lateen rigged Caravel The caravel was a ship developed by the Portuguese and used from the 15th century on for oceanic exploration voyages. Unlike the longship and cog, it used a carvel method of construction. It could be either square rigged and lateen rigged (Caravela Redonda) or only lateen rigged (Caravela Latina). The most famous examples of caravels were the Ni√±a and the Pinta. Carrack Santa Mar√≠a, the famous carrack of Christopher Columbus. The carrack was a ship type invented in southern Europe in the 15th century and particularly developed in Portugal in the same century. It was a larger vessel than the caravel. Columbus‚Äôs ship, the Santa Mar√≠a was a famous example of a carrack. The ships commanded by Vasco da Gama as the S√£o Gabriel, with six sails, a bowsprit, foresail, mizzen, spritsail and two topsails, already had the complete features and the design of the typical carrack. Small vessels A number of smaller vessels are named in English sources of the Late Middle Ages, some of which continued into the 16th century and beyond. =Crayer= A vessel of 20-50 tons, used largely on the cross channel tradeMcGowan (1981), p.33 =Hoy= The hoy originated in Flanders in the 15th century. A single-masted vessel usually of 25-80 tons used a coaster or on short sea routes, as well as a lighter. The type would evolve in the 16th and 17th, only finally disappearing in the early 19th century.McGowan (1981), pp35-7 =Picard= First recorded in the 1320s, the picard was a single- masted vessel of 10‚Äì40 tons used mainly as support vessel for fishing fleets, bringing home their catches and ferrying supplies, or as a lighter, loading from vessels at anchor and discharging onto beaches or shallow creeks. A widespread type, in use from Scotland, all round the English coast and across in Ireland.McGowan (1981), p33-4 Oared ships =Early Middle Ages= Galley Galleys had been in use for trade and warfare since at least the 8th century BC and remained in use throughout the Middle Ages. Rowing was the primary method of propulsion, which was well-suited for often fickle winds of the Mediterranean, where they were primarily used. The galley was also used in the waters of Northern Europe, but to a lesser extent since its low freeboard and lack of stability in rough seas made it vulnerable. During the years 1150-1350 after the crusade the Mediterranean witnessed an economic boom known as the Commercial Revolution. To keep up with trade ship building increased as well. Italian city-states like Venice constructed boats like the galley. By the thirteenth century the galley was able to hold about 500 metric tons and was about 130 feet long. Longship The longship was a type of ship that was developed over a period of centuries and perfected by its most famous user, the Vikings, in approximately the 9th century. The ships were clinker-built, utilizing overlapping wooden strakes. =High Middle Ages= Balinger The balinger was a clinker-built oared vessel, initially with a single mast but in the 15th century larger vessels had a second mast. They were usually small vessels of 40‚Äì60 tons but larger vessels of up to 120 tons are recorded. Balingers were popular in the Bay of Biscay and English Channel and were used both for trade and warfare. Fast and with the flexibility of oars and sails for propulsion, they were commonly used by pirates Rose (2013) pp71-2 =Late Middle Ages= Birlinn In the waters off the west of Scotland between 1263 and 1500, the Lords of the Isles used galleys both for warfare and for transport around their maritime domain, which included the west coast of the Scottish Highlands, the Hebrides, and Antrim in Ireland. They employed these ships for sea-battles and for attacking castles or forts built close to the sea. As a feudal superior, the Lord of the Isles required the service of a specified number and size of galleys from each holding of land. For examples the Isle of Man had to provide six galleys of 26 oars, and Sleat in Skye had to provide one 18-oar galley. Carvings of galleys on tombstones from 1350 onwards show the construction of these boats. From the 14th century they abandoned a steering-oar in favour of a stern rudder, with a straight stern to suit. From a document of 1624, a galley proper would have 18 to 24 oars, a birlinn 12 to 18 oars and a lymphad fewer still.

UNROW's story began in 2000 when five Texas trial lawyers - Walter Umphrey, Harold Nix, Wayne Reaud, John O'Quinn, and John Eddie Williams (UNROW) - made gifts totaling $2 million to Washington College of Law. For over a decade, that gift has supported student participation in human rights litigation through participation in the UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic.UNROW Clinic at the Washington College of Law Founded by WCL Emeritus Professor Michael Tigar, UNROW propounds a philosophy focused on providing great autonomy to WCL's student attorneys in proposing and preparing new cases, determining litigation strategy, drafting motions, arguing in court, and traveling internationally, if necessary, to support their clients and cases. The UNROW Clinic has exceptional experience with federal court and international litigation that involves multiple plaintiffs and factual complexities. Although a WCL program, the UNROW clinic is administratively distinct from the other WCL clinics. It employs its own academic framework, admissions process, and other practices. Current caseshttp://www.wcl.american.edu/unrow/ =International Human Rights: US involvement in Chilean torture= On September 11, 1973, Augusto Pinochet led a coup that deposed the democratically elected President Salvador Allende and established a military government that tortured, murdered, and disappeared thousands of individuals. The UNROW Clinic brought suits challenging U.S. involvement in human rights violations that occurred before, during, and after the 1973 coup. In 2002, UNROW brought suit against Henry Kissinger, the United States government, and Michael Townley for crimes against humanity, forced disappearance, torture, arbitrary detention, and wrongful death. UNROW won a $7.2 million judgment against Michael Townley for his role in aiding and abetting the torture and assassination of Carmelo Soria. Townley's enrollment in the Witness Protection Program, however, hampered efforts to collect the judgment. In the spring of 2007, the UNROW Clinic filed an action to enforce the $7.2 million default judgment against Townley. UNROW argued the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in January 2010. In February 2010, the Clinic lost the appeal to compel the Attorney General to disclose Townley's identity and location. During a 2007 trip to Chile, clinic members were honored with a meeting hosted by President Michelle Bachelet of Chile. UNROW continues its work to enforce the judgment against Townley. The Clinic also engages in advocacy and education efforts to promote justice for crimes committed during the Pinochet era and to provide redress to the victims and their families. =Immigration: Defending United States derivative citizens against unlawful discrimination and deportation= The UNROW Clinic represents clients in immigration detention, or the early stages of removal proceedings. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has tried to deny the derivative citizenship of two of UNROW's clients based on the marital status of their parents at the time of their birth. UNROW has challenged this interpretation of an immigration statute as unconstitutional because it confers different rights to children born out of wedlock. In late 2009, UNROW won an immigration court case, in which the immigration court agreed that the client could not be deported because he was actually a U.S. citizen. In January 2011, UNROW presented oral argument at the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, on behalf of an immigration client appealing a final order of removal. In May 2011, in a split 2-1 decision, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals denied UNROW's client's petition for review.647 F.3d 120 (4th Cir. 2011) In September 2011, UNROW submitted a petition for a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court on behalf of this client. The Supreme Court denied certiorari in January, 2012. Due to this discriminatory citizenship law, UNROW's client will never be allowed to return to the United States. =International Human Rights: The Chagos Islanders= Forty years ago, the indigenous people of the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean were removed from their homeland to make way for construction of a U.S. military base on the island of Diego Garcia in the 1960s. Chagossian advocacy groups, as well as the UNROW Clinic, argue that this act was unlawful. The clinic engages in extensive work with the Chagossian diaspora in Mauritius and the United Kingdom. The clinic's advocacy for the Chagossians began in 2001 with litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in the case Bancoult v. McNamara.Bancoult v. McNamara, 214 F.R.D. 5 (D.D.C. 2003) The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which dismissed their claims on the grounds that the case raised a nonjusticiable political question.Bancoult v. McNamara, 445 F.3d 427 (D.C. Cir. 2006) UNROW's work for the Chagossians has been unique, partly because of its collaboration with legal counsel in London, France, and Mauritius. In 2008 and 2009, UNROW members traveled to London to attend the launch of the ‚ÄúLet Them Return‚Äù U.K. advocacy campaign and at the Law Lords hearing in Britain's highest court. The Chagossians continue their struggle for redress and the right to return home in the international courts of the European Union and United Nations. On March 5, 2012, UNROW and SPEAK Human Rights & Environmental Initiative launched a petition to the White House, calling upon the Obama administration to provide long-overdue redress to the Chagossians. Noting the passing of Lisette Talate, an inspirational member of the displaced population, the petition states the following: :The U.S. Government Must Redress Wrongs Against the Chagossians : :For generations, the Chagossians lived on the Chagos Archipelago in the Indian Ocean. But in the 1960s, the U.S. and U.K. governments expelled the Chagossians from their homes to allow the United States to build a military base on Diego Garcia. Facing social, cultural, and economic despair, the Chagossians now live as a marginalized community in Mauritius and Seychelles and have not been allowed to return home. The recent passing of the oldest member of the exiled population underscores the urgent need to improve the human rights of the Chagossians. We cannot let others die without the opportunity to return home and obtain redress. The United States should provide relief to the Chagossians in the form of resettlement to the outer Chagos islands, employment, and compensation. By April 4, 2012, the petition received more than 28,000 signatures‚Äîthat is, well over the 25,000-signature requirement by the \\"We the People\\" platform. The petition was signed by Noam Chomsky (signature #832). On December 11, 2012, the European Court of Human Rights issued a decision rejecting an application lodged on behalf of the Chagossians. The White House then responded to the petition ten days later on December 21, 2012 without acknowledging any responsibility to the Chagossian people on the part of the United States. UNROW continues advocating to bring light to the plight of the Chagossian people, including writing an article published in The Human Rights Brief in Spring 2013. After over a decade of issuing FOIA requests to the U.S. Government, in April 2013, UNROW made several FOIA requests to U.S. Government agencies cited as recipients of a U.S. State Department cable discussing the eviction of the Chagossians from their homeland, Diego Garcia. The cable had already received widespread public attention and was published by various public media news sources. The Department of State, on behalf of itself and the Defense Intelligence Agency, confirmed their possession of an identical document, but refused to disclose it and denied the FOIA request. On October 17, 2013 UNROW filed a lawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act against the U.S. Department of State and the Defense Intelligence Agency for their unlawful withholding of the cable. =Justice and recognition of the U.S. Government‚Äôs involvement in the assassination of General Ren√© Schneider in Chile= In 1970, Henry Alfred Kissinger, former National Security Advisor, and the U.S. Government sought to instigate a coup to prevent President Salvador Allende from taking office after he won a plurality in the presidential election. The plan contained two tracks to instigate the coup. Kissinger organized and coordinated Track II outside of the normal channels of command for covert operations and the initiative was unknown to the U.S. State Department. The CIA worked with three different groups of coup plotters to devise a plan to kidnap General Ren√© Schneider as part of the plan. General Schneider was publicly opposed to a military intervention of the constitutionally elected President. Under Kissinger's supervision, the CIA made 21 contacts with key military and carabinero (police) officers in Chile and on October 22, 1970, armed men using weapons provided by the CIA fatally wounded General Schneider. Schneider died three days later as a result of his gunshot wounds, and the CIA awarded US$35,000 to individuals implicated in the murder ‚Äú[i]n an effort to keep prior contact secret, maintain good will of the group, and for humanitarian reasons.‚Äù In 2001, Michael Tigar and UNROW filed an initial complaint on behalf of General Schneider's family members before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and named defendants Henry Alfred Kissinger, Richard McGarrah Helms, and the U.S. Government. The court dismissed the claims as nonjusticiable political questions, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the dismissal. The Supreme Court of the U.S. denied a writ of certiorari. As all domestic remedies had been exhausted, UNROW filed a petition to the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights, on behalf of the Schneider family against the U.S. Government. The U.S. is responsible for organizing and coordinating the kidnapping and extrajudicial killing of General Schneider, leading to numerous human rights violations. This case is ongoing. =International Human Rights: Tamil Advocacy= In 2009, the conflict between the Tamil Tigers and the Sri Lankan government ended in a devastating battle. The Sri Lanka government had pushed the rebel group, as well as Tamil civilians who were not affiliated with the group, into a small region in northeastern Sri Lanka. Human Rights Watch and the International Crisis Group reported thousands of civilian deaths, as the government indiscriminately bombed the region, and the rebel group did not allow civilians to leave for safer areas. Although there is international concern about the crimes committed by the rebel group, less attention is being paid to those perpetrated by the Sri Lankan government. On September 22, 2010, UNROW released a new report calling for the establishment of a new international tribunal to prosecute those most responsible for the crimes committed during the conflict. In December 2010, UNROW submitted evidence of human rights violations committed during the armed conflict to the United Nations Panel of Experts on Sri Lanka, which U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki- Moon appointed in 2010. In September 2011, UNROW filed a lawsuit, Devi v. Silva,Devi v. Silva, No. 11 Civ. 6675(JPO), 2012 WL 398626, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2012) on behalf of victims of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka against Shavendra Silva, a former military general who commanded the 58th Division of the Sri Lankan army during the war. Silva and troops operating under his command committed war crimes and crimes against humanity, according to the Report of the Secretary-General's Panel of Experts on Accountability in Sri Lanka.https://www.un.org/News/dh/infocus/Sri_Lanka/POE_Report_Full.pdf =Government accountability: Private military contractors= Government agencies, particularly Departments of State and Defense, employ private contractors to perform many functions in both Iraq and Afghanistan, including translators, interrogators and security for diplomats and other important personnel. Despite hundreds of allegations of abuse and aggravated violence, most notably the 2007 Blackwater shootings in Nisoor Square, few have been prosecuted or even investigated. UNROW is working to investigate and document the government's response to these allegations. To this end, UNROW has submitted four different Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to more than thirty federal agencies.UNROW Human Rights Impact Litigation Clinic's Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) Requests, Amnesty International. In June 2009, Amnesty International Senior Deputy Executive Director Curt Goering sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder regarding UNROW's FOIA request project. In September 2009, UNROW secured the release of 137 case investigation files from the U.S. Army Crime Records Center, and has since received more documents from the Office of Information and Privacy in the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, UNROW instigated a lawsuit against the Department of Defense challenging the application of its current FOIA regulations as inconsistent with the Act itself. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the Department of Defense agreed to revise its prior determination. =Fighting To End The Practice Of Placing Youth In Solitary Confinement = Solitary confinement in prisons is a tool for punishment and has been labeled as a form of torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment by the UN.Juan Mendez, United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, U.N. Doc. A/66/268 (Aug. 5, 2011), available at http://solitaryconfinement.org/uploads/SpecRapTortureAug2011.pdf The use of solitary confinement against incarcerated youth prompted UNROW students to develop an advocacy campaign, which included coalition letters to the United States Attorney General urging the federal government to stop placing youth in solitary confinement, and which culminated in a May 2013 panel entitled ‚ÄúYouth in Solitary Confinement: Facts, Justifications, and Potential Human Rights violations.‚Äù =International Human Rights: Coverage of the Rios Montt Trial= In January 2013, former Guatemalan dictator Jos√© Efra√≠n R√≠os Montt became the first former head of state to be put on trial for genocide and crimes against humanity by a national judiciary. In conjunction with the Center for Human Rights and Humanitarian Law at the Washington College of Law and the Human Rights Brief, the UNROW Clinic traveled to Guatemala in April 2013 to observe and provide legal analysis of the trial. UNROW and the Human Rights Brief wrote several articles comparing the international human rights standards for forensic evidence and command responsibility to those used at trial.

Laughlin and succeeded by Sung-Mo Kang. Personal life Suh was born in Korea on 22 April 1936. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1954 to join his father who was teaching at Harvard University. He completed his high school education at Browne & Nichols School before entering MIT as a freshman in 1955. He was naturalized in 1963 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He married Young Suh, and had four daughters. He is now the grandfather of seven children, named Kristian, Nick, Madeleine, Henry, Connor, Jacob, and Maeve. Career Suh began his career at MIT in 1970, where he was the Ralph E. & Eloise F. Cross Professor, Director of the Park Center for Complex Systems (formerly the Manufacturing Institute), and the Head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering for ten years from 1991 to 2001. He was also the Founding Director of the MIT Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity (1977‚Äì1984), the Founder and Director of the MIT-Industry Polymer Processing Program (1973‚Äì1984), Head of the Mechanics and Material Division of the Mechanical Engineering Department (1975-1977), and a member of the Engineering Council of MIT (1980‚Äì1984 and 1991‚Äì2001). In October 1984, Suh took a leave of absence from MIT to accept a Presidential Appointment at the National Science Foundation where he was in charge of engineering. President Ronald Reagan appointed him to this position and the U.S. Senate confirmed his appointment. During his tenure at NSF, he created a new direction for the Engineering Directorate and introduced a new organizational program structure for supporting engineering research in order to strengthen engineering education and research and \\"to insure that the United States will occupy a leadership position in engineering well into the 21st century.\\" He returned to MIT in January 1988. Suh was named president of KAIST in June 2006, and was re-elected to his position on 14 July 2010. He is also the Ralph E. & Eloise F. Cross Professor, Emeritus, M.I.T. As the President of KAIST, he provided framework for two large-scale systems, On-Line Electric Vehicle (OLEV) and Mobile Harbor. During his term of office, he innovated the tenure review system for professors, increased the diversity of the faculty by increasing the number of female and international professors, provided more chances in admission for the students from non-special-purposed high schools, required English lecture for all undergraduate courses to better prepare students for international leadership, and introduced design education for all first year students to help them develop problem solving abilities. He also contributed to improve major educational indices of KAIST in terms of world university ranking and the reserved amount of donations. However, there were concerns that his policies while president of KAIST encouraged \\"academic Darwinism\\" among students, and during his presidency a spate of suicides took place at the university. When a KAIST student wrote a blog post that was critical of his policies, Suh sued him for libel. Suh was also criticized for decisions to award honorary doctoral degrees to some of the board of trustees of KAIST, which could be seen by some as unethical as the board of trustees oversees Suh's role as the president of KAIST. Out of 16 honorary degrees awarded, at least seven were given to the former or present board members.

(Some sources give his date of birth as 1886.e.g. Grove Music Online; ed. by L. Macy; article on C√©sar Vezzani (accessed 11 November 2007).) Career C√©sar Vezzani was born in Bastia in Corsica; his father died shortly before his birth. Soon after 1900 his family moved to Toulon on the French mainland, but little is known about his early musical training. In 1908 he went to Paris to study singing and was taught by the Corsican soprano Agn√®s Borgo (1879 - 1958). He then made his operatic d√©but at the Op√©ra-Comique in 1911 in the title-role of Richard Coeur-de-Lion by Gr√©try. He continued singing there in such works as Dinorah by Meyerbeer and Erlanger's La sorci√®re, as well as Italian operas such as Tosca and Cavalleria Rusticana. In 1913 Vezzani and Agn√®s Borgo were married, and they had one daughter. (They later divorced in 1919, and Vezzani had two subsequent marriages.) Vezzani and Borgo were contracted to sing in the USA (including Boston) in 1914/1915 but were prevented by the outbreak of the First World War. Vezzani was called up and was wounded in action. He resumed his singing career during the later years of the war, but most of his subsequent engagements were in provincial opera houses, especially in the south of France, though he also sang in Brussels. He returned to the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris in 1921/1922 and probably appeared there again during the 1920s, but he never sang at the Paris Op√©ra. The ringing and heroic quality of his voice made him an ideal choice for certain heavy and dramatic tenor parts, but he never abandoned some of the more lyrical roles of the French repertoire. During World War II Vezzani spent time in North Africa, singing frequently in Algiers. He continued as principal tenor in Toulon until 1948 when he suffered a stroke which left him paralyzed. He returned to Bastia, but now without an income he spent the last three years of his life in some poverty and assisted by the generosity of friends. He died in hospital in Marseille and was buried in Bastia, where a street is named after him. Recordings The potential of Vezzani's outstanding voice for recording was quickly recognised, and from 1912 to 1914 he made a series of recordings for French Od√©on, including excerpts from Pagliacci. Tosca, and Werther. Then from 1923 until the early 1930s he recorded for French HMV in arias from many of his favourite roles, including Reyer's Sigurd, Hal√©vy's La Juive, and Meyerbeer's L'Africaine. There was also a complete recording of Gounod's Faust in 1930 with Mireille Berthon and Marcel Journet. It is unclear whether and when Vezzani sang Wagner on stage, but he recorded a number of pieces from Lohengrin and The Ring. In total he recorded over 170 sides. Most of these were originally released only in France, but there have been several selections transferred to CD, and a systematic reissue of his recordings has been launched by Marston Records. Reputation Critics have shown universal recognition of the exceptional quality of Vezzani's voice, though they have sometimes expressed reservations about the subtlety of his approach, which was generally robust. His recording of Faust has occasioned the following comments: \\"Vezzani is a noble representative of that vanished breed, the French spinto tenor... Unforced lyricism was not Vezzani's greatest strength... [but] where ringing excitement is called for, his only equals are Caruso and, more recently, Franco Corelli.\\"Kenneth Furie, in: Opera on record, v.1; ed. by Alan Blyth (London, Hutchinson, 1979), pp.453-454. Referring to his recording of excerpts from Rom√©o et Juliette, another critic has said: \\"He was a real t√©nor de force and still singing well at sixty. There is little nuance here, but the voice is healthy and brilliant, somehow typically Corsican.\\"Richard Law, in: Opera on record, v.2; ed. by Alan Blyth (London, Hutchinson, 1983), p.204.

The Australian author Joan Benbow writes in her book A walkabout life () that in Papua New Guinea she was also known under the name Marmee. She was born in Ypres, Belgium in 1907. She was one of the founders of the small mountain village Fane in Central Province, Papua New Guinea, where she was known in Papua New Guinea as \\"Sister Simona\\". At the age of 84 she died in an airplane crash in the Papuan mountains on July 5, 1990.  Award  In October 1989 she was made a Knight of the Order of L√©opold II, for services to the people of Goilala and Papua New Guinea as a whole, awarded by Wilfried de Pauw, Belgian ambassador to Australia and Papua New Guinea.  Quotes  *\\"Having one big nose might be better than having two little ones.\\" *\\"I'll never go back to Belgium. To do what? Is there still something to be done? Papua New Guinea is where I belong and were I'll die.\\" *\\"My people in the tribes would consider it an honour if I offered them my body to be eaten. Having a look at myself it would for sure be a long extended meal.\\"  Personal life  In 1923 at the age of 16 Simona Noorenbergh read a story in a French magazine on Papua New Guinea. She told her parents that she immediately wanted to leave home to live in that country. This was refused. When she became very sick and her parents feared for her life they promised her that, when she got better, she would be allowed to go to New Guinea. Soon she was cured. As the only way to get to New Guinea was to be sent by a religious organisation, she studied to become a nun at the congregation Lady of The Sacred Heart at Stockel, Brussels. In 1928, after she finished her novitiate she took a train from Brussels to Marseille and then left on a 3-month packet trade ship to Port Moresby where she was dropped off. She arrived at the age of 21 in the Goilala mountains by horse on December 8, 1928. She worked and lived successively in Popole, Ononghe, Bema, Kosige, Boroko, Boregaina, Waima, Inauia and Fane. During many years she was confronted with the dominant disease Yaws, with heavy never-ending tribe wars and with cannibalism. In an interview with Elizabeth Kogomoni-Sowei of the Post-Courier in 1989 she mentions smiling that she was asked several times \\"to voluntarily offer my body for celebration. It would be considered an honour\\", she continues, \\"to be entirely and literally consumed and eaten, as in certain tribes they believe that then my spirit would stay forever in their village.\\" She gained respect by learning several local languages and became a jack-of- all-trades: teacher, nurse, singer, welfare officer, designer of clothes, organiser of primitive hospitals and elementary schools and educational services, and co-founder of Fane (quote Simona Noorenbergh: \\"This is where I belong, this is where I'll die.\\"), the mountain village in Central Province. Due to her respectable age, the local chiefs and people saw her as a guru and grandmother of all (the oldest age of Papuans at that time in Papua New Guinea was 50 to max 55 years) and they came by foot from far through the jungle to get her opinion on family issues and tribe problems. At the age of 83 she went to Australia to have an eye-operation as she became practically blind. The operation succeeded but she crashed with an airplane when she got back to Fane in the Papua's. Due to a typhoon the Britten Norman Islander light aircraft hit a ridge-top in the Owen Stanley Ranges and slammed into a tree in the rugged terrain of Woitape in Central Province. Noorenbergh, sitting next to the pilot, was one of the 8 people who died, 4 survived. She is buried in Fane where she received a local funeral.  Dedication  The operatic trilogy \\"The Accacha Chronicles\\", a secular, contemporary classical, music drama in Latin about Death, Birth and Love by Nicholas Lens, published by Schott Music Mainz/New York, has been entirely dedicated to Simona Noorenbergh by the author/composer.

Chicago School Though not yet named as such, media studies' roots are in the Chicago School and thinkers such as John Dewey, Charles Cooley and George Mead. These authors saw American society on the cusp of positive social change toward pure democracy. Mead argued that for an ideal society to exist, a form of communication must be developed to allow the unique individual to appreciate the attitudes, viewpoints and positions of others unlike himself, and allow him to be understood by others as well. Mead believed that this \\"new media\\" would allow humans to empathize with others, and therefore moves toward an \\"ideal of human society.\\"Mead, George Herbert. \\"Obstacles and Promises in the Development of an Ideal Society.\\" Mind, Self & Society, pp. 317‚Äì28. Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1934. Where Mead sees an ideal society, Dewey names it the \\"Great Community,\\" and further asserts the assumption that humans are intelligent enough for self-government, and that that knowledge is \\"a function of association and communication.\\"Dewey, John. \\"Search for the Great Community.\\" The Public and Its Problems, pp. 143‚Äì84. New York: Henry Holt & Co., 1927. \\"Nature, Communication, and Meaning.\\" Experience and Nature, pp. 138‚Äì70. Similarly, Cooley asserts that political communication makes public opinion possible, which in turn promotes democracy. Each of these authors represent the Chicago School's attention to electronic communication as a facilitator of democracy, its faith in the informed electorate, and its focus on the individual as opposed to the mass. First M.A. Media Studies program in the U.S. The social impact of mass communication has been studied at The New School University in New York since its founding in 1919. The first college course to investigate the motion picture was offered here in 1926. Marshall McLuhan's colleague, John Culkin, brought his Center for Understanding Media to The New School in 1975 and The New School began offering the Master of Arts degree in Media Studies, one of the first graduate programs of its kind.http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school-of-media-studies-about/ Today, among other programs,http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/school- of-media-studies-degrees-and-programs/ MA in Media Studies is still being offered by School of Media Studies, The New School, which will celebrate 40th anniversary of Media Studies at The New School during the academic year 2015-2016http://smscommons.newschool.edu/news/2015/09/14/media-studies-40th- anniversary-celebration-fall-2015-spring-2016/ Propaganda studies Between the First and Second World Wars, the Institute for Propaganda Analysis briefly rose to importance. Their definition of propaganda was > \\"expression of opinion or action by individuals or groups deliberately > designed to influence opinion or actions of other individuals or groups with > reference to predetermined ends.\\" Harold Lasswell, who worked in the paradigm of the Chicago School of sociology wrote Propaganda Technique in the World War, which included this definition of propaganda: > \\"Propaganda in the broadest sense is the technique of influencing human > action by the manipulation of representations. These representations may > take spoken, written, pictorial or musical form.\\" These definitions of propaganda clearly show that this was a school of thought that focused on media effects, as it highlighted the influence that media could have over its audiences attitudes and actions. Epitomizing this early school of media effects studies are experiments done by The Experimental Section of the Research Branch of the U.S. War Department's Information and Education Division. In the experiments, the effects of various U.S. wartime propaganda films on soldiers were observed. Current Propaganda studies are applied into many fields besides politics. Herman described a propaganda model as \\"a model of media behavior and performance, not of media effects.\\" (Herman, 2000, p. 63) He argued: \\"They are profit-seeking business, owned by very wealthy people (or other companies); and they are funded largely by advertisers who are also profit-seeking entities, and who want their advertisements to appear in a supportive selling environment.\\"(Herman, 2000, p. 62) He also presented \\"five factors: owner ship, advertising, sourcing, flak and anti-communist ideology-work as filters through which information must pass, and that individually and often in cumulative fashion they greatly influence media choices.\\" Until now, there is no conclusion of propaganda, debate still continues. Frankfurt School Critical Theory Typified by the philosophical and theoretical orientations of Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, Leo Lowenthal, and Herbert Marcuse, the Frankfurt school contributed greatly to the development and application of critical theory in media studies. Their Marxist critique of market-driven media was critical of its atomizing and leveling effects. The Frankfurt school also lamented the effects of the \\"culture industry\\" on the production and appreciation of art. For example, in A Social Critique of Radio Music, Adorno asserts: > \\"‚Ä¶music has ceased to be a human force and is consumed like other consumers‚Äô > goods. This produces ‚Äòcommodity listening‚Äô‚Ä¶The listener suspends all > intellectual activity.\\" As the Frankfurt school lamented on the effects of the \\"culture industry\\" they also began to identify mass culture and high culture as two distinct entities. Scholars like Benjamin (1936) and Adorno (1945) can be credited with what would eventually become known as popular culture and high culture. Their finite distinction of equating original production with ritualistic behavior as compared with mass culture that finds its identifying symbols in reproductions. These reproductions are souless and lacking in definition and originality. Media effects The less paradigm in media studies since the Second World War has been associated with the ideas, methods and findings of Paul F. Lazarsfeld and his school: media effect studies. Their studies focused on measurable, short-term behavioral ‚Äòeffects‚Äô of media and concluded that the media played a limited role in influencing public opinion. The \\"Limited- Effects\\" Model developed by Lazarsfeld and his colleagues from Columbia was highly influential in the development of media studies. The model claims the mass media has \\"limited-effects\\" on voting patterns. Voters are influenced, rather, through the ‚Äòtwo-step flow‚Äô model, the idea that media messages are disseminated through personal interaction with ‚Äòopinion leaders‚Äô. The model of limited- effects was so influential that the question of media \\"effects\\" on politics was left largely unaddressed until the late 1960s. Eventually Mass Communication scholars began to study political behavior again and the limited-effects model was called into question.Chaffee, Steven H., & Hockheimer, J.. \\"The Beginnings of Political Communication Research in the United States: Origins of the ‚ÄòLimited Effects‚Äô Model.\\" The Media Revolution in America & Western Europe, pp. 267‚Äì96. Ed. Ev Rogers & F. Balle. Norwood, N.J.: Ablex, 1985. Uses and gratification model As a response to the previous emphasis upon media effects, from the 1970s researchers became interested in how audiences make sense of media texts. The \\"uses and gratifications\\" model, associated with Jay Blumler and Elihu Katz, reflected this growing interest in the 'active audience'. One such example of this type of research was conducted by Hodge and Tripp, and separately Palmer, about how school-children make sense of the Australian soap opera Prisoner. They found that pupils could identify with the prisoners: they were \\"shut in\\", separated from their friends and wouldn't be there had they not been made to be, etc. Also, the children could compare the wardens to their teachers: \\"the hard- bitten old [one], the soft new one, the one you could take advantage of...\\"John Fiske summarises: > The children inserted meanings of the program into their social experience > of school in a way that informed both -- the meanings of school and the > meanings of Prisoner were each influenced by the other, and the fit between > them validated the other.

It was built as a vaudeville theater and opened as the Loews Warfield on May 13, 1922. History In the 1920s, The Warfield was a popular location that featured vaudeville and other major performances, such as Al Jolson, Louis Armstrong, and Charlie Chaplin. The theater opened as the Loews Warfield, named after David Warfield. It later became known as the Fox Warfield. New Life came to the Warfield in 1979 when Bob Dylan played 14 shows at the start of his first Gospel Tour in November 1979, and again 12 shows in November 1980 during his \\"A Musical Retrospective Tour\\". The Warfield had an appeal as a rock concert venue because it has more intimacy and better sound quality than an arena, yet has an occupancy of over 2,000 persons. The venerable hall has been rocking ever since. Like many historic theaters, its main floor had the seats removed in the 1980s for general admission and dancing. Prior to the removal of the seats, Joe Strummer of The Clash once refused to play unless the first two rows of seats were removed to allow for dancing.The Clash, Tough But Tender, They're Taking America James Henke in Rolling Stone 4/17/80, Retrieved 4/4/08 It is a favorite venue for performance among many entertainers.Frogs & Oysters: A Les Claypool Interview Mike Powers, jambase.com, 1/26/01, Retrieved January 26 2008 In 1980, the Grateful Dead played 15 sold-out shows there, featuring both an acoustic and two electric sets. The shows were a celebration of the band's fifteenth anniversary and done as a show of appreciation for their loyal fans. These, along with a sold-out 8 night run at New York's Radio City Music Hall were recorded for release as two double albums; one, all acoustic called Reckoning, the other, electric, called Dead Set. Jerry Garcia also made the Warfield a second home, performing a record 88 times there with his various side bands, when not touring with the Dead. On May 9, 1991, Guns N' Roses performed the first of a few \\"secret warm-up theatre gigs\\" prior to the official opening of their Use Your Illusion Tour. Current use as music venue In 2001, thrash metal band Slayer recorded the concert film War at the Warfield (2003) there. On November 12, 2003, hard rock band Korn performed during a small club tour, which is a rarity for the band. The Killers played there on December 12, 2008, after previously canceling their show on November 21, due to an unknown injury. In May 2008, The Warfield changed management. The final show with Bill Graham Presents performance by Phil Lesh ran until 3:30 AM, May 19, 2008. The venue was closed pending renovations by new lessee, Goldenvoice/AEG Live. It was scheduled to reopen in September 2008, with George Lopez to give the first performance. In September 2011, Dream Theater played their first U.S. show with Mike Mangini on the Dramatic Turn of Events Tour at the Warfield. This was their first show in the U.S. without founding drummer Mike Portnoy.

Abiriba is pronounced [/E\`biriba\`/] and it is in Ohafia Local Government Area.  History  The people who occupy the territory known as Abiriba descended from the Igbo and Efik people of Calabar. They migrated from the upper Cross River area centuries ago led by a Nnachi Oke, from whom the title \\"Enachioken\\" (\\"The Monarch\\") originates. Initially, they occupied a smaller territory which expanded when the Abiriba people routed the surrounding Nkporo people and took over their lands. The Abiriba people were war-like and quickly established themselves in the area. The origin of the Abiriba people is not as speculative as the origin of other Igbos of southeastern Nigeria. Historical evidence supports the fact that Abiriba people have common ancestor with the Bahumono and Yakor tribe of Ekoi of cross river basin and the people of Arochukwu. At Ekoi, constant disputes between the seven families under Ukpaghiri prompted the clan to move to Ena and finally to Akpa. The settlement at Akpa was difficult for many years due to hostilities with neighbors. After the death of Ukpaghiri, Mbiriba and his group moved to Usukpam and stayed there for many years but were never at peace with the neighbors. Mbiriba decided to move to Udara-ebuo whereas Otusi led the other branch of the family down stream and eventually founded Arochukwu. The term Nwajim is often used between Abiriba and Arochukwu people because of our common lineage. Mbiriba who had advanced in age, moved his group once more and settled at Udara-ebuo. Nature was inhospitable to the inhabitants at Udara-ebuo. There was no water and the place was overrun by monkeys. Oral history has it that monkeys used to visit homes to look for food, and the people became sick living on monkey meat only. Mbiriba died at Udara-ebuo and left his son Ifa Mbiriba in charge. Ifa Mbiriba finally moved to Uruanta and Agboha and settled there. The new settlement was very fertile and had a natural fortress. Thus, the name ABIRIBA was derived from the name Mbiriba or nickname \\"Ebiri-Aba\\". Oko Ogo opened Ndi Okogo which is currently where the Chief's Palace \\"The Agboezi\\" is situated. Nwagu Ifa founded Okagwe and later Agboji. Ngwu founded Ihungwu. Chukwu Oke founded Amogudu. The name Amaeke was derived from the market day Eke. The Capital of Abiriba is Ameke and the paramount Chief for the whole Abiriba uses the title Enachi-oken. Incessant conflicts and border skirmishes between the Item and Amogudu led to the creation of a standing army in form of the age-grade system. Historical artifacts exist to support the consensus that the age-grade system started at Amogudu. Nwagu Ifa, Ngwu, Oko Ogo and Chukwu Oke used the age-grade as a standing army to protect the Abiriba from hostile neighbors. The kingdom grew into three principal clans; AMEKE, AGBOJI AND AMAOGUDU. Ameke developed into 10 traditional villages and later into 11 villages about 1941. These villages are Amaeke Echichi, Ihungwu, Agboha, Ihebu, Umueso, Amaebelu, Amaja, Amanta, Amuba, Binyum, and Ukpo. Aboji has 2 traditional villages namely Amabia and Amagbo. Finally, Amaogudu has 4 villages to wit: Umuechukwu, Amamba, Ogbu and Udanta. Amaeke Echichi has 10 traditional Ezi namely Ihungwu ‚Äì 7 compounds, Umueso ‚Äì 19 compounds, Amaja ‚Äì 9 compounds, Ihebu ‚Äì 9 compounds, Amaebelu ‚Äì 7 compounds, Amanta 14 compounds, Amuba 12 compounds, Agboha 3 compounds ( formally 8 compounds) Biyum ‚Äì 9 compounds and Ukpo 7 compounds. Amabia -9 compounds, and Amagbo -7 compounds, Umuechukwu -20 compounds, Amamba -14 compounds, Ogbu -8 compounds and Udanta -16 compounds. Apart from these traditional villages, Abiriba Kingdom, in recent times has further expanded with the formation of 72 different layouts spreed across the three principal clans.  Geography  The Abiriba people are known to be industrious both in crafts and trading; their arid lands make it tough for agriculture to flourish. These made them popular amongst the Igbo people of Nigeria. As a matter of fact, in the history of the Igbos of Nigeria, Abiriba is reckoned for her pre-historical black smithing and sculpture artifacts. These ancient occupation of the Abiriba people later on metamorphosed into what is today the trademark of the people - Trading (or better merchandise) popularly known among Abiriba People. Since the people were predominantly merchants, they were widely travelled both within and outside the boundaries of Nigeria, and they are correspondingly cosmopolitan. Being so exposed and prosperous, the people have enough information about vogue and money that made them transform their locality from the normal village setting, as is common with the surrounding villages, to a model sub-urban but purely residential setting with some of the most exotic building in the Igbo land, even in Nigeria as a whole. The Abiriba people take great pride in the serenity and aesthetic value of their landscape, consequently shunning attempts by government or individuals to set up factories in the town, and seeing same as attempts to \\"pollute\\" their land. In 1959, the late President of Nigeria, The Rt Honourable Dr Nnamdi Azikiwe was so taken in by the beauty of Abiriba that he called it the \\"Small London\\" - a name in use till date and forever. Round about agbo court was the first major junction in Abiriba.  Government  = Monarchical system of 3 villages = Abiriba is made up of three main villages: Ameke, Agboji, & Amogudu. Abiriba is governed using a monarchical system. The \\"Eze\\" (The King or Monarch) is called Enachioken. The people of Abiriba have experienced little direct impact of the government in their development and governance except in very recent times. In the instances when the government has actively involved itself in the life of the town, there is a consensus that the effects have been rather minimal and in some cases detrimental. Abiriba has a well-developed and active Age-Grade system, one of the most effective ones in Igbo land. Some Age-Grades include: Akahaba, Erinma I & II, Ekpankuma I & II, Onyiba, Egwuena, Ojighiri, Isimini, Okezie etc., Amogudu people start age grade and are the founders of age-grade, they as well give the age grade's name & they have the right to change the name based on the achievement of the age grade. These age grades maintain offices in all countries of the world where Abiriba people reside. The Age Grades have been the main agents of development in the town, especially those in the diaspora. They also play the traditional role of policing the community and punishing offenders, regardless of age and status. It is often witnessed where a notable and wealthy member of an Age Grade is whipped publicly due to an offence. The Enachioken of Abiriba is what the Abiriba Royals called ekwu-eto, consisting of Eze Ameke \\"King of Ameke\\", as the leader (known as Enachioken), Eze Agboji \\"King of Agboji\\" (known as Iffa), Eze Amogudu \\"King Of Amogudu\\" (known as Ukpaghari and Eze Otisi Abiriba). The Ezeship (Monarchy) is hereditary and rotates within the royal families that have the birth-rights of producing the Enachioken. Ndi Ogogo (now known as Nde ogo) is where the palace of the Enachioken is situated; the other three compounds that make up the ruling compound Amaelunta-Umueso viz, Nde Ezema, Nde Mbaku, and Nde Ekpe are in Ameke. In Agboji Abiriba, the kingship is chosen from the two traditional formal compounds; Ezi-elu and Ezi-agbor. The current monarch is Eze-Efa Uche Benjamin Agu who ascended the throne after the death of Late Eze-efa Agwu Ndukwe. It is of record that the late Eze-Efa Agwu Ndukwe of Agboji was not an heir to the throne and this as such lead to his short period being a King. The tradition demand that an heir must be chosen to handle the mantle of leadership. The current Eze-Efa emerged and he is a descendant of the Efa lineage that was believed to be the foremost King of Agborji-Abiriba. In Amogudu there are Nde Agwu, Nde Ebe and Amelu. Amelu comprises four compounds, of which only Nde Aso rules; it goes only to the family of Late Eze Mang Dieke. They have their traditional functions distinct from producing the Enachioken. In Amogudu, the Kingship is hereditary and rotates between Nde Agwu, Nde Ebe and Nde Aso except for Umu Okocha according to ancient history and tradition. This has been the tradition for generations as laid down by Chukwu Oke Ukpabi himself and the Kingship is for the children and descendants of Chukwu Oke Ukpabi who is the founder and first King of Amogudu. There was a conflict over rightful Kingship between \\"Umu Okocha\\" usurping the throne with claims that all the rightful children of Chukwu Oke Ukpabi are dead within the early 2000s. These claims were proven to be false by the testimonies of the descendants of Chukwu Oke Ukpabi which included the late Abiriba Historian Chief Ejim Akuma's children; Prince Ikwan Ejim Akuma, Prince Oko Ejim Akuma being at the forefront and others. Whilst the later \\"Umu Okocha\\" held unto the throne briefly, history records that the ancestors of Umu-Okocha Oboro against whom Ndi Okocha compound was named are not of Chukwu Oke Ukpabi and therefore not entitled to be members of the Otisi Heritage \\"Kingship\\". They have their \\"Ihundichie\\" alongside that of their mother's father Awaife at \\"Ndi Okocha\\". In the midst of it all, The current Monarch of Amogudu is undisputably loved as a good man that is determined to bring unity to the Kingdom and has been working together with the other Kings to bring about Unity to the Kingdom. However, the displacement and prejudice towards Umu-Agwu and the remnants of the crisis between Umu Agwu and Nde Okocha remains a matter that is yet to be resolved. His inaction towards a total balance of truth in this matter seems to be the only subject of controversy surrounding his Kingship till date. = Rules of succession to throne of Enachioken = Succession to the throne of the Enachioken is hereditary. It is only the descendants of the founder of Abiriba that rule over the kingdom. Such descendants must emerge from any of the ruling houses in the three royal compounds # Nde Oke-ogo (Nde Ezema) # Nde Mbaeku # Nde Ekpe Who ruled Abiriba in rotation. The Enachioken of Abiriba originally emerges from Nde Oko-ogo Royal compound alone. However, due to developments, some of the descendants of the founder of Abiriba moved over to Amaelunta to ply their blacksmith trade. From Amaelunta ( Nde Mbaeku and Nde Ekpe), they come to rule Abiriba when it is their turn to do so. = Social control = The traditional Abiriba society evolved a system that took care of its actual policing and military needs ranging from guarding her territorial integrity, settlement of disputes between communities or individuals and punishment of crime against the person and community. The Eze Enachioken, Ikwukwuma, Uke-ji-abala, Uke uche-oba, Uke Ekpe and Uke Ogba Ngwuru etc. kept the peace, enforced social order and cohesion. Crime and delinquency was at its minimal, people moved around with relative easy and fear of crime was non existent as every male from seven years of age already has a place in the social control structure of Abiriba. In the accepted oral history of Abiriba as cited in Uche (2010), are documented efforts made by men and the gods at social control. According to him, Amaogudu (a community in Abiriba) created a surveillance group from the Uke Ogba Ngwuru. Its formation was in an attempt to provide information and warn the warriors of invaders. Subsequently, it was also use to report suspicious movement and crime. Also the Uke Uche-oba has as its manifest function to keep watch at the yam barn. This duty they perform for two or three years as they case maybe. However, at the end of their expedition, the miscreants among them were not allowed to return. This long vigil away from home was an opportunity to rid society of such persons (Obasi, 2003). Following the return of the Uke Uche-oba, they will assume a new name Uke Ekpe and from this moment on, they shoulder the responsibility of social control and executing punishment through the most senior age grade, the Uke- ji-abala, the age grade responsible for law and order under the directive of Eze Enachioken (Akuma, n.d; Uche, 2008; Obasi, 2003). The role of a belief system is not left out in the Abiriba social control mechanism, as it was common knowledge that the gods will punish evil doers. The concept of evil Obasi (2003), stated involves doing things the society forbids which includes stealing, poisoning, taking someone else's wife, destruction of another person's farm, incest, homosexuality etc. Thus the gods, Otisi Binyom, Kamalu Ozua elu, Kamalu Nde ebe and Isimokoto, Iyieru and Akakpo (gods of the sea) virtually policed the community according to the belief of the people. He stressed that belief system rendered a very useful social service in the nature of crime prevention where there were no policemen or prison (Akuma, n.d; Uche, 2008; Obasi, 2003). It should however be noted that these social control mechanism can impose any of these sanctions: fines and compensation, ritual cleansing, trial by ordeals, ridicule and gossips, confinement, ostracism, banishment, capital punishment and socialization as a process of punishment to any defaulter of the laws of the community. Today in Abiriba, not much has changed as those traditional institutions of social control are still in existence and the various gods still potent. However, they now lack jurisdiction to convict and punish offenders, this followed a decision that was taken at the 1958 constitutional conference to abolish customary criminal law in Nigeria altogether (Okonkwo, 2009).  Culture  = Okpu Achi tree and its myth = At the heart of Abiriba ‚Äîthe very center of the town‚Äîis a large, ancient tree \\"Okpu Achi\\" (Achi tree). The tree is both symbolic and spiritual in nature; and many believe that in the event of its fall, water from Okpu Achi would engulf the entire Abiriba land. Legend also has it that the Ishimokoto RiverAbiriba Continued is so mystical that when foreigners tried to leave town with a bottle of water from the river‚Äîthe bottle broke apart and the water flew miles back to the river. = Cuisine = Abiriba is known for some of its unique dishes. Among other foods such as rice, yam, beans, and garri (cassava), \\"Asusu\\" is a very common dish among the Abiriba people. It is made of corn starch whole meal ground with salt and pepper, wrapped with a local leaf usually called akwukwo-asusu and steamed with water covering all the wraps. Asusu is eaten with a popular vegetable soup called Ugboghor. \\"Oto\\" (ground water-yam porridge) is also very popular among the Abiriba people. = Naming traditions = Common Abiriba names include: Ikwan or Ikhwan, Kalu, Nnanna, Nnenna \\"Nina\\", Ndukwo, Ogbogu, Agwu, Oyediya, Ogbonnaya, etc. It is a common Abiriba naming tradition for parents to name their first son after the father's father and the first daughter after the father's mother. Naming traditions are paternal-oriented, Abiriba is a matrilineal society: descent and inheritance are traced through the mother's family. Prominent Abiriba People  Abiriba is origin to Nigerian celebrities like Uche Jombo Rodriguez ( Nollywood Superstar ), Bourdex Telecom (The first Telecom operator in Nigeria before MTN or GLO), Ndukwe Onuoha (advertising creative director and spoken word poet), Late Dike Udensi (DUBIC beer, DUBIC malt etc.), Joseph Ikwan Ejim fondly called Jay Ikwan ( Recording & Performing Artiste, Entrepreneur & Christian Minister ), Ebitu Ukiwe (The Vice president and former governor of Lagos).

He saw active service in India, helped to run a military railway in the Crimean War and then managed various groups of volunteers working with the army. He was eventually knighted. Biography He was the son of Lieutenant-Colonel Archibald McMurdo of Loch Arthur, Kirkcudbrightshire and commissioned in the 8th Foot in 1837. In 1841 he became lieutenant in the 22nd Foot which went to India that year. There he served under Sir Charles Napier and in 1843 was involved in the battles of Miani and Hyderabad. In the latter he was wounded and also mentioned in dispatches. Later that year he was promoted to captain in the 28th Foot but then transferred to the 78th Highlanders. In 1844 he married Napier's daughter. When Napier returned to India in 1849, McMurdo went with him as his aide-de-camp.Lloyd, E M, 'McMurdo, Sir William Montagu Scott (1819‚Äì1894)', rev Roger T Stearn, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 . Retrieved 25 February 2007 In 1853 he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and acted as assistant adjutant-general in Dublin. The following year he was appointed director-general of the newly formed Land Transport Corps and went to Crimea to assist in running the Grand Crimean Central Railway. He eventually took it over from the contractors Peto, Brassey and Betts. He received from the French the L√©gion d'honneur (fourth class) and from the Turks the Mejidiye (fourth class). After the end of the Crimean War the Land Transport Corps was converted into the Military Train in 1857 and McMurdo was made its colonel-commander. From 1860 he became involved with the volunteers working with the army and became the inspector-general of volunteers. In 1865 he established the Engineer and Volunteers Staff Corps. He also became the colonel of the Inns of Court Volunteers and of the Engineer and Volunteers Staff Corps. From 1866 to 1870 he commanded a brigade in the Dublin district, then in the Rawalpindi district in Bengal from 1870 to 1873. He was promoted major-general in 1868, lieutenant-general in 1876 and general in 1878. He was colonel of the 69th Foot in 1876, then transferred to the 15th Foot in 1877 and the 22nd Foot (Cheshire Regiment) in 1888. In 1881 he was made KCB and subsequently GCB in 1893. He was a councillor of the Oxford Military College in Cowley and Oxford Oxfordshire from 1876 to 1894. He died in Nice in 1894.

He is credited as engineer, remixer, vocalist, songwriter, percussionist, drummer, bass player, pianist, keyboardist or artist on albums by Die Warzau, GoFight, Sister Machine Gun, Bj√∂rk, Pigface, Pansy Division, The Swans, Haloblack, Chris Connelly, KMFDM, Skrew, Machines of Loving Grace, Stabbing Westward, Gravity Kills, Everplastic, Screaming Rachel, Dessau, Chemlab, The Final Cut, Testify, Mindfunk, Little Louis and various other artists across many different genres. His work can be heard on some of the most popular tracks by many of these groups, such as the Pigface's \\"Asphole\\", \\"Aboriginal\\", \\"Steamroller\\", etc., KMFDM's \\"Light\\", Sister Machine gun's \\"Wired\\", \\"Lung\\", \\"Nothing\\", etc. Die Warzau In the late eighties, Jim Marcus and his partner Van Christie were working as individual performance artists in Chicago, Illinois. Their early shows as the band kept their performance art roots and were less about music than destruction and visual mayhem, garnering attention from fans, members of the press, and police officers. Fiction Records, distributed in the United States by Polygram and at the time serving as home to bands like The Cure and Eat, added Die Warzau to its roster after a particularly destructive show created a minor public relations blitz in the city. In 1988 the band's first single, \\"I've Got to Make Sense,\\" reached number twenty-three on Billboard's dance chart and topped college club charts across the country. Their next single, \\"Land of the Free,\\" climbed to the top spot on the Billboard dance charts and stayed on the import charts for a record thirty-six weeks. Since Fiction was an English label, the record was classified as an import release. Despite a racy video that was banned on major media outlets and only played in clubs after midnight, the next single, \\"Welcome to America,\\" reached the number twelve spot on the Billboard dance charts. Later releases have gotten various degrees of play on various stations and channels. Songs such as Funkopolis, Red All Over, Liberated, and All Good Girls mystify straightforward musical consumers even while becoming commonplace on dance floors. The band is well known for its lack of subscription to any particular musical genre and refusal to accept label-level censorship. Marcus has worked with all sorts of artists as well, outside of the band, including the Supergroup Pigface. On the Invisible Records Website, Martin Atkins says this: > Notes from thee Underground - A wide array of participants, as Pigface began > to pick up steam. Louis Svitek of Ministry, Jim Marcus of Die Warzau, Ogre, > Genesis, Flea for fuck's sake! I think one of the landmark tracks on > Notes... has to be Asphole.

I remember sitting back > in one of the chairs (that always seemed to be broken) watching all these > guys hammering away on the huge drums, and thinking how lucky I was to be > enjoying this moment. Politics He leans politically far to the left and has been an outspoken proponent of gay rights and civil disobedience (Die Warzau's first T-shirt released for the album \\"convenience\\" had the slogan \\"Gay Soldiers Died, Too\\" on the front). He is well known for not playing shows sponsored by alcohol or tobacco companies and openly advocating that young men not register for the war, which Marcus considers illegal. He has spoken out openly against the death penalty and organized religion and in the early 1990s collected 1200 signatures urging the Pope of the Catholic Church to disband the church due to offenses against human dignity. He is a proponent of sex education as a means to promote consensuality and safety. His vast experience of adult education on the topic includes, in 2011, a guest presentation for a college-level human sexuality class at Northwestern University.

His designs, including such staple designer fonts as Aquiline, Lassigue D'Mato, and Prophecy, have been used for many book covers. He is credited with being one of the first \\"grunge\\" typographers, developing fonts such as Escalido, Glue, Airflo and Toreador that encouraged artists to step outside of comfortable design approaches and develop more uniquely troubled and chaotic works. His typefaces are used generously by artists such as Dave McKean, whose work mixes multiple media and is a good example of this sort of chaotic refinement of artistic energy.

She grew up in La Mesa, California and later moved to Mission Beach, California, where she was a single parent to a son, Raymond Somers Jr. Her hip-hop books are based on the drive-by shootings that killed the rappers six months apart in the midst of what has been called the West Coast-East Coast war. Each book is dedicated to the rappers' mothers. Early life and education Scott was born in San Diego, California. She attended Helix High School in La Mesa, California, Grossmont College and graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of Redlands in 1990. Scott is the daughter of the late author Eileen Rose Busby, and the late James (Jim) Scott, a Senior Olympics winner who helped pioneer and develop the game of racquetball. She is the granddaughter of California artist Esther Rose and Frank Rose (a sports writer at the Two Harbors, Minnesota, newspaper in the 1920s), and niece of the late Russian Orthodox hieromonk Seraphim Rose. Her brother is scientist and author J. Michael Scott. Her twin sister is antique store owner Cordelia Mendoza. Career Scott wrote poetry as a teenager and worked on the Helix High School yearbook during her senior year. Her first full-time newspaper position was as a reporter for the Beach & Bay Press in Mission Beach and Pacific Beach, in 1987. She also freelanced for the Mira Mesa Scripps Ranch Sentinel. She then became business editor of the La Jolla Light weekly newspaper after winning a Best of Show journalism award out of 1,200 entries from the San Diego Press Club. She then moved to a daily paper, the Vista Press, in North San Diego County. She left the Vista Press to string as a correspondent for the Associated Press and The San Diego Union-Tribune.

In 1993, she moved to the Mojave Desert as a crime beat reporter for the Las Vegas Sun, where she worked until 1998, then freelanced for The New York Times and the Reuters news service and wrote true-crime books and biographies. While still at the Sun, in 1997, her first book, The Killing of Tupac Shakur, was released. Huntington Press released the book on the first anniversary of Shakur's death, issuing a 25,000-copy first printing, according to Publishers Weekly, with a second edition released in 2002. The Killing of Tupac Shakur was number 2 on the Los Angeles Times bestseller list in paperback nonfiction the week of June 11, 2000. Scott's article, first published in George magazine, was included in the 2005 anthology Tupac: A Thug Life, a compilation of national magazine writers released by Plexus Publishing. She contributed to two other anthologies, The Big Book of Social Media (Yorkshire Publishing 2010) and Masters of True Crime (Prometheus Books 2012). Scott has coached writers, including at the Flathead River Writers Conference in Montana and San Diego State University's Writers' Conference. Scott taught journalism and advanced magazine writing for five years at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas School of Journalism until September 2005, when she traveled to New Orleans as an embedded reporter for Best Friends Animal Society to cover animal rescues in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina for its magazine and website. On her return from Louisiana, she hired on with Best Friends as a staff writer. She sat as the Nevada State Sunshine Chair for ten years, until 2007, and on the Society of Professional Journalists Sunshine Committee. From 2005 through 2007, Scott wrote a column titled \\"Crime & Punishment\\" for the alternative weekly Las Vegas CityLife. Her sixth book, Pawprints of Katrina: Pets Saved and Lessons Learned, with photos by Clay Myers and foreword by actress Ali MacGraw, was a result of Scott's nearly four months on the Gulf Coast writing about the largest rescue of animals in U.S. history. Her seventh book, The Rough Guide to True Crime, a title in the Rough Guides series of books, was released in August 2009 and featured at BookExpo America 2009.

In January 2011, Anderson Cooper's 360¬∞ blog included Scott in an update on the Tupac and Smalls cases, quoting her as saying that \\"the failure to secure the actual scene of the shooting and interview witnesses immediately doomed the investigation.\\" Her work has appeared in The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, New York Post, George magazine, Los Angeles Times, The Christian Science Monitor, San Diego Union-Tribune and Las Vegas Sun. On KTTV's \\"Good Day L.A.\\" in March 2013, Scott discussed the verdict against chef David Viens in the disappearance of his wife Dawn. Scott appeared twice on the public-access TV show Connie Martinson Talks Books in January 2003 to talk about the unsolved killing of Susan Berman and her book Murder of a Mafia Daughter and in November 2000 to discuss rapper The Notorious B.I.G. and the book The Murder of Biggie Smalls. She appeared on three Oxygen network \\"Snapped\\" segments concerning murder cases involving women and on Unsolved Mysteries about the Tupac Shakur investigation. In 2010 she appeared in the Discovery Channel's documentary, On the Case with Paula Zahn: Death in the Desert, about the Ted Binion trial. On November 7 and 8, 2015, she appeared on a FOX News special about Robert Durst to discuss details about Berman's relationship with Robert Durst covered in Scott's book Murder of a Mafia Daughter. Las Vegas CityLife newspaper named Scott's 2003 release, Murder of a Mafia Daughter, \\"Pick of the Week\\" in February of that year. In 2011, she wrote the introduction and foreword to military combat photographer Russell Klika's book Iraq: Through the Eyes of an American Soldier.

In May 2014, Scott lodged a complaint with YouTube over a re-created image included in rapper Wyclef Jean's music video \\"April Showers.\\" The controversy arose after Scott reported to YouTube that no attribution had been given, nor was permission sought for use of an autopsy photo released in Scott's book The Killing of Tupac Shakur. YouTube banned the video. TMZ, which broke the story, reported that video director Hezues R' and Scott had settled the matter and agreed upon a screen credit at the end of the video. Scott is a contributor to Psychology Today, ForbesWoman blog and Women in Crime Ink, described by The Wall Street Journal as \\"a blog worth reading.\\" In March 2015, her book Unconditional Honor: Wounded Warriors and Their Dogs, with photos by Clay Myers and foreword by Bill Walton, was released by Globe Pequot Press. Scott co-authored The Crime Book volume with American crime writers Shanna Hogan, Lee Mellor, Rebecca Morris and British author Michael Kerrigan, with a foreword for the U.S. edition by Scott and the U.K. edition by author Peter James.

It may also be referred to as the \\"tread\\" of the crankset. The term was coined by Grant Petersen during his time at Bridgestone Bicycles. The \\"Q\\" stands for \\"quack\\", a reference to the wide stance and waddling gait of ducks. Q Factor is a function of both the bottom bracket width (axle length) and the crank arms. Bottom brackets axles vary in length from 102mm to 127mm. Mountain bike cranks are typically about 20mm wider than road cranks. A larger Q Factor (wider tread) will mean less cornering clearance (while pedaling) for the same bottom bracket height and crank arm length. A smaller Q Factor (narrower tread) is desirable on faired recumbent bicycles because then the fairing can also be narrower, hence smaller and lighter. Sheldon Brown said that a narrower tread is ergonomically superior because it more closely matches the nearly-inline track of human footsteps. Research from The University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom suggests narrower Q Factors are more efficient, likely due to improved application of force during the pedal stroke, as well the potential for reduced knee variability and risk of injury.

Wave farms can be either offshore or nearshore, with the former the most promising for the production of large quantities of electricity for the grid. The first wave farm was constructed in Portugal, the Agu√ßadoura Wave Farm, consisting of three Pelamis machines. The world's largest is planned for Scotland. United Kingdom =Scotland= Funding for a wave farm in Scotland was announced on February 20, 2007 by the Scottish Executive, at a cost of over ¬£4 million, as part of a ¬£13 million funding packages for marine power in Scotland.

The Wave hub operates as an extension cable allowing developers to install and operate wave energy generating devices while keeping down connection costs. Four device operators have expressed an interest in using the site which will initially allow up to 20MW of wave energy capacity. Ocean Power Technologies (OPT), based in Pennington, New Jersey is involved in Wave Hub. Located in Cornwall, England, OPT aims to develop its PowerBuoy technology, an innovative renewable energy project, and expects to create the UK's first offshore facility for the demonstration and proving of arrays of wave energy generation devices. A 2017 study estimates that commercial wave farms are not close to being feasible. United States Wave power in the United States is under development in several locations off the east and west coasts as well as Hawaii. It has moved beyond the research phase and major installations are planned to come on-line within the next few years. Its use to-date has been for situations where other forms of energy production are not economically viable and as such, the power output is currently modest. According to the president of trade association Ocean Renewable Energy Coalition, ‚ÄúThe total potential off the coast of the United States is 252 million megawatt hours a year.‚ÄùWave Farms Show Energy Potential By Jason Margolis http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6410839.stm Despite the absence of current implementation of major projects, there has been significant investment on the part of public utility companies and federal funds for the implementation and economic viability of two new wave power energy centers as of September 30, 2008. On December 18, 2007 the Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the largest national utility company, announced a commercial agreement to purchase power generated by wave energy. This decision was made in part to be competitive in the public electrical energy market in the state of California under stringent renewable energy restrictions. Currently, California state law requires that publicly owned utilities are required to generate 20% of their electricity from renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and wave power by 2010. After the General Election on November 4, 2008 this law may be subject to change to an even more stringent law, which states that publicly owned utilities would be required to increase their proportion of electricity from renewable resources to 20% by 2010, 40% by 2020 and 50% by 2025.Proposition 7 Renewable Energy Generation State of California http://www.smartvoter.org/2008/11/04/ca/state/prop/7/ Federally, under the Marine Renewable Energy Research and Development Act of 2007 the United States has committed $200 million in federal funds toward wave energy technology to be allocated from 2008 through 2012. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is currently responsible for the allocation of $50 million per fiscal year for research, development, demonstration and commercial application of ocean energy.Wave Energy Bill Approved by U.S. House Science Committee http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2007/06/wave-energy-bill- approved-by-u-s-house-science-committee-48984.html June 18, 2007 In 2008, the first year of federal allocation toward wave energy, there are a total of fourteen recipients. The most notable recipients of this year include Oregon State University and the University of Hawaii. Oregon State University in partnership with the University of Washington, will implement the development of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center for wave and tidal energy. The second recipient, University of Hawaii will develop and implement the National Renewable Marine Energy Center in Hawaii.DOE announces first marine renewable energy grants http://uaelp.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?Section=ONART&PUBLICATION;_ID=22&ARTICLE;_ID=341078&C;=ENVIR&dcmp;=rss September 30, 2008 The Grays Harbor Ocean Energy Company of Seattle has applied to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for permits to harness energy from waves off the coastline of California, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. The $28 billion project would be the largest renewable energy project in the nation. In 2012, Ocean Power Technologies (O.P.T.), based in Pennington, New Jersey is involved in the following wave projects in the US: * LEAP Autonomous PowerBuoy, New Jersey - O.P.T. has successfully operated an autonomous PowerBuoy¬Æ off New Jersey, designed and manufactured by O.P.T. under the US Navy‚Äôs Littoral Expeditionary Autonomous PowerBuoy (LEAP) program for coastal security and maritime surveillance. * Coos Bay, Oregon - O.P.T. is proposing to develop a utility- scale, commercial wave park in North America at Coos Bay, Oregon. The planned size of this park is up to 100 megawatts, and it will be the largest wave energy project in the world when it is completed * Reedsport, Oregon - O.P.T. is developing a commercial wave park on the west coast of the United States located 2.5 miles offshore near Reedsport, Oregon. The first phase of this project is for ten PB150 PowerBuoys, or 1.5 megawatts. US catching up with Europe - Forbes October 3, 2012 The Reedsport wave farm is now scheduled for installation spring 2013. Reedsport project delayed due to early onset of winter weather - OregonLive Oct 2012 * Oahu, Hawaii - From 2009 to 2011, O.P.T. ocean-tested its PowerBuoy at the US Marine Corps Base Hawaii (MCBH) at Kaneohe Bay. The Oahu PowerBuoy was launched under the Company's program with the US Navy for ocean testing and demonstration of PowerBuoys, including connection to the Oahu grid. * Atlantic City, New Jersey - The prototype project, wherein the principles demonstrated with the PB40 prototype PowerBuoy deployed and tested off the coast of Atlantic City were integrated into the designs of the buoys for Hawaii, Spain, and PB150 PowerBuoys. Spain The Mutriku Breakwater Wave Plant is the world¬¥s first breakwater wave plant with a multiple turbine arrangement. It is located in the Mutriku¬¥s dike and has been producing electrical energy since July 2011. The plant has a capacity of 296 kW from 16 turbines and 16 OWCs.http://www.eve.eus/EVE/media/EVE/pdf/Mutriku-2016.pdf During the winter 2015, the plant supplied its first GWh to the grid. This up-and-running power plant is available as a test site where different researchers can test their WOC based generators. Portugal The Agu√ßadoura Wave Farm was the world's first commercial-scale wave farm. It was located offshore near P√≥voa de Varzim north of Oporto in Portugal. The farm used three Pelamis wave energy converters to convert the motion of the ocean surface waves into electricity, totalling to 2.25MW in total installed capacity. The farm first generated electricity into the Portuguese grid in July 2008 and was officially opened on September 23, 2008, by the Portuguese Minister of Economy. The wave farm was shut down two months after the official opening in November 2008 due to technical problems with the machines. Italy The company 40South Energy has its offshore test site in Castiglioncello, Italy, and plans to upgrade the site to a commercial Wave Energy Park by connecting it with an electrical cable to shore. In the meantime, the owners of an offshore aquaculture installation in Lavagna, Italy, are in the process of converting their concession from fish farming to fish farming plus electricity production. The technology used in this Wave Energy Park will come from 40South Energy. Russia In 2013, Ocean RusEnergy company, based in Yekaterinburg, demonstrated a line of wave energy generators, ranging from 160W to 1MW(planned). Their modular design allows to assemble a wave power farm having a desired capacity. Unlike other wave power projects it targets small-scale and private electricity generation.Russian Company Develops Mobile Wave Energy Generator offshorewind.biz See also *Biofuels *Geothermal power *Hydroelectricity *Marine current power *Ocean thermal energy conversion *Solar power *Tidal power *Wave power *Wind power *List of renewable energy topics by country *List of wave power stations *List of wave power projects References External links *Wave-Powered Generators Deployed off Florida Coast Energy conversion Wave mechanics Power station technology Sustainable technologies ","title":"Wave farm"},{"id":"9715436","text":"1250 Poydras Plaza (also known as the Eni Building and formerly the Mobil Building), is a high-rise international-style office building located at 1250 Poydras Street in the Central Business District of New Orleans, Louisiana.

A family \\\\mathcal{F} of subsets of X is called discrete when every point of X has a neighbourhood that intersects at most one of the sets from \\\\mathcal{F}. An equivalent definition Engelking, Theorem 5.1.17, p. 305, shows the equivalence between the two definitions (under the assumption of T1, but the proof does not use the T1 property). demands that the above Ui (i ‚àà I) are themselves a discrete family, which is stronger than pairwise disjoint. Some authors assume that X is also a T1 space as part of the definition. The property is intermediate in strength between paracompactness and normality, and occurs in metrization theorems.  Properties  *A collectionwise normal space is collectionwise Hausdorff. *A collectionwise normal space is normal. *A Hausdorff paracompact space is collectionwise normal.Engelking, Theorem 5.1.18, p. 305 Note: The Hausdorff condition is necessary here, since for example an infinite set with the cofinite topology is compact, hence paracompact, and T1, but is not even normal. *A metrizable space is collectionwise normal. *Every normal countably compact space (hence every normal compact space) is collectionwise normal. Proof: Use the fact that in a countably compact space any discrete family of nonempty subsets is finite. *An FœÉ-set in a collectionwise normal space is also collectionwise normal in the subspace topology. In particular, this holds for closed subsets. *The ' states that a collectionwise normal Moore space is metrizable.  Hereditarily collectionwise normal space  A topological space X is called hereditarily collectionwise normal if every subspace of X with the subspace topology is collectionwise normal.

Bias accusations Kershner has been accused of pro-Israel bias in her coverage and her hiring to report on Israeli-Palestinian issues has been denounced as conflict of interest since her son has served in the IDF in recent years and her husband, Hirsh Goodman, is an employee at The Institute for National Security Studies, which promotes a better image of Israel, and which Kershner often relies on as a source. Kershner has been a featured speaker in the Israel Hasbara Committee. Her reporting has been denounced by the progressive media watch Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting for allegedly paying disproportionate attention to killings of Israeli soldiers at the expense of Arabs and Iranians, omitting Israeli violations of ceasefires with Hamas, the biggest Gaza militia, and falsely presenting such violations as merely reactions to the actions of Palestinians, and giving free rein for anonymous Israeli sources to defame Palestinian hunger strikes in Israeli prisons as terrorists. Kershner has also been accused of anti-Israel bias in her coverage of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict by the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America, a pro-Israel media outfit with a record of improperly manipulating content on Wikipedia, for downplaying Palestinian terrorism, covering up incitement to violence by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and promoting anti-Israel bias using the journalism technique of \\"first- last reporting\\".

The idea was introduced in (Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson 1974) and is meant to describe pieces of conversation which may comprise an entire turn. The end of a TCU, called a transition relevance place (TRP), marks a point where the turn may go to another speaker, or the present speaker may continue with another TCU.  Turn Construction Unit (TCU)  A Turn Construction Unit (TCU) is a building component of a turn in a conversation. It is a unit of conversation that completes a communicative act. = Types of TCU = There are four types of TCU categorized by the roles they play in the utterance: 1\\\\. Lexical TCU: e.g. \\"Yes\\", \\"There\\" 2\\\\. Phrasal TCU: e.g. \\"In the basket\\", \\"out of here\\" 3\\\\. Clausal TCU: e.g. \\"When I am free\\", \\"If I got the job\\" 4\\\\. Sentential TCU: e.g. \\"I am working on my thesis\\", \\"He has got my car\\" = Criteria for Turn Construction Unit = A general rule to identify a TCU would be to look for a possible completion in an ongoing utterance. There are three criteria to determine what constitutes a TCU: 1\\\\. Intonationally Complete: This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with the hint of a falling tone, signaling the possible ending of the utterance. 2\\\\. Grammatically Complete: This means the utterance is at a possible point of completion with a hint of its syntactic completeness, i.e. it signals the end of a sentence in terms of its grammatical structure. 3\\\\. Pragmatically Complete: This means the utterance is seen to have possibly accomplished its purpose in response to the situation during a conversation. For example, the utterance \\"She is really\\" can be seen as pragmatically complete in response to the exclamation, \\"That girl is really smart!\\", in the sense that it functions as an agreement to the previous comment. Scholars in the field of conversation analysis have debated over the relative significance of the above three criteria as signifiers of the end of an utterance. There are, however, no conclusive answer to the discussion, and one can classify a TCU as such when observing either one (or more) of the above features.  Transition Relevance Place (TRP) Transition Relevance Place (or TRP) is a point of possible completion (or potential end) of an utterance (hence a TCU) where speaker change is a possible next action.

It is encoded identically to the 12 digits of the UPC-A barcode, except that it has 4 (rather than 6) digits in each of the left and right halves. EAN-8 barcodes may be used to encode GTIN-8 (8-digit Global Trade Identification Numbers) which are product identifiers from the GS1 System. A GTIN-8 begins with a 2- or 3-digit GS1 prefix (which is assigned to each national GS1 authority) followed by a 5- or 4-digit item reference element depending on the length of the GS1 prefix), and a checksum digit. EAN-8 codes are common throughout the world, and companies may also use them to encode RCN-8 (8-digit Restricted Circulation Numbers), and use them to identify own-brand products sold only in their stores. RCN-8 are a subset of GTIN-8 which begin with a first digit of 0 or 2.

A speaker of Interlingua and two other auxiliary languages, he wrote two cosmological monographs in Interlingua. Life As a youth, Pigal learned the auxiliary language Ido. In 1921, he joined the preparatory committee for the first Ido congress in Vienna. At the 1926 Ido conference in Cassel, he startled many listeners by delivering a presentation on the naturalistic auxiliary language Occidental. The next year, he and Karl Janotta began to work for Occidental in Austria. Pigal was editor and co-author of Occidental, die Weltsprache (\\"Occidental, the World Language\\"), the principal work on this language. In a later work, Ab Occidental verso Interlingua (\\"From Occidental towards Interlingua\\"), he showed why he considered Interlingua to be the better alternative. Between 1931 and 1938, Pigal served as Scientific Director of the Hoerbiger Institute in Vienna. In this position, he examined Hans Hoerbiger's theory of glacial cosmology. He published two monographs on cosmology in Interlingua, Problematica del cosmologia moderne and Astro-Geologia. In the second work, he endeavored to solve fundamental problems of geology, such as the origins of mountains and oceans, using the exact method of physics and his own theory of planetary interference. Later, Pigal persuaded professor Eugen W√ºster, also of Austria, to use Interlingua in his work to standardize international scientific terminology. This work led to the founding of the powerful International Organization for Standardization (ISO). To his death at the age of 80 (?), Pigal was a member of the Council of the Union Mundial pro Interlingua and was the national Interlingua representative in Austria.

Caterpillars feed on Rumex spp. (mainly on Rumex acetosella, Rumex acetosa, Rumex hydrolapathum, Rumex confertus) and Polygonum bistorta. Caterpillars hibernate after the first molt. They pupate on the ground. Adults fly from June‚ÄìJuly to September. Seitz 76h, i Description from Seitz C. hippothoe L. ( eurydice Rott., chryseis Bkh.) (76 h). Darker coppery golden with bluish sheen, both wings of the male broadly edged with black, inclusive of the costal margin of the forewing and the anal one of the hindwing; the female shaded with very dark. Underside almost uniformly grey, with numerous ocelli, the disc of the forewing being slightly yellowish. In North, Central and South Europe, sporadic, but common in many localities. Appears to be nowadays absent from England. Albinotic specimens have a whitish upperside with a sky-blue instead of violet-blue sheen in the males; this is ab. argenteola Schultz. The ocelli of the underside are sometimes reduced, the central ones (ab. decurtata Schultz) or the marginal ones (ab. orba Schultz), or all, especially often in eurybia (ab. extincta Gillm.). The spots also may be prolonged and united with one another (ab. confluens Gerh.) in every conceivable degree. ‚Äî In the alpine form, eurybia O. (= eurydice Hbn.) (76 h) the female is often entirely dark brown above with the markings hardly perceivable, being on the wing hardly recognizable as a Chrysophanus; only occasionally is the disc of the forewing above yellowish and glossy golden. The male has above a quite different, more red gloss. In the mountains of Switzerland and Scandinavia, also in the Altai and other Asiatic mountains. ‚Äî The form italica Calb., from the central and northern Apennines, is a transition from the typical form towards eurybia. The female is not quite dark brown above, the disc of the forewing having a stronger golden brown gloss. The discocellular spot is visible in the male but small. ‚Äî An exaggerated form of eurybia with the upperside of the female deep dark brown is ab. nigra Favre. ‚Äî amurensis Stgr. (76 i) is a very large form from North China and Amurland ; the female is very dark, bearing only in the anal area of the hindwing a narrow yellowish red half-band; the ocelli of the underside are strongly developed. ‚Äî stieberi Gerh. (76 i) is the smaller form from North Europe with bright golden red ground-colour on the upperside of the female, the underside bearing usually a very distinct yellowish red submarginal band, which in the males is also very prominent on the upperside, whereas it is entirely absent from the males of hippothoe and eurybia. ‚Äî candens H.-Schaff. is the form inhabiting the Balkan Peninsula and Anterior Asia. The males have no blue sheen and the forewing above is entirely golden brown in the females; the black margin of the upperside is narrower in both sexes. ‚Äî Ter Haar describes some specimens obtained by him at Groningen in Holland which he says have the blue sheen peculiarly modified, being condensed in violet-blue streaks and dots; he calls this form from its habitat ab. groningana. ‚Äî Larva velvety dark green with brown head, dark dorsal line and yellow lateral one; until the middle of May on Rumex. Pupa yellowish brown like leather, spotted with black; it lies free on the ground (Fryer). The butterflies appear at the end of May, in the northern districts a little later (early in June) and are found until late in July in luxuriant meadows, where they settle on umbellifers or in the grass, the males always with the wings half open. The localities are often of very small extent, sometimes being only a certain part of a meadow, where the species, however, is nearly always very plentiful. The females appear about 2 ‚Äì 3 weeks after the males have commenced to fly. The form eurybia of the high Alps does not begin to fly before the very end of July and is on the wing into September; the northern stieberi also does not appear before July.Seitz, A. ed.

He was a gold medalist at Punjab University, and he completed his M.A. in Fine Arts from Punjab University. Later, he went to teach at National College of Arts Lahore. His watercolour paintings show the grandeur of the old buildings and the cultural life in Lahore. Life Born in Ludhiana in 1946, his father was a cartoonist who apparently had stirred his passion from childhood and from whom he drew his inspiration. After obtaining his M.A. in Fine Arts and a Gold medal in 1967 from Punjab University (PUCAD) Lahore, he completed his Ph.D. in Muslim architecture, in Turkey in 1978 and proceeded to do a course on conservation of cultural property at UNESCO, Rome, in 1977. From 1972 he has been lecturing until he became professor and director of Art Gallery NCA, Lahore to date. Old buildings The old buildings of Lahore are the main theme of his paintings. He has tried to preserve those buildings in his paintings which are replaced by new style buildings or they are crumbling. These are the buildings of old Lahore; not all are historical, but common homes of common people are the centre of his attention. Natural lively colours bring the buildings to life. People in his paintings Although buildings are the main theme of his paintings and people are just there to make a normal life but the characters he used in his paintings are the quintessential of daily life in Lahore or Punjab. The characters are faceless, but they represent the common people found in the bazaars: A Tonga rider, women walking in the bazaar, children playing, milkman, old people talking, and sellers of all kinds. In his own home Kites Kites are almost always present in his paintings. His main themes are common homes or buildings and on the roof of every building there is a kite lover and on the sky above there are lot of kites colouring the sky. Life in detail With close observation we find a detailed life in his paintings. A woman is peeping from the window or behind the curtain, a cock is searching for food bits in the garbage. Comments on his work \\"In my paintings, I highlight the parts of Lahore that must be preserved. I remove skyscrapers and instead incorporate tongas and sweetmeat shops,\\" he said in an interview. The main focus of his paintings are not human figures. \\"The human figures are only used to bring these crumbling buildings to life.

It was extended to Ireland by the Life Insurance (Ireland) Act 1866, and is still in force. Prior to the Act, it was legally possible for any person to take out life insurance on any other person, regardless of whether or not the beneficiary of the policy had any legitimate interest in the person whose life was insured. As such, the system of life insurance provided a legal loophole for a form of gambling: an insurance policy could be taken out on an unrelated third party, stipulating whether or not they would die before a set date, and relying on chance to determine if the \\"insurer\\" or \\"policy-holder\\" would profit by this event. Provisions The Act was relatively short, with only four sections: *Section 1 sought to deal with these abuses by stipulating that henceforth no assurance was to be made on the life of any person or persons, or on any other event, where the person for whose use the policy was made had \\"no interest\\" in the matter, or if it were clearly done for the intent of \\"gaming or wagering\\", and that any assurance made contrary to this requirement was deemed null and void. *To aid in preventing this, section 2 required that any such policy include the names of the persons who stood to benefit by it. *Section 3 stipulated that, in all cases where the insured party had a legitimate interest in the life or event, they did not recover more than the value of their interest from the policy, guarding against the related abuse of deliberate overinsuring. *For the avoidance of doubt, section 4 stated that the Act did not extend to legitimate insurances of ships, goods or merchandise. Gaming or wagering in relation to British ships and merchandise was already prohibited by the Marine Insurance Act 1745. Sections 2 and 3 were amended by the Statute Law Revision Act 1888, and the requirement in section 2 to name the beneficiaries of a life insurance policy was relaxed by section 50 of the Insurance Companies Amendment Act 1972, to allow insurance by reference to a defined class or description of person. The defendant in the important contract law case of Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company (1898) had attempted unsuccessfully to rely on this section to avoid paying ¬£100 to the plaintiff.Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Company [1893] 1 QB 256 Effects The Act did not define what an \\"insurable interest\\" was, and it has since been held as the definite expectation of suffering a financial loss directly due to someone's death. It is generally accepted that a person has an insurable interest in the life of someone financially supporting them - for example, in the life of their parent whilst they are still a juvenile - but that this interest can cease if the situation changes. In a 1904 case, it was held that a man insuring the life of his elderly mother in order to pay funeral expenses, where he did not otherwise have a financial interest, was void.Harse v. Pearl Life Assurance Co Ltd [1904] 1 KB 558 However, note that as long as an insurable interest existed at the time the policy was created, it remains valid even if the interest later ceases.Insurances , Fraser Brown solicitors. A person is considered to have an unlimited interest in their own lifeGriffiths v. Fleming [1909] 1 KB 805; M'Farlane v. Royal London Friendly Society (1886) 2 TLR 755. or in that of their spouse, a case the law considers broadly equivalent; even if not financially dependent on the other, it is legitimate to insure against their death.Griffiths v. Fleming [1909] 1 KB 805; Married Women's Property Act 1882, section 11. This does not reliably extend to cohabiting couples, however: whilst many insurers will accept such policies, as they have not been tested in court they could potentially be invalidated. In recent years, there have been moves to pass clear statutory provisions in this regard, which have not yet borne fruit.Report on Family Law; Cohabitation, s. XVI , Scottish Law Commission. Similar treatment was recently extended to civil partners under section 253 of the Civil Partnership Act 2004. The Act remains of importance for policies of life insurance, including investments that are packaged under the umbrella of life assurance, such as endowment policies used to pay off mortgages.For example, the investor was only able to recover part of his money as a result of the limit in section 3 of the Act in the case of Fuji Finance Inc v.

His father, also Enoch was born around 1661, and the Seeman family were painters. Career Having been brought to London from his home of Flanders by his father in 1704, the younger Seeman's painting career as we know it began with a group portrait of the Bisset family in the style of the portraitist Godfrey Kneller, now held at Castle Forbes in Grampian, Scotland, and dated by an inscription 1708. As a painter to the British royal court Seeman the Younger completed portraits of George I, in 1730, in the robes of his coronation and of George II some years later. The first of these pictures is held at the Middle Temple in London, England, and the second is at Windsor Castle in Berkshire, England, part of the royal collection. In 1734, Seeman painted a portrait of Jane Pratt Taylor, daughter of Lord Chief Justice John Pratt. The portrait was sent to William Byrd, II of Westover, in Virginia, where it became part of the largest colonial portrait collection of the early eighteenth century. The painting is now part of the collection of the Virginia Historical Society. The Yale University Art Gallery owns a portrait of Elihu Yale in 1717 by Seeman and the Metropolitan Museum in New York, US, owns his rendering of Sir James Dashwood, described by the Grove Dictionary of Art as 'Exceptionally lively'.

The National Trust owns two examples of this set of his work ‚Äì at Dunham Massey in Cheshire, England, a copy of a portrait of Lady Diana Cecil, and at Belton House in Lincolnshire, England, of Lady Cust and her Nine Children. Despite royal commissions, Seeman the younger's work is thought of as less accomplished than that of the top flight of portraitists because of his lesser attention to detail in the facial features of different sitters. This is more apparent in male than in female subjects of Seeman's. Seeman the younger died in 1744.

The bulk of the issue was confiscated by German authorities. Lietuvos aidas (literally: Echo of Lithuania) is a daily newspaper in Lithuania. It was established on September 6, 1917 by Antanas Smetona, and became the semi-official voice of the newly formed Lithuanian government. When the government evacuated from Vilnius to the temporary capital, Kaunas, it ceased publication. The newspaper was revived in 1928 as the newspaper of the Lithuanian government and became the most popular newspaper in Lithuania. At its peak, it published three daily editions with combined circulation of 90,000 copies. World War II disrupted its publication. In 1990, after Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union, the newspaper once again became the official newspaper of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Lithuania. At the end of 1992, its circulation reached 103,000 copies. However, it was soon privatized and faced shrinking readership, financial difficulties, and other controversies. In April 2006, bankruptcy proceedings were initiated by the State Tax Inspectorate when its tax debts reached more than 4 million litas. The company was liquidated in 2015, but the newspaper continues to be published by a non-profit organization (vie≈°oji ƒØstaiga). History =1917‚Äì1918= The newspaper was established on September 6, 1917, when Lithuania was occupied by the German Empire. At the time it was the only Lithuanian-language newspaper in Vilnius (Lietuvos ≈´kininkas was discontinued at the start of the war). The German authorities loosened their control and granted some rights to the local population as World War I drew to a close. An openly pursued goal of annexation gave way to a more guarded policy after Germany perceived that a public relations backlash might occur: the Central Powers realized that the Allies could use this annexation in their propaganda and in the upcoming peace negotiations. During this time, Lithuanians assembled the Vilnius Conference and elected the 20-member Council of Lithuania, which was entrusted with the declaration of Lithuania's independence. When Antanas Smetona, the newspaper's founder, became the chairman of the Council, Lietuvos aidas became the official newspaper of the Council on September 21, 1917. It was important for the Council to inform the Lithuanian people about its struggles and progress and developments on the war front, and to report other political news. Among its goals was the unification of all Lithuanians, irrespective of their political beliefs, in order to declare and establish an independent Lithuania. The newspaper was censored by the Germans and was required to issue German translations. The German issue was titled Litauische Echo. At first the newspaper was published three times a week; after October 1, 1918 it was published daily, except for Mondays. The circulation in 1918 reached some 20,000 copies. The newspaper usually consisted of about four to six pages. It published official declarations, decisions, and similar documents. Among the most famous issues is that of February 19, 1918, when the entire front page was dedicated to the Act of Independence of Lithuania. Although the majority of that issue was confiscated, the newspaper's editor, Petras Klimas, succeeding in hiding about 60 copies. In addition to political news, Lietuvos aidas also published poems and other literary works. It featured a special supplement, Liuosoji valanda (The Free Hour), dedicated to art. Another supplement, M≈´s≈≥ ≈´kis (Our Farm), published articles on farming and agriculture. Antanas Smetona remained as the editor in chief, but the actual editing was performed by Petras Klimas, Liudas Noreika, and others. Its authors included Mykolas Bir≈æi≈°ka, Petras Klimas, Aleksandras Stulginskis, Jurgis ≈†aulys, Antanas ≈Ωmuidzinaviƒçius, Juozas Tumas- Vai≈ægantas, Juozas T≈´belis. As Bolshevik forces took over Vilnius, the government had to abandon the city and the newspaper discontinued its operations on December 31, 1918, after publishing 214 issues. After the interim government was established in Kaunas, Lietuvos aidas was replaced by Lietuva (Lithuania) as the official newspaper of the Lithuanian government. =1928‚Äì1940= Lietuvos aidas was revived on February 1, 1928. It replaced Lietuva, the newspaper of the Lithuanian government, and Lietuvis, the newspaper of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union. After October 29, 1935, the paper published two editions daily (at 6 a.m. and at 1 p.m.), and from May 9, 1939 until the end of that year it published three daily editions (called Rytinis Lietuvos aidas, Lietuvos aidas, and Vakarinis Lietuvos aidas). These three editions were not merely re-prints or updates, but consisted of completely new material. The issues consisted of 14 to 16 pages. In 1939, the newspaper was the largest newspaper in Lithuania and its daily circulation reached 90,000 copies. The last issue, number 5546, was published on July 16, 1940, a month after the Soviet Union occupied Lithuania. Lietuvos aidas was replaced by the communists Darbo Lietuva (Working Lithuania). The chief editors were appointed by President Antanas Smetona and his Prime Minister. During this time, chief editors of Lietuvos aidas were (1928‚Äì1932), (1933‚Äì1934), Vytautas Alantas (1934‚Äì1939), (1939), (1939), (1939‚Äì1940). =Since 1990= Lietuvos aidas was again resurrected in 1990 when Lithuania declared independence from the Soviet Union. The first new issue came out on May 8, 1990, during the economic blockade of Lithuania. Receiving support from Vytautas Landsbergis, it was recreated as the newspaper of the Supreme Council and the Council of Ministers of Lithuanian. It had 62,000 subscribers in 1991 and 56,000 subscribers in 1992. At the end of 1992, its circulation reached 103,000 copies. The newspaper reflected ideology of the Homeland Union. There were unrealized plans of merging Lietuvos aidas with the Russian-language Echo Litvy (previously Sovetskaya Litva). Few years later, Lietuvos aidas was privatized. The first editor was Saulius Stoma (until 1994). In October 1997, he received a five-year sentence for misappropriation of funds at Lietuvos aidas and served a seven-month sentence. Other editors included Saulius ≈†altenis (1994‚Äì1996), Roma Grinbergienƒó (1997‚Äì1998), Jonas Vailionis (1998), and Rimantas Varnauskas (1998‚Äì2000). By the end of 1999, the newspaper had accumulated more than 5 million litas of debt and its daily circulation decreased to 7,000 copies. In May 2000, controversial businessman acquired the controlling share of the newspaper and became its editor. The newspaper caused a public scandal when some 50 openly anti-Semitic articles were published in fall 2000. Lietuvos aidas faced no real sanctions, but did soften its rhetoric. The scandal and other controversies alienated much of the readership: by September 2002, the circulation decreased to less than 5,000 copies and 2003 saw a 29.2% drop in subscriptions. In December 2006, a new newspaper, with the same name and design, appeared as the original newspaper had failed to register its name. The new paper, published by an unknown company Adenita, employed several former employees of the original Lietuvos aidas. Pilvelis sued and obtained an injunction and the publication of the second Lietuvos aidas ceased in May 2007. In April 2006, bankruptcy proceedings were initiated by the State Tax Inspectorate when its tax debts reached more than 4 million litas. After the prolonged litigation, its main asset ‚Äì former headquarters in Vilnius Old Town ‚Äì was sold and the company was liquidated in 2015. However, Pilvelis continued to publish Lietuvos aidas through a non-profit organization (vie≈°oji ƒØstaiga). The number of issues decreased to twice a week (Wednesday and Saturday). In 2013, 15 min reported that Lietuvos aidas employed only three people (Pilvelis and two others) and an advertising agency listed its circulation at 1,000 copies. Pilvelis died on August 27, 2016, and the publication was taken over by his daughter Rasa Pilvelytƒó-ƒåeme≈°kienƒó. In 2019, it was a 16-page weekly with circulation of about 3,500 copies.

Laser transmitters are typically used instead of bullets, larger rounds, or shorter-range guided weapons such as anti-tank missiles. A laser transmitter is mounted on the weapon and aligned with the weapon's barrel. However, some engagement simulators are capable of also utilizing live firing in order to increase the fidelity of the training simulation. Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is often used as the stimulated medium and this produces a wavelength of 904 nanometres, in the near infrared band outside the sensitivity of the human eye which is from about 400 to 700 nm (0.4 to 0.7 micrometres). In modern TES systems the laser transmission is coded so that in a field exercise, individual weapons can be identified by exercise control (EXCON) and appropriate calculations made of gravity drop, warhead damage radius and so forth. Weapons as small as hand guns can be part of a TES system as can larger weapons including tanks and large calibre guns. In field exercises, the laser transmitters can trigger cartridge-based Weapon effects simulation (WES) devices mounted on potential targets such as tanks and other vehicles. WES systems include pyrotechnic flash/bang and smoke devices that add realism to a field exercise. All these events are recorded on the exercise computer. After- Action Review (AAR) can include comprehensive analysis of weapon firing, accuracy and warhead effects on the targets. Such techniques have taken much speculation out of the assessment of field exercises and have resulted in more realistic training than used to be available other than by using (dangerous) live firing.

Aldin follows a thief inside, and as the thieves are asleep, he begins stealing the treasure. Madia, a young female thief, awakens and threatens to kill Aldin, who convinces her to see the world with him. The two fly away on a magic wooden horse. While they are crossing the ocean, living hair pulls them down. They then find themselves on the Lotus Island, which is home to beautiful Sirens. Their queen invites them to stay, but Madia becomes jealous and does not trust them. She leaves on the magic horse while Aldin stays and has sex with the sirens. The queen forbids Aldin from following her into her house in the woods at night, but he still does so, and he is shocked when the queen and the sirens transform into snakes. The snakes chase him, but Aldin flees from the island and is rescued by sailors. He travels with the sailors to a mysterious island, which is inhabited by a man-eating giant who eats most of the crew while Aldin survives. Aldin then finds a magical, sentient ship that will take him anywhere and fulfill almost any of his wishes. 15 years later, two genies on a carpet come across a shepherd named Aslan, which the female genie falls for. The male genie, in hopes of keeping the other genie from risking death by being seen by the shepherd, brings a beautiful princess named Jalis, who is comes from Baghdad, but teleports her away when things start going wrong. The male genie, in a huff, leaves the female genie, as she transforms into a horse when Aslan hopes to go to Baghdad. When Aslan and Princess Jalis cross paths in the desert, leaves the genie disappears from sight. Meanwhile, Aldin, now became a rich man, enters a competition in Baghdad, the winner of which will become king. He wins the competition by tricking his opponent onto his magical ship, and by commanding the ship to take him to the end of the world. Aldin tries to use his power as the king to make Princess Jalis ‚Äì who is Miriam's daughter ‚Äì marry him, but she is in love with Aslan. Aldin commands the people to build a tower to heaven. The people hate him and revolt, led by Aldin's second-in-command. Not prepared for the pressures of kingship, Aldin gives up the throne to travel the world as a poor man again, now seeing the value of freedom and peace.

The forest covers about , of which is in Poland. The Polish part of the forest is located in Podlaskie Voivodeship in northeastern part of the country. The northern part of the August√≥w Primeval Forest has been turned into one of the youngest Polish national parks. It was established in 1989, as the Wigry National Park. History The former names of the place are Grodno Forest, Perstunskaya Forest. The forest once occupied the territory from Grodno in the southeast to the Baltic Sea in the north. In the past, the August√≥w Primeval Forest was part of vast, virgin forests growing between Lithuania, Mazovia and Ruthenia. Until the thirteenth century, its area was inhabited by the Yotvingians. After their extermination or displacement, the re-settlement of the forest began only in the 15th century. Then the forests were divided into the so-called primeval forests, that is forestry: Perstu≈Ñska, Prze≈Çomska, Ber≈ºnicka and others. In the mid-sixteenth century, they were part of the royal property and were the hunting grounds for various animals: aurochs, bison, elk, deer, wild boar, bears and wolves. The forest was owned by the Grand Duke. He could endow the boyar with a piece of forest, allowing him to create settlements there, to engage in agriculture. It was then that the forest began to be exploited: trees were cut and then floated down the rivers to the Baltic ports; They produced tar, potash, tar and charcoal, smelt iron from bog iron ore, collected honey from beehives. At that time, Osock villages were established on the southern edge of the forest - the so-called osocznicy, or guardians of the royal forest. Mostly, they were peasants, released from serfdom, whose function was transferred from father to son - this is how, among others, the villages of Staro≈ºy≈Ñce (Staro≈ºy≈Ñce family), Markowce (Markowicz), Skieblewo and Kurianka (Kurianowicz). Over time, they were gradually transformed into ordinary serfs, with the exception of the Forest Heroes, in which Bohatyrowiczs from the minor nobility were imprisoned, serving until the partitions. The emigrants from the village of ≈ªabickie, who were responsible for transporting the correspondence of the forest management, performed their duties for a similar time. Permanent settlements of beekeepers, scythes, fishermen and osacznik√≥w, dating back to the 15th century, were the oldest settlements at the beginning of colonization of the area of today's August√≥w Primeval Forest.erzy Wi≈õniewski: Dzieje osadnictwa w powiecie augustowskim od XV do ko≈Ñca XVIII wieku.

Bartenders had the right to use only honey trees, which led to disputes with forest officials and owners and made management difficult. Private forests and honey hunting meadows survived until the 19th century, when they began to be bought. However, the bee-keeping began to decline in earlier centuries as the forest was populated. One of the privileges of honey hunters was the right to bring axes and other tools to the forest, a privilege which was deprived of other groups of the population.Grzegorz RƒÖkowski: Polska Egzotyczna. Czƒô≈õƒá I. Przewodnik. Pruszk√≥w: Oficyna wydawnicza ‚ÄûRewasz‚Äù, 2005. p. 55-57 During the January Uprising, the backwoods were a refuge for combatants and a place of skirmishes. In the Kozi Rynek reserve, there are the graves of insurgents who died in battle with the majority of Imperial Russian Army on June 29, 1863. In the Powsta≈Ñce forest wilderness (north of August√≥w), in April 1863, an insurgent forge operated (now there is a monument). During World War I, the forest was badly damaged due to the destruction of trees by the Germans (about 15% of the forests were cut down). During World War II, the forest again served as a shelter for partisans. It was also a place of execution of the population as in the vicinity of the village of Szczebra in the years 1941-1944 about 8,000 people, mainly Jews, were murdered. In the direction of the forest was the Slavic colonization of land. Already at the beginning of the XVI century, Ruthenian settlements appeared in the vicinity of the forest, located in the area of the Prussian border. However, the Ruthenian enclaves did not exist there for long and disappeared after the devastating wars of the 17th ‚Äì 18th centuries. As the Grodno Forest was cut down and removed from Grodno, the forest became known as the Perstunsky Forest. The name is associated with the area of Crank, which was the administrative center of the local grand duchy. During 1863. uprising many rebels were stationed in this forest. In the Kozi Rinek Reserve there is a rebel cemetery killed in the fight against the armies of the Russian Empire on June 29, 1863. At present, north of Augustow is a monument to these fighters. During the First World War, the forest was severely affected by large-scale felling (about 15% of the forest). According to the 1920, July 12 The peace agreement between Lithuania and Soviet Russia was assigned to the Republic of Lithuania. During World War II, partisans hid in the forest. Also in 1941-1944. the forest was used for executions, during which time about 8,000 people, mostly Jews, were killed in this forest.

History An educational trust was established in the will of Agnes Morley who died in 1512; Lewes Old Grammar School has some historical links to that trust and thus might arguably be described as 'the 38th oldest school in England.' The school itself was proprietorial until 1989 when a new educational trust was formed, of which there were eight active trustees. The current school has existed as an organisation since 25 April 2015, when the company limited by guarantee that now operates the school was formed. As at 16 November 2018, ten directors of the company were listed at Companies House. In November 2017, the school was the subject of an emergency no-notice inspection by the Independent Schools Inspectorate in relation to regulatory failings or concerns raised as to the safeguarding of children. A school has been at the current school's site at the top of the Lewes High Street since the 19th century. Morley House, the junior school, which includes the Early Years and Foundation Stage (EYFS), is situated in a residential suburb, in a house which has been updated and extended. The senior school occupies three listed houses in the High Street of Lewes which have been refurbished and extended. Curriculum The Junior School, for ages 4‚Äì11, is housed in its own building, Morley House in King Henry's Road. The Senior School is situated in the centre of Lewes, occupying three former townhouses, Mead House, Tyne House and St. Clair House, all of which are grade II listed buildings. The curriculum followed includes three foreign languages (French, Spanish and German), and sciences are studied as individual subjects at senior level. Expansions to the sixth form college have allowed for the study of psychology, theatre and graphic design. They also allow the study of business, politics and Latin. Extra-curricular activities The sixth form produces theatrical events featuring the orchestra, choir and actors from the school. The most notable of these is the annual VIth form pantomime, performed on the last day of the autumn term. The last assembly of each academic year is primarily held and organised by the leaving upper VIth form. School trips include the annual ski trip, a week spent at a sports training camp in Lanzarote, and every two years some members of the VIth form venture to Morocco for 10‚Äì11 days, visiting Marrakech, Zagora, and travelling into the High Atlas mountains to visit a school with which LOGS has been in contact with regularly. LOGS and the school have carried out exchanges, LOGS having several fundraising events in order to pay for travel from Morocco to the UK. Every year the senior school carries out a sponsored charity walk, usually from the senior school in Lewes across some of the South Downs to Stanmer Park and back. One of the most popular charities is Fish Aid‚Äîa charity set up in memory of a former student of LOGS who died of cancer. There are three houses in the school‚ÄîDeMontfort house, Barbican house, and Malling house. The houses compete in events throughout the year. Each house performs a Christmas pantomime before the VIth form pantomime on the last day of the Autumn Term.

Specimens collected under the junior synonyms I. biserialis and I. macrocheir were described from Mozambique. Since the further collecting effort off Mozambique has seen additional specimens gained.

Recent specimens were collected using handnetts over beds of the seagrasses Zostera and Cymodocea. The dwarf squids in the Idiosepiidae possess a glue gland on the dorsal surface of the body which they can use to adhere vegetation and other submerged objects. These small squid are typically predators of crustaceans, the females stick their eggs onto seaweed or seagrass blades and their llife cycle is thought to include a pelagic planktonic stage.

The office tower of One Canal Place is located in the Central Business District of New Orleans, and is the ninth tallest building in the city. History The International House, chartered in 1943, and the International Trade Mart, chartered in 1945, were the two predecessor organizations of the World Trade Center of New Orleans. Plans for a monumental structure to house both organizations were drafted. Several plots of land were purchased at 2 Canal Street where the new ITM building was constructed. The formal dedication ceremony of the ITM building took place on April 30, 1968, as part of a celebration of the 250th anniversary of the founding of New Orleans. Ambassadors from around the world visited the city. Parades and banquets were held, and the Organization of American States brought its first meeting outside of Washington, D.C., to New Orleans. The concept of the International Trade Mart launched the formation of a worldwide league of trade centers, which led to the founding of the World Trade Centers Association. In 1968 Dr. Paul Fabry, a founding member of the NO Int'l House, along with Guy Tozzoli and Eisaku Yamada formulated the plans for the World Trade Centers Association. All three were founding directors of the WTCA which was officially Incorporated in 1969. In 1985, the old New Orleans house of trade from where the WTCA had emerged, officially became a part of the WTC family.

History Henri Faberg√© and the Adorables formed in 2005 and is a musical collective including members of The Bicycles, Born Ruffians, Spitfires & Mayflowers, Woodhands, The Rural Alberta Advantage and The Meligrove Band, the Adorables most commonly consist of Henri Faberg√© (Henry Fletcher), Juliann Wilding, Janderton Beauregard (Andy Lloyd), Maylee Todd, Dana Snell, Laura Barrett, Dan Werb, and Johnny Ortved. Past and occasional members include Niall Fynes, Keith Hamilton, Tom MacCammon, Luke LaLonde, Mitch DeRosier, Steve Hamelin, Andrew Scott, Brendan Howlett, Ruhee Dewji, Kelly Sue O'Connor (Mal de Mer)(Proof of Ghosts), Peter Thorne, Sara Jane McKenzie, Matt Beckett, Drew Smith, Randy Lee and Paul Banwatt. The band released its self-titled debut album in 2006. The album was recorded by Ryan Mills at Sleepytown Sound, in Henri's living room and at The Embassy bar in Kensington Market. From 2005 until 2008, the Adorables held a residency at The Embassy in Kensington Market occurring the first Wednesday of every month. These shows became local folklore and were one of the best parties in Toronto at the time. Many Canadian bands played early shows at these events, namely: Born Ruffians, Woodhands (their 2nd show with Paul Banwatt), Maylee Todd, The Rural Alberta Advantage, and DD/MM/YYYY.

The R3-30 traditionally announces each week's biggest chart dropper with a descending slide whistle tone.

The range is a northeastern extension of the Andes, and is also known as the Maritime Andes. It covers around 48,866 km2, being the 4th largest natural region in Venezuela. Geography Coastal Range of Venezuelan Andes from biological station Rancho Grande The Coastal Range actually consists of two parallel ranges, which run east and west along the coast of the Caribbean Sea. The Cojedes River separates the western end of Coastal Range from the Cordillera de M√©rida to the southeast. The range is divided into eastern and western sections by the wide bay between Cape Codera and Cuman√°. =Serran√≠a del Litoral‚ÄîSerran√≠a del Interior= In eastern section of the range, the parallel ranges are known as the Serran√≠a del Litoral, which runs along the Caribbean coast, and the Serran√≠a del Interior to the south. The valley between these two ranges, which includes Lake Valencia, the valleys of metropolitan Caracas, and the Tuy River at its eastern end, is the most densely populated region of Venezuela. The Capital District lies in a valley between two branches of the Serran√≠a del Litoral: with Cerro El √Åvila (peak) and El √Åvila National Park in the Cordillera de la Costa Central to the north, and smaller hills to the south. Both the Littoral and Interior ranges reappear between Cuman√° and the Gulf of Paria to form the eastern section of the Venezuelan Coastal Range. The Littoral range forms the Araya Peninsula to the west and the Paria Peninsula to the east, and extends across the straits known as the Dragon's Mouths to form the Northern Range of the island of Trinidad. Ecoregions The lower elevations of the mountains are mostly covered by the La Costa xeric shrublands ecoregion of the Deserts and xeric shrublands Biome. The Araya and Paria xeric scrub occupies the arid zones of Araya and Paria peninsulas, with the exception of the montane areas of the Paria Peninsula, which are included in the La Costa xeric shrublands ecoregion.

The palaearctic ecoregion is part of the Taiga and boreal forests biome. Etymology The Polish and German names of the forest, like the Rominta/Rominte river and the settlement of Rominty/Rominten, are derived from the Lithuanian syllable rom, meaning calm, as the forest is in the land called Lithuania Minor. The Russian name, Krasny Les, means \\"Red Forest\\". Geography The total area of the Romincka landscape is about , stretching from the Masurian Lake District in the southwest up to the border with Lithuania at Lake Vi≈°tytis in the east. The southern Polish part (about one- third of the area) comprises a protected zone known as Puszcza Romincka Landscape Park. The Krasnaya River flows through the Romincka Forest. Major settlements in the area include Krasnolesye in Kaliningrad Oblast, as well as ≈ªytkiejmy and Go≈Çdap in Poland. History Rominten hunting lodge, 1914 postcard Part of the East Prussian historic region, the extended forests were known for its red deer populations and became a popular hunting ground of the Hohenzollern princes ruling the Duchy of Prussia since 1525. Part of the German Empire from 1871 onwards, a vast premise in Rominter Heide was purchased by Emperor Wilhelm II, who had his Rominten Hunting Lodge erected here in 1891, including a chapel dedicated to Saint Hubertus. Hunt scenes were perpetuated by notable painters such as Richard Friese (1854‚Äì1918). Plundered by Russian forces in World War I, the hunting lodge and grounds upon Wilhelm's resignation in 1918 were administrated by the Free State of Prussia; Minister- President Otto Braun was a regular guest. Later on, the estates were seized by Nazi minister Hermann G√∂ring, whose Reichsj√§gerhof Rominten was built nearby in 1936. It also served as G√∂ring's headquarters during the German Operation Barbarossa in 1941. The Allied Potsdam Agreement after World War II divided the region between the re-established Polish Republic and the Soviet Union. The German history of the region is documented at the East Prussian Regional Museum in L√ºneburg and at the German Hunting and Fishing Museum in Munich.

The National Party was an early-20th-century national political organization in the United States founded by pro-war defectors from the Socialist Party of America in 1917. These adherents of the SPA Right first formed a non-partisan national society to propagandize the socialist idea called the Social Democratic League of America. Many of these individuals were eager for the formation of an alternative political organization to both the so-called \\"old\\" parties and the anti-war Socialist Party of America and eagerly latched on to a burgeoning movement for a new party that sprouted in 1917.  Organizational history  =Origins= The National Party seems to have begun as a byproduct of personal coalitions around single-issue advocacy, such as the drive for constitutional amendments for woman suffrage and prohibition. Coming together to lobby Congress and the Wilson Administration on behalf of these measures, activists came to realize their common vision in practical terms, despite whatever philosophical differences they might have harbored in the theoretical plain. Thus veterans of the Progressive Party believing in the \\"spirit of 1912,\\" Prohibitionists, suffragists, Single-Taxers, and Socialists began to talk amongst themselves about the possibility of uniting their forces in a new political organization to advance their common cause.Tim Davenport, \\"The National Party (1917 - 1919?),\\" Early American Marxism Archive, Marxisthistory.org Retrieved February 25, 2007. Informal conferences were held in New York and elsewhere in the country during the first half of 1917 between these individuals, culminating in a more formal gathering held July 6‚Äì8 at the home of Progressive Party leader J. A. H. Hopkins in Morristown, New Jersey.Kenneth E. Hendrickson, Jr., \\"The Pro-War Socialists, the Social Democratic League, and the Ill-Fated Drive for Industrial Democracy in America, 1917-1920,\\" Labor History, vol. 11, no. 3 (Summer 1970), pg. 311. Those participating included bolting pro-war socialists organizing themselves as the Social Democratic League of America, adherents of the Nonpartisan League, the Prohibition Party, and the Single Tax movement. The group did discuss and decide upon the outlines of a program for the forthcoming organization. The New Jersey conference was unable to agree amongst themselves to a name for the organization, so the matter was deferred to a future organizational conference, which ultimately decided upon the name \\"The National Party\\" for the new organization. Basic dues in the National Party were $2 per year. The organization also sought additional \\"pledges\\" on the part of its members. The National Party was funded by annual dues payments by its members, based according to the means of the party member, but of not less than $2 per annum. One dollar of this amount was to be retained by the national organization to fund its operation, while the other dollar was to rebated to the state organization for its own support. Party members were to receive membership cards and a periodic bulletin was planned. Those not wishing to cast their lot with the organization as full members could gain \\"sympathizer\\" status through the purchase of an annual button for fifty cents. The National Party's national office was located in the Lafayette Building, 138 N. LaSalle Street, Chicago, Illinois. It also had an office for its \\"Eastern Division\\" located at 15 E 40th Street, New York City. = Founding Conference, Chicago, Illinois October 3‚Äì4, 1917 = The founding conference of the National Party adopted a tentative platform declaring for universal and equal suffrage; for strong advocacy of the rights of Initiative, Referendum, and Recall; for the absentee ballot as a means of enfranchising and deradicalizing transient labor; for prohibition of the sale and use of alcoholic beverages; for prison reform; for a system of proportional representation allowing minor parties representation according to voting strength; and for government ownership of transportation, communications, and other natural monopolies. The conference adopted a declaration in support of American participation in the ongoing World War which declared: > \\"Fundamentally the war is struggle between the ideals and aspirations of > democracy on the one hand, and the ideals and aspirations of autocracy on > the other hand. Imperfect though our democracy may be, nevertheless it is > one of the most advanced in the world. > > \\"We rejoice in the assurance that in the words of President Wilson we have > entered this war for no selfish objects of our own ... > > \\"We entered the war to resist international aggression and lawlessness, to > establish a permanent basis for international peace, and to aid the movement > toward democracy in all lands.

Chicago: The National Party, 1917; pp. 11‚Äì12.

This had been a comparatively moderate document dominated by the party's right wing, placing emphasis upon immediate ameliorative demands rather than long-term universal objectives. The fledgling organization was immediately struck by personal animosity and factional squabbling. Social Democrat John Spargo became involved in an argument with Mrs. Henry Gould, who had previously pledged $5,000 in seed money to the new organization.Hendrickson, \\"The Pro-War Socialists, the Social Democratic League, and the Ill-Fated Drive for Industrial Democracy in America, 1917-1920,\\" pg. 315. She bolted the gathering, never writing the group its promised check. The Social Democrats also clashed with Hopkins and his Progressive Party associates, with the two groups at loggerheads over their mutual desire to dominate the new organization. = First Convention, Chicago, March 6‚Äì8, 1918 = The Second Convention of the National Party adopted a formal organizational constitution and revised platform for the organization.

Quinn (November 1860 - November 7, 1938) was one of the first American singers to become popular in the new medium of recorded music. Quinn was a very successful recording artist whose career spanned from 1892 to 1918. Quinn recorded many of his hits in the legendary Tin Pan Alley of New York City. Biography Dan W. Quinn was born in 1860 in New York City.Martin, Richard (2015), notes to CD \\"Dan W. Quinn Anthology,\\" Archeophone ARCH 5505 His family moved to San Francisco[citation needed] when he was a child, but returned to New York in the 1870s (leading to later confusion as to his birthplace). He began singing in the choir of the Church of the Heavenly Rest (Episcopal) as a child. As a young adult, he worked as an ironworker and moonlighted as a singer at local functions in the New York area. \\"Discovered\\" at one of these functions in January 1892, Quinn made his first recording in New York and quickly achieved success. Limitations of technology at the time meant that not all voices were suitable to be recorded; Quinn's voice was one that recorded well. He assisted Thomas Edison in the laboratory as Edison made modifications to the talking machine, to make it also a singing machine. Edison described him as \\"the man with the perfect voice.\\"The New York Sun obituary, November 7, 1938 He sang for all the major record labels of his day, including Berliner, Columbia, Edison, Gramophone, Paramount and Victor. In 1898, Columbia signed him to a year-long exclusive contract, but within days of its expiration he was making a record for Berliner. Over his career, Quinn recorded many popular songs and cut an estimated 2,500 titles. He sang \\"Molly and I and the Baby\\" more than a thousand times in about two weeks, using the pre-electricity trumpet technology of the early 1890s: the singer sang into the large end of a megaphone, which physically stimulated the stylus on the rotating cylinder. The companies had limited duplication capability, so if they wanted a hundred copies, the singer had to perform the song many times. For one take, Edison obtained an orchestra to accompany Quinn and kept that copy in his laboratory.July 1977 letter from Quinn's older daughter Lidie Q. Hunsberger to Robert Ziegler, a son of a cousin. At age 22 Quinn married 15-year-old Mary Jane Ritchie, known to the family as Jennie. They had six children: Dan Jr, Ritchie, Arthur (who died in infancy), Mary, known as Lidie (later Hunsberger), Jane (Manderson), and Frank. They lived in a reconstructed mansion on West 20th Street, near 10th Avenue, until about 1898, when they moved to 442 West 24th Street, in a row of two-story houses known as Chelsea cottages. Later, in response to Jennie's inability to use stairs due to worsening rheumatism, they moved to a flat at 312 West 20th Street. Quinn retired from recording in 1906 but continued to work in vaudeville, clubs, concerts, and occasionally comic opera. He briefly returned to recording from 1915 to 1918, but went back into retirement soon after. Although retired from singing, he worked extensively booking concerts and shows, including two large ones held the week he died.

'De la R√©alit√©' was reaction against abstract art, seen at the Salon de Mai of 1960 where he exhibited paintings that were almost photographically realistic, in particular Shower Curtain and Electoral Panel, with which he caused a stirReacting against abstract art. He was also president of the Association for the Protection of the Cit√© Fleurie (the \\"Flowering City\\"), a wooded area around the boulevard Arago in Paris's 13th arrondissement where about thirty artist‚Äôs studios are located.

Some of Cadiou's most famous works are 'Le m√©got, 1971' and 'Handel with Care, 1996' Because of renewed interest in precursors to contemporary hyperrealism, the group of painters associated with the ‚Äúpeintres de la r√©alit√©‚Äù are seeing a contemporary resurgence and have been exhibiting now for about fifty years in the Salons as well as in personal or collective shows as well as in Europe, Asia, North America (New York Cultural Center, Corcoran Gallery of Washington), Canada, Brazil, etc.  Chronology  * 1906 March 26.

The supraclavicular lymph nodes on the left side are called Virchow's nodes.page 400 in: Structure A Virchow's node is a left-sided supraclavicular lymph node. Clinical significance An enlarged Virchow's node as seen on CT Malignancies of the internal organs can reach an advanced stage before giving symptoms. Stomach cancer, for example, can remain asymptomatic while metastasizing. One of the first visible spots where these tumors metastasize is one of the left supraclavicular lymph node. Virchow's nodes take their supply from lymph vessels in the abdominal cavity, and are therefore sentinel lymph nodes of cancer in the abdomen, particularly gastric cancer, ovarian cancer, testicular cancer and kidney cancer, that has spread through the lymph vessels, and Hodgkin's lymphoma. Such spread typically results in Troisier's sign, which is the finding of an enlarged, hard Virchow's node. The left supraclavicular nodes are the classical Virchow's node because they receive lymphatic drainage of most of the body (from the thoracic duct) and enters the venous circulation via the left subclavian vein. The metastasis may block the thoracic duct leading to regurgitation into the surrounding Virchow's nodes. Another concept is that one of the supraclavicular nodes corresponds to the end node along the thoracic duct and hence the enlargement. Differential diagnosis of an enlarged Virchow's node includes lymphoma, various intra-abdominal malignancies, breast cancer, and infection (e.g. of the arm). Similarly, an enlarged right supraclavicular lymph node tends to drain thoracic malignancies such as lung and esophageal cancer, as well as Hodgkin's lymphoma. History Virchow's nodes are named after Rudolf Virchow (1821‚Äì1902), the German pathologist who first described the nodes and their association with gastric cancer in 1848. The French pathologist Charles Emile Troisier noted in 1889 that other abdominal cancers, too, could spread to the nodes.

Background  The first ATM in India was set up in 1987 by HSBC in Mumbai.http://www.timescrest.com/opinion/taking- stock-3681 In the following twelve years, about 1500 ATMs were set up in India. In 1997, the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) set up Swadhan, the first network of shared ATMs in India. It was managed by India Switch Company (ISC) for five years, and allowed cardholders to withdraw cash from any ATM in the network, for a fee if they did not have an account with the bank that owned the ATM. In 2002, the network connected over 1000 ATMs of the 53 member banks of the association. The network was capable of handling 250,000 transactions per day, but only 5000 transactions, worth about 100,000, took place each day. In contrast, ICICI Bank's network of about 640 ATMs handled transactions worth about 20,000,000 each day. After the contract with ISC expired, IBA failed to find a bidder to manage the operationally uneconomical network, and shut it down on 31 December 2003. After the collapse of Swadhan, Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Indian Bank, United Bank of India and Syndicate Bank formed an ATM-sharing network called CashTree. Citibank, the Industrial Development Bank of India, Standard Chartered Bank and Axis Bank formed a similar network called Cashnet. Punjab National Bank and Canara Bank also created such networks. In August 2003, the IDRBT announced that it would be creating the National Financial Switch (NFS) to link together the country's ATMs in a single network. The IDRBT collaborated with Euronet Worldwide and Opus Software to build a platform to allow banks to connect their own switches to the NFS. The NFS consisted of an inter-ATM switch and a e-commerce payment gateway.  History  The National Financial Switch was launched by the IDRBT on 27 August 2004, connecting the ATMs of three banks, Corporation Bank, Bank of Baroda and ICICI Bank. The IDRBT then worked towards bringing all major banks in India on board and by December 2009, the network had grown to connect 49,880 ATMs of 37 banks, thereby emerging as the largest network of shared ATMs in the country. IDRBT decided to hive off its operational role on ATM switching to refocus on research and development, and was sought to shift the business to a national-level payment system organization. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) started discussions with IDRBT on the feasibility of taking over. The Board for Regulation and Supervision of Payment and Settlement Systems (BPSS) at its meeting held on 24 September 2009 approved in-principle to issue authorisation to NPCI for operating various retail payment systems in the country. The Reserve Bank of India granted authorisation to NPCI to take over the operations of National Financial Switch (NFS) from the Institute of Development and Research in Banking Technology (IDRBT) on a ‚Äòas is where is basis‚Äô on 15 October 2009. NPCI deputed its officials to IDRBT Hyderabad, and the Institute handed over the National Financial Switch to the NPCI on 14 December 2009. Any bank that provides core banking services with 24x7 transaction banking capabilities with or without ATMs may join the National Financial Switch through a sponsor bank. This allows non-scheduled Urban Co-operative Banks (UCBs) and Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) to gain access to the national network of over 103,000 ATMs in the country. Before 14 August 2011, access was limited to scheduled banks with RTGS membership. The sponsorship scheme was started to increase the connectivity of ATMs across the country, and to enable customers to use ATMs across India. The primary headquarters is located at Mumbai.  Member banks  As of April 2017, the NFS Network connects total of 2,36,199 ATMs in India. Among them 2,16,952 ATMs of 99 Direct Member banks, 4,058 ATMs of 692 Sub Member banks, 1,034 ATMs of 56 RRB Member banks and 14,146 ATMs of 8 White Label ATM providers, which is the largest number of ATMs under a single network in India.  Services offered in NFS  NFS which is the largest domestic ATM network in the country member banks has been in the fore front in providing inter bank ATM services to maximum customers. Initially, the following basic transactions were available in the NFS network * Cash Withdrawal * Balance Enquiry * PIN Change * Mini Statement To enable the member banks of NFS to offer greater utility to their customers, NPCI has introduced the below mentioned functionalities as value added services to enable customers to use these services at any participating bank ATMs. Card to Card Fund transfer (ATM/Debit Card to ATM/Debit Card) : Using this service, a Card holder of a participating NFS Member Bank will be able to remit funds to another Card holder of a participating NFS Member Bank. The funds will be transferred basis the Beneficiary's ‚ÄòCard Number‚Äô which the remitter will be required to input at the time of the transaction. The main features of the service are mentioned below: * Inter Operable * Instant Fund Transfer * 24/7 Availability * Paper Less * Secure * Better Fund Management * Transaction Limits - The transaction limits are in accordance with the RBI's circular on ‚ÄòDomestic Money Transfer‚Äô. Accordingly, for cases where the Issuing and Beneficiary Cards are ‚ÄòDebit/ATM Cards‚Äô, the per transaction limit will be Rs.5000 and the monthly limit will be Rs.25,000 per remitter. Cheque Book Request/Statement Request: At present, although statement & cheque book request options are available at ATMs, these are available only for customers of that particular bank. NFS aims to make this option inter operable wherein customers will be able to avail the aforementioned services at NFS member bank ATMs who avail this particular service from NPCI.

History The Montgomery Building was built as the American El Paso, as opposed to a Mexican El Paso, underwent a great transformation from a dusty adobe village to a thriving city following the arrival of the railroad on May 13, 1881. The Southern Pacific Railroad had just arrived in El Paso and two other railroads were approaching the outskirts of the county. A great commercial building boom followed as lumber and brick structures, some two stories high, began replacing adobe ones. El Paso Street became a bustling center of commerce running from San Jacinto Plaza on San Francisco Street to the ferry landing at the Rio Grande.W.H. Timmons, El Paso: A Border History (El Paso, TX 1990), 171-72; C.L. Sonnichsen, Pass of the North: Four Centuries on the Rio Grande (El Paso, TX 1968), I, 255. In 1882, just months after the Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight, William J. Montgomery (1833‚Äì1899) built this structure on a vacant lot between two buildings that were situated North and South of the property. Montgomery made use of the two buildings' existing walls, constructing only a roof, floor, front wall and back wall. He ran a new wall down the middle, creating two new addresses, 216 and 218 El Paso Street.Dena Hirsch, ‚Äú216/218 South El Paso Street: A Building History,‚Äù (unpublished paper, 1984), 14. The building was typical of western frontier architecture of the late 19th century. It featured a false front to make it appear taller and more like commercial buildings found in the East. Originally, the building housed a drug store and a book store. Architectural significance The wooden facade of the building lies beneath a modern sign but the cornice is clearly visible. The outward appearance of the Montgomery building was typical of those built in Western towns during the railroad boom of the late 19th century. Developers wanted railroad towns to look as much like eastern towns as possible so stone and lumber quickly replaced adobe and log as the primary building materials. Timber was scarce in El Paso but the railroad brought milled lumber, much of it from the Cloudcroft area. Railroads also brought pressed tin, cast iron, glass and hardware that were used to simulate styles popular in the eastern United States.Elaine Freed, Preserving the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains (Albuquerque, NM 1992). The one-part commercial building is a simple box with a decorated wood fa√ßade and cornice. The architectural style of small, pitched-roof buildings with false fronts created the commercial core of the new western towns during the mid-19th century. The Montgomery building had one ground-level floor with a false front added to make the building appear taller. The false front was topped by a bracketed cornice typical of the Italianate style popular at the time. This created the impression that the building was larger and housed more businesses and people, similar to the main commercial streets found in eastern American towns. In front of the original structure there was a wooden sidewalk covered by a wooden roof and hitching posts for horses. It is known exactly what the exterior of the Montgomery building looked like in 1882 from a photograph taken by F. Parker who documented many of the changes taking place in the city during that period.Hirsch, \\"216/218 South El Paso Street\\", 9, 17. Modern times Modern-day view of the Montgomery Building after store hours. The two addresses have undergone many interior and exterior renovations over the years. They have housed drugstores, restaurants, shoemakers, and clothing stores. The building is now occupied by Dave‚Äôs Pawn Shop and a clothing store. With the arrival of the automobile and the paving of streets, the wooden sidewalks, post, and roofs were removed and conventional sidewalks were constructed.Hirsch, \\"216/218 South El Paso Street\\", 13, 9. Today, the wooden facade of the building lies beneath a modern sign but the cornice is clearly visible. 216-218 S. El Paso Street is a classic example of western architecture from the boom era of the 1880s. Situated on one of the past main commercial thoroughfares of the city, it continues to represent part of the rich frontier heritage of El Paso and is one of the few remaining structures from the original commercial district of the Old Western town of El Paso. The addresses 216 and 218 S. El Paso St. have remained in continuous use for more than one hundred and twenty years making it the oldest surviving commercial structure in the City of El Paso.

Career  After his time at school in Hanover Justus Henning B√∂hmer studied law at the University of Jena since 1693. He attended judicial lectures inter alia with Professor Nikolaus Christoph Lyncker and also lectures in philosophy and theology. Initially after his first dissertation he was acted as an advocate in his hometown Hanover, but this employment did not meet his demands. In the year 1697 he therefore accepted an offer from the University of Rinteln, where he lectured young noblemen on his subjects. Some months later he moved to the Martin-Luther-University of Halle which was founded 1694, where he prepared his second dissertation with Christian Thomasius, Johann Franz Buddeus and Samuel Stryck. On August 27, 1699 he succeeded to complete his licenciate of civil law and church law. After a further time of lectures he had the opportunity to establish contact to the Prussian king's court, while he attended his prot√©g√©, the young nobleman duke Heinrich Georg of Waldeck, to the court. There his extraordinary judicial talent attracted attention and on July 27, 1701 he was promoted to associate professor at the University of Halle, where he received his doctor's degree on August 11, 1702. He owed Samuel Stryck, who was his former mentor and paternal friend, his advancement to Stryck's adjutant on December 9, 1704 and later the position as professor of the judicial faculty at November 24, 1711. After Samuel Stryck's death in the year 1715 B√∂hmer was appointed to the professorship and obtained also Stryk's position of feudal law. coats of arms of the imperial count palatine Justus Henning B√∂hmer In the same year on August 17, the emperor court of Wien upgraded him to an Imperial Count Palatine (Hofpfalzgraf). Four years later, on May 23, 1719 king Frederick William I of Prussia awarded him the title Geheimer Rat and nominated him on May 25, 1719 as director of the University of Halle and deputy full professor of the judicial faculty. In the meantime and due to his good reputations he received offers from the emperor court of Wien, from the Universities of Bern, Kiel, Helmstedt, Frankfurt (Oder), T√ºbingen or Celle, but he disclaimed all of this, because he wanted to stay at Halle. Instead of this he advised his son Georg Ludwig B√∂hmer to the University of G√∂ttingen and his son Johann Samuel Friedrich von B√∂hmer to the University of Frankfurt (Oder). After the death of the chancellor of the Duchy of Magdeburg, Johann Peter von Ludewig, B√∂hmer was assigned Ludewig's function on December 14, 1743 and at the same time was promoted to full professor in Halle. But only a few years later suddenly he died with an apoplectic stroke.  Judicial efforts  Justus Henning B√∂hmer was characterised not only by his excellent scholarship, but also by his deep religious perception. Thus he composed some significant chants, especially in his earlier years. In the judicial field initially he was a protectionist of the existing ‚Äúterritorial system\\" or Erastian theory of ecclesiastical government, but in the following years he represented a tendency to the natural right and the ‚ÄúKollegialismus‚Äù ( Protestant ecclesiastical theory from the 18th century in Germany. It contains the Protestant perception at that time regarding the relationship between Church and State to be understood as collegia on basis of human agreement ), which was mainly continued by his sons. In his first great work, ‚Äújus ecclesiasticum protestantiun‚Äù he still drew on the traditional Canon Law, but he reformed the law to that effect that it was exempted from rigid orthodoxy, principles, resistance and dogmatism. Affected by the ideas of the Age of Enlightenment he represented an increasing critical and scientific development instead of a religious fundamentalism. B√∂hmers conception was predominant in the common Protestantism church law of the 18th century and was basis for further reforms to date. His results in the domain of civil law were of similar importance. In his next main work ‚ÄúIntroductio in jus digestorum‚Äù a pandects-compendium which was maintained until the 20th century, he liberated the traditional German law from the influence of the old Roman law and thus prepared the basis of ‚Äúgeneral Landrecht (law code) of the Prussian states‚Äù. A huge amount of further significant and notable works on civil and church law as well as expertises were penned by him, and were publicised by his son Georg Ludwig B√∂hmer after Justus Henning's death in the collected edition ‚ÄúExercitationes ad pandectas‚Äù some years later.  Family  Justus Henning B√∂hmer, son of the lawyer Valentin B√∂hmer (1634‚Äì1704) and Anna Margarethe Schirmer (1640‚Äì1714), was married to Eleonore Rosine St√ºtzing (1679‚Äì1739). With her he had five children, four sons and one daughter who died with the age of 14 months. Three of his sons, Johann Samuel Friedrich von B√∂hmer (1704‚Äì1772), Karl August von B√∂hmer (1707‚Äì1748) and Georg Ludwig B√∂hmer (1715‚Äì1797) were also important German jurists, whereas the fourth son, Philipp Adolf B√∂hmer (1716‚Äì1789) was a professor of medicine and anatomy and also personal physician of King Frederick William II of Prussia (1744‚Äì1797).

An Appendix of Whaling Terms was released in 2006 by Standard Recording Company. 2007 saw the release of Raven and the White Night on Jagjaguwar. The album found the band crafting material that blended the songwriting of Tapscott's solo work and the ambient textures developed on Odawas' Jagjaguwar debut. In 2008 Tapscott and Edwards relocated to Chicago, IL and began recording their next album The Blue Depths, which was released in 2009.

Prior to its publication in 1940 by Farrar & Rinehart, Inc., the novel was abridged in the May 1940 issue of The American Magazine, titled \\"Sisters in Trouble.\\" The story's magazine appearance was \\"reviewed\\" by the FBI as part of its surveillance of Stout. Where There's a Will was the last Wolfe novel published before World War II. Stout did not write any others during the war, resuming the series with The Silent Speaker in 1946; he did, however, continue to publish shorter works featuring the character. Plot summary Carl Mueller illustrated \\"Sisters in Trouble,\\" the abridged version of Where There's a Will that appeared in the May 1940 issue of The American Magazine The famous Hawthorne sisters ‚Äî April, May and June ‚Äî visit Nero Wolfe in a body to ask his help in averting a scandal. After the shock of their brother Noel's death three days before, they have been dealt another shock at learning the terms of his will. May, a college president, insists that Noel had promised to leave $1 million to her school; however, the will leaves each sister nothing but a piece of fruit and passes almost all of Noel's estate to a young woman named Naomi Karn. The sisters want to hire Wolfe to persuade Naomi to turn over at least half of the inheritance so that Noel's widow Daisy will not bring a case to court that would cause a sensation. Daisy's unexpected arrival interrupts the conference. She wears a veil at all times to cover the disfiguring scars left after Noel accidentally shot her with a bow and arrow. She discovered that Noel was having an affair with Naomi and now hates the entire Hawthorne family as a result. Wolfe assures her that he will consider her interests in addition to those of the sisters and attempt to negotiate with Naomi on their behalf. Later that day, Inspector Cramer interrupts another meeting with the news that Noel had in fact been murdered. He had been killed by a shotgun blast while hunting on his country estate; it was assumed that he had tripped and discharged the weapon, but further analysis of the evidence has led the police to discard this theory. Archie is called away to help Fred Durkin keep an eye on a man whom Fred had been tailing - Eugene Davis, a partner at the law firm that drew up Noel's will, who had been seen in a bar with Naomi. Davis is now drunk and passed out in a run-down apartment. 300px 300px On Wolfe's orders, Archie travels to the Hawthorne mansion on 67th Street, where he finds Wolfe, the family and other associated individuals gathered to meet with the local police. Archie finds, to his surprise, that there are apparently two Daisy Hawthornes in the house. One is meeting with Wolfe and accusing April of the murder, based on the fact that a cornflower was found next to the body and April had had a bunch of them with her. The other is speaking to Naomi in the living room. The one meeting with Wolfe turns out to be the real Daisy and Wolfe later determines that the other was actually April in disguise, trying to get information out of Naomi about the will and the relationship between her and Noel. Later in the day, Archie finds Naomi strangled to death, her body hidden in an alcove next to the living room. Wolfe slips out of the house without telling Archie and has Orrie Cather drive him back to Wolfe's brownstone on 35th Street. After being confronted by the Hawthornes, Daisy spitefully claims to the police that April is the murderer, and she is arrested by the authorities. Meanwhile, June's daughter Sara tells Archie that someone has stolen her camera. The film it contained had already been sent off to be developed and Wolfe and Archie later retrieve the pictures. After examining them, Wolfe warns Sara that her life will be in danger if she returns to the estate and has her stay at the brownstone. Cramer threatens to arrest Wolfe as a material witness to Naomi's murder, but Wolfe counters by threatening to turn evidence of the murderer's guilt over to a local newspaper instead of the police. With all of the principals assembled in his office, Wolfe accuses Davis of switching Noel's actual will (which left generous bequests to Daisy, his sisters and May's college) with a forgery that leaves nearly the entire estate to Naomi, in a plot to win her affections, and of killing Noel and Naomi. When Glenn Prescott, another of the law firm's partners, agrees with this theory, Davis angrily accuses him of the murders. Wolfe then reveals his evidence: one of Sara's pictures, which shows Prescott wearing a wild rose in his lapel, a flower that he could not have obtained in the city. He had picked it at the scene of Noel's murder, discarding the cornflower he had worn (later found near the body) and had only remembered after Sara had taken the photograph. Prescott is placed under arrest and Archie decides to keep the material witness warrant as a souvenir. The unfamiliar word \\"Nero Wolfe talks in a way that no human being on the face of the earth has ever spoken, with the possible exception of Rex Stout after he had a gin and tonic,\\" said Michael Jaffe, executive producer of the A&E; TV series, A Nero Wolfe Mystery.Quoted in Vitaris, Paula, \\"Miracle on 35th Street: Nero Wolfe on Television,\\" Scarlet Street, issue #45, 2002, p. 36 Nero Wolfe's erudite vocabulary is one of the hallmarks of the character. Examples of unfamiliar words ‚Äî or unfamiliar uses of words that some would otherwise consider familiar ‚Äî are found throughout the corpus, often in the give-and-take between Wolfe and Archie. * Caracoles, chapter 5. Seated in the red chair, Naomi Karn begins her conversation with Nero Wolfe with an evasive maneuver.

A Catalogue of Crime. New York: Harper & Row. 1971, revised and enlarged edition 1989. *Herbert Mitgang, Dangerous Dossiers: Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors ‚Äî While [World War II] was on, Stout, who had organized the Writers' War Board and became its chairman, was placed on something called the \\"General Watch List.\\" Hoover himself, according to a heavily censored page marked Confidential, requested Byron Price, director of Censorship, Federal Trade Commission Building, Washington, to include Rex Stout of Brewster, New York, on \\"General Watch List No. 49.\\" The FBI watched what Stout wrote and somehow turned his fiction into suspicious fact. Because, for example, of a story that appeared in the May 1940 issue of American Magazine called \\"Sisters in Trouble,\\" he was labeled what might be called \\"prematurely anti-Nazi.\\" A highly imaginative document from Los Angeles (correspondent's name censored) to the FBI's Communications Division in Washington claimed that the story was \\"either a deliberate attempt to convey a meaning other than the solution of a mystery story ‚Äî or else the whole thing is full of coincidences. Note the almost exclusive German cast of characters, particularly Fritz Brenner. Could Fritz refer to the German Consul in San Francisco and could Brenner have any reference to the Brenner pass? Could 'Nero' refer to Rome by any chance? While for the purposes of the story, April, May and June are the names of three sisters, couldn't it also mean that for three months, or until July, somebody's back was to the door ‚Äî maybe the door to the Balkans or the Mediterranean?\\" When it served its purposes, agents of the FBI could turn into literary critics, finding, however ludicrous, damning symbols in fiction.Mitgang, Herbert, Dangerous Dossiers: Exposing the Secret War Against America's Greatest Authors (1988, Donald I.

She stayed with the Romanov family when they were arrested, and was executed at the same time as Alexandra on July 17, 1918. She had shared the Romanov family's exile at Tobolsk and Ekaterinburg following the Russian Revolution of 1917 before their execution. She is remembered for staying with the Romanovs to the end. In 1981 she was canonized as an Orthodox martyr by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) but not by the Russian Orthodox Church. Life Anna Demidova, whose nickname was \\"Nyuta,\\" was described in adulthood as a \\"tall, statuesque blonde.\\"King, Greg, and Wilson, Penny, The Fate of the Romanovs, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., 2003, , pp. 63-64 She was the daughter of Stepan Demidov and his wife. He was a well-off merchant in Cherepovets, where he also served on the Cherepovets City Duma. Demidova graduated from the Yaroslavl Institute for Maids with a teaching certificate. She was a good friend of Elizaveta Ersberg, a parlormaid at the court, and was once engaged to Ersberg's brother Nikolai. About 1905 Ersberg secured her friend a position at the court as a parlormaid.Radzinsky, Edvard. The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II, p.116, Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2011 In his memoirs, Charles Sydney Gibbes, the Romanov children's English tutor, described Demidova as \\"of a singularly timid and shrinking disposition.\\" =Exile and death= A forensic facial reconstruction of Anna Demidova by S.A. Nikitin, 1994. Later Demidova began working more directly in service to Tsarina Alexandra and followed her into exile. In April 1918, after the Russian Revolution, she accompanied her mistress, Tsar Nicholas II, and Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia when they were transferred by Bolsheviks from Tobolsk to Ekaterinburg. The remaining four Romanov children and other members of their retinue stayed behind in Tobolsk for a month because the Tsarevich Alexei was ill as a result of his hemophilia. As her group left Tobolsk, Demidova said to Gibbes, \\"I am so frightened of the Bolsheviks, Mr. Gibbes. I don't know what they will do to us.\\"King and Wilson, p. 87 On the night of the murder, the family was awakened and told to dress. Demidova carried two pillows into which gems had been sewn. After the first volley of fire by the killers, Demidova, who had fainted after being wounded, revived and, finding herself still alive, exclaimed \\"Thank God! God has saved me!\\" Hearing her, the assassins turned on her. Crying, she attempted to defend herself, but was stabbed to death with bayonets.King and Wilson, p. 311 Discovery of remains The Bolsheviks, followed by the Soviet Union government, tried to suppress information about the executions of the Romanov family and their retainers. In 1979 the gravesite containing most of the bodies was found by an amateur, but the government did not acknowledge this until 1989, in the period of glasnost. DNA analysis and forensics were used to identify the Romanov members. The remains of Tsarevich Alexei and one of his sisters were missing from this gravesite, but were finally discovered in 2007 in another, nearby, unmarked gravesite. Their identities were confirmed by DNA analysis, but the Russian Orthodox Church asked to retain Alexei's remains for more testing and, as of 2015, still held them. Funeral A state funeral was held on July 17, 1998, in Peter and Paul Cathedral in St. Petersburg for the Romanov family, Demidova, and the other victims killed by the Bolsheviks eighty years earlier. Demidova's great-niece, Natalie Demidova, was among the attendees. At the time, leaders of the Russian Orthodox Church did not attend because they disputed the identification of victims. Canonization In 2000 the Russian Orthodox Church canonized all seven members of the Russian royal family: Nicholas and Alexandra, and their five children. In literature and drama Anna Demidova is featured as a character in the play, Ekaterinburg (2013) by D. Logan. It explores the time in captivity of the Romanovs and their retainers in the Ipatiev House in Ekaterinburg.Logan, D., Ekaterinburg: A Play (2013) Notes See also *Romanov sainthood 1878 births 1918 deaths Canonised servants of the Romanov household Russian saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church 20th-century Christian saints Victims of Red Terror in Soviet Russia People from Cherepovets Executed people from Vologda Oblast People executed by stabbing Christian female saints of the Late Modern era People executed by Russia by firing squad Executed Russian women Anna Stepanovna Russian courtiers ","title":"Anna Demidova"},{"id":"9717310","text":"Neptune is a noise music band from Boston, noted for having built their custom-made guitars and basses out of scrap metal.

Commissioned on 18 June 1942, she spent most of her career in the Mediterranean Sea. After an initial patrol in the Norwegian Sea, P48 sailed to Gibraltar, then was assigned to the 10th Submarine Flotilla, based in Malta. After an uneventful patrol, she departed port on her last patrol, on 23 December 1942. She is thought to have been sunk two days later whilst attacking an Italian convoy in the Gulf of Tunis heading towards Tunis, from depth charges launched by the Italian torpedo boat Ardente, northwest of the island of Zembra. This vessel and her crew were honoured and immortalized by the nephew of one of the lost sailors (Lt. Stephen E. Spring Rice, RNVR), English musician Thomas Dolby, in the song \\"One of Our Submarines\\". Design and description The third batch was slightly enlarged and improved over the preceding second batch of the U class. The submarines had a length of overall and displaced on the surface and submerged. The U-class submarines had a crew of 31 officers and ratings. P48 was powered on the surface by two diesel engines providing a total of and when submerged by two electric motors with a total of through two propeller shafts. The maximum speed was on the surface and underwater. P48 was armed with four 21-inch torpedo tubes in the bow and also carried four reloads for a grand total of eight torpedoes. The boat was also equipped with a 3-inch (76 mm) deck gun. Construction and service Ordered on 23 August 1940, P48 was laid down on 2 August 1941 by Vickers Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness, then launched on 15 April 1942. She was commissioned on 18 June 1942 at Holy Loch, then conducted training and diving tests in the River Clyde area. After additional tests with torpedoes off Arrochar, the submarine then sailed for Lerwick, arriving on 17 July. The next day on 18 July, P48 departed Lerwick for an anti-submarine patrol in the Norwegian Sea. The patrol was uneventful, and she returned to port on 29 July. After passing through Holy Loch and Rothesay, the boat departed for Gibraltar on 12 August; after one week at sea, she was ordered to search for a German tanker, but suffered flooding in her auxiliary machinery, forcing her to abandon her patrol and continue to Gibraltar. On 23 August, P48 arrived and underwent repairs, then exercises until 27 September. Between 29 September and 6 October 1942, P48 conducted another patrol, in the Alboran Sea, but did not record any sinkings. On 31 October, P48 departed Gibraltar for another patrol in the Mediterranean, with orders to conduct a special landing operation off Algiers, then proceed to Malta. Her armament had been reduced to six torpedoes overall to make space for the extra equipment. On 4 October, P48 launched a landing party in a folbot, then acted as a directional radio beacon during the Allied landings three days later. After being ordered to patrol off Bizerte, Tunisia, P48 sighted an enemy merchant ship and attacked it with three torpedoes, but missed. After another unsuccessful attack, the submarine ended her patrol in Malta and joined the 10th Submarine Flotilla which was based there. On 26 November, P48 started another patrol, northeast of Tunisia. One week later, she attacked a German-Italian convoy, but did not obtain any hits; she was subsequently attacked with depth charges by escorting ships but was not damaged. On 5 December, the boat launched three torpedoes at a German merchant ship, escorted by a destroyer. The torpedoes missed, however, and P48 was again attacked, but escaped unscathed. the submarine returned to Malta on 8 December. HMS P48 departed Malta on her last patrol on 23 December 1942, under the command of Lieutenant M.E. Faber. Two days later, while attacking a large Italian convoy, an escorting aircraft fired bursts of machine-gun fire into the sea to signal the presence of an enemy submarine. Seconds later, the escorting Italian torpedo boat Ardente made sonar contact with a target, then attacked it with 48 depth charges. A large oil patch 100‚Äì150 metres in diameter was observed in position and the crew of the torpedo boat claimed the submarine sunk. It is most likely that the submarine was P48, but her wreck was not found and it is possible that she was sunk elsewhere later. The submarine was officially declared overdue on 5 January 1943.

Red building is one of two gatehouses Ridgewood Reservoir is a decommissioned 19th century reservoir that sits on the Brooklyn‚ÄìQueens border in New York City, within what is now Highland Park. The reservoir itself is actually on the Queens side of the border in the neighborhood of Glendale. The reservoir and park are bounded on the north by the Jackie Robinson Parkway, on the south by Highland Boulevard, on the west by the backyards of homes on Bulwer Place and on the east by Cypress Hills National Cemetery. In 2018 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Construction Ridgewood Reservoir was built by the City of Brooklyn, New York, which was rapidly outgrowing its local water supplies. In 1851 the City thought it was failing to attract business firms that would have moved to Brooklyn if it had as reliable a water source as New York City's Croton Aqueduct. Various sources were proposed. The Croton River was thought to be inadequate to New York City's future alone, so would not be available to Brooklyn. The Bronx River was both inadequate and difficult of access. Wells in and near Brooklyn were inadequate both in quantity and quality. Natural lakes on Long Island were few and could not provide enough water. The only solution was to tap the many small streams on Long Island and conduct their water to Brooklyn to be lifted into an elevated reservoir. The original design of the Ridgewood Reservoir as well as the final specifications for the Brooklyn Water Works system was designed by Brooklyn civil engineer, Samuel McElroy. This original design called for three basins, however, later engineer James P. Kirkwood altered the designs and instead built a double basin.Documents and plans submitted by the Water committee to the Common ... - Google Books Result The new double reservoir was built in Snediker's Cornfield on a hilltop near Evergreen Cemetery in what was once part of Ridgewood, Queens (this section of Queens is now part of Glendale) and was sealed by puddling with clay and paving with stones. Ground was broken for the reservoir on July 11, 1856 and water was first raised on November 18, 1858. Ridgewood Reservoir, Brooklyn, ca. 1872-1887. (5832944747) In 1862, the water supply for the reservoir consisted of six dammed streams in what is now Queens and Nassau Counties: Jamaica Stream (Baisley Pond), Simonson's Stream, Clear Stream, Valley Stream, Pine's Stream, and Hempstead Stream (Hempstead Lake). This water was carried in a 12-mile-long masonry conduit, called the Ridgewood Aqueduct, to a pumping station at Atlantic Avenue and Chestnut Street near the City Line. There, steam-powered pumps, each with a capacity of 14 million gallons () per day, forced the water up through a reinforced tube into the high reservoir whence it was distributed. By 1868 the Ridgewood Reservoir held an average of 154.4 million gallons () daily, enough to supply the City of Brooklyn for ten days at that time. In subsequent decades the Brooklyn Water Works system was repeatedly expanded by adding wells and collection reservoirs, extending the conduit farther east, and adding pumps. The Ridgewood Reservoir's third basin was completed in 1891. Farmers in southern Queens County complained that Brooklyn's thirst was lowering the water table. Late in the century, the conduit was extended to a large pumping station in Massapequa, some away. Efforts to extend it farther were thwarted by legislation protecting the water of Suffolk County. Force Tube Avenue, Conduit Boulevard, and Sunrise Highway were built, in part, atop the water conduit or within its right of way, early in the 20th century. Highland Park was created on land immediately surrounding Ridgewood Reservoir that was purchased by the City of Brooklyn in 1891 under the jurisdiction of the Highland Park Society. The park was constructed between 1901 and 1906 and included additional parcels purchased to the south and west. Decommissioning In 1898, Brooklyn merged with the City of Greater New York, thus gaining access to the superior New York City water supply system. Ridgewood Reservoir was expensive to operate because of the need for pumping and was slowly made obsolete by expansion of New York City's Catskill and Delaware water systems. Ridgewood Reservoir became a backup reservoir in 1959 with the third basin being filled with water from the Catskill system. The reservoir was last used in a drought in the 1960s. During the 1970s the reservoir was the site of illegal swimming and a number of drownings. The reservoir was finally decommissioned and drained in 1989. Some of the Nassau County pumping stations including the one at Milburn (now Baldwin) survived into the 21st century as ruins. Valley Stream State Park, Hempstead Lake State Park, and other South Shore lakes and parks were originally Brooklyn Water Works reservoirs. Following decommissioning and abandonment, the reservoir naturally became a small birch forest (one of the few on Long Island) with a grassy marsh in the center basin. The creation of this virtual nature sanctuary attracted a wide variety of fauna, including some rare species of birds. The bicycling trail around the reservoir perimeter became part of the Brooklyn-Queens Greenway. In 2004, the reservoir was officially turned over to the Department of Parks for more extensive integration into Highland Park. In October 2007, the Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe quietly unveiled a contract to breach one of the reservoir basins and clear for new ball fields. However, on June 26, 2008, Comptroller of New York City Bill Thompson, Jr. rejected that contract for the new development, citing concerns about the environmental impact, increased truck traffic, and the vendor selection process. There is an extensive community effort to keep the reservoir in its \\"natural\\" state as a nature preserve. Controversy In 2014, plans, which were obtained through a freedom of information request by Save Ridgewood Reservoir, a local nonprofit dedicated to keeping the reservoir in its natural state, indicate the City's intention to construct culverts to breach the three basins. These plans illustrate the design and construction of culverts large enough to accommodate trucks and are part of a City Parks Department project that has been said is necessary to eliminate a flooding hazard. This has brought the concerns of development of the site back to the forefront. The City has stated that unless this work is done, the State of New York will issue fines since the reservoir has been classified as a dam and according to guidelines is therefore a flooding hazard. This is not without controversy as local activists have pointed out that only one of the three basins has water in it at any given time and that the depth of that water is, at most, two feet (60 cm). Activists further cite historical records The Brooklyn Water Works And Sewers. A Descriptive Memoir, by D. Van Nostrand that indicate it took massive, steam- powered pumps 6 months to fill the reservoir basins halfway. This work was scheduled to begin in August 2014 but went on hold. In September 2014 the state decided to consider reclassifying the basins such that breaching will no longer be required. As of April 2015, the State DEC has now indicated that it may decide NOT to classify the basins as wetlands thereby leaving them subject to possible breaching and development under the plan that was supposed to have begun in August 2014. This has caused great concern among local residents. In December 2017 the State DEC issued a Wetland Delineation Report for Ridgewood Reservoir.

It was founded in 1988 by Dave C. and Donna Cooper of New Albany, Indiana, and was created to serve the growing market of coin-op memorabilia collectors, hobbyists, and restorers. The first issue, dated January 1989, focused on jukeboxes. The magazine also covered other coin-operated playthings, such as pinball machines, slot machines, and gumball machines, in addition to related items such as carousels, gas station memorabilia, and antique ice cream scoops. History In 1993 GameRoom absorbed a competing periodical, The Pinball Trader. To serve this market, GameRoom increased its pinball machine coverage. GameRoom was subsequently sold to Tim and Jacqueline Ferrante after the passing of Dave Cooper in September 1996. After relocating the magazine's homebase to Keyport, New Jersey, the magazine grew to feature regular columnists, more pages, a website online, and a merchandise department. Coverage of arcade video games increased in January 1997, and in 2001 GameRoom published The Arcade Video Game Price Guide, the world's first comprehensive pricing guide for arcade video games. In late 2005, after nine years, the Ferrantes sold the magazine to Kevin Steele, best known as the creator of RetroBlast!, a website focusing on the home arcade industry. The first issue under Steele's direction was the January 2006 issue. Under his ownership, GameRoom features increased content, usually around 64 pages an issue, and full color pages throughout the magazine. Around November 17, 2010 a notice was posted to the magazine's website announcing the magazine was no longer economically feasible to produce and would cease publication immediately. The last issue produced was October 2010 - volume 22 number 10. On May 1, 2014, The Pinball Company announced it had acquired the assets of GameRoom and had plans to re-launch the magazine in the fall of that year. The magazine is now a quarterly publication and provides more high quality images of new and classic pinball machines and arcades. It continues to feature articles related to game room products and those who play and collect them. Five issues have been published (as of September 2016) under publisher, Nic Parks, and Editor Meredith Hoenes-Buckman, both of Columbia, MO. Focus Coverage of pinball games, jukeboxes, arcade video games, and arcade emulation cabinets are frequent topics, as are tips on repairing and restoring these machines. Interviews with game creators and programmers, spotlights on individual collector's home game room layouts, reviews of topical books and DVDs, and news items of interest to those with game rooms are also featured monthly.

Identical in dimensions and specifications to her sister ship and running mate , RMS Lucania was the joint largest passenger liner afloat when she entered service in 1893. On her second voyage, she won the prestigious Blue Riband from the other Cunarder to become the fastest passenger liner afloat, a title she kept until 1898. Power plant and construction One of Campania's triple expansion engines. Lucania and Campania were partly financed by the Admiralty. The deal was that Cunard would receive money from the Government in return for constructing vessels to admiralty specifications and also on condition that the vessels go on the naval reserve list to serve as armed merchant cruisers when required by the government. The contracts were awarded to the Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company, which at the time was one of Britain‚Äôs biggest producers of warships. Plans were soon drawn up for a large, twin- screw steamer powered by triple expansion engines, and construction began in 1891, just 43 days after Cunards' order. Lucania and Campania had the largest triple-expansion engines ever fitted to a Cunard ship. These engines were also the largest in the world at the time, and still rank today amongst the largest of the type ever constructed. They represent the limits of development for this kind of technology, which was superseded a few years later by turbine technology. In height, the engines were 47 feet, reaching from the double- bottom floor of the engine room almost to the top of the superstructure ‚Äì over five decks. Each engine had five cylinders. There were two high-pressure cylinders, each measuring in diameter; one intermediate-pressure cylinder measuring in diameter; and two low-pressure cylinders, each measuring in diameter. They operated with a stroke of . Steam was raised from 12 double- ended scotch boilers, each measuring in diameter and having eight furnaces. There was also one single-ended boiler for auxiliary machinery and one, smaller, donkey boiler. Boiler pressure was 165 lb, and enabled the engines to produce , which translated to an average speed of , and a record speed of knots. Normal operating speed for the engines was about 79 rpm. Each engine was located in a separate watertight engine compartment. In case of a hull breach in that area, only one engine room would then be flooded, and the ship would still have use of the adjacent engine. In addition to this Lucania had 16 transverse watertight compartments, with watertight doors that could be manually closed on command from the telegraph on the bridge. She could remain afloat with any two compartments flooded. Passenger accommodation Handbook issued to passengers on RMS Lucania and RMS Campania In their day, both ships offered the most luxurious first-class passenger accommodations available. According to maritime historian Basil Greenhill, in his book Merchant Steamships, the interiors of Campania and Lucania represented Victorian opulence at its peak ‚Äì an expression of a highly confident and prosperous age that would never be quite repeated on any other ship. Greenhill remarked that later vessels' interiors degenerated into \\"grandiose vulgarity, the classical syntax debased to mere jargon\\". All the first-class public rooms, and the en- suite staterooms of the upper deck, were generally heavily panelled, in oak, satinwood or mahogany; and thickly carpeted. Velvet curtains hung aside the windows and portholes, while the furniture was richly upholstered in matching design. The predominant style was Art Nouveau, although other styles were also in use, such as \\"French Renaissance\\" which was applied to the forward first- class entrance hall, whilst the 1st class smoking room was in \\"Elizabethan style\\", comprising heavy oak panels surrounding the first open fireplace ever to be used aboard a passenger liner. Perhaps the finest room in the vessels was the first class dining saloon, over 10 feet (3.05 m) high and measuring 98 feet (30 m) long by 63 feet (19.2 m) wide. Over the central part of this room was a well that rose through three decks to a skylight. It was done in a style described as \\"modified Italian style\\", with a coffered ceiling in white and gold, supported by ionic pillars. The panelled walls were done in Spanish mahogany, inlaid with ivory and richly carved with pilasters and decorations. Wireless history An early example of The Cunard Daily BulletinOn 15 June 1901 Lucania became the first Cunard liner to be fitted with a Marconi wireless system. Cunard made a long trial of the installation, making their second installation to the RMS Campania on 21 September. Shortly after these installations, the two ships made history by exchanging the first wireless transmitted ice bulletin. In October 1903, Guglielmo Marconi chose Lucania to carry out further experiments in wireless telegraphy, and was able to stay in contact with radio stations in Nova Scotia and Poldhu. Thus it became possible to transmit news to Lucania for the whole duration of the Atlantic crossing. On 10 October, Lucania made history again by publishing an onboard news-sheet based on information received by wireless telegraphy whilst at sea. The newspaper was called Cunard Daily Bulletin and quickly became a regular and successful publication. Final days Lucania at sea Lucania and Campania served as Cunard's major passenger liners for 14 years, during which time both liners were superseded in speed and size by a succession of four-funnelled German liners, starting with the in 1897. The German competition necessitated the construction of replacements for the two Cunarders, which came to fruition in 1907 with the appearance of the and . It was soon decided that Lucania was no longer needed, and her last voyage was on 7 July 1909, after which she was laid up at the Huskisson Dock in Liverpool. On the evening of 14 August 1909, she was badly damaged by a fire and partially sank at her berth. Five days later she was sold for scrap and the contents of her interior auctioned.

He also received a Fulbright Scholarship, allowing him to study at the Vienna Academy of Music under Franz Samohyl. In 1956-64 he played with the Cleveland Orchestra. He taught at Smith College as well as being William R. Kenan Professor of Music Emeritus, teaching at Smith College and Amherst College. He was known for his involvement with the Marlboro Music Festival, which he had performed at since its inception.

He played all or part of seven seasons in Major League Baseball from 1992 until 1998, and two seasons in Nippon Professional Baseball in 1999‚Äì2000. Listed at 6'2\\", 210 lb., he was a switch-hitter and threw right- handed.  Early life  Nieves attended Luis Pales Matos High School in Santa Rosa, Puerto Rico before being signed by the Atlanta Braves in 1988.  Professional career  = Atlanta Braves = Nieves started his professional career fairly poorly. In 56 games with the Gulf Coast League Braves in 1988, he batting average was .170. He was only 16 years old at that time. His time with the Pulaski Braves in 1989 was a great improvement. He played 64 games with them that year, hitting .277 with nine home runs and 64 RBI. He continued his improvement in 1990, hitting .283 with nine home runs and 59 RBI in 126 games with the Sumter Braves. His 10 stolen bases is a professional career high that he would match only once more in his career. His 1991 season with the Durham Bulls was less stellar than his previous season-he hit only .264-but he remained consistent in the home run category, again hitting nine home runs. He did very well in 1992, hitting a combined 26 home runs between the Bulls and Greenville Braves. This prompted his promotion to the Majors, and he made his debut on September 1 of that year with the Braves. At the age of 20, he was the youngest player to don a big league uniform that season. His first stint in the majors was less than impressive-in 19 at-bats, he hit only .211. He collected his first big league hit off the infamous Anthony Young of the New York Mets in his second career at-bat on September 2. = San Diego Padres = He started the 1993 season in the Braves system, hitting .278 with 10 home runs in 78 games with the Richmond Braves, before being traded with minor leaguer Vince Moore and Donnie Elliott to the San Diego Padres for Fred McGriff in July of that year. In 43 games with the Padres' AAA team, the Las Vegas Stars, he hit .308 with seven home runs. He spent 19 games in the Majors in 1993, hitting an unimpressive .191. He did hit his first career home run that season, a solo shot off pitcher Chris Hammond on September 8. He was the seventh youngest player to don a uniform in 1993. According to Baseball America, he was the 39th best prospect in 1993. His 1994 season was perhaps the best of his professional career. In 406 at-bats with Las Vegas, he blasted 25 home runs and drove in 92 runs, all the while hitting .308. A poor eye at the plate led him to 138 strikeouts, though. That earned him a promotion to the majors, where he for once was somewhat impressive-in 19 at-bats with the Padres, he hit .263. He spent all of 1995 with the Padres. In 234 at-bats, he hit only .205 with 88 strikeouts. His 14 home runs were overshadowed by the large number of whiffs. He hit the only two grand slams of his career in 1995-the first off Terry Mulholland on August 2 and the second off Doug Henry on August 26. Baseball America says he was the 69th best prospect in 1994. Perhaps it was his poor performance in 1995 that prompted the Padres to trade him. On March 22, 1996, just before the beginning of the season, Nieves was traded with Raul Casanova and Richie Lewis to the Detroit Tigers for Sean Bergman, Todd Steverson and Cade Gaspar, a minor leaguer. = Detroit Tigers = His 1996 season undoubtedly the best of his career, but overall not a great season. He played in 120 games with Detroit that season, hitting 24 home runs and driving in 60 RBI. His batting average was only .246, though, and he struck out 158 times in 431 at-bats. Perhaps the most memorable game of his 1996 season was on April 6-against the Oakland Athletics, he collected two doubles, a triple and a home run. Twice in 1996 he also accomplished the fairly rare feat of hitting home runs from both sides of the plate in a game. The first time he did it was against the Milwaukee Brewers on July 15-he victimized pitchers Ricky Bones and Mike Potts in that game. The next time he did it was on August 20. against the Chicago White Sox. In that game, he victimized pitchers Kevin Tapani and Rich Sauveur. Oddly, those were the only two games in his career in which he hit two or more home runs. Although he hit 20 home runs in 1997 for Detroit, his batting average again was subpar at .228, and he struck out 157 times in 359 at-bats. His 158 strikeouts in 1996 and 157 strikeouts in 1997 were second most by a batter each year, trailing only Jay Buhner each year. = Cincinnati Reds = On November 11, 1997, he was traded from the Tigers to the Cincinnati Reds for Paul Bako and Donne Wall. Although he played 15 games and hit .283 in the minors with the Indianapolis Indians in 1998, he spent most of the season as a bench player, getting 119 at-bats in 83 games. He hit .252 in that time. That would be the last of the majors he would see, playing his final game on September 14 of that year. He finished his big league career on a ten at-bat long hitless streak. = Minor leagues and overseas = Although his big league career was over, his professional career was far from it. In 1999, he signed with the NPB's Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. From that point on, he played affiliated, foreign and independent baseball. In addition to Japan, Nieves has spent time in Mexico, the Atlantic League, and the Northern League, just to name a few locations. Most recently, he spent 2008 with the Vaqueros Laguna of the Mexican League.  Career overview  Overall, he hit .231 with 63 home runs and 187 RBI in the majors. He played in 458 games, collected 284 hits, walked 136 times and struck out 483 times. The numbers he wore in his career were 7 (1992), 10 (1993), 3 (1994‚Äì1995), 30 (1996‚Äì1997) and 46 (1998).

According to Ottoman military records, Kurdish rebellions have been taking place in Anatolia for over two centuries, Translated from Turkish by Nuran ƒ∞nan√ß. While tribal Kurdish revolts had shuttered the Ottoman Empire through the last decades of its existence, the conflict in its modern phase is considered to have begun in 1922, with the emergence of Kurdish nationalism in parallel with the formation of the modern State of Turkey. In 1925, an uprising for an independent Kurdistan, led by Shaikh Said Piran, was put down quickly, and Said and 36 of his followers were executed soon thereafter. Several other large scale Kurdish revolts occurred in Ararat and Dersim in 1930 and 1937. The British consul at Trebizond, the diplomatic post closest to Dersim, spoke of brutal and indiscriminate violence and made an explicit comparison with the Armenian massacres of 1915. \\"Thousands of Kurds,\\" he wrote, \\"including women and children, were slain; others, mostly children, were thrown into the Euphrates; while thousands of others in less hostile areas, who had first been deprived of their cattle and other belongings, were deported to vilayets (provinces) in Central Anatolia. It is now stated that the Kurdish question no longer exists in Turkey.\\" Kurds accuse successive Turkish governments of suppressing their identity through such means as the banning of Kurdish language in print and media. Atat√ºrk believed the unity and stability of a country lay in a unitary political identity, relegating cultural and ethnic distinctions to the private sphere. However, many Kurds did not relinquish their identities and language. Large-scale armed conflict between the Turkish armed forces and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) occurred throughout the 1980s and 1990s, leaving over 35,000 dead. Recent moves by the Turkish government have provided Kurds with limited rights and freedoms, particularly in regards to the Kurdish language, education, and media. Kurdish politicians and activists still face pressure. History =Ko√ßkiri rebellion (1920)= The 1920 Ko√ßkiri Rebellion in the overwhelmingly Qizilbash Dersim region, while waged by the Qizilbash Ko√ßkiri tribe, was masterminded by members of an organisation known as the K√ºrdistan Ta√¢l√Æ Cemiyeti (KTC). (footnote 35) and This particular rebellion failed for several reasons, most of which have something to do with its Qizilbash character. The fact was that many Dersim tribal chiefs at this point still supported the Kemalists ‚Äî regarding Mustafa Kemal as their 'protector' against the excesses of Sunni religious zealots, some of whom were Kurmanc√Æ Kurds. To most Kurmanc√Æ Kurds at the time, the uprising appeared to be merely an Alevi uprising ‚Äî and thus not in their own interests. In the aftermath of the Ko√ßkiri rebellion there was talk in the new Turkish Republic's Grand National Assembly of some very limited forms of 'Autonomous Administration' by the Kurds in a Kurdish region centered in Kurdistan. All this disappeared in the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, however. Bitterly disappointed, the Kurds turned again to armed struggle in 1925 ‚Äî this time led by the Zaza cleric Sheikh Said, but organized by another, newer, Kurdish nationalist organization, Azad√Æ. = Beytussebab rebellion (1924) = =Sheikh Said rebellion (1925)= The main rebellion which dominates the history of the Kurds in Turkey is that of the 1925 rebellion in Kurdistan region of Turkey which was led by Sheikh Said. The repression and aggression of Kemalist secularism followed and all public manifestations of Kurdish identity was outlawed which, in turn, prepared Kurds for more rebellion. The revolt of Sheikh Said began in February 1925. Of almost 15,000 fighters who participated in the rebellion against the 52,000 Turkish Gendarmerie, the main Kurdish tribes participating in the rebellion came from Zaza. The rebellion covered most of the part of Amed (Diyarbakir) and Mardin provinces. The Sheikh Said rebellion was the first large scale rebellion of the Kurdish race movement in Turkey. The main organizer of this rebellion was the Kurdish Independent Society, Azadi. Azadi's intention was to liberate Kurds from Turkish oppression and thus deliver freedom and further, develop their country. By March 1925 the revolt was pretty much over. Sheikh Said and all the other rebel leaders were hanged by June 29. In Fall of 1927 Sheikh Abdurrahman (brother of Sheikh Said) began a series of attacks on Turkish garrisons in Palu and Malatya. Districts of Lice, Bing√∂l were captured by the rebels. They also occupied the heights south of Erzurum. Turkish military used air force against the rebels using five airplanes in Mardin. In October 1927, Kurdish rebels attacked and occupied Bayazid. The brother of Sheikh Said tried to exact revenge on the Turkish government by attacking several army bases in Kurdistan. Nothing permanent was accomplished. They were driven out after Turkish reinforcements arrived in the area. The rebellion failed, however, by 1929, Ihsan Nuri‚Äôs movement was in control of a large expanse of Kurdish territory and the revolt was put down by the year 1930. =Ararat rebellion (1927‚Äì30)= The Republic of Ararat () was a self-proclaimed Kurdish state. It was located in the east of modern Turkey, being centered on Aƒürƒ± Province. The Republic of Ararat was declared independent in 1927, during a wave of rebellion among Kurds in south-eastern Turkey. The rebellion was led by General ƒ∞hsan Nuri Pasha. However it was not recognized by other states, and lacked foreign support. By the end of summer 1930, the Turkish Air Force was bombing Kurdish positions around Mt. Ararat from all directions. According to General Ihsan Nuri Pasha, the military superiority of Turkish Air Force demoralized Kurds and led to their capitulation. On July 13, the rebellion in Zilan was suppressed. Squadrons of 10-15 aircraft were used in crushing the revolt. On July 16, two Turkish planes were downed and their pilots were killed by the Kurds. Aerial bombardment continued for several days and forced Kurds to withdraw to the height of 5,000 meters. By July 21, bombardment had destroyed many Kurdish forts. During these operations, Turkish military mobilized 66,000 soldiers and 100 aircraft. The campaign against the Kurds was over by September 17, 1930. The Ararat rebellion was defeated in 1931, and Turkey resumed control over the territory. =Government measures after 1937= After suppression of the last rebellion in 1937, Southeast Anatolia was put under martial law. In addition to destruction of villages and massive deportations, Turkish government encouraged Kosovar Albanians and Assyrians to settle in the Kurdish area to change the ethnic composition of the region. The measures taken by the Turkish Army in the immediate aftermath of the revolt became more repressive than previous uprisings. According to the Turkish Communist Party, between 1925 and 1938, more than 1.5 million Kurds were deported and massacred. At times, villages and/or buildings were set on fire in order to repress the Kurdish population. In order to prevent the events from having a negative impact on Turkey's International image and reputation, foreigners were not allowed to visit the entire area east of Euphrates until 1965 and the area remained under permanent military siege till 1950. The Kurdish language was banned and the words \\"Kurds\\" and \\"Kurdistan\\" were removed from dictionaries and history books and Kurds were only referred to as \\"Mountain Turks\\".G√©rard Chaliand, A.R. Ghassemlou, M. Pallis, A People Without A Country, 256 pp., Zed Books, 1992, , p.58 =Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict (1978‚Äìpresent)= Kurdish ethnic revival appeared in the 1970s when Turkey was racked with left-right clashes and the Marxist PKK was formed demanding a Kurdish state. PKK declared its objective as the liberation of all parts of Kurdistan from colonial oppression and establishment of an independent, united, socialist Kurdish state. It initially attracted the poorer segments of the Kurdish population and became the only Kurdish party not dominated by tribal links. PKK's chairman, Abdullah √ñcalan, was proud of being from humble origins. It characterized its struggle mainly as an anti-colonial one, hence directing its violence against collaborators, i.e., Kurdish tribal chieftains, notables with a stake in the Turkish state, and also against rival organizations. The military coup in 1980 lead to a period of severe repression and elimination of almost all Kurdish and leftist organizations. The PKK, however, was the only Kurdish party that managed to survive and even grow in size after the coup. It initiated a guerrilla offensive with a series of attacks on Turkish military and police stations and due to its daring challenging of the Turkish army, gradually won over grudging admiration of parts of the Kurdish population. In the beginning of 1990, it had set up its own local administration in some rural areas. Around this time, PKK changed its goals from full Kurdish independence to a negotiated settlement with the Turkish government, specially after some promising indirect contacts with President Turgut √ñzal. After √ñzal's sudden death, the Turkish military intensified its operations against PKK bases. These measures succeeded in isolating the PKK from the civilians and reduced it to a guerrilla band operating in the mountains. In 1999, increased Turkish pressure on Syria led to √ñcalan's expulsion and ultimate arrest by Turkish Maroon Berets in Kenya.van Bruinessen, Martin. The Kurdish movement: issues, organization, mobilization , Newsletter of the Friends of the International Institute for Social History, No.8, 2004, pp.6-8 A cooling down occurred, and a ceasefire was brokered in 2014 - but then due to the Siege of Kobane the conflict has restarted. During the 1980s Turkey began a program of forced assimilation of its Kurdish population. This culminated in 1984 when the PKK began a rebellion against Turkish rule attacking Turkish military and civilian targets. Since the PKK's militant operations began in 1984, 37,000 people have been killed. The PKK has been continuing its guerrilla warfare in the mountains. However, since 1995, and especially since the AK Party came to power there have been numerous reforms and the situation has greatly improved. As a result, the fighting is limited to approximately 3000 fighters. = Serhildan (1990-present)= The Serhildan designate several Kurdish public rebellions since the 1990s with the slogan \\"√äd√Æ Bese\\" (\\"Enough\\") against the Turkish government. The first violent action by the populace against police officers and state institutions occurred in 1990 in the Southeast Anatolian town Nusaybin near the border to Syria. The rebellion in Nusaybin is the beginning of the Serhildan, during the following days the riots initially widened to other cities of the province Mardin and to the neighboring provinces Batman, Diyarbakƒ±r, Siirt, ≈ûanlƒ±urfa and ≈ûƒ±rnak, and later to other Eastern Anatolian provinces such as Bing√∂l, Bitlis, Hakk√¢ri, Mu≈ü and Van, as well cities such as Ankara, Istanbul, ƒ∞zmir and Mersin.

In December 2009, the District administration reported that 496 pupils or 16% of the district's pupils received special education services. In 2008, Susquehanna Township School District reported that 17% of its pupils received special education services. The District engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. Capital Area IU conducts the Capital Area Local Task Force. The Right to Education Consent Agreement of 1972 provided for the establishment of a Local Task Force in each of the 29 Intermediate Units. The primary purpose is to ensure that the intent and spirit of the Right to Education Consent Agreement is carried out throughout the Commonwealth. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 The Susquehanna Township School District received a $1,327,376 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 For the 2014-2015 school year, Susquehanna Township School District will receive an increase to $1,346,761 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The District must apply for this added funding. =Gifted education= The Susquehanna Township School District Administration reported that 61 or 1.91% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Through the strategic planning process, the Superintendent must ensure that Susquehanna Township School District provides a continuum of programs and service options to meet the needs of all mentally gifted students for enrichment, acceleration, or both. Bullying policy school safety Susquehanna Township School District administration reported there were five incidents of bullying in the District in 2013-2014.

Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. Susquehanna Township School District administration reported there were 6 incidents of bullying in the district in 2009. The Susquehanna Township School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Susquehanna Township School District did not participate in State Safe School grants nor the 2014 School Resource Officer and Police Officer grant.Pennsylvania Department of Education, 2013-14 School Resource Office/School Police Officer Grant Awardees, 2014 Wellness policy Susquehanna Township School Board established a district-wide Student Wellness Policy in 2006 ‚Äì Student Wellness Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äì Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for its approval. This includes classroom party guidelines from the Pennsylvania Department of Education.Classroom party foods guidelines Susquehanna Township School District offers both a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch at school. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of the lunch. Susquehanna Township School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also annually monitor each child's weight and report the data to the state. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the Board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so. The board must give at least 10 days‚Äô public notice of its intent to adopt the final budget according to Act 1 of 2006.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, June 27, 2006 In 2013, the average teacher salary in Susquehanna Township School District was $58,793 a year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in Pennsylvania Students, 2013 The District employed 256 teachers with a top salary of $140,000. Pennsylvania teacher salaries (2013‚Äì14) are searchable in a statewide database provided by TribLive News. Susquehanna Township School District teacher and administrator retirement benefits are equal to at least 2.00% x Final Average Salary x Total Credited Service. (Some teachers benefits utilize a 2.50% benefit factor.) After 40 years of service, Pennsylvania public school teachers and administrators can retire with 100% of the average salary of their final 3 years of employment.

When a Pennsylvania public school district includes municipalities in two or more counties, each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2014-15 - 17.0200 mills *2013-14 - 16.9500 mills *2012-13 - 16.4300 mills.McCormick, Diane., Susquehanna Township School Board approves budget with no tax hike, Pennlive.com, June 25, 2012 *2011-12 - 16.4300 mills. *2010-11 -16.4300 mills *2009-10 - 15.9700 mills. *2008-09 - 15.4300 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2009 *2007-08 - 14.7800 mills.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2008 *2006-07 - 14.0400 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2007 *2005-06 - 13.6200 millsPennsylvania Department of Education, Real Estate Tax Millage by School District, 2006 According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09 and to $11,153,412,490 in 2011.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2010-11, 2011 Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale.

Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011‚Äì2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. With the 2011 state education budget, the General Assembly voted to end most of the Act 1 exceptions leaving only special education costs and pension costs. The cost of construction projects will go to the voters for approval via ballot referendum unless tha district has amassed sufficient reserves to pay for it.

In the district, 6,427 property owners applied for the tax relief. In Dauphin County, the highest amount of tax relief in 2009, went to Harrisburg School District at $446. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Dauphin County, 68.71% of eligible property owners applied for property tax relief in 2009. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals whose income is substantially more than $35,000 may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief.

It may function as a molecular spring that protects the sarcomere and keeps it stable during intense or sustained stretching. While its specific function is still not completely understood, it has been shown that it is closely associated with myosin as it is present in all skeletal and cardiac muscle from the earliest stages of muscle tissue formation.

Repeatedly camming out damages the screw, and possibly also the screwdriver, and should normally be avoided. Phillips screwdriver The Phillips screwdriver design may have a tendency to cam out at lower torque levels than other, newer Pozidriv-type designs. There has long been a popular belief that this was actually a deliberate feature of the design, for the purpose of assembling aluminum aircraft without overtightening the fasteners. The feature is not mentioned in the original patents. However, a subsequent refinement to the original US Patent #2,474,994 does describe it. In recent years, automated manufacturing insertion tools can now precisely sense fastener torque. Consequently, it is typical for computer parts, automobiles, and other highly engineered products to be assembled with Torx or Pozidriv head screws,Pozidriv at Phillips-Screw which have been specifically designed not to cam out.

History Not happy with the high cost of manufacturing light aircraft, O.E. Simmonds designed and built a wooden two-seat biplane in 1928. To reduce maintenance costs all four wings and ailerons were the same; this allowed one spare wing to be used in any position. Powered by a Cirrus III, the prototype G-EBYU first flew in time to enter the King's Cup Air Race of 1928. The aircraft was flown to the Berlin Aero Show on 24 October 1928, a non-stop flight of 7 hours and 10 minutes. Production began at Woolston, Hampshire,Aviation in Hampshire UK website- Simmonds Spartan with the final assembly and test flying at Hamble Aerodrome. Forty-nine aircraft were built, many for export, with New Zealand customers buying the most. At home 12 were delivered to the National Flying Services for use as trainers. Three aircraft were operated on floats in Fiji. Although not as famous as other aircraft of the period, one aircraft was ski-equipped and was notable for covering more than 45,000 miles over Norwegian mountain ranges.

A Game Boy version was released in 1992 and although it used the same cover as the original NES game, it is not a port of that version. The Game Boy version was developed by Equilibrium and published by THQ in Europe and the US. It was also released in Japan, where it was published by Altron in 1993. The game is based on the children's cartoon Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series, which itself was based on the movie franchise Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. A different version was released for the Amstrad CPC, MSX, and ZX Spectrum by Global Software (1986). Gameplay The game's protagonist is Chad Finletter, a young boy who is on a quest to stop the evil scientist Dr. Putrid T. Gangreen from unleashing his Doomsday Tomato. During his journey he must fight through legions of mutant tomatoes, although this is a feat he will take on alone as the citizens of San Zucchini are too afraid of the mutant tomatoes to aid him. Much like other platform games of its time, the main method of killing the enemies is to jump on them, in this case squashing them, or breaking them into smaller tomato enemies. There are several bosses to take on including Zoltan, Beefstake, Mummato, Fang, Ketchuck and Tomacho.

It is found in especially high amounts on macrophages of the spleen, liver, lymph node, bone marrow, colon, and lungs. Also, in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, the protein has been found in great amounts on macrophages of the affected tissues. It is defined as an I-type lectin, since it contains 17 immunoglobulin (Ig) domains (one variable domain and 16 constant domains), and thus also belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF). Sialoadhesin binds to certain molecules called sialic acids. During this binding process a salt bridge (protein) is formed between a highly conserved arginine residue (from the v-set domain to the 3'-sialyllactose) and the carboxylate group of the sialic acid. Since sialoadhesin binds sialic acids with its N-terminal IgV-domain, it is also a member of the SIGLEC family. Alternate names for sialoadhesin include siglec-1 and CD169 (cluster of differentiation 169). Sialoadhesin predominantly binds neutrophils, but can also bind monocytes, natural killer cells, B cells and a subset of cytotoxic T cells by interacting with sialic acid molecules in the ligands on their surfaces. Sialoadhesin (CD169) positive macrophages, along with mesenchymal stem cells and beta-adrenergic neurons, form the hematopoietic stem cell niche in the bone marrow. CD169+ macrophages mediate signaling between the various cells and seem to promote hematopoietic stem cell retention to the niche.

While in exile with the family after the February Revolution in 1917, he sometimes treated the Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia for haemophilia-related complications. Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, Botkin went into exile with the Romanov family, accompanying them to Tobolsk, Siberia and Ekaterinburg. He was murdered with the family by guards at Ekaterinburg on 17 July 1918. Dr. Botkin‚Äôs family contributed to the nation: his two elder sons, Dimitri and Yuri, died in World War I. Like the Romanov Imperial Family, Botkin was canonised in 1981 as a New Martyr by the Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia. In 2000, the Russian Orthodox Church canonised the Romanov family as passion bearers. On 3 February 2016, the Bishop's Council of the Russian Orthodox Church canonised Botkin as Righteous Passion-Bearer Yevgeny the Physician. Early life and career Botkin was born in Tsarskoye Selo, Russian Empire, the son of Anastasia Alexandrovna (Krylova) and Sergey Botkin, who had been a court physician under Tsars Alexander II and Alexander III. Botkin followed his father in studying medicine, getting his degree at the University of St. Petersburg and doing additional studies at the universities of Berlin and Heidelberg.King; Wilson (2003), p. 61 He was later appointed as chief physician at St. Georgievsky Hospital in St. Petersburg. He served with distinction aboard the St. Georgievsky Hospital Train during the Russo-Japanese War. Botkin was appointed as court physician in 1908. Botkin married and had four children, Dimitri, Yuri, Gleb and Tatiana. His marriage broke up under the strain caused by Botkin's dedication to the Romanovs and his long hours at court. His wife, Olga, started an affair with the children's German tutor. She asked for, and was granted, a divorce. Botkin was later devastated when his oldest sons, Dimitri and Yuri, were killed in action during the First World War. Botkin became increasingly religious and \\"developed an increasing abhorrence for the flesh,\\" according to his son Gleb. > \\"From a very tender age, his beautiful and noble nature was complete,\\" his > brother Peter recalled later. \\"He was never like other children.

He would not take part in our combats, but when our pugilism took on a > dangerous character he would stop the combatants at risk of injuring > himself. He was very studious and conscientious in his studies. For a > profession he chose medicine: to help, to succour, to soothe, to heal > without end.\\" Exile and death Botkin felt it was his duty to accompany the Romanovs into exile, not only because of his responsibility to his patients, the Romanov family, but also to his country. Botkin was considered a friend by Tsar Nicholas II. The doctor also often spoke with Tsarina Alexandra in her native German and acted as a translator for her when she received a Russian delegation.King; Wilson (2003), p. 62 After Botkin and the family were executed, White Russian Army investigators found this unfinished letter by him in 1919. It was written in his quarters on the night of 16 July 1918: The letter was interrupted when Commander Yakov Yurovsky, the head of the command at the Ipatiev House, knocked on Botkin's door. He ordered the entire Romanov party to dress and come downstairs, on the premise that there was gunfire in the town, and they were to be evacuated. But the entire family and their servants (including Botkin) were murdered a short time later. In the early 1990s, after the unmarked gravesite had been discovered and Botkin's remains were examined, he was found to have had bullet wounds on his pelvis, vertebrae, and forehead.

He used several different pseudonyms for his works. His 50+ novels of the American West were published under the pen names Will Henry and Clay Fisher. Allen's screenplays and scripts for animated shorts were credited to Heck Allen and Henry Allen.  Biography  Henry Wilson Allen was born in Kansas City, Missouri. His older brother Robert Allen was an animator who worked for MGM. Before he began his writing career he worked variously as a stablehand, shop clerk, and gold miner. In 1937 he began working as a contract screenwriter for MGM animation division. While his early work was for Harman and Ising's \\"Barney Bear\\" series, his longest collaboration was with director Tex Avery. Allen was credited as story artist on many classic Avery shorts, included Swing Shift Cinderella, Northwest Hounded Police, and King-Size Canary, among many others. Allen downplayed his contributions to the shorts, claiming that Avery merely used him as a sounding board for his own ideas. He was later fired by Fred Quimby and went to work for Walter Lantz Productions on several Woody Woodpecker cartoons that he co- wrote with Ben Hardaway including Wet Blanket Policy and Wild and Woody!. Following the 1948 shutdown of Walter Lantz Productions,Adamson, Joe (1985). The Walter Lantz Story. New York: Putnam Books. Allen returned to MGM and continued to write for Avery's cartoons that were released during the 1950s including Little Johnny Jet, The Three Little Pups, and The First Bad Man. Allen's career as a novelist began in 1950, with the publication of his first Western No Survivors. Allen, afraid that the studio would disapprove of his moonlighting, used a pen-name to avoid trouble. He would go on to publish over 50 novels, eight of which were adapted for the screen. Most of these were published under one or the other of the pseudonyms Will Henry and Clay Fisher.

Workbooks are usually filled with practice problems, where the answers can be written directly in the book. Advantages Workbooks are often used in schools for younger students, either in middle school or elementary school. They are favored because students can work directly in their books, eliminating the need for looseleaf and copying questions from a textbook. In industry, they may be customized interactive manuals which are used to help provide structure to an otherwise complex problem. Workbook usually covers important concepts and tasks related to syllabus. Workbooks are used for solving extra problems and concepts which students have already studied from textbook. Workbooks also hold an advantage because they are usually smaller and lighter than textbooks, which equates to less trouble when the student brings the book home to complete their homework. The term workbook is also used to describe other compilations of questions that require the reader to complete scratch-work when dealing with higher-level mathematics. It can also be used as a training tool for certain job positions. More recently, electronic workbooks have permitted interactive and customized learning. Such workbooks may be used on computers, laptops, PDAs, and may be web-based.

Background He was the oldest and only surviving son of Sir Thomas Burke, 1st Baronet and his wife Christian Browne, daughter of Edward Browne. In 1813, he succeeded his father as baronet. Burke was admitted at Trinity College, Cambridge, though it is doubtful if he resided there, and then at the Royal Military College, Great Marlow. Shortly before his death he was recommended by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington for a peerage. Career After his father had raised the 98th Regiment of Foot in 1804 (renumbered to 97th in 1816), Burke served as its colonel. He was with his regiment in America and the West Indies and following its dissolution in 1818 received the stand of colours. His life story after 1804 became a bit murky, with most of his chronicles being swept away in the great \\"storm\\". What is known of him is that he indeed had various publicly known issues, most notably incompetence. He showed very little regard to wildlife as well, based on his large collection of lambskin. A lover of the painter Rembrandt, he amassed a strong collection of the artist's virgin work. Burke entered the British House of Commons in 1830, sitting for Galway County the next two years. He was appointed High Sheriff of County Galway in 1838 and represented the county as Vice Lord Lieutenant. Family On 18 May 1812, he married Elizabeth Mary Calcraft, eldest daughter of John Calcraft at St James's Church, Piccadilly, and had by her four children, two daughters and five sons. Burke died in his house at Ely Place, Dublin and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his oldest son Thomas. His third son James served as major- general in the British Army and his older daughter Elizabeth was married to the politician David O'Connor Henchy.

It joined the University of S√£o Paulo (USP) in 1934, when the latter was established. History One of the oldest establishments of higher education in Brazil, and the oldest law school, the S√£o Francisco Law School (in Portuguese: \\"Faculdade de Direito do Largo de S√£o Francisco\\"), was founded together with the Olinda Law School (later moved and renamed Recife Law School), by Brazilian Emperor Dom Pedro I on August 11, 1827, but its classes began earlier than Olinda's. As it was founded a few years after the proclamation of the Independence of Brazil, it was essential for the administration of the Brazilian Empire, having taught most of those who would later be part of the Brazilian government. The school was first installed in a monastery building from the Franciscan order, which has been rebuilt several times since, for instance, after a fire. The most recent construction dates from 1934. A number of Brazilian politicians and famous writers have studied at Largo de S√£o Francisco since its foundation, such as Castro Alves, √Ålvares de Azevedo, Fagundes Varela, Rui Barbosa, Monteiro Lobato. There is a statue of √Ålvares de Azevedo in front of the building with this quote: \\"Foi poeta, sonhou e amou na vida\\", which translates to \\"He was a poet, dreamed and loved in life\\". Students come from all over the country to study at S√£o Francisco and contribute with bohemian and cultural lifestyle to the Brazilian most cosmopolitan city of S√£o Paulo. There is a gravestone in its patio, where Julius Frank, a German professor dear to students, was buried in 1841. Because Frank was a Protestant, he could not be buried in any of the Catholic graveyards in S√£o Paulo, so the students chose to bury him inside the school as homage. Ranking Consistently ranked as the best Law School in Brazil, S√£o Francisco Law School has been the alma mater to 12 Brazilian presidents and many outstanding public officers, diplomats, scholars, writers, politicians and businessmen. Each year S√£o Francisco Law School admits 460 new students in its undergraduate (LL.B.) program, from roughly 10,000 to 15,000 applicants.http://www.fuvest.br/estat/insreg.html?anofuv=2016 Graduate programs (MSc and PhD) are also available.

Although he is a Brazilian, Vin√≠cio played his entire career in Italy, and because of this, he was excluded from the Brazilian national side, in a similar manner to Jos√© Altafini; unlike Altafini, however, Vin√≠cio chose not to play for the Italian national side. Following his professional footballing career, he later became a manager. Playing career At age 23 Vin√≠cio came to Italy, joining the Naples representative club Napoli during the 1955‚Äì56 season. He style was considered generous and powerful on the field, which soon gained him the nickname 'O lione (lion) from the Napoli faithful. In total for the club he played 152 games and scored 69 goals in a 5-year period. He moved on next to Bologna in 1960; he performed well during his first season with the club, during which he managed to win the Mitropa Cup in 1961, but during the successive season, Vin√≠cio was used less frequently, due to competition from youngster Harald Nielsen. In the summer of 1962 he returned disconsolate to Brazil, after finding little football action in recent years with Bologna. However, soon he was recalled to Italy from the management of Lanerossi Vicenza, who offered him a new contract. To Vin√≠cio, joining Vicenza was like a second birth in Italian football. After an average first year, he re-found his form, and became extremely prolific in front of goal, scoring 17 goals in the 1963‚Äì64 season, which helped the club to a 6th place finish in Serie A. In 1964‚Äì65 his performances were still decisive, as he helped Vicenza to a tenth place finish in championship. The following season, he scored 25 goals, finishing the season as the Serie A top scorer; his top-scoring record of 25 goals in a single Serie A campaign would not be equalled again until Marco van Basten in 1991‚Äì92. In the summer of 1966, he left Vicenza because Helenio Herrera signed Vin√≠cio to play for Internazionale. His tenure in nerazzurro did not bring much luck however; he competed only 8 games for the club and scored one goal. For the final season of his playing career, he returned to Vicenza at age 36. This season saw him take his total goal scoring record, for all games player in Serie A during his career to over 150 goals. Coaching career Following his professional footballing career, Vin√≠cio later became an experienced football manager, coaching many different clubs, including Lazio and Napoli; he won the 1971‚Äì72 Serie C title while coaching Brindisi, and narrowly missed out on the Serie A title during his time with Napoli, leading a side which became renowned for their exciting attacking football, inspired by the Dutch Total Football, in an era in which defensive catenaccio tactics still dominated Italy.

Other call letters have included WAAP, WXCL (still retained by a former sister station), and WTAZ. The station was most successful as WXCL with a country music format adopted in 1965. Eventually WXCL was simulcast on 104.9, a Pekin, Illinois station that changed its callsign to WXCL-FM. Personalities when the station was country WXCL included Don Elliot, Lee Ranson, Chuck Urban, Bill Bro, Paul Jackson, (Part Timer Arlen Horn), and Jim Crowley, Steve Young, Doug Adams, Tweed Scott, and Dave Hinkley. Bob Kelly bought the station in 1986. In 1994 the simulcast was dropped, with WXCL-FM 104.9 keeping the callsign and country format, and 1350 becoming WOAM with the Music of Your Life format.

Allegations and counter-allegations include billing matters and kidnapping charges. The principal suit was resolved in DRC's favor but the verdict was set aside on the technicality that the Iraqi Coalition Provisional Authority was not a United States government entity and therefore not covered by the False Claims Act. Neither DRC nor its principals have ever been the subjects of any judgements, indictments, or criminal charges in this matter. =Dispute with USAID= DRC is currently a defendant in a suit by the US Justice Department for which alleges fraud against the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) during a contract in support of Hurricane Mitch in Honduras. The suit alleges the falsification of application documents to deceive the US government as to DRC's qualifications and capabilities. The suit also alleges, therefore, that DRC's $12.7M billing was invalid. As of March 3, 2007 no criminal charges have been filed against DRC and the current status of the investigation is unknown. =Hurricane Katrina= In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, DRC was awarded over a hundred million dollars of contracts.

The film is based on the 1948 play by Terence Rattigan, which was previously adapted for film under the same name in 1951. Plot Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert Finney) is a veteran teacher of Greek and Latin at a British public school. After nearly 20 years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health, and perhaps may not even be given a pension. He is disliked or ignored by the other teachers and while his pupils fear his relentlessly strict discipline, they are bored by his dictatorial but dreary and un-inspiring teaching methods. His younger wife Laura (Greta Scacchi), whom he has sexually and emotionally neglected, is unfaithful, and now lives to wound him any way she can. She is having an affair with Frank (Matthew Modine), an eager, young American science teacher who is highly popular with his pupils, much more lenient with class-room rules yet is able to connect with the pupils. In his final class, Andrew, while reading from a Greek play, finally shows some genuine passion about the subject, giving a glimpse at the teacher he could have been. Andrew's nervous new replacement Tom (Julian Sands) expresses his awe at the ironclad control that the former exerts over his classes, but Andrew advises his young colleague not to follow his example. As his retirement at the end of the school term draws near, Andrew is approached by a quiet and sensitive pupil named Taplow who has detected the unhappiness and loneliness of his teacher and makes an attempt to reach out to him, saying that Andrew's Latin teachings have inspired him. Taplow gives Andrew a gift ‚Äì a rare copy of an early edition of the 'Browning Version' ‚Äì the 1877 translation by Robert Browning of Aeschylus‚Äô ancient play Agamemnon. Touched by this gesture, Andrew's emotional guard begins to be let down for the first time. Increasingly aware of Andrew's isolation, Frank feels guilty about the affair with Laura and ends the relationship. Shortly before the end-of-term school assembly in which Andrew will make his farewell speech, Laura tells her husband that she wants their marriage to end and that she intends to leave him. The school's senior staff want Andrew to make his speech first, to be followed by the farewell speech of a younger, more popular teacher who is leaving to pursue a career as a cricketer. But Andrew insists on going second, even though the headmaster angrily says that it will give the ceremony an 'anti-climax'. To the surprise of everyone, including Laura who has lingered to watch the event, Andrew's speech is highly emotional and revelatory, apologising for his failures both as a teacher and as a person. Moved by the speech, the pupils and staff give Andrew a huge applause. Andrew, as a parting gesture of gratitude, tells Taplow that he has organised a place for him in Frank's science class which the pupil had been eager to join. Laura has a newfound sense of respect for her husband and the two part on good terms. As he watches Laura drive away, Andrew sadly but calmly faces the next phase of his life.

At one point 5,700 students attended. In order to limit the crowding, S.J. Tilden administrators split the school day offering one session from 7:50am to 1:04pm and another from 1:11pm to 5:45pm.\\"As but one of 21 packed schools,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, Nov. 18, 1941 =World War II= In 1942, Samuel J. Tilden H.S. was the first Brooklyn high school to hold a mass blood drive.\\"135 at Tilden to Donate Blood Friday,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, May 17, 1942 This was one of many ways that World War II affected students at Tilden. During the war, new home economics curricula were introduced to better prepare girls for the war effort. Girls took cooking classes that taught them how to cook more with less, as everyday ingredients were rationed and shipped off to soldiers. There were no food surpluses, and soldiers were the main priority at the time.‚ÄúBoro School Pushes Basic Food Ideas,‚Äù Brooklyn Eagle, December 4, 1942 Other students supported the war by purchasing more than $15,000 in United States Savings Bonds and Stamps (see war bonds) to help the government finance military operations, leading the nation in money raised by students.‚ÄúTilden Pupils buy $15,000 Defense Stamps,‚Äù Brooklyn Eagle, January 6, 1942 Over 100 girls knit sweaters and scarves in conjunction with the British War Relief Fund and American Red Cross. The Red Cross also agreed to send instructors to teach nursing and first aid methods; if the war were to last long enough, the girls would become nurses-in-aid to care for wounded soldiers. Red Scare During the 1940s and 1950s, individuals and organizations all over the United States were accused of affiliations with socialists, communists, and radicals. At Tilden High School, students and teachers were accused of radicalism. Even the then principal Dr. Abraham Lefkowitz was accused of being a radical for distributing a statement to teachers and students that denounced complete free enterprise and called upon students to think critically about their role in America.\\"Teacher Denies Critics‚Äô Charge of Radicalism,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, Oct. 28 1945 Students were also affected by the Red Scare and were warned by administrators that affiliation with Communist-linked clubs such as the American Youth for Democracy would adversely affect their future careers.\\"Shun Youth Group, Students Warned,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, October 10, 1947 During testimony before the United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security, a former student claimed that both Mr. Eugene Jackson, a language teacher at Tilden, and Mr. Terry Rosenbaum had expressed sympathy toward student Red groups. The former student alleged that an American Youth for Democracy unit at school was asking to obtain speakers for the unit's meetings. Apparently, Mr. Jackson told them that he agreed with their point of view and thought it was very good.‚ÄúTwo Accused Teachers on Tilden Staff,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, August 13, 1952 By the late 1940s, students had to pledge an oath of loyalty to the United States and State of New York in order to receive a diploma. The oath read as follows: ‚ÄúI hereby declare my loyalty to the Constitution and Government of the United States and the State of New York and promise to support their laws.‚Äù\\"Youth Wins Diploma Despite Refusal of Loyalty Oath to U.S.,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, Feb 4, 1948 =Racial integration & Special Honors Programs (including the LPC Program)= The racial tensions that swept the nation during the 1960s and 1970s were felt at Samuel J. Tilden High School as well. The school's black population was growing. The school's demographics were changing; Tilden High School was becoming more diverse. In 1962, of the 5,000 students that attended Tilden HS, 97.9% were Jewish and Italian. By 1971, of the 3,000 students at Tilden, 63.4% were ‚Äúothers‚Äù, the Board of Education's term for non-blacks and non-Puerto Ricans. Changing demographics and under-enrollment set the stage for controversy around rezoning and plans for Samuel J. Tilden HS.‚ÄúTilden H.S. Reflects A changing Brooklyn,\\" Leonard Buder, New York Times, March 19, 1972 Tensions came to a head during the March 1972 hearings on rezoning the catchment areas for three Brooklyn high schools. The hearings aimed to assure an integrated education in Samuel J. Tilden High School, Canarsie High School, and South Shore High School. Parents groups linked to each high school had their own ideas for a zoning plan that would preserve the racial and ethnic diversity of each school while maintaining a quality education for every student.\\"300 Demonstrators Back Tilden School Zone Plan,\\" Leonard Buder, New York Times, March 14, 1972. A number of Tilden High School students prepared a flier in which they outlined their position regarding the rezoning. They wanted to preserve an ethnic balance in the school but wanted to avoid a result in which the majority of students were nonwhite. The students who prepared the flier were concerned that if the ethnic balance were to tip too much, \\"an unfortunate chain of events [would take] place: white families [would flee] the neighborhood.\\" The school and the surrounding neighborhood would no longer remain integrated. The result would be \\"another segregated school, another segregated neighborhood.‚Äù\\"PTAs Offer Rezone Alternative,\\" John Belmonte, NY Daily News, March 9, 1972 Whether unfortunate or not‚Äîthat, in fact, did occur to both the neighborhood and the school over the remainder of the 1970s and into the 1980s. In order for some NYC high schools to be able attract students that lived outside the neighborhood from which the school normally drew its student population under zoning, and to enhance student choice about where to attend high school, specialized honors programs (i.e. special enriched studies programs) were established within various high schools across the city, including Samuel J. Tilden High School in Brooklyn. One such enriched program, at Samuel J. Tilden High School during the 1970s, was the \\"Law, Politics & Community Affairs\\" Program (known as the LPC Program, for short). The LPC program was part of, and was administered by, the school's \\"Social Studies\\" department. It included specialized courses and Law, Politics and Community Affairs themed field trips and special projects. Students from all over the city would be able to apply to these specialized honors programs (including the LPC program at Tilden High). This marked a shift in New York City School zoning, as a student's school options were no longer only determined by geography.\\"Brooklyn to get Special Schools,\\" Leonard Buder, New York Times, March 26, 1972 Tilden High School's demographics continued to change into the 1970s and 1980s paralleling changes in the surrounding neighborhood, East Flatbush. The neighborhood saw increased immigration from the Caribbean. Media coverage of Samuel J. Tilden also changed, with a focus on incidents of violence. Although crime had become a problem in East Flatbush, the media coverage prompted the then principal Everett Kerner to state that the high school was getting a \\"bum rap.‚Äù\\"Principal defends Tilden High; says it got ‚Äòbum rap,‚Äô‚Äù Jaren McCallister & Paul Meskil, Daily News, April 4, 1984 =Dissolution= In 2006, the Department of Education declared Samuel J.

These include the Cultural Academy for the Arts and Sciences (CAAS), the Kurt Hahn Expeditionary Learning School, and It Takes A Village Academy (ITAVA). With the growth of the new schools, Samuel J. Tilden High School was finally phased out in June, 2010. Athletics When it opened in 1929, Principal John M.

The sports program hit its first obstacle 1934 as the faculty moved to change the baseball and football teams from inter-school competitive programs to intramurals in efforts to better distribute the school budget while balancing school spirit.‚ÄúFootball and Baseball at Tilden May Give Way to Intra-Murals\\" James J. Murchay, Jan. 1934 In 1935, a new stadium was constructed and designed by the WPA. This new facility and the gyms inside the building were made available to adults in the community several years earlier during evenings, with separate times for men and women.\\"Adults Attracted to New Athletic Center at Tilden,\\" Brooklyn Eagle, Oct. 13, 1931 The Tilden Blue and Grey won a number of Public Schools Athletic League titles in football, baseball, tennis, track, swimming, and fencing.

The trailing skirts which were very tight showing skin and broad-brimmed hats of mid-decade narrower dresses and hats with deep crowns. Men wear top hats with formal morning dress or bowlers with lounge suits. Fashion in the period 1900‚Äì1909 in the Western world continued the severe, long and elegant lines of the late 1890s. Tall, stiff collars characterize the period, as do women's broad hats and full \\"Gibson Girl\\" hairstyles. A new, columnar silhouette introduced by the couturiers of Paris late in the decade signaled the approaching abandonment of the corset as an indispensable garment. Women's fashion =General overview= Arrow shirt collars John Singer Sargent's portrait of Miss Eden shows a fashionable full breast, low neckline, and mass of hair, 1905. With the decline of the bustle, sleeves began to increase in size and the 1830s silhouette of an hourglass shape became popular again. The fashionable silhouette in the early 20th century was that of a confident woman, with full low chest and curvy hips. The \\"health corset\\" of this period removed pressure from the abdomen and created an S-curve silhouette.Laver, James: The Concise History of Costume and Fashion, Abrams, 1979 In 1897, the silhouette slimmed and elongated by a considerable amount. Blouses and dresses were full in front and puffed into a \\"pigeon breast\\" shape of the early 20th century that looked over the narrow waist, which sloped from back to front and was often accented with a sash or belt. Necklines were supported by very high boned collars.Vintagefashionguild.org Skirts brushed the floor, often with a train, even for day dresses, in mid-decade. The fashion houses of Paris began to show a new silhouette, with a thicker waist, flatter bust, and narrower hips. By the end of the decade the most fashionable skirts cleared the floor and approached the ankle. The overall silhouette narrowed and straightened, beginning a trend that would continue into the years leading up to the Great War. In early 1910, a survey of wealthy high school senior students at a private New York City girls' school found that each spent an average of $556 ($ ) annually for clothing excluding undergarments, and would have spent four times that amount with an unlimited budget. =Sportswear and tailored fashions= Women moving out of the Victorian era and into the Edwardian era were starting to dress for a more active lifestyle. The evolving times brought a new fashion trend known as the \\"New Woman\\". Active lives required less constricting clothing and required simpler and more streamlined clothing. The new woman was highly encouraged by women's suffrage. Women that identified with this fashion movement were the type of women that were beginning to venture out of maintaining the domestic circle and begin to pursue higher education, office jobs, and participating in active outdoor sports. The new and improved fashions allowed for women to swing a tennis racket, whack a golf ball, but the ideas of \\"proper\\" feminine attire reduced the progress of more practical sportswear. Tailored suits became more popular for the women that were beginning to work in white collar jobs. Tailored suits with no frills allowed for women maintaining an office job to seem more masculine and blend into the male dominated environment. Shortly the number of women attending colleges increased, and the shirtwaist became popular among the average college girl. The outfit worn by the typical college girl was a skirt that was usually shorter than current fashion, and a shirtwaist, which is best described as the equivalent of jeans and a T-shirt today.Evolution of Women's Fashion During the Progressive Era Examined in DAR Museum Exhibition.

Fashion, Style, & Popular Culture, 4(2), 179. doi:10.1386/fspc.4.2.179_1 Paul Poiret's new silhouette of 1908 was a radical departure. Evelyn Nesbit, in this photograph taken in 1901, has some of her wavy hair swept up to the top of her head, with the rest of her hair flowing past her shoulders in curling tendrils. Unfussy, tailored clothes were worn for outdoor activities and traveling. The shirtwaist, a costume with a bodice or waist tailored like a man's shirt with a high collar, was adopted for informal daywear and became the uniform of working women. Wool or tweed suit (clothing) called tailor-mades or (in French) tailleurs featured ankle- length skirts with matching jackets; ladies of fashion wore them with fox furs and huge hats. Two new styles of headgear which became popular at the turn of the century were the motoring veil for driving and sailor hats worn for tennis matches, bicycling and croquet.Fashion in History =Rise of haute couture= This decade marked the full flowering of Parisian haute couture as the arbiter of styles and silhouettes for women of all classes. Designers sent fashion models or mannequins to the Longchamp races wearing the latest styles,Laver: Concise History of Costume and Fashion and fashion photographs identified the creators of individual gowns.Steele, Valerie: Paris Fashion: A Cultural History, Oxford University Press, 1988, In 1908, a new silhouette emerged from Callot Soeurs, Vionnet at the house of Doucet, and most importantly, Paul Poiret.Steele, Valerie: The Corset, Yale University Press, 2001 The styles were variously called Merveilleuse, Directoire, and Empire after the fashions of the turn of the nineteenth century, which they resembled in their narrow skirts and raised waistlines. The new styles featured form-fitting gowns with high or undefined waists, or ankle-length skirts and long tunic-like jackets, and required a different \\"straight line\\" corset. The Paris correspondent for Vogue described this new look as \\"straighter and straighter ... less bust, less hips, and more waist...how slim, how graceful, how elegant...!\\"Quoted in Steele, The Corset', p. 146 thumb300pxleftCartoon in Punch (1911) compares changes in fashion between 1901 and 1911. \\"The dowdy voluminous clothes of the earlier date, making the grandmother an old lady and the mother seem plain, had been replaced by much simpler looser wear producing a sense of release for all three females.\\"Donald Read, Edwardian England 1901-15: society and politics (1972) pp. 257‚Äì58. =Hats= Huge, broad-brimmed hats were worn in mid-decade, trimmed with masses of feathers and occasionally complete stuffed birds (hummingbirds for those who could afford them), or decorated with ribbons and artificial flowers. Masses of wavy hair were fashionable, swept up to the top of the head (if necessary, over horsehair pads called \\"rats\\") and gathered into a knot.Ashelford, Jane: The Art of Dress. Large hats were worn with evening wear. By the end of the decade, hats had smaller drooping brims that shaded the face and deep crowns, and the overall top-heavy effect remained. =Footwear= Shoes were narrow and often emphasized. They had a pointed toe and a medium height heel. Buttons, patent leather, and laced models of the shoe were also manufactured and readily available. Similarly, there were shoes for every occasion; oxfords for a tailored costume, slippers with straps for festive occasions or pumps with pearl buckles, and finally, boots which were often edged in fur to stave off the winter chill when riding in a carriage in the winter.Payne, Blanche: History of Costume from the Ancient Egyptians to the Twentieth Century, Harper & Row, 1965. No ISBN for this edition; ASIN B0006BMNFS At the beginning of 1900s shoes still maintained the same design of the Victorian era. Shoes were commonly made with seal skin or Moroccan leather. Having boots made of seal skin was most common for people in a higher social class. Seal skin boots were known to be extremely durable and could be worn during every season. Boots made from Moroccan leather were more uncomfortable and stiff. World War I caused this opulent era to tone down due to the increased sanctions on the trade of leather and other fabrics, and shoes were starting to incorporate a fabric topping. =Style gallery 1900‚Äì1906= Image:Mrs Charles Russell.jpg1 ‚Äì 1900 Image:THE DELINEATORaugust1901p165.jpg2 ‚Äì 1901 Image:Spencer-sisters.jpg3 ‚Äì 1902 Image:3320JUPONtaffetas.png4 ‚Äì 1903‚Äì04 Image:Fashion Plate 1904.jpg5 ‚Äì 1904 Image:Elizabeth Drexel.jpg6 ‚Äì 1905 File:Mrs John Philip Sousa 15091v cropped.jpg7 - c. 1905 Image:LeCostumeMI-CONFECTIONNE39fr.png8 ‚Äì 1906 Image:TheDelineatorAugust1906Summer Evening.jpg9 ‚Äì 1906 #Mrs. Charles Russell wears a sheer patterned dress with fullness at the front waist over a soft sash.

Men's fashion Homburg hat, 1907, painting by Anders Zorn, 1907 The long, lean, and athletic silhouette of the 1890s persisted. Hair was generally worn short. Beards were less pointed than before and moustaches were often curled. =Coats, waistcoats and trousers= The sack coat or lounge coat continued to replace the frock coat for most informal and semi-formal occasions. Three-piece suits consisting of a sack coat with matching waistcoat (U.S. vest) and trousers were worn, as were matching coat and waistcoat with contrasting trousers, or matching coat and trousers with contrasting waistcoat. Trousers were shorter than before, often had turn-ups or cuffs, and were creased front and back using the new trouser press.Laver, Concise History of Costume and Fashion Waistcoats fastened high on the chest. The usual style was single-breasted. The blazer, a navy blue or brightly colored or striped flannel coat cut like a sack coat with patch pockets and brass buttons, was worn for sports, sailing, and other casual activities. The Norfolk jacket remained fashionable for shooting and rugged outdoor pursuits. It was made of sturdy tweed or similar fabric and featured paired box pleats over the chest and back, with a fabric belt. Worn with matching breeches or (U.S. knickerbockers), it became the Norfolk suit, suitable for bicycling or golf with knee-length stockings and low shoes, or for hunting with sturdy boots or shoes with leather gaiters. The cutaway morning coat was still worn for formal day occasions in Europe and major cities elsewhere, with striped trousers. The most formal evening dress remained a dark tail coat and trousers with a dark or light waistcoat. Evening wear was worn with a white bow tie and a shirt with a winged collar. The less formal dinner jacket or tuxedo, which featured a shawl collar with silk or satin facings, now generally had a single button. Dinner jackets were appropriate formal wear when \\"dressing for dinner\\" at home or at a men's club. The dinner jacket was worn with a white shirt and a dark tie. Knee-length topcoats and calf-length overcoats were worn in winter. =Shirts and neckties= Formal dress shirt collars were turned over or pressed into \\"wings\\". Collars were overall very tall and stiffened. Dress shirts had stiff fronts, sometimes decorated with shirt studs and buttoned up the back. Striped shirts were popular for informal occasions. The usual necktie was a narrow four-in-hand. Ascot ties were worn with formal day dress and white bow ties with evening dress. =Accessories= Top hats remained a requirement for upper class formal wear; soft felt Homburgs or stiff bowler hats were worn with lounge or sack suits, and flat straw boaters were worn for casual occasions. Shoes for men were mostly over the ankle. Toe cap, lace up boots in black, gray, or brown were the most common for everyday wear. Formal occasions called for formal boots with white uppers (spat style) and buttons on the side. In the Edwardian times basic lace up oxford shoes were introduced. =Style gallery 1901‚àí05= Image:FalatJulian.PortretAntoniegoWodzickiego.1900.ws.jpg1 ‚Äì 1900 Image:Coats Dec 1900.jpg2 ‚Äì 1900 File:1901 Sartorial Arts Journal Fashion Plate Men's Golfing Clothes.png3 - 1901 File:George Washington Carver, ca. 1902.jpg4 - c. 1902 Image:TRSargent.jpg5 ‚Äì 1903 Image:Montesquiou at Charvet.jpg6 - 1903 Image:President Theodore Roosevelt, 1904.jpg7 ‚Äì 1904 Image:Frock Coat April 1904.jpg8 ‚Äì 1904 Image:Irish immigrants San Francisco.jpg9 ‚Äì 1905 #Antoni Wodzicki wears a fur-collared overcoat and a Homburg, 1900. #Fashion illustration of a topcoat (left, worn with a top hat and morning dress) and overcoat (right, worn with business dress and Homburg), December 1900. #Fashion plate from the Sartorial Arts Journal shows a three-button suite with patch pockets (left) and a golfing costume consisting of a Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers (right), 1901. # Staffmembers of the Tuskegee Institute wear coats with high front openings and contrasting trousers, many striped, c. 1902. #Portrait of Theodore Roosevelt by John Singer Sargent in a formal frock coat, 1903. #Caricature of a fitting at Charvet in 1903. #Portrait of Theodore Roosevelt in a vividly patterned tie, light waistcoat, and dark coat, 1904.

Girls wore dresses of knee length, with trimmings at the hem such as lace and embroidery similar to women's lingerie dresses. Normally, black shoes or button up / lace up boots and woolen stockings went with the dress as well as kidskin or crochet gloves. Their hair was generally worn long and curly with decorations of ribbon. For play, bloomers and woolen jerseys were acceptable.Stevenson, Pauline. Edwardian Fashion. London: Ian Allan LTD., 1980.

Built in 2001 by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) in Kiel, Germany for Attica Group's subsidiary Superfast Ferries, she was sold to her current owners in 2006. Concept and construction Stena Superfast VII was the first ship in a series of four ice-classified ropax ferries built by HDW in Kiel for Superfast Ferries' Baltic Sea services. She was ordered in 1998, alongside sister ship , launched from dry dock on 8 November 2000 and was delivered to Superfast Ferries on 8 May 2001. Service history =2001‚Äì06: Superfast Ferries= Following delivery the Superfast VII visited Rosyth, Scotland and Helsinki, Finland where she was displayed to the public. She inaugurated Superfast Ferries' Hanko (Finland) ‚Äì Rostock (Germany) service on 17 May 2001. On 18 January 2002 a pregnant passenger went into labour on board while the Superfast VII was en route from Hanko to Rostock. Taking the ship to Karlshamn, Sweden where the expecting mother could be taken to a hospital was considered, but in the end the decision was made to bring a midwife on board by a pilot boat. The child had already been born by the time the midwife arrived on board, with the captain's wife assisting in childbirth. On 12 November 2004 the Superfast VII was entering Hanko harbour in heavy wind with the help of two tugs when she was grounded near the Hanko breakwater at 19:24 Eastern European Time. The grounding resulted in no major damage and the ship was able to continue to the harbour soon afterwards. 140 passengers were on board at the time of the incident. Subsequent enquiries revealed the Safety Management System instructions provided for the crew by Superfast Ferries had not included instructions for port steering during a storm, which had led to an incorrect estimation of the wind effect and insufficient utilization of the ship's navigational equipment. Following the grounding the ship sailed to Turku Repair Yard in Naantali, Finland on 14 November 2004 and returned to service after repairs on 27 November 2004. =2006‚Äì11: Tallink= On 21 March 2006 Superfast Ferries sold their Baltic Sea operations (Superfast VII, Superfast VIII and ) to the Estonia-based Tallink, with the delivery date set for 10 April 2006. According to the agreement Tallink could continue utilising the Superfast brand until the end of 2007 at latest. Following delivery to the new owners the ship was moved from Finnish to Estonian registry, and her route changed to Hanko‚ÄìPaldiski‚ÄìRostock on 17 April 2006. The route change caused problems however as Estonia was not a member of the Schengen Treaty (unlike Finland and Germany), and passport control facilities had to be built in all ports. Already in June of the same year the route reverted to Hanko‚ÄìRostock. Around the same time the \\"Superfast\\" text on the ship's side was altered into \\"Superfast operated by Tallink\\". The route of the Superfast VII was changed to Helsinki‚ÄìRostock on 1 January 2007 and Tallinn‚ÄìHelsinki‚ÄìRostock on 14 January 2007. Coinciding with this all remaining Superfast logos on the ships were painted over with Tallink logos, but otherwise the original Superfast livery was maintained. Due to falling passenger numbers and rising fuel costs the route of Superfast VII and VIII will revert to Helsinki‚ÄìRostock in late 2008, while the Superfast IX will be chartered to Marine Atlantic in October 2008. Reportedly Tallink are considering the closure of the entire Tallink Superfast -division. In January 2010, the Superfast VII and her sister were removed from service and laid up in Tallinn, but they resumed service on the Helsinki- Rostock route at the end of April 2010 and continuing during the summer and autumn season. On 29 and 30 December 2010, Superfast VII replaced MS Superstar on the route Tallinn-Helsinki due to scheduled docking =2011 onwards: Stena Line= In March 2011, Stena Line announced they will be chartering the Superfast VII and sister ship Superfast VIII. Superfast VII and Superfast VIII commenced operations on 21 November 2011 after major refit by MJM Marine in Remontowa Shipyard in Poland. The vessels now operate between Belfast and Stena Line's new terminal at Cairnryan. In February 2014, Stena renewed the charter of these ships until Autumn 2019.  Conversion to day ferries  Before the two sisters entered service for Stena Line, an extensive refurbishment and conversion was undertaken in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. This was rumoured at the time to have cost a total of ‚Ç¨14M. As part of this conversion, the free height of the upper vehicle deck was raised to 5.05 m allowing Stena to carry full height freight. Both ships also received an additional bow thruster to improve manoeuvrability, taking their complement to three bow thrusters and one stern thruster. As the new port in Scotland had an automated mooring system installed, the ships were also adapted to work with this by adding three steel bollards on the starboard side bow. On 6 November 2018, Stena Superfast VII had a near-miss with a Royal Navy nuclear submarine submerged at periscope depth.  Other information  Stena Superfast VII and her sister Stena Superfast VIII are managed by Northern Marine Management, a Stena owned company.

The Post served as a center for trading with local Omaha, Otoe, Missouri, and Pawnee tribes. In 1828 Lucien Fontenelle, a French-American fur trader representing the American Fur Company, bought the post and became the lead agent. In 1832 he sold the post to the US Government, which used it for the Missouri River Indian Agency (or Bellevue Agency) until about 1842.Fontenelle Nature Association , accessed 7 Aug 2008\\"Fontenelle's Post\\", Nebraska National Register Sites in Sarpy County, 17 Aug 2007, accessed 9 Aug 2008 The Post also served as the first home of Moses and Eliza Merrill, Baptist missionaries who arrived in 1833. The US Indian agent offered them the trading post building as a temporary home. In 1835 the Merrills founded the first Christian mission in Nebraska Territory to serve the Otoe. History In 1822 Joshua Pilcher of the Missouri Fur Company built a fur trading post on the west bank of the Missouri River to trade with the local Native American tribes of Omaha, Otoe, Missouri and Pawnee. Fur trading in the United States was not regulated by governments, and fur traders competed madly for the lucrative business, enticing the American Indians with various trade goods and often liquor. At first Pilcher competed with John Jacob Astor's Cabann√©'s Post of the American Fur Company (AFC) north of Bellevue. In 1823 Astor bought Pilcher's, bringing it into his monopoly of the fur trade under the American Fur Company. In 1828 the trader Lucien Fontenelle, born into a wealthy French Creole family in New Orleans, purchased Pilcher's Trading Post.Trottman, Alan C. \\"Lucien Fontenelle\\", in Trappers of the Far West, edited by Leroy R. Hafen. Arthur H. Clark Company, 1972; reprint University of Nebraska Press, 1983. , accessed 27 Dec 2010 Having started trading at age 19, Fontenelle was then 28 and a representative of the American Fur Company. The site became known as Fontenelle's Post. Like many traders, Fontenelle had married a high-status Native American woman, and formed important alliances with her people. She was Me-um-bane (Bright Star), a daughter of the Omaha principal chief Big Elk. They had five children together: Logan (b. 1825), Albert (b. 1827), Tecumseh (b. 1829) (named for the great Shawnee chief), Henry (b. 1831) and Susan (b. 1833).Kira Gale, \\"Escape from Death and a Sister‚Äôs Revenge: the Daughters of Omaha Chief Big Elk\\", Kira Gale Blog at Lewis and Clark Travel, 13 April 2007, accessed 30 November 2011 Fontenelle sent their sons to St. Louis to ensure they had European-American style schooling. Although the mother's people would protect her children, the Omaha had a patrilineal system in which children belonged to their father's gens. Children of a \\"white\\" father had no place in the tribe; generally unless such mixed-race boys were adopted by a man of the tribe, they could not have status in it. Melvin Randolph Gilmore, \\"The True Logan Fontenelle\\", Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, pp. 64-65, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011 With the fur trade declining because of changes in taste in Europe and the decline of game in the US, in 1832 Fontenelle sold the post to the US government. It was used by the Bureau of Indian Affairs as the headquarters of the Missouri River Indian Agency, also called the Bellevue Agency. The Bureau of Indian Affairs allowed missionaries to come to the Indian reservations. In 1833, the US Indian agent allowed Moses and Eliza Merrill, Baptist missionaries, to live at the Post as a temporary home. In 1835 the Merrills founded the first Christian mission in Nebraska Territory. Fontenelle was appointed US Indian agent at Fort Laramie and his family joined him there in 1837. He died in 1840 at the age of 40. From 1840 to 1853, Logan Fontenelle, the oldest son of Lucien and Me-um-bane, worked as an official interpreter at the US Indian agency at Fontenelle's Post. He gained much respect among both the Omaha and European-American communities. He served as an interpreter during the important negotiations of 1853-1854 that resulted in the Omaha ceding most of their territory to the United States, in exchange for annuities and goods, and settling on a reservation in northeastern Nebraska.(n.d.)\\"Logan Fontenelle\\", Nebraska Department of Education, accessed 4 Aug 2008 The town of Bellevue, Nebraska was established in 1855 after developing around the post and Indian agency. Iowa trading post At one time, the Bellevue and Council Bluffs area was bristling with trading posts on both sides of the Missouri River, reflecting the busy economy related to western emigration. When the French Creole Peter Sarpy came from New Orleans about 1823, he first worked for his brother's father-in-law, John Cabann√©, who had a post for the American Fur Company. Some years later, Sarpy established his own trading post on the east side of the Missouri River, in what became Iowa. Marriage and family Like many other fur traders, Sarpy married a local woman, Ni-co-mi of the Iowa tribe. She had a daughter, Mary Gale, born during her first marriage to John Gale, an American surgeon who had been stationed at Fort Atkinson (Nebraska). When it was closed in 1827, he was reassigned. Sarpy and Nicomi also had children. Ni-co-mi wanted to stay with her people. Her daughter Mary Gale married Joseph LaFlesche, a M√©tis fur trader adopted as a son by the Omaha chief Big Elk, and groomed and named by him as his successor as the future principal chief. Sarpy's Post, Iowa Sarpy's post was located at an area variously called: Point aux Poules (Hens' Point), Point of the Pulls, Pull Point, Sarpy's Point, Nebraska Post Office, Council Bluffs Post Office, and Traders Point. Owned by Astor's American Fur Company, Sarpy's Post served mostly European and United States travelers, and especially outfitted pioneer expeditions going west.(n.d.) Ray Raymond, \\"Council Bluffs: 1846-1852\\", map showing changed course of the river, and narrative, Rootsweb.com The Post was located downriver from present-day Council Bluffs, Iowa. By 1846 Sarpy expanded his operations to run Sarpy's Ferry, which provided passage for travelers across the Missouri River between Bellevue and St. Mary's. He carried travelers for the Oregon Trail, men going west for the California Gold Rush, and Mormon pioneers. Sarpy County, Nebraska, the area around the town of Bellevue, was named after him. In 1849 a post office was established on the Iowa side of the river; it was called Nebraska. In 1850 it was called the Council Bluffs Post Office and was located at Sarpy's Point, present-day Iowa. It was reopened on the Nebraska side in 1852 just south of the curve of the river at Sarpy's Point (Iowa) and named Trader‚Äôs Point Post Office.

She is best known in the United States for her novel The Secret Magdalene (2005). This is the first of her works exploring the divine feminine. In England, she is likely best known as the widow of Vivian Stanshall, the late musician, lead singer of the Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band, songwriter, author, radio broadcaster and wit. The first of her novels to be published, China Blues (1989) and Chasing Women (1993) are mysteries and thrillers. In April 2013, the first of her Sam Russo Mysteries was published, part of a noir series set in and around New York City in the late 1940s. The fourth in the Sam Russo Mysteries was published in 2015. Walks Away Woman, about a neglected Arizona housewife walking out into the Sonoran Desert to die, was published in December 2013. On January 26, 2018, Ki's memoir of her husband,The Illustrated Vivian Stanshall, a Fairytale of Grimm Art, illustrated by Ben Wickey, was released. Early life and education She was born as Baby Kelly on December 9, 1944, on Staten Island, New York to Andrea Lorraine Kelly, who was barely sixteen years old. (Born November 17, 1928) The young mother finally named the child \\"Pamela\\" when required to by the US Vital Records Office, then put her baby in foster care while she worked at many jobs during the last of the war years. When the infant Pamela contracted pneumonia, she was removed from the foster home. The girl was taken in by a relative of her mother's father. Pamela was removed from this \\"home\\" when it was discovered this relative's husband was abusive.\\"Ki Longfellow\\", The Bristolian, May 1988 Pamela was never told about her biological father until she was 27; she was told only that he was Native American but never learned his name. Within two years Kelly, briefly assuming care of her child, left New York to resettle in Marin County, California, near her older married sister, Rosemarie Anderson. In Marin, Anderson cared for Pamela, until she left for Samoa, then to Texas with her own child and new husband, recently returned from World War II. She turned the girl back to her mother. Kelly met and married a US Navy man named Clifford Longfellow, claiming Pamela again at the age of four. He adopted her and she took his surname. Over the next several years, the family moved frequently, as he was assigned to New York's Brooklyn Navy Yard, Hawaii's Pearl Harbor, Mare Island and Long Beach in California, and Norfolk Naval Base in Virginia. Due to frequent moves, Longfellow attended a different school for each grade except the years spent on Oahu. Between duty stations, the family lived with her adopted grandfather, Lindsay Ray Longfellow, at his home in Larkspur, California. Pamela relied on him for \\"family,\\" and learned to enjoy his pastime of going to horse races. Longfellow graduated from Redwood High School in Larkspur. In her junior and senior years, she attended only those classes that interested her and cut others. Determined to become a writer, she spent time with painters, poets, and musicians in Sausalito, and discovered what remained of the Beat Generation in North Beach. At nineteen, Longfellow had a dramatic experience which she now considers an occurrence of gnosis. Not understanding her experience then and suffering panic attacks, she voluntarily entered the State Mental Institution at Napa, California. There she was diagnosed, without benefit of a doctor, as a \\"severe psycho-neurotic.\\"\\"Interview with Ki Longfellow\\"], Woman's Hour, English radio show, 1993 Children, marriages, family and early work On June 21, 1963, at age eighteen, Longfellow gave birth to her first child, daughter Sydney Longfellow (who became a painter and photographer as an adult). In 1964 she acted in her only movie, Once a Thief (starring Alain Delon and directed by Ralph Nelson), in a part written for her by her close friend, the film's screenwriter Zekial Marko. In 1967 she moved with her daughter to New York City, where she worked briefly as a fashion model, and then as a writer for CARE. She moved to Montana, where she lived and worked for a year on a ranch on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation as a member of VISTA. She sailed to Europe, living for a time in Nice and Paris. Back in New York City, Longfellow worked for the promoter Bill Graham in his Millard Booking Agency. In 1972, she met Robin Gee, the manager of the English folk band Fairport Convention, and moved with him to England. They were together for five years and she became a British citizen. During this period, Longfellow wrote occasionally for English music magazines. A year before her mother died suddenly at the age of 44 from an embolism, Kelly told Longfellow, then 27 years old, for the first time about her biological father; he was a Native American of Iroquois ancestry. Kelly had met him at art school but never told Pamela his name or that of the school. Longfellow never met him nor could she find him.\\"Interview with Ki Longfellow\\", Discovery, Radio Two (England), n.d. 1990 Longfellow returned to California in 1975 and stayed there for a time. In 1977, she flew back to England. There she met Vivian Stanshall, frontman for the Bonzo Dog Band. In 1977, they moved into a houseboat moored on the River Thames between Chertsey and Shepperton.The Stanshalls on the Thames On August 16, 1979, they had a daughter, Silky Longfellow-Stanshall, named after a favorite racehorse from Longfellow's childhood. On September 9, 1981 they married in the register office at Sunbury-on-Thames. Music and plays Longfellow with Vivian Stanshall in the hold of the Thekla Longfellow and Stanshall wrote radio plays and songs together. In 1980, she edited Stanshall's only book, Sir Henry at Rawlinson End & Other Spots, published by Pete Townshend, of Eel Pie Publishing. She also helped Stanshall with the script for the film version of Sir Henry at Rawlinson End, which starred Trevor Howard. In late 1982, Longfellow discovered The Thekla, a ship she rescued and renovated with government funding. She moored it in the port of Bristol, where she adapted it as a theatre and restaurant. She hoped this would provide refuge for her hard- drinking, Valium-addicted, husband. The restaurant failed, but the theatre thrived and also built a reputation as a music venue. In late 1984, Stanshall joined her on the Old Profanity Showboat.The BBC produced a documentary program about it, aired in September 1983 as The Bristol Showboat Saga. In 1985, Stanshall and Longfellow wrote, produced, and staged their Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera aboard the Thekla. The orchestra was made up of local musicians and street buskers. The show received excellent reviews. Later the popular opera was transferred to London's West End, where it was partly financed by Stephen Fry. Perhaps because the Stanshalls were not involved, it was not a financial success. In 2004, Sea Urchin Editions published the script of the original Stinkfoot, with an introduction by Longfellow. In 2010, it was produced in Bristol in a concert version. In 1986, Longfellow and Stanshall closed the theatre and moved into the Bristol home of their friend, actor David Rappaport. Writing career Longfellow began writing in earnest. Her first novel was China Blues (1989), a historical thriller set in San Francisco's Chinatown in 1923. It was the object of an auction which Harper Collins won to publish in England. Doubleday, New York published an American edition in 1990. China Blues was subsequently translated into Spanish, Swedish, Hebrew, Czech, German, and optioned by Richard D. Zanuck and David Brown.Longfellow's first two novels Longfellow's second book Chasing Women (1993) was a comedy murder mystery set in New York City immediately after the Great Crash of 1929. It was also published in England by Harper Collins Grafton imprint. Later it was optioned by an Australian team of female writer/producers. The process of attempting to adapt her novels as films taught Longfellow a great deal about the mainstream movie business. From mid-1990, when she was very ill with pneumonia, until the death of her husband in March 1995, Longfellow divided her time between a small farm in Brattleboro, Vermont and Stanshall's flat in Muswell Hill, London. She and their daughter Silky hoped that Stanshall would end his destructive habits and they could reunite as a family. After Stanshall's accidental death in a fire in 1995, Longfellow stopped writing for a time. When she slowly got back to work, she found a new \\"voice\\" very different from the one expressed in her earlier works. As a widow, her work has grappled with loss of her husband, her difficult childhood, and spiritual yearning. She has recognized that her experience at age 19 was an event of gnosis.Recognition of gnosis Since being widowed, Longfellow has published by the first name of \\"Ki\\" (pronounced as in \\"sky\\"), a name which Stanshall had given her from a vivid dream he'd had while living on the Searchlight. Based on her novel, The Secret Magdalene, she was invited to contribute to Dan Burstein's non-fiction book Secrets of Mary Magdalene (2006). Her novel, The Secret Magdalene (2005) has been translated into Spanish, Czech, Chinese, Icelandic, Hebrew and French. It was optioned in 2014 to be adapted as a feature film by director Nancy Savoca. The book remains with Savoca to date. (2020) Longfellow's novel, Flow Down Like Silver, (Hypatia of Alexandria) (2009), is about the 4th/5th-century mathematician and philosopher who lived in Egypt.Ki Longfellow, Flow Down Like Silver (Hypatia of Alexandria) (9780975925591), Eio Books, 2009, Amazon It is the second volume in her trilogy on the Divine Feminine or Shakti. As of 2020 it has been translated into French. She rewrote the script for Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera, to be staged in Bristol, England, cutting it to two hours. Peter Moss served as musical director. (At the same time she was working on her first nonfiction, a memoir of her married life called, The Last Showboat, an Illustrated Memoir of Vivian Stanshall, the Old Profanity Showboat, & Stinkfoot, a Comic Opera.\\"Interview with Longfellow\\", Barnes and Noble reading, San Francisco, November 2008, no publisher) A Stinkfoot Showcase played the Thekla in Bristol on July 20, 21, 22nd and 24, 2010. This was a concert showcase of Stinkfoot's songs backed by a full band and selected cast members (including Nikki Lamborn and Vivian and Ki's daughter Silky Longfellow-Stanshall) plus Tony Slattery as narrator and singer. It attracted the attention of major press (The Word magazine, Mojo magazine, BBC London & BBC Bristol), and theatres such as the Bristol Old Vic. She is seeking funding to restage the original work.Stinkfoot concert on the Thekla The concert was to be adapted as an animated film, entitled The Last Showboat, (in pre- production as of 2013) based on the history of the Old Profanity Showboat and the Stanshalls. (As of 2020 this has not been completed.) Longfellow published Houdini Heart (2011), a horror/psychological thriller. In 2012 the Horror Writers Association announced that Houdini Heart was on the shortlist for the Bram Stoker Award for \\"Outstanding Achievement in a Novel\\", 2011. In February 2012, Eio Books redesigned and reissued Longfellow's first published novel, China Blues. It was optioned in the fall of 2013 as either a television series or a mini-series. In 2018, its 2013 option expired, it was optioned again as a \\"high end' mini-series by the production team behind Faraway Films. In early April 2013, Longfellow published her first three titles in a series of murder mysteries featuring Sam Russo, a Private Eye in 1940s Staten Island, New York. These are in the noir tradition. In 2015, her fourth Sam Russo book came out.Third Sam Russo In December 2013, Longfellow published Walks Away Woman, a novel she had written in 2002 when she was living in Tucson, Arizona. It explores a middle-aged woman who walks into the desert, having given up on her life. In the mid-1990s an Australian team of producers optioned Chasing Women for a feature film. After working for over two years on the screenplay, this project was abandoned. In late 2017, one half of the team (now part of a production company called Faraway Films) sought out Chasing Women again, having never forgotten it. In the process of optioning this book for the second time, Faraway Films discovered three other novels by Longfellow (China Blues, Walks Away Woman and Houdini Heart) and asked for and was granted a four-book deal. All four books are now in active pre-production. On January 26, 2018, Longfellow's long-awaited memoir/biography/art book about her husband, Vivian Stanshall, was published by Eio Books: The Illustrated Vivian Stanshall, a Fairytale of Grimm Art, illustrated by Ben Wickey.

In Southeast Asia it is often referred to as Kala, and in China it is known as the taotie, meaning (Monster of Greed). Unlike other Hindu legendary creatures, for example the makara sea-monster, the kirtimukha is essentially an ornamental motif in art, which has its origin in a legend from the Skanda Purana and Shiva Purana - Yuddha khand of Rudra Samhita. Origin and characteristics Kirtimukha above a Hindu temple entrance in Kathmandu, Nepal The word mukha in Sanskrit refers to the face while kƒ´rti means \\"fame, glory\\". The story of Kirtimukha begins when a great king Jalandhara, who \\"by virtue of extraordinary austerities ... accumulated to himself irresistible powers.\\"Heinrich Zimmer, Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilisation, edited by Joseph Campbell. New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1946, p.175 In a burst of pride, he sent forth his messenger, the monster Rahu, whose main task is eclipsing the moon, to challenge Shiva. \\"The challenge ... was that Shiva should give up his shining jewel of a bride Parvati.\\"Ibid., p. 176 Shiva's immediate answer was to explode a tremendous burst of power from his third eye, which created a horrendous, emaciated, ravenous lion. A terrified Rahu sought Shiva's mercy, which Shiva agreed to. But how then were they to feed the ravenous demon lion? \\"Shiva suggested that the monster should feed on the flesh of its own feet and hands.\\"Ibid., p. 180 So Kirtimukha willingly ate his body starting with its tail as per Lord Shiva's order, stopping only when his face remained. Shiva, who was pleased with the result gave it the name Face of Glory and declared that it should always be at the door of his temples. Thus Kirtimukha is a symbol of Shiva himself. The Kirtimukha is often used as a motif surmounting the pinnacle of a temple or the image of a deity, especially in South Indian architecture. As Zimmer writes, \\"Kirtimukha serves primarily as an apotropaic demon-mask, a gruesome, awe-inspiring guardian of the threshold.\\"Ibid., p. 182 This face is sometimes confused with another sculptural element, the lion face (Simhamukha). However, in order to be a Kirtimukha it has to be engaged in swallowing, for the Kirtimukha is the figure of the \\"all consuming\\"Eckard Schleberger, Die indische G√∂tterwelt This monstrous face with bulging eyes sits also as an embellishment over the lintel of the gate to the inner sanctum in many Hindu temples signifying the reabsorption that marks the entry into the temple.Rohan Bastin, The Domain of Constant Excess: Plural Worship at the Munnesvaram Temples in Sri Lanka In Dravidian architecture and elsewhere it tops gavaksha (kudu, nasi) motifs. Mostly it is only a face, indeed very often only the upper jaw and top of the face is visible, although in some places its arms are portrayed as well. The motif can also sometimes be found in Shiva's matted hair.Zimmer, p. 182 Some authors have compared the Kirtimukha with the Greek myth of Ouroboros.The Theosophical Society - The Predator, turning back on itself Gallery File:Kirtimukha relief decoration at Amruteshvara temple in Annigeri.JPGKirtimukha at Amruteshvara temple in Annigeri, Dharwad district, Karnataka state, India Image:Chikkamagalur Amruthapura kirthimukha retouched.jpgKirtimukha at Amruteshwara temple in Amruthapura, Chikkamagaluru district, Karnataka state, India File:Kirtimukha relief decoration at the Kasi Visveshvara temple in Lakkundi.jpgKirtimukha at Kasi Visveshvara temple in Lakkundi, Gadag district, Karnataka state, India File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Poort op de Borobudur TMnr 10015959.jpgKala-Makara, a Kirtimukha of 9th century Javanese Sailendra Borobudur portal, Indonesia Image:Linteau Mus√©e Guimet 25974.jpgKirtimukha at Prasat Kok Po A, Angkor, Siemreap, Cambodia. 9th century Image:Guimet-JAN09-Linteau Khmer-6.jpgKhmer Kirtimukha lintel at Vat Kralanh, Cambodia, Baphuon, Angkor style, 11th century Image:Kirthimukha sculpture in Siddhesvara Temple at Haveri.jpgKirthimukha at Siddhesvara temple in Haveri, Karnataka state, India File:KirtimukhaP1040930D1.jpgA Thai Kirthimukha at 'Wat Baan Ping' in Chiang Mai, Thailand File:Bhubaneshwar ei04-20.jpgKirthimukha at Mukteshvara Temple in Bhubaneshwar, Odisha (India) File:Parasuramesvara Temple 02.jpgKirthimukha at Parashurameshvara Temple in Bhubaneshwar, Odisha (India) See also *Bhavacakra *Rahu *Bhoma *Batara Kala Notes External links *Yalli & Mukha Indian architectural history Architectural elements Hindu temple architecture Hindu legendary creatures ","title":"Kirtimukha"},{"id":"9718476","text":"Flagstaff Medical Center, January 2018 Flagstaff Medical Center is a major hospital and level I trauma center in Flagstaff, Arizona.

It is based in New York City. Until December 2017, it was known as the Association of American University Presses (AAUP). History The Association of American University Presses was officially established in 1937. However, two dozen of the original members of the AAUP regularly met, unofficially, as early as 1920. The publishers met to discuss problems facing university presses until the group formally began meeting daily. The group believed that cooperative initiatives would benefit member institutions and subsequent presses. In 1928, thirteen university presses produced a cooperative catalog of sixty-five titles. Soon after, the group was placing cooperative ads with The New York Times, publishing sales catalogs, and producing the first educational directory, a specialized direct-mailing list of American academics and librarians. The 1932 Cheney Report encouraged joint activities among publishers facing economic difficulties brought on by the Great Depression and inspired a memo from Donald Bean, the group's secretary and director of the University of Chicago Press. Bean proposed for the group to formally incorporate. After a 1936 announcement of Farrar & Rheinhardt's plans to establish the United University Presses Inc. wholesaler (renamed, at the urging of the group, to \\"University Books Inc.\\"), the group began formally under a new banner. In February 1937, the first officers of the Association of American University Presses were elected. The first annual meeting was held in Chicago in 1946. Membership continued to grow steadily, and the responding swell of activity led to the establishment of a central office in 1959. The Association was previously operated by volunteers. In 1964 the association founded a business subsidiary, American University Press Services, which supported additional AAUP services for the next two decades. From 1920 to 1970, member institutions in the United States grew at a rate of about one per year. From 1970‚Äì1974, that rate doubled, with more than ten presses founded. The period of growth was honored by President Jimmy Carter in the summer of 1978. President Carter proclaimed the first University Press Week.

The ship was built in 2001 by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW), Kiel, Germany for Attica Group's subsidiary Superfast Ferries. She was sold to her current owners in 2017. In March 2006 Superfast sold its Baltic Sea operations to Tallink. Like her sisters, the Superfast VIII was moved from Finnish to Estonian registry, and her route changed to Hanko‚ÄìPaldiski‚ÄìRostock from April 2006 onwards. The call at Paldiski proved to be impractical, and already in June of the same year the route reverted to Hanko‚ÄìRostock. Around this time the ship's hull markings were changed to \\"Superfast operated by Tallink\\". Although there were rumours that the ships would be moved under Silja Line's brand from January 2007 onwards, they were instead officially made a part of Tallink's fleet. At the same time their route changed to Tallinn‚ÄìHelsinki‚ÄìRostock. Between 5 and 12 April 2007 the ship was used on the Helsinki‚ÄìTallinn route due to a delay in the delivery of the new MS Star.

In March 2011, Stena Line announced it would be chartering the Superfast VIII and sister ship Superfast VII. The vessels now operate on crossings of the North Channel separating Ireland and Britain; between Belfast and Cairnryan, at a new facility built by Stena Line called Loch Ryan Port. in February 2014, Stena renewed the charter of these ships until Autumn 2019. Stena Superfast VIII has been voted the top ship in the entire Stena Line fleet by Stena customers for both 2013 and 2014.  Conversion to day ferries  Before the two sisters entered service for Stena Line, an extensive refurbishment/conversion overseen by Stena Ro-Ro and Knud E Hansen was undertaken at the Remontowa Shipyard in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland. This was rumoured at the time to have cost a total of ‚Ç¨14M. As part of this conversion, the free height of the upper vehicle deck was raised to 5.05 m allowing Stena to carry full height freight. Both ships also received an additional bow thruster to improve manoeuvrability, taking their complement to 3 bow thrusters and 1 stern thruster. As the new port in Scotland had a TTS automated mooring system installed, the ships were also adapted to work with this by adding 3 steel bollards on the starboard side bow. Refurbishment During March 2015, some areas of Stena Superfast VIII were refurbished whilst the ship was dry docked at Harland and Wolff.

Starship 1 was later ported to the Atari 2600 as Star Ship.Interview with Bob Whitehead from DP Interviews Gameplay The object of Starship 1 is to destroy alien spacecraft while maneuvering \\"Starship Atari\\" through star and asteroid fields, \\"saving the Federation\\". The game uses a first person perspective on a black-and-white monitor. The player's ship is controlled with a control yoke that is connected to two potentiometers. There is also a lever that controls whether the ship is moving \\"fast\\" or \\"slow\\".Starship 1 service manual, Atari. Compared to common arcade games of the time, Starship 1 was comparatively advanced, but used quite a bit of analog technology that would become less common in arcade games in following years. As enemies appear onscreen, the player tries to center the enemy in the crosshairs and shoot it with his \\"phasors\\" by pulling a trigger on the control yoke. Alternatively, the player has 5 \\"proton torpedoes\\" per game that can be fired by pressing a large white button on the dashboard. This will destroy any enemy ship on screen, regardless of whether it is in the crosshairs (which are not game generated graphics but taped directly on the monitor screen). Four distinct enemies appear: Star Trek-inspired starships worth 50 points, eyed worm-like alien creatures and Klingon type ships each worth 100 points, and a flashing flying saucer craft worth 200 points. The player does not view the game monitor directly; the monitor is recessed in the cabinet, and the player views a reflected image of the monitor in a half- silvered mirror with a space background. Easter egg According to research by Ed Fries, Starship 1 contains the first known Easter egg in any arcade game. Fries confirmed with designer Ron Milner that by activating the machine's controls in the appropriate sequence, the game displays the message \\"Hi Ron!\\" (in reference to Milner) and gives ten free games.

In mangrove habitats the squid adhered their eggs to the roots of the mangrove. In the Andaman Sea, ths species occurred in subtidal seagrass beds near the mouth of estuaries lined with mangroves and on sand bars which were interspersed with rocks. In these habitats the eggs were attached to the underside of blades of seagrasses. These squids and their relatives have a glue gland on their dorsal body surface that they use to adhere to submerged vegetation and other objects. Their life cycle is thought to include a juvenile pelagic stage. Idiosepius thailandicus is classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN as its exact distribution is unknown and no assessments have been made of its population size or population trends. The seagrass beds which form an important part of this species habitat are under threat and if, as may be the case, this species extends north to Japan then the seagrass beds there have been severely negatively impacted by human activities.

Biography Abded was born on June 7, 1833 in the village of Sadad, a predominantly Syriac Orthodox village, south of Homs. He became a monk at an early age, and was later ordained priest. In 1870, he toured the Tur Abdin region and recorded the names of villages, monasteries, churches, clergy and the families living in the area. He was appointed metropolitan bishop of Diyarbekir Vilayet in 1872 by Patriarch Ignatius Peter IV, taking the name Gregorios, and in August 1874 accompanied him to Britain to persuade the British government to assist the church in India. They stayed here until April 1875, when they left for India to reorganise the church in India with the help of the British governor. Whilst in India, Abded fraternised with Protestant missionaries. After returning to Syria he spread Protestant ideas. They left India in May 1877 and remained in Syria before returning to London in 1879, where he secured a printing press for the Monastery of Mor Hananyo. Upon his return, Abded was ordained Bishop of Homs and Hama and left to attend the 1888 Lambeth Conference, and secured a second printing press. After the death of Ignatius Peter IV in 1894, a rivalry began between Abded and Abded Mshiho to be elected to the patriarchal throne. According to American missionaries operating in Syria at the time, the Ottoman government interfered and intimidated bishops based on the highest bidder. However, in 1895, Abded Mshiho was elected and consecrated patriarch. The following year, in 1896, Abded joined the Syriac Catholic Church . He was a Syrian Uniate for 9 years. In 1905, Abded renounced the church and took up his position as Syriac Orthodox Metropolitan of Amid again, under the promise of becoming the Patriarch upon its vacancy. Patriarch of Antioch The Patriarch, Ignatius Abdul Masih II, was deposed in 1903 by the Ottoman government, and Metropolitan Abded was elected as new Patriarch of Antioch as Ignatius Abded Aloho II effective 1906. The circumstances of how Patriarch Ignatius Abdul Masih II and by who and why is highly controversial within the Syriac Orthodox church. Supporters of Abded Sattuf claim the patriarch had converted to Catholicism and was excommunicated by the Holy Synod as a result. Some others claimed that the Patriarch had developed serious drinking problems particularly after the 1895 Massacres of Diyarbakƒ±r and that's why a number of Syriac bishops demanded he be deposed. Whereas supporters of Abded Mshiho claim Abded Sattuf bribed the Ottoman Government to issue a firman deposing Abded Mshiho as Patriarch and that he was not excommunicated by the Holy Synod. Supporters of Abded Mathiyo claimed Abded Sattuf claimed the patriarchal throne by paying ¬£500 to secure his election and was enthroned on August 15, 1906 as an exception that he was never been a Maphrian and left for London shortly after. Whilst in London, Abded met with King Edward VII twice and received a medal. He travelled to India in 1908 and began ordaining Indian bishops much to the chagrin of the local church. This led to the demand of a Maphrian or Catholicos to prevent the Malankara Church coming under Abded's control. In 1910, Abded established the Knanaya (Autonomous) Archdiocese)and consecrated Geevarghese Mor Severios on August 28, 1910. In 1912, the dispute over authority between supporters of the Metropolitan and supporters of the Patriarch finally divided the Malankara Church, with the former group becoming the essentially independent Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church headed by the Catholicos of the East and the latter maintaining ties with the Patriarch of Antioch as the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Christian Church. Motions by the church leaders and two Supreme Court decisions in the 20th century failed to heal the rift. He also travelled to Jerusalem in 1912. Abded resided at the Monastery of Mor Marqos from March 17, 1912 until his death on November 26, 1915, where he was also buried.

It is based on the book of the same name by Erich Maria Remarque. The 1979 film was directed by Delbert Mann. It has its share of tension and death, and in the spirit of the novel, manages to convey a sense of desolation, hardship and waste. Late in the film, the turmoil and wretchedness of the main character, Paul Baumer, is manifested in his extreme disassociation while home on furlough. Most of the filming took place in Czechoslovakia. Plot During World War I, 18-year-old Paul B√§umer enlists in the German army with five of his high school friends (Behm, Kropp, Muller, Kemmerich and Leer), after being indoctrinated by Kantorek, their teacher, as to the glory and superiority of German culture. After surviving training camp under the brutal Corporal Himmelstoss, the young men board a troop train bound for the front line. Ominously, at the same moment, they notice another train arriving in town loaded with returning wounded soldiers, who are carried off on stretchers. Once at the front line, they are placed in a squad, along with soldiers Tjaden, Westhus, Detering and others, under the supervision of Stanislaus \\"Kat\\" Katzinsky. Kat teaches them how to best take cover, how to find extra food, and other survival skills. When Paul and his squad return to a French town for a rest week, they see the new recruits have grown younger and younger. To their delight, the leader of these new recruits is their recently demoted training NCO, Himmelstoss. When Himmelstoss tries to make them obey him, they stand up to him. Later in the trenches, while the Germans are launching an offensive attack, Paul sees another squad cowering in a crater, which includes Himmelstoss. Paul forces Himmelstoss to keep on the offensive. The French and German armies are shown attacking each other repeatedly over a few hundred yards of torn, corpse-strewn land. Kemmerich is wounded, and later dies in an overcrowded army hospital. Paul returns to the trenches with his squad, distraught over Kemmerich's death. When a French soldier falls into a crater Paul is hiding in, Paul stabs the man in the stomach with his bayonet. Forced to spend the night with him, Paul tries to bandage the dying soldier's wounds, but he dies anyway. Paul escapes from the crater, stricken with guilt. An inexperienced new recruit, after falling into a pit of poison gas, is carried off by the medics to a slow, painful death; the medics had appeared before Kat could put him out of his misery. Although Paul, Kropp and Leer have their first sexual experience with a trio of accommodating French peasant girls, the vast majority of the young men's experiences are horrific. One by one, practically all of Paul's schoolmate friends die. A haughty, stiff Kaiser Wilhelm II visits their camp to ceremoniously pin medals on heroic soldiers, which includes Himmelstoss. When Paul's squad is bombed in a French town close to the front, Behm dies while Kropp loses a leg and Paul is seriously wounded. Paul improves and he is granted two weeks leave. Returning home, Paul is told by his sister that their mother is dying of cancer. In visits to a beer garden and to his former teacher, Paul realises that his town's older men, in their enthusiasm for war, have no sense of the horrors they have sent their youth to. He also visits Kemmerich's mother and lies to her that he did not suffer. Paul returns to duty, Kat is wounded in the leg by an artillery shell and Paul carries him many miles to a field hospital. Only at the hospital does Paul discover that Kat has died, shot at some point during the journey. Paul writes a letter to Kropp, the sole survivor of their class, who is now an amputee. After finishing the letter, Paul walks through the trench checking on the younger soldiers, having taken up Kat's position as a mentor. He spots a bird and begins to sketch it. The bird starts to fly away and Paul stands up to see where it went, a lone sniper's shot rings out, killing him. A field communique from the German High Command flashes over Paul's lifeless body, falsely declaring ‚ÄúAll Quiet on the Western Front‚Äù, despite the date on the communique showing that the German army was collapsing, just days from complete surrender. Cast Production The film maintains very authentic look throughout its course. Paul and his friends are clearly part of an industrialized war machine that ruthlessly uses them despite the soldiers having only a vague understanding of what they are fighting for. Authentic details such as new replacement soldiers seen in the film getting younger and younger as the story progresses are reflective of how Germany, like most of the combatants, struggled to find new recruits for the ranks of their armies at the front as the war progressed.

Because the head appears to be similar in style to artifacts of Roman origin, some believe that it is evidence of pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact between Rome and the Americas, a view strongly promoted by archaeologist Romeo H. Hristov. However, several other explanations for its presence have also been put forward.  Find  The object was discovered by archaeologist Jos√© Garc√≠a Pay√≥n during an excavation in 1933. It was a grave offering, found under three intact floors of a pyramidal structure. Along with the head were found a number of objects made of gold, copper, turquoise, rock crystal, jet, bone, shell and pottery. The burial was dated to between 1476 and 1510 AD. Pay√≥n did not publish information about the head itself until 1960.  Evidence for Roman manufacture  An assessment of the case was made in 2001 by Romeo H. Hristov of University of New Mexico and Santiago Genov√©s T. of National Autonomous University of Mexico. A thermoluminescence test performed in 1995 by P. Schaaf and G.A. Wagner in the FS Arch√§ometrie unit in Heidelberg, Germany established its age range to somewhere between the 9th century BC and the middle of the 13th century AD, confirming its pre-colonial provenance. However, Schaaf and Wagner have objected to the way the dates were described by Hristov and Genoves.  Hypotheses  Researchers who have analyzed the artifact have come up with several possible explanations for the object's presence at the site: * A hoax: according to an informal declaration by Paul Schmidt, an archaeologist at UNAM, the head was planted in the site by a participating archaeologist, Hugo Moedano, in an attempt to play a practical joke on Jos√© Garc√≠a Pay√≥n, supervisor of the dig. Schmidt moreover stated earlier that Garc√≠a Pay√≥n was not present during the entirety of the excavation.Smith, Michael E. \\"The 'Roman Figurine' Supposedly Excavated at Calixtlahuaca\\", Accessed: 2012-02-13. Garc√≠a Pay√≥n's son insists that his father stated that he was on the site at the time of discovery. According to Hristov, these allegations are hearsay, and because the individuals directly involved have since died, a confirmation or refutation of the allegations has become impossible. * An import from an early European visitor who came to Central Mexico. The date range for the burial includes the early period of European exploration of the Americas, though it predates the first sustained contact with Mexico under Hern√°n Cort√©s. According to Hristov, it is possible but highly unlikely that the head was introduced during the Medieval or early Colonial period. Hristov notes that other historians have considered the possibility of a Norse visit to the region and that the figure's unusual head-dress bears a possible resemblance to Norse or Viking headgear. * It was traded or carried to Asia, and was imported to America via a transpacific route from southeast Asia by a Chinese or Indian ship. This thesis was proposed by Robert Heine-Geldern in 1961, and has achieved some support.Heine-Geldern, Robert von. \\"Ein R√∂mischer Fund aus dem Vorkolumbischen Mexico.\\" Anzeiger der √ñsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Philosophisch-historische Klasse.

Hristov claims that the possibility of such an event has been made more likely by the discovery of evidence of travels from Romans, Phoenicians and Berbers in the 6th or 5th century BC to Tenerife and Lanzarote in the Canaries, and of a Roman settlement (from the 1st century BC to the 4th century AD) on Lanzarote. David Grove, an archaeologist at the University of Illinois, pointed out that being washed ashore from a Roman shipwreck does not imply any \\"contact\\", let alone Roman \\"discovery\\" of the New World.James Meek, \\"Clue to Romans' head start on Columbus\\", The Guardian, Thursday 10 February 2000.

It is topped with a distinctive 6-story octagonal tower with a golden Art Deco finial. Its address is 200 Carondelet Street. Originally a commercial building it was renovated for use as a residential building after Hurricane Katrina.  Description  The building was constructed from 1928 to 1929, under the direction of Louisiana architect Moise Goldstein; the general contractor was George J. Glover Company. Construction consisted of a steel skeleton, concrete, and hollow tiles. Bricks were used for common walls. The base of the building was faced with polished granite and a limestone facade was used on the upper floors. On top of the 23rd floor is a 6-story octagonal tower, covered by an ornamental finial. The building was the first in New Orleans to utilize indoor air-conditioning within a public space. In the late 1980s, when the building was assessed for National Register listing, the interior lobby area was marble clad, and the ceiling was described as, \\"gold and silver leaf pressed metal with a repeating chevron and diamond point pattern\\". with three photos and a map The banking hall roof was supported by columns, and bronze was used for elevator doors, panels, and check stations. The banking hall also retained its original chandeliers, as well as walnut paneling on the walls.  History  During peak occupation of the building in the 20th century, banks utilized the ground floor and mezzanine, while upper floors were occupied by law firms and other businesses. By 2000, the building was vacant. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, renovation opportunities arose to replace thousands of rental units lost in the storm. Renovation of the structure was completed in 2008, using public and private investment to convert the building into mixed income residential apartments, under the name \\"200 Carondelet\\".

Baxter in a 1932 guide for the northern Arizona traveler. They eloquently described the wonders of the vast region‚Äîcolors to delight the artist, Native American peoples to engage the anthropologist, traces of human occupation to occupy the archaeologist, an open textbook for the geologist, plants and wildlife to intrigue the biologist and botanist‚Äîin short, an area abundant with treasures to delight both scientist and visitor. The authors were reiterating what had already been stated‚Äînorthern Arizona and the Colorado Plateau were definitely worth exploring. Northern Arizona sits on part of the Colorado Plateau which extends over parts of four western states: Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. The section in northern Arizona features the towering volcano known as the San Francisco Peaks, the ever-changing palette of the Painted Desert, the unequaled Grand Canyon, beautiful Lake Powell, curious Petrified Forest, lush Oak Creek Canyon, bountiful Verde Valley, and the verdant White Mountains, just to name a few high-lights. Living amongst these physical marvels are the native peoples who, in the course of maintaining their cultural traditions, acknowledge and celebrate the natural wonders surrounding them. Elevations extend three miles vertically‚Äîfrom the 12,637 foot-high Humphrey's Peak of the San Francisco Peaks to the one-mile-deep Grand Canyon. In between are nearly limitless examples of the Earth's natural history, brought close together in an area that provides an unending laboratory for the inquisitive. Into this land came Harold Sellers and Mary-Russell Ferrell Colton and their family. Dr. Colton was a zoology professor at the University of Pennsylvania whose zest for knowledge went far beyond that field and who would be forever excited by the many research opportunities in northern Arizona. Mrs. Colton was equally intrigued by the native peoples and scenic grandeur of the region, and she spent many hours sketching and painting them. After numerous visits to the region, they moved to Flagstaff in 1926 to pursue their mutual and individual interests. The Coltons became involved in efforts to create a local museum that would display the natural and human wonders of the area. Combining their skill and benevolence, and in response to the urging of prominent citizens of both Flagstaff and Tucson, they helped the community found the Museum of Northern Arizona (MNA) in 1928. The Museum is a regionally based institution that researches, collects, and exhibits all that represents northern Arizona and the Colorado Plateau. Dr. Colton became MNA Director and Mrs. Colton the Curator of Art and Ethnology, allowing them to follow and explore their respective interests in science and art, and making MNA the spirited, multifaceted institution we enjoy today. With its unique blend of science and art, MNA stands alone. At MNA, research and public exhibits intertwine with collections to present a rich, composite view of northern Arizona and the Colorado Plateau. In 1930, they hired Katharine Bartlett a physical anthropologist from Denver to curate the museum. Bartlett spent the next 51 years organizing first the museum and then the library. Her cataloging procedures became the foundation of the research facility the museum has become. The Museum of Northern Arizona offers its visitors many opportunities to become familiar with the area through public exhibits and programs. At the same time, its staff and researchers continue their studies, because science, like life, is not static‚Äîit is ever-evolving. MNA continually explores ways to preserve this distinctive region and ensure that its uniqueness endures. MNA's three components‚Äîpublic programs, research, and collections‚Äîcomplement one another in a continual circle. Scientists study the data, utilize the collections, and develop public exhibits designed to introduce the Colorado Plateau. Museum visitors, after this introduction, often seek further knowledge, stimulating the scientists to reconsider the data and to reexamine the collections. This ongoing cycle is considered optimal for a museum, as each component is dependent upon the other. MNA is a private, nonprofit organization supported by its members and by supplemental funding. Its exhibit areas have grown from two rooms in the Flagstaff Woman's Club in 1928 to today's 24,700-square-foot Exhibits building that hosted over 91,000 visitors in 1996. On an adjacent part of the campus are its research and collections facilities. The Ethnology Gallery within this organization demonstrates the evolution and distinct characteristics of such tribes as the Hopi, Zuni, Navajo, and Pai. =Flagstaff and The Establishment of MNA= \\"A happy accident...would take me...to and through Arizona...\\" said forester Bernhard E. Fernow in 1897, writing about his trip with biologist C. Hart Merriam to explore Arizona. Fernow told the National Geographic Society about his delight at the unique environs of Arizona and desire to return as often as possible. He was not alone in this thinking as heightened awareness of the area brought more and more researchers. Scientific study of northern Arizona had begun in the 1850s with government-sponsored road and railway surveyors who preceded the settlers. The surveyors' reports to Washington, D.C., describing the natural wonders of the Flagstaff area and the Colorado Plateau, prompted other scientists to explore the area. Construction of the transcontinental roads and railroads brought the first settlers to Flagstaff in the 1870s. Laborers, shopkeepers, and saloon owners liked its scenic location at the base of the San Francisco Peaks, which offered a permanent water supply. The town's remoteness caused less-than-desirable residents to appear, providing Flagstaff with its share of rough-and-rowdy early days. Additional settlers moved in and earned a living from the natural resources of the area, including timber and grazing land. By the time of the Coltons' arrival in 1926, the 4,000 Flagstaff residents were encouraging the newly arrived educators, scientists, and artists to help steer their town away from its wild-west beginnings. In Flagstaff, the Coltons sought avenues to pursue their respective interests of science and art. Both believed that they should help others and use their time and money for the accomplishment of lasting contributions. In Flagstaff, they saw propitious opportunities for all of their interests. Dr. Colton made an immediate connection in Flagstaff scientific circles during the first summer they camped in Flagstaff, due to a letter of introduction from Professor Edward S. Morse, a personal friend of both Dr. Colton and Percival Lowell, to Dr. V.M. Slipher of Lowell Observatory. The Observatory, founded in Flagstaff in 1894 by Percival Lowell and the site of pioneering astronomical work, is located in Flagstaff specifically for the clear dark skies that present opportunities for unclouded space study. Northern Arizona Normal School, later Arizona State Teachers College and still later Northern Arizona University, opened in the fall of 1899 with classes for those preparing to be teachers. Its Faculty contained a few scientists and artists Beginning in 1929 with Lyndon Hargrave, MNA anthropology staff donated their time to teach classes at the college, with Dr. Colton underwriting the costs. This continued until the 1950s, when NAU finally supported an anthropology faculty. Henry H. Robinson arrived in Flagstaff from Yale University in 1901 for a summer's work of graduate studies on the San Francisco Peaks volcanic field. He returned for the following two summers to complete his dissertation on the geology of the Peaks. His work followed, by nearly half a century, the establishment of the U.S Geological Survey, which still maintains a facility in Flagstaff. The youthful U.S. Forest Service established the nation's first forest research experiment station in nearby Fort Valley at the request of Flagstaff lumbermen T.A. and M.J. Riordan, who sought the answers to why the Ponderosa pine trees, once so profuse, were not regenerating after logging. Station Director Gustaf A. Pearson began studies into this problem in August, 1908. He served as an ex-officio MNA Trustee until his retirement in 1945 and today has a building at the Research Center named after him. Pearson also helped Dr. Colton and former Lowell employee Andrew E. Douglass to pioneer studies in tree-ring dating. Pearson provided Douglass with tree-boring equipment, which Douglass used to perfect the science of determining the age of trees based on their growth (Dendrochronology), greatly aiding researchers in dating archaeological sites. Douglass experimented with trees on MNA property, and the first tree- ring conference was held in 1934 under pines near the Colton House. Perhaps the most visible scientific presence in northern Arizona contributing to the evolution of MNA was that of the geologists and archaeologists who arrived in Flagstaff via the train in early summer, where they purchased supplies that were taken to remote sites located out on the Plateau. Then, in late summer, the bearded, sandy, and windblown scientists returned with boxes and crates filled with materials removed from the sites. Flagstaff residents watched with resentment as \\"their\\" artifacts disappeared when the men boarded the trains to return to eastern museums with their finds. Thus began the desire for a local place where regional materials could be housed, studied, and displayed.

In 1904, downtown Baltimore was almost destroyed by a huge fire with damages estimated at $150 million. Since the City of Baltimore was chartered in 1796, this downtown nucleus has been the focal point of business in the Baltimore metropolitan area. It has also increasingly become a heavily populated neighborhood with over 37,000 residents and new condominiums and apartment homes being built steadily. Geography City Center is the historic financial district in Baltimore that has increasingly shifted eastward and into the Inner Harbor. Hundreds of businesses are found here, and it remains the center of life in Baltimore. The area is home to the majority of Baltimore's skyscrapers including the Bank of America building, the M&T; Bank Building, the Transamerica Tower, the Baltimore World Trade Center, the old IBM building, and the massive Charles Center district. It includes historic Charles Street as well as significant avenues of commercial and cultural activity along Pratt Street, east to west, and St. Paul Street- Calvert Street, north to south. The Inner Harbor is the chief commercial and tourist destination in Baltimore, The Inner Harbor features a large number of restaurants, hotels, retail areas (such as Harborplace), and entertainment (such as Power Plant Live!). It was named by National Geographic as one of the best summer trips in 2012 (along with all of Baltimore in general). The Inner Harbor is also home to a variety of museums and scientific institutions such as the Maryland Science Center, the National Aquarium in Baltimore, the Reginald F.

Charles Street headquarters of the Partnership for Downtown Baltimore Westside Baltimore is the western portion of downtown Baltimore that includes Market Center and many of the newest developments in downtown Baltimore, including the Baltimore Convention Center. It is also home to the site of the \\"Superblock\\" project that will include hundreds of condos and apartments as well as a variety of retail and commercial space. The former home of Baltimore's many and famed department stores, Westside Baltimore is now anchored by the University of Maryland, Baltimore consisting of the University of Maryland Health System, University of Maryland School of Law and the University of Maryland Biopark. The Westside is also home to several performing arts centers, including the Hippodrome Theatre, Royal Farms Arena, and the Everyman Theatre. G. Krug & Son Ironworks and Museum, in its original location, is the oldest continually operating blacksmith shop in the United States as well as a museum. The former home of famed American writer Edgar Allan Poe is located at the Edgar Allan Poe House and Museum, a few blocks northwest from his grave at the intersection of Greene and Fayette streets. Nearby is the historic Lexington Market, one of the longest-running markets in the world, having been founded in 1782 and in continual operation since, selling a variety of prepared foods and groceries. Mount Vernon, also known as the cultural district, is a high- density area just north of Downtown known for its attractive nightlife, buoyed by its large number of bars, clubs and lounges and its historic multi-story townhomes (most of which have been transformed into apartments) and traditional apartment buildings. Mount Vernon features the Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, home of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, as well as the Lyric Opera House. The world-renowned Peabody Institute is also located in Mount Vernon adjacent to the Walters Art Museum.

He was also a liberal writer and politician. Early life Vicu√±a was born in Santiago, the son of Francisco Ram√≥n Vicu√±a and of Mariana de Aguirre y Boza. Vicu√±a's father served two brief terms as acting president of Chile in 1829, and was widely considered as the head of the Liberal party. Pedro F√©lix Vicu√±a received an excellent education, studying humanities and commerce. From a young age he showed an interest in letters, and particularly in journalism. In 1825, at the age of 20, he moved from Santiago to Valpara√≠so, where he bought a printing press and began publishing El Tel√©grafo Mercantil y Pol√≠tico. This periodical was founded October 3, 1826, and 89 issues were published. In 1826, he married Carmen Mackenna, daughter of Brigadier Juan Mackenna, and they had thirteen children. In 1827, at the age of 21, he founded the newspaper El Mercurio de Valpara√≠so, together with typographers Thomas Wells and Ignacio Silva. The first issue appeared September 12, 1827. Initially it was published only on Wednesdays and Saturdays, but in 1829 it became a daily. That same year, Vicu√±a sold his interest in the newspaper and moved back to Santiago (this was also the year that his father happened to serve as president of Chile.) Back in the capital, he worked as editor for the newspaper La Ley y la Justicia. He also participated in El Censor (1830) and the magazine Paz Perpetua a los Chilenos (1836). As the result of ideas he expressed in Paz perpetua, he gained the enmity of Conservative Interior Minister Diego Portales. Vicu√±a Aguirre was considered a liberal and a revolutionary. Political career In 1831 Vicu√±a was elected deputy from La Serena, but his election was annulled by the Chamber of Deputies, dominated by the Conservatives. The same year his son Benjam√≠n Vicu√±a Mackenna, a future journalist and historian, was born to him and his wife. Disillusioned, he returned to rural life. In 1840 he supported the candidacy of Francisco Antonio Pinto, also a Liberal, and opposed Manuel Bulnes. In 1842 he published El Observador, and in 1845 El Republicano, both of which supported the candidacy of liberal general Ram√≥n Freire. As a result, he was exiled, and went to Peru. In Peru he wrote the book Ocho meses de destierro o cartas sobre el Per√∫ (Eight Months of Exile, or Letters About Peru). It was published in 1847 after his return to Chile. He aided the revolutionaries of 1851, and was named intendente of Concepci√≥n during the armed rebellion. He fought government troops in the Battle of Loncomilla (December 8, 1815). Although he was defeated, he refused to sign the Treaty of Purapel, which ended the civil war. In 1852 he wrote El porvenir del hombre (The Future of Man), considered his greatest work. In 1853 he published another autobiographical work, Memorias √çntimas. He was again elected to the Chamber of Deputies, for La Serena in 1864 and for Ovalle in 1867. He supported three important reform projects -- reform of the constitution, creation of a national bank, and organization of a mining tribunal. In his 1867 term he introduced a bill to end imprisonment for debt, which was passed by the Congress. In 1870 he was elected senator for the first of two terms. He died in 1874 in Santiago.

It is situated close to the western (left) bank of the river Rhine and mostly aligned to allow 160 km/h operation between Cologne and Koblenz and between Bingen and Mainz. Line speed between Koblenz and Bingen is restricted by the meandering nature of the Rhine Gorge, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. History West Rhine railway, near Remagen Map of railway lines in the Koblenz area Ludendorff Bridge on 17 March 1945 four hours before the collapse The first section of the line opened on 15 February 1844, by the Bonn‚ÄìCologne Railway Company (Bonn-C√∂lner Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft) between the former station of Cologne St. Pantaleon Cologne and Bonn. It was extended on 21 January 1856, south to Rolandseck station and in 1859 north to the Cologne central station. After the takeover by the Rhenish Railway Company (Rheinische Eisenbahn Gesellschaft, RhE) on 1 January 1857 the line was extended in 1858 through Remagen and Andernach and crossed the Moselle to Koblenz via the Moselle railway bridge, opened on 11 November 1858. The particularly beautiful section of the line between Koblenz and Bingerbr√ºck (now called Bingen Hbf), which runs close to the river through this winding section of the Rhine Valley was opened on 15 December 1859. Bingerbr√ºck station was at the time on the border of the Kingdom of Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Here it connected with the Rhine-Main line of the Hessian Ludwig Railway (Hessische Ludwigsbahn), opened on 17 October 1859, from Mainz and the Nahe Valley Railway to Saarbr√ºcken. In Koblenz, the Pfaffendorf Bridge over the Rhine was completed in 1864 to connect to the Right Rhine line to Niederlahnstein and Wiesbaden. With the construction of the Horchheim Bridge south of Koblenz, opened in 1879, and the Urmitz Bridge north of Koblenz, opened in 1918, this bridge was progressively given over to pedestrian, vehicular and, eventually, tram traffic and the last train used it at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. From 1861 the Nassau State Railways established a train ferry between Bingen and R√ºdesheim am Rhein; this was converted to a passenger ferry in 1900. From 1870 to 1914 another train ferry operated between Bonn and Oberkassel to transfer trains between the West Rhine line and the East Rhine railway. During the First World War three strategic Rhine crossings were built at the request of the German generals in order to bring troops and war materials to the Western Front. The Bingen‚ÄìR√ºdesheim ferry was replaced by the Hindenburg Bridge, built between 1913 and 1915 and connecting the East Rhine line with the West Rhine railway and the Nahe Valley Railway. From 1916 to 1918, the Neuwied‚ÄìKoblenz line, including the Crown Prince Wilhelm Bridge, was built between Urmitz and Neuwied-Engers. The Ludendorff Bridge between Erpel and Remagen was built from 1916 to 1919. It connected the East and West Rhine railway lines and the strategically important Ahr Valley Railway. The Hindenburg, Ludendorff and Kronprinz-Wilhelm Bridges were destroyed in World War II. Only the Crown Prince Wilhelm Bridge was rebuilt, as the Urmitz bridge, in 1954. The line was electrified in 1959. Current operations Until the opening of the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line, the line was one of the busiest in Germany. The fastest trains connecting the Rhineland and southern Germany ran on the line. The importance of the line for long distance travel has diminished since the opening of the high-speed line. The line is now generally used by one InterCity or Intercity-Express service (stopping at Bonn, Koblenz and Mainz) each hour, the Hamburg-K√∂ln-Express (certain days, stops at Bingen instead of Mainz), one Regional-Express train each hour (the Rhein-Express to Koblenz Hauptbahnhof and one RegionalBahn (stopping) train each hour in each direction, as well as by many freight trains. Before the opening of the high-speed line, freight trains were largely restricted to the Right Rhine line, but with the increased availability of train paths on the Left Rhine line many of them are now routed over it.

In February 2015, Marine Atlantic announced that the lease on the vessel had been renewed until November 2017 for a cost of C$40 million. It was subsequently extended again, and the vessel is under Marine Atlantic control through November 2019. As of 2016 Atlantic Vision operates on Marine Atlantic's services between North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and the Newfoundland ports of Channel-Port aux Basques and Argentia. The ship was built in 2002 as MS Superfast IX by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) in Kiel, Germany for Attica Group's subsidiary Superfast Ferries. She is currently the fastest RoPax and largest KW rating ferry operating in North America. Service history =2002-2006: Superfast Ferries service= In 2001 Superfast Ferries had made a deal with the Swedish government to operate a ferry connection between S√∂dert√§lje in Sweden and Rostock for ten years, starting from spring 2002. Superfast IX inaugurated this service in January 2002 (she started service on 10 January but wasn't officially named until the 11). The route proved to be unprofitable, and in April of the same year the it was closed down, with Superfast IX laid up at HDW in Kiel. On May of the same year Superfast IX, alongside her sister MS Superfast X, started a new service for Superfast, connecting Rosyth (Scotland) to Zeebrugge (Belgium). In February 2004 she was rebuilt with extra cabins at Fosen Mekaniske Verksteder, Fosen, Norway. In November 2005 Superfast IX was moved to Hanko‚ÄîRostock route. MS Superfast IX departing Helsinki for Rostock, May 2007. =2006-2008: Tallink service= In March 2006 Superfast sold their Baltic Sea operations to Tallink for ‚Ç¨310 million. Following this Superfast IX and her sisters were re-registered to Paldiski in Estonia, and the route changed to Hanko‚ÄîPaldiski‚ÄîRostock from April 2006 onwards. Calling at Paldiski proved problematic as Estonia was not a member of the Schengen Treaty, and in June of the same year the route reverted to Hanko‚ÄîRostock. According to the agreement Tallink could keep the Superfast marketing name until the end of 2007, but the ships' hulls soon sported the texts \\"Superfast operated by Tallink\\". From the beginning on the year 2007 the ship's route changed to Tallinn‚ÄîHelsinki‚ÄîRostock, with the West Harbour as the port in Helsinki. As the same time all remaining Superfast logos and hull markings were removed. At the time it was reported that coinciding with the move to sail from Helsinki the Superfast ships would be transferred to the fleet of Tallink's subsidiary Silja Line, but this did not came to pass. In April 2008 Tallink made an agreement for chartering Superfast IX to Marine Atlantic, a Canadian Crown Corporation, for five years from October 2008 onwards. The Government of Canada will provide Marine Atlantic with $101 million over five years to fund the charter. The ship will be used by Marine Atlantic on their service between Port aux Basques, Newfoundland and North Sydney, Nova Scotia.Tom Peters, \\"Marine Atlantic gets bigger ferry: Fuel-efficient vessel will join NS-NL route starting in March\\", The Chronicle Herald [Halifax NS], 11 December 2008, p. C2 A naming competition was held for the ship, with students in Newfoundland and Labrador and in Cape Breton eligible to make entries. On 21 June 2008 the results of the competition were published, and Atlantic Vision was chosen as the new name for the vessel. =2008 onwards: Marine Atlantic service= Superfast IX ceased service with Tallink on 31 August 2008 and subsequently sailed to Turku Repair Yard in Naantali, Finland for reconstruction into her new service. The changes made included the installation more powerful bow thrusters, rebuilding the bow and stern ramps as well as refurbishing the interiors. The ship was renamed MV Atlantic Vision in November 2008. The reconstruction was completed on 14 November 2008, and on the same date the ship was officially delivered to Marine Atlantic. Atlantic Vision arrived in St. John's, Newfoundland on 7 December 2008. A renaming ceremony was held for the ship on 11 December 2008, although she had officially been renamed already during the previous month. Atlantic Vision entered service on the Port-aux-Basques‚ÄîNorth Sydney route on 1 April 2009. In the summer months, the ship also operates on the North Sydney - Argentia Route. Incidents On 27 December 2008, while the ship was still moored in North Sydney awaiting the beginning of service, a fire broke out in one of the two heating units of Atlantic Vision at 11:50 PM local time. The North Sydney fire department assisted the crew in containing the fire to the boiler room. The fire was extinguished by 1:00 AM on 28 December. No injuries were suffered, but the damage to the ship delayed her entry into service, which was originally slated for March 2009. Atlantic Vision was again forced to dock when a fire broke out in the second of two heating units on 29 July 2009. The ferry was briefly taken out of service again on 18 August, after striking the dock in Port-aux-Basques, causing a \\"small abrasion\\" in the fender at the stern of the vessel. The damage was inspected and repaired and Atlantic Vision returned to service later that day. On 7 October 2009, Marine Atlantic received a bomb threat directed against Atlantic Vision, which was docked in Port-aux-Basques at the time. The vessel was evacuated and investigated by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), but the threat was determined to be a hoax, and she returned to service shortly thereafter. On 22 December 2009, Atlantic Vision was again taken out of service after high winds forced the vessel against the fenders during docking procedures at Port-aux- Basques, causing a puncture 5 meters above the waterline at the stern of the vessel. The temporary loss of the ship caused additional delays, as other ferries on the North Sydney - Port-aux-Basques run were unable to dock and offload in Port-aux-Basques while she was being repaired. Atlantic Vision was repaired and returned to service late on 23 December 2009.

He played college football as a quarterback at Boston College and professionally with Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL) and the Los Angeles Dons and Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). O'Rourke quarterbacked the Boston College Eagles football team to one of its most famous wins. His 24-yard run late in the fourth quarter gave the 1940 Eagles a 19‚Äì13 victory over Tennessee in the 1941 Sugar Bowl, staking BC's claim to a national championship. O'Rourke served as the head football coach at University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass) from 1952 to 1959, compiling a record of 21‚Äì39‚Äì4. In 1972, he came the first Boston College player to be inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. Boston College Although all of his records have been broken, O'Rourke was one of Boston College's first star quarterbacks. In three seasons, he completed 69 of 150 passes for 1,108 yards and 14 touchdowns. =1940 season= The 1940 team is perhaps the greatest football team in the history of Boston College. After the previous year's team earned the school's first appearance in a bowl game (Boston College lost to Clemson in the 1940 Cotton Bowl Classic) O'Rourke's running backs included veterans Frank Maznicki, Lou Montgomery (Boston College's first African-American football player), and team captain Henry Toczylowski. They were joined by a talented newcomer named Mike Holovak. The team also had wonderful receivers including Henry Woronicz, Gene Goodreault, Ed Zabilski, and Don Currivan. The team was undefeated outscoring its opponents 320 to 52 and held six teams scoreless. Boston College impressed the sports community by defeating Tulane 27 to 7 in the second week of the season and defeating Georgetown 19 to 18, snapping Georgetown's streak of twenty-two consecutive wins. On January 1, 1941, Boston College defeated Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, 19 to 13. BC claims it won the national title in a three-way tie with Stanford and Minnesota, however the NCAA does not recognize Boston College as a national champion in that year. Professional career O'Rourke's professional career began in 1942 with the Chicago Bears. He saw limited playing time behind incumbent starter Sid Luckman. He completed 37 of 88 passes for 951 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. He also intercepted three passes on defense, returned two punts, and made 23 punts for 817 yards for the 11‚Äì0 Bears. In 1946 he joined the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) as starting quarterback. In two seasons in Los Angeles he completed 194 of 354 passes for 2,699 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 30 interceptions. In 1948 he joined the AAFC's Baltimore Colts as a punter and back up quarterback behind Y. A. Tittle. In 1949, he played only five games before retiring and becoming an assistant coach for Baltimore until the team folded in 1950.

He moved to Portsmouth in 1849 and became a successful merchant and brewer. He owned businesses in Portsmouth and South Boston, Massachusetts. Jones, the mayor of Portsmouth in 1868 and 1869, elected as a Democrat to the Forty-fourth and Forty-fifth Congresses (March 4, 1875 ‚Äì March 3, 1879) was not a candidate for renomination in 1878. He was the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Governor of New Hampshire in 1880, losing to Republican Charles Henry Bell by only a few thousand votes, 44,432 to 40,813. Jones Mansion in Portsmouth, NH Later, Jones became involved with the Republican Party. He was disgusted over William Jennings Bryan's stand on Free Silver. He became interested in railroads and hotels. Jones rebuilt the stately Rockingham Hotel in Portsmouth and enlarged the Hotel Wentworth (now Wentworth-by-the-Sea) in New Castle. Also in Portsmouth, Jones built a mansion in the Second Empire style, with gardens and a horse track, completed in 1876. He was a presidential elector on the Republican ticket in 1900. He died in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on October 2, 1902, and was buried in Harmony Grove Cemetery.

He apprenticed with Fabrizio Boschi, then with the more academic and puritanical Domenico Passignano, and finally with Francesco Furini. He is best known for painting in a style reminiscent of the morbidly sensual Furini. Reflective of this obsession is his self-portrait, c. 1650, in which he depicts himself building up a plump naked female from a skeleton. The biographer Baldinucci, in what little he notes of the painter, recalls him as the scandalous \\"imitator of (Furini's) licentious inventions\\". A more complete biography was recorded by his pupil Giovanni Camillo Sagrestani. Described as endowed with a \\"bizarre and amenable intelligence\\", Pignoni apparently had a late-life conversion to more pious painting. There is one episode recalled that during a serious illness \\"because in his life he had focused on studying about female forms, and (now) having resigned himself to the impending infinity, his spiritual father urged him to purge those errors with the flame, and once guided by a good disposition, he suddenly was cured by the Lord.\\" Baldinucci's biography of Furini also recorded a similar, near-death renunciation of his art of the naked figure. Among his more conventional works are a St. Agatha cured by St. Peter (attributed) in the Museo Civico di Trieste; a St. Louis providing a banquet for the poor (c. 1682) now in the church of Santa Felicita in Florence, commissioned by Conte Luigi Gucciardini; and a Madonna and child in glory with archangels Saints Michael and Raphael in battle armor and San Antonio of Padua (1671) for the Cappella di San Michele in Santissima Annunziata. He painted an Allegory of Peace in Palazzo Vecchio. A Penitent Magdalen that has been attributed to Pignoni is found in the Pitti Palace. In San Bartolomeo in Monteoliveto, he painted a Madonna appearing to Blessed Bernardo Tolomeo. In addition to Sagrestani, another pupil was the priest Luca Querci of Cutigliano.Guida di Pistoia per gli amanti delle belle arti con notizie, by Francesco Tolomei, 1821, page 194.

Research shows that the CLOCK gene plays a major role as an activator of downstream elements in the pathway critical to the generation of circadian rhythms.  Discovery  The Clock gene was first identified in 1994 by Dr. Joseph Takahashi and his colleagues. Takahashi used forward mutagenesis screening of mice treated with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea to create and identify mutations in key genes that broadly affect circadian activity. The Clock mutants discovered through the screen displayed an abnormally long period of daily activity. This trait proved to be heritable. Mice bred to be heterozygous showed longer periods of 24.4 hours compared to the control 23.3 hour period. Mice homozygous for the mutation showed 27.3 hour periods, but eventually lost all circadian rhythmicity after several days in constant darkness. That showed that \\"intact Clock genes\\" are necessary for normal mammalian circadian function .  Function  CLOCK protein has been found to play a central role as a transcription factor in the circadian pacemaker. In Drosophila, newly synthesized CLOCK (CLK) is hypophosphorylated in the cytoplasm before entering the nucleus. Once in the nuclei, CLK is localized in nuclear foci and is later redistributed homogeneously. CYCLE (CYC) (also known as dBMAL for the BMAL1 ortholog in mammals) dimerizes with CLK via their respective PAS domains. This dimer then recruits co-activator CREB-binding protein (CBP) and is further phosphorylated. Once phosphorylated, this CLK-CYC complex binds to the E-box elements of the promoters of period (per) and timeless (tim) via its bHLH domain, causing the stimulation of gene expression of per and tim. A large molar excess of period (PER) and timeless (TIM) proteins causes formation of the PER-TIM heterodimer which prevents the CLK-CYC heterodimer from binding to the E-boxes of per and tim, essentially blocking per and tim transcription. CLK is hyperphosphorylated when doubletime (DBT) kinase interacts with the CLK-CYC complex in a PER reliant manner, destabilizing both CLK and PER, leading to the degradation of both proteins. Hypophosphorylated CLK then accumulates, binds to the E-boxes of per and tim and activates their transcription once again. This cycle of post-translational phosphorylation suggest that temporal phosphorylation of CLK helps in the timing mechanism of the circadian clock. A similar model is found in mice, in which BMAL1 dimerizes with CLOCK to activate per and cryptochrome (cry) transcription. PER and CRY proteins form a heterodimer which acts on the CLOCK-BMAL heterodimer to repress the transcription of per and cry. The heterodimer CLOCK:BMAL1 functions similarly to other transcriptional activator complexes; CLOCK:BMAL1 interacts with the E-box regulatory elements. PER and CRY proteins accumulate and dimerize during subjective night, and translocate into the nucleus to interact with the CLOCK:BMAL1 complex, directly inhibiting their own expression. This research has been conducted and validated through crystallographic analysis. CLOCK exhibits histone acetyl transferase (HAT) activity, which is enhanced by dimerization with BMAL1. Dr. Paolo Sassone- Corsi and colleagues demonstrated in vitro that CLOCK mediated HAT activity is necessary to rescue circadian rhythms in Clock mutants. = Role in other feedback loops = The CLOCK-BMAL dimer is involved in regulation of other genes and feedback loops. An enzyme SIRT1 also binds to the CLOCK-BMAL complex and acts to suppress its activity, perhaps by deacetylation of Bmal1 and surrounding histones. However, SIRT1‚Äôs role is still controversial and it may also have a role in deacetylating PER protein, targeting it for degradation. The CLOCK-BMAL dimer acts as a positive limb of a feedback loop. The binding of CLOCK-BMAL to an E-box promoter element activates transcription of clock genes such as per1, 2, and 3 and tim in mice. It has been shown in mice that CLOCK-BMAL also activates the Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase gene (also called Nampt), part of a separate feedback loop. This feedback loop creates a metabolic oscillator. The CLOCK-BMAL dimer activates transcription of the Nampt gene, which codes for the NAMPT protein. NAMPT is part of a series of enzymatic reactions that covert niacin (also called nicotinamide) to NAD. SIRT1, which requires NAD for its enzymatic activity, then uses increased NAD levels to suppress BMAL1 through deacetylation. This suppression results in less transcription of the NAMPT, less NAMPT protein, less NAD made, and therefore less SIRT1 and less suppression of the CLOCK-BMAL dimer. This dimer can again positively activate the Nampt gene transcription and the cycle continues, creating another oscillatory loop involving CLOCK-BMAL as positive elements. The key role that Clock plays in metabolic and circadian loops highlights the close relationship between metabolism and circadian clocks.  Mutants  Clock mutant organisms can either possess a null mutation or an antimorphic allele at the Clock locus that codes for an antagonist to the wild-type protein. The presence of an antimorphic protein downregulates the transcriptional products normally upregulated by Clock. =Drosophila= In Drosophila, a mutant form of Clock (Jrk) was identified by Allada, Hall, and Rosbash in 1998. The team used forward genetics to identify non-circadian rhythms in mutant flies. Jrk results from a premature stop codon that eliminates the activation domain of the CLOCK protein. This mutation causes dominant effects: half of the heterozygous flies with this mutant gene have a lengthened period of 24.8 hours, while the other half become arrhythmic. Homozygous flies lose their circadian rhythm. Furthermore, the same researchers demonstrated that these mutant flies express low levels of PER and TIM proteins, indicating that Clock functions as a positive element in the circadian loop. While the mutation affects the circadian clock of the fly, it does not cause any physiological or behavioral defects. The similar sequence between Jrk and its mouse homolog suggests common circadian rhythm components were present in both Drosophila and mice ancestors. A recessive allele of Clock leads to behavioral arrhythmicity while maintaining detectable molecular and transcriptional oscillations. This suggests that Clk contributes to the amplitude of circadian rhythms. = Mice = The mouse homolog to the Jrk mutant is the ClockŒî19 mutant that possesses a deletion in exon 19 of the Clock gene. This dominant-negative mutation results in a defective CLOCK-BMAL dimer, which causes mice to have a decreased ability to activate per transcription. In constant darkness, ClockŒî19 mice heterozygous for the Clock mutant allele exhibit lengthened circadian periods, while ClockŒî19/Œî19 mice homozygous for the allele become arrhythmic. In both heterozygotes and homozygotes, this mutation also produces lengthened periods and arrhythmicity at the single-cell level. Clock -/- null mutant mice, in which Clock has been knocked out, display completely normal circadian rhythms. The discovery of a null Clock mutant with a wild-type phenotype directly challenged the widely accepted premise that Clock is necessary for normal circadian function. Furthermore, it suggested that the CLOCK-BMAL1 dimer need not exist to modulate other elements of the circadian pathway. Neuronal PAS domain containing protein 2 (NPAS2, a CLOCK paralog) can substitute for CLOCK in these Clock-null mice. Mice with one NPAS2 allele showed shorter periods at first, but eventual arrhythmic behavior.  Observed effects  In humans, a polymorphism in Clock, rs6832769, may be related to the personality trait agreeableness. Another single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Clock, 3111C, has been associated with diurnal preference. This SNP is also associated with increased insomnia, difficulty losing weight, and recurrence of major depressive episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. In mice, Clock has been implicated in sleep disorders, metabolism, pregnancy, and mood disorders. Clock mutant mice sleep less than normal mice each day. The mice also display altered levels of plasma glucose and rhythms in food intake. These mutants develop metabolic syndrome symptoms over time. Furthermore, Clock mutants demonstrate disrupted estrous cycles and increased rates of full-term pregnancy failure. Mutant Clock has also been linked to bipolar disorder-like symptoms in mice, including mania and euphoria. Clock mutant mice also exhibit increased excitability of dopamine neurons in reward centers of the brain. These results have led Dr. Colleen McClung to propose using Clock mutant mice as a model for human mood and behavior disorders. The CLOCK-BMAL dimer has also been shown to activate reverse-erb receptor alpha (Rev-ErbA alpha) and retinoic acid orphan receptor alpha (ROR-alpha). REV-ERBŒ± and RORŒ± regulate Bmal by binding to retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) in its promoter. Variations in the epigenetics of the Clock gene may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer. It was found that in women with breast cancer, there was significantly less methylation of the Clock promoter region. It was also noted that this effect was greater in women with estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative tumors. The CLOCK gene may also be a target for somatic mutations in microsatellite unstable colorectal cancers. Approximately half of putative novel microsatellite instability target genes responsible for colorectal cancer contained CLOCK mutations. Nascent research in the expression of circadian genes in adipose tissue suggests that suppression of the CLOCK gene may causally correlate not only with obesity, but also with type 2 diabetes, with quantitative physical responses to circadian food intake as potential inputs to the clock system.

Poulakas was professionally concerned primarily with scenography and secondarily with painting.  Personal life  His family was of modest means. He was a highly promising pupil, earning a scholarship and transferred at the age of fourteen from Volos to Constantinople, where he finished high school and studied drawing, scenography and music. Poulakas studied Byzantine art, as well as the various European artistic movements of the time. He married, Angeliki Haidas (1871‚Äì1962). The couple produced three sons, George (1888‚Äì1918), Konstantinos (1891‚Äì1924) and Michael (1894‚Äì1965) and two daughters Maria Poulakas-Vrettos (1903‚Äì1997) and Merope Poulakas-Loizou (1906‚Äì1993). Poulakas' liberal political ideas cost him teaching positions during 1916‚Äì1917 and 1927‚Äì1928. He died of pulmonary edema in Athens in February 1942.  Career  = Constantinople 1878‚Äì1885 = He found occupational opportunities in the theatre, especially during the last two years of his residence in Constantinople.

Poulakas worked initially as an apprentice in a workshop for painting, woodwork and production of theatrical sets and later as a scenographer and stage technician in the Hellenic amateur theatre, which was in bloom at the time and in various performances of the leading professional Hellenic theatrical companies that toured in Constantinople. = Athens (1885‚Äì1901) = In 1885 he returned to Volos to join the army. He was immediately transferred to Athens to serve in the Artillery Band as a musician. In 1888 he decided to stay in the army until 1890. This enlistment, together with his settling in Athens in Angeliki's family home, made it possible for him to extend his studies at the Athens School of the Fine Arts, attending painting courses by Nikiforos Lytras and perspective drawing by Vicenzo Lanza, from which he graduated with honorsChryssa Drantakis, \\"The Sea as Painting Theme\\", Tribute for the magazine IN VOLOS, No 3. 2001. in 1891. He was in contact with Konstantinos Volanakis, who became his close friend when he removed with his family to Piraeus about 1895. They used to exchange photographs and engravings of marine themes. However, no evidence confirms a teacher-student relationship between Volanakis and Poulakas.Manolis Vlachos, \\"The New Hellenic Painting in the Collection of the Bank of Greece\\", Athens 2007, p 540. although this is alleged in other sources,\\"Dictionary of Greek Artists\\", Vol IV, Melissa Athens 2000. presumably due to their academic painting style and common use of marine themes. Poulakas‚Äô wife described their relationship as one of sincere friendship and mutual appreciation. Between 1883 and 1903 when Volanakis taught Elementary Graphistics in the School of Arts Poulakas attended other courses and when Volonakis founded his \\"Cultural Center\\" for young painters in Piraeus about 1895,Marilena Kassimatis, \\"Konstantinos Volanakis, a Sea Poet¬ª, Album, 2009, Edition of the Institute Ekaterini Laskaridis and Pireaus Naval Museum. Poulakas had finished his studies and was already working as a painter and scenographer. Poulakas' paintings of this period, published in several art catalogues and websites, including Attica Shores,Attica Shores Young Angler Young Angler and Fisherman at dawnFisherman at dawn and many paintings of three-masted sailing ships, such as Three-masted shipThree-masted ship Poulakas practiced icon painting from his early years, following an academic and naturalistic style. According to historical sources Poulakas is the first modern Thessalian icon painter.Fotis Voyatzis,\\"Thessalian Painting: 1500‚Äì1980\\", Athens 1980. His name became known in Athens and he began getting orders in 1890. For two years he worked with Othon Giavopoulos, a folk painter from Vytina (Greece), whom Poulakas introduced to the academic style.Nicholaos Graikos, \\"Academic Trends of the 19th century Ecclesiastical Painting in Greece.\\" AUTH 2011. Besides painting, Poulakas worked professionally as a scenographer. His works are known mainly from the testimony of his wife and descendants, since at that time the name of the scenographer was not recorded in theatrical programs and posters. His known early employment includes the following productions: * The Fate of Maroula, a romantic comedy by Dimitrios Koromilas (1850‚Äì1898), starring Dionyssios Tavoularis (1840‚Äì1928) and Evangelos Pantopoulos (1860‚Äì1913) in 1889, presenting the inaugural show for the Hellenic Theater in the new wooden theatre in Neo Faliro. * The Shepherdess‚Äôs Sweetheart, a pastoral drama by the same author, launched by the Tavoularis brothers in 1892. * The Fairy of the Castle, a romance by Dimitrios Kampouroglous, presented by Tavoularis and Pantopoulos in 1894. After this he regularly created scenographies for the Ancient and New Hellenic Theatres at the Municipal Theatre of Piraeus, which was inaugurated in April 1895 with the famous contemporary play Maria Doxapatri by Dimitrios Vernardakis (1833‚Äì1907), presented by Tavoularis, with scenography by Poulakas. The screen of the last act, \\"Sun‚Äôs Chariot\\", part of his scenography for the tragedy of Medea in 1895, survived in the warehouse of the Municipal Theatre of Piraeus at least until 1970. = Volos 1901‚Äì1924 = In 1901 Poulakas left Athens for Volos to become professor of Sketching and Calligraphy in the Commercial School and the Girls' School of Volos. Poulakas established his studio in an alley in the port section of Volos and exhibited his work at a central store; soon after he started to give private painting lessons. He created seascapes (mainly views of the port and the Volos seashore), landscapes, portraits, scenography and icons, as well as teaching. His landscapes displayed Pelion, Karditsa, Itea and Galaxidi and his seascapes included the islands of Crete, Skopelos, Chios and Corfu. Son George was killed in battle in 1918 in World War I. Several important painters had their first lessons from Poulakas, including Konstantinos Zimeris (1886‚Äì1982) and Aristomenes Angelopoulos (1900‚Äì1990). Sea Battle of Itea Notable works of this period include Port of Chios (Commercial Bank of Greece), The Sea Battle of Itea (Bank of Greece), Portrait of Ioannis Kartalis (Municipal Art Gallery of Volos), Dockside of Volos (Katsigras), Port of Galaxidi, Fishing on seashore near Port of Volos and Sailing Scooner. In 1920 he produced The Sea Battle of Volos 1827, (Volos Municipal Art Gallery). He worked on icons from 1901 on in Magnesia, Thessaly and Sterea Hellas, as well as in Karditsa, Galaxidi and Itea. Saints Constantine and Helen, (1911) is at the temple of the Metropolitan Church of Karditsa. Saint George adorns the outer northern lintel at his hometown church. The flight into Egypt (1922) is at the Church of St. John in Upper Gatzea of Volos. Adoration of the Magi (1923) is at the Church of Saint Athanasius in Lehonia of Volos. The Exaltation of the Holy Cross and Bridegroom Christ are at the Cathedral of St Nicholas in Galaxidi. the earthquake of 1955 destroyed the Church of the Ascension of Christ in Volos along with his icon and woodcarving. From 1901 to 1924 he worked as a scenographer in Volos, Karditsa, Larissa and other cities of Thessaly. Only a few notes and family testimonies survive, describing: Merope, a drama by Dimitrios Vernardakis, and When the wife is beautiful, a comedy with a performance by Pantopoulos, presented in the Municipal Theatre of Volos in 1908, as well as Shakespeare's \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" performed by the company of Vassilia Stefanou and the revue, Panorama of Volos in the Theater Polytheama in 1910 and 1911, respectively. = Athens 1924‚Äì1942 = In 1924 Poulakas went to Athens to care for his dying son, Konstantinos, who suffered from tuberculosis. This loss led him to move to Athens, where he taught sketching and painting in public high schools and cultural centers1st High School and Philological Association Panrassos and was a visiting instructor in the School of Fine Arts. His studio was on Glafcou Street near the First Cemetery of Athens, then on Zacharitsa Street in the Veikou district, and finally on Shehou Street in the Kalliroi district. From 1930 until 1932 he taught in the Commercial School at Hermoupolis on the island of Syros. He generally avoided new approaches to painting to protect his income. Nonetheless, impressionism is evident in some of his published works, such as Attica Shore (1894) and Panormos Seashore in Scopelos (P. Moraitis). Poulakas- giannis-sea-painting-with-boat Between 1924 and his death he painted seascapes and landscapes and views of sites in Athens. Works include the heroic sailing ship Leonidas that fought in the Greek War of Independence (Leventis), Fishing Boat on Seashore (Museum A. K. Damtsa, Art Center Giorgio de Chirico, Volos) and Brig and Steamer, which appeared on a Greek postage stamp in 1969. Also in this period he painted the old training sailing ship of the Royal Hellenic Navy,Aris and Acropolis, a view of the Parthenon from the vicinity of the Temple of Olympian Zeus. Poulakas icons appear in the chapel of the Panaghia Spiliotissa on the Acropolis of Athens. In 1930 he left to teach in the Commercial School of Syros.

Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology. (10th ed.). Saunders. . The intensity of anal itching increases from moisture, pressure, and rubbing caused by clothing and sitting. At worst, anal itching causes intolerable discomfort that often is accompanied by burning and soreness. It is estimated that up to 5% of the population of the United States experiences this type of discomfort daily. Causes If a specific cause for pruritus ani is found it is classified as \\"secondary pruritus ani\\". If a specific cause is not found it is classified as \\"idiopathic pruritus ani\\". The irritation can be caused by intestinal parasites, anal perspiration, frequent liquid stools, diarrhea, residual stool deposits, or the escape of small amounts of stool as a result of incontinence or flatulence. Another cause is yeast infection or candidiasis. Some diseases increase the possibility of yeast infections, such as diabetes mellitus or HIV infection. Treatment with antibiotics can bring about a disturbance of the natural balance of intestinal flora, and lead to perianal thrush, a yeast infection affecting the anus. Psoriasis also can be present in the anal area and cause irritation. Abnormal passageways (fistulas) from the small intestine or colon to the skin surrounding the anus can form as a result of disease (such as Crohn's disease), acting as channels which may allow leakage of irritating fluids to the anal area. Other problems that can contribute to anal itching include pinworms, hemorrhoids, tears of the anal skin near the mucocutaneous junction (fissures), and skin tags (abnormal local growth of anal skin). Aside from diseases relative to the condition, a common view suggests that the initial cause of the itch may have passed, and that the illness is in fact prolonged by what is known as an itch-scratch-itch cycle. It states that scratching the itch encourages the release of inflammatory chemicals, which worsen redness, intensifies itchiness and increases the area covered by dry skin, thereby causing a snowball effect. Some authorities describe ‚Äúpsychogenic pruritus‚Äù or \\"functional itch disorder\\", where psychological factors may contribute to awareness of itching. Ingestion of pinworm eggs leads to enterobiasis, indicative of severe itching around the anus from migration of gravid females from the bowel. Severe cases of enterobiasis result in hemorrhage and eczema. Diagnosis Diagnosis is usually done with a careful examination of the anus and the patient's history. If the presentation or physical findings are atypical, biopsies can be done. In case of long-lasting symptoms, above all in patients over 50 years of age, a colonoscopy is useful to rule out a colonic polyp or tumor, that can show pruritus ani as first symptom. Treatment The goal of treatment is asymptomatic, intact, dry, clean perianal skin with reversal of morphological changes. For pruritus ani of unknown cause (idiopathic pruritus ani) treatment typically begins with measures to reduce irritation and trauma to the perianal area. Stool softeners can help prevent constipation. If this is not effective topical steroids or injected methylene blue may be tried. Another treatment option that has been met with success in small-scale trials is the application of a very mild (.006) topical capsaicin cream. This strength cream is not typically commercially available and therefore must be diluted by a pharmacist or end-user. If the itchiness is secondary to another condition such as infection or psoriasis these are typically treated. A successful treatment option for chronic idiopathic pruritus ani has been documented using a clean, dry and apply (if necessary) method. The person is instructed to follow this procedure every time the urge to scratch occurs. The treatment makes the assumption that there is an unidentified bacteria in the feces that causes irritation and itching when the feces makes contact with the anal and perianal skin during defecation, flatulation or anal leakage (particularly during sleep). Cleaning the area with warm water, avoiding all soaps and even baby wipes, then drying the area, ideally with a hair dryer to avoid irritation or failing that simply patting gently with a clean, dry, towel. If persons with pruritus ani do not need to scratch after these steps they are instructed to do nothing else. If the urge to scratch is still present they are instructed to apply a topical steroid cream which has antibiotic and antifungal properties. This will address a skin condition which may have become infected. Apply such a cream as directed by your medical professional but usually twice a day for one to two weeks. After this, they must maintain their clean and dry regime and apply an emollient ointment (not cream) to moisturize the skin. This should be applied after each bowel movement and at night. Continue until no longer needed. At any time, persons may use antihistamine treatments orally, to control the itching.

Established in 1630, it is the oldest graveyard in the city and is a site on the Freedom Trail. Despite its name, the graveyard pre-dates the adjacent King's Chapel (whose first structure was built in 1688); it is not affiliated to that or any other church.Boston Parks and Recreation History King's Chapel Burying Ground was founded in 1630 as the first graveyard in the city of Boston. According to custom, the first interment was that of the land's original owner, Isaac Johnson. It was Boston's only burial site for 30 years (1630‚Äì1660). After being unable to locate land elsewhere, in 1686 the newly established local Anglican congregation was allotted land in the graveyard to build King's Chapel. Today there are 505 headstones and 59 footstones remaining from the more than one thousand people buried in the small space since its inception. There are also 78 tombs, of which 36 have markers. This includes the large vault, built as a charnel house, which was converted into a tomb for children's remains in 1833. The earliest tombs are scattered among the grave markers.

More than a decade after his \\"retirement\\", Laurie has been dressed three times as an emergency NHL backup goaltender; first in the 2012‚Äì13 season for the Anaheim Ducks, and then during the 2013‚Äì14 season for both the Vancouver Canucks and Minnesota Wild. Career After a four-year career at Western Michigan University, Laurie joined the Roanoke Valley Rampage of the East Coast Hockey League in 1992. Laurie spent the majority of his career (1992‚Äì97) in the ECHL, with stops in Roanoke Valley, Dayton, Johnstown, Greensboro, Toledo, Tallahassee, and Huntington. Laurie finished his career splitting time between the WPHL, UHL, and Central Hockey League, all with teams based in Texas. After a season with the El Paso Buzzards in which Laurie compiled an 11-8-0 record in 22 games, Laurie retired at the completion of the 2001-02 CHL season. =National Hockey League= On April 5, 2013, with goaltenders Jonas Hiller out of the lineup due to an illness, the Anaheim Ducks recalled Igor Bobkov from their AHL affiliate in Norfolk. However, with Bobkov's flight running late and the Ducks still needing a backup goaltender, the Ducks signed 42 year old Laurie to a one-day professional tryout contract. Laurie ended up dressing as the backup goalie for the first 3:53 and was eventually replaced by Bobkov as the team's backup goaltender. During his brief appearance with the Ducks, Laurie wore jersey number 43. On January 5, 2014, Laurie was once again called to emergency goaltender duty. This time by the Vancouver Canucks in their road game against the Anaheim Ducks, serving as a backup to Eddie Lack. On March 31, 2014, following an injury to Darcy Kuemper during morning skate, Laurie was signed by the Minnesota Wild to a professional tryout contract and dressed for their game against the Los Angeles Kings as backup to Ilya Bryzgalov.http://www.startribune.com/sports/blogs/253279371.html Laurie was paid for each of the three games for which he dressed. Inline hockey Laurie was the starting goaltender for the Anaheim Bullfrogs on July 2, 1993 in the first professional sporting event played in the now-Honda Center. The Bullfrogs were a professional inline hockey team that played their home games in the former Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim from 1993 until 1997.

Written by Tony Barwick and directed by Alan Perry, it was first broadcast on 8 December 1967 on ATV Midlands. In this episode, a group of human bank robbers attempt to outwit Spectrum as the Mysterons threaten to destroy the \\"heart of New York\\". As with \\"Winged Assassin\\" and \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\", similarities between the plot of the episode and the September 11 attacks caused it to be postponed for several weeks during BBC Two's 2001‚Äì2002 re-run of the series. Plot Bank robbers Kruger, Doig and Carl break into the Spectrum Security Vaults but are disappointed to find only classified information of no material value. Nevertheless, Kruger is fascinated by documents describing Earth's war with the Mysterons, and devises a plan to exploit it. Meanwhile, the Mysterons inform Spectrum that they have studied human greed and corruption and that they now intend to destroy the \\"heart of New York\\". As the city's population is evacuated and its perimeter roadblocked, Captains Scarlet and Blue (voiced by Francis Matthews and Ed Bishop) search the deserted streets for concealed explosive devices. Driving through forest, Kruger, Doig and Carl stop at a fire tower and feign drunkenness in front of the lookout. They then destroy their car by sending it over a cliff edge, leading the lookout to believe that they have been killed in a drink-driving accident. Returning to the tower, they tell the lookout that they are Mysteron reconstructions and intend to destroy the Second National Bank of New York. When the lookout's story reaches Cloudbase, Colonel White (voiced by Donald Gray) decides that he will not risk lives to protect the bank and orders all Spectrum personnel to retreat to the roadblocks. Having acquired another car, Kruger, Doig and Carl drive up to a roadblock manned by Captains Magenta and Ochre (voiced by Gary Files and Jeremy Wilkin). They present false FBI identification and claim to be on official business that has nothing to do with the Second National Bank. Ochre's Mysteron Detector shows them to be human and Magenta permits them to enter the city. The men arrive at the bank aiming to steal the entire East Coast gold reserve. However, they have been followed by Captain Black (voiced by Donald Gray), who locks them inside a vault and warns them that the bank will soon be destroyed. Learning of the men's arrival, Scarlet is puzzled how a group of supposed government agents knew that the Mysterons were specifically targeting the bank when only Spectrum personnel had been informed. Realising that they are the men who confronted the fire lookout, and that they evidently faked their deaths and are now about to get away with robbery, Scarlet and Blue speed to the bank in their Spectrum Patrol Car but turn around when they see Black driving the men's car in the opposite direction. As the Mysterons use their powers to teleport Black to safety, the bank is destroyed in an explosion, killing the thieves. Back on Cloudbase, White concedes that Kruger, Doig and Carl exemplified the greed and corruption denounced by the Mysterons, but insists that the good of humanity will eventually prevail over the Martian evil. Production The Mysteron's vanishing power is seen for the first time in this episode. It is also featured in \\"Model Spy\\", \\"Expo 2068\\" and \\"Inferno\\". The exterior of the Second National Bank was designed by special effects assistant Mike Trim. This episode contains a number of continuity errors. In the puppet shots of Scarlet, Blue and Black driving through New York, trees and bushes are seen in the background, yet in the corresponding scale model shots no plants are shown. When Kruger, Doig and Carl tell the fire lookout that they are Mysteron reconstructions, Kruger's jacket changes colour between the puppet shots and the live-action close-ups. The marionette that plays Kruger was one of the most frequently used \\"revamp\\" puppets of the late-1960s Supermarionation productions: its other appearances in Captain Scarlet alone include \\"Winged Assassin\\", \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\", \\"Point 783\\", \\"Avalanche\\", \\"The Trap\\" and \\"Special Assignment\\". It would later appear as the commander in the Joe 90 episode \\"Arctic Adventure\\" and the Dreisenberg ambassador in \\"A Case for the Bishop\\", the first episode of The Secret Service. In contrast, the puppet that plays Doig was never used again. The Carl puppet previously appeared as Lieutenant Belmont in \\"White As Snow\\" while the fire lookout puppet played Major Brooks in \\"Point 783\\" and Air Commodore Goddard in \\"The Trap\\". A modified version of the puppet that plays the Spectrum Security Vaults guard would later appear as the regular character of Shane Weston in Joe 90. Broadcast and reception When BBC Two began a repeat run of Captain Scarlet in September 2001, \\"The Heart of New York\\" was originally due to be broadcast as the 11th episode. However, along with \\"Winged Assassin\\" and \\"Big Ben Strikes Again\\" it was later postponed due to perceived similarities between the plot and the September 11 attacks. Like the other two episodes, it was eventually broadcast several weeks after its intended transmission date. =Critical response= James Stansfield of Den of Geek considers \\"The Heart of New York\\" to be the second-best episode of Captain Scarlet, describing the episode as \\"memorable and unique\\" because \\"the Mysterons [are not] really the villains\\". He compliments the scenes depicting the evacuation of New York City, calling the silence \\"eerie\\", and praises \\"The Heart of New York\\" overall as a \\"great episode with a really different storyline to it\\".

Al- Basus, like any other Arab at that time, considered this as great insult to her honor which started a chain of events that led to the war.^ ÿ´ŸÖÿßÿ± ÿßŸÑŸÇŸÑŸàÿ® ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ∂ÿßŸÅ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜÿ≥Ÿàÿ® ÿßŸÑÿ´ÿπÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿä ÿµ 95 The Taghlib and Bakr tribes fought for roughly forty years (from 494-534 CE), locked in a perpetual cycle of vengeance. In parts of the Arab world today, the Basus War has been incorporated into an aphorism warning people against vendettas.The Detailed History of Arabs Prior to Islam by Jawad Ali, Baghdad University 1993 The story The story happened long before the Islamic era in Arabia, the start of the 40-year war was when a woman called Al-Basous, went to visit her niece, Jalila bint Murrah, along with her nephew, Jassas ibn Murrah, all of them belonged to the tribe of Bakr. Jalila was married to Kulayb, the leader of the Taghleb tribe, who was known to be extremely protective of his property and land. He saw Al- Basous' foreign camel in his territory, and shot it with an arrow. Al-Basous in turn got furious and exaggeratingly complained to her nephew that she was humiliated and insulted by this act. Jassas, enraged by his aunt‚Äôs words went to the leader of Taghleb, his brother in-law in the wild, and shot him with a spear from the back, a sign of cowardice and betrayal to Antiquity Arabs. Jasas was scared of his deed, and ran off, Amr or Omar (Jasas' friend) stayed there. Kulaib asked for water, but Amr shook his head in awe and chased after his friend. Kulaib stayed in the wild for 1 hour waking, screaming for help, dying. After 30 mins of walking in the wilderness, he finds a shepherd, who gives him water, Kulaib asks him to check if the wound is fatal, the shepherd refuses, kulaib forces him to, so the shepherd does, and sure enough, its fatal. Kulaib gets mad and asks his Good to revenge from Bakr and Jasas, then it is said that he either tells the shepherd a poem telling Alzeer Salem to take revenge or he uses this blood to write in Arabic on a cliff wall his will to his brother, Alzeer Salem. This triggered the war between the two tribes. Later on in the war, one of Bakr‚Äôs allies, a tribe leader called Al-Harith ibn Abbad, thought that he would not drag himself and his people into this silly war, over and above, he took an initiative to stop the blood-shed by sending his son, Ojayr, to now leader of Taghleb and brother of the late Kulayb, Al- Mohalhal/Alzeer Salem, for truce. It was a tradition at that time to send someone of great significance to sacrifice himself for the killing of someone, and it was expected that he would then be forgiven to start peace. But unexpectedly, and away from traditions and ethics, Al-Mohalhal kills Ojayr! The mourning father said a poem of 40 verses, stating that he is now part of it (the war). He ordered his men to shave their heads, and he cut his horse‚Äôs mane and tail hair, which became a tradition since then among the Arabs as a sign of grief until revenge. The war almost ended the last few of Taghleb, and Al-Harith said his famous word, I will not talk to Taghleb until earth talks to me, i.e never! When Taghleb thought it was the end, they dug a trench along the road where Al-Harith ibn Abbad passes by, a man from Taghleb hid there and sang a poem asking for forgiveness, and fulfilling the condition of the earth talking to Al-Harith. At the time he had avenged his son‚Äôs death, and didn‚Äôt have to go back on his word (\\"I will not talk to Taghleb until earth talks to me\\"). The 40 years war had ended.

Mark Thompson (played by Roy Newton) leaves Los Angeles and moves with his mother to the Big Island and befriends three \\"locals\\", Ronnie (Lorenzo Callendar), Zulu (Kalani) and Keao (Daryl Bonilla). At the same time, he is bullied and harassed for being a \\"haole\\" or foreigner. The three lead characters were also inspired by Cunningham's real life high school friends, as seen in the ending credits. The film is dedicated to Donald Boy (Ronnie), Zulu (Zulu), while Keao was a composite of two friends combining the humor of one friend and the drug element of another into one character. Production Under the working title of \\"Kama'aina\\", the movie was filmed with a modest budget from December 26, 1996 to February 5, 1997. Cunningham had a hand in most aspects of the film's production, including distributing it. Release and reshooting The movie premiered at the Honolulu International Film Festival in November 1997. After a few screenings in L.A., Cunningham shot some additional footage, including scenes involving Mark's father and his friends in L.A. The film had a limited theatrical release in 1999. The DVD did not come out until 2003; it does not include the scenes that were added for the 1999 release. The DVD lacks extras and commentaries, but includes the theatrical trailer. According to Variety, while the acting by the lead Newton in the film needed work (his three co-stars were praised), it was visually stunning and had an excellent soundtrack.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002. p. 249. Plot summary Luigi Pirandello in 1906, two years after the novel's release. The protagonist, Mattia Pascal, finds that his promising youth has, through misfortune or misdeed, dissolved into a dreary dead-end job and a miserable marriage. His inheritance and the woman he loved are stolen from him by the same man, his eventual wife and mother-in-law badger him constantly, and his twin daughters, neglected by their mother, can provide him with joy only until an untimely death takes them. Death robs him even of his beloved mother. To escape, he decides one day to sneak off to Monte Carlo, where he encounters an amazing string of luck, acquiring a small fortune. While reading a newspaper on his return home, he discovers, to his immense shock and delight, that his wife and mother-in-law declared an unknown corpse to be his own. Faced with this sudden opportunity to start afresh, he first wanders about Europe, and finally settles down in Rome with an assumed identity. His character develops in unexpected, even admirable, ways. Yet one admirable act brings the protagonist a crisis, followed by additional crises that lead him to conclude that continuing with his plans will entail only misery for those he loves, precisely because his entire life, including the precious liberty he thought he had gained from his past, is now a lie. He ultimately decides to fake his own death and return to his original life. But even that proves difficult; his family and town have long since adjusted to his \\"death,\\" and his own adjustment of character prompts him to have mercy on his now remarried wife. So the twice-dead Late Mattia Pascal reduces himself to a figure outside the mainstream of society, a walk-on part in his own life. Adaptations Several film adaptations of the novel have been made: * Feu Mathias Pascal, a 1925 French silent film directed by Marcel L'Herbier. * L'Homme de nulle part (The Man from Nowhere), a 1937 French film directed by Pierre Chenal.

Powell when addressing the Commonwealth Club of Canada on 8 September 1920. Though he defined imperialism as \\"the sense of arbitrary and capricious domination over the bodies and souls of men,\\" yet he used the term \\"scientific imperialism\\" to mean \\"the subjection of all the developed and undeveloped powers of the earth to the mind of man.\\"Scientific Imperialism (an address), Delivered by Ellis T. Powell, LL.B. D.Sc. (1920) In modern parlance, however, scientific imperialism refers to situations in which critics perceive science to act imperiously. Philosopher of science John Dupr√© described it (in his 2001 book Human Nature and the Limits of Science, p. 74) as \\"the tendency to push a good scientific idea far beyond the domain in which it was originally introduced, and often far beyond the domain in which it can provide much illumination.\\" He also wrote (in his 1994 paper \\"Against Scientific Imperialism\\", p. 374) that \\"devotees of these approaches are inclined to claim that they are in possession not just of one useful perspective on human behavior, but of the key that will open doors to the understanding of ever wider areas of human behavior.\\" Scientific imperialism has also been charged against \\"those who believe that the study of politics can and should be modelled on the natural sciences, a position defended most forcibly in the United States, and those who have dissented, viewing this ambition as methodologically unjustified and ethically undesirable.\\"  Critique of power  Writing about scientific exploration by James Cook in the 18th century, the textbook Worlds Together, Worlds Apart defined scientific imperialism as the \\"pursuit of power through the pursuit of knowledge,\\".The Scientific Voyages of Captain Cook Arthur Peacocke wrote that its later pejorative use may reflect the frustration felt by some with \\"the limitations of reductive scientism (scientific imperialism).\\" He also questions the notion that \\"successful scientific theories are true or approximately true models of the world,\\" and expresses a desire to \\"dethrone science from an imperialistic stance over philosophy and theology.\\" Theologian and Christian apologist J. P. Moreland argues that \\"the myth that science is the model of truth and rationality still grips the mind of much of our popular and scientific culture\\", stating that \\"though philosophers of science over the past few decades have gutted many of the claims of this scientific imperialism, many thinkers, knee-jerk agnostics, and even judges persist in the grip of this notion.\\" (review)  Accusations of being the \\"religion of the intellectuals\\"  Behavioral psychologist J. E. R. Staddon defined scientific imperialism as \\"the idea that all decisions, in principle, can be made scientifically\\" and stated that it has become a \\"religion of the intellectuals\\". John Dupr√© also criticised \\"a natural tendency, when one has a successful scientific model, to attempt to apply it to as many problems as possible\\", and described these extended applications as being \\"dangerous\\".Dupr√©, John: The Disunity of Science (2006) Interviewed by Paul Newall Such notions have been compared to cultural imperialism, and to a rigid and intolerant form of intellectual monotheism.  Medical research  Medical doctor Peter Wilmshurst has used the term to describe \\"poor people in developing countries...being exploited in research for the benefit of patients in the developed world\\", and advised that \\"the scientific community has a responsibility to ensure that all scientific research is conducted ethically\\". Another accusation lies in the alleged misappropriation of indigenous drugs in poor countries by drug companies in the developed world. Pharmacologist Elaine Elisabetsky wrote that \\"ethnopharmacology involves a series of sociopolitical, economic and ethical dilemmas, at various levels...frequently host country scientists, visiting scientists, and informants disagree...research efforts are (often) perceived as scientific imperialism; scientists are accused of stealing plant materials and appropriating traditional plant knowledge for financial profit and/or professional advancement. Many governments, as well as indigenous societies are increasingly reluctant to permit such research...historically neither native populations nor host countries have shared to a significant extent the financial benefits from any drug that reaches the market...unless these issues are amply discussed and fairly resolved, medicinal plant research runs the risk of serving ethically questionable purposes.\\"  See also  * Antiscience * Antireductionism * Cultural imperialism * Experimental political science * Imperialism * Scientism * Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism  References   Further reading    Also in: .

Draper, 1997) * Buttered Bones (Sharon M. Draper, 1997)  Themes  Many of Draper's books for children and young adults contain mature and serious themes, such as death, grief, and abuse. Draper has said that she uses these themes as they are \\"the realities of life\\" for many young people. One major theme touched on in Draper's Out of My Mind, which tells the story of a young girl with cerebral palsy, is young people and disabilities. Vasan and Jose state that by writing through the eyes of a girl who cannot physically walk or talk, Draper empowers readers who have disabilities. For readers who do not have disabilities, experiencing a book through the eyes of someone who is disabled both fosters empathy and challenges readers to question society's connection between able-ness and intelligence. Another major theme in Draper's books, such as Forged by Fire and Romiette and Julio, is race. In Romiette and Julio, an African American girl and Hispanic boy begin dating, despite familial disapproval and threats from a local gang. Zonnenberg states that the story's focus on complex issues such as gang violence and interracial relationships encourages deep discussion by all readers. While Romiette and Julio puts the main characters' races at the forefront of the plot, Price notes that Draper takes the opposite approach in Forged by Fire. Price writes that while many characters in this book are African American, Draper focuses more on character actions. Because Draper centers more on narrative and character development, readers come away with a sense that race and ethnicity make up only one part of an individual's identity. Other novels by Draper that focus on race include Fire from the Rock, Stella by Starlight, and Blended.

DLD is a flavoprotein enzyme that oxidizes dihydrolipoamide to lipoamide. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) is a mitochondrial enzyme that plays a vital role in energy metabolism in eukaryotes. This enzyme is required for the complete reaction of at least five different multi-enzyme complexes. Additionally, DLD is a flavoenzyme oxidoreductase that contains a reactive disulfide bridge and a FAD cofactor that are directly involved in catalysis. The enzyme associates into tightly bound homodimers required for its enzymatic activity. File:Lipoamide-2D-skeletal.pngLipoamide File:Dihydrolipoamide.svgDihydrolipoamide  Structure  The protein encoded by the DLD gene comes together with another protein to form a dimer in the central metabolic pathway. Several amino acids within the catalytic pocket have been identified as important to DLD function, including R281 and N473. Although the overall fold of the human enzyme is similar to that of yeast, the human structure is different in that it has two loops that extend from the general protein structure and into the FAD binding sites when bound the NAD+ molecule, required for catalysis, is not close to the FAD moiety. However, when NADH is bound instead, it is stacked directly op top of the FAD central structure. The current hE3 structures show directly that the disease-causing mutations occur at three locations in the human enzyme: the dimer interface, the active site, and the FAD and NAD(+)-binding sites.  Function  The DLD homodimer functions as the E3 component of the pyruvate, Œ±-ketoglutarate, and branched-chain amino acid-dehydrogenase complexes and the glycine cleavage system, all in the mitochondrial matrix. In these complexes, DLD converts dihydrolipoic acid and NAD+ into lipoic acid and NADH. DLD also has diaphorase activity, being able to catalyze the oxidation of NADH to NAD+ by using different electron acceptors such as O2, labile ferric iron, nitric oxide, and ubiquinone. DLD is thought to have a pro-oxidant role by reducing oxygen to a superoxide or ferric to ferrous iron, which then catalyzes production of hydroxyl radicals. Diaphorase activity of DLD may have an antioxidant role through its ability to scavenge nitric oxide and to reduce ubiquinone to ubiquinol. The dihyrolipamide dehydrogenase gene is known to have multiple splice variants.  Moonlighting function  Certain DLD mutations can simultaneously induce the loss of a primary metabolic activity and the gain of a moonlighting proteolytic activity. The moonlighting proteolytic activity of DLD is revealed by conditions that destabilize the DLD homodimer and decrease its DLD activity. Acidification of the mitochondrial matrix, as a result of ischemia-reperfusion injury, can disrupt the quaternary structure of DLD leading to decreased dehydrogenase activity and increased diaphorase activity. The moonlighting proteolytic activity of DLD could also arise under pathological conditions. Proteolytic activity can further complicate the reduction in energy metabolism and an increase in oxidative damage as a result of decreased DLD activity and an increase in diaphorase activity respectively. With its proteolytic function, DLD removes a functionally vital domain from the N-terminus of frataxin, a mitochondrial protein involved in iron metabolism and antioxidant protection.  Clinical significance  In humans, mutations in DLD are linked to a severe disorder of infancy with failure to thrive, hypotonia, and metabolic acidosis. DLD deficiency manifests itself in a great degree of variability, which has been attributed to varying effects of different DLD mutations on the stability of the protein and its ability to dimerize or interact with other components of the three Œ±-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes. With its proteolytic function, DLD causes a deficiency in frataxin, which leads to the neurodegenerative and cardiac disease, Friedreich's ataxia. Future research hopes to assess how the proteolytic activity of DLD contributes to the symptoms of DLD deficiency, Friedreich ataxia, and ischemia reperfusion injury and whether this activity could be a target for therapy for these conditions.

In the United States this species has been located in southern California and Baja California Norte, Illinois, east through most of the United States from Maine to West Virginia to Florida. Also seen in the Cariboo region of British Columbia. Food plants The larvae feed on plants including honeysuckle, viburnum, hawthorn, snowberry, cherry, mint, and plum. Regional names Hemaris diffinis is notable for its colorful nicknames. In certain parts of Appalachia, including West Virginia, Hemaris diffinis is known as \\"hummingbird moth\\" or \\"flying lobster\\". These nicknames are derived from its supposed physical resemblance to other (genetically unrelated) animals.

Most rules of (lawn) tennis derive from this precursor and it is reasonable to see both sports as variations of the same game. Most historians believe that tennis originated in the monastic cloisters in northern France in the 12th century, but the ball was then struck with the palm of the hand; hence, the name jeu de paume (\\"game of the palm\\"). It was not until the 16th century that rackets came into use, and the game began to be called \\"tennis.\\" It was popular in England and France, and Henry VIII of England was a big fan of the game, now referred to as real tennis.Crego, Robert. Sports and Games of the 18th and 19th Centuries, page 115 (2003). Many original tennis courts remain, including courts at Oxford, Cambridge, Falkland Palace in Fife where Mary Queen of Scots regularly played, and Hampton Court Palace. Many of the French courts were decommissioned with the terror that accompanied the French Revolution. The Tennis Court Oath (Serment du Jeu de Paume) was a pivotal event during the first days of the French Revolution. The Oath was a pledge signed by 576 of the 577 members from the Third Estate who were locked out of a meeting of the Estates-General on 20 June 1789. The Davis Cup, an annual competition between men's national teams, dates to 1900. The analogous competition for women's national teams, the Fed Cup, was founded as the Federation Cup in 1963 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the founding of the International Tennis Federation, also known as the ITF. Promoter C. C. Pyle created the first professional tennis tour in 1926, with a group of American and French tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. The most notable of these early professionals were the American Vinnie Richards and the Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen.Open Minded ‚Äì Bruce Goldman Once a player turned pro he or she could not compete in the major (amateur) tournaments. In 1968, commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction, inaugurating the now known as the Open Era (see below), in which all players could compete in all tournaments, and top players were able to make their living from tennis.Tennis, professional tournaments before the Open Era With the beginning of the Open Era, the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit, and revenues from the sale of television rights, tennis's popularity has spread worldwide, and the sport has shed its upper/middle-class English-speaking image (although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists). Etymology The word tennis came into use in English in the mid-14th century from Old French, via the Anglo-Norman term Tenez, which can be translated as \\"hold!\\", \\"receive!\\" or \\"take!\\", a call from the server to his opponent indicating that he is about to serve. The first known appearance of the word in English literature is by poet John Gower in his poem titled 'In Praise of Peace' dedicated to King Henry IV and composed in 1400; \\"Of the tenetz to winne or lese a chase, Mai no lif wite er that the bal be ronne\\". (Whether a chase is won or lost at tennis, Nobody can know until the ball is run). Origin Real tennis racquets and balls. Cahusac at the Falkland Palace Royal Tennis Club. Tennis is mentioned in literature as far back as the Middle Ages. In The Second Shepherds' Play (c. 1500) shepherds gave three gifts, including a tennis ball, to the newborn Christ. Sir Gawain, a knight of King Arthur's round table, plays tennis against a group of 17 giants in The Turke and Gowin (c. 1500).Hahn, Thomas(1995). Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales. Medieval Institute Publications =Real tennis= The Medieval form of tennis is termed as real tennis, a game that evolved over three centuries, from an earlier ball game played around the 12th century in France which involved hitting a ball with a bare hand and later with a glove. By the 16th century, the glove had become a racket, the game had moved to an enclosed playing area, and the rules had stabilized. Real tennis spread in popularity throughout royalty in Europe, reaching its peak in the 16th century. In 1437 at the Blackfriars, Perth, the playing of tennis indirectly led to the death of King James I of Scotland, when the drain outlet, through which he hoped to escape assassins, had been blocked to prevent the loss of tennis balls.Roger Morgan, The silver ball of rattray: a note on an early form of tennis, The International Journal of the History of Sport, Vol. 8, Iss. 3, 1991 James was trapped and killed.McGladdery, The Kings & Queens of Scotland: James I, p. 143 Francis I of France (1515‚Äì47) was an enthusiastic player and promoter of real tennis, building courts and encouraging play among the courtiers and commoners. His successor Henry II (1547‚Äì59) was also an excellent player and continued the royal French tradition. In 1555 an Italian priest, Antonio Scaino da Salothe, wrote the first known book about tennis, Trattato del Giuoco della Palla. Two French kings died from tennis related episodes‚ÄîLouis X of a severe chill after playing and Charles VIII after hitting his head during a game. King Charles IX granted a constitution to the Corporation of Tennis Professionals in 1571, creating the first pro tennis 'tour', establishing three professional levels: apprentice, associate, and master. A professional named Forbet wrote and published the first codification of the rules in 1599. The Encyclopedia of Tennis, p. 17 Royal interest in England began with Henry V (1413‚Äì22). Henry VIII (1509‚Äì47) made the biggest impact as a young monarch; playing the game with gusto at Hampton Court on a court he built in 1530. It is believed that his second wife Anne Boleyn was watching a game when she was arrested and that Henry was playing when news of her execution arrived. During the reign of James I (1603‚Äì25), London had 14 courts. The Encyclopedia of Tennis, p. 18 Drawing of a Lawn Tennis court as originally designed by Major Walter Clopton Wingfield in 1874 Cover of the first edition of the book about Lawn Tennis by Walter Clopton Wingfield, published in February 1874 Tennis doubles final at 1896 Olympic Games Real tennis is mentioned in literature by William Shakespeare who mentions \\"tennis balles\\" in Henry V (1599), when a basket of them is given to King Henry as a mockery of his youth and playfulness; the incident is also mentioned in some earlier chronicles and ballads. Shakespeare, William (Early 1600s). The Chronicle History of King Henry the Fifth. Act 1, Scene 2 One of the most striking early references appears in a painting by Giambattista Tiepolo entitled The Death of Hyacinth (1752‚Äì1753) in which a strung racket and three tennis balls are depicted. The painting's theme is the mythological story of Apollo and Hyacinth, written by Ovid. Giovanni Andrea dell'Anguillara translated it into Italian in 1561 and replaced the ancient game of discus, in the original text with pallacorda or tennis, which had achieved a high status at the courts in the middle of the 16th century. Tiepolo's painting, displayed at the Museo Thyssen Bornemisza in Madrid, was ordered in 1752 by German count Wilhelm Friedrich Schaumburg Lippe, who was an avid tennis player. The game thrived among the 17th-century nobility in France, Spain, Italy, and in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, but suffered under English Puritanism. By the Age of Napoleon, the royal families of Europe were besieged and real tennis was largely abandoned. The Encyclopedia of Tennis, p. 21 Real tennis played a minor role in the history of the French Revolution, through the Tennis Court Oath, a pledge signed by French deputies on a real tennis court, which formed a decisive early step in starting the revolution. In England, during the 18th and early 19th centuries as real tennis declined, three other racket sports emerged: racquets, squash racquets, and lawn tennis (the modern game). Birth of lawn tennis Augurio Perera's house in Edgbaston, Birmingham, where he and Harry Gem first played the modern game of lawn tennis The lawyer and memoirist William Hickey recalled that in 1767 \\"in the summer we had another club, which met at the Red House in Battersea fields, nearly opposite Ranelagh.... The game we played was an invention of our own, and called field tennis, which afforded noble exercise.... The field, which was of sixteen acres in extent, was kept in as high an order, and smooth as a bowling green.\\"Quennell, Peter, ed. The Prodigal Rake: the Memoirs of William Hickey (1962) p.58. The modern sport is tied to two separate inventions. Between 1859 and 1865, in Birmingham, England, Major Harry Gem, a solicitor, and his friend Augurio Perera, a Spanish merchant, combined elements of the game of racquets and Basque pelota and played it on a croquet lawn in Edgbaston. Tyzack, Anna, The True Home of Tennis Country Life, 22 June 2005 Lawn Tennis and Major T. H. Gem Birmingham Civic Society In 1872, both men moved to Leamington Spa and in 1874, with two doctors from the Warneford Hospital, founded the world's first tennis club, the Leamington Tennis Club. In December 1873, Major Walter Clopton Wingfield designed an hourglass-shaped tennis court in order to obtain a patent on his court (as the rectangular court was already in use and was unpatentable). A temporary patent on this hourglass-shaped court was granted to him in February, 1874, which he never renewed when it expired in 1877. It is commonly believed, mistakenly, that Wingfield obtained a patent on the game he devised to be played on that type of court, but in fact Wingfield never applied for nor received a patent on his game, although he did obtain a copyright ‚Äî but not a patent ‚Äî on his rules for playing it. And, after a running series of articles and letters in the British sporting magazine The Field, and a meeting at London's Marylebone Cricket Club, the official rules of lawn tennis were promulgated by that Club in 1875, which preserved none of the aspects of the variations that Wingfield had dreamed up and called Sphaeristik√® (, that is, \\"sphere-istic\\", an ancient Greek adjective meaning \\"of or pertaining to use of a ball, globe or sphere\\"), which was soon corrupted to \\"sticky\\". Wingfield claimed that he had invented his version of the game for the amusement of his guests at a weekend garden party on his estate of Nantclwyd, in Llanelidan, Wales in 1874, but research has demonstrated that even his game was not likely played during that country weekend in Wales.The History of Tennis ‚Äì Mary Bellis He had likely based his game on both the evolving sport of outdoor tennis and on real tennis. Much of modern tennis terminology also derives from this period, for Wingfield and others borrowed both the name and much of the French vocabulary of real tennis, and applied them to their variations of real tennis. In the scholarly work Tennis: A Cultural History, Heiner Gillmeister reveals that on December 8 1874, Wingfield had wrote to Harry Gem, commenting that he‚Äôd been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis for a year and a half.[Leamington Tennis Court Club http://www.leamingtonrealtennis.co.uk/history-of-the-game/leamington-and- tennis.html] Gem himself had largely credited Perera with the invention of the game. Wingfield did patent his hourglass court in 1874, but not his eight- page rule book titled \\"Sphairistike or Lawn Tennis\\", but he failed in enforcing his patent. The Beginnings Of Lawn Tennis ‚Äì University of South Carolina Libraries In his version, the game was played on an hourglass-shaped court, and the net was higher (4 feet 8 inches) than it is in official lawn tennis. The service had to be made from a diamond-shaped box in the middle of one side of the court only, and the service had to bounce beyond the service line instead of in front of it. He adopted the rackets-based system of scoring where games consisted of 15 points (called 'aces'). None of these quirks survived the Marylebone Cricket Club's 1875 Rules of Lawn Tennis that have been official, with periodic slight modifications, ever since then. Those rules were adopted by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club for the first Lawn Tennis Championship, at Wimbledon in 1877 (the men who devised those rules were members of both clubs). Wingfield does deserve great credit for popularizing the game of lawn tennis, as he marketed, in one boxed set, all the equipment needed to play his or other versions of it, equipment that had been available previously only at several different outlets. Because of this convenience, versions of the game spread like wildfire in Britain, and by 1875 lawn tennis had virtually supplanted croquet and badminton as outdoor games for both men and women. Mary Ewing Outerbridge played the game in Bermuda at Clermont, a house with a spacious lawn in Paget parish. Innumerable histories claim that in 1874, Mary returned from Bermuda aboard the ship S.S. Canima and introduced lawn tennis to the United States, setting up supposedly the first tennis court in the United States on the grounds of the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, which was near where the Staten Island Ferry Terminal is today. The club was founded on or about March 22, 1872. She is also mistakenly said to have played the first tennis game in the US against her sister Laura in Staten Island, New York, on an hourglass-shaped court. However, all this would have been impossible, as the tennis equipment she is said to have brought back from Bermuda was not available in Bermuda until 1875, and her next trip to Bermuda, when it was available there, was in 1877. In fact, lawn tennis was first introduced in the United States on a grass court on Col. William Appleton's Estate in Nahant, Massachusetts by Dr. James Dwight (\\"the Father of American Lawn Tennis\\"), Henry Slocum, Richard Dudley Sears and Sears' half-brother Fred Sears, in 1874. Terminology Wingfield borrowed both the name and much of the French vocabulary of real tennis: * Tennis comes from the French tenez, the plural imperative form of the verb tenir, to hold, meaning \\"hold!\\", \\"receive!\\" or \\"take!\\", an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent to indicate that he is about to serve. *Racket (or racquet) derives from the Arabic rakhat, meaning the palm of the hand. * Deuce comes from √† deux le jeu, meaning \\"to both is the game\\" (that is, the two players have equal scores). * The origin of the use of Love for zero is disputed. It is ascribed to derive from \\"l'oeuf\\", the French word for \\"egg\\", traditionally representing the shape of a zero. Palmatier, Robert. Speaking of animals: a dictionary of animal metaphors, page 245 (1995). Horn, Geoffrey. Rafael Nadal, page 13 (2006). Another possibility is that it derives from the Dutch expression \\"iets voor lof doen\\", which means to do something for praise, implying no monetary stakes. * The reason for the numbering of scores being \\"15\\", \\"30\\" and \\"40\\" is unknown. Historical sources suggest the system was originally 15, 30, 45 with the 45 simplified to 40 over time. Common theories are that it originated from the quarters of a clock, or from gambling stakes. Tournaments and tours of the pre-Open Era =Amateur tournaments= The Four Majors The four majors or Grand Slam tournaments, the four biggest competitions on the tennis circuit, are Wimbledon, the US Open, the French Open, and the Australian Open. Since the mid 1920s they became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis.Grand Slam ‚Äì Australian Open Winning these four tournaments in the same year is called the Grand Slam (a term borrowed from bridge). =1877: Wimbledon= The Championships, Wimbledon, were founded by the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 1877 to raise money for the club. The first Championships were contested by 22 men and the winner received a Silver Gilt Cup proclaiming the winner to be \\"The All England Lawn Tennis Club Single Handed Champion of the World\\". The first Championships culminated a significant debate on how to standardize the rules. The following year it was recognized as the official British Championships, although it was open to international competitors. In 1884 the Ladies Singles and Gentlemen's Doubles Championships were inaugurated, followed by the Ladies and Mixed Doubles in 1913.

William Appleton in Nahant, Massachusetts by James Dwight, Richard Dudley Sears and Fred Sears in 1874. In 1881, the desire to play tennis competitively led to the establishment of tennis clubs. The first American National tournament was played in 1880 at the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club in New York. An Englishman named Otway Woodhouse won the singles match. There was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair. There were different rules at each club. The ball in Boston was larger than the one normally used in NY. On May 21, 1881, the United States National Lawn Tennis Association (now the United States Tennis Association) was formed to standardize the rules and organize competitions. The US National Men's Singles Championship, now the US Open, was first held in 1881 at Newport, Rhode Island. The U.S. National Women's Singles Championships were first held in 1887 in Philadelphia.Leading The Way ‚Äì BBC Sport The tournament was made officially one of the tennis 'Majors' from 1924 by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF).

Because of its geographic remoteness, historically, the event did not gain attendance from the top tennis players. It became one of the major tennis tournaments starting in 1924 (designated by the ILTF). In 1927, because of New Zealand tennis authorities releasing their commitments to the tournament, it became known as the Australian Championships. For most of the 1970s and the early 1980s, the event lacked participation from top ranked tennis professionals. Since its move to Melbourne Park in 1988, the Australian Open has gained the popularity of the other three majors.

Davis of the Harvard University tennis team designed a tournament format with the idea of challenging the British to a tennis showdown. The first match, between the United States and Great Britain was held in Boston, Massachusetts in 1900. The American team, of which Dwight Davis was a part, surprised the British by winning the first three matches. By 1905 the tournament had expanded to include Belgium, Austria, France, and Australasia, a combined team from Australia and New Zealand that competed jointly until 1913. The tournament was initially known as the \\"International Lawn Tennis Challenge\\". It was renamed the Davis Cup following the death of Dwight Davis in 1945. The tournament has vastly expanded and, on its 100th anniversary in 1999, 130 nations competed. International Tennis Federation 1896 Summer Olympics men's singles final 1913 also saw twelve national tennis associations agree at a Paris conference to form the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), which was renamed in 1977 as the current International Tennis Federation (ITF). History of The Davis Cup. Retrieved 2007-09-10. The rules the association promulgated in 1924 have remained remarkably stable in the ensuing ninety years, the one major change being the addition of the tie-break system designed by James Van Alen. That same year, tennis withdrew from the Olympics after the 1924 Games but returned 60 years later as a 21-and-under demonstration event in 1984. This reinstatement was credited by the efforts by the then ITF President Philippe Chatrier, ITF General Secretary David Gray and ITF Vice President Pablo Llorens, and support from IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch. The success of the event was overwhelming and the IOC decided to reintroduce tennis as a full medal sport at Seoul in 1988. The Fed Cup The idea of a Davis Cup-style tournament for national women's teams is surprisingly old‚Äîit was first proposed in 1919 by Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman. After she was turned down, she donated a trophy in 1923 that would be known as the Wightman Cup, awarded in an annual match between the two strongest women's tennis nations of the time, the United States and Great Britain. Wightman's original idea for a worldwide women's team tournament would bear fruit more than 40 years later in 1962, when Nell Hopman persuaded the ITF to begin sponsoring such an event. The first Federation Cup was played in 1963 as part of the ITF's 50th anniversary celebrations; it involved 16 countries and was played over one week. By the 1990s, over 70 nations competed each year, and regional qualifiers were introduced in 1992. In 1995, the ITF introduced a new Davis Cup-style format for the competition and rechristened it the Fed Cup. =The Professional circuit= In 1926, promoter C. C. Pyle established the first professional tour with a group of American and French players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. The most notable early professionals were American Vinnie Richards and Frenchwoman Suzanne Lenglen. Once a player turned pro he or she could not compete in the major (amateur) tournaments. Before the Open Era, the leading professional players were under contract with a professional promoter who controlled their appearances. For example, in 1926 Lenglen and Richards toured North America along with Paul F√©ret and Mary K. Browne under contract to Charles C. Pyle. The main events of the professional circuit comprised head-to-head competition and by-invitation Pro Championships, which were the equivalent of the Grand Slam tournaments on the professional circuit. Although Suzanne Lenglen was the leading player in the first year of the professional circuit, after she retired in February 1927 very few female players played on the professional circuit before the Open Era. Pro tours In the years before the Open Era, professionals often played more frequently on head-to-head tours than in tournaments because tours paid much better than tournaments and the number of professional tournaments was small. For example, Fred Perry earned U.S. $91,000 ($ today) in a 1937 North American tour against Ellsworth Vines but won only U.S. $450 ($) for his 1938 victory at the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships. Vines probably never entered a tournament in 1937 and 1938. In 1937, Vines played 70 matches on two tours and no tournament matches. Even in the 1950s, some professionals continued to play tour matches. During his first five months as a professional (January through May 1957), Ken Rosewall played 76 matches on a tour against Pancho Gonzales but only 9 tournament matches. Joe McCauley determined that for 1952, only 7 professional tournaments were played by the top international players, and 2 other professional tournaments (the British Pro and the German Pro) were reserved for domestic players. Only during the 1960s did professional tournaments become more significant than tours. Pro Championships (Pro Slams) In addition to head-to-head events several annual professional tournaments were called championship tournaments. The most prestigious was usually the Wembley Championship, held at the Wembley Arena in England, played between 1934 and 1990. The oldest was the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships, played between 1927 and 1999. Between 1954 and 1962, it was played indoors in Cleveland and was called the World Professional Championships. The third major tournament was the French Pro Championship, played between 1930 and 1968. The British and American championships continued into the Open Era but devolved to the status of minor tournaments after the late 1960s. The Tournament of Champions was held between 1956 and 1959, the 1956 edition taking place in Los Angeles and the 1957, 1958 and 1959 editions taking place at Forest Hills. There was also the Wimbledon Pro tournament held in August 1967, the first tournament where professional tennis players were allowed to play at Wimbledon. Open Era The French Championships at Roland Garros was the first Grand Slam tournament to become \\"open\\" to professionals The \\"Open Era\\" began in 1968 when Grand Slam tournaments agreed to allow professional players to compete with amateurs. Before 1968, only amateurs were allowed to compete in Grand Slam tournaments and other events organized or sanctioned by the ILTF, including the Davis Cup. > The move is made because the English are tired of the hypocrisy in the > sport, the shamateurism that plagues high-class tennis. It is well known > that amateurs bargain for ‚Äì and receive ‚Äì exorbitant expenses to compete at > many tournaments. \\"We must take action on our own account to make the game > honest\\", said Derek Penmam of the British association. \\"For too long now we > have been governed by a set of amateur rules that are quite unenforceable.\\" During the first years of the Open Era, power struggles between the ILTF and the commercial promoters led to boycotts of Grand Slam events. The first Open Era event was the 1968 British Hard Court Championships held in April at The West Hants Club in Bournemouth, England, while the first open Grand Slam tournament was the 1968 French Open in May. Both tournaments were won by Ken Rosewall. The Open Era allowed all tennis players the opportunity to make a living by playing tennis. =National Tennis League (NTL) and World Championship Tennis (WCT)= In 1968, a few professionals were independent, including Lew Hoad, Mal Anderson, Luis Ayala, and Owen Davidson, but most of the best players were under contract. George McCall operated the National Tennis League (NTL) and managed Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andr√©s Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Fred Stolle and Roy Emerson. Dave Dixon (later succeeded by Lamar Hunt) ran World Championship Tennis (WCT) and managed the \\"Handsome Eight\\": John Newcombe, Tony Roche, Nikola Piliƒá, Roger Taylor, Pierre Barth√®s, Earl \\"Butch\\" Buchholz, Cliff Drysdale and Dennis Ralston. In 1968, none of the original Handsome Eight WCT players participated in the French Open. In 1970, NTL players did not play in the Australian Open because their organization did not receive a guarantee. In 1970, neither WCT nor NTL players played in the French Open. =Grand Prix circuit= In the first two years of the Open Era, the National Tennis League and WCT promoters began to take control of the game. To outmaneuver them, Jack Kramer, the best player of the late 1940s / early 1950s, and at that time a promoter, conceived the Grand Prix tennis circuit in late 1969. He described it as: > . . . a series of tournaments with a money bonus pool that would be split up > on the basis of a cumulative point system. This would encourage the best > players to compete regularly in the series, so that they could share in the > bonus at the end and qualify for a special championship tournament that > would climax the year.THE GAME My 40 Years in Tennis, by Jack Kramer with > Frank Deford, pages 275‚Äì276 In 1970, none of the contract players participated in the French Open. The International Lawn Tennis Federation, alarmed by the control of the promoters, approved Kramer's Grand Prix. Twenty seven tournaments including the three Grand Slams, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open were played that year, with Stockholm tournament ending on 1 November. The independent professional players along with a few contract players, entered the Grand Prix circuit. Contract players could play Grand Prix events provided their contracts allowed it, and that they had adequate time apart from their own circuit. =Tour rivalries and the creation of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP)= The first WCT tournaments were held in February 1968 and the first NTL tournaments in March 1969. In July 1970, the WCT absorbed the NTL. At the end of 1970, a panel of journalists ranked the players, leading the WCT to send invitations to the 32 top men to play the 1971 WCT circuit: among the 32, Ilie NƒÉstase, Stan Smith, Jan Kode≈°, ≈Ωeljko Franuloviƒá and Clark Graebner stayed independent. In 1971, the WCT ran 20 tournaments, and concluded the year with the WCT Finals. In 1971, the majority of the best players still mainly played the WCT circuit. Thus, the 1971 Australian Open was a WCT competition whereas the French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open were ILTF Grand Prix events. By then, the rivalry between the two groups became so intense that Rosewall, Gimeno, Laver, Emerson and some other WCT players boycotted the 1971 US Open (although Newcombe played and lost in the first round to Kodes). Bill Riordan (the future manager of Jimmy Connors) complicated matters further with a third professional tour, the U.S. Indoor Circuit. In 1972, the conflict between the ILTF and the WCT culminated in the ILTF banning the contract professional players from all ILTF Grand Prix events between January and July, which included the 1972 French Open and 1972 Wimbledon. At the 1972 US Open in September, all the players attended and agreed to form a player syndicate to protect themselves from the promoters and associations, resulting in the creation of the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP). In 1973, there were four rival professional circuits: the WCT circuit, the Grand Prix circuit, the U.S. Indoor Circuit with Connors and Ilie NƒÉstase and the European Spring Circuit with NƒÉstase as their star. During the year, the ILTF banned Nikola Piliƒá from 1973 Wimbledon, due to Pilic's alleged refusal to play in Yugoslavia's Davis Cup tie against New Zealand. In retaliation, 81 out of 84 of Pilic's fellow players who were ATP members, boycotted 1973 Wimbledon in response, stating that professional players should have the right of deciding whether to play Davis Cup matches or not. The only ATP players who refused to boycott 1973 Wimbledon were Ilie NƒÉstase, Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie. They were later fined by the ATP for their participation in the tournament. Between 1974 and 1978, any tennis player who participated in the nascent World Team Tennis, which conflicted with the European leg of the Grand Prix circuit, was banned by the French Tennis Federation from playing in the French Open in the same calendar year. =Integration= In 1978 the ILTF Grand Prix and WCT circuits merged. However, In 1982, the WCT circuit separated again and created a more complex WCT ranking, similar to the ATP ranking. The WCT wasn't as successful in the 1980s, and the Grand Prix circuit became the primary circuit. The Grand Prix's governance was led by the 'Men's International Professional Tennis Council (MIPTC)' (also called the Men's Tennis Council (MTC)). The WCT Finals in Dallas continued being held until the end of the 1980s, and then disbanded with the creation of the ATP Tour for 1990. The Open Era, the global professional circuit, and television helped tennis spread globally and shed its elitist, anglocentric image. In America in the 1970s, courts are a common feature of public recreational facilities. Accordingly, in the 1970s the U.S. Open moved from the posh West Side Tennis Club to a public park (the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Flushing Meadows Park) that is accessible to anyone who buys a ticket. About the same time, the ruling body's name changed from the United States Lawn Tennis Association to the United States Tennis Association. =ATP Tour= In 1990, the Association of Tennis Professionals, led by Hamilton Jordan, replaced the MTC as the governing body of men's professional tennis. They established the ATP Tour, and packaged the nine most prestigious events as the \\"Championship Series - Single Tournament Week\\", and beginning in 1996, as the \\"Super Nine\\". Twelve of the Grand Prix which were slightly less prestigious than the first nine events were renamed as the \\"Championship Series - Double Week\\" (meaning in most cases, 2 of those tournaments occurred the same week), and commencing in 1996, as International Series Gold, while the remaining (approximately 60) became known as the International Series. Winning a Super Nine tournament was worth roughly half the points (370) of winning a Grand Slam tournament (750), while International Series Gold tournament was worth as much as 360 points depending on the total prize money. The format continued until 2000 at which time the Super Nine were renamed the Masters Series (the winner being awarded 500 points), occupying the rank below the Grand Slams (1000 points for the winner), and the International Series Gold were renamed to simply the Championship Series (worth 250 to 300 points for the winner). In 2000, the Grand Slam tournaments and the Masters Series tournaments became mandatory professional events if a player's ranking qualifies them for the tournament. Players were automatically entered and Masters and Slam events became the baseline for player rankings with up to an additional 5 tournaments also counted (18 in all plus the ATP Finals if they qualify). Before 2000, a players' best 14 tournaments were counted towards the ATP Point Rankings. In 2009, the Masters events were renamed the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 with the Monte-Carlo Masters becoming a non-mandatory event, meaning a player could use his results from a lower-level tournament in place of it. International Series Gold became the ATP World Tour 500 and the remaining events became the ATP World Tour 250. The numbers in the tournament type name indicate the winners' ranking points. By way of comparison, a winner of one of the four Grand Slam tournaments is awarded 2000 points. In 2009, a greater emphasis began to be placed on winning a tournament, as the points awarded to the runner-up dropped from 70% of the champion's points to 60% (i.e. from 700 points to 600 points in a Masters 1000 event). Points also began to be awarded for Davis Cup singles play. Women's professional tennis Women's professional tennis began in 1926, when world number one female player Suzanne Lenglen accepted $50,000 for a series of matches against three-time US Champion Mary K. Browne. The series ended in 1927, and the women did not compete as professionals again until 1941 when Alice Marble headlined a tour against Mary Hardwick. World War II hindered most professional competitions and many players were involved with entertaining the troops. In 1947, women professionals were again in action with a short-lived series of exhibition matches between Pauline Betz and Sarah Palfrey Cooke, both U.S. National Champions. In 1950 and 1951, Bobby Riggs signed Betz and Gussie Moran to play a pro tour with Jack Kramer and Pancho Segura, wherein Betz dominated Moran. Althea Gibson turned professional in 1958 and joined with Karol Fageros (\\"the Golden Goddess\\") as the opening act for the Harlem Globetrotters for one season. There was virtually no further women's professional tennis until 1967, when promoter George McCall signed Billie Jean King, Ann Jones, Fran√ßoise D√ºrr, and Rosie Casals to join his tour of eight men for two years.Max Robertson, The Encyclopedia of Tennis, 1974, The Viking Press, New York, , p. 68 The professional women then played as independents as the Open Era began. In 1970, promoter for the Pacific Southwest Championships in Los Angeles Jack Kramer offered the women only $7,500 in prize money versus the men's total of $50,000. When Kramer refused to match the men's prize money, King and Casals urged the other women to boycott. Gladys Heldman, American publisher of World Tennis magazine, responded with a separate women's tour under the sponsorship of Virginia Slims cigarettes. In 1971 and 1972 the WT Women's Pro Tour offered nearly ten times the prize money of other pro women's tennis events. The USLTA initially would not sanction the tour; however, the two groups determined to give Virginia Slims the individual events, and the USLTA the tour, thus resolving the conflict. In 1973, the U.S. Open made history by offering equal prize money to men and women. Billie Jean King, the most visible advocate for the women's cause, earned over $100,000 in 1971 and 1972.Max Robertson, p. 70 In the famous Battle of the Sexes exhibition match against the vocally sexist Bobby Riggs in September 1973, King brought even more media attention to tennis, and to women professionals in all walks of life by beating Riggs. The Women's Tennis Association, formed in 1973, is the principal organizing body of women's professional tennis, organizing the worldwide, professional WTA Tour. From 1984‚Äì98, the finals matches of the championship event were best-of-five, uniquely among women's tournaments. In 1999, the finals reverted to best-of- three. The WTA Tour Championships are generally considered to be the women's fifth most prestigious event (after the four Grand Slam tournaments.) Sponsors have included Virginia Slims (1971‚Äì78), Avon (1979‚Äì82), Virginia Slims again (1983‚Äì94), J.P. Morgan Chase (1996‚Äì2000), Sanex (2001) Home Depot (2002), and Sony Ericsson (2006). International Tennis Hall of Fame In 1954, James Van Alen founded the International Tennis Hall of Fame, a non-profit museum in Newport, Rhode Island. The building contains a large collection of memorabilia as well as honoring prominent players and others. Each year, a grass-court tournament takes place on its grounds, as well as an induction ceremony honoring new members.

The company, founded in 1992 by former nurse and inventor Tom Kruse, is based in Sarasota, Florida. Its battery-operated products are primarily designed to assist mobility challenged individuals in getting around inside their homes and to facilitate mobility-related activities of daily living (MRADLs). Hoveround sold directly to consumers. Hoveround relied primarily on television, mail and their website for sales efforts. In 2012, the company had celebrated its 20th anniversary and employed more than 500 employees. In early 2014, Hoveround laid off 20 or more workers at its Sarasota County headquarters offices. The worker reduction brought the total number of employees in the region within a range of only 290 to 295. According to spokespeople, competitive bidding at Medicare and the need for the company to trim payroll prompted the lay offs of staffers from throughout the organization. In late 2015, the Office of the Inspector General called for Hoveround to return to the government $27 million for power mobility devices that it said did not meet Medicare reimbursement requirements. Background Inventor Thomas Kruse, along with his brothers George and Robert, founded Hoveround Corporation in April 1992. Built to increase the mobility of wheelchair users, the Hoveround prototype maximized ease-of-operation, comfort and durability. The name ‚ÄúHoveround‚Äù is the brainchild of Tom Kruse. He blended the word ‚Äúhover‚Äù (based on the hovering look of the wheelchair), with the Beach Boys‚Äô song ‚ÄúI Get Around‚Äù. Kruse had been listening to the song on the radio while driving to a power chair promotional event and came up with the Hoveround name. On June 28, 1994, Hoveround began selling its power wheelchairs direct to the customer. Within 90 days, Hoveround was profitable. Hoveround achieved FDA certification as a registered manufacturer in 1994, followed by ISO 9001 certification in 1997. In 1998, private holding company Jordan Industries, purchased an 80% stake in Hoveround. The remaining stock remained with Kruse and his brothers.

Known for his \\"maniacal\\" performance style,Spotlight review of Are You With Me?, Billboard, July 13, 1996. and described as \\"a short, muscular guy with a heavy brow and piercingly intelligent eyes\\", LeBlanc has been called \\"one of the more instantly recognizable figures in contemporary Louisiana music.\\"Rick Koster, Louisiana Music (Da Capo Press, 2002), , p. 224. Except available at Google Books. Biography After graduating from Jesuit High School in New Orleans, LeBlanc began his career in the early 1980s with the Backbeats, also from New Orleans, which featured many future members of Cowboy Mouth. His tenure with this group was mostly relegated to background drummer. A year after the Backbeats disbanded in the mid-1980s, LeBlanc joined power trio Dash Rip Rock as drummer and as contributing songwriter and co-lead singer. The band was heavily influenced by the American roots music movement of the time, as well as the frenzied punk and rock stylings of both the Sex Pistols and Jerry Lee Lewis. To this mix, LeBlanc's songs usually had a very strong melodic component, with \\"Operator\\", \\"Blue Moon At Midnight\\", and \\"Go Home, Little Girl.\\" LeBlanc left Dash Rip Rock in mid-1989 and signed a deal as a solo artist with EMI Records. Although no recordings were ever released from his tenure with the label, LeBlanc has said that the year off from the road \\"gave me a chance to focus on my songwriting,\\" with LeBlanc writing many songs during that time that would appear on various Cowboy Mouth recordings later on. LeBlanc formed Cowboy Mouth in late 1990 with a lineup that has changed variously throughout the years, with the main constants being LeBlanc and John Thomas Griffith on guitar and vocals. The band has maintained a steady touring schedule since their formation, gaining in popularity steadily throughout the years through the notoriety of their live shows. LeBlanc has written many of Cowboy Mouth's material, such as \\"How Do You Tell Someone\\", \\"Love Of My Life\\", \\"Disconnected\\", \\"Take Me Back To New Orleans\\", \\"Easy\\", \\"Tell The Girl\\", \\"So Sad About Me\\", \\"The Avenue\\", and the band's signature song \\"Jenny Says\\". In addition to performing and recording with Cowboy Mouth, LeBlanc has mixed a few of their early independent label albums. He produced an album called A Different Story by New Orleans-based popsters Deadeye Dick. The album featured the song \\"New Age Girl\\", which won the band and LeBlanc a gold record in the early 1990s and was included in the Jim Carrey movie Dumb And Dumber. LeBlanc has produced material for Mark Bryan of Hootie & The Blowfish fame, and albums for Dash Rip Rock, The Bingemen, and The Garden District. He also released solo CDs entitled Here On Earth, Shiver, Double Dammit, and Playing The Game Of My Life, as well as an album of spoken word short stories (also released in text form) called Always Give Thanks. In July 2010, LeBlanc said that he would continue to release solo music, a song or two at a time, during breaks in Cowboy Mouth's schedule.Keith Spera, \\"Fred LeBlanc to strum solo, release new music online\\", Times-Picayune, July 8, 2010.

The family has been described as a sort of fusion of The Flintstones and The Munsters. The Frankenstones are also similar in scope to The Gruesomes, another monster-themed family who moved next door to the Flintstones during the fifth season of the original series. The New Fred and Barney Show The first version of the Frankenstones were introduced on September 15, 1979 in the episode \\"Fred & Barney Meet the Frankenstones\\" of the second season of The New Fred and Barney Show. They were featured as the managers of a condorstonium development called Deadrock Arms that Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble considered moving their families into. This Frankenstone family consisted of: * Frank Frankenstone, a Frankenstein Monster-style father (voiced by John Stephenson) * Hidea Frankenstone, his wife (voiced by Gay Autterson) * Atrocia Frankenstone, their giggly teenage daughter (voiced by Jean Vander Pyl) * Freaky Frankenstone, their son (voiced by Jim MacGeorge) Frank's voice was patterned after Boris Karloff by voice actor John Stephenson, and Hidea had a pseudo-Transylvanian accent. The Flintstones prime-time specials A Frankenstone monster (voiced by Ted Cassidy) was featured in the 1979 Halloween special The Flintstones Meet Rockula and Frankenstone. This version of Frankenstone was Count Rockula's unfinished creation, awoken prematurely when lightning strikes the machinery in Rockula's laboratory. Despite the resemblance, he is not to be confused with the Frank Frankenstone character that first appeared in The New Fred and Barney Show or featured in subsequent television specials and spin-off series. The second version of the Frankenstones moved in next door to the Flintstones in The Flintstones' New Neighbors as part of a limited run prime-time revival of The Flintstones, which aired on NBC in 1980‚Äì1981. This time, the family consisted of: * Frank Frankenstone (voiced by John Stephenson) * Oblivia Frankenstone, his wife (voiced by Patricia Parris) * Hidea Frankenstone, their daughter who resembles the original Atrocia (voiced by Julie McWhirter) * Stubby Frankenstone, their son who closely resembles Freaky (voiced by Jim MacGeorge) Again, the family is odd, and a friendship developed between the Flintstones and the Frankenstones. Frank's voice was still patterned after Boris Karloff by John Stephenson. This version of the Frankenstones continued to appear throughout the run of the prime-time specials: Fred's Final Fling (1980), Wind-Up Wilma (1981) and Jogging Fever (1981). The Flintstone Comedy Show The Frankenstones starred in their own eponymous segment on Saturday mornings as part of The Flintstone Comedy Show which premiered on November 22, 1980. This third and final version of the Frankenstone family more closely resembled the version previously seen in The New Fred and Barney Show than the Frankenstones that just moved in next door in the prime-time specials. This version of the family consisted of: * Frank Frankenstone (voiced by Charles Nelson Reilly) * Hidea Frankenstone, his wife and previously their daughter's name in the prime-time specials (voiced by Ruta Lee) * Atrocia Frankenstone, their kooky daughter who is now the youngest child (voiced by Zelda Rubinstein) * Freaky Frankenstone, their son who is now a teenager (voiced by Paul Reubens) * Rockjaw, their pet monster who devoured anything in his path (voiced by Frank Welker) The previously soft-natured Frank is now hot-tempered and wired with his voice provided by Charles Nelson Reilly in his traditional high-pitched, hyper-whiny style. Frank became volatile at the drop of a hat, especially when he dealt with his annoying neighbor and rival Fred Flintstone. Frank and Fred were both frustrated by the friendships between their wives (Hidea and Wilma) and children (Freaky and Pebbles), and they always seemed to be thrust into one mess after another because of each other. Cartoon historian Hal Erickson says that \\"The Frankenstones was the best of the new components, and a refreshing break from the usual 'friendly monster who thinks everyone else is abnormal' formula...[Frank Frankenstone] carried on a hilariously snotty feud with neighbor Fred Flintstone. The lines given to Frank and his goodnatured wife Hidea were some of the sharpest and funniest heard on any of the Flintstones incarnation. The verbal humor was evenly matched by the grotesquely imaginative visual design of the Frankenstone home, which carried its own rain cloud and was overrun with utterly indescribable stone-age monstrosities of all shapes and colors...The Frankenstones sequences more than made up for the rest of the show with a generous supply of laughs.\\" The Flintstone Comedy Show ran for two seasons and consecutively with two more Flintstone prime-time specials in 1981 (which both revert to John Stephenson's version of Frank with his wife Oblivia, and children Hidea and Stubby). The continuity of the prime-time Flintstones and Saturday morning Flintstones drift farther apart because both have their own version of Frankenstone neighbors. Following the cancellation of The Flintstone Comedy Show in 1982, the Frankenstones have never been referred to in any subsequent spin-off series, specials or animated movies. The Frankenstones segment was later rerun as part of the package show The Flintstone Funnies (1982‚Äì1984). Appearances in other media * Frank Frankenstone makes a cameo appearance as an enemy character at the haunted dungeon stage in the 1991 video game The Flintstones: The Rescue of Dino & Hoppy. * Frank Frankenstone appears in two different comic books: The Flintstone Kids #10 (published in 1989 by Star Comics) and The Flintstones #1 (published in 1995 by Archie Comics).

They are motivated by the question: given sets A and B of natural numbers, is it possible to effectively convert a method for deciding membership in B into a method for deciding membership in A? If the answer to this question is affirmative then A is said to be reducible to B. The study of reducibility notions is motivated by the study of decision problems. For many notions of reducibility, if any noncomputable set is reducible to a set A then A must also be noncomputable. This gives a powerful technique for proving that many sets are noncomputable.  Reducibility relations A reducibility relation is a binary relation on sets of natural numbers that is * Reflexive: Every set is reducible to itself. * Transitive: If a set A is reducible to a set B and B is reducible to a set C then A is reducible to C. These two properties imply that a reducibility is a preorder on the powerset of the natural numbers. Not all preorders are studied as reducibility notions, however. The notions studied in computability theory have the informal property that A is reducible to B if and only if any (possibly noneffective) decision procedure for B can be effectively converted to a decision procedure for A. The different reducibility relations vary in the methods they permit such a conversion process to use. = Degrees of a reducibility relation = Every reducibility relation (in fact, every preorder) induces an equivalence relation on the powerset of the natural numbers in which two sets are equivalent if and only if each one is reducible to the other. In recursion theory, these equivalence classes are called the degrees of the reducibility relation. For example, the Turing degrees are the equivalence classes of sets of naturals induced by Turing reducibility. The degrees of any reducibility relation are partially ordered by the relation in the following manner. Let ‚â§ be a reducibility relation and let A and B be two of its degrees. Then A ‚â§ B if and only if there is a set A in A and a set B in B such that A ‚â§ B. This is equivalent to the property that for every set A in A and every set B in B, A ‚â§ B, because any two sets in A are equivalent and any two sets in B are equivalent. It is common, as shown here, to use boldface notation to denote degrees.  Turing reducibility  The most fundamental reducibility notion is Turing reducibility. A set A of natural numbers is Turing reducible to a set B if and only if there is an oracle Turing machine that, when run with B as its oracle set, will compute the indicator function (characteristic function) of A. Equivalently, A is Turing reducible to B if and only if there is an algorithm for computing the indicator function for A provided that the algorithm is provided with a means to correctly answer questions of the form \\"Is n in B?\\". Turing reducibility serves as a dividing line for other reducibility notions because, according to the Church-Turing thesis, it is the most general reducibility relation that is effective. Reducibility relations that imply Turing reducibility have come to be known as strong reducibilities, while those that are implied by Turing reducibility are weak reducibilities. Equivalently, a strong reducibility relation is one whose degrees form a finer equivalence relation than the Turing degrees, while a weak reducibility relation is one whose degrees form a coarser equivalence relation than Turing equivalence.  Reductions stronger than Turing reducibility  The strong reducibilities include *One-one reducibility: A is one-one reducible to B if there is a computable one-to-one function f with A(x) = B(f(x)) for all x. *Many-one reducibility: A is many-one reducible to B if there is a computable function f with A(x) = B(f(x)) for all x. *Truth- table reducible: A is truth-table reducible to B if A is Turing reducible to B via a single (oracle) Turing machine which produces a total function relative to every oracle. *Weak truth-table reducible: A is weak truth-table reducible to B if there is a Turing reduction from B to A and a recursive function f which bounds the use. Whenever A is truth-table reducible to B, A is also weak truth-table reducible to B, since one can construct a recursive bound on the use by considering the maximum use over the tree of all oracles, which will exist if the reduction is total on all oracles. *Positive reducible: A is positive reducible to B if and only if A is truth-table reducible to B in a way that one can compute for every x a formula consisting of atoms of the form B(0), B(1), ... such that these atoms are combined by and's and or's, where the and of a and b is 1 if a = 1 and b = 1 and so on. *Disjunctive reducible: Similar to positive reducible with the additional constraint that only or's are permitted. *Conjunctive reducibility: Similar to positive reducibility with the additional constraint that only and's are permitted. *Linear reducibility: Similar to positive reducibility but with the constraint that all atoms of the form B(n) are combined by exclusive or's. In other words, A is linear reducible to B if and only if a computable function computes for each x a finite set F(x) given as an explicit list of numbers such that x ‚àà A if and only if F(x) contains an odd number of elements of B. Many of these were introduced by Post (1944). Post was searching for a non-recursive, recursively enumerable set which the halting problem could not be Turing reduced to. As he could not construct such a set in 1944, he instead worked on the analogous problems for the various reducibilities that he introduced. These reducibilities have since been the subject of much research, and many relationships between them are known. = Bounded reducibilities = A bounded form of each of the above strong reducibilities can be defined. The most famous of these is bounded truth-table reduction, but there are also bounded Turing, bounded weak truth-table and others. These first three are the most common ones and they are based on the number of queries. For example, a set A is bounded truth-table reducible to B if and only if the Turing machine M computing A relative to B computes a list of up to n numbers, queries B on these numbers and then terminates for all possible oracle answers; the value n is a constant independent of x. The difference between bounded weak truth- table and bounded Turing reduction is that in the first case, the up to n queries have to be made at the same time while in the second case, the queries can be made one after the other. For that reason, there are cases where A is bounded Turing reducible to B but not weak truth-table reducible to B. = Strong reductions in computational complexity = The strong reductions listed above restrict the manner in which oracle information can be accessed by a decision procedure but do not otherwise limit the computational resources available. Thus if a set A is decidable then A is reducible to any set B under any of the strong reducibility relations listed above, even if A is not polynomial-time or exponential-time decidable. This is acceptable in the study of recursion theory, which is interested in theoretical computability, but it is not reasonable for computational complexity theory, which studies which sets can be decided under certain asymptotical resource bounds. The most common reducibility in computational complexity theory is polynomial-time reducibility; a set A is polynomial-time reducible to a set B if there is a polynomial-time function f such that for every n, n is in A if and only if f(n) is in B. This reducibility is, essentially, a resource-bounded version of many-one reducibility. Other resource-bounded reducibilities are used in other contexts of computational complexity theory where other resource bounds are of interest.  Reductions weaker than Turing reducibility  Although Turing reducibility is the most general reducibility that is effective, weaker reducibility relations are commonly studied. These reducibilities are related to relative definability of sets over arithmetic or set theory. They include: * Arithmetical reducibility: A set A is arithmetical in a set B if A is definable over the standard model of Peano arithmetic with an extra predicate for B. Equivalently, according to Post's theorem, A is arithmetical in B if and only if A is Turing reducible to B^{(n)}, the nth Turing jump of B, for some natural number n. The arithmetical hierarchy gives a finer classification of arithmetical reducibility. * Hyperarithmetical reducibility: A set A is hyperarithmetical in a set B if A is \\\\Delta^1_1 definable (see analytical hierarchy) over the standard model of Peano arithmetic with a predicate for B. Equivalently, A is hyperarithmetical in B if and only if A is Turing reducible to B^{(\\\\alpha)}, the Œ±th Turing jump of B, for some B-recursive ordinal Œ±. *Relative constructibility: A set A is relatively constructible from a set B if A is in L(B), the smallest transitive model of ZFC set theory containing B and all the ordinals.

The southernmost ski resort in West Virginia, Winterplace is a popular attraction due to its proximity to Interstate 77. It operates in conjunction with The Resort at Glade Springs, a four season golf resort and spa. History The first ski resort on Flat Top Mountain was established on the north slope of Bald Knob in 1958. Named Bald Knob Ski Slopes, the resort was the second commercial ski location in West Virginia, following the predecessors of Canaan Valley Ski Resort. It was founded by future West Virginia governor Hulett C. Smith and businessman John McKay, and designed by former Army officer Robert K. Potter. Operating with four tow ropes and a double chair, the resort's longest trail extended 2,800 feet. It was marketed as the southernmost ski resort in the Eastern United States. The resort closed in 1961; the site is now known as Old Winterplace. The current ski resort, sometimes known as New Winterplace, was established fifteen years later on Huff Knob, southeast of the former resort site; the two resort sites are separated by I-77. The mountain Winterplace is nearly equidistant between Beckley, West Virginia to the north on Interstate 77 and Princeton, West Virginia to the south. The resort's southern location and proximity to the north-south I-77 corridor draws visitors from North and South Carolina as well as local skiers from Virginia and West Virginia. The Southern West Virginia visitor's bureau promotes the resort as \\"the most accessible, affordable ski resort in the Southeast\\". The resort's top elevation is with a vertical descent of . It has of skiable area, 28 trails, a terrain park, and nine lifts. The average snowfall for the resort is . A fifty million gallon reservoir lake enables supplementary snowmaking at a rate of 7,000 gallons of water per minute. The resort's 16-lane snow tubing facility is cited as the largest in West Virginia. The resort's ski trails extend up the northern slope of Huff Knob, in the curve of I-77. The terrain in front of the resort complex is devoted to beginner skiing; three chair lifts climb midway up the ridge, providing access to mixed easier and intermediate trails, plus the resort's terrain park and snow tubing facility. Another set of two parallel chairs extends from the resort's mid-mountain lodge to the summit, accessing expert and intermediate terrain. A run of 1.25 miles is available by skiing from the mountain summit to the main base, but multiple chairlift rides are required for return; other trails are a fraction of that length. The Resort at Glade Springs The Resort at Glade Springs is located eight miles north of Winterplace in Daniels, West Virginia, near the intersection of I-77 and Interstate 64. It operates a spa and three golf courses The Cobb Course and the Stonehaven Course have been rated among the top five courses in West Virginia by Golfweek Magazine; the Cobb Course, designed by George Cobb, was rated West Virginia's best golf course in 1995. Glade Springs is also the home course for the WVU Tech men's and women's golf teams.WVU Tech Athletics - Athletic Facilities Glade Springs also offers horseback riding and whitewater rafting on the New River.

Early life Sibylle of Cleves and one of her sons John Frederick II was the eldest son of John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony and Sibylle of Cleves. He was given a comprehensive education along with his younger brother Johann Wilhelm under the guidance of the legal scholar Basilius Monner. The two brothers were invited to take part in the Aulic Council, where they were able to develop their knowledge of diplomacy at a young age. Reign and military ambitions After the Battle of M√ºhlberg (24 April 1547) and the capture of his father, John Frederick II, along with his brother John William, succeeded their father as the regents of the lands still retained by their family. After the death of their father (1554), the brothers amicably divided the lands that were inherited from their father; even so, John Frederick II, remained as the exclusive regent for the family possessions. And even though he received Eisenach and Coburg in the divisionary treaty, John Frederick II chose Gotha as his place of residence while serving as head of the family. John Frederick's political aspirations were still directed towards the reinstatement of his family's right to the title of \\"Elector of Saxony,\\" as well as the re-establishment of the lands that were lost due to his father's imprisonment. In 1563 his prized general, Wilhelm von Grumbach attacked W√ºrzburg, seized and plundered the city and compelled the chapter and the bishop to restore his lands. He was consequently placed under the imperial ban, but John Frederick II refused to obey the order of the Emperor Maximilian II to withdraw his forces. Meanwhile, Grumbach plotted the assassination of Saxon elector, Augustus; and proclamations were issued asking for assistance. Because of this, an end to alliances both inside and outside of Germany came about. In November 1566 John Frederick was placed under the imperial ban, which had been placed against Grumbach earlier in the year, and Augustus marched against Gotha. Resistance from the people of Gotha was not forthcoming, and a mutiny led to the defeat of the town. Grumbach was delivered to his foes, and after being tortured, was executed at Gotha on 18 April 1567. The Emperor imposed the Reichsacht (Imperial Ban) over John Frederick II, the current Elector of Saxony. The Reichsexekution (more or less an intervention against a single ruler in order to maintain the good of the entire empire) was also put into effect, in which John William, John Frederick's own brother, took part. After a siege of his castle in Gotha in 1566, John Frederick was eventually defeated and spent the rest of his life as an imperial prisoner. His possessions were confiscated by the emperor and handed over to John William, who became the sole ruler of the whole duchy of Saxony. Marriages and children Renaissance epitaph for Duke John Frederick II In Weimar on 26 May 1555 John Frederick II married his first wife, Agnes of Hesse, Dowager Electress of Saxony. Six months later she suffered a miscarriage and died, on 4 November 1555. In Weimar on 12 June 1558 John Frederick II married his second wife, Countess Palatine Elisabeth of Simmern- Sponheim, daughter of the later (1559) Frederick III, Elector Palatine. They had four sons: * John Frederick (30 November 1559, Weimar ‚Äì 8 August 1560, Weimar) * Frederick Henry (3 February 1563, Heldburg ‚Äì 4 August 1572, Eisenberg) * John Casimir, Duke of Saxe-Coburg (12 June 1564, Gotha ‚Äì 16 July 1633, Coburg) * John Ernest, Duke of Saxe-Eisenach (9 July 1566, Gotha ‚Äì 23 October 1638, Eisenach) Succession Later, the Emperor used the two surviving sons of John Frederick II against their uncle John William; in 1572 the Division of Erfurt was made. The duchy of Saxony was divided into three parts. The older son, John Casimir, received Coburg, and the younger, John Ernest, received Eisenach. John William retained only the smaller part, the limited region of Weimar, but he added to his duchy the districts of Altenburg, Gotha and Meiningen. Since it has several Ernestine dynasties, Thuringia was also given in this division, the total possession of the Wettins (the duchy of Saxony) that had always bordered each other were no longer combined. From John William descends the house of Saxe-Weimar and the first house of Saxe-Altenburg, which separated later from Saxe-Weimar. John Frederick II died in 1595 and was buried in a large tomb by sculptor Nikolaus Bergner at Morizkirche at Coburg, which his son John Casimir built for him and his wife, Elisabeth. The coffins are today in the crypt beneath the church.

Racing Bicycle Racer posed at Salt Palace wood track, Salt Lake City, 1911 The first documented cycling race was a 1,200 metre race held on May 31, 1868 at the Park of Saint-Cloud, Paris. It was won by expatriate Englishman James Moore who rode a bicycle with solid rubber tires.Maso, B. (tr. Horn, M.) (2005), The Sweat of the Gods, Mousehold Press, pp. 1-2, The first cycle race covering a distance between two cities was Paris‚ÄìRouen, also won by James Moore, who rode the 123 kilometres dividing both cities in 10 hours and 40 minutes. The oldest established bicycle racing club in the United States is the St. Louis Cycling Club. Operating continuously since 1887, the club has sponsored races and timed distance events since its inception. Its members have included numerous national champions and Olympic team members. Bicycle racers before start of the alt= Recreation Cycling as recreation became organized shortly after racing did. In its early days, cycling brought the sexes together in an unchaperoned way, particularly after the 1880s when cycling became more accessible owing to the invention of the Rover Safety bicycle. Public cries of alarm at the prospect of moral chaos arose from this and from the evolution of women‚Äôs cycling attire, which grew progressively less enveloping and restrictive. On 4 March 1915 the society for the construction of cycle paths in the Gooi and Eemland region in the Netherlands was founded. It is the last private ‚ÄúCycle Path Society‚Äù that still exists today. Some people thought the increasing amount of motor traffic in the early 20th century was so dangerous for people cycling, especially those who rode as a leisure activity, that they wanted separate cycling infrastructure to be built. The routes would also not be connected to a route for motor traffic and mainly for recreation - so not the shortest routes, but the nicest routes. Today we see a resurgence of recreational cycling. We can see this with many companies meeting the demand for this trend and specialising in retro/vintage style bikes that originated in the Netherlands. Commuting People have been riding bicycles to work since the initial bicycle heyday of the 1890s. According to the website Bike to Work, this practice continued in the United States until the 1920s, when biking experienced a sharp drop, in part due to the growth of suburbs and the popularity of the car. In Europe, cycling to work continued to be common until the end of the 1950s. Today many people ride bikes to work for a variety of reasons including fitness, environmental concerns, convenience, frugality, and enjoyment. According to the US Census Bureau‚Äôs 2008 American Community Survey(ACS), on September 22, 2009, 0.55 percent of Americans use a bicycle as the primary means of getting to work. Some places of employment offer amenities to bike commuters, such as showers, changing rooms, indoor bike racks and other secure bike parking. Touring Many cyclists wanted to use their machines to travel; some of them went around the world. Annie Londonderry did so in the 1880s, taking 15 months. Six Indian men cycled 71000 km around the world in the 1920s.  The cycling craze  With four key aspects (steering, safety, comfort and speed) improved over the penny- farthing, bicycles became very popular among elites and the middle classes in Europe and North America in the middle and late 1890s. It was the first bicycle that was suitable for women, and as such became the \\"freedom machine\\" (as American feminist Susan B. Anthony called it),https://www.nshss.org/media/1455/postolowski.pdf giving women \\"a feeling of freedom and self-reliance\\". The Svea Velocipede by Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m and Birger Ljungstr√∂m, exhibited at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology. The Svea Velocipede with vertical pedal arrangement and locking hubs was introduced in 1892 by the Swedish engineers Fredrik Ljungstr√∂m and Birger Ljungstr√∂m. It attracted attention at the World's Fair and was produced in a few thousand units. Bicycle historians often call this period the \\"golden age\\" or \\"bicycle craze\\". By the start of the 20th century, cycling had become an important means of transportation, and in the United States an increasingly popular form of recreation. Bicycling clubs for men and women spread across the U.S. and across European countries. Chicago immigrant Adolph Schoeninger with his Western Wheel Works became the \\"Ford of the Bicycle\\" (ten years before Henry Ford) by copying Pope's mass production methods and by introducing stamping to the production process in place of machining, significantly reducing production costs, and thus prices.Norcliffe, Glen. The Ride to Modernity: The Bicycle in Canada, 1869-1900 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001), p.107. His \\"Crescent\\" bicycles thus became affordable for working people, and massive exports from the United States lowered prices in Europe. The Panic of 1893 wiped out many American manufacturers who had not followed the lead of Pope and Schoeninger, in the same way that the Great Depression would ruin car makers who did not follow Ford.G.N. Georgano Cars: Early and Vintage, 1886-1930. (London: Grange-Universal, 1985) 1897 ad, showing unskirted garment for women's bicycle riding Bicycle suit vs conventional clothing The impact of the bicycle on female emancipation should not be underestimated. The safety bicycle gave women unprecedented mobility, contributing to their larger participation in the lives of Western nations. As bicycles became safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom they embodied, and so the bicycle came to symbolise the New Woman of the late nineteenth century, especially in Britain and the United States. Feminists and suffragists recognised its transformative power. Susan B. Anthony said, \\"Let me tell you what I think of bicycling. I think it has done more to emancipate women than anything else in the world. It gives women a feeling of freedom and self-reliance. I stand and rejoice every time I see a woman ride by on a wheel...the picture of free, untrammeled womanhood.\\" In 1895 Frances Willard, the tightly laced president of the Women‚Äôs Christian Temperance Union, wrote a book called How I Learned to Ride the Bicycle (described in Bicycling magazine as \\"the greatest book ever written on learning to ride\\"Bicycling, November 2006, p.78. ), in which she praised the bicycle she learned to ride late in life, and which she named \\"Gladys\\", for its \\"gladdening effect\\" on her health and political optimism. Willard used a cycling metaphor to urge other suffragists to action, proclaiming, \\"I would not waste my life in friction when it could be turned into momentum.\\"Willard, Frances. Glimpses of fifty years: the autobiography of an American woman. (Woman's Temperance Publication Association, 1889 p.231. Elizabeth Robins Pennell started cycling in the 1870s in Philadelphia,Pennell, Elizabeth. Over the Alps on Bicycle (1898)., p. 16. and from the 1880s onwards brought out a series of travelogues about her cycling journeys around Europe, from A Canterbury Pilgrimage to Over the Alps on a Bicycle. In 1895 Annie Londonderry became the first woman to bicycle around the world. The backlash against the New (bicycling) Woman was demonstrated when the male undergraduates of Cambridge University in England chose to show their opposition to the admission of women as full members of the university by hanging a woman in effigy in the main town square‚Äîtellingly, a woman on a bicycle‚Äîas late as 1897.Newnham College Cambridge: The History of the College Since women could not cycle in the then-current fashions for voluminous and restrictive dress, the bicycle craze fed into a movement for so-called rational dress, which helped liberate women from corsets and ankle-length skirts and other encumbering garments, substituting the then-shocking bloomers.

Visitors are able to listen to, sample, mash-up, or interact with music in a variety of ways including the download and use of tracks and samples in their own remixes. Most sampling or mash-up web sites on the Internet stipulate that users forgo their rights to the new song once it is created. By contrast, the material on ccMixter.org is generally licensed to be used in any arena, not just the ccMixter site or a specific contest. The ccMixter site contains over 10,000 samples from a wide range of recording artists, including high-profile artists such as Beastie Boys and David Byrne. As a cultural phenomenon, ccMixter represents a direct response to what some say is the increasingly litigious attitude of organizations like the RIAA--one which prevents artists from appropriating elements of others' work for creative reuse in their own. The site originated as a project of Creative Commons, with the idea being conceived of and developed by Neeru Paharia (then Assistant Director of Creative Commons) as a \\"Friendster for music\\" with the intent of exposing the genealogy of remixed music. The vision was both to create a body of openly licensed music, and to motivate artists to share by exposing how their work was being used by other artists in their remixes. Paharia hired Victor Stone (a developer and musician) to build the website, who then became the site's administrator, and project lead. In 2009 Creative Commons licensed the name 'ccMixter' and transferred operations to ArtisTech Media, a company run by members of the ccMixter community. The project maintains close organizational ties to independent minded, open music labels such as Magnatune and BBE. The site runs on ccHost,ccHost Wiki an award- winningCreative Commons: ccHost Wins A Linux World Journal Product Excellence Award open source multimedia content management system that is able to keep track of how content is being remixed. In February 2009, Victor Stone, project lead of ccMixter, posted a \\"memoir\\"\\"ccMixter: A Memoir\\" (PDF) by Victor Stone detailing the history and philosophy of the first four years of operations at the site.  Calls for remixes  ccMixter began in 2004 as the host of the Wired CD remix contest. That was followed by several other remix contests where prizes included recording contracts. In 2007 ccMixter eschewed remix contests, in part, due to concerns in the member community that the site was losing its focus on open music. Instead major artists such as DJ Vadim, Bucky Jonson (The Black Eyed Peas' live backing band) and Trifonic have contributed the solo studio tracks (stems) to entire albums making them available under Creative Commons licenses that allowed remixes. In addition there have been \\"calls for remixes\\" by members that post a cappellas, looking to create albums from remixes such Colin Mutchler,\\"Language of My Reality\\" by Colin Mutchler Brad Sucks,\\"Mixter Two\\" by Brad Sucks Tamara Barnett-Herrin (aka Calendar Girl) and Shannon Hurley.Call for Remixes: Shannon Hurley  Transfer of operations  In May 2008, Creative Commons postedCreative Commons: Request for Proposals a Request for ProposalsRequest for Proposals (PDF) to take over the stewardship and operations of ccMixter.

Those Websters was a radio situation comedy series starring Willard Waterman and Constance Crowder as George and Jane Webster. The program was launched in New York and then moved to Chicago for a short spell before finishing its run from Hollywood. The series replaced That Brewster Boy (1941‚Äì45), which starred a teenaged Dick York. Several Brewster cast members continued on with Those Websters, and the two situation comedies were quite similar. The transition is evident in the near-anagram: Brewster=Webster. In a 1991 interview with John Douglas, Dick York explained how That Brewster Boy morphed into Those Websters: :Pauline Hopkins and Owen Vincent were the writer and director of That Brewster Boy. They were sending bundles to the Communists to help fight the Nazis, so naturally they were branded as Communists. The advertising agency came around, hired everyone from under them, and they were going to change the name of the show and get rid of Pauline and Owen. Well, I was fresh out of the slum. It was the first time I ever had any money, but I went to Pauline and Owen and told them straight out that I didn't know what it was all about, but that I was with them. I wouldn't sign with the agency. Of course, I was taken off the show.Easy Ace: Those Websters Those riotous Websters were heard Friday evenings at 9:30pm on CBS from March 9, 1945 to February 22, 1946 with Quaker Oats as the sponsor. On March 3, 1946, the series moved to Mutual where it aired Sundays at 6pm until August 22, 1948. Cast and characters The Webster family lived at 46 River Road in the Chicago suburb of Spring City where George Webster often attended the lodgehall meetings of the Sons of the Mustangs of the Moonlight Mesas. Attempting to prove that \\"families are fun,\\" those hapless Websters continually encountered confusion, and plans usually went astray during their chaotic misadventures. Jean Verhagen (later billed as Jean Hagen) played Betty Webster. The children were Liz Webster (Joan Alt) and Billy Webster (Arthur Young, Gil Stratton Jr.), with Bill Idelson as Billy's friend Emil, Jerry Spellman (as Jeep) and Jane Webb (as Belinda Boyd). Fran Allison was heard as a family cousin, and the cast also included Clarence Hartzell, Parley Baer and Eddie Firestone Jr. (1921-2007). Charles Irving announced the program, scripted by Priscilla Kent, Albert G. Miller and Frank and Doris Hursley. Frank Worth led the orchestra. Two years after this series came to an end, Waterman replaced Harold Peary as the title character in The Great Gildersleeve in 1950.
