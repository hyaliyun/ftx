Biography Kaeso Duillius Longus was one of the ten members of the Second Decemvirate, presided over by Appius Claudius Crassus and elected for the purpose of creating the Law of the Twelve Tables, first body of written law in Roman history. At the instigation of Sabinus, the decemvirs held onto their titles illegally the following year, and refused to proceed with the annual election of consuls.Cicero, De Republica, II. 61 In 449 BC, a war escalated with the Sabines setting up in Eretum and the Aequi who had camped on Mount Algidus. Roman forces were divided into two armies in order to fight on two fronts. Duilius received command of the army which fought the Sabines, with three other decemvirs; Quintus Fabius Vibulanus, Manius Rabuleius, and Quintus Poetelius. At the time, Crassus and Spurius Oppius Cornicen remained in Rome in order to assure the defense of the city, while the other four decemvirs fought against the Aequi.Livy, Ab urbe condita, III. 38-42Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Roman Antiquities, XI. 2.1 The two Roman armies were each kept in check on both fronts. The army commanded by Duillius withdrew to Fidenae and Crustumerium then returned to the field after the death of the soldier Lucius Siccius Dentatus, former tribune of the plebs and staunch opponent of the patricians. His death was concealed as though it were a loss suffered in an ambush. The soldiers then mutinied and elected ten military tribunes to command the army. They then returned to Rome and set up on the Aventine before merging with the other army on Monte Sacro. Under pressure by the soldiers and the plebeians, the decemvirs resigned. Appius Claudius Crassus and Spurius Oppius Cornicen remained in Rome and were imprisoned, but committed suicide during their trial.

Alt was formerly a civil parish within the Limehurst Rural District until its abolition in 1954 when its territory was divided between the towns of Oldham and Ashton Under Lyne.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10331857/boundaryVision of Britain Retrieved 6 December 2016 The Alt Estate is a large housing estate built in the 1950s around the location of Alt Fold, one of several ancient hamlets that were situated in the area. The Holts Estate, also known as Holts Village, is also within the area of the civil parish. These estates lie within the Oldham part of Alt in the north of the parish area. Etymology The name Alt is of Brittonic origin, and is derived from alt, meaning primarily \\"a cliff\\" or \\"a steep height or hill\\" (c.f. Gaelic and Welsh allt). History Alt is located in the historic parish of Ashton‚Äìunder‚ÄìLyne. Historically part of the Hundred of Salford. The favourable topography of the old settlement (above the river) and the nearby find of a Bronze Age flint adze suggest that the area may have been occupied in prehistoric times. During the Roman period the land was probably cleared of timber for cultivation, but by about AD 550 woodland regeneration suggests a reduced population and a decline in the climate. The land was once more cleared, probably between AD 610 and 740, and finally in about AD 850. At Domesday in AD 1086, Alt was probably a manor within the parish of Ashton. It is first recorded in the 1200s when Thomas, son of William of Alt claimed land in Palden; the name may derive from the Old Welsh for allt hill or ‚Äòvillage amongst the hills'. The Old Welsh name of allt suggests the area had an existing population, a community that had survived the Anglo Saxon colonisation of the area in the 7th century AD. The name may also refer to Alder trees in the manor, locally once called owlers. The hamlet of Alt Fold was situated at the junction of Sommerfield View, Alt Lane and Alt Fold Drive. Originating in the medieval period, was a second hamlet at Pitses, located at the junction of Holts Lane and Abbey Hills Road. James Butterworth the Oldham historian described it in the early 1800s as ‚Äòbeing surrounded by pools of water'. Throughout the medieval period the Alt area was probably arable land farmed in strips as part of an open field system, though it may also have included some pasture. Coal mining in Alt has been known from the early 1700s with pits in Alt and Fairbottom, whilst the name Pitses may indicate the presence of early coal pits. The abolition of Limehurst Rural District in 1954 enabled the County Borough of Oldham to extend development into the former semi rural area, building the Alt estate and its associated schools, playing fields etc. Development did not however encroach upon Alt Fold, though this ancient area was entirely cleared in the late 1960s.http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:iSRQ8LA- PacJ:www.oldham.gov.uk/download/downloads/id/1149/oldham_rochdale_hmr_pathfinder_heritage_assessment_- _alt+&cd;=1&hl;=en&ct;=clnk‚â∑=uk Alt, Final Report 2008 Retrieved 28 February 2017 Buildings South of the Alt Estate lies a semi rural area along Alt Lane.

Andersen initially published the webcomic on Tumblr, but has since released it on various services, such as Facebook, Instagram and WEBTOON. Sarah's Scribbles follows Andersen's experiences as a Millennial and focuses on themes such as adulthood and maturity. In March 2016, Andersen published a print collection of her webcomic, titled Adulthood is a Myth. This was followed in March 2017 by Big Mushy Happy Lump. A third collection, Herding Cats, was published in March 2018. Overview Sarah's Scribbles focuses on adulthood and the maturity of the Millennial generation. Andersen herself described Millennials as \\"liking to laugh at themselves,\\" making common use of self-deprecating humour. The Independent described Sarah's Scribbles as a series of \\"relatable comics capturing the dilemmas of a bug-eyed millennial who feels ill-equipped for grown-up life.\\" The webcomic is semi-autobiographical, following Andersen's experiences as well as those of her friends and pets. One comic shows, for instance, how Andersen borrows items from her boyfriend. Andersen's webcomic primarily features the messy-haired protagonist Sarah, who has to deal with social anxiety, body image issues and laziness. Andersen has deliberately chosen not to publish photographs of her face, instead opting to present herself through her black-haired and black-eyed character. Andersen noted in December, 2016 that Owl Turd Comics was her favorite webcomic at the time, though she primarily gains inspiration from her own life and seeing what people on the internet are thinking and feeling. Development Sarah Andersen at Lucca Comics & Games in 2016. Andersen started creating and uploading Sarah's Scribbles on Tumblr in 2013. She was studying at the Maryland Institute College of Art at the time, from which she graduated in 2014 to work on the webcomic full-time. Andersen noted in an interview that publishing Sarah's Scribbles as a webcomic allows her to observe the reactions of her readership in real-time, and she stated that this allows her to do a better job. Andersen's webcomic makes use of a five-panel format, which Andersen developed because it works well with the scroll display of Tumblr and continues to work well on other websites, such as Instagram. Andersen has also described her romance webcomic Fangs as depicting \\"what ‚ÄúSarah‚Äù [of Sarah's Scribbles] would be like all grown up\\". In March 2016, Andersen released a print collection of Sarah's Scribbles comics titled Adulthood is a Myth. The book was published by Andrews McMeel Publishing.

History It was originally launched 1 January 2015 as UTV Ireland‚Äîa branch of Northern Ireland's ITV franchise UTV. Transmission came from UTV's Belfast headquarters. Prior to launch, the channel acquired the Irish rights to key ITV programmes such as Coronation Street and Emmerdale. On 6 November 2013, UTV Ireland's then owner, UTV Media, announced its subsidiary, UTV Ireland Ltd, would launch a new television channel targeting audiences within the Republic of Ireland and obtained a licence for a 'Content Provision Contract' from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. UTV launched the channel following their acquisition of Republic of Ireland broadcasting rights to key programming from ITV Studios Global Entertainment, including Emmerdale, Coronation Street and The Jeremy Kyle Show. TV3 previously held the rights until December 2014. The announcement of the channel was welcomed by then Minister for Communications, Pat Rabbitte TD and TV3's CEO David McRedmond welcomed the channels launch saying it is good news for the independent sector and all money that was spent on ITV programming by TV3 can be reinvested elsewhere. In January 2014 The Sunday Times reported that 3 had launched a lobbying campaign against the establishment of UTV Ireland. On 27 Februaery 2014, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland signed a contract with UTV for the company to provide a general entertainment channel. On 29 April 2014, Mary Curtis became UTV Ireland's first chief. The channel employed around 100 people, with 30 of these jobs being based around the country. On 1 December 2014, UTV Ireland was granted Public Service Status by Minister for Communications, Alex White, TD, allowing it to appear on Saorview. UTV Ireland went on air at 7.25pm on 1 January 2015. The opening night included an hour-long episode of Emmerdale and a New Year special presented by Pat Kenny. Five days later, the channel launched its national news service, Ireland Live. In June 2015, UTV Group reported losses of ‚Ç¨16.2 million on the network due to poor daytime and weekend ratings performance, and it was reported that the network was planning a revamp of its branding and lineup within the coming months. Managing Director Michael Wilson defended UTV Ireland's performance, noting that Coronation Street and Emmerdale were drawing larger audiences on UTV Ireland than on previous broadcasters, but admitted that their staff had gone \\"under the bonnet\\" to find means of improving the network's overall performance.\\\\- On 19 October 2015, ITV plc announced its intent to acquire UTV Group's television business, including UTV Ireland, for ¬£100 million, subject to regulatory approval. In December 2015, the deal was approved by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. The sale was completed on 29 February 2016, with the remainder of UTV Group operating as radio broadcaster Wireless Group (later sold to News UK). On 11 July 2016, ITV plc announced that it had sold UTV Ireland to TV3 Group, a division of Virgin Media Ireland, for ‚Ç¨10 million. As part of the deal, TV3 Group inherited UTV Ireland's ten-year programme supply contract with ITV (effectively re-uniting these rights with its previous owner). ITV director of operations and strategy Christy Swords stated that \\"Launching UTV Ireland last year represented a significant achievement by the teams in Dublin and Belfast in challenging circumstances\\", but that when ITV plc took over the network, they \\"concluded that bringing TV3 and UTV Ireland together under common ownership offers the best prospect of delivering a strong and sustainable Irish commercial broadcaster, underpinned by a long-term programming agreement with ITV\\". Virgin Media Ireland had acquired TV3 in 2015, and had begun to make major investments in the broadcaster. On 22 November 2016 it was announced that Coronation Street and Emmerdale would move back to TV3 beginning 5 December 2016. The next day, it was announced that UTV Ireland would be re-launched as be3 on 9 January 2017, as part of a wider re-branding of all three TV3 channels with new positioning and lineups. The re-branded channel would be primarily aimed towards women, and it was also announced that TV3's children's strand would also be moved to the channel. In the lead-up to the re-branding, the channel's operations were consolidated at the TV3 Group's main studio in Ballymount. Many of UTV Ireland's employees were laid off, but 40 new positions were offered within the TV3 Group. In June 2018, it was announced that be3 was rebranded as Virgin Media Three on 30 August 2018, as part of a rebranding of all three TV3 channels under the Virgin Media brand. Programming When branded as UTV Ireland, the channel relied heavily on imported ITV programming, but also broadcast some Irish-produced programming. Under the be3 brand, the channel was targeted towards women. =News and current affairs= Ireland Live was UTV Ireland's national news and current affairs service, airing two programmes at 5.30pm and 10pm on weeknights, with short updates on weekday mornings as part of a simulcast of Good Morning Britain. However, the station did not broadcast any weekend news programming, apart from morning weather forecasts. Following the re-launch as be3, Ireland Live was discontinued and replaced by the revamped 3News Ireland service. Mick McCaffrey, who led the Ireland Live news operation, was retained and made head of the new division, which produces bulletins for all three TV3 channels. = Children's = 3e's children's strand 3Kids moved to be3 upon its launch. =Entertainment= Pat Kenny, former host of The Late Late Show, presented a chat show called Pat Kenny in the Round, which was axed after one series. Kenny also hosted the station's launch night special, Out with the Old ‚Äì In with the U, on New Year's Day 2015. In July 2015, UTV Ireland began airing a weekly entertainment news bulletin with the station's weather presenter, Jenny Buckley, called The Pulse. The programme was sponsored by Diet Coke. The feature was extended into a weekly 30-minute magazine show in January 2016. As be3, Xpos√© moved over to the channel on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. =Lifestyle= Two of UTV's feature local programmes in Northern Ireland were adapted for viewers in the Republic. The long running travelogue series Lesser Spotted Ulster, presented by Joe Mahon, was rebranded to Lesser Spotted Journeys to focus on locations within the Republic of Ireland, additionally the agricultural programme Rare Breed was also adjusted to accommodate its audience in the Republic. =Imported programming=  As UTV Ireland  UTV's decision to enter the Republic's market followed the acquisition of broadcast rights to ITV programmes such as Coronation Street and Emmerdale from rivals TV3. UTV's Northern Ireland service had enjoyed a large following in the Republic up until the 2000s but its audience share had diminished following the arrival of Sky TV, which does not carry UTV. The company had profited greatly from high audience ratings in the Republic due to spillover and cable connections in the 1980s and 1990s. By and large, UTV Ireland replicated the Northern Ireland service, with some variations due to domestic programme rights for programmes not produced by ITV Studios (such as The X Factor, whose rights were held by TV3). The Graham Norton Show also aired on the channel on a delay from its UK broadcast on BBC One. Daytime programmes such as The Jeremy Kyle Show, Lorraine, This Morning and Loose Women also aired. The Jeremy Kyle Show has previously aired on TV3, while Loose Women also aired on TV3 for a period during 2008. ITV's flagship breakfast show, Good Morning Britain, was added to the station's lineup in February 2015. With Ireland Live updates being shown at 6:15, 7:15 and 8:10. Good Morning Britain simulcasts on the channel ended on Friday 6 January 2017. UTV Ireland also utilised ITV's back catalogue of programming, including drama series such as Vera, All3Media's Midsomer Murders and Foyle's War. When ITV announced they were buying UTV Ireland, ITV CEO Adam Crozier said he intended to strengthen the channel further with high-quality ITV programming at its core.  As be3  be3 airs many of ITV's drama programming and live studio shows, following a 10-year agreement between ITV plc and the TV3 Group. The channel also airs repeats of US court series Judge Judy and several ITV shows, such as Loose Women (live), Dickinson's Real Deal, Surprise Surprise, Who's Doing the Dishes?, The Cube and The Chase. Imported drama series include Wentworth and Bull.

His father is the well-known Jibrael Abu Diah.  Early education  Muhannad Abu Diah grew up in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Jeddah where he developed and had his elementary education. He was a normal child like other children, however, he was characterised by his curiosity and fondness of dismantling electrical devices and games to understand its secrets. This was surprising for his friends in a way they were mocking him. He then was forced to move to Riyadh, because of his father's job, where he continued his studies in intermediate and secondary schools in King Saud Educational Complex which has the greatest effect on continuing his scientific progress. He had participated in some national and international contests in physics, chemistry and inventions. He also was one of the participants in the Saudi Science Club and King Abdulaziz & His Companions Foundations For Giftedness and creativity and in the summer activities. After he continued his high school education, he joined King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals and graduated with the speciality of the industrial engineering. Not only that, but he also invests all his time, despite being busy with his studies, to continue working on some inventions and experiments on them. Moreover, he created with his colleagues an educational institution for releasing some educational courses in Physical and Electronic Arts on CDs which is the Physamedia Company for Scientific Media.

The five Ohio-class submarines under the command of Squadron 20 are , , , , and . These submarines carry the Trident missile and act as components of the United States' global presence for strategic deterrence. As a result, the Squadron is responsible for the continued operation, maintenance and certification of all U.S. ballistic missile submarines in the Atlantic fleet. In December 2011, two of the Squadron's submarines, and USS Wyoming, become some of the first US submarines to include women officers in their crews. Though women had been allowed to serve in combat roles in the rest of the Navy since 1993, there was concern that the cramped spaces onboard and long tours of submarine crews were unsuitable for women. This was the first step in the plan to fully integrate women onto all US Navy submarines. It was begun on the ballistic missile submarines because of their larger size as compared to the attack submarines, though there was the intent to eventually include those vessels as well in the future (and did begin in January 2015). Beginning in 2016, the Navy planned to add female non-commissioned officers to submarine crews that already included female officers with the intent to eventually bring the number of women among the enlisted crew up to 20%. Despite a few setbacks, including allegations that male sailors had secretly videotaped female shipmates in dressing areas, this process of integration continued.

Meeting House Hill in 1895. First Parish Church, center; Lyceum Hall, right. St. Peter's Church and Lyman Memorial Fountain, 1941. Meeting House Hill is one of the oldest sections of Boston's historic Dorchester neighborhood. It is the site of the First Parish Church (est. 1631) and the Mather School (est. 1639), the oldest public elementary school in North America. Located immediately to the north of Fields Corner, it is within walking distance of the Fields Corner and Savin Hill MBTA stations.  History  = Early America = Meeting House Hill was settled in the 17th century by Puritans who arrived on the Mary and John. It was originally called Rocky Hill, after the puddingstone outcroppings along its eastern slope. Most of the earliest homes in Dorchester were built on Savin Hill and Allens Plain (now the intersection of Pond, Cottage, and Pleasant Streets), but by 1668 there were at least two homesteads and a schoolhouse on the lower slope of Rocky Hill. Both the First Parish Church and the Mather School, named for its pastor, were originally located on Allens Plain. In 1673, oxen were used to move the church to the top of what came to be known as Meeting House Hill. The Mather School was rebuilt near the church in 1694. The First Parish Church has been rebuilt several times, and became a Unitarian church in the early 19th century under Reverend Thaddeus Mason Harris. The current structure was built in 1897. The church overlooks a small triangular park, originally called Dorchester Common, now named for the late pastor Reverend James K. Allen. A granite monument to Dorchester's fallen Civil War soldiers was erected there in 1867. Coppen Square, a small green at the corner of Bowdoin and Quincy Streets, was originally named Eaton Square after Percival Eaton, whose family kept a tavern there from the time of the American Revolution to the Civil War. Wagoners assembled at the tavern on the eve of the Fortification of Dorchester Heights. Coppen/Eaton Square is also the site of the Lyman Memorial Fountain, commissioned in the 19th century by Nahum Capen in honor of Boston mayor Theodore Lyman, Jr.Taylor (2005), pp. 66-67. The fate of the original fountain, which was larger and more ornate than the one that eventually replaced it, remains a mystery. = 19th century = From 1804 to 1846, Mrs. Judith Foster Saunders (b. 1772, Gloucester, Massachusetts; d. 1841, Boston) and Miss Clementina Beach (b. 1775, Bristol, England; d. 1855, Boston) ran an academy for young ladies at the corner of Adams and East Streets. They founded the school with the assistance of Saunders's cousin, the noted women's rights advocate and essayist Judith Sargent Murray. The girls were tutored in \\"Reading, Writing, English Grammar, Arithmetic, Plain Sewing, Embroidery, Tambour, French Language, Painting, and Geography, including the use of the Globes.\\" The school became known for the girls' exquisite embroideries, which are included in private collections and museums including the Museum of Fine Arts Boston and the Winterthur Museum. The original building still stands at 34 Adams Street. Lyceum Hall, next door to the First Parish Church, was an important center of the community for many years. The Greek Revival-style public meeting hall was built in 1838 and dedicated in 1840. The Lyceum hosted lectures, dances, school classes, and other public gatherings. Local women's abolition groups met there, and it served as a recruiting depot for the Union Army during the Civil War. It became a special needs school in 1891, and was demolished in 1955.Taylor (2005), p. 79. In the mid-19th century, thousands of Irish Catholics came to Boston, many settling in Dorchester. In 1872, less than 20 years after St. Gregory's Church was burned to the ground by Know- Nothing rioters, Bishop John Joseph Williams authorized the building of Saint Peter's Church on Bowdoin Street to serve the growing immigrant population. Father Peter Ronan was the parish's first pastor; he said his first mass in Lyceum Hall in October of that year. Ronan moved into a nearby cottage once occupied by \\"Mad Jack\\" Percival, one of the first commanders of the U.S.S. Constitution. The corner-stone of Saint Peter's Church was laid in 1873; it was dedicated in 1874, and finishing touches were added in 1891. Designed in the Gothic Revival style by noted church architect Patrick Keely, the church was built from puddingstone excavated from the site. It once had as many as 22,000 members. In the 1980s the steeple was found to be structurally unsound, and was removed. Many of the buildings in the area were constructed in the 19th century. Several homes near the First Parish Church date back to the Federal Period. The brick building at the corner of Winter and Bowdoin Streets is the former site of Shepard's Bakery, built by Otis Shepard in 1820; the bakery became famous for its \\"'Lection cakes\\" sold in the Town Hall on election days, and was kept in the Shepard family until 1907. The many triple- deckers in the area date back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when Boston's population was rapidly expanding. The Italianate, Georgian Revival, Queen Anne, and Colonial Revival styles are also represented. The firehouse at 7 Parish Street, housing Engine 17 and Ladder 7, was established circa 1870; the current structure was built in 1928. = 20th century and later = The City of Boston acquired the Capen family estate, \\"Mount Ida\\", in 1912, and converted part of it into an 11-acre public park. Designed by the Olmsted Brothers, the sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, Ronan Park is named for Father Peter Ronan, the first pastor of Saint Peter's Church. It commands one of the best views of Boston Harbor of any vantage point in Dorchester. Over the centuries, the demographics of Meeting House Hill have shifted. The original homogeneous English Protestant community gave way to Irish Catholics in the late 19th century, and other ethnic groups in the late 20th century. The area is now home to residents of primarily African-American, Cape Verdean, Hispanic, West Indian, and Vietnamese ancestry. A diverse selection of restaurants and markets can be found in the Bowdoin/Geneva area. To celebrate their heritage, residents hold an annual Multicultural Festival each summer in Ronan Park.  Geography  The top of Meeting House Hill is the highest point in Dorchester. The Imagist poet Amy Lowell wrote a poem describing the view of the \\"blue bay\\" from Meeting House Hill, and many local artists have painted the view from its summit. The Impressionist painter Childe Hassam, who grew up on Olney Street, enthused about the area: > \\"Dorchester was a most beautiful and pleasant place for a boy to grow up and > go to school--from Meeting House Hill and Milton Hill looking out on > Dorchester Bay and Boston Harbor with the white sails and the blue water of > our clear and radiant North American weather. ... if you like as fair as the > isles of Greece. ... and white houses often of very simple and good > architecture juxtaposed to it all.

The name initially derived from the Central Landing Establishment that developed them, although this was later backronymed to Container Light Equipment.  Design  CLE Canisters about to be loaded onto a Handley Page Halifax bomber of 148 Squadron, which will drop them on Yugoslav Partisans. Brindisi, Italy, c. 1944 Initially, the canisters were of wood and metal construction. The Mark 1 canister weighted around empty and when filled. It was cylindrical, long and in diameter. The Mark 1T canister was similar except it was of metal construction and slightly heavier, weighing empty and again when filled. The Mark III canister was similar, but slightly longer . One end of the canister carried a parachute pack. The parachute was deployed by a static line, which opened a pilot parachute, which in turn opened the main canopy. The other end of the canister was fitted with a pan-like structure that cushioned the impact of landing. The canisters' attachment system allowed them to be carried from the bomb-racks of bomber aircraft. The canisters could be fitted with four battery-powered lights, to make them easier to find when dropped at night. There were also experiments with fitting them with smoke markers.  Use and deployment  Clothing for anti-German partisans is packed into CLE canisters, Italy April-May 1945 The canisters could contain food, ammunition, weapons or other equipment - the Mark 1 canister could carry 12 rifles and 1000 rounds of ammunition. A cylindrical fuel can was also developed to fit the CLE Canister, with a canister able to accommodate three of the cans. Some loads, such as radios, weren't dropped in CLE Canisters and required special containers to carry and protect them.Steer (2000), p.97 Prepacked canisters were allocated code numbers according to their load; a unit requiring resupply simply had to communicate the code and the number of canisters required. The type of load was indicated by the colour of the parachute, so the contents could be identified without opening the container. The colours used were periodically changed to confuse the enemy. During Operation Market Garden, for example, the colours used were red for ammunition, green for rations, white for medical supplies, blue for fuel and yellow for communication equipment.Steer (2000), p.124-125 As well as World War II, the canisters saw use in Operation Musketeer - the 1956 Anglo-French invasion of the Suez Canal zone.

She was born in Harvey, Illinois. She is an African American contemporary artist and painter who explores race, gender, pop culture, homophobia and politics in her work. Personal life Abney was raised by her mother Karla, her aunt, and her grandparents in Chicago. Her mother was also an artist, and Abney looked up to her. Abney used to play with her mother‚Äôs oil paints in their basement. She liked Archie Comics, the Berenstain Bears, and Disney movies, and would mimic characters from them. After her mother remarried and had a second daughter, the family moved around a lot, and Abney and her sister would often be the only black children in their class at school. Abney first met her biological father, who is a police officer, when he pulled her mother over for an alleged traffic violation while they were driving through Indiana. In 2015, Abney said that she and her father started to rebuild their relationship. After a fire at their home, Abney and her mother moved in with her aunt in Matteson, Illinois where she attended Rich South Campus High School. Abney said that she would get teased about ‚Äútalking white‚Äù by other students. In order to connect with other students, she would take requests to draw ‚Äúportraits of famous black figures in pop culture‚Äù. Abney began to explore art more formally in high school. She always knew she wanted to be an artist, but was not sure what that would look like. She said that it took her a while to find her voice when speaking out about issues that matter to her like the #blacklivesmatter movement. She is always shocked that her work has been exhibited in museums. Her favorite emojis are the painting nails emoji and the poop emoji. Some of her influences are the animated series South Park and hip-hop music. She feels that, ‚Äúanyone can be an artist if they want to create and express themselves.‚Äù Her advice to aspiring artists is, ‚Äújust do it‚Äù. Style Her work uses symbols and bright colors to present new ways of approaching loaded topics as she invites viewers to draw their own conclusions. Blending the playful and the serious, Abney has said that her work is \\"easy to swallow, hard to digest.\\" Abney does not plan ahead or sketch, rather she works intuitively and with a rhythm. ‚ÄúWhat colors feel right next to each other‚Äù improvisation is a large part of her process and she doesn‚Äôt know what the end result will be as her work is a response to what she is feeling in the moment. Jeffery Deitch, an art dealer, curator, and former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, once compared her skill to that of artist Keith Haring. Abney‚Äôs style of painting is mostly graphic, cubist, and color blocked paintings and murals, using techniques like spray painting, collaging, and layering shapes and symbols. She doesn‚Äôt want her figures to be ‚Äúboxed in‚Äù and she wants her work to have multiple ‚Äúanswers‚Äù. Abney likes to switch around races and genders in her figures, so the viewer releases traditionally conformed ideas about the painting. She has stated, \\"I like to bring everybody's perspective in,‚Ä¶I'd approach it from both sides of the story\\". She uses symbolic imagery in unconventional ways to portray a deeper message, but also visually keeping the image simple. For example, in one painting Abney uses a heart in multiple ways that, depending where it is placed and what purpose it has, could have many different meanings. Additionally, Abney likes to keep humor in her work because the topics of her work are so serious. She does this by using vibrant colors and drawing ‚Äúcartoonish‚Äù figures. Abney feels that she works so instinctively now that she doesn‚Äôt know how to go back to her old style of painting. She wants her work to stay relevant and the message of her paintings to adapt to what is relevant in the future, ‚Äúso it can be read in an entirely new way‚Äù as times change. Education In high school, Abney was encouraged by one of her teachers to take AP art. This led her to attend Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois where she received a BFA with a dual major in studio art and computer science in 2004. While attending college, Abney took part in a campus-wide walkout in protest of the lack of diversity in the faculty, which contributed to the political focus of her art. After graduating, she took a year off working as an assembly line worker at Ford Motor Company. She quit after witnessing a co-worker get their leg crushed in an accident. She began to paint every day and was accepted to the Chicago Art Institute and the Parsons School of Design where she received an MFA in 2007. Abney decided to move to Jersey City to go to Parsons to get ‚Äúa sense of independence‚Äù. Career Abney is best known for her colorful graphic large- scale paintings, four of which are included in the 30 Americans exhibition organized by the Rubell Museum of works by African American artists of the last three decades, which has toured museums and galleries in America since 2008. Her work has also appeared in the Whitney Museum, the Jack Shainman Gallery, as well as the Kravets Wehby Gallery in Chelsea. At the start of her career, she felt that her work had to focus on race, but it has now evolved to focus more on whatever is relevant to her in the moment. She stated that, \\"Now [it‚Äôs] more reflective of what I actually deal with. Not that I don't deal with racism, but that's not my whole life\\" In 2007, Abney received recognition for her painting Class of 2007, done for her MFA thesis show. The painting is a diptych. In one panel, she is depicted as a blonde officer carrying a gun. In the second panel, her MFA classmates, all white, are painted as black inmates in orange uniforms. She has stated that putting her classmates into her painting was ‚Äúnothing personal‚Ä¶when I put people in my paintings now‚Äîit‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs just a face.‚Äù She also stated that the show was ‚Äú[her] only chance to get the attention of a gallery‚Äù. The painting was purchased by the Rubell family, owners of the Rubell Museum in Miami, Florida. Abney was the youngest artist to show in the 30 Americans exhibition that brought together the most current and influential African American artists contributing to the art world teachting. Abney worked at THEARC run by the Corcoran Gallery of Art‚Äôs after school program ArtReach with youth creating a permanent mural in the DC area. This program focused on the importance of celebrities in culture, how celebrities hold a level of significance in people lives on the same level as politics, and how they connect to race issues in this country. Abney has been a lecturer for universities and visual arts centers across the nation. In 2013, she was a guest lecturer at the New York Academy of Art and in 2015 she presented at the Summit Series in Utah. News sources including the Huffington Post, Forbes and Elle Magazine have discussed Abney's attempts to address radical political topics by blending genders and race. Exhibitions Dirty Wash was Abney's first show, hosted at Kravets/Wehby gallery in the spring of 2008. Attracting many major collectors, the show sold out within days. In November 2017, she had her first solo show at Jack Shainman Gallery in New York City, Nina Chanel Abney: Seized the Imagination This exhibition ran concurrently with Safe House, a solo show curated by Piper Marshall at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York City. The artist is known for her colorful canvases, which are at times frenzied or chaotic, packed with pop culture imagery and references to current events. Abney locates much of her work in the recognition that abuse and violence are an integral part of the everyday consciousness of people of color. Abney‚Äôs aim in both shows is to combat the negative stereotypes with which the mainstream media often portrays African Americans. In December 2017, Abney created her first 3D installation at 29Rooms in Los Angeles called Fair Grounds, an interactive experiential series of sculptures that evokes the childhood look and feel of a playground. Her first solo exhibition in a museum, Nina Chanel Abney: Royal Flush, opened at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina in February 2017. Curated by Marshall N. Price, the exhibition included about 30 of her paintings, watercolors, and collages and spans 10 years of her work. The works contain a wide range of art historical references, including medieval icons, Northern Renaissance still lifes, and artists such as Henri Matisse and John Wesley. They illustrate narcissism, celebrity culture, the objectification of women, issues of race, and police brutality. Abney stated that before she began working on this show, she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt know what it was going to look like‚Äù. She got multiple cans a spray paint in many different colors, painted the walls black, and taped up shapes to start. Before the show opened, she said she ‚Äúhoped that it makes people angry and a mix of reactions‚Äù. In her February 2018 exhibition Hot to Trot. Not. at Palais de Tokyo in Paris, Abney created site specific murals along the institution‚Äôs main stairwell. One depicts the busts of three black women against a yellow background, the numbers 1, 2, 3 listed under each one. Next to the figures, Abney painted ‚ÄúWHAT?‚Äù in black letters ‚Äî provoking viewers to look at the composition and then think critically about its meaning. In September 2018, Abney curated a group exhibition at the Jeffery Deitch gallery entitled Punch. The exhibition called upon current socio-political issues. The exhibition featured Abney herself and some of her close friends. There were paintings, photographs and sculptures included in the exhibition.

She was played by Charlotte Ross from Season 8 to 11. Ross had previously guest starred on the show as another character in two episodes of Season 5. Biography McDowell was from upstate New York, where her father had been the chief of police for the city of Saratoga Springs. She began her detective career as a \\"floater\\" working temporary assignments in whichever precinct was shorthanded until receiving permanent assignment to the 15th Precinct. Soon after her arrival, Lieutenant Arthur Fancy was promoted to captain, and McDowell did not hit it off with his intended replacement, Susan Dalto. Upon asking if it was too late for her transfer out of the 15th Precinct, Fancy counseled her to stay, so that she didn't develop a reputation as someone who couldn't get along with her superiors. Fancy ultimately solved the problem by engineering Dalto's transfer out; her replacement was Lieutenant Tony Rodriguez, with whom McDowell got along well. McDowell partnered first with Diane Russell, and later with Rita Ortiz. McDowell dealt with some dysfunction in her family; she had a baby when she was 16, and her parents insisted she give the girl up for adoption. She later contacted her daughter, by then a teenager, by arranging a fake arrest for smoking marijuana; the attempted reunion was unsuccessful. McDowell was told by her doctors that she could not become pregnant again; still desiring to be a parent, she began to help Andy Sipowicz by babysitting his son Theo. McDowell also had a sister, Michelle, who was in an abusive relationship; after several unsuccessful efforts by McDowell and her co-workers to stop the abuse, Michelle's boyfriend Frank killed her. McDowell ended up as the adoptive parent of her sister's child, after successfully fighting Frank's parents for custody. After McDowell became the adoptive mother of her niece, her relationship with Andy continued to blossom; soon afterwards, McDowell became pregnant, despite her previous medical prognosis. Despite their age difference, they decided to marry, and she gave birth to a son, Matthew. After giving birth, McDowell left work to stay at home and raise the three children in the blended family she and Sipowicz had created. (In reality, McDowell's pregnancy and departure from the show coincided with Ross's real life pregnancy.) She is referred to several times during the rest of the series, usually as Sipowicz is talking to her on the phone while he's at work.

The ward elects three county councillors to the County Council of the City and County of Cardiff. It has previously been represented by the Labour Party, until February 2019 when Plaid Cymru won one of the council seats. Description The ward boundaries are coterminous with the community of Ely, north of Cowbridge Road West. To the south is the Caerau ward, to the north are the Creigiau & St. Fagans and Fairwater wards. According to the 2011 census the population of the ward was 14,603. County elections =2019 by-election= Labour councillor (since 2012) Jim Murphy died in December 2018 aged 72. A by-election was arranged for 21 February 2019 which was won by Andrea Gibson for Plaid Cymru by 52 votes over the Labour candidate, a swing of 18% in comparison with the May 2017 election. The Labour leader of Cardiff Council described it as \\" a bad day, in a week of absolute political chaos nationally\\" (referring to the formation of The Independent Group at Westminster). =Elections 1995 to 2017= The ward had elected three Labour county councillors since 1995, when the new unitary authority was created.

At the 2004 elections, the Ely ward's Labour councillor of 30 years, Charlie Gale, stood as an Independent in an attempt to unseat (the then unpopular) Cllr Goodway. Goodway retained his seat by only 63 votes. Goodway immediately stood down as Council leader, but accused senior Labour figures of conspiring against him. =1973-1995= Prior to the formation of the new Cardiff unitary authority, Ely was a ward to Cardiff City Council (a district council of South Glamorgan). Six city councillors were elected at the 1973, 1976 and 1979 elections. This was reduced to three from the 1983 election onwards. Cllr Bill Buttle was one of the ward's representatives for 23 years, until stepping down in 1991. He was responsible for the Western Leisure Centre being built in Ely.

In the past he has been a professor at Lewis & Clark College and a blogger at Starts With a Bang, on ScienceBlogs and also on Forbes.com since 2016. Early life and education Siegel was born in 1978 to \\"a Jewish postal worker\\" and grew up in the Bronx, where he attended Bronx High School of Science until 1996. Siegel graduated from Northwestern University in 2000 with a triple degree including in physics and went on to earn his Ph.D. in astrophysics from the University of Florida. Career Siegel worked at Fermilab in 1997. He received his undergraduate degree in physics, classics and integrated science from Northwestern University in June 2000. He was unsure whether to continue studying and took the GRE Physics Test \\"just in case\\". He taught in high school in Houston and at King Drew Magnet High School of Medicine and Science in inner-city Los Angeles for a year and though he \\"liked some aspects\\" of teaching he then decided he did not want to teach any longer, had a crisis and, influenced by Carl Sagan's Cosmos, he went back into academia to study the universe. He studied theoretical cosmology, in particular cosmological perturbation theory, at graduate school at the University of Florida with advisor Prof. Jim Fry from 2001. He received his PhD in 2006. During his graduate studies he was a teaching assistant and lecturer in physics, he sat on the graduate student affairs committee, and he was an assistant coordinator for REU students. Siegel was a teaching assistant in undergraduate general physics at the University of Wisconsin in Spring 2007 and then took up a post-doctoral research post at the University of Arizona. In 2008, Siegel moved with his then fianc√©e to Portland, Oregon, after deciding to not pursue an ambitious research career with long hours and instead focus on science outreach and have a \\"fuller, richer life\\". He taught at the University of Portland and then Lewis & Clark College, where he was a visiting assistant professor. He later became science and health editor for Trapit.

His authoritarian attitude and his habit of making independent halakhic decisions roused the opposition of the other rabbis and of the communal leaders of Damascus, who united in an attempt to remove him from his position. In 1896 they turned to Moses ha-Levi, the Hakham Bashi, in Constantinople, who acceded to their request by appointing Solomon Eliezer Alfandari rabbi of Damascus. The two rabbis did not at first cooperate with each other. Later, however, Alfandari brought Abulafia into the sphere of his activities. Toward the end of his life Abulafia acted as rabbi in Tyre. From there he moved to Jerusalem, and finally to Tiberias, where he died. An outstanding halakhic scholar, his responsa Penei Yizhak were published in six volumes (1871-1906).

It was later sold to the University of Calgary in 1972. The play exists in two manuscripts and shows clear signs of authorial revision. Manuscripts In 1972, the University of Calgary acquired Edgar Osborne's collection of rare books and manuscripts, including The Humorous Magistrate(MsC132.27). The manuscript when acquired was untitled, dateless, and authorless. Under the direction of Professor Mary Polito, the manuscript was dated to the seventeenth-century, and was determined to have been written near or after 1640 due to political and socio-economic references within the text. After workshop performances in association with the University of Calgary drama department, the Calgary manuscript was linked to another untitled manuscript found in Arbury Hall, Warwickshire, United Kingdom in 2004. These are the only two known extant manuscripts of The Humorous Magistrate. The Arbury manuscript is an earlier version of the Osborne, containing more amendments and approximately ten thousand more words. The two manuscripts bear scribal similarities, and ongoing research indicates that the manuscripts were both written by John Newdigate III. Newdigate was an avid theatregoer, who wrote poetry and lived in Arbury Hall. Summary The play follows a Justice of the Peace named Thrifty, his daughter Constance, and her suitor Christopher Spruce, as well as their family, friends, and servants. The conventional romance of Constance and Spruce is paired with the satirization of judicial corruption and ineptitude as Thrifty abuses his role as Justice of the Peace. Subplots include the farcical shaming of Peter's wife Jenet, two other romantic plots, and the tropes of shepherds and thieves. In The Humorous Magistrate satire, romance, farce, and nonsensical narratives are combined to demonstrate the political and social unrest of the period while also acting as a self-aware comedic outlet. The Humorous Magistrate frequently uses allusion. Many of these allusions can be traced back to written works, while others incorporate more time-relevant, cultural references, such as Thrifty and Peter's argument about the Etcetera oath. Of all of the types of allusions used within the play, references to Greek mythology are the most common; this can be seen through characters such as Wild ‚Äìwho is shown invoking Hymen (god) and Hermes for good luck -and Mr. Wellcom ‚Äìwho makes reference to the prophetess Cassandra. The play also contains allusions to the Bible and sometimes uses religious diction. Reappearing themes in the play include the use of judicial language, religious language, and mentions of the natural world. The natural world, more generally, includes references to nature as well as medicinal practices and remedies. Performance Performance considerations include a simple stage where actors can exit from both wings, as stage directions in the play are referred to as ‚Äúdoor‚Äù and ‚Äúother door.‚Äù Often several characters are on stage at once; the final scene requires space to accommodate twenty actors. The script suggests four sets: Thrifty's office, Mistress Mumble's home, countryside, and a town square. The Humorous Magistrate script has twenty- seven speaking roles, plus shepherds, constables, and musicians. There are opportunities for doubling, such as thieves for shepherds. ). Props explicitly mentioned in stage directions are simple, and could be concrete or conceptual: an almanac, letters, tankard, money, fiddles, knives, pistols, jewels, hats, rope, carts, wig and powder, handkerchiefs, nux vomica, staff, rings, doublet, breeches, chairs, pens, a box of bottles, chickens and capons, food, and cup of sack (wine). Specific costumes are not referenced other than tufftaffata jerkin and doublet. Musically, the script refers to lute, drums, and vocals for one song, K. Arthur. The Humorous Magistrate is not considered a closet drama but no evidence exists of its performance in the 17th century. A University of Calgary 2005 performance, directed by Barry Yzereef as ‚ÄúMarriage Upon Marriage,‚Äù used contemporary costumes including leather jackets, jeans, toques, and ball caps. Characters were embellished with cigars, lipstick, suitcases, drum, glasses of whiskey, and the replacement of traditional instruments with a guitar. Sexual humour was explicit through actors‚Äô carnal mimicry and gestures; Yzereef focused on the play's overarching theme of complexities of the law, but also added a comedic take with music from the TV series Ally McBeal. The University of Calgary's 2010 performance, directed by Patrick Finn, became the first full-stage production in nearly 400 years. Designers constructed 17th century costumes, and musical instrumentation was period-specific, performed by university-level musicians. A fight coordinator enhanced physical comedy, while specific sound cues were created for Mistress Mumbles‚Äô and Thrifty's flatulence. The production borrowed the prologue and epilogue from the play's earlier Arbury Hall draft. Backdrops included a painted forest, and walls of windows for the town-square.

She has served as co-spokesperson for the Maya Leadership Alliance and is the founder and executive director of the advocacy organization, the Julian Cho Society. In 2015, she and the MLA were awarded the Equator Prize for their efforts in protecting indigenous rights. Early life Cristina Coc was born on 21 December 1981 in Laguna, a traditional Mayan village in the Toledo District of Belize. She was the youngest of four other daughters born to Maria (n√©e Baki) and Mateo Coc. Until she entered school, Coc was raised in Laguna, but seeking better education for their children, the family relocated to Punta Gorda, where Coc attended St. Peter Claver School. Her academic excellence led to a scholarship award to attend high school at the Toledo Community College, from which she graduated in 1998. Determined to continue her education, Coc applied St. John's College, Junior College (SJCJC) and was accepted, but had to leave school because of financial and personal hardship. Career In 1999, Coc began working at the Toledo Christian Academy in the rural part of the Toledo District. After a year of employment, she had earned enough money to return to SJCJ and her schooling. She became involved in student government and became active in a dispute over bus fares. At the completion of her studies, Coc returned to Punta Gorda and began working as an English teacher at Julian Cho Technical High School (JCTHS). She actively worked for equal treatment and respect of Mayan students at JCTHS and participated in a liaison program with the Janus Foundation, which taught her mobilization and motivational skills. In 2003, Coc moved to Duluth, Minnesota to pursue a bachelor of science degree in biology at the University of Minnesota. Once again, during her studies, she worked in social justice and women's organizations. Upon completion of her degree, Coc returned to the Toledo District in 2005 and founded the Julian Cho Society (JCS), an indigenous rights organization named for a former Maya activist. As Executive Director, Coc led the organization to drive sustainable development, as well as social and human rights protection programs. In 2006, Coc served as a spokesperson, organizer and provided testimony in a landmark case involving Maya land rights. The government of Belize had granted US Capital Energy‚ÄîBelize Ltd. rights to conduct seismic testing for oil in the Sarstoon-Temash National Park. The Maya villages whose traditional lands extended into the park were not consulted, as they had not been when the park was created as a nature preserve in 1994. A co-management agreement had later been negotiated between the communities and the government, which the indigenous communities felt had been violated by the government authorizing oil prospecting. Coc helped organize the Maya to prepare a lawsuit and along with Greg Choc was appointed a spokesperson for the Maya Leaders Alliance (MLA). Presenting testimony on the customary land tenure of the Maya and the history and ethnography of the region, Coc and Choc urged that the traditional boundaries and land tenure of southern Belize be respected and that the government cease granting logging and mineral extraction contracts on Maya lands. On 18 October 2007 the Toledo Maya won their case The government was ordered to protect the traditional boundaries and land tenure of southern Belize. The case also required that discussion of land management in the Mayan communities must involve the communities and that their human rights must be protected by the government. Since the initial ruling, the Maya led by Coc and the MLA have returned to court, in 2008 winning their case in the Supreme Court in 2010; in 2011, before the Appeals Court, and all the way to the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) in 2013. Despite their repeated wins, Coc's case alleged that the government was continuing issuing permits for drilling oil on Maya lands. In 2015, the CCJ upheld the land rights of the Maya, ordering the Government of Belize to protect their rights and pay reparations. Within a few months of the verdict, Coc was arrested, along with other members of the MLA, and accused of unlawfully detaining a non-Mayan, who was building a house on sacred land. The Maya had previously notified the Belize Defence Force, the Belize Institute of Archeology and the Punta Gorda Police, about the illegal construction, but no action was taken to stop Rupert Myles from building. When Myles bulldozed a part the Uxebnka Archaeological Project Maya leaders asked him to stop. Myles initially threatened use of a firearm, and was detained. Prime Minister Dean Barrow alleged that the detention of Myles was racially motivated, allegations which were denied by Coc and the MLA. Coc was seen as the main instigator of the dispute, and she, along with a dozen other Maya leaders were arrested and charged with unlawful detention and common assault. The incident escalated to international levels with the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples calling on the Government of Belize to \\"establish a dialogue with Maya leadership\\" and resolve the case, as well as land tenure issues of Belize's Maya people. In December 2015, the charges of unlawful imprisonment were dropped and in June 2016 the prosecution of the remainder of the charges were halted. Coc continues in her fight to enforce the land tenure rights the Maya people won in their landmark judgement and has returned to the CCJ to enlist their help in monitoring the Government of Belize's compliance. She and the other members of the MLA were awarded in 2015 with the Equator Prize for their advocacy on indigenous rights.

He is the founder and head of Altermind, a consultancy firm based in Paris and London. He also created with Emile Servan-Schreiber, the predictive markets company Hypermind. He is an affiliate professor at Sciences Po Paris. He is the author of many essays on liberalism and works as an editorialist for the French weekly political magazines Le Point and Le Figaro.  Life and career  Laine is the son and grandson of doctors. He developed a great interest for Economics in high school. In 1993, he was admitted to the prestigious Sciences Po Paris. However, he dropped out the very first year in order to work with the liberal politician, Alain Madelin. In 1995, he was actively engaged in Jacques Chirac‚Äôs campaign to French presidency. After three years devoted to politics, he went back to university at the elite French law school Assas from which he graduated in business law. He also graduated in Finance at Sciences Po Paris and is registered at the Paris Bar. From 2001 to 2007, Laine worked as corporate lawyer for Bredin Prat and then for Brandford-Griffith. In 2005, after having been deputy-director of the Institut Turgot, he joined the board of the Association pour la libert√© √©conomique et le progr√®s social (ALEPS). In 2007, he founded the consultancy firm Altermind. Altermind offers academic expertises advocating for liberalisation of markets, produces studies of behavioral and experimental economy to competition authorities and delivers strategy consulting to heads of major companies. In 2009, he became an advisor for the Fondation pour l‚Äôinnovation politique (Foundation for Political Innovation) in charge of a taskforce on economic growth. In 2011, he worked as an advisor for Marc Simoncini on the launch of his website dedicated to the online sale of glasses and low-priced lenses, which eventually led to the opening up of the optics market. He also advised numerous heads major companies and entrepreneurs such as Vincent Bollor√©, Alexandre Bompard, David Dayan, Thierry Petit, St√©phane Courbit, Giovanni Castellucci and Jean-Charles Decaux. In 2014, he created Altermind UK in London. In 2015, he created Hypermind with Emile Servan-Scheiber, a company specialised in prediction markets. He teaches Economics and Political Philosophy at Sciences Po. In 2019, he was appointed affiliate professor at Sciences Po where he created a lecture class course named \\"Freedom in the 21st century\\". = Other positions = * Member of the editorial committee of the Revue Commentaire * Member of the French social club Le Si√®cle * Director of Showroompriv√© since October 2015, in charge of the nominations and remunerations committee  Political and intellectual views  Apart from his works as an essayist, Laine works as editorialist for the French magazines Le Point and Challenges. He regularly publishes articles voicing a liberal agenda in French newspapers such as Le Figaro, Le Monde, L‚ÄôExpress or Les Echos. From 2007 to 2010, he was a weekly columnist for Le Figaro-Magazine. He also worked as columnist for the magazine L‚ÄôOpinion the year of its launch. = Political views = In 2002, Laine published an open letter to the then French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin about his ¬´ cent jours ¬ª as head of the cabinet. He met Emmanuel Macron in 2008, then banker at Rothschild. Laine was one of the firsts to encourage Emmanuel Macron to run for the French presidency. In December 2015, a year before his candidacy, he publicly invited him to do it in an article published in Le Point. In 2016, he explained he was advising both Emmanuel Macron and Fran√ßois Fillon in the presidency race due to their liberal sensibility. He even considered an alliance between Macron and Fillon. In April 2017, he publicly supported Emmanuel Macron for the first round of the presidential election. He is an active advisor of Emmanuel Macron since his election. He convinced him during the summer 2017 to implement tax reforms in 2018 and not 2019, contrarily to the Prime Minister‚Äôs 2017 Policy Address. = Intellectual views = Individual freedoms are the very core of Laine‚Äôs thought. He criticised government interventionism as well as modern socialism, which are, according to him, common to both the left and right wings. He asserts that only ‚Äòthe power and the primacy of freedom‚Äô can be salutary for France. In his first essay, (The Great Nursery) in 2006, he argues that the actions of the ¬´ Etat Nounou ¬ª (the nursing state) are breaking ‚Äòthe individual energies, the growth and the sense of responsibility‚Äô by implementing preventive and prohibitive regulations. He considers those regulations to be freedom destroying and demonstrates their inefficiency due to their ‚Äòsuffocating‚Äô effects on individuals. He proposes an alternate liberal approach based on individual responsibility and on lesser governmental activities. In Post Politique (2009) he depicts an archaic political power and advocates for a post-politics society where the individuals abandon the idea of an omnipresent and almighty political power. In 2012, he conducted the publication of the works of 65 worldwide authors in the Dictionnaire du lib√©ralisme (Dictionary of liberalism). = Musical tale = Mathieu Laine wrote Le Roi qui n'aimait pas la musique, a children musical tale published by Antoine Gallimard. Several of his friends contributed to his project, Karol Beffa (composer), Patrick Bruel (narrator), Renaud Capu√ßon (violinist), Paul Meyer (clarinetist) and Edgar Moreau (cellist).

Built about 1740, it is a prominent local example of Georgian colonial architecture. It is also important as the site of the first Episcopal Church election in the United States. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. It is open for regular tours between May and October, and by appointment. Description The Glebe House stands near the southern end of Woodbury's main village, on the south side of Hollow Road near its junction with Connecticut Route 317. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a modified saltbox profile. Its front roof has two faces in the gambrel form, and the rear face, also gambreled, is slightly curved, extending down to the top of the first floor. It has a five-bay front facade, with a center entrance topped by a transom window and corniced entablature. The building interior retains many original features, including one of the largest known kitchen fireplaces in the state.  History  The Glebe House was built around 1740 for the Rev. John Rutgers Marshall and his wife Sarah as the rectory for St. Paul's Church in Woodbury. The Marshalls lived there from 1771 until 1785. On March 29, 1783, it was the site of the first episcopal election in the United States. Ten clergy met at the house and selected Samuel Seabury and Jeremiah Leaming as candidates for Bishop of Connecticut. Leaming was the first choice of the clergy and Seabury as backup if Leaming declined, which he did, due to age and health. After the Marshalls left the house, it fell into disrepair by the 1920s. In 1923, the house was purchased by Edward C. Acheson, Bishop Coadjutor of Connecticut, who formed the Seabury Society for the Preservation of Glebe House. Under the direction of Henry Watson Kent, the Secretary of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the house was restored. In 1926, Gertrude Jekyll was commissioned to design an \\"old fashioned\\" garden to enhance the newly created museum. Her design included a hedge with a flower border and path leading to the door; a small, formal garden and six vegetable plots in the rear of the house; and narrow borders flanking the door.

SGTs' trailers are known as Safe Secure Trailers (SST). History The Safeguards Transporters and Safe Secure Trailers were designed by the Sandia National Laboratories and built on the frame of commercial Peterbilt 18-wheel tractor trailers in about 2000. The Safeguards Transporters replaced what was later revealed to have been the first generation of Department of Energy nuclear weapons carriers. While the number of Safeguards Transporters in operation is not published, in 2006 the NNSA said it hoped to increase the fleet to 37. Sandia was, as of 2016, in the early design process of a new generation of nuclear weapons carriers known as the Mobile Guardian Transporter. Design and features SGTs, and the Safe Secure Trailers (SSTs) they tow, are described by the NNSA as \\"technologically advanced vehicles\\" that have the capability to safely withstand punishing highway accidents and keep cargo safe in the event of complete immolation of the vehicle. If a SGT comes under attack, unspecified security features in the vehicles give them, according to the NNSA, the capability to \\"surprise and delay even the most aggressive adversary\\". The full range of defensive components in SGTs is unknown, but according to some media reports the vehicles are equipped with autonomous weapons systems and other \\"high-tech surprises\\" that allow them to independently engage and repel attackers even if all human crew have been killed or disabled. The NNSA has also stated that access to nuclear weapons held within a SST is not possible, even for crew members, due to unspecified security features that prevent the doors from being opened except in \\"an approved security area\\". To frustrate easy identification of nuclear weapons convoys and deter potential hijack or attack, SGTs do not display any unique livery or other markings, and are purpose-built to mirror the appearance of civilian tractor-trailers. Brigadier General Stephen L. Davis of the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration, test drives a Safeguards Transporter in 2015. When traveling, the tractor and trailer are typically escorted by three dark colored Chevrolet Suburbans, each containing four armed crew members. Additionally, all missions include heavily armed aerial support. The semi- tractor(STG) itself is heavily armored, and equipped with a Caterpillar diesel engine coupled to an automatic transmission. The cab-over tractor is a sleeper design, but instead of a bed, it has two seats containing additional armed support crew. The tractor also contains firing ports, run flat tires, and automatic sanders for slick roads. The tractor and support vehicles are in constant contact with their dispatch, including real-time video streams of their journey. Local law enforcement is typically informed of a \\"special mission\\" coming through their sector, although they may not be informed as to the specifics of the mission. The transport trailer (SST) is the width of a standard trailer (96 inches or 8 Feet). While the trailer appears conventional from the outside, the back doors are over 12\\" thick, and an average-sized male can put their arms out from their sides and lay their palms flat against the wall. There are three sets of nozzles coming out of the ceiling. One nozzle purges the air out, the other nozzle fills the trailer with a noxious chemical to disable an attacker. This system can be activated from the cab of the truck, by any one of the escort teams (each vehicle is a team), or from dispatch. Finally there is an inclinometer - if the trailer becomes off level by a certain degree, the entire inside of the trailer is filled with expanding, fast-hardening foam. Procedures and operation SGTs are operated by armed employees of the NNSA who are \\"authorized to use deadly force\\" to prevent attempts to access the vehicle, and are typically escorted by a fleet of other unmarked vehicles mounting armed NNSA personnel. According to the NNSA, SGTs avoid travel in inclement weather; in the event adverse weather conditions are encountered en route to a destination, SGTs can seek shelter in previously identified, secure roadside facilities. The movement of SGTs on highways is monitored from a dispatch center in Albuquerque, New Mexico known as the Transportation and Emergency Control Center (TECC). In the event of an attack on a SGT, the TECC makes contact with predesignated state law enforcement agencies to assist in the defense of the vehicle. Due to the possibility that an armed attack may involve an adversary with the capability to realistically present itself as law enforcement or military forces, a \\"sign-countersign\\" system is in use; the TECC provides \\"countersigns\\" to responders which they are required to use to signal NNSA defenders when approaching a SGT that is under attack. The NNSA has advised local law enforcement to \\"take cover\\" in the event they signal an incorrect countersign to NNSA personnel when attempting to provide aid during a threat incident. Photos of vehicles Until 2009 only one known, publicly available photo of a Safeguards Transporter existed, which was shot in 2005 by a private photographer as the vehicle was departing a naval station in South Carolina.

Biography Mahoney was born in Lambeth, London and attended Beckenham College of Art before studying at the Royal College of Art, RCA, from 1922 to 1926. At the RCA his fellow students included Edward Bawden and Barnett Freedman, who gave him the nickname Charles which Mahoney adopted for his professional career. In 1928, Mahoney accepted a teaching post at the RCA and would continue to work there until 1953. During this period he led the Colleges' composition class and later the Mural Room. Mahoney and a group of current and former students, which included Evelyn Dunbar and Mildred Eldridge, were commissioned to decorate the assembly hall of Brockley County School for Boys, in south London with a series of murals illustrating Aesop's fables, that were unveiled in 1936. Other mural commissions completed by Mahoney included The Pleasures of Life for the concert hall at Morley College, which stood alongside the murals Bawden and Eric Ravilious were creating there for the college refectory, two works at the Festival of Britain in 1951 and a mural for the Lady Chapel at Campion Hall in Oxford. The Morley College murals were unveiled by Stanley Baldwin in 1930 but were destroyed by bombing during the Second World War. In 1937, Mahoney wrote the book Gardeners' Choice which was illustrated by Dunbar. Mahoney married the calligrapher, and fellow RCA tutor, Dorothy Bishop in 1941, while the RCA was evacuated to Ambleside, and from 1945 the couple lived in Wrotham in Kent. Mahoney, who was a skilled botanist, often depicted the gardens there in his drawings. From 1954 to 1963, Mahoney taught at the Byam Shaw School of Art and from 1961 until 1968 at the Royal Academy Schools. He exhibited with the New English Art Club from 1936 and at the Royal Academy from 1960. Mahoney was elected an associate member of the Royal Academy in 1961 and elected a full Academician in 1968. A memorial exhibition for him was held at the Ashmolean Museum in 1975 and, during 1999 and 2000, the Harris Museum and Art Gallery in Preston hosted a large display of his work which also toured.

Hunger marketing is a psychological strategy that focuses on the desire of consumers, making them hungry thus having strong desire to buy products which other people also want to buy. By stimulating psychology, it drives people into emotional rather than rational decision making by means of driving up the scarcity of the product. This marketing strategy boosts people‚Äôs interest, and through word-of-mouth helps businesses have more potential customers.  Related concepts  = Rational decision making = Rational decision making means what people do when they are not lacking what they need while making decisions. They are fully informed and can research their choices. Usually, people try to get and buy the best items with good prices, and for this, they think, judge, and calculate the benefits, price, and many things that are important for the deals. At this point, if people do rational decision making, people can have the best deals with good price. = Emotional decision making = In contrast to rational decision making, emotional decision making is what people do without caution, but with feeling or emotion, much like intuitive decision making. Because people get attracted by many stimuli, they make decisions without being careful. Also, it means that they are lacking of information of alternatives, time to search or calculate, and reasonable thinking. This is exactly what many businesses try to make people, spending more money without rationality.  Techniques  Three representative techniques of hunger marketing are described below; Limited stock, time limit and special discounts. = Limited stock = Limited stock is the most representative technique of hunger marketing. It is also one of the strongest causes, which affects consumers directly and most powerfully. Many companies have not supplied their items adequately. Because it is hard for consumers to get and buy the product, they think that the item is really good and popular. As a result of this strategy, companies could get higher reputation of their items. Xiaomi has a strong strategy to supply their items inadequately so that they can do good inventory management and control the costs of shipping. Also, they can get increased demand. By restricting their supply, companies could make a kind of rumor that the item they sell is really good and add higher value to their product and even the price of their product, because the fact people wait in long lines or a product sold out in a couple of minutes makes people have illusion that the item seems really amazing. = Time limit = Time limit is the most common technique of hunger marketing. Time limit also has huge impact on consumption because It is one of the direct stimuli to consumers. It is used in many home shopping and internet shopping sites. QVC, one of the biggest home shopping website, has a banner on their first page and it says ‚ÄúEnds in time‚Äù, which is limited with a comment, and ‚ÄòToday‚Äôs special value‚Äô in order to attract consumers‚Äô attention. Also, ‚Äúalmost sold out!‚Äù or ‚Äúwe are about to terminate selling! In a minute!‚Äù is a comment often used in home shopping sites or flight and hotel sites, and it stimulates customers‚Äô interests. ‚ÄúThe time limit for this product,‚Äù or ‚ÄúOnly 10 items left‚Äù is the case that companies try to attract people‚Äôs attention as well. This time limitation strategy is often used with special discounts strategies such as ‚ÄúOnly today, up to 50%.‚Äù In fact, by limiting the time of offering their products, they make consumers have feeling like ‚ÄúI am allowed to buy this product only this time!‚Äù = Special discounts = Special discounts is the strongest technique of hunger marketing. Special discounts also have huge impact people‚Äôs consumption. People have experienced like ‚ÄúOh, I should buy this because it is really cheap!‚Äù, even though the thing is something that people didn‚Äôt plan to buy. It is usually happening at an outlet where people suddenly stop or a TK Maxx. While web surfing, sometimes, people buy a flight and hotel ticket unexpectedly because they are attracted by special discounts. It is because consumers are really sensitive to price and many marketing strategies try to touch this sensitive point. There is a lot of research about people‚Äôs reaction to the special discounts, and, in order to influence consumers‚Äô emotion, many companies try to emphasize their discounted price. People have very emotional reaction and they are easily impressed by discounts price. An experiment showed that people who get a big discount are happier than some people who could get only change after the experiment. For sure, people really like cheap price, but the point of this strategy is that people tend to spend more money than they expect when they are exposed to discounted price. Retailers strive to have impact on consumers‚Äô emotion, which has big influence on their decision making, and this is the reason why people spend our money unexpectedly after they get free 20% discounts coupon from E-bay because the discounts coupon stirs consumers‚Äô emotion and consumption up by the most sensitive thing, which is price.  Examples  = Xiaomi and Asus = Xiaomi, the third biggest smartphone company in the world, has been known for their hunger marketing, and Asus also uses this strategy as well. ‚ÄúSold out in just 50 seconds!‚Äù This comment is what an article said when Xiaomi released their latest smart phone, Mi Note 2, and it made more people focus on their new product. When Xiaomi releases their new items, they make the shortest time record every time they sell the new item. Their new item was only available on their official website to buy, and people who pre-registered could get a chance to buy that. Only for them, Xiaomi sold their product. This is how Xiaomi controls their supply. Asus also adjusts their supply to release their new product at different intervals. Because of this, they could get people‚Äôs reaction from all over the world after they release their product in a country for the first time. People who get the new product leave some comments online and people from all of the world can see their reviews. It makes them more curious about the new item. = Black Friday = Black Friday is one of the times that people feel they need to buy some stuff because, in this season, many stores offer huge discounts. Creating the mood of shopping that people spend a lot of money is coming from making a sense of urgency that many businesses use. Many companies emphasize Thanksgiving with the big discounts they offer and try to make mood of consumption, and only at this time, many stores add more services like giveaways, free wrapping or even free shipping services. As a result of this evidence, people react to the stimuli and hoard by spending their money unexpectedly.

He is currently the eligious leader of Congregation Habonim Toronto a Toronto synagogue founded by Holocaust survivors. He is also the National Director of March of the Living Canada, Director of Education for March of the Living International, Director of March of Remembrance and Hope Canada, and Chairman of the Canadian Friends of the Israel Guide Dog Center for the Blind. Rubenstein has produced and directed numerous films featuring stories of the Holocaust. He is a noted Jewish storyteller, a member of the team that organizes \\"Because God Loves Stories\\" which is part of the annual Toronto Storytelling Festival. He frequently writes for the Canadian Jewish News and his work has also been featured in the National Post, the Montreal Gazette, and on CBC radio and television. He was also interviewed for the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. Early life Eli Rubenstein was born in Toronto to Isadore Rubenstein and Esther Rubenstein (n√©e Greenblatt). His father, born in Canada, was the son of immigrants from Tarlow and O≈ºar√≥w, Poland. His mother was born in Szatm√°rcseke, a village in Eastern Hungary, but fled with her family to the US in 1941 just before Nazi Germany closed the borders. He is the first cousin of Donald Trump's chief legal advisor and United States Special Representative for International Negotiations, Jason Greenblatt, and the first cousin once removed of anti-war activist Robert Greenblatt. Education He attended Eitz Chaim School and Yeshivas Ner Yisroel of Toronto in Toronto as well as Telshe Yeshiva in Cleveland and Bais Hatalmud Yeshiva in Jerusalem, Israel. He received a degree in humanities from York University in Toronto, as well as studying at Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, Israel, the University of Judaism in Los Angeles, California, and the International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism in Farmington Hills, Michigan. Congregation Habonim Rubenstein has served as religious leader of Congregation Habonim Toronto since 1988, succeeding Rabbi Allen Veaner, who followed Rabbi Reuben Slonim. It is the first synagogue in Canada founded by Holocaust survivors. Rubenstein, along with Esther Ghan Firestone, founded the Habonim Youth Choir, whose recordings of Lay Down Your Arms, Eli, Eli, Zog nit keyn mol, and other songs have been featured in several films. He has spearheaded partnered programs with many other organizations including Ve‚Äôahavta (for their annual Passover Seder for the Homeless), Sara and Chaim Neuberger Holocaust Education Centre, Free the Children, the Polish Consulate, March of the Living, the Toronto Partnership Minyan, and other organizations. In 2015, amidst a growing membership and religious school, Rubenstein led the synagogue in a new building campaign to replace its decaying structure, which eventually raised over 12 million dollars. Groundbreaking took place in the summer of 2018, and the new building was opened in the fall of 2019. After the first service took place in the new synagogue, Rubenstein said, ‚ÄúOn that momentous first day, I carefully watched families sitting in the rows during the services, facing the bimah and the east window as the sun poured in, with the trees in the background.‚Ä¶ Most importantly, I saw children joyously running around the courtyard, racing each other and playing tag.‚Äù March of the Living Tarlow Synagogue Ruins- Eli Rubenstein-Sep. 14, 2011 - SAM 0055 Rubenstein has been involved with March of the Living since its inception in Canada in 1988. It is an annual educational program that brings together thousands of youth in Poland and Israel to mark Holocaust Remembrance Day and Israel's Independence Day. He assumed the role of National Director in 1989 and led his first Canadian delegation on the March in 1990, where he first encountered Elie Wiesel. Wiesel features prominently in Rubenstein's published works, and he also produced the music for the TV special featuring Elie Wiesel's return to Auschwitz with Oprah Winfrey. In April 2017, Elisha Wiesel, the only son of Elie Wiesel, accepted an invitation from Rubenstein to attend the March of the Living, where he lit a torch in memory of his father and delivered a speech to the estimated 10,000 participants. \\"It is a reminder to all of us that we are the next generation. We must all pick up the torch,\\" Rubenstein commented, in an article in The New York Times that appeared after the event. Over the years, Toronto has consistently brought the single largest delegation on the March of the Living, and Canada is among the countries with the largest delegation. He also currently serves as the Director of Education for March of the Living International. In 2019, Rubenstein spearheaded a partnership between the USC Shoah Foundation and the International March of the Living. The initiative involves the recording of Holocaust survivor testimony on location in Europe, using cutting-edge, 360-degree filming techniques at the physical locations of their pre-war and wartime experiences, as well as their places of liberation. The purpose of this project is to ensure that March of the Living participants continue to benefit from survivors' stories relevant to the locations they visit during the March of the Living in Poland. ‚ÄúThis outward-facing radial filming technique in the very locations of the survivors‚Äô personal experiences provides a potent pathway for audiences to experience the survivors' stories\\", in a way that words alone could never encapsulate,‚Äù Rubenstein said. March of Remembrance and Hope In 2001, Rubenstein and colleagues Dr. David Machlis and Carla Wittes, established the March of Remembrance and Hope (MRH) a program designed for university and college students of all religions and backgrounds. The program takes place in mid-May, and includes a two-day trip to Germany, followed by a five-day visit to Poland. Interfaith and Intercultural Work Rubenstein has worked to create bonds with diverse groups in Canada and abroad. The March of Remembrance and Hope program he cofounded brings together Canadian students of diverse backgrounds - First Nations, Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Bahai, Jewish, and others - to study the roots of hatred and prejudice on their trips to Holocaust sites in Germany and Poland. The groups are accompanied by Holocaust survivors and survivors of other genocides, including students who survived the genocides in Rwanda and Darfur. He is also an advocate for recognizing the historic injustice visited upon Canada's First Nations, recording the life story of Chief Rodney Monague of Christian Island, and his experience in a Canadian residential school. Together with Ve‚Äôahavta, Rubenstein organized an evening honouring Chief Monague for his efforts on behalf of his people on Christian Island (a First Nations Island in Georgian Bay where Rubenstein summers),and for overcoming his traumatic early years. Representing the Christian Island Cottagers Association board, he has encouraged First Nation youth to embrace their culture and be proud of their heritage. In the area of Holocaust education, Rubenstein has advocated for positive relations between Poland and Jews of Polish heritage, emphasizing the 1000 years of Jewish life in Poland, pioneering Polish-Jewish dialogue on the March of the Living, as well as working to recognize the heroic actions of Righteous Among the Nations, especially those of Polish origin. He has been quoted as saying,‚ÄúWe can debate the history of Jewish life in Poland over the centuries ‚Äì and there are many divergent views on this subject. But there is no excuse now for not reaching out to today‚Äôs Poland, building bridges and fostering positive relations. We may not be able to forge a consensus about the past, but it is in our hands ‚Äì indeed our obligation ‚Äì to create a harmonious present and future for Jews and Poles.‚Äù As part of Toronto's annual Holocaust Education Week, he has spoken at a number of interfaith programs including ones at the Holy Trinity Armenian Church and St. Ansgar Lutheran Church in Toronto. OISE Affair In July 2010, Jennifer Peto, a student at Ontario Institute for Studies in Education [OISE], at University of Toronto submitted her master thesis titled \\"The Victimhood of the Powerful: White Jews, Zionism and the Racism of Hegemonic Holocaust Education\\" Ms. Peto contended that two of Rubenstein's programs - the March of the Living and the March of Remembrance and Hope - were instruments of ‚ÄòZionist propaganda‚Äô. Peto claimed both programs, along with the Canadian Jewish community, used the Holocaust to deflect attention from Jewish privilege, and various unjust acts, including Jewish-Canadian responsibility for the genocide of Aboriginal peoples, the promotion of a sense of victimhood that marginalizes the experiences of non-white participants, covering up of the actions of \\"racist and imperialist Israel\\", and the further entrenchment of white privilege of Jews in the West. Peto was widely criticized for her thesis, for among other reasons, not interviewing any staff, students, survivors or chaperones involved with either of these programs, and for relying entirely on internet research to reach her conclusions. OISE was also criticized as having lax academic standards, for accepting a thesis without appropriate sources. Criticism of Peto was widespread in Canada and abroad, including the Ontario Legislature. \\"It‚Äôs not scholarship, it‚Äôs ideology. It‚Äôs totally ahistorical; I found it full of untruths and distortions and held together by fatuous and very flabby analysis. It borders on anti-Semitism. . .I‚Äôm appalled that it would be acceptable to a major university\\", commented Canadian historian Irving Abella. University officials and others defended Peto, arguing that academic freedom was a critical value. Peto attributed the controversy to a smear effort by \\"right-wing, pro-Israel groups and individuals.\\" \\"This is not the first time I have been dragged through the mud by pro-Israel groups and I am sure it will not be that last,\\" she said. In an op-ed in the National Post, Rubenstein responded that contrary to Peto's belief that the March of the Living is a \\"racist\\" program, \\" recently published impartial studies show the exceptionally positive long-term impact of the March of the Living on universal values. In the area of commitment to human rights (fighting genocide and combating general racism) an average increase of 89% was recorded since their [the students‚Äô] participation in the March of the Living. 87% felt an increase in their feelings of tolerance for other groups after their experience on the program. These same students surveyed also felt a heightened commitment to their Jewish identity and Israel after the trip, illustrating that a commitment to Israel and to human rights are mutually compatible values.\\" A number of Canadian Holocaust survivors commented that they were \\"very hurt‚Äô and \\"extremely upset\\" by Peto's views. Published works Witness: Passing the Torch of Holocaust Memory to New Generations is a large format volume, published by Canadian Second Story Press, inspired by a 2014 United Nations exhibit of reflections and images of Holocaust survivors and students who have traveled on the March of the Living since 1988 and the March of Remembrance and Hope since 2001. The exhibit and book are intended to educate a new generation of students about the atrocities of the Second World War. The book includes an introduction from Pope Francis. Translations in several other languages are already in the works. The book includes an interactive feature ‚Äì survivor images viewed through a smart phone, will take the reader to their testimonies on the websites of the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education or the March of the Living Digital Archive Project. For You Who Died I Must Live On: Reflections on the March of the Living was published in 1994 by Mosaic press and was the recipient of a Canadian Jewish Book Award. Exhibits Witness book coverIn 2014, along with Dr. Lara Silberklang, Rubenstein created a Holocaust-related exhibit called, \\"When you Listen to a Witness You Become a Witness\\" which was displayed at the United Nations for three months in early 2014. Through the efforts of Aharon Tamir, International March of the Living Vice Chair, the exhibit was further modified, and translated into Hebrew and Polish, and shown at the Auschwitz- Birkenau Memorial and Museum, in the city centre of O≈õwiƒôcim. It is scheduled to appear at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in early 2017. It was also on display at the Schwartz-Reisman Centre in Toronto in early 2016. March of the Living Digital Archive Project In 2013, together with filmmaker Naomi Wise, and community leader Evan Zelikovitz, Rubenstein established the March of the Living Digital Archive Project. The archive aims to gather Holocaust testimony from Canadian survivors who have participated in the March of the Living in very places their stories transpired. In addition to gathering thousands of hours of Canadian Holocaust survivor testimony that currently exists, the project sends teams of videographers to Poland on ongoing March of the Living trips to capture the stories of the survivors as they share them with the students. Films from the March of the Living Digital Archive Project have been shown in Canada and around the world, including the United Nations, the Canadian Parliament, CBC's Documentary Channel, at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw, Poland and elsewhere.

Rubenstein introduced a number of Canadian Holocaust survivors to Justice Thomas Walther (lawyer), Germany's last Nazi hunter. In 2015, with the testimony of these survivors at the trial of Oskar Gr√∂ning, a German SS member in Auschwitz, Walther successfully prosecuted Gr√∂ning. Known as the \\"book- keeper of Auschwitz\\", Gr√∂ning was convicted of being an accessory to the murder of over 300,000 Hungarian Jews, and was sentenced to four years in prison by a German court. Rubenstein also interviewed Canadian residential school survivor, Chief Rodney Monague (1943-2013) of Christian Island. St. Louis Apology On Wednesday, November 7, 2018, the Canadian government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, issued a historic apology for Canada's Holocaust era record toward Jews, including its turning away of the MS. St. Louis and its cruel None is Too Many policy. Speaking in Ottawa at a special a ceremony after the event, where the Prime Minister, several ministers and a survivor of the St. Louis spoke, Rubenstein praised the government, in his closing remarks: \\"I asked a survivor I knew from Toronto what today was like for him. He said that, ‚Äúthis was the most wonderful gesture a government could ever express‚Äù, and this was echoed by a number of other survivors I spoke to. What a mitzvah, what a good deed, was done here today by our government! Elie Wiesel, of blessed memory, once said: Many people die twice. Once when they die, and once again when they are forgotten. So thank you, dear Prime Minister, and indeed all our political leaders, for making sure that the over 250 victims of the St Louis, many who perished in Auschwitz/Birkenau, Sobibor, and other places, are never forgotten, that they don't die a second death.\\" He also commended the decision in the Canadian Jewish News, where he wrote: \\"Let us applaud our country and our elected officials for their ability to acknowledge Canada‚Äôs errors and forge a new path forward. Countries, just like people, can perform the mitzvah of teshuvah (repentance.)\\" Speaking on January 27, 2019 in Ottawa, at a Library and Archives Canada event marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day, Rubenstein said: ‚ÄúI was never more ashamed to be a Canadian, than when I first read ‚ÄúNone is Too Many‚Äù as a student attending York University in the early 1980s. But I was never prouder to be a Canadian, than when our government issued its apology for this historic wrong.‚Äù https://images.shulcloud.com/963/uploads/bulletins/January2019-bulletin.pdf Eli Rubenstein speaking at the government organized event for the MS St. Louis apology, flanked by Liberal MPs Anthony Housefather and Michael Levitt Awards 1994 Canadian Jewish Book Award 2008 Ve‚Äôahavta Tikkun Olam Education Award 2013 Miklos Kanitz Holocaust and Human Rights Education Award http://agudasisrael.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Bulletin-July- August-2013.pdf Lifetime Achievement Award On May 8, 2018, Rubenstein was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by Jewish Federations of Canada-UIA at a March of the Living Event called \\"This is Our Legacy\\", held in Toronto, Canada. The event honored Canadian Holocaust survivors for their work in educating youth on the March of the Living as well as Rubenstein for his contributions to Holocaust education in Canada over 30 years. At the event, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: \\"I want to commend the incredible leadership and dedication of Eli Rubenstein, who has led this March since its inception in 1988.

It is now equated with the formerly theorized \\"Old ≈öaka era\\". Harry Falk and others have suggested that the Yavana era actually started in 174 BCE, based on a reevaluation of the Azes era which is now thought to have started in 47/46 BCE. The exact historical event corresponding to the creation of this Yavana era is uncertain, but it may mark the alliance of Antimachos I and Apollodotus I in toppling Agathokles, thereby creating a unified realm north and south of the Hindu-Kush. The creation of specific eras is a well-known phenomenon marking great dynastical events, such as the Seleucid era (starting in 312 BCE, with the return of Seleucus to Babylon), the Arsacid Era in Parthia (starting in 248/247 BCE), the Azes era in Gandhara (starting in 47/46 BCE), and the Kanishka era, when he established his empire in 127 CE. It is now thought that the Kushan king Kanishka I created his own era precisely 300 years after the Yavana era, and probably in reference to it, so that year 1 of Kanishka (127 CE) would correspond exactly to year 301 of the Yavana era. Arguably, Kanishka wished to link his own rule to the rule of the Indo-Greeks, who for the first time had united the areas of Bactria and parts of ancient India. The Yavana era progressively fell into disuse after the creation of the Kanishka era, the Kanishka era being used exclusively in inscriptions on relic caskets from the 18th year of his reign, from 145 CE. On statues of the Buddha, an inscription using the Yavana era is known from Gandhara as late as 209 CE (year 384 of the Yavana era), with the \\"Hashtnagar Buddha\\".Problems of Chronology in Gandharan Art p.37 Coins of Plato Plato.

Coin marked MZ (bottom left of reverse), which possibly is a dating which equals year 47 Yavana era = 138 BCE. Although Greco-Bactrian or Indo-Greek kings generally did not put dates on their coins, some of them Plato (circa 140 BCE) and Heliocles uncharacteristically do so. Some of the coins of Plato have inscriptions such as MZ, MT, MN which can be interpreted as dates in the Greek numerals system using the Yavana era which started around 186 BCE. In that case Plato ruled around 140 BCE. This matches the dating given by numismatician Bopearachchi, who places Plato between 145‚Äì140 BCE, since his coins are not found in the ruins of Ai Khanoum, a Bactrian city which was destroyed during the reign of Eucratides.Publication by Fran√ßois Widemann in 2004 in \\"Une confirmation numismatique de l'√®re Yavana de 186/185\\": \\"The author looks at the dated coinages of the Indo-Greek rulers Heliocles and Platon and argues that the dates are calculated according to a Yavana Era beginning in 186/5 BC.\\" in Numismatic Literature, Num√©ro 149, American Numismatic Society, 2007 Bajaur reliquary A recently discovered reliquary (published by Salomon in 2005) from Bajaur gives a triple dating which allows to clarify the relationship between several eras: it is dated to the 27th regnal year of Vijayamitra, a king of the Indo-Scythian Apraca, the 73rd years of the Azes era, and the 201st year of the Greeks (Yonanas or Ionians). :\\"In the twenty-seventh - 27 - year in the reign of Lord Vijayamitra, the King of the Apraca; in the seventy-third - 73 - year which is called \\"of Azes\\", in the two hundred and first - 201 - year of the Yonas (Greeks), on the eighth day of the month of Sravana; on this day was established [this] stupa by Rukhana, the wife of the King of Apraca, [and] by Vijayamitra, the king of Apraca, [and] by Indravarma (Indravasu?), the commander (stratega), [together] with their wives and sons.\\"\\"Afghanistan, carrefour en l'Est et l'Ouest\\" p.373. Also Senior 2003 The inscription means that the Azes era started 128 years after the beginning of the Yavana era. At the time of the discovery, the Azes era being generally dated to 57 BCE, this implied that the Yavana era started in 185 BCE. It is now thought that the Yavana era actually started in 174 BCE, based on a reevaluation of the Azes era which is now thought to have started in 47/46 BCE.

The Yavanarajya inscription was discovered in Mathura, India in 1988. The inscription, carved on a block of red sandstone, is dated to the 1st century BCE, and is currently located at the Mathura Museum in Mathura.History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.254 \\"Some Newly Discovered Inscriptions from Mathura : The Meghera Well Stone Inscription of Yavanarajya Year 160 Recently a stone inscription was acquired in the Government Museum, Mathura.\\" India's ancient past, Shankar Goyal Book Enclave, 2004, p.189 The inscription is important in that the Mathura sculptors mention the date of their dedication as \\"The last day of year 116 of Yavana hegemony (Yavanarajya)\\". It is considered that this inscription is attesting the control of the Indo-Greeks in the 2nd and 1st centuries BCE in Mathura, a fact that is also confirmed by numismatic and literary evidence.History of Early Stone Sculpture at Mathura: Ca. 150 BCE - 100 CE, Sonya Rhie Quintanilla, BRILL, 2007, p.8-10 The new dates for the Yavana era (174 BCE) would give a date of 58 BCE for the Yavanarajya inscription, as 174 minus 116 equals 58. Date referential of Buddha statues in Gandhara Several Gandhara Buddha statues with dated inscriptions, are now thought to have been dated in the Yavana Era. One of the statues of the Buddha from Loriyan Tangai has an inscription mentioning \\"the year 318\\". The era in question is not specified, but it is now thought, following the discovery of the Bajaur reliquary inscription, that it is about the Yavana era beginning in 174 BCE, and gives a date for the Buddha statue of about 143 CE.Problems of Chronology in Gandharan Art, Juhyung Rhi, pp.35-51, 2017 The inscription at the base of the statue is: This would make it one of the earliest known representations of the Buddha, after the Bimaran casket (1st century CE), and at about the same time as the Buddhist coins of Kanishka. The two devotees on the right side of the pedestal are in Indo- Scythian suit (loose trousers, tunic, and hood).Greco-Buddhist Art of Gandhara p.491 Their characteristic trousers appear clearly on close-up pictures. The statue is now in Indian Museum of Calcutta. Another statue of Buddha, the Buddha of Hashtnagar, is inscribed from the year 384, which is thought to be 209 CE.

Daugavpils (, Dzvinsk) and the territory of southern Latgalia were declared part of the Belarusian Democratic Republic in 1918 and the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belarus in 1919 but were then transferred by the bolsheviks to the independent Latvia.

Yuyuen (); was a wooden steam powered frigate built for the Imperial Chinese Navy. She was one of two ships of the , which consisted of her and her sister . They were the largest vessels built in China until the 1930s; they each ran over budget and used sub-standard building materials which limited their use. She was active in the defence of Nanking during the Sino-French War, and formed part of a squadron which was sent to relieve the blockade of Formosa. Yuyuen was sunk in Shipu Bay during the Battle of Shipu on 15 February 1885. Design Yuyuen was a wooden steam powered frigate. She was constructed at the dockyard at the Kiangnan Arsenal for the Imperial Chinese Navy's Nanyang Fleet. Yuyuen and her sister ship were the largest vessels built in China until the cruiser in 1931. Yuyuen displaced and measured long overall, with a beam of and an average draft of . The propulsion system consisted of a reciprocating engine with a single shaft, enabling a cruising speed of . She was also equipped with a sailing rig across her three masts. She had a crew complement of 372. Her armament initially consisted of two muzzle-loading rifles (MLRs) mounted on the upper deck and 24 70-pounder Whitworth naval guns, the latter mounted in broadsides. During a later overhaul these were subsequently replaced with Krupp guns of varying sizes, with two guns placed on the upper deck, and the broadside replaced with four and 20 guns. Yuyuen was built at a cost of 318,717 taels; the cost of Haian and Yuyuen exceeded the budget and resulted in their limited use initially. Furthermore, due to the use of low quality pine from Oregon and Vancouver in the construction of the vessels meant that the timbers were showing obvious signs of rot after a few months of use. Career Yuyuen was launched on 23 December 1873 from the Kiagnan Arsenal, 19 months after her sister ship. Yuyuen was not initially manned after launch to recoup some of the overspend on construction costs. She was instead used as a storeship and guard ship in the Wusong District, Shanghai. Following the attack by the French Navy at the Battle of Foochow during the Sino-French War in 1884, she formed part of a squadron whose objective was to hunt down French vessels following an anticipated attack on Nanking. Despite being out of date by that point, she was put \\"into fighting trim\\". The other vessels in the squadron consisted of the cruisers , and . But instead of attacking Nanking, the French forces targeted Formosa instead. The Nanking squadron was sent to break a blockade of the island by the French Navy, being joined by the sloop-of-war . The fleet was under the command of Admiral Wu Ang-k'ang, while Yuyuen was commanded by Captain Chin Yung-chai; of the commanding officers, only the captain of Teng Ch'ing had experience with any sea training. =Battle of Shipu= The ships left Shanghai in December 1884, making slow progress south as the crew were trained en route. They reached Wenchow (now Wenzhou) in January 1885, and began to return north briefly. They made contact with the French navy as they left Shipu Bay on 14 February. The Chinese ships moved to attack in a V-shaped formation, with the slower Yuyuen bringing up the rear. The French fleet saw the distance gathering between Yuyuen and the rest of the Chinese ships and sought to exploit this by moving in-between. Yuyuen soon lost sight of the Chinese cruisers in the poor weather, and Admiral Wu on Teng Ch'ing realised that his vessel could not keep up either. The two ships moved back into Shipu Bay, the favourable currents allowing them to stay ahead of the French ships. The duo were blockaded in by the French ships, who could not enter the bay due to their deeper drafts. During the following night, two attempts were made to sink the ships using French steam powered cutters. An initial attack at around 10:00 pm on 14 February was repulsed by fire from the Chinese ships, but a second attempt at 4:00 am on 15 February by cutters from the battleship were successful after lying hidden among the various fishing vessels of various sizes within the bay. The cutters closed so near to Yuyuen that the chief engineer was able to reach over the side and hit a French sailor with his gun sponge. Small arms fire was exchanged between the crew. Of the three cutters, one successfully detonated a spar torpedo under Yuyuen, destroying the cutter in the process. Teng Ch'ing was also sunk, but the French forces claimed that it was not as a result of their attack. American adviser L. C. Arlington was stationed on Yuyuen at the time, and later reported the chaotic scene as the ship was attacked. Some of the crew jumped over the side, while others tried to lower boats. At no point had there been any attempt by the Chinese to fend off the French cutters, with the shore batteries only firing after the attack on Yuyuen. One of the shells fired by the batteries hit Teng Ch'ing, potentially causing her sinking. The two cutters retreated, relatively undamaged. This was the final time during the war that Chinese vessels were sunk, and Yuyuen was the largest vessel sunk during the conflict. Crew from the tugboat Fubleo arrived at Shipu on 18 February, and later gave a report to the China Daily. Yuyuens hull had sunk below the water and was sitting upright with her sails still flying. Local villagers had already begun looting the vessel, having cut away topsail from the mizzen-mast and were in the process of removing the spinnaker and retrieving one of the ship's hatches. When the Fubleo crew arrived in the village, they found the surviving crew of Yuyuen and Ten Ch'ing. They reported that the villages had attempted to prevent them from coming ashore, but they had been convinced through force of arms. The family of Captain Chin were subsequently arrested, with Chinese authorities demanding that the ships were not sunk under fire from the French, but instead by having holes drilled in the bottom of the hulls so that the crew could have an excuse for abandoning the ships. Unsuccessful attempts were later made to raise the Yuyuen.

In 1820 he entered the dissenting theological academy Manchester College, which was then at York, and which eventually became Harris Manchester College, Oxford. He was ordained in 1825 as the minister of the Octagon Chapel, Norwich. In 1828 he moved to the York Street chapel (now Browning Hall) in Walworth, south London. In 1833 the congregation moved to a new chapel in Little Portland Street, off Regent Street. Tagart worked there for a quarter of a century. In 1844 the congregation gave him a set of plate with an inscription by Charles Dickens, who at that time attended his services. Tagart was foreign secretary, then general secretary 1842‚Äì58, of the British and Foreign Unitarian Association.

It has an element of surprise as the move sequences are nonstandard and not found in professional play. Ureshino can be played against both Static Rook and Ranging Rook opponents. The opening is named after amateur player Hiroaki Ureshino (Â¨âÈáéÂÆèÊòé) who invented it. The opening aims for a very fast attack with the tradeoff being a less secure king. Initial moves 1\\\\. S-68. The opening move of Ureshino. This is the surprise move as almost all shogi games start with P-76, P-26, or P-56 as the first move. (See: Shogi opening sequences ¬ß First move.) 1...P-34. For White's next move, it is most likely that they will open their bishop's diagonal by advancing their third file pawn. This move prevents Black from opening their bishop diagonal (2. P-76) as their right silver is no longer positioned to defend their bishop on 88. That is, if 1. S-68 P-34, 2. P-76?, then 2...Bx88+! It is also possible for White to push their rook pawn (1...P-84) instead of opening the bishop diagonal. In this case, Black may subsequently attempt a Double Fortress opening by opening their bishop diagonal (2. P-76). (Alternately, Bishop Exchange or Snowroof openings could be used with this sequence.) Then, this move sequence is just a transposition of the usual 1. P-76 P-84, 2. S-68 order. Attempting to use a Ureshino formation after 1...P-84 is slow and not recommended by Amano (2015). 2\\\\. B-79. Since their bishop is now confined behind Black's camp (due to the pressure from White's bishop), Black must quickly move their bishop into a position in which the bishop can be used effectively. Thus, the bishop is pulled back to the seventh file aiming at the 57 square, which Black will open in a future move. This move, however, does leave their eighth file pawn vulnerable, tempting White to start a Static Rook attack on that file, which is part of Black's plan. Against Static Rook 2...P-84. White plays Static Rook. 3\\\\. G-78. Therefore, Black must protect their eighth file pawn with their left gold. Note that Black's 3. G-78 could logically be transposed with 2. B-79 to result in the same position (that is, 1. S-68 P-34, 2. G-78 P-84, 3. B-79). However, at the moment of 2. G-78, White has not given any indication that they will play a Static Rook position (there was no 2...P-84 yet). Therefore, it is more prudent to wait to play G-78 after seeing White's strategy as it may be more beneficial for Black to develop their pieces toward the center or right side if White chooses a Ranging Rook strategy. 3...P-85. White continues with their rook pawn aiming to trade the pawns to get a pawn in hand and fully activating their rook. 4\\\\. S-48. Right silver advances. Although Black needs to push their central pawn (P-56) to activate their bishop, it cannot be done at this time since after the pawn exchange on the eighth file White's rook will be positioned on rank 6 forking Black's left knight and central pawn on 56. After protecting their knight with a pawn drop, White will capture Black's central pawn: 3...P-85, 4. P-56? P-86, 5. Px86 Rx86, 6. P*88 Rx56! However, in the variation where White trades off their rook pawn but keeps their rook on 86, Black's fifth file will be sacrificed anyway. The point here is to delay this possibility to encourage White to pull their rook back off the rank 6 so that Black can keep their fifth pawn on 56. After 4. S-48, White has two major options: either (i) to immediately make a pawn exchange on the eighth file to get a pawn in hand or (ii) to delay making this exchange for faster development. Both options can be used with a Climbing Silver attack, which will be tempting for White since Black has only the most minimal of defenses on their left side (only a gold on 78 missing a bishop on 88 and an uncastled king). The advantage of second option is that developing a Climbing Silver attack without the initial pawn exchange results in a faster attack since the pawn exchange requires loss of tempo. Thus, it forces Black to use a different Ureshino line for defense. Therefore, the Ureshino player prefers the first case when White makes the early rook pawn exchange. =White's early rook pawn exchange= 4...P-86, 5. Px86 Rx86. It is common for White to initiate the pawn exchange on their rook's file when possible. And so, when faced with the Ureshino opening, White may often choose to do so. Note that although White does get a pawn in hand, they will lose a tempo in order to do so. (See: Piece exchange and tempo loss.) Due to this tempo loss, if Black is strictly playing the Ureshino strategy, White can attack with Climbing Silver faster if White does not make this rook pawn exchange first. Thus, White's early pawn exchange is to the Ureshino player's advantage. 6\\\\. P*88. Black protects their knight from White's rook with a pawn drop. The pawn is dropped on the rank 8 instead of the rank 7 since this leads to the 87 square being defended by two pieces (the pawn and the gold). If Black dropped the pawn to 87, then only the gold would defend 87 allowing White to break into the eighth file with a Climbing Silver strategy where White's right silver advances to the 87 square. At this point, White has the option of the pulling their rook back immediately in preparation for their Climbing Silver, which needs to have the attacking silver be supported by the rook from below (see ¬ß6...R-82 below). But, White also has another option of simply developing other pieces for defense as their rook can remain on the 86 square since it is not under attack (see ¬ß6...S-42 further below). 6...R-82 6...R-82. White retreats their rook back to its start position preparing for a Primitive Climbing Silver attack. This choice by White allows Black to keep their fifth file pawn, which otherwise must be sacrificed if White keeps their rook on 86. 7\\\\. P-26. Black pushes their rook pawn up the second file. After this White may choose to immediate develop a Climbing Silver attack. However, another option is develop a defense first, such as constructing a Fortress castle. =White's Climbing Silver= 7...S-72. White aims for a Primitive Climbing Silver attack on the eighth file eschewing defense development. 8\\\\. P-25. Black continues their Diagonal Climbing Silver development. 8...B-33. White must defend the 24 square to prevent Black from trading the second file pawns. 9\\\\. P-56. Black advances their central pawn giving an opening to the left silver which can pass through the line of pawns and clearing a path to free their bishop. 11\\\\. S-66. Since White's Primitive Climbing Silver is a severe threat, Black must move their left silver leftward to defend against the attack after seeing White's 10...S-74. 11...S-85. White moves their silver to the middle rank aiming for the 86 square in order to support a pawn drop on 87. 12\\\\. S-65. Black starts their defense by moving the silver up the 65 square. The aim to position the silver on 76 so that the silver will defend the 87 square preventing White's silver from breaking through Black's camp. White's Fortress  7...S-42. Instead of immediately going into a Climbing Silver attack, White may choose to build a Fortress defense starting with developing their left silver in order to Black's next rook pawn push with S-33. 6...S-42 6...S-42. Instead of pulling their rook back to 82 after the eighth file pawn exchange, White can choose to keep their rook stationed on 86 while other pieces are developed. A logical choice is S-42, which will be part of an incomplete Snowroof castle with their left gold on 32 and the bishop on 33. (Another possibility would be a Fortress castle with the silver eventually on 33, the gold on 32, and the bishop remaining on 22 where it can be pulled back to 31.) One reason for White to keep their 86 instead of pulling it back is that the Ureshino opening requires P-56 and so if White's rook remains on 86 there will eventually be a timing where Black is forced to move the fifth pawn up to rank 6 where it is undefended so that White can capture this fifth file pawn. The tradeoff with getting a pawn 'for free' is that White have the typical tempo loss associated with taking a side pawn gambit: it requires an extra tempo to move the rook back to the eighth file (cf. the Side Pawn Capture opening). =White's delayed rook pawn exchange= 4...S-72. Aiming for a faster Climbing Silver, White moves their right attacking silver first without making a rook pawn exchange first. Against Ranging Rook The Ureshino opening can also be played against the various Ranging Rook positions. =Fourth File Rook= =Central Rook= 2...P-54, 3. P-56. Unlike the Ureshino formation used against a Static Rook opponent, Ureshino against a Central Rook opponent does not need to move the left gold early to 78 since Central Rook will not attack along the eighth file. Instead, when White advances their central pawn, the Ureshino player must respond immediately with their own central pawn push in order to prevent White from pushing their central pawn further to the 55 square. If White's pawn is positioned at this vanguard position on the middle rank, it will create problems using Black's bishop through the 57 square since it can become easy for White to position their central pawn even further on 56 preventing Black's bishop from being positioned on 57. Thus, after seeing White's P-54, Black should advance P-56 instead of S-48 or G-78. 3...R-52. White plays Central Rook. 4\\\\. S-57 S-42, 5. S-48. 5...K-62. As is typical of Ranging Rook, White starts castling their king after moving the rook. 6\\\\. P-26 K-72, 7. P-25. Black advances their rook pawn while White castles their king toward the eighth file. Again, there is no need for Black to move their left to 78 since there is no Static Rook threat from their opponent. 7...B-33. White prevents Black from trading pawns on the second file. 8\\\\. S-46. Black quickly develops their left silver to fourth file. This is the initial positioning of Diagonal Climbing Silver. The idea with Ureshino is to start the attack early before White has castled their king into a Mino castle, which will be harder to attack. Thus, Black's king is not moved leftward in an attempt to make a sort of castling move. 8...P-44. White pushes their fourth file pawn in order to give their left silver a position on 43 so that the 34 pawn at the head of their bishop will be defended. Additionally, with the pawn on rank 4, it is in position to attack the silver with another push. 9\\\\. P-36. Black pushes the third file pawn in preparation for Diagonal Climbing Silver. 9...S-43. White advances their silver to protect the head of their bishop. 10\\\\. P-35. Black immediately starts their Diagonal Climbing Silver by attacking the third file. In contrast to the traditional use of a Static Rook Boat castle against Third File Rook, Black does not fear White's pawn push on the fourth file (P-45) to attack their silver on 46 since in the Ureshino opening Black's bishop diagonal is not open and White cannot trade the bishops off the board for a counterattack to their advantage. One of the aims of the Ureshino opening is to bypass the complexities of this bishop exchange and to render P-45 an impotent attack against Black's attacking silver. Black can expect two responses to the P-35 attack. The simplest response is for White to capture the pawn with 10...Px35. The other response is the counterattacking fourth file pawn push 10...P-45. Both are addressed in separate sections below. 10...P-45 10...P-45. The counterattacking fourth file pawn push is more characteristic of Ranging Rook compared with the simple 10...Px35 pawn capture. (See the ¬ß10...Px35 section below). 11\\\\. Px34. Continuing the attack on the third file is the stronger option for Ureshino. Capturing the fourth file pawn with 11. Sx45 instead is a weaker attack since the line will continue with 11...Px35, 12. Bx35 P-55. And if, Black follows with 13. Px55, 13...Rx55 forks Black's king and silver, which would be disastrous for the Ureshino player. 10...Px35 10...Px35. White's third file pawn capture response to Black's attack. (The other response being P-45.) 11\\\\. P-24. The correct response for Ureshino is to continue the attack on the second file with P-24. Taking White's third file pawn with 11. Sx35 first is a mistake since this gives White time to attack the silver by dropping 11...P*34. And if Black continues with 12. P-24, White will capture the silver with 12...Px35 (and will not defend with 12...Px24). After 13. Px23+ B-42, 14. +P-12 N-33, 15. R-21+ G41-51, 16. +Rx11 P-55, 17. Px55 Rx55, 18. K-68 P-36, 19. P*26 N-45, 20. K-78 P-37+, 21. Nx37 Nx37+, 22. Sx37 N*57, 23. Bx57 Rx57+, 24. L*58 +Rx47, Black will be at an obvious disadvantage. 14\\\\. P*37. This pawn drop is forced to prevent White's bishop from capturing Black's rook. If Black blocks with their silver (14. S-37), White will simply attack the silver with pawn drops and pushes in order to capture it: 14...P*36, 15. S-46 P-45. =Opposing Rook= New Ureshino There is an updated variation known as the New Ureshino (Êñ∞Â¨âÈáéÊµÅ), which has a different set of initial moves.

His work over a period of fifty years evolved from large- scale Brutalist projects to small-scale made-to-measure designs. He was a vice-president for education at the Royal Institute of British Architects.  Biography  Peter Melvin was born in Harrow in the London Borough of Harrow, the only child of Thomas and Elsie Melvin. He attended St Marylebone Grammar School in the City of Westminster and studied architecture part-time at the Regent Street Polytechnic (now University of Westminster). Peter wanted to become an architect from the age of 11. During his studies he played jazz piano in the evenings to earn his keep. After finishing his studies he worked at Frederick Gibberd's office in London. Strand In the early 1960s Melvin was a partner with Arthur Swift & Partners, a London-based firm with offices in Glasgow and Dublin.Arthur Swift & Partners in DSA Architect Biography Report One of the buildings he worked on during this period was St Andrew House in Glasgow (1961‚Äì64), designed as a Brutalist office tower, now a refurbished, Modernist hotel. Another building from this period is the large office block on London's Strand / Arundel Street, for which Melvin as chief architect conducted negotiations with a shopkeeper that refused to move - a story that made it to the papers.\\"Old London Has Zoning Problems\\", in St. Petersburg Times, 15 September 1963. In 1960 he married Muriel Faure, also an architect, who trained at Kingston Art College. The couple had three children. In 1964 Melvin set up private practice supported by his wife Muriel. A year later he left Arthur Swift & Partners. Melvin was joined shortly after by one of his contemporaries from the Regent Street Polytechnic, Clifford Lansley, forming the company Melvin & Lansley. They designed housing estates in Hertfordshire for the local authority and went on to design civic centres, shopping blocks, schools, churches and private homes. Percy Mark, whom they knew from the poly joined them as a partner some years later and the firm changed its name to Melvin Lansley and Mark (in 1994 Atelier MLM). Melvin had two spells as vice-president for education at the Royal Institute of British Architects, the first in the 1970s when he traveled to Egypt and Russia to inspect schools of architecture for RIBA accreditation, and again in the 1980s and 1990s when he traveled to South Africa and South America. His book Architecture in South Africa since 1945 remained unfinished at his death at 76.A chapter from the book on Jack Judah Barnett was published here. Peter Melvin died in his home in Berkhamsted in 2009, one year after his wife Muriel. The architectural firm continues as Atelier Architecture + Design, directed by Stephen Melvin, Peter and Muriel's youngest son.

Infrastructure Siam Park City (; ) is an amusement and water park in the Khan Na Yao district of Bangkok, Thailand. It opened in November 1980. For the transport of visitors a miniature railway in the way of a light railway was installed. The line was built in a broad circuit around the area. Due to old maps, an old photograph and some still existing tracks (as seen in September 2016), it is certain that the railroad line left the inner terrain of the park at least in the southbound section behind and circled the waterpark installations. In a northward direction the still existing tracks end nowadays in front of the Dinotopia attraction. The line was a single-way track with, had a gauge of 2 ft, several sidings and served some stop stations. The storage sidings for the units, hauled by a diesel locomotive, were behind the present-day attraction Log Flume. Rolling stock In 1966 four identical locomotives of type DS40/1 were delivered from the German Diepholzer Maschinenfabrik Fritz Sch√∂ttler (Diema) with the serial numbers from 2886 to 2889 to Union Development Co. Ltd., Bangkok. Overall Diema built 25 locomotives of this type. These four engines were overtaken by the park railway, numbered as 1 to 4 - not following the order of the serial numbers. After its closure they were still dumped until today at the former, roofed storage sidings. Diema delivered a total of just six locomotives to Thailand, all of them are preserved so far, besides this four mentioned engines two other locomotives still exist at a sugar factory in Ko Kha as a monument.

She aided African Americans across the New Orleans area alongside her sister, Oretha Castle Haley. Castle was one of the youngest Freedom Riders in New Orleans. She was only seventeen years old when she started fighting for civil rights activism.  Biography  Doris Castle was born on May 25, 1942 in Oakland, Tennessee. Both branches of her ancestors were farmers; one were landowners and the others were sharecroppers. Castle recalled her grandmother saying things such as \\"Don't ever bow to anybody when you feel you're right or you know you're right\\". Her family moved to New Orleans, Louisiana in 1947. Her father, John Castle, was a longshoreman while her mother, Virgie Castle was a barmaid for Leah and Dooky Chase restaurants. Her parents taught her and her sister to be ‚Äúfiercely independent‚Äù. Doris and her sister Oretha grew up with working parents who believed you had to fight for what you wanted in life. They attended public schools in the Ninth Ward neighborhood of New Orleans, where the two girls grew up. Castle graduated from Joseph S. Clark High School. Some years later, she went to Southern University at New Orleans but was never able to finish her degree. She followed in her sister's footsteps by joining CORE and helping in civil rights organizations throughout the city. Castle and Oretha were part of the third generation of New Orleans activist leaders. Castle saw herself as her sister's enabler by being more of a worker in the New Orleans black community than a leader. She and her sister helped to desegregate New Orleans public service buses, worked for voter registration and joined boycotts around the city to push for equal employment among blacks. During one protest against segregation of the New Orleans City Hall cafeteria, police removed Castle, still seated in a cafeteria chair, from the building. Castle was one of three plaintiffs in a successful lawsuit to desegregate the City Hall cafeteria. Many Louisiana women activists for the civil rights movement were not given much recognition for their actions. However, throughout the 1960s and the 1970s Castle went to work as a fundraiser for George Wiley's National Welfare Rights Organization, after which she worked for various service agencies in New Orleans, including under Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty Initiative, the Urban League, and Odyssey House. In an interview with Shannon Frystak, Castle said, \\"If I had not been a part of the civil rights movement, I probably would have finished college, married a young man, had three or four kids, a very comfortable home, probably work- and career- orientated in some shape, form, or fashion and took part in most of the things that acceptable Americans take part in: go to church on Sunday, work Monday through Friday, picnic on Saturday... I don't know that I would have been as valuable to myself as I feel that I am because of what I did experience in the civil rights movement\\" (Frystak 107). Castle was married and divorced twice, to former city councilman Johnny Jackson Jr. and Allen Scott. She had no children. In the fall of 1987 her sister, Oretha Castle Haley, died of ovarian cancer. Mourning, Castle excluded herself from political involvement in the community. In 1989 she took her sister's place as the night admissions supervisor at Charity Hospital in New Orleans. Ten years later, Doris Castle died on April 16, 1998 from cancer. = CORE = The Congress of Racial Equality is an African American civil rights organization that aided African Americans during the civil rights movement. This organization staged sit-ins and desegregation attempts at local cafeterias, theaters and restaurants. CORE also helped to validate the actions of women leaders at the time by calling them into action in rural Louisiana. 1961 arrest photo of New Orleans CORE member Doris Jean Castle as Freedom Rider After Castle graduated high school her parents gave her a trip to Chicago as a graduation present. There she learned her sister had been arrested back in New Orleans for carrying a picket sign, after which she helped start the first New Orleans chapter of CORE. Castle participated in local and national sit-ins as well as helping raise funds for the national organization. Many women in the CORE organization, including Castle, were physically and sexually harassed by white men in sit-ins, picket fence lines and jail cells. These women fought harder to achieve racial justice. The Castle family was very involved in the CORE in New Orleans; their Treme- Laffite house was used as a meeting place to discuss strategies and house other local activists. Their house became known as \\"the Freedom House\\". The New Orleans chapter experienced a rough patch between 1960 and 1961 when many of their members returned to school or worked on other War on Poverty organizations.  Freedom Riders  Freedom Riders were civil rights activists who rode interstate buses into the South protesting segregation. Doris rode the Freedom Riders bus from Montgomery, Alabama to Jackson, Mississippi on May 24, 1961 and was arrested the next day because of her involvement. She spent her nineteenth birthday in Parchman Penitentiary. In an interview with Kim Lacy Rogers, Castle talked about the night before they rode the freedom bus. \\"I know we were all afraid that night we got on the train at Union Station and left here and went to Montgomery\\" (Rogers 129).Righteous Lives by Kim Lacy RogersOur Minds on Freedom by Shannon Frystak References 1942 births 1998 deaths Freedom Riders People from New Orleans American civil rights activists 7\\\\.

Hi-Fi, September 2015 Technologies brought to the market by Monitor Audio include: *C-CAM Drivers: Conventional speaker cones are liable to flex in operation, which can result in a significant level of audible distortion. Using a material originally developed by the aerospace industry, Monitor Audio created loudspeaker cones, which have a high resistance to bending stress, resulting in a smooth transition of audio frequencies.\\"Monitor Audio‚Äôs new Bronze speaker range uses the new generation of C-CAM drivers\\". The Audiophile Man, July 2015 *Damped Concentric Mode (DCM): Finite Element Analysis has been used to optimise the geometry where the driver cone and surround overlap with the intention of decreasing the amplitude and decay of the first concentric mode of the diaphragm, producing a more accurate time response from the speaker. *DCF (Dynamic Coupling Filter): DCF replaces the customary rigid coupling of a driver and voice coil with a pliable unit. In doing so, DCF helps to dampen surplus energy produced by the driver, resulting in a more natural sound.\\"New patented 'DCF' mechanism\\". HomeTheaterReview, December 2015 *Gold Dome C-CAM: First introduced in the latter half of the 1980s, the Gold Dome Tweeter is built on its maker's 1985 metal dome tweeter technology. Monitor Audio anodises its ceramic-coated aluminium/magnesium alloy, creating a thinner, lighter more rigid dome, one which is extremely efficient and less prone to audio distortion.\\"Monitor Audio debuts All-Weather AWC architectural speakers\\". Inside CI, July 2016 *Hive II Port: This proprietary speaker port technology accelerates airflow and reduces turbulence, resulting in fast, powerful bass coupled with a superior transient response. *IDC: The Inverted Dual Concentric midrange/tweeter module offers up to 18 degrees of play, enabling in-ceiling and in-wall speakers to be discreetly positioned, yet still direct sound towards the listening zone. *MMP II: Metal Matrix Polymer driver cones have a polypropylene base loaded with metallic particles to offer a rigid and responsive structure. They are manufactured using a sophisticated high-pressure injection process, which modulates cone thickness at critical points to optimise stiffness and consistency, resulting in superior sonic performance. *MPD: Developed over many months of intensive testing and listening, the MPD High-Frequency Transducer is a landmark achievement by the engineering team for Platinum II. It represents an imaginative re-working of existing technology, transforming a successful idea into an audiophile super- driver, having greater accuracy and efficiency than ever before. Using a new, proprietary low-mass pleated diaphragm with a surface area eight times larger than that of a traditional dome tweeter, the MPD transducer works like a super-fast accordion by rapidly squeezing the pleats to produce a smooth, wide, naturally fast response up to 100 kHz. As a result, it sounds more lifelike, releasing the high harmonic spectrum of every note without the distortion that blurs definition. *RDT II: The second generation of Rigid Diaphragm Technology (RDT) bonds an ultra-thin composite structure to a honeycomb Nomex¬Æ core material. Using C-CAM for the front skin and woven carbon fibre for the rear, the RDTII structure reduces distortion by over 8 dB above 300 Hz, making RDTII the lowest distortion cone technology in Monitor Audio's history.\\"Monitor Audio Launches Platinum In-Wall II Speaker\\". CEPro Europe, April 2016 *RST: Rigid Surface Technology (RST), inspired by the Japanese art of Origami, strengthens the speaker cone, letting Monitor Audio speakers use thinner, lighted and more responsive C-CAM cones, meaning greater speed and accuracy, as well as greatly reduced distortion. *Tri-Grip Dog Fixings: All current Monitor Audio custom install models use this fixing design. This three-position ‚Äòdog‚Äô style fix enables great contact surface area over other designs, whilst also saving installation time.\\"Fits Where Rivals Fail\\".

Life Charlotte Stierneld was the daughter of count Nils Philip Gyldenstolpe and Jacquette Elisabet De Geer af Leufsta. =Court career= Charlotte Stierneld had a long career at the royal court. She and served as hovfr√∂ken (maid of honour) to Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte prior to her marriage. During her tenure as maid of honour, she belonged to the favorites of duchess Charlotte and participated in the demonstration of Jeanna von Lantingshausen against the Union and Security Act of 1789. The duchess encouraged her marriage to one of the imprisoned opposition leaders, Adolf Ludvig Stierneld, who proposed to her from prison and successfully asked her to be the king for his pardon, which both she and duchess Charlotte did repeatedly with reference to his engagement. In 1790, he was released, though not because of their pleadings: they immediately married and retired from court. She was appointed deputy royal governess to the son of Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte, duke Charles Adolf of V√§rmland, in 1798; statsfru (lady of the bedchamber) to the queen, Frederica of Baden, in 1800-02, and royal governess for the royal children in 1802 (with the title hovm√§starinna from 1807). After the coup of 1809, she was named Hovm√§starinna (deputy Mistress of the Robes) to queen Charlotte, and, finally, √∂verhovm√§starinna (Mistress of the Robes) to the queen in 1811-18. =Private life= She is known to be one of five women to have been a member of the Freemasons in Sweden during the 18th century. Alongside Sophie von Fersen, Countess Ulrica Catharina Brahe and Hedda von Fersen, she was most likely inducted as a member of a Freemasonic adoption lodge for women at court in 1776, when Princess Hedvig Elisabeth Charlotte was initiated by her consort Duke Charles as Grand Mistress of the female lodge.My Hellsing (2013).

It is a dense, greyish, multi-stemmed shrub with whorled leaves, prominent sepals and pale, pinkish-white flowers. It is common in Western Australia and the Northern Territory and there is a single record from South Australia. Description Pityrodia loricata is a dense, multi-stemmed shrub which usually grows to a height of and which has its branches and leaves densely covered with silvery, shield-shaped scales, although the scales may be difficult to see without a hand lens. The leaves are stalkless, arranged in whorls, more or less crowded near the ends of the branches, lance-shaped, long and wide. The flowers are pale whitish-pink and are usually arranged in groups of up to three on stalks long in upper leaf axils. The flowers are surrounded by linear to lance-shaped bracts and bracteoles which are long, scaly on the outside and glabrous and scale-less on the inside. The five sepals are long and joined for about half their length to form a tube with five lance-shaped lobes. The sepals are scaly on the outside of the tube and on the lobes but the inside of the sepal tube is glabrous. The five petals are long and glabrous except for a densely hairy ring around the ovary and a few long hairs on the lowest petal. The petals are joined to form a tube with five lobes in two \\"lips\\", the lower lip having three lobes. The central, lower lobe is broad elliptic to almost circular in shape, long and about wide and significantly larger than the other four which are about the same size as each other. Flowering occurs from May to November and is followed by hairy, oval-shaped fruit with the sepals still attached. Taxonomy and naming This species was first formally described in 1876 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Chloanthes loricata and published the description in Fragmenta phytographiae Australiae. In 1904 Georg Pritzel changed the name to Pityrodia loricata. The specific epithet (loricata) is a Latin word meaning \\"clad in mail\\". Distribution and habitat This pityrodia grows in red or yellow sand on sand dunes. It is found in the near Lake Carnegie, Coolgardie and Eucla districts in Western Australia, near Mount Sonder in the MacDonnell Ranges in the Northern Territory and there is a single record from Mamungari Conservation Park in South Australia. Conservation Pityrodia loricata is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

A common emotion amongst humans, grief is also apparent in other animals, known as animal grief. In the late 19th century, research started to show grief in chimpanzees and the connection between animal and human grief. However, until recently, grief has never been the focus of research. Marc Bekoff, a scientist, has spent his time researching emotions in animals, including grief. Combined with other research, the following animals have been seen to grieve: wolves, chimpanzees, magpies, elephants, dolphins, otters, geese, sea lions, and many more.  What is Animal Pain?  Bernard E. Rollin says that the ability to experience pain is something we have to feel to be considered moral (Rollin, 2010). It can result from something such as a wound or abuse causing physical pain. Animals can also experience pain mentally, such as experiencing grief as well as sadness due to anxiety. Animal pain can be understood once we understand the nature of a certain animal. For example, when somebody is caring for a dog as a pet the individual understands their actions, their traits and emotions. While taking care of an animal we are then able to understand that specific animal and their way of grieving or their happiness per se. The difference in pain from humans and animals is how one is willing to bear pain for a better lifestyle. Rollin mentions an example of extending life. This example states that the owner may think pain will be a small price to pay for the life of their pet. Since an animal cannot express their pain or how much something may hurt these emotions or decisions are hard to conclude. Pain felt can sometimes be unbearable to the point where humans have the decision or thought to choose death over the continuation of that pain.  Animal Emotions  A question that is asked is if animals have any emotions? Marc Bekoff defines emotion as something that helps behavioral control and management (Bekoff, 2000). It is known that humans have emotions and that it is something fundamental and important in our lives, however it is hard to say if that is true for animals or just some. There are different ways you can tell the emotion of animal: how they're acting or how they're looking at someone or something. = Primary Emotions and Secondary Emotions = There are different ‚Äúcategories‚Äù of emotions known as primary and secondary emotions. Bekoff explains that primary emotions are similar to reflex or something along the lines of fear or fight-or-flight response. Therefore, it is something that animals react to such as loud noises, unknown objects, or odors (Bekoff, 2000). Having primary emotions is crucial because reactions to these are important for an animal's survival. The part of the brain that is responsible for primary emotions is the limbic system (Bekoff, 2000). Secondary emotions are part of an experience. These emotions are taking part in the central cortex of the brain because of the requirement of different and higher brain centers. With secondary emotions it allows one (in this case the animals that do feel grief) to create the connection between feelings and actions. Early Research on Animal Grief In 1879, Arthur E. Brown studied how a male chimpanzee reacted after the death of his female counterpart. He saw the male chimpanzee display grief and \\"a cry which the keeper of the animals assures [Brown] he had never heard before\\"). Continuing to the next day, the chimpanzee sulked and barely moved. Brown deciphered that the male chimpanzee was depressed after the female chimpanzee died. However, Brown concluded that any permanent grief is only found in man, as the chimpanzee seemed fine after a couple of days. William E. Ritter (1925) connects animal and human emotion to provide evidence of human descent from the animal kingdom. He mentions the James-Lange theory, where \\"all emotional stages as of joy, grief, fear, anger, jealousy, love, are associated with more or less characteristic bodily manifestation\\". Ritter proposes new evidence to the theory, mentioning that no item on the above list is exclusive to humans, and most are common to the animal world. He argues that because the connection between human emotion and animal emotion is so strong, humans have descended from the animal kingdom. Marc Bekoff's Recent Research on Animal Grief Marc Bekoff is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Colorado-Boulder. He has spent his life studying animals and their emotions, finding that animals grieve quite frequently. Such examples of grieving animals are: *Bekoff found that sea lion mothers squeal eerily when they watch their babies being eaten by killer whales. *Even after their calves have died, dolphin mothers have been seen to save them and grieve when they confirm the death. *Elephants have been \\"observed to stand guard over a stillborn baby for days with their head and ears hanging down\\". Orphan elephants, who have watched their mothers be killed, have been shown to wake up screaming. Elephants are known to communally recognize a deceased relative similar to how they greet a newborn, by collectively touching it's corpse or old bones and possibly wailing. * A wolf \\"sniffed [her dead companion], then sat back and gave the most soulful and heart-wrenching howl I've ever heard!\\"; After a pack member died, the wolves let their tails and heads hang low while walking slowly. * Chimpanzee orphans can die while in the state of grieving. Jane Goodall (1990) followed Flint, a chimpanzee, for a few days after the death of Flint's friend Flo. She noted that Flint \\"walked along one of the branches, then stopped and stood motionless, staring down at an empty nest\\". Flint had been lethargic, even refusing food. Per Goodall, Flint was \\"hollow- eyed, gaunt and utterly depressed\\". *Magpies have been seen to mourn over their dead. *After a fellow goose died, Konrad Lorenz noted that other geese had their \\"eyes sink deep into their sockets, and the individual ha[d] an overall drooping experience, literally letting the head hang\\". The previous example shows that animals can express their grief and it is possible for an individual to identify that. Bekoff mentions an experience of a bird that lost its partner. It showed many signs of depression before it ended up passing away in a vegetative state similar to the one his partner ended up dying in (Bekoff, 2010). Many animals can show grief when they have lost a loved one of their own.  How Long Do Animals Feel Grief?  One of the questions that can be asked aside from do animals grieve is how long do they grieve for or if these animals show signs of mourning. Anthropologist Barbra J King mentions how animals might sleep less or change their ways in their daily life styles. These animals might also end up staying close to their companion's corpse for a long time as well (Safina, 2015). Something we know is that emotions in a human can change, one day they can be sad and the other happy. Actions are taken days after one of our loved ones dies, such as time off school, work or any social interaction (Safina, 2015). It is actually the same for animals. An example that can be shown is in chimpanzees. A case is shown with one named Amos. The day before he died he spent the day in his nest and did not move until a female chimpanzee Daisy went up to him (Safina, 2015). When Amos died, one of the chimpanzees who was more sociable than the rest as well as a ‚Äúhigher rank‚Äù than the rest did not want to be with the group for weeks. As shown here it also depends on who passed away on how long an animal can grieve. Though through the time spent mourning many signs can appear of an animals grief and agony of the loss of their companion. Another example mentioned is the dog Hachiko from Tokyo. In this case the dog was not grieving due to the death of an animal, but of the loss of its owner. It is known that this dog went to the station where his owner would come home to every day for around ten years. Other Research on Animal Grief Though Bekoff is the face of recent research on animal grief the field is slowly developing. Some studies have looked into depression in animals, with Paul Willner finding that there are eighteen animal models of depression. Peter J. Fashing & Nga Nguyen (2012) found that a group of chimpanzees groomed and caressed a grieving, older chimpanzee. They also found that \\"the dying female [elephant] was approached by the matriarch of another group who repeatedly attempted to bring her to her feet using her tusks\\". Even otters grieve, where members of a group caught fish for months and brought them to the matriarch who had failing vision and poor mobility.  Animal Mourning  In social groups, bereavement is a natural stress reaction in the event of the loss of a significant loved one through death. Like Humans, social animal species are affected by the loss of one of their own and can undergo psychological stress or trauma. The behaviour that these social groups expect following bereavement is referred to as mourning: the act of sorrowing during a period of time during which signs of grief are shown. Ample research in fields of biology, animal behaviour, evolutionary and ecological biology, cognitive ethology, and neuroscience has shown that animals have brains and minds, used, like in Humans, for thinking and feeling. As such they show moods and emotions and therefore grief and empathy. However, our understanding of the putative emotional responses to loss of animals is limited by communication capabilities and possible differences between our psychological responses to death and theirs. Thanatology used to refer to the \\"academic and often scientific study of death in human beings\\". It has now been broaden to include the study of the mechanism, body changes, but also the psychological and social consequences of death among other species. = Social emotions shared in mammals = Primitive tendencies to nurturance probably evolved before the divergence of mammalian and avian stock from their common ancestor. For instance, recent paleontological evidence suggests that some dinosaurs may have also exhibited maternal care. However maternal devotion, and complex social feelings in mammals are sure to have emerged with the evolution of the limbic system. One of the greatest advances in the evolution of emotionality was the ability of the young to value social support. Jaak Panksepp says that this is achieved by a separation-distress or PANIC system, which is a sensitive emotional barometer that keeps track of the level of social support they are receiving. When social contact is lost, organisms experience the painful feeling of separation, and the young reacts vigorously in an attempt to reestablish contact and care. Scientists documenting social animals nurturant behaviour towards dead young explain it by the species gregarious nature. These species strongly rely on cooperation and social bonding, including allomothering, explaining such actions as adults taking care of other parent's calves and even adoption. Human infants are born with brains that are about 23 percent of their final capacity, characteristic that neuroanatomists explain by the yet need to learn. This case is similar in some species, such as in elephants or odontocetes, and these exhibit long periods of infant dependency and thus substantial nurturant behaviours in mothers. Fred B. Bercovitch states that among female mammals, lifetime reproductive success depends upon rearing, more than on production of offsprings, which is associated with the strong maternal-infant bond. He then proposes that oxytocin's role in this mother- infant bond might have evolved to be implicated in promotion of social bonds as well. This intricate connection between physiology and behaviour may allow the rationale for the care and carrying of deceased newborns found behaviour, in group-living species. = Mourning animals =  Elephants  Elephants are a highly cognitively and emotionally engaged animal. ‚ÄúThrough observational evidence they seem to have a real unusual interest in the dead of their own species either fresh carcasses or skulls. [...] and the interest seems to persist long after death‚Äù - says Karen McComb, co-director of the Mammal Vocal Communication and Cognition Research Group at the University of Sussex. She is a behavioural ecologist and an expert in analyzing vocalizations of mammals to assessing thoughts and emotions. For that, McComb studies 'contact calls', powerful rumbles elephant use to keep in contact for large distances, and plays recordings of these to approaching herds of elephants while observing their reaction to them. These are her clues in her study. When played the call of a missing family member, the elephants were seen running trumpeting towards the speaker, as if they had someone in ‚Äòmind‚Äô they expected to see. She also used the call of a fifteen-year-old female elephant who had died, and played it twice to her family, once a few months after her death and then twenty-three month later. Similarly, the herd ran to her rumbling in greeting, walking directly to the speaker. ‚ÄúThey hadn't forgotten her. [...] But I was uneasy doing that test.‚Äù - she mentions. Elephants have intensive social natures and retain their memories for many years. They have the adequate neural anatomy for long-term memory: their brains have large and complex frontal lobes, important structures for storing and retrieving memories of scent, touch, smell, and sound. Poachers often target the matriarchs or older females of the group because they have larger tusks. This is an impactful loss for the group because they loose a lifetime of learning and knowledge. Elephants have a concept of death. For instance, they recognize carcasses and skeletons of their own kind as well as of others. McComb performed experiments in which she placed skulls of elephants killed by poacher, to make miniature elephant graveyards, in the path of approaching herds. She observed that they took a real interest in skulls and bones of their own kind, touching and investigating the body for hours. The behaviour they adopt when encountering their dead relatives varies, says Cynthia Moss, ethologist and director of the Amboseli Elephant Research Project, and who invited McCom to join her team. ‚ÄúThey stop and become quiet and tense in a different way from anything I have seen in other situations‚Äù. Responses of elephants to conspecific carcasses at various stages post-mortem has been intensively documented. They display touching behaviours such as smelling and caressing the remaining body with their hind feet or with their trunk. Initially, the dead might be treated as if it was still alive, or unable to move as if injured. It gets carried in order to keep up with the group, tried to be lift up and help stand. Such actions reveal the elephant's empathetic and compassionate nature and shows that they do not want to abandon the deceased individual. They often cover bodies with dirt and sticks, as a burial. Out of many others, Sharma described a case of an adult female mother in southern India, standing around her dead calf for weeks. The mother later watched from a distance a veterinary team conducting an autopsy on-site and remained around 100m away from the fire on which the calf's body was cremated. There are tales about elephant's graveyards. These are believed to be places where dying elephants direct themselves to die with their conspecifics. Today it is believed that these are actually the remainder bones and skeletons of elephants killed by poachers. However, some reports allow the hypothesis that elephants, which are always on the move, may return occasionally to places where a member has been buried.  Cetaceans  Many studies reviewed reports of whales and odontocetes, dolphins in particular, displaying nurturant behaviours towards dead calves and juveniles, either by supporting or carrying the young at the surface for very long distances and for a very long time. One example of the many cases Reggente reports in their study describes an adult Risso's dolphin interacting with a dead calf. Observers related the animal swimming holding on its back the young dead by its dorsal fin, then swimming in circles under the carcass, touching it with several parts of its body (rostrum, and pectoral and dorsal fin), and remaining in vertical position next to the dead calf. Later, the adult pushed the body away from its observers, who did not attempt to follow them. Another reports an adult Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin pushing a small dead dolphin across waters. Biologists decided to fix a rope and drag the carcass to the shore to bury it. Observers report having the adult following it, touching it and swimming around until it reached shallow waters. In one study, Kilborn (1994) reported a case in Point Defiance Zoo and Aquarium's whale exhibit, in which a captive mother beluga whale, Mauyak, gave birth to a male calf which died right after birth. After delivering the placenta a few hours later, she took it in her mouth and moved out of reach from the staff, carrying it for hours before it was removed from the pool. The day after, she was found carrying a 30-cm diameter pink buoy that had been available to her prior to the birth. Many testimonies also report seeing killer whales carrying dead calves for miles. Smith and Sleno (1986), and Kilborn (1994) allow the hypothesis that these recurrent nurturant behaviours found in the wild might be due from the incapacity of the mothers to accept their infants' death.  Non-human Primates  Specialist Jane Goodall recognizes that chimpanzees have distinct personalities that impact their success in life. As the animals discussed previously and still many others, they show sophisticated behaviours: they forge friendship, communicate, have a sense of fairness, occasionally deceive and lie, and grieve for their dead. Concerning great apes, the best known reports until today probably account Goodall's descriptions of chimpanzee mothers carrying and caring for dead infants, as well as reports from Geza Teleki on a group's response to an accidental adult chimpanzee's fatal fall from a tree. Anderson et al. report was the first to include video evidence of chimpanzees' precise moment response at the death of an elderly female of their group. They could draw parallels with behaviours seen in humans in such circumstances, such as pre-death care of the female, close inspection and testing for signs of life at the moment of death, male aggression towards the corpse, all-night attendance by the deceased's adult daughter, cleaning the corpse, and later avoidance of the place where the death occurred. In humans, expressions of sympathy and moral support may arise towards the family members in the event of a relative's death. Goldsborough observed captive chimpanzees' affiliative interactions with an adult female before and after the birth of her stillborn baby. She received more affiliation than before, including from previously non-affiliative chimpanzees, and particularly from a female who also had a stillborn infant in the years before her.  Giraffes  In Giraffes, the mother-infant bond that happens during the neonatal period lasts for a minimum of 12-16 months and there are suggestions that mother and daughters may associate for several years and more. Giraffe's calves have high mortality rate (58-73%) in the first year and literature shows mothers adopt a characteristic nurturant behaviour in the event of their calf's death. Cases have described behaviours of mothers standing guard over their newborn dead calves, while giraffes rarely remain stationary for long, or of mothers watching quietly from distance their infant carcasses being fed on by predators.  Laysan albatrosses  Laysan albatrosses are monogamous. They don't breed until they are eight or nine years old. John Klavitter is a U.S fish and Wildlife Service biologist at Midway and says that when an albatross loses one of their mate the surviving bird ‚Äúgoes through a year or two of a mourning period‚Äù before it starts searching again for a new mate, a process that can take many years.  Mute swans  Mute swans, Cygnus olor, are monogamous, and are known to go through a mourning period following the death or loss of their mate or a cygnet. Should a parent die while there are cygnets present, the remaining adult will take up its counterpart's duties in caring for the offspring. After undertaking the mourning period, the surviving swan, if it is alone, may remain in the area or depart to locate a nearby flock.  Other animals  In human management systems, such as in parks, farms and laboratory animals, animals are subject to abrupt separation from their mothers and other conspecifics. McGraph addresses the abundant scientific findings about grief and separation distress that are found in domesticated animals such as cows, pigs, sheep, goats, horses and chickens. Physiological changes resulting from it include distress vocalizations, increased activity or locomotion, escape attempts, increased heart-rate and increased hypothalamic-pituitary activity. They do not show sign of the bi-phasic protest-despair reaction typical of grief. Nonetheless, this does not mean that they are not capable of grieving as some may present other reactions. This assumption raises issues and debates about ethics and welfare of animals in situations such as with laboratory animal management. William Russel and Rex Burch published the seminal book, The Principles of Humane Experimental Techniques, and introduced the now referred \\"3Rs\\" principles: reduction, refinement and replacement of animal use. Despite the attention brought to this issue by the authors and since, the number of animals used in research and testing continues to increase drastically. Marc Bekoff is a former Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Colorado, and co-founder with Jane Goodall of Ethologists for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He supports that animals have emotions, empathy and moral intelligence, a theory that has been extensively supported by scientific proofs. In his ample work, some of his reports include cases of grieving animals. Among others: magpies standing next to a conspecific's corpse, gently pecking at it, seems to be a ritual that has been observed in ravens and crows as well; baboons; elephants .  Human grief from pet-loss  Some examples of empathy cross the species barrier. One is the famous dog-human relationship. The process of grief over the death of a pet among owners is under-explored in research and often devalued, but some studies have tackled on comprehensive analysis of grief responses in dog owners, showing that the more the owner has the tendency to humanize his animal the more intense the grief experienced will be. In consequence, the mourning behaviour will be similar to ones that he would have if he went through the loss of a human companion: burials, cremations, taxidermies. These mourning rituals similarly allow owners to recapture and re-experience intensely lived moments of comradeship and closeness with their fellow companion. When the pet may have played an additional role such as being a working dog, service or therapy animal, owners will not only grieve the loss of a companion but also the loss of a co-worker. Pet cemeteries exist. One is the Psi Los (‚ÄúDog's fate‚Äù) cemetery located in Konik Nowy, on the outskirts of the Polish capital city of Warsaw. There, the place is home to thousands of animal graves and tombstones, including numerous species: dogs, but also cats, rats, rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, mice, ferrets, chinchillas, canary birds, turtles, and at least one iguana. In social practices, significant similarities can be observed in ways to commemorate companion animals to those typically found in human cemeteries in Poland: families paying a visit, lighting candles, placing fresh or artificial flowers. Moreover, at Psi Los, the Catholic All Saint's celebration is mirrored on the same day (November 1st) by the informal Pet Memorial day. Implications of Research Though grief in animals may seem questionable, evidence shows it is abundant. From chimpanzees to otters to sea lions, animals grieve just like humans do. Researchers like Bekoff, Fashing, Nguyen, and others, are studying every day to help better understand how and why animals grieve. With increased knowledge, humans can have better relationships with animals. For example, zoo caretakers can study chimpanzee grief habits and better notice when a chimpanzee mother is mourning. The caretakers can then help the mother cope and live a healthy and successful life. Research shows grief in animals, and understanding that can help humans form closer, healthier connections with them.  References  * *Bekoff, M. (2008) [Gana holds her dead baby]. (13, May 2).

Born to count Claes Ekeblad the Younger and Eva Ekeblad, she married count Carl Gustaf Piper in 1769. The marriage was unhappy because of the homosexual love affair between her husband and his manservant Beck, \\"as she daily finds herself compromised by his manservant, has no voice to command in her own house\\"Erdmann, Nils, Vid hovet och p√• adelsgodsen i 1700-talets Sverige: en tidskr√∂nika, Wahlstr√∂ms, Stockholm, 1926 because Beck: \\"embarrass her in every way.

For her children he did anything, and as his authority was so great, he was a powerful ally to have.\\" It is noted that the famed Sophie Hagman was employed as a maid in her household prior to becoming the mistress of Prince Frederick Adolph. Hedda Piper served as statsfru (lady of the bedchamber) to the queen in 1774-80, and was appointed hovm√§starinna (deputy mistress of the robes) under Charlotta Sparre in 1780. As Sparre was normally indisposed, Piper performed the actual duties of the office for fifteen years before she formally succeeded Sparre as √∂verhovm√§starinna in 1795. Duchess Charlotte portrays her in her famous journal as quite pretty but uneducated, arrogant, unable to keep a confidence or control her temperament, and claims that she became disliked at court because of her way of handling her office during her service to Frederica of Baden, queen consort of Sweden.Cecilia af Klercker (1927).

Reportedly, the queen also complained to Charlotte that Piper treated the younger ladies-in-waiting too severely. However, Piper also, in collaboration with the king's confidant Fabian Wrede, contributed to establishing reconciliation between the king and the queen during their initial difficulty in getting to know each other.

Biography Born to Johan Jacob Ehrensv√§rd and Anna Maria Mannerheim, she married riksr√•d count Gustaf Adolf Hj√§rne in 1739. She and her spouse were both known sympathizers of the Hats. During the Age of Liberty, the Hats and Caps often maneuvered to have their sympathizers placed in court offices, and when the office of senior lady in waiting to the crown princess (from 1771 queen) Sophia Magdalena was to be permanently filled after Ulrica Catharina Stromberg in 1766, the Hats managed to have Hj√§rne appointed to the office.Norrhem, Svante (2007). Kvinnor vid maktens sida : 1632-1772. Lund: Nordic Academic Press. Libris 10428618. The appointment was however mostly formal: it was understood that Hj√§rne would only serve during grander occasions, and that the office would in practice be performed by her deputy (first Ernestine Palmfelt, from 1767 Charlotta Sparre).Till Sveriges historia utgifna af D:r E.

MONTAN Hj√§rne was acceptable to the office because of her status as riksr√•dinna, wife of a riksr√•d, but Axel von Fersen the Elder considered her to be unsuitable and not of sufficient character, sense and knowledge in the French language for the office. The conflict between Sophia Magdalena, who had the support of the Cap Party, and her mother-in-law, the Hat Party sympathizer Louisa Ulrika of Prussia was publicly known and disliked, and the sympathies were on Sophia Magdalena's side. Anna Maria Hj√§rne was a Hat sympathizer and reportedly slandered and spread rumors about Sophia Magdalena.Gerd Ribbing (1958) Gustav III:s hustru. Sofia Magdalena. Stockholm: Alb. Bonniers Boktryckeri. In the contemporary paper Dagligt Allehanda, a fable was presented about R√§vinnan och Turturduvan [The She Fox and the Turtle Dove] in 16 February 1771. The fable was about the innocent Turtle Dove (Sophia Magdalena) who was slandered by the wicked She Fox (Louisa Ulrika), who was supported by the Second She Fox (The Mistress of the Robes Anna Maria Hj√§rne) and the other Foxes (the nobility). The fable was believed to have been sent from the Caps Party. During the Revolution of 1772, queen Sophia Magdalena confided to Anna Maria Hj√§rne that she was afraid that the now all powerful monarch would divorce her because she knew he did not care for her, because she had not given him a child and because she knew she was being slandered before him. King Gustav III was informed of this and confided in Axel von Fersen the Elder that he was contemplating to divorce the queen for pro-Danish plots and adultery with riksr√•d Fredrik Ribbing, who was known to court her, and the Danish envoy baron Rosencrone, who forwarded letters from her to Denmark. The queen was known to enjoy the company of Ribbing, who amused her with compliments and once made her laugh by caricaturing her senior lady-in- waiting Anna Maria Hj√§rne, who reportedly told the king that the queen was pregnant \\"and the riksr√•d Ribbing is her favorite\\". The king gave Ulrica Catharina Stromberg, who was very well liked by the queen, the task to examine the statements made by Hj√§rne. Stromberg reported that she could not bring herself to ask the queen herself, but she did ask her kammarfru Charlotta Hellman, from whom she was given \\"information that left little doubt, particularly as the clearest evidence could be extracted from the linen of the queen.\\" Axel von Fersen the Elder however, advised against a divorce and stated that there was no other reason to suspect her of pro-Danish views than her affection for her Danish maids Ingrid Maria Wenner and Hansen, and that the understandable pleasure the queen, as a neglected wife, felt for the compliments of Ribbing was not sufficient to suspect her for actual adultery. The whole affair resulted in nothing. When the royal couple consummated their marriage with the assistance of Adolf Fredrik Munck in 1775, the king reportedly apologized to the queen for believing Hj√§rne's story. Anna Maria Hj√§rne was replaced in her office by Ulrika Str√∂mfelt in 1777.

It has an area of of Atlantic Forest covering the sources of the Paranapanema River. The park is in a mountainous area, and much of its territory is in the buffer zones of the Carlos Botelho and Intervales state parks. The region contains one of the best preserved remnants of Atlantic Forest in Brazil, and shelters many endangered species of flora and fauna. It also has a rich historical heritage and holds various tourist attractions. It is part of a biological corridor, or continuum, recognized by UNESCO as a biosphere reserve. History The Nascentes do Paranapanema State Park was announced during the June 2012 United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20). The new park and other units would make up the Paranapiacaba Conservation Units Mosaic, a forest massif of over . S√£o Paulo state decree 58.148 of 21 June 2012 created the state park and the mosaic. The objectives were protection of biodiversity, water resources and the biological corridor of Paranapiacaba, forming a biological continuum to preserve its ecological processes and gene flows, and to support ecotourism, leisure and environmental education. The park was expected to develop sustainable employment form ecological and cultural tourism in the region. The land was already owned by the state, and only ten residents had been identified, whose rights would be respected. The deputy mayor of Cap√£o Bonito said the municipality should be compensated for \\"freezing\\" of part of the territory. Important mineral resources could not now be extracted, two cement plants could not be expanded, and there were question over who would maintain rural roads in the area. Environment The forest is extremely well preserved, and is home to the largest population of jaguars (Panthera onca) in the Atlantic Forest. It includes other threatened species such as cougar (Puma concolor), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), bush dog (Speothos venaticus), pygmy brocket (Mazama nana) and southern muriqui (Brachyteles arachnoides). The connection between the various areas in the Paranapiacaba mosaic will help the species to survive. The jaguar tends to avoid areas frequented by man, which include areas used by hunters and gatherers of heart of palm in the reserve. It is estimated that there are just 250 individual jaguars in the states of Paran√°, S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, most of them in the mosaic area. There are more than 450 species of birds. The country people of the region consider that the primates in the park are good to eat. In 2012 environmental police seized the bodies of two howler monkeys and one southern muriqui. The muriqui, the largest primate in the Americas, is strongly threatened with extinction. In March 2013 environmental police found a hunter's camp with a shack equipped with a stove and kitchen utensils. A monkey that had been cleaned and was ready to eat was found, and the carcasses of an armadillo, and threatened birds such as solitary tinamou (Tinamus solitarius), neotropical bellbird and toucans.

A Monument of National Importance, it was commissioned by the 12th century Chahamana ruler Vigraharaja IV, who is also known as Bisal Deo.  History  View of the temple with low water level in the reservoir The temple is located in Bisalpur or Visalpur, which was also earlier known as Vigrahapura. The town was established by the Chahamana king Vigraharaja IV alias Visala or Bisal Deo (r. c. 1150‚Äì1164 CE). The king commissioned the temple that is now known as Bisal Deoji's temple. The courtyard of the temple is now partly submerged by the waters of the Bisalpur Dam reservoir whenever the water level is high; before the construction of the dam in the 1990s, the temple stood on the top of a hill overlooking the confluence of the Banas and the Dai rivers.

It was an adaptation of John Heathcoat's bobbinet machine. It made the miles of curtaining which screened Victorian and later windows. History The forerunner of the mechanical lace-making machine was the 1589 stocking frame. This is a weaving frame fitted with a bar of bearded needles that passed back and forth, to and from the operator. There was no warp. The beards were simultaneously depressed by a presser bar catching the weft and holding it back for a course, making a row of loops. After Jeremiah Strutt had modified the machine in 1759 to make it capable of ribbing, in 1764 Hammond introduced a tickler stick to transfer the loops 2 or 3 gaits sideways. In this way, mechanical lace-making was born. But there was no carriage or comb, and the operations continued to be performed sequentially by the operator. Invented by John Livesey in Nottingham in 1846, the lace curtain machine was initially seen as a form of a Leavers machine - a modification of the Circular. The Leavers mesh tends to be hexagonal, while the Curtain machine produces a straight mesh. The use of Jacquards for producing patterned lace was well established. At the 1851 Great Exhibition, curtains long by wide were displayed. Their extensive designs required over 12,000 Jacquard cards. The curtain lace industry prospered with the advent of the fashion for large rising sash windows. The width of the frame ultimately increased to , and in 1928 a machine of was considered to be the smallest viable size. Its supremacy was challenged in 1900 by the popularity of Schiffli embroideries produced on the bobbinet, then in the 1950s by the Raschel and the use of artificial fibres. Section of a lace machine as shown in 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. No Jacquard has been fitted. Description Viewed from the front, the frame is similar to that of a Leavers machine. However, its action is different, as it produces a square net rather than a hexagonal one. The Nottingham lace curtain machine only has one warp, and the patterning threads are carried on a spool, not on a beam. The terms to describe the actions are the same as those used for a Leavers machine: rise, fall, right, left, sley, carriage, comb etc. The lace is collected at the top, unlike the Pusher machine, where it is collected at the bottom. Collection is via a take-up beam; a spiky roller beneath it called the porcupine regulated the take-up tension. =The curtain machine= There are four groups of thread: warp, top board, bottom board and bobbin. On a 10-point, 360-inch machine there are four groups of 3,600 threads, making a total of 14,400 threads. (The term 'point' refers to the number of warps per inch.) * The warp passes down the lace in straight lines. The warp beam is at the bottom; the thread passes through a sley, and then through the front guide bar (also known as the warp bar). The warp bar is controlled by a cam. All the warps remain in parallel; they cannot pattern. Their function is to generate the skeletal support for the fabric. * The top board threads can act as both warp and weft - they can pillar to the weft, or they can shog gaits in the pattern as weft. The threads pass through tensioning springs, then through a sley and through holes in the back guide bar (third bar, coarse spool bar). * The bottom board (also known as a Swiss board or occasionally beam) was not present in the early machines. It acts as the weft in both the ground and the pattern. This contains the finer threads. If the pattern is complex, spools must be used, but a beam can be used where the pattern is fairly even. The threads pass through a tensioning spring and through holes in the middle guide bar (also known as a Swiss bar or fine spool bar). * The bobbin threads tie the top and bottom board threads to the pillars. The bobbin threads are carried on brass bobbins held in carriages that are swung back and forth on combs in a pushing and catching routine. Pillaring is controlled by the pillaring cam; when the net is being made the pillars must be connected, which can be done by the spool threads (top or bottom board). These are secured each time by the bobbin threads. Patterning or gimping is created by using longer shogs on the spool threads. There are three guide bars controlled by work cams. These allow a shogging movement across 2, 3 or 4 gaits. The cams cannot be stopped, but threads in the middle and back bars can be interrupted by a Jacquard mechanism. Each bobbin thread has its own jack - a steel wire that can interrupt its movement and create a hole in the pattern, in effect leaving off a tie.

Five years later, in 1766, Stromberg was appointed temporary mistress of the robes to the new crown princess, Sophia Magdalena of Denmark, who arrived to Sweden to marry Gustav III of Sweden that year. This was a purely temporary position however: she was given the task to head the newly appointed Swedish court of the new crown princess upon her arrival in Helsingborg and then accompany her during her trip through Sweden to her wedding in Stockholm, after which she was replaced by the permanent mistress of the robes, Anna Maria Hj√§rne, and her deputy Ernestine Palmfelt. During her short service, however, Sophia Magdalena was given such a good impression by Stromberg that she often mentioned her good qualities in conversation to others, and repeatedly expressed a wish to visit her (requests which was however denied by her mother-in-law).Gustav III:s hustru. Sofia Magdalena. Stockholm: Alb. Bonniers Boktryckeri. ISBN During the Revolution of 1772, queen Sophia Magdalena confided to Anna Maria Hj√§rne that she was afraid that the now all powerful monarch would divorce her because she knew he did not care for her, because she had not given him a child and because she knew she was being slandered before him. King Gustav III was informed of this and confided in Axel von Fersen the Elder that he was contemplating to divorce the queen for pro-Danish plots and adultery with riksr√•d Fredrik Ribbing, who was known to court her, and the Danish envoy baron Rosencrone, who forwarded letters from her to Denmark. The queen was known to enjoy the company of Ribbing, who amused her with compliments and once made her laugh by caricaturing her senior lady-in-waiting Anna Maria Hj√§rne, who reportedly told the king that the queen was pregnant \\"and the riksr√•d Ribbing is her favorite\\". The king gave Ulrica Catharina Stromberg, who was very well liked by the queen, the task to examine the statements made by Hj√§rne. Stromberg reported that she could not bring herself to ask the queen herself, but she did ask her kammarfru Charlotta Hellman, from whom she was given \\"information that left little doubt, particularly as the clearest evidence could be extracted from the linen of the queen.\\" Axel von Fersen the Elder however, advised against a divorce and stated that there was no other reason to suspect her of pro-Danish views than her affection for her Danish maids Ingrid Maria Wenner and Hansen, and that the understandable pleasure the queen, as a neglected wife, felt for the compliments of Ribbing was not sufficient to suspect her for actual adultery. The whole affair resulted in nothing. When the royal couple consummated their marriage with the assistance of Adolf Fredrik Munck in 1775, the king reportedly apologized to the queen for believing Hj√§rne's story.

The legend states that while the queen lay dying at Karlberg Palace in 1693, her favorite lady-in-waiting and Mistress of the Robes, Countess Maria Elisabeth Stenbock, lay sick in Stockholm. On the night the queen had died, Countess Stenbock visited Karlberg and was admitted alone to the room containing the remains of the queen.

In photon upconversion, two or more incident photons of relatively low energy are absorbed and converted into one emitted photon with higher energy. Generally, absorption occurs in the infrared, while emission occurs in the visible or ultraviolet regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. UCNPs are usually composed of rare-earth based lanthanide- or actinide-doped transition metals and are of particular interest for their applications in in vivo bio-imaging, bio-sensing, and nanomedicine because of their highly efficient cellular uptake and high optical penetrating power with little background noise in the deep tissue level. They also have potential applications in photovoltaics and security, such as infrared detection of hazardous materials. Before 1959, the anti-Stokes shift was believed to describe all situations in which emitted photons have higher energies than the corresponding incident photons. An anti-Stokes shift occurs when a thermally excited ground state is electronically excited, leading to a shift of only a few kBT, where kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is temperature. At room temperature, kBT is 25.7 meV. In 1959, Nicolaas Bloembergen proposed an energy diagram for crystals containing ionic impurities. Bloembergen described the system as having excited-state emissions with energy differences much greater than kBT, in contrast to the anti-Stokes shift. Advances in laser technology in the 1960s allowed the observation of non-linear optical effects such as upconversion. This led to the experimental discovery of photon upconversion in 1966 by Fran√ßois Auzel. Auzel showed that a photon of infrared light could be upconverted into a photon of visible light in ytterbium‚Äìerbium and ytterbium‚Äìthulium systems. In a transition-metal lattice doped with rare-earth metals, an excited-state charge transfer exists between two excited ions. Auzel observed that this charge transfer allows an emission of photon with much higher energy than the corresponding absorbed photon. Thus, upconversion can occur through a stable and real excited state, supporting Bloembergen's earlier work. This result catapulted upconversion research in lattices doped with rare-earth metals. One of the first examples of efficient lanthanide doping, the Yb/Er-doped fluoride lattice, was achieved in 1972 by Menyuk et al.  Physics  Photon upconversion belongs to a larger class of processes by which light incident on a material induces anti-Stokes emission. Multiple quanta of energy such as photons or phonons are absorbed, and a single photon with the summed energy is emitted. It is important to make the distinction between photon upconversion, where real metastable excited states allow for sequential absorption, and other nonlinear processes like second-harmonic generation or two-photon excited fluorescence which involve virtual intermediate states such as the \\"simultaneous\\" absorption of two or more photons. It is also distinct from more weakly anti-Stokes processes like thermoluminescence or anti-Stokes Raman emission, which are due to initial thermal population of low-lying excited states and consequently show emission energies only a few kBT above the excitation. Photon upconversion is distinctly characterized by emission-excitation differences of 10‚Äì100 kBT. and an observable fluorescence lifetime after the excitation source has been switched off. Transmission electron microscopy image of upconversion nanoparticles Photon upconversion relies on metastable states to facilitate sequential energy absorption. Therefore, a necessary condition for upconverting systems is the existence of optically active long-lived excited states. This role is traditionally filled by lanthanide metal ions embedded in an insulating host lattice. Generally in the +3 oxidation state, these ions have 4fn electronic configurations and typically exhibit f-f transitions. These 4f orbitals allow for complex electronic structures and a large number of possible electronic excited states with similar energies. When embedded in bulk crystals or nanostructures, the energies of these excited states will further split under crystal field, generating a series of states with many closely spaced energies. The 4f shell is localized near the core of the ion and is therefore non-bonding, while the 5s and 5p shells provide further shielding from the exterior crystal field. Thus, the coupling of electronic excited states to the surrounding lattice is weak, leading to long excited state lifetimes and sharp optical lineshapes. The physical processes responsible for upconversion in nanoparticles are the same as those in bulk crystals on the microscopic level, although total efficiency and other ensemble effects will have unique considerations in the nanoparticle case. The processes contributing to upconversion may be grouped according to the number of ions involved. The two most common processes by which upconversion can occur in lanthanide-doped nanoscale materials are excited state absorption (ESA) and energy transfer upconversion (ETU). A single ion in the lattice sequentially absorbs two photons and emits a photon of higher energy as it returns to the ground state. ESA is most common when dopant concentrations are low and energy-transfer is not probable. Since ESA is a process where two photons must be absorbed at a single lattice site, coherent pumping and high intensity are much more important (but not necessarily required) than for ETU. Because of its single-ion nature, ESA does not depend on the lanthanide ion concentration. Two-ion processes are usually dominated by energy transfer upconversion (ETU). This is characterized by the successive transfer of energy from singly excited ions (sensitizers/donors), to the ion which eventually emits (activators/acceptors). This process is commonly portrayed as the optical excitation of the activator followed by further excitation to the final fluorescing state due to energy transfer from a sensitizer. While this depiction is valid, the more strongly contributing process is the sequential excitation of the activator by two or more different sensitizer ions. The upconversion process is said to be cooperative when there are one or more elementary steps (sensitization or luminescence) in the process which involve multiple lanthanide ions. In cooperative sensitization process, two ions in their excited state simultaneously decay to their ground states, generating a higher energy photon. Similarly, in cooperative luminescence, two excited state ions transfer their energy to a neighboring ion in one elementary step. Luminescence spectra of cubic NaYF4:Yb,Er upconversion nanoparticles illuminated at 980 nm. Energy migration-mediated upconversion (EMU) involves four types of luminescent ion centers with different roles. They are located in separate layers of a core-shell structure of the nanomaterial to inhibit relaxation processes between ions. In this case, low-energy photons are excited in an ETU process that populates an excited state of another ion. Energy from this state can transfer to an adjacent ion through a core-shell interface and is then emitted. Recently, moving forward in the challenge of designing particles with tunable emissions, important progress in synthesis of high-quality nano-structured crystals has enabled new pathways for photon upconversion. This includes the possibility of creating particles with core/shell structures, allowing upconversion through interfacial energy transfer (IET), upon which the interactions between typical lanthanide donor- acceptor pairs including Yb-Er, Yb-Tm, Yb-Ho, Gd-Tb, Gd-Eu and Nd-Yb can be precisely controlled on the nanoscale. The photon avalanche (PA) mechanism uses photon pump intensity thresholds to control the luminescence intensity, and can therefore have the highest upconversion efficiency with strong emissions. This phenomenon exploits cross-relaxation to increase the excited state population. Cross-relaxation is a process in which an excited state ion transfers energy to a ground state ion of the same type producing two excited ions of intermediate energy. Although PA is seen in some systems, it is the least observed mechanism for upconversion. The mechanism for photon upconversion in lanthanide-doped nanoparticles is essentially the same as in bulk material, but some surface and size-related effects have been shown to have important consequences. While quantum confinement is not expected to have an effect on the energy levels in lanthanide ions since the 4f electrons are sufficiently localized, other effects have been shown to have important consequences on emission spectra and efficiency of UCNPs. Radiative relaxation is in competition with non-radiative relaxation, so phonon density of states becomes an important factor. In addition, phonon-assisted processes are important in bringing the energy states of the f orbitals in range so that energy transfer can occur. In nanocrystals, low frequency phonons do not occur in the spectrum, so the phonon band becomes a discrete set of states. With non-radiative relaxation decreasing the lifetimes of excited states and phonon-assistance increasing the probability of energy transfer, the effects of size are complicated because these effects compete with one another. Surface-related effects can also have a large influence on luminescence color and efficiency. Surface ligands on nanocrystals can have large vibrational energy levels, which can significantly contribute to phonon-assisted effects.  Chemistry  The chemical composition of upconverting nanoparticles, UCNPs, directly influences their conversion efficiency and spectral characteristics. Primarily, three compositional parameters influence the particles‚Äô performance: the host lattice, activator ions, and sensitizer ions. The NaYF4:RE cubic unit cell. Key: Na (Teal), rare-earth element (RE, pink), and F (yellow). The spaces labelled with two colors can be occupied by either Na or RE elements. The host lattice provides structure for both the activator and sensitizer ions and acts as a medium that conducts energy transfer. This host lattice has to satisfy three requirements: low lattice phonon energies, high chemical stability, and low symmetry of the lattice. The major mechanism responsible for reduced upconversion is nonradiative phonon relaxation. Generally, if large numbers of phonons are needed to convert excitation energy into phonon energy, the efficiency of the nonradiative process is lowered. Low phonon energies in the host lattice prevent this loss, improving the conversion efficiency of incorporated activator ions. The lattice must also be stable under chemical and photochemical conditions, as these are the environments the conversion will take place within. Finally, this host lattice ought to have low symmetry, allowing for a slight relaxation of the Laporte selection rules. The normally forbidden transitions lead to an increase in the f-f intermixing and thus enhancement of the upconversion efficiency. Other considerations about the host lattice include choice of cation and anions. Importantly, cations should have similar radii to the intended dopant ions: For example, when using lanthanide dopant ions, certain alkaline-earth (Ca2+), rare-earth (Y+), and transition-metal ions (Zr4+) all fulfill this requirement, as well as Na+. Similarly, the choice of anion is important as it significantly affects the phonon energies and chemical stability. Heavy halides like Cl‚àí and Br‚àí have the lowest phonon energies and so are the least likely to promote nonradiative decay pathways. However, these compounds are generally hygroscopic and thus not suitably stable. Oxides on the other hand can be quite stable but have high phonon energies. Fluorides provide a balance between the two, having both stability and suitably low phonon energies. As such, it is evident why some of the most popular and efficient UCNP compositions are NaYF4:Yb/Er and NaYF4:Yb/Tm. Choice of activator dopant ions is influenced by comparing relative energy levels: The energy difference between the ground state and the intermediate state should be similar to the difference between the intermediate state and the excited emission state. This minimizes non-radiative energy loss and facilitates both absorption and energy transfer. Generally, UCNPs contain some combination of rare-earth elements (Y, Sc, and the lanthanides), such as Er3+, Tm3+, and Ho3+ ions, since they have several levels that follow this \\"ladder\\" pattern especially well. Lanthanide dopants are used as activator ions because they have multiple 4f excitation levels and completely filled 5s and 5p shells, which shield their characteristic 4f electrons, thus producing sharp f-f transition bands. These transitions provide substantially longer lasting excited states, since they are Laporte forbidden, thus allowing longer time necessary for the multiple excitations required for upconversion. The concentration of activator ions in UCNPs is also critically important, as this determines the average distance between the activator ions and therefore affects how easily energy is exchanged. If the concentration of activators is too high and energy transfer too facile, cross-relaxation may occur, reducing emission efficiency. Efficiency of UCNPs doped with only activators is usually low, due to their low absorption cross section and necessarily low concentration. Sensitizer ions are doped into the host lattice along with the activator ions in UCNPs to facilitate Electron Transfer Upconversion. The most commonly used sensitizer ion is trivalent Yb3+. This ion provides a much larger absorption cross- section for incoming near-IR radiation, while only displaying a single excited 4f state. And since the energy gap between the ground level and this excited state matches well with the \\"ladder\\" gaps in the common activator ions, resonant energy transfers between the two dopant types. Typical UCNPs are doped with approximately 20 mol% sensitizer ions and less than 2 mol% activator ions. These concentrations allow adequate distance between activators, avoiding cross-relaxation, and still absorb enough excitation radiation through the sensitizers to be efficient. Currently, other types of sensitizers are being developed to increase the spectral range available for upconversion, such as semi-conductor nanocrystal-organic ligand hybrids. =Synthesis= UCNP synthesis focuses on controlling several aspects of the nanoparticles ‚Äì the size, shape, and phase. Control over each of these aspects may be achieved through different synthetic pathways, of which co- precipitation, hydro(solvo)thermal, and thermolysis are the most common. Different synthetic methods have different advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of synthesis must balance simplicity/ease of process, cost, and ability to achieve desired morphologies. Generally, solid-state synthesis techniques are the easiest for controlling the composition of the nanoparticles, but not the size or surface chemistry. Liquid-based syntheses are efficient and typically better for the environment. The simplest and most economical method, in which components of the nanocrystal are mixed together in solution and allowed to precipitate. This method yields nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution (around 100 nm), but that lack the precision of more intricate methods, thereby requiring more post-synthesis work up. NPs can be improved with an annealing step at high temperatures, but this often leads to aggregation, limiting applications. Common coprecipiation synthesized NPs include rare-earth-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles prepared in the presence of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and LaYbEr prepared in NaF and organic phosphates (capping ligands). Hydro(solvo)thermal, also known as hydrothermal/solvothermal, methods are implemented in sealed containers at higher temperatures and pressures in an autoclave. This method allows precise control over shape and size (monodisperse), but at the cost of long synthesis times and the inability to observe growth in real-time. More specialized techniques include sol-gel processing (hydrolysis and polycondensation of metal alkoxides), and combustion (flame) synthesis, which are rapid, non- solution phase pathways. Efforts to develop water-soluble and \\"green\\" total syntheses are also being explored, with the first of these methods implementing polyethylenimine (PEI)-coated nanoparticles. Thermal decomposition uses high temperature solvents to decompose molecular precursors into nuclei, which grow at roughly the same rate, yielding high quality, monodisperse NPs. Growth is guided by precursor decomposition kinetics and Oswald ripening, allowing for fine control over particle size, shape and structure by temperature and reactant addition and identity. = Molecular mass = For many chemical and biological applications, it is useful to quantify the concentration of upconversion nanoparticles in terms of molecular mass. For this purpose, each nanoparticle can be considered a macromolecule. To calculate the molecular mass of a nanoparticle, the size of the nanoparticle, the size and shape of the unit cell structure, and the unit cell elemental composition must be known. These parameters can be obtained from transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction respectively. From this, the number of unit cells in a nanoparticle, and thus the total mass of the nanoparticle, can be estimated. =Post-synthetic modification= As the size of the crystal decreases, the ratio of the surface area to volume increases dramatically, exposing dopant ions to being quenched due to effects of surface impurities, ligands, and solvents. Therefore, nano-sized particles are inferior to their bulk counterparts in upconversion efficiency. Experimental investigation reveals the dominant role of ligand in non- radiative relaxation process. There are several ways to increase the efficiencies of upconverting nanoparticles. This includes shell growth, ligand exchange and bilayer formation. It has been shown that the introduction of an inert shell of a crystalline material around each doped NP serves as an effective way to isolate the core from the surrounding and surface deactivators, thus increasing upconverting efficiency. For example, 8 nm NaYF4 Yb3+/Tm3+ UCNPs coated with a 1.5 nm thick NaYF4 shell, show 30-fold enhancement of the upconverting luminescence. The shell can be grown epitaxially using two general approaches: i) using molecular precursors; ii) using sacrificial particles (see Ostwald ripening). Moreover, a critical thickness of the shell for the emission enhancement may exist that serves as a design factor. The molecular precursor of the shell material is mixed with the core particles in high-boiling solvents such as oleic acid and octadecene and the resultant mixture is heated to 300 ¬∞C to decompose the shell precursor. The shell tends to grow epitaxially on the core particles. Since the host matrix of the core and the shell are of similar chemical composition (to achieve uniform epitaxial growth), there is no contrast difference between the corresponding TEM images before and after the shell growth. Consequently, the possibility of the alloy instead of the core‚Äìshell formation cannot be easily excluded. However, it is possible to distinguish between the two scenarios using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). =Ligand exchange= As- synthesized UCNPs are usually capped with organic ligands that aid in size and shape control during preparation. These ligands make their surface hydrophobic and hence are not dispersible in aqueous solution, preventing their biological applications. One simple method to increase solubility in aqueous solvents is direct ligand exchange. This requires a more favored ligand to replace the initial ones. The hydrophobic native ligand capping the NP during synthesis (usually a long chain molecule like oleic acid) is directly substituted with a more polar hydrophilic one, which are usually multi-chelating (e.g. polyethylene glycol (PEG)-phosphate, polyacrylic acid) and hence provides better stabilization and binding, resulting in their exchange. A shortcoming of this method is the slow kinetics associated with the exchange. Generally the new ligand is also functionalized with a group like thiol that allows for facile binding to the NP surface. The protocol for direct exchange is simple, generally involving mixing for an extended period of time, but the work-up can be tedious, conditions must be optimized for each system, and aggregation may occur. However the two-step process of ligand exchange involves the removal of original ligands followed by coating hydrophilic ones, which is a better method. The ligand removal step here was reported through various ways. A simple way was wash the particles with ethanol under ultrasonic treatment. Reagents like nitrosonium tetrafluoroborate or acids are used to strip the native ligands off of the NP surface to attach favorable ones later on. This method shows less tendency for NP aggregation than the direct exchange, and can be generalized to other types of nanoparticles. =Formation of bilayer= Another method involves coating the UCNP in long amphiphilic alkyl chains to create a pseudo bilayer. The hydrophobic tails of the amphiphiles are inserted in between the oleate ligands on the surface of the NP, leaving the hydrophilic heads to face outwards. Phospholipids have been used for this purpose with great success, as they are readily engulfed by biological cells Using this strategy, surface charge is easily controlled by choosing the second layer and some functionalized molecules can be loaded to the outer layer. Both surface charge and surface functional groups are important in bioactivity of nanoparticles. A cheaper strategy for making lipid bilayer coating is to use amphiphilic polymers instead of amphiphilic molecules.  Applications  =Bioimaging= Bioimaging with UCNPs involves using a laser to excite the UCNPs within a sample and then detecting the emitted, frequency- doubled light. UCNPs are advantageous for imaging due to their narrow emission spectra, high chemical stability, low toxicity, weak autofluorescence background, long luminescence lifetime, and high resistance to photoquenching and photobleaching. In comparison to traditional biolabels, which use Stokes- shift processes and require high photon energies, UCNPs utilize an anti-Stokes mechanism that allows for the use of lower energy, less damaging and more deeply penetrating light. Multimodal imaging agents combine multiple modes of signal reporting. UCNPs with Gd3+ or Fe2O3 can serve as luminescent probes and MRI contrast agents. UCNPs are also used in the configuration of photoluminescence and X-ray computed tomography (CT), and trimodal UCNPs combining photoluminescence, X-ray CT, and MRI have also been prepared. By taking advantage of the attractive interaction between fluoride and lanthanide ions, UCNPs can be used as imaging agents based on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), helping to image lymph nodes and to assist in staging for cancer surgery. UCNPs as targeted fluorophores and conjugated with ligands form over-expressed receptors on malignant cells, serving as a photoluminescence label to selectively image cells. UCNPs have also been used in functional imaging, such as the targeting of lymph nodes and the vascular system to assist in cancer surgeries. UCNPs enable multiplexed imaging by dopant modulation, shifting emission peaks to wavelengths that can be resolved. Single-band UCNPs conjugated to antibodies are used in detecting breast cancer cells, surpassing traditional fluorophore labeling of antibodies, which is not amenable to multiplexed analysis. =Biosensors and temperature sensors= UCNPs have been used as nanothermometers to detect intracellular temperature differences. (NaYF4: 20% Yb3+, 2% Er3+) @NaYF4 core‚Äìshell structured hexagonal nanoparticles can measure temperatures in the physiological range (25 ¬∞C to 45 ¬∞C) with less than 0.5 ¬∞C precision in HeLa cells. UNCPs can be made much more versatile biosensors by combining them with recognition elements like enzymes or antibodies. Intracellular glutathione was detected using UCNPs modified with MnO2 nanosheets. MnO2 nanosheets quench UCNP luminescence, and glutathione was observed to selectively restore this luminescence through reduction of MnO2 to Mn2+. NaYF4: Yb3+/Tm3+ nanoparticles with SYBR Green I dye can probe Hg2+ in vitro with a detection limit of 0.06 nM. Hg2+ and other heavy metals have been measured in live cells. The tunable and multiplexed emissions allow for the simultaneous detection of different species. =Drug release and delivery= There are three ways to construct UCNP-based drug delivery systems. First, UCNPs can transport hydrophobic drugs, like doxorubicin, by encapsulating them on the particle surface, the hydrophobic pocket. The drug can be released by a pH change. Second, mesoporous silica coated UCNPs can be used, where drugs can be stored and released from the porous surface. Thirdly, the drug can be encapsulated and transferred in a hollow UCNP shell. Light-activated processes that deliver or activate medicine are known as photodynamic therapeutic (PDT). Many photoactive compounds, are triggered by UV light, which has smaller penetration depth and causes more tissue damage compared with IR light. UCNPs can be used to locally trigger UV-activated compounds when irradiated with benign IR irradiation. For instance, UCNPs can absorb IR light and emit visible light to trigger a photosensitizer, which can produce highly reactive singlet oxygen to destroy tumor cells. This non-toxic and effective approach has been demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. Similarly, UCNPs can be used in photothermal therapy, which destroys targets by heat. In UCNP-plasmonic nanoparticle composites (e.g. NaYF4:Yb Er@Fe3O4@Au17), the UCNPs target tumor cells and the plasmonic nanoparticles generate heat to kill cancer cells. [Field] nanoparticles generate heat to kill cancer cells. UCNPs have been integrated into solar panels to broaden the spectrum of sunlight that can be captured and converted into electricity. The maximum output of a solar cell is dictated in part by the fraction of incident photons captured to promote electrons. Solar cells can only absorb and convert photons with energy equal to or greater than the bandgap. Any incident photon with energy smaller than the bandgap is lost. UCNPs can capture this wasted sunlight by combining multiple low energy IR photons into a single high energy photon. The emitted photon will have sufficient energy to promote charge carriers across the band gap. UCNPs can be integrated into solar cell systems of a number of different classes and in multiple forms. For example, UCNPs can be laminated onto the back sides of semiconductors as a film, to collect low energy light and upconvert it. Such a treatment generated a 37% efficiency for upconverted light. Another strategy is to disperse the nanoparticles throughout a highly porous material. In one device architecture, UCNPs are infiltrated into a titania micro-scaffold. More titania is added to embed the UCNPs, UCNPs have also been used in dye-sensitized cells. =Photoswitching= Photoswitching is the conversion from one chemical isomer to another triggered by light. Photoswitching finds use in optical data processing and storage and in photorelease. Photorelease is the use of light to induce a moiety attached to the nanoparticle surface to detach. UCNPs of lanthanide-doped NaYF4 have been applied as remote control photoswitches. UCNPs are useful photoswitches because they can be irradiated with low-cost NIR radiation and convert it into UV radiation extremely locally. Photocatalytic systems can be enhanced with UCNPs by the same principle as solar cells. In titania coated with YF3:Yb/Tm UCNPs, degradation of pollutants was observed under NIR radiation. Normally low-energy NIR radiation cannot induce photocatalysis in titania, which has a band gap in the UV range. The excitation in titania results in a surface redox reaction which decomposes compounds near the surface. UCNPs enable cheap low- energy NIR photons to replace expensive UV photons. In biological contexts UV light is highly absorbed and causes tissue damage. However NIR is weakly absorbed and induces UCNP behavior in vivo. Core-shell UCNPs were used to initiate the photocleavage of a ruthenium complex using an intensity of NIR light that is completely safe in biomedical use. UCNP-based systems can couple both light-based techniques and current-based techniques. This optical stimulation of semiconductors is then coupled with voltage-based stimulation in order to store information. Other advantages of utilizing UCNPs for flash drives include that all materials employed are photo- and thermally stable. Furthermore, imperfections in the UCNP film will not affect data storage. These advantages yielded an impressive achieved storage limit, making UCNP films a promising material in optical storage. UCNPs can be applied in niche applications for displays and printing. Anti-counterfeiting codes or prints can be fabricated using UCNPs in existing colloidal ink preparations. Flexible, transparent displays have also been fabricated using UCNPs. New security inks which incorporate lanthanide doped upconverting nanoparticles have many advantages. Also, these inks are invisible until subjected to NIR light. Red, green and blue upconverting inks have been achieved. The color produced from some overlapped ink depends on the power density of the NIR excitation, which enables the incorporation of additional security features. The use of upconverting nanoparticles in fingerprinting is highly selective. The upconverting nanoparticles can bind to lysozyme in sweat that is deposited when a fingertip touches a surface. Also, a cocaine-specific aptamer is developed to identify cocaine-laced fingerprints by the same method. Upconverting nanoparticles can also be used for barcoding. These micro- barcodes can be embedded onto various objects. The barcodes are seen under NIR illumination and can be imaged using an iPhone camera and a microscope objective.

Early life and career Born in Barletta in 1887, Casardi entered the Livorno Naval Academy in 1904, graduating as Ensign in 1907.Dizionario Biografico Uomini della Marina. Between 1911 and 1912, as a midshipman, he first took part in a campaign in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean aboard the aviso Staffetta, and then fought in the Italo-Turkish war. During World War I he served as lieutenant on the battleships Vittorio Emanuele and Dante Alighieri. After the end of the war, Casardi served for some years in command of torpedo boats; in 1920 he sailed up the Danube on the torpedo boat 69 PN. After promotion to Lieutenant Commander, he was appointed commanding officer of the destroyers Generale Antonio Chinotto and Vincenzo Giordano Orsini; he was subsequently promoted to commander, and given shore assignments in the Ministry of the Navy and the Arms and Naval Armaments Management Direction in La Spezia, then he became deputy chief of staff of the Special Naval Division and later commanding officer of the destroyers Alvise da Mosto and Ugolino Vivaldi in 1931-1932. From 1932 to 1934, after promotion to captain, he was sent to Washington as naval attach√© and then, back in Italy, he became honorary aide-de-camp to Victor Emmanuel III. In 1935 Casardi became adjunct chief of staff of the 1st Naval Division, embarked on the heavy cruiser Pola, while in 1936 he briefly commanded the cruisers Giovanni delle Bande Nere and Zara. In 1937, after promotion to rear admiral, he was placed in command of Naval Command Libya, which he held until February 1940. During this period, in 1939, he was promoted to vice admiral; from February to May 1940 he commanded the 4th Naval Division. He was then placed in command of the 2nd Naval Division, formed by light cruisers Giovanni delle Bande Nere (flagship) and Bartolomeo Colleoni, and he still held this role when Italy entered World war II, on June 10, 1940. World War II and later years After escorting to Libya the convoy that triggered the Battle of Calabria, Casardi became a protagonist, in July 1940, of the Battle of Cape Spada, in which Colleoni was sunk.Giorgio Giorgerini, \\"La guerra italiana sul mare. La Marina tra vittoria e sconfitta 1940-1943\\", pp. 168 to 202. Following the loss of Colleoni, the 2nd Naval Division was dissolved; in August 1940 Casardi was placed in command of the 7th Naval Division, with flag on the light cruiser Eugenio Savoia and later on Emanuele Filiberto Duca d'Aosta. For a year, as the commander of the 7th Division, Casardi participated in convoy escort, bombardment and minelaying missions; he was awarded the Silver Medal of Military Valor, the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Savoy and Cross of the Order of the German Eagle, second class. Since August 1941, having left the command of the Seventh Division, Casardi was for two years the staff and general services director of the Regia Marina. On August 7, 1943 he was appointed commander in chief of the Naples Naval Department. Following the armistice of 8 September 1943, clashes broke out in Naples between Italian and German soldiers, and in a few days the city was occupied by German forces.Giuseppe Fioravanzo (USMM), \\"La Marina dall‚Äô8 settembre 1943 alla fine del conflitto\\", pp. 141-142-143-144. On September 11 Casardi, in order to avoid capture, sought refuge with his main collaborators in a building owned by his chief of staff, where he continued to work clandestinely until September 30, when German troops left Naples in the face of the insurrection of the population of the city and the Allied advance. He immediately returned to his headquarters, devastated by bombing and fighting, and reactivated it on the following day, immediately starting the cooperation with the commands of the Allied forces, which reached Naples from 1 October. He left the command of the Naples Naval Department in February 1945, and was then assigned to the General Secretariat of the Navy and later became president of the High Council of the Navy.

There are two different groups of Nagarathar kavadi that would travel towards Pazhani and be joined a few kilometres before Pazhani. They are named Melavattagai Kavadi and Keelvattagai Kavadi.  Starting place People from across Chettinad towns in Sivaganga and Pudukottai district start from their respective towns and reach Kundrakudi on the 8th day night before Thaipoosam. Once the kavadi from across the towns are gathered in Kundrakudi, next morning all the kavadi will start with Vel leading all the kavadis and pachai kavadi at the end.  Basic rules  In early days the information is unclear. Based on the written pattayam, a person should bathe before lifting and placing the kavadi on his shoulder. Once he started walking with kavadi on his shoulder he should not drink water or urinate. If he needs to do that, he needs to bathe again before having the kavadi placed on his shoulder. The person carrying the kavadi should wear a white dhoti, and he should stay in the same dhoti until the kavadi is offered to Lord Murugan in Pazhani.  Guides  Throughout the yathra, all the kavadi will be guided by Aranmanai Pongal Ayya and Samiyadi Ayya. This history dates back to past years, where Aranmanai Pongal Ayya will prepare and serve food for all persons walking with kavadi and later will do all poojas to kavadi. Melavattagai Kavadi will be guided by Nerkuppai Ayya.  Kavadi Pooja  Throughout the journey, until the kavadis are offered to Lord Murugan in Pazhani, pooja will be done to kavadi. It is believed that Lord Murugan/Pazhani Andavan is in each and every kavadi. The pooja happens in these places after starting from Kundrakudi. # First day night - Maruthipatti # Second day night - Samudrapatti # Third day night - Idaichi Madam # Fourth day night - Semmadapatti # Fifth day night - Kalingappayya OOrani # Sixth day - First pooja in Annadhana Madam # Seventh day - Second Pooja in Annadhana Madam and Thaipoosam # Eighth day - Third Pooja in Annadhana Madam # Ninth day - Fourth day Pooja in Annadhana Madam and kavadi offering to Lord Murugan in the Hill Temple, Pazhani # Tenth day - Fifth day pooja in Annadhana Madam # Eleventh day - Sixth day aduppadi pooja in Annadhana Madam # Twelfth day - Sandhana Abhishekam and kavadi will start returning to native home town.

The group is known for reporting on far-right organizations and sources of racial and economic injustice in the US. The non- hierarchical media organization operates in the US cities of Boston, Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul, and Philadelphia as well as in South Africa. They produce live streams of political rallies and protests and are funded by viewer donation and grants. Structure Unicorn Riot currently has around 10 members, based in Boston, Denver, Minneapolis, Philadelphia and South Africa. The media collective is non-hierarchical and makes decisions based on consensus. Unicorn Riot has maintained a channel on livestream.org since May 2015. Besides creating live video of protests, the media collective also engages in investigative journalism, producing web series, video packages, blogs, and podcasts. They have published documents obtained through open records requests, including a copy of the Denver Police Department Crowd Management Manual. They also produce the weekly news show Deprogram. Unicorn Riot releases its content under a Creative Commons license. History =Foundation= The founding members of Unicorn Riot met while filming direct actions in support of Tar Sands Blockade and Occupy Wall Street. Some had previously worked for online news outlets and had grown frustrated with news organizations that failed to publish their work. The founders of Unicorn Riot started meeting in Minneapolis in the fall of 2014. Among the founders were Lorenzo Serna, Andrew Neef, Niko Georgiades, Pat Boyle, and Ray Weiland,. Unicorn Riot claims to seek to \\"amplify the voices of people from marginalized communities\\" and to broadcast and bring context to stories that are not picked up by the mainstream media. Early on, they documented the Ferguson protests following the shooting of Michael Brown. During the next year, Unicorn Riot registered as an educational 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization. Unicorn Riot journalists are often embedded in protests, and film from the front lines. Members of the media collective have been repeatedly targeted for arrest by law enforcement officers and often have their cameras and equipment confiscated. Their press credentials have also been challenged by the police. =Black Lives Matter protests= Unicorn Riot has documented a number of rallies and protests related to the Black Lives Matter movement. Following the November 2015 shooting of Jamar Clark in Minneapolis, Unicorn Riot maintained a live stream of the occupation of the Minneapolis Police Department's 4th Precinct station. The media collective also documented the protests that took place following the shooting of Philando Castile, including blockages of interstate freeways. =Denver homeless encampments= In Denver, Colorado, Unicorn Riot live streamed the removal of homeless encampments, including an eviction that took place during a blizzard on the morning of December 15, 2015. =Dakota Access Pipeline protests= During the protests against the Dakota Access Pipeline, Unicorn Riot was one of the first media groups to be present when Standing Rock Sioux tribe members set up the Sacred Stone Camp on April 1, 2016. The media collective has maintained a near continuous presence at the pipeline protests. Video from Unicorn Riot showing a crowd of protesters being sprayed with water cannons during sub-zero temperatures was used to contradict police reports that the cannons were only being used to put out fires. Four Unicorn Riot reporters were arrested in September and October 2016. Chris Schiano and Georgiades were arrested on September 13 as they were filming protesters who had locked themselves to equipment being used to construct the pipeline. Reporter Lorenzo Serna was arrested in both North Dakota and Iowa, and reporter Jenn Schreiter was arrested in October while reporting on a lockdown at a DAPL construction site in Iowa. =Unite the Right rally= Unicorn Riot had documented several of the chat rooms in the Discord application prior to the Unite the Right rally in August 2017, which led to violence between alt right groups and local citizens, including the death of one person. The group subsequently released this material, which was used to identify the anonymous users on Discord who were involved with violence at the rally. =Documentary Film= Unicorn Riot produced a feature- length documentary film about the resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline entitled Black Snake Killaz: A #NoDAPL Story. The film was premiered on November 17, 2017 at the Parkway theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and released online free of charge for educational purposes via Unicorn Riot's website on November 18, 2017. = Identity Evropa/American Identity Movement (IE/AIM) = In March 2019, Unicorn Riot leaked more than 770,000 Discord messages from Identity Evropa's (IE) national server called \\"Nice Respectable People Group\\" as well as that of Nicholas J. Fuentes' America First, James Allsup's The Nationalist Review, and the group's Slack server. The leaks revealed that Identity Evropa was attempting an campaign into the Republican Party such as one member meeting with Billy Ciancaglini (party candidate for the Mayor of Philadelphia), sympathizing with Representative Steve King of Iowa and others seeking to join College Republican clubs. Several members were doxxed, and the group was rebranded American Identity Movement (AIM), as part of a public relations effort to avoid scrutiny. = Ende Gel√§nde / Fridays For Future / Shutdown of brown coal infrastructure in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany = Unicorn Riot livestreamed the \\"Ende Gel√§nde\\" direct action protests in Germany, whose aim is to shut down brown coal fossil fuel infrastructure in North-Rhine Westphalia. EndeGel√§nde (roughly translated to \\"Here no further\\") achieved this by entering the brown coal pit mine and blocking the brown coal transport railroad track. = Killing of George Floyd = After the May 2020 killing of George Floyd, Unicorn Riot began doing a series of livestreams on Twitter and YouTube of the protest and uprising in Minneapolis and Saint Paul. Unicorn Riot has had a history of working in the Twin Cities and covering police brutality and other violence.

Harper's Magazine published ‚ÄúIf you want to discover what your grandchildren will think of as elegance of this postwar era, you will have to go to Cincinnati.‚Äù The building originally housed two department stores in a windowless lower block style portion of the building. The hotel portion rose above the stores in a very different style. A 5-star French restaurant with wall to wall windows sat above the hotel. The 8th floor plaza even hosted ice skating in the winter. Inside, the decor was accented with modern art (later removed and installed at the Cincinnati Art Museum), including a stunning abstract mural by Joan Mir√≥, another mural showing Cincinnati landmarks by Saul Steinberg and work by Alexander Calder. Above the stores on the first seven floors, the hotel lobby on the 8th floor was accessed via high speed elevators. The building includes 600,000 sq ft. of space. The hotel closed in 2008 but efforts to renovate it are planned. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

It is found in Mexico. Authority First described as Tropidonotus melanogaster by Peters in 1864, this species is now recognized as Thamnophis melanogaster. Geographic range It is found on the Central Mexican Plateau at elevations between 1,158 and 2,545 m above sea level. Description The dorsal color of these snakes may be brown, olive green, gray, red, orange, or pink. Ventral colors include the same as the dorsal, with the addition of yellow. Dorsal patterns may include stripes and there is typically a black stripe running down the center of the belly, which explains both the common and scientific names for this species. There is little or no difference in size between the sexes of Blackbelly garter snakes. Habitat This is a terrestrial species that occurs in temperate habitats. Although it lives on land, it has not been found more than 15 m from a body of water. Reproduction Blackbelly garter snakes are ovoviviparous. Diet These snakes feed exclusively under water and they are the only known Thamnophis to prey on soft-bodied crayfish. They have a highly variable diet that also includes fish, frogs, tadpoles, leeches, and earthworms. Good underwater vision and chemical cues help the snakes find and capture their prey. Subspecies Four subspecies are known: * gray blackbelly garter snake, T. m. canescens Smith, 1942 * Chihuahuan blackbelly garter snake, T. m. chihuahuaensis Tanner, 1959 * lined blackbelly garter snake, T. m. linearis Smith, Nixon & Smith, 1950 * Mexican blackbelly garter snake, T. m. melanogaster (Wiegmann, 1830) Etymology The specific name melanogaster is composed of two Greek words, melanos, which means black and gaster, which means belly.

After graduating from Yale, Abbott worked with Richard Rogers and Norman Foster at TEAM 4 in London, then worked in the office of I.M. Pei in New York City before founding his own practice in Sarasota, Florida, in 1966. In his own practice, Abbott's first design was the Weld Beach House in Boca Grande.

He is a former deputy communication minister and deputy tourism minister. In 1992, he founded the Every Ghanaian Living Everywhere (EGLE) party. As a lawyer, he has worked in New York City as the CEO of Parking Ticket Busters, a ticket-broker business, as an attorney at Amofah Law Firm and as a one-time administrative law judge at the city's Parking Violations Bureau. In 2017, Amofah was reported to have illegally altered documents in his various parking ticket cases by utilising knowledge from his former judge position, cheating the city out of over $100,000 in fines. Politics Amofah studied law in America and was involved in Ghana's politics, serving as a Deputy of Tourism under President Jerry Rawlings. In 2000, he had an argument with Rawlings over failing to choosing Obed Asamoah as a running mate. Asamoah was rumored to have taken money from the National Democratic Congress (NDC) so that Amofah could have a position in the government. During the confrontation, Amofah allegedly slammed the door on Rawlings' fingers, injuring him. As a result, Amofah went into a self-imposed exile in the US, where he became a Magistrate Judge in Staten Island, New York.

When only twenty-one, he was made a commandant-general during the Easter Rising. He was then prominent in Irish and British socialist parties before fighting with the Irish Republican Army during the Irish Civil War. He was also a leader in Na Fianna √âireann. Early life Born in Dublin, McLoughlin was the second child of Patrick and Christina McLoughlin. He became interested in Irish nationalism, and joined both the Gaelic League and Fianna √âireann in 1910, and the Irish Republican Brotherhood soon after. Around this time, his father became an activist in the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, playing a part in the Dublin lock-out of 1913, which was an important influence on Se√°n.Charlie McGuire, \\"Se√°n McLoughlin ‚Äì the boy commandant of 1916\\", History Ireland, Vol.14, No.2 Easter Rising Late in 1913, McLoughlin joined the Irish Volunteers, siding with its anti-World War I faction, and serving in G company under Se√°n Heuston. Early in 1916, Heuston and McLoughlin both transferred to D company, and took part in the Easter Rising, occupying the Mendicity Institution. Over the next two days, McLoughlin repeatedly travelled between the Institution and General Post Office (GPO), updating the leadership on progress and obtaining supplies. However, on one trip, he was identified by civilians and nearly captured, instead finding refuge in the Four Courts and then finally returning to the GPO. Once there, James Connolly gave him command of thirty volunteers and a mission to occupy the offices of the Irish Independent, to maintain a watch on British troop movements and potentially bombard them, if they began an assault. The following day, McLoughlin returned to the GPO to check in. His sister, Mary McLoughlin, age 15, was stationed there as well, acting as a courier. He attempted to warn the O'Rahilly against moving out to Parnell Street, as he knew the area was occupied by British troops, but was too late to catch him. The O'Rahilly was killed, and McLoughlin assumed control in the GPO, with the agreement of the injured Connolly. He successfully evacuated 300 men to Moore Street, and this led Connolly and the other headquarters staff to award him the title of commandant-general and overall charge of the Volunteers' military operations, even though he was still only 21 years old. McLoughlin organised tunnelling through the walls of buildings in Moore Street, allowing the troops to distribute through a larger space and bringing them closer to the British barricades, without the British troops realising. He planned a break-out, hoping to surprise the British and win against them in hand-to-hand combat, but the commander-in-chief, Patrick Pearse decided that the risk of civilian casualties was too high, and instead surrendered. McLoughlin opposed this decision, but nonetheless arranged for the remaining troops to march to the agreed place of surrender in an orderly fashion. Following the surrender, McLoughlin expected to be sentenced to death, but a British captain removed his insignia, and the British regarded him as a minor figure, and he was simply interned, at Knutsford Gaol and then Frongoch internment camp. He was released in December, and returned to the Volunteers, organising the movement in Tipperary.Charlie McGuire, \\"Sean McLoughlin\\", Irish Democrat Communism McLoughlin also joined the Socialist Party of Ireland (SPI), a broad labourist group with some sympathy for syndicalism. Within the group, he was a leading supporter of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution, and formed a communist faction with Roddy Connolly and other supporters, aiming to build links with the Socialist Labour Party (SLP) in Britain. This faction proved popular within the party, and McLoughlin was elected as president of the SPI in September 1919.Charlie McGuire, \\"An Irish Socialist in Britain: Sean McLoughlin and the British Socialist Movement, 1920‚Äì1922\\", Irish Studies Review, vol.16, no.2 In December 1919, McLoughlin resigned his positions in the SPI to travel to Scotland. There, he undertook a speaking tour on behalf of the newly formed \\"Irish Labour Party (Glasgow)\\", a group unconnected with the Irish Labour Party based in Ireland. He attracted many new supporters to the party, but fell out with its leadership after they supported John McLaren Biggar, the Labour Party candidate, in the 1920 Paisley by-election. McLoughlin's opposition to Biggar won over the majority of the party's membership, and he was elected as its president in February 1920, but attracted the enmity of party leader William Drew, and instead decided to take his supporters into a new group, the Irish Workers' Republic Party. This soon disappeared, but he began to speak for the SLP, also writing extensively for its newspaper, The Socialist. McLoughlin returned to Ireland in May 1920, recuperating from breathing problems. In his absence, the SPI had ceased to function, and he founded a new Irish Communist Labour Party, becoming its chairman. He hoped that the new party could affiliate to the Comintern. After a short return to Scotland to complete some planned public speeches, he spent several more months in Dublin, trying to build the Communist Labour Party, while still active in the Volunteers. In November, he began another speaking tour of Britain, starting in Sheffield, where he contacted local Irish emigrants and helped arrange the smuggling of arms to the Volunteers. He then toured around Scotland, speaking again on behalf of the SLP. He remained loyal to the SLP, joining the party even though many of its leading members formed the Communist Unity Group and then joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. However, this came to a sudden end in September, when he was expelled for reasons which were never publicly stated, but are believed to revolve around unfounded suspicions that he was a police agent.Ian Bullock, Romancing the Revolution: The Myth of Soviet Democracy and the British Left, p.254 He began speaking at unemployed workers' events and associated himself with the newly founded Communist Party of Ireland (CPI), which was led by his old comrade Roddy Connolly. Irish Civil War McLoughlin was in Britain during the War of Independence, but returned to Ireland in 1922. In line with the CPI's strategy, he joined the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to fight on the anti-treaty side in the Civil War, and was given command of a column in County Cork. He was captured in December, and sentenced to death, but he was not executed and, indeed, was released in October 1923. He initially returned to work with the CPI, but this soon disbanded. McLoughlin then began working with Jim Larkin, but disapproved of Larkin's handling of an unsuccessful railway strike and decided to relocate to England. Later life In 1924, McLoughlin moved to Hartlepool and continued speaking on communist themes, working with other former members of the SLP. He was imprisoned during the UK General Strike, but thereafter seems to have moved away from political activity. He moved to Sheffield, where he raised a family and worked for the city council through increasingly poor health. Commemoration On 3 May 2017 a plaque was unveiled at his home in Dublin City.

These viruses are positive-sense single- stranded RNA viruses that infect plant cells, in which RNA silencing forms a widespread and robust antiviral defense system. The p19 protein serves as a counter-defense strategy, specifically binding the 19- to 21-nucleotide double-stranded RNAs that function as small interfering RNA (siRNA) in the RNA silencing system. By sequestering siRNA, p19 suppresses RNA silencing and promotes viral proliferation. The p19 protein is considered a significant virulence factor and a component of an evolutionary arms race between plants and their pathogens.  Structure  The structure of the tomato bushy stunt virus p19 protein bound to double-stranded RNA. The two p19 monomers are shown in blue and green; the RNA backbone is shown in orange. The alpha helices at the top and bottom interact with the ends of the RNA, ensuring that only RNA of the correct length is bound. This has been described as a \\"molecular caliper\\". From . The p19 protein received its name from its size, being approximately 19 kilodaltons. It forms a functional homodimer. The crystal structures are available of p19 proteins from the tomato bushy stunt virus and Carnation Italian ringspot virus; the protein consists of a novel protein fold and exemplifies a previously unknown mechanism for binding RNA, using a binding surface formed by a beta sheet and flanked by alpha helices to interact with double-stranded RNAs of around 21 nucleotides in length in a non-sequence-specific manner.  Function  The p19 protein binds to double- stranded RNAs that function as short interfering RNA (siRNA) and is specialized for the 21-nucleotide product of the enzyme DCL4 (a member of a family of plant enzymes with homology to Dicer). By binding to siRNA, p19 sequesters these species and prevents them from interacting with the RNA- induced silencing complex (RISC), a protein complex that mediates the antiviral RNA silencing mechanism in the cell. The p19 protein is also capable of binding to microRNA molecules that are endogenous to the host cell, as well as the siRNAs that are ultimately derived from the virus's own genome. Notably, an exception to this pattern is p19's inefficiency in interacting with the microRNA miR-168, a regulatory non-coding RNA that represses expression of argonaute-1 (AGO1). The AGO1 protein is required for RNA silencing, thus selectively sparing its repressor from p19's general sequestration of miRNA has the effect of reducing cellular AGO1 levels and is an additional mechanism by which p19 inhibits silencing. The two mechanisms are independent of one another and can be selectively abrogated by mutations. Evolution The gene encoding the p19 protein is an example of an overprinted gene, a genomic arrangement common in viruses in which multiple genes are encoded by the same portion of the genome read in alternate reading frames. The open reading frame ORF4, which encodes p19, is completely contained within the open reading frame of another gene, which is designated ORF3 and encodes the movement protein p22. Both genes, and their relative positions, are conserved within the tombusvirus family. P19 is thought to have originated de novo in this lineage. Sequestration of dsRNA is a common viral counter-defense strategy against RNA silencing, evolved in a form of evolutionary arms race between virus and host. The p19 protein is not unique in this role; in an example of convergent evolution, this strategy appears to have evolved at least three times in distinct viral lineages using proteins with distinct structures and physical means of binding RNA. History The tomato bushy stunt virus, which is the type species of the tombusvirus family, is a long-standing model system for the study of plant viruses. The open reading frame encoding p19 was originally discovered in the late 1980s when the virus's genome was sequenced; it was subsequently demonstrated that the predicted protein was indeed expressed from the gene, although its role in promoting virulence and infectivity was initially underappreciated. Following the elucidation of its role as a suppressor of RNA silencing, p19 has also been used as a tool in molecular biology research on RNA silencing, RNA interference, and related processes.

Openet Telecom, Inc., 841 F.3d 1288 (Fed. Cir. 2016), is a court case in the United States Federal Court System that ended with a panel decision by the Federal Circuit to uphold the patent eligibility of four patents on a system designed to solve an accounting and billing problem faced by network service providers. The district court had held the patents invalid because they were directed to an abstract idea. In the Federal Circuit panel's view the patents were eligible because they contained an \\"inventive concept\\"‚Äîa combination of elements that was sufficient to ensure that the patents amounted to significantly more than a patent on the ineligible concept itself. This is one of the few times since the Supreme Court's Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International decision, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014). that the Federal Circuit has held computer software-based patent claims eligible.Joseph Saphia and Bonnie L. Gaudette, Narrowly Drawn Software-Based Patent Claims Directed To Specific, Unconventional Technological Solutions Are Patent-Eligible Under Alice , (Nov. 14, 2016). Other holdings of patent eligibility were McRO, Inc. v. Bandai Namco Games America Inc., 837 F.3d 1299 (Fed. Cir. 2016); BASCOM Global Internet Servs. v. AT&T; Mobility LLC, 827 F.3d 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2016); Enfish, LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 822 F.3d 1327 (Fed. Cir. 2016); and See Amdocs, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *20‚Äì24 and n.7. Background Amdocs held four patents and sued Openet for infringement. Each patent describes the same system, one that allows network service providers to account for and bill for internet protocol (\\"IP\\") network communications. The system includes network devices; information source modules (\\"ISMs\\"); so-called gatherers; a central event manager (\\"CEM\\"); a central database; a user interface server; and terminals or \\"clients.\\"Amdocs (Isr.) Ltd. v. Openet Telecom, Inc., No. 2015-1180, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *3 (Fed. Cir. Nov. 1, 2016). The patent specification asserts that the invention arrays the components of the system \\"in a distributed architecture that minimizes the impact on network and system resources,\\" which is accomplished \\"by collecting and processing data close to its source.\\" That result is the effect of including \\"distributed data gathering, filtering, and enhancements that enable load distribution,\\" instead of performing those tasks centrally as prior art devices did, and thus \\"reducing congestion in network bottlenecks, while still allowing data to be accessible from a central location.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *4‚Äì*5. More specifically, the suit involved four related patents‚ÄîU.S. Patents Nos. 7,631,065 (the '065 patent), 7,412,510 (the '510 patent), 6,947,984 (the '984 patent), and 6,836,797 (the '797 patent). The '065, '984, and '510 patents each stem from the same original patent application and specification; they concern accounting and billing for services in a computer network. The '797 patent developed from an augmented patent application and its specification states that it concerns \\"data records, and more particularly [] records reflecting various services afforded utilizing a network.\\" District court ruling The district court invalidated the patents on the pleadings, holding all four patents invalid under 35 U.S.C. ¬ß 101 because they claimed an abstract idea implemented in a non-inventive manner. The court said: > A person may have invented an entirely new and useful advance, but if the > patent claims sweep too broadly, or only claim the idea that was achieved > rather than implementation of the idea, ¬ß 101 directs that the patent is > invalid. Amdocs's asserted claims recite such conventional operation, in > such a general way, that even if the inventor had developed an actual > working system, the patent claims could foreclose fields of research beyond > the actual invention. Accordingly, all asserted claims are invalid as > patent-ineligible.Amdocs (Isr.) Ltd., 56 F. Supp. 3d at 825. The district court considered each patent separately. It found claim 1 of the '065 patent representative of the invention. That claim provides: > A computer program product embodied on a computer readable storage medium > for processing network account information comprising: :computer code for > receiving from a first source a first network accounting record; :computer > code for correlating the first network accounting record with accounting > information available from a second source; and :computer code for using the > accounting information with which the first network accounting record is > correlated to enhance the first network accounting record.56 F. Supp. 3d at > 819. The court found that claim 1 was directed to the abstract idea of \\"the concept of correlating two network accounting records to enhance the first record.\\" This satisfied step one of the Supreme Court's Alice methodology and therefore the district court proceeded to step two‚Äî\\"whether the claim adds enough to the abstract idea to make the claim patent eligible.\\" Because the claim did \\"not limit the correlation to any specific hardware, nor give any detail regarding how the records are 'correlated' or 'enhanced,' . . . the claim amounts to 'nothing significantly more than an instruction to apply the abstract idea' of correlating two network accounting records 'using some unspecified, generic' computer hardware.\\" That made the claim invalid under the Alice test.56 F. Supp. 3d at 820 (quoting Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int'l, 573 U.S. , 134 S. Ct. 2347, 2360 (2014)). The court turned to the '510 patent, whose claim 16 was representative: > A computer program product stored in a computer readable medium for > reporting on a collection of network usage information from a plurality of > network devices, comprising: :computer code for collecting network > communications usage information in real-time from a plurality of network > devices at a plurality of layers; :computer code for filtering and > aggregating the network communications usage information; :computer code for > completing a plurality of data records from the filtered and aggregated > network communications usage information, the plurality of data records > corresponding to network usage by a plurality of users; :computer code for > storing the plurality of data records in a database; :computer code for > submitting queries to the database utilizing predetermined reports for > retrieving information on the collection of the network usage information > from the network devices; and :computer code for outputting a report based > on the queries; ::wherein resource consumption queries are submitted to the > database utilizing the reports for retrieving information on resource > consumption in a network; and ::wherein a resource consumption report is > outputted based on the resource consumption queries.56 F. Supp. 3d at 822. The court held this patent \\"directed to the abstract idea of using a database to compile and report on network usage information.\\" Proceeding, therefore, to step two of the Alice methodology, the court said that the claim describes a generic computer that \\"collects, filters, aggregates, and completes network communications information\\" and then \\"stores the information in a database, and queries the database to retrieve reports.\\" All of these things were \\"basic functions\\" of a computer and a database system. The court held, accordingly: > [C]laim 16 is directed to a computer functioning in a conventional way, and > a database functioning in a conventional way. The claim does not add any > specific implementation beyond the abstract idea that information is > collected and stored, and reports are generated. Therefore, the claim is > directed to an unpatentable abstract idea.56 F. Supp. 3d at 823. The district court next considered representative claim 1 of the '797 patent, which states: > A method for generating a single record reflecting multiple services for > accounting purposes, comprising: :(a) identifying a plurality of services > carried out over a network; :(b) collecting data describing the plurality of > services; and :(c) generating a single record including the collected data, > wherein the single record represents each of the plurality of services; > ::wherein the services include at least two services selected from a group > consisting of a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) session, an electronic > mail session, a multimedia streaming session, a voice over Internet Protocol > (IP) session, a data communication session, an instant messaging session, a > peer-to-peer network application session, a file transfer protocol (FTP) > session, and a telnet session; ::wherein the data is collected utilizing an > enhancement procedure defined utilizing a graphical user interface by: > :::listing a plurality of available functions to be applied in real-time > prior to end-user reporting; :::allowing a user to choose at least one of a > plurality of fields, and :::allowing the user to choose at least one of the > listed functions to be applied to the chosen field in real-time prior to > end-user reporting. The court said that \\"the abstract idea in this claim is to generate a single record reflecting multiple services,\\" and proceeded to step two of the Alice analysis. It found that \\"the claim is directed to an abstract idea performed using purely conventional computer operations, and is, therefore, invalid under ¬ß 101.\\"56 F. Supp. 3d at 824. Last, the district court considered representative claim 1 of the '984 patent: > A method for reporting on the collection of network usage information from a > plurality of network devices, comprising: :(a) collecting networks > communications usage information in real-time from a plurality of network > devices at a plurality of layers utilizing multiple gatherers each including > a plurality of information source modules each interfacing with one of the > network devices and capable of communicating using a protocol specific to > the network device coupled thereto, the network devices selected from the > group consisting of routers, switches, firewalls, authentication servers, > web hosts, proxy servers, netflow servers, databases, mail servers, RADIUS > servers, and domain name servers, the gatherers being positioned on a > segment of the network on which the network devices coupled thereto are > positioned for minimizing an impact of the gatherers on the network; :(b) > filtering and aggregating the network communications usage information; :(c) > completing a plurality of data records from the filtered and aggregated > network communications usage information, the plurality of data records > corresponding to network usage by a plurality of users; :(d) storing the > plurality of data records in a database; :(e) allowing the selection of one > of a plurality of reports for reporting purposes; :(f) submitting queries to > the database utilizing the selected reports for retrieving information on > the collection of the network usage information from the network devices; > and :(g) outputting a report based on the queries. Here, the abstract idea was \\"reporting on the collection of network usage information from a plurality of network devices.\\" All of the steps were conventional acts for both generic computers and generic databases, making the claim invalid.56 F. Supp. 3d at 825. Federal Circuit panel decision =Majority opinion= The Federal Circuit panel majority reversed the district court judgment. It analyzed the judgment by assuming that the claims were directed to an abstract idea, but it found that the claims satisfied step two of the Alice methodology. The court found it particularly important, indeed crucial, that the components (such as network devices; information source modules; gatherers; a central event manager; a central database; a user interface server; and terminals) of the system: > are arrayed in a distributed architecture that minimizes the impact on > network and system resources. Through this distributed architecture, the > system minimizes network impact by collecting and processing data close to > its source. The system includes distributed data gathering, filtering, and > enhancements that enable load distribution. This allows data to reside close > to the information sources, thereby reducing congestion in network > bottlenecks, while still allowing data to be accessible from a central > location. Each patent [specification] explains that this is an advantage > over prior art systems that stored information in one location, which made > it difficult to keep up with massive record flows from the network devices > and which required huge databases.2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *4-5. The court recognized that step one under the Alice methodology is determining whether the claim is directed to an abstract idea, but found doing that problematic: > However, a search for a single test or definition in the decided cases > concerning ¬ß 101 from this court, and indeed from the Supreme Court, reveals > that at present there is no such single, succinct, usable definition or > test. The problem with articulating a single, universal definition of > \\"abstract idea\\" is that it is difficult to fashion a workable definition to > be applied to as-yet-unknown cases with as-yet-unknown inventions. That is > not for want of trying; to the extent the efforts so far have been > unsuccessful it is because they often end up using alternative but equally > abstract terms or are overly narrow.2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *11. Therefore, the court said, it would not try to formulate a definition but would instead review the prior cases and try to distill \\"what prior cases were about, and which way they were decided\\" in order to decide whether a particular claim was. \\"That is the classic common law methodology for creating law when a single governing definitional context is not available.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *11‚Äì12. After reviewing prior Federal Circuit decisions, the panel addressed the question of what abstract idea the claims embodied: > What relative level of abstraction should we employ? From a macroscopic > perspective, claim 1 could be described as focusing on correlating two > network accounting records to enhance the first record. Claim 1 could also > be described in several other ways‚Äîsuch as focusing on a computer program > that includes computer code for receiving initial information, for > correlating that initial information with additional information, and for > using that additional information to enhance the initial information.2016 > U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *25-26. Without answering the question it asked itself, the panel majority concluded that the claims in this case were closer to those in cases upholding validity under ¬ß 101 than those in cases denying validity. The court then decided to bypass the Alice step one (is the claim directed to an abstract idea) and go directly to step two (is there an inventive concept added to the abstract idea). It concluded: \\"Indeed, even if we were to agree that claim 1 is directed to an ineligible abstract idea under step one, the claim is eligible under step two because it contains a sufficient 'inventive concept,' [because it] requires 'computer code for using the accounting information with which the first network accounting record is correlated to enhance the first network accounting record.' \\" The court reached this conclusion because it had construed the term \\"enhance\\" in the claims as meaning \\"being dependent upon the invention's distributed architecture,\\" or as meaning \\"to apply a number of field enhancements in a distributed fashion.\\" The concept of distribution meant that \\"the network usage records are processed close to their sources before being transmitted to a centralized manager,\\" which makes the database system work faster and more efficiently. The panel majority found that way to improve functionality to be an \\"inventive concept.\\" According to the patent specification \\"this distributed enhancement was a critical advancement over the prior art.\\" 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *26-27. Therefore, the panel majority said, \\"this claim entails an unconventional technological solution (enhancing data in a distributed fashion) to a technological problem (massive record flows which previously required massive databases).\\" Even though the claims use generic components, \\"the claim's enhancing limitation necessarily requires that these generic components operate in an unconventional manner to achieve an improvement in computer functionality.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *28. Accordingly, the panel majority reversed the district court judgment of patent ineligibility under ¬ß 101 for the '065 patent.2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *30. The court then similarly analyzed the other patents, and held them \\"eligible for patenting for reasons similar to those that undergirded the eligibility of the '065 patent claims.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *34, *37, *40, and *44. In summarizing its ruling and responding to the dissent, the panel majority said that \\"[f]or argument's sake we accepted the district court's view of the disqualifying abstract ideas, and in each instance we then explained why, in our view, the claims seen in their entirety are not disqualified. The Alice/Mayo framework does not require more.\\" The panel majority said that it and the dissent were in agreement that the specification disclosed a patent-eligible system. \\"Unlike the dissent, however, we find the claims at issue, understood in light of that written description [specification], to be eligible for patenting.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *44-*45. =Dissenting opinion= Judge Reyna filed a dissent. Preliminarily, he objected to the panel majority's failure to make a full inquiry into the determination of what the abstract idea was (the panel majority said, however, in answer to this charge that it was assuming, arguendo, that the district court's identification of the abstract idea was correct). Reyna said the Alice methodology of the Supreme Court requires a specific determination of what the abstract idea is, quoting the statement in Alice‚Äî\\"First, we determine whether the claims at issue are directed to one of those patent-ineligible concepts.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at 46 (quoting Alice, 134 S. Ct. at 2355). Reyna then turned to the more important aspect of his critique‚Äîthat the panel majority had imported the limitations of the specification into the claims to find patent eligibility: > The majority also relies on the specification to import innovative > limitations into the claims at issue. For each of the four patents at issue, > the majority's eligibility determination rests on the use of a \\"distribution > architecture.\\" As explained below, however, this limitation is insufficient > to satisfy Alice step two. Indeed, that limitation does not exist in all of > the claims at issue. This contravenes the fundamental principal that the > section 101 inquiry is about whether the claims are directed to a patent- > eligible invention, not whether the specification is so directed.2016 U.S. > App. LEXIS 19593, at *47. Reyna added: > Claims that fail to recite how a desired goal is accomplished do not recite > an inventive concept. For example, limitations on the context‚Äîas opposed to > the manner‚Äîof accomplishing a desired result is typically not inventive, > even if that context is novel. The Pythagorean Theorem cannot be made > eligible by confining its use to existing surveying techniques.2016 U.S. > App. LEXIS 19593, at *58 (citing ). Reyna emphasized that the proper \\"inquiry is not whether the specifications disclose a patent-eligible system, but whether the claims are directed to a patent ineligible concept.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *62. He then turned to a patent-by-patent analysis of the claims in suit. Claim 1 of the '065 patent, he said, merely \\"recites a software product embodied on a storage medium,\\" and \\"it provides no [meaningful] structural limitations of either the physical medium or the digital software,\\" since \\"[a]ll software products are stored on a physical storage medium.\\" Furthermore, \\"claim 1 discusses only very broad, high-level functionality rather than details about how exactly that functionality is implemented.\\" Patent eligibility is predicated on combining data from two sources, but \\"I find no specific process for accomplishing the abstract goal of combining data from two sources.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *63‚Äì*64. Therefore, the claim is directed to an abstract idea and one must proceed to step two of the Alice methodology. \\"Turning to step two, I see no limitations confining the claim to a particular means of combining information from different sources.\\" Merely \\"[l]imiting the abstract idea to the context in which the information relates to network accounting records is a field-of-use limitation that [under Flook] does not supply an inventive concept.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *65. Relying on the definition of \\"enhanced\\" as meaning \\"distributed\\" to confer patent eligibility, as the panel majority and Amdocs do, is incorret because \\"claim 1 recites no components or structure over which the work might be 'distributed.' \\" Reyna therefore concluded, \\" I agree with the district court that claim 1 is ineligible because it fails to recite any structure or process limiting the claim to a particular means of combining accounting data from different sources.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *66. Reyna similarly analyzed the other patents. He found some claims patent ineligible because they merely claimed results or functions without describing how to accomplish them by using an inventive concept. Other claims, however, he found patent eligible because they not only described functions or goals, but they also recited specific steps or machinery to accomplish them. In this connection, he argued that \\"software structure and process can confer eligibility,\\" so that \\"the district court erred by dismissing the recited components on the sole basis that they are software without considering whether these architectural aspects are inventive structure or process.\\"2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 19593, at *77. Commentary ‚óè Dennis Crouch, in Patently-O, did not \\"know how important Amdocs will be, but it offers an interesting split decision on the eligibility of software patent claims.\\" His initial \\"takeaway\\" was‚Äî > that the Federal Circuit continues to be divided on the issues. By luck-of- > the-panel in this case, the minority on the court as a whole were the > majority on the panel (pushing against Alice & Mayo). Going forward, the > split can be reconciled by another Supreme Court opinion, a forceful Federal > Circuit en banc decision, or perhaps by future judicial appointments by > President Trump. I expect 2-3 vacancies on the court during Trump's first > term. Crouch pointed out that representative claim 1 of the first patent \\"is an almost pure software claim ‚Äî requiring computer code embodied on a computer readable storage medium.\\" Therefore, that the panel majority said that the claims are \\"much closer\\" to the ones found eligible than those of the many cases finding ineligibility should be translated as \\"the judges in the [panel] majority prefer the decisions finding eligibility over those invalidating software patent claims.\\" He pointed out that the majority's focus on the system's \\"enhancing data in a distributed fashion [being] an unconventional technological solution . . . to a technological problem (massive record flows which previously required massive databases)\\" ignores the fact that the claim is not for a system but for software used to implement the system, and the software itself does not require the distribution of components that the specification describes. He then quotes Judge Reyna's dissent that says, \\"But the inquiry is not whether the specifications disclose a patent-eligible system, but whether the claims are directed to a patent ineligible concept.\\"Dennis Crouch, Federal Circuit's Internal Debate of Eligibility Continues, (Nov. 13, 2016). ‚óè The Patent Docs blog said the decision underlines the importance of claim construction. \\"A favorable claim construction can tip the patent-eligibility analysis in favor of the patentee, while an unfavorable ruling can doom the subject claims to abstract idea perdition.\\" But the author, while hopeful of \\"a respite of sorts,\\" was unsure that \\"the ¬ß 101 fog\\" confronting patentees would now clear away, because \\"we are still only one en banc Federal Circuit decision or Supreme Court case away from going back to that murky landscape.\\"Michael Borella, Amdocs (Israel) Limited v. Openet Telecom, Inc. (Fed. Cir. 2016), (Nov, 27, 2016). ‚óè One comment on the case expressed a hope for a change in the direction of post‚ÄìAlice Federal Circuit decisions, which had overwhelmingly found software and business-method patents invalid: \\"Perhaps the initial stages of a patent- eligible trend for narrowly drawn software-based patent claims, that are directed to specific, unconventional technological solutions, are underway.\\"Joseph Saphia and Bonnie L. Gaudette, Narrowly Drawn Software-Based Patent Claims Directed To Specific, Unconventional Technological Solutions Are Patent-Eligible Under Alice , (Nov. 14, 2016). ‚óè Another comment lauded the opinion because it was favorable to \\"companies operating in the software space and who seek to obtain protection for their valuable software innovations.\\" The author argued that the opinion \\"serves to dispel the myth that it is not possible to obtain patent protection for software-based inventions.\\" Daniel L.

There are several tapeworms that are found to infect the Artemia spp.; however, F. liguloides is the most prevalent species of infectious tapeworm among the Artemia spp. F. liguloides infects brine shrimp (Artemia) as the intermediate host and flamingos as the definitive host. Effects of the tapeworm in flamingos is unclear, though researchers hypothesize that a high parasitemia could potentially be deadly to the host. The parasite appears to affect the Artemia spp. as it alters the behavior and color of its host. Life cycle Artemia spp. can reproduce both sexually and asexually. The life cycle of F. liguloides begins by Artemia ingesting the cestode larva, called oncosphere. It then penetrates the intestinal wall into the hemocoel where it becomes a cysticercoid, or larva with a scolex. The larva reaches maturity in the digestive tract of the flamingo (definitive host). Adult parasites produce eggs, which are released in the feces and into the environment.  Epidemiology  A survey conducted at four sites in southern Spain found the total prevalence of cestode ranging from 45-89% in Artemia with 45-77% being infected with Flamingolepis liguloides. High prevalence of F. liguloides can be observed throughout the year in southern Spain. However, this is not the case for all areas. In French saltpans the prevalence of F. liguloides in Artemia spp. populations is much lower in the months of April to October, having a prevalence of around 4.25%. Artemia in saltpans outside the range of flamingos such as the Bulgarian Black Sea coast has a prevalence of almost zero. Typically host density is indicative of parasitic presence. However, the survey acknowledged that environmental factors are also associated with parasitic presence. Specifically predicting that: temporal variation might structure the cestode community, the most common cestode species in brine shrimp would be those that used the most common bird species as final hosts and that temporal variation in Artemia would track changes in abundance of their final host. Seasonal patterns of infection of F. liguloides showed to have the highest prevalence in June and the lowest in December. Although the waterbird biomass was correlated to strong seasonal patterns, the actual transmission from birds or the removal of infected shrimp showed no significant effect. There was also no clear relationship between cestode and final host abundances. The gender of A. salina did not significantly hinder infection rates of F. liguloides. Showing that seasonal patterns seem to play a big factor in F. liguloides prevalence, whereas other environmental factors may not play as big a role. Anatomy and Morphology Anatomy of Flamingolepis ligulepis begins with an oval cyst formation. Within this structure, the organism's myriad of calcium corpuscles provide the parasite with a rigid enclosed space for occupation within the host environment such as occupation within erythrocytes. The typical scolex of F. liguloides is nearly 3x that of its close relative, flamingolepis flamingo, allowing for more room to hold suckers and hooks. A feature often used to distinguish F. ligulepis is the presence of 8 skrjabinnoid hooks. Each of these hooks are characteristically 180-190 Œºm in length. When visualizing the body plan of the parasite, the hooks and blades are localized on the posterior end. The rostellar suckers of the F. liguloides are oval shaped, with small hooks surrounding the perimeter. The rostellar hooks act as blades that aid in parasitic attachment. Behavioral manipulation When infected, the larva changes the color of the shrimp from transparent to red, making them more susceptible to avian predators. Parasitic castration is also observed in the Artemia spp.Parasite of the Day In a study conducted by Rode and Lievens, two species of Artemia that are found to congregate in swarms have coinfections of two microsporidian fungi and the F. liguloides tapeworm. Observing this unusual behavior, they hypothesize that the shrimps are being manipulated by the parasite which makes them easier to spot by flamingos, which are the parasite's definitive host. Each shrimp is one centimeter in length, but when gathered, the swarms can stretch up to two meters. Using the Artemia‚Äôs characteristic of high salinity tolerance, the swarms are formed in water that is too salty to be habitable for fish. Rode and Lievens also hypothesize that the parasitic infection increases the shrimps‚Äô lifespan, time spent at the water surface, and that the castration is to prevent the shrimps from spending time with sexual reproduction. These behaviors would contribute to increasing the chance for the infected Artemia to be consumed by flamingos.

The shock was reported to be at a depth of 13 km, categorized as a strong, shallow earthquake. The epicentre was located near the village of Reuleut in Pidie Jaya Regency, southeast of the province's capital, Banda Aceh. 104 people died in the quake, with at least 1,000 people injured. It was the deadliest earthquake in Aceh since the 2005 Nias‚ÄìSimeulue earthquake and the deadliest in Sumatra since the 2010 Mentawai earthquake and tsunami. Earthquake The earthquake struck at 05:03 a.m while many people were still sleeping or preparing for morning prayer. Hundreds of people panicked and ran through the streets as the earthquake struck, with eyewitnesses stating that most people were crying and screaming as their memories of the massive earthquake in 2004 were triggered. Many stated that the shaking was similar to the 2004 quake. Hundreds of people evacuated to higher ground, fearing that a tsunami would occur. Even though the earthquake was categorized as a shallow earthquake, the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics stated that there was no potential for a tsunami to occur. The shaking was strongly felt in Pidie and Pidie Jaya Regency and lasted for 10 ‚Äì 15 seconds. The quake could be felt within the entire Aceh region. The Deputy of Prevention and Alertness of the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management, Wisnu Widjaja, stated that the energy released by the quake was equivalent to that released in the 1945 nuclear bombing of Hiroshima. The Head of the Geology Office, Ego Syahrial, stated that Pidie Jaya Regency was included as one of the most earthquake-prone cities in Aceh and was in the red zone. Impact In the initial hours after the earthquake, structures across Aceh were reported to have been severely damaged. The dome of the Samalanga Mosque, Pidie's central mosque, had collapsed. Massive power outages occurred throughout Pidie and Pidie Jaya as telephone poles and electrical poles tumbled. Several houses collapsed during the quake. Roads were also damaged. Preliminary data suggest that 14 structures had collapsed during the quake, including a minimarket in Pidie. Photos of destroyed houses and buildings were circulated on social media. Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management later [stated that] \\"many structures\\" were damaged, of which 25 suffered heavy damage. Detailed information revealed that 72 stores had collapsed, 15 houses had been destroyed, 1 mall had collapsed, 5 mosques appeared destroyed and an Islamic school also had collapsed. It was reported that dozens of Islamic students were trapped under an Islamic School in Bireun Regency. Later reports revealed that 249 structures had been damaged in the quake, including 14 mosques and a hospital. The Indonesian National Disaster Management Board later confirmed that 686 structures were either destroyed or damaged. At least 108 aftershocks followed the main shock in Aceh, with the largest measuring 5.3 Mw occurring in the mid-morning hours of 11 December 2016 at a depth of 20 km. The magnitude of the earthquake was also revised by the Indonesian Agency for Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics from 6.4 Mw to 6.5 Mw. The regent of Pidie Jaya, Aiyub Abbas, stated that approximately 30% of the area of Pidie Jaya was severely affected by the quake and also stated that he will travel back to Pidie Jaya after his duty visit to Istana Negara. Search and rescue efforts Masjid Jami' Quba Pangwa in Kuta Pangwa village, Trienggadeng subdistrict, Pidi√´ Jaya Regency collapsed in the earthquake Emergency services were overwhelmed in the aftermath of the quake. At least 30 people, including some children, were admitted to the nearest hospital for bone fractures. Search and rescue teams were immediately assembled and deployed to the scene, including the Disaster Victims Identification team (DVI). Coordination centres were set up in the hardest-hit areas. The Indonesian Volcanology and Geologic Disaster Mitigation departments, and the Ministry of Energy and Human Resources were also sent to the disaster area. One person was reportedly killed due to falling debris. Further search and rescue operations discovered more deaths in Pidie Jaya. The Vice Regent of Pidie Jaya Regency, Said Mulyadi, stated that at least 18 people were killed in the quake, with dozens trapped under rubble. The number reportedly injured was increased to 500, while treatment of the injured was initially limited to the streets as treating patients indoors was prohibited for fear of aftershocks. As local hospitals were overwhelmed, more survivors were transported to other main hospitals, including Pidie Jaya Hospital (outdoor, as the indoor section were heavily damaged) and Chik Di Tiro Hospital. Severely injured people were transported by helicopters to Banda Aceh, the provincial capital.

The gang is named after a telephone prefix of Aldergrove, BC. Origins The 856 gang first emerged as a youth gang in Aldergrove, BC. They were notorious for physical assault, disruption and vandalism. The RCMP denounced them as a group of 'punks' to the media at first sight. Until September, 2007, they had made ties to a man named Len Pelletier of the Hells Angels, who claimed to have relation to one member. During that year, Len's vehicle was shot and the 856 were all under suspicion by law enforcement. About 8 core members were put under police supervision by Officer Richard Konarski, an inspector for the Langley RCMP. A profile was constructed of the 856, focusing on six friends and family members between the ages of 15 and 18‚Äîall of which were arrested that same year. Some went to jail, others transferred to separate schools. Konarski and many others, including their former principal, believed that was the end of the 856. Later, the gang was rediscovered, now with weapons, drug connections and a more sophisticated criminal organization. History Jason Francis Wallace was charged with attempted murder, in a 2008 stabbing that occurred at a Grad Party. In 2013, the gang was rediscovered by the RCMP in Yellowknife and Alberta, dealing multimillions of dollars worth of cocaine, firearms and cash. Six search warrants were placed on their property. In early 2014, 12 individuals were charged for dealing drugs for the 856 gang. By July 2014, $400,000 worth of drugs were seized from the gang in an apartment building located on the 4600-block of 236th Street in Langley. In August 2014, the gang was targeted by Project Gloom, and had been found to send another crew to sell cocaine and collect drug debts left behind by the previous gang members. This had led to an April 2015, drive-by shooting. Two of the gangsters were arrested for attempting to murder one of their own. Following such, the gang sent yet another group of replacements north, which ended in 23 suspects arrested due to two search warrants placed in July 2015. Several loaded firearms, cash, cocaine, MDMA and heroin were seized from the gang in Whitehorse. An 856 gang member, was later charged in the murder of Bob Green, a long time Hells Angels gang member in 2016, while another member was caught with 126 grams of crack cocaine and two digital scales in his suitcase. RCMP also found cash, marijuana and ecstasy pills in his apartment in Yellowknife. Later, RCMP had raided a townhouse in Whitehorse and found handguns, rifles, rocks of cocaine (enough for up to 90 individual sales), ecstasy, $20,000 in cash, ammunition, and black T-shirts emblazoned with \\"856\\" in white lettering. In 2017, Jason Francis Wallace, pleaded guilty to manslaughter of Hell's Angel Bob Green. He was sentenced to six years in jail. 856 associate, Shaun Clary's body was dismembered as a result of retaliation of Bob's murder. Today, the gang is thought to be rivals of the Hells Angels who were formerly in alliance with them.

Identilock is a gun attachment that covers and prevents access to the trigger, which makes it different from other trigger locks. Identilock is clamped to the handle of the gun. It is locked and unlocked with a fingerprint, a biometric scanner that stores up to three fingerprints. History Kiyani is a mechanical engineer. He spent the majority of his career working at Bosch. He was shot when he was 16. An unknown gunman fired at Kiyani and his friends one night and the bullet pierced his left cheek. Kiyani is an avid gun owner who believes in common sense gun ownership. The stated motivation behind Identilock is to provide a safer and more secure way to keep a gun around family. Teen suicides and accidental shootings are a growing problem. Kiyani decided to focus on his own solution. Kiyani claims to have created Identilock to curb gun violence in America. On his website he is quoted as wanting to bring Michigan's heritage of innovation, ingenuity and tradition to develop the world's most advanced firearm safety device. Kiyani has receivied help from TechTown, a non-profit organization that provides a basic foundation for new and growing companies.  Technical overview  =Design= Identilock is an engineered trigger lock that is designed to reveal the trigger in less than half a second. It completely covers and prevents access to the trigger until activated by an authorized fingerprint, allowing access to the firearm. It is made of a high end impact resistant polymer, which weighs less than 12 oz. It is about the size of a wallet. Identilock can be categorized as a bio-metric technology or as a gun safety technology, but is not properly included as a smart gun technology because it does not change the operation of a gun. According to Kiyani, Identilock was designed to thwart teenage suicides and prevent accidental shootings. =Biometric scanner= According to the website, Identilock uses fingerprint recognition technology that can store three fingerprints. It can read a stored fingerprint in 360 degrees of rotation. Identilock exposes the trigger when an authorized fingerprint is scanned. =Battery and key= The device is equipped with a rechargeable lithium-ion battery. The battery is charged with any USB-C compatible charging outlet. The battery lasts up to 6 months in standby mode. Identilock can be unlocked with a physical key if necessary. The key can be used if there is an error with the fingerprint scanner or the battery is completely drained. = Gun application = Identilock works with many popular gun models such as Glock, Sig Sauer, Smith & Wesson and Colts, etc. Adapters for additional firearms are claimed to be under development. Wednesday, April 8, 2020 Advantages and disadvantages =Advantages= A US federal government study determined that 8 percent of unintentional gun- related deaths could have been prevented by a child safety lock. In 2015 nearly 2,000 accidental gun deaths in 2015 were reported. The Identilock attachment does not alter the guns operation in any way. It makes no changes to the gun itself. =Disadvantages= Identilock is not a replacement for standard gun safety procedures. All other gun safety procedures must still be followed. Identilock provides an extra safety feature. Identilock requires nearly half of one second to fall off of the gun. This may be too slow in some emergency applications. This product does not address the underlying causes of gun-related violence. If successful, it could reduce the attention paid to those causes. Awards * Best use of Technology at CES - Verge *Finalist in Accelerate Michigan * Finalist at TechCrunch battlefield * Smart Tech Foundation winner * Macomb innovation fund winner * Techtown labs award * Top 10 Tech companies to watch 2016 Financial overview Omer Kiyani founded and funded Identilock on his own for years. Identilock later received a $100thousand grant in 2016 at an unknown valuation from Macomb Community College. The Innovation Fund at Macomb Community College is funded by the $100 million J.P. Morgan Chase Innovation fund which has devoted $2.7 million to Detroit area companies and investments to promote area development.

The project has a $6 billion budget, and after beginning the first phases of construction in late 2016 is planned to be completed over the following 40 years. First phase The $700 million initial phase of construction began in 2016 with a groundbreaking on November 29 at the San Elijo Lagoon. The projects in this phase are scheduled to be completed by 2021. The state government is contributing $250 million to this project, mostly coming from the fuel tax levied by SB1, known as the Road Repair and Accountability Act. =Highway= Two new bridges are to be built on Interstate 5: one across the San Elijo Lagoon in Solana Beach and Encinitas, and one across the Batiquitos Lagoon in Carlsbad. Other road projects include added carpool lanes and sound barriers. The total cost of the highway portion of the first phase was budgeted for $480 million. The highway expansion faces opposition from environmentalists, who argue that \\"expanding the amount of space we dedicate to cars not only fails to speed up traffic but also accelerates the breakdown of ecosystems that support life on earth.\\" =Rail= Two segments of the major passenger rail line following the coast from San Diego north, used by Coaster commuter trains and Pacific Surfliner intercity trains, are to be double tracked. Work began initially on a segment of track between Cardiff-by-the-Sea and San Elijo Lagoon, including replacement of the railroad bridge over the lagoon. In mid-2017, work is scheduled to begin on a similar project near the Batiquitos Lagoon, including a bridge replacement and of new double track. These projects, as well as grade crossing work, are budgeted for $102 million. This railway line was originally known as the Surf Line built in the 1880s by the California Southern Railroad, which became part of the Santa Fe Railroad. It is currently part of the LOSSAN Corridor, which forms the route of the Pacific Surfliner. The upgrades to the North Coast Corridor are being done in conjunction with the extension of the San Diego Trolley's Blue Line to UCSD, which is known as the Mid-Coast Corridor. =Other transportation= $40 million is to be spent on bicycle path and pedestrian improvements, along with local community enhancements. =Environment= The San Elijo Lagoon will receive $80 million for restoration efforts, such as dredging and filling to bring sediment to natural levels, as well as additional conserved area to mitigate the impact of the new road and rail bridges. This work is scheduled to begin in 2017.

In 2014 she published her critically acclaimed memoir, The Iceberg. Early life Marion Coutts was born in Nigeria and raised in the United Kingdom. Her parents were Salvation Army ministers with whom she traveled extensively. The church they attended had a strong musical tradition that encouraged young girls to play brass instruments, and at age 10 Coutts started playing trumpet for a large Salvation Army band. Coutts' family lived in London and then Scotland where she stayed on to attend college, earning her BA in Fine Art at Edinburgh College of Art from 1982 to 1986. Music While attending college, Coutts joined an improvisational musical project called Volunteer Slavery. Named after an album by Rahsaan Roland Kirk, the group consisted of three men and three women who \\"mostly banged on things,\\" including guitars, oil drums, and other percussion. Coutts played trumpet and another woman played sax, and their first gig was a benefit in support of the UK miners' strike. The group persisted for a year-and-a-half without writing any formal songs, though a demo tape was recorded and has resurfaced on the internet. =Dog Faced Hermans= In 1986 three members of Volunteer Slavery wanted to continue on as a more serious band, and Coutts expressed interest in being their vocalist. They named themselves Dog Faced Hermans, after an obscure reference in a Frankenstein film, and began paring down their music into shorter, faster songs that still maintained some of Volunteer Slavery's experimental elements. In addition to writing and singing lyrics, Coutts played cowbell and added her trumpet, giving the group a distinctive sound. The Dog Faced Hermans toured the UK and released a few records until moving to Amsterdam in 1989. During this period, Coutts spent a year in Poland on a British Council Scholarship to attend the State School for the Arts in Wroclaw Poland. In 1990 she rejoined her band in the Netherlands, and the group went on to release four more albums. They toured Europe and North America before disbanding in 1995 with various members scattering into new projects around the globe. Coutts returned to the UK to concentrate on her art. =Other appearances= Coutts has also recorded on releases with Dutch musical groups The Ex, Instant Composers Pool, and Dull Schicksal; with British groups Spaceheads and the Honkies; with American group God is My Co-Pilot on their 1994 Peel Session, and with cellist Tom Cora. After a musical hiatus, she recorded on a couple of compilation tracks, but no musical output has been heard from her since 1998. Visual art Coutts is known for her non-linear film and video style, often juxtaposed with sculpture to create immersive installations, sometimes with elements that invite viewers to participate in the work. For 1999's Fresh Air, she built a set of three irregularly shaped ping-pong tables, which replicated maps of London's Battersea, Regent's, and Hyde Park, each bisected by a table tennis net. That same year Eclipse took a small garden greenhouse which was periodically filled with artificial fog, fittingly at London's Gasworks Gallery. 2000's Assembly superimposed film of flocking starlings onto a wooden lectern. In 2001's Decalogue, Coutts emblazoned a set of tenpins with each of the Ten Commandments. 2002's Cult beckoned onlookers to squeeze between a configuration of rectangular columns and peer into the eyes of a black cat looped in semi-stillness on nine video monitors. Artforum said that, \\"Cult evokes prehistoric standing stone circles as well as hieratic Egyptian cat sculpture-in ancient Egypt, the cat goddess Bastet was the patroness of family happiness.\\" First installed at London's Chisendale Gallery, the gallery describes the work: > The viewer first experiences the group from a distance, the monitor screens > providing the only source of light. Moving onto the platform and amongst the > screens, visitors are made aware that each cat is moving, but barely > perceptibly. From any position, only two or three of the cats' faces are > visible. Each cat goes through a cycle of opening and closing their eyes, of > waking and sleeping and each cycle remains dogmatically out of sync with its > neighbours. Coutts has enlisted Ex-Dog Faced Hermans guitarist Andy Moor to score many of her short films. Shot on super-8, her 2000 film Epic follows the adventures of a life-sized model horse as it's ceremonially carried through the city of Rome. 2002's No Evil Star, named for the second half of a well-known palindrome, shows closeups of live mealworms colonizing a clay city. Moor also scored Twenty Six Things, a film that Coutts comprised from artifacts collected by Henry Wellcome that she herself was never permitted to touch. Personal life and teaching In 1996 Coutts completed the London Arts Board/Institute of Education \\"Artists in Schools\\" Training Programme and received a City and Guilds Further and Adult Education Teacher's Certificate in 1997. From 1996 to 1999 she worked as a fine arts tutor and taught courses in portfolio preparation, after which she lived in Rome on a scholarship. In 1997 Coutts began a relationship with fellow artist Tom Lubbock who wrote for the arts section for the British newspaper The Independent. The two married in 2001 and lived in separate flats in the north and south of London. When their son Eugene was born in 2007, they settled in Brixton. In 2001 Coutts began tutoring and guest teaching at Goldsmiths University, taking up a permanent position there in 2007. Concurrently, she was a visiting tutor for the Sculpture, City and Guilds of London Art School in 2002 and 2003, a visiting lecturer and then research fellow at the Norwich School of Art and Design on and off from 2004 to 2009, and an associate lecturer at University of the Arts, London from 2005 to 2010. In 2008, her husband was diagnosed with a brain tumor that turned out to be glioblastoma multiforme. Told that he would have about two years to live, they moved into a hospice in 2010. He died of the cancer in 2011. Writing Before Lubbock's illness, Coutts regarded herself purely as a visual artist and not a writer. Feeling unable to create anything while her husband underwent treatment, she turned to writing. In 2009 after Lubbock's first brain surgery and rounds of chemotherapy, Coutts began to jot things down in a series of Word docs. Initially these fragments, or \\"little lenses\\" as Coutts calls them, were a reflexive practice, which she eventually joined into a chains of texts and realized as a larger work. In 2012 Coutts contributed the introduction to her husband's posthumously released memoir, Until Further Notice, I Am Alive. That same year she edited Lubbock's essay collection, The English Graphic. In 2014 Coutts published the book The Iceberg, a \\"poetic and searing memoir\\" about her husband's death. The memoir begins at the point of Lubbock's 2008 diagnosis and follows him, Coutts, and their son Eugene (called \\"Ev\\" in the book) up through his treatment and eventual death in 2011. The Los Angeles Times praised the book, saying, \\"'The plot of The Iceberg can be summed up in a sentence: A man gets sick and dies. Indeed, little else happens in artist turned author Marion Coutts' account of the final two years of her husband's life. Yet it is dazzling, devastating.\\" The Iceberg was shortlisted for several literary prizes, and Coutts was awarded the Wellcome Book Prize in 2015.

Incumbent Democrat James P. Coleman was term-limited, and could not run for reelection to a second term. As was common at the time, the Democratic candidate ran unopposed in the general election so therefore the Democratic primary was the real contest, and winning the primary was considered tantamount to election. Democratic primary After the Brown ruling about school desegregation and the 1957 Little Rock Crisis, the defense of segregation and white supremacy across the South became a paramount concern, and all candidates ran as segregationists. Ross Barnett, who already ran on 1951 and 1955, ran with the support of the Citizens' Councils, former Bilbo partisans and the covert help of Senator James Eastland as a \\"vigorous segregationist\\", as he told himself. Carroll Gartin ran in the continuity of Coleman. Sullivan was relatively more moderate on the race subject; he also ran on a promise to end prohibition. He received covert help from Eastland, who wanted to hamstrung Gartin. Robert Mason was a perennial candidate who ran on a white supremacy platform, promising to have money printed to fund Mississippi budget: \\"They‚Äôre turning out the money on those free presses. And that‚Äôs good. Let‚Äôem keep turning some of that free press money to Mississippi\\". He opposed he end of prohibition. He said he saved money so that, every two or three years, he could either travel or run for governor, adding that he did so on the suggestion of his wife. No candidate received a majority in the Democratic primary, which featured 4 contenders, so a runoff was held between the top two candidates.

Though officially classified as security police, they have law enforcement authority, under section 161k of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, while engaged in the performance of official duties. Officers are equipped and trained to respond to serious incidents at Department of Energy facilities by armed adversaries and to reacquire stolen nuclear material. The FPFs have been described, by the DOE, as \\"elite fighting forces\\" designed to operate in \\"combat environments\\". Background A Protective Forces member trains at the Savannah River Site in 2008. The Federal Protective Forces are responsible for defending Department of Energy sites at which Category I special material is stored. This generally includes uranium-235, uranium-233, and plutonium-239 in certain formulations. Under the provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, Protective Forces personnel have been granted limited arrest authority; they may make probable cause arrests while on-duty and for a specific series of federal crimes related to nuclear material and government property. The Federal Protective Forces are heavily-armed, which is reflective of the anticipated capabilities of an adversary likely to attempt an assault against a Category I material-holding site. The current hypothetical adversary against which Protective Forces prepare is described in a 2004 Design Basis Threat (DBT) issued by the Department of Energy. Though the DBT is classified, the hypothetical adversary has been generally described as a \\"larger\\" force that would seek to overrun the defenses of a DOE facility in order to capture Category I special material. Department of Energy studies have indicated that up to 50 percent of a Protective Forces detachment would be killed responding to some variations of the threat envisaged. The size of individual Protective Forces detachments ranged, in 2007, from between 233 and 533 personnel per protected site. Operations =Organization= A Protective Forces helicopter operating at the Savannah River Site in 2006. The Protective Forces are recruited and employed by private companies, yet are trained, equipped, and under the operational command of Defense Nuclear Security, a program of the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (two Protective Forces, those at the Savannah River Site and the Idaho National Laboratory, are under the control of the DOE's Office of Environmental Management). Each Department of Energy site housing a Protective Forces contingent contracts with a different company for manpower. Protective Forces are sited at eight Department of Energy facilities: * Hanford Site * Idaho National Laboratory * Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory * Los Alamos National Laboratory * Nevada Test Site * Pantex Plant * Savannah River Site * Y-12 National Security Complex =Equipment= Protective Forces employ a variety of weaponry including the SR-25 rifle, HK69 grenade launcher, and Mk 19 grenade launcher. In the mid-2000s, Protective Forces began to acquire and deploy M134 miniguns. These are mounted on the Lenco BearCat armored personnel carriers used by the Protective Forces, as well as static gun emplacements at Department of Energy facilities. Protective Forces operating from a Lenco BearCat at the Savannah River Site. Protective Forces are equipped with more than 80 Lenco BearCat armored personnel carriers system-wide, and also use the Polaris 500 ATV and a variety of soft-shelled vehicles. Prior to 2010, Protective Forces uniforms varied from site to site. That year, the NNSA adopted a mandatory, system-wide uniform. The NNSA estimated the standardized uniform would save the Department of Energy $500,000 over eight years due to bulk purchase savings, as well as \\"promote solidarity\\" among the disparate Protective Forces. =Training= The Protective Forces are trained at the Department of Energy's National Training Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with some specialized training occurring at the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The Department of Energy organizes 26-man Composite Adversary Teams (CAT) that probe Protective Forces-secured sites to identify weaknesses and test the preparedness of Protective Forces units in responding to an attack. CAT members are drawn from the regular Protective Forces for rotating, one-to-two week opposing force assignments overseen by a dedicated, 12-man training nucleus. Key issues =Incidents= Mid-2000s Pantex issues Protective Forces pictured at the Savannah River Site in 2008. In 2006 the Department of Energy Inspector General received complaints from inside the Pantex Plant that Protective Forces were not being issued the correct night-vision equipment to safely operate their Mk 19 grenade launchers, a complaint it later substantiated after an investigation, though the NNSA rejected the report's findings. The following year, 524 members of the Protective Forces detachment at Pantex, whose personnel were provided by BWX Technologies, went on strike in protest of the Department of Energy's decision to revise the pension and medical benefits it provided to contractors. During the 44-day strike, a 210-man replacement force, composed of supervisors and non-unionized personnel assigned to other Department of Energy sites, was assembled to secure Pantex. Both the National Council of Security Police, the union for Protective Forces personnel, and the Project on Government Oversight called for Pantex to be shut down during the dispute due to what was claimed to be a serious erosion of the security of nuclear weapons stored at the facility. The Department of Energy rejected claims that the security of nuclear material was compromised during the strike. Concerns about the safe operation of Mk 19 grenade launchers at night by the Protective Forces prompted an Inspector General investigation in 2006. Y-12 security breach In July 2012, three activists from Plowshares were able to briefly gain entry to the Y-12 National Security Complex. According to officials, the breach was the first time in the 70-year history of Y-12 that its perimeter had been successfully penetrated, shattering what had been described as an \\"aura of invincibility\\". Sixty days later the Department of Energy terminated the contract of WSI (formerly Wackenhut and later a subsidiary of G4S), which had provided Protective Forces to Y-12 for more than a decade. The contract for Protective Forces at Y-12 was subsequently awarded to National Strategic Protective Services, a joint venture of Securiguard and Triple Canopy. =Future concerns= Federalization The Natural Resources Defense Council has called for the Protective Forces to be fully federalized, arguing that a non-federalized force may have less willingness to \\"stay and fight\\" against a very committed adversary able to inflict heavy casualties. Representatives of Protective Forces personnel have also called for the forces to be federalized. Federalization has been opposed by the Department of Energy. The International Union of Security, Police, and Fire Professionals of America also oppose federalization, noting that a federalized force would no longer be able to participate in collective bargaining or other union activities. Risk to civilian populations Some have called for Category I material-holding sites located near populated areas to be moved to more remote regions due to the threat of heavy civilian deaths that could be incidentally inflicted by the Protective Forces while defending a site from attack. For instance, a neighborhood sits within the range of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory's M134 gun emplacements, creating the potential that \\"children at play, joggers and families working in their yards\\" could be subjected to heavy defensive shelling by Federal Protective Forces if an attack originated from their direction. Protective Forces personnel run an obstacle course while wearing CBRN masks at SPOTC 2012 in South Carolina. An NNSA study noted that the level of force and types of weaponry the Protective Forces would deploy in pursuit of an adversary which had seized nuclear material and moved it off-site may produce heavy \\"collateral non-combatant casualties\\" during a recapture operation. SPOTC Since 1972, the Department of Energy, and its predecessor agencies, have organized the annual Security Police Officer Training Competition (SPOTC), a tactical contest pitting nuclear security units against each other. In addition to the Federal Protective Forces, external teams have been invited from the U.S. armed forces. In 2001, the first international teams entered, with a contingent representing the United Kingdom's Atomic Energy Authority.

The Reds assigned Greene to the Billings Mustangs of the Rookie-level Pioneer League. He played as a pitcher and as a designated hitter on days he did not pitch. He made three pitching appearances for Billings, totaling innings pitched, and batted 7-for-30 (.233) as a designated hitter. In 2018, the Reds assigned Greene to the Dayton Dragons of the Class A Midwest League, where he appeared solely as a pitcher. He represented the Reds at the 2018 All-Star Futures Game. Greene spent all of 2018 with Dayton, compiling a 3‚Äì7 win-loss record with a 4.48 ERA in 18 starts. His season ended prematurely due to a sprained ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his pitching elbow. After suffering a setback in his rehabilitation in March 2019 that further damaged the UCL, Greene underwent Tommy John surgery, ending his 2019 season. Personal life Greene lives in Stevenson Ranch, California. His mother, Senta, works as an educational consultant. His father, Russell, played college football for Humboldt State University and is a private investigator. Russell worked for Johnnie Cochran and now owns his own firm in Hollywood. Hunter has two younger siblings: a sister, Libriti, and a brother, Ethan. Libriti was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of five, and went into remission four years later. In addition to baseball, Greene paints and plays the violin.

He served in the legislature of the Kingdom of Hawaii and the Republic of Hawaii and later in the Senate of the Territory of Hawaii. Life One of Kamauoha's first post was working as the deputy sheriff of North Kohala. He was removed in April 1884 on charges of malfeseance and was replaced with William P≈´nohu White.; ; From 1887, Kamauoha served as a member of the House of Representatives, the lower house of the Hawaiian legislature, for the island of Hawaii. He sat in during the special session of 1887 (November 3 to May 28) and the regular session of 1888 (from May 29 to September 11) during the reign of King KalƒÅkaua. In the election of 1892, Kamauoha ran and was elected as a National Liberal candidate against the Reform candidate J. Kahookano.; ; ; ; From May 28, 1892 to January 14, 1893, the legislature of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historian Albertine Loomis dubbed the \\"Longest Legislature\\". One subject of importance was the promulgation of a new constitution to replace the Bayonet Constitution of 1887. Representative Kamauoha was one of the legislators to present a petition from his constituents for a new constitution. Kamauoha joined his fellow members in ousting a number of the Queen Lili ªuokalani's cabinet ministers for want of confidence. During a debate to remove the George Norton Wilcox cabinet, Kamauoha noted, \\"the Cabinet were able and honest men. There was no doubt that they possessed the confidence of the community. They were men of integrity, who would be able to secure funds to carry on the Government. But would they carry out the wishes of the Queen? Would they do what the Queen and the Hawaiian people wanted in regard to the Lottery, the Constitutional Convention, etc. Would they do as the Queen wanted them to?\\" The monarchy was overthrown on January 17, 1893, and after a brief transition under Provisional Government the Republic of Hawaii was established on July 4, 1894. Despite his native ancestry and previous service under the deposed queen, Kamauoha became a legislator for the new regime. He was elected as a member of the House of Representatives for the Second District and served as the Vice Speaker of the Legislature of the Republic of Hawaii from 1895 to 1896. He was licensed to practice law in 1895.; Hawaii was annexed to the United States in 1898 via the Newlands Resolution. From July 31, 1899 to July 23, 1900, he worked in the Tax Appeal Court, 3rd Circuit. He became a member of the Senate of the Territory of Hawaii from 1917 to 1919. He ran as member of the Republican Party. Kamauoha died from a relapse of influenza, on April 11, 1920, at his home at Napo ªopo ªo, South Kona. His maternal granddaughter was kumu hula Iolani Luahine.

The pathogen is an ascomycete that belongs to the family Sclerotiniaceae in the order Helotiales. The lesions start out as whitish streaks and take on a yellow tinge as they mature. They cause yield losses up to 30%. This fungus is endemic to the USA and has also been reported in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Typical management of this disease includes chemical fungicides with significant efforts being made to establish a means of biological control. Host and symptoms This pathogen only affects onion, garlic and leek ‚Äì Allium spp. The first symptom of the disease occurs in the leaves 24‚Äì48 hours after initial exposure to the pathogen, appearing as long white lesions 1‚Äì5 mm in length surrounded by a greenish-white halo. The tissue then turns soft due to pectolytic enzymes produced by the pathogen and the center of the lesion takes on a straw-color. Complete blighting can be seen about 12 days after initial infection. Symptoms towards the later stages also include leaf tip dieback and necrosis. These necrotic spots are the sites of secondary conidial production. Botrytis squamosa on Allium cepa Disease cycle As mentioned earlier, the pathogen makes sclerotia that overwinter in the field debris (infected leaves, bulbs) and cull piles and germinate in the spring. As a result of this germination, conidiophores arise that produce conidia (anamorphic phase). Apothecia also arise out of the sclerotia and release ascospores (teleomorphic phase) although these are not a very significant source of primary inoculum for infection. The sclerotia are capable of continuous and prolonged production of conidia thus resulting in a huge amount of primary inoculum. The conidia and ascospores then go on to produce primary infection on leaves causing leaf blights. Conidia are produced in the necrotic tissues that act as sources of dissemination and secondary inoculum. Towards maturity, Sclerotia are produced in the leaves and necks of infected bulbs (blackened appearance) that overwinter and germinate the following spring. Sclerotia can survive up to 21 months at a depth greater than 15 cm from the soil surface. Environment The optimum temperature for the disease development has been reported to be 15-20 ¬∞C, the first symptom seen after 6 hours of leaf wetness, with the lesion development decreasing with increasing periods of dryness. At temperatures between 9-25 ¬∞C, lesion development increases with increasing temperature and leaf wetness. Based on studies conducted in controlled environments, sporulation on dead leaves has been found to occur with an increase in temperature until 30 ¬∞C and leaf wetness. Disease control Chemical and cultural controls are the two most practiced ways of control. No commercial varieties resistant to B. squamosa have been reported so far. Cultural controls include avoiding cull piles and 2‚Äì3 years of rotation with non host (species other than Allium) plants. It is important to discard damaged and diseased onions at harvest. Dithiocarbamates have been identified as the most effective protectant fungicides. Weather forecasting is generally used to aid in limiting the number of sprays per cropping season. It has also been observed that ground spraying is much more effective than aerial spraying. The optimal frequency has also found to be one spray every 7‚Äì10 days.

He is remembered for his representation of the beach area with the dedication of a bridge in his name.  Early life and education  Gotch grew up in San Francisco. He graduated from San Diego State University with a bachelor's degree in public administration.  Political career  Gotch's public career began in the 1970s as president of the Mission Beach Town Council while working as analyst and then director for the San Diego County Local Agency Formation Commission. He was then elected to the San Diego City Council in 1979, representing the Mission Beach and Pacific Beach communities. He was reelected in 1983 with a record 91.4 percent of the vote. His community support, however, fell in 1988 when he pushed through a development project to turn historic Belmont Park, an amusement park that had fallen into disrepair, into an $18-million shopping center, which the council approved. He was appointed to the Stadium Authority Board from 1988 to 1990 and was instrumental in instituting a smoking ban in the facility. He worked on former Sen.

Background The Arab general Uqba ibn Nafi had led his men in an expedition across North Africa, eventually reaching the Atlantic Ocean and marching as far south as the Draa and Sous rivers. On his return to the east, he was ambushed by the Berber-Byzantine coalition led by Caecilius at the Battle of Vescera in which he was defeated and killed in 682. Caecilius at that time held undisputed mastery over North Africa and marched to Kairouan in triumph. When Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan became the caliph, he was effective in increasing the size of his empire. Therefore, he ordered Zuhayr ibn Qays who was stationed in Barca to lead an army to retake Ifriqiya and its capital Kairouan. In order to mount a stronger resistance, Caecilius took a position in the Aur√®s Mountains in which he could manage to retreat in case of defeat, while the Muslim leader Zuhayr took a decision to camp outside Kairouan near the water resources. After a heavy battle in the valley of Mamma, the Arab invaders eventually managed to defeat the defending troops and to kill their legendary king Caecilius. Aftermath The Arab leader Zuhayr and his troops went back to Barca to fight against the invading Byzantines. The incoming ships of Byzantines came with large numbers of soldiers which defeated the Arabs and killed Zuhayr. Dihya succeeded Caecilius as the war leader of the Berber tribes and opposed the encroaching Arab Islamic armies of the Umayyad Dynasty. Another Arab general Hasan ibn al-Nu'man marched from Egypt and captured the major Byzantine city of Carthage and other cities after the Battle of Carthage. Searching for another enemy to defeat, he was told that the most powerful monarch in North Africa was DihyƒÅ, and accordingly marched into Numidia. The armies met near Meskiana in the present-day province of Oum el-Bouaghi, Algeria. She defeated Hasan so soundly that he fled Ifriqiya and holed up in Cyrenaica for four or five years.

Before 1949, Wang was one of Zhou Enlai's trusted aides and after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 he became Director General of the General Office of Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In January and February 1955 he was Assistant Foreign Minister, and in March of that year became Chinese Ambassador to Poland, a position in which he served until April 1964. While in Poland, he was the Chief Representative of China in the nine-year-long Sino-US Ambassadorial Talks. He was Secretary General of the Chinese Delegation during the Geneva Conference of 1954. In 1966, at the start of the Cultural Revolution, Wang was attacked and imprisoned by the Red Guards. Although he was rehabilitated in 1975, he suffered a heart attack. He died in 1988.Wang Bingnan Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China. Early life and revolutionary activities Wang graduated from the Luoyang Military Academy in 1929 then left for a year of study in Japan. After two years he left for four years of study at University of Berlin, where he studied nn sociology. While there, he was Secretary of the Chinese Language Branch of the Communist Party of Germany, Director of East Department of the Great International League against Imperialism, Chairman of the League against Imperialism of Chinese in Europe, and eventually President of the European Overseas Chinese Anti-Imperialist League. He was especially active in rallying Overseas Chinese in Europe to support resistance to Japan's encroachment in China. In Germany, he met and married Anneliese Martens (Anna Wang ÁéãÂÆâÂ®ú; 1909 - 1990) a German activist and fellow student at the University of Berlin. They were married in London. \\"ÁéãÂÆâÂ®ú:Â´ÅÁªôÈù©ÂëΩÁöÑ‰∏≠ÂõΩ(ÁªÑÂõæ),\\" (Anna Wang: Jiagei geming di Zhongguo (Anna Wang: Married to revolutionary China) ÊñáÂåñ‰∏≠ÂõΩ-‰∏≠ÂõΩÁΩë (January 15, 2010), p. 1 Seeing Off Sa Kongliao 1939: Wang; Anna WangWang returned to Shanghai with his wife in 1936. They became leading figures in Chinese Communist Party relations with foreign countries and foreigners in China. In 1936, since he was a Shaanxi native, the Party dispatched Wang there to build relations with General Yang Hucheng, who controlled the area around Xi'an, where Mao's wing of the Party had set up a headquarters. Wang encouraged General Yang to join the active resistance to Japan rather than press the fight against the Communists. In late 1936, in the Xi'an Incident, General Yang and Zhang Xueliang held Generalissimo Chiang Kai- shek against his will to force him into active resistance against Japan. Zhou Enlai, apparently at the behest of Joseph Stalin, negotiated Jiang's release and came to rely on Wang's contacts with all sides and his skills in these negotiations. Soong Ching-ling and Anna Wang visit Mao Zedong, 1945In 1939, in response to Mao's directive to place even greater weight on foreign propaganda, the Party formed a Foreign Affairs Small Group, whose members included Wang Bingnan, Chen Jiakang, Qiao Guanhua,and Gong Peng, a group that stayed together and formed the nucleus of the Foreign Ministry a decade later. The Party leadership expected them to follow world developments and to cultivate good relations with foreign journalists, diplomats, and soldiers. During the war with Japan, the group served with Zhou in Chongqing, and when wartime cooperation with the Nationalist government turned to Civil War after 1945, Wang was deputy under Ye Jianying in the Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Committee. Wang and Anna visited India briefly in 1945, but returned to work with the Marshall Mission from the end of 1945 to 1947, where he met American diplomats. After 1949 Wang was in the group of Zhou Enlai's protegees from the 1930s who filled most of the positions when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was formed in 1949. Wang was Director General of the General Office, the largest office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from 1949 to 1955. During the 1954 Geneva Conference he was Secretary General of the Chinese Delegation, where he conducted negotiations with U. Alexis Johnson and other senior United States diplomats. He then served briefly as Assistant Foreign Minister in January and February 1955 before becoming Chinese Ambassador to Poland from March 1955 to April 1964. As ambassador to Poland, Wang was the highest level diplomat of the People's Republic to have direct contacts with American diplomats. During the First Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1955 Wang conducted ambassadorial level talks in Warsaw with United States Ambassador Jacob D. Beam.An Illustrated History of the Communist Party of China Mao recalled Wang to Beijing for a detailed briefing in a private talk, and Wang left for Warsaw with detailed instructions to find out if Washington would be willing to force Nationalist armies from the islands if offered concessions in return. When Wang revealed to Beam this willingness to concede before extracting concessions in return, Mao attacked him: \\"even a pig knows to turn around after he hits a wall, and Wang Bingnan does not know how to turn around after he hits a wall.\\" Mao only agreed to keep Wang in Warsaw when Premier Zhou assumed blame. Cultural Revolution and Wang's death In 1967, as the Cultural Revolution gained momentum, Wang was suspended from his job at the Ministry of Foreign Relations and Red Guard factions confined him in the basement of an old hotel. He was shown the scarred and mutilated body of Zhang Yuyun, his second wife, and was told that she had killed herself. In 1969 he was released to go to a cadre school, and allowed to return to the capital only in 1972. He did not have a job or official residence there, however, and lived with his family in cramped conditions. Deng Xiaoping gave him a position in the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries in 1975, but when Deng himself was again purged the following year, Wang had a heart attack.

The formula can be written CH2FCH2F. It is an isomer of 1,1-Difluoroethane. It has a HFC name of HFC-152 with no letter suffix. When cooled to cryogenic temperatures it can have different conformers, gauche and trans. In the liquid form these are about equally abundant and easily interconvert. As a gas it is mostly the gauche form. In the HFC-152 designation, 2 means two fluorine atoms, 5 means 5-1 or four hydrogen atoms, and 1 means 1+1 or two carbon atoms. Formation Ethylene reacts explosively with fluorine yielding a mixture of 1,2-difluoroethane and vinyl fluoride. With solid fluorine it will react when triggered by near-infrared radiation. Properties The F-C-C-F dihedral angle in 1,2-difluoroethane is 68¬∞ in the crystal structure. Critical temperature is 107.5 ¬∞C. If a C-H bond is over excited with too much vibration, the intramolecular vibrational relaxation takes 490 picoseconds. The F-C-C-F dihedral angle is about 72¬∞. Natural bond orbital deletion bond calculations show that 1,2-difluoroethane prefers the gauche conformation due to hyperconjugation effects. Since F is much more electronegative than the C atom, it will have greater electron density for the bonding orbital (Carbon- fluorine bond). Thus, C will have larger œÉ* orbital, which is stabilized through C-H hyperconjugation. This cis C-H bonds and the C-F œÉ* interactions are significant. The dihedral angle of about 72·µí is a result of decreasing hyper conjugative stability and decreasing steric destabilization. Reactions CH2FCH2F reacts with chlorine when treated with light. Two products are formed CH2FCCl2F and CHClFCHClF. The proportions of each depends on the solvent. Uses 1,2-Difluoroethane is primarily used in Refrigerants, 39%; foam blowing agents, 17%; solvents, 14%; fluoropolymers, 14%; sterilant gas, 2%; aerosol propellants, 2%; food freezant, 1%; other, 8%; exports, 3%. Safety 1,2-Difluoroethane is toxic when inhaled or when it comes into direct contact with the skin. Fluorocarbons are 4 to 5 times heavier than air, so it tends to concentrate in low-lying areas. This increases the risk of inhalation. 1,2-difluoroethane is toxic to humans through several mechanisms. First, because it has a high density, it can displace oxygen in the lungs causing suffocation. In addition, inhaled fluorocarbons causes the myocardium to become more sensitive to catecholamines, which results in deadly cardiac arrhythmias.https://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi- bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+6786 When inhaled by rats, 1,2-difluoroethane is converted to fluoroacetate using cytochrome P450 and then to fluorocitrate both toxic. 100 parts per million in the atmosphere was sufficient to poison rats in 30 minutes and to kill them in four hours. 1,2-Difluoroethane is likely to be similarly toxic to humans. Environmental fate 1,2-Difluoroethane can enter the environment various ways. One way is through volatilization from rivers and lakes. Henry‚Äôs Law estimates that the volatilization half life from a model river is about 2.4 hours and 3.2 days from a model lake. When 1,2-difluoroethane is released to the environment, it will end up in the atmosphere. Here it is degraded by reaction with hydroxyl radicals and oxygen. CH2FCH2F + OH ‚Üí CH2FCHF + H2O CH2FCHF + O2 ‚Üí CH2FCHFO2 peroxy radical CH2FCHFO2 \\\\+ NO ‚Üí CH2FCHFO alkoxy radical When catalysed by chlorine atoms and oxidised by nitrogen oxides the end product is HCOF which can decompose further to HF and CO. The halflife in air is between 140 and 180 days. Control 1,2-Difluoroethane is a greenhouse gas when released to the atmosphere. It has a warming equivalent to 140 times that of carbon dioxide. As such it may be controlled by government regulation. The Australian government classifies 1,2-difluoroethane as an exotic synthetic greenhouse gas.

South African Speleological Association Bulletin, Vol.28, 5‚Äì7. This is because the majority of calthemites are created by chemical reactions which are different to normal \\"speleothem\\" chemistry. Calthemites are usually the result of hyperalkaline solution (pH 9‚Äì14) seeping through a calcareous man-made structure until it comes into contact with the atmosphere on the underside of the structure, where carbon dioxide (CO2) from the surrounding air facilitates the reactions to deposit calcium carbonate as a secondary deposit. CO2 is the reactant (diffuses into solution) as opposed to speleothem chemistry where CO2 is the product (degassed from solution). It is most likely that the majority of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) creating calthemites in shapes which, mimicking speleothems, is precipitated from solution as calcite as opposed to the other, less stable, polymorphs of aragonite and vaterite. Calthemite flowstone coloured orange by Iron Oxide (from rusting steel reinforcing) deposited along with calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Calthemite flowstone on outside of concrete water tank Calthemites are generally composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) which is predominantly coloured white, but may be colouredWhite W.B., (1997), \\"Color of Speleothems\\", Cave Minerals of the World, (2nd Edition) Hill C. and Forti P.

Copper oxide from copper pipes may cause calthemites to be coloured green or blue. Calthemites may also contain minerals such as gypsum. The definition of calthemites also includes secondary deposits which may occur in manmade mines and tunnels with no concrete lining, where the secondary deposit is derived from limestone, dolomite or other calcareous natural rock into which the cavity has been created. In this instance the chemistry is the same as that which creates speleothems in natural limestone caves (equations 5 to 8) below. It has been suggested the deposition of calthemite formations are one example of a natural process which has not previously occurred prior to the human modification of the Earth's surface, and therefore represents a unique process of the Anthropocene.  Chemistry and pH  The way stalactites form on concrete is due to different chemistry than those that form naturally in limestone caves and is the result of the presence of calcium oxide (CaO) in cement. Concrete is made from aggregate, sand and cement. When water is added to the mix, the calcium oxide in the cement reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2), which under the right conditions can further dissociate to form calcium (Ca2+) and hydroxide (OH‚àí) ions []. All of the following chemical reactions are reversible and several may occur simultaneously at a specific location within a concrete structure, influenced by leachate solution pH.Maekawa, K, Ishida, T and Kishi, T, (2009). Multi-Scale Modeling of Structural Concrete. [Oxford, UK: Taylor and Francis.] 225‚Äì235. The chemical formula is: Calcium hydroxide will readily react with any free CO2 to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3) [].Ho, D W S and Lewis, R K, (1987). \\"Carbonation of concrete and its prediction\\". Cement and Concrete Research, Vol.17, 489‚Äì504. The solution is typically pH 9 ‚Äì 10.3, however this will depend on what other chemical reactions are also occurring at the same time within the concrete. This reaction occurs in newly poured concrete as it sets, to precipitate CaCO3 within the mix, until all available CO2 in the mix has been used up. Additional CO2 from the atmosphere will continue to react, typically penetrating just a few millimetres from the concrete surface.Borrows, P, (2006a). Chemistry Outdoors. School Science Review ‚Äì Outdoor Science, Vol.87(320), 24‚Äì25. [Hartfield, Herts, UK: Association of Science Education.] Because the atmospheric CO2 cannot penetrate very far into the concrete, there remains free Ca(OH)2 within the set (hard) concrete structure. Any external water source (e.g. rain or seepage) which can penetrate the micro cracks and air voids in set concrete will readily carry the free Ca(OH)2 in solution to the underside of the structure. When the Ca(OH)2 solution comes in contact with the atmosphere, CO2 diffuses into the solution drops and over time the reaction [] deposits calcium carbonate to create straw shaped stalactites similar to those in caves. This is where the chemistry becomes a bit complicated, due to the presence of soluble potassium and sodium hydroxides in new concrete, which supports a higher solution alkalinity of about pH 13.2 ‚Äì 13.4, the predominant carbon species is CO32‚àí and the leachate becomes saturated with Ca2+.Liu, Z and He, D, (1998).

[Houston, TX: National Association of Corrosion Engineers.] so at any one time there may be one or more different chemical reactions occurring within a concrete structure. In very old lime, mortar or concrete structures, possibly tens or hundreds of years old, the calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) may have been leached from all the solution seepage paths and the pH could fall below pH 9. This could allow a similar process to that which creates speleothems in limestone caves [Equations to ] to occur. Hence, CO2 rich groundwater or rainwater would form carbonic acid (H2CO3) (‚âàpH 7.5 ‚Äì 8.5)Hartland, A, Fairchild, I J, Lead, J R, Dominguez-Villar, D, Baker, A, Gunn, J, Baalousha, M and Ju-Nam, Y, (2010). \\"The dripwaters and speleothems of Poole's Cavern: a review of recent and ongoing research\\", Cave and Karst Science, Vol.36(2), 37‚Äì46. and leach Ca2+ from the structure as the solution seeps through the old cracks []. This is more likely to occur in thin layered concrete such as that sprayed inside vehicle or railway tunnels to stabilise loose material.Hagelia, P, (2011). \\"Deterioration Mechanisms and Durability of Sprayed Concrete for Rock Support in Tunnels\\". Doctoral thesis presented at Technische Universiteit Delft, Netherlands. If [] is depositing the CaCO3 to creating calthemites, their growth will be at a much slower rate than [Equations and ], as the weak alkaline leachate has a lower Ca2+ carrying capacity compared to hyperalkaline solution. CO2 is degassed from solution as CaCO3 is deposited to create the calthemite stalactites. An increased CO2 partial pressure (PCO2) and a lower temperature can increase the HCO3‚àí concentration in solution and result in a higher Ca2+ carrying capacity of the leachate,Herman, J S, (2005). \\"Water Chemistry in Caves\\", Encyclopedia of Caves, (1st edition) edited by Culver D., White W., 609- 614 however the solution will still not attain the Ca2+ carrying capacity of [Equations to ] The reactions [Equations to ] could be simplified to that shown in [], however the presence of carbonic acid (H2CO3) and other species are omitted. The chemical formula [] is usually quoted as creating \\"speleothems\\" in limestone caves, however in this instance the weak carbonic acid is leaching calcium carbonate (CaCO3) previously precipitated (deposited) in the old concrete and degassing CO2 to create calthemites. If the leachate finds a new path through micro cracks in old concrete, this could provide a new source of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) which can change the dominant reaction back to []. The chemistry of concrete degradation is quite complex and only the chemistry relating to calcium carbonate deposition is considered in [Equations to ]. Calcium is also part of other hydration products in concrete, such as calcium aluminium hydrates and calcium aluminium iron hydrate. The chemical [Equations to ] are responsible for creating the majority of calthemite stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone etc., found on manmade concrete structures. Maekawa et al., (2009) p. 230, provides an excellent graph showing the relationship between equilibrium of carbonic acids (H2CO3, HCO3‚àí and CO32‚àí) and pH in solution. Carbonic acid includes both carbonates and bicarbonates. The graph provides a good visual aid to understanding how more than one chemical reaction may be occurring at the same time within concrete at a specific pH. Leachate solutions creating calthemites can typically attain a pH between 10‚Äì14, which is considered a strong alkaline solution with the potential to cause chemical burns to eyes and skin ‚Äì dependent on concentration and contact duration.Smith, G K., (2016), \\"Calcite Straw Stalactites Growing from Concrete Structures\\", condensed summary.

This chemistry can occur when there is a source of concrete, lime, mortar or other manmade calcareous material located above a cave system and the associated hyperalkaline leachate can penetrate into the cave below. An example can be found in the Peak District ‚Äì Derbyshire, England where pollution from 19th century industrial lime production has leached into the cave system below (e.g. Poole's Cavern) and created speleothems, such as stalactites and stalagmites.  CaCO3 deposition and stalactite growth  Calthemite straw stalactites can grow up to 2 mm per day in favourable conditions. This one is growing in an undercover concrete car-park. The growth rates of calthemite stalactite straws, stalagmites and flowstone etc., is very much dependent on the supply rate and continuity of the saturated leachate solution to the location of CaCO3 deposition. The concentration of atmospheric CO2 in contact with the leachate, also has a large influence on how quickly the CaCO3 can precipitate from the leachate. Evaporation of the leachate solution and ambient atmospheric temperature appears to have very minimal influence on the CaCO3 deposition rate.Ver Steeg, K, (1932). \\"An unusual occurrence of stalactites and stalagmites\\". The Ohio Journal of Science, Vol.32(2), 69‚Äì83. Calthemite straw stalactites precipitated (deposited) from hyperalkaline leachate have the potential to grow up to ‚âà200 times faster than normal cave speleothems precipitated from near neutral pH solution. One calthemite soda straw has been recorded as growing 2 mm per day over several consecutive days, when the leachate drip rate was a constant 11 minutes between drips. When the drip rate is more frequent than one drop per minute, there is no discernible deposition of CaCO3 at the tip of the stalactite (hence no growth) and the leachate solution falls to the ground where the CaCO3 is deposited to create a calthemite stalagmite. If the leachate supply to the stalactite straw's tip reduces to a level where the drip rate is greater than approximately 25 to 30 minutes between drops, there is a chance that the straw tip will calcify over and block up. New straw stalactites can often form next to a previously active, but now dry (dormant) straw, because the leachate has simply found an easier path through the micro cracks and voids in the concrete structure.  Calcite rafts on solution drops  Lattice work of calcite rafts has formed on slow dripping calthemite straw drop Calcite rafts were first observed by Allison in 1923Allison, V C, (1923). \\"The growth of stalagmites and stalactites\\". Journal of Geology, Vol.31, 106‚Äì125. on solution drops attached to concrete derived straw stalactites, and later by Ver Steeg. When the drip rate is ‚â•5 minutes between drops, calcium carbonate will have precipitated on the solution drop surface (at the end of a stalactite) to form calcite rafts visible to the naked eye (up to 0.5 mm across). If the drip rate is greater than ‚âà12 minutes between drops, and there is very little air movement, these rafts may join up and become a latticework of calcite rafts covering the drop surface. Significant air movement will cause the rafts to become scattered and spin turbulently around the drop's surface. This turbulent movement of calcite rafts can cause some to shear off the drop's surface tension and be pushed onto the outside of the straw stalactite, thus increasing the outside diameter and creating minute irregularities.  Stalagmites  Calthemite stalagmite on concrete floorCalthemite micro-gours on a small rounded stalagmite ‚Äì a secondary deposit derived from concreteCalthemite coralloids growing on underside of concrete structure and straw stalactite Calthemite flowstone on concrete wall, stained orange from iron oxide (from rusting steel reinforcing) being deposited along with calcium carbonateCalthemite flowstone and straw stalactites growing on copper pipes under a concrete building. If the drip rate is quicker than one drop per minute, most of the CaCO3 will be carried to the ground, still in solution. The leachate solution then has a chance to absorb CO2 from the atmosphere (or degas CO2 depending on reaction) and deposit the CaCO3 on the ground as a stalagmite. In most locations within manmade concrete structures, calthemite stalagmites only grow to a maximum of a few centimetres high, and look like low rounded lumps. This is because of the limited supply of CaCO3 from the leachate seepage path through the concrete and the amount which reaches the ground. Their location may also inhibit their growth due to abrasion from vehicle tyres and pedestrian traffic.  Rimstone or gours Calthemite rimstone or gours can form beneath concrete structures on a floor with a gradual sloping surface or on the side of rounded stalagmites. When the leachate drip rate is more frequent than 1 drop per minute, most of the calcium carbonate is carried by the leachate from the underside of the concrete structure to the ground, where stalagmites, flowstone and gours are created. The leachate which does reaching the ground, usually evaporates quickly due to air movement beneath the concrete structure, hence micro-gours are more common than larger gours. In locations where the deposition site is subject to abrasion by vehicle tyres or pedestrians traffic, the chance of micro-gours forming is greatly reduced.  Coralloids  Calthemite coralloids (also known as popcorn), can form on the underside of concrete structures and look very similar to those which occurs in caves. Coralloids can form by a number of different methods in caves, however on concrete the most common form is created when hyperalkaline solution seeps from fine cracks in concrete. Due to solution evaporation, deposition of calcium carbonate occurs before any drop can form. The resulting coralloids are small and chalky with a cauliflower appearance.

The original French version Maigret et le Client du samedi appeared in 1962.Carter, David. The Pocket Essential Georges Simenon. The Pocket Essentials, 2003. A man visits Inspector Jules Maigret at his home to tell him he wants to kill his wife and her lover. Although it is not an official case, Maigret is interested, particularly when the man later disappears. Summary Maigret's expected Saturday evening in January, of a meal and watching his recently installed television, is suspended when L√©onard Planchon, a nervous man with a hare lip, visits him. He has often called at Police Headquarters on a Saturday and left before seeing Maigret; this time he has followed Maigret home. He tells him he wants to murder his wife and her lover. Maigret has not been sought out at home before and is interested in Planchon. In a long conversation, Planchon, who has a decorating business, tells Maigret how he met his wife, and about Roger Prou, an employee. Prou has moved into his house and into his bedroom; Planchon has to sleep on a camp bed. In the evenings he visits bistros and gets drunk. Maigret tells Planchon to phone him every day. On Sunday morning Maigret phones Headquarters and asks if there are any reports from the 18th arrondissement of Paris, where Planchon lives, thinking there might be a murder. In the afternoon, Maigret and his wife take a walk past Planchon's home; on Monday he gets colleagues, pretending to be council surveyors, to look round the house. In the evening Planchon phones, but he does not phone next day. On Wednesday, having still not heard from him, Maigret phones the house; Prou replies, saying Planchon will not be back. Maigret visits the house and sees Planchon's wife Ren√©e; she says that Planchon left with suitcases on Monday evening, and that three weeks earlier he had signed the business over to Prou. Although Maigret is not sure what sort of case he is investigating, he manages to get permission from the Deputy Prosecutor to interview Planchon's employees. The last interview is with Prou, who explains how he found the cash for Planchon's business, some of it borrowed from relatives. During the interview Maigret borrows the transfer document and a graphologist examines it: he thinks Planchon's signature on it may have been forged. Maigret's colleagues check the bars frequented by Planchon. A prostitute is found who knew him: on Monday he was so drunk she helped him back to his house. Maigret, aware that Planchon could not have left with suitcases if he was too drunk to stand, persuades the Deputy Prosecutor to give him a search warrant, and the house is searched. When a bundle of banknotes is found under floorboards, the case soon reaches a conclusion.

Between 1933 and 1941, the Progressive Education Association sponsored curricular experimentation in 29 model schools with the security that over 200 colleges would admit their students on the recommendations of their principals rather than curricular requirements. The schools received curricular consultants but were otherwise uninhibited in their curricular choices. Their changes tended towards individualized student attention with more cross-disciplinary programming and greater emphasis on arts and extracurriculars. The General Education Board and other foundations offered significant financial backing towards the study. The study concluded that, when compared to their peers in traditional secondary school programs, students of the study's experimental programs performed on par academically and showed more activity in artistic, political, and social engagement. Students of the study's most experimental schools outperformed the others. The implications of the study were limited by the natural advantages of the student‚Äìparticipants' high social class backgrounds and their schools' lack of privations, even before the study's added resources. The reforms instituted in the participant schools subsided within a decade of the study's end, owing to the more conservative political climate of World War II and the Cold War, the reforms' increased labor demands on teachers, and increased competition in college admissions. Nevertheless, the study showed that the curricular structure of American high schools could change under propitious conditions. Its influence was reflected not in direct change but its influence on its participants and subsequent reformers.  Design and implementation  Based on the criticism that American secondary education curriculum had been designed to meet the needs of college admissions rather than those of students, the Progressive Education Association sponsored an eight-year study between 1933 and 1941 to determine whether young adults could excel in college if college admission requirements were revoked. The Progressive Education Association's Commission on the Relation of School and College convinced more than 200 colleges to admit highly qualified high school students on the recommendations of high school principals who participate in the study. The colleges, who suffered decreased enrollment during the Great Depression, were relatively easy to recruit. And of 200 nominated high schools, 29 were chosen based on their repute, including 10 public high schools (including all of those in Denver), six university-based high schools, and 13 independent schools. With their college admissions requirements lifted, the high schools began to experiment with their curriculum. The commission provided curriculum consultants and analysts to the schools but otherwise did not intervene in their experimentation. Similar patterns of curricular reform developed across the participant high schools. Programming was increasingly cross-disciplinary with former emphasis on traditional classes displaced for more arts programming. Teachers engaged in more collaborative class planning and prep and changed their class sizes and lengths. Students blended formal and informal education in programs that included community service, group decision-making, and artistic productions. Many schools chose to constitute smaller mini-schools within their high schools. In general, these changes shifted school emphasis from factory model schools to individualized student attention. The General Education Board and other foundations contributed more than a million dollars (equivalent to $ million in ) towards the study.  Effects  The study concluded that graduates of the Eight-Year Study high schools received grades on par with their equivalent peers from traditional high schools, but were more active in artistic, political, and social activities. Additionally, graduates of the study's high schools with most progressive changes fared better than the high schools that made more modest changes. These results were unsurprising given the relative advantages of the study's students and schools: youth with the relative advantages of high social class upbringing coming from well-equipped schools. The participants also reaped advantages from curricular resources (consultants, grants, publicity) that would not be afforded to similar efforts. Even as the Progressive Education Association's director trumpeted that multiple preparatory paths could lead to college success, the reforms subsided in the participant schools within a decade. Representatives from across the study met in 1950 and concluded that their schools had returned to fundamentals, focusing on mechanics of spelling over writing assignments and Carnegie unit preparatory regimentation over time spent on arts and extracurriculars. These representatives said that World War II and Cold War security concerns‚Äîand their resulting conservative authoritarianism‚Äîoverrode progressive interests in both society and the school. Internal to the high schools, the demands of collaborative teaching and the programmatic setbacks of high staff turnover wore upon teachers. These progressive factions had limited entry in the participating schools, and when their progressive approach faltered, traditionalists reasserted authority. Upon inspection, some of the study's model schools had implemented little progressive reform and instead appeared to have joined the study for reasons of prestige. The schools that continued to experiment post-study were predominantly those that had been most progressive before the study started. External to the high schools, colleges became more selective as applicants increased in the late 1940s. Colleges did not adopt the study's recommendations for reasons of disbelief or ignorance. The Eight-Year Study showed that the curricular structure of American high schools could change under propitious conditions: when families and teachers held liberal ideology, colleges relaxed vetting mechanisms, and foundations offered support. The study brought a brief period of energy and happiness to its participants, who considered the effort worthwhile in retrospect. Its major impact was not direct change but its influence on its participants and subsequent reformers.

Tokai Park is made up of two sections: upper and lower Tokai Park. Lower Tokai Park is flat, and characterized by the threatened Cape Flats Sand Fynbos. Upper Tokai Park is on the slopes of Constantiaberg Mountain, and consists of conservation area as well as the Tokai Arboretum. Upper Tokai Park is characterized by Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos and Afromontane Forest and noted for its diversity. Until recently, most of Tokai Park was under plantation. However the lease of Tokai Park by MTO Forestry expires in 2025, and the removal of the last of the commercial plantations has been followed by restoration efforts by South African National Parks and other conservation organisations. Today Tokai Park has over 110 plant species threatened with extinction or extinct in the wild and restored at Tokai. Perhaps the best known example of a species that is extinct in the wild, but which is recovering at Tokai Park is Erica verticillata. More than 350 plant species have already naturally returned. There are now over 440 recorded plant species at Lower Tokai Park according to a species list compiled by scientists. According to William Frederick Purcell's list, there may be over 500 plant species expected. Tokai Park is also a popular recreational area, with walking trails, horse-riding and cycling trails as well as a picnic area. Whilst recreation is regarded by all as an important ecosystem service provided by this park, there has been much contention over shaded walk-ways, with scientists maintaining that shaded recreation is not compatible with Fynbos restoration, and a group of the public who wish to retain the plantations for shaded recreation.  A brief history of Tokai Park  From 1905-1919, William Frederick Purcell created a species list for Bergvliet/Tokai, which is the only source of information on the plant species that used to occur in Cape Flats Sand Fynbos. Around the same time, plantations were established at Tokai Park. Much of Tokai Park has been covered by pine plantations for over a century and subjected to three harvesting cycles. Tokai is thought to have been the starting point of Forestry in South Africa. Its most important contribution was arguably the attempted Forestry School (1906-1911). Its failure led to a local training college for foresters in 1912, which was transferred to Saasveld in 1932 During the 20th century Tokai plantation was used for the provision of wood during the two World Wars. Forestry eventually allowed the plantations to be used for dog-waking, opening up the area as an exclusive \\"white recreation area\\" during apartheid. Post apartheid, the park was eventually ceded to the World Heritage Site: Table Mountain National Park, and it came under the management of South African National Parks. It is now open to the public as a conservation area. Tokai Arboretum, Tokai Park =Tokai Arboretum= The main section of the Tokai Arboretum at Upper Tokai Park is 14 ha in size, with adjacent compartments resulting in a combined 26 ha. In 1884, Joseph Storr Lister planted Monterey Pines in the first attempt at commercial afforestation at Tokai. Two years later (1886) an arboretum was established adjoining the nursery at Tokai. Over 150 species were established, some indigenous and some nationally-indigenous, but mostly exotic species. In August 1985 -its 100th anniversary- Tokai Arboretum was declared a National Monument. In the 1990s there was an attempt to establish a 'Gondwana Garden\\" to showcase species typical of Gondwana. Many of these species were present at the Cape 60 million years ago. However this was not a success as the plantings were shaded out by the established trees, therefore the project was abandoned. There are currently about 900 plants from 300 species recorded in the main Arboretum. Erica verticillata: extinct in the wild, being reintroduced at Tokai Park  The Conservation Significance of Tokai Park  Mediterranean ecosystems are sites of both high biodiversity and high biodiversity loss. Tokai Park is unusually rich and stands out amongst its counterparts making it a significant conservation area for the City of Cape Town and a site of global interest . Tokai is part of the Cape Peninsula centre of endemism of the Cape Floristic Region. With over 9000 species of plants the Cape Flora is by far the richest temperate flora on earth, earning itself the status of one of the 6 Floral Kingdoms on earth. Thus this tiny area has half of all the plant species in South Africa, and 20% of the flora of Africa. With over 2500 indigenous plant species the Peninsula is exceptionally rich even by Cape Floral standards. By comparison, the United Kingdom has 1200 species of plants, the Kruger National Park has about 1980 species and Namibia has 3960 species. Additionally there are very few cities on earth with 150 plant species threatened with extinction, let alone in a single vegetation type within their borders (Cape Flats Sand Fynbos). Despite its remarkable species richness in a small area, Tokai Park is adjacent to a large conservation area, the World Heritage Site Table Mountain National Park (SANParks), and thus is not an isolated fragment and avoids associated management problems. In other words, the area is large enough to maintain minimum viable populations of plant species, making it ecologically viable.  Geology of Tokai Park  Three main geological types occur within Tokai Park. The steeper slopes and cliffs of Constantiaberg are Peninsula Formation Sandstone of the Cape Supergroup, covered with plant communities belonging to Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos. The midslopes comprise deep, fertile, loamy soils, derived from the older Cape Suite granites, which support Peninsula Granite Fynbos plant communities, but which have been converted elsewhere on the Peninsula to vineyards and leaf urban suburbs. These granites also underlie the lower Tokai park, but these are covered by Tertiary sands. These nutrient-poor, acidic sands reach thicknesses of tens of meters, and support the highly threatened Cape Flats Sand Fynbos. The upper edge of the sands expose silcrete/ferricrete deposits, which have been mined in the past.  Vegetation of Tokai Park  Tokai Park has four national vegetation types present, including: Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, Peninsula Granite Fynbos, Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos and some small patches of Afromontane Forest. Tokai Park is also the location of historical and cultural heritage, such as the Tokai Arboretum. Cape Flats Sand Fynbos =Cape Flats Sand Fynbos= Cape Flats Sand Fynbos is the most threatened vegetation type at Tokai. Only 10% of this veld type is left. Less than 1% is conserved at present, making Tokai the most important nature reserve for this veld type. The veld type currently contains 108 IUCN Red List species (92 threatened with extinction, 4 already extinct, and 12 other species of conservation concern). It thus qualifies nationally as Critically Endangered, both on account of its destruction and its high numbers of threatened species. The sudden change in status of Tokai is not due to anything at Tokai itself, it is due to the rapid loss of Cape Flats Sand Fynbos elsewhere in Cape Town. Projections of urban growth predict that unless something is urgently done, all remaining veld will be lost by 2020, leaving Tokai as the biggest reserve of this veld type. The City of Cape Town has targeted the Blouberg area as a priority conservation area to try and save a representative portion of this veld type. This is a dry region (rainfall 410 mm per year) - Tokai represents the wettest examples of this veld type, with almost double (190%) the average rainfall for this veld type. There are 2 IUCN Red Data List frog species on site. Peninsula Granite Fynbos on Chapmans Peak =Peninsula Granite Fynbos= Peninsula Granite Fynbos, occurs at the base of the mountain. It forms the roots and foundation for the sandstone, and benefits from the moisture caught by the sandstone ramparts. It is a relatively fertile soil, and consequently the vineyards and most expensive real estate in the city occurs on what used to be Granite Fynbos. Because of its high carrying capacity, this is where the large herds of game, predators, and baboons used to occur historically in the southern Peninsula. Silver Tree groves, lush riverine corridors and fertile, well- watered soils are in especial short supply along the west coast, and Constantia was one of the first farms developed by Europeans. About one-third remains, and much that does is poorly managed, because of safety and fire concerns. Some 24 IUCN Red List species occur, and 9 species are endemic or near-endemic to the type. It is now classified as Critically Endangered, with 43% remaining; and only 30% conserved. Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos =Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos= Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos occurs on the uppermost slopes of Constantiaberg and Vlakkenberg. It is confined to the sandstone geology, which weathers to a coarse sand. The soil is exceptionally poor in nutrients and the carrying capacity for supporting animals is very low. Animals do occur, but at extremely low densities. The most common vertebrates are sunbirds and sugarbirds, subsidized by nectar provided by plants. But in terms of plants this veld type is extremely rich: based solely on the large number (64) of threatened species, this veld type is classified as Endangered. Some 140 species of plant are categorized as endemic to this vegetation type ‚Äì they occur nowhere else on earth. This high richness can be explained by the topography (greater relief means more habitats), the proximity to the sea (which limits the variation in climate, so that species occur in narrower zones on the mountain, thus packing more communities and species into the same altitudinal range), and the long isolation of the Peninsula mountains from the other mountains (so that fewer species are shared with neighbouring mountains at Kogelberg, Hottentots Holland and Piketberg, resulting in more unique species). This vegetation type is well conserved: 97% remains; with 90% conserved. Afrotemperate forest =Afrotemperate Forest= The Afrotemperate Forest is by far the rarest vegetation type at Tokai, and belongs to the Forest Biome. Afrotemperate Forest cannot cope with fire, consequently it is confined to a few fire-safe kloofs at Tokai, minute pockets compared to the larger expanses in Orangekloof and Kirstenbosch. As forests go, Afrotemperate is the richest forest in temperate regions, however, its species richness pales into insignificance compared to Fynbos: barely 20 species of tree occur naturally in these forests. Animals, mainly insects, abound in these forests and their species diversity is extraordinary given their area. There are only three small patches of Forest at Tokai, and their species have not been well documented. Afrotemperate Forest is well conserved, with over 99% in good condition within the City of Cape Town.  Restoration of Tokai Park  Parts of Tokai Park remain under pine plantation, but all plantations are due to be harvested by 2022, as they are a planted crop grown on a commercial basis by a private company, MTO Forestry. When all the plantations are removed, Tokai Park is to be restored, and combined with the greater Table Mountain National Park. Most of the plantations at Tokai Park have been harvested to date, and the Fynbos restored either actively or passively. Passive restoration involved a simple harvesting of plantations with no management nor prescribed burns to stimulate the Fynbos seedbanks. Consequently, these Fynbos sites have not recovered as well as those actively restored, and many alien shrubs and grasses are present. Subsequently, alien shrubs were systematically removed with pulling and cut stump treatment by management and a local Friends group. A few sites were actively restored using fire, with either hot or cool burns. Anecdotally, it appears that sites with hotter fires contain more indigenous species, more indigenous plants, and less cover of alien annual grasses and weeds than those subjected to cooler fires. Fire is critically important for the restoration of Fynbos. At some sites, active restoration included species that had disappeared from the Fynbos seedbanks being replanted, amongst them the Rondevlei Spiderhead, Cape Flats Conebush and Iron Heath. The result of the restoration is that over 440 plant species have recovered at Lower Tokai Park. This exceptional recovery is largely due to Fynbos seedbanks which are still intact after over 100 years of rotational plantations. These results mean that Cape Flats Sand Fynbos can be relatively easily restored and conserved within Tokai Park, and that the potential for passive restoration is high. Furthermore, Tokai Park has been identified as one of the top 80 priority areas for active restoration in Cape Town, out of thousands of vegetation remnants. It is possible that close to 500 species of plants will establish naturally here ‚Äì based on a historical study by Purcell in the Bergvliet area. Following the successful plant recovery at Tokai Park, wildlife such as Cape Fox, Porcupine, Caracal and wild bees are now recorded here, with more animal species expected as vegetation reaches maturity (later successional stage). A study was done comparing animal diversity in plantations relative to restored fynbos, using small mammals as bio-indicators (due to their high reproductive outputs and fast population turnover rates). Over 1800 trap-nights, 480 captures were made of 345 individuals from six species. Significantly higher numbers and more species of small mammals were found in the recovering fynbos sites compared to plantations, probably due to the higher plant diversity, vegetation density and biomass in the fynbos.  Activities  Tokai Park is open year-round during daylight hours, and there are many different types of activities to do in the park, including nature walks, jogging, dog-walking, horse-riding, cycling and mountain biking. Many people enjoy walks around the perimeter trail at Lower Tokai, or on the numerous single track paths through the Fynbos, where others prefer to frequent Upper Tokai Park for its mountain biking trails and hiking up Constantiaberg. There are three gates at Lower Tokai, with parking available, and one at Middle Tokai, at the picnic and braai site, where people wishing to use Upper Tokai can park. =Walking= Tokai Park can be divided into three sections. The lower part of the park which is flat, the middle part which hosts the picnic and braai area and the Tokai Arboretum, and the upper part, which is steep and mountainous. Lower Tokai Park has numerous trails through the Cape Flats Sand Fynbos, the Restoration Trail, the Perimeter Trail and the Information Deck. There are several trails through the Tokai Arboretum, and the Elephants Eye trail which is right to the top of Constantiaberg. Dog walking is allowed at Lower Tokai Park with an activity permit, but it is forbidden at Upper Tokai Park. To hike at Upper Tokai Park (part of Table Mountain National Park), users must either pay a daily Conservation Fee, or enter with their valid Wild Card. Restoration Trail at Tokai Park =The Restoration Trail= The Tokai Restoration Trail at Tokai Park is a short walk that showcases some rare plant species at Tokai, and includes 7 information boards on the following topics: * Where does one begin with restoration? * Why do we need to restore Fynbos at Tokai? * How to restore a critical ecosystem * Challenges: aliens, fire Plant species showcased to date on the trail include: the Whorl Heath (Erica verticillata), the Yellow Creeping Brightfig (Lampranthus reptans), Capeflats Conebush (Leucadendron levisanus), Wattleleaf Conebush (Leucadendron macowanii), Snakestem Pincushion (Leucospermum hypophyllocarpodendron subsp. hypophyllocarpodendron), Mountain Dahlia (Liparia splendens subsp. splendens), Marsh Pagoda (Mimetes hirtus), Wynberg Spiderhead (Serruria cyanoides), Rondevlei Spiderhead (Serruria foeniculacea), and the Trident Spiderhead (Serruria trilopha). Mountain Biking at Tokai =Mountain Biking= There are 21 mountain biking trails at Tokai Park, and they are divided into three categories depending on their difficulty. Green graded trails are easy flowing single tracks (beginners), blue graded trails are for those with more experience and include obstacles, and black graded trails are for expert riders. Permits are required to use the mountain biking trails at Tokai Park. =Alternative Shaded Recreation= There are 10 shaded greenbelts in close proximity to Tokai Park. The various trails are 20-35 minutes long from start to end, some flat, some steeper. These are: * Doordrift Walk: 25-30 min * Alphen Trail: 20-25 min * Diep River Trail: 25-35 min * Klaasenbosch Trail: 30-45 min * Brommersvlei Walk: 20-25 min * Die Hel Nature Area: 45-55 min * Grootboschkloof Trail: 20-25 min * Spaansgemat River Trail: 25-35 min * Silverhurst Trail: 30-35 min * Keysers River Trail: 30-35 min  See also  *  References   External links  * iNaturalist.org Tokai Park Table Mountain National Park ","title":"Tokai Park"},{"id":"52503215","text":"The history of Cantieri di Pisa (Pisa Shipyards) began in 1945 Pisa.

Life Leiva Konstanze Petersen was born in Berlin. Her father, Carl Petersen (1885‚Äì1942) was originally from Hviding in Northwest Schleswig. Carl Petersen was a history professor at Kiel till 1939 when he switched to Greifswald. Leiva Petersen's mother, born Ida Minna R√§uber, was a teacher. A cousin was G√ºnther Ramin, the organist and director of music at St. Thomas Church, Leipzig. She attended school at Marburg and Kiel, and then studied Classical Philology, History and Archeology successively at Frankfurt, Munich, Kiel and W√ºrzburg. It was at Munich that she first met Uvo H√∂lscher (1914-1996), a fellow student of philology who became a lifelong friend. In 1937 she received her doctorate, supervised by Karl Reinhardt from Frankfurt for a piece of work on the \\"... history of personification (œÄœÅŒøœÉœâœÄŒøœÄŒøŒπŒØŒ±) in Geek poetry and visual art\\" (\\"Zur Geschichte der Personifikation in griechischer Dichtung und bildender Kunst\\"). After this she undertook an extended study trip to Italy, also taking time to work for a time as a home tutor in Denmark. Back in Germany, in 1939 she passed the exams necessary to take up a teaching career in higher education. Now, however, she embarked on a book trade apprenticeship with Hermann B√∂hlaus Nachfolger, a venerable publishing institution that could trace its convoluted and at times illustrious history back to the \\"Weimarer Hofbuchdruckerei\\" (\\"Weimar Court printers\\") founded in 1624. Just three years later, in 1942, she found herself in charge of the business, known as its \\"Kommanditistin\\". She retained the responsibilities which the appointment involved till her career ended in 1983. War, which had broken out in 1939, ended in May 1945, with a large part of what had been central Germany - including Weimar - administered as the Soviet occupation zone. In 1946 Petersen obtained one of the first private company licences from the Soviet military administrators, in 1947 becoming personally responsible (and liable) for the business. Under her leadership the business produced academic editions of German classics and Reformation literature, including the works of Goethe, Schiller and Luther, along with the humanities more generally. From 1951/52 she also embarked on a parallel part-time career as a freelance co-author. Meanwhile the B√∂hlau company continued for several decades to be one of the last independent publishing businesses inside what had become, in October 1949, the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In 1978 the business was sold to the (East) German Academy of Sciences and Humanities: Petersen continued to run it, now as a department of the academy, till 1983. Alongside her responsibilities in publishing, between 1961 and 1972 Petersen held a part time appointment as a Classical Philosopher and Senior Assistant at the Academy of Sciences and Humanities. Successful projects included producing an updated and enlarged edition of the Prosopographia Imperii Romani, a lexicon of Roman empire state officials. As she grew in eminence she also sat as a member of various important committees. She was a member of the Administration Committee for the Schiller National Exhibition and the committee of the German Schiller Society. She was on the board of the (German) Shakespeare Society and a member of the Publishers' Committee with the German Book Exchange (\\"B√∂rsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels\\"). Having retired from regular employment in 1983, Leiva Petersen died at Weimar, where she still lived, on 17 April 1992.

She had been in the shower block at the beach when witnesses claim a man took her and ran off. It is believed that she was strangled to death around an hour after her abduction, in the nearby suburb of Balgownie. Cheryl's disappearance had been without explanation for over 45 years, until a suspect was arrested and charged in March 2017. He pleaded not guilty. His trial was expected to take place at the Supreme Court of New South Wales in May 2019; however, a judge declared that a key piece of evidence was inadmissible, leading to the prosecution dropping the charges against the suspect in February 2019. Life The Grimmer family emigrated from Knowle, a suburb of Bristol, England to Australia in the spring of 1968, when Cheryl was two years old. They were living in Fairy Meadow Migrant Hostel near the beach where she disappeared. The family consisted of mother Carole (26), father Vince (24), and sons Ricki (7), Stephen (5), and Paul (4). Cheryl was the Grimmers' only daughter. Disappearance On the morning of 12 January 1970, the Grimmer family went to the beach at Fairy Meadow in Illawarra, except for Vince, who was away working as a sapper for the Australian Army. When the weather turned at 1:30 pm, Carole decided it was time to go home. The children all went to the shower block together whilst Carole packed up their belongings. Ricki went back to Carole ten minutes later saying that Cheryl was refusing to come out of the shower block. She followed Ricki back to the shower block moments later to find that Cheryl had disappeared. There was no phone nearby, so Carole made her way to a house on nearby Elliotts Road and asked them to call the police. At the time, witnesses claimed that a man was seen holding Cheryl up to drink from a water fountain and then ran off with her wrapped up in a towel. The claims are now seen as unlikely. Cheryl's brother, Ricki, recalled picking up his sister so that she could drink from the fountain and it is thus believed that witnesses conflated the two occurrences. It was also claimed that she was spotted in a white car. Investigation Cheryl's disappearance sparked a massive manhunt. A day after investigations began, the New South Wales Police announced that they had four theories as to Cheryl's whereabouts: that she was hiding and had fallen asleep, that she had wandered into the ocean and was carried away by currents, that she had fallen into a waterway, or that she had been kidnapped. After a day of searching, all but the latter were dismissed and they began pursuing other leads, such as a blue Volkswagen Type 2 van which had been spotted near the scene of the crime. On the third day, police received a note demanding $10,000 and stating that the child was unharmed. They staged a drop for the money in Bulli, but the kidnapper never showed despite police earnestly believing the note to be credible. They disguised themselves as council workers for the ransom drop and originally feared that this led to the kidnapper being spooked and that the large police operation may have deterred them from coming forward. However, the writer never contacted police again and it was assumed the note was a practical joke. The case became famous in Australia and the family relocated back to England for ten years afterwards to escape the notoriety. Although the police had three main suspects, none could be positively identified as the man witnesses saw. Just under 18 months after Cheryl's disappearance, in 1971, a local teenager, then 15 or 16, confessed to abducting and killing her. The man gave an overview of what occurred that day, describing a tubular steel gate, a cattle guard, a track, and a small creek near the scene of the murder. He brought police to a corner of Brokers and Balgownie roads and claimed the body was buried there, but noted that the area had undergone residential development and he thus couldn't be sure. Police interviewed the owner of the property, who contradicted the suspect's description and stated that there was no cattle guard in place at the time of the murder and that there had never been a tubular gate of any kind. Such inconsistencies eventually led to police concluding that his confession was false, with a police report at the time, written by Detective Sergeant Phillip Findlay, stating: In spite of numerous appeals‚Äîand a $5000 reward offered by the New South Wales government‚Äîthere was no breakthrough in the inquiry and the case went cold. = Later developments = In the 2000s, New South Wales Police Minister Michael Gallagher stated that it is entirely possible that both Cheryl and her kidnapper are dead but expressed hope that someone may know the truth. He also theorised that Cheryl may be alive and free and encouraged anybody who believes they may be her to come forward. One of Cheryl's characteristics that was cited as a possible identifier was a belly button which protruded one centimetre due to a medical condition, which may or may not have been corrected by surgery. In 2008 a woman believed that she might be Cheryl but, after submitting a swab taken from her inside cheek, proved not to be a match to Cheryl's DNA. In May 2011, a coroner formally ruled that Cheryl had died shortly after going missing due to an undetermined cause and recommended that police reopen the investigation‚ÄîCarole Grimmer stated that she believed her daughter was still alive. In response, police posted a $100,000 reward for information regarding Cheryl's disappearance and Wollongong detectives and the Homicide Squad's Unsolved Homicide Team combined efforts into a new task force called 'Strike Force Wessell'. Shortly after the investigation was reopened, both Carole and Vince Grimmer died without knowing what happened to Cheryl. In 2016, a review of the evidence was carried out and all of it, including witness statements, was computerised for the first time. The review uncovered many leads and brought to light information that appeared to have not been pursued thoroughly enough in the original investigation, particularly the 1971 confession. Police returned to the property where the teenager alleged that he had committed the murder and questioned the owner's son, who, contradicting his father, said that the cattle guard was \\"certainly\\" in place at the time and that he recalled a tubular gate as well as a track leading over a creek into the property. Police announced in late 2016 that three witnesses had come forward and recalled a teenage man loitering around the shower blocks and that they had a credible lead on a man who was seen carrying a fair-haired child at the time of Cheryl's disappearance. Police noted that he would be in his 60s by now and appealed for him to come forward. In January 2017, police turned their attention towards the Mount Penang Training School for Boys, a reformatory school which it was believed the suspect attended in the early 1970s. They implied that they had been provided with information by somebody who alleged that former staff or residents from the school would be able to help with the inquiry.  Arrest of suspect and court proceedings  On 23 March 2017, it was announced that a man had been arrested in the Melbourne suburb of Frankston at 1pm the previous day and was being extradited from Victoria; he was charged with Cheryl's abduction and murder at Wollongong Police Station and was incarcerated at the Silverwater Correctional Complex. Police stated that it is unlikely that Cheryl's body will ever be found as there has been substantial development of the once-rural area in the 47 years since the abduction. In April 2017, New South Wales police announced that they were trying to trace a family who gave a witness statement on the day of the abduction. Soon after Cheryl's disappearance, the family moved to Papua New Guinea and then back to their native Nottinghamshire in England. Interpol assisted in tracing efforts, eventually finding them; their testimonies were expected to be crucial in the court case. In May 2017, it was revealed that the suspect who was arrested in March was the same person that had confessed to Cheryl's abduction and murder in 1971 and had been dismissed due to inconsistencies. The accused is a 63-year-old man who was born in Britain and has been in Australia since the late 1960s. He has not been named, as he was around 15 years old at the time of the alleged offence and therefore a minor. Further details of the crime have continued to emerge as the court case proceeds. In his original 1971 statement, the man‚Äîwho allegedly told doctors in 1970 that he had \\"urges to kill himself and kill other people\\"‚Äîsaid that, after the abduction, he had hid with the toddler in a nearby drain for about 35 minutes, gagging her with a handkerchief and tying her hands behind her back with a shoelace. After emerging from the drain, he took her three kilometres by foot to the suburb of Balgownie, where, according to prosecutor Emilija Beljic, he intended to have sexual intercourse with her. The accused denied the latter claim, calling it \\"bullshit\\". In the man's original confession he told police that after he took the gag off of her and she started to scream, he put his hands around her neck and told her to \\"shut up\\", eventually strangling her to death. He apparently panicked, took off her clothing, and placed \\"bushes and dirt\\" over the body before heading back to Fairy Meadow Beach. The confession also included information which, the prosecution claims, the man could not know without being present at the beach when the abduction occurred. Such details include a description of the royal blue bathing suit she was wearing and of the white towel she was carrying, as well as mention of the fact that somebody had picked up Cheryl so that she could drink from a water fountain, which her brother Ricki confirms he did. The defence will argue that the accused was significantly mentally unwell at the time of the confession and it is thus inadmissible in court. They claim that he also made another confession, to the murder of a prison guard, which was determined to be false. The defendant appeared via video link at the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 7 September 2018 and spoke only to confirm his name and enter a not guilty plea. His trial was due to occur in the same court in May 2019; however, a judge declared a key piece of the evidence inadmissible in the case, leading to the prosecution dropping the charge against the suspect in February 2019.

Family History  It was only by accident that Ghazi Daghistani was Iraqi by birth. His father was a local from Dagestan Oblast and a nephew by marriage of the great Sheikh Shamil who raised parts of Dagestan Oblast and Chechnya against Imperial Russia in the days of the Crimean War. After his defeat by Prince Bariatinsky, Sheikh Shamil himself was taken off to Russia, but Mahomet Fazil Daghistani and others escaped over the frontier and joined up in the Turkish Army. Mahomet Fazil Daghistani, Ghazi's father, rose to high command and fought against the Russians in the Turkish/Russian war of 1877. Later he became one of die favourite generals of the Sultan Abdul Hamid II, but as with all favourite Generals of this particular Sultan this favour did not last for ever and he was suddenly exiled to Baghdad in 1880. He was put in command of die Irregular forces which were dealing with tribal affairs in Kurdistan and he is mentioned for his popularity and abilities in Mark Sykes' book The Caliph's Last Heritage. When the 1914 war broke out General Mahomet Fazil Daghistani took the field with his Irregulars against the advancing British forces and was eventually killed at the head of his troops before the capture of Baghdad. After the war the family continued to live on in Baghdad. Ghazi's elder brother, Daoud Beg, was a well-known figure on the racecourse and had a large area of property in the neighbourhood of Baqubah where he entertained with princely hospitality; he was a very keen shot and falconer.  Early life  Ghazi went to secondary school in Beirut and subsequently entered the Royal Iraqi Military College where he was in the same Company as his future sovereign, King Ghazi of Iraq. Later he was sent to Woolwich where he qualified at the Royal Military Academy in 1933, returning to the Royal Engineers in the Iraqi Army. After a few years in various junior appointments he passed out from the Iraqi Staff College and was then sent to the Staff College at Quetta, where he qualified in 1939.  Military Life  He was subsequently employed in several important posts in the Ministry of Defence before being appointed Chief of Staff to the Allied Arab Commander in the short-lived Palestine Campaign in 1948. In 1954 he was posted as Military attach√© to London where he remained until 1957. He was awarded an Honorary C.V.O. in 1953 for services with H.R.H. the Duke of Gloucester at the Coronation of H.M. King Faisal II of Iraq. On his return to Baghdad after leaving London he was appointed Deputy Chief of the General Staff. His responsibilities in this post included much of the detailed negotiations in London and Washington connected with the Baghdad Pact and the subsequent military planning. In the summer of 1958 he was posted to command the 3rd Division, but on the murder of the King and the fall of the monarchy he was tried, imprisoned and condemned to death. He was released in 1960 and lived quietly in London until his sudden death.  Death  The following address was read at his funeral: \\" To all here, the sudden death of this highly gifted and lovable soldier, Major-General Ghazi Mohammed Daghistani, comes with a sense of shock. Those of us who knew him twenty years ago, gay and young, with a fine brain and a tremendous interest in his profession, considered him to be the out- standing soldier of the younger generation of the Iraqi Army. He seemed bound for High Command and also bound to play a great part in the leading circles of the Government of his country. Everything seemed to fit him for it, his charm, his tolerance, his fine brain, his linguistic ability, his sense of pro- portion and above all his high standards of conduct. He was outstanding in any company and at any time‚Äîbut then tragedy came. After his fall from power‚Äîand after two years of imprisonment under sentence of death‚Äîhe returned to a life of exile in England and here he was an example to all who suffer adversity. He faced his new life with dignity, serenity and courage, never blaming others for his misfortunes and always hoping that one day he might still render some service to the land he loved. He was supported throughout by a very happy family life. To his much- loved wife and children we offer our sympathy today. They have lost a beloved husband and father and we too have lost a much loved friend.\\" External sources http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03068376608731952 Iraqi generals ","title":"Ghazi Mohammed Daghistani"},{"id":"52503609","text":"Butcher Hill is a 1989 video game.
