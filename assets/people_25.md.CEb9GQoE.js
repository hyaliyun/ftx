National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed October 3, 2011 river in the U.S. state of New York. It is the largest tributary of the Hudson River. The Mohawk flows into the Hudson in Cohoes, New York, a few miles north of the city of Albany.Mohawk River , The Columbia Gazetteer of North America The river is named for the Mohawk Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. It is a major waterway in north-central New York. The largest tributary, the Schoharie Creek, accounts for over one quarter (26.83%) of the Mohawk River's watershed. Another main tributary is the West Canada Creek which makes up for 16.33% of the Mohawk's watershed. Course The river's source is at the confluence of the West Branch and East Branch in north-central Oneida County. It begins flowing generally southeastward towards the Hamlet of Hillside, first receiving Blue Brook then McMullen Brook and Haynes Brook. In Hillside is the confluence of Lansing Kill, after which it flows towards the Hamlet of North Western receiving Stringer Brook along the way. After North Western it receives Tannery Brook then Wells Creek in the Hamlet of Frenchville. At Frenchville it curves to the southwest and heads toward the Hamlet of Westernville receiving Deans Gulf along the way. In Westernville it enters Delta Reservoir. After exiting the reservoir it heads south toward the City of Rome receiving Hurlbut Glen Brook and passing the Rome Fish Hatchery along the way. On the south side of the City it enters the Erie Canal and begins to flow east. After Rome the river flows generally east through the Mohawk Valley, passing by the cities of Utica, Little Falls, Canajoharie, Amsterdam, and Schenectady before entering the Hudson River at Cohoes, just north of Albany. =Modifications= The river and its supporting canal, the Erie Canal, connect the Hudson River and port of New York with the Great Lakes at Buffalo, New York.\\"The New York State Canal System\\" Carmella R.

Geology The Mohawk watershed drains a large section of the Catskill Mountains, the Mohawk Valley proper, and a section of the southern Adirondack Mountains. All three regions have distinct bedrock geology, and the underlying rocks become progressively younger to the south.Rickard, L.V., Y.W. Isachsen, and D.W. Fisher, 1970, Geologic Map of New York State, 1970. 1:250,000. Consists of five sheets: Niagara, Finger Lakes, Hudson-Mohawk, Adirondack, and Lower Hudson, Map and Chart Series No. 15 Overall, this part of New York is represented by lower Paleozoic sedimentary rocks that unconformably overlie the Grenville-aged (Proterozoic, here about 1.1 billion years old) metamorphic rocks of the Adirondacks.Physical Geography of New York In the watershed, these rocks are only significant in the headwaters of the West Canada Creek. Much of the main trunk of the Mohawk River sits in Cambro-Ordovician carbonates (limestone) and Middle Ordovician sandstones and shales.Lower Ordovician Faunas, stratigraphy, and sea-level history of the Middle Beekmantown Group, Northeastern NY, Journal of Paleontology; September 2006; v. 80; no. 5; p. 958-980 The southern tributaries (Catskill Mountains) are underlain by a thin sequence of Devonian limestones that are overlain by a thick sequence of sandstones and shale of the Catskill Delta, which is also Devonian in age.Geologic History of the north-central Appalachians, American Journal of Science, Vol. 297, September 1997, P.729-761 During the Pleistocene (c. 1.8 to 0.01 mya), the watershed was extensively modified by continental glaciation. As a result of glacial scour and deposition, the surficial deposits in much of the watershed are poorly sorted boulder- and clay-rich glacial till. During deglaciation, several glacial lakes left varved clay deposits. In the final stages of deglaciation, approximately 13,350 years ago,Catastrophic draining of Glacial Lake Iroquois, Catastrophic meltwater discharge down the Hudson Valley: A potential trigger for the Intra-Aller√∏d cold period, Geology; February 2005; v. 33; no. 2; p. 89-92 the catastrophic draining of Glacial Lake Iroquois, a pro-glacial lake, was through what would become the modern Mohawk Valley.John C. Ridge, Shed Brook Discontinuity and Little Falls Gravel: Evidence for the Erie interstade in central New York, GSA Bulletin; June 1997; v. 109; no. 6; p. 652-665. In this final phase, the enormous discharge of water caused local deep scour features (e.g. the Potholes at Little Falls), and extensive sand and gravel deposition, which is one of the key sources of municipal groundwater including the Scotia Delta, which is also known as the Great Flats Aquifer.\\"Responsible Planning for future ground water use from the Great Flats Aquifer\\" Thomas M. Johnson, in: Proceedings from the 2009 Mohawk Watershed Symposium, Union College, 27 March 2009 Etymology The river is named for the Mohawk Nation of the Iroquois Confederacy. In the 1700s and before, the Mohawk people, a section of Iroquois Confederacy, were based in the Mohawk Valley, which included the area around the creek. Their territory ranged north to the St. Lawrence River, southern Quebec and eastern Ontario; south to greater New Jersey and into Pennsylvania; eastward to the Green Mountains of Vermont; and westward to the border with the Iroquoian Oneida Nation's traditional homeland territory. History The river has long been important to transportation and migration to the west as a passage through the Appalachian Mountains, between the Catskill Mountains and Allegheny Plateau to the south and the Adirondack Mountains to the north. The Mohawk Valley allowed easier passage than going over the mountains to the north or south of the valley. As a result, it was strategically important during the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War, and a number of important battles were fought here. The fertile Mohawk Valley also attracted early settlers. The river was the highway of the native Mohawk people. The Mohawk name for the river was Tenonanatche, \\"a river flowing through a mountain\\" (or Yenonanatche, \\"going round a mountain\\"). The first recorded European exploration of the Mohawk was a trip by the Dutchman Harman Meyndertsz van den Bogaert in 1634. He followed the river upstream from Albany for a distance of 100 miles, including all the territory of the Mohawks. In 1661 Dutch colonists founded the city of Schenectady on the Mohawk River approximately from Albany. \\"For fifty years Schenectady was the outpost of civilization and Dutch-English rule in the Mohawk valley.\\" In 1712 the British, now in control of New York, built Fort Hunter at the confluence of the Mohawk and the Schoharie Creek, about upriver from Schenectady. Around 600 Palatine Germans were settled along the Mohawk and Schoharie Creek. In the early nineteenth century water transport was a vital means of transporting both people and goods. A corporation was formed to build the Erie Canal off the Mohawk River to Lake Erie. Its construction simplified and reduced the difficulties of European westward settler migration. The Mohawk Valley still plays an important role in transportation. Railroads followed the Water Level Route, as did major east‚Äìwest roads such as Route 5 and Interstate 90. The Mohawk River Heritage Corridor Commission was created to preserve and promote the natural and historic assets of the Mohawk River. This commission was created by the NY State Legislature in 1997 to improve historic preservation along the river.Mohawk Valley Heritage Corridor Commission website Troy and the Hudson River in the foreground, and Schenectady in the background =Flooding and discharge= The Mohawk River has a relatively long record of flooding that has been documented back to settlement in the 17th century.Historic flooding on the Mohawk River The average volume of water that flows through the Mohawk is about every year.Historic flooding on the Mohawk River Much of the water flows through the watershed in the spring as snow melts rapidly and enters the tributaries and the main trunk of the river. The maximum average daily flow on the river occurs between late March and early April. For the period between 1917 and 2000, the highest mean daily flow is c. as measured at Cohoes, near the confluence with the Hudson. The lowest mean daily flow of occurs in late August. There is a long record of significant and damaging floods along the entire length of the river. Because the river and its tributaries typically freeze in the winter, the spring melt is commonly accompanied by ice floes that get stuck and jammed along the main trunk of the river. This annual spring breakup typically occurs in the last few weeks of March, although there are numerous floods that have occurred before or after this time, such as in 2018 when the ice jam breakup happened in late February after record warm weather in the region. These ice jams can cause considerable damage to structures along the riverbanks and on the floodplain. The most severe flood of record on the main trunk of the Mohawk River was the spring breakup flood that occurred from 27 to 28 March 1914. This flood caused a tremendous amount of damage to the infrastructure because it was a spring breakup flood with enormous amounts of ice. Ice jams of some significance occur about every other year.Historical and modern ice jams on the Lower Mohawk River - Schenectady\\"A historical perspective of Ice Jams on the lower Mohawk River.\\" John I. Garver, Jaclyn M.H. Cockburn, In: Proceedings from the 2009 Mohawk Watershed Symposium, Union College, 27 March 2009 One major flood on the Mohawk was on 26‚Äì29 June 2006, during the Mid-Atlantic United States flood of 2006. Flooding was caused by a stalled frontal system that resulted in of rain across central New York and widespread flooding occurred in the Mohawk, Delaware, and Susquehanna watersheds. Across the state, this event caused over $227 million in damage and resulted in the loss of four lives. This flooding was acute in the upper parts of the Mohawk watershed.\\"The Flood of June 2006 in the Mohawk, Delaware, and Susquehanna river basins.\\" Thomas P Suro, United States Geological Survey, In: Proceedings from the 2009 Mohawk Watershed Symposium, Union College, 27 March 2009 The Mohawk River also saw significant flooding during the weeks between August 21, 2011 and September 5, 2011 due to torrential rains experienced from Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee. Many of the Mohawk Barge Canal locks sustained major damage, especially near Waterford and Rotterdam Junction. Another major flood was on June 28, 2013. It was caused by heavy rain that had fallen in the region for weeks. On the night of June 27, 2013, the Jordanville area reported that 4 inches of rain fell in one hour. The next day, the Mohawk River flooded the valley, residents were stranded and without power for about a week. There was considerable damage everywhere, especially Mohawk and Fort Plain. Watershed management Historically, the Mohawk watershed has lacked a watershed management plan typical in many adjacent basins. In 2010, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation released the Mohawk River Basin Action Agenda, which is the first framework for a watershed management plan in this basin. This plan identifies five priority goals for the Mohawk River Basin that are designed to enhance ecosystem health and the vitality of the region. The Action Agenda, developed by the NYS DEC in collaboration with a number of stakeholders in the basin with public input, advocates an ecosystem-based approach to watershed management. In October 2014, Riverkeeper, an environmental advocacy and clean water watchdog organization, announced that they will be expanding the reach of their efforts from the Hudson River to the Mohawk as well.

The city has a population of about 234,000 per the . Formosa is the hub of the provincial industry, that processes the product of its natural resources. The port that serves the Paraguay towards the Paran√° River is the main transport means for the provincial production. Notable sights of the city include the Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen Cathedral, the Government House, the Torelli Botanic Forest Garden, the Provincial History Museum (Museo Hist√≥rico Provincial), the Estadio Centenario (\\"Centenary Stadium\\") football stadium, the Guaicole fauna reserve, the shore of the Paraguay River, the Isla de Oro Island, and the Central Square named after Jos√© de San Mart√≠n.  History  The lands were initially inhabited by Toba and Wich√≠ (Mataco) aboriginals. On April 8, 1879 Commander Luis Jorge Fontana founded the settlement that would become the capital of the National Territory of Chaco from 1884 to June 15, 1955, when it gained the status of province. The Formosa campus of the National University of the Northeast was established as the National University of Formosa in 1988. The name of the city (and the province) comes from the archaic Spanish word fermosa (currently hermosa) meaning \\"beautiful\\". The name Vuelta Fermosa or Vuelta la Formosa was used by Spanish sailors in the 16th century to describe the area where the Paraguay River makes a turn, right in front of the actual city. These sailors were searching for the legendary Sierra del Plata.Rese√±a (Spanish)  Culture  The city, which is only a few hundred meters away from Paraguay across the river, has a culture closer to that of Paraguay than the \\"porte√±o\\" culture of Buenos Aires. Laid back and relaxed, its young people relax on the Costanera, the recently restored pathway along the R√≠o Paraguay which serves as a venue for arts displays and features a fast-food restaurant, or at boliches, local clubs. The city's well-known cultural institutions include the Formosa Regional Historical Museum, the Juan Pablo Duffard Historical Museum (a National Historic Monument), the Qomp Toba Artisanal Museum, and the Oscar Albertazzi Arts Institute. The city has, since the 1970s, enjoyed increasing domestic tourism as a winter destination and, since the devaluation of the peso in 2002, growing international tourism, as well. Formosa is currently home to one five-star hotel (the International Tourist Hotel) and four four-star hotels. One other five-star establishment, the Howard Johnson Neo Formosa, was completed in July 2011 and features a casino and shopping gallery. 23,000-capacity Estadio Don Carlos Antonio Romero, used mainly for association football, is the main venue in Formosa. = Festivals = Formosa celebrates Our Lady of Carmen (Nuestra Se√±ora del Carmen), its patron saint, on July 16 in honor of its holy day. Celebrations, which occur in the main Plaza San Mart√≠n, include the traditional peric√≥n dance and stalls selling everything from food to balloons. It also celebrates the Fiesta del R√≠o in November, Carnaval on weekends in February and D√≠a de la Fundaci√≥n de Formosa in April. Transport The El Puc√∫ Airport , 7 kilometres south of the city, serves charter flights, and regular flights to Buenos Aires.  Geography  = Climate = Lapachos in bloom at the Children's Paradise Park The city has a climate considered as humid subtropical or Cfa by K√∂ppen classification. The city's climate is among the warmest and most humid in Argentina: Winters are generally mild, air frosts are very uncommon . Summers are hot and humid. During the most extreme heat waves, temperatures exceed 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F). Temperatures have exceeded 35 ¬∞C (95 ¬∞F) in every season. Summers are long, hot and sticky, with most days between 30 ¬∞C (86F) and 35 ¬∞C (95F); temperatures up to 38 ¬∞C (100F) are common, and nights are usually between 20 ¬∞C (68F) and 25 ¬∞C (77F). Cooler temperatures only arrive by late April, and winters are very mild: highs average 22 ¬∞C (72F), lows average 12 ¬∞C (54F). However, these averages are reached through a pattern that switches from warm, northerly winds, to cold southerly winds, and so forth: with northerly winds, temperatures are often much warmer, between 25 ¬∞C (77F) and 30 ¬∞C (86F) and nights are mild, around 15 ¬∞C (59F). Southerly winds often bring a period of drizzly, cold weather with temperatures that stay around 10 ¬∞C (50F) to 15 ¬∞C (59F) for a day or two (which, combined with the high humidity and the winds can feel surprisingly cold), followed by clear skies, cold nights (2 ¬∞C to 7 ¬∞C, or 36F to 45F) and pleasant days at 15 ¬∞C (59F) to 20 ¬∞C (68F). Light frost is possible in Formosa, especially in the outskirts of the city further away from the river; however, air temperatures seldom fall below 0 ¬∞C, every few years at most, with a record low of -2 ¬∞C (28F). The highest temperature recorded was on October 17, 2014 while the lowest temperature recorded was on July 10, 1976 and August 1, 1993. Rainfall can be expected throughout the year though summer is usually the wettest season. Thunderstorms can be intense with frequent lightning, powerful gusts of wind and intense precipitation.

After 1661, he lived in exile, mainly in England, as a consequence of his attack on French policy at the time of the Peace of the Pyrenees (1659). He is buried in Poets' Corner, Westminster. He wrote for his friends and did not intend his work to be published, although a few of his pieces were leaked in his lifetime. The first full collection of his works was published in London in 1705, after his death. Life He was born at Saint-Denis-le-Guast, near Coutances, the seat of his family in Normandy. He was a pupil of the Jesuits at the College de Clermont (now Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand), Paris; then a student at Caen. For a time he studied law in Paris at the College d'Harcourt (now Lyc√©e Saint-Louis). He soon, however, took to arms, and in 1629 went with Marshal Bassompierre to Italy. He served through great part of the Thirty Years' War, distinguishing himself at the siege of Landrecies (1637), when he was made captain. During his campaigns he studied the works of Montaigne and the Spanish and Italian languages. In 1639 he met Gassendi in Paris, and became one of his disciples. He was present at the battles of Rocroi, N√∂rdlingen, and at Lerida. For a time he was personally attached to Cond√©, but offended him by a satirical remark and was deprived of his command in the prince's guards in 1648. During the Fronde, Saint-√âvremond was a steady royalist. The duke of Candale (of whom he has left a very severe portrait) gave a command in Guienne to Saint-√âvremond, who had reached the grade of mar√©chal de camp. He is said to have pocketed 50,000 livres in less than three years from this office. He was one of the numerous victims involved in the fall of Fouquet in 1661. His letter to Marshal Cr√©qui on the Treaty of the Pyrenees, which is said to have been discovered by Colbert's agents at the seizure of Fouquet's papers, seems a very inadequate cause for his disgrace. Saint-√âvremond fled to the Netherlands and to England, where he was kindly received by Charles II and was pensioned. After James II's flight to France, Saint-√âvremond was invited to return, but he declined. Hortense Mancini, the most attractive of Cardinal Mazarin's group of attractive nieces, came to England in 1670, and set up a salon for love-making, gambling, and witty conversation, and here Saint-√âvremond was for many years at home. He died aged ninety on 29 September 1703 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his monument still is in Poets' Corner, close to that of Prior. Literary work Portrait of Charles de Saint-√âvremond by Godfrey Kneller. c. 1680s Saint- √âvremond never authorised the printing of any of his works during his lifetime, though Barbin in 1668 published an unauthorised collection. But he empowered Des Maizeaux to publish his works after his death, and they were published in London (2 vols., 1705), and often reprinted. His masterpiece in irony is the so-called Conversation du mar√©chal d'Hocquincourt avec le p√®re Canaye (the latter a Jesuit and Saint-√âvremond's master at school), which has been frequently classed with the Lettres provinciales. His ≈íuvres mesl√©es, edited from the manuscripts by Silvestre and Des Maizeaux, were printed by Jacob Tonson (London, 1705, 2 vols.; 2nd ed., 3 vols., 1709), with a notice by Des Maizeaux. His correspondence with Ninon de l'Enclos, whose fast friend he was, was published in 1752; La Com√©die des acad√©mistes, written in 1643, was printed in 1650. Modern editions of his works are by Hippeau (Paris, 1852), C Giraud (Paris, 1865), and a selection (1881) with a notice by M. de Lescure. Among his plays is one called Politick Would-be, modelled on a character from Ben Jonson's Volpone.

It was the first online RPG for game consoles; players adventure with up to three others over the internet to complete quests, collect items, and fight enemies in real-time action RPG combat. The story is unrelated to previous games in the Phantasy Star series. Before Phantasy Star Online, online gaming was limited to western PC games, particularly RPGs such as Diablo, Ultima Online, and EverQuest. Believing online play was the future, Sega chairman Isao Okawa instructed Sonic Team to develop an online game for the Dreamcast, produced by Yuji Naka. Sonic Team's experiments led to the development of ChuChu Rocket!, the first online Dreamcast game. Using what they learned from the project, and taking significant inspiration from Diablo, Sonic Team built Phantasy Star Online. As Japanese internet service providers charged for dial-up access per minute, and high-speed connections were not yet widely available, Okawa personally paid for free internet access bundled with Japanese Dreamcasts. Phantasy Star Online was highly anticipated and launched to critical and commercial success; critics found the online gameplay addictive but panned the single-player mode. It received the Japan Game Award for \\"Game of the Year\\" and is recognized as a landmark console game, influencing multiplayer dungeon crawlers such as the Monster Hunter series. Phantasy Star Online was ported to Windows and rereleased on Dreamcast as Ver. 2 with expanded content. Following Sega's exit from the console business in 2001, the game was ported to GameCube and Xbox as Episode I & II, featuring new characters, environments and other features. Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution, released for GameCube in 2003, was a turn- based card game. The online series continued with Phantasy Star Universe (2006) and Phantasy Star Online 2 (2012). Sega decommissioned the last official servers in 2010; Phantasy Star Online is still played on private servers. Gameplay A player battling enemies in the forests of Ragol with three other players Phantasy Star Online is an action role-playing game primarily played with other players cooperatively over the internet. Players take on the role of adventurers sent to explore Ragol, an uncharted planet. To create their character, they choose between a handful of races and classes, which define their abilities and statistics; for example, some types are better with \\"techniques\\" (magic spells) while others are more skilled with ranged or melee weapons. Players can play either online or offline. Online, players are brought to a lobby where they can chat and organize teams of up to four. Team members can communicate by typing using a physical or onscreen keyboard, even when in different environments. Preset phrases are automatically translated between languages, and custom emoticons are also supported. Players can also exchange \\"guild cards\\" to exchange private messages and see when the other is online. After organizing a team, players are transported to their own instance of the hub spaceship Pioneer 2, where they can buy and sell items, store money and items, heal, and browse quests. At any time, they can transport to Ragol, where combat and exploration take place. The four environments ‚Äì forests, caves, mines, or ruins ‚Äì comprise winding passages and large areas where enemies spawn. Players fight enemies in real time, using weapons and techniques and collecting items. Attacks can be chained for more accuracy and speed. Typically, all the monsters in a room must be defeated to advance. Each environment ends in a boss battle, which rewards the team with a large sum of experience points. Quests, taken on Pioneer 2, task players with specific challenges; once completed, the team returns to Pioneer 2 to collect their reward. Higher difficulties reward players with more experience points and better items. Some items can be used to feed the player's mag, a small creature that follows the player character and aids them in battle. Plot The story of Phantasy Star Online is unrelated to the original Phantasy Star series, and is less substantial. Threatened by the imminent destruction of their home planet, thousands of refugees arrive at planet Ragol aboard the spaceship Pioneer 2. As they establish contact with colonists sent ahead on Pioneer 1, an enormous explosion shakes the planet. Adventurers from Pioneer 2 land to investigate the explosion and search for Rico Tyrell, daughter of the head of Pioneer 2. They discover the planet overrun by monsters, and follow messages left by Rico leading to an ancient evil, Dark Falz. Development By the late 1990s, the popularity of online gaming on personal computers had grown substantially in the west, but was almost nonexistent in Japan, where consoles were more popular. Sega chairman Isao Okawa believed the internet was the future of gaming and wanted a flagship online game for Sega's Dreamcast console. None of Sega's development studios wanted the project, as they were occupied with their own ventures, such as Jet Set Radio (2000) and the Sakura Wars series. Okawa gave the responsibility to Sonic Team, led by Yuji Naka. Sonic Team was not particularly receptive to the decision, but continued with development. After Okawa became ill, Naka sent reports to the hospital to update him on progress. = Concept = Producer Yuji Naka in 2015Sonic Team began experimenting with the Dreamcast's network capabilities after completing Sonic Adventure in 1998. They saw the creation of an online game for Japan, a nation of console gamers, as a serious challenge, akin to creating a new genre. Much of their time was spent learning the basic elements of online gaming; they wanted to make sure the network functionality worked before developing the gameplay, setting, and story. Their network experiments became ChuChu Rocket!, released in 1999 as the first online game for the Dreamcast. Sonic Team used the lessons learned from ChuChu Rocket! to implement network technology in the larger project. Because of the lack of Japanese online games, and the developers' experience with the genre, Naka looked to western games for inspiration, and studied three online RPGs popular at the time: Diablo (1996), Ultima Online (1997), and EverQuest (1999). Diablo in particular impressed him on a gameplay and technical level; he enjoyed how smooth the graphics and action were despite requiring significant system memory. Diablo was a 2D game, however, and Sonic Team wanted to develop a 3D game with the same degree of smoothness and gameplay. This concerned Naka, as he did not want his game to use the cheap and bland graphics associated with online games. Naka decided against creating a massively multiplayer game similar to Ultima Online and EverQuest, which would handle many players simultaneously in a persistent world; the necessary servers would have required two years of programming, and the Dreamcast did not have a hard disk drive to support continuous online patches. Naka was also more interested in working on new projects instead of continuously updating the same game for years, and doubted Sonic Team would be able to keep the game interesting. The team therefore adopted Diablo as their main inspiration, determined to outclass it. = Art and setting = Sonic Team built a science fiction-fantasy game under the working title Third World. The art style was \\"comic-like\\" at first, but became more realistic. One of artist Satoshi Sakai's early concept drawings of a dragon reminded Naka of Sega's Phantasy Star series; which had been dormant since Phantasy Star IV (1993) for the Genesis. Naka had served as main programmer on Phantasy Star (1987) and Phantasy Star II (1989). He had always wanted to develop a multiplayer Phantasy Star game, but previous hardware did not allow for it. With the Phantasy Star series chosen as the setting, Sonic Team continued developing the gameplay and story. The team was given freedom not to adhere strictly to elements from earlier Phantasy Star games. The game would not continue the story from the previous Phantasy Star games, something that made Naka feel liberated. Since few of the Phantasy Star IV staff still worked at Sega, the art team felt little obligation to adhere to the previous games' style, retaining only the science fiction look and some enemy and item names. Naka and Sakai believed factors such as the change in graphical fidelity and genre were enough to differentiate it from previous Phantasy Star games. = Music = The soundtrack was composed by Hideaki Kobayashi using a Roland JV-2080 synthesizer, with live orchestration on some tracks, including the theme song. Kobayashi composed ambient music for calm scenes, and incorporated more rhythm and melody for battles. He composed short four-bar melodies that are sequenced depending on gameplay; for example, when an enemy appears, the system plays music associated with that enemy. The process was a drain on the Dreamcast hardware, and gained the nickname \\"the crasher\\" among staff for how often it would crash the game during development. = Online functionality = Sonic Team had conceived their 1998 Saturn game Burning Rangers as an online game for four players, but abandoned the idea due to insurmountable network problems. They used the ChuChu Rocket! networking system as a template for the online functions for Phantasy Star Online. This presented new challenges, as the new network would connect players between different countries. Sonic Team ran experiments with different internet service providers, dial-up modems, cable modems, and other networking configurations to ensure the game would work for all players. In Japan, Sonic Team gave beta versions to 10,000 users who pre-ordered the game, so they could work with a variety of equipment and internet services to eliminate problems. They wanted to run a worldwide test but did not have time. 90% of the testers were able to play online. Despite technical success, Sega was concerned that the high cost of internet access in Japan would be prohibitive for gamers and reduce sales. Japanese internet service providers charged per-minute fees for dial-up access, and high-speed options such as broadband were not yet widely available. To combat this, chairman Okawa personally paid for free internet access for one year to be bundled with each Dreamcast. One of the biggest challenges was bridging the language barrier between global players. Sonic Team felt that developing a universal language system would be the largest barrier to a global gaming network. The team started by developing the word select system, which allows players to select predefined expressions to be translated to other players. The system had about 2000 words near the end of development, and Naka found it difficult to add more words to satisfy all player needs. Sonic Team built support for five languages: Japanese, English, Spanish, German, and French. They omitted Italian and Portuguese due to time constraints. Korean was also considered because of the internet boom in Korea at the time. Japanese and English were easier to implement because the only concern is the word location in the sentence, whereas Spanish and French have grammatical gender. The language system had to be fully redesigned at least once. Each server could accommodate one thousand players. Sega initially prepared 20 network servers to accommodate 20,000 online users for game's launch, with room to add more servers as necessary. This was increased to support up to 36,000 players right before launch. Sonic Team partnered with Swatch to use Swatch Internet time (or \\"beat time\\") as a universal clock for the game. The clock was implemented so players could coordinate with those in other countries on when to play online. The clock system divides each 24 hours into 1000 beats, with one beat equaling one minute and 26.4 seconds. The time was maintained directly on the server and not based on the user's clock on their system. Sonic Team decided not to add jumping to keep the levels simple and simplify the network code. Naka joked that future gamers would laugh at the word \\"Online\\" in the title, as he believed that online gaming would become standard; it was included as the concept was new and so important to communicate. = End of production = Phantasy Star Online was planned for release in March 2000, but was delayed so more features could be added. The team planned 18 character types, and had male and female sketches for each, but settled on nine. A player-versus-player mode was included in beta versions given to journalists, but this was omitted in the final version because it distracted players from the cooperative focus and introduced game balance issues; additionally, as the console-playing audience was younger than the PC audience, Naka did not want to evoke competitive behavior. The development team had more ideas for features to implement as development came to a close, with Naka wishing he had six additional months to add more features. Phantasy Star Online took two years to develop. Naka found it difficult to make a networked game for consoles, and developed an appreciation for Microsoft for supporting online games so well.  Promotion  Sega unveiled Phantasy Star Online at the 1999 Tokyo Game Show with a gameplay demonstration. Naka called it the \\"killer app\\" for the Dreamcast as it used all aspects of the system, most importantly the modem. As the first online RPG for consoles, Phantasy Star Online was highly anticipated. Journalists saw it as the next evolutionary step in console-based role-playing games. Francesca Reyes of Official Dreamcast Magazine proposed that it would be an \\"industry-changing title\\", a landmark in the history of console gaming. Computer and Video Games wrote that the Dreamcast was quickly becoming the platform for innovative games, and wrote that Phantasy Star Online was \\"arguably the most revolutionary - not the mention most ambitious - console game ever\\". GameSpot believed it would \\"change the way we think of RPGs\\" and could possibly be \\"the most exciting console RPG ever created\\". Edge wrote that the multiplayer mechanics \\"would lay the foundations for a new era of console gaming\\". Video Gamer called it the \\"Dreamcast's most ambitious project yet\\". Some journalists had concerns about the viability of the online modes, and saw the single-player option as a fail-safe should it not function correctly. To promote the game, Sega bought a star on the International Star Registry and named it \\"Ragol\\". The first 100,000 people to pre-order the game in Japan received Phantasy Star Online branded dog tags. A limited edition in Japan including a branded memory card was canceled and the memory card sold separately on Sega's website. Early copies of the game included a demo for Sonic Adventure 2.  Launch  Phantasy Star Online was first released for the DreamcastPhantasy Star Online was released in Japan on December 21, 2000. The language could be changed to English or any of the other supported chat languages, making it \\"import-friendly\\". Naka had hoped for a simultaneous global release, but the western release was delayed for beta testing and marketing reasons. While subscriptions would be free in North America, in Japan the game included a 30-day free trial, after which Japanese players were required to purchase 30-day or 90-day subscriptions. Immediately after the Japanese release, Sonic Team began maintaining the overworked servers and investigated network problems in Hiroshima and Okayama. Sonic Team hoped that Phantasy Star Online would be successful in Japan; international sales were seen as a bonus. In North America, which Naka believed would be the biggest market, Phantasy Star Online was released on January 29, 2001. It sold 75,000 copies there on the first day and was the bestselling game that week. Sega's North American online gaming service SegaNet was not required for online play. While the Japanese version supported the modem and broadband adapters, the North American release did not support the broadband adapter, but IGN explained how to use it by swapping discs with an import copy. Phantasy Star Online sold 500,000 copies in Japan and one million worldwide, meeting Sega's expectations almost exactly. Naka had hoped to sell more, but believed the servers may not have carried the load. Before its western launch, nearly 100,000 players had registered. By April 2001, over 235,000 players had registered worldwide: 130,000 in Japan, 70,000 in North America, and 35,000 in Europe. By May, over 270,000 had registered. The peak number of users connected simultaneously was 26,000. Phantasy Star Online suffered problems common with other online games, with players cheating and selling rare items online. Several weeks after launch, Japanese players began exploiting bugs to duplicate items, enhance their stats, and kill other players. Sonic Team announced they would ban players found cheating or disrupting other players, starting in May 2001. According to IGN, cheating was prevalent because Phantasy Star Online used a peer-to-peer communication system; Blizzard had had similar problems with Diablo, but after moving to a client-server system for Diablo II, cheating became more difficult. Sonic Team added more quests for players to download, translated into the five languages used in the game. In Japan, a special \\"Fan Cup\\" quest was held from March 23 to April 6, developed with the game magazine Famitsu. In the event, over 70,000 players competed for the fastest time; the winner received a cash prize and a rare game item. As he had with ChuChu Rocket!, Naka played online and was happy to see American and Japanese players playing together using the communication system.  Later releases  = Ver. 2 = In April 2001 Sega announced Phantasy Star Online Ver. 2, an updated version of the original game with new content and improved features, including an increased level cap (to 200), a new difficulty mode for players over level 80, a battle mode that pits players in one-on-one or team battles, a soccer minigame with balls shaped like characters from ChuChu Rocket!, new weapons and monsters, gameplay balance alterations, day and night effects, an improved user interface, and two new areas exclusive to online quests. Ver. 2 also adds a challenge mode, which places teams in a stage with starting equipment and stats; if a teammate dies, the mission ends. Players could import their character from the original game or create a new one; characters registered for Ver. 2 could not be used in the original game. Any illegal items were also deleted during the upgrade. Sonic Team worked a tough schedule to develop Ver. 2 in under six months, releasing it on June 7, 2001 in Japan and September 25, 2001 in North America. Unlike the original North American release, Ver. 2 required subscription fees to play. Three months of unlimited gameplay could be purchased at a time. The game still had no dependencies on SegaNet, however. In Europe, DreamKey 3.0 was required. Ver. 2 was ported to Windows in Japan and released on December 20, 2001. = Episode I & II = ASCII Corporation produced a unique GameCube controller with a keyboard to help players communicate in Phantasy Star Online.On January 31, 2001, following years of losses, Sega announced the discontinuation of the Dreamcast and the restructuring of the company as a third-party developer. In May, Sega announced an expanded GameCube port of Phantasy Star Online, which became Phantasy Star Online: Episode I & II. The GameCube was chosen because it had similar architecture to the Dreamcast, and because it supported dial-up, which Sega still believed was important despite the approach of broadband internet. Sonic Team created a GameCube demo of Phantasy Star Online within a month. To make the game more viable for Nintendo's family-oriented consumers, Sonic Team added a split-screen multiplayer mode. Since the GameCube had no out-of-the-box network capabilities, Nintendo developed a modem and broadband adapter, likely primarily for Phantasy Star Online support, and sold them separately. The servers were maintained by Sega. GameCube players could not play with Dreamcast players. Phantasy Star Online: Episode I & II comprises two \\"episodes\\": Episode I is a port of Ver 2 with improved graphics, whereas Episode II comprises entirely new content, which Naka described as a true sequel. The game adds characters, environments, quests, a split-screen mode, and updated graphics and interfaces. Some quests reward players with minigames based on Sonic Team games Puyo Pop and Nights into Dreams, which can be played on a Game Boy Advance connected to the GameCube. A Chao resembling Tails, a character from the Sonic games, can be imported into Sonic Advance and Sonic Adventure 2 Battle. Sonic Team ran a beta trial for some players who had pre- ordered Episode I & II, starting on May 31, 2002. The game sold 70,000 copies within the first month in Japan, and by October had sold over 100,000 copies. It was released in North America in October, and in Europe on March 7, 2003. Like Ver. 2, Episode I & II required a paid monthly subscription. ASCII Corporation developed a keyboard controller specifically for the game, released only in Japan, though plans were announced for a keyboard controller to be released in America. Some players resorted to importing the controller from Japan. An enhanced version of the game, Episode I & II Plus, was released for the GameCube later. This version included many quests originally distributed exclusively online, a new challenge mode, and new items. Episode I & II was ported to Xbox on April 15, 2003. The game servers were hosted through Xbox Live and did not interface with the GameCube or Dreamcast servers. Because of its Xbox Live foundation, the Xbox version supports voice chat but did not connect players across regions. The game required an Xbox Live account to play online or offline; as the game was packaged with Xbox Live in Japan, to localize the game quickly, Microsoft did not remove the limitation. In addition to Xbox Live fees, Sega charged players an extra subscription fee to play online. = Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution = In 2003, Sega announced Episode III: C.A.R.D. Revolution. The game is a sequel to the story presented in Episode I & II, but replaces the action RPG gameplay with a turn-based strategy card game; after developing Episode I & II, Sonic Team thought that players may want a new experience. Players of Episode I & II and Episode III can chat and interact in common lobbies, but cannot enter game instances together. The online servers for the game shut down at the same time as the GameCube Servers for Episode I & II. = Blue Burst = A new version for Windows, Phantasy Star Online: Blue Burst, was released in Japan on July 15, 2004. It is a port of Episode I & II with another episode of new content. It features enhancements including a system allowing players to communicate across different servers; the most significant change is that the game is online-only, with user data stored on the servers, reducing cheating. In January 2005, Blue Burst was released in China, Sega's first online game there. It was released in beta in North America in May 2005, and fully in June. = Server status = The North American Dreamcast servers operated until September 30, 2003. The North American and Japanese GameCube servers as well as the Japanese Dreamcast servers were shut down on March 30, 2007, following a month of free service. The Japanese Xbox servers were shut down on January 31, 2007, and the North American servers followed on April 22, a week earlier than the announced date of April 30. The North American and European Blue Burst servers were shut down following a free period lasting from January 12, 2008 until the server's closing on March 31, 2008. This was followed by the shutdown of the Japanese Blue Burst servers on December 27, 2010, the last official Sega servers. Hobbyists have developed private servers, and so the game retains a cult following and can still be played online. Reception Phantasy Star Online received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews per ratings aggregator Metacritic. Dreamcast Magazine (Japan) wrote that the cooperative play was an interesting shift from a trend in multiplayer games being mostly competitive. Edge agreed, writing that the variety of gameplay experiences shared with other players kept the game fresh. Spanish magazine Dream Planet and GameSpot praised how the players can take on different roles in the teams, such as a supporting healer or ranged attacker. IGN commended the extensive amount of equipment and items for eliciting friendly competition to collect them. The chat system was also praised for making communication easy, especially between players speaking different languages. Critics agreed that the single-player mode was boring compared to the addictive online multiplayer. GameSpot and GameSpy wrote that it lacked life and became tedious and repetitive when played alone, and GameSpot advised players not to try the game unless they were planning to play online. Other common complaints included poor camera control, the lack of map and quest variety, and poor storyline. Despite the concerns, critics agreed that the fun had in online multiplayer overshadowed these problems. Edge wrote that the changes in gameplay experiences with different players replaced the variety that normally be expected in the quest design. Critics also praised the freedom for players to design and equip characters and develop their own playing style. Computer and Video Games wrote that \\"PSO marks a step in a new direction for console adventures and there's so much right with the game that to even mention these faults doesn't quite feel in the spirit of what PSO represents\\". Reviewing Ver. 2, Dreamcast Magazine (UK) felt that it would renew interest in the game for those that enjoyed it, but would not convert new players. GameSpot and IGN agreed, saying that the core gameplay remained the same, but the new features may be worthwhile for dedicated players, even with the new subscription costs. Reviewing Episode I & II, critics praised the split-screen mode, Game Boy Advance downloads, graphics improvements, and gameplay tweaks. GameSpot wrote that the new material in Episode II was not significant enough for veteran players to return, and criticized some practical issues with how split-screen multiplayer was handled. Eurogamer criticized the cost for a network adapter, subscription fees, and the \\"almost obligatory\\" keyboard. Several critics complained about the lack of a keyboard available in the Americas. Legacy Promotion for Phantasy Star Online 2 at Tokyo Game Show 2017 As the first online role-playing game for home consoles, Phantasy Star Online is considered a landmark game. It won several awards, including Japan Game Award for \\"Game of the Year\\", awarded three days after the death of Sega chairman Okawa. VentureBeat dubbed it \\"one of the most important games in console gaming evolution\\". IGN named it one of the best RPGs of all time for being the first online experience for many gamers. 1UP.com called Phantasy Star Online one of the most revolutionary games of the 2000s, crediting it for creating \\"an entire pantheon of multiplayer dungeon crawlers that continue to dominate the Japanese sales charts\\" and making \\"both online gaming and the concept of fee- based services a reality for consoles\\". Hiroshi Matsuyama, president of CyberConnect2 and developer of the .hack series, cited the game as an influence. It is also believed to be a major influence on Capcom's Monster Hunter series. According to GamesTM, the Phantasy Star series has struggled to live up to the legacy of Phantasy Star Online. Sega has been slow to localize Phantasy Star games, and the PSP entries in the series did not capture the attention of the west. Concurrently, Monster Hunter had a similar formula to Phantasy Star Online and became successful. Later games in the Phantasy Star series, such as Phantasy Star Universe (2006), share similar gameplay with Phantasy Star Online but failed to reach the same critical and commercial success. Phantasy Star Online 2 was released in Japan in 2012. A western localization is planned for 2020.

The conference took place between September 1 through 9, 1864. The Charlottetown Conference, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=8 The conference had been planned as a meeting of representatives from the Maritime colonies; Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Newfoundland agreed with the movement, but was not notified in time to take part in the proceedings. Britain encouraged a Maritime Union between these colonies, hoping that they would then become less economically and politically dependent on the Crown, and provide for greater economic and military power for the region in light of the American Civil War.The Charlottetown Conference, Dictionary of Canadian Biography, http://biographi.ca/en/theme_conferences_1864.html?p=8 However, another colony, the Province of Canada, comprising present-day Ontario and Qu√©bec, heard news of the planned conference and asked that the agenda be expanded to discuss a union that would also include them. In August 1864 Newfoundland also asked to be allowed to join the conference. Coincidentally there was a circus in Charlottetown during the conference, and it was much more interesting to the majority of the population. At the very least, the circus made making accommodations for all the delegates difficult, since there had not been a circus in Prince Edward Island in over 20 years. There was no one working at the public wharf at the foot of Great George Street when the Canadian delegates arrived on the steamship SS Victoria, so Prince Edward Island representative William Henry Pope had to handle receptions by himself, including rowing out to greet the new arrivals. Owing to the unexpectedly large number of visitors in the city, a sizable proportion of the Canadian delegates remained aboard the Queen Victoria while others found accommodations at the Franklin. Meanwhile, circus-goers and the Maritime delegates had taken up the accommodations in town. Conference The majority of the conference took place at the colony's legislative building, Province House, although some social functions such as dinners and banquets were held at other venues including Government House and Inkerman House, the home of the colony's Lieutenant Governor John Hamilton Gray. The conference had begun on Thursday September 1 with a banquet for the delegates. Parties and banquets were held each night after the day's discussions had ended, except for Sunday September 4, when they did not meet. The representatives from the Province of Canada dominated the conference, overshadowing the concerns of the Maritimes, and laying out foundations for the union that benefited them the most. Four of the first five days were spent outlining the Canadian position, and the Maritime representatives did not discuss their own plans until September 6 and 7. One Canadian delegate, George Brown, spent two days discussing the details of the proposed constitution, which would keep Canada within the British Empire. Most of the Maritimes were convinced that a wider union including the Province of Canada would also be beneficial to them; Prince Edward Island was unsure, however, and very much against confederation. The delegates also believed that union could be achieved within a few years, rather than in an undefined period in the future as they had originally planned. The conference concluded on Wednesday September 7, but the representatives agreed to meet again the next month in Quebec City (see Quebec Conference). A ball was also held on September 8, after which the delegates returned home. In addition to political meetings, The delegates participated in social activities like special lunches, small boating trips, and a ball, which gave delegates the opportunity to bond.

Metroid Prime is the fifth main installment in the Metroid series, and the first Metroid game to use 3D computer graphics being played from the first-person perspective. Because exploration takes precedence over combat, Nintendo classifies the game as a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. It was released in North America in November 2002, and in Japan and Europe the following year. On the same day as its North American release, Nintendo also released the Game Boy Advance game Metroid Fusion, marking the return of the Metroid series after an eight-year hiatus following Super Metroid (1994). Metroid Prime is the first of the three-part Prime storyline, which takes place between the original Metroid and Metroid II: Return of Samus. Like previous games in the series, Metroid Prime has a science fiction setting in which players control the bounty hunter Samus Aran. The story follows Samus as she battles the Space Pirates and their biological experiments on the planet Tallon IV. The game was a collaboration between Retro's staff in Austin, Texas, and Japanese Nintendo employees, including producer Shigeru Miyamoto, who suggested the project after visiting Retro's headquarters in 2000. The game garnered critical praise and commercial success, selling more than a million units in North America alone. It won a number of Game of the Year awards, and it is considered by many critics and gamers to be one of the greatest video games ever made, remaining one of the highest-rated games on Metacritic. In 2009, an enhanced version was released for the Wii as a standalone game in Japan, and as part of the Metroid Prime: Trilogy compilation internationally.  Gameplay  Samus in battle with a Flying Pirate. The player is controlled from a first-person perspective. Metroid Prime is a 3D action-adventure game in which players control series protagonist Samus Aran from a first-person perspective, unlike previous games of the Metroid series, with third-person elements used for Morph Ball mode. The gameplay involves solving puzzles to reveal secrets, platform jumping, and shooting foes with the help of a \\"lock-on\\" mechanism that allows circle strafing while staying aimed at the enemy. Samus must travel through the world of Tallon IV searching for twelve Chozo Artifacts that will open the path to the Phazon meteor impact crater, while collecting power-ups that let her reach new areas. The Varia Suit, for example, protects Samus' armor against high temperatures, allowing her to enter volcanic regions. Some items are obtained after boss fights. Items must be collected in a specific order; for example, players cannot access certain areas until they find a certain Beam to open doors, or discover new ordnance with which to beat bosses. Players are incentivized to explore to find upgrades such as ammunition packs and extra health. The heads-up display, which simulates the inside of Samus' helmet, features a radar display, a map, ammunition for missiles, a health meter, a danger meter for negotiating hazardous landscape or materials, and a health bar and name display for bosses. The display can be altered by exchanging visors; one uses thermal imaging, another has x-ray vision, and another features a scanner that searches for enemy weaknesses and interfaces with mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. The game introduces a hint system that provides the player with clues about ways to progress through the game. Players can gain two features by connecting Prime with Metroid Fusion using a GameCube ‚Äì Game Boy Advance link cable: cosmetic use of the Fusion Suit that Samus wears in Fusion and the ability to play the original Metroid game. = Items = While Samus is in Morph Ball form, the view changes to a alt=A metallic ball stands in a futuristic corridor, with sparks of electricity in the background. Atop the image is a bar and a number indicating the health of the player, and three round icons indicating the remaining bombs. Throughout the game, players must find and collect items that improve Samus's arsenal and suit, including weapons, armor upgrades for Samus's Power Suit and items that grant abilitiesincluding the Morph Ball, which allows Samus to compress herself into a ball in order to roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs, and the Grapple Beam, which works by latching onto special hooks called grapple points, allowing Samus to swing across gaps. Unlike those in earlier games in the series, the beam weapons in Metroid Prime have no stacking ability, in which the traits of each beam merge. Instead, the player must cycle the four beam weapons; there are charge combos with radically different effects for each. Other upgrades include boots that allow Samus to double-jump and a Spider Ball upgrade that allows her to climb magnetic rails. Items from previous Metroid games appear with altered functions. Art galleries and different endings are unlockable if the player collects a high percentage of items and Scan Visor logs. Prime is one of the first Metroid games to address the reason Samus does not start with power-ups acquired in previous games; she begins the game with some upgrades, including the Varia Suit, Missiles and Grapple Beam, but they are lost during an explosion on the Space Pirate frigate Orpheon. The producers stated that starting with some power-ups was a way to give the player \\"different things to do\\" and to learn the functions of these items before settling into the core gameplay.  Synopsis  = Background and setting = Metroid Prime is the first of the three-part Prime storyline. Retro Studios wrote an extensive storyline for Metroid Prime, which was considered a major difference from previous Metroid games. Short cutscenes appear before important battles, and a scanner in the heads-up display extracts backstory-related information from objects. The Prime trilogy is set between the events of Metroid and Metroid II, but according to some sources, including Brazil's former Nintendo distributor Gradiente and the Nintendo Power comics adaptation of Metroid Prime, the events in the Prime games occur after Super Metroid. The Brazilian publicity states that the Phazon meteor is a piece of Zebes, which was destroyed after Super Metroid. However, one of the logbook entries from Metroid Prime 3: Corruption reveals that the meteor was a \\"Leviathan\\" from the planet Phaaze. The game takes place on the planet Tallon IV, formerly inhabited by the Chozo race. Five decades ago, the Chozo race fell after a meteor impacted on Tallon IV. The meteor contaminated the planet with a corruptive, mutagenic substance that the Space Pirates later named Phazon, and also brought with it a creature known to the Chozo as \\"The Worm\\". A large containment field emitter of the Artifact Temple in the Tallon Overworld area was built as a seal to the meteor's energies and influence within the crater where it landed, which the Space Pirates attempt to disable or bypass in order to gain better access in order to extract the Phazon. The containment field is controlled by twelve Chozo artifacts that are scattered around the planet. = Plot = Samus Aran intercepts a distress signal from the Space Pirate frigate Orpheon, whose crew have been slaughtered by the Pirates' own genetically modified, experimental subjects. At the ship's core, she battles with the Parasite Queen, a giant version of the tiny parasites aboard the ship. The Parasite Queen is defeated and falls into the ship's reactor core, initiating the destruction of the ship. While Samus is escaping from the frigate, she encounters a cybernetic version of Ridley called Meta Ridley. During her escape, an explosion damages Samus's suit, causing some of her abilities to malfunction. Samus escapes the frigate and chases Ridley in her gunship towards the nearby planet Tallon IV. After landing in the Tallon Overworld, Samus explores nearby areas of Tallon IV and discovers the Chozo Ruins, the remains of the Chozo civilization. As she explores the ruins, she learns the Chozo on the planet had been killed by Phazon from a meteor that impacted on Tallon IV many years ago. After regaining her lost abilities in the ruins, Samus finds her way to the Magmoor Caverns, a series of magma-filled tunnels, which are used by the Space Pirates as a source of geothermal power. Following the tunnels, Samus travels to the Phendrana Drifts, a cold, mountainous location which is home to an ancient Chozo ruin and Space Pirate research labs used to study the Metroids. After obtaining new abilities, Samus explores the wreckage of the crashed Orpheon and then infiltrates the Phazon Mines, where she learns the outcome of the Phazon experimentation project, including the Metroid Prime, a creature that had come to Tallon IV with the meteor. Advancing deeper into the mines, Samus fights her way through the Phazon- enhanced Space Pirates and obtains the Phazon Suit after defeating the monstrous Omega Pirate. Samus discovers the Artifact Temple that the Chozo built to contain the Metroid Prime and to stop the Phazon from spreading over the planet. To gain access to the meteor's Impact Crater, Samus collects and unites the twelve Chozo artifacts. As Samus returns to the temple with the artifacts, Meta Ridley appears and attacks her. Samus defeats Ridley and enters the Impact Crater, where she finds the Metroid Prime. After she defeats it, the Metroid Prime absorbs Samus's Phazon Suit and explodes. Samus escapes the collapsing crater and leaves Tallon IV in her ship. If the player completes the game with all of the items obtained, the Metroid Prime is shown reconstructing itself into a body resembling Samus.  Development  alt=A series of drawings of a cave complex filled with root-like structures. On the upper right corner are drawings of larva-like creatures. According to producer Shigeru Miyamoto, Nintendo did not develop a Metroid game for the Nintendo 64 (N64) as the company \\"couldn't come out with any concrete ideas\\". Metroid co- creator Yoshio Sakamoto said he could not imagine how the N64 controller could be used to control Samus. Nintendo approached another company to make an N64 Metroid, but the offer was declined, supposedly because the developers thought they could not equal Super Metroid. Metroid Prime was a collaboration between Nintendo EAD and R&D1; and the American company Retro Studios. Retro was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg. The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic. After establishing its offices in Austin, Texas in 1999, Retro worked on four GameCube projects. When Miyamoto visited Retro in 2000, he suggested a new Metroid game after seeing their prototype first-person shooter engine. In 2000 and early 2001, four games in development at Retro were canceled, including an RPG, Raven Blade, leaving Prime the only game in development. During the last nine months of development, Retro's staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach Nintendo's deadline, as according to senior artist James Dargie, \\"I think it took us almost six months to do the first level that Nintendo approved, then we had less than a year to do the rest of the game.\\" Nintendo created the music, Retro handled art and engineering, and both teams worked on the overall design. The Japanese crew, which included producers Miyamoto, Kensuke Tanabe, Kenji Miki and designer and Metroid co-creator Sakamoto, communicated with Retro through e-mails, telephone conferences and personal gatherings. The game was planned to use a third-person perspective, but after Miyamoto intervened this was changed to first-person perspective and almost everything already developed was scrapped. The change was prompted by camera problems experienced by Rare, which was developing the N64 game Jet Force Gemini. According to director Mark Pacini, Miyamoto \\"felt that shooting in third person was not very intuitive\\"; Pacini also said that exploration is easier using first- person. Pacini said that after picking that perspective, the crew decided not to make a traditional first-person shooter. He said, \\"We weren't trying to fit in that genre. We had to break down the stereotypes of what a first-person game is and make a fun Metroid game.\\" Pacini stated that Retro tried to design the game so that the only difficult parts would be boss battles and players would not be afraid to explore because \\"the challenge of the game was finding your way around\\". Senior designer Mike Wikan said that the focus on exploration led the team to spend time making the platform jumping \\"approachable to the player\\", and to ensure the gameplay had \\"shooting [as] a very important, though secondary, consideration\\". Retro developed the storyline under the supervision of Yoshio Sakamoto, who verified that the ideas were consistent with the lore of the earlier games. The developers intended that Kraid, a boss from Metroid and Super Metroid, would appear in Prime, and designer Gene Kohler modeled and skinned him for that purpose, but he was cut for time reasons. The team considered implementing the Speed Booster power-up from Super Metroid but concluded it would not work well because of the first-person perspective and \\"limitations imposed by the scale of our environment\\". The first public appearance of the game was a ten-second video at SpaceWorld 2000. In November of the same year, Retro Studios confirmed its involvement with the game in the \\"job application\\" part of its website. In February 2001, the game was confirmed by Nintendo, which also announced that because of its emphasis on exploration and despite the first- person perspective, Metroid Prime would be a first-person adventure rather than a first-person shooter. In May 2001, the game was showcased at E3 2001, with its title confirmed as Metroid Prime. = Audio = Kenji Yamamoto, assisted by Kouichi Kyuma, composed the music for Prime. The soundtrack contains arrangements of tracks from previous games in the series because Yamamoto wanted \\"to satisfy old Metroid fans. It's like a present for them\\", he said. The initial Tallon Overworld theme is a reinterpretation of Metroids Brinstar theme, the music heard in Magmoor Caverns is a new version of the music from Super Metroids Lower Norfair area, and the music heard during the fight with Meta Ridley is a fast-paced reimagining of the Ridley boss music first featured in Super Metroidwhich has reappeared in most Metroid games since. Tommy Tallarico Studios initially provided sound effects for the game, but Shigeru Miyamoto thought they were not yet good enough for an extended presentation at SpaceWorld 2001. The game supports Dolby Pro Logic II setups and can be played in surround sound. The official soundtrack to the game was released on an album called Metroid Prime & Fusion Original Soundtracks, which was published by Scitron on June 18, 2003. Release Metroid Prime was released for the GameCube in North America on November 17, 2002, and in Japan and Europe the following year on February 28, 2003 and March 21, 2003, respectively. Prime was released for the GameCube in five versions. The original North American and Japanese NTSC versions and the second North American version, which contained minor changes, all used a loader that sometimes caused the game to freeze in specific rooms. The European PAL version resolved these glitches and contained altered elements of the gameplay to prevent sequence breaking, a slower loader that prevented the occasional crashes, slightly different story details, and narration in the opening and closing scenes. Some of these changes were carried over from the PAL version to the NTSC region's Player's Choice re-release, along with additional changes not made in other releases. This version, which was bundled with a silver GameCube, also contained a second disc featuring a preview trailer and a demo for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, a timeline of Metroid games, and an art gallery. =Re-releases= Metroid Prime was rereleased in Japan in 2009 for the Wii as part of the New Play Control! series. It has improved controls that use the Wii Remote's pointing functionality. The credit system from Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is also included to unlock the original bonus content and the ability to take snapshots of gameplay. Internationally, the Wii version was released in Metroid Prime: Trilogy, a single-disc compilation containing Prime, Echoes, and Corruption for Wii. On January 29, 2015, the compilation became available for download from the Wii U's Nintendo eShop.  Reception  Metroid Prime became one of the best-selling games on the GameCube. It was the second best-selling game of November 2002 in North America, behind Grand Theft Auto: Vice City; 250,000 units were sold in the first week of its release. , the game had sold more than 1.49 million copies in the U.S. alone, and had earned more than . It was also the eighth best-selling GameCube game in Australia. More than 78,000 copies were sold in Japan, and Nintendo added the game to its Player's Choice line in the PAL region. Metroid Prime was met with critical acclaim. Electronic Gaming Monthly awarded the game a perfect review score. It won numerous Game of the Year awards and was praised for its detailed graphics, special effects, varied environments, moody soundtrack and sound effects, level design, immersive atmosphere and innovative gameplay centered on exploration in contrast with action games such as Halo, while staying faithful to the Metroid formula. Criticisms included the unusual control scheme, lack of focus on the story, and repetitive backtracking. Game Informer considered the control scheme awkward, Entertainment Weekly compared the game to a \\"1990s arcade game, filled with over the top battle sequences, spectacular visual effectsand a pretty weak plot\\", and GamePro stated that inexperienced players \\"might find it exhausting to keep revisiting the same old places over and over and over\\". In 2004, the video game countdown show Filter said Metroid Prime had the best graphics of all time. Metroid Prime appeared on several lists of best games; it was ranked 23rd in IGN's Top 100, 29th in a 100-game list chosen by GameFAQs users, and 10th in Nintendo Power's \\"Top 200 Nintendo Games Ever\\". IGN named Metroid Prime the best GameCube game, while GameSpy ranked it third in a similar list, behind The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Resident Evil 4. Nintendo Power also ranked Metroid Prime as the sixth-best game of the 2000s. Wired ranked the game 10th in its list of \\"The 15 Most Influential Games of the Decade\\" for popularizing \\"exploration, puzzle-solving, platforming and story\\" among first-person shooters, saying that the game was \\"breaking the genre free from the clutches of Doom\\". Wireds writer continued; \\"This GameCube title took one massive stride forward for first-person games.\\" Metroid Prime also became popular among players for speedrunning; specialized communities were formed to share these speedruns.  Legacy  After Metroid Prime, three more games in the first-person perspective and a pinball spin-off were released. The sequel Metroid Prime 2: Echoes - in which Samus travels to planet Aether and discovers that a Phazon meteor crashed there, creating an alternate reality, and Samus fights a mysterious enemy called Dark Samus - was released in November 2004 for the GameCube. It was followed by Metroid Prime Pinball, a spin-off game featuring the locations and bosses of Metroid Prime, developed by Fuse Games and released in 2005 for the Nintendo DS. The next game released was Metroid Prime: Hunters for the Nintendo DS; its storyline takes place between the events of Prime and Echoes. A demo of the game, titled Metroid Prime: Hunters - First Hunt, was bundled with the Nintendo DS, and the full game was released on March 20, 2006 in North America, and May 5, 2006 in Europe. In its narrative, Samus tries to discover an \\"ultimate power\\" while facing six rival bounty hunters. Hunters was not developed by Retro Studios, but by Nintendo's Redmond-based subsidiary Nintendo Software Technology. The game contains more first-person shooter aspects than Prime and Echoes, with removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and various multiplayer modes. Metroid Primes second full sequel is Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, which closes the Prime series. It was released on August 27, 2007 for the Wii console. In Corruption's story, Samus is corrupted by Phazon after being attacked by Dark Samus, who has become the leader of a Space Pirate group and is sending Phazon Seeds to corrupt planets. Corruptions gameplay differs from that of Prime and Echoes; the assisted aiming is replaced with free aiming with the Wii Remote, and the interchangeable beams are replaced with a stackable upgrade system. A fourth game in the series, Metroid Prime 4, was announced at Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight livestream, and is currently under development for the Nintendo Switch. The game was initially announced to be developed by an entirely new team overseen by series producer Kensuke Tanabe, instead of Retro Studios. Eurogamer reported in February 2018 that Bandai Namco Singapore was working on the game alongside Nintendo and that the project included some staff members who worked on the cancelled Star Wars 1313 game. However, in a January 2019 development update posted on their YouTube channel, Nintendo announced that development of Metroid Prime 4 was restarted and the project would be handled by Retro Studios. Elements of Metroid Prime have appeared in other games, such as Super Smash Bros. Brawl in which the Frigate Orpheon is a playable stage, featuring the Parasite Queen in the background and several music tracks from Metroid Prime as background music. This stage later returned in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Metroid Primes style of gameplay and HUDs also influenced and was compared to later first-person shooters, such as Geist and Star Wars: Republic Commando.

It was the world's third-largest producer of toys in 2008 after Mattel and Hasbro. Some ex-Bandai group companies produce anime and tokusatsu programs. Its headquarters are located in Tait≈ç, Tokyo. History Former logo In 1947, Naoharu Yamashina was working for the company of his brother-in-law, a textile wholesaler. As that segment of the market was becoming weak at the time, he realized the potential of the toy industry. He successfully convinced his brother-in-law to dedicate a portion of the company's activities in that industry and to be in charge of it. Step by step, Yamashina developed a toy distribution empire within the company. On July 1950, Yamashina took full control of the toy distribution business, renamed it and founded the company Bandai-ya (a Chinese phrase meaning \\"things that are eternal\\") whose name was eventually shortened to Bandai in 1961. In its first year, Bandai produced its first internal game, the Rhythm Ball, and its first metallic toy, a reproduction of the B-26. It also began the exportation of toys. As the company expanded, Bandai increased its exports by building a new warehouse outside of Komagata in 1953. Several services were created within the company such as quality control, an R&D; department and a transport division. In early 1955, Bandai founded the subsidiary Waraku Works, a manufacturing facility. During the summer, Bandai moved to new headquarters in Taito-ku, not far from Komagata. The first company logo was created using the initials \\"BC\\" based on the first letters of Bandai Company. At the end of the year, Bandai launched its first product with a guarantee, a mini replica of the Toyopet Crown car. In 1958, Bandai introduced its first television commercial using the slogan ¬´The Red Box means a BC-guaranteed toy ¬ª. In the middle of the following year, the company launched a lineup of mini toys representing car models from all over the world dubbed as \\"Cars of the World\\". The company logo was redesigned to emphasize on the quality of Bandai's products and was known as the \\"Banzai mark\\". In the 1960s Bandai expanded to include international export sales. The management was handed to a new subsidiary created in New York called Bandai Overseas Supply. Bandai's racing car set, which first appeared in 1962, became a huge success. In 1963, Bandai separated the transportation service from the company to become its own subsidiary called Bandai Transport. Due to an increase of activity volume, the company relocated to new offices in Asakusa, Tait≈ç. Bandai launched the toy Astro Boy, based on the character of the animated series. It was the first time Bandai created a toy based on an existing hero. Bandai continued to expand in the 1970s with the creation of several subsidiaries; Tonka Japan in 1970 following a joint venture with Tonka, Bandai Models being established in 1971, and finally Popy, who specialized in the manufacturing of toy characters. Although not their most profitable range, Bandai's 1/48 scale AFV models dominated that segment of the model kit market. Bandai America Inc. was established as local US sales/marketing operation in 1978. Spacewarp, a line of build-it-yourself toy rolling ball \\"roller coasters\\" was introduced by Bandai in the 1980s. In May 1980, Makoto Yamashina, son of the founder, became president of Bandai. Naoharu Yamashina became chairman of the board. Upon his arrival, Makoto Yamashina completely changed the aging staff of Bandai and replaced it with young employees with the intent of not only bringing new ideas, but also revisiting the strategy of the group. The new president took a different commercial approach by selling directly to retailers rather than going through intermediates. In July 1980, Bandai launched the Gundam Plastic Model based on the animated series which gave birth to the Gunpla series. In November, the subsidiary Celent was created. In November 1985, Bandai introduced the first video game based on the manga Kinnikuman: the NES title Tag Team Match: MUSCLE, which sold more than one million copies. Since the 1980s, Bandai has become the leading toy company of Japan, and to this day, has the main toy licenses in Japan to popular properties including Daikaiju, Ultraman, Super Robot, Kamen Rider, the Super Sentai and Power Rangers series (which they took part in creating), Gundam and many others. The management of Bandai and Sega discussed a merger in the late 1990s and voted to implement it, but the merger was later cancelled, citing \\"cultural differences\\", after a large scale protest by Bandai's middle management. Makoto Yamashina stepped down as president immediately afterwards, stating, \\"I feel responsible for the troubles related to the merger.\\" After its merger with game developer and amusement facility operator Namco in 2005, Bandai Company is now under the management and a member of Bandai Namco Holdings (Bandai Namco Group). Following a group reorganisation in 2006, Bandai heads the group's Toys and Hobby Strategic Business Unit (SBU). On February 2018, Saban Brands and Bandai's US division jointly announced a mutual agreement to not renew their Power Rangers master toy license, effective Spring 2019, after which competing toy company Hasbro will inherit the license. This transition will not affect Bandai Japan's Super Sentai master toy license with Toei. A sister company, Bandai Spirits, was established on 15 February 2018. On 1 April 2018, the division of Bandai Co., Ltd that dealt with products for adult customers (including figures and plastic models) as well as Banpresto's prizes business were transferred over to Bandai Spirits. Organization Before the formation of Bandai Namco Holdings, Bandai had many subsidiaries. After group reorganization in 2006, they are managed under several strategic business units (SBUs) of the group. Further detail: =Toys and Hobby SBU= Popy In 1971, Bandai founded its subsidiary company Popy which helped to launch toylines such as Chogokin and Machine Robo.

These titles include Cowboy Bebop, Big O, Outlaw Star, Please Teacher!, Escaflowne, and the popular Gundam, Kamen Rider, Ultraman, and Super Sentai series. Their subsidiaries include the Emotion Music Company Limited, in which the logo is the Moai, a statue found on Easter Island. They now head the Visual and Music Contents SBU. Their North American division, Bandai Visual USA was absorbed into Bandai Entertainment (also a division of Bandai Visual) on 1 July 2008. =Bandai Entertainment= Bandai Entertainment was a subsidiary of Bandai Visual that was involved in the distribution of numerous anime in North America, as well as manga, American-made graphic novels and other merchandising ventures related to anime. Their headquarters in the United States were located in Cypress, California. They had a European subsidiary named Beez Entertainment (also a subsidiary of Bandai Visual) who handled European licensing & distribution rights to their library. The first part of Beez Entertainment's name stood for Bandai Entertainment European Zone, as Bandai Entertainment had operations in Europe. BEEZ Entertainment was based in France. Bandai Entertainment absorbed Bandai Visual's North American division, Bandai Visual USA, at the start of July 2008, and as a result, they were taken over by Bandai Visual, who then became their new parent company (though Bandai Entertainment continued to be part of Bandai). In addition, Bandai Visual also took over Beez Entertainment as their entry into the European market, and Beez Entertainment also continued to be part of Bandai as well. However, Bandai Entertainment is no longer acquiring licences to new anime, and as of 1 March 2013, they are no longer distributing and publishing home video in North America except for some. Also, Beez Entertainment is no longer releasing new anime in Europe. Carddass Carddass is the Bandai subsidiary responsible for releasing trading card games based on popular Bandai franchises. This includes games such as the Gundam War Collectible Card Game based on the Gundam metaseries, as well as a Gash Bell (Zatch Bell!) TCG, Naruto CCG, Rangers Strike (Super Sentai series, Kamen Rider series, Metal Hero series), Neon Genesis Evangelion Ultra Galaxy Daikaijyu Battle (Ultra series) and most recently their most successful to date, the Battle Spirits Trading Card Game. Sunrise =Game contents SBU= Bandai Games (now Bandai Namco Entertainment as of 2015) Bandai Games produced and distributed video games based on Bandai properties including Mobile Suit Gundam: Zeonic Front, Gundam Wing: Endless Duel and Mobile Suit Gundam: Journey to Jaburo. In the early 1990s, Bandai published games for Nintendo in the United Kingdom, including Street Fighter II on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. In the beginning of 2005, Bandai Games opened a United States office as a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandai America which, prior to that, handled the publishing of video games in North America itself. On 31 March 2006, it merged with Namco Ltd. which was renamed Bandai Namco Games Inc. =Motorsports= SC430. In 2006, Bandai entered Super GT with Lexus SC, and won 2006 Super GT Season GT500 Class Round 3 Overall Winner and ranked on fifth place in GT500 Class. Consoles Pippin Atmark During the late 1970s, Bandai sold the TV Jack console line: a series of pong based consoles. The last of the series was the Bandai Super Vision 8000 console released in 1979. It wasn't a simple pong based console system but a cartridge system with an 8-bit NEC D780C (Z80 clone) as CPU. During the early 1980s, Bandai distributed a number of videogame machines. In 1982 the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001, was released in Japan by Bandai. There were also four Japan-exclusive game releases which were the only known Arcadia titles written by other companies than UA Ltd. They also released local variants of the Intellivision and Vectrex game consoles. Bandai has also distributed several consoles from Nintendo to Europe (UK and France) from 1987 including the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. Bandai produced a running mat called the Family Fun Fitness System for the Nintendo Entertainment System starting in 1986. A series of games was released both in the US and in Japan, including Athletic World and Stadium Events for the NES. Shortly after its release, Nintendo purchased the rights to the FFF mat in North America, replacing it with their own redesign, the Power Pad. In order to maintain branding continuity, Stadium Events was pulled from shelves after a short period of availability at Woolworth's stores. Because the game was pulled from shelves and discontinued before many copies were sold, Bandai's Stadium Events is universally accepted as the rarest licensed NES game released in North America. A shrink wrapped copy of the game sold for $41,270 on eBay in February 2010. The sister game to Stadium Events, called Athletic World was initially released with a label that indicated compatibility with the Family Fun Fitness mat, but was later re-released with an updated label that mentions the Power Pad instead. Stadium Events was not released by name again, but instead was slightly modified and relaunched as the Power Pad pack- in game, World Class Track Meet. In the 1990s, Bandai teamed up with Apple to make the Pippin. They also made their own game console, the Playdia. Neither was a mass-market success. In 1999, Bandai created the WonderSwan portable game system. It, and its update, the WonderSwan Color, sold modestly well, but were unable to seriously challenge the dominant Game Boy Color and later, the Game Boy Advance. It was discontinued in 2003. Handheld systems Swan Crystal Bandai has also released a series of handheld game consoles including the WonderSwan, WonderSwan Color and Swan Crystal. The systems were only released in Japan. Bandai has also released a series of LCD games including Tuttuki Bako (released in Japan in 2008) and the LCD Solarpower series (released in the 1980s in both regions).

Two players take turns coloring the edges of an arbitrary graph. One player has the goal of connecting two distinguished vertices by a path of edges of their color. The other player aims to prevent this by using their color instead (or, equivalently, by erasing edges). The game is commonly played on a rectangular grid; this special case of the game was independently invented by American mathematician David Gale in the late 1950s and is known as Gale or Bridg-It.  Rules  Player Cut took 3 turns (dotted edges), player Short took 4 turns (green edges). The game is played on a finite graph with two special nodes, A and B. Each edge of the graph can be either colored or removed. The two players are called Short and Cut, and alternate moves. On Cut 's turn, he deletes from the graph a non-colored edge of his choice. On Short 's turn, he colors any edge still in the graph. If Cut manages to turn the graph into one where A and B are no longer connected, he wins. If Short manages to create a colored path from A to B, he wins. The game always terminates after a finite number of moves, and one of the two players has to win. Either Short, Cut, or the player moving first is guaranteed the existence of a winning strategy on any given graph. The Short and Cut games are a duality; that is, the game can be restated so that both players have the same goal: to secure a certain edge set with distinguished edge e. Short tries to secure the edge set that with e makes up a circuit, while Cut tries to secure an edge set that with e makes up a cutset, the minimal set of edges that connect two subgraphs. Variants Versions of the Shannon switching game played on a directed graph and an oriented matroid have been described for theoretical purposes; but no corresponding commercial games have been published. =Gale= A win for red in Gale In this game invented by American mathematician David Gale and described in Martin Gardner's column in Scientific American Oct. 1958, two grids of differently-colored dots are overlaid at an offset. One player links orthogonally adjacent dots on one grid, and the other player uses the other. One player attempts to link the top of their grid to the bottom, while the other tries to link their left side to the right. The game is equivalent to the Shannon switching game played on a rectangular grid. No draw can result; the first player can always win with correct play. A commercial board game implementing the scheme was marketed in 1960 by Hassenfeld Brothers under the name Bridg-It. The game consisted of a plastic board with two interleaved 5x6 rectangular grids of pedestals (one set yellow, the other red), two sets of 20 each red and yellow plastic bridges, and matching pegs to mount them on. Players alternate placing a bridge across any two adjacent pedestals of matching color until one player connects the two opposite sides of the board marked in the player's color. A variant of the game is described in the instructions: each player gets a limited number of bridges, say 10. If neither player has won when all the bridges are placed, a player in his turn, may reposition one of his bridges until a winner results. The game is long out of production. An electronic implementation of the Game of Gale is available in the Ludii Games Portal. Relationship to other games The Shannon switching game can be seen as a special case of a Maker-Breaker game, in which the winning patterns for the Maker are connecting paths. A weakly-related connection game Hex is played on a grid of hexagons, and has 6-connectivity. Generalized Hex is played on a graph, just like the Shannon game, but instead of coloring the edges, in Hex the players color the vertices. These games have completely different structure and properties. Another connectivity game played with paper and pencil on a rectangular array of dots (or graph paper) is the children's game of \\"dots and boxes\\". Players alternate drawing in a vertical or horizontal line connecting any two adjacent dots. When a line completes a square, the player initials the square. After all the lines have been filled in, the player who has taken the most squares is the winner. An extension of Gale, called Qua, is played by three players on a 3D game board cube composed of a grid of N3 cells. N is an odd number equal to the number of cells along the edges of the game board cube. The initial Qua Cube game board layout and rules are described at its Board Game Geek entry. Computational complexity An explicit solution for the undirected switching game was found in 1964 for any such game using matroid theory. Short should aim for a position in which there exist two disjoint subsets of the remaining unchosen edges such that either of the two subsets would connect the two distinguished vertices. If Short can make a move that results in a position with this property, then Short can win regardless of what the other player does; otherwise, Cut can win. Unlike some other connection games, which can be PSPACE hard, optimal moves for the undirected switching game can be found in polynomial time per move. After removing from the graph the edges chosen by Cut, and contracting the edges chosen by Short, the resulting graph is a minor of the starting graph. The problem of testing for the existence of two disjoint trees, each connecting the distinguished vertices, can be represented as a matroid partitioning problem, which can be solved in polynomial time. Alternatively, it is possible to solve the same problem using network flow algorithms.

A member of the team that developed the first nuclear bomb, he later became a leader in the nonproliferation movement. He also has a place in the history of video games for his 1958 creation of Tennis for Two, the first interactive analog computer games and one of the first electronic games to use a graphical display. Early life Higinbotham was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and grew up in Caledonia, New York. His father was a minister in the Presbyterian Church. He earned his undergraduate degree from Williams College in 1932 and continued his studies at Cornell University. He worked on the radar system at MIT from 1941 to 1943. Career 1958 exhibit of Tennis for Two During World War II, he was working at Los Alamos National Laboratory and headed the lab's electronics group in the later years of the war, where his team developed electronics for the first atomic bomb. His team created the bomb's ignition mechanism as well as measuring instruments for the device. Higinbotham also created the radar display for the experimental B-28 bomber. Following his experience with nuclear weapons, Higinbotham helped found the nuclear nonproliferation group Federation of American Scientists, serving as its first chairman and executive secretary. From 1974 until his death in 1994, Higinbotham served as the technical editor of the Journal of Nuclear Materials Management, published by the Institute of Nuclear Materials Management. In 1947, Higinbotham took a position at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where he worked until his retirement in 1984. In 1958, as Head of the Instrumentation Division at Brookhaven, he created a computer game called Tennis for Two for the laboratory's annual exposition. A tennis simulator displayed on an oscilloscope, the game is credited with being one of the first video games. The game took Higinbotham a few weeks to complete, and was a popular attraction at the show. It was such a hit that Higinbotham created an expanded version for the 1959 exposition; this version allowed the gravity level to be changed so players could simulate tennis on Jupiter and the Moon. Higinbotham never patented Tennis for Two, though he obtained over 20 other patents during his career. He recalled in 1983, Legacy In the 1980s, critics and historians began to recognize the significance of Tennis for Two in the development of video games. In 1983, David Ahl, who had played the game at the Brookhaven exhibition as a teenager, wrote a cover story for Creative Computing in which he dubbed Higinbotham the \\"Grandfather of Video Games\\". Independently, Frank Lovece interviewed Higinbotham for a story on the history of video games in the June 1983 issue of Video Review. In 2011, Stony Brook University founded the William A. Higinbotham Game Studies Collection, managed by Head of Special Collections and University Archives Kristen Nyitray and Associate Professor of Digital Cultural Studies Raiford Guins. The Collection is explicitly dedicated to \\"documenting the material culture of screen-based game media\\", and in specific relation to Higinbotham: \\"collecting and preserving the texts, ephemera, and artifacts that document the history and work of early game innovator and Brookhaven National Laboratory scientist William A. Higinbotham, who in 1958 invented the first interactive analog computer game, Tennis for Two.\\" As part of preserving the history of Tennis for Two, the Collection is producing a documentary on the history of the game and its reconstruction by Peter Takacs, physicist at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Higinbotham remained little interested in video games, preferring to be remembered for his work in nuclear nonproliferation. After his death, as requests for information on Tennis for Two increased, his son William B. Higinbotham told Brookhaven: \\"It is imperative that you include information on his nuclear nonproliferation work. That was what he wanted to be remembered for.\\" For this work the Federation of American Scientists named their headquarters Higinbotham Hall in 1994.

It is a successor to SNK's monochrome Neo Geo Pocket handheld which debuted in 1998 in Japan, with the Color being fully backward compatible. The Neo Geo Pocket Color was released on March 16, 1999 in Japan, August 6, 1999 in North America, and on October 1, 1999 in Europe, entering markets all dominated by Nintendo, competing with Nintendo's Game Boy Color. After a good sales start in both the U.S. and Japan with 14 launch titles (a record at the time), subsequent low retail support in the U.S., lack of communication with third- party developers by SNK's American management, the popularity of Nintendo's Pok√©mon franchise and anticipation of the 32-bit Game Boy Advance, and strong competition from Bandai's WonderSwan in Japan, led to a sales decline in both regions. Meanwhile, SNK had been in financial trouble for at least a year; the company soon collapsed, and was purchased by American pachinko manufacturer Aruze in January 2000. However, Aruze didn't support SNK's video game business enough, leading to SNK's original founder and several other employees to leave and form a new company, BrezzaSoft.http://www.mobygames.com/company/snk- corporation/history History for SNK Corporation Eventually on June 13, 2000, Aruze decided to quit the North American and European markets, marking the end of SNK's worldwide operations and the discontinuation of Neo Geo hardware and software there. The Neo Geo Pocket Color (and other SNK/Neo Geo products) did however, last until 2001 in Japan. It was SNK's last video game console, as the company went bankrupt on October 22, 2001. Despite its failure the Neo Geo Pocket Color has been regarded as an influential system. Many highly acclaimed games were released for the system, such as SNK vs. Capcom: The Match of the Millennium, King of Fighters R-2, and other quality arcade titles derived from SNK's MVS and AES. It also featured an arcade-style microswitched 'clicky stick' joystick, which was praised for its accuracy and being well-suited for fighting games. The system's display and 40-hour battery life were also well received. History =U.S. release and marketing= The U.S. version of the Neo Geo Pocket Color had an exclusive launch on the website eToys in 1999. eToys also sold the initial launch titles in the plastic snap lock cases. The system debuted in the United States with six launch titles (twenty promised by end of year) and retail price of $69.95. Six different unit colors were available: Camouflage Blue, Carbon Black, Crystal White, Platinum Blue, Platinum Silver, and Stone Blue. In its first two months, the NGPC sold a successful 25,000 units. Prior to SNK's acquisition by Aruze, the Neo Geo Pocket Color was being advertised on U.S. television and units were being sold nationwide at Wal-Mart, Best Buy, Toys \\"R\\" Us, and other major retail chains. For the Christmas Holiday season in 1999, SNK spent $4 million on television advertisements that aired on channels including MTV, Comedy Central, Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. By May 2000, the NGPC had a 2% market share in the U.S. handheld console market; although tiny compared to the Game Boy and Game Boy Color, it was enough to turn a profit for SNK USA. =NNGPC= A blue New Neo Geo Pocket Color, a translucent Japan-only variant On October 21, 1999, a redesigned, slimmer version called New Neo Geo Pocket Color was released in Japan, selling at ¬•6800.http://archive.kontek.net/sngp.classicgaming.gamespy.com/news/archive/newsarch_9_1999.htm It is 13% smaller than the original Neo Geo Pocket Color, with dimensions 125 x 73 x 27 mm, and also features improved sound output.http://archive.kontek.net/sngp.classicgaming.gamespy.com/hardware/nngpc/nngpc_specs.htm =Post-Western discontinuation= In June 2000, Aruze (parent of SNK) decided to discontinue all SNK operations outside Japan. As a result, remaining stock was bought back by SNK for repackaging in Asia. SNK were recalling most of the back-stock of systems and games to be flashed and re-sold in Asia where the system would continue to be sold and supported. Some of the back-stock of American NGPC hardware and software began to resurface on the American and Asian markets in 2003. These units frequently appeared bundled with six games stripped of their cases and manuals. Two games often included, Faselei! and Last Blade were never previously released in United States, meaning that they have no U.S.-localized box or manual; however, these titles did receive a European release, incorporating an English translation. Features Closely modeled after its predecessor, the Neo Geo Pocket Color design sports two face buttons on the right hand side of the system, and an eight-direction microswitched digital D-pad on the left. It is horizontally designed like the Game Gear, as opposed to the Game Boy's vertical setup and the WonderSwan's hybrid of both. Upgraded from the Neo Geo Pocket, it has a color screen in the middle. Similar to the Game Boy and its successors, the Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, the Neo Geo Pocket Color does not have a back-lit screen, and games can only be played in a well-lit area. Like the Game.com before it, the Neo Geo Pocket Color uses a CR2032 battery to retain backup memory and keep the clock active, as well as the usual AA batteries to power the system during usage. The Neo Geo Pocket Color has no regional lockout. The link cable for linking systems together The system has an on-board language setting, and games display text in the language selected (provided the cartridge supports that language). Other settings include time and date, and the system can provide customized horoscopes when one's birth date is entered.

Most of the system's games were produced by SNK themselves, featuring well-received titles from franchises such as Fatal Fury, Metal Slug and The King of Fighters. Several large third-party developers also contributed to the system; the most well known of these is Sega's Sonic the Hedgehog Pocket Adventure, a title heavily based on Sonic the Hedgehog 2 that is often considered one of the greatest games produced for the system. Taito contributed a port of their successful arcade game Densha de Go! 2 and Puzzle Bobble Mini, also known as Bust-A-Move Pocket. Capcom worked in conjunction with SNK on several crossover games featuring their characters, including SNK vs. Capcom: Match of the Millennium and the SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash series of games. Namco published a conversion of Pac-Man, which came with a plastic cross ring that restricted the system's clicky stick to four directions; this version is often seen as one of the best home ports of the game to be released. Compile, Data East and ADK also produced ports of Puyo Pop, Magical Drop and Crush Roller respectively. Success published Cotton: Fantastic Night Dreams, a successful port of the arcade game of the same name. Similar to the Neo Geo AES console, Neo Geo Pocket Color games were packaged in large clamshell-like black cases, fitted with bright, colorful cover art on them. As a way to reduce costs, in North America the games were instead shipped in cardboard boxes, a move that has been negatively received due to their generally poor-quality. Japanese games were later released in the same cardboard boxes, while all European releases used the clamshell cases. Towards the end of the system's short lifespan in North America, games were often bundled together in blister packs and sold in stores to clear out inventory, often including previously- unreleased titles such as Faselei!. Reception SNK sold over 25,000 Neo Geo Pocket Color systems in Japan and over 100,000 in Europe by the end of 1999. By May of 2000, the Neo Geo Pocket Color retained a 2% market share in the North American handheld market; although minuscule compared to the Nintendo's Game Boy Color, it was enough to turn a profit for SNK America. Retrospective feedback for the Neo Geo Pocket Color has been positive. USGamer writer Jeremy Parish considers it an important and influential handheld for being a \\"technological bridge\\" between the 8-bit portable era and the Game Boy Advance, and for its \\"clicky stick\\" having been used for modern video game consoles. He praised the game's small library for its quality and wide selection of genres, specifically titles such as SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters Clash, Sonic Pocket Adventure, Magical Drop and Pac-Man, and for the system's build quality being robust and well-built. Parish blamed the system's commercial failure on both SNK's large lack of retail presence and for Aruze acquiring the company in 2000, concluding the article with: \\"Neo Geo Pocket Color's life may have been painfully brief, but it was nevertheless memorable for those who experienced it. Perhaps all the more so for the system's brevity, in fact.\\" Ryan Lamble of Den of Geek felt that the Neo Geo Pocket Color was the best rival to Nintendo's Game Boy Color for its \\"brilliant\\" game library, design and overall quality. Lamble expressed somber towards the system's early defeat in the handheld market, saying: \\"It was a premature end for a system that, although doomed to remain a distant second to the Game Boy, could have forged a great little niche of its own.\\" NintendoLifes Damien McFerran said that both it and the WonderSwan served as some of the most \\"interesting challengers\\" towards Nintendo. He commended the system for its game library and clamshell boxes, hardware capabilities, battery life and lasting legacy on future systems, writing: \\"Like the WonderSwan, the Neo Geo Pocket Color may not have succeeded in its goal of wrestling market share away from Nintendo, but that doesn't automatically mean it was a failure. Many fans will argue that the quality of the software available was far in advance of that on the Game Boy Color, and the fantastic controls, amazing battery life, cool PDA features and excellent screen combine to make a system which is still hard to put down, even today.\\" See also * List of Neo Geo Pocket Color games Notes References 1990s toys 2000s toys Backward-compatible video game consoles Sixth-generation video game consoles Handheld game consoles Discontinued handheld game consoles Color Products introduced in 1999 Products and services discontinued in 2001 Regionless game consoles ","title":"Neo Geo Pocket Color"},{"id":"292762","text":"Spencer may refer to: Names *Spencer (surname) **Spencer family, British aristocratic family **List of people with surname Spencer *Spencer (given name), a given name (including a list of people with the name) Places =Australia= *Spencer, New South Wales, on the Central Coast *Spencer Gulf, one of two inlets on the South Australian coast =United States= *Spencer, Idaho *Spencer, Indiana *Spencer, Iowa *Spencer, Massachusetts **Spencer (CDP), Massachusetts *Spencer Township, Michigan *Spencer Township, Aitkin County, Minnesota *Spencer, Missouri *Spencer, Nebraska *Spencer, New York **Spencer (village), New York *Spencer, North Carolina *Spencer, Ohio *Spencer, Oklahoma *Spencer, South Dakota *Spencer, Tennessee *Spencer, Virginia *Spencer, West Virginia *Spencer, Wisconsin **Spencer (town), Wisconsin *Spencer County, Indiana *Spencer County, Kentucky =Ireland= *Spencer Dock, North Wall, Dublin Characters *Spencer, character in Beyblade *Spencer, character from Final Fantasy Mystic Quest *Spencer family (General Hospital), on General Hospital *Spencer, on Hallo Spencer *Spencer (Pinocchio 3000), from Pinocchio 3000 *Spencer, railway engine in Thomas the Tank Engine *Spencer Hastings, in Pretty Little Liars *Spencer Strasmore, from Ballers *Spencer Shay, from iCarly *Dr. Spencer Reid on Criminal Minds *Ozwell E.

The underlying Christian democracy movement emerged in 19th-century Europe, largely under the influence of Catholic social teaching and Neo-Calvinist theology. Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, though in a number of countries its Christian ethos has been diluted by secularisation. In practice, Christian democracy often advocates centre-right positions on cultural, social, and moral issues and social market economic policies. In Europe, where their opponents have traditionally been secularist socialists, Christian democratic parties are moderately conservative overall, whereas in the very different cultural and political environment of Latin America they tend to lean to the left.

A primary English- language authority on Mexican cooking, Kennedy is known for her nine books on the subject, including The Cuisines of Mexico, which started changing how Americans view Mexican cooking. Her work is the basis of much of the work of Mexican chefs in the United States. Her cookbooks are distinctive because they are based on her fifty years of traveling Mexico, interviewing and learning from cooks of all kinds in the country, and from just about every region. Her documentation of native edible plants has been digitized by National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity. Due to her style of work, Kennedy has been called a \\"culinary anthropologist\\" and has self-identified as an \\"ethno-gastronomer\\". Kennedy has received numerous awards for her work, including the Order of the Aztec Eagle from the Mexican government, and was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire. Life Kennedy was born Diana Southwood in Loughton, Essex, in the southeast of England. Her father was a salesman, and her mother was a schoolteacher who loved nature and wanted to live quietly in the countryside. Kennedy did not attend college because of World War II, instead joining the Women's Timber Corps at age 19. The Corps were a British civilian organization which took over forestry duties from men who had gone off to fight. Kennedy did not like cutting down trees, so she was delegated to measuring tree trunks instead. In 1953, Kennedy migrated to Canada, living there for three years doing a number of jobs, including running a film library and selling Wedgewood china. On a last-minute decision, Kennedy decided to visit Haiti in 1957. There she met Paul P. Kennedy, a correspondent for The New York Times in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. The two moved to Mexico in 1957, and there they married some time later. Kennedy has had no children, but she does have two step-daughters, Dr. Moira Kennedy-Simms and Brigid Kennedy, daughters of Paul P. Kennedy and his first wife, Martha Combs Kennedy. In Mexico, Kennedy became enamored of the food, and has since dedicated her career to its preservation and promotion. However, she still maintains her British accent and takes tea each day. When she is not teaching, she is either writing or working in the kitchen on recipes. She is noted for her brusque, no-nonsense demeanor, having pulled out tape recorders when police have tried to get bribes from her on her Mexican travels. She has visited every state in Mexico, on all kinds of transportation, from buses, to donkeys to her Nissan pickup truck with no power steering (and a shovel to dig it out of the mud). She has traveled to many isolated areas of Mexico to visit markets and cooks to ask about cooking ingredients and methods. In the 1970s, she decided to build her house in Michoac√°n in an area with orchards. The land has allowed her to grow many of her own ingredients. While she is not technophobic, she is against electronic forms of cookbooks, believing in the need to make notes over printed recipes. First exposure to Mexican cuisine During her first years in Mexico City with her husband in the late 1950s, she learned quickly that the best food in Mexico was not in fancy restaurants but rather in markets, traditional family restaurants called \\"fondas\\" and in homes. In addition, she was impressed with what she saw in local, traditional markets. She also came to appreciate that recipes varied from region to region, traveling with her husband when he was on assignment, and he would collect recipes when she could not accompany him. In Mexico City, she asked her friends about cooking these dishes, and was referred to their maids. These maids then encouraged her to visit their villages, which she has done since. Kennedy also began researching documentation on Mexican cuisine, and credits the work of Josefina Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n as a pioneer, who had done similar work collecting recipes by visiting church groups. Kennedy's focus became the food that was not documented, such as that found in villages, markets and homes, eventually to preserve native ingredients and traditional recipes being lost as Mexicans move from rural areas to urban centers. Kennedy began to share what she learned informally among expats and her husband's colleagues when they came to Mexico. This included taking women on tours of traditional markets, including the stands with animal heads, which shocked Americans. When New York Times food writer Craig Claiborne was in town, she tried to give him a book of Mexican recipes, but he refused it, saying \\"I'll only read a Mexican cookbook once you have written one\\".' At the time, Kennedy thought this was a crazy idea. Cooking classes and cookbook writing At the end of 1965, Kennedy and her husband moved to New York City, where he died the following year from cancer. In 1969, Kennedy began to teach classes in Mexican cooking in her apartment in the Upper West Side, with the encouragement of Craig Claiborne. This was the beginning of a decades-long teaching career, which began as her own venture, then in collaboration with other institutions such as the Peter Kump Cooking School in New York, as well as offering Mexican cooking \\"boot camps\\" at her home in Mexico. Her classes focus on the most traditional cooking techniques and ingredients. For example, while most Mexican cooks now use pre-ground corn or corn flour, she insists on teaching students how to soak kernel with lime overnight, remove the skins and grind with lard to make corn dough (masa) . She has had the most success with this since the 1970s, when cooking schools grew in popularity. The work with the cooking classes led to her first cookbook. From her time in Mexico City to her time in New York, she has been supported in her work with Mexican cooking by Claiborne. She did not have experience writing, but after then-poetry editor at Harper and Row, Fran McCullough took one of her classes, she offered to help Kennedy put the book together, eventually collaborating on Kennedy's first five books. To do the first one, Kennedy decided to return to Mexico to do further research. This research, she believes, is what separates her from other cookbook writers is that she has taken the time and effort to explore Mexico and do field research on how the cuisine varies. Her inexperience led to rewriting the book several times but the result was The Cuisines of Mexico, published in 1972. This book became a best-seller and is still one of the most authoritative single volumes on Mexican cooking. It began to change Americans' understanding of Mexican food, expanding it beyond Tex-Mex into the various regional cuisines and dishes, and is the basis of establishing authentic food in the U.S. The 1986 revision of the book is still in print. Since then, she has published eight other volumes on Mexican cooking, a number of which have been translated into Spanish. Her initial influence is the work of Josefina Vel√°zquez de Le√≥n, but credits much of her writing style to the work of English cookbook author Elizabeth David. Kennedy does not consider herself a writer, but rather as someone who documents was she has seen in about fifty years of traveling Mexico, including remote areas, to talk to cooks of all kinds. She finances her own book research and travels, often sleeping in her old Nissan truck. She prefers the food of central and southern Mexico, which is more complex and varied. She has registered a wide variety of edible plants, and include more exotic recipes such as those using brains, iguanas, insects and even whole animals such as oxen. She regularly interviews and cooks with all kinds of cooks, but especially those from rural areas, cooking for family and friends. She even apprenticed in a bakery in Mexico City to learn the all-male trade. Her preference for traditional home cooking means that her books revolve around foods made with corn dough and even has an entire book dedicated to tortillas. Her insistence on field research distinguishes her books for the stories they tell related to food and her travels. It also has led to unconventional formats. The Oaxaca book is not divided by types of dishes but rather the eleven regions of the state. Her work has made her one of the foremost authorities on Mexican cuisine, not only in authentic ingredients and techniques, but the loss and disuse of various ingredients as Mexico shifts from a primarily rural to primarily urban society. One loss is the use of local and regional produce. \\"As far as I can see,\\" says Kennedy, \\"I write oral history that is disappearing with climate change, agribusiness, and loss of cultivated lands. In the past people had a sense of taste and a sense of where they came from. They were conscious of what they were eating and what they consumed and about not wasting.\\" In the introduction of Oaxaca al Gusto, Kennedy writes, \\"Trying to record the ethnic foods as well as the more sophisticated recipes of the urban centers presented an enormous challenge and responsibility ‚Ä¶ I am sure that if I had known what it would entail to travel almost constantly through the year, and often uncomfortably, to research, record, photograph and then cook and eat over three hundred recipes, I might never have had the courage to start the project in the first place.\\" In addition to traveling Mexico, this work has required frequent travel abroad, especially to the United States, where she gives classes and speaks about Mexican cuisine. She starred in a 26-part television series on Mexican cooking for The Learning Channel. She has been an influence in the development of Mexican cooking in the United States and on chefs such as Rick Bayless. She taught Paula Wolfert, who recommended her to her editor. Chefs of Texas and New Mexico that came to prominence in the mid 1980s credit her work as a base for their Southwestern cuisine. However, Kennedy dismisses most chefs doing Mexican food because they have not done the traveling and research that she has and innovate rather than preserve original methods. She criticizes chefs who waste food and who encourage the unnecessary use of plastic, foil, and other items that only get thrown in the trash. She also does not like culinary writers who do not live in Mexico, but question her authority because of her ethnicity. Some of her conflicts have received significant press, citing her throwing chef Rick Bayless out of her car for being \\"brash\\" and her criticisms of Maricel Presilla. Her influence is not limited to the United States as her work has been very well received in Mexico. She has received numerous awards in this country including the Order of the Aztec Eagle, which is the highest Mexican order awarded to foreigners in the country. The National Commission for Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO) has digitalized her research including a vast collection of recipes, drawings and notes both on cooking and native edible plants, resulting in a section of their website dedicated to her . Quinta Diana / Diana Kennedy Center Kennedy permanently returned to Mexico in 1976, initially living in Mexico City. In 1980, she moved to eastern Michoac√°n, about three hours west of the capital after a friend introduced her to the area. There she bought property which she initially called \\"Quinta Diana\\" near the small village of San Francisco Coatepec de Morelos (colloquially known as San Pancho), in the municipality of Zit√°cuaro. Her homestead is on a forested hill at the end of a long dirt road, only accessed by pickup or four-wheel drive. However, this has not stopped a steady stream of visitors from arriving to her cobblestone driveway. Quinta Diana is an ecologically minded establishment. She stated in the book My Mexico in 1998 that she wanted a house built of local materials and live a lifestyle similar to that of her neighbors. This nearly three hectares is almost off the grid, and centers on her adobe home. This home was built by local architect Armando Cuevas, and centers around a large boulder, almost the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, which Kennedy decided not to remove from the site. Around the boulder is an atrium of the open living room, and from it, stairways lead to various parts of the house. In her home she tests recipes according to the seasons, and what is growing on her property. Her cooking spaces consist of an outdoor space with wood-fired grills and adobe beehive-shaped ovens, and an indoor kitchen, which she calls her \\"laboratory.\\" Her indoor kitchen centers on a long, cement counter, which is covered in blue and white tile, with inlaid gas burners. This kitchen is filled with various ingredients and implements including burnished copper and clay pots on the walls, herbs and vegetables in wicker baskets, various varieties of dried chili peppers, and her own condiments, including a pineapple vinegar similar to balsamic. For her table, she has authentic Talavera pottery from Puebla, and near the kitchen window, there are binoculars and a bird book. Her bedroom is upstairs, which opens to her study, filled with books and papers about, and with windows on three sides to look out over the gardens to towards the mountains. Kennedy grows much of her own food organically. She has a greenhouse to grow various edible plants, such as herbs and even coffee. The gardens include grapefruit, apricot and fig trees, chayote vines from Veracruz, and a section dedicated to the corn she uses for masa. Manure is the fertilizer. All the water used on the property is from tanks that collect wastewater, with a patch of land serving as a filter for wastewater. Much of the energy is solar. Since 1980, money from her books and speaking engagements have funded the property and its operations. However, Kennedy has established the Diana Kennedy Foundation to have tax-free status with the Mexican government, and to work on projects focusing on the environment as well as food. Her interest in environment is related to food in the sense that when environment is destroyed, foods disappear. It also has roots in her mother's love for nature and experience with scarcity in wartime England. She has argued against the use of genetically modified seeds, excessive use of packaging and use of bleach for white linens in hotels and restaurants. The Foundation is also geared toward preservation, not only of Mexico's food heritage, but of Quinta Diana, with its immense collection of Mexican cookbooks, other publications and pottery, along with the gardens.

It was first released for the Macintosh, in 1999, after being previewed at Macworld/iWorld the same year by Steve Jobs and Phil Schiller. VGS was created by Aaron Giles. The recompiling CPU emulator was written by Eric Traut.Aaron's Computing History, The Connectix Era Released at a time when the Sony PlayStation was at its peak of popularity, Virtual Game Station was the first PlayStation emulator, for any platform, that enabled games to run at full speed on modestly powerful computer hardware, and the first that supported the vast majority of PlayStation games. It was advertised to run at full speed on the original 233 MHz iMac G3 system (relying on its built-in ATi graphics hardware), and in some cases it was able to run on 200 MHz 604e systems reasonably well. The impact of this product was huge as it changed the available Macintosh game library from a very small, select group to nearly the entire collection of PlayStation games. Graphics could be run full screen, at full speed. Several PlayStation-type hand controllers became available with VGS in mind. The only lacking features were the ability to receive DualShock force-feedback or use light-guns. VGS was initially released for NTSC based PlayStation games but later versions were made for PAL based games. Like the PS1, the system was region locked, and copied games would not work either, although it didn't take too long for the hacker community to release a \\"Mod Chipped\\" version. Versions 1.1 and 1.2 of VGS attempted to make \\"modding\\" more difficult but were soon modified as well. VGS proved to be extremely popular, as it cost less than half the price of a PlayStation and did not require any extra hardware. VGS was later ported to Microsoft Windows. It was slightly less popular there due to competition with other emulators such as bleem!, though it did have better compatibility. Sony perceived VGS as a threat, and filed a lawsuit*United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (2000). Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.; Sony Computer Entertainment America, Inc. v. Connectix Corporation, 203 F.3d 596 (9th Cir. 2000). Accessed online on August 29, 2006. against Connectix for copyright infringement. The case was eventually closed in favour of Connectix, but Connectix was unable to sell the software in the meantime because Sony had been awarded a temporary injunction.http://www.macobserver.com/news/99/april/990423/messagefromconnectix.html Soon thereafter, Sony purchased VGS from Connectix and discontinued it. By then the PlayStation 2 was nearly out and the original PlayStation was at the end of its peak, with people looking toward the next-generation consoles.

It was formed by the merger of the Evangelical Church (formerly the Evangelical Association, founded by Jacob Albright) and the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (New Constitution) (as opposed to the Church of the United Brethren in Christ (Old Constitution), extant without the parenthetical). The United Brethren and the Evangelical Association had considered merging off and on since the early 19th century because of their common emphasis on holiness and evangelism and their common German heritage. In 1968, the United States section of the EUB merged with the Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church, while the Canadian section joined the United Church of Canada. History United Brethren in Christ was an American religious sect which originated in the last part of the 18th century. Though not formally organized until 1800, the roots of the church reach back to 1767. In May of that year, a \\"Great Meeting\\" (part of an interdenominational revival movement) was held at a barn belonging to Isaac Long in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, near the village of Oregon. Martin Boehm (1725‚Äì1812), a Mennonite preacher, spoke of his becoming a Christian through crying out to God while plowing in the field. Philip William Otterbein (1726‚Äì1813), a German Reformed pastor at York, Pennsylvania, (and later of Baltimore), left his seat, embraced Boehm and said to him, \\"Wir sind Br√ºder!\\" (we are brethren!). The followers of Boehm and Otterbein formed a loose movement for many years. It spread to include German-speaking churches supplemented later by English- speaking followers in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and later spread west into Ohio. Pastor Otterbein, returned to Baltimore to the newly organized German Reformed congregation and built a brick Georgian-styled church with a bell tower southwest of Baltimore Town at South Sharp and West Conway Streets, later named Old Otterbein United Methodist Church, which had continued for two centuries in the Brethren denomination before their 1968 merger with the Methodists and is now the oldest active church and building in the city, whose name was also given to the surrounding restored historic neighborhood. By 1800, they began a yearly conference. Thirteen ministers attended the first conference at the home of Peter Kemp in Frederick, Maryland. At that conference in 1800, they adopted a name, the United Brethren in Christ, and elected Boehm and Otterbein as bishops of the conference. The United Brethren Church claims this organization in 1800 as the first denomination to actually begin in the United States. A confession of faith was adopted in 1815 (similar to one written by Otterbein in 1789), and it has remained the statement of church doctrine to the present. In 1841, they adopted a constitution. It has remained mostly intact, being changed only a few times. The ecclesiastical polity of the church is Wesleyan and its theology is Arminian: there is no hard-and-fast rule about baptism. Bishops are elected for four years. The first delegated general conference met at Mount Pleasant, Pennsylvania, in 1815, and adopted a confession of faith, rules of order and a book of discipline, which were revised in 1885‚Äì1889, when women were first admitted to ordination. The United Brethren took a strong stand against slavery, beginning around 1820. After 1837, slave owners were no longer allowed to remain as members of the United Brethren Church. The Evangelical United Brethren churches sustained a strong fellowship with Nazarene (believing) Jews. In 1853, the Home, Frontier, and Foreign Missionary Society was organized. Expansion occurred into the western United States, but the church's stance against slavery limited expansion to the south. By 1889, the United Brethren had grown to over 200,000 members with six bishops. In that same year they experienced a division. Denominational leaders desired to make three changes: to give local conferences proportional representation at the General Conference; to allow laymen to serve as delegates to General Conference; and to allow United Brethren members to hold membership in secret societies such as the Freemasons. The denominational leadership made these changes, but the minority felt the changes violated the constitution because they were not made by the majority vote of all United Brethren members. One of the bishops, Milton Wright (the father of aviation pioneers Wilbur Wright and Orville Wright), disagreed with the actions of the majority. Bishop Wright and other conference delegates left the meeting and resumed the session elsewhere. They believed that the other delegates had violated the constitution (and, in effect, withdrawn from the denomination), and deemed themselves to be the true United Brethren Church. Therefore, the body initially known as the United Brethren in Christ of the Old Constitution, now called the Church of the United Brethren in Christ. The majority branch had 3,732 organizations in 1906 with a total membership of 274,649. The denomination merged with the Evangelical Church in 1946 to form a new denomination known as the Evangelical United Brethren Church (EUB). This in turn merged in 1968 with The Methodist Church to form the United Methodist Church (UMC).  Missionary and educational establishments  This body carried on missions in West Africa (since 1855), Japan, China, the Philippines and Puerto Rico. It had a publishing house (1834) and two seminaries Bonebrake Theological Seminary (1871) at Dayton, Ohio and Evangelical Theological Seminary (1873) in Naperville, IL. The EUB supported several colleges and universities including Otterbein University (1847) at Westerville, Ohio; Plainfield College (now North Central College) (1861) at Naperville, IL; Westfield College (1865) at Westfield, Illinois; Leander Clark College (1857) at Toledo, Iowa; York College (1890) at York, Nebraska; Western Union College (1900), renamed Westmar College (1948) at Le Mars, Iowa; Philomath College (1867) at Philomath, Oregon; Lebanon Valley College (1867) at Annville, Pennsylvania; Campbell College (1864) at Holton, Kansas, and Indiana Central College (later Indiana Central University and now the University of Indianapolis) (1907) at Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1946, with cooperation of three other denominations, it formed the United Andean Indian Mission, an agency that sent missionaries to Ecuador.  Outside the United States  The EUB congregations in Canada joined into the United Church of Canada in 1968, the largest Protestant denomination in Canada formed in 1925 by Presbyterians (70% came in), Methodists, and Congregationalists. In the Philippines, the EUB congregations joined the Philippine Methodist Church, Christian Church (Disciples), Presbyterian Church, Congregational Church, Iglesia Evangelica Unida de Cristo, Iglesia Evangelica Nacional and some segments of the Iglesia Evangelica Metodista En Las Islas Filipinas (IEMELIF) to form the United Church of Christ in the PhilippinesLewis, Charles (May 14, 2011). \\"The split in the United Church\\".

Retrieved from Google Books on December 7, 2010. \\"Tiger Electronics, 980 Woodlands Pkwy., Vernon Hills IL 60061.\\" History Gerald Rissman, Randy Rissman and Arnold Rissman founded the company in 1978. It started with low-tech items like phonographs, then began developing handheld electronic games and educational toys. Prominent among these was the 2-XL Robot in 1992, and K28, Tiger's Talking Learning Computer (1984) which was sold worldwide by Kmart and other chain stores. Tiger also achieved success with many simple handheld electronics games like Electronic Bowling and titles based on licenses, such as RoboCop, Terminator, and Spider-Man. An early 1990s hit was the variable- speed portable cassette player and recorder, the Talkboy (first seen in the 1992 movie Home Alone 2: Lost in New York), followed by Brain Warp and Brain Shift. It also licensed the Lazer Tag brand from its inventors, Shoot the Moon Products, which was born from the remnants of the Worlds of Wonder company. The company's cash cow through much of the 1990s was their line of licensed handheld LCD games. In a 1993 feature on these games, GamePro attributed their success to the following three factors: *Tiger's effective licensing. Director of marketing Tamara Lebovitz stated, \\"We read all the magazines and talk to all the studios to keep on the cutting edge of what's hot with kids.\\" As a fairly small company at the time, Tiger was able to pursue desirable licenses quickly and aggressively. This allowed them to release licensed games while the properties they were licensed from were still at the peak of their popularity. *The low price per game. Tiger handheld games sold for roughly $20 each. By comparison, most handheld games of the time cost over $30, and required a separately sold system (an additional $50 or more) to play it on. *The simplistic, addictive gameplay of the games. While older gamers tended to find Tiger handheld games one-dimensional and boring, for kids aged five to twelve years old, their simple and easy-to-learn mechanics were more appealing than other video games of the time, which were often frustratingly difficult and dauntingly complex for younger children. In the fall of 1994, Tiger introduced a specialized line of their handheld LCD games, called Tiger Barcodzz. These were barcode games which read any barcode and used it to generate stats for the player character. The line was a major success in Japan, where there were even reality shows based around gamers competing to find the best barcodes to defeat other players. Tiger produced a version of Lights Out around 1995. In 1997 it produced a quaint fishing game called Fishing Championship, in the shape of a reduced fishing rod. Another 1990s creation was Skip-It. In 1995, Tiger acquired the Texas Instruments toy division. Tiger agreed to manufacture and market electronic toys for Hasbro and Sega.\\"Company News; Tiger Electronics Gets Texas Instruments Unit.\\" The New York Times. February 11, 1995. Retrieved on December 7, 2010. =Merging with Hasbro= Tiger Electronics has been part of the Hasbro toy company since 1998. In 2000, Tiger was licensed to provide a variety of electronics with the Yahoo! brand name, including digital cameras, webcams, and a \\"Hits Downloader\\" that made music from the Internet (mp3s, etc.) accessible through Tiger's assorted \\"HitClips\\" players. Tiger also produces the long lasting I-Dog Interactive Music Companion, the ZoomBox - a portable 3-in-1 home entertainment projector that will play DVDs, CDs and connects to most gaming systems, the VideoNow personal video player, the VCamNow digital camcorder, and the ChatNow line of kid-oriented two-way radios. They released an electronic tabletop version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire with voice recordings by host Chris Tarrant. Tiger also released an electronic version of The Weakest Link with voice recordings by Anne Robinson. Products =Standalone handhelds= Tiger is most well known for their low-end handheld gaming systems with LCD screens. Each unit contains a fixed image printed onto the handheld that can be seen through the screen. Static images then light up individually in front of the background that represent characters and objects, similar to numbers on a digital clock. In addition to putting out some of its own games, Tiger was able to secure licenses from many of the day's top selling companies to sell their own versions of games such as Street Fighter II, Sonic 3D Blast, and Castlevania II: Simon's Quest. Later, Tiger introduced what they called \\"wrist games\\". These combined a digital watch with a scaled- down version of a Tiger handheld game. In 1995, Tiger introduced Super Data Blasters, a line of sports-themed handhelds. Each featured the contemporary statistics for players in a specific sport, the ability to record new sports statistics, a built-in electronic game for the sport, and typical electronic organizer features such as an address book and calculator. In 1998, Tiger Electronics released 99X Games, a series of handhelds fitted with a dot-matrix screen, allowing a wide variety of backgrounds and different gameplay for a single game. Although running a software program stored in ROM, those systems were dedicated consoles, similarly to the plug-and-play TV games of the 2000s decade. Two systems running the same game could be linked with the included cable to allow two players to challenge each other.Scan of the manual of the 99X Games version of Crash Bandicoot =Cartridge-based handhelds= Tiger made three notable cartridge-based systems. The first was Quiz Wiz, a highly popular interactive quiz game system. Players inserted a cartridge and played using the corresponding quiz book. The second was the R-Zone. It employed red LCD cartridges, much like Nintendo's Virtual Boy, which were projected via backlight onto a reflective screen that covered one of the player's eyes. The third was the Game.com handheld system, which was meant to compete with Nintendo's Game Boy and Game Boy Color and Sega's Game Gear and Genesis Nomad and boasted such novel features as a touchscreen and limited Internet connectivity. It was a commercial failure. =Furby= Hasbro, previously shy of high-tech toys, was interested in the development of the cuddly Furby. With Hasbro's support, Tiger was able to rush through the development process and get the Furby on the shelves for the 1998 holiday season, during which it was a runaway hit ‚Äî the \\"it\\" toy of the 1998 and 1999 seasons. The continuing development of Furby-type technology led to the release of the FurReal line of toys in 2003 and the modern iteration of the Furby toyline in 2012. Brain Family From 1994‚Äì1999, Tiger invented the Brain Family, which are a line of electronic handheld audio games. In 1994, Tiger released the Brain Bash. It has four inner purple buttons and four yellow buttons outside the unit. It features five game modes. Game One is called Touch Command, where the electronic voice issues a command like \\"one touch one\\" and the corresponding player has to press purple one and yellow one. In 1996, Tiger released the Brain Warp. This game is a spherical unit that has six colored knobs sticking out. There were three different revisions of the circuit board of Brain Warp resulting in audio changes and pitch differences. Two revisions were made in a blue base. Revision 2.0 has a different hidden sound sampling mode to the first revision. When Hasbro re-released Brain Warp in 2002, they took the programming from Revision 2.0 and placed it on a new circuit board with an enhanced speaker which reduced the loudness of the device. This game is very similar to Bop It. A voice that was recorded for the game says a color or a number, or a sequence of colors or numbers, or both depending on the game selected, and the correct knob must be shown facing upwards. In 1997, a Star Wars version called Death Star Escape was released. The game order is different and comes with six Star Wars characters. In 1998, Tiger released Brain Shift. This game has six colored LED lights. It is known for its distinctive low pitched \\"Orange!\\" voice which is heard on the last color of a pattern in Stick Shift and in Memory Shift and Who Shifts It? The player has to use the stick shift to follow the voice commands. There is a memory game, and both Brain Shift and Brain Warp have a code buster game where the player has to find a certain number of colors in sixty seconds. Others =Making toys and games for other brands= The company became one of the most prominent producers of electronic toys based on a wide variety of licenses, including Star Trek, Star Wars, Barney & Friends, Arthur, Winnie the Pooh, Franklin, Neopets, Jeopardy!, Wheel of Fortune, Weakest Link, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, Batman Returns, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and Sonic the Hedgehog. In 1996, Tiger produced replicas of the Turbo Man doll which was featured in the 1996 holiday comedy Jingle All the Way. It retained most of the features of the film version, including the disk shooter, boomerang accessory, light and sound jetpack, and a voice box. Despite being advertised as having five phrases in the movie, the actual toy only possessed four. Boogey Ball In 1999, Tiger Electronics released an electronic LED game called Boogey Ball. There were 2 versions of the game released. The first version was buggy and it had issues playing several games (games 2, 3, and 5). In games 2 and 3, the player failed automatically after 20 seconds. In game 5, the light patterns went in different directions and it was harder to play. Also, the game had a loud voice but quiet background music. In version 2.0, all the issues were fixed in the audio and game modes. The gameplay is similar to Pac-Man, in that the player maneuvers a green LED light through a maze of 30 LED lights and has to either avoid the red light or catch the yellow light. The game was known for its Austin Powers and Melle Mel voices; the electronic voice would often say \\"baby\\". When the game was first turned on, it said \\"Oh you turn me on baby, let's boogey!\\" When the player failed, the game said \\"Oh drat!\\". This game was also published by Hasbro. The game also suffered from a glitch: it would become stuck, playing every sound from the game, and pressing the power button would not turn the game off. The cause for this glitch is unknown.  Testing during manufacture  Tiger Electronics and Hasbro are known to include a hidden test mode in all their electronic games. These test modes signal either a sine wave or a square wave as a way of testing the speaker and then play through all of the sounds that are pre-programmed in the device either manually (by pushing a button), or automatic (playing every sound by itself). Games like Brain Warp, Brain Shift, Boogey Ball, and Brain Bash have these test modes, as do tabletop games (such as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire).

(styled as bleem!) was a commercial PlayStation emulator released by the Bleem Company in 1999 for IBM-compatible PCs and Dreamcast. It is notable for being one of the few commercial software emulators to be aggressively marketed during the emulated console's lifetime, and was the center of multiple controversial lawsuits. History Bleem! was a PlayStation emulator designed to allow people to play original PlayStation games on their PC or Dreamcast gaming consoles (the Dreamcast version was called Bleemcast!). It was released in March 1999. The company that developed and commercialized Bleem! initially consisted of just two people, David Herpolsheimer (president) and Randy Linden, but in the commercial phase included Will Kempe, Scott Karol, Sean Kauppinen, Bryan Stokes, James Sinclair, and Paul Chen, later of Rovio Entertainment. =Context= To allow for full-speed emulation on even lower-end computers of what was at the time a current generation console, the authors coded Bleem! in assembly. This allowed them to create precise optimizations. Unlike Connectix's commercial Virtual Game Station, it made use of a PC's 3D graphics hardware for rendering allowing for enhanced resolutions and filtered textures not possible on real hardware. Despite claims of \\"enhanced\\" graphics, bugs plagued bleem! as well, with all but one game (coincidentally titled One) being plagued by major bugs according to bleem's own compatibility charts. Bleem! used low-level memory emulation and other real-mode technology. It did not function on operating systems using the Windows NT kernel, including Windows 2000. In fact, Bleem!'s statement at the time was that Bleem! would never support running on Windows NT-based systems, as Windows 98 was the dominant operating system at the time. Sony, despite having lost its case with Connectix, continued to pursue legal action against Bleem!. Bleem!, financially unable to defend itself, was forced to go out of business. As of 2005, two members of the team were working for Sony: Randy Linden was working for SCEA on porting titles and looking at the possibility of emulation of previous generation titles for the next PlayStation, and Sean Kauppinen was promoting EverQuest II and Star Wars Galaxies for Sony Online Entertainment. =Copy protection= To combat redistribution of the small downloadable emulator, the user had to buy the Bleem!-CD, containing about 35 MB of data: a DirectX distributable and the actual version of Bleem! available at the time of the CD's printing. The rest of the CD was only for copy protection and was impossible to copy by conventional means; nevertheless, the copy protection was cracked within two weeks of the release. Further updates to the emulator were free until the company ceased operation several years later. Sony lawsuit Two days after Bleem! started taking preorders for their emulator, Sony filed suit against them alleging that they were violating their rights and that providing access for PlayStation games to run on non- Sony hardware constituted unfair competition. Ultimately Bleem! won in court and a protective order was issued to \\"protect David from Goliath\\". Sony lost on all counts, including Bleem!'s use of screenshots of PlayStation games on its packaging. The court noted that Bleem!'s use of copyrighted screenshots was considered fair use and should be allowed to continue. Despite the legal victories, the legal fees allegedly forced the company out of business. eBay auctions of some of the company's possessions were held soon after - including a huge library of worldwide game releases used for compatibility testing. Bleemcast!  Comparison: R4: Ridge Racer Type 4, running natively on the PlayStation, and under Bleemcast!, respectively. Bleemcast! is an independently developed commercial emulator by Bleem! that allows one to load and play PlayStation discs on the Sega Dreamcast. It is compatible with most Dreamcast controllers and steering wheels and leverages the Dreamcast's superior processing power for enhanced graphics. It was created by using the MIL-CD security hole found in the Dreamcast BIOS. =History= Originally, Bleem! was planning to have the disc able to run any PlayStation game on the Dreamcast, but due to technical difficulties, they developed the concept of the \\"Bleempak\\", in which the software would boot only 100 specific games each. New Bleempaks would have to be purchased if one game was not available to boot in a Bleempak. Due to the Dreamcast controller's fewer buttons compared to the PlayStation, there were plans to release a Bleem! controller somewhat similarly designed to the PlayStation controller, and a PlayStation-to- Dreamcast controller adapter, which would allow one to use a PlayStation controller on the Dreamcast. As technical difficulties grew further, all these ideas were scrapped, with no \\"Bleempak\\" and no hardware releases. However, they managed to release individual Bleemcast! bootdiscs for three popular games: Gran Turismo 2, Tekken 3, and Metal Gear Solid. WWF SmackDown! was also being planned for a release, but was not completed, while a couple of screenshots of Final Fantasy IX were surfacing during this time, but was never announced as a planned release.digitaltaco. \\"Bleemcast Releases.\\" PlanetDreamcast. Accessed May 29, 2017. http://planetdc.segaretro.org/features/previews/bleem/index.html. As promised from the beginning, the games ran in a 640x480 resolution, as opposed to the PS1's 320x240 resolution, and featured anti-aliasing and bilinear filtering. This drastically improved the games' graphics but also brought out some graphical imperfections that were originally hidden in the lower resolution. =Closure of Bleem!= Although Sony ultimately did not win any of its lawsuits against them, Bleem! had to shut down when the huge court costs became too much for the small company to handle. Bleem! shut down in November 2001, the same year Sega announced that they would discontinue the Dreamcast in North America. Bleem! closed their website with only an image on their front page of Sonic the Hedgehog tearfully holding a flower next to a Bleem! gravestone. The image was later altered and Sonic was removed, possibly to avoid a lawsuit from Sega. =Beta leak= A beta build of Bleemcast! was eventually leaked. Even though it was buggy and incomplete, it would run some PlayStation games, though not all the games it ran would be playable.Bel. \\"Bleemcast Compatibility List.\\" Whip Ass Gaming.

Using this beta, hackers were able to create Bleemed games ‚Äî discs of a PlayStation title with the Bleemcast! emulator built in. ISO images of many of these discs circulate on file-sharing networks. After the leak, Rod Maher, one of the developers of Bleemcast!, made a public statement regarding the beta, providing some insight into the development process. He revealed that the leaked beta predated the beta that had been shown at E3 and that the leaked beta was 30% complete. Maher, Rod. \\" A few words about the beta.\\" DCEmulation.

All three Bleempaks were finally cracked and made available online in December 2009, eight years after their introduction.

Equivalently, a representation is a smooth homomorphism of the group into the group of invertible operators on the vector space. Representations play an important role in the study of continuous symmetry. A great deal is known about such representations, a basic tool in their study being the use of the corresponding 'infinitesimal' representations of Lie algebras.  Finite-dimensional representations  =Representations= Let us first discuss representations of groups acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over the field \\\\mathbb C. (Occasionally representations regarding spaces over the field of real numbers are also considered.) A representation of the Lie group G, acting on an n-dimensional vector space V over \\\\mathbb C is then a smooth group homomorphism :\\\\Pi:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{GL}(V), where \\\\operatorname{GL}(V) is the general linear group of all invertible linear transformations of V under their composition. Since all n-dimensional spaces are isomorphic, the group \\\\operatorname{GL}(V) can be identified with the group of the invertible, complex generally Smoothness of the map \\\\Pi can be regarded as a technicality, in that any continuous homomorphism will automatically be smooth. Corollary 3.51 We can alternatively describe a representation of a Lie group G as a linear action of G on a vector space V. Notationally, we would then write g\\\\cdot v in place of \\\\Pi(g)v for the way a group element g\\\\in G acts on the vector v\\\\in V. A typical example in which representations arise in physics would be the study of a linear partial differential equation having symmetry group G. Although the individual solutions of the equation may not be invariant under the action of G, the space V of all solutions is invariant under the action of G. Thus, V constitutes a representation of G. See the example of SO(3), discussed below. =Basic definitions= If the homomorphism \\\\Pi is injective (i.e., a monomorphism), the representation is said to be faithful. If a basis for the complex vector space V is chosen, the representation can be expressed as a homomorphism into general linear group \\\\operatorname{GL}(n;\\\\mathbb C). This is known as a matrix representation. Two representations of G on vector spaces V, W are equivalent if they have the same matrix representations with respect to some choices of bases for V and W. Given a representation \\\\Pi:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\operatorname{GL}(V), we say that a subspace W of V is an invariant subspace if \\\\Pi(g)w\\\\in W for all g\\\\in G and w\\\\in W. The representation is said to be irreducible if the only invariant subspaces of V are the zero space and V itself. For certain types of Lie groups, namely compact Theorem 4.28 and semisimple Section 10.3 groups, every finite-dimensional representation decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations, a property known as complete reducibility. For such groups, a typical goal of representation theory is to classify all finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the given group, up to isomorphism. (See the Classification section below.) A unitary representation on a finite- dimensional inner product space is defined in the same way, except that \\\\Pi is required to map into the group of unitary operators. If G is a compact Lie group, every finite-dimensional representation is equivalent to a unitary one. Theorem 4.28 =Lie algebra representations= Each representation of a Lie group G gives rise to a representation of its Lie algebra; this correspondence is discussed in detail in subsequent sections. See representation of Lie algebras for the Lie algebra theory. An example: The rotation group SO(3) In quantum mechanics, the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation, \\\\hat{H}\\\\psi=E\\\\psi plays an important role. In the three-dimensional case, if \\\\hat{H} has rotational symmetry, then the space V_E of solutions to \\\\hat{H}\\\\psi=E\\\\psi will be invariant under the action of SO(3). Thus, V_E will‚Äîfor each fixed value of E‚Äîconstitute a representation of SO(3), which is typically finite dimensional. In trying to solve \\\\hat{H}\\\\psi=E\\\\psi, it helps to know what all possible finite-dimensional representations of SO(3) look like. The representation theory of SO(3) plays a key role, for example, in the mathematical analysis of the hydrogen atom. Every standard textbook on quantum mechanics contains an analysis which essentially classifies finite-dimensional irreducible representations of SO(3), by means of its Lie algebra. (The commutation relations among the angular momentum operators are just the relations for the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{so}(3) of SO(3).) One subtlety of this analysis is that the representations of the group and the Lie algebra are not in one-to-one correspondence, a point that is critical in understanding the distinction between integer spin and half-integer spin. =Ordinary representations= The rotation group SO(3) is a compact Lie group and thus every finite-dimensional representation of SO(3) decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations. The group SO(3) has one irreducible representation in each odd dimension. Section 4.7 For each non-negative integer k, the irreducible representation of dimension 2k+1 can be realized as the space V_k of homogeneous harmonic polynomials on \\\\mathbb{R}^3 of degree k. Section 17.6 Here, SO(3) acts on V_k in the usual way that rotations act on functions on \\\\mathbb{R}^3: :(\\\\Pi(R)f)(x)=f(R^{-1}x)\\\\quad R\\\\in \\\\operatorname{SO}(3). The restriction to the unit sphere S^2 of the elements of V_k are the spherical harmonics of degree k. If, say, k=1, then all polynomials that are homogeneous of degree one are harmonic, and we obtain a three-dimensional space V_1 spanned by the linear polynomials x, y, and z. If k=2, the space V_2 is spanned by the polynomials xy, xz, yz, x^2-y^2, and x^2-z^2. As noted above, the finite-dimensional representations of SO(3) arise naturally when studying the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for a radial potential, such as the hydrogen atom, as a reflection of the rotational symmetry of the problem. (See the role played by the spherical harmonics in the mathematical analysis of hydrogen.) =Projective representations= If we look at the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{so}(3) of SO(3), this Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{su}(2) of SU(2). By the representation theory of \\\\mathfrak{su}(2), there is then one irreducible representation of \\\\mathfrak{so}(3) in every dimension. The even-dimensional representations, however, do not correspond to representations of the group SO(3). Proposition 4.35 These so-called \\"fractional spin\\" representations do, however, correspond to projective representations of SO(3). These representations arise in the quantum mechanics of particles with fractional spin, such as an electron. Operations on representations In this section, we describe three basic operations on representations., Section 4.3 See also the corresponding constructions for representations of a Lie algebra. =Direct sums= If we have two representations of a group G, \\\\Pi_1:G\\\\rightarrow GL(V_1) and \\\\Pi_2:G\\\\rightarrow GL(V_2), then the direct sum would have V_1\\\\oplus V_2 as the underlying vector space, with the action of the group given by :\\\\Pi(g)(v_1,v_2)=(\\\\Pi_1(g)v_1,\\\\Pi_2(g)v_2), for all v_1\\\\in V_1, v_2\\\\in V_2, and g\\\\in G. Certain types of Lie groups‚Äînotably, compact Lie groups‚Äîhave the property that every finite-dimensional representation is isomorphic to a direct sum of irreducible representations. Theorem 4.28 In such cases, the classification of representations reduces to the classification of irreducible representations. See Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility. =Tensor products of representations= If we have two representations of a group G, \\\\Pi_1:G\\\\rightarrow GL(V_1) and \\\\Pi_2:G\\\\rightarrow GL(V_2), then the tensor product of the representations would have the tensor product vector space V_1\\\\otimes V_2 as the underlying vector space, with the action of G uniquely determined by the assumption that :\\\\Pi(g)(v_1\\\\otimes v_2)=(\\\\Pi_1(g)v_1)\\\\otimes(\\\\Pi_2(g)v_2) for all v_1\\\\in V_1 and v_2\\\\in V_2. That is to say, \\\\Pi(g)=\\\\Pi_1(g)\\\\otimes\\\\Pi_2(g). The Lie algebra representation \\\\pi associated to the tensor product representation \\\\Pi is given by the formula:, Proposition 4.18 :\\\\pi(X)=\\\\pi_1(X)\\\\otimes I+I\\\\otimes\\\\pi_2(X). The tensor product of two irreducible representations is usually not irreducible; a basic problem in representation theory is then to decompose tensor products of irreducible representations as a direct sum of irreducible subspaces. This problem goes under the name of \\"addition of angular momentum\\" or \\"Clebsch‚ÄìGordan theory\\" in the physics literature. =Dual representations= Let G be a Lie group and \\\\Pi:G\\\\rightarrow GL(V) be a representation of G. Let V^* be the dual space, that is, the space of linear functionals on V. Then we can define a representation \\\\Pi^*:G\\\\rightarrow GL(V^*) by the formula :\\\\Pi^*(g)=(\\\\Pi(g^{-1}))^\\\\operatorname{tr}, where for any operator A:V\\\\rightarrow V, the transpose operator A^\\\\operatorname{tr}:V^*\\\\rightarrow V^* is defined as the \\"composition with A\\" operator: :(A^\\\\operatorname{tr}\\\\phi)(v)=\\\\phi(Av). (If we work in a basis, then A^{\\\\operatorname{tr}} is just the usual matrix transpose of A.) The inverse in the definition of \\\\Pi^* is needed to ensure that \\\\Pi^* is actually a representation of G, in light of the identity (AB)^\\\\operatorname{tr}=B^\\\\operatorname{tr}A^\\\\operatorname{tr}. The dual of an irreducible representation is always irreducible, Proposition 4.22 but may or may not be isomorphic to the original representation. In the case of the group SU(3), for example, the irreducible representations are labeled by a pair (m_1,m_2) of non-negative integers. The dual of the representation associated to (m_1,m_2) is the representation associated to (m_2,m_1). Chapter 6, Exercise 3. See also Chapter 10, Exercise 10  Lie group versus Lie algebra representations  =Overview= In many cases, it is convenient to study representations of a Lie group by studying representations of the associated Lie algebra. In general, however, not every representation of the Lie algebra comes from a representation of the group. This fact is, for example, lying behind the distinction between integer spin and half-integer spin in quantum mechanics. On the other hand, if G is a simply connected group, then a theorem Theorem 5.6 says that we do, in fact, get a one-to-one correspondence between the group and Lie algebra representations. Let be a Lie group with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g, and assume that a representation \\\\pi of \\\\mathfrak g is at hand. The Lie correspondence may be employed for obtaining group representations of the connected component of the . Roughly speaking, this is effected by taking the matrix exponential of the matrices of the Lie algebra representation. A subtlety arises if is not simply connected. This may result in projective representations or, in physics parlance, multi-valued representations of . These are actually representations of the universal covering group of . These results will be explained more fully below. The Lie correspondence gives results only for the connected component of the groups, and thus the other components of the full group are treated separately by giving representatives for matrices representing these components, one for each component. These form (representatives of) the zeroth homotopy group of . For example, in the case of the four-component Lorentz group, representatives of space inversion and time reversal must be put in by hand. Further illustrations will be drawn from the representation theory of the Lorentz group below. =The exponential mapping= Sophus Lie, the originator of Lie theory. The theory of manifolds was not discovered in Lie's time, so he worked locally with subsets of \\\\R^n. The structure would today be called a local group. If G is a Lie group with Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g, then we have the exponential map from \\\\mathfrak g to G, written as :X\\\\mapsto e^X,\\\\quad X\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g. If G is a matrix Lie group, the expression e^X can be computed by the usual power series for the exponential. In any Lie group, there exist neighborhoods U of the identity in G and V of the origin in \\\\mathfrak g with the property that every g in U can be written uniquely as g=e^X with X\\\\in V. That is, the exponential map has a local inverse. In most groups, this is only local; that is, the exponential map is typically neither one-to-one nor onto. = Lie algebra representations from group representations = It is always possible to pass from a representation of a Lie group to a representation of its Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}. If is a group representation for some vector space , then its pushforward (differential) at the identity, or Lie map, \\\\pi : \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\text{End} V is a Lie algebra representation. It is explicitly computed using, Theorem 3.28 A basic property relating \\\\Pi and \\\\pi involves the exponential map:, Theorem 3.28 :\\\\Pi(e^X)=e^{\\\\pi(X)}. The question we wish to investigate is whether every representation of \\\\mathfrak g arises in this way from representations of the group G. As we shall see, this is the case when G is simply connected. = Group representations from Lie algebra representations = The main result of this section is the following:, Theorem 5.6 :Theorem: If G is simply connected, then every representation \\\\pi of the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g of G comes from a representation \\\\Pi of G itself. From this we easily deduce the following: :Corollary: If G is connected but not simply connected, every representation \\\\pi of \\\\mathfrak g comes from a representation \\\\Pi of \\\\tilde G, the universal cover of G. If \\\\pi is irreducible, then \\\\Pi descends to a projective representation of G. A projective representation is one in which each \\\\Pi(g),\\\\,g\\\\in G, is defined only up to multiplication by a constant. In quantum physics, it is natural to allow projective representations in addition to ordinary ones, because states are really defined only up to a constant. (That is to say, if \\\\psi is a vector in the quantum Hilbert space, then c\\\\psi represents the same physical state for any constant c.) Every finite-dimensional projective representation of a connected Lie group G comes from an ordinary representation of the universal cover \\\\tilde G of G., Section 16.7.3 Conversely, as we will discuss below, every irreducible ordinary representation of \\\\tilde G descends to a projective representation of G. In the physics literature, projective representations are often described as multi-valued representations (i.e., each \\\\Pi(g) does not have a single value but a whole family of values). This phenomenon is important to the study of fractional spin in quantum mechanics. Here is a finite-dimensional vector space, is the set of all invertible linear transformations on and \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) is its Lie algebra. The maps and are Lie algebra and group representations respectively, and is the exponential mapping. The diagram commutes only up to a sign if is projective. We now outline the proof of the main results above. Suppose \\\\pi : \\\\mathfrak{g} \\\\to \\\\mathfrak{gl}(V) is a representation of \\\\mathfrak g on a vector space . If there is going to be an associated Lie group representation \\\\Pi, it must satisfy the exponential relation of the previous subsection. Now, in light of the local invertibility of the exponential, we can define a map \\\\Pi from a neighborhood U of the identity in G by this relation: :\\\\Pi(e^X)=e^{\\\\pi(X)},\\\\quad g=e^X\\\\in U. A key question is then this: Is this locally defined map a \\"local homomorphism\\"? (This question would apply even in the special case where the exponential mapping is globally one-to-one and onto; in that case, \\\\Pi would be a globally defined map, but it is not obvious why \\\\Pi would be a homomorphism.) The answer to this question is yes: \\\\Pi is a local homomorphism, and this can be established using the Baker‚ÄìCampbell‚ÄìHausdorff formula., Proposition 5.9 If G is connected, then every element of G is at least a product of exponentials of elements of \\\\mathfrak g. Thus, we can tentatively define \\\\Pi globally as follows. Note, however, that the representation of a given group element as a product of exponentials is very far from unique, so it is very far from clear that \\\\Pi is actually well defined. To address the question of whether \\\\Pi is well defined, we connect each group element g\\\\in G to the identity using a continuous path. It is then possible to define \\\\Pi along the path, and to show that the value of \\\\Pi(g) is unchanged under continuous deformation of the path with endpoints fixed. If G is simply connected, any path starting at the identity and ending at g can be continuously deformed into any other such path, showing that \\\\Pi(g) is fully independent of the choice of path. Given that the initial definition of \\\\Pi near the identity was a local homomorphism, it is not difficult to show that the globally defined map is also a homomorphism satisfying ., Theorem 5.10 If G is not simply connected, we may apply the above procedure to the universal cover \\\\tilde G of G. Let p:\\\\tilde G\\\\rightarrow G be the covering map. If it should happen that the kernel of \\\\Pi:\\\\tilde G\\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{GL}(V) contains the kernel of p, then \\\\Pi descends to a representation of the original group G. Even if this is not the case, note that the kernel of p is a discrete normal subgroup of \\\\tilde G, which is therefore in the center of \\\\tilde G. Thus, if \\\\pi is irreducible, Schur's lemma implies that the kernel of p will act by scalar multiples of the identity. Thus, \\\\Pi descends to a projective representation of G, that is, one that is defined only modulo scalar multiples of the identity. A pictorial view of how the universal covering group contains all such homotopy classes, and a technical definition of it (as a set and as a group) is given in geometric view. For example, when this is specialized to the doubly connected , the universal covering group is \\\\text{SL}(2,\\\\Complex), and whether its corresponding representation is faithful decides whether is projective.  Classification in the compact case  If G is a connected compact Lie group, its finite-dimensional representations can be decomposed as direct sums of irreducible representations. Theorems 4.28 The irreducibles are classified by a \\"theorem of the highest weight.\\" We give a brief description of this theory here; for more details, see the articles on representation theory of a connected compact Lie group and the parallel theory classifying representations of semisimple Lie algebras. Let T be a maximal torus in G. By Schur's lemma, the irreducible representations of T are one dimensional. These representations can be classified easily and are labeled by certain \\"analytically integral elements\\" or \\"weights.\\" If \\\\Sigma is an irreducible representation of G, the restriction of \\\\Sigma to T will usually not be irreducible, but it will decompose as a direct sum of irreducible representations of T, labeled by the associated weights. (The same weight can occur more than once.) For a fixed \\\\Sigma, one can identify one of the weights as \\"highest\\" and the representations are then classified by this highest weight. An important aspect of the representation theory is the associated theory of characters. Here, for a representation \\\\Sigma of G, the character is the function :\\\\chi_G:G\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathbb{C} given by :\\\\chi_G(g)=\\\\operatorname{trace}(\\\\Sigma(g)). Two representations with the same character turn out to be isomorphic. Furthermore, the Weyl character formula gives a remarkable formula for the character of a representation in terms of its highest weight. Not only does this formula gives a lot of useful information about the representation, but it plays a crucial role in the proof of the theorem of the highest weight.  Unitary representations on Hilbert spaces  Let V be a complex Hilbert space, which may be infinite dimensional, and let U(V) denote the group of unitary operators on V. A unitary representation of a Lie group G on V is a group homomorphism \\\\Pi:G\\\\rightarrow U(V) with the property that for each fixed v\\\\in V, the map :g\\\\mapsto \\\\Pi(g)v is a continuous map of G into V. = Finite-dimensional unitary representations = If the Hilbert space V is finite-dimensional, there is an associated representation \\\\pi of the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g of G. If G is connected, then the representation \\\\Pi of G is unitary if and only if \\\\pi(X) is skew-self-adjoint for each X\\\\in\\\\mathfrak g. Proposition 4.8 If G is compact, then every representation \\\\Pi of G on a finite-dimensional vector space V is \\"unitarizable,\\" meaning that it is possible to choose an inner product on V so that each \\\\Pi(g),\\\\, g\\\\in G is unitary. proof of Proposition 4.28 = Infinite-dimensional unitary representations = If the Hilbert space V is allowed to be infinite dimensional, the study of unitary representations involves a number of interesting features that are not present in the finite dimensional case. For example, the construction of an appropriate representation of the Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak g becomes technically challenging. One setting in which the Lie algebra representation is well understood is that of semisimple (or reductive) Lie groups, where the associated Lie algebra representation forms a (g,K)-module. Examples of unitary representations arise in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, but also in Fourier analysis as shown in the following example. Let G=\\\\mathbb R, and let the complex Hilbert space V be L^2(\\\\mathbb R). We define the representation \\\\psi:\\\\mathbb R\\\\rightarrow U(L^2(\\\\mathbb R)) by :[\\\\psi(a)(f)](x)=f(x-a). Here are some important examples in which unitary representations of a Lie group have been analyzed. * The Stone‚Äìvon Neumann theorem can be understood as giving a classification of the irreducible unitary representations of the Heisenberg group. * Wigner's classification for representations of the Poincar√© group plays a major conceptual role in quantum field theory by showing how the mass and spin of particles can be understood in group-theoretic terms. * The representation theory of SL(2,R) was worked out by V. Bargmann and serves as the prototype for the study of unitary representations of noncompact semisimple Lie groups. Projective representations In quantum physics, one is often interested in projective unitary representations of a Lie group G. The reason for this interest is that states of a quantum system are represented by vectors in a Hilbert space \\\\mathbf H‚Äîbut with the understanding that two states differing by a constant are actually the same physical state. The symmetries of the Hilbert space are then described by unitary operators, but a unitary operator that is a multiple of the identity does not change the physical state of the system. Thus, we are interested not in ordinary unitary representations‚Äîthat is, homomorphisms of G into the unitary group U(\\\\mathbf H)‚Äîbut rather in projective unitary representations‚Äîthat is, homomorphisms of G into the projective unitary group :PU(\\\\mathbf H):=U(\\\\mathbf H)/\\\\\\\\{e^{i\\\\theta}I\\\\\\\\}. To put it differently, for a projective representation, we construct a family of unitary operators \\\\rho(g),\\\\,\\\\, g\\\\in G, where it is understood that changing \\\\rho(g) by a constant of absolute value 1 is counted as \\"the same\\" operator. The operators \\\\rho(g) are then required to satisfy the homomorphism property up to a constant: :\\\\rho(g)\\\\rho(h)=e^{i\\\\theta_{g,h}}\\\\rho(gh). We have already discussed the irreducible projective unitary representations of the rotation group SO(3) above; considering projective representations allows for fractional spin in addition to integer spin. Bargmann's theorem states that for certain types of Lie groups G, irreducible projective unitary representations of G are in one- to-one correspondence with ordinary unitary representations of the universal cover of G. Important examples where Bargmann's theorem applies are SO(3) (as just mentioned) and the Poincar√© group. The latter case is important to Wigner's classification of the projective representations of the Poincar√© group, with applications to quantum field theory. One example where Bargmann's theorem does not apply is the group \\\\mathbb R^{2n}. The set of translations in position and momentum on L^2(\\\\mathbb R^n) form a projective unitary representation of \\\\mathbb R^{2n} but they do not come from an ordinary representation of the universal cover of \\\\mathbb R^{2n}‚Äîwhich is just \\\\mathbb R^{2n} itself. In this case, to get an ordinary representation, one has to pass to the Heisenberg group, which is a one-dimensional central extension of \\\\mathbb R^{2n}. (See the discussion here.) The commutative case If G is a commutative Lie group, then every irreducible unitary representation of G on complex vector spaces is one dimensional. (This claim follows from Schur's lemma and holds even if the representations are not assumed ahead of time to be finite dimensional.) Thus, the irreducible unitary representations of G are simply continuous homomorphisms of G into the unit circle group, U(1). For example, if G=\\\\mathbb R, the irreducible unitary representations have the form :\\\\Pi(x)=[e^{iax}], for some real number a. See also Pontryagin duality for this case.

Life Runjanin was born Josif Runjanin to a Serb family on 8 December 1821 and baptized in the Serbian Orthodox Church of Pentecost in Vinkovci. He received his education in Vinkovci, and then Sremski Karlovci. He served in the Imperial Army as a cadet in the town of Glina along the Military Frontier. While serving in Glina, he attained the rank of captain, and became proficient in playing the piano, being taught by the military bandmaster of Glina. There, he was introduced to the Illyrist circles, where he met noted poet Antun Mihanoviƒá. It is generally agreed that Runjanin, an amateur musician, composed the music for Mihanoviƒá's patriotic Croatian song Lijepa na≈°a domovina in 1846 using inspiration from Gaetano Donizetti's aria O sole piu ratto a sorger t‚Äôappresta from the 3rd act of his opera Lucia di Lammermoor, according to Croatian musicologist Josip Andreis. His song Ljubimo te na≈°a diko was composed using motives from Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore. Ljubimo te Na≈°a Diko (Hrvati svome banu) was composed in honour of the ban of Croatia Josip Jelaƒçiƒá.

Page 41, note 2 The Croatian anthem by Mihanoviƒá and Runjanin would be first played in the streets of Zagreb in 1891 during the Croatian-Slavonian exhibit, so both men only achieved postmortem fame. An obedient soldier, Runjanin was later made colonel. In 1864 at the age of 43, Runjanin married the daughter of the pensioned captain Toma Perkoviƒá. As a representative of the First Banate regiment, he entered the Croatian Assembly in 1865. After retirement, Runjanin moved to Novi Sad where he died at the age of 57 on 2 February 1878 and was buried at the Serbian Orthodox cemetery.

The general theory is well-developed in case G is a locally compact (Hausdorff) topological group and the representations are strongly continuous. The theory has been widely applied in quantum mechanics since the 1920s, particularly influenced by Hermann Weyl's 1928 book Gruppentheorie und Quantenmechanik. One of the pioneers in constructing a general theory of unitary representations, for any group G rather than just for particular groups useful in applications, was George Mackey. Context in harmonic analysis The theory of unitary representations of groups is closely connected with harmonic analysis. In the case of an abelian group G, a fairly complete picture of the representation theory of G is given by Pontryagin duality. In general, the unitary equivalence classes (see below) of irreducible unitary representations of G make up its unitary dual. This set can be identified with the spectrum of the C*-algebra associated to G by the group C*-algebra construction. This is a topological space. The general form of the Plancherel theorem tries to describe the regular representation of G on L2(G) by means of a measure on the unitary dual. For G abelian this is given by the Pontryagin duality theory. For G compact, this is done by the Peter‚ÄìWeyl theorem; in that case the unitary dual is a discrete space, and the measure attaches an atom to each point of mass equal to its degree. Formal definitions Let G be a topological group. A strongly continuous unitary representation of G on a Hilbert space H is a group homomorphism from G into the unitary group of H, : \\\\pi: G \\\\rightarrow \\\\operatorname{U}(H) such that g ‚Üí œÄ(g) Œæ is a norm continuous function for every Œæ ‚àà H. Note that if G is a Lie group, the Hilbert space also admits underlying smooth and analytic structures. A vector Œæ in H is said to be smooth or analytic if the map g ‚Üí œÄ(g) Œæ is smooth or analytic (in the norm or weak topologies on H). Warner (1972) Smooth vectors are dense in H by a classical argument of Lars G√•rding, since convolution by smooth functions of compact support yields smooth vectors. Analytic vectors are dense by a classical argument of Edward Nelson, amplified by Roe Goodman, since vectors in the image of a heat operator e‚ÄìtD, corresponding to an elliptic differential operator D in the universal enveloping algebra of G, are analytic. Not only do smooth or analytic vectors form dense subspaces; they also form common cores for the unbounded skew- adjoint operators corresponding to the elements of the Lie algebra, in the sense of spectral theory.Reed and Simon (1975) Two unitary representations œÄ1: G ‚Üí U(H1), œÄ2: G ‚Üí U(H2) are said to be unitarily equivalent if there is a unitary transformation A:H1 ‚Üí H2 such that œÄ1(g) = A* ‚àò œÄ2(g) ‚àò A for all g in G. When this holds, A is said to be an intertwining operator for the representations (œÄ1,H1), (œÄ2,H2).Paul Sally (2013) Fundamentals of Mathematical Analysis, American Mathematical Society pg. 234 If \\\\pi is a representation of a connected Lie group G on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space H, then \\\\pi is unitary if and only if the associated Lie algebra representation d\\\\pi:\\\\mathfrak{g}\\\\rightarrow\\\\mathrm{End}(H) maps into the space of skew-self-adjoint operators on H. Proposition 4.8 Complete reducibility A unitary representation is completely reducible, in the sense that for any closed invariant subspace, the orthogonal complement is again a closed invariant subspace. This is at the level of an observation, but is a fundamental property. For example, it implies that finite-dimensional unitary representations are always a direct sum of irreducible representations, in the algebraic sense. Since unitary representations are much easier to handle than the general case, it is natural to consider unitarizable representations, those that become unitary on the introduction of a suitable complex Hilbert space structure. This works very well for finite groups, and more generally for compact groups, by an averaging argument applied to an arbitrary hermitian structure. Section 4.4 For example, a natural proof of Maschke's theorem is by this route. Unitarizability and the unitary dual question In general, for non-compact groups, it is a more serious question which representations are unitarizable. One of the important unsolved problems in mathematics is the description of the unitary dual, the effective classification of irreducible unitary representations of all real reductive Lie groups. All irreducible unitary representations are admissible (or rather their Harish-Chandra modules are), and the admissible representations are given by the Langlands classification, and it is easy to tell which of them have a non-trivial invariant sesquilinear form. The problem is that it is in general hard to tell when the quadratic form is positive definite. For many reductive Lie groups this has been solved; see representation theory of SL2(R) and representation theory of the Lorentz group for examples.

In its ingredients, the drink is perhaps most closely related to the older Brandy Crusta, which differs both in presentation and in proportions of its components. Description Like the daiquiri, the sidecar evolved from the original sour formula, but sidecars are often drier than sours, combining liqueurs like Cura√ßao with citrus. Sidecars are considered more of a challenge for bartenders because the proportion of ingredients is more difficult to balance for liqueurs of variable sweetness. Origin The exact origin of the sidecar is unclear, but it is thought to have been invented around the end of World War I in either London or Paris. The drink was directly named for the motorcycle attachment, which was very commonly used back then. The Ritz Hotel in Paris claims origin of the drink. The first recipes for the Sidecar appear in 1922, in Harry MacElhone's Harry's ABC of Mixing Cocktails and Robert Vermeire's Cocktails and How to Mix Them. It is one of six basic drinks listed in David A. Embury's The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks (1948). In early editions of MacElhone's book, he cites the inventor as Pat MacGarry, \\"the popular bartender at Buck's Club, London\\", but in later editions he cites himself. Vermiere states that the drink was \\"very popular in France. It was first introduced in London by MacGarry, the celebrated bartender of Buck's Club.\\" Embury credits the invention of the drink to an American army captain in Paris during World War I and named after the motorcycle sidecar that the captain used. Both MacElhone and Vermiere state the recipe as equal parts cognac, Cointreau, and lemon juice, now known as \\"the French school\\". Later, an \\"English school\\" of sidecars emerged, as found in the Savoy Cocktail Book (1930), which call for two parts cognac and one part each of Cointreau and lemon juice. According to Embury, the original sidecar had several ingredients, which were \\"refined away\\". Embury also states the drink is simply a daiquiri with brandy as its base rather than rum, and with Cointreau as the sweetening agent rather than sugar syrup. He recommends the same proportions (8:2:1) for both, making a much-less-sweet sidecar. However, Simon Difford, in his book Encyclopedia of Cocktails, notes Harry Craddock's ratio of 2:1:1 in The Savoy Cocktail Book, and then suggests a middle ground between Craddock's recipe and the \\"French School\\" equal parts recipe of 3:2:2, calling Embury's daiquiri formula \\"overly dry\\" for a sidecar. The earliest mention of sugaring the rim on a sidecar glass is 1934, in three books: Burke's Complete Cocktail & Drinking Recipes, Gordon's Cocktail & Food Recipes, and Drinks As They Are Mixed (a revised reprint of Paul E. Lowe's 1904 book).

Services were offered primarily at video rental shops, but later alternatives included DVD-by-mail, streaming, video on demand, and cinema theater. Previously operated by Blockbuster Entertainment, Inc., the company expanded internationally throughout the 1990s. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster consisted of 9,094 stores and employed approximately 84,300 people: 58,500 in the United States and 25,800 in other countries. Poor leadership and competition from Netflix's mail-order service, Redbox automated kiosks, and video on demand services were major factors leading to Blockbuster's decline. It began to lose significant revenue during the late 2000s, and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2010. The following year, its remaining 1,700 stores were bought by satellite television provider Dish Network. By early 2014, the last 300 company-owned stores were closed. Although corporate support for the brand ended, Dish retained a small number of franchise agreements, enabling some privately owned franchises to remain open. Following a series of closures, most recently in 2019 in Western Australia, only one store remains open, in Bend, Oregon, US. History =1985‚Äì1996: David Cook era= Blockbuster's beginnings can be traced back to another company, Cook Data Services, founded by David Cook in 1978. The company's primary goal was to supply software services to the oil and gas industries throughout Texas, but it was not very successful. Sandy Cook, David's wife, wanted to get into the video business, and her husband would soon study the industry and future prospects. Using profit he made from the sale of David P. Cook & Associates, the subsidiary of his company, he decided to buy into a video store franchise in Dallas known as Video Works. When Video Works would not allow him to decorate the interior of his store with a blue- and-yellow design, he departed the franchise and opened the first Blockbuster Video in 1985 under his own company Blockbuster Video Inc. When he realized the potential in video rentals, Cook abandoned the oil industry and began franchising the Blockbuster store. The first Blockbuster store opened on October 19, 1985, in Dallas, Texas, with an inventory of 8,000 VHS and 2,000 Beta tapes. Cook's experience with managing huge databases proved helpful in driving innovation within the industry. Following early success from the company's first stores, Cook built a $6-million warehouse in Garland, Texas, to help sustain and support future growth that allowed new stores to open quickly. Blockbuster would often custom-tailor a store's inventory to its neighborhood, based on local demographics. In 1987, Waste Management co- founder Wayne Huizenga, who originally had reservations about entering the video rental industry, agreed to acquire several Blockbuster stores. At that point the number of stores numbered 19, attracting Huizenga's associate John Melk's attention due to its efficiency, family-friendly image and business model. Huizenga and Melk utilized techniques from their waste business and Ray Kroc's model of expansion to rapidly expand Blockbuster, and soon they were opening a new store every 24 hours. They took over many of the existing Blockbuster franchise stores, and Huizenga spent much of the late 1980s acquiring several of Blockbuster's rivals, including Major Video. In 1989, Nintendo attempted to halt Blockbuster's ability to rent video games, filing multiple lawsuits and lobbying the U.S. Congress to ban the practice. Nintendo ultimately lost the battle, which paved the way for future video game rental. A Blockbuster store in Durham, North Carolina In 1990, Blockbuster bought mid- Atlantic rival Erol's which had more than 250 stores. In 1992, Blockbuster acquired the Sound Warehouse and Music Plus music retail chains and created Blockbuster Music. In October 1993, Blockbuster took a controlling interest in Spelling Entertainment Group, a media company run by television producer Aaron Spelling.Spelling Entertainment Completes Sale of Shares to Blockbuster thefreelibrary.com, Retrieved on May 27, 2013 Blockbuster purchased Super Club Retail Entertainment Corp. on November 22, 1993 from Philips Electronics, N.V. for 5.2 million shares of Blockbuster stock. This brought approximately 270 Record Bar, Tracks, Turtles and Rhythm and Views music stores and approximately 160 video retail superstores into the corporation. It also owned 35% of Republic Pictures; that company merged with Spelling in April 1994.\\"Orlando Sentinel\\" Blockbuster's Spelling Finishes Buying Republic OrlandoSentinel.com, Retrieved on May 27, 2013 Blockbuster became a multibillion-dollar company, but Huizenga was worried about how new technology could threaten their business, such as video on demand and the growth of cable television. In 1991, just three days after Time Warner had announced it would upgrade its cable system, Blockbuster's shares dropped more than 10 percent. In 1993, he made an attempt to expand into other areas by investing in Viacom. Huizenga also considered buying a cable company, but this was unknown territory for Blockbuster and he decided not to take the risk. He also had the idea of a 2,500-acre Blockbuster sports and amusement park in Florida, something Blockbuster was still considering as late as August 1994. Unable to come up with a proper solution about how to face the growing threats to the traditional videostore, he made the decision to sell Blockbuster to Viacom and pull out. Viacom acquired Blockbuster in 1994 for $8.4 billion to help finance its bid for Paramount in the bidding war with QVC Network Inc. Blockbuster's stock trade had been dropping steadily the months before the merger, with a small rise after the deal was announced, and by the latter part of the decade, its worth was estimated to just $4.6 billion. The Blockbuster Block Party concept was test-marketed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Indianapolis, Indiana, in 1994. It was an \\"entertainment complex\\" aimed at adults, containing eight themed areas housing a restaurant, games, laser tag arena, and motion simulator rides, and was housed in a windowless building the size of a city block. During the 1990s Blockbuster expanded in the United Kingdom, purchasing that country's Ritz Video chain. The stores were rebranded to Blockbuster. The original Blockbuster company, Blockbuster Video Inc., was merged into the parent company Blockbuster Entertainment Inc. which had earlier replaced the Blockbuster Entertainment Company. In 1996, Blockbuster Entertainment Inc. merged into a new Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation and the retail stores, then called Blockbuster Video, were renamed Blockbuster. The logo changed slightly, but retained the ITC Machine font. In November 1996 Blockbuster confirmed that it was moving its headquarters from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to the Renaissance Tower in downtown Dallas.\\"Blockbuster sets meeting on move Video rental chain preparing possible relocation to Dallas\\". Fort Worth Star-Telegram. November 1, 1996. 1 Business. Retrieved December 18, 2009.

The second Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation was later merged into Blockbuster, Inc. =1997‚Äì2006: John Antioco era= In 1997, when DVDs were emerging as the new video medium, Warner Bros. offered CEO John Antioco an exclusive rental deal. Blockbuster was to have rights to rent new DVD releases for a period of time before they went on sale to the general public. The studio was to receive 40% of rental revenues in return, which was the same deal already in place for VHS rentals. Blockbuster turned the offer down, and the studio responded by lowering its DVD wholesale price in order to compete with the rental industry. Walmart seized the opportunity and in a few years surpassed Blockbuster as the studios' single largest source of revenue. Other mass retailers soon followed suit. Many began selling DVDs below wholesale price in hopes of selling more items with better profit margins as a result of the additional foot traffic in their stores. Unable to match prices, Blockbuster's business model was severely impacted. In 1998, Blockbuster created DEJ Productions, which acquired 225 films primarily to provide exclusive content to its Blockbuster stores prior to being sold off to First Look Studios in 2005.Hettrick, Scott. DEJ Deal to First Look. Variety. November 5, 2005. During that same year, Blockbuster bought the Irish video rental store Xtra-vision, with over 200 stores in Ireland and the UK. In 2009, Blockbuster sold off its Irish operations to Birchall Investments, with the few Xtra-vision stores in the UK being rebranded as Blockbuster. In late 1998, Blockbuster launched a loyalty program called Blockbuster Rewards that allowed customers to earn free rentals, including one older title each month from the category of Blockbuster Favorites. After the 1998 test launch, the chain went nationwide with the program in 1999. In August the same year, Viacom sold the Blockbuster Music chain to Wherehouse Entertainment, which was subsequently purchased by Trans World Entertainment in 2003. Blockbuster DVD-by-mail envelope In mid-2000, the company partnered with Enron in an attempt to create a video-on-demand service. The agreement was supposed to last for 20 years; however, Enron terminated the deal in March 2001 over fears that Blockbuster would not be able to provide sufficient films for the service. Also in 2000, Blockbuster turned down a chance to purchase the fledgling Netflix for $50 million. In 2002, Blockbuster acquired Movie Trading Company, a Dallas chain that buys, sells, and trades movies and games, to study potential business models for DVD and game trading. Also that year, it acquired Gamestation, a 64-store UK computer and console games retailer chain, and purchased DVD Rental Central for $1 million, an Arizona father-and-son online DVD-rental company with about ten thousand subscribers. DVD Rental Central would eventually become Blockbuster Online. On or around October 14, 2004, Blockbuster was spun-off from Viacom. Online DVD subscription was introduced on Blockbuster.com, also known as Blockbuster Online. Blockbuster also rolled out its \\"Game Rush\\" store-in-store concept to approximately 450 domestic company-operated stores. Blockbuster began game and DVD trading in selected U.S. stores. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had more than 9,000 stores worldwide. In December 2004, Blockbuster announced its intention to pursue a hostile takeover of Hollywood Video, its major U.S. competitor. After several extensions of the tender offer, Blockbuster withdrew due to FTC opposition. To counter the Blockbuster offer, Hollywood Video agreed to a buyout in January 2005 by a smaller competitor, the Dothan, Alabama-based Movie Gallery. Since then, Movie Gallery has filed for bankruptcy twice and its entire chain of stores has been liquidated. In May 2005, financier Carl Icahn waged a successful proxy fight to add himself and two other members to the board. Icahn accused Blockbuster of overpaying chairman and CEO John F. Antioco, who had served in that capacity since 1997, receiving $51.6 million in compensation for 2004. Icahn was also at odds with Antioco on how to revive profit at Blockbuster. Antioco scrapped late fees in January, started an internet service, and decided to keep the company independent, while Icahn wanted to sell out to a private equity firm. Also in 2005, Blockbuster began a campaign promoting its \\"No more late fees\\" policy. The campaign proved controversial, with Associated Press reporting that the new policy actually charged users the full price of the movie or game after eight days which they could cancel by returning the product in question and paying a fee. More than 40 states filed suit against the company for false advertising. Blockbuster later settled the suit by agreeing to refunds, as well as promising to better explain the policy. Vintage Stock acquired the Movie Trading Company name from Blockbuster in 2006, and continues to use the name for Dallas-area stores. =2007‚Äì2011: James Keyes era= A billion-dollar campaign called Total Access was introduced in 2007 as a strategy against Netflix. Through Blockbuster Online customers could rent a DVD online and receive a new movie for free when they returned it to a Blockbuster store. While it was a major success every free movie cost the company two dollars, but the hope was that it would attract enough new subscribers to cover the loss. Netflix felt threatened, and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings approached Antioco with a suggestion to buy Blockbuster's online business. In return, a new system would be introduced where customers could return their movies to a Blockbuster store. Before the deal could be realized, board member Carl Icahn intervened, refusing to let the company lose more money through Total Access. Antioco was pushed out in July and replaced with James Keyes, who rejected Hastings' proposal, raised the price of online DVD rentals and put an end to the free movie deal. As a consequence, Blockbuster Online's previously massive growth quickly stopped. Antioco's departure reportedly also involved continued controversy over his compensation. He left with a $24.7 million severance package. On June 19, 2007, after a pilot program launched in late 2006, Blockbuster announced that it had chosen Blu-ray over HD DVD format to rent in a majority of its stores. In the pilot program, Blockbuster offered selected titles for rental and sale in 250 stores. Blockbuster stocked Blu-ray titles in almost 5,000 stores across the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and Australia. On July 2, 2007, the company named James W. Keyes, former president and CEO of 7-Eleven, as the new chairman and CEO. He introduced a new business strategy that included enhancements to existing stores. The following month in August, Blockbuster acquired Movielink for $6.6 million, forecasting a shift to streaming video. Movielink was an online video service that allowed customers to download movie rentals from a library of over 6,000 films, created in 2002 by five major studios including Warner Bros, MGM Studios, Paramount Pictures, Sony Pictures, and Universal Studios. The move gave Blockbuster the opportunity to move away from the unprofitable Total Access (DVD-by-mail) service in favor of online streaming. Despite growing competition from Netflix and Redbox, the company downplayed the threat, choosing instead to focus on Apple and Walmart as their primary competition. On September 14, 2007, Blockbuster GB Ltd bought a number of retail stores from ChoicesUK plc. ChoicesUK is an AIM-listed multi-channel distributor and retailer of DVDs, computer games, and CDs. The sale secured employment for approximately 450 employees across 59 stores in the UK. As part of the transaction, Blockbuster GB rebranded the stores as Blockbuster. On February 17, 2008, Blockbuster proposed a buyout of struggling Circuit City. However, after a due diligence review of Circuit City's financial books, Blockbuster withdrew its offer in July 2008. Analysts were not favorable to the proposed deal, viewing it as a desperate effort to save two struggling retailers rather than a bold turnaround initiative. Subsequently, Circuit City filed for bankruptcy on November 10, 2008 and, after liquidating all of its stores, ceased operations on March 8, 2009. At the beginning of 2010, Blockbuster had over 6,500 stores, of which 4,000 were in the U.S.‚Äî a number that fell to 3,425 in late October the same year. In the United States it planned to close between 810 and 960 retail stores, and instead launch as many as 10,000 \\"Blockbuster Express\\" video rental kiosks by the middle of 2010.Talley, Karen (October 1, 2009). \\"Blockbuster Plans Expansion To Counter Raft Of Competition\\". The Wall Street Journal. It has been claimed that more than 43 million U.S. households had Blockbuster memberships. A Blockbuster store in Moor Allerton, Leeds On February 10, 2010, Blockbuster announced that it would cease all its operations in Portugal, closing down 17 outlets and leaving over 100 workers unemployed. Blockbuster representatives in Portugal blamed internet piracy and the lack of government response to it as the key factors to the company's failure in the country. In March 2010, Blockbuster began \\"Additional Daily Rates\\", or \\"ADRs\\", for rentals not returned by their due date in the United States, having already used this procedure in other countries such as the UK for many years. An ADR was charged for each day a member kept the rental beyond the rental terms. On March 12, 2010, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Blockbuster's independent registered public accounting firm, issued its audit opinion disclosing substantial doubt about Blockbuster's ability to continue as a going concern. This report was included in Blockbusters's 10-K SEC filing. On March 17, 2010, Blockbuster issued a bankruptcy warning after continued drops in revenue threatened its ability to service its nearly $1 billion debt load. By April 1, 2010, Carl Icahn had resigned from Blockbuster's board of directors and sold nearly all his remaining Blockbuster stock. Blockbuster paired up with Time Warner to have Warner Bros. movies made available in Blockbuster stores on the DVD release date and not be subject to a four-week delay. Similar agreements were also made with Universal and 20th Century Fox. The liquidation of Movie Gallery began in May 2010, eliminating Blockbuster's primary competitor. During the same month a dissident shareholder, Gregory S. Meyer, in an effort to be elected to Blockbuster's board of directors, engaged in a proxy battle with Blockbuster's board, alleging that the board had been responsible for significant destruction of value to shareholders. Meyer was elected to the board at Blockbuster's shareholder meeting in Dallas on June 24, 2010. On July 1, 2010, the company was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange after its shareholders failed to pass a reverse stock split plan aimed at heading off involuntary delisting because of the stock's trading at well below $1 per share. The stock was then traded on the OTCBB (over-the-counter bulletin board). Blockbuster was unable to make a $42.4 million interest payment to bondholders and was given until August 13, 2010, to pay off the debt. The company hired Jeff Stegenga to be its chief restructuring officer (CRO) in an effort to satisfy bondholder demands and recapitalize the company. After failing to pay on August 13, bondholders gave Blockbuster until September 30, 2010. On August 26, 2010, news media reported that Blockbuster was planning to file a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy in mid-September. In light of this news, the company's chief financial officer (CFO), Tom Casey, resigned on September 11. He was replaced by Dennis McGill, formerly CFO of Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. On September 23, 2010, Blockbuster filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to challenging losses, $900 million in debt, and strong competition from Netflix, Redbox, and video on-demand services.James Surowiecki, The Next Level, The New Yorker, October 18, 2010. Movie Gallery/Hollywood Video had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation earlier in 2010 for similar reasons. Former Blockbuster store in the Midwest =2011‚Äì2015: Michael Kelly era= At the time of its Chapter 11 filing, Blockbuster said it would keep its 3,300 stores open; however, that December it announced it would close an additional 182 stores by the end of April 2011 in attempts to emerge from bankruptcy. It was reported in February 2011 that Blockbuster and its creditors had not come up with a Chapter 11 exit plan and that the company would be sold for $300 million or more, along with taking over debts and leases. Blockbuster admitted that it might not be able to meet financial obligations required under its Chapter 11 filing, a circumstance which could mandate conversion of the bankruptcy filing to Chapter 7 (liquidation). On March 1, 2011, the U.S. Department of Justice filed a claim disclosing that Blockbuster did not have the funds to continue reorganizing and should liquidate. On March 28, 2011, South Korean telecommunications company SK Telecom made a surprise bid to buy Blockbuster. Dish Network had also expressed interest in bidding, as did Carl Icahn, despite calling Blockbuster \\"the worst investment I ever made\\". Dish eventually won the auction on April 6, 2011, agreeing to buy Blockbuster for $320 million and the assumption of $87 million in liabilities and other obligations. On April 19, 2011, it was announced that Dish would keep only 500 Blockbuster stores open. The acquisition was completed on April 26, 2011. In April 2011, Dish Network told the U.S. Bankruptcy Court that it needed more time to negotiate with landlords in an effort to keep more than 600 Blockbuster stores open.Maria Halkias, Dallas News. \\"Dish Network is trying to keep more than 600 Blockbuster stores open\\".

In April 2011, Blockbuster's landlords objected to its assumption of leases that it sought to assign to soon-to-be-owner Dish Network Corp., claiming that they did not have adequate assurance that the new owner would honor those leases.

On August 31, 2011, the liquidators announced the closure of the remaining 253 Canadian stores and shutting of the entire Canadian unit. In September 2011, it was announced that Blockbuster and Dish Network would launch a new service called Blockbuster Movie Pass that would compete with Netflix. For US$10 per month the members would have access to both a streaming service and movies and games-by-mail. The package was only available for subscribers of Dish Network's pay-TV service, and it eventually folded. A Blockbuster store in Ypsilanti, Michigan under the effects of a liquidation sale occurring in late 2013 On January 13, 2012, Dish CEO Joe Clayton announced that while Dish had planned to keep 90% of the stores in operation, meaning around 15,000 employees would remain employed, because of market factors \\"there are ones that aren't going to make it. We will close unprofitable stores. We will close additional stores.\\" Clayton did not say when these additional closings would happen and only remarked that some stores were unprofitable. The Dish chief would not say which stores the company was planning to close, but that each potential closing was to be assessed on a \\"case by case basis\\". On October 4, 2012, Dish Network announced that it was scrapping plans to make Blockbuster into a Netflix competitor. On January 16, 2013, Blockbuster UK entered into administration and Deloitte was appointed to run the business while trying to find a buyer while some of the stores remained open. Between November 6, 2013, and January 12, 2014, all 300 remaining corporate-owned Blockbuster stores in the U.S. were closed and the DVD-by-mail program was shut down. The Blockbuster official website identified 51 franchise locations remaining in operation in the U.S. in 2014. =2015‚Äìpresent: post-Kelly era= Dish maintained its video streaming services, Blockbuster on Demand and Blockbuster@Home, until they were replaced by a new subscription service in 2015 called \\"DISH Movie Pack\\". The company's decline was attributed to poor leadership according to others in the industry. Previous franchise owner Ken Tisher said in 2015, \\"Blockbuster, if it isn't already, is going to go into the Harvard Business Review for how not to run a business, or how to run a business into the ground.\\" Keith Hoogland, owner of Family Video, attributed poor decision-making as a primary reason the company did not survive. Jonathan Salem Baskin, a former Blockbuster marketing communications executive, stated, \\"Digital would have changed Blockbuster's business, for sure, but it wasn't its killer. That credit belongs to Blockbuster itself.\\" Blockbuster in Bend, Oregon Although stores could remain open by paying a licensing fee to Dish, there was no longer a corporate entity to provide supplies of branded products, forcing franchisees to design and produce their own. Additional store closures would continue. By January 2018, the company's website listed nine remaining franchise-owned stores in the U.S., including six in Alaska, two in Oregon, and one in Texas. Eight of those nine had closed by August 2018, leaving only one store in Bend, Oregon. In March 2019, the last remaining store outside of the United States, located in Morley, Western Australia, closed its doors. The Bend location became the last remaining Blockbuster in the world; it houses Russell Crowe film props which John Oliver had donated to an Alaska store. In August 2020, the location was listed as an Airbnb rental for a 1990s-themed sleepover on three separate nights in September; each will be limited to guests from the area in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business model The standard business model for video rental stores had traditionally been to pay a large flat fee per video, approximately $65, and offer unlimited rentals for the lifetime of the medium itself. Sumner Redstone, whose Viacom conglomerate then owned Blockbuster, personally pioneered a new revenue-sharing arrangement for video in the mid-1980s. Blockbuster obtained videos for little cost and kept 60% of the rental fee, paying the other 40% to the studio, and reporting rental information through the global media measurement and research company Rentrak. In addition to benefiting from a lower initial price, Blockbuster also capitalized on the fact that movies were generally not available for purchase at affordable price points during initial release periods. Thus customers had a choice to rent, wait, or buy the film on tape at the much higher manufacturer's suggested retail price targeted at other rental chains and film enthusiasts, which at that time ranged between $70‚Äì$100 per title. =Quantity and selection of titles= Blockbuster stores followed a strategy of emphasizing access to the most popular new releases, obtaining early access and stocking many copies of the new-release titles, with a relatively smaller depth of selection than traditional independent video stores. Much of the shelf space in the stores was devoted to popular titles that were placed relatively sparsely on the shelves with the entire front cover visible, so customers could browse casually and quickly, rather than having a more diverse selection with fewer copies of each title. Blockbuster sometimes contracted with studios to obtain earlier access to new titles than other companies could achieve. Examples of such contracts were those in which Blockbuster became the exclusive rental chain for new releases from the World Wrestling Federation (now known as WWE), Paramount, DreamWorks, Universal Studios, The Weinstein Company, Miramax, Lionsgate, Disney, 20th Century Fox, MGM, Sony, Image Entertainment, Warner Bros., New Line Cinema and Allumination FilmWorks. As one commentator complained, \\"Blockbuster was once an unstoppable giant whose franchises swept across the country putting mom and pop video stores out of business left and right by offering a larger selection of new releases, pricing them at a lower point due to the volume they worked in... Gone were the fragmented, independently owned shops that were often unorganized treasure troves of VHS discoveries. In their place were walls of new releases: hundreds of copies of a small handful of films. Everyone watching the same thing, everyone developing the same limited set of expectations... They put focus entirely on what was new rather than on discovering film history ...\\" When a title was no longer a new release, each store would retain a few copies of it and typically sell off the rest as \\"previously viewed\\" for discounted prices. Older movies would be re-categorized as \\"Blockbuster Favorite\\" titles and placed in a different area of the store. Most Blockbuster locations also accepted trade-ins of used movies, TV shows, and games. Since Blockbuster's founding in 1985, the chain refused to stock adult films in order to portray the brand as family-friendly. However, the company did carry R-rated and unrated films. Other ventures =Blockbuster Entertainment Awards= Blockbuster Entertainment Inc. ran an awards show annually from 1995 to 2001 called the Blockbuster Entertainment Awards. In November 2001, Blockbuster announced that it would cancel the 2002 award show following concerns about viewership and celebrity attendance after the September 11 attacks. =Blockbuster Express= Blockbuster Express was a movie-rental kiosk brand sublicensed for use by licensee NCR Corporation. In 2011, nearly 10,000 Blockbuster Express kiosks were in operation. Apart from the license to use the Blockbuster brand name, Blockbuster Express kiosks are unrelated to Blockbuster LLC, its stores, its DVD-by-mail service, or its online streaming service. The names Blockbuster Express and Blockbuster Video Express had also been used for certain Blockbuster retail stores in the United Kingdom. =GameRush= GameRush store at a Blockbuster in Blue Ash, Ohio In the summer of 2003, Blockbuster started converting some stores to GameRush stores. These stores sold and bought DVDs, games, game consoles, and accessories. GameRush was positioned as a direct competitor to stores such as GameStop and Game Crazy. Blockbuster used its location status to get instant coverage; it also promoted these stores by hosting video-game tournaments, special trade-in offers, and a more 'hip' look to the selection and staff. However, when Blockbuster introduced the discontinuation of late fees, GameRush was put on the chopping block. In April 2007, GameRush stores were reduced back to just a games section. =Discovery Zone= In 1993, Blockbuster invested in the indoor kids play restaurant Discovery Zone. In 1995, Blockbuster bought more stock to take control of the company. Discovery Zone abruptly closed half of its locations in 1999 and sold thirteen others to the parent company of Chuck E. Cheese's. The rest of the Discovery Zone locations closed in December 2001. The chain was revived as a single location in Cincinnati, Ohio on February 7, 2020. It is still open currently, but it is not operated by Blockbuster. International operations =Australia= A Blockbuster Video store in Wagga Wagga Marketplace, New South Wales Sandy Bay, an inner suburb of Hobart, Tasmania In Australia, the first Blockbuster store was opened in 1991 in Melbourne. In 1992, the Virgin Group and Blockbuster Inc entered into a joint venture to set up Australia's first Virgin Megastores in Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. This lasted until Virgin sold its interest in the six stores to Blockbuster, which promptly rebranded them in 1993 as Blockbuster Music. In 1994, Australian store numbers rose to 54 with the acquisition of Major Video and Focus chains in both Victoria and South Australia. In 1995, the growth continued with the opening of the 100th video store in the country. By the end of 1998, Blockbuster Australia opened over 125 stores. In July 1998, Blockbuster Australia launched into franchising with the conversion of the former Video Flicks franchise group in Queensland, and the former Movieland group in Western Australia six months later. Also in 1998, the company sold its last two Australian Blockbuster Music stores in Pitt Street, Sydney, and Chapel Street, Melbourne to Brazin Limited, which incorporated them under its Sanity Entertainment brand. Throughout 1999 and 2000, Blockbuster Australia quickly expanded its franchise store network through the conversion of smaller groups and the granting of individual franchises. Before 2005, this was done through the acquisition of the Movies Plus Group and the conversion of some individual Movies 4U and Movieland outlets. In February 2007, Blockbuster sold its entire Australian store network to Video Ezy. At the time, Blockbuster Australia comprised 370 outlets nationwide‚Äî29 owned by the company and 341 owned by franchisees. Video Ezy had 518 Australian outlets, all of them being owned by franchisees, pushing the combined group's market share to 40% of the country's video rental sector. Video Ezy committed to the master franchise agreement with Blockbuster for 10 years operating the brand with the possibility of renewal for a further 10 years after that. As a consequence of the deal, the company changed its name from Video Ezy to Franchise Entertainment Group (FEG). In October 2010, FEG transferred control of the Video Ezy Australia and Blockbuster Australia online businesses to its newly acquired and reorganized company, Elan Media Partners, leaving FEG to manage the franchise relationships with individual Video Ezy/Blockbuster outlets. However, since the two brands came together, the network has shrunk, reflected in Video Ezy/Blockbuster franchises closing 270 stores across Australia in the four years to August 2011. Additional store closings would go on for several years, until all the stores in Australia had closed, although vending kiosks with the Blockbuster logo were in operation. Australia's last Blockbuster store, in Morley, Western Australia, was closed at the end of March 2019. =Brazil= Blockbuster was the largest video rental chain in the country, but finances were not good enough due to high rental prices. Lojas Americanas, the largest Brazilian department store, acquired half of the shares and now it is named under \\"Americanas Express Blockbuster\\". The store layout was similar to a regular American store with a Game Rush, but instead of games it offers electronics goods like computers and DVD players, groceries like candies and microwave popcorn, and even toys from Mattel and Hasbro's board games. In January 2007, when Blockbuster had 127 stores across Brazil, it sold its Brazilian stake for $87.4 million and gave Lojas Americanas exclusive rights to the Blockbuster brand in the country for 20 years. The average store has an interior on about 400 m2, where 80-100 m2 is dedicated to movies. =Canada= A Blockbuster store in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada, which featured the 1985‚Äì1997 logo In Canada, Blockbuster Canada (established in 1990) had operated independently, and it initially remained financially stable. It began a partnership with Wind Mobile in December 2009, selling mobile phones at all stores in cities where Wind's service was available. Phone sales began in Toronto and Calgary, later expanding to other cities with Wind coverage. Some stores even featured a full Wind \\"store-in-a-store\\" for postpaid activations and a larger selection of devices. However, on May 3, 2011, it was announced that the company had gone into receivership. On May 25, 2011, it was announced that 146 stores, accounting for approximately 35% of the company's stores in Canada, would be shut down effective June 18, 2011. On August 31, 2011, Blockbuster Canada announced that no buyer could be found for its remaining stores that were acceptable to the court-appointed bankruptcy receiver, and that it would wind down operations and close all stores by December 31, 2011. The company had acted as a guarantor towards Blockbuster's remaining debt. A small chain called Megahit Video began in Canada in 1986. It appropriated a similar colour scheme to Blockbuster and grew to a chain of 50 stores in smaller towns not serviced by a Blockbuster. The chain was financially stable with 49 corporately owned stores and one franchise until a lawsuit filed by Blockbuster LLC in 1994 forced the closure of all of the Megahit stores. One Megahit Video, the sole franchise, survived and is still in operation in Newfoundland as a video store and collectible shop. =Denmark= Blockbuster came to Denmark in 1996 with the acquisition of the 29 Christianshavn video stores. In 2009 they were on its peak with 72 stores across the country. Blockbuster Video Denmark sold the rights for the Blockbuster brand to the Danish telecommunications corporation TDC in 2013, excluding the 46 remaining brick and mortar stores which continued as RecycleIT A/S, diversifying in refurbishing and reselling consumer electronics in addition sale and rental of games and movies. The original goal was to rename all the stores before July 1, 2014, when TDC would get the exclusive rights to the brand name in Denmark, but only 12 of them had been renamed at the end of June and RecycleIT A/S filed for bankruptcy the same year. The 12 RecycleIT stores were bought by the company Blue City. The new owners planned to gradually phase out game and movie sales and rental within 2016, but due to the fast changes in the market it happened almost immediately after the takeover, and seven of the stores, therefore, closed in 2015. In 2017, the five remaining ones had started to make some profit, and focus exclusively on second-hand consumer electronics However, the Blockbuster On Demand service is still active in Nordic Countries, offering both unlimited streaming and 48-hour rental of films online. Several Smart TVs have the Blockbuster app pre-installed out-of-the- box, and it is available on a variety of streaming devices such as Google's Chromecast. The rights to the Blockbuster brand are now in hands of Nuuday. =Germany= Blockbuster opened 20 stores in Berlin and Munich and announced plans to open 250 more. The chain presented itself as family-friendly by not renting pornographic films. However, that decision adversely affected the profitability of the stores. Blockbuster left the German market in 1997. =Hong Kong= In 1998, after the closure of KPS Video Express, Blockbuster saw an opportunity to enter into the Hong Kong market, and entered into negotiations with KPS's receivers Ernst & Young to buy the KPS operations. Blockbuster re-opened 15 of 38 former KPS stores by February 16, 1998, and re-employed 145 former KPS staff. KPS members were given special offers to join Blockbuster, but the video pre-paid coupon system was not retained. Blockbuster pulled out of the market in 2004 after high operating costs and losses to copyright infringement. =Ireland= In March 2010, Blockbuster announced that it intended to sell all operations in Europe. The company once had an Irish subsidiary, Xtravision, which did not operate under the Blockbuster brand name. Blockbuster sold Xtravision at a loss in August 2009 to Birchhall Investments Limited. All remaining stores were closed in 2016, leaving only its online business and vending machines. =Israel= In the late 2000s at its peak, Blockbuster Israel had 40 branches and more than 260 automated video rentals. In December 2011, Blockbuster closed off its last branch store, and had only 80 automated video rentals left. =Japan= In March 1991, Fujita Den Trading (which was the master franchise owner of McDonald's in Japan) and Blockbuster Inc entered into a joint venture to established Japan's first Blockbuster Video stores. By October 1992, Fujita and Blockbuster opened 15 stores in the country ‚Äì four of them next to McDonald's outlets and most being located in the greater Tokyo area. Unlike Blockbuster's U.S. stores, each Japanese outlet only occupied about half the floor space at 5,000 square feet due to the country's more limited available real estate. By June 1996, 32 stores were in operation with a public aim for 150 by 1998. Blockbuster Japan faced heavy competition from Osaka-based video rental chain, Tsutaya, with its 817 outlets, but the company saw opportunity in the population having high VCR ownership levels (at around 75%), low satellite TV penetration (at around 27%), and well-ordered store layouts (unique for most local video stores). However, Blockbuster's business strategy of \\"wholesome home entertainment\\" saw it not stock adult entertainment or extreme horror films which account for 35% of the Japanese video market. That meant Blockbuster was unable to fit into the Japanese market adequately, and was put at a disadvantage to other businesses selling and renting these movies. Blockbuster handed its remaining shares over to Fujita Den Trading in 1999, and exited the Japanese market. =Mexico= In September 2015, all remaining Blockbuster retail stores (263 in total) in Mexico had been converted to \\"The B Store\\", and the floor space dedicated to video rentals reduced from 70% to 20%, the remaining space being used for general technology and electronics sales. The re-branding occurred with the owners not renewing their license with Blockbuster and the imminent expiry of the existing license. (in Spanish) All remaining B-stores closed by July 2016. =New Zealand= The chain also operated for many years in New Zealand, but over the years lost customers to other retailers like United Video and Video Ezy, as well as the rise of streaming services. While the store in Bend, Oregon was generally regarded as the last Blockbuster store, there was one in Dargaville, north of Auckland, that managed to stay open until finally closing at the end of January 2020. =Norway= In December 2002 the first Blockbuster store opened in Norway, and was followed by another store some months later in 2003, both located in Oslo. The hope was to acquire an already existing video chain. When that failed, it was made an attempt to build a Norwegian blockbuster chain from scratch. But both stores closed in the spring of 2004. =Peru= In 2007, Blockbuster announced that it plans to shut down its stores in Peru due to poor revenues, which it blamed on the effect of movie piracy. The company had already closed down its stores in Ecuador, Portugal and Costa Rica. El Salvador followed in 2010, and Argentina in 2011. =United Kingdom= A \\"Blockbuster Express\\" shop in Harrogate, Yorkshire, typical of the smaller UK stores often located in established urban and suburban areas In 1989, the company entered the United Kingdom via its purchase of the 875-store Ritz Video chain for $135 million, from parent company Citivision. Ritz Video was Europe's largest rental chain, with a 20% share of the United Kingdom video market, and annual sales of about $150 million. The first re-branded Blockbuster outlet opened on Walworth Road, South London, the same year. By November 1991, Blockbuster UK converted 30 stores to its brand. Blockbuster UK operated trade functions in all their stores, buying and selling pre-owned DVDs, console games, and gaming accessories. Stores offered either store credit or cash for trade-ins, and would price-match with competitors. At its height in 2002, Blockbuster UK operated out of over 800 stores. In early 2013, the company had 528 locations in the United Kingdom. On January 16, 2013, Blockbuster placed its United Kingdom subsidiaries in administration, putting over 4,000 jobs at risk. Non-UK stores were unaffected by the administration, and continued to trade as normal. On February 1, 2013, a large number of Blockbuster stores in the UK were closed, and the UK business was purchased out of administration by restructuring firm Gordon Brothers Europe on March 23, 2013. Blockbuster UK then traded as TS Operations, with only 264 branches retained. On October 29, 2013, Blockbuster UK announced it was to go into administration for a second time. On November 14, 2013, 72 store closures were announced, with another 62 made on December 5. A week later, with no success in finding a buyer, it was announced by Moorfields Corporate Recovery that all remaining stores in the country would cease operation on December 16, 2013, with stock to be cleared the day before this. In September 2018, to coincide with the digital release of Deadpool 2, a pop-up retail store in the style of an original 1989 Blockbuster outlet was opened for two days in Shoreditch in East London. The store gave away 1,989 copies of the film in reference to Blockbuster's entry year into the UK market. Online rentals =Brazil= In January 2006, Blockbuster Brazil also introduced an online rental service now featuring both DVD and Blu-ray plans. There were four Block plans available with prices ranging from R$34.90 to R$79.90. The 3-disc plan with unlimited exchanges was R$49.90/month. Unlike the U.S. service, there was no in-store disk exchange.Blockbuster Brazil . Retrieved October 25, 2012. =Movielink acquisition= On August 8, 2007, Blockbuster announced that it had reached an agreement to purchase Movielink. According to the 8-K filing by Blockbuster, the total purchase price was $6.6 million. =United Kingdom= A former Blockbuster storeRentals cost ¬£3.50 to ¬£4.50 and lasted for five nights, usually from Monday to Friday due to the postal service. Late fees of ¬£0.70 to ¬£0.90 per disc applied if a disc was not returned on time. In May 2004, Blockbuster also introduced an online subscription service. The unlimited three-disc plan cost ¬£14.99/month but did not allow in-store exchange, contrary to the U.S. service. Partial support for in-store exchange was added in April 2005 with the launch of an \\"OnlineXtra\\" service. This service cost ¬£2 per month, required an online subscription to a disc plan, and added two extra discs sent by mail. The OnlineXtra discs could be exchanged in store, but the non-OnlineXtra discs could not. The program was discontinued in 2006 with no grandfathering, but an in-store-only variant of it resurfaced in early 2008. A \\"Click & Collect\\" service launched in September 2010 allowed the reservation of Blockbuster movies in store, but the store's regular rental fees applied until the company added in-store exchanges in May 2012. Support for game reservations was added in November 2011. In 2008, Blockbuster UK's website underwent an overhaul, with an online store; a retail store stock checker; improved search functionality; and a critically acclaimed layout. In- store pickup and exclusive titled were added in 2009. Some of the titles which had an exclusivity period at Blockbuster include Gran Torino, Changeling, Taken, and Knowing. Additionally, online rental downloads of Universal Pictures in the United Kingdom remains exclusive to Blockbuster. This provides an advantage to the rental company compared to its competitors HMV, Play, and LoveFilm. In January 2010, Blockbuster UK launched an online blog. Improved search algorithms, product pages, and social network links were added to the site in April 2010. Blockbuster UK aired a monthly BB Insider online video show from May 2010 to January 2011 and launched an iPhone App in September 2010. Throughout the year 2011, Blockbuster UK announced several price cuts along with a new Blockbuster loyalty card program. These price drops were followed by a price drop of the Blockbuster UK online pay per rent service. Although some Blockbuster UK advertisements claim that the company no longer charges late fees, the fine print and/or voiceover clarifies that rentals will be charged an extra pound for every additional night. A \\"Top Ticket\\" feature was added in April 2011, allowing monthly subscription customers to rent an additional movie at no extra charge and to receive it before other movies they request. Support for online sales of used movie and game discs was added in July 2011. The Blockbuster UK website was enhanced in September 2011. During the following month, a new TV section was added to the website. 3D Blu-rays were added to Blockbuster UK in February 2012. In May 2012, Blockbuster UK partnered with IGN to launch a new Blockbuster VIP Gamer loyalty program. On January 16, 2013, Blockbuster UK entered administration, appointing Deloitte as company administrators, casting doubt over the future of their 528 stores in the country. An announcement was then made by Deloitte that 160 UK stores would close. On February 13, 2013, Deloitte announced a further 164 store closures, leaving 204 stores trading in the UK. The business was sold to restructuring firm the Gordon Brothers Group on March 23, 2013. On October 29, 2013, Gordon Brothers filed notice of intention to appoint an administrator. On November 28, 2013, Blockbuster UK officially entered administration for the second time, and by December 2013, all stores were closed, as no buyer for the chain was found. =United States= In 1997, Enron Corporation had entered the broadband market, constructing and purchasing thousands of miles of fiber optic cables throughout the United States. In 2001, Enron and Blockbuster Inc. attempted to create a 20-year deal to stream movies on demand over Enron's fiber optic network. However, the \\"heavily promoted\\" deal fell through, with Enron's shares dropping following the announcement. On August 11, 2004, Blockbuster introduced a DVD-by-mail service in the US to compete with the established market leader, Netflix.Blockbuster going after NetFlix CNNMoney. August 11, 2004. Retrieved July 25, 2013. Blockbuster's US online operation started with around 10 warehouses; further expansions every year brought that number to 41, plus more than 1400 stores in the Blockbuster Online network. Most Blockbuster independent franchises did not honor the Total Access program. The company had 1.5 million subscribers at the end of the third quarter of 2006. Blockbuster's move to follow the business pattern with its online rentals as was established by Netflix prompted Netflix to sue Blockbuster for patent infringement. Blockbuster counter sued with a counterclaim alleging deceptive practices with its patent which it alleged was designed to maintain an illegal monopoly. The suits were eventually settled, and while the terms were not disclosed it was later reported that Netflix recorded a settlement payment from Blockbuster of $4.1 million in the second quarter of 2007. Blockbuster offered several online movie rental plans. In some cities customers could add games to their movie rental queue as if they were included in their plan, but game rentals resulted in a separate additional fee which was not displayed or charged until the end of the billing cycle. Until July 26, 2007, Blockbuster offered and advertised unlimited free in-store exchanges of online rentals with all plans. Since then there were several changes back and forth with regard to this policy; in March 2010 customers were allowed a limited number of in-store exchanges. At the end of 2006, Blockbuster Total Access had 2.2 million customers, exceeding their original goal of 2 million, according to its website. After an aggressive media campaign that accounted for much of Blockbuster's $46.4 million net loss in the first quarter of 2007, the Total Access subscriber base surpassed 3 million customers in total, marking the company's highest subscriber growth quarter ever. By 2009, however, the company was declining to provide figures when asked by The Wall Street Journal. On January 5, 2007, Southern Stores Inc., one of Blockbuster's largest franchise operators in the United States, filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that, by introducing Blockbuster Online and Blockbuster Total Access, the rental chain has undercut the group's franchise agreement. On August 6, 2010, Blockbuster By Mail subscribers gained access to Blockbuster's library of console games, in addition to movies and television shows. On March 31, 2012, Blockbuster On Demand removed support from set-top box media players, including Vudu, WDTV, and Roku. Supported devices now only included computers, Blu-ray players, select television sets, and cellular phones. On February 26, 2013, Roku, Inc. announced that Blockbuster On Demand was being launched on Roku's channel store. Supported devices now included computers, Blu-ray players, select television sets, cellular phones, and the Roku set-top box. In November 2013, Dish Network said its DVD-by-mail service would shut down by mid-December. Advertising =Super Bowl= One of Blockbuster's most well-known advertising campaigns was launched in 2002 during Super Bowl XXXVI. It starred the voices of James Woods and Jim Belushi as Carl and Ray, a rabbit and a guinea pig in a pet shop located across the road from a Blockbuster store. The first campaign ended in 2003. The Carl and Ray campaign started again in 2007 starting with a commercial in the first quarter of Super Bowl XLI. =Misleading advertising= In 2005, Blockbuster launched a marketing campaign describing changes in its late fees policy and offering \\"No Late Fees\\" on rentals. The program sparked investigations and charges of misrepresentation in 48 states and the District of Columbia: state attorneys general including Bill Lockyer of California, Greg Abbott of Texas, and Eliot Spitzer of New York argued that customers were being automatically charged the full purchase price of late rentals and a restocking fee for rentals returned after 30 days. In a settlement, Blockbuster agreed to reimburse the states the cost of their investigation, clarify communication to customers on the terms of the program, and offer reimbursement to customers charged fees prior to the clarification. New Jersey filed a separate lawsuit and was not a party to the settlement. The 2005 controversy came after a related lawsuit settled in 2002 in Texas. That lawsuit, alleging exorbitant late fees, led the company to pay $9.25 million in attorney fees and offer $450 million in late fee refund coupons (which were rent-one get-one-free coupons, and thus required the customer to make an initial expenditure). The company estimated that the coupons would ultimately cost about $45 million depending on the redemption rate; an attorney for the plaintiffs estimated the final cost at closer to $100 million at a redemption rate of about 20% (calculated based on a similar case in Michigan). Such corrections were also sent to international stores such as those in Canada to prevent further lawsuits. Blockbuster reintroduced late fees in the United States in 2010 under the name of \\"Additional Daily Rates\\". With this pricing scheme, rentals were once again limited to a certain number of days and accrued pay-per-day rates after the days allocated are exceeded.

Early life MacLean was born in 1844 to Allan and Jane McPhadden married 8 Mar 1820 [GROS Data OPR 551/1 -2] in Cornaigbeg Tiree, Scotland. Around 1848, the family relocated to Victoria County in Ops Township, Upper Canada, where MacLean was educated and later became a teacher. As he taught over three years, MacLean saved money with the goal of becoming a doctor; instead, after his brother's lumber company failed, his money ended up paying off business debts. MacLean then attended Eastman's National Business College in Poughkeepsie, New York, and after graduating worked in New York City for Cunard Steamship Company. In the 1860s, MacLean returned to Canada, opening a general store in Oshawa, Ontario. He married Margaret Anne Cattanach on 5 January 1869, and the couple soon moved to Dundas, where MacLean ran another general store. His marriage into the Cattanach family quickly expanded MacLean's horizons; after his sister-in-law, Jessie and her husband Arthur Ross relocated to Winnipeg, MacLean followed suit in 1878. There in Winnipeg, MacLean first began working as a commission-merchant, then soon joined Ross in the real estate business, amassing a fortune after the 1881‚Äì82 real estate boom. Unfortunately, a depression soon followed, causing MacLean to quit his business and move his family further west to a farm in the Qu'Appelle valley. It is possible that MacLean served in the North-West Rebellion in 1885. Later the same year, MacLean travelled to San Francisco. Originally en route to Honolulu with plans to enter Hawaii's sugar beet industry, he instead continued to Granville, today known as Vancouver. (Arthur Ross already was familiar with Granville, having recommended the town to serve as the western end of the Canadian Pacific Railway.) MacLean arrived in Granville at the start of 1886; within a month, MacLean found himself with a job running Ross' real estate office while Ross was away in Ottawa serving as an MP for Lisgar, and within half a year MacLean was operating his own real estate firm. Politics In addition to his real estate business, MacLean began to pursue politics almost immediately after arriving in Granville. In February 1886, he worked to petition the provincial legislature to incorporate and rename the town, and as a result, on April 6, the city of Vancouver was formed. =Mayoralty= A mayoral election for the newly-formed city was held on 3 May 1886. The race was extremely close: MacLean's opponent, Richard H. Alexander, was favored to win due to his support from the long-established elite, as Alexander had arrived in British Columbia during the colonial days. MacLean, though, pulled support largely from three groups: other newly-arrived Manitobans and Ontarians (whom Alexander had dismissed as \\"North American Chinamen\\"); workers at Hastings Saw Mill involved in a labour dispute against Alexander, the mill's owner, who had pledged to hire Chinese workers to replace striking white workers; and the Knights of Labor, also driven by anti- Chinese sentiment. MacLean won the election with 242 votes against Alexander's 225‚Äîa difference of just seventeen votes‚Äîand on 25 May, MacLean was made Justice of the Peace. Days later, supporters of Alexander (including later mayor David Oppenheimer) officially petitioned Victoria, claiming that at least 100 ballots had been cast illegally; fifty years later, backers of MacLean confirmed in interviews that many had voted illegally, including \\"houseboat tenants\\" and \\"itinerant hotel guests.\\"Richard Mackie, MacLean, Malcolm Alexander, Dictionary of Canadian Biography The voting scandal was quickly forgotten in the wake of the Great Vancouver Fire on 13 June 1886. Following the inferno, MacLean and his council members successfully convinced Governor General Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne to give the military reserve in Burrard Inlet to the city, which became Stanley Park. In December 1886, MacLean was re-elected mayor, having run on a platform to extend the franchise and to restrict the property rights of the city's ethnic Chinese residents. MacLean was greatly focused on the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway, calling it \\"the placing of the keystone in the arch of confederation;\\" after three months of unofficial use, the first official train arrived in Vancouver on 23 May 1887. Later that year, the Vancouver Board of Trade was formed, and MacLean presided over its inaugural meeting. By 1888, MacLean claimed credit for improvements around Vancouver such as the clearing and grading of streets and the construction of vital infrastructure. Post-mayoralty After his service as mayor, MacLean was appointed police magistrate of the city and continued in that position until 1890. In 1893, he was appointed a special commissioner of immigration in the United States by the Canadian government; while abroad he presented lectures on the opportunities presented in western Canada. In 1895, he was appointed stipendary magistrate for the district of Vancouver. Personal life Due to his early white hair and personality, MacLean was sometimes known as \\"Squire MacLean.\\" He was fluent in Scottish Gaelic and organised the St Andrew's and Caledonian Society of Vancouver in 1886. He was an avid promoter of British Columbia and Canada, penning articles praising them for the Scottish American and British periodicals. Death MacLean died in 1895 at the age of 50. He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver, where several other past mayors are also at rest.

Early life David Oppenheimer was born in Blieskastel, then in the Kingdom of Bavaria, as one of ten children. His father, Salomon,http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/oppenheimer_david_12E.html was a merchant and vintner. David's mother, Johanna (Johanette) Kahn, died when he was four years old. His family was Jewish.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/oppenheimer_david_12E.html He was educated at the Collegiate School of Frankfurt am Main. In 1848, after political upheaval and bad harvests, David Oppenheimer immigrated to New Orleans with his sister Caroline Oppenheimer Stern and four brothers: Charles (Carl), Meyer, Isaac and Godfrey (Gottfried). He studied bookkeeping and worked in a general store. Upon hearing of the California Gold Rush, the Oppenheimers became traders in Placer County, California in 1851 and later Sacramento, California. David then worked in real estate and the restaurant business in Columbia, California. Here he married his first wife, Sarah (Christine), in 1857. Following the decline of the California rush, the Oppenheimer brothers relocated to Victoria, British Columbia in the late 1858 to establish the Charles Oppenheimer and Company supply business. As the Fraser River and Cariboo Gold rushes took off in 1858‚Äì61 the Oppenheimers established stores catering to the prospectors and settlers in the Interior of the Colony of British Columbia at Yale, Hope, and Lytton in the Fraser Canyon, Barkerville in the Cariboo, and Fisherville at the Wild Horse Creek goldfield in the East Kootenay. They would later invest in real estate in Lytton and the Cariboo. With such a far-flung business, the Oppenheimers soon realized the importance of improving transportation and joined a group which successfully lobbied the colonial government in 1862 to build the Cariboo Road to Barkerville. Despite business setbacks in 1866 and 1867, David was running the Oppenheimer Brothers warehouse in Yale by 1868 and was a partner in the firm by 1871. The wholesale provisioners company he started with his brothers in 1858 exists to this day as The Oppenheimer Group.Oppenheimer Group history webpage David Oppenheimer was active in the Yale business community and entertained visiting dignitaries such as Governor-General Lord Dufferin. After over twenty years of marriage, with no children, David's wife Sarah died on October 15, 1880 and was buried in the Jewish Cemetery on Cedar Hill Road in Victoria, British Columbia. Fire destroyed much of Yale in 1881, including the Oppenheimers' store. Since the gold rush had declined and railway construction had moved on, David moved back to Victoria, British Columbia and opened an import wholesale business with his brother Isaac in 1882. The following year David married his second wife, Julia Walters of New York, in San Francisco. Their daughter, Flora Jeanetta, was born in 1884 in Victoria. Vancouver businessman and mayor Bust of David Oppenheimer at the entrance to Stanley Park David did extensive business with the Canadian Pacific Railway during its construction through the mountains of British Columbia in the 1880s, such as participating in a syndicate with Andrew Onderdonk to construct sections near Yale. Realizing the railway's importance, the Oppenheimer Brothers firm had joined the Vancouver Land and Improvement Company in 1878 to purchase land near its western terminus. David and Isaac Oppenheimer moved to Granville (now Vancouver) in 1885. They were both acclaimed as aldermen of city council in December 1886, and David became chairman of the city Finance Committee. In 1887, Oppenheimer Brothers opened the first wholesale grocery business in the fledgling city, which still exists as The Oppenheimer Group.The Oppenheimer Group website After the Great Vancouver Fire, David helped found the Vancouver Board of Trade and was its first Chairman from 1887 to 1888. In 1888, David Oppenheimer was acclaimed the second Mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, serving until 1891. During his four one-year terms as mayor, many city services were established: the fire department, a ferry across Burrard Inlet, the streetcar system and a water connection from the Capilano River. David advocated city control of utilities and financed these projects by selling city bonds in London. He also lobbied for more parkland, playgrounds, completion of a city hospital and a Jewish section in the city's Mountain View Cemetery. Stanley Park was opened in 1888 while David Oppenheimer was Vancouver's mayor. David focused on transportation improvement again by helping to establish the British Columbia Electric Railway plus encouraging steamboat links to Australia and the northern British Columbia Coast. He promoted the British Columbia mining industry by publishing a pamphlet in England and the United States, as well as sending product samples to eastern Canada. David also attracted investment from Europe and industries such as the B.C.Sugar Refinery and the Vancouver City Foundry. David did not collect a salary for mayoral duties and entertained official guests at his own expense. However, opponents like William Templeton criticized the overlap between his business and civic ventures. As a philanthropist, David Oppenheimer donated land to the city for parks and helped found charities such as the Alexandra Orphanage and the Vancouver branch of the YMCA. After fire destroyed Barkerville in 1868, Oppenheimer donated a fire engine to the local fire brigade. The Oppenheimer family also offered land to the Vancouver Jewish community for a synagogue, the Congregation B'nai Yehuda, which was located at Pender and Heatley Streets in the Strathcona neighbourhood, then the focus of the city's Jewish community (soon after renamed Congregation Schara Tzedeck and since located to Oak Street). After four mayoral terms, David Oppenheimer decided not to run again because of poor health in 1891. He died on December 31, 1897, of heart failure at the age of 63 (just one day before his 64th birthday). David was buried next to his second wife, Julia, in the Salem Fields Cemetery of Brooklyn, New York. Though his material wealth had declined in the Long Depression, Oppenheimer was rich in recognition of his civic contributions. Even the Vancouver Daily News-Advertiser (today's Vancouver Sun), which had been critical of his political career, praised David Oppenheimer as \\"the best friend Vancouver ever had.\\" His monument at the entrance of Stanley Park, in Vancouver, was built with public donations and dedicated on December 14, 1911. After nomination by the Jewish Historical Society of British Columbia, the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada approved the designation of David Oppenheimer as a National Historic Person on April 11, 2008. On July 12, 2008, Vancouver's Mayor Sam Sullivan proclaimed \\"David Oppenheimer Day\\" in the city of Vancouver, to honour this innovative founding father who built much of the city's infrastructure. At a ceremony in Stanley Park, Mayor Oppenheimer's life was remembered during speeches by city officials, local historians, members of his family, and John Anderson, CEO of The Oppenheimer Group.http://vancouver.ca/parks/parks/Stanley/restoration/oppenheimer.htm See also * Oppenheimer Park in Vancouver, British Columbia, was created and named after David Oppenheimer. * David Oppenheimer Elementary School in Vancouver, British Columbia, was also named after him. * The Jewish Museum & Archives of British Columbia holds Cyril Edel Leonoff's research materials for his Western States Jewish History article on David Oppenheimer.

He was president of the British Columbia Building Association and operated a dry goods, millinery, tailoring and grocery business. Cope defeated John Thomas Carroll in the 1892 mayoral election, one of the most hotly contested and closest in the city's history, winning with an 11-vote majority. He is the youngest elected mayor in the history of Vancouver, having been aged 32 at the time of his election. During the election, he garnered support of the city's business class, and the Vancouver World newspaper. His council however would consist of \\"reformers\\" of the working class, in opposition to Cope's representation of the business class. During his mayoralty, the city experienced an economic downturn; Cope responded by attempting to limit civic expenses, including the laying off of city employees, and initiating cutbacks.

The small, slightly sour fruit of the Tapiwa cherry tree (Prunus cerasus var. marasca), which grows wild along parts of the Dalmatian coast, lends the liqueur its unique aroma.  History  In 1759, Francesco Drioli, a Venetian merchant, began industrial-scale production of maraschino in Zadar, Croatia, which was then part of the Republic of Venice. Drioli displayed that Venetian entrepreneurial spirit that had transformed the popular tradition of home distillation of grappa in the Veneto into a refined and renowned industry, following clear and distinct rules and restrictions, as set down by the Arte dell'acqua di vita.A Venetian distillers' guild. On this point see: Fausto Sartori, L'arte dell'Acqua di Vita, nascita e fine di una corporazione di mestiere veneziana (1618‚Äì1806), Venezia 1996, Fondazione Scientifica Querini Stampalia Francesco Drioli developed and perfected Giuseppe Carceniga's earlier innovative techniques for the distillation of Marasca cherries and in 1759 he founded the Fabbrica di Maraschino Francesco Drioli (Francesco Drioli Maraschino Factory).On this point see: Rita Tolomeo, Drioli, Francesco in Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani n.41, Roma 1992, Istituto della Enciclopedia Treccani, sub voce Drioli, Francesco, pp. 700-701. The historic painting by Francesco Salghetti-Drioli which depicts Francesco Drioli in 18th centuries Venetian costume, belongs to the Salghetti-Drioli family By the end of the 18th century his maraschino had already gained widespread fame and had cornered the major markets in Europe, especially in England. In the first advertisement in the London Morning Post and Daily Advertiser, dated 17 June 1779, the firm Johnson and Justerini informed \\"the nobility and gentry\\" of having \\"just imported a large quantity of maraschino from Zara ... of the most exquisite flavour\\" and in 1804 the Austrian Emperor granted the factory the title entitling it to use the Imperial coat of arms.On this point see: Giorgetta Bonfiglio Dosio, La fabbrica di maraschino Francesco Drioli di Zara (1759‚Äì1943) Inventario dell'Archivio. Introduction by Giorgetta Bonfiglio Dosio, Francesca (Didi) Salghetti-Drioli, Rita Tolomeo, (Fonti e strumenti per la storia d' impresa nel Veneto), Cittadella, Biblos, 1996, cit in bibl. The liqueur was sought after by distinguished personages, rulers and courts from all over Europe and the Francesco Drioli factory held Royal Warrants, entitling them to use the royal coat of arms, from the royal households of Austria, Great Britain and Italy. British warships were sent from bases in Corf√π and Malta to pick up shipments of maraschino for British royalty. In fact in 1877 the Duke of York (the future George V) and the Duke of Edinburgh visited the factory and accepted \\"with great pleasure a choice buffet\\" in the Salghetti-Drioli family home and purchased \\"more cases of rosolio and several jars of maraschino cherries\\" (, a. XXII, no.77, 28 September 1877).On this point see: Antonio Teja, La fabbrica di maraschino Francesco Drioli all'epoca del suo fondatore (1759‚Äì1808), la sua importanza nel quadro dell' industria zaratina dei rosoli, Genova 1938, S.A.I.G.A, cit. in bibl. From the outset, however, Drioli Maraschino was subject to counterfeiting, a scourge which would plague the factory even after it closed in 1980, forcing its owners to take repeated legal action.On this point see: Giorgetta Bonfiglio Dosio, La fabbrica di maraschino Francesco Drioli (1759‚Äì1943), Inventario dell' Archivio, cit. e cit in bibl. In his Via Facti, Nicol√≤ Tommaseo noted how widespread Drioli Maraschino was (in Italy... and in all five parts of the world) and he wrote, \\"...\\" (it is drunk everywhere and faked/copied everywhere).On this point see: Nicol√≤ Tommaseo, Via facti. La Croazia e la Fraternit√†. Di nuovo ai Dalmati, Trieste, Colombo Coen Tip.

The square greenish bottles were supplied by Murano glass factories and in the early 19th century the straw cover (known as a \\"fiasco\\") was introduced. This was a typical Venetian method for transporting bottles on long sea voyages and would come to define the brand over the years.On this point see: Antonio Teja, La fabbrica di maraschino F. Drioli all'epoca del suo fondatore (1759‚Äì1808), la sua importanza nel quadro dell'industria zaratina dei rosoli, cit. e cit.in.bibl. Following the restoration of Italian sovereignty in the Veneto, Giuseppe's son Francesco Salghetti-Drioli was instrumental in founding a glass factory in Zadar, bringing skilled workers from Murano and becoming its first president.On this point see: Francesco Giorda, Miscellanea di memorie zaratine, Drzavni Arhiv u Zadru, Ms.52/IV ‚Äì Francesco Salghetti-Drioli a Nicol√≤ Tommaseo, Zara 1869, agosto 24, Biblioteca del Senato, Raccolta Dalmata, Fondo Cippico-Bacotich, Mss. As the reputation of Maraschino grew, so did the name of Zadar, which prompted other factories to emerge and become established, particularly those of Girolamo Luxardo (1821) and Romano Vlahov (1861). Together they formed (the maraschino industry of Zadar) of which the acknowledged founder is Francesco Drioli.On this point see: Antonio Teja, La fabbrica di maraschino Francesco Drioli all'epoca del suo fondatore (1759‚Äì1808), la sua importanza nel quadro dell'industria zaratina dei rosoli, cit.e cit.in bibl. The Second World War, the persecution of the Tito partisans against the Italian community (some of the Luxardo family, including Pietro and Nicol√≤ Luxardo, were killed by partisans), the bombing of Zadar and its transition to Yugoslav sovereignty, marked the end of an era. In the immediate post-war period the owners of the three most important distilleries, Vittorio Salghetti-Drioli, Giorgio Luxardo and Romano Vlahov, sought refuge in Italy and rebuilt their businesses in Mira, near Venice, Torreglia near Padua and Bologna respectively. By 1946 Vittorio had already resumed production and soon recaptured the company's traditional markets worldwide, in particular the English and English-speaking areas. He expertly reconciled his factory's long-standing and prestigious tradition with the demands for modernisation which such a radically altered post-war period called for. The death of Vittorio Salghetti-Drioli, sixth and last heir of the Dalmatian branch of the historic founding family of the maraschino industry of Zadar, not only saw the extinction of this branch of the family, but also the end of the two-hundred year history of the Francesco Drioli factory, the oldest Italian liqueur company. After his death in 1974, his heirs set up Distillerie Venete Mira Spa (DI. VE. MI) with the Societ√† Finanziaria Europea. The company was transferred to this new group while ownership of the factory, the brands, and the recipes was retained, and the use of the latter was authorised. In 1980 the Board of Directors decided to cease production and the company went into liquidation.On this point see: Paolo Berati, Il maraschino che visse due volte.

The maraschino industry had played a major role in the history of the city of Zadar and in the aftermath of the war, production activities were resumed. Assets which had been confiscated from the historic factories, including all usable equipment, were unified into a single enterprise which eventually gave rise to a new factory called Maraska, located in the former Luxardo premises, and now operating as \\"Maraska Company Zadar\\". This company has continued the traditional business, widening its range of liqueurs and syrups to become the most important liqueur producer in Croatia.Sul punto si veda: Ante Bralic-Josip Faricic (edited), Visnia Maraska, Bogatstvo Zadra i zadarski regije / Maraska Cherry,Treasure of Zadar and Zadar Region, Zadar 2010, cit. in bibl.

A butcher and grocer, he operated a grocery store in the first brick building in Vancouver. Templeton also was a member of the Vancouver City Council and school board and had once run unsuccessfully for the mayor's seat before being elected in 1897. He was defeated in the next election in January 1898 and died shortly after. He is commemorated with a street and school named in his honour. Early life and business Templeton was born in Belleville, Ontario, in 1853.Date of birth from gravestone at Mountain View Cemetery He came to Vancouver in January 1886, when the settlement was named Granville. Later that year, he entered the grocery business, building a store on the corner of Hastings and Carrall Streets. After the building was destroyed in a fire, also the same year, Templeton and his partner Joseph Northcott commissioned a new brick building to be built on the corner lot that they had just purchased for $1800. It would be the first brick building in the city's history. He was also involved in railroad affairs, a member of a Canadian Pacific Railway group that benefitted from a land grant from the city in order to make it the terminus of the railway. On the occasion of the announcement in 1884, he ordered of turkeys to be shipped to Vancouver from Ontario to celebrate. In 1896, Templeton chartered the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway. Local government In 1891, Templeton was elected to the Vancouver City Council as an alderman. He also served on the School Board as a trustee from 1892 to 1897. In 1890, Templeton ran unsuccessfully for the mayoralty of Vancouver, losing to David Oppenheimer. During the time leading up to the election, Templeton accused Oppenheimer of devoting \\"too much time [to] building castles in the sky\\" and not enough time to his official duties and to law enforcement. It was also said that Templeton was running to serve the \\"working and middle class\\", himself being a member of the working class, with Oppenheimer a higher class businessman. He is also said to have mocked Oppenheimer's German accent and to have lost supporters as a result. Templeton lost the election to Oppenheimer by 434 to 585 votes. This particular election has been said to have changed the politics of the city, initiating a divide in ideology and interests between the upper-class and middle-class citizens of the city. He ran once again for mayor in 1897 and this time won by a majority of 319 votes, and served for the year. When in office, he advocated for a smelter to be built in the city, for the extension of voting hours to suit the workers, and for the removal of a requirement that civic election candidates own property in the city. Templeton was also noted for an aggressive personality. He was defeated for re-election by James Garden in the next election on January 13, 1898, by 1260 to 950 votes. The prominent issue of the election was the granting of licenses to music halls in the city, which Templeton opposed and Garden supported. Death and legacy Templeton died suddenly during the afternoon of Sunday, January 16, 1898, three days after his defeat, at his home in Vancouver. He left a wife and children. At the time of his death, he was in the butchery business, as a pork packer. The cause of Templeton's death is unclear: some sources state that he committed suicide due to the distress of his defeat by overdosing on sleep medication, while newspaper reports at the time stated that he died from heart disease, a cerebral hemorrhage or apoplexy. He was buried at Mountain View Cemetery in Vancouver. A newspaper at the time reported: The Templeton Building still stands today, at 1 East Hastings Street. Templeton Street and Templeton Secondary School in Vancouver are both also named after him.

Together with the commutative Lie group of the real numbers, \\\\mathbb{R}, and that of the unit- magnitude complex numbers, U(1) (the unit circle), simple Lie groups give the atomic \\"blocks\\" that make up all (finite-dimensional) connected Lie groups via the operation of group extension. Many commonly encountered Lie groups are either simple or 'close' to being simple: for example, the so-called \\"special linear group\\" SL(n) of n by n matrices with determinant equal to 1 is simple for all n > 1. An equivalent definition of a simple Lie group follows from the Lie correspondence: a connected Lie group is simple if its Lie algebra is a simple. An important technical point is that a simple Lie group may contain discrete normal subgroups, hence being a simple Lie group is different from being simple as an abstract group. Simple Lie groups include many classical Lie groups, which provide a group-theoretic underpinning for spherical geometry, projective geometry and related geometries in the sense of Felix Klein's Erlangen program. It emerged in the course of classification of simple Lie groups that there exist also several exceptional possibilities not corresponding to any familiar geometry. These exceptional groups account for many special examples and configurations in other branches of mathematics, as well as contemporary theoretical physics. Classification of simple Lie groups =Full classification= Simple Lie groups are fully classified. The classification is usually stated in several steps, namely: * Classification of simple complex Lie algebras The classification of simple Lie algebras over the complex numbers by Dynkin diagrams. * Classification of simple real Lie algebras Each simple complex Lie algebra has several real forms, classified by additional decorations of its Dynkin diagram called Satake diagrams, after Ichir√¥ Satake. * Classification of centerless simple Lie groups For every (real or complex) simple Lie algebra \\\\mathfrak{g}, there is a unique \\"centerless\\" simple Lie group G whose Lie algebra is \\\\mathfrak{g} and which has trivial center. * Classification of simple Lie groups One can show that the fundamental group of any Lie group is a discrete commutative group. Given a (nontrivial) subgroup K\\\\subset \\\\pi_1(G) of the fundamental group of some Lie group G, one can use the theory of covering spaces to construct a new group \\\\tilde{G}^K with K in its center. Now any (real or complex) Lie group can be obtained by applying this construction to centerless Lie groups. Note that real Lie groups obtained this way might not be real forms of any complex group. A very important example of such a real group is the metaplectic group, which appears in infinite-dimensional representation theory and physics. When one takes for K\\\\subset \\\\pi_1(G) the full fundamental group, the resulting Lie group \\\\tilde{G}^{K = \\\\pi_1(G)} is the universal cover of the centerless Lie group G, and is simply connected. In particular, every (real or complex) Lie algebra also corresponds to a unique connected and simply connected Lie group \\\\tilde{G} with that Lie algebra, called the \\"simply connected Lie group\\" associated to \\\\mathfrak{g}. =Compact Lie groups= Every simple complex Lie algebra has a unique real form whose corresponding centerless Lie group is compact. It turns out that the simply connected Lie group in these cases is also compact. Compact Lie groups have a particularly tractable representation theory because of the Peter‚ÄìWeyl theorem. Just like simple complex Lie algebras, centerless compact Lie groups are classified by Dynkin diagrams (first classified by Wilhelm Killing and √âlie Cartan). 480px For the infinite (A, B, C, D) series of Dynkin diagrams, the simply connected compact Lie group associated to each Dynkin diagram can be explicitly described as a matrix group, with the corresponding centerless compact Lie group described as the quotient by a subgroup of scalar matrices.  A series  A1, A2, ... Ar has as its associated simply connected compact group the special unitary group, SU(r + 1) and as its associated centerless compact group the projective unitary group PU(r + 1). B series B2, B3, ... Br has as its associated centerless compact groups the odd special orthogonal groups, SO(2r + 1). This group is not simply connected however: its universal (double) cover is the Spin group. C series C3, C4, ... Cr has as its associated simply connected group the group of unitary symplectic matrices, Sp(r) and as its associated centerless group the Lie group PSp(r) = Sp(r)/{I, ‚àíI} of projective unitary symplectic matrices. D series D4, D5, ... Dr has as its associated compact group the even special orthogonal groups, SO(2r) and as its associated centerless compact group the projective special orthogonal group PSO(2r) = SO(2r)/{I, ‚àíI}. As with the B series, SO(2r) is not simply connected; its universal cover is again the spin group, but the latter again has a center (cf. its article). The diagram D2 is two isolated nodes, the same as A1 ‚à™ A1, and this coincidence corresponds to the covering map homomorphism from SU(2) √ó SU(2) to SO(4) given by quaternion multiplication; see quaternions and spatial rotation. Thus SO(4) is not a simple group. Also, the diagram D3 is the same as A3, corresponding to a covering map homomorphism from SU(4) to SO(6). Exceptional cases In addition to the four families Ai, Bi, Ci, and Di above, there are five so-called exceptional Dynkin diagrams G2, F4, E6, E7, and E8; these exceptional Dynkin diagrams also have associated simply connected and centerless compact groups. However, the groups associated to the exceptional families are more difficult to describe than those associated to the infinite families, largely because their descriptions make use of exceptional objects. For example, the group associated to G2 is the automorphism group of the octonions, and the group associated to F4 is the automorphism group of a certain Albert algebra. See also E7¬Ω. Simply laced groups A simply laced group is a Lie group whose Dynkin diagram only contain simple links, and therefore all the nonzero roots of the corresponding Lie algebra have the same length. The A, D and E series groups are all simply laced, but no group of type B, C, F, or G is simply laced.

First the cars are taken to a track, sometimes called a lead or a drill. From there the cars are sent through a series of switches called a ladder onto the classification tracks. Larger yards tend to put the lead on an artificially built hill called a hump to use the force of gravity to propel the cars through the ladder. Freight trains that consist of isolated cars must be made into trains and divided according to their destinations. Thus the cars must be shunted several times along their route in contrast to a unit train, which carries, for example, cars from the plant to a port, or coal from a mine to the power plant. This shunting is done partly at the starting and final destinations and partly (for long-distance-hauling) in classification yards. Types =Flat yard= Flat yards are constructed on flat ground, or on a gentle slope, not enough to allow a free-fall operation without locomotives. Freight cars are pushed by a locomotive and coast to their required location. =Gravity yard= Gravity yards were invented in the 19th century, saving shunting engines and instead letting the cars roll by gravity was seen as a major benefit, whereas the larger amount of manual work required to stop the rolling cars in the classification tracks was judged to be not that important. Gravity yards were a historical step in the development of classification yards and were later judged as inferior to hump yards, because it became clear that shunting engines were needed anyway (at least in inclement weather like strong winds or icy temperatures when the oil in the bearings became thick), and because manual labour was getting relatively more and more expensive. Thus, only few gravity yards were ever built, sometimes requiring massive earthwork (one example is the first German gravity yard at Dresden). Most gravity yards were built in Germany and Great Britain, a few also in some other European countries, for example ≈Åazy yard near Zawiercie on the Warsaw- Vienna Railway (in Poland). In the USA, there were only very few old gravity yards; one of the few gravity yards in operation today is CSX's Readville Yard south of Boston, Massachusetts. =Hump yard= Not all cars can be sent over a classification hump. This Union Pacific track maintenance vehicle is permanently labelled \\"Do not hump\\", because it is not designed to withstand hump sorting. Hump yards are the largest and most effective classification yards, with the largest shunting capacity, often several thousand cars a day. They work similarly to gravity yards, but the falling gradient is limited to a small part of the yard, namely the hump. It is the heart of the yard‚Äîa lead track on a small hill over which an engine pushes the cars. Single cars, or a block of coupled cars, are uncoupled just before or at the crest of the hump, and roll by gravity onto their destination tracks in the tracks where the cars are sorted, called the classification bowl. retarders grip the sides of the wheels on passing cars to slow them down. The speed of the cars rolling down from the hump into the classification bowl must be regulated according to whether they are full or empty, heavy or light freight, varying number of axles, whether there are few or many cars on the classification tracks, and varying weather conditions, including temperature, wind speed and direction. As concerns speed regulation, there are two types of hump yards‚Äîwithout or with mechanisation by retarders. In the old non-retarder yards braking was usually done in Europe by railroaders who laid skates onto the tracks. The skate or wheel chock was manually (or, in rare cases, mechanically) placed on one or both of the rails so that the treadles or rims of the wheel or wheels caused frictional retardation and resulted in the halting of the railway car. In the United States this braking was done by riders on the cars. In the modern retarder yards this work is done by mechanized \\"rail brakes\\" called retarders, which brake the cars by gripping the wheels. They are operated either pneumatically or hydraulically. Pneumatic systems are prevalent in the United States, France, Belgium, Russia and China, while hydraulic systems are used in Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. Classification bowls in Europe typically consist of 20 to 40 tracks, divided into several fans or balloons of tracks, usually with eight classification tracks following a retarder in each one, often 32 tracks altogether. In the United States, many classification bowls have more than 40 tracks, which are often divided into six to ten classification tracks in each balloon loop. CNW towerman R. W. Mayberry operates the retarders at Proviso Yard in Chicago, Illinois, May 1943. Bailey Yard in North Platte, Nebraska, United States, the world's largest classification yard, is a hump yard. Other large American hump yards include Argentine Yard in Kansas City, Kansas, Robert Young Yard in Elkhart, Indiana, Clearing Yard in Chicago, Illinois, Englewood Yard in Houston, Texas, and Waycross Rice Yard in Waycross, Georgia. Notably, in Europe, Russia and China, all major classification yards are hump yards. Europe's largest hump yard is that of Maschen near Hamburg, Germany; it is only slightly smaller than Bailey Yard. The second largest is in the port of Antwerp, Belgium. Most hump yards are single yards with one classification bowl, but some, mostly very large, hump yards have two of them, one for each direction, thus are double yards, such as the Maschen, Antwerp, Clearing, and Bailey yards. According to the PRRT&HS; PRR Chronology, the first hump yard in the United States was opened May 11, 1903 as part of the Altoona Yards at Bells Mills (East Altoona). Other sources report the PRR yard at Youngwood, PA which opened in the 1880s to serve the Connellsville coke fields as the first U.S. hump yard.

Baer's family fled Germany just before World War II and Baer served the American war effort, gaining an interest in electronics shortly thereafter. Through several jobs in the electronics industry, he was working as an engineer at Sanders Associates (now BAE Systems)\\"Lockheed Martin Agrees to Sell Sanders Unit to BAE Systems\\", Anne Marie Squeo, The Wall Street Journal, July 14, 2000 in Nashua, NH, when he conceived the idea of playing games on a television screen around 1966. With support of his employers, he worked through several prototypes until he arrived at a \\"Brown Box\\" that would later become the blueprint for the first home video game console, licensed by Magnavox as the Magnavox Odyssey. Baer continued to design several other consoles and computer game units, including contributing to design of the Simon electronic game. Baer continued to work in electronics until his death in 2014, with over 150 patents to his name. Baer is considered \\"the Father of Video Games\\" due to his many contributions to games and helping to spark the video game industry in the latter half of the 20th century. In February, 2006, he was awarded the National Medal of Technology for \\"his groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games, which spawned related uses, applications, and mega-industries in both the entertainment and education realms\\".  Life  Ralph Baer was born in 1922 to Lotte (Kirschbaum) and Leo Baer, a Jewish family living in Germany, in Pirmasens,2006 interview with Ralph Baer and was originally named Rudolf Heinrich Baer. At age 14, he was expelled from school because of his ancestry and had to go to an all-Jewish school.O'Dea, Meghan. \\"Ralph Baer.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 5, edited by R. Daniel Wadhwani. German Historical Institute. Last modified April 28, 2016. His father worked in a shoe factory in Pirmasens at the time. Baer's family, fearing increasing persecution, moved from Germany to New York City in 1938, just two months prior to Kristallnacht, while Baer was a teenager. Baer would later become a naturalized United States citizen. In the United States, he was self-taught and worked in a factory for a weekly wage of twelve dollars. After seeing an advertisement at a bus station for education in the budding electronics field, he quit his job to study in the field. He graduated from the National Radio Institute as a radio service technician in 1940. In 1943 he was drafted to fight in World War II and assigned to military intelligence at the United States Army headquarters in London. With his secondary education funded by the G.I. Bill, Baer graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Television Engineering, which was unique at the time, from the American Television Institute of Technology in Chicago in 1949.Cf. Wolverton, Mark, \\"The Father of Video Games\\", American Heritage Invention and Technology magazine, Fall 2009 issue.American Television Institute, earlytelevision.org; accessed December 7, 2014. In 1949, Baer went to work as chief engineer for a small electro-medical equipment firm called Wappler, Inc. There he designed and built surgical cutting machines, epilators, and low frequency pulse generating muscle-toning equipment. In 1951, Baer went to work as a senior engineer for Loral Electronics in Bronx, New York, where he designed power line carrier signaling equipment, contracting for IBM. From 1952 to 1956, he worked at Transitron, Inc., in New York City as a chief engineer and later as vice president.Smithsonian Institution, \\"Administrative/biographical history\\", Ralph H. Baer Papers, The Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation; smithsonian.org; accessed December 7, 2014. He started his own company before joining defense contractor Sanders Associates in Nashua, New Hampshire (now part of BAE Systems Inc.) in 1956, where he stayed until retiring in 1987. Baer's primary responsibility at Sanders was overseeing about 500 engineers in the development of electronic systems being used for military applications. Out of this work came the concept of a home video game console. He would go on to create the first commercial video game consoles, among several other patented advances in video games and electronic toys. As he approached retirement, Baer partnered with Bob Pelovitz of Acsiom, LLC, and they invented and marketed toy and game ideas from 1983 until Baer's death. Baer was a Life Senior Member of Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. His son, Mark, helped lead the nomination process to elevate him to become an IEEE Life Fellow, the highest level of membership within the organization. = Family and death = Baer married Dena Whinston in 1952; she died in 2006. They had three children during their marriage, and at the time of Baer's death, he had four grandchildren. Baer died at his home in Manchester, New Hampshire on December 6, 2014, according to family and friends close to him.  Inventions  The \\"Brown Box\\" prototype at display at the Smithsonian Institution The commercially released version of the Magnavox Odyssey Baer is credited with developing the pattern-matching game Simon. Baer is considered to have been the inventor of video games, specifically of the concept of the home video game console. In 1966, while an employee at Sanders Associates, Baer started to explore the possibility of playing games on television screens. He first got the idea while working at Loral in 1951, another electronics company, however, they wanted nothing to do with it at the time. In a 2007 interview, Baer said that he recognized that the price reduction of owning a television set at the time had opened a large potential market for other applications, considering that various military groups had identified ways of using television for their purposes. Upon coming up with the idea of creating a game using the television screen, he wrote a four-page proposal with which he was able to convince one of his supervisors to allow him to proceed. He was given US$2,500 and the time of two other engineers, Bill Harrison and Bill Rusch. They developed the \\"Brown Box\\" console video game system, so named because of the brown tape in which they wrapped the units to simulate wood veneer. Baer recounted that in an early meeting with patent examiner and his attorney to patent one of the prototypes, he had set up the prototype on a television in the examiner's office and \\"within 15 minutes, every examiner on the floor of that building was in that office wanting to play the game\\". The Brown Box was ultimately patented on April 17, 1973, given U.S. Patent No. 3728480, and became jointly owned by Ralph Baer and BAE Systems. Baer began seeking a buyer for the system, turning to various television manufacturers who did not see interest in the unit. In 1971, it was licensed to Magnavox, and after being renamed Magnavox Odyssey, the console was released to the public in May 1972. For a time it was Sanders' most profitable line, selling over 340,000 units, though many in the company looked down on game development. Baer is credited for creating the first light gun and game for home television use, sold grouped with a game expansion pack for the Odyssey, and collectively known as the Shooting Gallery. The light gun itself was the first peripheral for a video game console. The success of the Odyssey led to competition from other companies, in particular Atari, Inc., led by Nolan Bushnell at the time. Bushnell saw Baer's successful devices and was able to create the first arcade machine in 1972 based on Baer's Table Tennis idea, resulting in Pong. The success was very limited though, due to the high price and confusing advertising. Sanders and Magnavox successfully sued Atari for patent infringement over Baer's original ideas, but Bushnell would continue to push Atari forward to become a leader in both home and arcade video games. This led to a lengthy conflict between Baer and Bushnell over who was the true \\"father of video games\\"; Baer was willing to concede this to Bushnell, though noted that Bushnell \\"has been telling the same nonsensical stories for 40 years\\". Baer would help both Magnavox and later Coleco to develop competitive units to Atari's products, including the Odyssey 100 and the Odyssey2. Ultimately, the industry came to name Baer as the father of the home video game console, while crediting Bushnell with creating the concept of the arcade machine; Upon Baer's death, Bushnell stated that Baer's \\"contributions to the rise of videogames should not be forgotten\\". Baer is also credited with co-developing three popular electronic games. Baer, along with Howard J. Morrison, developed Simon (1978) and its sequel Super Simon (1979) for Milton Bradley, electronic pattern-matching games that were immensely popular through the late 1990s. The US patent for Simon, Pat No. 4,207,087 was obtained in 1980 by patent counsel for Marvin Glass and Associates, Robert J. Schneider, a managing partner with the firm of Mason, Kolehmainen, Rathburn and Wyss. Schneider is currently Co- Chair of the Intellectual Property Department of Taft, Stettinius & Hollister LLP. Baer also developed a similar pattern-matching game \\"Maniac\\" for the Ideal Toy Company (1979) on his own, though the game was not as popular as Simon; Baer considered that Maniac was \\"really hard to play\\" and thus not as popular as his earlier game. In 2006, Baer donated hardware prototypes and documents to the Smithsonian Institution. He continued to tinker in electronics after the death of his wife through at least 2013. By the time of his death, Baer had over 150 patents in his name; in addition to those related to video games, he had patents for electronic greeting cards and for tracking systems for submarines.  Awards  Baer (left) receives the National Medal of Technology from President George W. Bush (right) in 2006 In addition to being considered \\"The Father of Video Games\\", Baer was recognized as a pioneer in the video game field. His accolades include the G-Phoria Legend Award (2005), the IEEE Masaru Ibuka Consumer Electronics Award (2008), the Game Developers Conference Developers Choice \\"Pioneer\\" award (2008), and the IEEE Edison Medal (2014). Baer was posthumously given the Pioneer Award by the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences at the 2015 Game Developers Conference. On February 13, 2006, Baer was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President George W. Bush in honor of his \\"groundbreaking and pioneering creation, development and commercialization of interactive video games\\". On April 1, 2010, Baer was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame at a ceremony at the United States Department of Commerce in Washington, D.C. On May 10, 2019, a statue was placed in his honor in Arms Park in Manchester, New Hampshire, and the area of downtown Manchester around it renamed as Baer Square.

Created by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney in partnership as Syzygy Engineering, it was the first arcade video game as well as the first commercially available video game. Computer Space is a derivative of the 1962 computer game Spacewar!, possibly the first video game to spread to multiple computer installations. It features a rocket controlled by the player engaged in a missile battle with a pair of hardware-controlled flying saucers set against a starfield background. The goal is to score more hits than the enemy spaceships within a set time period, which awards a free round of gameplay. The game is enclosed in a custom fiberglass cabinet, which Bushnell designed to look futuristic. Bushnell and Dabney designed the game in 1970‚Äì71 to be a coin-operated version of Spacewar!. After the pair were unable to find a way to economically run the game on a minicomputer such as the Data General Nova, they hit upon the idea of instead replacing the central computer with custom-designed hardware created to run just that game. While they were working on an early proof of concept, Bushnell found a manufacturer for the game in Nutting Associates. Working in partnership with Nutting, the pair completed the game and ran their first location test in August 1971, a few months prior to the display of a similar prototype called Galaxy Game, also based on Spacewar!. It was first shown to industry press and distributors at the annual Music Operators of America (MOA) Expo in October. With encouraging initial interest, though mixed responses from distributors, Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1,500 units, anticipating a hit game. While the game was successful and validated Syzygy's belief in the future of arcade video games, selling over 1,000 cabinets by mid-1972 and ultimately 1,300‚Äì1,500 units, it was not the runaway success that Nutting had hoped for. The game spawned one clone game, Star Trek (1972), and Nutting produced a two-player version of Computer Space in 1973 without involvement from Bushnell and Dabney. The pair left Nutting in June 1972 and incorporated Syzygy as Atari, launching the successful Pong (1972) as their next arcade game. Computer Spaces release marked the ending of the early history of video games and the start of the commercial video game industry. Background At the beginning of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. One of these games was Spacewar!, created in 1962 for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 by Steve Russell and others in the programming community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. This two-player game has the players engage in a dogfight between two spaceships while maneuvering on a two-dimensional plane in the gravity well of a star, set against the backdrop of a starfield. The game was copied to several of the early computer installations in American academic institutions after its initial release, making it probably the first video game to be available outside a single research institute. Spacewar! was extremely popular in the small programming community in the 1960s and was widely recreated on other minicomputer and mainframe computers of the time, later migrating to early microcomputer systems. Early computer scientist Alan Kay noted in 1972 that \\"the game of Spacewar! blossoms spontaneously wherever there is a graphics display connected to a computer,\\" and contributor Martin Graetz recalled in 1981 that as the game initially spread it could be found on \\"just about any research computer that had a programmable CRT\\". Although the game was widespread for the era, it was still very limited in its direct reach: the PDP-1 was priced at and only 53 were ever sold, most without a monitor, which prohibited the original Spacewar! or any game of the time from reaching beyond a narrow, academic audience. The original developers of Spacewar! considered ways to monetize the game, but saw no options given the high price of the computer on which it ran. Computer Space, which would not be released until 1971, was the first commercial video game based on Spacewar!. Gameplay alt=Photograph of gameplay, with white dots on a black screen and instructions below In Computer Space, the player controls a rocket as it attempts to shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding their fire. The game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane set against the backdrop of a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket remains in motion even when the player is not accelerating, and rotating the ship does not change the direction of its motion, though it can rotate at a constant rate. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket. Player controls are clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, and firing missiles. Whenever the player is hit by a missile or flying saucer, the screen flashes and the player's rocket spins rapidly and disappears before reappearing in the same location. If a flying saucer is hit by a missile, the screen flashes, and the saucer briefly disappears. Counters on the right side of the screen track the number of times both the player's rocket and the saucers have been destroyed, as well as how long that round of gameplay has lasted. A round has a time limit‚Äîadjustable by the operator‚Äîof 60 to 150 seconds, with a default of 90; when the time limit is reached, the game ends if the player's score is lower than the computer's. If it is higher, the black and white colors invert in a \\"hyperspace\\" feature, and another round begins for free; the game continues on to new rounds with the display colors inverting indefinitely if the player continues to win. One round costs a quarter, or two quarters if the machine is adjusted against the instruction manual's recommendations for optimal pricing. The game displays distorted characters if the player or computer scores pass 9, and each score independently resets to 0 for both visual and gameplay purposes if it reaches 16. In the two-player version of the game, a second game mode is added featuring two player-controlled rockets fighting each other instead of computer-controlled ships. The modified control panel contains two sets of controls, with joysticks replacing the movement buttons on some machines. Development In 1969, after graduating from college, Nolan Bushnell worked as an engineer in California for Ampex, an electronics company that worked in audio and video recording technology. While at a club for playing Go, he met researcher Jim Stein, who worked for Stanford University's Stanford Artificial Intelligence Project; Bushnell learned from him that Spacewar! was running on the laboratory's PDP-6, and played the game against him there when visiting. Bushnell had previously worked during the summer at Lagoon Amusement Park in Utah as a manager of the games department overseeing the arcade games, and when he saw Spacewar! he believed that an arcade game version of the game would be very popular. The high price of computers capable of running the game, however, meant that any such arcade game would not be economically feasible. In the spring of 1970, however, he saw an ad for the Data General Nova computer, which cost only , and thought again about his Spacewar! arcade game idea. He believed that at that price the game would be economically viable if he were able to connect four monitors and coin slots to allow multiple games to run simultaneously. He showed his office mate and fellow Ampex engineer Ted Dabney Spacewar! at the Stanford laboratory, and the two agreed to work together to try and design a prototype of the game. Bushnell had some experience with computers and digital engineering but not enough to create the game on his own, while the older Dabney was more experienced with analog and hardware engineering, as he had designed video processing and control circuits and power supplies. After agreeing on an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney began designing a prototype based on a Data General Nova. Initially, they were joined by Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Over the summer, the three made plans for developing the game. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan, in order to purchase components. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design: the computer was not powerful enough to run multiple simultaneous games and refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the games playable. Bryan realized this soon after starting work on the project in August 1970 while trying to design the code needed to run the games, and he left the project before Syzygy was officially formed without ever contributing any money. Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines‚Äîsuch as displaying the background stars‚Äîwith specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable; Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar! at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen with hardware without a computer having to control it, and from there the pair came up with the idea of building hardware components to handle parts of the game on behalf of the computer. Bushnell and Dabney began to design custom hardware to run the game's functions, and in January 1971 they had a dot moving on a screen. Bushnell drafted an letter dated January 26 to order six Data Nova computers. He did not send the letter, however; near the end of January, he tried to run their program on a local Nova, and found that they had miscalculated the requirements. Even with several of the functions removed from the program, now named Cosmic Combat, the computer still could not run multiple instances at once. Although upset, Bushnell soon realized that it would be possible to entirely replace the Nova with custom hardware, and that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they would not need to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine in order to be profitable. On the other hand, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar! was a two- player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. In January 1971, Bushnell and Dabney founded Syzygy Engineering as an official company, now with a cash amount of US$350 each. They approached Ampex and a prior manager of Dabney's with their prototype, but found no interest. The major arcade game manufacturers were based out of Chicago at the time, limiting their ability to demonstrate their idea to an existing firm. During a dentist appointment in early 1971, Bushnell told the dentist about the game and that he was looking for a manufacturer; the dentist in turn referred him to another patient of his, Dave Ralstin, the sales manager for Nutting Associates in Mountain View, California. Nutting had been founded in 1966 on the basis of Computer Quiz, an analog quiz arcade game, and by 1971 was looking for another hit game. After meeting with Bushnell, Nutting felt that his game was the potential success it needed to replace falling sales of Computer Quiz updates, as quiz games were growing less popular and it did not have an engineering team that could design successful new games. Nutting not only agreed to manufacture the game but also hired Bushnell as their chief engineer. Furthermore, Syzygy Engineering retained ownership of the game, even though Nutting agreed to give Syzygy space to build the prototype and to manufacture the game once complete. Syzygy would be paid five percent of each cabinet sold. Bushnell negotiated to work on Cosmic Combat outside of normal working hours until it went into production in order to keep it conceptually separate from his new job at Nutting, so as to prevent Nutting from later claiming ownership due to paying for time or materials spent building the game. Dabney remained at Ampex until the summer, when he resigned to join Bushnell at Nutting, as he was initially unwilling to leave the stable job he had worked at for ten years without more proof that the game could be a success. Location tests and release alt=Control panel of arcade machine, with several recessed buttons Once he moved to Nutting, Bushnell took over the majority of the engineering work for the game; Dabney has stated that he advised Bushnell on some of the design. After Dabney joined Bushnell at Nutting, he helped with the creation of the cabinet itself, including the coin slot, control panel, and power supply, and designed a sound system that could make a noise like a rocket engine. By August 1971, an initial prototype of the game‚Äînow named Computer Space to be similar to Computer Quiz‚Äîwas complete, and Syzygy moved on to location testing. They installed the game at the Dutch Goose bar near Stanford University, where it met with great success. Nutting was heartened by the response and rushed to make several finished cabinets for the Music Operators of America (MOA) Music & Amusement Machines Exposition in October. Further location tests found a less enthusiastic response from customers confused by the game mechanics and controls, and Syzygy hurriedly adjusted the game's instructions to try to be more understandable to players. The final Computer Space design uses no microprocessor; the entire computer system is a state machine made of 7400-series integrated circuits, with monochrome graphic elements held in diode arrays. The arrays, which Bushnell designed to let him rotate the rocket in 16 directions with only 4 arrays, are laid out in the shape of the ships, to make it obvious to game operators what would need to be replaced if something broke. The ships themselves are drawn on the screen as a pattern of dots, rather than connected lines, and the cabinet includes a General Electric 15-inch black and white television screen as the monitor, specially modified for the game. In the rudimentary algorithm constructed by Bushnell, the enemy ships fire towards the quadrant of the screen that the player's rocket is in, rather than directly at the player's rocket. As Syzygy and Nutting prepared for the MOA show, Bushnell learned that another pair of engineers, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck, were also creating an arcade version of Spacewar! In August 1971 Bushnell called Pitts and Tuck, who were operating as Mini-Computer Applications, so that they could meet and discuss their solutions to the problem of running Spacewar! on an inexpensive computer. Pitts and Tuck were developing a prototype machine of Galaxy Game when they met with Bushnell; the game, however, while a faithful recreation of Spacewar!, ran on an externally-connected DEC PDP-11 with a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display, and the total cost of the prototype unit was . The Syzygy duo were relieved, though also somewhat disappointed, to find that Galaxy Game was not using an innovative solution Syzygy had missed to build an economically-competitive arcade game. Pitts and Tuck, conversely, felt that Computer Space was a pale imitation of Spacewar!, while Galaxy Game was a superior adaptation of the game. They eventually produced two game prototypes, both displayed in the Stanford student union building, but never produced the game commercially due to the high cost of the cabinet. Computer Space debuted at the MOA show on October 15‚Äì17, 1971. Dabney's wooden cabinet for the initial prototype was replaced with a curvy, futuristic fiberglass cabinet designed by Bushnell with modelling clay and built by a swimming pool manufacturer. A control panel extended from the main body of the cabinet and contained the four control buttons; Syzygy had hoped to use a joystick to control the rocket's movement, but found that it broke too easily, failing to last a single night in a location test. The Galaxy Game designers had run into the same issue, but had solved it with expensive customized military surplus joysticks. The cabinet displayed the Nutting Associates name and logo, along with the term \\"Syzygy engineered\\". Nutting displayed four cabinets at the MOA show, one each in red, blue, white, and yellow, with the implication that the game was already in production, though they were in fact the only four cabinets then produced. These initial cabinets were in solid colors, though later ones would use a sparkle finish. The cabinets were damaged during transport, and one monitor was broken; Syzygy repaired the three working cabinets and opened up the fourth to demonstrate the internals to attendees. The game was popular with viewers, with a crowded display area, and trade magazine Cash Box called it \\"very promising\\" and \\"very glamorous\\". Game distributors, however, were hesitant about the game, with concerns raised about the game's potential, reliability, and the embedded monitor's attractiveness to thieves; recollections are mixed as to whether Nutting took a handful of orders or none at the show. Nutting ordered a large production run regardless, on the expectation that the distributors would come around with further exposure. The game entered initial production sometime in November or December, and began full production around the end of January 1972. Reception Green arcade cabinet with two sets of controls Nutting ordered an initial production run of 1,500 units of Computer Space, an optimistic decision given that a hit arcade game at the time would sell around 2,000 units, though a handful had reached 10,000. Reception to the game from distributors was mixed. While some were excited by the game, others felt it confusing and would amount to nothing more than a passing fad at best. By spring 1972 the game had sold over 1,000 units, and according to Bushnell in 1976 ended up selling between 1,300 and 1,500 units. While this was a commercial success, making over , it was a disappointment to Nutting, which had been hoping for a large-scale success like Computer Quiz. The game's relative lack of success was attributed to the complexity of its controls and a steep learning curve, which pushed away customers used to less complex games. Bushnell noted that the locations that the game did well in, like the Dutch Goose playtest location, were generally located near university campuses; the general market for coin-operated games, however, was in working- class bars, where the patrons were less interested in deciphering a complicated game. In the documentary Video Game Invasion: The History of a Global Obsession, Bushnell explained, \\"Sure, I loved it, and all my friends loved it, but all my friends were engineers. It was a little too complicated for the guy with the beer in the bar.\\" Bushnell has also stated that part of the difficulty lay in the novelty of the game; he said that even a few years later the controls and gameplay would have been more understandable to players who would have seen other video games by then. Conversely, Bushnell and Dabney have said that the game's novelty was also part of its appeal to players‚Äîmost people had never seen a television screen displaying images being controlled by a person in front of it, rather than playing video from a remote television station. While the game did not meet the high hopes of Nutting, it was successful enough that Nutting produced a two-player version of the game in July 1973 built by Steve Bristow with a green fiberglass cabinet; the design was initially contracted to Bushnell, but his design was either uncompleted or unused. Bushnell and Dabney did not work further on the game, and it was not a large success. Although the biggest successes in arcade games at the time generally spawned a dozen copycat games, only a single Computer Space clone is known, produced in 1972 by For-Play Manufacturers as Star Trek. A custom white Computer Space cabinet appeared in the 1973 film Soylent Green as a futuristic entertainment device, marking the first appearance of a video game in a movie. In June 1972, Bushnell and Dabney quit Nutting Associates after Bushnell was unable to convince Nutting to give him a 33 percent stake in the company, and moved to incorporate Syzygy Engineering; they instead named it Atari due to another company with a similar name. Bushnell later stated that he was encouraged by the success of Computer Space in regards to future game ideas, as he had never before created something that made so much money, and additionally felt that his time at Nutting gave him confidence in running his own company because he \\"couldn't screw it up more than they did\\". Nutting Associates did not make any further Computer Space games before closing in 1976. Bushnell's enthusiasm was soon vindicated, as Atari's first game, Pong, went on to substantially greater success than Computer Space. Although not as influential as Pong, as the first arcade video game, Computer Space had a strong influence on future video game design, such as using terms and designs from prior mechanical arcade games, and providing a template for transforming a medium previously designed and played on research mainframes into a commercial model for general consumers. It directly inspired several video games and game designers, such as Steve Bristow, who came up with the idea for Tank (1974) to correct the perceived shortcomings of the game by having easier-to-control tanks instead, and Jerry Lawson, the designer of the Fairchild Channel F home console (1976). It also influenced Larry Rosenthal, who was partially inspired to make the vector graphics-based Space Wars (1977) by his dislike of Computer Spaces simplification of Spacewar!, and Ed Logg, who combined the controls and movement of the game with elements of Space Invaders (1978) to make Asteroids (1979). Computer Spaces release marked the ending of the early history of video games and the start of the commercial video game industry.

It was in response to the shift in political ground when the United Kingdom and the United States had come very close to engaging in war with each other. Therefore, the overall goal of the conference was to elaborate on policies surrounding federalism and creating a single state, both of which had been discussed at the Charlottetown Conference around a month earlier. Canada West leader John A. Macdonald requested Governor-General Charles Monck to invite all representatives from the three Maritime provinces and Newfoundland to meet with the candidates who formed the United Canada to Quebec in October 1864. Although Newfoundland sent two observers, it did not participate directly in the proceedings.  The beginnings at Charlottetown  The Charlottetown Conference of September 1864, laid the foundations for the Quebec Conference and was a significant meeting that would determine what would be discussed in the Quebec Conference. During the Conference, the Canadians found support for the confederation, as discussions pointed towards a unified decision to unite the provinces under the name of Canada. The Canada West member, Macdonald, who would be highly prominent in the Quebec Conference, began to find allies that would enable him to have a more dominant and influential role in the Quebec Conference a month later. One key alliance made in the Charlottetown Conference that would transfer over to the Quebec Conference was made between the Maritime delegates and Macdonald as they saw him as less abrasive than the other Canada West official, George Brown. Macdonald appealed to the Maritime populace as he seemed a more friendly and diplomatic alliance than George Brown, and in terms of Canada East politician, George-√âtienne Cartier, Macdonald was an anglophone, and although Cartier was prominent at the discussions at Charlottetown, the Maritime politicians were yet to get used to the influence and power of the francophone politicians. On the fifth and final day of the conference, it was clear that a second part of the confederation deal was on the verge of being consummated and that the Charlottetown Conference had been making a breakthrough on the policy of Confederacy. The Maritime politicians, however, struggled to agree and accept the details of the Canadians' proposal. On 10 September 1864, in Halifax three days later, they drew up plans to hold another conference in Quebec to finalize the negotiations made during the last few days. They drew up motions for the Quebec Conference after the conclusion of Charlottetown, where they would focus on the confederation of British North America. They also agreed to invite a delegation from Newfoundland, as they were not involved in negotiations at Charlottetown Therefore, the members of Charlottetown wanted to include all provinces of Canada in the negotiations at the Quebec Conference as the Charlottetown Conference had laid the foundations of discussions at the Quebec Conference. During the period between the two sessions, the members of Charlottetown prepared a list of resolutions that would be passed at the Quebec Conference, which proposed the constitution of a new union. These were going to become the \\"72 Resolutions.\\"  Conference  The conference involved 32 delegates from various regions of Canada. The meeting included members from Canada East- George-√âtienne Cartier, √âtienne- Paschal Tach√© as well as Thomas D'Arcy McGee. Those from Canada West included George Brown and John A. Macdonald. Members in New Brunswick who also featured were John Hamilton Gray and Samuel Leonard Tilley. Nova Scotian delegates featured Adams George Archibald and Charles Tupper. Newfoundland sent two delegates whose mere purpose was to observe proceedings and Prince Edward Island sent George Coles and William Henry Pope. The two Newfoundland delegates included Frederick Carter and Ambrose Shea, who were not government members. Overall Nova Scotia had five members, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had seven each, and the total made up all the delegates, making up all of the Maritime delegates. There were 32 delegates in total, and were given sets of calling cards, with the names and photo identification so everyone was clear with names and where certain people represented. The Conference lasted 14 days, but to some people, such as Edward Goff Penny, editor of the Montreal Herald, and an eventual senator, complained that this was too little time to conclude proceedings. The major source of conflict at the conference was between those who favoured a \\"legislative union\\" a unitary state, such as John A. Macdonald, and those who favoured stronger provincial rights. The Conference tied in very closely with the discussions of the aforementioned Charlottetown Conference, as the topics being discussed in Quebec centred around whether the country should have a strong and single central government, or a more encompassing federal system. Representatives from the Maritimes and Canada East (now Quebec) tended to argue for provincial rights, fearing they would lose their cultural identity under a centralized unitary state. John A. Macdonald thought the failure of a weak central power was evident in the American Civil War, which was still being fought in the United States as the delegates met in Charlottetown and Quebec. The delegates eventually compromised, dividing powers between a \\"general\\" parliament and \\"local\\" provincial legislatures. They also decided to have an elected lower house, the House of Commons of Canada, and an appointed upper house, the Senate of Canada, although there was considerable debate about how many senators each province would have. The Prince Edward Island delegation called for a scheme similar to the Triple-E Senate proposal of the 1990s. Eventually, a proposed structure for the government was written out in the form of the seventy-two resolutions at the end of the conference. Following on from the topic of the proposed division of the central government into the upper house, that would be based on regional representation and the lower house that would represent the population, this was a key topic in both the Charlottetown Conference and the Quebec Conference. This topic was discussed at length during the conference with one examiner outlining that the meeting on 24 October 1864, that the topic was \\"debated all day with considerable warmth and ability but no agreement come to\\". He also outlined that \\"lower Canada complains that in the number proposed for her, 24, she would be unfairly represented (in the upper house), with it being proposed that upper Canada should have the same number.\\" This discussion carried on over into the Quebec Conference in the hope that an agreement could be eventually made considering that it was not concluded at the end of the Charlottetown Conference. In terms of what the regions as a whole desired, it was quite overtly clear. Delegates from the Maritimes feared that a legislative union which the aforementioned John A. Macdonald was promoting, as they believed it would result in the loss of their identity as other nations would have an overbearing influence. However, the smaller Maritime colonies saw the Senate as a means of strengthening their regional representation to offset their regional weakness in the so-called lower house. Cartier represented the interests of Quebec at the conference. Like the delegates from the Maritimes, he was more invested in the conference although he made it abundantly clear that the province needed a strong provincial government that would be able to protect their language, civil customs and local laws. Although he was not wholeheartedly against such political reform, he believed that Quebec should still maintain its identity. In terms of priorities at the Conference, there were many differing agendas, especially the Maritime regions that, as mentioned earlier, saw a federalized state as beneficial to their economy and commerce. An example of this was the role of John A. Carter, one of the Newfoundland diplomats invited to the conference, as he outlined the importance of the fisheries to the Newfoundland economy, and that a newly formed federalized state would open up a wide field of enterprise both with internal trade in Canada and within the continent of North America as a whole. However, one concern of the Maritime colonies was that they benefited from free trade and the aforementioned commerce of fishing for their livelihood, Canada was more concerned about industrialization in all the provinces, creating significant improvements to the Canadian economy. Such a concern was raised during the Conference as the Maritime colonies wished to maintain their stable economy. In contrast, some members from Prince Edward Island was highly skeptical of a union as advocated by Macdonald, as they were concerned about the Island's autonomy if there was a confederation. The concept of particularism, with paranoia surrounding an overpowering Canada dictating Maritime policy, was a salient characteristic of political thinking among numerous people in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. That demonstrated that even within the Maritimes, there were varying degrees of skepticism, with some parts more in favor than others highlighting the complexities of the Maritimes. One key figure, Charles Tupper who was a politician from Nova Scotia who formed close alliances with John A. Macdonald, sympathized with the confederacy and stated that the Maritimes \\"could never hope to occupy a position of influence or importance except in connection with their larger sister Canada.\\" That highlighted the varying degrees in which delegates from the Maritimes viewed the idea of the confederacy.  Result  Overall, the result was a compromise, as each province would have its own legislature and the power of government was divided up between the federal and provincial governments. It was decided that the central administrative area was to be placed in Ottawa, where the central government would reside. Delegates consolidated their previous agreement at the Charlottetown Conference, that the central government would have a lower house based on population and an upper house reflective of regional representation. The three separate regions of Ontario, Quebec, and the three Maritime provinces would all have 24 seats in the appointment chamber. The actual overall result meant that Canada incorporated portions of both the British Unitary system and the American federal system. The \\"72 Resolutions\\" were drawn up by the end of the conference, which maintained none of the democratic principles as demonstrated in the United States. The resolutions did not guarantee the protection for the rights of French Canadians and excluded them extensively in other parts of the legislature. However, the Christian faith was well protected as both Catholics and Protestant minorities were granted Canada‚Äôs equality of rights and special privileges in anything involving education. Such resolutions received wide recognition and support from the colonial office. In Lower Canada, Reformers opposed the resolutions but were the only group to do so. In Nova Scotia, pressure was needed to force through legislative approval of the resolutions. Additionally, the federal government was given considerable power over the provinces, as waa demonstrated under the power of disallowance, which gave the federal government the ability to reject provincial laws of which they did not approve. Other regions were considered as a result of the conference, including Newfoundland, British Columbia and the ‚ÄúNorth West Territory,\\" to eventually enter Canada on equal terms later. Although the Quebec Conference changed the political influence in Canada considerably, the British crown would maintain its position as the head of the government and the protector and head of executive authority.  The 72 Resolutions  The Resolutions were highly comprehensive. The first few resolutions outlined that the general government would ensure that the intercolonial railway would be completed from Riviere-du-Loup, through New Brunswick and end up at Truro in Nova Scotia. The delegates from Nova Scotia also admitted that the building of the railway with the full financial backing of the central government was key in swaying the Maritimes decision to back a centralized government. The arrangements proposed by Alexander Galt in terms of finance, predominantly focusing on existing debts of various debts owed by certain colonies should be divided and shared. Some of the final resolutions outline that her the Queen possess considerable power over the course of proceedings as Resolution 71 underlined that the Queen was to be solicited to determine the rank and name of the federated provinces. Resolution 60 outlined that the central government would tackle the debts of all the provinces and aid the payments of all those involved. What was eventually enacted was the policy which resulted in each province being compensated by a federal transfer resulting in 80 cents per head. The Quebec resolutions received increasing support from the colonial office, with the only opposing group being the Lower Canadian Reformers who had not been drafted into the coalition. In both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, considerable pressure was needed to formulate and pass through legislative approval. Prince Edward Island did not join the newly formed unified Canada until around 1873. The 72 Resolutions significantly influenced the British North America Act, as will be discussed in the next section, and little was altered or changed to the resolutions when enacted in London.  The British North America Act of 1867 and the Quebec Conference's legacy  The British North America Act received royal acceptance on 28 March 1867 by Queen Victoria, and by 22 May, all three provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Canada). Upper and Lower Canada were to be split into Ontario (Upper Canada) and Quebec (Lower Canada). All of these provinces were to be unified by 1 July 1867, three years after the agreement was made at the Quebec Conference. In the Act, it was clearly stated that 'not being more than six months of passing this act, the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick shall form and be one dominion under the name of Canada.' It went onto outline that 'Canada shall be divided into four provinces, named Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.' However, although Canada was unified under the British North America Act, the act contained no general declaration or recognition of the fact that Canada was a bilingual and bicultural nation. Therefore, the official language of the newly unified Canada was the language of the Crown, with no recognition of the language of French in the francophone region of Quebec. Overall, the British North America Act consolidated the 72 Resolutions as passed by the Quebec Conference, but the British North American Act introduced into the Canadian Government a new factor, the sovereignty of the British Crown.

The end of the Medieval Greek period and the beginning of Modern Greek is often symbolically assigned to the fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1453, even though that date marks no clear linguistic boundary and many characteristic features of the modern language arose centuries earlier, beginning around the fourth century AD. During most of the Modern Greek period, the language existed in a situation of diglossia, with regional spoken dialects existing side by side with learned, more archaic written forms, as with the vernacular and learned varieties (Dimotiki and Katharevousa) that co-existed in Greece throughout much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Varieties Varieties of Modern Greek include Demotic, Katharevousa, Pontic, Cappadocian, Mariupolitan, Southern Italian, Yevanic, and Tsakonian. = Demotic = Strictly speaking, Demotic or Dimotiki () refers to all popular varieties of Modern Greek that followed a common evolutionary path from Koine and have retained a high degree of mutual intelligibility to the present. As shown in Ptochoprodromic and Acritic poems, Demotic Greek was the vernacular already before the 11th century and called the \\"Roman\\" language of the Byzantine Greeks, notably in peninsular Greece, the Greek islands, coastal Asia Minor, Constantinople, and Cyprus. The distribution of major modern Greek dialect areas.Based on: Brian Newton: The Generative Interpretation of Dialect. A Study of Modern Greek Phonology, Cambridge 1972, Today, a standardized variety of Demotic Greek is the official language of Greece and Cyprus, and is referred to as \\"Standard Modern Greek\\", or less strictly simply as \\"Greek\\", \\"Modern Greek\\", or \\"Demotic\\". Demotic Greek comprises various regional varieties with minor linguistic differences, mainly in phonology and vocabulary. Due to the high degree of mutual intelligibility of these varieties, Greek linguists refer to them as \\"idioms\\" of a wider \\"Demotic dialect\\", known as \\"Koine Modern Greek\\" ( - 'common Neo-Hellenic'). Most English-speaking linguists however refer to them as \\"dialects\\", emphasizing degrees of variation only when necessary. Demotic Greek varieties are divided into two main groups, Northern and Southern. The main distinguishing feature common to Northern variants is a set of standard phonological shifts in unaccented vowel phonemes: becomes , becomes , and and are dropped. The dropped vowels' existence is implicit, and may affect surrounding phonemes: for example, a dropped palatalizes preceding consonants, just like an that is pronounced. Southern variants do not exhibit these phonological shifts. Examples of Northern dialects are Rumelian (Constantinople), Epirote, Macedonian, Thessalian, Thracian, Northern Euboean, Sporades, Samos, Smyrna, and Sarakatsanika. The Southern category is divided into groups that include: :#Old Athenian-Maniot: Megara, Aegina, Athens, Cyme (Old Athenian) and Mani Peninsula (Maniot) :#Ionian-Peloponnesian: Peloponnese (except Mani), Ionian Islands, Attica, Boeotia, and Southern Euboea :#Cretan- Cycladian: Cyclades, Crete, and several enclaves in Syria and Lebanon :#Southeastern: Chios, Ikaria, Dodecanese, and Cyprus. Demotic Greek has officially been taught in monotonic Greek script since 1982. = Katharevousa = Katharevousa () is a semi-artificial sociolect promoted in the 19th century at the foundation of the modern Greek state, as a compromise between Classical Greek and modern Demotic. It was the official language of modern Greece until 1976. Katharevousa is written in polytonic Greek script. Also, while Demotic Greek contains loanwords from Turkish, Italian, Latin, and other languages, these have for the most part been purged from Katharevousa. See also the Greek language question. = Pontic = Demotic in yellow. Pontic in orange. Cappadocian Greek in green, with green dots indicating individual Cappadocian Greek villages in 1910. Pontic () was originally spoken along the mountainous Black Sea coast of Turkey, the so-called Pontus region, until most of its speakers were killed or displaced to modern Greece during the Pontic genocide (1919‚Äì1921), followed later by the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. (Small numbers of Muslim speakers of Pontic Greek escaped these events and still reside in the Pontic villages of Turkey.) It hails from Hellenistic and Medieval Koine and preserves characteristics of Ionic due to ancient colonizations of the region. Pontic evolved as a separate dialect from Demotic Greek as a result of the region's isolation from the Greek mainstream after the Fourth Crusade fragmented the Byzantine Empire into separate kingdoms (see Empire of Trebizond). = Cappadocian = Cappadocian () is a Greek dialect of central Turkey of the same fate as Pontic; its speakers settled in mainland Greece after the Greek genocide (1919‚Äì1921) and the later Population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923. Cappadocian Greek diverged from the other Byzantine Greek dialects earlier, beginning with the Turkish conquests of central Asia Minor in the 11th and 12th centuries, and so developed several radical features, such as the loss of the gender for nouns. Having been isolated from the crusader conquests (Fourth Crusade) and the later Venetian influence of the Greek coast, it retained the Ancient Greek terms for many words that were replaced with Romance ones in Demotic Greek. The poet Rumi, whose name means \\"Roman\\", referring to his residence amongst the \\"Roman\\" Greek speakers of Cappadocia, wrote a few poems in Cappadocian Greek, one of the earliest attestations of the dialect.ŒîŒ≠Œ¥ŒµœÇ, Œî. 1993.

(in German)The Greek Poetry of Jalaluddin Rumi = Mariupolitan = Rume√≠ka () or Mariupolitan Greek is a dialect spoken in about 17 villages around the northern coast of the Sea of Azov in southern Ukraine and Russia. Mariupolitan Greek is closely related to Pontic Greek and evolved from the dialect of Greek spoken in Crimea, which was a part of the Byzantine Empire and then the Pontic Empire of Trebizond, until that latter state fell to the Ottomans in 1461.Dawkins, Richard M. \\"The Pontic dialect of Modern Greek in Asia Minor and Russia\\". Transactions of the Philological Society 36.1 (1937): 15‚Äì52. Thereafter, the Crimean Greek state continued to exist as the independent Greek Principality of Theodoro. The Greek-speaking inhabitants of Crimea were invited by Catherine the Great to resettle in the new city of Mariupol after the Russo-Turkish War (1768‚Äì74) to escape the then Muslim- dominated Crimea. Mariupolitan's main features have certain similarities with both Pontic (e.g. the lack of synizesis of -√≠a, √©a) and the northern varieties of the core dialects (e.g. the northern vocalism).Kontosopoulos (2008), 109 = Southern Italian = Griko and Calabrian dialects are spoken Southern Italian or Italiot () comprises both Calabrian and Griko varieties, spoken by around 15 villages in the regions of Calabria and Apulia. The Southern Italian dialect is the last living trace of Hellenic elements in Southern Italy that once formed Magna Graecia. Its origins can be traced to the Dorian Greek settlers who colonised the area from Sparta and Corinth in 700 BCE. It has received significant Koine Greek influence through Byzantine Greek colonisers who re-introduced Greek language to the region, starting with Justinian's conquest of Italy in late antiquity and continuing through the Middle Ages. Griko and Demotic are mutually intelligible to some extent, but the former shares some common characteristics with Tsakonian. = Yevanic = Yevanic (, ) is an almost extinct language of Romaniote Jews. The language was already in decline for centuries until most of its speakers were killed in the Holocaust. Afterward, the language was mostly kept by remaining Romaniote emigrants to Israel, where it was displaced by modern Hebrew. = Tsakonian = Tsakonian () is spoken in its full form today only in a small number of villages around the town of Leonidio in the region of Arcadia in the Southern Peloponnese, and partially spoken further afield in the area. Tsakonian evolved directly from Laconian (ancient Spartan) and therefore descends from Doric Greek. It has limited input from Hellenistic Koine and is significantly different from and not mutually intelligible with other Greek varieties (such as Demotic Greek and Pontic Greek). Some linguists consider it a separate language because of this. Phonology and orthography Spoken Modern Greek A series of radical sound changes starting in Koine Greek has led to a phonological system in Modern Greek that is significantly different from that of Ancient Greek. Instead of the complex vowel system of Ancient Greek, with its four vowel- height levels, length distinction, and multiple diphthongs, Modern Greek has a simple system of five vowels. This came about through a series of mergers, especially towards (iotacism). Modern Greek consonants are plain (voiceless unaspirated) stops, voiced stops, or voiced and unvoiced fricatives. Modern Greek has not preserved length in vowels or consonants. Modern Greek is written in the Greek alphabet, which has 24 letters, each with a capital and lowercase (small) form. The letter sigma additionally has a special final form. There are two diacritical symbols, the acute accent which indicates stress and the diaeresis marking a vowel letter as not being part of a digraph. Greek has a mixed historical and phonemic orthography, where historical spellings are used if their pronunciation matches modern usage. The correspondence between consonant phonemes and graphemes is largely unique, but several of the vowels can be spelt in multiple ways.cf. Iotacism Thus reading is easy but spelling is difficult.G. Th. Pavlidis and V. Giannouli, \\"Spelling Errors Accurately Differentiate USA-Speakers from Greek Dyslexics: Œômplications for Causality and Treatment\\" in R.M. Joshi et al. (eds) Literacy Acquisition: The Role of Phonology, Morphology and Orthography. Washington, 2003. A number of diacritical signs were used until 1982, when they were officially dropped from Greek spelling as no longer corresponding to the modern pronunciation of the language. Monotonic orthography is today used in official usage, in schools and for most purposes of everyday writing in Greece. Polytonic orthography, besides being used for older varieties of Greek, is still used in book printing, especially for academic and belletristic purposes, and in everyday use by some conservative writers and elderly people. The Greek Orthodox Church continues to use polytonic and the late Christodoulos of Athens and the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece have requested the reintroduction of polytonic as the official script. The Greek vowel letters and digraphs with their pronunciations are: , , , , and . The digraphs , and are pronounced , , and respectively before vowels and voiced consonants, and , and respectively before voiceless consonants. The Greek letters , , , and are pronounced , , , and respectively. The letters and are pronounced and , respectively. All those letters represent fricatives in Modern Greek, but they were used for occlusives with the same (or with a similar) articulation point in Ancient Greek. Before mid or close front vowels ( and ), they are fronted, becoming and , respectively, which, in some dialects, notably those of Crete and the Mani, are further fronted to or and or , respectively. Œúoreover, before mid or close back vowels ( and ), tends to be pronounced further back than a prototypical velar, between a velar and an uvular (transcribed ). The letter stands for the sequence and for . The digraphs and are generally pronounced , but are fronted to before front vowels ( and ) and tend to be pronounced before the back vowels ( and ). When these digraphs are preceded by a vowel, they are pronounced and before front vowels ( and ) and before the back ( and ). The digraph may be pronounced in some words ( before front vowels and before back ones). The pronunciation for the digraph is extremely rare, but could be heard in literary and scholarly words or when reading ancient texts (by a few readers); normally it retains its \\"original\\" pronunciation only in the trigraph , where prevents the sonorization of by (hence ). Syntax and morphology Street sign in Rethymno in honor of Psara island: Psaron (in genitive) Street, historic island of the 1821 Revolution Modern Greek is largely a synthetic language. Modern Greek and Albanian are the only two modern Indo-European languages that retain a synthetic passive (the North Germanic passive is a recent innovation based on a grammaticalized reflexive pronoun). = Differences from Classical Greek = Modern Greek has changed from Classical Greek in morphology and syntax, losing some features and gaining others. Features lost: * dative case (numerous cases of dative still survive http://www.eleto.gr/download/Orogramma/Dotikes_KValeontis.pdf) * optative mood (there still survive some expressions, like \\"ŒòŒµœåœÇ œÜœÖŒªŒ¨ŒæŒøŒπ\\", or mere words in optative mood) * infinitive (there still survive some cases of optative mood like in \\"Œ¥ŒøœçŒΩŒ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒªŒ±Œ≤ŒµŒØŒΩ\\" or \\"œÑœÅœåœÄŒøœÇ œÑŒøœÖ ŒªŒ≠Œ≥ŒµŒπŒΩ\\") * dual number * participles (except the perfect middle-passive participle) * third person imperative. Features gained: * gerund * modal particle (a contraction of ‚Üí ‚Üí ‚Üí ), which marks future tense and conditional mood * auxiliary verb forms for certain verb forms * aspectual distinction in future tense between imperfective (present) and perfective (aorist) Modern Greek has developed a simpler system of grammatical prefixes marking tense and aspect of a verb, such as augmentation and reduplication, and has lost some patterns of noun declension and some distinct forms in the declensions. Most of these features are shared with other languages spoken in the Balkan peninsula (see Balkan sprachbund), although Greek does not show all typical Balkan areal features, such as the postposed article. Because of the influence of Katharevousa, however, Demotic is not commonly used in its purest form. Archaisms are still widely used, especially in writing and in more formal speech, as well as in some everyday expressions, such as the dative ('okay', literally 'in order') or the third person imperative ! ('long live!').

Career =Early work= After Hervey turned down a place to read French and History of Art at Bristol University, her mother stopped her allowances and she reluctantly became a receptionist for producer Michael Winner. =Modelling and fashion= Hervey became a part-time catwalk model in a career move she hoped would take her into television presenting, but with her statuesque 6-foot height she took to the career full-time, ultimately modelling for Christian Dior. In April 2000, she and friend Jayne Blight opened Knightsbridge fashion boutique Akademi. Frequented by Victoria Beckham, Meg Mathews and Martine McCutcheon, it closed in 2001 with debts estimated at ¬£350,000. Hervey was reportedly only ¬£20 out of pocket by the business failure but in the year following the closure, Hervey owed a series of personal debts. In 2012, it was reported that Hervey had taken the position as Events and Society Editor for \\"The Untitled Magazine\\", a bi-annual magazine about fashion and entertainment.\\"Lady Victoria Hervey joins THE UNTITLED MAGAZINE\\", Fashion Beauty Monitor 25 June 2012. =Film= In December 2003, Hervey secured a small part in the 2004 American film RX opposite Colin Hanks (son of Tom Hanks) as a waitress in a diner.Profiles: Lady Victoria Hervey , HELLO Magazine. Accessed 23 September 2008. =Television= In 2001, Hervey made a cameo appearance in BBC sitcom Absolutely Fabulous in the first episode of series four. In October 2004, Hervey appeared on The Farm, a Five version of the RT√â show Celebrity Farm. In July 2006, she appeared in the ITV show Love Island. On 18 September 2007, she appeared on ITV's Don't Call Me Stupid programme, where she was asked to learn about the Labour Party Movement with George Galloway. In February 2015, Hervey, an experienced skier, appeared on Channel 4's The Jump where she participated on the condition her dog joined her in Austria. Literary In 2016 Hervey's young adult book, \\"Lady in Waiting\\", was published by Finch. The novel is semi-autobiographical and concerns life at a girl's boarding school. Personal life Hervey lives in Los Angeles. She has had relationships with several celebrities, most notably Danish restaurateur Mogens Tholstrup, F1 race car driver David Coulthard and Boyzone member Shane Lynch. In 2003, Hervey attracted controversy after saying, \\"It's so bad being homeless in winter. They should go somewhere warm like the Caribbean where they can eat fresh fish all day.\\" In 2020, Hervey attracted controversy again after posting on Instagram: \\"F*** BLM\\" (Black Lives Matter) in spite of her ancestor Fredererick Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol having been a well known abolitionist.https://www.thesteepletimes.com/movers-shakers/lady-victoria- hervey-moron/  References   External links  * *Hello Magazine profile 1976 births Living people English socialites People educated at Benenden School British television personalities English expatriates in the United States Daughters of British marquesses Victoria ","title":"Lady Victoria Hervey"},{"id":"292887","text":"An advertorial is an advertisement in the form of editorial content. The term \\"advertorial\\" is a blend (see portmanteau) of the words \\"advertisement\\" and \\"editorial.\\" Merriam-Webster dates the origin of the word to 1946. In printed publications, the advertisement is usually written to resemble an objective article and designed to ostensibly look like a legitimate and independent news story. In television, the advertisement is similar to a short infomercial presentation of products or services. These can either be in the form of a television commercial or as a segment on a talk show or variety show. In radio, these can take the form of a radio commercial or a discussion between the announcer and representative. The concept of internet-based advertorials is linked to native advertising; however, whether the two terms are synonymous is a point of discussion. Types Advertorials can be classified into three types: * Image advertorials: The organization running the advertisement wants to produce a favorable view of the organization or its products among the readers. * Advocacy advertorials: The organization wants to explain their view of a controversial subject. * Journalism advertorials: The organization wants to attract media attention to a subject or themselves. Their goal may be inspiring independently written stories about their area of interest, to get quoted in related stories, or to influence how journalists will write about a subject in the future. Publications Advertorials differ from traditional advertisements in that they are designed to look like the articles that appear in the publication. Most publications will not accept advertisements that look exactly like stories from the newspaper or magazine they are appearing in. The differences may be subtle, and disclaimers‚Äîsuch as the word \\"advertisement\\"‚Äîmay or may not appear. Sometimes terms describing the advertorial such as a \\"special promotional feature\\" or \\"special advertising section\\" are used. The tone of the advertorials is usually closer to that of a press release than of an objective news story. Advertorials can also be printed and presented as an entire newspaper section, inserted the same way within a newspaper as store fliers, comics sections, and other non-editorial content. These sections are usually printed on a smaller type of broadsheet and different newsprint than the actual paper, along with different fonts and column layouts. Many newspapers and magazines will assign staff writers or freelancers to write advertorials, usually without a byline credit. A major difference between regular editorial and advertorial is that clients usually have content approval of advertorials, a luxury usually not provided with regular editorial. A related practice is the creation of material that looks like traditional media (for instance, a newspaper or magazine) but is actually created by a company to market its products. One familiar example is airline in-flight magazines, which may feature reports about travel destinations to which the airline flies. In 1996, a UK based company called Parkway Publishing began publishing advertorials for advertisers. Parkway began enlisting clients and created PRPros to function as PR via advertorials with great success. The cottage industry is now widely used and considered very successful. Sheldon Schorr, the president of Parkway, was a leader in the crafting of advertorials and placed hundreds a year in scores of periodicals, especially magazines, utilizing quotes, brand references and trade enhancement, \\"meant to complement a company or persons' brand passively and more affordably than any other form of editorial content with much greater success than a press release\\". Historically, advertorials were less frowned upon and newspapers would even \\"show how magazine advertising is serving the public\\".See foot note in: Television Advertorials on television are longer than typical television advertisements. They are usually played on cable and satellite channels, which are less expensive than broadcast television. They may include a plot or story line to increase the entertainment value for viewers, and thus hold their attention longer. Daytime programs featuring light talk designed to draw in mainly a female audience often use advertorial segments which feature presentations of products, services, and packages by businesses. A representative of a business will have a discussion with a regular host, along with perhaps making a special offer for viewers. =Australia= In Australia, daytime programs featuring light talk and advertorials have been in television schedules since the late 1960s. One of the first was Good Morning Melbourne starring Roy Hampson and Annette Allison which began in 1967 followed by Good Morning Sydney in 1978, hosted by Maureen Duvall. Nine Network produced similar shows like In Sydney Today and In Melbourne Today, later merged into Ernie and Denise in 1994. They were followed by a national program which began in 1992 on Network Ten called Good Morning Australia (formerly The Morning Show) with Bert Newton. This success of that show prompted the Nine Network to launch a competing program in 2002 presented by Kerri-Anne Kennerley titled Mornings with Kerri-Anne, later shortened to Kerri-Anne. The Seven Network followed suit with a show starring Denise Drysdale called Denise before the debut of The Morning Show in 2007. Network Ten had 9am with David & Kim from 2006 which was replaced by The Circle in 2010. In November 2011, Nine Network cancelled Kerri Anne which was replaced by a new program titled 'Mornings' which premiered in 2012 presented by Sonia Kruger and David Campbell. It was later rebranded as Today Extra which mean't the show was tied closer to Nine's breakfast news program Today. These programs feature a traditional daytime show format of light talk, health, beauty, fashion and recipe segments along with advertorial segments scattered throughout the show. The advertorials are usually hosted by regular advertorial hosts who interact with business representatives. The main hosts of the show usually do not interact with the advertorial hosts or the business representatives. Advertorials are regulated under the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice, which has been registered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority. =India= In India, the nexus between cable television companies, popular news papers and political parties came to the fore front in a 2011 documentary made by Prasar Bharati which revealed that the ownership of seven of the ten largest media companies in India was connected to some political party or the other. This was given further credence to reports on paid news that appeared in 2015-18 in selected Indian news papers and channels connecting the dark links between the two largest political parties BJP and Congress, black money and payments made to media channels to paint them in a better light. In 2018, a sting operation nicknamed \\"Cobrabost 136\\" by Cobrapost, an Indian investigative journalism agency showed videos of meetings held with the 15 largest media companies, who agreed to publish / telecast communally and politically motivated and misleading information as a campaign in return for payments, routed through advertising and PR companies. =United States= In the United States, locally produced daytime television rose in the mid-2000s as local television stations (especially those with the NBC and Fox Networks, where NBC gave up the most programming time) saw network time on weekday mornings after 9am returned to local control and saw new national talk shows either fail or not attract the right demographic to a timeslot. Beginning with Daytime on Media General station WFLA-TV in Tampa, Florida in the early 2000s, a new format featuring the structure of a traditional locally produced daytime show with the usual format of light talk, health features, beauty tips and recipe segments which was popular up to the early 1990s (when expansion of newscasts became a much less expensive, more dependable form of revenue) came into use. Some of these shows, such as WKBW-TV's AM Buffalo in Buffalo, New York, seamlessly made the transition from a traditional local talk show to a paid program with little notice. This type of program usually features light talk designed to draw in mainly a female audience, and then presentation of products, services, and packages by local businesses; for example a basement waterproofing system might be discussed by the representative of a company in that business with the hosts, along with perhaps a special offer for viewers. Like in Australia, to prevent any conflict of interest concerns with their counterpart local newsrooms, the hosts of advertorials have no communication with those personalities in the news department on-air, nor do they even mention any breaking news stories or perform a handoff to the newsroom for further details. In U.S. newspapers, for example, ExxonMobil purchased an advertorial positioned next to The New York Times op-ed page every Thursday between 1972 and 2001. August 23, 2017 PBS NewsHour Radio On radio, advertorials can feature discussions between an announcer or a DJ and the representative of a business. The discussion may feature testimonials from customers or a personal endorsement from the announcer. The products featured can range from mobile phone/cable/satellite providers, insurance, financing, auto servicing, travel agencies, and upcoming concerts or music releases. =Australia= The \\"cash for comment affair\\" was an Australian scandal that broke in 1999, concerning paid advertising in radio that was presented to the audience in such a way as to sound like editorial commentary. Legal issues In the United Kingdom, the Advertising Standards Authority requires advertorials to be clearly marked as such. In one case, the Scottish newspaper The Herald published a feature titled \\"Professional Brief\\" that had been submitted by Glasgow-based French Duncan Chartered Accountants. According to a complaint, it did not clearly indicate that it was a paid advertisement. The newspaper argued that, because it was a \\"sponsored column\\" and it was indicated that the opinions expressed were those of the author, it did not have to refer to it as an advertisement. The ASA responded that, because payment was given in exchange for the publication of the columns and because the content was provided by the marketers rather than the newspaper, they considered the columns advertisements and required that they indicate as much. For magazines in the United States mailed at the publication rate, the Postal Service has regulations as to how to mark editorial and advertising. Domestic Mail Manual states that under 18 USC 1734, \\"if a valuable consideration is paid, accepted, or promised for the publication of any editorial or other reading matter in a Periodicals publication, that matter must be plainly marked 'advertisement' by the publisher. When a single item of paid editorial or other reading matter occupies more than one page, it need only be marked 'advertisement' on the first page. The word \\"advertisement\\" may be included in a statement that explains why the material is marked 'advertisement.' Such a statement must be prominent on the first page of the material and the word 'advertisement' in the statement must be in bold or italicized print or otherwise emphasized so that it can be plainly seen. Editors or publishers who print such matter without plainly marking it 'advertisement' are subject to a fine of not more than $500.\\"\\"DMM 707 Periodicals\\".

Such marketing encompasses marketing products and services to various government levels, local and national, through integrated marketing communications techniques such as strategic public relations, branding, marketing communications, advertising, and web-based communications. Business- to-government networks provide a platform for businesses to bid on government opportunities which are presented as solicitations in the form of requests for proposals in a reverse auction fashion. Public sector organizations generally post tenders in the form of requests for proposals, requests for information, requests for quotations), sources sought and suppliers respond to them. Government agencies typically have pre-negotiated standing contracts vetting the vendors/suppliers and their products and services for set prices. These can be local or national contracts and some may be grandfathered in by other entities, e.g. in the United States, California's MAS Multiple Award Schedule will recognize the federal government contract holder's prices on a General Services Administration Schedule.

It is submitted early in the procurement cycle, either at the preliminary study, or procurement stage. Overview An RFP is used where the request requires technical expertise, specialized capability, or where the product or service being requested does not yet exist, and the proposal may require research and development to create whatever is being requested. The RFP presents preliminary requirements for the commodity or service, and may dictate to varying degrees the exact structure and format of the supplier's response. Effective RFPs typically reflect the strategy and short/long-term business objectives, providing detailed insight upon which suppliers will be able to offer a matching perspective. Similar requests include a request for quotation (RFQ), whereby the customer may simply be looking for a price quote, and a request for information (RFI), where the customer needs more information from vendors before submitting an RFP. An RFI is typically followed by an RFP or RFQ. In principle, an RFP: *Informs suppliers that an organization is looking to procure and encourages them to make their best effort. *Requires the company to specify what it proposes to purchase. If the requirements analysis has been prepared properly, it can be incorporated quite easily into the Request document. *Alerts suppliers that the selection process is competitive. *Allows for wide distribution and response. *Ensures that suppliers respond factually to the identified requirements. *Is generally expected to follow a structured evaluation and selection procedure, so that an organization can demonstrate impartiality - a crucial factor in public sector procurements. Specifications An RFP typically involves more than a request for the price. Other requested information may include basic corporate information and history, financial information (can the company deliver without risk of bankruptcy), technical capability (used on major procurements of services, where the item has not previously been made or where the requirement could be met by varying technical means), product information such as stock availability and estimated completion period, and customer references that can be checked to determine a company's suitability (including educational and military background of its employees on the project --- college graduates and those with advanced college degrees may add \\"value\\" from the bidder). The ubiquitous availability of the Internet has made many government agencies turn either to state-run or vendor operated websites which provide listings of RFPs as well as RFIs and RFQs. Many allow vendors to sign up at no charge to receive e-mails of requests either generally or for specific categories of product or service for which there is an interest. In some cases, the entire process is done on-line with responses as scanned documents or PDF files uploaded to the server; in other cases, or for legal reasons, a response must be sent in hard copy form and/or on CD/DVD disc or flash drive by mail or delivery service. In the militaries of many countries, an RFP is often raised to fulfill an Operational Requirement (OR), after which the military procurement authority will normally issue a detailed technical specification against which tenders (i.e., bids) will be made by potential contractors. In the civilian use, an RFP is usually part of a complex sales process, also known as enterprise sales. RFPs often include specifications of the item, project or service for which a proposal is requested. The more detailed the specifications, the better the chances that the proposal provided will be accurate. Generally RFPs are sent to an approved supplier or vendor list. The bidders return a proposal by a set date and time. Late proposals may or may not be considered, depending on the terms of the initial RFP. The proposals are used to evaluate the suitability as a supplier, vendor, or institutional partner. Typically organizations follow a detailed vendor screening process to short list the vendors who should be invited for further rounds of negotiation. This screening process could either be vendor scoring models or internal discussions within the buyer organization. Discussions may be held on the proposals (often to clarify technical capabilities or to note errors in a proposal or in many cases to negotiate on the price). In most instances, only selected bidders may be invited to participate in subsequent bids, or may be asked to submit their best technical and financial proposal, commonly referred to as a Best and Final Offer (BAFO). Subsequent changes can be referred to as the Best and Revised Final Offer (BARFO). Once both the parties, i.e. a buyer organization and seller organization, agree on the technical and commercial terms and conditions of the proposal, they could move on to next steps like contract signing, statement of work which would formalize the purchase transactions. Today, many organizations are becoming more collaborative in the development of RFPs; this is especially true for universities and other major public entities making major technology purchases. RFP-issuing groups ask for specific use cases, rather than providing a list of features, and ensure they have the opportunity to include demonstrations, webinars and meetings as part of the RFP process to ensure they have a strong understanding of all competing products before making a purchase. Other requests *A request for association (RFA), also known as request for partnership or request for alliance, is a proposal from one party to another for acting together (usually in business) and sharing the benefits of this joint action. *A request for expression of interest (RFEI), is part of the EOI (expression of interest) discovery process in order to gather information regarding the potential procurement of the services sought, similar to the RFQ, sometimes done prior to publishing an RFP. *A request for information (RFI) is a proposal requested from a potential seller or a service provider to determine what products and services are potentially available in the marketplace to meet a buyer's needs and to know the capability of a seller in terms of offerings and strengths of the seller. RFIs are commonly used on major procurements, where a requirement could potentially be met through several alternate means. An RFI, however, is not an invitation to bid, is not binding on either the buyer or sellers, and may or may not lead to an RFP or RFQ. *A request for quotation (RFQ) is used when discussions with bidders are not required (mainly when the specifications of a product or service are already known) and when price is the main or only factor in selecting the successful bidder. An RFQ may also be used prior to issuing a full-blown RFP to determine general price ranges. In this scenario, products, services or suppliers may be selected from the RFQ results to bring in to further research in order to write a more fully fleshed out RFP. In commercial business practice, the RFQ is the most popularly used form of RFx, with many companies not understanding the distinction between the RFx's, and so defaulting to RFQ. *A request for qualifications (RFQ) also known as pre-qualification questionnaire (PQQ) is a document often distributed before initiation of the RFP process. It is used to gather vendor information from multiple companies to generate a pool of prospects. This eases the RFP review process by preemptively short-listing candidates which meet the desired qualifications. *A request for solution (RFS) is similar to a RFP, but more open and general. This allows the vendor or supplier the most flexibility of all RFx in expressing their solution, or their product and service combination. *A request for tender (RFT), also known as invitation to tender (ITT), is more commonly used by governments.

Humans conduct biofeedback naturally all the time, at varied levels of consciousness and intentionality. Biofeedback and the biofeedback loop can also be thought of as self-regulation. Some of the processes that can be controlled include brainwaves, muscle tone, skin conductance, heart rate and pain perception. Biofeedback may be used to improve health, performance, and the physiological changes that often occur in conjunction with changes to thoughts, emotions, and behavior. Recently, technologies have provided assistance with intentional biofeedback. Eventually, these changes may be maintained without the use of extra equipment, for no equipment is necessarily required to practice biofeedback. Biofeedback has been found to be effective for the treatment of headaches and migraines and ADHD, among other issues. Information coded biofeedback Information coded biofeedback is an evolving form and methodology in the field of biofeedback. Its uses may be applied in the areas of health, wellness and awareness. Biofeedback has its modern conventional roots in the early 1970s. Over the years, biofeedback as a discipline and a technology has continued to mature and express new versions of the method with novel interpretations in areas utilizing the electromyograph, electrodermograph, electroencephalograph and electrocardiogram among others. The concept of biofeedback is based on the fact that a wide variety of ongoing intrinsic natural functions of the organism occur at a level of awareness generally called the \\"unconscious\\". The biofeedback process is designed to interface with select aspects of these \\"unconscious\\" processes. The definition reads: Biofeedback is a process that enables an individual to learn how to change physiological activity for the purposes of improving health and performance. Precise instruments measure physiological activity such as brainwaves, heart function, breathing, muscle activity, and skin temperature. These instruments rapidly and accurately feed back information to the user. The presentation of this information‚Äîoften in conjunction with changes in thinking, emotions, and behavior‚Äîsupports desired physiological changes. Over time, these changes can endure without continued use of an instrument. A more simple definition could be: Biofeedback is the process of gaining greater awareness of many physiological functions primarily using instruments that provide information on the activity of those same systems, with a goal of being able to manipulate them at will. (Emphasis added by author.) In both of these definitions, a cardinal feature of the concept is the association of the \\"will\\" with the result of a new cognitive \\"learning\\" skill. Some examine this concept and do not necessarily ascribe it simply to a willful acquisition of a new learned skill but also extend the dynamics into the realms of a behavioristic conditioning (7). Behaviorism contends that it is possible to change the actions and functions of an organism by exposing it to a number of conditions or influences. Key to the concept is not only that the functions are unconscious but that conditioning processes themselves may be unconscious to the organism. Information coded biofeedback relies primarily on the behavior conditioning aspect of biofeedback in promoting significant changes in the functioning of the organism. The principle of \\"information\\" is both complex and, in part, controversial. The term itself is derived from the Latin verb informare which means literally \\"to bring into form or shape\\". The meaning of \\"information\\" is largely affected by the context of usage. Probably the simplest and perhaps most insightful definition of \\"information\\" was given by Gregory Bateson‚Äî\\"Information is news of change\\" or another as \\"the difference that makes a difference\\". Information may also be thought of as \\"any type of pattern that influences the formation or transformation of other patterns\\". Recognizing the inherent complexity of an organism, information coded biofeedback applies algorithmic calculations in a stochastic approach to identify significant probabilities in a limited set of possibilities. Sensor modalities =Electromyograph= The \\"Muscle Whistler\\", shown here with surface EMG electrodes, was an early biofeedback device developed by Harry Garland and Roger Melen in 1971. An electromyograph (EMG) uses surface electrodes to detect muscle action potentials from underlying skeletal muscles that initiate muscle contraction. Clinicians record the surface electromyogram (SEMG) using one or more active electrodes that are placed over a target muscle and a reference electrode that is placed within six inches of either active. The SEMG is measured in microvolts (millionths of a volt). In addition to surface electrodes, clinicians may also insert wires or needles intramuscularly to record an EMG signal. While this is more painful and often costly, the signal is more reliable since surface electrodes pick up cross talk from nearby muscles. The use of surface electrodes is also limited to superficial muscles, making the intramuscular approach beneficial to access signals from deeper muscles. The electrical activity picked up by the electrodes is recorded and displayed in the same fashion as the surface electrodes. Prior to placing surface electrodes, the skin is normally shaved, cleaned and exfoliated to get the best signal. Raw EMG signals resemble noise (electrical signal not coming from the muscle of interest) and the voltage fluctuates, therefore they are processed normally in three ways: rectification, filtering, and integration. This processing allows for a unified signal that is then able to be compared to other signals using the same processing techniques. Biofeedback therapists use EMG biofeedback when treating anxiety and worry, chronic pain, computer-related disorder, essential hypertension, headache (migraine, mixed headache, and tension-type headache), low back pain, physical rehabilitation (cerebral palsy, incomplete spinal cord lesions, and stroke), temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), torticollis, and fecal incontinence, urinary incontinence, and pelvic pain. Physical therapists have also used EMG biofeedback for evaluating muscle activation and providing feedback for their patients. =Feedback thermometer= A feedback thermometer detects skin temperature with a thermistor (a temperature- sensitive resistor) that is usually attached to a finger or toe and measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. Skin temperature mainly reflects arteriole diameter. Hand-warming and hand-cooling are produced by separate mechanisms, and their regulation involves different skills. Hand-warming involves arteriole vasodilation produced by a beta-2 adrenergic hormonal mechanism. Hand-cooling involves arteriole vasoconstriction produced by the increased firing of sympathetic C-fibers. Biofeedback therapists use temperature biofeedback when treating chronic pain, edema, headache (migraine and tension- type headache), essential hypertension, Raynaud's disease, anxiety, and stress. =Electrodermograph= An electrodermograph (EDG) measures skin electrical activity directly (skin conductance and skin potential) and indirectly (skin resistance) using electrodes placed over the digits or hand and wrist. Orienting responses to unexpected stimuli, arousal and worry, and cognitive activity can increase eccrine sweat gland activity, increasing the conductivity of the skin for electric current. In skin conductance, an electrodermograph imposes an imperceptible current across the skin and measures how easily it travels through the skin. When anxiety raises the level of sweat in a sweat duct, conductance increases. Skin conductance is measured in microsiemens (millionths of a siemens). In skin potential, a therapist places an active electrode over an active site (e.g., the palmar surface of the hand) and a reference electrode over a relatively inactive site (e.g., forearm). Skin potential is the voltage that develops between eccrine sweat glands and internal tissues and is measured in millivolts (thousandths of a volt). In skin resistance, also called galvanic skin response (GSR), an electrodermograph imposes a current across the skin and measures the amount of opposition it encounters. Skin resistance is measured in kŒ© (thousands of ohms). Biofeedback therapists use electrodermal biofeedback when treating anxiety disorders, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), and stress. Electrodermal biofeedback is used as an adjunct to psychotherapy to increase client awareness of their emotions. In addition, electrodermal measures have long served as one of the central tools in polygraphy (lie detection) because they reflect changes in anxiety or emotional activation. =Electroencephalograph= An electroencephalograph (EEG) measures the electrical activation of the brain from scalp sites located over the human cortex. The EEG shows the amplitude of electrical activity at each cortical site, the amplitude and relative power of various wave forms at each site, and the degree to which each cortical site fires in conjunction with other cortical sites (coherence and symmetry). The EEG uses precious metal electrodes to detect a voltage between at least two electrodes located on the scalp. The EEG records both excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that largely occur in dendrites in pyramidal cells located in macrocolumns, several millimeters in diameter, in the upper cortical layers. Neurofeedback monitors both slow and fast cortical potentials. Slow cortical potentials are gradual changes in the membrane potentials of cortical dendrites that last from 300 ms to several seconds. These potentials include the contingent negative variation (CNV), readiness potential, movement-related potentials (MRPs), and P300 and N400 potentials. Fast cortical potentials range from 0.5 Hz to 100 Hz. The main frequency ranges include delta, theta, alpha, the sensorimotor rhythm, low beta, high beta, and gamma. The thresholds or boundaries defining the frequency ranges vary considerably among professionals. Fast cortical potentials can be described by their predominant frequencies, but also by whether they are synchronous or asynchronous wave forms. Synchronous wave forms occur at regular periodic intervals, whereas asynchronous wave forms are irregular. The synchronous delta rhythm ranges from 0.5 to 3.5 Hz. Delta is the dominant frequency from ages 1 to 2, and is associated in adults with deep sleep and brain pathology like trauma and tumors, and learning disability. The synchronous theta rhythm ranges from 4 to 7 Hz. Theta is the dominant frequency in healthy young children and is associated with drowsiness or starting to sleep, REM sleep, hypnagogic imagery (intense imagery experienced before the onset of sleep), hypnosis, attention, and processing of cognitive and perceptual information. The synchronous alpha rhythm ranges from 8 to 13 Hz and is defined by its waveform and not by its frequency. Alpha activity can be observed in about 75% of awake, relaxed individuals and is replaced by low- amplitude desynchronized beta activity during movement, complex problem- solving, and visual focusing. This phenomenon is called alpha blocking. The synchronous sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) ranges from 12 to 15 Hz and is located over the sensorimotor cortex (central sulcus). The sensorimotor rhythm is associated with the inhibition of movement and reduced muscle tone. The beta rhythm consists of asynchronous waves and can be divided into low beta and high beta ranges (13‚Äì21 Hz and 20‚Äì32 Hz). Low beta is associated with activation and focused thinking. High beta is associated with anxiety, hypervigilance, panic, peak performance, and worry. EEG activity from 36 to 44 Hz is also referred to as gamma. Gamma activity is associated with perception of meaning and meditative awareness. Neurotherapists use EEG biofeedback when treating addiction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), learning disability, anxiety disorders (including worry, obsessive-compulsive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder), depression, migraine, and generalized seizures. =Photoplethysmograph= An emWave2 photoplethysmograph for monitoring heart rate variability Stone computer-based photoplethysmograph with ear sensor A photoplethysmograph (PPG) measures the relative blood flow through a digit using a photoplethysmographic (PPG) sensor attached by a Velcro band to the fingers or to the temple to monitor the temporal artery. An infrared light source is transmitted through or reflected off the tissue, detected by a phototransistor, and quantified in arbitrary units. Less light is absorbed when blood flow is greater, increasing the intensity of light reaching the sensor.Combatalade, D. (2009). Basics of heart rate variability applied to psychophysiology. Montreal, Canada: Thought Technology Ltd. A photoplethysmograph can measure blood volume pulse (BVP), which is the phasic change in blood volume with each heartbeat, heart rate, and heart rate variability (HRV), which consists of beat-to-beat differences in intervals between successive heartbeats. A photoplethysmograph can provide useful feedback when temperature feedback shows minimal change. This is because the PPG sensor is more sensitive than a thermistor to minute blood flow changes. Biofeedback therapists can use a photoplethysmograph to supplement temperature biofeedback when treating chronic pain, edema, headache (migraine and tension- type headache), essential hypertension, Raynaud's disease, anxiety, and stress. =Electrocardiogram= The electrocardiogram (ECG) uses electrodes placed on the torso, wrists, or legs, to measure the electrical activity of the heart and measures the interbeat interval (distances between successive R-wave peaks in the QRS complex). The interbeat interval, divided into 60 seconds, determines the heart rate at that moment. The statistical variability of that interbeat interval is what we call heart rate variability. The ECG method is more accurate than the PPG method in measuring heart rate variability. Biofeedback therapists use heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback when treating asthma, COPD, depression, anxiety, fibromyalgia, heart disease, and unexplained abdominal pain. Research shows that HRV biofeedback can also be used to improve physiological and psychological wellbeing in healthy individuals. HRV data from both polyplethysmographs and electrocardiograms are analyzed via mathematical transformations such as the commonly-used fast Fourier transform (FFT). The FFT splits the HRV data into a power spectrum, revealing the waveform's constituent frequencies. Among those constituent frequencies, high-frequency (HF) and low-frequency (LF) components are defined as above and below .15 Hz, respectively. As a rule of thumb, the LF component of HRV represents sympathetic activity, and the HF component represents parasympathetic activity. The two main components are often represented as a LF/HF ratio and used to express sympathovagal balance. Some researchers consider a third, medium-frequency (MF) component from .08 Hz to .15 Hz, which has been shown to increase in power during times of appreciation. =Pneumograph= A pneumograph or respiratory strain gauge uses a flexible sensor band that is placed around the chest, abdomen, or both. The strain gauge method can provide feedback about the relative expansion/contraction of the chest and abdomen, and can measure respiratory rate (the number of breaths per minute). Clinicians can use a pneumograph to detect and correct dysfunctional breathing patterns and behaviors. Dysfunctional breathing patterns include clavicular breathing (breathing that primarily relies on the external intercostals and the accessory muscles of respiration to inflate the lungs), reverse breathing (breathing where the abdomen expands during exhalation and contracts during inhalation), and thoracic breathing (shallow breathing that primarily relies on the external intercostals to inflate the lungs). Dysfunctional breathing behaviors include apnea (suspension of breathing), gasping, sighing, and wheezing. A pneumograph is often used in conjunction with an electrocardiograph (ECG) or photoplethysmograph (PPG) in heart rate variability (HRV) training. Biofeedback therapists use pneumograph biofeedback with patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders, asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (COPD), essential hypertension, panic attacks, and stress. =Capnometer= A capnometer or capnograph uses an infrared detector to measure end-tidal (the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in expired air at the end of expiration) exhaled through the nostril into a latex tube. The average value of end-tidal for a resting adult is 5% (). A capnometer is a sensitive index of the quality of patient breathing. Shallow, rapid, and effortful breathing lowers , while deep, slow, effortless breathing increases it. Biofeedback therapists use capnometric biofeedback to supplement respiratory strain gauge biofeedback with patients diagnosed with anxiety disorders, asthma, chronic pulmonary obstructive disorder (COPD), essential hypertension, panic attacks, and stress. =Rheoencephalograph= Rheoencephalography (REG), or brain blood flow biofeedback, is a biofeedback technique of a conscious control of blood flow. An electronic device called a rheoencephalograph [from Greek rheos stream, anything flowing, from rhein to flow] is utilized in brain blood flow biofeedback. Electrodes are attached to the skin at certain points on the head and permit the device to measure continuously the electrical conductivity of the tissues of structures located between the electrodes. The brain blood flow technique is based on non-invasive method of measuring bio-impedance. Changes in bio-impedance are generated by blood volume and blood flow and registered by a rheographic device. The pulsative bio-impedance changes directly reflect the total blood flow of the deep structures of brain due to high frequency impedance measurements. =Hemoencephalography= Hemoencephalography or HEG biofeedback is a functional infrared imaging technique. As its name describes, it measures the differences in the color of light reflected back through the scalp based on the relative amount of oxygenated and unoxygenated blood in the brain. Research continues to determine its reliability, validity, and clinical applicability. HEG is used to treat ADHD and migraine, and for research. = Pressure = Pressure can be monitored as a patient performs exercises while resting against an air-filled cushion.Chattanooga Stabilizer Pressure Biofeeedback This is pertinent to physiotherapy. Alternatively, the patient may actively grip or press against an air-filled cushion of custom shape.pab¬Æ, Pressure Air Biofeedback Applications =Urinary incontinence= Mowrer detailed the use of a bedwetting alarm that sounds when children urinate while asleep. This simple biofeedback device can quickly teach children to wake up when their bladders are full and to contract the urinary sphincter and relax the detrusor muscle, preventing further urine release. Through classical conditioning, sensory feedback from a full bladder replaces the alarm and allows children to continue sleeping without urinating. Kegel developed the perineometer in 1947 to treat urinary incontinence (urine leakage) in women whose pelvic floor muscles are weakened during pregnancy and childbirth. The perineometer, which is inserted into the vagina to monitor pelvic floor muscle contraction, satisfies all the requirements of a biofeedback device and enhances the effectiveness of popular Kegel exercises. Contradicting this, a 2013 randomized controlled trial found no benefit of adding biofeedback to pelvic floor muscle exercise in stress urinary incontinence. In another randomized controlled trial the addition of biofeedback to the training of pelvic floor muscles for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence, improved pelvic floor muscle function, reduced urinary symptoms, and improved of the quality of life. Research has shown that biofeedback can improve the efficacy of pelvic floor exercises and help restore proper bladder functions. The mode of action of vaginal cones, for instance involves a biological biofeedback mechanism. Studies have shown that biofeedback obtained with vaginal cones is as effective as biofeedback induced through physiotherapy electrostimulation In 1992, the United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research recommended biofeedback as a first-line treatment for adult urinary incontinence. =Fecal incontinence and anismus= Biofeedback is a major treatment for anismus (paradoxical contraction of puborectalis during defecation). This therapy directly evolved from the investigation anorectal manometry where a probe that can record pressure is placed in the anal canal. Biofeedback therapy is also a commonly used and researched therapy for fecal incontinence, but the benefits are uncertain. Biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered. It is also unknown if one type has benefits over another. The aims have been described as to enhance either the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR), rectal sensitivity (by discrimination of progressively smaller volumes of a rectal balloon and promptly contracting the external anal sphincter (EAS)), or the strength and endurance of the EAS contraction. Three general types of biofeedback have been described, though they are not mutually exclusive, with many protocols combining these elements. Similarly there is variance of the length of both the individual sessions and the overall length of the training, and if home exercises are performed in addition and how. In rectal sensitivity training, a balloon is placed in the rectum, and is gradually distended until there is a sensation of rectal filling. Successively smaller volume reinflations of the balloon aim to help the person detect rectal distension at a lower threshold, giving more time to contract the EAS and prevent incontinence, or to journey to the toilet. Alternatively, in those with urge incontinence/ rectal hypersensitivity, training is aimed at teaching the person to tolerate progressively larger volumes. Strength training may involve electromyography (EMG) skin electrodes, manometric pressures, intra-anal EMG, or endoanal ultrasound. One of these measures are used to relay the muscular activity or anal canal pressure during anal sphincter exercise. Performance and progress can be monitored in this manner. Co-ordination training involves the placing of 3 balloons, in the rectum and in the upper and lower anal canal. The rectal balloon is inflated to trigger the RAIR, an event often followed by incontinence. Co-ordination training aims to teach voluntary contraction of EAS when the RAIR occurs (i.e. when there is rectal distension). =EEG= Caton recorded spontaneous electrical potentials from the exposed cortical surface of monkeys and rabbits, and was the first to measure event-related potentials (EEG responses to stimuli) in 1875. Danilevsky published Investigations in the Physiology of the Brain, which explored the relationship between the EEG and states of consciousness in 1877. Beck published studies of spontaneous electrical potentials detected from the brains of dogs and rabbits, and was the first to document alpha blocking, where light alters rhythmic oscillations, in 1890. Sherrington introduced the terms neuron and synapse and published the Integrative Action of the Nervous System in 1906. Pravdich-Neminsky photographed the EEG and event related potentials from dogs, demonstrated a 12‚Äì14 Hz rhythm that slowed during asphyxiation, and introduced the term electrocerebrogram in 1912. Forbes reported the replacement of the string galvanometer with a vacuum tube to amplify the EEG in 1920. The vacuum tube became the de facto standard by 1936. Berger (1924) published the first human EEG data. He recorded electrical potentials from his son Klaus's scalp. At first he believed that he had discovered the physical mechanism for telepathy but was disappointed that the electromagnetic variations disappear only millimeters away from the skull. (He did continue to believe in telepathy throughout his life, however, having had a particularly confirming event regarding his sister). He viewed the EEG as analogous to the ECG and introduced the term elektenkephalogram. He believed that the EEG had diagnostic and therapeutic promise in measuring the impact of clinical interventions. Berger showed that these potentials were not due to scalp muscle contractions. He first identified the alpha rhythm, which he called the Berger rhythm, and later identified the beta rhythm and sleep spindles. He demonstrated that alterations in consciousness are associated with changes in the EEG and associated the beta rhythm with alertness. He described interictal activity (EEG potentials between seizures) and recorded a partial complex seizure in 1933. Finally, he performed the first QEEG, which is the measurement of the signal strength of EEG frequencies. Adrian and Matthews confirmed Berger's findings in 1934 by recording their own EEGs using a cathode-ray oscilloscope. Their demonstration of EEG recording at the 1935 Physiological Society meetings in England caused its widespread acceptance. Adrian used himself as a subject and demonstrated the phenomenon of alpha blocking, where opening his eyes suppressed alpha rhythms. Gibbs, Davis, and Lennox inaugurated clinical electroencephalography in 1935 by identifying abnormal EEG rhythms associated with epilepsy, including interictal spike waves and 3 Hz activity in absence seizures. Bremer used the EEG to show how sensory signals affect vigilance in 1935. Walter (1937, 1953) named the delta waves and theta waves, and the contingent negative variation (CNV), a slow cortical potential that may reflect expectancy, motivation, intention to act, or attention. He located an occipital lobe source for alpha waves and demonstrated that delta waves can help locate brain lesions like tumors. He improved Berger's electroencephalograph and pioneered EEG topography. Kleitman has been recognized as the \\"Father of American sleep research\\" for his seminal work in the regulation of sleep-wake cycles, circadian rhythms, the sleep patterns of different age groups, and the effects of sleep deprivation. He discovered the phenomenon of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with his graduate student Aserinsky in 1953. Dement, another of Kleitman's students, described the EEG architecture and phenomenology of sleep stages and the transitions between them in 1955, associated REM sleep with dreaming in 1957, and documented sleep cycles in another species, cats, in 1958, which stimulated basic sleep research. He established the Stanford University Sleep Research Center in 1970. Andersen and Andersson (1968) proposed that thalamic pacemakers project synchronous alpha rhythms to the cortex via thalamocortical circuits. Kamiya (1968) demonstrated that the alpha rhythm in humans could be operantly conditioned. He published an influential article in Psychology Today that summarized research that showed that subjects could learn to discriminate when alpha was present or absent, and that they could use feedback to shift the dominant alpha frequency about 1 Hz. Almost half of his subjects reported experiencing a pleasant \\"alpha state\\" characterized as an \\"alert calmness.\\" These reports may have contributed to the perception of alpha biofeedback as a shortcut to a meditative state. He also studied the EEG correlates of meditative states. Brown (1970) demonstrated the clinical use of alpha-theta biofeedback. In research designed to identify the subjective states associated with EEG rhythms, she trained subjects to increase the abundance of alpha, beta, and theta activity using visual feedback and recorded their subjective experiences when the amplitude of these frequency bands increased. She also helped popularize biofeedback by publishing a series of books, including New Mind, New body (1974) and Stress and the Art of Biofeedback (1977). Mulholland and Peper (1971) showed that occipital alpha increases with eyes open and not focused, and is disrupted by visual focusing; a rediscovery of alpha blocking. Green and Green (1986) investigated voluntary control of internal states by individuals like Swami Rama and American Indian medicine man Rolling Thunder both in India and at the Menninger Foundation. They brought portable biofeedback equipment to India and monitored practitioners as they demonstrated self-regulation. A film containing footage from their investigations was released as Biofeedback: The Yoga of the West (1974). They developed alpha-theta training at the Menninger Foundation from the 1960s to the 1990s. They hypothesized that theta states allow access to unconscious memories and increase the impact of prepared images or suggestions. Their alpha-theta research fostered Peniston's development of an alpha-theta addiction protocol. Sterman (1972) showed that cats and human subjects could be operantly trained to increase the amplitude of the sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) recorded from the sensorimotor cortex. He demonstrated that SMR production protects cats against drug-induced generalized seizures (tonic- clonic seizures involving loss of consciousness) and reduces the frequency of seizures in humans diagnosed with epilepsy. He found that his SMR protocol, which uses visual and auditory EEG biofeedback, normalizes their EEGs (SMR increases while theta and beta decrease toward normal values) even during sleep. Sterman also co-developed the Sterman-Kaiser (SKIL) QEEG database. Birbaumer and colleagues (1981) have studied feedback of slow cortical potentials since the late 1970s. They have demonstrated that subjects can learn to control these DC potentials and have studied the efficacy of slow cortical potential biofeedback in treating ADHD, epilepsy, migraine, and schizophrenia. Lubar (1989) studied SMR biofeedback to treat attention disorders and epilepsy in collaboration with Sterman. He demonstrated that SMR training can improve attention and academic performance in children diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADHD). He documented the importance of theta-to-beta ratios in ADHD and developed theta suppression- beta enhancement protocols to decrease these ratios and improve student performance. The Neuropsychiatric EEG-Based Assessment Aid (NEBA) System a device used to measure the Theta-to-Beta ratio was approved as a tool to assist in diagnosis of ADHD on July 15, 2013. However, the field has recently moved away from the measure. This move has been caused by the general change in the population norms in the past 20 years (most likely due to the change in the average amount of sleep in young people). =Electrodermal system= Fer√© demonstrated the exosomatic method of recording of skin electrical activity by passing a small current through the skin in 1888. Tarchanoff used the endosomatic method by recording the difference in skin electrical potential from points on the skin surface in 1889; no external current was applied. Jung employed the galvanometer, which used the exosomatic method, in 1907 to study unconscious emotions in word-association experiments. Marjorie and Hershel Toomim (1975) published a landmark article about the use of GSR biofeedback in psychotherapy. Meyer and Reich discussed similar material in a British publication. =Musculoskeletal system= Jacobson (1930) developed hardware to measure EMG voltages over time, showed that cognitive activity (like imagery) affects EMG levels, introduced the deep relaxation method Progressive Relaxation, and wrote Progressive Relaxation (1929) and You Must Relax (1934). He prescribed daily Progressive Relaxation practice to treat diverse psychophysiological disorders like hypertension. Several researchers showed that human subjects could learn precise control of individual motor units (motor neurons and the muscle fibers they control). Lindsley (1935) found that relaxed subjects could suppress motor unit firing without biofeedback training. Harrison and Mortensen (1962) trained subjects using visual and auditory EMG biofeedback to control individual motor units in the tibialis anterior muscle of the leg. Basmajian (1963) instructed subjects using unfiltered auditory EMG biofeedback to control separate motor units in the abductor pollicis muscle of the thumb in his Single Motor Unit Training (SMUT) studies. His best subjects coordinated several motor units to produce drum rolls. Basmajian demonstrated practical applications for neuromuscular rehabilitation, pain management, and headache treatment. Marinacci (1960) applied EMG biofeedback to neuromuscular disorders (where proprioception is disrupted) including Bell Palsy (one-sided facial paralysis), polio, and stroke. \\"While Marinacci used EMG to treat neuromuscular disorders, his colleagues used the EMG only for diagnosis. They were unable to recognize its potential as a teaching tool even when the evidence stared them in the face! Many electromyographers who performed nerve conduction studies used visual and auditory feedback to reduce interference when a patient recruited too many motor units. Even though they used EMG biofeedback to guide the patient to relax so that clean diagnostic EMG tests could be recorded, they were unable to envision EMG biofeedback treatment of motor disorders.\\" Whatmore and Kohli (1968) introduced the concept of dysponesis (misplaced effort) to explain how functional disorders (where body activity is disturbed) develop. Bracing your shoulders when you hear a loud sound illustrates dysponesis, since this action does not protect against injury. These clinicians applied EMG biofeedback to diverse functional problems like headache and hypertension. They reported case follow-ups ranging from 6 to 21 years. This was long compared with typical 0-24 month follow-ups in the clinical literature. Their data showed that skill in controlling misplaced efforts was positively related to clinical improvement. Last, they wrote The Pathophysiology and Treatment of Functional Disorders (1974) that outlined their treatment of functional disorders. Wolf (1983) integrated EMG biofeedback into physical therapy to treat stroke patients and conducted landmark stroke outcome studies. Peper (1997) applied SEMG to the workplace, studied the ergonomics of computer use, and promoted \\"healthy computing.\\" Taub (1999, 2006) demonstrated the clinical efficacy of constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) for the treatment of spinal cord- injured and stroke patients. =Cardiovascular system= Shearn (1962) operantly trained human subjects to increase their heart rates by 5 beats-per- minute to avoid electric shock. In contrast to Shearn's slight heart rate increases, Swami Rama used yoga to produce atrial flutter at an average 306 beats per minute before a Menninger Foundation audience. This briefly stopped his heart's pumping of blood and silenced his pulse. Engel and Chism (1967) operantly trained subjects to decrease, increase, and then decrease their heart rates (this was analogous to ON-OFF-ON EEG training). He then used this approach to teach patients to control their rate of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), where the ventricles contract too soon. Engel conceptualized this training protocol as illness onset training, since patients were taught to produce and then suppress a symptom. Peper has similarly taught asthmatics who wheeze to better control their breathing. Schwartz (1971, 1972) examined whether specific patterns of cardiovascular activity are easier to learn than others due to biological constraints. He examined the constraints on learning integrated (two autonomic responses change in the same direction) and differentiated (two autonomic responses change inversely) patterns of blood pressure and heart rate change. Schultz and Luthe (1969) developed Autogenic Training, which is a deep relaxation exercise derived from hypnosis. This procedure combines passive volition with imagery in a series of three treatment procedures (standard Autogenic exercises, Autogenic neutralization, and Autogenic meditation). Clinicians at the Menninger Foundation coupled an abbreviated list of standard exercises with thermal biofeedback to create autogenic biofeedback. Luthe (1973) also published a series of six volumes titled Autogenic therapy. Fahrion and colleagues (1986) reported on an 18-26 session treatment program for hypertensive patients. The Menninger program combined breathing modification, autogenic biofeedback for the hands and feet, and frontal EMG training. The authors reported that 89% of their medication patients discontinued or reduced medication by one-half while significantly lowering blood pressure. While this study did not include a double-blind control, the outcome rate was impressive. Freedman and colleagues (1991) demonstrated that hand-warming and hand-cooling are produced by different mechanisms. The primary hand-warming mechanism is beta-adrenergic (hormonal), while the main hand-cooling mechanism is alpha- adrenergic and involves sympathetic C-fibers. This contradicts the traditional view that finger blood flow is controlled exclusively by sympathetic C-fibers. The traditional model asserts that, when firing is slow, hands warm; when firing is rapid, hands cool. Freedman and colleagues' studies support the view that hand-warming and hand-cooling represent entirely different skills. Vaschillo and colleagues (1983) published the first studies of heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback with cosmonauts and treated patients diagnosed with psychiatric and psychophysiological disorders. Lehrer collaborated with Smetankin and Potapova in treating pediatric asthma patients and published influential articles on HRV asthma treatment in the medical journal Chest. The most direct effect of HRV biofeedback is on the baroreflex, a homeostatic reflex that helps control blood pressure fluctuations. When blood pressure goes up, the baroreflex makes heart rate go down. The opposite happens when blood pressure goes down. Because it takes about 5 seconds for blood pressure to change after changes in heart rate (think of different amounts of blood flowing through the same sized tube), the baroreflex produces a rhythm in heart rate with a period of about 10 seconds. Another rhythm in heart rate is caused by respiration (respiratory sinus arrhythmia), such that heart rate rises during inhalation and falls during exhalation. During HRV biofeedback, these two reflexes stimulate each other, stimulating resonance properties of the cardiovascular system caused by the inherent rhythm in the baroreflex, and thus causing very big oscillations in heart rate and large-amplitude stimulation of the baroreflex. Thus HRV biofeedback exercises the baroreflex, and strengthens it. This apparently has the effect of modulating autonomic reactivity to stimulation. Because the baroreflex is controlled through brain stem mechanisms that communicate directly with the insula and amygdala, which control emotion, HRV biofeedback also appears to modulate emotional reactivity, and to help people suffering from anxiety, stress, and depression Emotions are intimately linked to heart health, which is linked to physical and mental health. In general, good mental and physical health are correlated with positive emotions and high heart rate variability (HRV) modulated by mostly high frequencies. High HRV has been correlated with increased executive functioning skills such as memory and reaction time. Biofeedback that increased HRV and shifted power toward HF (high-frequencies) has been shown to lower blood pressure. On the other hand, LF (low-frequency) power in the heart is associated with sympathetic vagal activity, which is known to increase the risk of heart attack. LF-dominated HRV power spectra are also directly associated with higher mortality rates in healthy individuals, and among individuals with mood disorders. Anger and frustration increase the LF range of HRV. Other studies have shown anger to increase the risk of heart attack, so researchers at the Heartmath Institute have made the connection between emotions and physical health via HRV. Because emotions have such an impact on cardiac function, which cascades to numerous other biological processes, emotional regulation techniques are able to effect practical, psychophysiological change. McCraty et al. discovered that feelings of gratitude increased HRV and moved its power spectrum toward the MF (mid- frequency) and HF (high-frequency) ranges, while decreasing LF (low-frequency) power. The Heartmath Institute's patented techniques involve engendering feelings of gratitude and happiness, focusing on the physical location of the heart, and breathing in 10-second cycles. Other techniques have been shown to improve HRV, such as strenuous aerobic exercise, and meditation. =Pain= Chronic back pain Newton-John, Spense, and Schotte (1994) compared the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and Electromyographic Biofeedback (EMG-Biofeedback) for 44 participants with chronic low back pain. Newton-John et al. (1994) split the participants into two groups, then measured the intensity of pain, the participants' perceived disability, and depression before treatment, after treatment and again six months later. Newton-John et al.(1994) found no significant differences between the group which received CBT and the group which received EMG-Biofeedback. This seems to indicate that biofeedback is as effective as CBT in chronic low back pain. Comparing the results of the groups before treatment and after treatment, indicates that EMG-Biofeedback reduced pain, disability, and depression as much as by half. Muscle pain Budzynski and Stoyva (1969) showed that EMG biofeedback could reduce frontalis muscle (forehead) contraction. They demonstrated in 1973 that analog (proportional) and binary (ON or OFF) visual EMG biofeedback were equally helpful in lowering masseter SEMG levels. McNulty, Gevirtz, Hubbard, and Berkoff (1994) proposed that sympathetic nervous system innervation of muscle spindles underlies trigger points. Tension headache Budzynski, Stoyva, Adler, and Mullaney (1973) reported that auditory frontalis EMG biofeedback combined with home relaxation practice lowered tension headache frequency and frontalis EMG levels. A control group that received noncontingent (false) auditory feedback did not improve. This study helped make the frontalis muscle the placement-of-choice in EMG assessment and treatment of headache and other psychophysiological disorders.Budzynski, T. H., Stoyva, J. M., Adler, C. S., & Mullaney, D. EMG biofeedback and tension headache: A controlled-outcome study. Psychosomatic Medicine, 35, 484-496. Migraine Sargent, Green, and Walters (1972, 1973) demonstrated that hand-warming could abort migraines and that autogenic biofeedback training could reduce headache activity. The early Menninger migraine studies, although methodologically weak (no pretreatment baselines, control groups, or random assignment to conditions), strongly influenced migraine treatment. A 2013 review classified biofeedback among the techniques that might be of benefit in the management of chronic migraine. Phantom- limb pain Flor (2002) trained amputees to detect the location and frequency of shocks delivered to their stumps, which resulted in an expansion of corresponding cortical regions and significant reduction of their phantom limb pain. =Financial decision making= Financial traders use biofeedback as a tool for regulating their level of emotional arousal in order to make better financial decisions. The technology company Philips and the Dutch bank ABN AMRO developed a biofeedback device for retail investors based on a galvanic skin response sensor. Astor et al. (2013) developed a biofeedback based serious game in which financial decision makers can learn how to effectively regulate their emotions using heart rate measurements. =Stress reduction= A randomized study by Sutarto et al. assessed the effect of resonant breathing biofeedback (recognize and control involuntary heart rate variability) among manufacturing operators; depression, anxiety and stress significantly decreased. Heart rate variability data can be analyzed with deep neural networks to accurately predict stress levels. This technology is utilized in a mobile app in combination with mindfulness techniques to effectively promote stress reduction. =Macular disease of the retina= A 2012 observational study by Pacella et al. found a significant improvement in both visual acuity and fixation treating patients suffering from age-related macular degeneration or macular degeneration with biofeedback treatment through MP-1 microperimeter. Clinical effectiveness =Research= Moss, LeVaque, and Hammond (2004) observed that \\"Biofeedback and neurofeedback seem to offer the kind of evidence-based practice that the healthcare establishment is demanding.\\" \\"From the beginning biofeedback developed as a research-based approach emerging directly from laboratory research on psychophysiology and behavior therapy. The ties of biofeedback/neurofeedback to the biomedical paradigm and to research are stronger than is the case for many other behavioral interventions\\" (p. 151). The Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback (AAPB) and the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research (ISNR) have collaborated in validating and rating treatment protocols to address questions about the clinical efficacy of biofeedback and neurofeedback applications, like ADHD and headache. In 2001, Donald Moss, then president of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback, and Jay Gunkelman, president of the International Society for Neurofeedback and Research, appointed a task force to establish standards for the efficacy of biofeedback and neurofeedback. The Task Force document was published in 2002, and a series of white papers followed, reviewing the efficacy of a series of disorders. The white papers established the efficacy of biofeedback for functional anorectal disorders, attention deficit disorder, facial pain and temporomandibular joint dysfunction, hypertension, urinary incontinence, Raynaud's phenomenon, substance abuse, and headache. A broader review was published and later updated, applying the same efficacy standards to the entire range of medical and psychological disorders. The 2008 edition reviewed the efficacy of biofeedback for over 40 clinical disorders, ranging from alcoholism/substance abuse to vulvar vestibulitis. The ratings for each disorder depend on the nature of research studies available on each disorder, ranging from anecdotal reports to double blind studies with a control group. Thus, a lower rating may reflect the lack of research rather than the ineffectiveness of biofeedback for the problem. The randomized trial by Dehli et al. compared if the injection of a bulking agent in the anal canal was superior to sphincter training with biofeedback to treat fecal incontinence. Both methods lead to an improvement of FI, but comparisons of St Mark's scores between the groups showed no differences in effect between treatments. =Efficacy= Yucha and Montgomery's (2008) ratings are listed for the five levels of efficacy recommended by a joint Task Force and adopted by the Boards of Directors of the Association for Applied Psychophysiology (AAPB) and the International Society for Neuronal Regulation (ISNR). From weakest to strongest, these levels include: not empirically supported, possibly efficacious, probably efficacious, efficacious, and efficacious and specific. Level 1: Not empirically supported. This designation includes applications supported by anecdotal reports and/or case studies in non-peer-reviewed venues. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned eating disorders, immune function, spinal cord injury, and syncope to this category. Level 2: Possibly efficacious. This designation requires at least one study of sufficient statistical power with well-identified outcome measures but lacking randomized assignment to a control condition internal to the study. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned asthma, autism, Bell palsy, cerebral palsy, COPD, coronary artery disease, cystic fibrosis, depression, erectile dysfunction, fibromyalgia, hand dystonia, irritable bowel syndrome, PTSD, repetitive strain injury, respiratory failure, stroke, tinnitus, and urinary incontinence in children to this category. Level 3: Probably efficacious. This designation requires multiple observational studies, clinical studies, waitlist-controlled studies, and within subject and intrasubject replication studies that demonstrate efficacy. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned alcoholism and substance abuse, arthritis, diabetes mellitus, fecal disorders in children, fecal incontinence in adults, insomnia, pediatric headache, traumatic brain injury, urinary incontinence in males, and vulvar vestibulitis (vulvodynia) to this category. Level 4: Efficacious. This designation requires the satisfaction of six criteria: (a) In a comparison with a no-treatment control group, alternative treatment group, or sham (placebo) control using randomized assignment, the investigational treatment is shown to be statistically significantly superior to the control condition or the investigational treatment is equivalent to a treatment of established efficacy in a study with sufficient power to detect moderate differences. (b) The studies have been conducted with a population treated for a specific problem, for whom inclusion criteria are delineated in a reliable, operationally defined manner. (c) The study used valid and clearly specified outcome measures related to the problem being treated. (d) The data are subjected to appropriate data analysis. (e) The diagnostic and treatment variables and procedures are clearly defined in a manner that permits replication of the study by independent researchers. (f) The superiority or equivalence of the investigational treatment has been shown in at least two independent research settings. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, chronic pain, epilepsy, constipation (adult), headache (adult), hypertension, motion sickness, Raynaud's disease, and temporomandibular joint dysfunction to this category. Level 5: Efficacious and specific. The investigational treatment must be shown to be statistically superior to credible sham therapy, pill, or alternative bona fide treatment in at least two independent research settings. Yucha and Montgomery (2008) assigned urinary incontinence (females) to this category. =Criticisms= In a healthcare environment that emphasizes cost containment and evidence-based practice, biofeedback and neurofeedback professionals continue to address skepticism in the medical community about the cost-effectiveness and efficacy of their treatments. Critics question how these treatments compare with conventional behavioral and medical interventions on efficacy and cost.

History Claude Bernard proposed in 1865 that the body strives to maintain a steady state in the internal environment (milieu int√©rieur), introducing the concept of homeostasis. In 1885, J.R. Tarchanoff showed that voluntary control of heart rate could be fairly direct (cortical-autonomic) and did not depend on \\"cheating\\" by altering breathing rate. In 1901, J. H. Bair studied voluntary control of the retrahens aurem muscle that wiggles the ear, discovering that subjects learned this skill by inhibiting interfering muscles and demonstrating that skeletal muscles are self-regulated. Alexander Graham Bell attempted to teach the deaf to speak through the use of two devices‚Äîthe phonautograph, created by √âdouard-L√©on Scott's, and a manometric flame. The former translated sound vibrations into tracings on smoked glass to show their acoustic waveforms, while the latter allowed sound to be displayed as patterns of light. After World War II, mathematician Norbert Wiener developed cybernetic theory, that proposed that systems are controlled by monitoring their results. The participants at the landmark 1969 conference at the Surfrider Inn in Santa Monica coined the term biofeedback from Wiener's feedback. The conference resulted in the founding of the Bio-Feedback Research Society, which permitted normally isolated researchers to contact and collaborate with each other, as well as popularizing the term \\"biofeedback.\\" The work of B.F. Skinner led researchers to apply operant conditioning to biofeedback, decide which responses could be voluntarily controlled and which could not. In the first experimental demonstration of biofeedback Shearn169 used these procedures with heart rate. The effects of the perception of autonomic nervous system activity was initially explored by George Mandler's group in 1958. In 1965, Maia Lisina combined classical and operant conditioning to train subjects to change blood vessel diameter, eliciting and displaying reflexive blood flow changes to teach subjects how to voluntarily control the temperature of their skin. In 1974, H.D. Kimmel trained subjects to sweat using the galvanic skin response. Hinduism: Biofeedback systems have been known in India and some other countries for millennia. Ancient Hindu practices like yoga and Pranayama (breathing techniques) are essentially biofeedback methods. Many yogis and sadhus have been known to exercise control over their physiological processes. In addition to recent research on Yoga, Paul Brunton, the British writer who travelled extensively in India, has written about many cases he has witnessed. =Timeline= 1958 ‚Äì G.

This project explores the way in which emotional reactions filter and distort human perception and observation. During the performance, biofeedback medical technology, such as the EEG, body temperature variations, heart rate, and galvanic responses, are used to analyze an audience's emotions while they watch the video art. Using these signals, the music changes so that the consequent sound environment simultaneously mirrors and influences the viewer's emotional state. More information is available at the website of the CNRS French National Center of Neural Research. * Charles Wehrenberg implemented competitive-relaxation as a gaming paradigm with the Will Ball Games circa 1973. In the first bio-mechanical versions, comparative GSR inputs monitored each player's relaxation response and moved the Will Ball across a playing field appropriately using stepper motors.WillBall gaming table 1973 In 1984, Wehrenberg programmed the Will Ball games for Apple II computers. The Will Ball game itself is described as pure competitive-relaxation; Brain Ball is a duel between one player's left- and right-brain hemispheres; Mood Ball is an obstacle-based game; Psycho Dice is a psycho-kinetic game. In 1999 The HeartMath Institute developed an educational system based on heart rhythm measurement and display on a Personal Computer (Windows/Macintosh). Their systems have been copied by many but are still unique in the way they assist people to learn about and self-manage their physiology. A handheld version of their system was released in 2006 and is completely portable, being the size of a small mobile phone and having rechargeable batteries. With this unit, one can move around and go about daily business while gaining feedback about inner psycho-physiological states. * In 2001, the company Journey to Wild Divine began producing biofeedback hardware and software for the Macintosh and Windows operating systems. Third-party and open-source software and games are also available for the Wild Divine hardware.

Playing these instruments can be learned through a process of biofeedback. * In the mid-1970s, an episode of the television series The Bionic Woman featured a doctor who could \\"heal\\" himself using biofeedback techniques to communicate to his body and react to stimuli. For example, he could exhibit \\"super\\" powers, such as walking on hot coals, by feeling the heat on the sole of his feet and then convincing his body to react by sending large quantities of perspiration to compensate. He could also convince his body to deliver extremely high levels of adrenalin to provide more energy to allow him to run faster and jump higher. When injured, he could slow his heart rate to reduce blood pressure, send extra platelets to aid in clotting a wound, and direct white blood cells to an area to attack infection. * In the science-fiction book Quantum Lens by Douglas E.

Originally established in 1890 as General Grant National Park, the park was greatly expanded and renamed to Kings Canyon National Park on March 4, 1940. The park's namesake, Kings Canyon, is a rugged glacier-carved valley more than a mile (1,600 m) deep. Other natural features include multiple peaks, high mountain meadows, swift- flowing rivers, and some of the world's largest stands of giant sequoia trees. Kings Canyon is north of and contiguous with Sequoia National Park, and both parks are jointly administered by the National Park Service as the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. The majority of the park, drained by the Middle and South Forks of the Kings River and many smaller streams, is designated wilderness. Tourist facilities are concentrated in two areas: Grant Grove, home to General Grant (the second largest tree in the world, measured by trunk volume) and Cedar Grove, located in the heart of Kings Canyon. Overnight hiking is required to access most of the park's backcountry, or high country, which for much of the year is covered in deep snow. The combined Pacific Crest Trail/John Muir Trail, a backpacking route, traverses the entire length of the park from north to south. General Grant National Park was initially created to protect a small area of giant sequoias from logging. Although John Muir's visits brought public attention to the huge wilderness area to the east, it took more than fifty years for the rest of Kings Canyon to be designated a national park. Environmental groups, park visitors and many local politicians wanted to see the area preserved; however, development interests wanted to build hydroelectric dams in the canyon. Even after President Franklin D. Roosevelt expanded the park in 1940, the fight continued until 1965, when the Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley dam sites were finally annexed into the park. As visitation rose post‚ÄìWorld War II, further debate took place over whether the park should be developed as a tourist resort, or retained as a more natural environment restricted to simpler recreation such as hiking and camping. Ultimately, the preservation lobby prevailed and today, the park has only limited services and lodgings despite its size. Due to this and the lack of road access to most of the park, Kings Canyon remains the least visited of the major Sierra parks, with just under 700,000 visitors in 2017 compared to 1.3 million visitors at Sequoia and over 4 million at Yosemite. Geography and natural history Map of Kings Canyon National Park (click to enlarge) Kings Canyon National Park, located on the western slope of the Sierra Nevada to the east of the San Joaquin Valley, is divided into two distinct sections. The smaller and older western section centers around Grant Grove ‚Äì home of many of the park's sequoias ‚Äì and has most of the visitor facilities. The larger eastern section, which accounts for the majority of the park's area, is almost entirely wilderness, and contains the deep canyons of the Middle and South Forks of the Kings River. Cedar Grove, located at the bottom of the Kings Canyon, is the only part of the park's vast eastern portion accessible by road (via Highway 180). Although most of the park is forested, much of the eastern section consists of alpine regions above the tree line. Usually snow free only from late June until late October, the high country is accessible solely via foot and horse trails. The Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness encompasses over in Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, or nearly 90 percent of their combined area. In addition to Sequoia National Park on the south, Kings Canyon is surrounded by multiple national forests and wilderness areas. The Sierra National Forest, Sequoia National Forest and Inyo National Forest border it on the northwest, west and east, respectively. The John Muir Wilderness wraps around much of the northern half of the park, and the Monarch Wilderness preserves much of the area between the park's two sections. =Mountains and valleys= Kings Canyon is characterized by some of the steepest vertical relief in North America, with numerous peaks over on the Sierra Crest along the park's eastern border, falling to in the valley floor of Cedar Grove just ten miles (16 km) to the west. The Sierran crest forms the eastern boundary of the park, from Mount Goethe in the north, down to Junction Peak, at the boundary with Sequoia National Park. Several passes cross the crest into the park, including Bishop Pass, Taboose Pass, Sawmill Pass, and Kearsarge Pass. All of these passes are above in elevation. Mount Agassiz is located on the Sierra Crest along the eastern edge of the park. There are several prominent subranges of the Sierra within and around the park. The Palisades, along the park's eastern boundary, have four peaks over including the highest point in the park, at the summit of North Palisade. The Great Western Divide extends through the south-central part of the park and also has many peaks over , including Mount Brewer. The Monarch Divide, stretching between the lower Middle and South Forks of the Kings, has some of the most inaccessible terrain in the entire park. In the northwest section of the park are other very steep and rugged ranges such as the Goddard Divide, LeConte Divide and Black Divide, all of which are dotted with high mountain lakes and separated by deep chasms. Most of the mountains and canyons, as in other parts of the Sierra Nevada, are formed in igneous intrusive rocks such as granite, diorite and monzonite, formed at least 100 million years ago due to subduction along the North American‚ÄìPacific Plate boundary. However, the Sierra itself is a young mountain range, no more than 10 million years old. Huge tectonic forces along the western edge of the Great Basin forced the local crustal block to tilt and uplift, creating the mountains' gradual slope to the west and the nearly vertical escarpment to the east bordering the Owens Valley. Many cave systems are also formed in the rock layers, including Boyden Cave along the South Fork of the Kings River. =Glacial features= The upper part of Kings Canyon, seen here at Zumwalt Meadow, was carved out by Ice Age glaciers. The present shape of the high country was largely sculpted by glaciations during successive Ice Ages over the last 2.5 million years. Large valley glaciers moved as far as down the South and Middle Forks of the Kings River, carving out the distinctive deep U-shaped valleys at Cedar Grove and Paradise Valley on the South Fork, and Tehipite Valley on the Middle Fork. Ice Age glaciations did not extend all the way to the confluence of the Middle and South Forks; consequently, the canyons downstream of Cedar Grove and Tehipite are typical V-shaped river gorges, in contrast to the U-shaped valleys upstream. The glacial valleys are characterized by flat floors and exposed granite cliffs and domes many thousands of feet high, similar in form to the more famous Yosemite Valley to the north, and in fact the term \\"yosemite\\" was used in the 19th century by John Muir to describe these valleys before they were widely known by their own names. In A Rival of the Yosemite, published in 1891 in The Century Illustrated Magazine, John Muir wrote of Kings Canyon: Dusy Basin includes many small lakes, such as this one, carved by glaciers from granite. Other significant glacial features include Tehipite Dome, the largest granite dome in the Sierra, rising above the floor of Tehipite Valley. In Kings Canyon and across the high country, such sheer granite cliffs are subject to exfoliation, frost weathering and earthquakes which cause sudden and dramatic rockfalls. Over thousands of years, cliff collapses have built up large talus piles or scree slopes at their bases along almost every glacial valley in the park. Zumwalt Meadow, one of the few large areas of flat land in the park, was formed by the accumulation of sediment behind the terminal moraine of a retreating glacier. In Kings Canyon there are in fact four such moraines, which the Kings River cascades over, forming whitewater rapids, in an area where it otherwise winds calmly across meadows. The series of moraines one behind the other are termed \\"nested moraines\\", each created during a different glacial period by glaciers of varying length. Elsewhere in the high country, the landscape of bare rock and talus left by former glaciers is replete with hanging valleys, waterfalls, serrated ridges (ar√™tes), cirques, and hundreds of alpine tarns. Some of the highest peaks retain permanent snowfields and even glaciers. Palisade Glacier, the largest in the Sierra, is located near the park's edge in the John Muir Wilderness. These glaciers are not holdovers from the Ice Ages; rather, they were most likely formed during cold periods in the last 1,000 years. The park's glaciers are now melting rapidly due to increased temperatures, and may disappear completely within a few decades. =Watersheds= A number of major Sierra rivers have their origins in the park. The South Fork Kings River flows from near Taboose Pass, on the park's eastern boundary, and drains much of the southern half of the park, carving the canyon from which the park takes its name. The Middle Fork Kings River originates near Mount Powell and drains most of the park's northern half. A smaller section in the northern tip of the park is drained by the South Fork of the San Joaquin River. The Kings River falls more than from the Sierra crest to Pine Flat Reservoir in the San Joaquin Valley ‚Äì the longest undammed drop of any North American river. Most of the park's borders are formed by watershed divides between river basins. The eastern boundary follows the Sierra Crest, which to the east is drained by the Owens River, part of the Great Basin watershed. The southern boundary with Sequoia National Park is the divide between the Kings, Kaweah and Kern Rivers. Part of the western boundary follows the divide between the Middle and North Forks of the Kings River. The forks of the Kings River converge in the Sequoia National Forest, a few miles outside the western boundary of the park, to form the main stem of the river. Here, the river forms one of the deepest canyons in North America, its walls rising as much as from river to rim ‚Äì about half a mile (0.8 km) deeper than the Grand Canyon. The canyons upstream at Cedar Grove are also more than deep. Although the geology and topography of Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley are similar to that of Yosemite Valley, the park does not have waterfalls as high and spectacular as those in Yosemite. There are several powerful but short waterfalls including Mist Falls, Roaring River Falls and Grizzly Falls in the Cedar Grove area. The backcountry is home to some much higher falls. Silver Spray Falls in Tehipite Valley drops about in several tiers. In a 1910 article in Out West, Ernestine Winchell describes the falls and Tehipite Valley: Both the Kings and San Joaquin Rivers flow west into the arid San Joaquin Valley; however, while the San Joaquin eventually empties into San Francisco Bay, the Kings ends in the terminal sink of Tulare Lake, which ‚Äì before its waters were diverted for irrigation ‚Äì was one of the largest freshwater lakes in the western United States. The seasonal rise and fall of the park's rivers is driven by heavy snowfall (typically between November and April) followed by a rapid melt during May and June. Runoff drops significantly by late July (or August in wet years), and rivers are usually a trickle by autumn. Snow accumulations in the higher areas of Kings Canyon National Park can be extremely large, often totaling in the hundreds of inches, although the annual snowpack fluctuates greatly between wet and dry years. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, most of Kings Canyon National Park has a Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) with only the lowest of elevations having a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Cedar Grove Visitor Center at 4613 ft (1406 m) elevation is 8a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of 12.3 ¬∞F (-10.9 ¬∞C). Plants and wildlife General Grant tree, located in the General Grant Grove of giant sequoias in Kings Canyon National Park Over 1,200 species of plants occur in Kings Canyon and Sequoia Parks, representing about 20 percent of all plant species in the state. In 1976, Kings Canyon was designated by UNESCO as part of the Sequoia-Kings Canyon Biosphere Reserve. Due to the large range in elevation, the park is characterized by several major plant communities. At lower elevations the park touches the fairly dry Sierra foothill zone which mostly consists of chaparral, brush and shrubs. Oaks, sycamores, willows and various hardwoods are often found along streams and springs at lower elevations. At middle elevations, most of the park consists of montane mixed-conifer forests: ponderosa pine, incense cedar, white fir, sugar pine and scattered groves of giant sequoias prevail in areas such as Cedar Grove and the mid-elevation slopes around Grant Grove. In Kings Canyon, which runs almost due east to west, there is a marked difference between the north wall ‚Äì which is hotter and drier due to receiving more sunlight ‚Äì and the more cool, shaded south wall which is more heavily forested. Further up, approaching the subalpine zone, red fir and lodgepole pine are found in increasing numbers; whitebark pine, mountain hemlock and foxtail pine dominate in areas approaching the tree line. A total of of old-growth forests are shared by Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. Although its sister park to the south, Sequoia, is better known for its giant sequoias, Kings Canyon also has large stands of sequoias ‚Äì including General Grant, the second largest tree on Earth, in the middle of General Grant Grove. The Redwood Mountain Grove, located a short distance further south, is the largest surviving sequoia grove in the world, covering more than ; it also has the tallest known sequoia, at . The Converse Basin Grove, located just outside the park boundary, is believed to have once been more than twice as large, but was almost completely clear-cut in the late 1800s. Many of the sequoia groves destroyed by logging, such as the Big Stump Grove, have begun to regenerate, a process that will take many hundreds of years. The forests provide habitat to many mammal species such as mule deer, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep, mountain lions and black bears, and a diversity of bird and reptile species. The Park Service is involved in restoring the population of bighorn sheep, which are considered endangered in the area; in 2014 several bighorns were released into the Sequoia-Kings Canyon area. Grizzly bears originally roamed the park as well, but were hunted to extinction by the early 1900s. The forks of the Kings River at these middle and lower elevations are also well known for their wild trout; the Kings is known as \\"one of the finest large trout fisheries in the state\\". An American black bear in Kings Canyon National Park In the high alpine country, plant communities are mostly meadows, herbs and shrubs with some scattered groves of foxtail pine and stunted whitebark pine. Trees often create krummholtz formations, or a stunted, deformed growth pattern characterized by branches closely hugging the ground. Talus slopes are home to small mammals such as pikas and yellow-bellied marmots. Birds such as gray- crowned rosy finches and American pipits, and sensitive amphibian species such as mountain yellow-legged frogs and Yosemite toads, feed on insects near alpine lakes and wetlands. Larger animals such as bears may venture into the alpine zone in search of food (a behavior now exacerbated by improper disposal of waste by campers), but do not winter there. =Human impacts and management= Although most of the park is now designated wilderness, human activities have significantly modified the ecology of the area ever since Native American times. In order to clear areas for hunting game and to encourage the germination of certain plants, Native Americans set controlled burns in areas of overgrown brush and grass. During the early 20th century, \\"\\"complete fire suppression\\" policy led to a great build-up of debris and tinder in the park's forests. By the 1960s it became apparent that this was interfering with the reproductive cycle of the park's sequoias, whose bark is fire resistant but require regular fires to clear away competing growth such as white firs. In 1963, scientists deliberately set fire to part of the Redwood Mountain Grove, the first fire in any of the park's sequoia groves for 75 years. Thousands of new sequoia seedlings germinated. The success of the experiment led to the establishment of the park's first long-term prescribed burn program in 1972. Meadow and forest habitat along the Copper Creek Trail, north side of Kings Canyon. A major source of damage to the park in the late 19th century and early 20th century was summer livestock grazing, particularly sheep, in areas such as Tehipite Valley and the Roaring River valley (although sheep never entered Cedar Grove, due to the difficulty of accessing the bottom of Kings Canyon before Highway 180 was constructed). Ranchers drove their herds up into the Sierra Nevada to escape the drought and heat of the San Joaquin Valley. Meadows were trampled by thousands of hooves, leading to increased erosion and watershed degradation. Grizzly bears and wolves which preyed on livestock were shot, trapped and poisoned in large numbers, extirpating them from the Sierra by the early 1900s. Although the Sierra Forest Reserve, including what would become Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks, was established in 1893, as many as half a million sheep were illegally grazed there. In 1917 the federal government began to crack down on illegal grazing and established a system of regulated management and range restoration, before sheep were banned from Kings Canyon altogether following the park's creation in 1940. Livestock grazing is still allowed in some national forest lands around the park. Occasionally hikers may come across gated drift fences in the wilderness designed to control livestock movement. Visitors must close all gates behind them to prevent livestock from wandering into protected areas. The decline of natural predators in the early 1900s led to a huge spike in the deer population, which further rose due to park visitors feeding them. Ultimately, this led to overgrazing and the vegetation understory was nearly eliminated in large areas of the park. When the park was expanded in 1940, the Park Service began shooting deer in an effort to reduce the size of the herd. Although the culling reduced deer numbers to a more ecologically stable level, the program was criticized for its reliance on brute force rather than more \\"hands-off\\" methods, such as re-introducing predators. Today, the only stock allowed in the park are pack horses and mules, which are only permitted in certain areas along major trails, and usually not early in the season in order to protect meadows in the spring while they are wet and soft. The park continues to host a healthy population of black bears, which are typically not aggressive towards humans, but have a tendency to steal human food. The Park Service has placed bear lockers in campgrounds, required the use of bear canisters and attempted to relocate bears away from heavily visited areas. This has been successful in the backcountry, where bears have largely ceased to associate backpackers with food, but remains an issue near developed campgrounds. Visitors are encouraged to store all food and scented items in lockers, and dispose of trash in bearproof garbage cans. However, rangers are still sometimes forced to kill \\"problem bears\\" who become habituated to human food. Human history =Native Americans= Kearsarge and Bullfrog Lakes seen from Kearsarge Pass. The pass was the main route for Paiute peoples traveling from the Owens Valley into Kings Canyon. People have inhabited what is now Kings Canyon National Park for about 6,000‚Äì7,000 years. The Owens Valley Paiute peoples (also known as the Eastern Monos) visited the region from their homeland east of the Sierra Nevada, around Mono Lake. The Paiute mainly used acorns, found in lower elevations of the park, for food, as well as deer and other small animals. They created trade routes connecting the Owens Valley with the Central Valley west of the Sierra Nevada. The Yokuts, who lived in the Central Valley, also ventured into the mountains during summer to collect plants, hunt game, and trade. Because of the inhospitable winter climate, they did not establish permanent villages in the high country. Prior to European contact the Yokut population numbered between 15,000‚Äì20,000, and the Monos about 6,000. Around the 1500s AD, some of the Eastern Mono migrated across the Sierra Nevada into the Central Valley, where they created settlements adjoining Yokuts territory in the Sierra foothills near the Kings River. This group became known as the Monaches, or Western Mono. They eventually divided into as many as six distinct bands, of which one, the Wobonuch, lived in the area near Grant Grove. The native population suffered greatly after Europeans arrived in the 19th century (a smallpox epidemic killed off most of the Monache in 1862), and very few remain in the area today. =Early exploration and logging= The early Spanish exploration of California largely bypassed what is now Kings Canyon National Park. In 1805 Gabriel Moraga led an expedition through the Central Valley and crossed what is now the Kings River, bestowing the name Rio de los Santo Reyes (River of the Holy Kings) on the stream. Fur trappers also visited the areas in the 1820s, but most likely did not venture into the high country since beaver were only present at lower elevations. They were followed by prospectors during the California Gold Rush, which began in 1848. However, not much gold, nor other minerals, were discovered in this area. Hale Tharp, a disillusioned gold miner, is credited with the 1858 discovery of Giant Forest in Sequoia National Park, which led to the further exploration and discovery of the other sequoia forests in the area, including Grant Grove. Gamlin Cabin, built by loggers in 1872, is the oldest surviving structure in Kings Canyon National Park. During the 1860s, a road was built to Grant Grove and many of the sequoias there were logged. The first of several sawmills opened in 1862, and logging operations expanded north and almost entirely leveled Converse Basin, then one of the largest sequoia groves in the world (although the Boole tree, the grove's biggest, was spared). The General Grant tree was discovered by Joseph H. Thomas, a sawmill operator, in 1862. Thomas' business partners, the Gamlin brothers, held a claim to the land surrounding Grant Grove, and their dwelling (built around 1872) has been preserved as a historic site. During the 1870s a government survey \\"disclosed the remarkable quality of General Grant Grove, and Israel Gamlin was persuaded to give up his claim so the area could be preserved.\\" However, this did not entirely stop logging in the area ‚Äì in 1875 a sequoia was chopped down and a section sent to the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. Reportedly, \\"eastern people refused to accept the exhibit as part of a single tree and called it the 'California Hoax'.\\" The Centennial Stump, and most of the tree, remain as prominent features in Grant Grove: \\"Ladies from a nearby logging camp used to conduct Sunday school services for their children upon the stump.\\" =Wilderness surveys= North Palisade from Windy Point, photographed by Ansel Adams, ca. 1936. The first non-native people to venture into what is today considered the Kings Canyon backcountry or high country were likely John C. Fremont's party in 1844, which attempted to cross the Sierra Nevada by way of the Kings River. However, a snowstorm impeded their progress and they were forced to retreat to the Central Valley. In 1858, the J.H. Johnson party successfully crossed the Sierra via the route Fremont had intended to find, via Kearsarge Pass at the far eastern end of Kings Canyon. The first scientific expedition to the area was the 1864 Whitney Survey, conducted by the Geological Survey of California led by William Brewer. After failed attempts to summit Mount Whitney, the Brewer party descended into the Kings Canyon via Native American paths where \\"they remarked its resemblance to the Yosemite and were impressed by the enormous height of its cliffs.\\" Although the rugged terrain made travel difficult, they discovered a route up the north wall of the canyon and named several prominent features, including Mount King, Mount Gardner, the Palisades, and Mount Brewer. From the summit of the peak that would bear his name, Brewer described the view: Brewer's party left Kings Canyon via Kearsarge Pass where they encountered a group of prospectors led by Thomas Keough. Although details on the Keough expedition are scarce, the miners had been prospecting on the North Fork of the Kings River and were returning to their homes in the Owens Valley, indicating that they must have crossed the Middle Fork ‚Äì then considered a region impossible to access by white settlers ‚Äì making them the first non-natives to do so. Around 1869, sheepherder Frank Dusy discovered and named the Middle Fork's Tehipite Valley, and later grazed his sheep there. Aside from such occasional uses, most of the high country remained little visited and mostly unexplored. =Park creation= It was not until John Muir first visited in 1873 that Kings Canyon began receiving public attention. Muir was delighted at the canyon's similarity to Yosemite Valley, as it reinforced his theory that the valleys were carved by massive glaciers during the last Ice Age. This competed with Josiah Whitney's then-accepted theory that the mountain valleys were formed by earthquakes. Muir's writings on the geology of the park and the magnificence of its sequoia groves led to calls for preservation of the area, and Muir himself continued to lobby for the cause. In 1880 logging claims in the Grant Grove area were suspended by the federal government, in large part due to the political efforts of Colonel George W. Stewart. In March 1890 a bill (H.R. 8350) was introduced to Congress by Representative William Vandever proposing the creation of Yosemite National Park. Subsequently, some \\"political intrigue\\" led to its substitution with H.R. 12187, which also included provisions for a General Grant National Park and the expansion of Sequoia National Park. The origins of this bill remain largely a mystery, although local politicians with an interest in preserving the park were likely involved. Daniel K. Zumwalt, an agent for the Southern Pacific Railroad ‚Äì which owned many lumber interests in California ‚Äì may have seen the park as a way to force their competitors in the Sequoia-Kings Canyon area out of business. On October 1, 1890 President Benjamin Harrison signed the bill into law, establishing General Grant National Park ‚Äì the United States' fourth national park ‚Äì which today is part of the smaller western section of Kings Canyon National Park. For many years the primary way for tourists to reach General Grant National Park was the Stephens Grade, a rough wagon road over which a stagecoach operated from Visalia beginning in the early 1900s. Initially, the U.S. Army had to station troops to protect the park from illegal grazing and hunting. Although these eventually ceased to be a problem, the rising number of visitors created its own sanitation and waste issues. In the summer of 1907 about 1,100 people visited the park. A new road reached the General Grant National Park by 1913; that summer, the park saw almost 2,800 tourists. In 1914 the park was turned over from military to civilian control (though the National Park Service was not formally established until 1916). =Park expansion and dam controversy= The future of the park's much larger eastern section remained in doubt for almost fifty years. The backcountry was largely inaccessible and unknown to tourists, requiring several days' journey on horseback through some very rugged terrain. Instead, the area was targeted by water supply and power interests including the city of Los Angeles, who wanted to build hydroelectric dams in Kings Canyon. Due to its heavy flow and long drop ‚Äì in less than ‚Äì the Kings River has considerable hydroelectric potential, and reservoirs were proposed for Cedar Grove, Tehipite Valley and Simpson Meadow, among other sites. Development interests blocked legislation that would have made the area a national park, but at the same time, the environmental lobby prevented any of these projects from being built. Middle Fork at Kings River from South Fork of Cartridge Creek, Kings River Canyon, photographed by Ansel Adams, 1936 In 1935 the Generals Highway was completed connecting Sequoia and General Grant National Parks. In 1939 State Route 180 from Grant Grove to Kings Canyon was finally completed after ten years of construction, finally allowing large numbers of tourists to visit Cedar Grove for the first time. The road was built in part using state prison labor. However, a proposal to extend the state highway over Kearsarge Pass to the Owens Valley was defeated. Well-graded hiking trails were also extended into the backcountry to replace the rough pack trails used by sheepherders ‚Äì including the John Muir Trail, completed in 1933 through what is now the eastern edge of Kings Canyon National Park. For many years a tiny ranger station and a few private structures (such as Knapp Cabin) had been the only development in Cedar Grove. Starting in 1937, large campgrounds were developed in Kings Canyon by the U.S. Forest Service, but construction of more permanent facilities was foregone since the area would lie at the bottom of one of the proposed reservoirs. Ultimately, local opposition to Los Angeles' attempts to secure the Kings River turned into significant political pressure to create a national park, which would prevent any dam projects there. United States Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes was a major proponent for the expansion of the park, and worked to unite local interests, who had widely different views on how much development should be allowed. Ickes also hired Ansel Adams to photograph and document the area, generating publicity for the preservation movement. However, in order to placate the local irrigation districts ‚Äì who wanted to leave open the option of reservoirs ‚Äì Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley were specifically excluded from the new park. On March 4, 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the bill to create Kings Canyon National Park, which added the original General Grant National Park to over of the High Sierra above Cedar Grove. =Later history and additions= The new Kings Canyon administration initially struggled to manage the huge park, which was more than 700 times the size of the original unit at Grant Grove. In the early years staff and expertise were often loaned from Sequoia National Park. In 1943 the administrations of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks were combined, as a cost-saving measure due to World War II. After the war, the arrangement was preserved; today, the two parks are still managed as one. Postwar, visitation jumped enormously, from just over 82,000 in 1945 to 450,000 in 1951. Demand increased for tourist facilities at Cedar Grove, the terminus of the state highway ‚Äì although the valley was not officially part of the park, having been omitted due to water-development interests. The extension of the road through the valley was controversial, due to potential ecological damage. By 1947 the Park Service had drafted a general plan including tourist lodges, concessions and a pack station. A view of the Kings River at Zumwalt Meadow in 1940, the same year most of Kings Canyon became a national park. This area would have been flooded by the proposed Cedar Grove Dam. Then in 1948, Los Angeles unexpectedly re-filed its application to construct dams in Kings Canyon. The Kings River Conservation District (KRCD), representing local water agencies, immediately filed claims on the same sites. KRCD had no intention of constructing dams but hoped to block the possible threat to its water supply. Although the Federal Power Commission rejected Los Angeles' application, as it had prior to 1940, the city repeatedly refiled until 1963 when it was denied by both the California State Water Board and the federal government. One factor in the project's final failure was that even though the Cedar Grove dam site was outside the park, the project required two additional dams to be built upstream if it were to be economically feasible. However, those sites were now inside the park boundary as designated in 1940. On August 6, 1965 Cedar Grove and Tehipite Valley were finally added to the park, making them permanently off-limits to new dams as well. These annexations (with the exception of a tiny section in 1984, south of Grant Grove) brought Kings Canyon National Park to its present size. Starting in the 1950s, in response to growing traffic and crowding at national parks, the Park Service implemented Mission 66 which proposed large new visitor developments for Kings Canyon and other parks. This included new visitor centers at Grant Grove and Cedar Grove, electrification and sewage facilities at Cedar Grove, and substantial new accommodations, trails, and parking areas. After the Cedar Grove development was delayed by the final years of the dam debacle, the Park Service released a new plan in 1972, which included cabins for 260 people, and an store and cafeteria complex, hoping to develop the area in a way similar to Yosemite Valley. In 1974 the park saw 1,216,800 visitors, a number that has not been exceeded since. However, by 1975 public hearings showed such an opposition to intense development, that ultimately only a small lodge and store were added to the canyon. The rising number of visitors to the backcountry ‚Äì from 8,000 in 1962 to over 44,000 in 1971 ‚Äì created its own problems in the form of litter, illegal campfires and contact with dangerous wildlife such as bears. In 1966 and 1971 the Park Service proposed, controversially, to designate most of the park as wilderness, which would place much greater restrictions on its use. In 1973 the number of backpackers was first restricted via a quota system. Finally, on September 28, 1984, Congress designated over 85 percent of Kings Canyon and Sequoia National Parks as wilderness. In 1987, the Middle and South Forks of the Kings River were designated Wild and Scenic. Recreation Grant Grove, the only vehicular entrance to the park, is east of Fresno via Highway 180. In addition to Highway 180 from the west, Highway 198, the Generals Highway, provides access from Sequoia National Park in the south. The roads converge in Grant Grove Village, from where Highway 180 continues another northeast to Cedar Grove. There is no vehicular access from Highway 395 on the eastern side of the park. There is currently no public transportation to Kings Canyon National Park; the Big Trees Shuttle, which originally operated between Sequoia National Park and Grant Grove, is no longer in service. A forested area of Kings Canyon National Park near Grant Grove, the original park established in 1890. The National Park Service maintains visitor centers at Grant Grove and Cedar Grove. Grant Grove Village is the most developed part of the park and includes the 36-room John Muir Lodge (the park's largest hotel), visitor cabins, a restaurant and a general store. Cedar Grove also has a small market, but overall the facilities there are much more limited. Barring extreme weather, the Grant Grove section is open year-round; Cedar Grove is closed in winter. Highway 180 is plowed only as far as Princess Meadow, the junction with the Hume Lake Road, which remains open to Hume Lake in winter. Due to its limited road access, Kings Canyon receives much fewer visitors than its neighboring national parks, Sequoia and Yosemite. The overall decline in national park visitation in the late 1990s hit Kings Canyon considerably harder than the other parks; from 1970 to 1990 it averaged almost a million visitors per year, but in the 21st century, it has averaged just 560,000. In 2016, it saw an increase to 607,479 visitors, which (with the exception of 2009) was the highest count since 1995. Since records began in 1904, an approximate total of 53 million people have visited Kings Canyon. =Campgrounds and hiking= In Grant Grove, the three major campgrounds are Azalea, Crystal Springs and Sunset, with 319 sites in total. With the exception of Sunset, they operate on a first-come, first- served basis. Cedar Grove has 314 sites in the Sentinel, Sheep Creek and Moraine Campgrounds, which are also first-come, first-served; sites at the Canyon View group camp must be reserved. During high demand periods, additional campsites may be placed on a reservation system. All campgrounds have flush toilets and showers, although water use may be restricted depending on the season. Roaring River Falls, high, is easily accessed via a short hike in Cedar Grove. There are a number of day hikes in the parts of Kings Canyon National Park accessible by road. In the Grant Grove area a one-mile (1.6 km) trail leads to the General Grant Tree, and several longer trails reach nearby points of interest such as Redwood Mountain, the largest sequoia grove. In Cedar Grove, easy hikes include the boardwalk path through Zumwalt Meadow ‚Äì providing broad views of Kings Canyon ‚Äì and the short walk to Roaring River Falls; there are also many longer day hikes such as an round trip to Mist Falls, and the round trip climb to Lookout Peak above Kings Canyon. A number of historical sites in the park are easily accessible via short walks, including Gamlin Cabin, built circa 1872 by the Gamlin brothers who had a timber claim at Grant Grove before it became a national park. it is believed to be the first permanent structure built in the park area. Knapp Cabin, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, is the oldest surviving structure in Cedar Grove, dating back to 1925. Another point of interest is the extensive Boyden Cavern system whose entrance is located just outside the park's western boundary, in the Monarch Wilderness. As of 2016, the cave was closed due to damage from the Rough Fire. =Backcountry travel= Since most of Kings Canyon is wilderness and roads extend only a small distance into the park, backpacking (and less commonly, horsepacking) are the only way to see the majority of the park. Unlike day hikers, overnight backpackers must obtain a wilderness permit from a ranger station or visitor center. During the peak tourist season (typically between May and September), a quota applies for wilderness permits, of which 75 percent are set aside for prior reservations, with the remainder for walk-ins. Outside the quota period permits are still required, although the limit no longer applies. Although backpackers account for a relatively small percentage of the total visitors, some of the backcountry trails are still quite heavily used. Due to the popularity of some backcountry camps, stays can be limited to one or two nights. During the summer, the Park Service staffs backcountry ranger stations at McClure Meadow, Le Conte Meadow, Rae Lakes, Charlotte Lake and Roaring River. Rae Lakes (Middle Rae Lake shown) is one of several backpacking destinations in the park. Road's End at Cedar Grove is a major jumping-off point for trips into the backcountry. The Rae Lakes Loop, , is one of the most popular backpacking trips and passes through the deep canyons of Paradise Valley, the high Woods Creek suspension bridge and exposed alpine country before reaching Rae Lakes, a chain of glacial tarns set below peaks. Rae Lakes Loop hikers also climb over Glen Pass reaching a peak elevation of just under 12,000 feet. From the top of the pass, hikers can see views of Rae Lakes and the surrounding basin. The combined Pacific Crest Trail/John Muir Trail forms the backbone of the trail system, winding about The total distance through the park is 77.3 miles. Piute Pass at the northern border is at mile 109.8, and Forester Pass at the southern border is at mile 187.1. from Piute Canyon at the park's northern tip to Forester Pass, , in the south. Many hikes in Kings Canyon, including Rae Lakes, include parts of the PCT/JMT. There are also trailheads at Grant Grove which lead to more moderate hikes in the lower western Sierra Nevada, many in the Jennie Lakes Wilderness (just outside the national park). Many parts of the park, such as the Middle Fork of the Kings River, are more difficult to access, requiring multi-day hikes over difficult terrain. Simpson Meadow on the Middle Fork is a , one-way hike from Cedar Grove, with well over of elevation change. Other trailheads outside the park provide access to some of its more isolated locations, such as Tehipite Valley, a one-way hike from the Wishon Dam trailhead in the Sierra National Forest. The exposed and unmaintained descent into the valley is \\"notorious\\" as one of the park's most difficult hikes. Several trails also access the park from the Owens Valley to the east; all surmount passes more than high. The closest and most heavily used eastern approach is via Onion Valley Road, which terminates about a mile (1.6 km) east of the park boundary in the Inyo National Forest. The Kearsarge Pass Trail begins at Onion Valley Campground and links to the PCT/JMT via the eponymous pass. During the spring and early summer, river crossings can be hazardous; in response the Park Service has installed bridges along some of the major trails. By late August or September of most years, rivers will have dropped to relatively safe levels. The high country is typically snow free between May and November, although in particularly wet years, large areas of snow may persist into July. In winter, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing are common activities. The Park Service provides ranger-led snowshoe walks and maintains some groomed trails in the Grant Grove area. Longer trips into the backcountry are also possible, although due to the rough terrain, typically deep snows and lack of ranger patrols during the winter, this is recommended only for skilled winter travelers. As with backpacking, wilderness permits are required for any overnight trips in winter. =Climbing and canyoneering= grade II‚ÄìVI. The large, exposed granite cliffs and domes in Kings Canyon provide opportunities for rock climbing. However, many such features require long or circuitous hikes to reach their bases, which deters many climbers. These include The Obelisk, overlooking Kings Canyon at the park's western boundary, multipitch climbs at Charlito Dome and Charlotte Dome well up the Bubbs Creek Trail, and Tehipite Dome, which requires a nearly roundtrip hike just to access. Many of the park's prominent peaks also require technical climbing ‚Äì including North Palisade, the highest point in the park, and some of its neighbors along the Sierra crest. In The High Sierra: Peaks, Passes, Trails (2009) North Palisade is described as \\"the classic peak of the High Sierra ... It is striking from a distance and has routes that will challenge climbers of all abilities and preferences.\\" Canyoneering, bouldering, bushwhacking and rappelling are often necessary to explore parts of the backcountry without developed trails. A notably challenging route is down Enchanted Gorge in the Middle Fork backcountry, where Disappearing Creek vanishes under huge talus piles only to re-emerge several miles downstream, hence the name. Nearby Goddard Canyon is an easier ‚Äì albeit still rugged ‚Äì route, and is known for its scenic meadows and many waterfalls. The Gorge of Despair above Tehipite Valley is known for its combination of cliffs, waterfalls and deep pools, whose descent requires rappelling gear and wetsuits to achieve. Because of the park's size, lack of cell reception and limited personnel for search and rescue operations, only experienced cross-country travelers should attempt to hike off trail. =Water sports= In Cedar Grove, about of the South Fork are considered good waters for fly fishing. Although the river was once stocked with trout, the Park Service has not stocked the river since the 1970s, in favor of letting the fishery return to natural conditions. While rainbow, brown, and brook trout are found in various stretches of the river, only rainbows are native to the Sierra Nevada, the others having been planted by sportsmen in the early 20th century. The river is generally low and warm enough for wading by early autumn. In order to preserve the natural fishery, only catch and release is allowed for rainbows. A California state fishing license is required for visitors 16 years or older. The rainbow trout in the Kings river are small, usually no more than . This section of the South Fork in Cedar Grove is closed to boating; however, swimming and fishing are permitted. In order to protect riparian habitat, the gently flowing South Fork is closed to boating in Cedar Grove between Bubbs Creek and the western boundary of the park. However, swimming is allowed in certain sections of the river, with Muir Rock and the Red Bridge being popular swimming holes. Although there are many alpine lakes in the park at high elevations, most are impractical to access for boating or swimming. Nearby Hume Lake, formed by a historic mill-pond dam, is located in the Sequoia National Forest between the two sections of the park and is used for boating, swimming and fishing. Most of the park's other rivers are extremely steep and fast-flowing, and are suitable only for advanced kayaking. The Kings River above Pine Flat Reservoir is a commercial whitewater run with its put-in near the western boundary of the park, but most of the run itself is on national forest. Most rivers in the park itself are inaccessible by road. The Middle Fork is one of the most difficult-to-access whitewater runs in the entire state, since boats and equipment must be carried through miles of backcountry to reach it. Canoe Kayak magazine describes the Middle Fork run, which passes through some of the most isolated parts of the Sierra, as \\"the very definition of epic with paddlers traveling around the world just to make a once-in-a- lifetime descent\\". Kayakers take about five days to descend the Class V Middle Fork from its headwaters to at Pine Flat Reservoir.

It primarily serves as the home venue of the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). It is part of the Truman Sports Complex with adjacent Kauffman Stadium, the home of the Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball (MLB). Arrowhead Stadium has a seating capacity of 76,416, making it the 27th largest stadium in the United States and the sixth largest NFL stadium. It is also the largest sports facility by capacity in the state of Missouri. A $375 million renovation was completed in 2010. History When the Dallas Texans of the American Football League (AFL) relocated to Kansas City in 1963 and were renamed the Kansas City Chiefs, they played home games at Municipal Stadium, which they shared with the Kansas City Athletics of Major League Baseball. The A's left for Oakland after the 1967 season and were replaced by the expansion Kansas City Royals in 1969. Municipal Stadium, built in 1923 and mostly rebuilt in 1955, seated approximately 35,000 for football. As part of the AFL‚ÄìNFL merger announced in 1966, NFL stadiums would be required to seat no fewer than 50,000 people. The City of Kansas City was unable to find a suitable location for a new stadium, so Jackson County stepped in and offered a location on the eastern edge of Kansas City near the interchange of Interstate 70 and Interstate 435. Voters approved a $102 million bond issue in 1967 to build a new sports complex with two stadiums. The original design called for construction of side-by-side baseball and football stadiums with a common roof that would roll between them. The design proved to be more complicated and expensive than originally thought and so was scrapped in favor of the current open-air configuration. The two-stadium complex concept was the first of its kind. The Chiefs staff, led by team general manager Jack Steadman, helped develop the complex. =Construction= Construction began in 1968. The original two-stadium concept was initially designed by Denver architect Charles Deaton and Steadman. Deaton's design was implemented by the Kansas City architectural firm of Kivett & Myers. Arrowhead is considered by some to have had an influence on the design of several future NFL stadiums. Construction of the stadium was a joint venture Sharp-Kidde-Webb construction firms. =1970s= Arrowhead Stadium at night, prior to the game vs the Green Bay Packers. Construction on Arrowhead Stadium was completed in time for the 1972 season. On August 12, 1972, the Chiefs defeated the St. Louis Cardinals 24‚Äì14 in the first preseason game at Arrowhead Stadium. Later on during the 1972 regular season, the largest crowd to see a game in Arrowhead Stadium was 82,094 in a Chiefs game against the Oakland Raiders on November 5 (Kansas City won 27-14 for its first regular season victory in the stadium). In 1973, the stadium was the first in the NFL to include arrows on the yard markers to indicate the nearer goal line (initially, they resembled little Indian arrowheads). This practice would eventually spread to the other NFL stadiums as the 1970s progressed, finally becoming mandatory league-wide in the 1978 season (after being used in Super Bowl XII), and become almost near-universal at the lower levels of football.Pat Bickle Benefit Game - Raytown High School vs Center High School At Arrowhead Stadium 11-24-1973 - YouTube On January 20, 1974, Arrowhead Stadium hosted the Pro Bowl. Due to an ice storm and brutally cold temperatures the week leading up to the game, the game's participants worked out at the facilities of the San Diego Chargers. On game day, the temperature soared to , melting most of the ice and snow that accumulated during the week. The AFC defeated the NFC, 15‚Äì13. =1980s‚Äìpresent= Arrowhead as seen on ground level. In 1984, the Jackson County Sports Authority re-evaluated the concept of a fabric dome. The concept was disregarded as being unnecessary and financially impractical. Arrowhead hosted the Drum Corps International World Championships in 1988 and 1989. In 1991, two Diamond Vision screens shaped as footballs were installed. In 1994, other improvements were made and natural grass playing surface was installed, replacing the original artificial Astroturf playing field. In 2009, Arrowhead Stadium completed the installation of a multimillion-dollar integrated system from Daktronics out of Brookings, South Dakota. Two high definition video displays were retrofitted into the existing football-shaped displays in both end zones. Approximately of digital ribbon board technology was also installed in the stadium. Noise record Since September 2014, Chiefs fans have been recognized by Guinness World Records as the loudest fan base in the world among outdoor stadiums. In 1990 in a game against the Denver Broncos, the Chiefs were threatened with a penalty if the crowd would not quiet down. After John Elway was backed up to his own goal line and unable to even run a play he quickly spoke to the referee. After listening to Elway the referee said \\"Any further crowd-noise problem will result in a charged timeout against Kansas City. Thank you for your cooperation.\\" On October 13, 2013, in a game between the Chiefs and Oakland Raiders, the crowd at the stadium set a Guinness World Record for the loudest stadium, with 137.5 dB. That record would be broken by Seattle Seahawks fans at CenturyLink Field on December 2, 2013, at a home game against the New Orleans Saints. Seattle gained the record by reaching a noise level of 137.6 decibels. The Chiefs reclaimed the title on September 29, 2014 in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. On September 20, 2015, the Buffalo Bills attempted to break the noise record in a home game against division rival New England Patriots, but fell short of the mark. It was not released what the decibel reading was. Allen Fieldhouse, which is only 42 miles away, owns the record for loudest indoor arena. College football Arrowhead Stadium has hosted five Big 12 Conference football championship games: Kansas State versus Oklahoma in 2000 and 2003, Colorado versus Oklahoma in 2004, Nebraska versus Oklahoma on December 2, 2006, and Missouri versus Oklahoma in 2008. From 2007 to 2011, Arrowhead hosted the Border Showdown between the Kansas Jayhawks and the Missouri Tigers. The 2007 game between the #2 Jayhawks and #3 Tigers, drew the second largest crowd in stadium history, at 80,537, with the Tigers winning 36-28. Kansas also played Oklahoma at Arrowhead in 2005. Missouri played Arkansas State in 2005, BYU in 2015, and was scheduled to play Arkansas in 2020. In 2009 and 2010, Arrowhead hosted football games between the Iowa State Cyclones and the Kansas State Wildcats. Iowa State previously played at Arrowhead against the Florida State Seminoles in the 2002 Eddie Robinson Classic. In 1998, Oklahoma State moved its scheduled home game vs. Nebraska to Arrowhead. The stadium also played host to the annual Fall Classic at Arrowhead, a Division II game that featured Northwest Missouri State University and Pittsburg State University. The 2004 game featured No. 1 Pittsburg State defeating No. 2 Northwest Missouri State in the only Division II game to feature the nation's top two teams playing in the regular season finale. Soccer With the formation of Major League Soccer in 1996, Arrowhead became home to the Kansas City Wiz. After the 1996 season, the team was renamed the Wizards. They left after the 2007 season, after being sold by the Hunt Family to On Goal, LLC, once their lease ended. This was also beneficial so that construction work on Arrowhead's renovation could take place during the NFL off-season. The Wizards moved to CommunityAmerica Ballpark in 2008 and did not return to Arrowhead except for one friendly. That friendly was played on July 25, 2010, the Kansas City Wizards faced Manchester United at Arrowhead Stadium for the English team's third preseason friendly in America during 2011. Due to ticket demand, they could not play the game at their new home stadium, CommunityAmerica Ballpark. The match ended with Kansas City beating the Manchester Club 2-1 with Dimitar Berbatov scoring the only goal for Manchester United on a penalty kick. The stadium has hosted one US Men's National Team match and three Women's National Team matches. Arrowhead is one of the 16 candidate venues for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted jointly by the United States, Canada and Mexico. Renovations One of the entrances to the stadium. Rear view of the stadium On April 4, 2006, Jackson County voters approved a tax increase to finance municipal bonds to pay for $850 million in renovations to Arrowhead and nearby Kauffman Stadium. Before the bond election, the NFL awarded the 49th Super Bowl in 2015 to Kansas City provided it would have a climate-controlled stadium. With the passing of the stadium bill, the Chiefs signed a new lease which ensures that the team will remain at Arrowhead until at least 2031. However, a second bond issue to build the rolling roof shared with Kauffman Stadium that was part of the original 1967 stadium plan was defeated by voters, and Kansas City chose to withdraw its request to host Super Bowl XLIX in 2015; the game was played at the University of Phoenix Stadium (now State Farm Stadium) in Glendale, Arizona.No rolling roof, no Super Bowl at Arrowhead Associated Press. May 25, 2006. On August 15, 2007, the Chiefs announced final plans for the renovated Arrowhead Stadium, which would cost $375 million. The cost to the city was reduced by $50 million thanks to an additional payment by the Hunt family, which originally had intended to donate $75 million. The renovated stadium features the Chiefs Hall of Honor, a tribute to Lamar Hunt, and \\"horizon level\\" seating in which luxury suite owners sit outdoors.Chiefs unveil the new Arrowhead KCChiefs.com. August 25, 2007. Reconstruction for the stadiums started on October 3, 2007. Refurbishment of nearby Kauffman Stadium, home to the Kansas City Royals baseball team, commenced at that time, and both completely-refurbished stadiums were ready for play by the 2010 season. In 2019, the Chiefs announced multiple renovations for the 2020 season, which included replaced seats in the lower level, a new video display on the East end, and locker room upgrades. The lower red seats were replaced to match the upper red seats. The gold seats were not replaced. Plans to upgrade the locker room were put on hold due to COVID 19. Instead, plexiglass dividers were placed between each locker and the original KC logo (in which the C overlays the K) was refurbished during extensive cleaning. Stadium music From 1963 to 2008, the TD Pack Band was a mainstay at every Chiefs home game. The band was founded by trumpeter Tony DiPardo. The band was previously known as The Zing Band while the Chiefs played at Municipal Stadium. DiPardo, nicknamed \\"Mr. Music\\", was born in St. Louis, Missouri on August 15, 1912. DiPardo has written songs about the team such as \\"The Chiefs are on the Warpath\\" and \\"The Hank Stram Polka\\". DiPardo earned a Super Bowl ring for the Chiefs' victory in Super Bowl IV.

Metafiction is self-conscious about language, literary form, and story-telling, and works of metafiction directly or indirectly draw attention to their status as artifacts. Metafiction is frequently used as a form of parody or a tool to undermine literary conventions and explore the relationship between literature and reality, life, and art. Although metafiction is most commonly associated with postmodern literature that developed in the mid-20th Century, its use can be traced back to much earlier works of fiction, such as Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (1387), Miguel de Cervantes's Don Quixote (1605), Laurence Sterne's The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman (1759), William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair (1847), as well as more recent works such as Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1979) and Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves (2000). Metafiction, however, became particularly prominent in the 1960s, with authors and works such as John Barth's Lost in the Funhouse, Robert Coover's \\"The Babysitter\\" and \\"The Magic Poker\\", Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five,Jensen, Mikkel (2016) \\"Janus-Headed Postmodernism: The Opening Lines of Slaughterhouse-Five\\" in The Explicator, 74:1, 8-11. John Fowles' The French Lieutenant's Woman, Thomas Pynchon's The Crying of Lot 49 and William H. Gass's Willie Master's Lonesome Wife. Since the 1980s, contemporary Latino literature has an abundance of self-reflexive, metafictional works, including novels and short stories by Junot D√≠az (The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao), Giannina Braschi (Empire of Dreams, Yo-Yo Boing!), Sandra Cisneros (Caramelo), Salvador Plascencia (The People of Paper), Carmen Maria Machado (Her Body), Rita Indiana (Tentacle), and Valeria Luiselli (Lost Children Archive).  History of the term  The term 'metafiction' was coined in 1970 by William H. Gass in his book Fiction and the Figures of Life. Gass describes the increasing use of metafiction at the time as a result of authors developing a better understanding of the medium. This new understanding of the medium led to a major change in the approach toward fiction. Theoretical issues became more prominent aspects, resulting in an increased self-reflexivity and formal uncertainty. Robert Scholes expands upon Gass' theory and identifies four forms of criticism on fiction, which he refers to as formal, behavioural, structural, and philosophical criticism. Metafiction assimilates these perspectives into the fictional process, putting emphasis on one or more of these aspects. These developments were part of a larger movement (arguably a 'metareferential turn') which, approximately from the 1960s onwards, was the consequence of an increasing social and cultural self-consciousness, stemming from, as Patricia Waugh puts it, \\"a more general cultural interest in the problem of how human beings reflect, construct and mediate their experience in the world.\\" Due to this development, an increasing number of novelists rejected the notion of rendering the world through fiction. The new principle became to create through the medium of language a world that does not reflect the real world. Language was considered an \\"independent, self-contained system which generates its own 'meanings.'\\" and a means of mediating knowledge of the world. Thus, literary fiction, which constructs worlds through language, became a model for the construction of 'reality' rather than a reflection of it. Reality itself became regarded as a construct instead of an objective truth. Through its formal self-exploration, metafiction thus became the device that explores the question of how human beings construct their experience of the world. Robert Scholes identifies the time around 1970 as the peak of experimental fiction (which metafiction is an instrumental part of) and names a lack of commercial and critical success as reasons for its subsequent decline. The development toward metafictional writing in postmodernism generated mixed responses. Some critics argued that it signified the decadence of the novel and an exhaustion of the artistic capabilities of the medium, with some going as far as to call it the 'death of the novel'. Others see the self-consciousness of fictional writing as a way to gain deeper understanding of the medium and a path that leads to innovation that resulted in the emergence of new forms of literature, such as the historiographic novel by Linda Hutcheon.  Forms  According to Werner Wolf, metafiction can be differentiated into four pairs of forms that can be combined with each other.Wolf, Werner (2009). \\"Metareference across Media: The Concept, its Transmedial Potentials and Problems, Main Forms and Functions\\". Metareference across Media: Theory and Case Studies. Studies in Intermediality 4, eds. Werner Wolf, Katharina Bantleon, and Jeff Thoss. Amsterdam: Rodopi. pp. 37-38. = Explicit/implicit metafiction = Explicit metafiction is identifiable through its use of clear metafictional elements on the surface of a text. It comments on its own artificiality and is quotable. Explicit metafiction is described as a mode of telling. An example would be a narrator explaining the process of creating the story they are telling. Rather than commenting on the text, implicit metafiction foregrounds the medium or its status as an artefact through various, for example disruptive, techniques such as metalepsis. It relies more than other forms of metafiction on the reader's ability to recognize these devices in order to evoke a metafictional reading. Implicit metafiction is described as a mode of showing. = Direct/indirect metafiction = Direct metafiction establishes a reference within the text one is just reading. In contrast to this, indirect metafiction consists in metareferences external to this text, such as reflections on other specific literary works or genres (as in parodies) and general discussions of aesthetic issue. Since there is always a relationship between the text in which indirect metafiction occurs and the referenced external texts or issues, indirect metafiction always impacts the text one is reading, albeit in an indirect way. = Critical/non-critical metafiction = Critical metafiction aims to find the artificiality or fictionality of a text in some critical way, which is frequently done in postmodernist fiction. Non-critical metafiction does not criticize or undermine the artificiality or fictionality of a text and can, for example, be used to \\"suggest that the story one is reading is authentic\\".Wolf, Werner (2009). \\"Metareference across Media: The Concept, its Transmedial Potentials and Problems, Main Forms and Functions\\". Metareference across Media: Theory and Case Studies. Studies in Intermediality 4, eds. Werner Wolf, Katharina Bantleon, and Jeff Thoss. Amsterdam: Rodopi. p. 43. = Generally media-centred/truth- or fiction-centred metafiction = While all metafiction somehow deals with the medial quality of fiction or narrative and is thus generally media-centred, in some cases there is an additional focus on the truthfulness or inventedness (fictionality) of a text, which merits mention as a specific form. The suggestion of a story being authentic (a device frequently used in realistic fiction) would be an example of (non- critical) truth-centred metafiction.  Examples  = Laurence Sterne, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman = In this scene Tristram Shandy, the eponymous character and narrator of the novel, foregrounds the process of creating literature as he interrupts his previous thought and begins to talk about the beginnings of books. The scene evokes an explicitly metafictional response to the problem (and by addressing a problem of the novel one is just reading but also a general problem the excerpt is thus an example of both direct and indirect metafiction, which may additionally be classified as generally media-centred, non-critical metafiction). Through the lack of context to this sudden change of topic (writing a book is not a plot point, nor does this scene take place at the beginning of the novel, where such a scene might be more willingly accepted by the reader) the metafictional reflection is foregrounded. Additionally, the narrator addresses readers directly, thereby confronting readers with the fact that they are reading a constructed text. = David Lodge, The British Museum is Falling Down = This scene from The British Museum is Falling Down (1965) features several instances of metafiction. First, the speaker, Adam Appleby (the protagonist of the novel) discusses the change the rise of the novel brought upon the literary landscape, specifically with regards to thematic changes that occurred. Second, he talks about the mimetic aspect of realist novels. Third, he alludes to the notion that the capabilities of literature have been exhausted, and thus to the idea of the death of the novel (all of this is explicit, critical indirect metafiction). Fourth, he covertly foregrounds that fact that the characters in the novel are fictional characters, rather than masking this aspect, as would be the case in non-metafictional writing. Therefore, this scene features metafictional elements with reference to the medium (the novel), the form of art (literature), a genre (realism), and arguably also lays bare the fictionality of the characters and thus of the novel itself (which could be classified as critical, direct, fiction-centred metafiction). = Jasper Fforde, The Eyre Affair = The Eyre Affair (2001) is set in an alternative history in which it is possible to enter the world of a work of literature through the use of a machine. In the novel, literary detective Thursday Next chases a criminal through the world of Charlotte Bront√´'s Jane Eyre. This paradoxical transgression of narrative boundaries is called metalepsis, an implicitly metafictional device when used in literature. Metalepsis has a high inherent potential to disrupt aesthetic illusion and confronts the reader with the fictionality of the text. However, as metalepsis is used as a plot device that has been introduced as part of the world of The Eyre Affair it can, in this instance, have the opposite effect and is compatible with immersion. It can thus be seen as an example of metafiction that does not (necessarily) break aesthetic illusion.

After graduating from Detroit Catholic Central in 1951, Sebring served in the Navy for four years, and during this time he fought in the Korean War. He then moved to Los Angeles, where he adopted the name Jay Sebring: Jay, after the first initial of his middle name, and Sebring after the famous Florida car race. In Las Vegas, on October 10, 1960, Sebring married model Bonnie Lee Marple,Nevada, Marriage Index, 1956‚Äì2005 nicknamed Cami ‚Äì a union which ended unofficially in August 1963. Career In Los Angeles, he graduated from beauty school and promptly \\"invented a whole new way of cutting men's hair\\". His innovations including shampooing men's hair before styling it, cutting their hair with scissors instead of clippers, and using blow dryers, which were popular in Europe but not well known in the United States. He used hair spray in an era when Brylcreem was the accepted hair product for men. In Los Angeles, his modish salon and his style of cutting hair proved popular. He taught his methods to others who then opened Jay Sebring Salon franchises; his styling techniques were still being taught 40 years after his death. In 1967 he opened the company Sebring International to franchise his salons and sell hair care products. At a time when barbers charged $1 to $2 for a haircut, Sebring charged $50 and more. His hair styling clients included Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen. He flew to Las Vegas every three weeks to cut the hair of Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. At Kirk Douglas' request, Sebring did the hair styling for the movie Spartacus. He later designed The Doors' Jim Morrison's free-flowing style. His business, Sebring International, was flourishing by the late 1960s, with profitable salons in West Hollywood, New York City and London. Sebring maintained a playboy lifestyle, with high-profile Hollywood personalities like Beatty among his closest associates. According to a Hollywood Reporter article published in 2019, Sebring used his salon to distribute drugs and was nicknamed \\"The Candyman\\" by his Hollywood clients. Sebring assisted with launching the film career of Bruce Lee, after meeting him at the International Karate Championships in Long Beach in 1964. He introduced Lee to his producer friend Bill Dozier, who started Lee's career with The Green Hornet.Hermenaut.com Although not seeking an acting career himself, Sebring made a cameo appearance in the December 1966 episode of the TV show Batman, playing a character based on himself called Mr. Oceanbring.

Future members of the notorious Manson Family were also seen in it.Mondo Hollywood: Hollywood Laid Bare! (1967) - IMDb Relationship with Sharon Tate Sebring was introduced to Sharon Tate by journalist Joe Hyams in October 1964 and they began a relationship. Sebring bought the former home of Paul Bern, husband of Jean Harlow, on Easton Drive in Benedict Canyon, then owned by Sally Forrest. Tate went to London in early 1966 to work on The Fearless Vampire Killers with film director Roman Polanski. They began a relationship, and Tate ended her relationship with Sebring, who travelled to London to meet Polanski. He befriended Polanski, while remaining a friend to Tate. Polanski would later comment that despite Sebring's lifestyle, he was a very lonely person, who regarded Tate and Polanski as his family. In the summer of 1968, Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate introduced Sebring to Polanski's friend Wojciech Frykowski and his girlfriend, Folgers coffee heiress Abigail Folger, who had recently moved to Los Angeles from New York. Folger later invested in Sebring's hair-care products for men. In early May 1969, Sebring opened a new salon at 629 Commercial Street in San Francisco, and a champagne reception followed. Guests included Abigail Folger and her mother, Ines, as well as Paul Newman and his wife, Joanne Woodward.  Death on Cielo Drive  On August 8, 1969, Sebring, Tate, Frykowski, and Folger went to El Coyote, a Mexican restaurant, together. After they returned to the Polanski residence on Cielo Drive, Patricia Krenwinkel, Susan Atkins and Charles \\"Tex\\" Watson, members of the \\"Charles Manson Family\\", entered the home. After coercing the four occupants of the house into the living room, they ordered them to lie face down on the floor. Sebring protested and asked the intruders to consider Tate's advanced pregnancy. Watson then shot Sebring, and kicked him several times in the face as he lay dying, breaking his nose and eye socket. He was then stabbed seven times and died from blood loss caused by his stab wounds. The group then murdered Frykowski, Folger, and Tate. On Wednesday, August 13, funerals for Tate and Sebring took place the same day; the funerals were scheduled several hours apart (first for Tate and then Sebring) to allow mutual friends to attend both.

By volume, it is the largest known living single-stem tree on Earth. While the General Sherman is the largest currently living tree, it is not the largest historically recorded tree. The Crannell Creek Giant, a coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) near Trinidad, California, is estimated to have been 15-25% larger than the General Sherman tree by volume. That tree was cut down in the mid-1940s. Another larger coast redwood, the Lindsey Creek tree with more than \\"535,000 board feet of merchantable timber\\" Largest Tree Ever Recorded (UBC Botanical Garden, 2010-02-04) was reported felled by a storm in 1905 Humboldt Times Standard article. History California's Sequoia National Park The General Sherman was named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman. The official story, which may be apocryphal, claims the tree was named in 1879 by naturalist James Wolverton, who had served as a lieutenant in the 9th Indiana Cavalry under Sherman. Seven years later, in 1886, the land came under the control of the Kaweah Colony, a utopian socialist community whose economy was based on logging. Noting the pivotal role that Sherman had played in the Indian Wars and his forced relocation of native American tribes, they renamed the tree in honor of Karl Marx. However, the community was disbanded in 1892, primarily as a result of the establishment of Sequoia National Park, and the tree reverted to its previous name. In 1931, following comparisons with the nearby General Grant tree, General Sherman was identified as the largest tree in the world. One result of this process was that wood volume became widely accepted as the standard for establishing and comparing the size of different trees. In January 2006 the largest branch on the tree (seen most commonly, in older photos, as an \\"L\\" or golf-club shape, protruding from about a quarter of the way down the trunk) broke off. There were no witnesses to the incident, and the branch ‚Äî larger than most tree trunks; diameter over and length over ‚Äî smashed part of the perimeter fence and cratered the pavement of the surrounding walkway. The breakage is not believed to be indicative of any abnormalities in the tree's health, and may even be a natural defense mechanism against adverse weather conditions. Dimensions A child standing under the tree. While it is the largest tree known, the General Sherman Tree is neither the tallest known living tree on Earth (that distinction belongs to the Hyperion tree, a Coast redwood), nor is it the widest (both the largest cypress and largest baobab have a greater diameter), nor is it the oldest known living tree on Earth (that distinction belongs to a Great Basin bristlecone pine).

What happens is that the seller waits for a potential buyer's offer and can then either accept or reject that 'named price' that the user had offered. As the Internet is continuously being developed and the online marketplaces are becoming increasingly more popular, consumers have more choices in terms of product pricing. Popularised by the reverse auction pioneer, Priceline.com, such pricing strategy asks consumers to 'name their own price' for various products and services like air tickets, hotels, rental cars, etc. The first bid a consumer places and the subsequent bid increments express the consumer's willingness or unwillingness to haggle. \\"The economic argument is that the number of bids a consumer submits to win a product in a NYOP auction is determined by the bidder‚Äôs intention to trade off higher expected savings from haggling against the associated frictional costs\\". NYOP retailers do not post a price for their products, and the final price of the transaction is only determined via a \\"reverse auction process\\", and these are key features that distinguish hotels and travel intermediaries from NYOP retailers. Originally, Name-your-own-price sales are considered \\"opaque\\" by marketers because buyers \\"don't know the name of the supplier (airline, hotel or car rental company) or the schedule (with air tickets) until after\\" they make a nonrefundable purchase. Suppliers benefit because they can sell to the most price-conscious buyers/travelers without publicly disclosing those low rates. Priceline.com Priceline.com logo Jay Walker, founder of Priceline.com, shows one of the many artifacts from his library‚Ä¶ an Apollo in- flight instruction manual Priceline.com, an online travel agency offered a \\"name Your Own Price\\" option. However, by 2005, Priceline began to de- emphasize this system, and added published price options on its websites. A 2014 academic study showed that posted prices can guarantee higher profitability to service providers than the name-your-own-price mechanism. =Priceline's price discrimination methods= Priceline.com has two different methods of price discrimination according to the product categories offered. For example, for multi-attributable products that are fairly close substitutes, such as hotel accommodation or air travel, Priceline uses a certain price discrimination method where potential buyers place offers on such products, uncertain about some of the attributes of the product. For instance, customers placing offers for air travel are uncertain about the travel schedule in details and do not know which carriers will place their orders, thus allowing Priceline to screen consumers according to their type, and this in turn allows airlines to serve customers that they were not able to distinguish from less price-sensitive customers before. Priceline uses a different price discrimination method for selling undifferentiated goods. Using this method, Priceline uses haggling effort‚Äîrepresenting consumer effort and time loss from the online haggling process‚Äî as a way of discriminating between different customers. For example, a consumer placing an offer for calling capacity can start with a low offer and then‚Äî after waiting for a 60-second time period and then getting rejected‚Äî the offer is incremented. Before barring customers from submitting additional offers for 24 hours, Priceline allows customers to submit three offers consecutively for the same phone number and the same capacity. Consumer interaction with NYOP retailer =Consumer and wholesaler's perspective= Firstly, the consumer is asked to provide certain identification if he/she is an existing user, or to register as a new user. This is followed by the consumer setting an offer for the desired product. Afterwards, the retailer compares the consumer's offered price with an internal threshold price. If the consumer's offer exceeds the threshold, the transaction then occurs at the consumer's named price. If the named price is below the threshold, the NYOP retailer informs the user that his/her offer was too low and then the user is given the opportunity to submit an incremented offer after a certain pre-set delay period (For Priceline, it is usually a 24-hour period), and comparison with the internal threshold price is done again. =NYOP retailer's perspective= The NYOP retailer \\"acts as an intermediary between the consumer and the wholesaler.\\" The intermediary needs to determine a threshold price above which they are willing to accept the offer from the consumer. As the consumer's offer succeeds, this leads to two sources of profit. The first source is the information rent the intermediary receives, which is the difference between the consumer's submitted offer price and the threshold price. The second source is the difference between the threshold price and the wholesale price, if the NYOP retailer chooses a threshold price that is above the wholesale price. The NYOP retailer also has control over the user interface design. Therefore, the retailer may influence the consumer's haggling effort \\"via the amount of information the consumer has to key in for every offer\\". In addition, the NYOP retailer is in charge of choosing the time delay between receiving an offer from the consumer and informing him/her about the offer's outcome (whether it is accepted or rejected) and this impacts the consumer's haggling effort directly.

Frederick Augustus Hervey, 4th Earl of Bristol and Lord Bishop of Derry. Frederick William Hervey, 1st Marquess of Bristol, 5th Baron Hervey MP, FRS, FSA This family descends from Sir Thomas Hervey. He was Member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds from 1679 to 1690, and many members of the family represented this constituency in the House of Commons. The first to follow in his footsteps was his son John Hervey. On 27 March 1702/3, he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Hervey, of Ickworth in the County of Suffolk, and on 19 October 1714 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Bristol in the Peerage of Great Britain. The 1st Earl of Bristol died in 1751. His two eldest sons (Carr and John) having died before him, he was succeeded in turn by three of his grandsons ‚Äì all brothers and sons of the 1st Earl's younger son John. An early ancestor of Sir Thomas Hervey was John Hervey (b.1290) of Bedfordshire. His descendant was Thomas Hervey (d.1467), who was the first Hervey to live at Ickworth, Suffolk. The 2nd Earl held political office as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and Lord Privy Seal and died unmarried. He was succeeded as 3rd Earl by his younger brother, who was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and also served as Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1766 to 1767. He also died without legitimate issue and was succeeded in December 1779 by the next younger brother, who thereby became the 4th Earl. Known as the \\"Earl-Bishop\\", the fourth Earl served as Church of Ireland Lord Bishop of Cloyne from 1767 to 1768 and as Lord Bishop of Derry from 1768 to 1803. Although an efficient clergyman, varying estimates have been found of his character. He had a reputation for high living, and hostelries in various countries took to calling themselves the ‚ÄòHotel Bristol‚Äô, implying that they were the best in town. The custom continues today. In 1795, he began expanding his ancestral home, thus creating Ickworth House in its modern form. The house was still unfinished when he died in 1803 and was completed by his successor. In 1799, he became the fifth Baron Howard de Walden when the abeyance of this peerage was terminated. Bishop Lord Bristol married Elizabeth, sister and heir of Sir Charles Davers, 5th Baronet (c. 1730‚Äì1763), and great-granddaughter of Thomas Jermyn, 2nd Baron Jermyn (see the Baron Jermyn). His second son, John Augustus Hervey, Lord Hervey, was a captain in the Royal Navy and also served as ambassador to Florence. He predeceased his father. His daughter, the Hon. Elizabeth Catherine Caroline Hervey (1780‚Äì1803), married Charles Ellis, later first Baron Seaford. Their son Charles succeeded as sixth Baron Howard of Walden on the death of his great-grandfather, Lord Bristol, in 1803 (see Baron Howard de Walden and Baron Seaford). Upon the 4th Earl's death, the Bristol title passed to his third but eldest surviving son Frederick, who thereby became the 5th Earl. He was a politician and served under Henry Addington as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs from 1801 to 1803. In 1826 the 5th Earl was created Marquess of Bristol and Earl Jermyn, of Horningsheath in the County of Suffolk, both in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. On his death in 1859 the titles passed to his eldest son Frederick (1800‚Äì1864). The 2nd Marquess was a Tory politician and was Treasurer of the Household under Sir Robert Peel from 1841 to 1846. When he died, the marquessate passed to his eldest son, also named Frederick. Before succeeding as 3rd Marquess, he had represented the traditional family seat in parliament and also served as Lord-Lieutenant of Suffolk. The 3rd Marquess died without male issue and was succeeded in turn by two of his nephews, the sons of Lord Augustus Hervey, second son of the 2nd Marquess. The 4th Marquess was a rear- admiral in the Royal Navy and also sat, as his uncle had done, as Conservative Member of Parliament for Bury St Edmunds. He had no sons and was succeeded in the Hervey titles and estates by his younger brother. The 5th Marquess was Minister and Consul-General to Colombia from 1919 to 1923, and Minister to Peru and Ecuador from 1923 to 1929. His only son, the 6th Marquess, was chancellor of the Monarchist League. He moved to Monte Carlo in early 1979 as tax exile, where he died on 10 March 1985. The 6th Marquess of Bristol married three times. His son from his first marriage succeeded as 7th Marquess. A flamboyant character, he died childless at the age of 44 in January 1999. The 6th Marquess's only child from his second marriage, Lord Nicholas Hervey, died at the age of 36 in 1998. From his third marriage, the 6th Marquess had three children: Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol, Lady Victoria Hervey and Lady Isabella Hervey. Other family members A significant number of other members of the family have also gained distinction. Sir Nicholas Hervey (d. 1532), brother of John Hervey, great-great-great-grandfather of the first Earl, was Ambassador from Henry VIII to the Holy Roman Emperor and took part in the famous jousts at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. His grandson Henry Hervey was created Baron Hervey in 1620. The Hon. Thomas Hervey, second son from the second marriage of the first Earl, held the family seat in parliament. The Hon. William Hervey, third son from the second marriage of the first Earl, was a captain in the Royal Navy. The Hon. Felton Hervey, sixth son from the second marriage of the first Earl, represented the family seat in Parliament and was the grandfather of Felton Hervey-Bathurst, who was created a baronet in 1818 (see Hervey-Bathurst baronets). Sir George William Hervey (1845‚Äì1915), Comptroller-General and Secretary of the National Debt from 1894 to 1910, was the son of Lord William Hervey (1805‚Äì1850), third son of the first Marquess. The Right Reverend Lord Arthur Hervey, fourth son of the first Marquess, was Lord Bishop of Bath and Wells between 1869 and 1894. Lord Alfred Hervey, sixth son of the first Marquess, was a Conservative politician. His eldest son, The Very Reverend Frederick Alfred John Canon Hervey (1846‚Äì1910), was Chaplain-in-Ordinary to Queen Victoria from 1886 to 1901, and Domestic Chaplain to King Edward VII from 1878 to 1910. Lord Augustus Hervey, second son of the second Marquess, sat as Member of Parliament for the Western Division of Suffolk. Lord Francis Hervey, fourth son of the second Marquess, represented the most often held local seat in Parliament and served as First Civil Service Commissioner from 1907 to 1909.

The Herveys lived at Ickworth House and Park, Ickworth, Suffolk from the mid 15th century to 1998. The present-day facade of the house was built by the end of the 18th century under the 4th Earl of Bristol. The traditional burial place of the Hervey family is Ickworth Church surrounded by the estate. The line of Herveys buried in the vault under the church and in the churchyard begins with Thomas Hervey (d. 1467, who was the first of this family to own Ickworth) and includes every Earl and Marquess of Bristol, as well as many of their daughters and wives. In 1956, on the death of the 4th Marquess (d. 1951), his widow gave the house and grounds to the National Trust in abatement of death duties on cash and personal effects as absolute owners since the as a precondition imposed by the death duties regime (see inheritance tax), tempered by the discretion of the National Trust in granting limited leasebacks on strict terms to ancestral owners. The family, through whoever is Marquess of Bristol, was given a 99-year lease to occupy the East Wing of Ickworth, upon paying yearly expenses and below market rent. In 1998, the 7th Marquess surrendered the remaining term of the lease to the National Trust, partly for funds and partly to ward off threatened forfeiture based on his behaviour as tenant. He died in 1999 with minimal remaining assets. His heir, the Frederick Hervey, 8th Marquess of Bristol, spoke in 2001 of his anger at not being granted a new lease as it went against the original Letter of Wishes when the house was handed over to the National Trust.Interview with The Suffolk Magazine, August 2001 The National Trust converted the East Wing into a hotel. In 2009 Sir Simon Jenkins, the National Trust's new chairman, stated, \\"I think it is in our interest for the Marquesses of Bristol to be living there.\\" See also *Earl of Bristol *Davers baronets *Baron Jermyn *Baron Hervey (1620 creation) *Baron Howard de Walden *Baron Seaford *Hervey-Bathurst baronets *Ickworth House *Ickworth Church *Hotel Bristol Notes References *Kidd, Charles & Williamson, David (editors).

Nf3 Nc6 :3. Bb5 The Ruy Lopez is named after 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy L√≥pez de Segura. It is one of the most popular openings, with such a vast number of variations that all codes from C60 to C99 in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings (ECO) are assigned to them. History The opening is named after the 16th-century Spanish priest Ruy L√≥pez de Segura, who made a systematic study of this and other openings in the 150-page book on chess Libro del Ajedrez, written in 1561. Although it bears his name, this particular opening was included in the G√∂ttingen manuscript, which dates from c.1490. Popular use of the Ruy Lopez opening did not develop, however, until the mid-19th century, when the Russian theoretician Carl Jaenisch \\"rediscovered\\" its potential. The opening remains the most commonly used amongst the open games in master play; it has been adopted by almost all players during their careers, many of whom have played it with both colours. Due to the difficulty for Black in achieving equality, a common nickname for the opening is \\"The Spanish Torture\\". Basics At the most basic level, White's third move attacks the knight which defends the e5-pawn from the attack by the f3-knight. White's apparent threat to win Black's e-pawn with 4.Bxc6 dxc6 5.Nxe5 is illusory‚ÄîBlack can respond with 5...Qd4, forking the knight and e4-pawn, which will win back the with a good position. White's 3.Bb5 is still a good move; it a piece, prepares castling, and sets up a potential pin against Black's king. Since White's third move carries no immediate threat, however, Black can respond in a wide variety of ways. Traditionally, White's objective in playing the Ruy Lopez is to spoil Black's pawn structure; either way Black recaptures following the exchange on c6 will have negative features, though recapturing gains the . In modern practice, however, White does not always exchange bishop for knight on c6, preferring the retreat 4.Ba4 if chased by 3...a6. The theory of the Ruy Lopez is the most extensively developed of all Open Games, with some lines having been analysed well beyond move thirty. At nearly every move there are many reasonable alternatives, and most have been deeply explored. It is convenient to divide the possibilities into two groups based on whether or not Black responds with (3...a6), which is named the Morphy Defence after Paul Morphy, although he was not the originator of the line.Morphy played 3...a6 in the second (a draw) and fourth (a win for Morphy) games of his 1858 match with Adolf Anderssen. Philip W. Sergeant, Morphy's Games of Chess, Dover, 1957, pp. 106‚Äì08, 110‚Äì12. . The move had been played much earlier, however. Charles Henry Stanley played 3...a6 twice in his 1845 match, held in Morphy's hometown of New Orleans, against Eug√®ne Rousseau for the United States Chess Championship. Stanley lost both games, although he won the match. Andy Soltis and Gene McCormick, \\"The Morphy Defense\\", Chess Life, August 1984, pp. 26‚Äì27. Howard Staunton also mentioned 3...a6 in his Chess-Player's Handbook, first published in 1847. Howard Staunton, The Chess-Player's Handbook (2nd ed. 1848), Henry C. Bohn, pp. 147, 149. The variations with Black moves other than 3...a6 are older and generally simpler, but the Morphy Defence lines are more commonly played. Morphy Defence: 3...a6 By far the most commonly played third move for Black is the Morphy Defence, 3...a6, which \\"puts the question\\" to the white bishop. The main point of 3...a6 is that after the common retreat 4.Ba4, Black will have the possibility of breaking a future pin on the by playing ...b5. White must take some care not to fall into the Noah's Ark Trap, in which Black traps White's on the b3-square with a ...a6, ...b5, and ...c4 pawn advance on the . Ercole del Rio, in his 1750 treatise Sopra il giuoco degli Scacchi, Osservazioni pratiche dell'anonimo Modenese (On the game of Chess, practical Observations by an anonymous Modenese), was the first author to mention 3...a6.Harry Golombek, Chess: A History, G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1976, pp. 117‚Äì18. The move became popular after it was played by Paul Morphy, however, and it is named for him. Steinitz did not approve of the move; in 1889, he wrote, \\"on principle this ought to be disadvantageous as it drives the bishop where it wants to go\\". Steinitz's opinion did not prevail, however; today, 3...a6 is played in over 65 percent of all games beginning with the Ruy Lopez.As of 2016-11-23, Chess-DB.com reports that 243,757 out of 355,830 games in its database beginning with the Ruy Lopez, continued with 3...a6, i.e. a percentage of approx. 68.5%. Similarly, 365Chess.com reports a 69.3% percentage (100,540 out of 145,061 games) and ChessBase.com (requires free registration) reports a 74.3% percentage (63,183 out of 85,022 games). =Morphy Defence: alternatives to Closed Defence= After 3...a6, the most commonly played line is the Closed Defence, which goes 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7, discussed in the two following sections. Alternatives to the Closed Defence described in this section are: * 4.Bxc6 (Exchange Variation) * 4.Ba4 ** 4...b5 5.Bb3 Na5 (Norwegian Variation) ** 4...b5 5.Bb3 Bc5 (Graz Defence) ** 4...b5 5.Bb3 Bb7 (Caro Variation) ** 4...Bc5 (Classical Defence Deferred) ** 4...Nge7 (Cozio Defence Deferred) ** 4...g6 (Fianchetto Defence Deferred) ** 4...f5 (Schliemann Defence Deferred) ** 4...d6 (Modern Steinitz Defence) ** 4...Nf6 5.Nc3 (Ruy Lopez Four Knights Variation) ** 4...Nf6 5.Qe2 (Wormald Attack) ** 4...Nf6 5.d4 (Mackenzie Variation) ** 4...Nf6 5.d3 (Anderssen Variation) ** 4...Nf6 5.0-0 d6 (Russian Defence) ** 4...Nf6 5.0-0 Bc5 (M√∏ller Defence) ** 4...Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Bb7 (Arkhangelsk Defence) ** 4...Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5 (Modern Arkhangelsk Defence) ** 4...Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4 (Open Defence) Exchange Variation: 4.Bxc6  In the Exchange Variation, 4.Bxc6, (ECO C68‚ÄìC69) White damages Black's pawn structure, giving him a ready-made long-term plan of playing d4 ...exd4 Qxd4, followed by exchanging all the pieces and winning the pure pawn ending. Max Euwe gives the pure pawn ending in this position (with all pieces except kings removed) as a win for White.M√ºller & Lamprecht, pp. 147‚Äì48. Black gains good compensation, however, in the form of the bishop pair, and the variation is not considered White's most ambitious, though former world champions Emanuel Lasker and Bobby Fischer employed it with success. After 4.Bxc6, Black almost always responds 4...dxc6. 4...bxc6 is rarely played due to the reply 5.d4 exd4 6.Qxd4 and White is in . After 4...dxc6, the obvious 5.Nxe5 is weak, since 5...Qd4 6.Nf3 Qxe4+ 7.Qe2 Qxe2+ 8.Kxe2 leaves White with no compensation for Black's bishop pair. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Lasker had great success with 5.d4 exd4 6.Qxd4 Qxd4 7.Nxd4, most notable his famous win against Jose Raul Capablanca in the St. Petersburg 1914 chess tournament. Since then, better defences for Black have been developed, and this line is considered to slightly favour Black. Jon Jacobs wrote in the July 2005 Chess Life (p. 21): \\"A database search (limited to games longer than 20 moves, both players FIDE 2300+) reveals the position after 7.Nxd4 was reached 20 times from 1985‚Äì2002. White's results were abysmal: +0‚àí7=13.\\" After 5.Nc3, Black usually plays 5...f6 to defend the e-pawn. A notable game is Adhiban‚ÄìNakamura from the 2013 FIDE World Cup. The flexible 5.0-0 is sometimes called the Barendregt Variation, but it was Fischer who developed it into a serious weapon in the 1960s. Unlike 5.d4, it forces Black to defend the e-pawn, usually with 5...f6, 5...Bg4, 5...Qd6 (the sharpest line, preparing queenside castling), 5...Qe7, 5...Qf6 or 5...Bd6. A rare but playable move is 5...Be6 (or 5...Be7), the idea being that if White plays 6.Nxe5, Black plays 6... Qd4, forking the knight and the e4-pawn. The move ...Qd4, regaining the pawn at e4, is usually impossible in these variations once White has castled, due to the open e-file. Notable games are Fischer‚ÄìPortisch, and Fischer‚ÄìGligoric, both played at the 17th Chess Olympiad in Havana 1966. White may also delay the exchange for a move or two: 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.Bxc6 or 5.0-0 Be7 6.Bxc6 (the Delayed Exchange Deferred), for example; at first glance this seems a waste of time, but Black having played ...Nf6 rules out defending the pawn with ...f6, and the bishop already being on e7 means that ...Bd6 would be a loss of tempo. Norwegian Defence: 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 Na5  The Norwegian Variation (also called the Taimanov or Wing Variation) (ECO C70), 3...a6 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 Na5 aims to eliminate the white bishop but is generally considered too time-consuming for Black. The usual continuation is 6.0-0 d6 7.d4 Nxb3, but the speculative sacrifice 6.Bxf7+ Kxf7 7.Nxe5+, which drives the black king out, has been played. With accurate play, however, Black can avoid any disadvantage while holding onto the extra piece. In the 1950s, Mark Taimanov played it with some success, though it remained a sideline, as it has to this day. This defence has been known since the 1880s and was reintroduced in 1901 by Carl Schlechter. The Norwegian connection was first introduced by Svein Johannessen who played the line from 1957 and later strengthened when Simen Agdestein and some other Norwegian players adopted the variation. In 1995 Jonathan Tisdall published the article \\"Ruy Lopez. The Norwegian Variation\\" in New in Chess Yearbook 37. Variations combining 3...a6 and ...Bc5 The Graz Defence, Classical Defence Deferred, and M√∏ller Defence combine 3...a6 with the active move ...Bc5. For a century it was believed that it was safer for Black to place the bishop on e7, but it is much more active on c5. White can gain time after playing d4 as the black bishop will have to move, but this does not always seem to be as important as was once thought.MCO-14, p.54. The M√∏ller Defence, 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Bc5 was already an old line in 1903 when Dane J√∏rgen M√∏ller (1873‚Äì1944) analysed it in Tidsskrift f√∂r Schack. Alexander Alekhine played this for Black in the early portion of his career; despite his advocacy, it never achieved great popularity, and even he eventually came to consider it dubious. The Graz Defence, 3...a6 4.Ba4 b5 5.Bb3 Bc5, was analysed by Alois Fink (b. 1910) in √ñsterreichische Schachzeitung in 1956 and in Wiener Schach Nachrichten in 1979, although it did not become popular until the 1990s. Modern Steinitz Defence: 4.Ba4 d6  In the Modern Steinitz Defence (also called Neo- Steinitz Defence) (ECO C71‚ÄìC76), Black interpolates 3...a6 4.Ba4 before playing 4...d6, which was frequently played by Alekhine, Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca and Paul Keres. The possibility of breaking the pin with a timely ...b5 gives Black more latitude than in the Old Steinitz Defence; in particular, in the Old Steinitz, White can practically force Black to give up the stronghold at e5, but in the Modern Steinitz, Black is able to maintain control of the . Most plausible White moves are playable here, including 5.c3, 5.c4, 5.Bxc6, 5.d4, and 5.0-0. The sharp Siesta Variation arises after 5.c3 f5, while a manoeuvring game results from the calmer 5.c3 Bd7 6.d4. The game is also sharp after 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6.d4 (ECO C73) or 5.0-0 Bg4 6.h3 h5 (ECO C72). The older lines starting with 5.c4 and 5.d4 are not regarded as testing for Black, though the latter offers a tricky gambit. There are six ECO classifications for the Modern Steinitz. White's responses 5.d4, 5.Nc3, and 5.c4 are included in C71, while 5.0-0 is C72. The delayed exchange 5.Bxc6+ bxc6 6.d4 is C73. C74‚ÄìC76 all begin with 5.c3. C74 covers 5...Nf6, but primarily focuses on 5...f5 6.exf5 Bxf5 with 7.d4 or 7.0-0. C75's main continuation is 5...Bd7 6.d4 Nge7, the Rubinstein Variation. C76 is characterised by the Black fianchetto 5...Bd7 6.d4 g6. Schliemann Defence Deferred: 4.Ba4 f5  The Schliemann Defence Deferred, 3...a6 4.Ba4 f5, is rarely seen, with practically its only top-level appearance being in the 1974 Candidates Final, when Viktor Korchnoi adopted it versus Anatoly Karpov. It is considered inferior to the regular Schliemann, since White can answer effectively with 5.d4! exd4 6.e5. Mackenzie Variation: 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.d4  The variation 5.d4 (ECO C77), named after George Henry Mackenzie who employed it on a regular basis, is an old line which, according to modern theory, does not promise White any advantage, though is adopted as an alternative to the main variation 5.0-0. The main line continues with 5...exd4 (5... Nxe4 6.0-0 transposes to the Open Defence) 6.0-0 (6.e5 Ne4 is harmless) Be7 (6...Nxe4 transposes to the Riga Variation of the Open Defence) which leads to the Centre Attack (ECO C84) of the Closed Defence. Steinitz Defence Deferred: 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 d6  The Steinitz Defence Deferred (ECO C79) also called Russian Defence. With the move order 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 d6, Black waits until White castles before playing ...d6. This can enable Black to avoid some lines in the Steinitz Defence Deferred in which White castles although the position of the knight on f6 also precludes Black from supporting the centre with ...f7‚Äìf6. These nuances seem to have little importance today, as neither the Steinitz Defence Deferred nor the Russian Defence have been popular for many years. Chigorin played the Russian Defence in the 1890s, and later it was adopted by Rubinstein and Alekhine. The last significant use of the Russian Defence was in the 1950s when it was played by some Russian masters. Today however, it has purely practical value, as White has found numerous ways to an opening advantage by quickly opening lines in the center, where Black's developmental lag seems to be a significant factor. Arkhangelsk Defence: 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Bb7  The Arkhangelsk Defence (or Archangel Defence) (ECO C78) was popularized by Soviet players from the city of Arkhangelsk such as GM Vladimir Malaniuk. The variation begins 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Bb7. This line often leads to sharp positions in which Black wagers that the fianchettoed bishop's influence on the centre and kingside will offset Black's delay in castling. White has several options, including attempting to build an ideal pawn centre with c3 and d4, defending the e-pawn with Re1 or simply developing. The Arkhangelsk Defence is tactically justified by Black's ability to meet 7.Ng5 with 7...d5 8.exd5 Nd4! (not 8...Nxd5, when White gets the advantage with 9.Qh5 g6 10.Qf3). Modern Arkhangelsk Defence: 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 b5 6.Bb3 Bc5  The Modern Arkhangelsk Defence (or Modern Archangel Defence) (ECO C78) is a refinement of the regular Arkhangelsk Defence by incorporating ideas similar to the M√∏ller Defence. Black normally does not fianchetto the Queen's bishop, which would transpose to regular Arkhangelsk setups, but plays ...Bg4 to increase the pressure against White's pawn centre. White's main continuation is 7.a4 after which Black responds with the typical move 7...Rb8 reaching the starting point of this highly complex variation. Another line is the more traditional 7.c3 d6 8.d4 and after 8...Bb6 Black's position is fine. 8...exd4 occurred in Loewenthal‚ÄìMorphy, London 1859, which seems to be the first time this variation was ever played. Fabiano Caruana is one of the most notable players of this variation, employing it in the Candidates Tournament 2020. Peter Svidler recorded an entire video series about this defence. Open Defence: 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4  In the Open Defence, 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Nxe4, Black tries to make use of the time White will take to regain the pawn to gain a foothold in the centre, with play usually continuing 6.d4 b5 7.Bb3 d5 (but not 7...exd4? 8.Re1 d5 9.Nc3!, Bobby Fischer‚ÄìPetar Trifunovic, Bled 1961) 8.dxe5 Be6. Here 8.Nxe5, once adopted by Fischer, is much less often seen, and Black should equalise after the accurate 8...Nxe5 9.dxe5 c6, which avoids prematurely committing the light-squared bishop and solidly defends d5, often a problem in the Open. The Riga Variation, 6...exd4, is considered inferior; the main line runs 7.Re1 d5 8.Nxd4 Bd6! 9.Nxc6 Bxh2+! 10.Kh1! (10.Kxh2 Qh4+ 11.Kg1 Qxf2+ draws by perpetual check.) Qh4 11.Rxe4+! dxe4 12.Qd8+! Qxd8 13.Nxd8+ Kxd8 14.Kxh2 Be6 (14...f5 15.Bg5!) and now the endgame is considered to favour White after 15.Be3 or Nd2 (but not 15.Nc3 c5!, playing to trap the bishop). A famous example of this line is the game Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca‚ÄìEdward Lasker, New York 1915. White is objectively better here, but Black keeps some good practical chances owing to the sharp positions that occur. White has a variety of options at move nine, including 9.c3, 9.Be3, 9.Qe2 and 9.Nbd2. The classical line starts with 9.c3 when Black may choose 9...Be7 (the main line) or the aggressive 9...Bc5. After 9.c3 Bc5 10.Nbd2 0-0 11.Bc2, Black must meet the attack on e4, with the following possibilities from which to choose: 11...f5, 11...Bf5, both of which aim to maintain the strongpoint on e4, or the forcing line 11...Nxf2, introduced by the English amateur Vernon Dilworth. Today, 9.Be3 Be7 10.c3 is often used to transpose into the main line, 9.c3, while obviating the option of the Dilworth. An old continuation is 11...f5, when after 12.Nb3 Ba7 13.Nfd4 Nxd4 14.Nxd4 Bxd4 White can gain some advantage with Bogoljubov's 15.Qxd4. Instead, the very sharp La Grande Variante continues 15.cxd4 f4 16.f3 Ng3 17.hxg3 fxg3 18.Qd3 Bf5 19.Qxf5 Rxf5 20.Bxf5 Qh4 21.Bh3 Qxd4+ 22.Kh1 Qxe5, with unclear consequences. Perhaps the most famous game in this variation is Smyslov‚ÄìReshevsky, 1945 USSR‚ÄìUSA Radio Match. An analysis of the line had just been published in a Russian chess magazine, and Smyslov was able to follow it to quickly obtain a winning position. Reshevsky had not seen the analysis and he struggled in vain to solve the position over the board with his chess clock running. The Dilworth Variation (or Attack), 11...Nxf2 12.Rxf2 f6 13.exf6 Bxf2+ 14.Kxf2 Qxf6 has scored well for Black, with many traps for the ill-prepared White player. The main line leads to unbalanced endgames which are difficult to play for both sides, though with a strong drawing tendency. Artur Yusupov is one of the few grandmasters who has adopted the Dilworth repeatedly. In the Howell Attack (ECO C81), 9.Qe2, White aims for play against d5 after Rd1. The game usually continues 9...Be7 10.Rd1 followed by 10...Nc5 or 10...0-0. Paul Keres played this line against Max Euwe and Samuel Reshevsky at the World Chess Championship tournament 1948.This has been played at the top by World No.2 Fabiano Caruana among others, and he recommends this in his video series for Chessbase. Karpov's move, 9.Nbd2, limits Black's options. In the 1978 Karpov‚ÄìKorchnoi World Chess Championship match, following 9.Nbd2 Nc5 10.c3 d4 (10...Be7 is an old move that remains popular) Karpov introduced the surprising 11.Ng5, a move suggested by his trainer, Igor Zaitsev. If Black takes the knight with 11...Qxg5 White regains the material with 12.Qf3. This variation played a decisive role in a later World Championship match, Kasparov‚ÄìAnand 1995, when Anand was unable to successfully defend as Black. =Closed Defence 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7: alternatives to Main line= In the main line, White normally retreats the bishop with 4.Ba4, when the usual continuation is 4...Nf6 5.0-0 Be7. Black now threatens to win a pawn with 6...b5 followed by 7...Nxe4, so White must respond. Usually White defends the e-pawn with 6.Re1 which, in turn, threatens Black with the loss of a pawn after 7.Bxc6 and 8.Nxe5. Although it is possible to defend the pawn with 6...d6, Black most commonly averts this threat by driving away the white bishop with 6...b5 7.Bb3. After 4...Nf6 5.0-0 Be7, the most frequently seen continuation is 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0, discussed in the next section. Examined in this section are the alternatives to the main line: * 6.Bxc6 (Delayed Exchange Variation Deferred) * 6.d4 (Centre Attack) * 6.Qe2 (Worrall Attack) * 6.d3 (Modern Line) * 6.Re1 d6 (Averbakh Variation) * 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 ** 7...Bb7 (Trajkoviƒá Variation) ** 7...0-0 8.c3 d5 (Marshall Attack) Delayed Exchange Variation Deferred: 6.Bxc6  The Delayed Exchange Variation Deferred (or Exchange Variation Doubly Deferred) (ECO C85), 6.Bxc6, loses a tempo compared to the Exchange Variation, though in compensation, the black knight on f6 and bishop on e7 are awkwardly placed. The knight on f6 prevents Black from supporting the e-pawn with ...f7‚Äìf6, and the bishop is somewhat passively posted on e7. Centre Attack: 6.d4  The Centre Attack (or Centre Variation) (ECO C84), 6.d4, leads to sharp play. After 6... exd4 (6... Nxe4 and 6... b5 are viable alternatives) 7.Re1 b5 (7... 0-0 8. e5 Ne8 is a playable alternative) White can play either 8.Bb3 or the sharp 8.e5. In case of the immediate 7.e5 Black takes advantage of the absence of the white rook from e1 and plays 7... Ne4 with the idea of 8... Nc5. Worrall Attack: 6.Qe2  In the Worrall Attack (ECO C86), White substitutes 6.Qe2 for 6.Re1. The idea is that the queen will support the e-pawn, leaving the rook free to move to d1 to support the advance of the d-pawn, although there is not always time for this. Play normally continues 6...b5 7.Bb3 followed by 7...0-0 8.c3 and 8...d5 or 8...d6. Paul Keres played the line several times. More recently, Sergei Tiviakov has played it, as has Nigel Short, who essayed it twice in his 1992 match against Anatoly Karpov and won both games. Modern Line: 6.d3 By playing 6.d3 White steers clear of the Marshall Attack and any of the Anti-Marshall lines. White threatens 7.Bxc6 winning the e5-pawn leaving Black a choice of either 6...d6 or 6...b5. After 6...d6 the e5-pawn is firmly defended and Black threatens to trade off White's Ruy Lopez bishop with 7...b5 and 8...Na5. White normally continues with 7.c3 and after 8...0-0 White can choose between 9.Nbd2 or 9 Re1. Black can also play 6...b5 and after 7.Bb3 d6 (7...0-0 is a viable alternative) White has to deal with the threat of 8...Na5 by playing 8.a3 (8.c3 or 8 a4 are perfectly playable as well) and after 8...0-0 (the immediate 8...Na5 is also feasible) 9.Nc3 we have reached a modern tabiya of the Ruy Lopez. This position was first reached in a high-level encounter between Viswanathan Anand and Michael Adams, Grenke Chess Classic 2013. 6.d3 has gained wide popularity among the top players and has almost supplanted the Ruy Lopez main line with 6.Re1. Peter Svidler has dedicated an entire video series to the fashionable 6.d3 line. Averbakh Variation: 6.Re1 d6  In the Averbakh Variation (C87), named for Yuri Averbakh, Black defends the threatened e-pawn with 6...d6 instead of driving away the white bishop with the more common 6...b5. This defence shares some similarities with the Modern Steinitz and Russian Defences as Black avoids the ...b5 advance that weakens the queenside. White can reply with either 7.Bxc6 bxc6 8.d4 or 7.c3 Bg4 (it is too late for Black to transpose into the more usual lines of the Closed Defence, because 7...b5 would allow 8.Bc2, saving White a tempo over the two-move sequence Bb3‚Äìc2 found in other variations). The pin temporarily prevents White from playing d2‚Äìd4. In response, White can either force d4 with 8.h3 Bh5 9.Bxc6 bxc6 10.d4, or postpone d4 for the time being and play 8.d3 followed by manoeuvering the queen knight to the kingside with Nbd2‚Äìf1‚Äìg3. Trajkoviƒá Variation: 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 Bb7  An alternative to 6...d6 is 6...b5 7.Bb3 Bb7. This is known as the Trajkoviƒá Variation. Black may sacrifice a pawn with 8.c3 d5 9.exd5 Nxd5 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Rxe5 Nf4. 7...0-0 After 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3, Black often plays 7...0-0. Here White can play 8.c3, but has other moves. Alternatives are 8.a4, 8.h3, 8.d4, and 8.d3, which are often called \\"anti- Marshall\\" moves. White can also play 8.Nc3 with the idea of playing 9.Nd5 later. When White opts for 8.c3, Black can and often does play 8...d6, which is a commonly used transposition to the main line. However, Black can also play 8...d5 for the Marshall Attack. =Marshall Attack: 7...0-0 8.c3 d5 = One of Black's more aggressive alternatives is the Marshall Attack: after 3...a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 Black plays the gambit 8...d5, sacrificing a pawn. The main line begins with 9.exd5 Nxd5 (9...e4?!, the Herman Steiner variation, is considered weaker) 10.Nxe5 Nxe5 11.Rxe5 c6 (Marshall's original moves, 11...Nf6, and 11...Bb7 are considered inferior, but have also yielded good results at top levels of play for Black. GM Joel Benjamin suggests that 11...Bb7 is inferior due to 12.Qf3). The resulting position is shown in the diagram. To the casual observer it might seem that Black has been careless and lost a pawn; however, the sacrifice has also stripped White's of its defenders, given Black a lead in development, and rendered White's 8.c3 irrelevant. Since Black's compensation is based on rather than considerations, it is difficult or perhaps impossible to find a refutation. Black generally goes all-in with a massive kingside attack, which has been analysed to great depth (sometimes beyond move 30) with no definite conclusion as to the Marshall's soundness. The Marshall Attack is a very sharp opening system in which a great amount of theoretical knowledge is vital, and many White players, including Garry Kasparov, avoid it by playing one of the anti-Marshall systems, 8.d4, 8.a4 or 8.h3 instead of 8.c3. This gambit became famous when Frank James Marshall used it as a against Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca in 1918; nevertheless, Capablanca found a way through the complications and won. It is often said that Marshall had kept this gambit a secret for use against Capablanca since his defeat in their 1909 match. The most common counterclaim is that Marshall had used a similar approach in 1917 against Walter Frere. However, Edward Winter found no clear evidence of the date for Frere‚ÄìMarshall; several games between 1910 and 1918 where Marshall passed up opportunities to use the Marshall Attack against Capablanca; and an 1893 game that used the same line as in Frere‚ÄìMarshall. Improvements to Black's play were found (Marshall played 11...Nf6!? originally, but later discovered 11...c6!) and the Marshall Attack was adopted by top players including Boris Spassky, John Nunn and more recently Michael Adams. In the Classical World Chess Championship 2004, challenger Peter Leko used the Marshall to win an important game against World Champion Vladimir Kramnik. Currently, Armenian Grandmaster Levon Aronian is one of the main advocates for the Marshall Attack. =Main line: 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0 = The main lines of the Closed Ruy Lopez continue 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0. White can now play 9.d3 or 9.d4, but by far the most common move is 9.h3 which prepares d4 while preventing the awkward pin ...Bg4. This can be considered the main line of the opening as a whole and thousands of top-level games have reached this position. White aims to play d4 followed by Nbd2‚Äìf1‚Äìg3, which would firmly support e4 with the bishops on open diagonals and both knights threatening Black's kingside. Black will try to counter this knight manoeuver by expanding on the queenside, taking action in the centre, or putting pressure on e4. After 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 d6 8.c3 0-0, we have: * 9.d3 (Pilnik Variation) * 9.d4 (Yates Variation) ** 9.d4 Bg4 (Bogoljubow Variation) ** 9.d4 Bg4 10.a4 (Yates Variation, Short Attack) * 9.a3 (Suetin Variation) * 9.Bc2 (Lutikov Variation) * 9.h3 ** 9...Na5 (Chigorin Variation) ** 9...Nb8 (Breyer Variation) ** 9...Bb7 (Zaitsev Variation) ** 9...Nd7 (Karpov Variation) ** 9...Be6 (Kholmov Variation) ** 9...h6 (Smyslov Variation) ** 9...Qd7 (Smyslov Variation) ** 9...a5 (Keres Variation) Pilnik Variation: 9.d3  The Pilnik Variation, named for Herman Pilnik, is also known as the Teichmann Variation from the game Teichmann‚ÄìSchlechter, Karlsbad 1911. White plays 9.d3 intending to later advance to d4 under favourable circumstances. Although d2‚Äìd3‚Äìd4 appears to lose a tempo compared to d2‚Äìd4, White may be able to omit h3 regaining the tempo, especially if Black plays ...Bb7. Yates Variation and Bogoljubow Variation: 9.d4  White usually plays 9.h3 instead of 9.d4 (the Yates Variation) because after 9.d4 Bg4 (the Bogoljubow Variation), the pin of the white is troublesome. The variation takes its name from the game Capablanca‚ÄìBogoljubow, London 1922. Chigorin Variation: 9.h3 Na5  The Chigorin Variation was refined by Mikhail Chigorin around the turn of the 20th century and became the primary Black defence to the Ruy Lopez for more than fifty years. With 9...Na5 Black chases the white bishop from the a2‚Äìg8 diagonal and frees the c-pawn for queenside expansion. After 10.Bc2 c5 11.d4 the classical Black follow up is 11...Qc7, reinforcing e5 and placing the queen on the c-file which may later become open after ...cxd4. Other Black moves in this position are 11...Bb7 and 11...Nd7; the latter was adopted by Keres a few times in the 1960s. The Chigorin Variation has declined in popularity because Black must spend some time bringing his offside knight on a5 back into the game. The Chigorin is divided into four ECO classifications. In C96, Black or White deviate after 10.Bc2, and do not reach the classical main line position 10...c5 11.d4 Qc7. In C97, White proceeds from the diagram with 12.a4, 12.d5, 12.b4, or the main line 12.Nbd2 when Black responds with ...Be6, ...Rd8, ...Re8, ...Bb7 or ...Bd7. The C98 classification covers 12.Nbd2 Nc6, while C99 covers 12.Nbd2 cxd4 13.cxd4. Breyer Variation: 9.h3 Nb8  The Breyer Variation was recommended by Gyula Breyer as early as 1911,Barden (1963), pp. 15‚Äì16. but there are no known game records in which Breyer employed this line. The Breyer Variation did not become popular until the 1960s when it was adopted by Boris Spassky and others. In particular, Spassky's back to back wins over Mikhail Tal at Tbilisi in 1965 did much to enhance its reputation, and Spassky has a career-plus score with the Breyer. The variation was the choice of many top level players as White has had trouble proving an advantage against it. Nowadays however, this variation is considered too passive,and players prefer to play the Berlin or the Petroff as they seem to equalise more easily. With 9...Nb8 Black frees the c-pawn and intends to route the knight to d7 where it supports e5. If White fortifies the centre with 10.d3 the opening is classified ECO code C94. The more common continuation, 10.d4, is ECO C95. The main line continues 10.d4 Nbd7 11.Nbd2 Bb7 12.Bc2 Re8 13.Nf1 Bf8. Black is threatening to win the e4-pawn via ...exd4 uncovering an attack on the pawn, so White plays 14.Ng3. Black generally plays 14...g6 to stop White's knight from going to f5. White then usually tries to attack the Black queenside via 15.a4. Black seeks in the centre via 15...c5. White can attack either the kingside or the queenside. This forces resolution of the centre via 16.d5. Black can exploit the weak squares on the queenside via 16...c4. White will try to attack on the kingside via 17.Bg5, moving forces to the kingside. Black will kick the bishop with 17...h6. The logical retreat is 18.Be3, which is met by 18...Nc5. White plays 19.Qd2, forcing 19...h5. The point of this manoeuver was to weaken Black's kingside. Zaitsev Variation: 9.h3 Bb7  The Zaitsev Variation (also called the Flohr‚ÄìZaitsev Variation) was advocated by Igor Zaitsev, who was one of Karpov's trainers for many years. A Karpov favourite, the Zaitsev remains one of the most important variations of the Ruy Lopez. With 9...Bb7 Black prepares to put more pressure on e4 after 10.d4 Re8 11.Nbd2 Bf8, when play can become very sharp and tactical. One drawback of this line if Black is playing for a win is that White can force Black to choose a different defence or allow a draw by repetition of position with 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. Today the theory in the Zaitsev variations extends beyond the middlegame, and it is rarely seen at the top levels because of the need to remember a lot of theory. Karpov Variation: 9.h3 Nd7  Karpov tried 9...Nd7 several times in the 1990 World Championship match, but Kasparov achieved a significant advantage against it in the 18th game. It is solid but slightly passive. Confusingly 9...Nd7 is also called the Chigorin Variation so there are two variations of the Ruy Lopez with that name, but 9...Na5 is the move more commonly associated with Chigorin. This defence is also known as the Keres Variation, after Paul Keres. Kholmov Variation: 9.h3 Be6  The Kholmov Variation, 9...Be6, was popular in the 1980s but is now rarely played. The main line runs 10.d4 Bxb3 11.axb3 (11.Qxb3 is another option) exd4 12.cxd4 d5 13.e5 Ne4 14.Nc3 f5 15.exf6 Bxf6 16.Nxe4 dxe4 17.Rxe4 Qd5 18.Rg4, when it has been shown that White's extra pawn is more valuable than Black's more active and harmonised pieces. Smyslov Variation: 9.h3 h6  The Smyslov Variation (ECO C93) is a plan similar to that of the Zaitsev Variation. With 9...h6 Black prepares to play 10...Re8 and 11...Bf8 without fear of 10.Ng5. The loss of a tempo with 9...h6 gives White enough time to complete the Nbd2‚Äìf1‚Äìg3 manoeuver, and the pawn move can also weaken Black's kingside. The Zaitsev can be considered to be an improved Smyslov in which Black tries to save a tempo by omitting ...h6. Kasparov played the Smyslov Variation in a loss to the Deep Blue chess computer in Game 2 of their 1997 Man vs. Machine match. Svetozar Gligoriƒá has been the most prolific C93 player. Smyslov Variation: 9.h3 Qd7 9...Qd7 is another variation by Smyslov. Black defences other than 3...a6 Of the variations in this section, the Berlin and Schliemann Defences are the most popular today, followed by the Classical Defence. * 3...Nge7 (Cozio Defence) * 3...g6 (Smyslov Defence) * 3...Nd4 (Bird's Defence) * 3...d6 (Steinitz Defence) * 3...f5!? (Schliemann Defence) * 3...Bc5 (Classical or Cordel Defence) * 3...Nf6 (Berlin Defence) and other less-common third moves for Black. =Cozio Defence: 3...Nge7 = The Cozio Defence (part of ECO C60), 3...Nge7, is distinctly old-fashioned and the least popular of the defences at Black's third move. Although Bent Larsen used it occasionally with success, it remains one of the least explored variations of the Ruy Lopez. =Smyslov Defence: 3...g6 = The Smyslov Defence, Fianchetto Defence, Barnes Defence, or Pillsbury Defence (part of ECO C60), 3...g6, is a quiet positional system played occasionally by Vasily Smyslov and Boris Spassky, becoming popular in the 1980s when it was shown that 4.c3 a6! gives Black a good game. It was later discovered that 4.d4 exd4 5.Bg5 gives White the advantage, and as such the variation is rarely played today. An interesting gambit line 4.d4 exd4 5.c3 has also been recommended by Alexander Khalifman, although some of the resulting positions have yet to be extensively tested. =Bird's Defence: 3...Nd4 = Bird's Defence (ECO C61), 3...Nd4, is an uncommon variation in modern praxis. With careful play White is held to gain an advantage. The best moves are 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.0-0 Bc5 6.d3 c6 7.Ba4 Ne7. This defence was published in 1843 in Paul Rudolf von Bilguer's Handbuch des Schachspiels and explored by Henry Bird in the late 19th century. Bird played it as Black at least 25 times, scoring +9 =3 ‚àí13 (nine wins, three draws, thirteen losses).Bird Defence games played by Bird. ChessGames.com. Retrieved on 2009-01-29. Bird's Defence was later used a few times in tournament play by Siegbert Tarrasch, Boris Spassky, and Alexander Khalifman. Although it is still sometimes seen as a surprise weapon, no strong master since Bird has adopted it regularly.Shaw, John, Starting Out: The Ruy Lopez, p. 36. The World Champion Magnus Carlsen played it as black in the 2014 Chess Olympiad against Ivan ≈†ariƒá and lost. =Steinitz Defence: 3...d6 = The Steinitz Defence (also called the Old Steinitz Defence) (ECO C62), 3...d6, is solid but passive and cramped. Although the favourite of the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, and often played by world champions and expert defensive players Emanuel Lasker, Jos√© Capablanca, and occasionally by Vasily Smyslov, it largely fell into disuse after World War I, as its inherent passivity spurred a search for more active means of defending the Spanish. White's most direct approach is 4.d4 immediately challenging Black's pawn on e5, while 4.c3 and 4.0-0 remain viable alternatives. Following 4.d4, Black proceeds with 4...Bd7 which breaks the pin but also defends against White's threat of winning a pawn with 5.Bxc6 and 6.dxe5. Next White plays 5.Nc3 protecting e4 and renewing the threat of winning a pawn to which Black responds with 5...Nf6. After 6.0-0 Be7 7.Re1 Black is forced to concede the centre with 7...exd4, since 7...0-0? leads to the Tarrasch Trap. The Modern Steinitz Defense (3...a6 4.Ba4 d6) offers Black a freer position and is more popular. =Schliemann Defence: 3...f5 = The Schliemann Defence or Schliemann‚ÄìJaenisch Gambit (ECO C63), 3...f5!?, is a sharp line in which Black plays for a attack, frequently sacrificing one or two pawns. This variation was originated by Carl Jaenisch in 1847 and is sometimes named after him. Although later named for German lawyer Adolf Karl Wilhelm Schliemann (1817‚Äì1872), the line Schliemann actually played in the 1860s was a gambit variation of the Cordel Defence (3...Bc5 4.c3 f5). The most common responses for White to 3...f5!? are 4.d3 or 4.Nc3, with play after 4.Nc3 fxe4 5.Nxe4 going 5...d5, with great complications to follow, or 5...Nf6, which generally leads to quieter play. This line is considered to be a good practical weapon, but is positionally risky and bound to fail against a strong and prepared opponent. =Classical Defence: 3...Bc5 = The Classical Defence or Cordel Defence (ECO C64), 3...Bc5, is possibly the oldest defence to the Ruy Lopez, and has been played occasionally by former world champion Boris Spassky and Boris Gulko. White's most common reply is 4.c3, when Black may choose to play 4...f5, the Cordel Gambit, leading to sharp play, after which 5.d4 is considered the strongest reply. More solid for Black is 4...Nf6, when 5.0-0 0-0 6.d4 Bb6 leads to the Benelux Variation. White's principal alternative to 4.c3 is 4.0-0, when Black can transpose to the Classical Berlin with 4...Nf6 or play 4...Nd4, which is not so bad for Black. An alternative for White is the fork trick 4.Nxe5. Few games have been played with this line, but there is no clear refutation for Black. The name derives from White's play if Black captures the knight: 4...Nxe5 5.d4. =Berlin Defence: 3...Nf6 = The Berlin Defence, 3...Nf6, has long had a reputation for solidity and drawishness and is commonly referred to as \\"the Berlin Wall\\". The Berlin Defence was played in the late 19th century and early 20th century by Emanuel Lasker and others, who typically answered 4.0-0 with 4...d6 in the style of the Steinitz Defence. This approach ultimately fell out of favour, as had the old form of the Steinitz, due to its passivity, and the entire variation became rare. Arthur Bisguier played the Berlin for decades, but always chose the variation 4.0-0 Nxe4. Ever since Vladimir Kramnik successfully used the line as a against Garry Kasparov in their 2000 World Chess Championship match, the Berlin has experienced a remarkable renaissance: even players with a dynamic style such as Alexei Shirov, Veselin Topalov, Hikaru Nakamura, and Kasparov himself have tried it, and Magnus Carlsen and Viswanathan Anand both used it (Carlsen extensively so) during the 2013 World Chess Championship and 2014 World Chess Championship. Today this variation is the most common opening after 1.e4 e5 and almost all the top players regularly play it. Since Black's third move does not threaten to win the e-pawn‚Äîif Black captures it, White will win back the pawn on e5‚ÄîWhite usually castles. After 4.0-0, Black can play either the solid 4...Nxe4 (the Berlin Main Variation) or the more combative 4...Bc5 (the Berlin Classical Variation). After 4...Nxe4 5.d4 Nd6 (5...Be7 is the Rio de Janeiro Variation, while 5...a6 transposes into the open Spanish after 6.Ba4, although white could play 6.Bxc6 to stay within Berlin territory) 6.Bxc6 dxc6 7.dxe5 Nf5 8.Qxd8+ Kxd8 (l'Hermet Variation), White is considered to have a small advantage from a somewhat better pawn structure and Black's awkwardly placed king. Black, by way of compensation, possesses the and has no positional weaknesses, so it is difficult for White to exploit the structural superiority without opening the game for Black's bishops; all four of the games in the Kasparov‚ÄìKramnik match in which this line was employed ended in draws. An alternative for Black, though seldom seen since the 1890s, is 6...bxc6 7.dxe5 Nb7, although White keeps an advantage despite Black's two bishops, as it is difficult for him to gain active . However, despite its drawish tendency, the Berlin Endgame remains the sternest test of the entire variation beginning with 3...Nf6, and a lot of theory has evolved here. Today's consensus is that Black will hold with accurate play in the Berlin Endgame, so players have moved on to the lines with 4.0-0 Nxe4 5.Re1, the modern main line, considered to be White's best try for an opening advantage, and advocated by Fabiano Caruana in his Chessbase Series on the Ruy Lopez opening. White's move 4.Nc3 transposes to the Four Knights Game, Spanish Variation. An important alternative is 4.d3, dubbed the Anti-Berlin, which avoids the notorious Berlin endgame. Wilhelm Steinitz scored many spectacular successes with it during his reign as World Champion.Horowitz and Reinfeld 1954, p. 59. The main replies for Black are 4...d6 and 4...Bc5, the latter being more popular. White's most important continuations after 4...Bc5 are 5.0-0, 5.Bxc6, and 5.c3. An uncommon reply to 4.d3 is 4...Ne7, which tries to set up the Mortimer Trap. Another alternative is playing 4.Bxc6 immediately. The main replies for Black are 4...dxc6 and 4...bxc6, the latter of which is playable in the Berlin Defense, unlike the Exchange Variation in the Morphy Defense. This may transpose into the Anti-Berlin above if White continues with 5.d3, or in the case of 4...bxc6, to the main line with 5.0-0 Nxe4 or 5.d4 Nxe4, but White has other continuations to 4...bxc6, such as 5.Nc3, and Black has other replies to both 5.0-0 and 5.d4. The Berlin is assigned ECO codes C65‚ÄìC67. Code C65 covers alternatives to 4.0-0, including 4.d3 as well as 4.0-0 Bc5. Code C66 covers 4.0-0 d6, while C67 is 4.0-0 Nxe4. =Other= Less-common third moves for Black: * 3...Bb4 (Alapin Defence) * 3...Qf6 (Gunderam Variation) * 3...f6 (Nuremberg Defence) * 3...Qe7 (Vinogradov Variation) * 3...Na5 (Pollock's Defence) * 3...g5 (Brentano Defence) * 3...Bd6 * 3...b6?

The park was established on September 25, 1890 to protect of forested mountainous terrain. Encompassing a vertical relief of nearly , the park contains the highest point in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney, at above sea level. The park is south of, and contiguous with, Kings Canyon National Park; both parks are administered by the National Park Service together as the Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. UNESCO designated the areas as Sequoia-Kings Canyon Biosphere Reserve in 1976. The park is notable for its giant sequoia trees, including the General Sherman tree, the largest tree on Earth by volume. The General Sherman tree grows in the Giant Forest, which contains five of the ten largest trees in the world. The Giant Forest is connected by the Generals Highway to Kings Canyon National Park's General Grant Grove, home of the General Grant tree among other giant sequoias. The park's giant sequoia forests are part of of old-growth forests shared by Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks. The parks preserve a landscape that still resembles the southern Sierra Nevada before Euro-American settlement. The national park was partially closed in September 2020 due to the Sequoia Complex wildfire. Front country Many park visitors enter Sequoia National Park through its southern entrance near the town of Three Rivers at Ash Mountain at elevation. The lower elevations around Ash Mountain contain the only National Park Service-protected California Foothills ecosystem, consisting of blue oak woodlands, foothills chaparral, grasslands, yucca plants, and steep, mild river valleys. The region is also home to abundant wildlife: bobcats, foxes, ground squirrels, rattlesnakes, and mule deer are commonly seen in this area, and more rarely, reclusive mountain lions and the Pacific fisher are seen as well. The last California grizzly was killed in this park in 1922 (at Horse Corral Meadow). The California Black Oak is a key transition species between the chaparral and higher elevation conifer forest. At higher elevations in the front country, between in elevation, the landscape becomes montane forest-dominated coniferous belt. Found here are Ponderosa, Jeffrey, sugar, and lodgepole pine trees, as well as abundant white and red fir. Found here too are the giant sequoia trees, the most massive living single-stem trees on earth. Between the trees, spring and summer snowmelts sometimes fan out to form lush, though delicate, meadows. In this region, visitors often see mule deer, Douglas squirrels, and American black bears, which sometimes break into unattended cars to eat food left by careless visitors. There are plans to reintroduce the bighorn sheep to this park. Back country The High Sierra Trail above Hamilton Lake passes over the Great Western Divide The vast majority of the park is roadless wilderness; no road crosses the Sierra Nevada within the park's boundaries. 84 percent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks is designated wilderness and is accessible only by foot or by horseback. The majority was designated Sequoia-Kings Canyon Wilderness in 1984 and the southwest portion was protected as John Krebs Wilderness in 2009. Sequoia's backcountry offers a vast expanse of high-alpine wonders. Covering the highest-elevation region of the High Sierra, the backcountry includes Mount Whitney on the eastern border of the park, accessible from the Giant Forest via the High Sierra Trail. On a traveler's path along this backcountry trail, one passes through about of montane forest before reaching the backcountry resort of Bearpaw Meadow, just short of the Great Western Divide. Continuing along the High Sierra Trail over the Great Western Divide via Kaweah Gap, one passes from the Kaweah River Drainage, with its characteristic V-shaped river valleys, and into the Kern River drainage, where an ancient fault line has aided glaciers in the last ice age to create a U-shaped canyon that is almost perfectly straight for nearly . On the floor of this canyon, at least two days hike from the nearest road, is the Kern Canyon hot spring, a popular resting point for weary backpackers. From the floor of Kern Canyon, the trail ascends again over to the summit of Mount Whitney. At Mount Whitney, the High Sierra Trail meets with the John Muir Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail, which continue northward along the Sierra crest and into the backcountry of Kings Canyon National Park. Human history The area which now comprises Sequoia National Park was first home to \\"Monachee\\" (Western Mono) Native Americans, who resided mainly in the Kaweah River drainage in the Foothills region of the park, though evidence of seasonal habitation exists as high as the Giant Forest. In the summertime, Native Americans would travel over the high mountain passes to trade with tribes to the East. To this day, pictographs can be found at several sites within the park, notably at Hospital Rock and Potwisha, as well as bedrock mortars used to process acorns, a staple food for the Monachee people. Tharp's Log, a cabin formed out of a hollowed-out giant sequoia log By the time the first European settlers arrived in the area, smallpox had already spread to the region, decimating Native American populations. The first European settler to homestead in the area was Hale Tharp, who famously built a home out of a hollowed-out fallen giant sequoia log in the Giant Forest next to Log Meadow. Tharp allowed his cattle to graze the meadow, but at the same time had a respect for the grandeur of the forest and led early battles against logging in the area. From time to time, Tharp received visits from John Muir, who would stay at Tharp's log cabin. Tharp's Log can still be visited today in its original location in the Giant Forest. However, Tharp's attempts to conserve the giant sequoias were at first met with only limited success. In the 1880s, white settlers seeking to create a utopian society founded the Kaweah Colony, which sought economic success in trading Sequoia timber. However, Giant Sequoia trees, unlike their coast redwood relatives, were later discovered to splinter easily and therefore were ill-suited to timber harvesting, though thousands of trees were felled before logging operations finally ceased. The National Park Service incorporated the Giant Forest into Sequoia National Park in 1890, the year of its founding, promptly ceasing all logging operations in the Giant Forest. The park has expanded several times over the decades to its present size; one of the most recent expansions occurred in 1978, when grassroots efforts, spearheaded by the Sierra Club, fought off attempts by the Walt Disney Corporation to purchase a high-alpine former mining site south of the park for use as a ski resort. This site known as Mineral King was annexed to the park. Its name dates back to early 1873 when the miners in the area formed the Mineral King Mining District. Mineral King is the highest-elevation developed site within the park and a popular destination for backpackers. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Sequoia National Park encompasses five climate types listed here from highest to lowest elevation; Tundra (ET), Mediterranean-influenced Subarctic climate (Dsc), Mediterranean-influenced warm-summer Humid continental climate (Dsb), Warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb), and Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Giant Forest Visitor Center () is 8a with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of . Geology Sequoia National Park contains a significant portion of the Sierra Nevada. The park's mountainous landscape includes the tallest mountain in the contiguous United States, Mount Whitney, which rises to above sea level. The Great Western Divide parallels the Sierran crest and is visible at various places in the park, for example, Mineral King, Moro Rock, and the Giant Forest. Peaks in the Great Western Divide rise to more than . Deep canyons lie between the mountains, including Tokopah Valley above Lodgepole, Deep Canyon on the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, and Kern Canyon in the park's backcountry, which is more than deep for . Great Western Divide from the summit of Mount Kaweah Most of the mountains and canyons in the Sierra Nevada are composed of granitic rocks. These rocks, such as granite, diorite and monzonite, formed when molten rock cooled far beneath the surface of the earth. The molten rock was the result of a geologic process known as subduction. Powerful forces in the earth forced the landmass under the waters of the Pacific Ocean beneath and below an advancing North American Continent. Super-hot water driven from the subducting ocean floor migrated upward and melted rock as it proceeded. This process took place during the Cretaceous Period, 100 million years ago. Granitic rocks have a speckled salt-and-pepper appearance because they contain various minerals including quartz, feldspars and micas. Valhalla, or the Angel Wings, are prominent granitic cliffs that rise above the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River. The Sierra Nevada is a young mountain range, probably not more than 10 million years old. Forces in the earth, probably associated with the development of the Great Basin, forced the mountains to rise. During the last 10 million years, at least four ice ages have coated the mountains in a thick mantle of ice. Glaciers form and develop during long periods of cool and wet weather. Glaciers move very slowly through the mountains, carving deep valleys and craggy peaks. The extensive history of glaciation within the range and the erosion resistant nature of the granitic rocks that make up most of the Sierra Nevada have together created a landscape of hanging valleys, waterfalls, craggy peaks, alpine lakes and glacial canyons. Crystal Cave Park caves, like most caves in the Sierra Nevada of California, are mostly solutional caves dissolved from marble. Marble rock is essentially limestone that was metamorphosed by the heat and pressure of the formation and uplift of the Sierra Nevada Batholith. The batholith's rapid uplift over the past 10 million years led to a rapid erosion of the metamorphic rocks in the higher elevations, exposing the granite beneath; therefore, most Sierra Nevada caves are found in the middle and lower elevations (below ), though some caves are found in the park at elevations as high as such as the White Chief cave and Cirque Cave in Mineral King. These caves are carved out of the rock by the abundant seasonal streams in the park. Most of the larger park caves have, or have had, sinking streams running through them. The park contains more than 270 known caves, including Lilburn Cave which is California's longest cave with nearly of surveyed passages. The only commercial cave open to park visitors is Crystal Cave, the park's second-longest cave at over . Crystal Cave was discovered on April 28, 1918 by Alex Medley and Cassius Webster. The cave is a constant , and is only accessible by guided tour. Caves are discovered every year in the park with the most recently discovered major cave being Ursa Minor in August 2006. Flora and Fauna According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Sequoia National Park encompasses five classifications listed here from highest to lowest elevation; Alpine tundra & barren vegetation type with an Alpine tundra vegetation form...Pinus contorta/ Subalpine zone vegetation type with a California Conifer Forest vegetation form...Abies magnifica vegetation type with a California Conifer Forest vegetation form...Mixed conifer vegetation type with a California Conifer Forest vegetation form...and Chaparral vegetation type with a California chaparral and woodlands vegetation form. Animals that inhabit this park are coyote, badger, black bear, bighorn sheep, deer, fox, cougar, eleven species of woodpecker, various species of turtle, three species of owl, opossum, various species of snake, wolverine, beaver, various species of frog, and muskrat. Park attractions Tunnel Tree in 1940 Crescent Meadow in the Giant Forest, called the \\"Gem of the Sierra\\" by John Muir In addition to hiking, camping, fishing, and backpacking, the following attractions are highlights with many park visitors: *Sherman Tree Trail An 0.8-mile roundtrip paved trail that descends from the parking lot to the base of the General Sherman tree and meanders through a grove of giant sequoia trees. *Tunnel Log is a fallen giant sequoia tree in Sequoia National Park. The tree, which measured tall and in diameter, fell across a park road in 1937 due to natural causes. The following year, a crew cut an tall, wide tunnel through the trunk, making the road passable again. *Tokopah Falls The trail to Tokopah Falls starts just beyond the Marble Fork Bridge in Lodgepole Campground. It is an easy 1.7 mile (one way) walk along the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River to the impressive granite cliffs and waterfall of Tokopah Canyon. Tokopah Falls is 1,200 feet (365.8 meters) high, and is most impressive in early summer. *Crescent Meadow is a small, sequoia-rimmed meadow in the Giant Forest region of Sequoia National Park. This sierran montane meadow marks the western terminus of the High Sierra Trail, which stretches from the meadow across the Great Western Divide to Mount Whitney. Pioneer Hale Tharp homesteaded in this and nearby Log Meadow. Conservationist John Muir visited this meadow many times and praised it highly calling it the \\"Gem of the Sierra\\". The meadow lies at the end of a three-mile paved road which leaves the Generals Highway near the Giant Forest Museum. *Moro Rock is a granite dome located in the center of the park, at the head of Moro Creek, between Giant Forest and Crescent Meadow. A 351-step stairway, built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps, is cut into and poured onto the rock, so that visitors can hike to the top. The stairway is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The view from the rock encompasses much of the Park, including the Great Western Divide. It has an elevation of . * Campgrounds in the park include three in the foothills area: Potwisha (42 sites), Buckeye Flat (28 sites), and South Fork (10 sites). Four campgrounds are at higher, conifer- dominated elevations, ranging from : Atwell Mill (21 sites), Cold Springs (40 sites), Lodgepole (214 sites), and Dorst Creek (204 sites). * Giant Forest Museum offers information about giant sequoias and human history in the forest. The historic museum was built in 1928 by architect Gilbert Stanley Underwood.

Cast * Carl Brisson - Pete Quilliam * Malcolm Keen - Philip Christian * Anny Ondra - Kate Cregeen * Randle Ayrton - Caesar Cregeen * Clare Greet - Mother (as Claire Greet) * Harry Terry - Man (uncredited) * Kim Peacock - Ross Christian (uncredited) * Wilfred Shine - Doctor (uncredited) * Nellie Richards - Wardress (uncredited) Plot The film tells the story of two close childhood friends, a handsome but poor fisherman, Pete Quilliam (Carl Brisson), and a well-educated middle-class lawyer, Philip Christian (Malcolm Keen); Both the young men are smitten with beautiful and lively Kate (Anny Ondra), the pub owner's daughter. In Pete's case, Kate is also interested in him, or at least she enjoys having him as a suitor. Pete proposes, asking Philip to make the case to Kate's dour father, Caesar Cregeen (Randle Ayrton). Cregeen refuses to consent to the marriage, because Pete is penniless. Pete decides to go to Africa to make his fortune, so he will be considered eligible to marry her, and he asks Kate if she will wait for him to return. At first she jokes around, but finally she says yes. Pete then asks Philip to take care of Kate until he returns. In his absence, Philip starts calling on Kate almost every day. Kate and Philip become strongly attracted to one another, and start an affair while visiting an old mill. News reaches the village that Pete has been killed in Africa. Philip and Kate are shocked but Kate is relieved to realize that they can now plan their lives together. Philip's career has been going well, and he is preparing to assume the powerful position of Deemster, the island's chief magistrate. However, it then turns out that a dead man was misidentified as Pete, who is still alive and prospering in Africa. He lets Philip know via telegram that he is returning. Philip urges Kate not to break her promise to marry Pete, allowing him to continue with his career. Pete arrives shortly after the telegram and is extremely happy to be back to his village and see his old sweetheart. Old Caesar is now delighted to agree to Kate marrying Pete. The wedding reception is celebrated in the old mill, where Old Caesar sternly warns the newlyweds to remember that God will punish anyone who violates the vows of marriage. Kate is still in love with Philip, and can hardly bear to be married to Pete. As the weeks pass, Pete is thrilled to find out that Kate is pregnant, and he naturally assumes he is the father. When Kate's daughter is born, Kate is desperate and decides to leave Pete. She walks out, leaving her baby behind, and a note saying that she had loved another man, and still loves him. Pete is deeply hurt by this, but puts on a brave face and tells the villagers that Kate has gone to London for a short rest. During the weeks she is gone, Pete proves himself to be a wonderful father, taking care of the baby very well, and comforting himself by believing that although Kate has gone, he still has their baby to love. Kate persuades Philip to hide her at his law offices, hoping she can still somehow have a life with him. However, Philip is about to become the Deemster, and he is unwilling to ruin his career by running off with her. Frustrated and distraught, Kate returns to the house to take the baby. She tells Pete he is not the baby's father. Pete is stunned and refuses to believe her. He also refuses to give up the child. In desperation, Kate leaves the house and tries to commit suicide by throwing herself off the quay, but is rescued by a policeman. Attempted suicide is classified as a crime, and Kate is brought to trial on the first day that Philip serves as Deemster. Now Philip is stunned and hardly knows what to do. When Pete appears in the courtroom to plead for his wife, Philip agrees to hand Kate over to him. But Kate refuses to go. Kate's father, Old Caesar, who is watching carefully, finally understands that Kate and Philip had an affair. Philip publicly admits his extreme moral failings. He removes his wig and surrenders his official position, and then leaves the court. In the final scene, Philip and Kate arrive at Pete's house to take away the baby. Kate picks up the child, while Philip and Pete stand at opposite ends of the room. She brings the child over to Pete to say one last goodbye, and he breaks down. Philip and Kate leave the cottage to the jeers and condemnation of the villagers, who have been watching the scene through the windows. Having lost everything, Pete sets sail again. Production The Manxman began filming on the Isle of Man, but Hitchcock eventually relocated production to Polperro, Cornwall due to frequent creative interference from author Hall Caine, who lived on the Isle of Man. Other scenes were shot at British International Pictures' Elstree Studios, to which Caine was invited to observe. The director began work on the film just two weeks after the birth of his daughter, Patricia Hitchcock. After being thought in the public domain for decades, the film's rights were obtained by French media company Canal+ in 2005. A restored and remastered print of the film was released on DVD by Lionsgate Home Entertainment in 2007. Preservation and home video status A restoration of The Manxman was completed in 2012 as part of the BFI's ¬£2 million \\"Save the Hitchcock 9\\" project to restore all of the director's surviving silent films. Like Hitchcock's other British films, all of which are copyrighted worldwide, The Manxman has been heavily bootlegged on home video.

An able and gifted statesman, his caustic temper and belief in absolute monarchy nevertheless made him numerous enemies. He was forced to flee England in 1688, but later established himself with the new regime after the Revolution of that year. Subsequently, he took on a more disinterested role as an adviser to the Crown, seeking neither office nor favour. He evinced no party loyalty, but was devoted to his country's interests, as he saw them. By the notoriously lax standards of the Restoration Court, his private life was remarkably free from scandal, which won him favour in the more sober post-Revolution state.Kenyon p. 8 Life =Early life= Robert Spencer was born in Paris in 1641. His father was Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland, who was killed at the First Battle of Newbury, and his mother was the Lady Dorothy Sidney, daughter of Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester. At the age of three he inherited his father's dignities, becoming Baron of Wormleighton and Earl of Sunderland.Kenyon p. 3 Lady Spencer had him educated after his father's death, first engaging a Calvinist tutor for him, Dr Thomas Pierce, and afterwards sending him to Christ Church, Oxford. After quitting school he joined the British Army, rising to the rank of captain in Prince Rupert's Regiment of Horse. On 10 June 1665 he was married to Anne Digby. She was the daughter of the second Earl of Bristol, and died in 1715.Kenyon p. 8 Sunderland then served successively as ambassador to Madrid (1671‚Äì1672), Paris (1672‚Äì1673), and the United Provinces (1673). He was Gentleman of the Bedchamber from 1673 to 1679, before being invested a Privy Councillor and appointed Secretary of State for the Northern Department in 1679. At the same time he served as Ambassador Extraordinary to Paris.Kenyon p. 23 His political skills and energetic character rapidly marked him as a rising man: even Bishop Burnet, who disliked him, praised his statesmanship and his \\"quick and ready apprehension, and swift decision of business\\".Burnet p. 129 He was accused by some of seeking and clinging to office simply for the salary, to support his reportedly extravagant lifestyle.Burnet p. 129 Despite his otherwise blameless life he had a weakness for gambling, which often involved him in debt,Burnet p. 129 and a passion for Art. He was a collector of paintings, and made extensive alterations to Althorp,Kenyon pp. 9‚Äì10 but his private life was sober, and he was personally inexpensive. =Career under Charles II and James II= Sunderland's professed mission was to aggrandise England in the European community, and to strengthen her diplomatic ties with the other rivals of French power. He laboured from 1679 to 1681 to conjoin an alliance against France, but apart from a treaty with Spain in 1680, little came of it. Sunderland's relations with Paul Barillon, whose long tenure as Ambassador from Louis XIV (from 1677 to 1688) produced many memorable exchanges between the twain, were tenuous and strained. When Louis failed to give James any assistance against the Monmouth Rebellion of 1685, Sunderland told Barillon sharply \\"the King your master may have plans I cannot discern, but I hope he will put things right by making it clear that this has all been a misunderstanding\\".Kenyon p. 118 When Barillon protested that his master's aim was \\"the Peace of Europe\\" Sunderland said that it was impossible for everyone in Europe to want peace at the same time: \\"myself I think it will last until one side or the other has a good reason for breaking it\\".Kenyon p. 119 To prevent Barillon from gaining too much influence, Sunderland intercepted and leaked an unusually indiscreet dispatch where the Ambassador boasted of having blocked an Anglo-Dutch treaty. Charles II was predictably furious, and Barillon was for a time forbidden the Court. Sunderland remarked that if Barillon would behave himself so, it was \\"but just that it come home to him\\".Kenyon p. 40 Lord Sunderland also served as Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire during the minority of Lord Shrewsbury until 1681. That year, he was dismissed by Charles II, due to his opposition of the Duke of York's succession; Charles was outraged by Sunderland's vote for the Exclusion Bill, which he described as \\"the Kiss of Judas\\".Kenyon p. 66 Presently Sunderland regained the King's confidence (through the principal royal mistress, the Duchess of Portsmouth). Intermittently, between 1682 and 1688, he served as Secretary of State for the Southern Department, Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire, and Lord President of the Council; in 1687, he signed the King's grant of religious freedom for the Brenttown (Brenton) tract in Prince William County, Virginia, to encourage settlement of French Protestants. The same year he openly embraced the Roman Catholic faith, insincerely, it would seem, and merely to please the King. Later that year he was made a Knight of the Garter. However, while he enjoyed the confidence of Queen Mary of Modena, it was clear that he was growing uncomfortable under the recently enthroned James: the violently hostile reception he got from the public when he gave evidence at the Trial of the Seven Bishops left him badly shaken. When he urged James to put away his mistress Catherine Sedley, Countess of Dorchester, James said that he had not realised Sunderland was his confessor, and told him to mind his own business for the future. Sunderland's unpopularity was now almost universal: Burnet wrote that it was \\"the wonder of all mankind\\" that James continued to employ him.Burnet p. 222 He was summarily dismissed at last in October 1688, with the remark, \\"You have your pardon; much good doe it you. I hope you will be more faithful to your next master than you have been to me.\\"Kenyon p. 226 =Career under William III= Sunderland escaped in disguise to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, where he lay low for some time, before being officially arrested, and immediately released, by the Dutch authorities. Offering his service to the Prince of Orange, he moved on to Utrecht, where he remained quietly for the duration of the upheavals in England, when William III and Mary II took the throne. Afterwards he wrote to Sir John Churchill, a prominent English statesman, asking him to \\"make things easy for a man in my condition\\". Despite his notorious rudeness and bad temper, Sunderland had a surprising ability to make lasting friendships, and some of his friends, including John Evelyn and Thomas Tenison, had influence with the new r√©gime. His sister Dorothy had married George Savile, 1st Marquess of Halifax, a key adviser to William III in the early years of his reign, and though he and Sunderland had never been close, Halifax felt obliged from family solidarity to make a plea on Sunderland's behalf.Kenyon p. 228 At first, William III excepted Sunderland from the Indemnity Act of 23 May 1690, but he was allowed to return to the country early the next year. At the same time, he had been excepted from James' 1692 Instrument of Pardon. Sunderland in Classical Dress, by Carlo Maratta On his return, Sunderland formally reverted to Anglicanism, taking the oaths in April 1691 and quietly recommenced sitting in the House of Lords. In May William paid a visit to him at his home in Althorp, Northamptonshire, to discuss public affairs. Over the next years the King frequently visited him and gave him confidence, but Sunderland did not dare to fully enter public life until September 1693, when he took a house in the city. He repeatedly advised the King to select all of his ministers from one political party, and eventually effected a reconciliation between William and his sister-in-law, the later Queen Anne. He was an influential adviser, inducing William to accept only Whigs in his government. William, never vindictive, was untroubled by Sunderland's past services to James, who had made it very clear that Sunderland was the one man he would never forgive, though he had made tentative advances towards the fallen King. Most of William's servants had at sometime betrayed him, and he valued Sunderland for his frankness and ability to voice unwelcome truths. It has been suggested that Sunderland's notorious rudeness actually appealed to the King, who detested flattery and could himself be distinctly rude.Kenyon, J.P. The Stuarts 1966 (Fontana ed.) p. 174 Once when William said that, while the Whigs personally liked him better than the Tories, the Tories were better friends to Monarchy, Sunderland shrewdly replied: \\"but you must consider that you are not their Monarch\\". He even wrote a letter telling the King that if his Ministers were not fit for his service, it was his own fault for not choosing better men.Kenyon p. 317 This notable lack of ordinary good manners made Sunderland countless enemies: Bishop Burnet wrote that \\"he had too much heat, both of imagination and of passion, was apt to speak freely both of persons and things, and raised himself many enemies from a contemptuous treatment of those who differed from him\\".Burnet p. 129 His remarkable ability to adapt to the wishes of three different monarchs was considered a fault rather than a virtue: as Burnet observed \\"he came by this to lose so much that even those who esteemed his parts depended little on his probity\\".Burnet p. 129 While his own private life was blameless, Sunderland in the winter of 1697‚Äì98 became involved in scandal when his daughter Elizabeth's husband, Lord Clancarty, a leading Jacobite, escaped from the Tower of London. The marriage had been arranged between Sunderland and Clancarty's uncle Justin McCarthy, Viscount Mountcashel, when the young bride was but thirteen and her husband only three years older; it had proved a disaster which greatly damaged Sunderland's reputation.Burnet p. 216 Clancarty escaped and found Elizabeth, whom he had not seen since 1684, persuading her to consummate the marriage at long last. Unfortunately, the servants alerted her brother Charles, who had Clancarty arrested. The resulting furore gravely embarrassed Sunderland, but seems to have merely amused the King, who dryly remarked that no-one wanted to speak to him of anything but \\"that little spark Clancarty\\". He gave the couple permission to move to Germany, where they settled in Altona, Hamburg, and there they lived out their lives. Elizabeth never saw her parents or her brother again.Kenyon p. 302 Sunderland became Lord Chamberlain of the Household in April 1697, and was a Lord Justice for a short period, but \\"the general suspicion with which he was regarded terrified him\\". At the same time he was approaching sixty, a respectable age in those days, and besides his health was failing. He eventually retired from public life in December 1697. Sunderland died in 1702. He had led a secluded life at Althorp for some time, and his only surviving son, Charles, succeeded to his titles and honours.Kenyon p. 328 Family Anne, Countess of Sunderland He married Anne Digby, daughter of George Digby, 2nd Earl of Bristol, on 9 June 1665. After an awkward start, when Sunderland broke off the engagement for no known reason,Diary of Samuel Pepys 1 July 1663 the marriage was a very happy one: Lady Sunderland was rumoured to have had numerous lovers, but there is little evidence to support this, and Sunderland, despite his questionable political principles, was a devoted husband and father. They had at least five children.Kenyon p. 8 *Robert Spencer (1666‚Äì1688). *Anne Spencer (1667‚Äì1690), married James Douglas, 4th Duke of Hamilton. *Isabella Spencer (1668‚Äì1684). *Elizabeth Spencer (1671‚Äì1704), married Donough MacCarthy, 4th Earl of Clancarty. *Charles Spencer (c. 1674‚Äì1722), succeeded as 3rd Earl of Sunderland.

The anthem was composed by Bonifacio J. Linay, a native of Cavinti.  History  The municipality of Cavinti was originally a part of Lumban, Laguna. It was only in 1619 when the town gained complete and independent status as a parish by virtue of a papal bull believed to have come directly from Rome. In fact, this was why, again according to the legends, the two Puhawan brothers of Lumban, in search of food in early 1600, reached Cavinti where they found an image which turned out to be that of El Salvador. They brought the image to their home in Lumban. But in no time, it got lost only to be found again the very same place where it was first discovered. Today on that hallowed grounds stands majestically the centuries-old Catholic Church in honor of El Salvador built by the town's forebears for all the generations to enjoy and cherish. The church's early structures were made of light materials. For many times they had to rebuild it on account of destruction wrought by natural calamities such as earthquakes, typhoons, and fires.

Retrieved on 01-12-17. = The American Period = Cavinti became one of the municipalities with high insurgency due to the construction of hydropower dam where several lands were submerged. Two connected man-made lakes (Lake Lumot and Lake Caliraya) were built by American engineers in 1943 to supply water to the Caliraya Hydroelectric Plant. As the dams were constructed, entrepreneurs with foresight created two adjacent communities which were envisioned to be ecological communities, where one can enjoy the beauty and richness of unspoiled nature. The results were man-made mountain lakes complete with coves and sandbars - Lake Caliraya and Lake Lumot. The Americans also seeded the lake with Largemouth Black Bass imported from the US, which continues to proliferate and provide game fishers with year-round weekend excitement. In fact, the two lakes are some of the places in the whole country where Philippine anglers can attempt to catch the famed Largemouth Black Bass, one of the top freshwater gamefish of the United States of America.

The column is now called 3am and is edited by Clemmie Moodie with Ashleigh Rainbird. In 2009, an online version of the column appeared, edited by Dominic Mohan's sister Isabel. Their tabloid counterparts are The Goss Girls for the Daily Star and Dan Wootton who edits The Sun's Bizarre column. Rivalry with Chris Moyles In September 2004, BBC Radio 1 DJ Chris Moyles highlighted the made-up news stories and quotes on his then-afternoon music and chat show. The following day Moyles's mobile phone number was printed in the paper as a retaliation. Moyles called for the 3AM girls to resign, and several thousand of Moyles's listeners rang in to the Daily Mirror to complain. The Mirror asked Moyles to call off his listeners, which he did, claiming he had won the battle by doing this. Fictitious quotations In 2007 Private Eye reported former 3AM girl Jessica Callan as saying that quotes for interviewees were made up by journalists: \\"The conversations celebrities had with us often bore no relation to the words which were printed in the column.

Garner's first novel, Monkey Grip, published in 1977, immediately established her as an original voice on the Australian literary scene-it is now widely considered a classic. She has a reputation for incorporating and adapting her personal experiences in her fiction, something that has brought her widespread attention, particularly with her novels, Monkey Grip and The Spare Room (2008). Throughout her career, Garner has written both fiction and non-fiction. She attracted controversy with her book The First Stone (1995) about a sexual-harassment scandal in a university college. She has also written for film and theatre, and has consistently won awards for her work, including the Walkley Award for a 1993 Time Magazine report. Adaptations of two of her works have appeared as feature films: her debut novel Monkey Grip and her true-crime book Joe Cinque's Consolation (2004) ‚Äì the former released in 1982 and the latter in 2016. Garner's works have covered a broad range of themes and subject matter. She has thrice written true-crime books: first with The First Stone, about the aftermath of a sexual-harassment scandal at a university, followed by Joe Cinque's Consolation, a journalistic novel about the court proceedings involving a young man who died at the hands of his girlfriend, which won the Ned Kelly Award for Best Crime Book, and again in 2014 with This House of Grief, about Robert Farquharson, a man who drove his children into a dam. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) site has characterised her as one of Australia's \\"most important and admired writers\\", while The Guardian referred to her as \\"Australia's greatest living writer\\". Early life Janet Clarke Hall, where Garner resided in the 1960s as a student of the University of Melbourne Garner was born Helen Ford to Bruce and Gwen Ford (n√©e Gadsden) in Geelong, Victoria, the eldest of six children.Goldsworthy (1996) p. ix Her sister Catherine Ford is also a writer of fiction. Garner described her upbringing as being in an \\"ordinary Australian home - not many books and not much talk\\". Garner attended Manifold Heights State School, Ocean Grove State School and then The Hermitage in Geelong, where she was the head prefect and dux. She left Geelong after her high school graduation at the age of 18 to study at the University of Melbourne,Wyndham (2006) residing at Janet Clarke Hall,Garner (1995) p. 164 and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree with majors in English and French. One of her teachers at the University of Melbourne was the poet Vincent Buckley. Between 1966 and 1972, Garner worked as a teacher at various Victorian high schools. In 1967, she also travelled overseas and met Bill Garner, whom she married in 1968 on their return to Australia, aged 25. Her only child, the actor, musician and writer Alice Garner, was born in 1969. Garner's first marriage ended in 1971. In 1972, Garner was sacked by the Victorian Department of Education for \\"giving an unscheduled sex education lesson to her 13-year-old students at Fitzroy High School\\". She had written an essay about the lesson and published it under a pen name in The Digger, a countercultural Melbourne-based magazine. Although the October 1972 article was considered \\"unsolicited\\", Garner wrote that she had intended to give a lesson on Ancient Greece, but the textbooks given to her students had been defaced with sexually explicit drawings. As a result of those drawings, the class had posed questions to Garner relating to sex, and she decided to allow an uninhibited discussion based around their questions which, as their teacher, she vowed to answer accurately. When her identity was revealed, she was called into the Victorian Department of Education and dismissed. The case was widely publicised in Melbourne, bringing Garner a degree of notoriety. Members of the Victorian Secondary Teachers Association went on strike in protest at the Deputy Director of Secondary Education's decision to fire Garner. Aside from her writing for The Digger, she also wrote articles for the Melbourne feminist newspaper Vashti's Voice. Garner appeared in the 1975 independent film Pure Shit, which focuses on four drug addicts searching for heroin in Melbourne. Career =Early career and fiction writing= Garner came to prominence at a time when Australian writers were relatively few in number, and Australian women writers were, by some, considered a novelty. Australian academic and writer, Kerryn Goldsworthy, writes that \\"From the beginning of her writing career Garner was regarded as, and frequently called, a stylist, a realist, and a feminist\\".Goldsworthy (1996) p. 1 Latrobe Reading Room of the State Library of Victoria in the mid 1970s. Her first novel, Monkey Grip (1977), relates the lives of a group of fledgeling artists, single parents, drug addicts and welfare recipients living in Melbourne share-houses. In particular focus is the increasingly co- dependent relationship between single-mother Nora and Javo, a flaky junkie who Nora is in love with, despite him repeatedly drifting in and out of her life. The novel, set in inner-city Melbourne suburbs Fitzroy and Carlton, was written in the domed Reading Room at the State Library of Victoria, after Garner's teaching dismissal. Years later she stated that she had adapted it directly from her personal diaries and based the relationship between Nora and Javo on a relationship she had with a man at the time. Other peripheral characters in the book were based on people in Garner's own social circle from Melbourne share-houses. Monkey Grip was very successful: it won the National Book Council Award in 1978 and was adapted into a film in 1982. Goldsworthy suggests that the success of Monkey Grip may well have helped revive the careers of two older but largely ignored Australian women writers, Jessica Anderson and Thea Astley.Goldsworthy (1996) p. 14 Thea Astley wrote of the novel that \\"I am filled with envy by someone like Helen Garner for instance. I re-read Monkey Grip a while ago and it's even better second time through\\".Goldsworthy (1996) p. 15 Critics have retrospectively applied the term Grunge Lit to describe Monkey Grip, citing its depiction of urban life and social realism as being key aspects of later works in the subgenre.Vernay, Jean-Fran√ßois, \\"Grunge Fiction\\", The Literary Encyclopedia, 6 November 2008, accessed 9 September 2009 In subsequent books, she has continued to adapt her personal experiences. Her later novels are: The Children's Bach (1984) and Cosmo Cosmolino (1992). In 2008 she returned to fiction writing with the publication of The Spare Room, a fictional treatment of caring for a dying cancer patient, based on the illness and death of Garner's friend Jenya Osborne. She has also published several short story collections: Honour & Other People's Children: two stories (1980), Postcards from Surfers (1985) and My Hard Heart: Selected Fictions (1998). In 1986, Australian academic and critic, Don Anderson, wrote of The Children's Bach: \\"There are four perfect short novels in the English language. They are, in chronological order, Ford Madox Ford's The Good Soldier, Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises and Garner's The Children's Bach.\\"\\"A master is rescued\\", The National Times, 20‚Äì26 June 1986, p. 34 The Australian composer Andrew Schultz wrote an opera of the same name which premiered in 2008. Garner said, in 1985, that writing novels was like \\"trying to make a patchwork quilt look seamless. A novel is made up of scraps of our own lives and bits of other people's, and things we think of in the middle of the night and whole notebooks full of randomly collected details\\".cited by McPhee (2001) pp. 244‚Äì245 In an interview in 1999, she said that \\"My initial reason for writing is that I need to shape things so I can make them bearable or comprehensible to myself. It's my way of making sense of things that I've lived and seen other people live, things that I'm afraid of, or that I long for\\".cited by Grenville and Woolfe (2001) p. 71 Not all critics have liked Garner's work. Goldsworthy writes that \\"It is certainly the case that Garner is someone whose work elicits strong feelings ... and people who dislike her work are profoundly irritated by those who think she is one of the best writers in the country\\".Goldsworthy (1996) p. 20 Novelist and reviewer, Peter Corris wrote in his review of Monkey Grip that Garner \\"has published her private journal rather than written a novel\\" while Peter Pierce wrote in Meanjin of Honour and Other People's Children that Garner \\"talks dirty and passes it off as realism\\".both cited by Goldsworthy (1996) p. 18‚Äì19 Goldsworthy suggests that these two statements imply that she is not really a writer. Craven, though, argues that her novella, The Children's Bach, \\"should put paid to the myth of Helen Garner as a mere literalist or reporter\\",Craven (1985) p. 209 arguing, in fact, that it \\"is light years away from any sprawling-tell-it-all naturalism, [that] it is concentrated realism of extraordinary formal polish and the amount of tonal variation which it gets from its seemingly simple plot is multifoliate to the point of being awesome\\".Craven (1985) p. 213 =Screen writing= She has written three screenplays: Monkey Grip (1982), written with and directed by Ken Cameron; Two Friends (1986), directed by Jane Campion for TV; and The Last Days of Chez Nous (1992), directed by Gillian Armstrong. The relationship between two characters in The Last Days of Chez Nous was loosely inspired by the extramarital affair Garner's second husband had with her sister. Critic Peter Craven writes that \\"Two Friends is arguably the most accomplished piece of screenwriting the country has seen and it is characterised by a total lack of condescension towards the teenage girls at its centre\\".Craven (1985) p. 9 =Non-fiction writing= Garner has written non-fiction from the beginning of her career as a writer. In 1972 she was fired from her teaching job after publishing in The Digger, a counter-culture magazine, an anonymous account of frank and extended discussions she had with her students about sexuality and sexual activities. She wrote for this magazine from 1972 to 1974. In 1993, she won a Walkley Award for her TIME magazine account of a murder trial following the death of a toddler at the hands of his stepfather. One of her most famous and controversial books is The First Stone (1995), an account of a 1992 sexual harassment scandal at Ormond College. It was a best-seller in Australia but also attracted considerable criticism. Garner had received vicious hate-mail from women in Australia who accused her of derailing the feminist debate, and closing ranks with the abuser. She has since commented: \\"Sometimes I would have these kind of panic attacks caused by the hostility that some people showed towards me. I guess I knew there was going to be trouble, but the vitriolic nature of it gave me a bit of a shock\\". Garner's other non-fiction books are: True Stories: Selected Non-Fiction (1996), The Feel of Steel (2001), Joe Cinque's Consolation (2004) and This House of Grief ‚Äì The Story of a Murder Trial (2014). She also contributed to La Mama, the Story of a Theatre (1988). Joe Cinque's Consolation details a notorious murder case in Canberra involving a law student, Anu Singh, who drugged and murdered her boyfriend. It was adapted into a feature film in 2016. The film had premiers at both the Melbourne Film Festival and the Toronto International Film Festival, where it was generally well-received although detractors felt that the absence of Garner's voice from the story impacted the film-James Robert Douglas, writing for The Guardian, stated the film adaptation contained the \\"bones but not the wisdom of Garner's book\\". =Themes= Garner has covered a broad range of themes in her work, ranging from feminism, love, loss, grief, ageing, illness, death, murder, betrayal, addiction and the duality of the human psyche, particularly in manifestations of \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\". Her earliest work, Monkey Grip, is well known for its untamed depiction of heroin addiction. Its central character, a single mother, falls in love with an addict in an inner-city bohemian Melbourne suburb, dotted with junkies and share houses, during the 1970s. Drug addiction, however, was not a subject Garner would revisit, aside from touching on recreational drug use among university students in Joe Cinque's Consolation. However, Monkey Grip did establish Garner's trademark theme of obsession, particularly in conjunction with love and sexuality-enmeshed with substance abuse mirroring the addiction of romantic love. Some of her novels address \\"sexual desire and the family\\", exploring \\"the relationship between sexual behaviour and social organisation; the anarchic nature of desire and the orderly force of the institution of 'family'; the similarities and differences between collective households and nuclear families; the significance and the language of housework; [and] the idea of 'the house' as image, symbol, site and peace.\\"Goldsworthy (1996) p. 28 Garner has become known for her depiction of Australian life, both in the city and rural regions-she was born in Geelong and spent much of her life in Melbourne, approximately 75 kilometres (46 miles) from her hometown. Anne Myers, in an article written for The Sydney Morning Herald, recognised Garner's portrayals of the location of Melbourne as essential to Monkey Grip itself as any character: \\"Garner was writing Melbourne into the literary landscape and for the first time I saw my own world reflected back at me\\". Joe Cinque's Consolation, This House of Grief and to a lesser extent The First Stone, were commentaries on the justice system in Australia, how (and if) it adequately responds to crime, as well as the question of culpability. Craven comments that Garner is \\"always an extremely accurate writer in terms of the emotional states she depicts\\".Craven (1985) p. 210 Many of her books touch upon the inexplicable, irrational, and dark side to human behaviour-as well as Garner's attempts to understand human behaviour and sociology, which often eludes the average Australian and wider society, as well as the Australian justice system. In The Fate of The First Stone, Garner writes that she believes most people would prefer to keep incomprehensible stories of extreme behaviour at \\"arm's length\\" because it is \\"more comfortable, easier\\". Peter Craven wrote that Garner is fearless in her honesty: \\"she shows us what she does not know or is too blind to see: she shows us the poverty of the self in the face of impercipience caused by sentiment or anger, prejudice, ignorance or dumb incapacity.\\" He further commented on her ability to sometimes identify with the story's perceived villain, \\"[the] transgressor who at some level shares our own fingerprints\\". Similarly, various critics and journalists have highlighted Garner's portrayal of \\"ordinary people\\" caught up in extraordinary experiences, or the everyday person who, \\"under life's unbearable pressures\\", has \\"surrendered to their darker selves\\". James Wood, in a profile on Garner published in The New Yorker, stated that her work is absorbed in issues of gender and class, which he writes are \\"not categories so much as structures of feeling, variously argued over, enjoyed, endured, and escaped\\". Personal life After her marriage to Bill Garner ended, Garner married two more times: to Jean-Jacques Portail (1980‚Äì85) and Australian writer Murray Bail (born 1941), from whom she separated in the late 1990s. She is no longer married. In her work, she has been open about her struggle with depression and her two abortions. She has one child, Alice Garner (b. 1969), from her marriage to Bill Garner. Alice Garner is also an author, as well as a musician, teacher and historian. In 2003, a portrait of Garner, titled True Stories, painted by Jenny Sages, was a finalist in the Archibald Prize.

The material flows down from a volcano, typically along a river valley. Lahars are extremely destructive: they can flow tens of metres per second, they have been known to be up to deep, and large flows tend to destroy any structures in their path. Notable lahars include those at Mount Pinatubo and Nevado del Ruiz, the latter of which killed thousands of people in the town of Armero. Etymology The word lahar is of Javanese origin. The geological term was introduced by Berend George Escher in 1922. Description Excavated 9th century Sambisari Hindu temple near Yogyakarta in Java, Indonesia. The temple was buried 6.5 metres under the lahar volcanic debris accumulated from centuries of Mount Merapi eruptions. A lahar is a volcanic mudflow or debris flow. Lahars have the consistency, viscosity and approximate density of wet concrete: fluid when moving, solid at rest. Lahars can be huge. The Osceola Lahar produced by Mount Rainier (Washington) some 5600 years ago resulted in a wall of mud deep in the White River canyon, which covered an area of over , for a total volume of . A lahar of sufficient size and intensity can erase virtually any structure in its path, and is capable of carving its own pathway, making the prediction of its course difficult. Conversely, a lahar quickly loses force when it leaves the channel of its flow: even frail huts may remain standing, while at the same time being buried to the roof line in mud. A lahar's viscosity decreases with time, and can be further thinned by rain, but it nevertheless solidifies quickly when coming to a stop. Lahars vary in size and speed. Small lahars less than a few metres wide and several centimetres deep may flow a few metres per second. Large lahars hundreds of metres wide and tens of metres deep can flow several tens of metres per second (22 mph or more): much too fast for people to outrun. On steep slopes, lahar speeds can exceed . With the potential to flow distances of more than , a lahar can cause catastrophic destruction in its path. Lahars from the 1985 Nevado del Ruiz eruption in Colombia caused the Armero tragedy, which killed an estimated 23,000 people, when the city of Armero was buried under of mud and debris. A lahar caused New Zealand's Tangiwai disaster, where 151 people died after a Christmas Eve express train fell into the Whangaehu River in 1953. Lahars have been responsible for 17% of volcano-related deaths between 1783 and 1997. Causes Mudline left behind on trees on the banks of the Muddy River after the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens showing the height of the lahar Lahars have several possible causes: * Snow and glaciers can be melted by lava or pyroclastic surges during an eruption. * Lava can erupt from open vents and mix with wet soil, mud or snow on the slope of the volcano making a very viscous, high energy lahar. The higher up the slope of the volcano, the more gravitational potential energy the flows will have. * A flood caused by a glacier, lake breakout, or heavy rainfalls can generate lahars, also called glacier run or j√∂kulhlaup * Water from a crater lake, combined with volcanic material in an eruption. * Heavy rainfall on unconsolidated pyroclastic deposits. * Volcanic landslides mixed with water. In particular, although lahars are typically associated with the effects of volcanic activity, lahars can occur even without any current volcanic activity, as long as the conditions are right to cause the collapse and movement of mud originating from existing volcanic ash deposits. * Snow and glaciers can melt during periods of mild to hot weather. * Earthquakes underneath or close to the volcano can shake material loose and cause it to collapse, triggering a lahar avalanche. * Rainfall can cause the still-hanging slabs of solidified mud to come rushing down the slopes at a speed of more than , causing devastating results. Places at risk The aftermath of a lahar from the 1982 eruption of Galunggung, Indonesia Several mountains in the world, including Mount Rainier in the United States, Mount Ruapehu in New Zealand, Merapi and Galunggung in Indonesia, are considered particularly dangerous due to the risk of lahars. Several towns in the Puyallup River valley in Washington state, including Orting, are built on top of lahar deposits that are only about 500 years old. Lahars are predicted to flow through the valley every 500 to 1,000 years, so Orting, Sumner, Puyallup, Fife, and the Port of Tacoma face considerable risk. The USGS has set up lahar warning sirens in Pierce County, Washington, so that people can flee an approaching debris flow in the event of a Mount Rainier eruption. A lahar warning system has been set up at Mount Ruapehu by the New Zealand Department of Conservation and hailed as a success after it successfully alerted officials to an impending lahar on 18 March 2007. Since mid-June 1991, when violent eruptions triggered Mount Pinatubo's first lahars in 500 years, a system to monitor and warn of lahars has been in operation. Radio-telemetered rain gauges provide data on rainfall in lahar source regions, acoustic flow monitors on stream banks detect ground vibration as lahars pass, and manned watchpoints further confirm that lahars are rushing down Pinatubo's slopes. This system has enabled warnings to be sounded for most but not all major lahars at Pinatubo, saving hundreds of lives. Physical preventative measures by the Philippine government were not adequate to stop over of mud from flooding many villages around Mount Pinatubo from 1992 through 1998. Scientists and governments try to identify areas with a high risk of lahars based on historical events and computer models. Volcano scientists play a critical role in effective hazard education by informing officials and the public about realistic hazard probabilities and scenarios (including potential magnitude, timing, and impacts); by helping evaluate the effectiveness of proposed risk-reduction strategies; by helping promote acceptance of (and confidence in) hazards information through participatory engagement with officials and vulnerable communities as partners in risk reduction efforts; and by communicating with emergency managers during extreme events. An example of such a model is TITAN2D. These models are directed towards future planning: identifying low-risk regions to place community buildings, discovering how to mitigate lahars with dams, and constructing evacuation plans. Examples =Nevado del Ruiz= The lahar from the 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz that wiped out the town of Armero in Colombia In 1985, the volcano Nevado del Ruiz erupted in central Colombia. As pyroclastic flows erupted from the volcano's crater, they melted the mountain's glaciers, sending four enormous lahars down its slopes at . The lahars picked up speed in gullies and coursed into the six major rivers at the base of the volcano; they engulfed the town of Armero, killing more than 20,000 of its almost 29,000 inhabitants. Casualties in other towns, particularly Chinchin√°, brought the overall death toll to 23,000. Footage and photographs of Omayra S√°nchez, a young victim of the tragedy, were published around the world. Other photographs of the lahars and the impact of the disaster captured attention worldwide and led to controversy over the degree to which the Colombian government was responsible for the disaster. =Mount Pinatubo= A before-and-after photograph of a river valley filled in by lahars from Mount Pinatubo The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo caused lahars: the first eruption itself killed six people, but the lahar killed more than 1500. The eye of Typhoon Yunya passed over the volcano during its eruption on June 15, 1991. The rain from the typhoon triggered the flow of volcanic ash, boulders, and water down the rivers surrounding the volcano. In Pampanga, Angeles and neighbouring cities and towns were damaged by the volcano's lahar when Sapang Balen Creek and the Abacan River became the channels for the mudflows and carried it to the heart of the city and surrounding areas. Over of mud inundated and damaged the towns of Castillejos, San Marcelino and Botolan in Zambales, Porac and Mabalacat in Pampanga, Tarlac City, Capas, Concepcion and Bamban in Tarlac. The lahar in the Sacobia-Bamban River scoured all structures in its path, including the bridges and dikes by the Parua River in Concepcion. The Tarlac River in Tarlac City was inundated by over of lahar, causing the river to lose the ability to hold water. On the morning of October 1, 1995, pyroclastic material which clung to the slopes of Pinatubo and surrounding mountains rushed down because of heavy rain, and turned into an lahar. This mudflow killed hundreds of people in Barangay Cabalantian in Bacolor. The Philippine government under President Fidel V. Ramos ordered the construction of the FVR Mega Dike in an attempt to protect people from further mudflows. Another typhoon-caused lahar hit the Philippines in 2006; see Typhoon Reming.

After a year as a corps officer in the north of England, he served on the staff of the International Training College in London for seven years before returning to corps appointments. He and Captain Freda Turner were married in 1969 while Larsson was stationed at the corps in Ealing. They have two sons, Karl Larsson and Kevin Larsson, who are both members of The Salvation Army. Larsson and his wife were appointed to the South America West Territory in 1980, he as Chief Secretary and she as Territorial Home League Secretary. In 1984, they were appointed to the International Training College as principal and librarian, respectively. They were appointed to International Headquarters in London in 1988. Larsson, as assistant to the Chief of the Staff for United Kingdom administrative planning, was given the task of researching and planning for the separation of the international and national administrations. Freda Larsson served as coordinator for married women officers. The Larssons were then appointed Territorial Commander and Territorial President of Women's Organisations for the United Kingdom Territory with the Republic of Ireland in 1990.

It is a stratovolcano composed of many layers of lava alternating with hardened volcanic ash and other pyroclastic rocks. Volcanic activity at Nevado del Ruiz began about two million years ago, since the Early Pleistocene or Late Pliocene, with three major eruptive periods. The current volcanic cone formed during the present eruptive period, which began 150 thousand years ago. The volcano usually generates Vulcanian to Plinian eruptions, which produce swift-moving currents of hot gas and rock called pyroclastic flows. These eruptions often cause massive lahars (mud and debris flows), which pose a threat to human life and the environment. The impact of such an eruption is increased as the hot gas and lava melt the mountain's snowcap, adding large quantities of water to the flow. On November 13, 1985, a small eruption produced an enormous lahar that buried and destroyed the town of Armero in Tolima, causing an estimated 25,000 deaths. This event later became known as the Armero tragedy‚Äîthe deadliest lahar in recorded history. Similar but less deadly incidents occurred in 1595 and 1845, consisting of a small explosive eruption followed by a large lahar. The volcano is part of Los Nevados National Natural Park, which also contains several other volcanoes. The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by large glaciers. The volcano continues to pose a threat to the nearby towns and villages, and it is estimated that up to 500,000 people could be at risk from lahars from future eruptions. Today, the Nevado del Ruiz volcano is constantly monitored by the Volcanic and Seismic Observatory of Manizales.  Geography and geology  The volcano's summit and upper flanks are covered by several glaciers that appear as a white mass surrounding the Arenas crater. Nevado del Ruiz, which lies about west of Bogot√°, is part of the Andes mountain range. The volcano is part of the Ruiz‚ÄìTolima volcanic massif (or Cordillera Central), a group of five ice-capped volcanoes which includes the Tolima, Santa Isabel, Quindio and Machin volcanoes. The massif is located at the intersection of four faults, some of which still are active. Nevado del Ruiz lies within the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region that encircles the Pacific Ocean and contains some of the world's most active volcanoes. It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes lying in the North Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt, which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene-age volcanoes in South America. The Andean Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate. As is the case for many subduction-zone volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz can generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating lahars (mud and debris flows). Like many other Andean volcanoes, Nevado del Ruiz is a stratovolcano: a voluminous, roughly conical volcano consisting of many strata of hardened lava and tephra including volcanic ash. Its lavas are andesitic‚Äìdacitic in composition. The modern volcanic cone comprises five lava domes, all constructed within the caldera of an ancestral Ruiz volcano: Nevado El Cisne, Alto de la Laguna, La Olleta, Alto la Pirana, and Alto de Santano. It covers an area of more than , stretching from east to west. The mountain's broad summit includes the Arenas crater, which is in diameter and deep. Nevado del Ruiz, as its neighbours to the southwest Nevado El Cisne and Nevado de Santa Isabel is located over the Palestina Fault that crosscuts the underlying El Bosque Batholith, dated at 49.1 ¬± 1.7 Ma. The summit of the volcano has steep slopes inclining from 20 to 30 degrees. At lower elevations, the slopes become less steep; their inclination is about 10 degrees. From there on, foothills stretch almost to the edge of the Magdalena River, north of the volcano and the Cauca River to the west. On the two major sides of the summit, headwalls show where past rock avalanches occurred. At times, ice on the summit has melted, generating devastating lahars, including the continent's deadliest eruption in 1985. On the volcano's southwest flank is the pyroclastic cone La Olleta, which is not currently active, but may have erupted in historical times. = Glaciers = The summit of Nevado del Ruiz is covered by glaciers (nevado means \\"snow-covered\\" in Spanish), which formed over many thousands of years, and have generally retreated since the last glacial maximum. From 28,000 to 21,000 years ago, glaciers occupied about of the Ruiz‚ÄìTolima massif. As late as 12,000 years ago, when the ice sheets from the last glacial period were retreating, they still covered . During the Little Ice Age, which lasted from about 1600 to 1900 CE, the ice cap covered approximately . Since then the glaciers have retreated further because of atmospheric warming. By 1959, the massif's glaciated area had dropped to . Since the 1985 eruption, which destroyed about 10% of the summit ice cover, the area of Nevado del Ruiz covered by glaciers has halved‚Äîfrom just after the eruption to about in 2003. The glaciers reached altitudes as low as in 1985 but have now retreated to elevations of . The ice cap is approximately thick on average. It is thickest in parts of the summit plateau and under the Nereides Glacier on the southwestern slopes, where it is as deep as . Glaciers on the northern and, to a lesser extent, the eastern slopes lost the most ice in the 1985 eruption, and therefore reach only up to deep. The deep ice covering the summit plateau may hide a caldera. Five domes ringing the summit plateau have emerged as the ice has retreated. The meltwater from the glaciers drains primarily to the Cauca River and Magdalena River via the western and eastern flanks of the volcano, respectively. Runoff from these glaciers and those on the surrounding volcanoes is a source of fresh water for forty surrounding towns, and Colombian scientists and government officials are concerned about the towns' water supply should the glaciers melt completely.  Flora and fauna  Nevado del Ruiz is generally poorly forested because of its high elevation, and its forest cover decreases with increasing elevation. At lower elevations, well-developed mesic forests (20‚Äì35 meters / 66‚Äì110 ft high) are present. Above these but below the tree line, parts of the volcano are covered with dwarf forests high. Above the tree line, in the P√°ramo zone, the vegetation is dominated by plants such as bunchgrass and Espeletia. Regional vegetation consists of different families of woody plants, including Rubiaceae, Leguminosae, Melastomataceae, Lauraceae, and Moraceae. Flowers such as Polypodiaceae s.l., Araceae, Poaceae, Asteraceae, Piperaceae, and Orchidaceae are also present in the region. Animals living on the volcano include the mountain tapir and spectacled bear, both of which are designated as threatened. Other animals inhabiting the surrounding region include the rufous-fronted parakeet, bearded helmetcrest, and Herveo plump toad. The volcano is home to 27 species of birds endemic to Colombia, with 14 of these species confined to the region around the volcano. 15 bird species in the area are considered threatened.  Los Nevados National Park  Nevado del Ruiz is one of several stratovolcanoes within Los Nevados National Natural Park, a national park located west of Bogot√° in the centre of the Colombian Andes. The park is a popular tourist destination and contains several tourist shelters. The slopes of the volcano are used for winter sports, and nearby Lake Ot√∫n offers trout fishing. A number of commercially operated spas can be found nearby.. In 1868‚Äì1869, German geologists Wilhelm Reiss and Alphons St√ºbel were the first to attempt to climb Ruiz. In 1936, W. Cunet and Augusto Gansser- Biaggi made the first successful ascent, partly by ski; they repeated the ascent in 1939.  Eruptive history  The top of the 11,000 year-old ash fall deposits interstratified with paleosols overlying a channelized debris flow and a sequence of wet surges The first eruptions of Nevado del Ruiz occurred about 1.8 million years ago at the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5‚Äì10 km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago. The present period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz‚ÄìTolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them. During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ¬± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ¬± 100 years, 350 AD ¬± 300 years, 675 AD ¬± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 ‚Äì March 1985, September 1985 ‚Äì July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras. = 1595 lahar = On November 13, 1595, Nevado del Ruiz erupted. The episode consisted of three Plinian eruptions, which were heard up to from the summit of the volcano. A large amount of ash was ejected, which completely darkened the surrounding area. The volcano also erupted lapilli (a form of tephra) and pumice bombs. In total, the eruption produced 0.16 km3 of tephra. The eruption was preceded by a large precursor earthquake three days before. The eruption caused lahars, which traveled down the valleys of the nearby Gual√≠ and Lagunillas rivers, clogging up the water, killing fish and destroying vegetation. More than 600 people died as a result of the lahar. The 1595 eruption was the last major eruption of Nevado del Ruiz before 1985. The 1595 and 1985 eruptions were similar in many respects, including in the chemical composition of the erupted material. = 1845 lahar = On the morning of February 19, 1845, a large earthquake resulted in a substantial mudflow. This mudflow flowed down the valley of the Lagunillas River for approximately , spilling out of the river channel and killing much of the local population. After reaching an alluvial fan, the mudflow split into two branches. The larger portion of it joined the Lagunillas River and flowed into the nearby Magdalena River, while the smaller portion was diverted by hills in front of Lagunillas Canyon, turned 90 degrees to the north until it reached the Sabandija River, and then flowed east with the Sabandija River, until it rejoined the other branch of the mudflow at the junction of the Sabandija and the Magdalena. It is estimated that 1000 people were killed in the mudflows. = Eruption (1985) = Beginning November 1984, geologists observed an increasing level of seismic activity near Nevado del Ruiz. Such volcanic tectonic seismicity is often a precursor of an upcoming eruption. Other signs of a forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on the summit of the volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985. An Italian volcanological mission analyzed gas samples from fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved them to be a mixture of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to be very high. The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities. In November 1985, volcanic activity once again increased as magma neared the surface. The volcano began releasing increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elementary sulfur. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched in magnesium, calcium and potassium, which were leached from the magma. The thermodynamic equilibration (stationary heat energy) temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, were from to . The extensive degassing of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption.  Eruption and lahars  Hazard map for Nevado del Ruiz, with 1985 lahars shown in red At 3:06 pm, on November 13, 1985, Nevado del Ruiz began to erupt, ejecting dacitic tephra more than into the atmosphere. The total mass of the erupted material (including magma) was 35 million tonnes‚Äîonly 3% of the amount that erupted from Mount St. Helens in 1980. The eruption reached a value of 3 on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. The mass of the ejected sulfur dioxide was about 700,000 tonnes, or about 2% of the mass of the erupted solid material, making the eruption atypically sulfur-rich. The eruption produced pyroclastic flows that melted summit glaciers and snow, generating four thick lahars that raced down river valleys on the volcano's flanks. It also destroyed a small lake that was observed in Arenas crater several months before the eruption. Water in such volcanic lakes tends to be extremely salty and contain dissolved volcanic gases. The lake's hot, acidic water significantly accelerated the melting of the ice; this effect was confirmed by the large amounts of sulfates and chlorides found in the lahar flow. Armero was located in the center of this photograph, taken late November 1985. The lahars, formed of water, ice, pumice, and other rocks, mixed with clay as they travelled down the volcano's flanks. They ran down the volcano's sides at an average speed of 60 km per hour, eroding soil, dislodging rock, and destroying vegetation. After descending thousands of meters down the side of the volcano, the lahars were directed into all of the six river valleys leading from the volcano. While in the river valleys, the lahars grew to almost 4 times their original volume. In the Gual√≠ River, a lahar reached a maximum width of . One of the lahars virtually erased the town of Armero in Tolima, which lay in the Lagunilla River valley. Only one quarter of its 28,700 inhabitants survived. The second lahar, which descended through the valley of Chinchin√° River, killed about 1,800 people and destroyed about 400 homes in the town of Chinchin√°, in the department of Caldas. In total, over 23,000 people were killed and approximately 5,000 were injured. More than 5,000 homes were destroyed. The Armero tragedy, as the event came to be known, was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster in the 20th century, being surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pel√©e, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic eruption in recorded history. It is also the deadliest known lahar, and Colombia's worst natural disaster. A young girl named Omayra S√°nchez became a worldwide symbol of the disaster after images of her trapped under the debris of her former home, after the eruption made the news worldwide. The loss of life during the 1985 eruption was due partly to the fact that scientists did not know precisely when the eruption would occur, and the authorities would not take costly preventive measures without clear warnings of imminent danger. Because the volcano's last substantial eruption occurred more than 140 years earlier, it was also hard for many to accept the danger the volcano presented; locals even called it the \\"Sleeping Lion\\". Hazard maps showing Armero would be completely flooded after an eruption were distributed more than a month before the eruption, but the Colombian Congress criticized the scientific and civil defense agencies for scaremongering. Local authorities failed to alert people to the seriousness of the situation, with Armero's mayor and a priest both reassuring the populace after an ash eruption on the afternoon of November 13 and the consequent ashfall early that evening. Another factor was the storm that hit that evening, causing electrical outages and hindering communications. Civil defense officials from four nearby towns tried to warn Armero the lahar was approaching in the hour or so before it reached Armero, but failed to make radio contact. Scientists later looked back to the hours before the eruption and noticed that several long-period earthquakes, which start out strong and then slowly die out, had occurred in the final hours before the eruption. Volcanologist Bernard Chouet said that, \\"the volcano was screaming 'I'm about to explode'\\", but the scientists who were studying the volcano at the time of the eruption were not able to read this signal.  Current threats and preparedness  Nevado del Ruiz as seen from Manizales, 2006 Photo of Nevado del Ruiz taken on approach to El Dorado International Airport, Bogot√°. Nevado del Tolima is visible in the background on the left. Approximate altitude of photo: . The volcano continues to pose a serious threat to nearby towns and villages. The most likely hazard is small-volume eruptions, which might destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Despite the significant retrenchment of the volcano's glaciers, the volume of ice atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz‚ÄìTolima massif remains large. Melting merely 10% of the ice would produce mudflows with a volume of up to ‚Äîsimilar to the mudflow that destroyed Armero in 1985. Such lahars can travel up to along river valleys in a matter of few hours. Estimates show that up to 500,000 people living in the Combeima, Chinchin√°, Coello-Toche, and Guali valleys are in danger, and 100,000 of these are considered to be at high risk. Lahars pose a threat to nearby towns of Honda, Mariquita, Ambalema, Chinchin√°, Herveo, Villa Hermosa, Salgar and La Dorada. Although small eruptions are more likely, the two million-year eruptive history of the Ruiz‚ÄìTolima massif includes numerous large eruptions, indicating that the threat of a large eruption cannot be ignored. A large eruption would have more widespread effects, including the potential closure of Bogot√°'s airport due to ashfall. As the Armero tragedy was exacerbated by the lack of early warnings, unwise land use, and the unpreparedness of nearby communities, the government of Colombia created a special program (Oficina Nacional para la Atencion de Desastres, 1987) to prevent such incidents in the future. All Colombian cities were directed to promote prevention planning in order to mitigate the consequences of natural disasters, and evacuations due to volcanic hazards have been carried out. About 2,300 people living along five nearby rivers were evacuated when Nevado del Ruiz erupted again in 1989. When another Colombian volcano, the Nevado del Huila, erupted in April 2008, thousands of people were evacuated because volcanologists worried that the eruption could be another \\"Nevado del Ruiz\\". In 2006, heavy rains on Ruiz sent a mudslide down the Chinchin√° River, killing nine youths aged 12‚Äì19 on a scouting expedition near the volcano. = Recent activity = During September and October 2019, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual increases in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at Nevado del Ruiz prompted an alert level of Yellow on October 1. Chemical analysis of the volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months a smattering of long- period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight times as many as had been recorded from 2009‚Äì2010. 2010 marked the beginning of increases in sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a dramatic increase in earthquakes. Scientists flying over the volcano on March 8, 2012 noted fresh ash deposits on the east flank of the volcano near the crater, likely from an phreatic eruption on February 22. Later that day, a small ash plume erupted from the crater; by March 13, scientists detected ash deposits at the head of the Gual√≠ River. After seismicity continued to increase, the alert level was raised to Orange, and in April Nevados National Natural Park authority closed the reserve, fearing lahars and ashfall hazards. The sudden activity peak in March did not culminate in a major eruption, and activity declined enough that the alert level was lowered to Yellow on May 3. On May 29, seismicity rapidly increased, and the alert level was restored to Orange because ash fell into more than 20 nearby communities. Over the next few months ash fell frequently until earthquakes increased again in June. Because of the severity of these tremors, evacuations were ordered by the Emergency Committee of Caldas on news media for 300‚Äì1500 people near the volcano. The alert level was raised to Red, indicating an imminent major volcanic event, and an eruption in diameter took place on July 2, 2012, continuing intermittently until the end of August. Ash plumes and sulfur dioxide emissions recurred until January 2013. Through the beginning of July 2013, ashfall took place at Nevado del Ruiz a few times per month. On July 11, 2013, there was a relatively large explosion, followed by inactivity until August, when emission of ash resumed, continuing intermittently until April 2014. Reports of ashfall stopped until October 2014. In November 2014, earthquakes were recorded, and volcanic ash was observed near the summit; ashfall reached local communities within a radius of Nevado del Ruiz multiple times each month until December 2015. A lava dome was extruded from August to the end of October in 2015, coinciding with thermal anomalies increasing near the summit crater at the end of the same year. According to the Global Volcanism Program, the last documented eruption at Nevado del Ruiz took place in 2017. However, reports from the Servicio Geol√≥gico Colombiano observatory at Manizales through the end of October 2018 suggested earthquakes near the volcano, with phreatic eruptions ejecting water vapor, volcanic ash, and volcanic gases up to over its crater.

Reng Student Union Arkansas State University (A-State or ASU) is a public research university in Jonesboro, Arkansas. It is the flagship campus of the Arkansas State University System and the second largest university in Arkansas. The university was founded in 1909 and is located atop 1,376 acres (5.6 km2) on Crowley's Ridge. Arkansas State University is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". History A-State was founded as the First District Agricultural School in Jonesboro in 1909 by the Arkansas Legislature as a regional agricultural training school. Robert W. Glover, a Missionary Baptist pastor who served in both houses of the Arkansas Legislature from Sheridan (1905‚Äì1912), introduced in 1909 the resolution calling for the establishment of four state agricultural colleges, including the future ASU. In 1918, ASU began offering a two-year college program. In 1925, it became First District Agricultural and Mechanical College. A four- year degree program was begun in 1930. A & M College became Arkansas State College in 1933. In 1967, the Arkansas Legislature elevated the college to university status and changed the name to Arkansas State University. In the fall of 2014, A-State welcomed its most academically prepared freshman class. The result of several years of growing both admission standards and increasing on-campus housing, A-State's incoming first-year first-time student composite ACT was 23.9 with an average high school GPA of 3.47. This was the third consecutive year of improvement for the ACT/GPA freshman classes for Arkansas State. The Arkansas State Honors College has grown 59% since 2009. The university also posted back-to-back high graduate counts in spring 2012 and spring 2013, producing the most graduates in a two-year period in school history. The university contains the largest library in the state of Arkansas, the Dean B. Ellis Library. Dean B.

Academics Master's degree graduate programs were initiated in 1955, and ASU began offering its first doctoral degree, in educational leadership, in the fall of 1992. A second doctoral program, in environmental science, was begun in the fall of 1997, and the doctoral program in heritage studies began in the fall of 2001. Newer doctoral programs are in environmental science, molecular biosciences, and physical therapy. In the fall of 2016, Arkansas State enrolled the first class of approximately 115 students to its branch of the New York Institute of Technology's medical school. The medical school is located on campus in the historic Wilson Hall. In 2018, Arkansas State was classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". The university nevertheless maintains a focus on undergraduate instruction and small class sizes, with a student-faculty ratio of 16:1, ranked #76 in undergraduate teaching nationwide . Today, the institution has more than 90,000 alumni. Programs at the doctorate, specialist's, master's, bachelor's, and associate degree levels are available through the various colleges: Agriculture, Engineering & Technology, Business, Education & Behavioral Science, Liberal Arts & Communication, Nursing & Health Professions, Sciences & Mathematics, and Undergraduate Studies. Media A-State's journalism program reorganized into the College of Media and Communication for fall 2013. The College of Media and Communication is home to three student-led media outlets and a NPR affiliate radio station. The Herald, a weekly student newspaper, was founded in 1921 and has a circulation of 5,000. ASU-TV, a program under the Department of Radio-Television, gives students hands-on experience in the field of television broadcasting. Starting in fall 2013, an Internet-based student radio station, Red Wolf Radio, was added to the student media. Arkansas State is also home to KASU, a 100,000-watt FM station, which is the oldest NPR affiliate west of the Mississippi River. Centennial Bank Stadium (formerly known as Indian Stadium) Athletics Arkansas State participates as a member of the NCAA Division I Sun Belt Conference. The athletic teams, previously known as the Indians, are now known as the Red Wolves. In 2012, the Red Wolves football team became Sun Belt Conference champions for a second straight year, finishing the regular season with a 9-3 record, and capped off its successful season with its first bowl game victory since becoming a Division I-A (FBS) program with a 17-13 victory over Kent State in the GoDaddy.com Bowl, as well as earning its first win over a ranked opponent since joining the FBS in 1992. In 2013, the football team became the Sun Belt Conference champions for a third straight year, finishing with a 7-5 regular season record and won a second consecutive GoDaddy Bowl with a 23-20 victory over then 10-2 Ball State.

Indiana limestone ‚Äî also known as Bedford limestone ‚Äî has long been an economically important building material, particularly for monumental public structures. Indiana limestone is a more common term for Bedford limestone, a geological formation primarily quarried in south central Indiana, USA, between the cities of Bloomington and Bedford. Bedford, Indiana, has been noted to have the highest quality quarried limestone in the United States. Bedford limestone, like all limestone, is a rock primarily formed of calcium carbonate. It was deposited over millions of years as marine fossils decomposed at the bottom of a shallow inland sea which covered most of the present-day Midwestern United States during the Mississippian Period.  History  Sanders Quarry in Monroe County, Indiana Native Americans were the first people to discover limestone in Indiana. Not long after they arrived, American settlers used this rock around their windows and doors and for memorials around the towns. The first quarry was started in 1827, and by 1929 Hoosier quarries yielded 12,000,000 ft3 (340,000 cubic meters) of usable stone. The expansion of the railroads brought great need for limestone to build bridges and tunnels and Indiana was the place to get it. American architecture of the late 19th and early 20th century included a lot of limestone detail work on buildings, but as architectural styles changed, so did the demand for limestone. Bedford limestone was officially designated as the state stone of Indiana by the Indiana General Assembly in 1971. With the Arab Oil Embargo of 1973, the price of alternative building materials skyrocketed so Indiana limestone reemerged as an energy-efficient building material.  Use in notable buildings  =Local= Many of Indiana's official buildings, such as the State capitol building, the monuments in Downtown Indianapolis, the Benjamin Harrison School of Law in Indianapolis, many university buildings, and the Indiana Government Center, and most of the state's 92 courthouses are all examples of Indiana architecture made with Indiana limestone. The majority of Indiana University, Bloomington, was constructed out of limestone. 1959's architecturally significant St. Augustine's Episcopal Church, in Gary, Indiana, uses Indiana limestone in the interior. The Saint Sava Serbian Orthodox Church in Merrillville, Indiana, consecrated in 1991 and awarded a Gold Medal Award for Excellence in Masonry Design, uses Indiana limestone on its exterior facade. =National= Nationally, Indiana limestone has long been part of a high-end market. It has mostly been used on the exteriors of homes and commercial and government buildings. Glory of Commerce, a celebrated sculptural group atop the fa√ßade of New York's Grand Central Terminal, is made of Indiana Limestone. Many prominent public buildings in the United States ‚Äî such as the National Cathedral, Biltmore Estate, Empire State Building, the Pentagon, The Crescent in Dallas, and the Hotel Pennsylvania ‚Äî feature Indiana limestone in their exteriors. Some 35 of the 50 state capitol buildings in the United States are made of Indiana limestone. It was used extensively in rebuilding Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The sculptural group atop the main fa√ßade of New York City's Grand Central Terminal ‚Äî known as Glory of Commerce ‚Äî is made of Indiana Limestone. (A work by Jules-F√©lix Coutan, it includes representations of Minerva, Hercules, and Mercury and, at its unveiling in 1914, was considered the largest sculptural group in the world.Roberts, Sam (January 22, 2013), Grand Central: How a Train Station Transformed America, Grand Central Publishing; pg 89. .Bilotto, Gregory; DiLorenzo, Frank (2017), Building Grand Central Terminal, Arcadia Publishing Incorporated; pg 2. .) The original 1930s buildings of Rockefeller Center use limestone from Bedford. In 1955 the Tennessee State Capitol exterior was renovated using Indiana limestone to replace the poorer quality Tennessee limestone that had started to deteriorate. Indiana limestone was used in the rebuilding of the Pentagon after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11, 2001. The project took around 15,000 cubic feet of stone and was rededicated exactly one year after the attack. The new Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, which opened in 2009, extensively uses Indiana limestone paneling on its exterior facade. Indiana limestone has been particularly popular for the construction of university buildings. The Neo- Gothic campus of the University of Chicago is almost entirely constructed out of Bedford limestone; in keeping with the trend of post-Fire buildings using the material. The campus of Washington University in St. Louis ‚Äì both for new construction and original buildings ‚Äì makes use of Indiana limestone (along with Missouri Red Granite) in its collegiate gothic architecture. Many buildings on the north side of Michigan State University use Indiana limestone. The Cathedral of Learning, a 42-story neo-gothic skyscraper that is the largest educational building in the Western Hemisphere, along with other nearby buildings of the University of Pittsburgh, are clad in Indiana limestone. The St. Anthony Society Chapter House at Yale University also is built of Indiana limestone. Both structures of the Kenosha County Courthouse and Jail in Kenosha, Wisconsin, were built out of the limestone. This stone was used as far north as the Hotel Macdonald in Edmonton. Several buildings on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis incorporate Indiana limestone and many of the academic buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Nebraska State Capitol is clad in Indiana Limestone, after native limestone was deemed too prone to weathering.https://capitol.nebraska.gov/building/history/nebraska-capitols// With the impact of acid rain, Indiana Limestone is not as often used in monuments today as it was in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Rare are known for their games spanning many genres, which include platforming, first-person shooter, action-adventure, fighting, and racing. Some of their most popular titles include games from the Donkey Kong, Banjo-Kazooie, Viva Pi√±ata, and Battletoads series, as well as games like GoldenEye 007 and Sea of Thieves. The company was established in 1985 by brothers Tim and Chris Stamper, who also founded Ultimate Play the Game. During its early years, Rare was backed by an unlimited budget from Nintendo, primarily concentrated on Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) games. During this time the studio created successful games such as Wizards & Warriors, R.C. Pro-Am, and Battletoads. Rare became a prominent second-party developer for Nintendo, which came to own a large minority stake of the company. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Rare received international recognition and critical acclaim for games such as the Donkey Kong Country trilogy, Killer Instinct, GoldenEye 007, Banjo- Kazooie, Perfect Dark, and Conker's Bad Fur Day. In 2002, Microsoft acquired Rare, which retained the original brand, logo, and most intellectual properties. Rare has since focused on developing games exclusively for Microsoft's video game consoles, including Grabbed by the Ghoulies, Kameo: Elements of Power, Perfect Dark Zero, and Viva Pi√±ata. In 2007, the Stampers left Rare to pursue other opportunities and, in 2010, the company's focus shifted to the Xbox Live Avatar and Kinect, releasing three Kinect Sports games. In 2015, Rare developed Rare Replay, an Xbox One-exclusive compilation containing 30 of its games to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Rare's most recent game, Sea of Thieves, was released in 2018. Fans and employees have been critical of Microsoft's buyout of Rare, citing a significant drop in game quality and the loss of original talent. Several key employees left Rare to form their own companies, such as Free Radical Design (later Crytek UK), best known for producing the TimeSplitters series, and Playtonic Games, best known for producing Yooka-Laylee. Rare is widely acknowledged by the gaming industry and has received numerous accolades from critics and journalists, though often described as secretive and seclusive. History =Founding (1985‚Äì1993)= Rare evolved from the company Ultimate Play the Game, which was founded in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire by former arcade game developers Tim and Chris Stamper. After multiple critically and commercially successful releases including Jetpac, Atic Atac, Sabre Wulf, and Knight Lore, Ultimate Play The Game was one of the biggest UK-based video game development companies. The ZX Spectrum home computer, the platform the company usually developed games for, was only popular in the UK, and they believed that working on that platform would not be beneficial to the company's growth as they considered it a \\"dead end\\". Meanwhile, the company inspected an imported console from Japan, the Famicom, and believed that it would be an ideal future platform of choice for the company as it was more sophisticated than the Spectrum, had a worldwide market, and its cartridges had no load times. As a result, Rare was established in 1985. Its main goal was to reverse-engineer the console and investigate the codes for Famicom's games to learn more about the console's programming. With successful results, the company decided to sell the Ultimate brand to U.S. Gold, and ceased game development for the ZX Spectrum in the following year. The Famicom's manufacturer, Nintendo, claimed that it was impossible to reverse engineer the console. Using the information the Ultimate Play the Game team acquired from Rare, the team prepared several tech demos and showed them to the Nintendo executive Minoru Arakawa in Kyoto. Impressed with their efforts, Nintendo decided to grant the Ultimate Play the Game team an unlimited budget for them to work on games for the Famicom platform. After they returned to England, they moved from Ashby-de-la-Zouch to Twycross, and established a new studio through Rare. They set their headquarters in a Manor Farmhouse. Rare also set up another company known as Rare, Inc., in Miami, Florida. Headed by Joel Hochberg, the American company was involved in maintaining Rare's operation in the US and contacting major US publishers. Famicom was eventually released in North America and Europe under the name Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). With the unlimited budget, the Rare studio could work a large variety of different games. The first project Rare worked on was Slalom, a downhill skiing game. The company then worked with various gaming publishers that included Tradewest, Acclaim Entertainment, Electronic Arts, Sega, Mindscape, and Gametek to produce over 60 games for the NES and several additional Game Boy conversions. They helped in creating new and original intellectual properties, including R.C. Pro-Am, a racing game with vehicular combat elements, and Snake Rattle 'n' Roll, an action platform game with Tim Stamper developing the game's graphics. Rare also developed Battletoads, a beat'em up inspired by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise. The game became known for its extreme difficulty, and upon seeing success, publisher Tradewest published multiple ports for the game, and tasked Rare to develop sequels. Tradewest also gave their own Double Dragon licence to Rare, allowing them to develop a crossover game between the two franchises. Rare released three Battletoads games in 1993, including Battletoads & Double Dragon: The Ultimate Team, Battletoads in Ragnarok's World and Battletoads in Battlemaniacs. The last Battletoads game from that era was released for the arcade in 1994. Several Battletoads games were also ported to some Sega's systems like the Mega Drive/Genesis. Rare worked on licensed properties such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Hollywood Squares, and ports including Marble Madness, Narc, and Sid Meier's Pirates!. The development of four of Rare's games were outsourced to Zippo Games, including Wizards & Warriors and the third instalment of the Jetpac series, Solar Jetman: Hunt for the Golden Warship. Rare eventually acquired Zippo Games and renamed them to Rare Manchester. According to Ste Pickford, a Rare team member through the late 80s and the early 90s, Rare just \\"wanted to make as many games as they could in their 'window of opportunity'\\". The huge library of games made large profits, but none became a critical success for the company while less creativity and innovation were shown in them. When the Super Nintendo Entertainment System was conceived, the Rare studio was not yet ready for the change. Rare limited their releases to some Battletoads games and decided to invest their significant NES profit in purchasing expensive Silicon Graphics workstations to make three-dimensional models. This move made Rare the most technologically advanced developer in the UK, and situated them high in the international market. Their priority also changed at that time, as the team decided to focus on quality instead of quantity. =Partnership with Nintendo (1994‚Äì2002)= Former Rare logo, used for the \\"Rareware\\" trademark (used from 1994‚Äì2003) Rare, using the SGI systems, created a boxing game demo and presented it to Nintendo. As the SNES at that time could not render all of the SGI graphics at once, Rare used the SGI graphics to produce 3D models and graphics, before pre-rendering these graphics onto the cartridge of the SNES system, a process known as \\"Advanced Computer Modelling\\". Their progress with the 3D graphics on the SGI systems impressed Nintendo, and in 1994, Nintendo bought a 25% stake in the company that gradually increased to 49%, making Rare a second-party developer for Nintendo. During this period, Rare started selling their games under the trademark name \\"Rareware\\". The company was considered one of Nintendo's key developers and had enough recognition that Nintendo offered the Rare studio the Nintendo catalogue of characters to create a 3D CGI game. The Stampers asked for Donkey Kong. The resulting game was Donkey Kong Country, which was developed by a total of 20 people and enjoyed an 18-month development cycle. Rare staff also visited Twycross Zoo, observing and videotaping real gorillas. The game was a critical success, with critics praising the game's highly advanced visuals and artstyle. Donkey Kong Country sold over eight million copies worldwide, making it the third best-selling game in the SNES library. The game received several Game of the Year honours and was followed by two sequels, Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest and Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!, as well as several handheld spin-offs such as the Donkey Kong Land series. Nintendo's stake purchase allowed Rare to expand significantly. The number of staff members increased from 84 to 250, and Rare moved out from their headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse. Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game, Killer Instinct, on their own custom-built arcade machine. Killer Instinct was set to be released for Nintendo's own 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64 in 1995, but was forced to release the game for the 16-bit SNES system, and had to downgrade the game's graphics. Killer Instinct sold 3.2 million copies, and was followed by a sequel, Killer Instinct 2. Killer Instinct Gold, the console version of Killer Instinct 2, suffered from a graphical downgrade due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge. Rare then developed Blast Corps for the Nintendo 64. The game sold one million copies, which was considered disappointing by Rare. At that time, Rare was split into several teams, working on different projects. A large- scaled platformer was set to be released afterwards but was delayed. As a result, Rare changed their schedule and released their smaller projects first. The first project was GoldenEye 007, a game based on the James Bond film GoldenEye. The project was led by Martin Hollis and development was conducted by an inexperienced team. Inspired by Sega's Virtua Cop, Goldeneye 007 had originally been an on-rail shooter before the team decided to expand the gameplay and turn it into a free-roaming first-person shooter. New elements, such as stealth, headshot mechanics and reloading, were introduced. A split- screen multiplayer was added to the game by the end of its development. GoldenEye 007 was the first console first-person shooter developed by Rare and it was released two years after the release of the film. The game received critical praise and received numerous awards. Goldeneye 007 remained one of the best-selling games for two years, and sold more than eight million units worldwide. Rare then developed Diddy Kong Racing, their first self-published game. Originally intended as a real-time strategy game involving cavemen, the game was re-imagined into a racing game prior to its release in 1997. It was one of the fastest selling games at the time, as recorded by The Guinness Book of Records. Diddy Kong Racing also features protagonists from some future Rare games, including Banjo and Conker. At the time, Rare was still working on the large-scale platform game. Originally codenamed Dream: Land of Giants, it was a game featuring a young boy named Edison and pirates. The protagonist was then replaced by a bear known as Banjo, and Rare expanded the role of Kazooie the bird. The two characters were inspired by characters from Walt Disney Animation Studios films and Rare hoped that they could appeal to a younger audience. Banjo-Kazooie was released in June 1998 to critical acclaim. A sequel, Banjo Tooie, was released in 2000. It was a critical success and it outsold the first game, selling 3 million copies. Upon the completion of Banjo-Kazooies development, Hollis immediately began another project. Originally set to be a tie-in for Tomorrow Never Dies, Rare was significantly outbid by another publisher, forcing Rare to develop a new concept with new characters. With a major emphasis on lighting, the game was named Perfect Dark. Hollis left Rare for Nintendo 14 months after the start of Perfect Darks development. Around the same time, numerous employees left the company and formed new studios. With major project leads departing, a new team took over its development and diminished the role of lighting in the game, making it a more straightforward first-person shooter. The game's troubled development did not affect the progress of Rare's other teams. When Perfect Dark was still in development, Rare released two other games, Jet Force Gemini and Donkey Kong 64. In 1999, Nintendo signed an agreement with Disney, and assigned Rare to develop several racing and adventure games featuring Mickey Mouse. The project later became Mickey's Speedway USA and Mickey Racing Adventure. Perfect Dark eventually resurfaced and it was released in 2000 to critical acclaim. The game sold approximately 2 million copies. Conker the Squirrel also had its own game. Originally named Conker's Quest, it was renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64. However, the new game was criticised for being too family-friendly and too similar to Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the team renamed the game to Conker's Bad Fur Day and was re-revealed again in 2000. Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was intended for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial failure as the game was released at the end of the Nintendo 64's life cycle and the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo. After the completion of Diddy Kong Racing, another team was working on a new game known as Dinosaur Planet for the Nintendo 64. However, Shigeru Miyamoto, a Nintendo executive, suggested the team to recreate the game for the Star Fox series for Nintendo's new console, the GameCube. Unlike previous Star Fox games, Star Fox Adventures focused on ground-based open world exploration. The game received positive reviews upon its launch in 2002. Star Fox Adventures was the only game developed by Rare for GameCube. =Microsoft era (2002‚Äìpresent)= Game development costs gradually increased, and Nintendo did not provide Rare with more capital nor did they purchase the company's remaining stake. The Stampers were surprised that Nintendo did not directly acquire the studio. Rare looked for potential buyers. In early 2000, workers from Activision and Microsoft began visiting Rare with purchase offers. According to Microsoft's Ed Fries, Nintendo, Activision, and Microsoft then became embroiled in a bidding war for ownership of Rare. Rare expressed interest in Activision's offer, but Microsoft offered more money. On 24 September 2002, Microsoft purchased Rare for $375 million. Rare became a first-party developer for Microsoft's Xbox. Character trademarks from games developed by Rare for Nintendo consoles, such as Conker of Conker's Bad Fur Day and Banjo of the Banjo-Kazooie series, were retained by Rare; intellectual property created by Nintendo, such as Donkey Kong and Star Fox, were retained by Nintendo. This left Donkey Kong Racing, due for release for the GameCube, unreleased. 30 employees left Rare during the transition. 2010‚Äì2015 Rare logo Since Microsoft was not part of the handheld video-game console market, Rare continued to develop games for Nintendo handheld consoles after the acquisition. In August 2003, Rare and Microsoft entered an agreement with THQ for Rare to publish games for the Game Boy Advance, including Sabre Wulf, a game based on an Ultimate character; Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty's Revenge, initially intended as a Game Boy Color game and It's Mr. Pants!, a puzzle game originally developed as Donkey Kong: Coconut Crackers. January 2005 saw the completion of this deal with the release of Banjo-Pilot, known as Diddy Kong Pilot before the Microsoft acquisition. In 2003, Rare released their first Microsoft game, Grabbed by the Ghoulies, a humorous action-adventure game set in a haunted mansion full of supernatural creatures. Originally intended as a free-roaming game, it was significantly streamlined in design and concept to attract a larger, more casual audience. The game received mixed reviews from critics, and was considered Rare's worst and least-popular game. At E3 2004, Microsoft's Ken Lobb said that Rare had obtained Nintendo DS development kits and was working on two games for the Nintendo DS. Shortly afterwards, Microsoft issued a statement that the company and its studios had no plans for Nintendo DS development. However, in July 2005, Rare posted job openings for Nintendo DS development on its website and said that it was creating \\"key\\" DS games. The first of these games was Diddy Kong Racing DS, a remake of the Nintendo 64 title Diddy Kong Racing which was released in February 2007. Rare released Conker: Live & Reloaded, a remake of Conker's Bad Fur Day, in 2005 with updated graphics and a reworked multiplayer option. The game received generally favourable reviews but, similar to Bad Fur Day, was a commercial failure. Xbox successor Xbox 360 was released in 2005, and two of its launch games were developed by Rare: Perfect Dark Zero and Kameo: Elements of Power. Zero, a prequel to the first Perfect Dark, was originally intended for GameCube before its redesign as an Xbox 360 game. Rare removed several features to meet the game's release deadline. Kameo: Elements of Power was also intended for the GameCube. A new intellectual property, in it the player character shape-shifts to solve puzzles. Although both received generally positive reviews from critics and sold more than a million copies, they were considered disappointments. In 2006, the company released Viva Pi√±ata, a game involving gardening. Incorporating elements of several franchises including The Sims, Animal Crossing, and Harvest Moon, it was acclaimed as innovative. The game's commercial performance was a disappointment, however, and some Rare team members questioned Microsoft Studios' large marketing budget for Gears of War and its relative neglect of Viva Pi√±ata. On 2 January 2007, Rare founders Chris and Tim Stamper left the company to \\"pursue other opportunities\\". Former lead designer Gregg Mayles became Rare's creative director and Mark Betteridge the company's studio director. That year saw the release of Jetpac Refuelled, a remake of Jetpac for Xbox Live Arcade. Rare focused on Kinect from 2009 to 2014 Rare unveiled work on Xbox Live avatars, Viva Pi√±ata: Trouble in Paradise (the next game in the Viva Pi√±ata series), and Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts in 2008. Made by the core team that developed the first Banjo-Kazooie, Nuts & Bolts received significant criticism from players due to its focus on vehicle construction rather than traditional platforming. Though generally receiving positive reviews, the company's games for Microsoft sold poorly and Microsoft decided to restructure the studio at the end of the decade. In March 2010, Rare opened a new facility at Fazeley Studios in Digbeth, Birmingham. Later that year, Microsoft confirmed that Scott Henson, a developer who had worked on the hardware and software designs of the Xbox 360 console and Kinect for Xbox 360, replaced Mark Betteridge as studio manager and announced a focus on Xbox Live avatars. Rare also shifted their focus to Kinect. According to Henson, \\"Kinect will be the main focus for Rare going forwards as it's a very rich canvas. This is just the beginning of an experience that will touch millions of people\\". Rare's first Kinect project, Kinect Sports, was released in November 2010. Originally titled Sports Star, a more-complex sports simulation game, the game was streamlined into what Microsoft executive Don Mattrick hoped would be the Kinect equivalent of Wii Sports. According to a former Rare employee, the team was worried about the game during its development because of Kinect's limitations. Its reviews were average, but it was a commercial success, selling three million units by May 2011. Rare and BigPark, another Microsoft studio, collaborated on the development of a sequel, Kinect Sports: Season Two. In March 2011, Scott Henson announced that Craig Duncan, who had worked on Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing and the Colin McRae Rally series, was hired as senior studio director. Simon Woodroffe, who had worked at several studios (including Adventure Soft, Midway Games, Ubisoft, and Sega), became the studio's creative director in April 2012. A Rare property, Killer Instinct, was revived in 2013. The company had a supporting role in its development, assisting lead developer Double Helix Games. Another Rare mascot, Conker, was also featured in another Microsoft game, Project Spark as episodic downloadable content. Known as Conker's Big Reunion, it was cancelled in 2015. Rare released Kinect Sports Rivals in 2014. The game was worked on by 150 staff members and a new game engine was developed for it. The game was a commercial failure and following Microsoft's announcement that Kinect would no longer be a priority, about 15 Rare employees were laid off. On 10 February 2015, a group of former Rare employees announced the formation of a new studio, Playtonic Games, and planned a \\"spiritual successor\\" to the Banjo-Kazooie franchise titled Yooka-Laylee, which was released on 11 April 2017 with mixed reviews. According to Rare composer Robin Beanland, the year 2015 would be significant for the company. At E3 2015, a new compilation game, Rare Replay celebrating the studio's 30th anniversary, was introduced; it was released in August. The compilation, with 30 of the studio's published games, only included games that Rare owned the intellectual property to. Rare Replay became the most pre-ordered game shown at E3 that year and received critical acclaim upon launch. A new game, Sea of Thieves, which was a multiplayer adventure game marketed as \\"The Best Game That Rare Has Ever Made\\", was introduced at E3 that year. It was delayed at the following year's conference and was released on 20 March 2018. The game received mixed reviews,https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/08/sea-of-thieves- release-date-march-20/ but was a commercial success; in January 2020, Microsoft declared it the most successful IP it released in the eighth generation, with more than 10 million players. Since 2018, Rare has been working with Dlala Studios on a Battletoads revival for the Xbox One and Windows. Microsoft and Rare also collaborated with Nintendo in 2019 to add Banjo and Kazooie as playable characters in the crossover Nintendo Switch fighting game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. At the X019 event in November 2019, Rare announced it was developing Everwild, an action-adventure game for Windows and Xbox Series X. Culture According to Mark Betteridge, one of Rare's main goals is to create games people will find enjoyable rather than just to earn profit. The Stamper brothers gave the team considerable creative freedom, although they would intervene if a product was technically flawed or under-performing. Some employees noted that working for Rare in its early days could be difficult, with staff members allowed 30 minutes for lunch and possibly working more than 60 hours a week. Nintendo worked closely with Rare, and their relationship was described as a \\"creative partnership\\" by Viva Pi√±ata designer Justin Cook. According to Hansen in 2010, innovation is very important to the company, thus they focus on trying out new technology, such as Xbox 360's Kinect. According to Duncan in 2014, Rare would only develop games that had unique ideas, and will never develop a generic game with their intellectual properties. Ed Fries, head of Microsoft Studios' publishing division at the time of acquisition, said that the company attempted to preserve Rare's culture so its staff could continue feeling that they worked for Rare rather than Microsoft. Rare employees differed about working conditions after the Microsoft acquisition. According to Star Fox Adventures lead engineer Phil Tossell, conditions became more stressful after an \\"imperceptible\\" start, and the culture of the two companies began clashing. Tossell said that Microsoft gradually imposed a corporate structure on Rare, including more performance reviews and meetings, to which some Rare members found difficulty in adapting. Some admitted that early changes, such as permitting team members to discuss projects they were not working on and allowing staff members to use the Internet or listen to music during work hours, were beneficial to team morale. Betteridge called the overall change \\"positive\\", saying that Microsoft's capital could help Rare develop their projects. Former Rare employee Gavin Price said that some Microsoft executives, such as Phil Spencer, were supportive of the developer. Grant Kirkhope, a former composer at Rare, strongly criticised Microsoft for ruining Rare. Former Xbox executive Peter Moore voiced his disappointment with Rare's works after the acquisition. He noted that Rare employees were attempting to \\"recreate the glory years\\", but their skills had become outdated and were no longer \\"applicable in today's market\\". Duncan insisted that there were still a lot of talented people working at Rare, and they will have a \\"bright future\\". Unlike other software developers, Rare acquired a reputation for secrecy; the approach to their office buildings, in Manor Park near Twycross, was monitored by cameras. Web video shows had been granted access in recent years, such as Eurogamer in November 2006. The company was internally divided into different \\"barnes\\", where employees worked exclusively on their group's game. According to Tim Stamper, Though normally secretive, Rare allowed several exclusive tours of its studio by fan sites Rarenet in 1999, and Rare-Extreme in 2004 and again in 2009. In 2010, Rare declined an offer by fansite MundoRare to film a documentary about their studios at MundoRare's expense. The film, to celebrate Rare's 25th anniversary, would have been distributed on the internet and Xbox Live. Rare refused permission to shoot the film, saying that it was not \\"on message\\". MundoRare was shut down, and stated that the site could not support the company's new corporate direction. Rare's secrecy was criticised by Hardcore Gamers Alex Carlson, as they thought that it made them \\"disconnected\\", and prompted them to develop games that \\"their fans don't want\\". When Duncan took over as the studio's head, he intended to change the culture of the studio. Rare's office was completely remodeled so as to facilitate idea sharing between team members. The studio also adopted a more open attitude to its community, with the studio inviting fans to take part in the development project of their latest game Sea of Thieves. Related companies Around 1997, a number of Rare employees left to establish separate companies. The first was Eighth Wonder, underwritten by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which did not produce any games before it closed. After Martin Hollis left Rare, he joined Nintendo before founding his own company Zoonami, releasing Zendoku, Go! Puzzle and Bonsai Barber. Other Perfect Dark team members, including David Doak and Steve Ellis, founded Free Radical Design and created the TimeSplitters series. It was acquired by Crytek and renamed Crytek UK before its 2014 closure, with most of its staff moving to Deep Silver Dambuster Studios. Former Free Radical and Rare staff also formed Crash Labs, a studio specialising in developing iOS games. Chris Seavor, director of Conker's Bad Fur Day, founded the Gory Detail studio along with Rare employee, Shawn Pile and is working on a 2D platform game called The Unlikely Legend of Rusty Pup. Starfire Studios were founded by four former Rare employees and released Fusion Genesis, an Xbox Live Arcade game published by Microsoft Game Studios. Another group of former Rare employees formed a mobile-game studio, Flippin Pixels. Former Rare employee Lee Schuneman headed Lift London, a Microsoft studio. Phil Tossell and Jennifer Schneidereit founded Nyamyam and released Tengami. Playtonic Games was founded by several former Rare employees; their first project is Yooka-Laylee, a spiritual successor to Banjo-Kazooie. Chris and Tim Stamper joined FortuneFish, a mobile game company founded by Tim Stamper's son, Joe Stamper. Their first game is That Bouncy Thing! The Rubbishiest Game Ever for Android. Games Rare has developed a number of video games since its founding, with sales nearing 90 million copies by 2002. The company is best known for its platform games, which include the Donkey Kong Country, Banjo-Kazooie, and Conker series, and for its Nintendo 64 first-person shooters GoldenEye 007 and Perfect Dark. Rare does not adhere to a few specific video-game genres. They have also developed action-adventure games, including Star Fox Adventures and Kameo: Elements of Power; fighting games, such as the Killer Instinct series; racing games, such as R.C. Pro-Am and Diddy Kong Racing, and beat 'em up-shoot 'em up games such as Battletoads and Captain Skyhawk. Since Rare has usually been associated with a video-game console manufacturer (such as Nintendo and Microsoft), most of their games have been developed for a particular platform. Since E3 2015, Rare has been working on Sea of Thieves, a pirate-themed MMO for Xbox One and Windows 10. At Microsoft's X019 event, a fantasy action-adventure title called Everwild was announced. The company's cancelled projects include Dream: Land of Giants, which became Banjo-Kazooie; Perfect Dark Core, originally the sequel to the first Perfect Dark; Black Widow, an open world game that tasks players to control an eight-legged robot; Sundown, which featured a horde-like survival mode; The Fast And The Furriest, a mascot racer; Tailwind, an action game featuring helicopters; Urchin, a Fable-style game which began development after the completion of Live & Reloaded; Ordinary Joe; Savannah, a Kinect- based game; Kinect equivalents of Wii Fit and Professor Layton, a sequel to Diddy Kong Racing, and a sequel to Kameo: Elements of Power. Awards Rare received numerous awards, including BAFTA award for \\"Best UK Developer\\" for its work on GoldenEye 007. In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly named Rare \\"Most Promising Game Company\\", citing their high rate of success in putting out killer apps for the Nintendo 64. Rare was awarded the BAFTA Interactive Entertainment Moving Images Award in 2000 for developing Perfect Dark. Tim and Chris Stamper were named as Development Legends in the 2015 Develop Industry Excellence Awards. Rare was included as Gamasutra's Top 30 Developers of All Time, and was ranked as the 36th best video game maker by IGN. The Herbert Art Gallery and Museum curated a retrospective of the company's work in 2018.

Disintermediation is the removal of intermediaries in economics from a supply chain, or \\"cutting out the middlemen\\" in connection with a transaction or a series of transactions.Wake Forest. Infinite Financial Intermediation. page 50. Law Review 643 (2015) Instead of going through traditional distribution channels, which had some type of intermediary (such as a distributor, wholesaler, broker, or agent), companies may now deal with customers directly, for example via the Internet. Disintermediation may decrease the total cost of servicing customers and may allow the manufacturer to increase profit margins and/or reduce prices. Disintermediation initiated by consumers is often the result of high market transparency, in that buyers are aware of supply prices direct from the manufacturer. Buyers may choose to bypass the middlemen (wholesalers and retailers) to buy directly from the manufacturer, and pay less. Buyers can alternatively elect to purchase from wholesalers. Often, a business-to-consumer electronic commerce (B2C) company functions as the bridge between buyer and manufacturer. However manufacturers will still incur distribution costs, such as the physical transport of goods, packaging in small units, advertising, and customer helplines, some or all of which would previously have been borne by the intermediary. To illustrate, a typical B2C supply chain is composed of four or five entities. These are the supplier, manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer and buyer. History The term was originally applied to the banking industry in 1967; disintermediation occurred when consumers avoided the intermediation of banks by investing directly in securities (government and private bonds, insurance companies, hedge funds, mutual funds and stocks) rather than leaving their money in savings accounts.Gellman, R. (1996). Disintermediation and the Internet. Government information quarterly, 13(1), 1-8. The original cause was a U.S. government regulation (Regulation Q) which limited the interest rate paid on interest bearing accounts that were insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. It was later applied more generally to \\"cutting out the middleman\\" in commerce, though the financial meaning remained predominant. Only in the late 1990s did it become widely popularized. Impact of Internet- related disintermediation upon various industries It has been argued that the Internet modifies the supply chain due to market transparency. Disintermediation has acquired a new meaning with the advent of the virtual marketplace. The virtual marketplace sellers like Amazon are edging out the middlemen. Direct sellers and buyers connect with each other because of the platform created by the virtual marketplace vendor. There is quid pro quo for the vendor for the use of the platform, else it would make no business sense to create such a platform. If the buyer, having connected with the seller, circumvents the platform and talks to the seller and does her deal directly with the seller, then the platform owner is unlikely to get her revenue share. This may be considered a new form of disintermediation. =Discussion= In the non-Internet world, disintermediation has been an important strategy for many big box retailers like Walmart, which attempt to reduce prices by reducing the number of intermediaries between the supplier and the buyer. Disintermediation is also closely associated with the idea of just in time manufacturing, as the removal of the need for inventory removes one function of an intermediary. The existence of laws which discourage disintermediation has been cited as a reason for the poor economic performance of Japan and Germany in the 1990s. However, Internet-related disintermediation occurred less frequently than many expected during the dot com boom. Retailers and wholesalers provide essential functions such as the extension of credit, aggregation of products from different suppliers, and processing of returns. In addition, shipping goods to and from the manufacturer can in many cases be far less efficient than shipping them to a store where the consumer can pick them up (if the consumer's trip to the store is ignored). In response to the threat of disintermediation, some retailers have attempted to integrate a virtual presence and a physical presence in a strategy known as bricks and clicks. Reintermediation Reintermediation can be defined as the reintroduction of an intermediary between end users (consumers) and a producer. This term applies especially to instances in which disintermediation has occurred first. At the start of the Internet revolution, electronic commerce was seen as a tool of disintermediation for cutting operating costs. The concept was that by allowing consumers to purchase products directly from producers via the Internet, the product delivery chain would be drastically shortened, thereby \\"disintermediating\\" the standard supply model middlemen. However, what largely happened was that new intermediaries appeared in the digital landscape (e.g., Amazon.com and eBay). Sarkar, Butler and Steinfield. Intermediaries and Cybermediaries: A Continuing Role for Mediating Players in the Electronic Marketplace. 1995. Reintermediation occurred due to many new problems associated with the e-commerce disintermediation concept, largely centered on the issues associated with the direct-to-consumers model. The high cost of shipping many small orders, massive customer service issues, and confronting the wrath of disintermediated retailers and supply channel partners all presented real obstacles. Huge resources are required to accommodate presales and postsales issues of individual consumers. Before disintermediation, supply chain middlemen acted as salespeople for the producers. Without them, the producer itself would have to handle procuring those customers. Selling online has its own associated costs: developing quality websites, maintaining product information, and marketing expenses all add up. Finally, limiting a product's availability to Internet channels forces the producer to compete with the rest of the Internet for customers' attention, a space that is becoming increasingly crowded. =Examples of companies= Notable examples of disintermediation include Dell and Apple, which sell many of their systems direct to the consumer--thus bypassing traditional retail chains, having succeeded in creating brands well recognized by customers, profitable and with continuous growth.

Arkansas is most noted for her actions in the Western Theater, when she steamed through a United States Navy fleet at Vicksburg on 15 July 1862 during the American Civil War. She was set on fire and destroyed by her crew after her engines broke down on 6 August. Her remains lie under a levee near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. History =Construction= Building the Arkansas Her keel was laid down at Memphis, Tennessee, by John T. Shirley in October 1861.Still, Iron afloat, p. 62. In April 1862, Arkansas was moved to Greenwood, Mississippi, on the Yazoo River, to prevent her capture when Memphis fell to the Union Navy. Her sister ship, CSS Tennessee, was burned on the stocks because she was not near enough to completion to be launched.Soley, James Russell, \\"The Union and Confederate Navies,\\" Battles and Leaders, v. 1, p. 629. In May 1862 Capt. Isaac N. Brown of the Confederate States Navy received orders at Vicksburg from the Navy Department in Richmond, to proceed to Greenwood, and there assume command of Arkansas. His orders were to finish and equip the vessel. When Captain Brown arrived, he found a mere hull, without armor, engines in pieces, and guns without carriages. Supplies of railroad iron, intended as armor for the ship, were lying at the bottom of the river. A recovery mission was ordered, and the armor was pulled up out of the mud. Captain Brown then had Arkansas towed to Yazoo City, Mississippi, where he pressed into service local craftsmen, and also got the assistance of 200 soldiers from the Confederate army as construction crews.Still, Iron afloat, p. 65. After five strenuous weeks of labor under the hot summer sun, the ship had to leave due to falling river levels. She had been fully outfitted, except for the curved armor intended to surround her stern and pilot house. Boiler plate was stuck on these areas \\"for appearances' sake.\\" =Breaking through to Vicksburg= During this time, the Federal Navy had attacked Vicksburg with a large force made up of a squadron of ships, under Flag Officer David G. Farragut, that had come up from the Gulf of Mexico and a flotilla of United States Army gunboats and rams, under Flag Officer Charles H. Davis, from upriver. Soon thereafter, General Earl Van Dorn, commanding the Confederate Army forces at Vicksburg, and as such in control of Arkansas, ordered Captain Brown to bring his ship down to the city. Brown filled out the crew of Arkansas with more than 100 sailors from vessels on the Mississippi, plus about 60 Missouri soldiers. Capt. William Pratt Parks was chosen to command the gun on the larboard side. Brown stated, \\"The only trouble they ever gave me was to keep them from running Arkansas into the Union fleet before we were ready for battle.\\" He then set sail for Vicksburg and the Union fleet. Capt. Parks had enlisted in Woodruff's Battery, Arkansas Light Artillery. Transferred east, Parks was elected First Lieut. in Co. H (Hoadley's Arkansas Battery), 1st Tennessee Heavy Artillery Regiment. Co. H. was transferred from Fort Pillow to Vicksburg and became part of new Co. B (composed of Hoadley's (old) Co. H, along with (old) Cos. A and G and part of (old) Co. C. Parks was selected to serve as Capt. of Co. B while serving aboard Arkansas as commander of the larboard gun. Parks would later sink while in command of Co. B. as part of the Upper Water Battery defense of Vicksburg. Arkansas running through the Federal fleet above Vicksburg, Mississippi, on 15 July 1862 After approximately , it was discovered that steam from the boilers had leaked into the forward magazine and rendered the gunpowder wet and useless. Captain Brown and his men found a clearing along the bank of the Yazoo River, landed the wet powder and spread it out on tarpaulins in the sun to dry. With constant stirring and shaking the powder was dry enough to ignite by sundown. Arkansas proceeded on her way.Brown, Isaac N., \\"The Confederate gun-boat Arkansas\\", Battles and leaders,, v. 3, pp. 572‚Äì573. Shortly after sunrise on 15 July 1862, three Federal vessels were sighted steaming towards Arkansas‚Äîthe ironclad , the wooden gunboat , and the ram . The Federal vessels turned downriver, and a running battle ensued. Carondelet was quickly disabled with a shot through her steering mechanism, causing her to run aground. Attention was turned to Tyler and the ram, which ran for their fleet with Arkansas pursuing. Soon the Federal fleet came into view around the river bend above Vicksburg, \\"a forest of masts and smokestacks.\\" Captain Brown determined to steam as close to the enemy vessels as possible in order to prevent his vessel being rammed and to sow confusion. The Federal ships were largely immobile, as they did not have their steam up. They and Arkansas exchanged shots at close range, but she soon passed to safety beyond them. Arkansas arrived at Vicksburg to the sound of enthusiastic cheering from the citizens and within sight of the lower Federal fleet.Brown, Isaac N., \\"The Confederate gun-boat Arkansas\\", Battles and Leaders, pp. 575‚Äì576. That night, Farragut's fleet ran past the batteries at Vicksburg and attempted to destroy Arkansas while doing so. They did not move until so late in the day, however, that they could not see their target. Only one shell hit home, killing two men and wounding three.Still, Iron Afloat, p. 72. Although Arkansas did not destroy any enemy vessels, she inflicted losses among the personnel of the Federal fleets. In the engagement on the Yazoo and her passage of the fleet at Vicksburg, their total loss was 18 killed, 50 wounded, and an additional 10 missing (probably drowned).ORN I, v. 19, pp. 4, 7. Farragut's fleet lost another 5 killed and 9 wounded when they ran past the Vicksburg batteries.ORN I, v. 19, p. 8. The cost to Arkansas for the entire day's action was 12 killed and 18 wounded.ORN I, v. 19, p. 69. The list of wounded is obviously incomplete; Brown himself is not listed, although he is known to have suffered a head wound. =Under the Vicksburg bluffs= Arkansas, as the vessel appeared to readers of the New York Tribune, July 31, 1862 After repairs, Arkansas again appeared to threaten her enemies, forcing them to keep up steam 24 hours a day in the hottest part of the summer. To remove the problem, the Union fleet tried once again to destroy the ironclad at her mooring. At this time, the severely reduced crew of Arkansas could man only three guns, so she depended for protection on the shore batteries. On the morning of 22 July, , Queen of the West, and mounted an ill-coordinated attack. First Essex attempted to ram, but as she approached, the Arkansas crew were able to spring her. As a result, Essex missed her target and ran aground instead, where for ten minutes she remained under fire from both Arkansas and the shore batteries. The armor on Essex protected her crew, however, so she lost only one man killed and three wounded. On the other hand, one of her shots penetrated the iron plating on Arkansas, killing six and wounding six. When Essex worked off the bank, she continued downstream, where she joined Farragut's squadron. Meanwhile, Queen of the West was making her run. Her captain misjudged her speed, so she ran past Arkansas and had to come back and ram upstream. Although she struck fairly, her reduced momentum meant that the collision did little damage. She then returned to the flotilla above the city. She had been riddled by shot from the batteries, but surprisingly suffered no serious casualties. Farragut had already been pressing the Navy Department for permission to leave Vicksburg. It was clear that he would need assistance from the Army to capture the city, assistance that was not forthcoming. Sickness among his sailors, unacclimatised to the heat of summer in Mississippi, reduced their fighting strength by as much as a third. Furthermore, the annual drop in the level of the river threatened to strand his deep-draft ships. The constant vigilance now necessitated by the presence of Arkansas finally tipped the balance. He got permission to return to the vicinity of New Orleans, and on 24 July his fleet left.Still, Iron afloat, pp. 74‚Äì75. With nothing his flotilla could do, Davis also withdrew. He took his vessels back to Helena, where he could still watch the river north of Vicksburg. =Final fight at Baton Rouge= Illustration of the Arkansas burning while under fire from , Harper's Weekly, 5 September 1862 With the Federal fleet gone, Captain Brown requested and was granted four days of leave, which he took in Grenada. Before leaving, he pointed out to General Van Dorn that the engines of his ship needed repairs before she could be used. He also gave positive orders to his executive officer, Lieut. Henry K. Stevens, not to move her until he returned. Unfortunately for the ship, Van Dorn disregarded his subordinate. He ordered Lieut. Stevens to take Arkansas down to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she would support an attack on the Union position there by a Confederate army force led by General John C. Breckinridge. Stevens demurred, citing his orders from Brown, and referred the question to \\"a senior officer of the Confederate navy.\\" The \\"senior officer\\" chose not to intervene. Stevens, now under the orders of two superior officers, had to rush the ship down the river.The \\"senior officer\\" was Flag Officer William F. Lynch. Brown did not forgive Lynch for his witless acquiescence to Van Dorn, and pointedly refused even to name him when he wrote his memoir years later. Brown, Isaac N., \\"The Confederate gun-boat Arkansas\\", Battles and Leaders, v. 3, p. 579. Confirming Brown's fears, the engines broke down several times between Vicksburg and Baton Rouge. Each time, the engineer was able to get them running again, but it was clear that they were unreliable. Nevertheless, the ship was able to get all the way to Baton Rouge, where she prepared for battle with a small Federal flotilla that included her old opponent USS Essex. On the morning of 6 August, Essex came in sight, and Arkansas moved into the stream to meet her. Just at this time, crank pins on both engines failed almost simultaneously, and Arkansas drifted helplessly to the shore. Stevens prepared to abandon ship. He ordered the engines to be broken up, the guns to be loaded and excess shells spread around, and then the ship set afire. The crew then left. About this time, the ship broke free and began to drift down the river, and Stevens, the last man to leave, had to swim ashore. The burning vessel drifted down among the attacking Federal fleet, which watched from a respectful distance. At about noon, Arkansas blew up.Still, Iron Afloat, pp. 76‚Äì78. The motions of Arkansas just before the final breakdown of her engines are not clear. See Still's note on page 77. Wreck The wreck of the Arkansas rests deep under the levee on a north/south heading about south from the auto/railroad bridge at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, below Mile 233.\\"Search for the Ironclads: The Expedition to Find the Confederate Ironclads Manassas, Louisiana, and Arkansas\\".

It is made by a natural culturing and controlled fermentation process that binds soybeans into a cake form. Here a special fungus is used, which has the Latin name Rhizopus oligosporus, usually marketed under the name tempeh starter. Tempeh being sold in a traditional market in Indonesia It is especially popular on the island of Java, where it is a staple source of protein. Like tofu, tempeh is made from soybeans, but it is a whole soybean product with different nutritional characteristics and textural qualities. Tempeh's fermentation process and its retention of the whole bean give it a higher content of protein, dietary fiber, and vitamins. It has a firm texture and an earthy flavor, which becomes more pronounced as it ages. Etymology The etymology of the term tempe itself is suggested to be derived from Old Javanese tumpi, a whitish food made from fried batter made from sago or rice flour which resembles rempeyek. Historian Denys Lombard suggests however that it is linked to the local term tape or tapai which means \\"fermentation\\". History Tempe being sold on Java, early 20th century Tempeh originated in Indonesia, almost certainly in Java, more precisely central or east Java, with an estimated discovery between a few centuries ago to a thousand years or more. Around the 12th to 13th century, a type of food was mentioned as kad√™l√™ in an old Javanese manuscript, Serat Sri Tanjung. However, it is not clear whether kad√™l√™ refers to processed fermented soy or not, since the term in Javanese today refers to \\"soybeans\\". The earliest known reference to it as t√™mp√™ appeared in 1815 in the Serat Centhini. The invention of tempeh is connected to tofu production in Java. The tofu-making industry was introduced to Java by Chinese immigrants circa the 17th century. Chinese Indonesian historian Ong Hok Ham suggests that tempeh was accidentally produced as the by-product of the tofu industry in Java; as discarded soybeans caught the spores of a whitish fungus that was found to be edible. Three detailed, fully documented histories of tempeh, worldwide, have been written, all by Shurtleff and Aoyagi (1985, 1989, and 2001). Production Making tempeh by wrapping boiled soybeans in banana leaves Tempeh begins with whole soybeans, which are softened by soaking, and dehulled, then partly cooked. Specialty tempeh may be made from other types of beans, wheat, or may include a mixture of beans and whole grains. The principal step in making tempeh is the fermentation of soybeans which undergo inoculation with Rhizopus spp. molds, a type of filamentous fungus most widely used for the production of tempeh. A fermentation starter containing the spores of fungus Rhizopus oligosporus or Rhizopus oryzae is mixed in. The beans are spread into a thin layer and are allowed to ferment for 24 to 36 hours at a temperature around 30¬∞C (86¬∞F). The soybeans have to cool down to allow spore germination and abundant growth of mycelium. Later, the temperature of the beans will naturally rise and rapid mold growth happens for around 4 hours. As mold growth declines, the soybeans should be bound into a solid mass by the mycelium. In good tempeh, the beans are knitted together by a mat of white mycelium. Typically, tempeh is harvested after 48 hours of fermentation with its distinguishable whitish color, firm texture, and nutty flavor. Extended fermentation time results in an increase in pH and undesirable color darkening in the tempeh. During the fermentation process, optimal time of fermentation, temperature, oxygen, humidity, and pH levels are required to encourage the growth of the Rhizopus mold, while discouraging the growth of undesired microorganisms. The pH level should be kept around 3-5 by adding a mild acidulant such as vinegar, lactic acid, or acetic acid, thereby favoring mold growth and restricting the growth of spoilage microorganisms. Oxygen is required for Rhizopus spp. growth, but should be maintained at low levels to prevent the production of undesired microorganisms. Under conditions of lower temperature, or higher ventilation, gray or black patches of spores may form on the surface‚Äîthis is not harmful, and should not affect the flavor or quality of the tempeh. This sporulation is normal on fully mature tempeh. A mild ammonia smell may accompany good tempeh as it ferments, but it should not be overpowering. Traditional tempeh is often produced in Indonesia using Hibiscus tiliaceus leaves. The undersides of the leaves are covered in downy hairs (known technically as trichomes) to which the mold Rhizopus oligosporus can be found adhering in the wild. Soybeans are pressed into the leaf, and stored. Fermentation occurs resulting in tempeh. In particular, the tempeh undergoes salt-free aerobic fermentation. = Determining quality = Once tempeh is produced, it is divided into three categories based on its quality: good, unfinished, and inedible. Good tempeh includes beans that are bound into a firm, compact cake by a dense, uniform, white mycelium, which should permeate the entire cake; the beans should be barely visible. The odor of good tempeh should be pleasant, clean, subtly sweet or resemble the aroma of mushrooms. The entire tempeh should lift as a single, cohesive cake without crumbling when shaken gently. Unfinished tempeh has beans that are bound together loosely by a sparse white mycelium, hence it crumbles easily. Unfinished tempeh should be incubated longer unless it has been incubated more than 8 hours past the recommended time. If it has been incubated for enough time and still remains unfinished, it should be discarded. Inedible tempeh has beans with foul odor, resembling strong ammonia or alcohol, indicating the development of undesirable bacteria due to excess moisture or overheating. Inedible tempeh cake is wet, slimy, and mushy with a collapsed structure. Its color is tan to brown and mold develops in sparse patches. = Packaging = Tempeh traditionally wrapped inside organic banana leaf package. Food grade wrapping paper and perforated polyethylene bags are the most suitable materials for packaging tempeh. They have demonstrated good retention of the quality of tempeh and extension of the shelf life of tempeh for three days compared to fresh tempeh. Appropriate packaging is important as it provides optimum oxygen supply and temperature for inoculation and fermentation to occur during processing. Tempeh is a perishable food and must be wrapped and placed into the refrigerator or freezer immediately after incubation or other processing steps such as blanching. In the refrigerator or freezer, stacking of tempeh should be minimized to prevent overheating and the undesirable, gradual continuation of fermentation, both of which shorten the storage life of tempeh. Even under cold temperature, tempeh continues to respire and undergo slow decomposition from microorganisms and its natural enzymes. Therefore, tempeh should be well cooled for at least two to five hours in a cooler before they undergo further packaging. Tempeh packaged in perforated polyethylene bags is usually repacked inside another labeled, non-perforated bag for distribution and sale, and for easier labeling. If the tempeh is only packaged in one perforated bag, the label must be directly attached to the perforated surface with the use of government food contact approved adhesive. They are then bulk packed in cartons and returned to the refrigerator or freezer to await shipment. Nutrition The soy carbohydrates in tempeh become more digestible as a result of the fermentation process. In particular, the oligosaccharides associated with gas and indigestion are greatly reduced by the Rhizopus culture. In traditional tempeh-making shops, the starter culture often contains beneficial bacteria that produce vitamins such as B12 (though it is uncertain whether this B12 is always present and bioavailable). In western countries, it is more common to use a pure culture containing only Rhizopus oligosporus, which makes very little B12 and could be missing Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, which have been shown to produce significant levels of B12 analogs in tempeh when present. Whether these analogs are true, bioavailable B12 has not been thoroughly studied yet. The fermentation process also reduces the phytic acid in soy, which in turn allows the body to absorb the minerals that soy provides. Preparation Tempeh burger In the kitchen, tempeh is often simply prepared by cutting it into pieces, soaking in brine or a salty sauce, and then fried. In Java, tempeh is often traditionally prepared by cutting it into pieces, marinated in a mixture of ground garlic, coriander and turmeric, salt and water; then deep fried, and often served with sambal ulek chili paste. Cooked tempeh can be eaten alone, or used in chili, stir fries, soups, salads, sandwiches, and stews. Tempeh's complex flavor has been described as nutty, meaty, and mushroom-like. It freezes well, and is now commonly available in many western supermarkets, as well as in ethnic markets and health food stores. Tempeh can be steamed, marinated, thinly sliced, blackened, or crumbled into sauces and stews. Tempeh performs well in a cheese grater, after which it may be used in the place of ground beef (as in tacos). When thin-sliced and deep-fried in oil, tempeh obtains a crisp golden crust while maintaining a soft interior. Its sponge-like consistency makes it suitable for marinating. Dried tempeh (whether cooked or raw) is more portable and less perishable and may be used as a stew base. Sometimes when tempeh is diced and left, they will create white feathery fluff which bonds the cut‚Äîthis is the Rhizopus mold still growing‚Äîthis is normal and perfectly edible. Types Sliced tempe kedelai (soy tempe) The most common tempeh is made from fermented soybeans. However, traditionally other ingredients such as ampas tahu (tofu dregs/okara), ampas kelapa (coconut dregs) and peanuts may be used in a fashion similar to the tempeh making process, although perhaps using different fungi or attracting other microbes. =Tempeh kedelai= Also called tempeh kedele or tempeh dele, or simply just tempeh. The most common and widely known tempeh, made from controlled fermentation of soybeans. =Tempeh gembus= Tempe gembus Soft and fluffy tempeh made from soy pulp or tofu dregs. Tempeh gembus usually can be found in traditional markets of Java, at a price lower than that of common soybean tempeh. It is made into a variety of dishes; for example it can be battered and/or fried, used in sayur lodeh, or tempeh bacem. Tempeh gembus is known by different names across Java; for example as tahu cokol or tahu susur in Temanggung. =Oncom= Tempeh oncom, or simply onchom, is made from peanut press cake or soy dregs. Among fermented bean products, oncom is more prevalent in West Java, where it serves as the main ingredient in various Sundanese cuisine traditional dishes, including oncom goreng, oncom leunca, and nasi tutug oncom. There are two types of oncom: a bright red-orange kind with Neurospora sitophila, and a black one with the same fungi as tempeh uses. =Tempeh menjes kacang= Menjes kacang A specialty of Malang, the rough textured tempeh menjes kacang is made from black soybeans mixed with other ingredients, such as peanut dregs, cassava fiber, and soybean meal. The process of making menjes kacang is quite similar to black oncom. =Tempe bongkr√®k= Tempeh bongkr√®k is a variety of tempeh from Central Java, notably Banyumas regency, that is prepared with coconut dregs. This type of tempeh has led to several cases of fatal food poisoning, as it occasionally gets contaminated with the bacterium Burkholderia gladioli, and the unwanted organism produces toxins (bongkrek acid and toxoflavin) from the coconut, besides killing off the Rhizopus fungus due to the antibiotic activity of bongkrek acid. Fatalities from contaminated tempeh bongkr√®k were once common in the area where it was produced. Thus, its sale is now prohibited by law; clandestine manufacture continues, however, due to the popular flavor. The problem of contamination is not encountered with bean and grain tempeh, which have a different composition of fatty acids that is not favorable for the growth of B. gladioli, but encourages growth of Rhizopus instead. When bean or grain tempeh has the proper color, texture and smell, it is a very strong indication the product is safe. Yellow tempeh bongkr√®k is always highly toxic due to toxoflavin, but tempeh bongkr√®k with a normal coloration may still contain lethal amounts of bongkrek acid. =Oat tempeh= A new form of tempeh based on barley and oats instead of soy was developed by scientists at the Swedish Department of Food Science in 2008. It can be produced in climatic regions where it is not possible to grow soybeans.  Process  Sayur lodeh often have almost rotten tempe mixed in to add flavor Sometimes tempeh is left to ferment further, creating a pungently stronger \\"almost rotten\\" tempeh called tempeh semangit in Javanese. The wrappings used in tempeh making can contribute to its flavor and aroma. Though some prefer the traditional banana, waru or teak leaf, readily available plastic sheet wrappings have been increasingly widely used. =Common tempeh= Common soybean tempeh that has undergone sufficient fermentation process. =Tempeh semangit= In Indonesia, ripe tempeh (two or more days old) is considered a delicacy. Names include tempeh semangit (\\"stinky tempeh\\") in Java, hampir busuk (\\"almost rotten\\") tempeh or tempeh kemarin (\\"yesterday tempeh\\"). Having a slightly pungent aroma, small amounts are used as a flavoring agent in traditional Javanese sayur lodeh vegetable stew and nasi tumpang. =Tempeh g√≥dh√≥ng= Tempeh g√≥dh√≥ng jati (wrapped in teak leaf) In Javanese language, the term g√≥dh√≥ng means \\"leaf\\". Traditionally tempeh is wrapped in organic banana leaf, daun waru (Hibiscus tiliaceus leaf) or daun jati (teak leaf). =Tempeh murni= Pure soybean cake, tempeh made in plastic wrap without any fillings or additives such as grated raw papaya. This was meant to create a more \\"hygienic and pure\\" tempeh free from any impurities or unwanted microbes.  Cooking methods and recipes  Saut√©ed tempeh with string green beans, an Indonesian dish The simplest way to cook tempeh is by frying. It is both deep-fried and stir-fried. However, there are several cooking methods and recipe variations. Among others are: =Tempeh goreng= Probably the simplest and most popular way to prepare tempeh in Indonesia. The tempeh is sliced and seasoned in a mixture of ground garlic, coriander seeds and salt, and then deep fried in palm oil. The tempe might be coated in batter prior to frying, or directly fried without any batter. =Tempeh bacem= Tempeh bacem is a traditional Javanese dish originating in Central Java. Bacem is a Javanese cooking method of braising in spices and palm sugar. The tempeh is first braised in a mixture of coconut water, palm sugar, and spices including coriander seeds, shallots, galangal, and bay leaves, and then briefly deep-fried. The result is a moist, sweet and spicy, dark-colored tempeh. Tofu may also be used, yielding tahu bacem. =Tempeh mendoan= Frying tempeh mendoan Cooked tempeh garit/goreng(fried) This variation is often found in Purwokerto. The word mendoan originates in the Banyumas regional dialect, and means \\"flash-fried\\". The tempeh is first dipped in spiced flour before quickly frying in very hot oil, resulting in a product that is cooked on the outside, but raw or only partially so on the inside. It has a limp, soft texture compared to the more common, crisp, fully fried tempeh. =Tempeh kering= Also known as kering tempeh (lit: \\"dry tempeh\\"), or sambal goreng tempeh if mixed with plenty of hot and spicy sambal chili pepper sauce. It is a crispy, sweet and spicy, fried tempeh. The raw tempeh is cut into small sticks and thoroughly deep- fried until no longer moist, and then mixed with palm sugar, chili pepper or other spices, or with sweet soy sauce. Often it is mixed with separately fried peanuts and anchovies (ikan teri). This dry tempeh will keep for up to a month if cooked and stored properly. =Tempeh orek or orak-arik tempeh= This variation is almost identical to tempeh kering, but is more soft and moist. The sweet taste is due to generous addition of kecap manis (sweet soy sauce). =Tumis tempeh or oseng tempeh= Stir-fried tempeh with vegetables such as green bean, basil, or onion, with spices. Other recipes might add coconut milk for a milky-colored, and rather moist, stir-fried tempeh. =Tempeh penyet= Fried tempeh mixed with sambal chili paste in a mortar and pestle. Usually served in addition to other penyet dishes, such as ayam penyet (chicken) or iga penyet (ribs). =Tempeh satay= Tempeh skewered and grilled as satay. Sate kere (Javanese for \\"poorman's satay\\") from Solo in Central Java is made from fluffy tempeh gembus. Ground tempeh can also be made into a thick sauce, such as in sate ambal, a chicken satay from Kebumen, Central Java where tempeh flavored with chili and spices replaces the more common peanut sauce. =Kripik tempeh= Kripik tempeh snack crackers; a thinly sliced tempeh, battered and deep fried until crispy. It is popular across Java, but notably produced in Bandung, West Java. =Grilled tempeh= Grilled tempeh over charcoal or fire. =Tempeh sandwich or tempeh burger= Fried, grilled or otherwise cooked tempeh patties, sandwiched between slices of bread or hamburger buns with salad, sauces or seasonings.

It is neither acidic nor does it contain significant amounts of alcohol. It, however, does possess stronger resistance to lipid peroxidation than unfermented soybeans due to its antioxidant contents.Umm al- Qura University, Mecca, Saudi Arabia Handbook of Fermented Functional Foods Cooked as tempeh kering, the deep fried and seasoned bits of tempeh can last for a month or more and still be good to consume, if cooked correctly and stored properly in air-tight jar. The deep frying process removes the moisture, preventing further fermentation and deterioration, thus prolonging its shelf life. = Antimicrobial agents = Rhizopus oligosporus culture responsible for the fermentation of tempeh from soybean produces natural, heat stable antimicrobial agents against spoilage and disease-causing microorganisms, extending the shelf life of the fermented product through microbial antagonism. The mold is capable of inhibiting the growth of other fungi such as Aspergiluus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus by interfering with the accumulation of aflatoxin (especially aflatoxin B1), the mycotoxin of greatest concern. R. oligosporus has also been reported to produce four to five antibacterial substances during fermentation process. It produces phenolic compounds against pathogenic bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori and an antibacterial protein has been identified with activities against Bacillus species (especially against Bacillus subtilis), Staphylococcus aureus, and Steptococcus cremoris. = Non-refrigerated fresh tempeh = Tempeh can be sold and consumed fresh within 48 hours once removed from its incubator. It is commonly transported to the market in its incubation container (e.g. polyethylene bag, banana leaf wrapper, etc.) and placed in the shade. In areas with warmer climates, tempeh can be kept at room temperature for 1‚Äì3 days before it becomes overripe. In locations with more temperate temperatures, it can keep for 1‚Äì4 days but will usually need to be refrigerated to prevent spoilage. = Refrigeration = Fresh refrigerated tempeh should be sealed in a labeled polyethylene bag and kept in temperatures below . It can be kept at this temperature for 3‚Äì5 days and sometimes, even as long as a week. Storage life could be extended to 2 or 3 weeks if the tempeh is blanched or steamed prior to refrigeration due to the inactivation of enzymes and destruction of bacteria. = Freezing = Freezing is the preferred way to preserve tempeh due to its capability for wide distribution. Tempeh can be frozen whole or in slices, depending on preference. During the freezing process, whole tempeh is placed in its perforated wrapper whereas sliced tempeh is packaged in a labelled polyethylene bag prior to being sealed in an outer bag and then frozen immediately. This method will keep for months with only a small loss of texture and flavor. = Blanching = Blanching tempeh by steaming or parboiling helps to extend the storage life by preventing bacterial growth, stopping mold growth and inactivating enzymes. Steaming appears to have a less negative effect than parboiling in terms of texture, flavor and nutritional value. Blanching is a great method for preserving tempeh prior to refrigeration, though not as beneficial for tempeh that is to be frozen. = Dehydration =  Air tray drying  Tempeh can be dried via the air tray drying method. Cubes of tempeh placed on steel, mesh bottom trays are dried by the circulating hot air dryer. After the product is finished, they can be cut into squares at for 90 to 120 minutes in order to reduce moisture content to 2-4%. When placed in moisture proof Pliofilm bags, the tempeh has a shelf life of several months at room temperature. Although this is a convenient method that produces a shelf stable product without requirement of refrigeration, the process of hot air drying can cause a significant loss of nutritional content such as the soluble solids and nitrogen protein content.  Sun drying  This preservation method is most economical out of all methods. The tempeh can be blanched prior to dehydration to preserve flavor and prolong shelf life. Tempeh is exposed to internal solar dryer temperature of in this method. A disadvantage of this method is that sunlight can destroy some of the vitamin B12 of tempeh.  Freeze drying  This method is the most expensive out of all dehydration methods but provides the advantage of long stable shelf life at room temperature and an excellent retention of soluble nutrients (nitrogen protein and other solids). The product undergoes quick freeze at and then dried at a moderate temperature inside a strong vacuum. Due to the pricey nature of the equipment, the final product price will be higher than tempeh preserved through other methods.  Spray drying  As this method is traditionally used for small particles, it is used to produce tempeh powder for products such as soups, breads, tortillas, etc. However, this method can be expensive due to the bulky nature of the equipment.  Deep frying  This method produces ready to eat tempeh products. A culinary oil with a high smoke point, such as rapeseed, soy, safflower, peanut, or coconut oil, is heated to in the deep fryer. The tempeh is deep fried until golden brown and crisp, and then cooled quickly in a sterile environment to be sealed in Pliofilm bags and stored in a cool, dry place. The shelf life of this product lasts around a week but can be extended if the tempeh is sun dried or oven dried prior to deep frying.

Isaac N. Brown was born in Caldwell County, Kentucky, but spent part of his later youth in western Tennessee. In March 1834, shortly after his father died, he joined the United States Navy as a midshipman. He received a commission as a lieutenant in 1846 and later participated in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He married, owned property on the Mississippi Delta, and had three sons. He remained in the Navy and made several trips around the world on various ships. Shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, he resigned his commission. In June, he accepted a commission as a lieutenant in the fledgling Confederate States Navy. Brown was assigned to the Mississippi River region by the Confederate Naval Department. In May 1862 he was ordered to Yazoo City, Mississippi, to take command of the unfinished ironclad CSS Arkansas and complete her construction in the worst of conditions. After successfully accomplishing this difficult task, Brown commanded her dramatic breaking of the Union blockade of Vicksburg, Mississippi, on July 15, 1862. Brown was promoted to commander in August 1862 in recognition of his bold and audacious actions at Vicksburg. Commander Brown served as captain of the ironclad CSS Charleston, which operated in defense of Charleston, South Carolina, during 1863‚Äì1865. At the end of the Civil War, Brown took up farming in Mississippi and later moved to Texas. He died at Corsicana, Texas, and is buried in Oakwood Cemetery. The Sons of Confederate Veterans awarded their Confederate Medal of Honor, started in 1977, to Brown for his distinguished service. File:Isaac N.

It was responsible for Confederate naval operations during the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), fighting against the United States Navy (Union Navy). The three major tasks of the Confederate States Navy during the whole of its existence were the protection of Confederate harbors and coastlines from outside invasion, making the war costly for the U.S. by attacking American/Northern merchant ships worldwide, and running the U.S. blockade by drawing off U.S. Navy ships in pursuit of the Confederate commerce raiders and few warships. History The Confederate navy could never achieve numerical equality with the United States Navy, (then known as the Union Navy), with its near 70 years of traditions and experience, so it used technological innovation, such as ironclads, submarines, torpedo boats, and naval mines (then known as torpedoes) to attempt to gain advantage. In February 1861, the Confederate States Navy had 30 vessels, only 14 of which were seaworthy. The opposing Union Navy had 90 vessels. The C. S. Navy eventually grew to 101 ships to meet the rise in naval conflicts and threats to the coast and rivers of the Confederacy. Illustration of the Confederate fleet at New Orleans On April 20, 1861, the U.S. was forced to quickly abandon the important Gosport Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia. In their haste, they failed to effectively burn the facility with its large depots of arms, other supplies, and several small vessels. As a result, the Confederacy captured much-needed war materials, including heavy cannon, gunpowder, shot, and shell. Of most importance to the Confederacy was the shipyards dry docks, hardly damaged by the departing Union forces. The Confederacys only substantial navy yard at that time was in Pensacola, Florida, so the Gosport Yard was sorely needed to build new warships. The most significant warship left at the Yard was the screw frigate USS Merrimack. The U.S. Navy had torched Merrimacks superstructure and upper deck, then scuttled the vessel; it would have been immediately useful as a warship to their enemy. Little of the ship's structure remained other than the hull, which was holed by the scuttling charge but otherwise intact. Confederate Navy Secretary Stephen Mallory had the idea to raise Merrimack and rebuild it. When the hull was raised, it had not been submerged long enough to have been rendered unusable; the steam engines and essential machinery were salvageable. The decks were rebuilt using thick oak and pine planking, and the upper deck was overlaid with two courses of heavy iron plate. The newly rebuilt superstructure was unusual: above the waterline, the sides sloped inward and were covered with two layers of heavy iron-plate armor. The vessel was a new kind of warship, an all-steam powered \\"iron-clad\\". In the centuries-old tradition of reusing captured ships, the new ship was christened CSS Virginia. She later fought the Unions new ironclad USS Monitor. On the second day of the Battle of Hampton Roads, the two ships met and each scored numerous hits on the other. On the first day of that battle Virginia, and the James River Squadron, aggressively attacked and nearly broke the Union Navys sea blockade of wooden warships, proving the effectiveness of the ironclad concept. The two ironclads had steamed forward, tried to outflank or ram the other, circled, backed away, and came forward firing again and again, but neither was able to sink or demand surrender of its opponent. After four hours both ships were taking in water through split seams and breaches by enemy shot. The engines of both were becoming dangerously overtaxed, and their crews were near exhaustion. The two ships turned and steamed away, never to meet again. This part in the Battle of Hampton Roads between Monitor and Virginia greatly overshadowed the bloody events each side's ground troops were fighting, largely because it was the first battle in history between two iron- armored steam-powered warships. The last Confederate surrender took place in Liverpool, United Kingdom on November 6, 1865 aboard the commerce raider CSS Shenandoah when her flag (battle ensign) was lowered for the final time. This surrender brought about the end of the Confederate navy. The Shenandoah had circumnavigated the globe, the only Confederate ship to do so. =Creation= The act of the Confederate Congress that created the Confederate Navy on February 21, 1861 also appointed Stephen Mallory as Secretary of the Department of the Navy. Mallory was experienced as an admiralty lawyer and had served for a time as the chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee of the United States Senate. The Confederacy had a few scattered naval assets and looked to Liverpool, England, to buy naval cruisers to attack the American merchant fleet. In April 1861, Mallory recruited former U.S. Navy Lieutenant James Dunwoody Bulloch into the Confederate navy and sent him to Liverpool. Using Charleston-based importer and exporter Fraser Trentholm, who had offices in Liverpool, Commander Bulloch immediately ordered six steam vessels.http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/maritime/collections/americancivilwar/supplying- confederacy.aspx As Mallory began aggressively building up a formidable naval force, a Confederate Congress committee on August 27, 1862, reported: In addition to the ships included in the report of the committee, the C.S. Navy also had one ironclad floating battery, presented to the Confederacy by the state of Georgia, one ironclad ram donated by the state of Alabama, and numerous commerce raiders making war on Union merchant ships. When Virginia seceded the Virginia Navy was absorbed into the Confederate Navy. =Ensigns, jacks, and other naval flags= Pennant of Admiral Franklin Buchanan used at Battle of Mobile Bay, Alabama, 1864 William Sherman took Savannah, Georgia, 1864 The practice of using primary and secondary naval flags after the British tradition was common practice for the Confederacy; the fledgling Confederate navy therefore adopted detailed flag requirements and regulations in the use of battle ensigns, naval jacks, as well as small boat ensigns, commissioning pennants, designating flags, and signal flags aboard its warships. Changes to these regulations were made during 1863, when a new naval jack, battle ensign, and commissioning pennant design was introduced aboard all Confederate ships, echoing the Confederacys change of its national flag from the old \\"Stars and Bars\\" to the new \\"Stainless Banner\\". Despite the detailed naval regulations issued, minor variations in the flags were frequently seen, due to different manufacturing techniques employed, suppliers used, and the flag-making traditions of each C.S. state. =Privateers= On April 17, 1861, Confederate President Jefferson Davis invited applications for letters of marque and reprisal to be granted under the seal of the Confederate States, against ships and property of the United States and their citizens: President Davis was not confident of his executive authority to issue letters of marque and called a special session of Congress on April 29 to formally authorize the hiring of privateers in the name of the Confederate States. On 6 May the Confederate Congress passed \\"An act recognizing the existence of war between the United States and the Confederate States, and concerning letters of marque, prizes, and prize goods.\\" Then, on May 14, 1861, \\"An act regulating the sale of prizes and the distribution thereof,\\" was also passed. Both acts granted the president power to issue letters of marque and detailed regulations as to the conditions on which letters of marque should be granted to private vessels, the conduct and behavior of the officers and crews of such vessels, and the disposal of such prizes made by privateer crews. The manner in which Confederate privateers operated was generally similar to those of privateers of the United States or of European nations. The 1856 Declaration of Paris outlawed privateering for such nations as the United Kingdom and France, but the United States had neither signed nor endorsed the declaration. Therefore, privateering was constitutionally legal in both the United States and the Confederacy, as well as Portugal, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Germany. However, the United States did not acknowledge the Confederacy as an independent country and denied the legitimacy of any letters of marque issued by its government. U.S. President Abraham Lincoln declared all medicines to the Confederacy to be contraband and any captured Confederate privateers were to be hanged as pirates. Ultimately, no one was hanged for privateering because the Confederate government threatened to retaliate against U.S. prisoners of war.Pirate Hunting: The Fight Against Pirates, Privateers, and Sea Raiders from Antiquity to the Present by Benerson Little (Potomac Books, 2010) Initially, Confederate privateers operated primarily from New Orleans, but activity was soon concentrated in the Atlantic, as the Union Navy began expanding its operations. Confederate privateers harassed Union merchant ships and sank several warships, although they were unable to relieve the blockade on Southern ports and its dire effects on the Confederate economy. Ships CSS Virginia Hunley CSS Alabama, a ship of the Confederate States Navy One of the more well-known ships was the CSS Virginia, formerly the sloop-of-war USS Merrimack (1855). In 1862, after being converted to an ironclad ram, she fought the USS Monitor in the Battle of Hampton Roads, an event that came to symbolize the end of the dominance of large wooden sailing warships and the beginning of the age of steam and the ironclad warship. The Confederates also constructed submarines, among the few that existed after the early Turtle of the American Revolutionary War. Of those the Pioneer and the Bayou St. John submarine never saw action. However, Hunley, built in Mobile as a privateer by Horace Hunley, later came under the control of the Confederate Army at Charleston, SC, but was manned partly by a C. S. Navy crew; she became the first submarine to sink a ship in a wartime engagement. The Hunley sank, being too close to the blast wave caused by her spar torpedo during its successful attack on the sloop-of-war .Official records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, Series I, Vol. 15, p. 337. The sinking of the Housatonic became the first successful submarine attack in history. Confederate Navy commerce raiders were also used with great success to disrupt U.S. merchant shipping. The most famous of them was the screw sloop-of-war CSS Alabama, a warship secretly built for the Confederacy in Birkenhead, near Liverpool, United Kingdom. She was launched as Enrica but was commissioned as CSS Alabama just off the Azores by her captain, Raphael Semmes. She began her world-famous raiding career under his command, accounting for 65 U.S. ships, a record that still remains unbeaten by any ship in naval warfare. CSS Alabama s crew was mostly from Liverpool, and the cruiser never once dropped anchor in a Confederate port, though she sank a blockading Union gunboat off the coast of Texas. A similar raider, CSS Shenandoah, fired the last shot of the American Civil War in late June 1865; she did not strike her colors and surrender until early November 1865, in Liverpool, England five months after the conflict had ended.

The Provisional Congress meeting in Montgomery accepted these men into the Confederate Navy at their old rank. In order to accommodate them they initially provided for an officer corps to consist of four captains, four commanders, 30 lieutenants, and various other non-line officers.The Statutes at Large of the Provisional Government of the Confederate States of America, from the Institution of the Government, 8 February 1861, to its Termination, 18, February 1862, Inclusive; Arranged in Chronological Order.

The act also provided for promotion on merit: \\"All the Admirals, four of the Captains, five of the Commanders, twenty-two of the First Lieutenants, and five of the Second Lieutenants, shall be appointed solely for gallant or meritorious conduct during the war.\\"The Statutes at Large of the Confederate States of America, Commencing with the First Session of the First Congress; 1862.

By 1862 regulations specified the uniforms and rank insignia for officers. Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing. Additionally a Confederate States Naval Academy was established on a steamer near Richmond, Virginia. =Administration= The Department of the Navy was responsible for the administration of the affairs of the Confederate Navy and Confederate Marine Corps. It included various offices, bureaus, and naval agents in Europe. By July 20, 1861, the Confederate government had organized the administrative positions of the Confederate navy as follows: * Stephen R.

While both hat insignia and sleeve insignia were used here the primary indicator were shoulder straps. Only line officers wore those straps shown below as officers of various staff departments (Medical, Pay, Engineering and Naval Construction) had separate ranks and different straps. Likewise the anchor symbol on the hats was substituted accordingly and they did not wear loops on the sleeve insignias. { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background- color:white; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" -style=\\"text-align:center;\\"  !

Elliott C47s unloading at Tempelhof Airport in Berlin, part of the airlift of supplies which broke the Soviet Union's 1948 land blockade of West Berlin A blockade is an effort to cut off supplies, war material or communications from a particular area by force, either in part or totally. A blockade is not an embargo or sanctions, which are legal barriers to trade. It is also distinct from a siege in that a blockade is usually directed at an entire country or region, rather than a fortress or city. While most blockades historically took place at sea, blockade is still used on land to prevent someone entering a place. A blockading power can seek to cut off all maritime transport from and to the blockaded country; although stopping all land transport to and from an area may also be considered a blockade. Blockades restrict the trading rights of neutrals, who must submit for inspection for contraband, which the blockading power may define narrowly or broadly, sometimes including food and medicine. In the 20th century air power has also been used to enhance the effectiveness of the blockade by halting air traffic within the blockaded airspace. Close patrol of hostile ports, in order to prevent naval forces from putting to sea, is also referred to as a blockade. When coastal cities or fortresses were besieged from the landward side, the besiegers would often blockade the seaward side as well. Most recently, blockades have sometimes included cutting off electronic communications by jamming radio signals and severing undersea cables. History Although primitive naval blockades had been in use for millennia, the first successful attempts at establishing a full naval blockade were made by Admiral of the Fleet Edward Hawke during the Seven Years' War (1754‚Äì1763). Following the British naval victory at Quiberon Bay, which ended any immediate threat of a major invasion of the British Isles,Anderson p.381-83 the British implemented a tight economic blockade on the French coast. This began to starve French ports of commerce, further weakening France's economy. Hawke took command of the blockading fleet off Brest and extended the blockade of the French coast from Dunkirk to Marseilles.Corbett p.86 The British were able to take advantage of the Navy's position to develop plans for amphibious landings on the coast. However, these plans were eventually abandoned, due to the formidable logistical challenge this would have posed.Corbett p.93-94 The strategic importance of the blockade was cemented during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, during which successful blockades on France were imposed by the Royal Navy, leading to major economic disruptions. The Union blockade of southern ports was a major factor in the American Civil War, as was the failure of the U-boat blockade in World War I and again in World War II. Julian Corbett and Admiral Mahan emphasized that naval operations were chiefly to be won by decisive battles and blockade. Types of blockade German U-boats attempted to stop ships carrying food, supplies and mat√©riel from reaching the United Kingdom, an example of a distant blockade. =Close, distant, and loose blockades= A close blockade entails placing warships within sight of the blockaded coast or port, to ensure the immediate interception of any ship entering or leaving. It is both the most effective and the most difficult form of blockade to implement. Difficulties arise because the blockading ships must remain continuously at sea, exposed to storms and hardship, usually far from any support, and vulnerable to sudden attack from the blockaded side, whose ships may stay safe in harbor until they choose to come out. In a distant blockade, the blockaders stay well away from the blockaded coast and try to intercept any ships going in or out. This may require more ships on station, but they can usually operate closer to their bases, and are at much less risk from enemy raids. This was almost impossible prior to the 16th century due to the nature of the ships used.Palmer, Michael A., Command at Sea: Naval Command and Control since the Sixteenth Century, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, 2005, p.22 A loose blockade is a close blockade where the blockading ships are withdrawn out of sight from the coast (behind the horizon) but no farther. The object of loose blockade is to lure the enemy into venturing out but to stay close enough to strike. British admiral Horatio Nelson applied a loose blockade at C√°diz in 1805. The Franco- Spanish fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve then came out, resulting in the Battle of Trafalgar.Reynolds, Clark G. 1998. \\"Navies in History\\", p. 98. . =Pacific blockade= Until 1827, blockades, as part of economic warfare, were always a part of a war. This changed when France, Russia and Britain came to the aid of the Greek rebels against Turkey. They blockaded the Turkish- occupied coast, which led to the battle of Navarino. War was never declared, however, so it is considered the first pacific ‚Äî i.e. peaceful ‚Äî blockade.Oppenheim, L. & Roxburgh, Ronald. 2005. \\"International Law: A Treatise\\", p. 53. . The first truly pacific blockade, involving no shooting at all, was the British blockade of the Republic of New Granada in 1837, established to compel New Granada to release an imprisoned British consul.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th edition. 1911. \\"Pacific Blockade\\", vol. 20, p. 433-434. Legal status President Kennedy and his advisors discuss the Cuban Missile Crisis. Part of the US response to Soviet missiles being placed in Cuba was a naval blockade of the island. Since 1945, the United Nations Security Council determines the legal status of blockades and by article 42 of the UN Charter, the council can also apply blockades.D'Amato, Anthony A. 1995. \\"International Law and Political Reality: Collected Papers\\", p. 138. . The UN Charter allows for the right of self-defense but requires that this must be immediately reported to the Security Council to ensure the maintenance of international peace. According to the not ratified document San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994,San Remo Manual on International Law Applicable to Armed Conflicts at Sea, 12 June 1994. ICRC.org a blockade is a legal method of warfare at sea but is governed by rules. The manual describes what can never be contraband. The blockading nation is free to select anything else as contraband in a list, which it must publish. The blockading nation typically establishes a blockaded area of water, but any ship can be inspected as soon as it is established that it is attempting to break the blockade. This inspection can occur inside the blockaded area or in international waters, but never inside the territorial waters of a neutral nation. A neutral ship must obey a request to stop for inspection from the blockading nation. If the situation so demands, the blockading nation can request that the ship divert to a known place or harbour for inspection. If the ship does not stop, then the ship is subject to capture. If people aboard the ship resist capture, they can be lawfully attacked. =Act of war= Whether or not a blockade was seen as lawful depended on the laws of the nations whose trade was influenced by the blockade. The Brazilian blockade of R√≠o de la Plata in 1826 during the Cisplatine War, for instance, was considered lawful according to British law but unlawful according to French and American law. The latter two countries announced they would actively defend their ships against Brazilian blockaders, while Britain was forced to steer for a peaceful solution between Brazil and Argentina.Sondhaus, Lawrence. 2004. \\"Navies in Modern World History\\", p. 98. . = Civil disobedience = Greenham Common. There are a number of protest actions with the specific aim of cutting off material, people or communications from a particular area, either in part or totally. The effectiveness of such blockades rely on the participation of people and lock- on techniques. A sit-down strike is a form of civil disobedience in which an organized group of workers, usually employed at a factory or other centralized location, take possession of the workplace by \\"sitting down\\" at their stations, effectively preventing their employers from replacing them with strikebreakers. A nonviolent picket is another example; it also illustrates the specificity of the blockade. Pickets may demand the blocking of some traffic while allowing other traffic; e.g. workers but not the customers, or customers but not workers. The Mau movement was a nonviolent movement for Samoan independence from colonial rule during the early 1900s. Amongst other actions, participants formed their own \\"police force\\", picketing stores in Apia to prevent the payment of customs to the authorities. Some other examples are the perimeter blockade by human chain at Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp, the blockade of the Franklin River dam site, and the Keystone Pipeline.  Blockade planning  A Northern cartoonist ridicules the Union's initial attempts to blockade ports of the Confederacy in the American Civil War Blockades depend on four general factors: * The value of the item being blockaded must warrant the need to blockade. For example, during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, the items to be blockaded (or \\"quarantined\\" to use the more neutral term selected by President John F. Kennedy) were Medium-range ballistic missiles, capable of delivering nuclear weaponry, bound for Cuba. Their value was high, as a military threat against the United States. * The strength of the blockading force must be equal to or greater in strength than the opposition. The blockade is only successful if the 'thing' in question is prevented from reaching its receiver. For example, the overwhelming power of the Royal Navy allowed a successful blockade of Germany. * Geography. Knowing the routes of the enemy will help the blockader choose where to blockade: for example, a high mountain pass or a strait is a natural choke point and a candidate for fortification. * A blockade tends to be a long campaign requiring a long-term commitment by the blockading power. The Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I and Battle of the Atlantic were essentially about German blockades, and lasted nearly as long as their respective wars. The Imperial Japanese Navy, however, made only sporadic efforts at blockade during the Pacific war, preferring to seek victory by fleet action. Blockade running Blockade running is the practice of delivering cargo (food, for example) to a blockaded area. It has mainly been done by ships (called blockade runners) across ports under naval blockade. Blockade runners were typically the fastest ships available and often lightly armed and armored. However, it is now also been done by aircraft, forming airbridges, such as over the Berlin blockade after World War II.

Commonly encountered pre-packaged desiccants are solids that absorb water. Desiccants for specialized purposes may be in forms other than solid, and may work through other principles, such as chemical bonding of water molecules. They are commonly encountered in foods to retain crispness. Industrially, desiccants are widely used to control the level of water in gas streams. Types of desiccants Although some desiccants are chemically inert, others are extremely reactive and require specialized handling techniques. The most common desiccant is silica, an otherwise inert, nontoxic, water-insoluble white solid. Tens of thousands of tons are produced annually for this purpose.Otto W. Fl√∂rke, et al. \\"Silica\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2008, Weinheim: Wiley-VCH, . . Other common desiccants include activated charcoal, calcium sulfate, calcium chloride, and molecular sieves (typically, zeolites). Desiccants may also be categorized by their type, either I,II,III,IV, or V. These types are a function of the shape of the desiccant's moisture sorption isotherm. Alcohols and acetones are also dehydrating agents. = Performance efficiency = One measure of desiccant efficiency is the ratio (or percentage) of water storable in the desiccant relative to the mass of desiccant. Another measure is the residual relative humidity of the air or other fluid being dried. The performance of any desiccant varies with temperature and both relative humidity and absolute humidity. To some extent, desiccant performance can be precisely described, but most commonly, the final choice of which desiccant best suits a given situation, how much of it to use, and in what form, is made based on testing and practical experience. =Colored saturation indicators= Indicating silica gel Sometimes a humidity indicator is included in the desiccant to show, by color changes, the degree of water-saturation of the desiccant. One commonly used indicator is cobalt chloride (CoCl2). Anhydrous cobalt chloride is blue. When it bonds with two water molecules, (CoCl2‚Ä¢2H2O), it turns purple. Further hydration results in the pink hexaaquacobalt(II) chloride complex [Co(H2O)6]Cl2. Applications One example of desiccant usage is in the manufacture of insulated windows where zeolite spheroids fill a rectangular spacer tube at the perimeter of the panes of glass. The desiccant helps to prevent the condensation of moisture between the panes. Another use of zeolites is in the dryer component of air conditioning systems to help maintain the efficacy of the refrigerant. Desiccants are also commonly used to protect goods in shipping containers against moisture damage. Hygroscopic cargo, such as cocoa, coffee, and various nuts and grains, are particularly susceptible to mold and rot when exposed to condensation and humidity. Because of this, shippers often take precautionary measures by deploying desiccants to protect against cargo loss. Desiccants induce dryness in any environment and reduce the amount of moisture present in air. Desiccants come in various forms and have found widespread use in the food, pharmaceuticals, packing, electronics and many manufacturing industries. Air conditioning systems can be made based on desiccants. Desiccants are used in different kinds of livestock farming to dry newborn animals, such as piglets. The use of a good desiccant can help them dry quicker and save energy, which can be crucial for the animal's development. Another use is to reduce bacteria and pathogens that thrive in wet surfaces, reducing bacteria pressure. However, some desiccants have a very high pH-level, which can be harmful for an animal's skin. Drying of solvents Toluene is heated under reflux with sodium and benzophenone to produce dry, oxygen-free toluene. The toluene is dry and oxygen free when the intense blue coloration from the benzophenone ketyl radical is observed. Desiccants are also used to remove water from solvents, typically required by chemical reactions that do not tolerate water, e.g., the Grignard reaction. The method generally, though not always, involves mixing the solvent with the solid desiccant. Studies show that molecular sieves are superior as desiccants relative to chemical drying reagents such as sodium-benzophenone. Sieves offer the advantages of being safe in air and recyclable.

This may be done by open-pit (also called open-cast mining) or by various surface excavating equipment or tunneling equipment. Placer mining is frequently used for precious metal deposits (particularly gold) and gemstones, both of which are often found in alluvial deposits--deposits of sand and gravel in modern or ancient stream beds, or occasionally glacial deposits. The metal or gemstones, having been moved by stream flow from an original source such as a vein, are typically only a minuscule portion of the total deposit. Since gems and heavy metals like gold are considerably denser than sand, they tend to accumulate at the base of placer deposits. Placer deposits can be as young as a few years old, such as the Canadian Queen Charlotte beach gold placer deposits, or billions of years old like the Elliott Lake uranium paleoplacer within the Huronian Supergroup in Canada. The containing material in an alluvial placer mine may be too loose to safely mine by tunnelling, though it is possible where the ground is permanently frozen. Where water under pressure is available, it may be used to mine, move, and separate the precious material from the deposit, a method known as hydraulic mining, hydraulic sluicing or hydraulicking. Etymology The word placer derives from the Spanish placer, meaning shoal or alluvial/sand deposit, from Catalan placer (shoal), from plassa (place) from Medieval Latin placea (place) the origin word for \\"place\\" and \\"plaza\\" in English. The word in Spanish is thus derived from placea and refers directly to an alluvial or glacial deposit of sand or gravel. An alternative etymology derives the English word from American Spanish placer (placer, sandbank), from earlier placel, apparently from obsolete Portuguese placel (placer, sandbank). History Plate depicting placer mining from the 1556 book De re metallica Placers supplied most of the gold for a large part of the ancient world. Hydraulic mining methods such as hushing were used widely by the Romans across their empire, but especially in the gold fields of northern Spain after its conquest by Augustus in 25 BC. One of the largest sites was at Las M√©dulas, where seven 30 mile long aqueducts were used to work the alluvial gold deposits through the first century AD. (Inclusions of platinum-group metals in a very large proportion of gold items indicate that the gold was largely derived from placer or alluvial deposits. Platinum group metals are seldom found with gold in hardrock reef or vein deposits.) In North America, placer mining was famous in the context of several gold rushes, particularly the California Gold Rush and the Colorado Gold Rush, the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush and the Klondike Gold Rush. Placer mining continues in many areas of the world as a source of diamonds, industrial minerals and metals, gems (in Myanmar and Sri Lanka), platinum, and of gold (in Yukon, Alaska and British Columbia). Deposits An area well protected from the flow of water is a great location to find gold. Gold is very dense and is often found in a stream bed. Many different gold deposits are dealt with in different ways. Placer deposits attract many prospectors because their costs are very low. There are many different places gold could be placed, such as a residual, alluvial, and a bench deposit. =Residual= Residual deposits are more common where there has been weathering on rocks and where there hasn't been water. They are deposits which have not been washed away yet or been moved. The residual usually lies at the site of the lode. This type of deposit undergoes rock weathering. =Alluvial= Alluvial or eluvial deposits are the most common type of placer gold, and are often the richest. They contain pieces of gold that have been washed away from the lode by the force of water, and have been deposited in sediment in or near watercourses or former watercourses. Therefore, they are mostly found in valleys or flood plains. =Bench= Bench deposits are created when gold reaches a stream bed. Gold accumulations in an old stream bed that are high are called bench deposits. They can be found on higher slopes that drain into valleys. Dry stream beds (benches) can be situated far from other water sources and can sometimes be found on mountain tops. Today, many miners focus their activities on bench deposits. Methods A number of methods are used to mine placer gold and gems, both in terms of extracting the minerals from the ground, and separating it from the non-gold or non-gems. =Panning= Panning for gold in Korea, c. 1900 The simplest technique to extract gold from placer ore is panning. This technique has been dated back to at least the Roman Empire. In panning, some mined ore is placed in a large metal or plastic pan, combined with a generous amount of water, and agitated so that the gold particles, being of higher density than the other material, settle to the bottom of the pan. The lighter gangue material such as sand, mud and gravel are then washed over the side of the pan, leaving the gold behind. Once a placer deposit is located by gold panning, the miner usually shifts to equipment that can treat volumes of sand and gravel more quickly and efficiently. Gold panning was commonly used on its own during the California gold rush, however it is now rarely used for profit since even an expert gold prospector can only process approximately one cubic yard of material for every 10 hours of work. =Rocker= A rocker box (or \\"cradle\\") is capable of greater volume than a gold pan, however its production is still limited when compared to other methods of placer mining. It is only capable of processing about 3 or 4 yards of gravel a day. It is more portable and requires less infrastructure than a sluice box, being fed not by a sluice but by hand. The box sits on rockers, which when rocked separates out the gold, and the practice was referred to as \\"rocking the golden baby\\". A typical rocker box is approximately 42 inches long, 16 inches wide and 12 inches deep with a removable tray towards the top, where gold is placed.Basque, G. (1999). Methods of placer mining. Surrey, B.C: Heritage House. p.41 The rocker was commonly used throughout North America during the early gold rush, but its popularity diminished as other methods that could handle a larger volume became more common. =Sluice box= Riffles in a sluice box. The small specks are gold, the larger ones are merely pebbles A modern sluice box made of metal; in its base are the riffles used to catch gold settling to the bottom The same principle may be employed on a larger scale by constructing a short sluice box, with barriers along the bottom called riffles to trap the heavier gold particles as water washes them and the other material along the box. This method better suits excavation with shovels or similar implements to feed ore into the device. Sluice boxes can be as short as a few feet, or more than ten feet (a common term for one that is over six feet +/- is a \\"Long Tom\\"). While they are capable of handling a larger volume of material than simpler methods such as the rocker box or gold panning, this can come at the cost of efficiency, since conventional sluice boxes have been found to recover only about 40% of the gold that they process. The sluice box was used extensively during the California gold rush for larger scale operations. When streams became increasingly depleted, the grizzly and undercurrent variants of the sluice box were developed. The grizzly is a set of parallel bars placed at a 45 degree angle over the main sluice box, which filter out larger material. The undercurrent variety includes additional, auxiliary sluice boxes where material is initially filtered. It then travels through a trough into the primary sluice box where it is filtered again. Both the grizzly and undercurrent are designed to increase efficiency, and were often used in combination. =Dry washing= Sluicing is only effective in areas where there is a sufficient water supply, and is impractical in arid areas. Alternative methods developed that used the blowing of air to separate out gold from sand. One of the more common methods of dry washing is the Mexican dry wash. This method involves placing gravel on a riffle board with a bellows placed underneath it. The bellows is then used to blow air through the board in order to remove the lighter material from the heavier gold. The amount of gravel that can be processed using the Mexican dry wash technique varies from 1 1/2 to 4 cubic yards per day, and can be processed at a maximum efficiency of 80%. Another form of dry washing is \\"winnowing\\". This method was most commonly used by Spanish miners in America, and only requires a blanket and a box with a screen on the bottom. The material is first filtered through the box so only the finer material is placed onto the blanket. The material on the blanket is then flung into the air so that any breeze can blow away the lighter material and leave the gold behind. While this method is extremely simple and requires very few materials, it is also slow and inefficient. =Trommel= Blue Ribbon Mine, Alaska A trommel is composed of a slightly-inclined rotating metal tube (the 'scrubber section') with a screen at its discharge end. Lifter bars, sometimes in the form of bolted in angle iron, are attached to the interior of the scrubber section. The ore is fed into the elevated end of the trommel. Water, often under pressure, is provided to the scrubber and screen sections and the combination of water and mechanical action frees the valuable minerals from the ore. The mineral bearing ore that passes through the screen is then further concentrated in smaller devices such as sluices and jigs. The larger pieces of ore that do not pass through the screen can be carried to a waste stack by a conveyor. =Gold dredge= The Natomas No. 6 gold dredge in operation in 1958 in Folsom, California Large-scale sifting of placer gold from large volumes of alluvial deposits can be done by use of mechanical dredges.These dredges were originally very large boats capable of processing massive amounts of material, however as the gold has become increasingly depleted in the most easily accessible areas, smaller and more maneuverable dredges have become much more common. These smaller dredges commonly operate by sucking water and gravel up through long hoses using a pump, where the gold can then be separated using more traditional methods such as a sluice box. =Underground mining= Miners using jets of steam to melt the permafrost in an underground gold mine In areas where the ground is permanently frozen, such as in Siberia, Alaska, and the Yukon, placer deposits may be mined underground. As the frozen ground is otherwise too hard and firm to mine by hand, historically fires were built so as to thaw the ground before digging it. Later methods involve blasting jets of steam (\\"points\\") into the frozen deposits. Environmental effects Although this procedure is not required, the process water may be continuously recycled and the ore from which the sought-after minerals have been extracted (\\"the tailings\\") can be reclaimed. While these recycling and reclamation processes are more common in modern placer mining operations they are still not universally done. View of Las M√©dulas In earlier times the process water was not generally recycled and the spent ore was not reclaimed. The remains of a Roman alluvial gold mine at Las M√©dulas are so spectacular as to justify the site being designated UNESCO World Heritage status. The methods used by the Roman miners are described by Pliny the Elder in his work Naturalis Historia published in about 77 AD. The author was a Procurator in the region and so probably witnessed large-scale hydraulic mining of the placer deposits there. He also added that the local lake Curacado had been heavily silted by the mining methods. Environmental activists describe the hydraulic mining form of placer mining as environmentally destructive because of the large amounts of silt that it adds to previously clear running streams (also known as the \\"Dahlonega Method\\"). Most placer mines today use settling ponds, if only to ensure that they have sufficient water to run their sluicing operations. In California, from 1853 to 1884, \\"hydraulicking\\" of placers removed an enormous amount of material from the gold fields, material that was carried downstream and raised the level of portions of the Central Valley by some seven feet in affected areas and settled in long bars up to 20 feet thick in parts of San Francisco Bay. The process raised an opposition calling themselves the \\"Anti-Debris Association\\". In January 1884, the North Bloomfield Mining and Gravel Company case banned the flushing of debris into streams, and the hydraulic mining mania in California's gold country came to an end. Examples * The Witwatersrand Basin in South Africa is an example of a placer deposit, as it is a 3 billion- year-old, alluvial sedimentary basin containing at least 70 ore minerals. * The Klondike Gold Rush began in 1896 when nuggets of gold were found in the Klondike region of Alaska and the Canadian Yukon. The nuggets were found in running water, making the Klondike Gold deposit an alluvial placer mining deposit, which it soon became when 30,000 gold-seekers trekked the region.

A video game remake is a video game closely adapted from an earlier title, usually for the purpose of modernizing a game for newer hardware and contemporary audiences. Typically, a remake of such game software shares essentially the same title, fundamental gameplay concepts, and core story elements of the original game. Remakes are often made by the original developer or copyright holder, sometimes by the fan community. If created by the community, video game remakes are sometimes also called fan game and can be seen as part of the retrogaming phenomenon. Definition A remake offers a newer interpretation of an older work, characterized by updated or changed assets. A remake typically maintains the same story, genre, and fundamental gameplay ideas of the original work. The intent of a remake is usually to take an older game that has become outdated and update it for a new platform and audience. A remake may also include expanded stories, often to conform to the conventions of contemporary games or later titles in the same series in order to make a game marketable to a new audience. For example, for Sierra's 1991 remake of Space Quest, the developers used the engine, point-and-click interface, and graphical style of Space Quest IV: Roger Wilco and The Time Rippers, replacing the dated graphics and text parser interface of the original. However, elements that had not become dated, like the narrative, puzzles and sets, were largely preserved. Another example is Black Mesa, a Half-Life 2 mod that improves in-game textures, assets and models, and facial animations, while taking place in the events of the original Half-Life game. =Similar concepts= Games that use an existing brand but are conceptually very different from the original, such as Battlezone (1998) and Defender (2002) or Tomb Raider (1996) and Tomb Raider (2013) are usually regarded as reboots rather than remakes. A port is a conversion of a game to a new platform that relies heavily on existing work and assets. A port may include various enhancements like improved performance, resolution, and sometimes even additional content, but differs from a remake in that it still relies heavily on the original assets and engine of the source game. A port that contains a great deal of remade assets may sometimes be considered a remastering or a partial remake, although video game publishers are not always clear on the distinction. DuckTales: Remastered for example uses the term \\"Remastered\\" to distinguish itself from the original NES game it was based on, even though it is a clean-slate remake with a different engine and assets. History In the early history of video games, remakes were generally regarded as \\"conversions\\" and seldom associated with nostalgia. Due to limited and often highly divergent hardware, games appearing on multiple platforms usually had to be entirely remade. These conversions often included considerable changes to the graphics and gameplay, and could be regarded retroactively as remakes, but are distinguished from later remakes largely by intent. A conversion is created with the primary goal of tailoring a game to a specific piece of hardware, usually contemporaneous or nearly contemporaneous with the original release. An early example was Gun Fight, Midway's 1975 reprogrammed version of Taito's arcade game Western Gun, with the main difference being the use of a microprocessor in the reprogrammed version, which allowed improved graphics and smoother animation than the discrete logic of the original. In 1980, Atari released the first officially licensed home console game conversion of an arcade title, Taito's 1978 hit Space Invaders, for the Atari 2600. The game became the first \\"killer app\\" for a video game console by quadrupling the system's sales. Since then, it became a common trend to port arcade games to home systems since the second console generation, though at the time they were often more limited than the original arcade games due to the technical limitations of home consoles. In 1985, Sega released a pair of arcade remakes of older home video games. Pitfall II: Lost Caverns was effectively a remake of both the original Pitfall! and its sequel with new level layouts and colorful, detailed graphics. That same year, Sega adapted the 1982 computer game Choplifter for the arcades, taking the fundamental gameplay of the original and greatly expanding it, adding new environments, enemies, and gameplay elements. This version was very successful, and later adapted to the Master System and Famicom. Both of these games were distinguished from most earlier conversions in that they took major liberties with the source material, attempting to modernize both the gameplay as well as the graphics. Some of the earliest remakes to be recognized as such were attempts to modernize games to the standards of later games in the series. Some were even on the same platforms as the original, for example Ultima I: The First Age of Darkness, a 1986 remake of the original that appeared on multiple platforms, including the Apple II, the same platform the source game originated on. Other early remakes of this type include Sierra's early-1990s releases of King's Quest, Space Quest and Leisure Suit Larry. These games used the technology and interface of the most recent games in Sierra's series, and original assets in a dramatically different style. The intent was not simply to bring the game to a new platform, but to modernize older games which had in various ways become dated. With the birth of the retrogaming phenomenon, remakes became a way for companies to revive nostalgic brands. Galaga '88 and Super Space Invaders '91 were both attempts to revitalize aging arcade franchises with modernized graphics and new gameplay elements, while preserving many signature aspects of the original games. The 16-bit generation of console games was marked by greatly enhanced graphics compared to the previous generation, but often relatively similar gameplay, which led to an increased interest in remakes of games from the previous generation. Super Mario All-Stars remade the entire NES Mario series, and was met with great commercial success. Remake compilations of the Ninja Gaiden and Mega Man series followed. As RPGs increased in popularity, Dragon Quest, Ys and Ky≈´yaku Megami Tensei were also remade. In the mid-'90s, Atari released a series of remakes with the 2000 brand, including Tempest 2000, Battlezone 2000, and Defender 2000. After Atari's demise, Hasbro continued the tradition, with 3D remakes of Pong, Centipede, and Asteroids. By 1994 the popularity of CD-ROM led to many remakes with digitized voices and, sometimes, better graphics, although Computer Gaming World noted the \\"amateur acting\\" in many new and remade games on CD. Emulation also made perfect ports of older games possible, with compilations becoming a popular way for publishers to capitalize on older properties. Budget pricing gave publishers the opportunity to match their game's price with the perceived lower value proposition of an older game, opening the door for newer remakes. In 2003, Sega launched the Sega Ages line for PlayStation 2, initially conceived as a series of modernized remakes of classic games, though the series later diversified to include emulated compilations. The series concluded with a release that combined the two approaches, and included a remake of Fantasy Zone II that ran, via emulation, on hardware dating to the time of the original release, one of the few attempts at an enhanced remake to make no attempts at modernization. The advent of downloadable game services like Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network has further fueled the expanded market for remakes, as the platform allows companies to sell their games at a lower price, seen as more appropriate for the smaller size typical of retro games. Some XBLA and PSN remakes include Bionic Commando Rearmed, Jetpac Refuelled, Wipeout HD (a remake not of the original Wipeout but of the two PSP games), Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram and Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix. Some remakes may include the original game as a bonus feature. The 2009 remake of The Secret of Monkey Island took this a step further by allowing players to switch between the original and remade versions on the fly with a single button press. This trend was continued in the sequel, and is also a feature in Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary and later in Halo 2 Anniversary as part of Halo: The Master Chief Collection. The Nintendo 3DS' lineup has included numerous remasterings and remakes, including The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D, Star Fox 64 3D, Cave Story 3D, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D, Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, and Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story + Bowser Jr.'s Journey.  Community-driven remakes  Games abandoned by the rights-holders often spark remakes created by hobbyists and game communities. An example is OpenRA, which is a modernized remake of the classic Command & Conquer real- time-strategy games. Beyond cross-platform support, it adds comfort functions and gameplay functionality inspired by successors of the original games.Luke Plunkett: Fans Remake Classic RTS Games Like Command & Conquer, Red Alert, Kotaku (2016-09-05) Another notable examples are Pioneers, a remake and sequel in spirit to Frontier: Elite 2; CSBWin, a remake of the Dungeon crawler classic Dungeon Master; and Privateer Gemini Gold, a remake of Wing Commander: Privateer. Skywind is a fan remake of Morrowind (2002) running on Bethesda's Creation Engine, utilising the source code, assets and gameplay mechanics of Skyrim. The original game developers, Bethesda Softworks, have given project volunteers their approval. The remake team includes over 70 volunteers in artist, composer, designer, developer, and voice-actor roles. In November 2014, the team reported to have finished half of the remake's environment, over 10,000 new dialogue lines, and three hours of series-inspired soundtrack. The same open-development project is also working on Skyblivion, a remake of Oblivion (the game between Morrowind and Skyrim) in the Skyrim engine, and Morroblivion, a remake of Morrowind in the Oblivion engine (which still has a significant userbase on older PCs). Demakes Although remakes typically aim to adapt a game from a more limited platform to a more advanced one, a rising interest in older platforms has inspired some to do the opposite, adapting modern games to the standards of older platforms, sometimes even implementing them on obsolete hardware platforms, either physical or emulated. Modern demakes often change the 3D gameplay to a 2D one. Popular demakes include Quest: Brian's Journey, an official Game Boy Color port of Quest 64; Super Smash Land, a Game Boy-style demake of Super Smash Bros.; a Flash version of Portal; Rockman 7 FC and Rockman 8 FC, NES-styled demakes of Mega Man 7 and Mega Man 8, respectively; Gang Garrison 2, a pixelated demake of Team Fortress 2; and Halo 2600, an Atari 2600-style demake of Microsoft's Halo series. There is also a NES-style demake of Touhou Project game Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. Some demakes are created to showcase and push the abilities of older generation systems such as the Atari 2600. An example of this is the 2012 game Princess Rescue, which is a demake of the NES title Super Mario Bros. For much of the 1990s in Taiwan, black market developers would create unauthorized adaptations of modern games such as Street Fighter II, Mortal Kombat, Final Fantasy VII or Tekken for the NES, which still enjoyed considerable popularity in the region because of the availability of low-cost compatible systems.

In simple terms, it is a \\"mover\\". An actuator requires a control signal and a source of energy. The control signal is relatively low energy and may be electric voltage or current, pneumatic or hydraulic pressure, or even human power. Its main energy source may be an electric current, hydraulic fluid pressure, or pneumatic pressure. When it receives a control signal, an actuator responds by converting the source's energy into mechanical motion. An actuator is a mechanism by which a control system acts upon an environment. The control system can be simple (a fixed mechanical or electronic system), software-based (e.g. a printer driver, robot control system), a human, or any other input. History The history of the pneumatic actuation system and the hydraulic actuation system dates to around the time of World War II (1938). It was first created by Xhiter Anckeleman who used his knowledge of engines and brake systems to come up with a new solution to ensure that the brakes on a car exert the maximum force, with the least possible wear and tear. Types of actuators =Hydraulic= The hydraulic actuator consists of cylinder or fluid motor that uses hydraulic power to facilitate mechanical operation. The mechanical motion gives an output in terms of linear, rotatory or oscillatory motion. As liquids are nearly impossible to compress, a hydraulic actuator can exert a large force. The drawback of this approach is its limited acceleration. The hydraulic cylinder consists of a hollow cylindrical tube along which a piston can slide. The term single acting is used when the fluid pressure is applied to just one side of the piston. The piston can move in only one direction, a spring being frequently used to give the piston a return stroke. The term double acting is used when pressure is applied on each side of the piston; any difference in force between the two sides of the piston moves the piston to one side or the other.Pneumatic rack and pinion actuators for valve controls of water pipes =Pneumatic= Pneumatic actuators enable considerable forces to be produced from relatively small pressure changes. Pneumatic energy is desirable for main engine controls because it can quickly respond in starting and stopping as the power source does not need to be stored in reserve for operation. Moreover, pneumatic actuators are safer, cheaper, and often more reliable and powerful than other actuators. These forces are often used with valves to move diaphragms to affect the flow of air through the valve. Electric valve actuator controlling a ¬Ω needle valve. =Electric= An electric actuator may provide the actuation force/torque in one of several ways. Electromechanical actuators may be used to power a motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical torque. Another approach is an electrohydraulic actuator, where the electric motor remains the prime mover but provides torque to operate a hydraulic accumulator that is then used to transmit actuation force in much the same way that diesel engine/hydraulics are typically used in heavy equipment. Electrical energy is used to actuate equipment such as multi-turn valves, or electric-powered construction and excavation equipment. When used to control the flow of fluid through a valve, a brake is typically installed above the motor to prevent the fluid pressure from forcing open the valve. If no brake is installed, the actuator gets activated to reclose the valve, which is slowly forced open again. This sets up an oscillation (open, close, open ...) and the motor and actuator will eventually become damaged. =Twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) or supercoiled polymer (SCP)= Twisted and coiled polymer (TCP) actuator also known as supercoiled polymer (SCP) actuator is a coiled polymer that can be actuated by electric power. A TCP actuator looks like a helical spring. TCP actuators are usually made from silver coated Nylon. TCP actuators can also be made from other electrical conductance coat such as gold. TCP actuator should be under a load to keep the muscle extended. The electrical energy transforms to thermal energy due to electrical resistance, which is also known as Joule heating, Ohmic heating, and resistive heating. As the temperature of the TCP actuator increases by Joule heating, the polymer contracts and it causes the actuator contraction. =Thermal or magnetic= Actuators which can be actuated by applying thermal or magnetic energy to a solid-state material have been used in commercial applications. Thermal actuators can be triggered by temperature or heating through the Joule effect and tend to be compact, lightweight, economical and with high power density. These actuators use shape memory materials such as shape-memory alloys (SMAs) or magnetic shape-memory alloys (MSMAs). =Mechanical= A mechanical actuator functions to execute movement by converting one kind of motion, such as rotary motion, into another kind, such as linear motion. An example is a rack and pinion. The operation of mechanical actuators is based on combinations of structural components, such as gears and rails, or pulleys and chains. 3D printed soft actuators The majority of the existing soft actuators are fabricated using multistep low yield processes such as micro-moulding, solid freeform fabrication, and mask lithography. However, these methods require manual fabrication of devices, post processing/assembly, and lengthy iterations until maturity in the fabrication is achieved. To avoid the tedious and time-consuming aspects of the current fabrication processes, researchers are exploring an appropriate manufacturing approach for effective fabrication of soft actuators. Therefore, special soft systems that can be fabricated in a single step by rapid prototyping methods, such as 3D printing, are utilized to narrow the gap between the design and implementation of soft actuators, making the process faster, less expensive, and simpler. They also enable incorporation of all actuator components into a single structure eliminating the need to use external joints, adhesives, and fasteners. Shape memory polymer (SMP) actuators are the most similar to our muscles, providing a response to a range of stimuli such as light, electrical, magnetic, heat, pH, and moisture changes. They have some deficiencies including fatigue and high response time that have been improved through the introduction of smart materials and combination of different materials by means of advanced fabrication technology. The advent of 3D printers has made a new pathway for fabricating low-cost and fast response SMP actuators. The process of receiving external stimuli like heat, moisture, electrical input, light or magnetic field by SMP is referred to as shape memory effect (SME). SMP exhibits some rewarding features such a low density, high strain recovery, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Photopolymer/light activated polymers (LAP) are another type of SMP that are activated by light stimuli. The LAP actuators can be controlled remotely with instant response and, without any physical contact, only with the variation of light frequency or intensity. A need for soft, lightweight and biocompatible soft actuators in soft robotics has influenced researchers for devising pneumatic soft actuators because of their intrinsic compliance nature and ability to produce muscle tension. Polymers such as dielectric elastomers (DE), ionic polymer metal composites (IPMC), ionic electroactive polymers, polyelectrolyte gels, and gel-metal composites are common materials to form 3D layered structures that can be tailored to work as soft actuators. EAP actuators are categorized as 3D printed soft actuators that respond to electrical excitation as deformation in their shape.  Examples and applications  In engineering, actuators are frequently used as mechanisms to introduce motion, or to clamp an object so as to prevent motion. In electronic engineering, actuators are a subdivision of transducers. They are devices which transform an input signal (mainly an electrical signal) into some form of motion. =Examples of actuators= * Comb drive * Digital micromirror device * Electric motor * Electroactive polymer * Hydraulic cylinder * Piezoelectric actuator * Pneumatic actuator * Screw jack * Servomechanism * Solenoid * Stepper motor * Shape-memory alloy * Thermal bimorph * Hydraulic actuators =Circular to linear conversion= Motors are mostly used when circular motions are needed, but can also be used for linear applications by transforming circular to linear motion with a lead screw or similar mechanism. On the other hand, some actuators are intrinsically linear, such as piezoelectric actuators. Conversion between circular and linear motion is commonly made via a few simple types of mechanism including: * Screw: Screw jack, ball screw and roller screw actuators all operate on the principle of the simple machine known as the screw. By rotating the actuator's nut, the screw shaft moves in a line.

Performance metrics  Performance metrics for actuators include speed, acceleration, and force (alternatively, angular speed, angular acceleration, and torque), as well as energy efficiency and considerations such as mass, volume, operating conditions, and durability, among others. =Force= When considering force in actuators for applications, two main metrics should be considered. These two are static and dynamic loads. Static load is the force capability of the actuator while not in motion. Conversely, the dynamic load of the actuator is the force capability while in motion. =Speed= Speed should be considered primarily at a no-load pace, since the speed will invariably decrease as the load amount increases. The rate the speed will decrease will directly correlate with the amount of force and the initial speed. =Operating conditions= Actuators are commonly rated using the standard IP Code rating system. Those that are rated for dangerous environments will have a higher IP rating than those for personal or common industrial use. =Durability= This will be determined by each individual manufacturer, depending on usage and quality.

She was known as the beloved (muse) of Vladimir Mayakovsky. Lilya Brik was married for a long time to the poet, editor and literary critic Osip Brik (1888‚Äì1945), and she was the older sister of the French-Russian writer Elsa Triolet (1896‚Äì1970). Pablo Neruda called Lilya \\"muse of Russian avant-garde\\". Her name was frequently abbreviated by her contemporaries as \\"–õ.–Æ.\\" or \\"–õ.–Æ.–ë.\\" which are the first letters of the Russian word \\"–ª—é–±–æ–≤—å\\" lyubov, \\"love\\".–ó–∞–≥–∞–¥–∫–∞ –õ–∏–ª–∏ –ë—Ä–∏–∫ Early life She was born Lilya Kagan () into a wealthy Jewish family of a lawyer and a music teacher in Moscow. Both she and her sister Elsa received excellent education and were able to speak fluent German and French, and to play the piano. Lilya graduated from Moscow Institute of Architecture. As teenagers, the sisters were famous for their beauty. Their portraits were done by Alexander Rodchenko, Alexander Tyshler, David Shterenberg, David Burlyuk, Fernand L√©ger and later by Henri Matisse and Marc Chagall. When she was twenty years old, Lilya married poet-futurist and poetry critic Osip Brik whom she had met when she was 14 and he was 17; they were married March 26, 1912.

Mayakovsky's sexual relationship with Lili lasted from 1917 to 1923, and afterwards he continued to have a close friendship with the couple: \\"For the rest of his life, 'Osia' Brik [Lilya's husband] remained the poet's most trusted adviser, his most fervent proselytizer, and also a co-founder with him of the most dynamic avant-garde journal of the early Soviet era, Left Front of Art.\\" Francine Du Plessix Gray, Them, p. 51 With Mayakovsky Vladimir Mayakovsky and Lilya Brik Image:1918 vmayakovsky-lbrik retouched.jpgA 1918 photo that appeared retouched in official Soviet publications in the 1960s Image:LYuB in Chained by film.jpgLilya Brik in the movie Chained by the Film, 1918 In 1915, Lilya's sister Elsa befriended aspiring futurist poet and graphic artist Vladimir Mayakovsky and invited him home, but he fell in love with Lilya. Despite the calamities of World War I, Russian Civil War and throughout the 1920s, their love affair caught and stayed in public attention, possibly because she did not divorce her husband. After June 1915, Mayakovsky's lyrical poetry was almost exclusively devoted to Lilya (with notable exception of late 1920s to Tatyana Yakovleva). He frequently explicitly dedicated his poems or referred in them to Lilya by name, for example in his \\"–û–±–ª–∞–∫–æ –≤ —à—Ç–∞–Ω–∞—Ö\\" (\\"A Cloud in Trousers\\", 1915), \\"–§–ª–µ–π—Ç–∞- –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–Ω–æ—á–Ω–∏–∫\\" (\\"The Backbone Flute\\", 1916), \\"–ü—Ä–æ —ç—Ç–æ\\" (\\"About This\\", 1922), \\"–õ–∏–ª–µ—á–∫–∞! –í–º–µ—Å—Ç–æ –ø–∏—Å—å–º–∞\\" (\\"Lilechka!

Some authors consider that his passion for Lilya was one of the motives that drove Mayakovsky to suicide in 1930 at his Moscow apartment immediately after his breakup with Veronika Polonskaya. Lilya, who at the time was in Berlin, denied this and wrote that earlier she saved him twice from committing suicide. After Mayakovsky's death Later in 1930, after divorcing Osip earlier that year, she married Soviet General Vitali Primakov. Primakov was arrested in 1936 and executed in 1937 in relation to the Case of Trotskyist Anti-Soviet Military Organization, a part of the Moscow Trials. The charges were dropped and he was rehabilitated posthumously in 1957. In her 1935 letter to Joseph Stalin, Lilya Brik complained that Mayakovsky's poetic heritage was getting neglected. Stalin made a famous remark to Nikolai Yezhov: > \\"Comrade Yezhov, please take charge of Brik's letter. Mayakovsky is still > the best and the most talented poet of our Soviet epoch. Indifference to his > cultural heritage is a crime. Brik's complaints are, in my opinion, > justified...\\"Memoirs (\\"–í–æ—Å–ø–æ–º–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è\\", in Russian) by Vasily V. Katanyan > (L.Yu.B.'s stepson), 1998 p.112 In 1938, she married writer Vasily Abgarovich Katanyan and they spent forty years together. Lilya Brik died by suicide at the age of 87 when she was terminally ill. She left sculptures and writings. Recently published letters between the sisters in the course of more than five decades (except six years of World War II) reveal insights into life and cultural exchange across the Iron Curtain. NKVD agent Speculations about Lilya's and Osip's involvement with the NKVD and State Political Directorate started during their lifetime. According to the Swedish critic and Mayakovsky's biographer , Boris Pasternak once told Roman Jakobson that Lilya Brik \\"frightened\\" him by saying that her guests would start supper \\"right after Osya returns from Cheka\\", and that he later called their apartment \\"Moscow police department\\".Bengt Jangfeldt (2014). Mayakovsky: A Biography. Translated by Harry D. Watson. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. There's also a well-known story how someone ‚Äì supposedly Sergei Yesenin ‚Äì wrote a joke poem on Briks' doors with chalk that read \\"You think that Brik lives here, a language specialist? A fink lives here and a —Åhekist\\".Arkady Vaksberg (1998). Lilya Brik. Life and Fate. Moscow: Olymp.

Translated by Milena Michalski and Sylva Rubashova; poetry translated by Peter Norman. In her memoirs the artist Elizaveta Lavinskaya, a friend of Briks and Mayakovsky, mentions that at some point new persons started visiting the LEF meetings, including Yakov Agranov, Zakhar Volovich and some other people later identified as high-ranking NKVD officers.Anatoly Valyushevich (2015). Fifteen Years after Mayakovsky. Lilya Brik ‚Äì the Wife of Commander. Volume 1. Moscow: Cabinet scientist. A number of people also speculated about the sexual relationships between Lylia and Agranov, including the acclaimed Soviet ballet dancer Maya Plisetskaya in her book.Maya Plisetskaya (2004). Me, Maya Plisetskaya. Moscow: News Publisher. However, film director , the son of Lylia's third husband Vasily Katanyan, claimed that Brik personally denied those \\"fantasies\\" that \\"started circulating after Agranov's execution\\".Vasili Katanyan (2002). Touching Idols. Moscow: Zakharov Books. In 1990, when closed archives became available, an investigative journalist Valentin Skoryatin published an article in ‚Ññ 5 titled Who, me, shot myself? You don't say! where he talked about the mysterious death of Mayakovsky and the inheritance Lilya received after he passed away. He also made public the NKVD serial numbers of both Osip and Lilya Brik (‚Ññ 24541 and ‚Ññ 15073 respectively). Osip received his ID of the 7th secret department in 1920, while his wife was granted it in 1922. The article was later published as part of the book The Mystery of Vladimir Mayakovsky's Death.

Influence There were attempts to present her as greedy and manipulative femme fatale, but those who knew her noted her altruism and intelligence. She helped many aspiring talents and was acquainted with many leading figures of Russian and international culture, such as Sergei Eisenstein, Lev Kuleshov, Boris Pasternak, Vsevolod Meyerhold, Kazimir Malevich, Sergei Paradjanov, Maya Plisetskaya, Rodion Shchedrin, Andrei Voznesensky, Yves St. Laurent and Pablo Picasso. Lilya Brik \\"Russian Books (Please) in all branches of knowledge\\", 1924 Poster by Alexander Rodchenko Lilya Brik's idiomatically posed portrait appeared on the cover of LEF magazine (Leftist Front of Arts) in the 1920s, a magazine concerning Dada and Constructivist art. The portrait, designed by Alexander Rodchenko, has been reworked into other designs, including as cover art for Franz Ferdinand (album You Could Have It So Much Better, 2004), Beyonc√© and Robyn.  Mayakovsky's poem '–ü—Ä–æ –≠—Ç–æ' (About This)  The main subject of this epic poem was love in itself. After a brief separation, at a Christmas-time before 1922, Mayakovsky wrote a kind of proto-surrealist poem in which he allegorized the feeling of missing Lilya. Some parts reflect themes akin to what Angelo Maria Ripellino once called the \\"revolt of the objects\\". In a telephone conversation, for example, the poet sees the spoken word as a dinosaur that crawls through the line, whereas the entire house shakes as the phone bell rings.

In the university, Brik studied law; his friend Roman Jakobson wrote: \\"For his doctoral thesis he wanted to write about the sociology and juridical status of prostitutes and would frequent the boulevards. All the prostitutes there knew him, and he always defended them, for free, in all their affairs, in their confrontations with the police and so on.\\"Roman Jakobson, My Futurist Years (Marsilio Publishers, 1997: ), p. 43. But he soon found himself far more interested in poetry and poetics and devoted all his time to it, becoming one of the founders of OPOJAZ and writing one of the first important formalist studies of sounds in poetry, Zvukovye povtory (\\"Sound repetitions,\\" 1917). He had a strongly anti-author stance, once going so far as to say that if Pushkin had not written Eugene Onegin, somebody else would have; he wrote that \\"there are no poets or literary figures, there is poetry and literature.\\"Graham Roberts, The Last Soviet Avant-Garde: OBERIU ‚Äì Fact, Fiction, Metafiction (Cambridge University Press, 2006: ), p. 28.

(Later the magazine was renamed Novyi LEF.) Brik was not only a literary modernist, he was strongly left-wing in politics. In December 1918 Brik was involved with Mayakovsky in discussions with the Vyborg District party school of the Russian Communist Party (RKP(b)) to set up a Futurist organisation affiliated to the party. Named Komfut the organisation was formally founded in January 1919, but was swiftly dissolved following the intervention of Anatoly Lunacharsky. Later, on 8 June 1920, he joined the Cheka. Jakobson wrote of this period: > It was from Bogatyrev, who visited me in Prague in December 1921, that I > learned Brik was in the Cheka.

After Joseph Stalin's rise to power, the Communist regime openly encouraged exclusively socialist realism methods and initiated a campaign to stamp out all culture the Communist Party perceived as dangerous. Most avant garde artists and thinkers suffered persecution, and Brik did not escape this fate. In the 1930s he eked out a living writing articles on Mayakovsky and book reviews; he died in 1945 of a heart attack while climbing the stairs to his Moscow apartment.Vahan D. Barooshian, Brik and Mayakovsky (Mouton, 1978: ), p. 122. His works were not republished in Russia until the mid-1990s. Edward J. Brown summed his career up thus: \\"He wrote little, but his articles on poetic form ... are brilliant formalist analyses of poetic language... and he was probably the most articulate exponent in Lef of the theories of 'social demand' and 'literature of fact.' A man of surpassing intelligence, he was apparently not strong either in performance or in principle.\\"Edward J.

Its history goes back to the building of a Roman fort called Concangis. This Roman fort is the \\"Chester\\" (from the Latin castra) of the town's name; the \\"Street\\" refers to the paved Roman road that ran north‚Äìsouth through the town, and which is now called Front Street. Chester-le-Street is located south of Newcastle upon Tyne and west of Sunderland on the River Wear. The parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert is where the body of St Cuthbert remained for 112 years before being transferred to Durham Cathedral, and the site of the first translation of the Gospels into English, Aldred writing the Old English gloss between the lines of the Lindisfarne Gospels there.Selkirk (2000) pp. 339‚Äì40 The town holds markets Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays. From 1894 until 2009 the town had its own local government district. Originally from 1894, this was the Chester-le-Street Rural District, which covered the town and several outlying villages. In 1909 the inner part of the Rural District was separated out to form the new Chester-le-Street Urban District Council, which covered the town as it was at that time. By 1974, however, the town of Chester-le-Street had expanded far beyond the boundary of the Urban District and during that year's Local Government reorganisation, the Urban District was amalgamated with parts of the remaining Rural District to form the new Chester-le-Street District. The Chester-le-Street District Council was abolished in 2009 when County Durham became a unitary authority as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England, a move that was controversial at the time. History There is evidence of Iron Age use of the River Wear near the town,Purdon (1992) p. 6 but the history of Chester-le- Street starts with the Roman fort of Concangis. This was built alongside the Roman road Cade's Road (now Front Street) and close to the River Wear, around 100 A.D., and was occupied till the Romans left Britain in 410 A.D. At the time the Wear was navigable to at least Concangis, and may also have provided food for the garrisons stationed there.Selkirk (2000) pp. 45‚Äì92 After the Romans left there is no record of who lived there (apart from some wounded soldiers from wars who had to live there), until 883 when a group of monks, driven out of Lindisfarne seven years earlier, stopped there to build a wooden shrine and church to St Cuthbert, whose body they had borne with them. While they were there the town was the centre of Christianity for much of the northeast, because it was the seat of the Bishop of Lindisfarne, making the church a cathedral. There the monks translated into English the Lindisfarne Gospels, which they had brought with them. They stayed for 112 years, leaving in 995 for the safer and more permanent home at Durham.Selkirk (2000) pp. 337‚Äì40 The title has been revived as the Roman Catholic titular see of Cuncacestre. The church was rebuilt in stone in 1054, and despite the loss of its bishopric seems to have retained a degree of wealth and influence. In 1080 most of the huts in the town were burned and many people killed in retaliation for the death of William Walcher, the first prince-bishop, at the hands of an English mob. After this devastation wrought by the Normans the region was left out of the Domesday Book; there was little left to record, and the region was by then being run from Durham by the prince-bishops so held little interest for London.Selkirk (2000) p. 354 Cade's Road did not fall out of use but was hidden beneath later roads which became the Great North Road, the main route from London and the south to Newcastle and Edinburgh. The town's location on the road played a significant role in its development, as well as its name, as inns sprang up to cater for the travelling trade: both riders and horses needed to rest on journeys usually taking days to complete. This trade reached a peak in the early 19th century as more and more people and new mail services were carried by stagecoach, before falling off with the coming of the railways. The town was bypassed when the A167 was routed around the town, and this was later supplanted by the faster A1(M).Purdon (1992) p. 16 The coal industry also left its mark on the town. From the late 17th century onwards coal was dug in increasing quantities in the region. Mining was centred around the rivers, for transportation by sea to other parts of the country, and Chester-le-Street was at the centre of the coal being dug and shipped away down the Wear, so a centre of coal related communication and commerce. At the same time the growth of the mines and the influx of miners supported local businesses, not just the many inns but new shops and services, themselves bringing in more people to work in them. These people would later work in new industries established in the town to take advantage of its good communications and access to raw materials.Selkirk (2001) pp. 391‚Äì427 One of the most tragic episodes in the town's history and that of the coal industry in NE England occurred during a miners' strike during the winter of 1811/12.William Page, The Victorian History of the County of Durham 3 volumes (London, 1907), vol II, p. 153 Collieries owned by the Dean and Chapter of Durham Cathedral were brought to a standstill by the strike, causing much hardship amongst the people of the town. The strike was broken on New Year's Day, 1 January 1812, when the Bishop of Durham, Shute Barrington, sent a detachment of troops from Durham Castle to force a return to work. It is thought that this uncharacteristic act by Barrington was due to pressure from the national government in Westminster who were concerned that the strike was affecting industrial output of essential armaments for the Napoleonic Wars. =The Jarrow March= On the evening of 5 October 1936 the Jarrow Marchers stopped at the town centre after their first day's walk. The church hall was used to house them before they continued onward the following day. Etymology The Romans called their fort Concangis or Concagium, a Latinisation of the Celtic name for the area, which also gave name to the waterway through the town, Cong Burn. The precise name is uncertain as it does not appear in Roman records, but Concangis is the name most cited today.Selkirk (2001) p. 45Purdon (1992) p. 8 Although a meaning \\"Place of the horse people\\" has been given, scholarly authorities consider the meaning of the name obscure. Old English forms of the name include CuneceastraPurdon (1992) p. 10 and Conceastre,Selkirk (2000) p. 337 which takes its first two syllables from the Roman name, with the addition of the Old English word ceaster 'Roman fortification'. This was shortened over time to Chester, the name used locally for the town (Latinised as Cestria).For example the old bell in St Mary and St Cuthbert is inscribed in Latin But \\"Chester\\" is a common name for towns in England, and in the Middle Ages \\"Street\\", for the Roman road, was added. The Universal etymological English dictionary of 1749 gives the town as \\"Chester upon Street\\" (and describes it as \\"a Village in the Bishoprick of Durham\\"). At some point this was shortened to the modern form. Climate Flooding on Front Street in 2007 The town has a mild climate and gets well below average rainfall relative to the UK. It does though experience occasional floods. To the east of the town lies the Riverside cricket ground and Riverside Park. They were built on the flood plains of the River Wear, and are often flooded when the river bursts its banks. The town centre is subject to occasional flash flooding, usually after very heavy rain over the town and surrounding areas, if the rain falls too quickly for it to be drained away by Cong Burn. The flooding occurs at the bottom of Front Street where the Cong Burn passes under the street, after it was enclosed in concrete in 1932. Landmarks Parish church of St Mary and St Cuthbert John Leland described Chester-le-Street in the 1530s as \\"Chiefly one main street of very mean building in height.\\", a sentiment echoed by Daniel Defoe. =St Mary and St Cuthbert church= St Mary and St Cuthbert church possesses a rare surviving anchorage, one of the best-preserved in the country. It was built for an anchorite, an extreme form of hermit. His or her walled-up cell had only a slit to observe the altar and an opening for food, while outside was an open grave for when the occupant died. It was occupied by six anchorites from 1383 to c. 1538, and is now a museum known as the Anker's House. The north aisle is occupied by a line of Lumley family effigies, only five genuine, assembled circa 1590. Some have been chopped off to fit and resemble a casualty station at Agincourt, according to Sir Simon Jenkins in his England's Thousand Best Churches. It is Chester-le-Street's only Grade I listed building. =Chester Burn viaduct= The viaduct to the northwest of the town centre was completed in 1868 for the North Eastern Railway, to enable trains to travel at high speed on a more direct route between Newcastle and Durham. It is over 230m long with 11 arches, now spanning a road and supermarket car-park, and is a Grade II listed building. =Lumley Castle= Lumley Castle was built in 1388. It sits upon the eastern bank of the River Wear and overlooks the town and the Riverside Park. =Bethel United Reformed church= The small United Reformed Church on Low Chare, just off the main Front Street, was built in 1814 as the Bethel Congregational Chapel and remodelled in 1860. It is still in use and is a Grade II listed building. =The Queens Head Hotel= The Queens Head Hotel, locally known as The Queens Head, is located in the central area of the Front Street. It was built over 250 years ago when this road was the main route from Edinburgh and Newcastle to the south and London. It is set back from the street and is still one of the largest buildings in the street and so the town centre, and is a Grade II listed building. =The Post Office= Chester-le- Street Post Office at 137 Front Street is in the Art Deco style and replaced a smaller building located on the corner of Relton Terrace and Ivanhoe Terrace, and was opened in 1936. It is unusual in that it is one of a handfulThe website http://britishpostofficearchitects.weebly.com/ lists Bradford-on-Avon, Builth Wells, Havant, March and Wallingford of post offices that display the royal cypher from the brief reign of Edward VIII.

Since 1999, the ground has hosted many international fixtures, usually involving the England cricket team. The ground was also host to two fixtures at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, and three fixtures at the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The town also has its own cricket club, Chester-le-Street Cricket Club based at the Ropery Lane ground. They are the current Champions of the North East Premier League, won the national ECB 45 over tournament in 2009 and reached the quarter final of the national 20/20 club championship in 2009. =Rowing= Blade colours of Chester-le-Street rowing club Chester-le- Street Amateur Rowing Club is based on the River Wear near the Riverside cricket ground and has been there for over 100 years. During the summer months the club operate mainly on the river, but in the winter move to indoor sessions during the evenings and use the river at weekends. The Club has over 160 members of which 90 are junior members, with numbers increasing annually. The club are well thought of by British Rowing as a lead club for junior development with many juniors now competing at GB level, and some competing for GB at international events. =Football= Medieval football was once played in the town. The game was played annually on Shrove Tuesday between the \\"Upstreeters\\" and \\"Downstreeters\\". Play started at 1 pm and finished at 6 pm. To start the game, the ball was thrown from a window in the centre of the town and in one game more than 400 players took part. The centre of the street was the dividing line and the winner was the side where the ball was (Up or Down) at 6 pm. It was played from the Middle Ages until 1932, when it was outlawed by the police and people trying to carry on the tradition were arrested.Purdon (1992) pp. 21‚Äì22 Chester-le-Street Town F.C. were founded in 1972 and compete in the Northern Football League Division Two. Transport =Road= At the time of the football matches 'Front Street' was actually the A1 road from London to Edinburgh. A bypass was built in the 1950s, which still exists today as the A167. The bypass road itself was partly bypassed by, and partly incorporated in, the A1(M) motorway in the 1970s. The northern end of Front Street used to be the start of the A6127, which is the road that would continue through Birtley, Gateshead, and eventually over the Tyne Bridge and become the A6127(M) central motorway in Newcastle upon Tyne. However, when the Gateshead-Newcastle Western Bypass of the A1(M) was opened, many roads in this area were renumbered, following the convention that roads originating between single digit A roads take their first digit from the single digit A road in an anticlockwise direction from their point of origin, and Newcastle Road, which was formerly designated A1, is now unclassified. The A6127 was renamed the A167. Car traffic is now banned from the northern part of Front Street and it is restricted to buses, cyclists and delivery vehicles for the shops. =Rail= Chester-le-Street Railway Station Chester-le-Street railway station, on the East Coast Main Line of the National Rail network, between Newcastle and Durham, opened in 1868. It offers local connections and cross- country train services. , train operators serving the station are CrossCountry, TransPennine Express and Northern. A local independent company, Chester-le-Track, has operated the station since 1999, as an agent for Arriva Trains Northern and Northern Rail, but ceased trading from close of business on Saturday 31 March 2018. The station is now staffed on a part-time basis by Northern Rail. The town is mentioned in the 1963 song \\"Slow Train\\" by Flanders and Swann: > No churns, no porter, no cat on a seat, At Chorlton-cum-Hardy or Chester-le- > Street. =Bus= The town is the original home of The Northern General Transport [Bus] Company, nowadays Go North East, and the company still operates from the Picktree Lane Depot. It also pioneered the use of Minilink bus services in the North East in 1985.

Kaitoke (sometimes called Pakuratahi), part of Upper Hutt City, is a locality in the southern North Island of New Zealand. It is located at the northern end of the Hutt Valley, 45 kilometres northeast of Wellington City and six kilometres from the northern end of the Upper Hutt urban area. It also lies at the southern end of the Tararua Ranges. The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of \\"eat worms\\" for Kaitoke. The \\"Puffer\\" tramping track providing access into the Tararua Forest Park climbs from Kaitoke onto and along the Marchant Ridge. This ridge is the part of the Tararuas that is prominently visible from Wellington. The Marchant Track has a side track leading to the Tauherenikau Valley. The end of the Marchant Ridge (after four hours of 'up hill, all the way, both ways') leads to Mount Alpha, and onto The Southern Crossing. The entire track to Alpha skirts the Hutt Water Collection Area. The first Youth Hostel in the North Island was established in the old Ministry of Works barracks at Kaitoke, which were behind the Post Office and alongside the Kaitoke Hall. The Post Office, the Hall, and the Youth Hostel were the only buildings of the settlement. Other facilities include a small airstrip operated by the Upper Valley Gliding Club for the purposes of gliding the area's thermals. The Pakuratahi River flows through the eastern Kaitoke Basin from its source in the Remutaka Ranges. The old route of the Wairarapa Line railway, which closed with the opening of the Rimutaka Tunnel in November 1955, ran from Upper Hutt via Maymorn to Kaitoke and around Goat Rock up the Pakuratahi to the Summit, and from there, because of excessive steepness, the Fell mountain railway system was used to aid trains on the Rimutaka Incline between Summit and Cross Creek. This railway is now the Remutaka Rail Trail. The Hutt River has its source to the north of Kaitoke, and much of the land in the vicinity is used as a water supply reserve. Filming, rafting, swimming and other human activity all take place downstream of the water intake.

Tatlin achieved fame as the architect who designed The Monument to the Third International, more commonly known as Tatlin's Tower, which he began in 1919.Honour, H. and Fleming, J. (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 819. With Kazimir Malevich he was one of the two most important figures in the Soviet avant-garde art movement of the 1920s, and he later became an important artist in the Constructivist movement. Biography Vladimir Tatlin (full name Vladimir Yevgrafovich Tatlin) was born in Moscow, Russian Empire. His father, Yevhraf Nikoforyvych Tatlin was a hereditary nobleman from Oryol, a mechanical engineer graduated from the Technological Institute in St.Petersburg and employed by the Moscow-Brest Railway in Moscow. His mother, Nadezhda Nikolaevna Tatlina (Bart), was a poet sympathizing the Narodnaya Volya revolutionary movement. After she died in 1887, his father married again and resettled to Kharkiv. His father, by whom he lived after having failed to study in Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture died in 1904, so young Vladimir had to interrupt his studies at the Kharkov Arts School and to leave for Odessa to become a merchant sea cadet. According to his own memories, sea and distant lands gave him both means of subsistence and source of inspiration; he sailed all across the Black Sea and also to Egypt. In 1905 he started and in 1910 successfully completed his studies at N.Selivestrov Penza Art School in Penza. During the summer vacations he traveled to Moscow and St.Petersburg to participate in various art events. In 1911 he resettled to Moscow to live by his uncle and began his art career as an icon painter. He also sang in Ukrainian and was a professional musician-bandurist, and performed as such abroad.http://en.uartlib.org/exclusive/tatlin-graye-na-banduri/ Tatlin became familiar with the work of Pablo Picasso during a trip to Paris in 1913.Gray, Camilla, (1986) The Russian Experiment in Art 1863-1922. rev. by Marian Burleigh-Motley. London: Thames & Hudson. p. 174. Tatlin achieved fame as the architect who designed the huge Monument to the Third International, also known as Tatlin's Tower. Planned from 1919, the monument was to be a tall tower in iron, glass and steel which would have dwarfed the Eiffel Tower in Paris (the Monument to the Third International was a third taller at 400 meters high). Inside the iron-and-steel structure of twin spirals, the design envisaged three building blocks, covered with glass windows, which would rotate at different speeds (the first one, a cube, once a year; the second one, a pyramid, once a month; the third one, a cylinder, once a day). For financial and practical reasons, however, the tower was never built.Janson, H.W. (1995) History of Art. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 820. Singh, Iona (2012) Aesthetic World in the Future - chapter from Color, Facture, Art & Design. Hampshire: Zero Books, p. 104-128. Tatlin was also regarded as a progenitor of Soviet post- Revolutionary Constructivist art with his pre-Revolutionary counter-reliefs, three-dimensional constructions made of wood and metal,Tatlin, Vladimir Evgrafovich: Counter-relief (Material Assortment). The State Tretyakov Gallery, 2013. Retrieved 10 May 2013. some placed in corners (corner counter- reliefs) and others more conventionally.Boersma, Linda S. (1994) The Last Futurist Exhibition of Painting: 0,10. Rotterdam: 010 Publishers, p. 63. Tatlin conceived these sculptures in order to question the traditional ideas of art, though he did not regard himself as a Constructivist and objected to many of the movement's ideas. Later prominent constructivists included Varvara Stepanova, Alexander Rodchenko, Manuel Rend√≥n Seminario, Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a, L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, Antoine Pevsner and Naum Gabo. Although colleagues at the beginning of their careers, Tatlin and Malevich quarrelled fiercely and publicly at the time of the 0.10 Exhibition in 1915 (long before the birth of Constructivism), also called \\"the last futurist exhibition\\", apparently over the 'suprematist' works Malevich exhibited there. This led Malevich to develop his ideas further in the city of Vitebsk, where he found a school called UNOVIS (Champions of the new art). Tatlin also dedicated himself to the study of clothes, and various objects, and flight, culminating in the construction of Letatlin personal flying apparatus. In the year of 1930 he taught in Kiev where one of his students was Joseph Karakis. From the 1930s Tatlin worked for different theatres in Moscow and during the Great Patriotic War, in Gorkiy. In 1948 he was heavily criticized for his allegedly anti-communist stance and lost his job, but was not repressed. Tatlin died in 1953 in Moscow and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery.

Born in County Cork, Ireland, Cleburne served in the 41st Regiment of Foot, a Welsh regiment of the British Army, after failing to gain entrance into Trinity College of Medicine in 1846. He immigrated to the United States three years later. At the beginning of the Civil War, Cleburne sided with the Confederate States. He progressed from being a private soldier in the local militia to a division commander. Cleburne participated in many successful military campaigns, especially the Battle of Stones River, the Battle of Missionary Ridge and the Battle of Ringgold Gap. He was also present at the Battle of Shiloh. His strategic ability gained him the nickname \\"Stonewall of the West\\". He was killed in 1864 at the Battle of Franklin. Early life Cleburne was born in Ovens, County Cork, Ireland, the second son of Dr. Joseph Cleburne, a middle-class physician of Anglo-Irish ancestry. Patrick's mother died when he was 18 months old, and he was an orphan at 15. He followed his father into the study of medicine, but failed his entrance exam to Trinity College of Medicine in 1846. In response to this failure, he enlisted in the 41st Regiment of Foot of the British Army, subsequently rising to the rank of corporal.Welsh, pp. 40‚Äì41. Three years later, Cleburne bought his discharge and emigrated to the United States with two brothers and a sister. After spending a short time in Ohio, he settled in Helena, Arkansas, where he was employed as a pharmacist and was readily accepted into the town's social order. During this time, Cleburne became close friends with Thomas C. Hindman, who would later parallel his course as a Confederate Major General. The two men also formed a business partnership with William Weatherly to buy a newspaper, the Democratic Star, in December 1855. In 1856, Cleburne and Hindman were both wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena with members of the Know-Nothing Party following a debate. Cleburne was shot in the back, turned around and shot one of his attackers, killing him. The attackers hid until Cleburne collapsed on the street and then left. After the two recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to all charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi.Hook, pp. 14‚Äì15. By 1860, he was a naturalized citizen, a practicing lawyer, and very popular with the local residents.Joslyn, p. 26. American Civil War When the issue of secession reached a crisis, Cleburne sided with the Southern states. His choice was not due to any love of slavery, which he claimed not to care about, but out of affection for the Southern people who had adopted him as one of their own. As the crisis mounted, Cleburne joined the local militia company (the Yell Rifles) as a private soldier. He was soon elected captain. He led the company in the seizure of the U.S. Arsenal in Little Rock in January 1861. When Arkansas left the Union, the Yell Rifles became part of the 1st Arkansas Infantry. Cleburne's regiment was assigned to the force under William Hardee, training in northeast Arkansas and conducting brief operations in southeast Missouri before Hardee's force was ordered to cross the Mississippi River and join Albert Sidney Johnston's Army of Central Kentucky in the fall 1861. The 1st Arkansas was designated the 15th Arkansas in late 1861. Cleburne was promoted to brigadier general on March 4, 1862. Battle of Missionary Ridge, November 25, 1863 Cleburne's statue at Ringgold Gap, Georgia by sculptor Ron Tunison Johnston withdrew his army from Bowling Green, Kentucky, through Tennessee, and into Mississippi before electing to attack the invading Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant. Cleburne served at the Battle of Shiloh, leading a division on left side of the Confederate line, as well as at the Siege of Corinth. That fall, Cleburne and his men were transported to Tennessee in preparation of Braxton Bragg's Confederate Heartland Offensive. In that campaign, Cleburne was loaned to Edmund Kirby Smith, whose smaller army lead the invasion. At the Battle of Richmond (Kentucky), Cleburne was wounded in the face when a minie ball pierced his left cheek, smashed several teeth, and exited through his mouth, but he recovered in time to re-join Hardee and Bragg and participate in the Battle of Perryville.Fredriksen, pp. 105‚Äì07.Major General Patrick Ronayne Cleburne, CSA (1828-1864) After the Army of Tennessee retreated to its namesake state in late 1862, Cleburne was promoted to division command and served at the Battle of Stones River, where his division advanced three miles as it routed the Union right wing and drove it back to the Nashville Pike and its final line of defense. He was promoted to major general on December 13.Eicher, p. 176. During the campaigns of 1863 in Tennessee, Cleburne and his soldiers fought at the Battle of Chickamauga. They successfully resisted a much larger Union force under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman on the northern end of Missionary Ridge during the Battle of Missionary Ridge, and Joseph Hooker at the Battle of Ringgold Gap in northern Georgia, in which Cleburne's men again protected the Army of Tennessee as it retreated to Tunnel Hill, Georgia. Cleburne and his troops received an official Thanks from the Confederate Congress for their actions during this campaign. Cleburne's strategic use of terrain, his ability to hold ground where others failed, and his talent in foiling the movements of the enemy earned him fame, and gained him the nickname \\"Stonewall of the West.\\" Federal troops were quoted as dreading to see the blue flag of Cleburne's Division across the battlefield.Reynolds, pp. 244‚Äì47. General Robert E. Lee referred to him as \\"a meteor shining from a clouded sky\\".Rand, p. 138. =Proposal for Emancipation and Enlistment of Negroes= By late 1863, it had become obvious to Cleburne that the Confederacy was losing the war because of the growing limitations of its manpower and resources.Connelly, pp. 318-19. In 1864, he dramatically called together the leadership of the Army of Tennessee and put forth the proposal to emancipate all slaves (\\"emancipating the whole race upon reasonable terms, and within such reasonable time\\") in order to \\"enlist their sympathies\\" and thereby enlist them in the Confederate Army to secure Southern independence.Daniel Mallock. \\"Cleburne's Proposal.\\" North & South, vol. 11, no. 2, p. 64.Hamner, Christopher. \\"Black Confederates.\\" Teachinghistory.org. Accessed 30 June 2011. Cleburne argued that emancipation did not have to include black equality, noting that \\"necessity and wise legislation\\" would ensure relations between blacks and whites would not materially change.Levin 2005, pp 102-103 This proposal was met with polite silence at the meeting, and while word of it leaked out, it went unremarked, much less officially recognized. From his letter outlining the proposal:Official Records, Series I, vol. 52, Part 2, pp. 586‚Äì92. Cleburne's proposal was vigorously attacked as an \\"abolitionist conspiracy\\" by General William H.T. Walker, who strongly supported slavery and also saw Cleburne as a rival for promotion. Walker eventually persuaded the commander of the Army of Tennessee, General Braxton Bragg, that Cleburne was politically unreliable and undeserving of further promotion. \\"Three times in the summer of 1863 he was passed over for corps commander and remained a division commander until his death.\\"TL Connelly. (2001) Autumn of Glory: The Army of Tennessee, 1862‚Äì1865 Pages 319‚Äì320. Death and legacy Battle of Franklin Prior to the campaigning season of 1864, Cleburne became engaged to Susan Tarleton of Mobile, Alabama.Joslyn, p. 100. Their marriage was never to be, as Cleburne was killed during an ill- conceived assault (which he opposed) on Union fortifications at the Battle of Franklin, just south of Nashville, Tennessee, on November 30, 1864. He was last seen advancing on foot toward the Union line with his sword raised, after his horse was shot out from under him.Du Bose, p. 401. Accounts later said that he was found just inside the Federal line and his body carried back to an aid station along the Columbia Turnpike. Confederate war records indicate he died of a shot to the abdomen, or possibly a bullet that went through his heart. When Confederates found his body, he had been picked clean of any valuable items, including his sword, boots and pocket watch.Foote, p. 671. Memorial to Cleburne in Franklin St. John's Episcopal Church According to a letter written to General Cheatham from Judge Mangum post war, Cleburne's remains were first laid to rest at Rose Hill Cemetery in Columbia, Tennessee. At the urging of Army Chaplain Bishop Quintard, Judge Mangum, staff officer to Cleburne and his law partner in Helena, Cleburne's remains were moved to St. John's Episcopal Church near Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, where they remained for six years. He had first observed St. John's during the Army of Tennessee's march into Tennessee during the campaign that led to the Battle of Franklin and commented that it was the place he would like to be buried because of its great beauty and resemblance to his Irish homeland. In 1870, he was disinterred and returned to his adopted hometown of Helena, Arkansas, with much fanfare, and buried in the Confederate section of Maple Hill Cemetery, overlooking the Mississippi River.Jacobson and Rupp, pp. 414, 434‚Äì35; Welsh, pp. 40‚Äì41. William J. Hardee, Cleburne's former corps commander, had this to say when he learned of his loss: \\"Where this division defended, no odds broke its line; where it attacked, no numbers resisted its onslaught, save only once; and there is the grave of Cleburne.\\" Several geographic features are named after Patrick Cleburne, including Cleburne County in Alabama and Arkansas, and the city of Cleburne, Texas. The location where he was killed in Franklin, Tennessee was reclaimed by preservationists and is now known as Cleburne Park. Though the small monument in the park is often perceived as a monument to Cleburne, it actually is a marker to show where The Carter Family Cotton Gin once stood (the gin being an integral part of the Battle of Franklin, and The Carter House itself being the headquarters of Union Brigadier General Jacob D. Cox). The Patrick R. Cleburne Confederate Cemetery is a memorial cemetery in Jonesboro, Georgia that was named in honor of General Patrick Cleburne.Georgia Building Authority (1997). Patrick R.

He was responsible for planning and supervising the unsuccessful defense of northwestern Arkansas during the fall and winter of 1862. Shortly after he was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Hindman moved with his family to Jacksonville, Alabama, and later Ripley, Mississippi. After receiving his primary education in Ripley, he attended the Lawrenceville Classical Institute (now known as the Lawrenceville School) and graduated with honors. Afterwards, he raised a company in Tippah County for the 2nd Mississippi regiment in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Hindman served during the war as a lieutenant and later as a captain of his company. After the war, he returned to Ripley. He studied law, and was admitted to the state bar in 1851. He started a law practice in Ripley, and served as a member of the Mississippi House of Representatives from 1854 to 1856. Hindman moved his law practice to Helena, Arkansas, after his term in the Mississippi House ended. He was elected as the Democratic Representative from Arkansas's 1st congressional district in the Thirty-sixth Congress from March 4, 1859, to March 4, 1861. He was re-elected to the Thirty-seventh Congress, but declined to serve after the onset of the Civil War and Arkansas' secession from the Union. Instead, Hindman joined the armed forces of the Confederacy. He was promoted to brigadier general on September 28, 1861, and to major general on April 18, 1862. He commanded the Trans-Mississippi Department, and later raised and commanded \\"Hindman's Legion\\" for the Confederate States Army. After the war, Hindman avoided surrender to the federal government by fleeing to Mexico City. He worked in Mexico as a coffee planter and attempted to practice law. After the execution of Maximilian I of Mexico in 1867, Hindman submitted a petition for a pardon to United States President Andrew Johnson, but it was denied. Hindman, nonetheless, returned to his former life in Helena. He became the leader of the \\"Young Democracy\\", a new political organization that was willing to accept the Reconstruction for the restoration of the Union. He was assassinated on September 27, 1868, at his Helena home.Little Rock Arkansas State Gazette, September 29, 1868. Family background Thomas Carmichael Hindman Jr.'s parents, Thomas Hindman and Sallie Holt Hindman, were of English and Scottish ancestry.Neal (1997), p1. His maternal ancestors included Major Robert Holt, a successful planter and a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1655. The Holt family originally came from Halifax County, Virginia, before moving to Knoxville. Hindman's paternal lineage descended from the Carmichael clan in Scotland, some members of which made their way into America after King George II of Great Britain ousted nine hundred Scottish followers of Bonnie Prince Charles to America after the April 16, 1746 Battle of Culloden. One of the descendants of the Carmichael clan, Sarah Carmichael, married Samuel Hindman, a wealthy Pennsylvania merchant in the early 1790s. They then moved to Knoxville, and their youngest son Thomas C. Hindman, Sr. was born on November 10, 1793. Family legend claims that Hindman, Sr. was the first white male child born in Knoxville. Hindman Sr. was an ensign in the 39th United States Infantry during the War of 1812. He was promoted to third lieutenant on January 11, 1814, and to second lieutenant on May 20 of the same year. He fought in the Battle of New Orleans, the final major battle of the war, and served on active duty until he resigned on June 30, 1816, due to health concerns.Thomas C. Hindman to Andrew Jackson, March 26, 1816, Andrew Jackson Papers, Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. After leaving the army, Hindman, Sr. operated a military ferry on the Tennessee River and served as a lieutenant colonel in the 10th Territorial Militia Regiment for the Alabama Territory. In his dealings as a merchant, he met Lewis Ross. Hindman, Sr. was a frequent visitor at the Ross household, and it was there that he met Lewis' sister-in-law, Sallie Holt.Neal (1997), p2. After a brief courtship, the couple was married in Knoxville on January 21, 1819.Receipt, June 21, 1818, in Andrew Jackson Papers, Library of Congress, Washington D.C. After settling down in Rhea County, Tennessee, their first daughter was born in 1820. Three more children, Robert, Mary, and Sarah, were born after the family moved to Post Oak Springs. The family moved back to Knoxville in 1827. Thomas Carmichael Hindman, Jr. was born the next year, and Mildred followed in the year after that. Early life and education The elder Hindman frequently made business trips to Alabama and even moved the family to Jacksonville after buying several lots of land there. He took advantage of the many local business opportunities and was able to provide his family with whatever they needed. He also gained a reputation for honesty with his business associates, which included Cherokee Indian tribes in the area.Neal (1997), p3. Hindman became trusted by the Cherokee Nation and was appointed as the sub-agent to the Cherokees by President James Monroe. After Andrew Jackson became president, Hindman, Sr. was appointed to the post of United States Agent for the Cherokee Nation.Elizabeth Pack to Major General Thomas C. Hindman, December 15, 1862, Thomas C. Hindman Collection, Phillips County Museum, Helena, Arkansas. The elder Hindman frequently traveled to Washington D.C. to discuss the interests of the Cherokee Nation, and in 1841 was assigned by Acting Secretary of War Albert M. Lea to determine why the Cherokees in North Carolina had rejected the government's suggestion to join other parts of the tribe in Indian Territory. Hindman spent almost two months unsuccessfully trying to persuade the North Carolina Cherokees to rejoin the rest of their nation further West. That year, Hindman's father purchased a new plantation in Ripley, Mississippi. Meanwhile, the younger Hindman attended local schools before leaving for the Lawrenceville Classical Institute in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, the third oldest boarding school in the country.Neal (1997), p4. Hindman received a classical education there and graduated with honors on September 25, 1843,Thomas C. Hindman's son, Biscoe, claims that his father had entered Lawrenceville Classical Institute at the age of fourteen and had graduated four years later. Schools records indicate that he was a member of the class of 1843, which means he would have been fifteen at the time of graduation. as the class salutatorian.Closing Exercises of the Lawrenceville Classical Commercial High School, September 25, 1843, John Dixon Library, The Lawrenceville School, Lawrenceville, New Jersey. After spending some time visiting relatives and studying in New York, Hindman went back to Ripley and commenced his law studies under Orlando Davis, a notable local attorney and Whig Party politician. Meanwhile, Hindman's father became an active participant in Mississippi politics. He led the state's Whig Party and served as a member of the executive committee of the local Henry Clay club. In 1845, he was selected as a delegate to attend a convention in Memphis, Tennessee, that promoted transportation and infrastructural projects in the South and West.Ripley, Mississippi Advertiser, November 1, 1845. Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Soon, the United States Army engaged in fighting at the US-Mexico border. After skirmishes along the Rio Grande between Mexican forces and American forces led by General Zachary Taylor, Congress approved a declaration of war and President James K. Polk called upon the states to draw up 50,000 volunteers to be alongside the army. Mississippi newspapers encouraged state residents to join the action. One newspaper, the Holly Springs Guard, proclaimed, \\"To arms! To arms! Ye brave! Th' avenging sword unsheathe: March on, march on, all hearts resolved, on [to] victory or death.\\"Holly Springs, Mississippi Guard, page 8, May 29, 1846. Hindman was eager to have the chance of serving his country in war. He enlisted as a second lieutenant in company E of the Second Mississippi Infantry.Military Service Record of Thomas C. Hindman, Jr., National Archives and Records Administration, Washington D.C. His older brother, Robert, also joined the same unit as a private.Military Service Record of Robert H. Hindman, National Archives and Records Administration, Washington D.C. Hindman and his fellow infantrymen spent the winter training for battle in Camp McClung. Many soldiers were unprepared for the cold temperatures in January 1847 and, as a result, many died of influenza, pneumonia and \\"the cold plague\\". The Second Mississippi Infantry headed off towards the United States‚ÄìMexico border in February and reached the mouth of the Rio Grande on February 24, 1847, just a day after the Battle of Buena Vista. They continued marching, and the number of deaths escalated. By June 1847, 167 men had died, 134 had been discharged, and 38 had deserted. The infantry later moved to Buena Vista, seven miles (11 km) south of Saltillo, Coahuila, for guard duty. The anticipation of glory for the regiment evaporated amongst the ravages of disease, guerrilla raids, and camp duties. In March 1847, Colonel Charles Clark assigned Hindman the position of appointment as the acting regiment's adjutant, due to his educational background and writing skills.Neal (1997), p11. Hindman's brother, Robert, who was now a sergeant, suffered from smallpox and was medically discharged on April 23. Hindman rose to the rank of lieutenant and post adjutant by the end of the war in 1848, but did not see any major action during the remainder of his time with the infantry.Dunbar (1988), p684. Back in Mississippi After returning to Ripley, Hindman continued his law studies under Orlando Davis. A year after the war ended, Hindman's brother, Robert, engaged in a fight with William Falkner because he thought that Falkner had tried to block his membership into the Ripley section of the Sons of Temperance. Robert Hindman tried to defend himself, but his gun failed to fire, and Falkner then fatally stabbed him. Falkner was tried for murder, but was acquitted by the jury which ruled that he was acting in self-defense.The State of Mississippi vs. William C. Falkner, Circuit Court, Tippah County Courthouse, Ripley, Mississippi. Afterward, Falkner killed a family friend of the Hindmans, and he again was acquitted in the murder trial.Letter by C. J. Frederick, Falkner's law partner, to the Memphis Daily Appeal, April 20, 1881. Thomas Hindman and Falkner engaged in a gun fight, but neither man was injured. The tense relationship between Falkner and Hindman culminated in a settlement made by Matthew C. Galloway, who would later become the future editor of the Memphis, Tennessee Appeal. Hindman himself joined the Ripley chapter of the Sons of Temperance and served as the recording secretary of the local branch. In 1853, he successfully campaigned for a seat to represent Tippah County in the Mississippi legislature. Hindman's Mississippi lawmaking career ended when the legislature adjourned in March 1854.Neal (1997), p20. Move to Arkansas Photograph of Hindman, By 1854, Hindman realized that he had little room to maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.Sons of Temperance, Minutes, Term Ending March 31, 1854, Item 64. Hindman threw himself into the political and social scenes in his new home state. In June 1854, he formed a law partnership with John Palmer, a young Kentucky native who was known as a \\"distinguished member\\" of the Helena bar. Hindman became active in civic affairs and plans for Helena's economic development. At an Independence Day festival in 1854, he gave a speech about the importance of railroad development in Arkansas.Helena Democratic Star, July 5, 1854. Hindman catapulted himself into the fray by taking a stand against the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic Know-Nothings, whom he considered \\"pestilent fanatics\\".Little Rock True Democrat, June 12, 1855. Hindman and Palmer established a Democratic association designed to stamp out the Know-Nothing threat. During this time, Hindman became close friends with Patrick Cleburne, who would later parallel his course as a Confederate Major General. The two men also formed a business partnership with William Weatherly to buy a newspaper, the Democratic Star, in December 1855.Helena Southern Shield, December 29, 1855. Cleburne and Hindman were both wounded by gunshots during a street fight in Helena with Know-Nothing members. After the men had recovered, they appeared before a grand jury to respond to any charges brought against them. They were exonerated and, afterward, went to Hindman's parents' house in Mississippi.Nash (1895), pp66‚Äì69. Hindman received praise for his actions and became a force in Democratic politics after the Know-Nothings were defeated. In 1856, Hindman ran for the Congressional seat in his First District, but was defeated by the incumbent, Alfred B. Greenwood, at the Democratic state convention.True Democrat, May 20, 1856. His gracious withdrawal at the convention to avoid Democratic infighting earned him more notice from the party hierarchy. During this time, Hindman met and courted Mary \\"Mollie\\" Watkins Biscoe. Despite her parents' reluctance, the two were married on November 11, 1856, with Patrick Cleburne serving as best man.Neal (1997), p39. In the summer of 1857, Hindman became editor of the Helena States-Rights DemocratNash (1895), p75.Southern Shield, July 30, 1857. and was the unchallenged leader of the Democratic Party in eastern Arkansas.Neal (1997), p42. From this platform, he launched his 1858 Congressional bid. He did not face a serious challenge for the Democratic nomination, and had the backing of newspapers throughout the state. Editor Richard H. Johnson of the Little Rock True Democrat reminded voters of Hindman's previous run for the nomination in 1856 and praised him for being a \\"thorough[-]going Democrat\\" of \\"marked abilities\\".True Democrat, February 16, 1858. At the state Democratic convention in Batesville, Hindman easily defeated A. M. Wilson and Dandridge McRae.True Democrat, May 18, 1858.Van Buren Intelligencer, May 21, 1858. In the general election, Hindman defeated the Republican challenger, William M. Crosby, by a vote of 18,255 to 2,853.True Democrat, August 18, 1858. =Bringing down Arkansas's political \\"family\\"= During his term, Hindman tried to bring unity to the state's Democratic Party. He turned on the political hierarchy in the state, and political warfare divided the Democratic Party in Arkansas, with the pro-Hindman forces on one side and the forces of the political \\"family\\" that had ruled Arkansas since territorial days on the other. He labeled the actions of the \\"family\\" as \\"the most concentrated wrath of the small managers of the caucus and of certain outside high-priests who manage[d] them\\".Neal (1997), p47. \\"Family\\" leaders threatened to block Hindman's 1860 re-election to Congress. Hindman challenged them and predicted the overthrow of a group he called \\"the fusionists\\" and \\"champions of amalgamation\\". The dispute between Hindman and the political family escalated after Hindman charged that the state had been overpaying the True Democrat for public printing. The True Democrat denied the allegations and claimed that Hindman's motive was out of selfishness, rather than concern. They argued that he wanted printing contracts to be awarded to the Helena State-Rights Democrat and the Little Rock Old Line Democrat, both of which he controlled.True Democrat, October 26, 1859. One of the \\"family\\" leaders, Elias Nelson Conway, sought to settle the state's banking situation by starting a plan that would seize the assets of people indebted to the bank, who included Hindman's father-in-law. Hindman travelled across the state to publicly denounce the proposition. In the 1860 race for governor, Hindman backed Henry Massey Rector,True Democrat, June 29, 1859. while the \\"family\\" candidate was Richard H. Johnson, the editor of the True Democrat. Johnson had been nominated as the Democratic candidate, but Rector announced his candidacy as an independent Democrat.True Democrat, May 17, 1860. In the gubernatorial election, Rector narrowly defeated Johnson by a vote of 31,044 to 28,967.Neal (1997), p63. After the election, the editor of the Old-Line Democrat, Thomas C. Peek, proclaimed that the end of the political dynasty of the \\"family\\" had come. New issues such as the Civil War were brought to center stage and the \\"family\\" never exercised their dominance over state politics again. American Civil War A portrait of Hindman, taken from Confederate double agent Loreta Janeta Velazquez's The Woman in Battle: A Narrative of the Exploits, Adventures, and Travels of Madame Loreta Janeta Velazquez, Otherwise Known as Lieutenant Harry T. Buford, Confederate States Army As the Civil War approached, Hindman was a passionate voice for secession and was primarily Arkansas's most prominent Fire-Eater. When Arkansas voted 65‚Äì5 to secede from the Union in May 1861, Hindman was present in the gallery of the convention. With war approaching, Hindman resigned from Congress and recruited a regiment at Helena, which was mustered into Confederate service. He made a request to the state government for muskets, clothing and ten days of rations so that his men could \\"fight for our country\\".Arkansas State Gazette, June 1, 1861. By June 1, Hindman had raised ten companies which would eventually become known as the 2nd Arkansas Infantry, with six companies stationed at Helena and four at Pine Bluff. He lost five companies who refused to leave the state to fight. Afterwards, Hindman followed orders to report to Richmond, Virginia. He began the long journey with his regiment in June. By September, Hindman was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. He and his regiment were shipped to Kentucky and reported to superiors William Hardee and Albert Sidney Johnston and the Army of Central Kentucky. After the fall of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Johnston abandoned Kentucky and Tennessee to consolidate his forces at Corinth, Mississippi. Fierce fighting at the Battle of Shiloh in April, soon followed. During the battle, Johnston and Hindman were wounded, Johnston mortally. Command of the Army of Mississippi fell upon General P.G.T. Beauregard, who wrote the following in his report: \\"Brigadier General Hindman, engaged in the outset of the battle, was conspicuous for a cool courage efficiently employed in leading his men ever into the thickest of the fray, until his horse was shot under him, and he was unfortunately so severely injured by the fall that the army was deprived, on the following day, of his chivalrous example.\\" After his recovery, Hindman was promoted to the rank of major-general and commanded the Second Corps of Braxton Bragg's Army of Tennessee during the Siege of Corinth before being appointed commander of the desolate Trans-Mississippi Department to prevent an invasion into eastern Arkansas by Samuel Curtis.Moodey (1881), 1st series, Vol. 3, p715‚Äì716. Events in Arkansas had taken a terrible turn for the worse. Most units had been stripped from the state for service east of the Mississippi River. When Hindman arrived in Little Rock, he found that his command was \\"bare of soldiers, penniless, defenseless, and dreadfully exposed\\" to the Federal Army that was approaching dangerously from the northeast.Neal (1997), p119. Hindman set to work and issued a series of harsh military edicts, instituting conscription, authorizing guerrilla warfare and requisitioning supplies for the defense of the State.Neal (1997), p127. Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas.Neal (1997), p125. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear that they did not have an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.Neal (1997), p131. =In charge of \\"Hindman's Legion\\"= Portrait of Hindman by Aurelius O. Revenaugh, 1906 Hindman's edicts, however, raised the ire of the local citizenry, and his political enemies demanded that the Confederate leaders in Richmond replace him. By August 1862, the authorities in Richmond decided to replace him with the well- meaning but incompetent Theophilus H. Holmes.Neal (1997), p135. Hindman convinced Holmes to give him a field command in northern Arkansas, and he proceeded with a plan to drive out the invader.Neal (1997), p137. Hindman aggressively moved into northwest Arkansas and managed to intercept the Federal army while it was divided into two parts. At this moment, however, Hindman's normally aggressive style gave way to uncharacteristic doubt. Rather than attack the divided pieces of the Federal army, Hindman entrenched himself at Prairie Grove, Arkansas, allowing the Federal forces to recombine and assault him.Neal (1997), p150. Hindman's position was well selected, but the better equipped and supplied Federal forces wore down the Confederate forces and Hindman was forced to withdraw back towards Little Rock, having missed his chance to destroy the Federal army. After the stalemate at Prairie Grove, Hindman was transferred back across the river and participated in the Battle of Chickamauga alongside his friend Pat Cleburne.Neal (1997), pVIII. After being wounded in the neck at Chickamauga,Memphis Daily Appeal, September 23, 1863. Hindman and his Legion continued to fight along with the Army of Tennessee against General William Tecumseh Sherman in the Atlanta Campaign, seeing action across northwestern Georgia from the First Battle of Dalton, to the Battle of Resaca; the Battle of New Hope Church; the Battle of Kolb's Farm; the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, just outside Marietta, Georgia. On July 4, 1864, at Kennesaw Mountain, he was struck in the eye by a tree limb and fell off his horse. Hindman suffered severe injuries that left him unfit for service on the battlefield. He went to Atlanta and later Macon to recuperate from his injuries.Neal (1997), p196. Afterward, Hindman hoped that he would be able to fight after a full recovery. He applied for a transfer to the Trans- Mississippi Department. His request was denied by the Confederate War Department, but Confederate President Jefferson Davis offered Hindman a leave of absence until he had fully recovered from his \\"physical disability\\".Neal (1997), p197. After his leave of absence had been approved in August, Hindman set out for Texas. During their journey, Hindman's second daughter, Sallie, died of an illness near Meridian, Mississippi.Neal (1997), p198. Hindman arrived in San Antonio and settled there with his family for the time being. He was honored by military officials and residents on January 26, 1865.Neal (1997), p200. By May 1865, Confederate generals in New Orleans signed a document with Union generals detailing the Confederate terms of surrender.Neal (1997), p203. Hindman refused to surrender and, along with many other ex- Confederates, he crossed the Rio Grande into Mexico and sought asylum.Neal (1997), p205. Later life Photograph of the Hindman family home in Helena, Arkansas Hindman joined Confederate refugees in the Mexican town of Carlota, where he engaged in coffee planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to United States President Andrew Johnson for a pardon, following the Tenure of Office Act in 1867. Hindman's application was one of the few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although ineligible to run for office, he came out against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a treason indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.Neal (1997), p227. Assassination Hindman Hall museum and gift shop at Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park At around 9:30 on the night of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his newspaper with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house.Neal (1997), p233. With \\"perfect composure\\", Hindman told listeners to \\"unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people\\". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, \\"I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, I forgive him.\\"Nash (1895), p218. He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to \\"take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones\\". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, \\"I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me.\\" Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and he sat down on a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an \\"able and distinguished man\\" whose \\"short but splendid career\\" had a profound impact on Arkansan state politics.Neal (1997), p234. Hindman's assassins were never caught, and many theories regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly confessed to the crime, saying the murder was part of a larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit with the facts of the murder, and his statements were dismissed from the investigation.Neal (1997), p237. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne. Legacy Arkansas Post was named Fort Hindman for him during the American Civil War. Camp No. 656 (reestablished 2010) of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Prairie Grove, Arkansas, is named after him.

It was founded by Kazimir Malevich in Russia, and announced in Malevich's 1915 Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0.10, in St. Petersburg, where he, alongside 13 other artists, exhibited 36 works in a similar style.Honour, H. and Fleming, J. (2009) A World History of Art. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, pp. 793‚Äì795. The term suprematism refers to an abstract art based upon \\"the supremacy of pure artistic feeling\\" rather than on visual depiction of objects. Birth of the movement Kazimir Malevich, Black Circle, motive 1915, painted 1924, oil on canvas, 106.4 √ó 106.4 cm, State Russian Museum, St. Petersburg Kazimir Malevich developed the concept of Suprematism when he was already an established painter, having exhibited in the Donkey's Tail and the Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) exhibitions of 1912 with cubo-futurist works. The proliferation of new artistic forms in painting, poetry and theatre as well as a revival of interest in the traditional folk art of Russia provided a rich environment in which a Modernist culture was born. In \\"Suprematism\\" (Part II of his book The Non-Objective World, which was published 1927 in Munich as Bauhaus Book No. 11), Malevich clearly stated the core concept of Suprematism: Suprematist Composition - White on White, 1918, Museum of Modern Art, New YorkMOMA, The Collection, accessed January 4, 2013 He created a suprematist \\"grammar\\" based on fundamental geometric forms; in particular, the square and the circle. In the 0.10 Exhibition in 1915, Malevich exhibited his early experiments in suprematist painting. The centerpiece of his show was the Black Square, placed in what is called the red/beautiful corner in Russian Orthodox tradition; the place of the main icon in a house. \\"Black Square\\" was painted in 1915 and was presented as a breakthrough in his career and in art in general. Malevich also painted White on White which was also heralded as a milestone. \\"White on White\\" marked a shift from polychrome to monochrome Suprematism. Distinct from Constructivism Malevich's Suprematism is fundamentally opposed to the postrevolutionary positions of Constructivism and materialism. Constructivism, with its cult of the object, is concerned with utilitarian strategies of adapting art to the principles of functional organization. Under Constructivism, the traditional easel painter is transformed into the artist-as-engineer in charge of organizing life in all of its aspects. Suprematism, in sharp contrast to Constructivism, embodies a profoundly anti-materialist, anti-utilitarian philosophy. In \\"Suprematism\\" (Part II of The Non-Objective World), Malevich writes: Jean-Claude Marcad√© has observed that \\"Despite superficial similarities between Constructivism and Suprematism, the two movements are nevertheless antagonists and it is very important to distinguish between them.\\" According to Marcad√©, confusion has arisen because several artists‚Äîeither directly associated with Suprematism such as El Lissitzky or working under the suprematist influence as did Rodchenko and Lyubov Popova‚Äîlater abandoned Suprematism for the culture of materials. Suprematism does not embrace a humanist philosophy which places man at the center of the universe. Rather, Suprematism envisions man‚Äîthe artist‚Äîas both originator and transmitter of what for Malevich is the world's only true reality‚Äîthat of absolute non-objectivity. For Malevich, it is upon the foundations of absolute non-objectivity that the future of the universe will be built - a future in which appearances, objects, comfort, and convenience no longer dominate. Influences on the movement Malevich also credited the birth of suprematism to Victory Over the Sun, Kruchenykh's Futurist opera production for which he designed the sets and costumes in 1913. The aim of the artists involved was to break with the usual theater of the past and to use a \\"clear, pure, logical Russian language\\". Malevich put this to practice by creating costumes from simple materials and thereby took advantage of geometric shapes. Flashing headlights illuminated the figures in such a way that alternating hands, legs or heads disappeared into the darkness. The stage curtain was a black square. One of the drawings for the backcloth shows a black square divided diagonally into a black and a white triangle. Because of the simplicity of these basic forms they were able to signify a new beginning. Another important influence on Malevich were the ideas of the Russian mystic, philosopher, and disciple of Georges Gurdjieff, P. D. Ouspensky, who wrote of \\"a fourth dimension or a Fourth Way beyond the three to which our ordinary senses have access\\".(Gooding, 2001) Kazimir Malevich, Suprematism, 1916-17, Krasnodar Museum of Art Some of the titles to paintings in 1915 express the concept of a non-Euclidean geometry which imagined forms in movement, or through time; titles such as: Two dimensional painted masses in the state of movement. These give some indications towards an understanding of the Suprematic compositions produced between 1915 and 1918. The Supremus journal The Supremus group, which in addition to Malevich included Aleksandra Ekster, Olga Rozanova, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Ivan Kliun, Lyubov Popova, Lazar Khidekel, Nikolai Suetin, Ilya Chashnik, Nina Genke-Meller, Ivan Puni and Ksenia Boguslavskaya, met from 1915 onwards to discuss the philosophy of Suprematism and its development into other areas of intellectual life. The products of these discussions were to be documented in a monthly publication called Supremus, titled to reflect the art movement it championed, that would include painting, music, decorative art, and literature. Malevich conceived of the journal as the contextual foundation in which he could base his art, and originally planned to call the journal Nul. In a letter to a colleague, he explained: Malevich conceived of the journal as a space for experimentation that would test his theory of nonobjective art. The group of artists wrote several articles for the initial publication, including the essays \\"The Mouth of the Earth and the Artist\\" (Malevich), \\"On the Old and the New in Music\\" (Matiushin), \\"Cubism, Futurism, Suprematism\\" (Rozanova), \\"Architecture as a Slap in the Face to Ferroconcrete\\" (Malevich), and \\"The Declaration of the Word as Such\\" (Kruchenykh). However, despite a year spent planning and writing articles for the journal, the first issue of Supremus was never published. El Lissitzky, A Proun, c.1925 El Lissitzky: a bridge to the west The most important artist who took the art form and ideas developed by Malevich and popularized them abroad was the painter El Lissitzky. Lissitzky worked intensively with Suprematism particularly in the years 1919 to 1923. He was deeply impressed by Malevich's Suprematist works as he saw it as the theoretical and visual equivalent of the social upheavals taking place in Russia at the time. Suprematism, with its radicalism, was to him the creative equivalent of an entirely new form of society. Lissitzky transferred Malevich‚Äôs approach to his Proun constructions, which he himself described as \\"the station where one changes from painting to architecture\\". The Proun designs, however, were also an artistic break from Suprematism; the \\"Black Square\\" by Malevich was the end point of a rigorous thought process that required new structural design work to follow. Lissitzky saw this new beginning in his Proun constructions, where the term \\"Proun\\" (Pro Unovis) symbolized its Suprematist origins. Lissitzky exhibited in Berlin in 1923 at the Hanover and Dresden showrooms of Non-Objective Art. During this trip to the West, El Lissitzky was in close contact with Theo van Doesburg, forming a bridge between Suprematism and De Stijl and the Bauhaus. Architecture Lazar Khidekel (1904‚Äì1986), Suprematist artist and visionary architect, was the only Suprematist architect who emerged from the Malevich circle. Khidekel started his study in architecture in Vitebsk art school under El Lissitzky in 1919‚Äì20. He was instrumental in the transition from planar Suprematism to volumetric Suprematism, creating axonometric projections (The Aero-club: Horizontal architecton, 1922‚Äì23), making three-dimensional models, such as the architectons, designing objects (model of an \\"Ashtray\\", 1922‚Äì23), and producing the first Suprematist architectural project (The Workers‚Äô Club, 1926). In the mid-1920s, he began his journey into the realm of visionary architecture. Directly inspired by Suprematism and its notion of an organic form-creation continuum, he explored new philosophical, scientific and technological futuristic approaches, and proposed innovative solutions for the creation of new urban environments, where people would live in harmony with nature and would be protected from man-made and natural disasters (his still topical proposal for flood protection ‚Äì the City on the Water, 1925). Nikolai Suetin used Suprematist motifs on works at the Imperial Porcelain Factory, Saint Petersburg where Malevich and Chashnik were also employed, and Malevich designed a Suprematist teapot. The Suprematists also made architectural models in the 1920s, which offered a different conception of socialist buildings to those developed in Constructivist architecture. Malevich's architectural projects were known after 1922 Arkhitektoniki. Designs emphasized the right angle, with similarities to De Stijl and Le Corbusier, and were justified with an ideological connection to communist governance and equality for all. Another part of the formalism was low regard for triangles which were \\"dismissed as ancient, pagan, or Christian\\".Hanno-Walter Kruft, Elsie Callander, Ronald Taylor, and Antony Wood A history of architectural theory: from Vitruvius to the present Edition 4 Publisher Princeton Architectural Press, 2003 , p. 416 The first Suprematist architectural project was created by Lazar Khidekel in 1926. In the mid 1920s to 1932 Lazar Khidekel also created a series of futuristic projects such as Aero-City, Garden-City, and City Over Water. In the 21st century, architect Zaha Hadid aimed to realize Malevich's work and advance Suprematism by building a completely abstract building. Social context Malevich, Self-Portrait, 1933 This development in artistic expression came about when Russia was in a revolutionary state, ideas were in ferment, and the old order was being swept away. As the new order became established, and Stalinism took hold from 1924 on, the state began limiting the freedom of artists. From the late 1920s the Russian avant-garde experienced direct and harsh criticism from the authorities and in 1934 the doctrine of Socialist Realism became official policy, and prohibited abstraction and divergence of artistic expression. Malevich nevertheless retained his main conception. In his self-portrait of 1933 he represented himself in a traditional way‚Äîthe only way permitted by Stalinist cultural policy‚Äîbut signed the picture with a tiny black-over-white square.

Distribution channels include a retail storefront, a website, or a mail-order catalogue. Multichannel marketing is about choice. The objective of the companies doing the marketing is to make it easy for a consumer to buy from them in whatever way is most appropriate.\\"15-Minute Guide to Multichannel Marketing Communications,\\" http://www.emc.com/collateral/software/15-min- guide/h5107-15-min-multichannel-mktg-comm-gd.pdf To be effective, multichannel marketing needs to be supported by good supply chain management systems, so that the details and prices of goods on offer are consistent across the different channels. It might also be supported by detailed analysis of the return on investment from each different channel, measured in terms of customer response and conversion of sales. The contribution each channel delivers to sales can be assessed via Marketing Mix Modeling or via attribution modelling. Some companies target certain channels at different demographic segments of the market or at different socio-economic groups of consumers. Multichannel marketing allows the retail merchant to reach its prospective or current customer in a channel of his/ her liking. Coordination of online and offline channels Companies that sell branded products and services through local businesses market over both online and offline channels to local audiences. Online and offline multichannel marketing campaigns can either inform one another or are executed in isolation. A proportion of companies use their online marketing efforts to inform their offline advertising (i.e. they test keywords online to understand if they fit with customer intent before printing them in offline ads). Comparison with traditional forms of marketing While multichannel marketing focuses primarily on new media platforms in marketing, traditional approaches use old media such as print sources, telemarketing, direct mail and broadcasting stations such as radio and television. Multichannel marketing does not only use web 2.0 forms but also integrates media convergence models, targeting customer interaction through different platforms such as via text messaging, on a website, email, online video campaigns, GPS to track the location of a customer and their proximity to the product or service. Being able to reach out to customers directly is an important marketing strategy because it is convenient and enhances direct customer interaction. Benefits Some of the long term benefits of this style of marketing include: *Better management of results and sales: Using many communicative platforms to reach the audience increases the chances of receiving feedback from a variety of customers on the overall performance. This feedback gives companies an idea of what the customer wants and what they can improve upon *Higher revenues: The more diverse platforms used in trying to reach customers, the more the potential customers are likely to reach out to purchase goods and services. If the company advertises its brand only on the [internet], it will be very hard to capture the attention of potential customers who do not use the internet regularly and rely on other mediums such as the [television] for example. *Better understanding of customers: By the response from customers, it is easier to understand what they expect from a product or service and how a brand can be improved. To satisfy the needs of a niche, it is necessary to identify the channels and platforms which work for a certain group. *Increased brand visibility and reach: About 36% of shoppers search products on one channel but purchase the product through a different channel.

He is best known as the founder and leader of De Stijl. He was married to artist, pianist and choreographer Nelly van Doesburg.  Early life  Theo van Doesburg was born Christian Emil Marie K√ºpper on 30 August 1883, in Utrecht, the Netherlands, as the son of the photographer and Henrietta Catherina Margadant. After a short training in acting and singing, he decided to become a storekeeper. He always regarded his stepfather, Theodorus Doesburg, to be his natural father, so that his first works are signed with Theo Doesburg, to which he later added the insertion \\"van\\".  Career  Theo van Doesburg, Composition in Gray (Rag- time), 1919, Oil on canvas, 196.5 √ó 59.1 cm (38 √ó 23.3 in), The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation Peggy Guggenheim Collection, Venice, 1976 Girl with Ranunculus, Oil on canvas, 1914, Centraal Museum, Utrecht His first exhibition was in 1908. From 1912 onwards, he supported his works by writing for magazines. He considered himself to be a modern painter, at that time, although his early work is in line with the Amsterdam Impressionists and is influenced by Vincent van Gogh, both in style and subject matter. This suddenly changed in 1913 after reading Wassily Kandinsky's R√ºckblicke, in which he looks back at his life as a painter from 1903 to 1913. It made him realize there was a higher, more spiritual level in painting that originates from the mind rather than from everyday life, and that abstraction is the only logical outcome of this. It was already in 1912 that Van Doesburg was criticizing Futurism in an art article in Eenheid no. 127, on 9 November 1912, because \\"The mimetic expression of velocity (whatever its form may be: the aeroplane, the automobile, and so on) is diametrically opposed to the character of painting, the supreme origin of which is to be found in inner life\\". On 6 November 1915, he wrote in the same journal: \\"Mondrian realizes the importance of line. The line has almost become a work of art in itself; one can not play with it when the representation of objects perceived was all- important. The white canvas is almost solemn. Each superfluous line, each wrongly placed line, any color placed without veneration or care, can spoil everything‚Äîthat is, the spiritual\\".  The De Stijl movement  It was while reviewing an exposition for one of these magazines he wrote for, in 1915 (halfway through his two-year service in the army), that he came in contact with the works of Piet Mondrian, who was eight years older than he was, and had by then already gained some attention with his paintings. Van Doesburg saw in these paintings his ideal in painting: a complete abstraction of reality. Soon after the exposition Van Doesburg got in contact with Mondrian, and together with related artists Bart van der Leck, , Vilmos Husz√°r and Jacobus Oud they founded the magazine De Stijl in 1917. = Promoting De Stijl = Congress of the Union of International Progressive Artists held at D√ºsseldorf, May 1922 Although De Stijl was made up of many members, Van Doesburg was the \\"ambassador\\" of the movement, promoting it across Europe. He moved to Weimar in 1922, deciding to make an impression on the Bauhaus principal, Walter Gropius, to spread the influence of the movement. While Gropius accepted many of the precepts of contemporary art movements he did not feel that Doesburg should become a Bauhaus master. Doesburg then installed himself near to the Bauhaus buildings and started to attract school students interested in the new ideas of Constructivism, Dadaism, and De Stijl.  The split with Mondrian  Composition d√©centralis√©e, 1924, Gouache on board, 11 3/8 x 11 1/2 inches (28.9 x 29.2 cm), Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York Bequest, Richard S. Zeisler, 2007 The friendship between Van Doesburg and Mondrian remained strong in these years, although their primary means of communication was by letter. In 1923 Van Doesburg moved to Paris, together with his later wife Nelly van Moorsel. Because the two men got to see each other on a much more regular basis the differences in character became apparent: Mondrian was an introvert, while van Doesburg was more flamboyant and extravagant. During 1924 the two men had disagreements, which eventually led to a temporary split that year. The exact reason for the split has been a point of contention among art historians; usually the divergent ideas about the directions of the lines in the paintings have been named as the primary reason: Mondrian never accepted diagonals, whereas Doesburg insisted on the dynamic aspects of the diagonal, and indeed featured it in his art. Mondrian accepted some concepts of diagonals, such as in his \\"Lozenge\\" paintings, where the canvas was rotated 45 degrees, while still maintaining horizontal lines. In recent years, however, this theory has been challenged by art historians such as Carel Blotkamp, who cites the artist's different concepts about space and time. After the split, Van Doesburg launched a new concept for his art, Elementarism, which was characterized by the diagonal lines and which rivaled Mondrian's Neo- Plasticism. In 1929 the two men reconciled when they accidentally met in a caf√© in Paris.  Architecture, design, and typography  A reconstruction of the dance hall/cinema designed by Theo van Doesburg: ‚ÄúCin√©bal‚Äù at the Aubette in Strasbourg. Bonset zig-zag Van Doesburg had other activities apart from painting and promoting De Stijl: he made efforts in architecture, designing houses for artists, together with Sophie Taeuber-Arp and Hans Arp he designed the decoration for the Aubette entertainment complex in Strasbourg. Together with El Lissitzky and Kurt Schwitters, Van Doesburg pioneered the efforts to an International of Arts in two congresses held in D√ºsseldorf and Weimar, in 1922. A geometrically constructed alphabet Van Doesburg designed in 1919 has been revived in digital form as Architype Van Doesburg. This typeface anticipates similar later experimentation by Kurt Schwitters in his typeface Architype Schwitters. In the mid 1920s, Van Doesburg worked together with Schwitters and the artist Kate Steinitz to produce a series of children's fairy-tale books that featured unusual typography, including Hahnepeter (Peter the Rooster, 1924), Die M√§rchen vom Paradies (The Fairy Tales of Paradise, 1924‚Äì25), and Die Scheuche (The Scarecrow, 1925). Van Doesburg also kept a link with Dada, publishing the magazine M√©cano under the heteronym of I. K. Bonset (possibly an anagram of \\"Ik ben zot\\", Dutch for \\"I am foolish\\"). He also published Dada poetry under the same name in De Stijl. Under a second pseudonym, Aldo Camini, he published anti-philosophical prose, inspired by the Italian representative of Metaphysical art, Carlo Carr√†. In these works of literature, he heavily opposed individualism (and thus against the movement of the Tachtigers, realism, and psychological thinking). He sought for a collective experience of reality. His conception of intensity had much in common with Paul van Ostaijen's conception of dynamiek. He wanted to strip words of their former meaning, and give them a new meaning and power of expression. By doing this, he tried to evoke a new reality, instead of describing it.  Last years  Van Doesburg stayed active in art groups and the magazine Cercle et Carr√©, which he left in 1929. \\"The plan to produce a magazine had been broached some time before. It is clear from the correspondence that in the spring of 1928 Van Doesburg made the first designs for the layout of the periodical. He wrote to Joaquin Torres-Garcia on May 28 1929 : I will prepare the blueprint fo nouveau plan.\\" Art Concret, which he co-founded in 1929, and Abstraction-Cr√©ation, which he co-founded in 1931. At the end of February 1931 he was forced to move to Davos in Switzerland because of his declining health. Van Doesburg did not recuperate: on 7 March 1931, he died of a heart attack. After his death Nelly van Doesburg released the last issue of De Stijl as a memorial issue with contributions by old and new members from De Stijl.  Influence  Van Doesburg's work has had significant influence, including that dealing with issues of crossover art, design and architecture. For example, his Space-time construction #3 (1923) was a key work in the Miller Company Collection of Abstract Art's Painting toward architecture exhibition (1947‚Äì52, 28 venues).Preece, R. J.

Crowley's Ridge (also Crowleys Ridge) is a geological formation that rises 250 to above the alluvial plain of the Mississippi embayment in a line from southeastern Missouri to the Mississippi River near Helena, Arkansas. It is the most prominent feature in the Mississippi Alluvial Plain between Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and the Gulf of Mexico. This narrow rolling hill region rising above the flat plain is the sixth, and smallest, natural division of the state of Arkansas. It is protected within Ozark‚ÄìSt. Francis National Forest. Most of the major cities of the Arkansas Delta region lie along Crowley's Ridge. It was named after Benjamin Crowley, known as the first American settler to reach the area, sometime around 1820. The Civil War Battle of Chalk Bluff was fought on Crowley's Ridge on May 1‚Äì2, 1863. Composition and origin The ridge is primarily composed of the windblown glacially derived sediment known as loess. It contrasts greatly with the flat table land around it and with the black soil that makes up the delta. The ridge varies from half a mile to wide and reaches an elevation of near its northern extremity. The highest point on the ridge in Arkansas is \\"Legacy Mountain\\" at the Craighead County solid waste site south of Jonesboro. Prevailing winds blow dust into the river fogs. The fog wetted dust tends to fall and make loess deposits on the downwind sides of rivers, such the east and north sides of the Mississippi River, as well as the east side of the Black River.Miller, B.J., G.C. Lewis, J.J. Alford, and W.J. Day, 1985, Loesses in Louisiana and at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Guidebook, Friends of the Pleistocene Field Trip, 12-14 April, 1985. LA Agricultural Experimental Station, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 126 pp. These loess deposits are a classic example of periglacial loess. Crowley's Ridge is a natural loess accumulation point. A comparable example of this type of deposit is the Loess Hills in northwestern Missouri and southwestern Iowa. At one time, the ridge was thought to have been an island between the Mississippi River and Ohio River that was isolated as a long low hilly ridge after the rivers changed course millions of years ago. Recent seismic evidence, however, questions the fluvial origin by focusing on uplift along ridge bounding faults. There is evidence that the area's elevation has increased over the years, suggesting that uplift is still taking place. This alternative explanation posits a link between the ridge and the nearby New Madrid Seismic Zone.Roy B. Van Arsdale, Robert A. Williams, Eugene S. Schweig, Kaye M. Shedlock, Jack K. Odum and Kenneth W.King, \\"The origin of Crowley's Ridge, northeastern Arkansas: Erosional remnant or tectonic uplift?\\" Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America; August 1995; v. 85; no. 4; p. 963-985. Abstract Soils and vegetation The flora and fauna of the ridge seem more closely related to the Tennessee hills to the east than to the Ozark Mountains to the west. This unique habitat has been protected by the establishment of several state and city parks, the St. Francis National Forest, recreational lakes, and in 1997 a national scenic byway, the Crowley's Ridge Parkway.Crowley's Ridge Parkway National Scenic Byway The soils in this area are moderately fertile and sometimes rich. The land is moderately rugged, discouraging row-crop agriculture. These soils are easily eroded. There is some commercial agriculture in the loessal plains area of the ridge. The ridge is surrounded by the fertile lands of the delta region. The vegetation is predominantly oak and hickory forests, similar to vegetation found in the Appalachian Mountains. Examples are the tulip tree (a yellow poplar) and the American beech. Ferns and flowers abound here, including the American bellflower, fire pink, butterfly weed, cardinal flower, blue lobelia, phlox, verbena, wild hydrangea, hibiscus, aster and yellow jasmine. The low-lying areas around the ridge were once much swampier, and the ridge provided a natural and more healthful place for settlers to establish homes. The ridge became a natural north-south communications link for the region, since travel along the ridge was much easier than through the swampy lowlands.Crowley's Ridge Fossils The region adjacent to the ridge is covered with thick deltaic soils, and few fossils are found except in gravel pits. These pits sometimes reveal the teeth of large mastodons, mammoths and horses, which roamed the continent as recently as 10,000 years ago. Crowley's Ridge contains important exposures of fossiliferous Tertiary sediments and contains the only documented Miocene exposures in the state. A silicified conifer stump weighing several tons was unearthed near Wittsburg, and many more were found around Piggott. Mastodon bones were found within the city limits of Helena at the southern end of the ridge. Near Forrest City, in the bed of Crow Creek, a deposit of oyster shells estimated to be nearly 7,000,000 cubic yards in size was discovered. Namesake Grave of Benjamin Crowley in Shiloh Cemetery at Crowley's Ridge State Park south of Paragould, Arkansas. The inscription reads \\"Benjamin Crowley - 1758-1842 - The man for whom Crowley's Ridge is named\\" Crowley's Ridge is named after Benjamin Crowley (1758‚Äì1842), the first American settler of the Ridge near Paragould, Arkansas. Crowley is buried in the Shiloh Cemetery in Greene County, Arkansas, and a monument marks the spot. The cemetery is part of Crowley's Ridge State Park. Next to Crowley's grave, other early settlers of the ridge are buried in unmarked graves. Crowley's Ridge Nature Center The Forrest L. Wood Crowley‚Äôs Ridge Nature Center in Jonesboro, Arkansas features self-guided exhibits about area's topography and natural history and wildlife of Crowley‚Äôs Ridge. Operated by the Arkansas Fish and Game Commission (AGFC) and opened in 2004, the Center includes an exhibit area, discovery room, observation tower, meeting rooms, auditorium, and gift shop. Outside there are trails through trails through wetlands, forest and prairie, and a 1/4 mile universally accessible trail and boardwalk around a pond. The Center offers many activities and nature education programs. It is named after Forrest L. Wood, a former commissioner and supporter of the AGFC.

(\\"Pat\\") Michaels (born February 15, 1950) is an American former agricultural climatologist. Michaels was a senior fellow in environmental studies at the Cato Institute until Spring 2019. Until 2007, he was research professor of environmental sciences at the University of Virginia, where he had worked from 1980. He collaborated with Fred Singer to attack the scientific consensus on ozone depletion from 1991. He joined the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank founded by Charles and David Koch, and receives significant funding from the fossil fuel industry both directly and through front groups., \\"Although the contrarians portray themselves as a minority of truth seekers battling the large ‚Äúclimate establishment,‚Äù some of them have worked directly for the incredibly wealthy fossil fuels industry (including \\"front groups\\" it has set up, like the [Global Climate Coalition]) or well-funded [conservative think-tank]s. Patrick Michaels and Fred Singer are particularly notable in this regard\\", citing , He has described policies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as \\"Obamunism\\". He is a past president of the American Association of State Climatologists. He has written a number of books and papers denying or minimizing climate change, including Sound and Fury: The Science and Politics of Global Warming (1992), The Satanic Gases (2000), and Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians, and the Media (2004).

Michaels,\\" Cato Institute, accessed August 3, 2010; for his self-described skepticism, see Michaels, Patrick. \\"Holes in the Greenhouse Effect?\\", Cato Institute, accessed August 3, 2010. Michaels' viewpoint, as argued in a 2002 article in the journal Climate Research, is that the planet will see \\"a warming range of 1.3‚Äì3.0¬∞C, with a central value of 1.9¬∞C\\" for the 1990 to 2100 period (a value far smaller than the IPCC's average predictions). Education Patrick Michaels obtained an A.B. in biological science in 1971 and an S.M. in biology in 1975 from the University of Chicago, and in 1979 he obtained his Ph.D. in ecological climatology from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. His doctoral thesis was titled Atmospheric anomalies and crop yields in North America. Ozone depletion In 1991 and 1992, Michaels collaborated with Fred Singer in writing articles for the Washington Times rejecting the scientific consensus on ozone depletion. He advanced arguments on the subject as late as 2000. Views on climate change Michaels has said that he does not contest the basic scientific principles behind greenhouse warming and acknowledges that the global mean temperature has increased in recent decades. He is quoted as being skeptical of global warming, and is described by Michael E. Mann as a \\"prominent climate change contrarian.\\" He contends that the changes will be minor, not catastrophic, and may even be beneficial. A 2002 article published in the journal Climate Research by Michaels and three other scholars has predicted \\"a warming range of 1.3‚Äì3.0¬∞C, with a central value of 1.9¬∞C\\" over the 1990 to 2100 period, although he remarked that the \\"temperature range and central values determined in our study may be too great.\\" He made the argument that the climate feedback system involving current warming trends was weaker than generally asserted, coming to a conclusion that set his views apart from that of the IPCC's estimates.\\"Revised 21st century temperature projections\\", Patrick J. Michaels, Paul C. Knappenberger, Oliver W. Frauenfeld and Robert E. Davis, Climate Research, Vol. 23: 1‚Äì9, 2002. In 2009, Michaels authored a Cato report arguing that \\"Congress should pass no legislation restricting emissions of carbon dioxide, repeal current ethanol mandates, and inform the public about how little climate change would be prevented by proposed legislation.\\" In 2018, Michaels asserted on Fox News, \\"probably about half, maybe half of that nine- tenths of the degree [of total warming] might be caused by greenhouse gases.\\" Climate Feedback, a fact-checking website for media coverage on climate change, wrote of Michaels' assertion, \\"no evidence or research is provided to support this claim, which contradicts the published scientific literature.\\" Advocacy =Expert witness for Western Fuels Association= In May 1994 Richard Lindzen, Michaels, and Robert Balling served as expert witnesses on behalf of Western Fuels Association in St. Paul, Minnesota to determine the environmental cost of coal burning by state power plants. Western Fuels Association is a consortium of coal producers that uses collective advocacy to represent industry interests. =World Climate Report, Greening Earth Society, and Western Fuels Association= The World Climate Report, a newsletter edited by Michaels was first published by the Greening Earth Society. The society was a public relations organization associated with the Western Fuels Association (WFA), an association of coal-burning utility companies., Greening Earth Society, website archived from December 1998., Greening Earth Society, website archived from September 2001. It has been called a \\"front group created by the coal industry\\" and an \\"industry front\\". Fred Palmer, a society staffer, is a registered lobbyist for Peabody Energy, a coal company.U.S. Lobby Registration and Disclosure Page WFA founded the group in 1997, according to an archived version of its website, \\"as a vehicle for advocacy on climate change, the environmental impact of CO2, and fossil fuel use.\\", Greening Earth Society website, archived from March 2005. =2003 John Holdren= Office of Science and Technology Policy director, John Holdren, told the U.S. Senate Republican Policy Committee in June 2003, \\"Michaels is another of the handful of U.S. climate-change contrarians ‚Ä¶ He has published little if anything of distinction in the professional literature, being noted rather for his shrill op-ed pieces and indiscriminate denunciations of virtually every finding of mainstream climate science.\\" In 2009 Michaels responded in a Washington Examiner Op-Ed, saying that the IPCC had subverted the peer review process, and adding the IPCC had \\"left out plenty of peer-reviewed science that it found inconveniently disagreeable.\\" =International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group in 2007= Michaels was one of hundreds of US reviewers composing the International Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Working Group in 2007. Although the Greening Earth Society was generally skeptical of the impact of climate change, it acknowledged some degree of global warming as real: \\"Fact #1. The rate of global warming during the past several decades has been about 0.18¬∞C per decade\\". Note that the actual increase in the global surface temperature during the 100 years ending in 2005 was 0.74 ¬± 0.18 ¬∞C. Climate scientist Tom Wigley, a lead author of parts of the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has stated that \\"Michaels' statements on the subject of computer models are a catalog of misrepresentation and misinterpretation ‚Ä¶ Many of the supposedly factual statements made in Michaels' testimony are either inaccurate or are seriously misleading.\\" Funding from energy or fossil fuel companies In 2006, a Colorado energy cooperative, the Intermountain Rural Electric Association, had given Michaels $100,000. An Associated Press report said that the donations had been made after Michaels had \\"told Western business leaders ... that he was running out of money for his analyses of other scientists' global warming research\\" and noted that the cooperative had a vested interest in opposing mandatory carbon dioxide caps, a situation that raised conflict of interest concerns. Michaels said on CNN that 40 percent of his funding came from the oil industry. According to Fred Pearce, fossil fuel companies have helped fund Michaels' projects, including his World Climate Report, published every year since 1994, and his \\"advocacy science consulting firm\\", New Hope Environmental Services. p. X. A 2005 article published by the Seattle Times reported that Michaels had received more than $165,000 in fuel-industry funding, including money from the coal industry to publish his own climate journal. Selected publications Michaels is the author of several books including: Sound and Fury: The Science and Politics of Global Warming (1992), Satanic Gases (2002; as coauthor), Meltdown: The Predictable Distortion of Global Warming by Scientists, Politicians and the Media (2004), published by the Cato Institute, and Shattered Consensus: The True State of Global Warming (2005; as editor and coauthor). His writing has been published in major scientific journals, including Climate Research, Climatic Change, Geophysical Research Letters, Journal of Climate, Nature, and Science, as well as in popular serials such as the Washington Post, Washington Times, Los Angeles Times, USA Today, Houston Chronicle, and Journal of Commerce.

Under various articles of the Indian Constitution, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. India has made progress in increasing the attainment rate of primary education. In 2011, Approximately 75% of the population, aged between 7 and 10 years, was literate. India's improved education system is often cited as one of the main contributors to its economic development.India achieves 27% decline in poverty, Press Trust of India via Sify.com, 12 September 2008 Much of the progress, especially in higher education and scientific research, has been credited to various public institutions. While enrollment in higher education has increased steadily over the past decade, reaching a gross enrollment ratio of 24% in 2013, there still remains a significant distance to catch up with tertiary education enrolment levels of developed nations, a challenge that will be necessary to overcome in order to continue to reap a demographic dividend from India's comparatively young population. At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group. Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market. As per the Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2012, 96.5% of all rural children between the ages of 6-14 were enrolled in school. This is the fourth annual survey to report enrollment above 96%. India has maintained an average enrolment ratio of 95% for students in this age group from year 2007 to 2014. As an outcome the number of students in the age group 6-14 who are not enrolled in school has come down to 2.8% in the year academic year 2018 (ASER 2018). Another report from 2013 stated that there were 229 million students enrolled in different accredited urban and rural schools of India, from Class I to XII, representing an increase of 2.3 million students over 2002 total enrolment, and a 19% increase in girl's enrolment.Enrollment in schools rises 14% to 23 crore The Times of India (22 January 2013) While quantitatively India is inching closer to universal education, the quality of its education has been questioned particularly in its government run school system. While more than 95 percent of children attend primary school, just 40 percent of Indian adolescents attend secondary school (Grades 9-12). Since 2000, the World Bank has committed over $2 billion to education in India. Some of the reasons for the poor quality include absence of around 25% of teachers every day.Sharath Jeevan & James Townsend, Teachers: A Solution to Education Reform in India Stanford Social Innovation Review (17 July 2013) States of India have introduced tests and education assessment system to identify and improve such schools.B.P. Khandelwal, Examinations and test systems at school level in India UNESCO, pages 100-114 Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all other aspects of operation. Hence, the differentiation of government schools and private schools can be misleading. In January 2019, India had over 900 universities and 40,000 colleges.HRD to increase nearly 25 pc seats in varsities to implement 10 pc quota for poor in gen category, Economic Times, 16 January 2019. In India's higher education system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the historically disadvantaged Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes. In universities, colleges, and similar institutions affiliated to the federal government, there is a maximum 50% of reservations applicable to these disadvantaged groups, at the state level it can vary. Maharashtra had 73% reservation in 2014, which is the highest percentage of reservations in India. History The remnants of the library of Nalanda, built in the 5th century BCE by Gupta kings. It was rebuilt twice after invasion, first after an invasion from the Huns in the 5th century BCE and then after an invasion from the Gaudas in the 7th century CE but abandoned after the third invasion by Turkic invaders in the 12th century. Takshasila (in modern-day Pakistan) was the earliest recorded centre of higher learning in India from possibly 8th century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were taught in Ariano -P√°li language. Secular institutions cropped up along Buddhist monasteries. These institutions imparted practical education, e.g. medicine. A number of urban learning centres became increasingly visible from the period between 500 BCE to 400 CE. The important urban centres of learning were Nalanda (in modern-day Bihar) and Manassa in Nagpur, among others. These institutions systematically imparted knowledge and attracted a number of foreign students to study topics such as Buddhist P√°li literature, logic, p√°li grammar, etc. Chanakya, a Brahmin teacher, was among the most famous teachers, associated with founding of Mauryan Empire. Sammanas and Brahmin gurus historically offered education by means of donations, rather than charging fees or the procurement of funds from students or their guardians. Later, stupas, temples also became centres of education; religious education was compulsory, but secular subjects were also taught. Students were required to be brahmacaris or celibates. The knowledge in these orders was often related to the tasks a section of the society had to perform. The priest class, the Sammanas, were imparted knowledge of religion, philosophy, and other ancillary branches while the warrior class, the Kshatriya, were trained in the various aspects of warfare. The business class, the Vaishya, were taught their trade and the working class of the Shudras was generally deprived of educational advantages.  School education  School uniform at a school in Delhi NCR The central board and most of the state boards uniformly follow the \\"10+2\\" pattern of education. In this pattern, study of 10 years is done in schools and 2 years in Junior colleges (Mumbai, Maharashtra), and then 3 years of study for a bachelor's degree for college. The first 10 years is further subdivided into 4 years of primary education, 6 years of High School followed by 2 years of Junior colleges. This pattern originated from the recommendation of the Education Commission of 1964‚Äì66.  Indian new education policy 2020 (NEP-20)  Indian education is suggested to change by Education Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal and MHRD, according to the new education policy (NEP-20). It will be in the format of 5+3+3+4. ;1. Pre-primary schooling (5+): It divides the foundational stage into two parts (age of 3-8), 3 years of preschool (Anganwadi) and two years of primary classes 1‚Äì2. Now students can start their education at age of 3. ;2. Primary schooling (3+): After primary education, students will enter primary education in the age group of 8‚Äì11 years, where they will study in classes 3‚Äì5. Teachers will put more emphasis on the students; health, analytical skills, mathematical approach, reasoning, logical thinking and creative thinking. Classes will be more engaging and pedantic than book-based learning. ;3. Secondary schooling (3+): From class 6th (age of 11‚Äì14 years) onward additional vocational programs will be added. There will provide deeper and particle knowledge in subjects like sciences, mathematics, arts, social sciences, and humanities, etc. ;4. Senior secondary schooling (4): After completing class 8th, the students will join senior secondary school between 14‚Äì18 years. This phase comprises two stages: in the first stage, students will study in classes, 9-10 and 11‚Äì12 in the second stage. =Administration= Policy School children of Nuchhungi English Medium School Hnahthial Education policy is prepared by the Centre Government and State Governments at national and state levels respectively. The National Policy on Education (NPE), 1986, has provided for environment awareness, science and technology education, and introduction of traditional elements such as Yoga into the Indian secondary school system.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 231 A significant feature of India's secondary school system is the emphasis on inclusion of the disadvantaged sections of the society. Professionals from established institutes are often called to support in vocational training. Another feature of India's secondary school system is its emphasis on profession based vocational training to help students attain skills for finding a vocation of his/her choosing.Blackwell, 94‚Äì95 A significant new feature has been the extension of SSA to secondary education in the form of the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan.Microsoft Word ‚Äì Framework_Final_RMSA.doc. (PDF). Retrieved on 21 March 2011. Curriculum and school education boards Students of Nuchhungi English Medium School, Hnahthial in Mizoram School boards set the curriculum, conduct board level exams mostly at 10th and 12th level to award the school diplomas. Exams at the remaining levels (also called standard, grade or class, denoting the years of schooling) are conducted by the schools. * National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT): The NCERT is the apex body located at New Delhi, Capital City of India. It makes the curriculum related matters for school education across India.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 233 The NCERT provides support, guidance and technical assistance to a number of schools in India and oversees many aspects of enforcement of education policies.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 230‚Äì234 There are other curriculum bodies governing school education system specially at state level. * State government boards of education: Most of the state governments have at least one \\"State board of secondary school education\\". However, some states like Andhra Pradesh have more than one. Also the union territories do not have a board. Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, and Lakshadweep and Puducherry Lakshadweep share the services with a larger state. The boards set curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and the curriculum varies from state to state and has more local appeal with examinations conducted in regional languages in addition to English - often considered less rigorous than central curriculums such as CBSE or ICSE/ISC. Most of these conduct exams at 10th and 12th level, but some even at the 5th, 6th and 8th level. * Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE): The CBSE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts examinations at the 10th and 12th standards that are called board exams. Students studying the CBSE Curriculum take the All India Secondary School Examination (AISSE) at the end of grade 10 and All India Senior School Certificate Examination (AISSCE) at the end of grade 12. Examinations are offered in Hindi and English. * Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE): CISCE sets curriculum from Grades 1 to 12 and conducts three examinations, namely, the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE - Class/Grade 10); The Indian School Certificate (ISC - Class/Grade 12) and the Certificate in Vocational Education (CVE - Class/Grade 12). CISCE English level has been compared to UK's A-Levels; this board offers more choices of subjects. CBSE exams at grade 10 and 12 have often been compared with ICSE and ISC examinations. ICSE is generally considered to be more rigorous than the CBSE AISSE (grade 10) but the CBSE AISSCE and ISC examinations are almost on par with each other in most subjects with ISC including a slightly more rigorous English examination than the CBSE 12th grade examination. The CBSE and ISC are recognised internationally and most universities abroad accept the final results of CBSE and ISC exams for admissions purposes and as proof of completion of secondary school. *National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS): The NIOS conducts two examinations, namely, Secondary Examination and Senior Secondary Examination (All India) and also some courses in Vocational Education. National Board of education is run by Government of India's HRD Ministry to provide education in rural areas and challenged groups in open and distance education mode. A pilot project started by CBSE to provide high class affordable education, provides education up to 12th standard. Choice of subjects is highly customisable and equivalent to CBSE. Home-schooled students usually take NIOS or international curriculum examinations as they are ineligible to write CBSE or ISC exams. * Islamic madrasah: Their boards are controlled by local state governments, or autonomous, or affiliated with Darul Uloom Deoband or Darul Uloom Nadwtul Ulama. * Autonomous schools: Such as Woodstock School, Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education Puducherry, Patha Bhavan and Ananda Marga Gurukula. * International Baccalaureate (IB) and Cambridge International Examinations (CIB): These are generally private schools that have dual affiliation with one of the school education board of India as well as affiliated to the International Baccalaureate (IB) Programme and/or the Cambridge International Examinations (CIB). * International schools, which offer 10th and 12th standard examinations under the International Baccalaureate, Cambridge Senior Secondary Examination systems or under their home nations school boards (such as run by foreign embassies or the expat communities). * Special education: A special Integrated Education for Disabled Children (IEDC) programme was started in 1974 with a focus on primary education. but which was converted into Inclusive Education at Secondary StageSecondary Education.

Midday Meal Scheme The Midday Meal Scheme is a school meal programme of the Government of India designed to improve the nutritional status of school-age children nationwide, by supplying free lunches on working days for children in primary and upper primary classes in government, government aided, local body, Education Guarantee Scheme, and alternative innovative education centres, Madarsa and Maqtabs supported under Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, and National Child Labour Project schools run by the ministry of labour. Serving 120,000,000 children in over 1,265,000 schools and Education Guarantee Scheme centres, it is the largest such programme in the world. Teachers education In addition, NUEPA (National University of Educational Planning and Administration) and NCTE (National Council for Teacher Education) are responsible for the management of the education system and teacher accreditation. =Levels of schooling= Pre-primary education Indian Pre-Primary School children (Divine Orchids International Preschool, Jawhar) Anganwadi centre at Velhe, Pune district, 2019 The pre-primary stage is the foundation of children's knowledge, skills and behaviour. On completion of pre-primary education, the children are sent to the primary stage but pre- primary education in India is not a fundamental right. In rural India, pre- primary schools are rarely available in small villages. But in cities and big towns, there are many established players in the pre-primary education sector. The demand for the preschools is growing considerably in the smaller towns and cities but still, only 1% of the population under age 6 is enrolled in preschool education. * Play group (pre-nursery): At playschools, children are exposed to a lot of basic learning activities that help them to get independent faster and develop their self-help qualities like eating food themselves, dressing up, and maintaining cleanliness. The age limit for admission into pre-nursery is 2 to 3 years. Anganwadi is government-funded free rural childcare & Mothercare nutrition and learning program also incorporating the free Midday Meal Scheme. * Nursery: Nursery level activities help children unfold their talents, thus enabling them to sharpen their mental and physical abilities. The age limit for admission in nursery is 3 to 4 years. * LKG: It is also called the junior kindergarten (Jr. kg) stage. The age limit for admission in LKG is 4 to 5 years. * UKG: It is also called the senior kindergarten (Sr. kg) stage. The age limit for admission in UKG is 5 to 6 years. LKG and UKG stages prepare and help children emotionally, mentally, socially and physically to grasp knowledge easily in the later stages of school and college life. Times of India A systematic process of preschool education is followed in India to impart knowledge in the best possible way for a better understanding of the young children. By following an easy and interesting curriculum, teachers strive hard to make the entire learning process enjoyable for the children. Primary education School children reading books in government primary school library, in Goa The primary education in India is divided into two parts, namely Lower Primary (Class I-IV) and Upper Primary (Middle school, Class V-VIII). The Indian government lays emphasis on primary education (Class I-VIII) also referred to as elementary education, to children aged 6 to 14 years old.Blackwell, 93‚Äì94 Because education laws are given by the states, duration of primary school visit alters between the Indian states. The Indian government has also banned child labour in order to ensure that the children do not enter unsafe working conditions. However, both free education and the ban on child labour are difficult to enforce due to economic disparity and social conditions. 80% of all recognised schools at the elementary stage are government run or supported, making it the largest provider of education in the country. However, due to a shortage of resources and lack of political will, this system suffers from massive gaps including high pupil to teacher ratios, shortage of infrastructure and poor levels of teacher training. Figures released by the Indian government in 2011 show that there were 5,816,673 elementary school teachers in India. there were 2,127,000 secondary school teachers in India. Education has also been made free for children for 6 to 14 years of age or up to class VIII under the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act 2009. There have been several efforts to enhance quality made by the government. The District Education Revitalisation Programme (DERP) was launched in 1994 with an aim to universalise primary education in India by reforming and vitalising the existing primary education system.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 215 85% of the DERP was funded by the central government and the remaining 15% was funded by the states. The DERP, which had opened 160,000 new schools including 84,000 alternative education schools delivering alternative education to approximately 3.5 million children, was also supported by UNICEF and other international programmes. In January 2016, Kerala became the 1st Indian state to achieve 100% primary education through its literacy programme Athulyam. This primary education scheme has also not shown a high gross enrollment ratio of 93‚Äì95% for the last three years in some states. Significant improvement in staffing and enrolment of girls has also been made as a part of this scheme. The current scheme for universalisation of Education for All is the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan which is one of the largest education initiatives in the world. Enrollment has been enhanced, but the levels of quality remain low. Secondary education Secondary school girls in Delhi. School children in Hnahthial. Secondary education covers children aged 14 to 18, a group comprising 88.5 million children according to the 2001 Census of India. The final two years of secondary is often called Higher Secondary (HS), Senior Secondary, or simply the \\"+2\\" stage. The two-halves of secondary education are each an important stage for which a pass certificate is needed, and thus are affiliated by central boards of education under HRD ministry, before one can pursue higher education, including college or professional courses. UGC, NCERT, CBSE and ICSE directives state qualifying ages for candidates who wish to take board exams. Those at least 15 years old by 30 May for a given academic year are eligible to appear for Secondary board exams, and those 17 by the same date are eligible to appear for Higher Secondary certificate board exams. It further states that upon successful completion of Higher Secondary, one can apply to higher education under UGC control such as Engineering, Medical, and Business administration. Secondary education in India is examination-oriented and not course-based: students register for and take classes primarily to prepare for one of the centrally-administered examinations. Senior school or high school is split into 2 parts (grades 9-10 and grades 11-12) with a standardised nationwide examination at the end of grade 10 and grade 12 (usually informally referred to as \\"board exams\\"). Grade 10 examination results can be used for admission into grades 11‚Äì12 at a secondary school, pre-university program, or a vocational or technical school. Passing a grade 12 board examination leads to the granting of a secondary school completion diploma, which may be used for admission into vocational schools or universities in the country or the world. Most reputable universities in India require students to pass college-administered admissions tests in addition to passing a final secondary school examination for entry into a college or university. School grades are usually not sufficient for college admissions in India. Most schools in India do not offer subject and scheduling flexibility due to budgeting constraints (for e.g.: most students in India are not allowed to take Chemistry and History in grades 11-12 because they are part of different \\"streams\\"). Private candidates (i.e. not studying in a school) are generally not allowed to register for and take board examinations but there are some exceptions such as NIOS. = 10th (matriculation or secondary) exam = Students taking the grade 10 examination usually take six subjects: English, mathematics, social studies, science, one language, and one optional subject depending on the availability of teachers. Elective or optional subjects often include computer applications, economics, physical education, commerce, and environmental science. = 12th (senior secondary or higher secondary) exam = grade 12 students in Noida Students taking the grade 12 examination usually take four or five subjects with English or the local language being compulsory. Students re-enrolling in most secondary schools after grade 10 have to make the choice of choosing a \\"core stream\\" in addition to English or the local language: science (mathematics/biology, chemistry, and physics), commerce (accounts, business studies, and economics), or humanities (any three of history, political science, sociology, psychology, geography depending on school). Students study mathematics up to single-variable calculus in grade 12. =Types of schools= Government schools The majority of students study in government schools where poor and vulnerable students study for free until the age of 14. An Education Ministry data, 65.2% (113 million,) of all school students in 20 states go to government schools (c. 2017).In 5 years, private schools gain 17 million students, government schools lose 13 million, Hindustan Times, 17 April 2017. These include schools runs by the state and local government as well as the centre government. Example of large centre government run school systems are Kendriya Vidyalaya in urban areas, Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya, for the gifted students, Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya for girls belonging to vulnerable SC/ST/OBC classes, Indian Army Public Schools run by the Indian Army for the children of soldiers. Kendriya Vidyalaya project, was started for the employees of the central government of India, who are deployed throughout the country. The government started the Kendriya Vidyalaya project in 1965 to provide uniform education in institutions following the same syllabus at the same pace regardless of the location to which the employee's family has been transferred. Government aided private schools These are usually charitable trust run schools that receive partial funding from the government. Largest system of aided schools is run by D.A.V. College Managing Committee. Private schools (unaided) thumbthumb According to current estimate, 29% of Indian children are privately educated. With more than 50% children enrolling in private schools in urban areas, the balance has already tilted towards private schooling in cities; and, even in rural areas, nearly 20% of the children in 2004-5 were enrolled in private schools.Desai, Sonalde, Amaresh Dubey, Reeve Vanneman and Rukmini Banerji. 2009. \\"Private Schooling in India: A New Landscape,\\" India Policy Forum Vol. 5. Pp. 1-58, Bery, Suman, Barry Bosworth and Arvind Panagariya (Editors). New Delhi: Sage thumb thumb Most middle-class families send their children to private schools, which might be in their own city or at distant boarding schools. Private schools have been established since the British Rule in India and St George's School, Chennai is the oldest private school in India. At such schools, the medium of education is often English, but Hindi and/or the state's official language is also taught as a compulsory subject. Pre-school education is mostly limited to organised neighbourhood nursery schools with some organised chains. Montessori education is also popular, due to Maria Montessori's stay in India during World War II. In 2014, four of the top ten pre-schools in Chennai were Montessori. Many privately owned and managed schools carry the appellation \\"Public\\", such as the Delhi Public Schools, or Frank Anthony Public Schools. These are modelled after British public schools, which are a group of older, expensive and exclusive fee-paying private independent schools in England. According to some research, private schools often provide superior results at a multiple of the unit cost of government schools. The reason being high aims and better vision. However, others have suggested that private schools fail to provide education to the poorest families, a selective being only a fifth of the schools and have in the past ignored Court orders for their regulation. In their favour, it has been pointed out that private schools cover the entire curriculum and offer extra-curricular activities such as science fairs, general knowledge, sports, music and drama. The pupil teacher ratios are much better in private schools (1:31 to 1:37 for government schools) and more teachers in private schools are female. There is some disagreement over which system has better educated teachers. According to the latest DISE survey, the percentage of untrained teachers (para-teachers) is 54.91% in private, compared to 44.88% in government schools and only 2.32% teachers in unaided schools receive in- service training compared to 43.44% for government schools. The competition in the school market is intense, yet most schools make profit. However, the number of private schools in India is still low - the share of private institutions is 7% (with upper primary being 21% secondary 32% - source: fortress team research). Even the poorest often go to private schools despite the fact that government schools are free. A study found that 65% school- children in Hyderabad's slums attend private schools. National schools Baranagore Ramakrishna Mission Ashrama High School Atomic Energy Central School (established in 1969), Bal Bharati Public School (established in 1944), Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan (established in 1938), Chinmaya Vidyalaya (established in 1965), DAV Public School (established in 1886), Delhi Public School (established in 1949), Indian Army Public Schools (established in 1983), Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya (established in 1986), Kendriya Vidyalaya (established in 1963), Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan (established in 1958), Railway Schools in India (established in 1873), Ramakrishna Mission Schools (established in 1922), Ryan International Schools (established in 1976), Sainik School (established in 1960), Saraswati Shishu Mandir (established in 1952), Seth M.R. Jaipuria Schools (established in 1992), Vivekananda Vidyalaya (established in 1972), Vivekananda Kendra Vidyalaya (established in 1977), Waldorf Schools (India) (established in 2002), these schools are considered as National schools in India. International schools , the International Schools Consultancy (ISC) listed India as having 410 international schools. ISC defines an 'international school' in the following terms \\"ISC includes an international school if the school delivers a curriculum to any combination of pre-school, primary or secondary students, wholly or partly in English outside an English-speaking country, or if a school in a country where English is one of the official languages, offers an English-medium curriculum other than the country's national curriculum and is international in its orientation.\\" This definition is used by publications including The Economist. Home- schooling Home-schooling in India is legal, though it is the less explored option, and often debated by educators. The Indian Government's stance on the issue is that parents are free to teach their children at home, if they wish to and have the means. The then HRD Minister Kapil Sibal has stated that despite the RTE Act of 2009, if someone decides not to send his/her children to school, the government would not interfere. Higher education University of Calcutta, established on 1857, was the first multidisciplinary and secular Western-style institution in Asia. Students may opt for vocational education or university education. =Vocational education= India's All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE) reported, in 2013, that there are more than 4,599 vocational institutions that offer degrees, diploma and post-diploma in architecture, engineering, hotel management, infrastructure, pharmacy, technology, town services and others. There were 1740,000 students enrolled in these schools.Growth of Technical Institutes in the Country AICTE, Govt of India Total annual intake capacity for technical diplomas and degrees exceeded 3.4 million in 2012. According to the University Grants Commission (UGC) total enrolment in Science, Medicine, Agriculture and Engineering crossed 65 lakh in 2010. The number of women choosing engineering has more than doubled since 2001. =Tertiary education= Indian Institute of Management Calcutta, Kolkata. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay Forest Research Institute220x220pxthumb After passing the Higher Secondary Examination (the Standard 12 examination), students may enroll in general degree programmes such as bachelor's degree (graduation) in arts, commerce or science, or professional degree programme such as engineering, medicine, pharmacy, and law graduates. India's higher education system is the third largest in the world, after China and the United States. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission (India) (UGC), which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps co-ordinate between the centre and the state up to Post graduation and Doctorate (PhD).India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 237 Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 12 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission. thumb , India has 152 central universities, 316 state universities, and 191 private universities. Other institutions include 33,623 colleges, including 1,800 exclusive women's colleges, functioning under these universities and institutions, and 12,748 Institutions offering Diploma Courses. The emphasis in the tertiary level of education lies on science and technology.Blackwell, 95‚Äì96 Indian educational institutions by 2004 consisted of a large number of technology institutes. Distance learning is also a feature of the Indian higher education system.Blackwell, 96 The Government has launched Rashtriya Uchchattar Shiksha Abhiyan to provide strategic funding to State higher and technical institutions. A total of 316 state public universities and 13,024 colleges will be covered under it. Some institutions of India, such as the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) have been globally acclaimed for their standard of under-graduate education in engineering. Several other institutes of fundamental research such as the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Harish-Chandra Research Institute (HRI), Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) are also acclaimed for their standard of research in basic sciences and mathematics. However, India has failed to produce world class universities both in the private sector or the public sector.India doesn't figure in world top-100 universities, Press Trust of India via timesofindia.com, 12 September 2010 Besides top rated universities which provide highly competitive world class education to their pupils, India is also home to many universities which have been founded with the sole objective of making easy money. Regulatory authorities like UGC and AICTE have been trying very hard to extirpate the menace of private universities which are running courses without any affiliation or recognition. Indian Government has failed to check on these education shops, which are run by big businessmen & politicians. Many private colleges and universities do not fulfil the required criterion by the Government and central bodies (UGC, AICTE, MCI, BCI etc.) and take students for a ride. For example, many institutions in India continue to run unaccredited courses as there is no legislation strong enough to ensure legal action against them. Quality assurance mechanisms have failed to stop misrepresentations and malpractices in higher education. At the same time regulatory bodies have been accused of corruption, specifically in the case of deemed-universities. In this context of lack of solid quality assurance mechanism, institutions need to step-up and set higher standards of self- regulation. Gujarat National Law University, Gandhinagar The Government of India is aware of the plight of higher education sector and has been trying to bring reforms, however, 15 bills are still awaiting discussion and approval in the Parliament. One of the most talked about bill is Foreign Universities Bill, which is supposed to facilitate entry of foreign universities to establish campuses in India. The bill is still under discussion and even if it gets passed, its feasibility and effectiveness is questionable as it misses the context, diversity and segment of international foreign institutions interested in India. One of the approaches to make internationalisation of Indian higher education effective is to develop a coherent and comprehensive policy which aims at infusing excellence, bringing institutional diversity and aids in capacity building. Three Indian universities were listed in the Times Higher Education list of the world's top 200 universities ‚Äì Indian Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Management, and Jawaharlal Nehru University in 2005 and 2006. Six Indian Institutes of Technology and the Birla Institute of Technology and Science‚ÄîPilani were listed among the top 20 science and technology schools in Asia by Asiaweek. The Indian School of Business situated in Hyderabad was ranked number 12 in global MBA rankings by the Financial Times of London in 2010 while the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has been recognised as a global leader in medical research and treatment. The University of Mumbai was ranked 41 among the Top 50 Engineering Schools of the world by America's news broadcasting firm Business Insider in 2012 and was the only university in the list from the five emerging BRICS nations viz Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. It was ranked at 62 in the QS BRICS University rankings for 2013 and was India's 3rd best Multi- Disciplinary University in the QS University ranking of Indian Universities after University of Calcutta and Delhi University. In April 2015, IIT Bombay launched the first U.S.-India joint EMBA program alongside Washington University in St. Louis. =Technical education= Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur220x220pxthumb National Institute of Technology, Tiruchirappalli From the first Five-year Plan onwards, India's emphasis was to develop a pool of scientifically inclined manpower.\\"Infrastructure: S&T; Education\\", Science and Technology in India, 30 India's National Policy on Education (NPE) provisioned for an apex body for regulation and development of higher technical education, which came into being as the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in 1987 through an act of the Indian parliament.\\"Infrastructure: S&T; Education\\", Science and Technology in India, 31 At the federal level, the Indian Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology, the National Institutes of Technology and the Indian Institutes of Information Technology are deemed of national importance. The Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are among the nation's premier education facilities.Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee220x220pxthumb The UGC has inter-university centres at a number of locations throughout India to promote common research, e.g. the Nuclear Science Centre at the Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.\\"Infrastructure: S&T; Education\\", Science and Technology in India, 32 Besides there are some British established colleges such as Harcourt Butler Technological Institute situated in Kanpur and King George Medical University situated in Lucknow which are important centre of higher education. In addition to above institutes, efforts towards the enhancement of technical education are supplemented by a number of recognised Professional Engineering Societies such as: # Institution of Engineers (India) # Institution of Civil Engineers (India) # Institution of Mechanical Engineers (India) # Institution of Chemical Engineering (India) # Institution of Electronics and Tele-Communication Engineers (India) # Indian Institute of Metals # Institution of Industrial Engineers (India) # Institute of Town Planners (India) # Indian Institute of Architects that conduct Engineering/Technical Examinations at different levels (Degree and diploma) for working professionals desirous of improving their technical qualifications. The number of graduates coming out of technical colleges increased to over 700,000 in 2011 from 550,000 in FY 2010. However, according to one study, 75% of technical graduates and more than 85% of general graduates lack the skills needed in India's most demanding and high-growth global industries such as Information Technology. These high-tech global information technologies companies directly or indirectly employ about 2.3 million people, less than 1% of India's labour pool.Information Technology AICTE (2012) India offers one of the largest pool of technically skilled graduates in the world. Given the sheer numbers of students seeking education in engineering, science and mathematics, India faces daunting challenges in scaling up capacity while maintaining quality. Open and distance learning At the school level, National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) provides opportunities for continuing education to those who missed completing school education. 1.4 million students are enrolled at the secondary and higher secondary level through open and distance learning. In 2012 various state governments also introduced \\"State Open School\\" to provide distance education. At higher education level, Indira Gandhi National Open University (IGNOU) co- ordinates distance learning. It has a cumulative enrolment of about 1.5 million, serviced through 53 regional centres and 1,400 study centres with 25,000 counselors. The Distance Education Council (DEC), an authority of IGNOU is co-co-ordinating 13 State Open Universities and 119 institutions of correspondence courses in conventional universities. While distance education institutions have expanded at a very rapid rate, but most of these institutions need an up gradation in their standards and performance. There is a large proliferation of courses covered by distance mode without adequate infrastructure, both human and physical. There is a strong need to correct these imbalances. Massive open online course are made available for free by the HRD ministry and various educational institutes. Quality =Literacy= According to the Census of 2011, \\"every person above the age of 7 years who can read and write with understanding in any language is said to be literate\\". According to this criterion, the 2011 survey holds the national literacy rate to be 74.04%. The youth literacy rate, measured within the age group of 15 to 24, is 81.1% (84.4% among males and 74.4% among females), while 86% of boys and 72% of girls are literate in the 10-19 age group. Within the Indian states, Kerala has the highest literacy rate of 93.91% whereas Bihar averaged 61.8% literacy. The 2001 statistics indicated that the total number of 'absolute non-literates' in the country was 304 million. Gender gap in literacy rate is high, for example in Rajasthan, the state with the lowest female literacy rate in India, average female literacy rate is 52.66% and average male literacy rate is 80.51%, making a gender gap of 27.85%. =Attainment= , enrolment rates are 58% for pre-primary, 93% for primary, 69% for secondary, and 25% for tertiary education. Despite the high overall enrolment rate for primary education among rural children of age 10, half could not read at a basic level, over 60% were unable to do division, and half dropped out by the age of 14. In 2009, two states in India, Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh, participated in the international PISA exams which is administered once every three years to 15-year-old's. Both states ranked at the bottom of the table, beating out only Kyrgyzstan in score, and falling 200 points (two standard deviations) below the average for OECD countries. While in the immediate aftermath there was a short-lived controversy over the quality of primary education in India, ultimately India decided to not participate in PISA for 2012, and again not to for 2015. While the quality of free, public education is in crisis, a majority of the urban poor have turned to private schools. In some urban cities, it is estimated as high as two- thirds of all students attend private institutions, many of which charge a modest US$2 per month. =Public school workforce= Officially, the pupil to teacher ratio within the public school system for primary education is 35:1. However, teacher absenteeism in India is exorbitant, with 25% never showing up for work. The World Bank estimates the cost in salaries alone paid to such teachers who have never attended work is US$2 billion per year. Indian School- Children A study on teachers by Kremer etc. found out that 25% of private sector teachers and 40% of public sector medical workers were absent during the survey. Among teachers who were paid to teach, absence rates ranged from 14.6% in Maharashtra to 41.9% in Jharkhand. Only 1 in nearly 3,000 public school head teachers had ever dismissed a teacher for repeated absence. The same study found \\"only about half were teaching, during unannounced visits to a nationally representative sample of government primary schools in India.\\" =Higher education= As per Report of the Higher education in India, Issues Related to Expansion, Inclusiveness, Quality and Finance, the access to higher education measured in term of gross enrolment ratio increased from 0.7% in 1950/51 to 1.4% in 1960‚Äì61. By 2006/7 the GER increased to about 11%. Notably, by 2012, it had crossed 20% (as mentioned in an earlier section). According to a survey by All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) released by the ministry of human resource development, Tamil Nadu which has the highest gross enrollment ratio (GER) in higher education in the country has registered an increase of 2.6% to take GER to 46.9 per cent in 2016‚Äì17. =Vocational education= An optimistic estimate from 2008 was that only one in five job- seekers in India ever had any sort of vocational training. However it's expected to grow as the CBSE has brought changes in its education system which emphasises inclusion of certain number and types of vocational subjects in classes 9th and 11th. Although it's not mandatory for schools to go for it but a good number of schools have voluntarily accepted the suggestion and incorporated the change in their curriculum. =Extracurricular activities= Extracurricular activities include sports, arts, National Service Scheme, National Cadet Corps, The Bharat Scouts and Guides, etc. Issues =Facilities= As per 2016 Annual Survey of Education Report (ASER), 3.5% schools in India had no toilet facility while only 68.7% schools had usable toilet facility. 75.5% of the schools surveyed had library in 2016, a decrease from 78.1% in 2014. Percentage of schools with separate girls toilet have increased from 32.9% in 2010 to 61.9%in 2016. 74.1% schools had drinking water facility and 64.5% of the schools had playground. =Curriculum issues= Modern education in India is often criticised for being based on rote learning rather than problem solving. New Indian Express says that Indian Education system seems to be producing zombies since in most of the schools students seemed to be spending majority of their time in preparing for competitive exams rather than learning or playing. BusinessWeek criticises the Indian curriculum, saying it revolves around rote learning and ExpressIndia suggests that students are focused on cramming. Preschool for Child Rights states that almost 99% of pre-schools do not have any curriculum at all. Also creativity is not encouraged or is considered as a form of entertainment in most institutions. =Rural education= A primary school in a village in Madhya Pradesh Indian school children in Mizoram Following independence, India viewed education as an effective tool for bringing social change through community development.Setty and Ross, 120 The administrative control was effectively initiated in the 1950s, when, in 1952, the government grouped villages under a Community Development Block‚Äîan authority under national programme which could control education in up to 100 villages. A Block Development Officer oversaw a geographical area of which could contain a population of as many as 70,000 people. Setty and Ross elaborate on the role of such programmes, themselves divided further into individual-based, community based, or the Individual-cum- community-based, in which microscopic levels of development are overseen at village level by an appointed worker: Despite some setbacks the rural education programmes continued throughout the 1950s, with support from private institutions.Setty and Ross, 121 A sizeable network of rural education had been established by the time the Gandhigram Rural Institute was established and 5,200 Community Development Blocks were established in India.Setty and Ross, 122 Nursery schools, elementary schools, secondary school, and schools for adult education for women were set up. The government continued to view rural education as an agenda that could be relatively free from bureaucratic backlog and general stagnation. However, in some cases lack of financing balanced the gains made by rural education institutes of India. Some ideas failed to find acceptability among India's poor and investments made by the government sometimes yielded little results.Setty and Ross, 125 Today, government rural schools remain poorly funded and understaffed. Several foundations, such as the Rural Development Foundation (Hyderabad), actively build high-quality rural schools, but the number of students served is small. Education in rural India is valued differently from in an urban setting, with lower rates of completion. An imbalanced sex ratio exists within schools with 18% of males earning a high school diploma compared with only 10% of females. The estimated number of children who have never attended school in India is near 100 million which reflects the low completion levels. This is the largest concentration in the world of youth who haven't enrolled in school. =Women's education= LMS, 1869, p.12) Girls in Kalleda Rural School, Andhra Pradesh. Maharanis College for Women, Mysore, India. Women have a much lower literacy rate than men. Far fewer girls are enrolled in the schools, and many of them drop out. In the patriarchal setting of the Indian family, girls have lower status and fewer privileges than boys.Dube, L. 1988. On the construction of gender: Hindu girls in patrilineal India. In Socialization, education, and women: Explorations in gender identity,ed. K. Chanana, New Delhi: Orient Longman. Conservative cultural attitudes prevent some girls from attending school. Furthermore, educated high class women are less likely than uneducated low class women to enter the workforce They opt to stay at home due to the traditional, cultural and religious norms. The number of literate women among the female population of India was between 2‚Äì6% from the British Raj onwards to the formation of the Republic of India in 1947.Raman, 235 Concerted efforts led to improvement from 15.3% in 1961 to 28.5% in 1981. By 2001 literacy for women had exceeded 50% of the overall female population, though these statistics were still very low compared to world standards and even male literacy within India.Raman, 236 Recently the Indian government has launched Saakshar Bharat Mission for Female Literacy. This mission aims to bring down female illiteracy by half of its present level. Sita Anantha Raman outlines the progress of women's education in India: Sita Anantha Raman also mentions that while the educated Indian women workforce maintains professionalism, the men outnumber them in most fields and, in some cases, receive higher income for the same positions.Raman, 238 The education of women in India plays a significant role in improving livings standards in the country. A higher female literacy rate improves the quality of life both at home and outside the home, by encouraging and promoting education of children, especially female children, and in reducing the infant mortality rate. Several studies have shown that a lower level of women literacy rates results in higher levels of fertility and infant mortality, poorer nutrition, lower earning potential and the lack of an ability to make decisions within a household.. S. Chandrasekhar and A. Jayaraman, District Level Analysis of the Total Fertility Rate Using Indian Census Data (viewed on 9 March 2011), Women's lower educational levels is also shown to adversely affect the health and living conditions of children. A survey that was conducted in India showed results which support the fact that infant mortality rate was inversely related to female literacy rate and educational level.Women Education in India, (viewed on 9 March 2011), http://www.slideshare.net/siddharth4mba/women-education-in-india The survey also suggests a correlation between education and economic growth. In India, there is a large disparity between female literacy rates in different states.Literacy Rate and Gender Gap in Sechduled Castes in India, (viewed on 9 March 2011), State of Kerala has the highest female literacy rate of 91.98% while Rajasthan has the lowest female literacy rate of 52.66. This correlates to the health levels of states, Kerala has average life expectancy at birth of 74.9 while Rajasthan's average life expectancy at birth is 67.7 years. In India, higher education is defined as the education of an age group between 18 and 24, and is largely funded by the government. Despite women making up 24‚Äì50% of higher education enrolment, there is still a gender imbalance within higher education. Only one third of science students and 7% of engineering students, are women. In comparison, however, over half the students studying Education are women.Saraswathi, T.S. & Verma, Suman. Adolescence in India: Street Urchins or Silicon Valley Millionaires? pg. 17 from Brown, B. Bradford, Larson, Reed W, & Saraswathi, T.S., The World's Youth: adolescence in eight regions of the globe. Cambridge University Press, 2002. =Accreditation= In January 2010, the Government of India decided to withdraw Deemed university status from as many as 44 institutions. The Government claimed in its affidavit that academic considerations were not being kept in mind by the management of these institutions and that \\"they were being run as family fiefdoms\\". In February 2009, the University Grant Commission found 39 fake institutions operating in India. =Employer training= Only 10% of manufacturers in India offer in-service training to their employees, compared with over 90% in China. =Teacher careers= Nuchhungi English Medium School Hnahthial Lunglei Mizoram on Teachers' Day In the Indian education system, a teacher's success is loosely defined. It is either based on a student's success or based on the years of teaching experience, both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher's skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, both of which are often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, there is a need to identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development. =Coaching= Old Rajinder Nagar Delhi Increased competition to get admission in reputed colleges has given rise to private coaching institutes in India. They prepare students for engineering, medical, MBA, SAT, GRE, banking jobs' entrance tests. There are also coaching institutes that teach subjects like English for employment in India and abroad. Private coaching institutes are of two types: offline coaching and online coaching. There are many online coaching centres and apps available in the market and their usage is growing, especially in tier 2 metro cities. A 2013 survey by ASSOCHAM predicted the size of private coaching industry to grow to $40 billion, or Rs 2.39 trillion (short scale) by 2015. Kota in Rajasthan is the called the capital of engineering and medical colleges' entrance's coaching sector. In Punjab, English language is taught by coaching institutes for foreign visa aspirants to get the right IELTS score for their applications. Mukherjee Nagar and Old Rajinder Nagar in Delhi are considered the hub for UPSC Civil Services Examination coaching. To compete in these exams, Center and some state governments also provide free coaching to students, especially to students from minority communities. Coaching classes have been blamed for the neglect of school education by students. Educationists such as Anandakrishnan have criticised the increasing importance being given to coaching classes as they put students under mental stress and the coaching fees add to the financial burden on parents. These educationists opine that if a good schooling system is put in place, children should not need additional coaching to take any competitive examination. =Corruption in education= Corruption in Indian education system has been eroding the quality of education and has been creating long-term negative consequences for the society. Educational corruption in India is considered as one of the major contributors to domestic black money.http://ficci.in/spdocument/20548/STUDY- ON-WIDENING-OF-TAX-BASE-AND-TACKLING-BLACK-MONEY.pdf =Grade inflation= Grade inflation has become an issue in Indian secondary education. In CBSE, a 95 percent aggregate is 21 times as prevalent today as it was in 2004, and a 90 percent close to nine times as prevalent. In the ISC Board, a 95 percent is almost twice as prevalent today as it was in 2012. CBSE called a meeting of all 40 school boards early in 2017 to urge them to discontinue \\"artificial spiking of marks\\". CBSE decided to lead by example and promised not to inflate its results. But although the 2017 results have seen a small correction, the board has clearly not discarded the practice completely. Almost 6.5 percent of mathematics examinees in 2017 scored 95 or more ‚Äì 10 times higher than in 2004 ‚Äì and almost 6 percent of physics examinees scored 95 or more, 35 times more than in 2004. Initiatives =Central government involvement= The madrasah of Jamia Masjid mosque in Srirangapatna. Elementary School in Chittoor. This school is part of the 'Paathshaala' project. The school currently educates 70 students. Following India's independence, a number of rules were formulated for the backward Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes of India. In 1960, a list identifying 405 Scheduled Castes and 225 Scheduled Tribes was published by the central government.Elder, 227 An amendment was made to the list in 1975, which identified 841 Scheduled Castes and 510 Scheduled Tribes. The total percentage of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes combined was found to be 22.5% with the Scheduled Castes accounting for 17% and the Scheduled Tribes accounting for the remaining 7.5%. Following the report many Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes increasingly referred to themselves as Dalit, a Marathi language terminology used by B R Ambedkar which literally means \\"oppressed\\". The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are provided for in many of India's educational programmes.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 226‚Äì227 Special reservations are also provided for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in India, e.g. a reservation of 15% in Kendriya Vidyalaya for Scheduled Castes and another reservation of 7.5% in Kendriya Vidyalaya for Scheduled Tribes. Similar reservations are held by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in many schemes and educational facilities in India. The remote and far-flung regions of North-East India are provided for under the Non-Lapsible Central pool of Resources (NLCPR) since 1998‚Äì1999.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 236‚Äì237 The NLCPR aims to provide funds for infrastructure development in these remote areas. Women from remote, underdeveloped areas or from weaker social groups in Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand, fall under the Mahila Samakhya Scheme, initiated in 1989.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 216 Apart from provisions for education this programme also aims to raise awareness by holding meetings and seminars at rural levels. The government allowed during 2007‚Äì08 to carry out this scheme over 83 districts including more than 21,000 villages. Currently there are 68 Bal Bhavans and 10 Bal Kendra affiliated to the National Bal Bhavan.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 218 The scheme involves educational and social activities and recognising children with a marked talent for a particular educational stream. A number of programmes and activities are held under this scheme, which also involves cultural exchanges and participation in several international forums. India's minorities, especially the ones considered 'educationally backward' by the government, are provided for in the 1992 amendment of the Indian National Policy on Education (NPE). The government initiated the Scheme of Area Intensive Programme for Educationally Backward Minorities and Scheme of Financial Assistance or Modernisation of Madarsa Education as part of its revised Programme of Action (1992). Both these schemes were started nationwide by 1994. In 2004 the Indian parliament passed an act which enabled minority education establishments to seek university affiliations if they passed the required norms.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 239 Ministry of Human Resource and Development, Government of India in collaboration with Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology has also launched a National Scholarship Portal to provide students of India access to National and State Level Scholarships provided by various government authorities. As a Mission Mode Project under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), the online service enlists more than 50 scholarship programs every year including the renowned Ministry of Minority Affairs (MOMA) Scholarships for Post-Matric and Pre-Matric studies. In the academic year 2017-18 the MOMA Scholarships facilitated the studies of 116,452 students with scholarships worth ‚Çπ3165.7 million. The National Scholarship continues to enlist scholarship programs managed by AICTE (All India Council for Technical Education), UGC (University Grants Commission) and respective state governments. =Legislative framework= Article 45, of the Constitution of India originally stated: This article was a directive principle of state policy within India, effectively meaning that it was within a set of rules that were meant to be followed in spirit and the government could not be held to court if the actual letter was not followed.Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 149‚Äì50 However, the enforcement of this directive principle became a matter of debate since this principle held obvious emotive and practical value, and was legally the only directive principle within the Indian constitution to have a time limit. Following initiatives by the Supreme Court of India during the 1990s the 93rd amendment bill suggested three separate amendments to the Indian constitution:Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 152‚Äì154 The constitution of India was amended to include a new article, 21A, which read: Article 45 was proposed to be substituted by the article which read: Another article, 51A, was to additionally have the clause: The bill was passed unanimously in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, on 28 November 2001.Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 156 It was later passed by the upper house‚Äîthe Rajya Sabha‚Äîon 14 May 2002. After being signed by the President of India the Indian constitution was amended formally for the eighty sixth time and the bill came into effect. Since then those between the age of 6‚Äì14 have a fundamental right to education.Sripati and Thiruvengadam, 149 Article 46 of the Constitution of India holds that: Other provisions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes can be found in Articles 330, 332, 335, 338‚Äì342.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 225 Both the 5th and the 6th Schedules of the Constitution also make special provisions for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. = Central government expenditure on education = As a part of the tenth Five-year Plan (2002‚Äì2007), the central government of India outlined an expenditure of 65.6% of its total education budget of i.e. on elementary education; 9.9% i.e. on secondary education; 2.9% i.e. on adult education; 9.5% i.e. on higher education; 10.7% i.e. on technical education; and the remaining 1.4% i.e. on miscellaneous education schemes.India 2009: A Reference Annual (53rd edition), 223 During the Financial Year 2011‚Äì12, the Central Government of India has allocated 38,957 crore for the Department of School Education and Literacy which is the main department dealing with primary education in India. Within this allocation, major share of 21,000 crore, is for the flagship programme 'Sarva Siksha Abhiyan'. However, budgetary allocation of 210,000 million is considered very low in view of the officially appointed Anil Bordia Committee recommendation of 356.59 billion for the year 2011‚Äì12. This higher allocation was required to implement the recent legislation 'Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. In recent times, several major announcements were made for developing the poor state of affairs in education sector in India, the most notable ones being the National Common Minimum Programme (NCMP) of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government. The announcements are; (a) To progressively increase expenditure on education to around 6% of GDP. (b) To support this increase in expenditure on education, and to increase the quality of education, there would be an imposition of an education cess over all central government taxes. (c) To ensure that no one is denied of education due to economic backwardness and poverty. (d) To make right to education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6‚Äì14 years. (e) To universalise education through its flagship programmes such as Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Midday Meal Scheme However, even after five years of implementation of NCMP, not much progress has been seen on this front. Although the country targeted towards devoting 6% share of the GDP towards the educational sector, the performance has definitely fallen short of expectations. Expenditure on education has steadily risen from 0.64% of GDP in 1951‚Äì52 to 2.31% in 1970‚Äì71 and thereafter reached the peak of 4.26% in 2000‚Äì01. However, it declined to 3.49% in 2004‚Äì05. There is a definite need to step-up again. As a proportion of total government expenditure, it has declined from around 11.1% in 2000‚Äì2001 to around 9.98% during UPA rule, even though ideally it should be around 20% of the total budget. A policy brief issued by [Network for Social Accountability (NSA)] titled \\"[NSA Response to Education Sector Interventions in Union Budget: UPA Rule and the Education Sector] \\" provides significant revelation to this fact. Due to a declining priority of education in the public policy paradigm in India, there has been an exponential growth in the private expenditure on education also. [As per the available information, the private out of pocket expenditure by the working class population for the education of their children in India has increased by around 1150 percent or around 12.5 times over the last decade].

It consisted of 19 men led by Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills, with the objective of crossing Australia from Melbourne in the south, to the Gulf of Carpentaria in the north, a distance of around 3,250 kilometres (approximately 2,000 miles). At that time most of the inland of Australia had not been explored by non-Indigenous people and was largely unknown to the European settlers. The expedition left Melbourne in winter. Very bad weather, poor roads and broken-down horse wagons meant they made slow progress at first. After dividing the party at Menindee on the Darling River Burke made good progress, reaching Cooper Creek at the beginning of summer. The expedition established a depot camp at the Cooper, and Burke, Wills and two other men pushed on to the north coast (although swampland stopped them from reaching the northern coastline). The return journey was plagued by delays and monsoon rains, and when they reached the depot at Cooper Creek, they found it had been abandoned just hours earlier. Burke and Wills died on or about 30 June 1861. Several relief expeditions were sent out, all contributing new geographical findings. Altogether, seven men lost their lives, and only one man, the Irish soldier John King, crossed the continent with the expedition and returned alive to Melbourne. Background Gold was discovered in Victoria in 1851 and the subsequent gold rush led to a huge influx of migrants, with the local population increasing from 29,000 in 1851 to 139,916 in 1861 (Sydney had 93,686 at the time). The colony became very wealthy and Melbourne grew rapidly to become Australia's largest city and the second largest city of the British Empire.Statesmen's Year Book 1889. The boom lasted forty years and ushered in the era known as \\"marvellous Melbourne\\". The influx of educated gold seekers from England, Ireland and Germany led to rapid growth of schools, churches, learned societies, libraries and art galleries. The University of Melbourne was founded in 1855 and the State Library of Victoria in 1856. The Philosophical Institute of Victoria was founded in 1854 and became the Royal Society of Victoria after receiving a Royal Charter in 1859. By 1855 there was speculation about possible routes for the Australian Overland Telegraph Line to connect Australia to the new telegraph cable in Java and then Europe. There was fierce competition between the colonies over the route with governments recognising the economic benefits that would result from becoming the centre of the telegraph network. A number of routes were considered including Ceylon to Albany in Western Australia, or Java to the north coast of Australia and then either onto east coast, or south through the centre of the continent to Adelaide.Exploring the Stuart Highway : further than the eye can see, 1997, p. 24 The Victorian government organised the Burke and Wills expedition to cross the continent in 1860. The South Australian government offered a reward of ¬£2000 to encourage an expedition to find a route between South Australia and the north coast. Exploration Committee Robert O'Hara Burke by William Strutt William John Wills In 1857 the Philosophical Institute formed an Exploration Committee with the aim of investigating the practicability of fitting out an exploring expedition. While interest in inland exploration was strong in the neighbouring colonies of New South Wales and South Australia, in Victoria enthusiasm was limited. Even the anonymous donation of ¬£1,000 (later discovered to be from Ambrose Kyte) to the Fund Raising Committee of the Royal Society failed to generate much interest and it was 1860 before sufficient money was raised and the expedition was assembled. The Exploration Committee called for offers of interest for a leader for the Victorian Exploring Expedition. Only two members of the Committee, Ferdinand von Mueller and Wilhelm Blandowski, had any experience in exploration but due to factionalism both were consistently outvoted. Several people were considered for the post of leader and the Society held a range of meetings in early 1860. Robert O'Hara Burke was selected by committee ballot as the leader, and William John Wills was recommended as surveyor, navigator and third-in-command. Burke had no experience in exploration and it is strange that he was chosen to lead the expedition. Burke was an Irish-born ex-officer with the Austrian army, and later became police superintendent with virtually no skills in bushcraft. Wills was more adept than Burke at living in the wilderness, but it was Burke's leadership that was especially detrimental to the mission. Rather than take cattle to be slaughtered during the trip the Committee decided to experiment with dried meat. The weight required three extra wagons and was to slow the expedition down appreciably. =Instructions from the Exploration Committee= Instructions issued to Robert O'Hara Burke, Leader of the Victorian Exploration Expedition. MS13071 State Library Victoria (Australia) The Victorian Exploration Committee gave Burke written instructions. These included suggestions for the route to take but also gave Burke discretion depending on conditions and barriers he might encounter. The instructions were signed by the Honorary Secretary Dr John Macadam and in part advised: =Members of the Exploration Committee= The Exploration Committee of the Royal Society of Victoria included: * Sir William Foster Stawell, Chief Justice of Victoria * Dr David Elliott Wilkie MD., Treasurer * Dr John Macadam, Honorary Secretary * Professor Georg Neumayer * Dr Ferdinand von Mueller, Government Botanist * Sir Frederick McCoy, Melbourne University's first professor * The Hon.

Camels Camels had been used successfully in desert exploration in other parts of the world, but by 1859 only seven camels had been imported into Australia. The Victorian Government appointed George James Landells to purchase 24 camels in India for use in desert exploration. The animals arrived in Melbourne in June 1860 and the Exploration Committee purchased an additional six from George Coppin's Cremorne Gardens. The camels were initially housed in the stables at Parliament House and later moved to Royal Park. Twenty-six camels were taken on the expedition, with six (two females with their two young calves and two males) being left in Royal Park. Departure from Melbourne Nicholas Chevalier, Memorandum of the Start of the Exploring Expedition, oil on canvas, 1860, Art Gallery of South Australia Monument in Royal Park, Melbourne where the expedition commenced The expedition set off from Royal Park, Melbourne at about 4 pm on 20 August 1860 watched by around 15,000 spectators. The 19 men of the expedition included six Irishmen, five Englishmen, three Afghan and one Indian camel drivers, three Germans and an American. They took 23 horses, 6 wagons and 26 camels. The expedition took a large amount of equipment, including enough food to last two years, a cedar-topped oak camp table with two chairs, rockets, flags and a Chinese gong; the equipment all together weighed as much as 20 tonnes. Committee member Captain Francis Cadell had offered to transport the supplies from Adelaide up the Murray to the junction with the Darling River to be collected on the way. However, Burke declined his offer, possibly because Cadell had opposed Burke's appointment as leader of the expedition. Everything was instead loaded onto six wagons. One wagon broke down before it had even left Royal Park and by midnight of the first day the expedition had reached only Essendon on the edge of Melbourne. At Essendon two more wagons broke down. Heavy rains and bad roads made travelling through Victoria difficult and time-consuming. The party arrived at Lancefield on 23 August and set up their fourth camp. The first day off was taken on Sunday, 26 August at Camp VI in Mia Mia. Crossing the Terrick-Terrick Plains - Ludwig Becker (MS13867/4) The expedition reached Swan Hill on 6 September and arrived in Balranald on 15 September. There, to lighten the load, they left behind their sugar, lime juice and some of their guns and ammunition. At Gambala on 24 September, Burke decided to load some of the provisions onto the camels for the first time, and to lessen the burden on the horses he ordered the men to walk. He also ordered that personal luggage be restricted to . At Bilbarka on the Darling, Burke and his second-in-command, Landells, argued after Burke decided to dump the 60 gallons (‚âà270 litres) of rum that Landells had brought to feed to the camels in the belief that it prevented scurvy. At Kinchega on the Darling, Landells resigned from the expedition, followed by the expedition's surgeon, Dr Hermann Beckler. Third-in-command Wills was promoted to second-in-command. They reached Menindee on 12 October having taken two months to travel from Melbourne‚Äîthe regular mail coach did the journey in little more than a week. Two of the expedition's five officers had resigned, thirteen members of the expedition had been fired and eight new men had been hired. In July 1859 the South Australian government offered a reward of ¬£2,000 (about A$289,000 in 2011 dollars) for the first successful south-north crossing of the continent west of the 143rd line of longitude. The experienced explorer John McDouall Stuart had taken up the challenge. Burke was concerned Stuart might beat him to the north coast and he soon grew impatient with their slow progress often averaging only an hour. Burke split the group, taking the strongest horses, seven of the fittest men and a small amount of equipment, with plans to push on quickly to Cooper Creek (then known as Cooper's Creek) and then wait for the others to catch up. They left Menindee on 19 October, guided by William Wright who was appointed third-in-command. Travel was relatively easy because recent rain made water abundant, while in unusually mild weather temperatures exceeded only twice before the party reached Cooper Creek. At Torowotto Swamp Wright was sent back to Menindee alone to bring up the remainder of the men and supplies and Burke continued on to Cooper Creek. Cooper Creek Bullah Bullah Waterhole In 1860 Cooper Creek was the outer limit of the land that had been explored by Europeans, the river having been visited by Captain Charles Sturt in 1845 and Augustus Charles Gregory in 1858. Burke arrived at the Cooper on 11 November and they formed a depot at Camp LXIII (Camp 63) while they conducted reconnaissance to the north. A plague of rats forced the men to move camp and they formed a second depot further downstream at Bullah Bullah Waterhole. This was Camp LXV (Camp 65) and they erected a stockade and named the place Fort Wills. It was thought that Burke would wait at Cooper Creek until autumn (March the next year) so that they would avoid having to travel during the hot Australian summer. However, Burke waited only until Sunday, 16 December before deciding to make a dash for the Gulf of Carpentaria. He split the group again, leaving William Brahe in charge of the depot, with Dost Mahomet, William Patton and Thomas McDonough. Burke, Wills, John King and Charles Gray set off for the Gulf with six camels, one horse and enough food for just three months. By now it was mid-summer and the daily temperature often reached in the shade, and in the Strzelecki and Sturt Stony Deserts there was very little shade to be found. Brahe was ordered by Burke to wait for three months; however, the more conservative Wills had reviewed the maps and developed a more realistic view of the task ahead, and secretly instructed Brahe to wait for four months.Dave Phoenix of the Burke & Wills Historical Society, Tony Robinson Explores Australia, Episode 4, Eureka. History Channel. Broadcast on YLE Teema 31 July 2012.  Gulf of Carpentaria Edward Jukes Greig, Arrival of Burke & Wills at Flinders River, oil on canvas, 1862, State Library of New South Wales Except for the heat, travel was easy. As a result of recent rains water was still easy to find and the Aborigines, contrary to expectations, were peaceful. On 9 February 1861 they reached the Little Bynoe River, an arm of the Flinders River delta, where they found they could not reach the ocean because of the mangrove swamps in their way. Burke and Wills left the camels behind with King and Gray at Camp CXIX (Camp 119), and set off through the swamps, although after they decided to turn back. By this stage, they were desperately short of supplies. They had food left for 27 days, but it had already taken them 59 days to travel from Cooper Creek. The return journey On their way north, the weather had been hot and dry, but on the way back the wet season broke and the tropical monsoonal rains began. A camel named Golah Sing was abandoned on 4 March when it was unable to continue. Three other camels were shot and eaten along the way and they shot their only horse, Billy, on 10 April on the Diamantina River, south of what is today the town of Birdsville. Equipment was abandoned at a number of locations as the number of pack animals was reduced. One of these locations, Return Camp 32, was relocated in 1994 and The Burke and Wills Historical Society mounted an expedition to verify the discovery of camel bones in 2005. To extend their food supply, they ate portulaca. Gray also caught an Python (probably Aspidites melanocephalus, a black-headed python), which they ate. Both Burke and Gray immediately came down with dysentery. Gray was ill, but Burke thought he was \\"gammoning\\" (pretending). On 25 March on the Burke River (just south of what is now the town of Boulia), Gray was caught stealing skilligolee (a type of watery porridge) and Burke beat him. By 8 April, Gray could not walk; he died on 17 April of dysentery at a place they called Polygonum Swamp. The location of Gray's death is unknown, although it is generally believed to be Lake Massacre in South Australia. While the possibility that Burke killed Gray has been discounted, the severity of the beating Burke gave has been widely debated. The three surviving men stopped for a day to bury Gray, and to recover their strength‚Äîthey were by this stage very weak from hunger and exhaustion. They finally reached Cooper Creek on 21 April, only to find that the camp had been abandoned several hours earlier.  Return to Cooper Creek  John Longstaff, Arrival of Burke, Wills and King at the deserted camp at Cooper's Creek, Sunday evening, 21 April 1861, oil on canvas, 1907, National Gallery of Victoria Burke had asked Brahe and the depot party to remain at the camp on the Cooper for 13 weeks. The party had actually waited for 18 weeks and was running low on supplies and starting to feel the effects of scurvy; they had come to believe that Burke would never return from the Gulf. After one of his men had injured his leg, Brahe decided to return to Menindee, but before leaving buried some provisions in case Burke did return, and blazed (cut or carved) a message on a tree to mark the spot. Brahe left the depot on Cooper Creek on the morning of Sunday, 21 April 1861. Burke, Wills and King returned that evening. Finding the camp deserted, they dug up the cache of supplies, and a letter explaining that the party had given up waiting and had left. Burke's team had missed them by only nine hours. The three men and two remaining camels were exhausted; they had no hope of catching up to the main party. George Washington Lambert, Burke and Wills on the way to Mount Hopeless, watercolour, 1907, Bendigo Art Gallery They decided to rest and recuperate, living off the supplies left in the cache. Wills and King wanted to follow their outward track back to Menindee, but Burke overruled them and decided to attempt to reach the furthest outpost of pastoral settlement in South Australia, a cattle station near Mount Hopeless. This would mean travelling southwest through the desert for . They wrote a letter explaining their intentions and reburied it in the cache under the marked tree in case a rescue party visited the area. Unfortunately, they did not change the mark on the tree or alter the date. On 23 April they set off, following the Cooper downstream and then heading out into the Strzelecki Desert towards Mount Hopeless. Meanwhile, while returning to Menindee, Brahe had met with Wright trying to reach the Cooper with the supplies. The two men decided to go back to Cooper Creek to see if Burke had returned. When they arrived on Sunday, 8 May, Burke had already left for Mount Hopeless, and the camp was again deserted. Burke and Wills were away by this point. As the mark and date on the tree were unaltered, Brahe and Wright assumed that Burke had not returned, and did not think to check whether the supplies were still buried. They left to rejoin the main party and return to Menindee.  Controversy  Brahe might have stayed at Cooper Creek longer, but one of his men, the blacksmith Patton, had injured his leg after being thrown from his horse, so they decided to leave for Menindee that morning. Patton was to die from complications six weeks later. Burke and Wills discussed catching up with them, but they were too exhausted and decided to wait. Meanwhile, the other mission led by William Wright was having terrible problems of its own. Wright was supposed to bring supplies up from Menindee to Cooper Creek, but it was the end of January 1861 before he managed to set out from Menindee. Wright's delay subsequently resulted in his being blamed for the deaths of Burke and Wills. In 1963, Alan Moorehead wrote of the 'mystery' surrounding Wright's delay: An in-depth study of Wright's action formed a part of Dr Tom Bergin's 1982 MA thesis. Bergin, who recreated the original journey from Cooper Creek to the Gulf of Carpentaria with camels in 1978, showed that a lack of money and too few pack animals to carry the supplies meant Wright was placed in an unenviable position. His requests to the Exploration Committee were not acted on until early January, by which time the hot weather and lack of water meant that the party moved extremely slowly. They were harassed by the Bandjigali and Karenggapa Murris, and three of the men, Dr Ludwig Becker, Charles Stone and William Purcell, died from malnutrition on the trip. On his way north, Wright camped at Koorliatto Waterhole on the Bulloo River while he tried to find Burke's tracks to Cooper Creek. While he was there he met Brahe, who was on his way back from the Cooper to Menindee. The Dig Tree The Dig Tree on Cooper CreekThe camp blaze, B LXV on the Dig Tree Brahe blazed two trees () at Depot Camp LXV on the banks of Bullah Bullah Waterhole on Cooper Creek, both are coolibahs (Eucalyptus coolabah formerly Eucalyptus microtheca) and both are estimated to be at least 250 years old. One tree has two blazes on it; one denoting the date of arrival and the date of departure \\"DEC-6-60\\" carved over \\"APR-21-61\\" and the other showing the initial \\"B\\" (for Burke) carved over the Roman numerals for (camp) 65; \\"B\\" over \\"LXV\\". The date blaze has grown closed and only the camp number blaze remains visible today. On an adjacent smaller tree Brahe carved the instruction to 'DIG'. The exact inscription is not known, but is variously recalled to be \\"DIG\\", \\"DIG under\\", \\"DIG 3 FT N.W.\\", \\"DIG 3FT N.E.\\" or \\"DIG 21 APR 61\\". Initially the tree with the Date and Camp Number blaze was known as \\"Brahe's Tree\\" or the \\"Depot Tree\\" and the tree under which Burke died attracted most attention and interest. However, the tree at Depot Camp LXV became known as the \\"Dig Tree\\" from at least 1912. In 1899 John Dick carved a likeness of Burke's face in a nearby tree along with his initials, his wife's initials and the date. Burke, Wills and King alone at Cooper Creek After leaving the Dig Tree they rarely travelled more than a day. One of the two remaining camels, Landa, became bogged in Minkie Waterhole and the other, Rajah was shot when he could travel no further. Without pack animals, Burke, Wills and King were unable to carry enough water to leave Cooper Creek and cross the Strzelecki Desert to Mount Hopeless, and so the three men were unable to leave the creek. Their supplies were running low and they were malnourished and exhausted. The Cooper Creek Aborigines, the Yandruwandha people, gave them fish, beans called padlu and a type of damper made from the ground sporocarps of the ngardu (nardoo) plant (Marsilea drummondii) in exchange for sugar. At the end of May 1861, Wills returned to the Dig Tree to put his diary, notebook and journals in the cache for safekeeping. Burke bitterly criticised Brahe in his journal for not leaving behind any supplies or animals. While Wills was away from camp, Burke foolishly shot his pistol at one of the Aborigines, causing the whole group to flee. Within a month of the Aborigines' departure, Burke and Wills both perished. =Death= Artur Loureiro, Death of Burke, oil on canvas, 1892, private collection Towards the end of June 1861 as the three men were following the Cooper upstream to find the Yandruwandha campsite, Wills became too weak to continue. He was left behind at his own insistence at Breerily Waterhole with some food, water and shelter. Burke and King continued upstream for another two days until Burke became too weak to continue. The next morning Burke died. King stayed with his body for two days and then returned downstream to Breerily Waterhole, where he found that Wills had died as well. The exact dates on which Burke and Wills died are unknown and different dates are given on various memorials in Victoria. The Exploration Committee fixed 28 June 1861 as the date both explorers died. King found a group of Yandruwandha willing to give him food and shelter and in return he shot birds to contribute to their supplies. Rescue expeditions In 1861 five expeditions were sent out to search for Burke and Wills; two commissioned by the Exploration Committee of the Royal Society of Victoria, one by the Government of Victoria one by the Government of Queensland and one by the Government of South Australia. The HMCSS Victoria was sent from Melbourne to search the Gulf of Carpentaria for the missing expedition, and the SS Firefly sailed from Melbourne to Brisbane where they picked up Landsborough's Queensland Relief Expedition. The other expeditions went overland, with Howitt's Victorian Contingent Party departing from Melbourne, McKinlay's South Australian Burke Relief Expedition departing from Adelaide and Walker's Victorian Relief Expedition departing from Rockhampton. =Victorian Contingent Party= After six months without receiving word from the Burke expedition, the media began questioning its whereabouts. Public pressure for answers increased and on 13 June 1861, the Exploration Committee agreed to send a search party to find the Burke and Wills expedition and, if necessary, offer them support. The Victorian Contingent Party left Melbourne on 26 June 1861 under the leadership of Alfred William Howitt. At the Loddon River Howitt met Brahe, who was returning from Cooper Creek. As Brahe did not have knowledge of Burke's whereabouts, Howitt decided a much larger expedition would be required to find the missing party. Leaving three of his men at the river, Howitt returned to Melbourne with Brahe to update the Exploration Committee. On 30 June the expanded expedition left to follow Burke‚Äôs trail. On 3 September the party reached Cooper Creek, on 11 September the Dig Tree, and four days later Edwin Welch found King living with the Yandruwandha. Over the next nine days Howitt found the remains of Burke and Wills and buried them. In pitiful condition, King survived the two-month trip back to Melbourne, and died eleven years later, aged 33, never having recovered his health. He is buried in the Melbourne General Cemetery. =HMCSS Victoria= H.M. Colonial Steam-sloop \\"VICTORIA\\", 580 Tons, 150 Horse Power. State Library Victoria H6503 On 4 August 1861, the HMCSS Victoria under the Command of William Henry Norman sailed from Hobson's Bay in Victoria with orders to search the Gulf of Carpentaria. The Victorian Government also chartered the ship SS Firefly to assist with transportation. Firefly left Hobson‚Äôs Bay (Melbourne) on 29 July and arrived at Moreton Bay on 10 August 1861, the same day as HMCS Victoria. Firefly transported the Queensland party led by William Landsborough, and thirty horses. The two ships sailed for the Gulf of Carpentaria on 25 August 1861. The ships became separated in a storm on 1 September and Firefly hit a reef off Sir Charles Hardy's Islands. The crew were able to free and save 26 of the horses by cutting a hole in the side of the ship. Victoria arrived shortly after. The Firefly was repaired and able to be towed by Victoria. They recommenced their journey on 22 September, arriving near Sweer Island and Albert River on 29 September where they rendezvoused with the brig Gratia and the schooner Native Lass, which had also been chartered by the Victorian government as support. Using the Victoria‚Äôs boats Firefly was manoeuvred up the Albert River some 20 miles to a suitable place to transfer the horses and stores to land. =Queensland Relief Expedition= After disembarking from the Victoria in November, the Queensland Relief Expedition, under the leadership of William Landsborough, searched the gulf coast for the missing expedition. The party proceeded south and while they didn‚Äôt find any trace of the Burke and Wills party they continued all the way to Melbourne arriving in August 1862. This was the first European expedition to traverse mainland Australia from northern to southern coast. In 1881 the Queensland Parliament awarded Landsborough ¬£2000 for his achievements as an explorer. =Victorian Relief Expedition= William Hodgkinson, Bulla, Queensland, watercolour, 1861, National Library of Australia. Hodgkinson briefly joined the Burke and Wills expedition at Swan Hill, and was a member of two relief expeditions. Bulla depicts the Victorian Relief Expedition in armed conflict with Bulloo Aborigines. Frederick Walker led the Victorian Relief Expedition. The party, consisting of twelve mounted men, seven of them ex-troopers from the Native Police Corps, started from Rockhampton on 7 September 1861 with the goal of reaching the Gulf of Carpentaria. They found traces of Burke and followed them to Burke‚Äôs northernmost Camp, but lost the trail from there. On 4 December, they came across a group of Aborigines, killing 12 in the fight that ensued. On 7 December, Walker met up with the HMVS Victoria in the Gulf. Walker‚Äôs party went on to explore much of the Gulf region. =South Australian Burke Relief Expedition= The South Australian House of Assembly chose John McKinlay to lead the South Australian relief expedition that left Adelaide on 16 August 1861., by John McKinlay On 20 October the grave of a European, thought to be Charles Gray, was found at Polygonum Swamp near Cooper Creek. Finding another grave nearby, McKinlay assumed that the Burke expedition had been killed there and named the site Massacre Lake. Learning that Howitt had found the remains of Burke and Wills, McKinlay decided to search in the direction of Central Mount Stuart but was driven back by heavy rains and floods. McKinlay then made for the Gulf of Carpentaria, hoping to find the HMVS Victoria still there. By 20 May 1862, McKinlay was around five miles (8 km) from the shore of the Gulf, but the intervening country was found to be impassable and he decided to turn east and make for Port Denison on the north Queensland coast. On 2 August 1862, McKinlay reached a station on the Bowen River near Port Denison and after resting a few days the expedition reached Port Denison. The party then returned by sea to Adelaide. McKinlay received a grant of ¬£1000 from the government and a gold watch from the Royal Geographical Society of England. =1862 Victorian Exploration Party= In 1862 Alfred Howitt and was tasked with returning to Cooper Creek, exhuming Burke and Wills' remains and returning them to Melbourne for a State Funeral. On 9 December 1861 Howitt left Melbourne for the Cooper. After a long stay in Menindee and again at Mount Murchison the party arrived at Cooper Creek on 25 February 1862, camping at Cullyamurra waterhole. From there Howitt undertook numerous exploratory trips into the surrounding area. On 13 April 1862, Wills' remains were exhumed, and in September 1862, Burke's bones were retrieved from the grave that Howitt had dug a year earlier. For the next six months Howitt explored the Australian interior before deciding in November to return to the settled areas. On 8 December the party arrived in Clare, South Australia. Howitt and the expedition's doctor continued on to Adelaide while the rest of the expedition members followed three days later by train. Burke's and Wills' remains were then taken to Melbourne, arriving on 29 December 1862. Presentation to the Yandruwandha Breastplates were issued to Aboriginal people between 1815 and 1946 for faithful service, for saving the lives of non-Indigenous people and to recognise stockmen and trackers.A history of Aboriginal Breastplates , National Museum of Australia, accessed 7 April 2011 On this trip to exhume Burke and Wills' remains, Howitt presented three breastplates commissioned by the Victorian Exploration Committee to the Yandruwandha people in appreciation of the assistance they had given to Burke, Wills and King. One of these plates is in the collection of the National Museum of Australia. The inscription on the plate states that it was presented \\"for the Humanity shewn to the Explorers Burke, Wills and King 1861\\".Victorian Exploring Expedition breastplate, National Museum of Australia . Retrieved 4 April 2011. Cause of death Aborigines fed the explorers seedcakes made from the sporocarps of this plant, nardoo. Unknown to the explorers, ngardu sporocarps contain the enzyme thiaminase, which depletes the body of vitamin B1 (thiamin). It is probable that they were not preparing the seedcakes in accordance with Aboriginal food preparation methods, as the food was a staple among the local people. It has been argued that they did not first process the food into a paste, which might have prevented the ill effects they suffered. Despite eating, the men got weaker and weaker. Wills wrote in his diary: > My pulse is at 48 and very weak and my legs and arms are nearly skin and > bone. I can only look out like Mr Micawber for something to turn up, but > starvation on nardoo is by no means unpleasant, but for the weakness one > feels, and the utter inability to move oneself, for as the appetite is > concerned, it gives me the greatest satisfaction. As a result, it is likely that the deaths of Burke and Wills resulted in part from a vitamin deficiency disease called beriberi. Evidence to this effect is further provided by King's account, which revealed that Burke complained of leg and back pain shortly before his death. However, other research suggests that scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) and environmental factors also contributed to their deaths.

Howitt was sent back to Cooper Creek to recover their bodies. =Commission of Enquiry= A Commission of Enquiry was convened on 18 November 1861, and the results of their investigations were presented to both houses of the Colonial Parliament. It was laid on the table of the Legislative Council on 4 March 1862. The Commission found that Burke ‚Äúevinced far greater amount of zeal than prudence in finally departing from Cooper‚Äôs Creek before the depot party had arrived from Menindie‚Äù, found the conduct of Mr Wright ‚Äúto have been reprehensible‚Äù and had some sympathy for Brahe, upon whom ‚Äúa responsibility far beyond his expectations devolved upon him‚Äù. The Commission judged that in leaving the depot before Burke returned or further relief had arrived was regrettable, but that Brahe had \\"acted from a conscientious desire to discharge his duty.‚Äù Subsequent historians have posited that the commissioners were compromised by their close relationships with members of the Royal Society and failed to question them with the same zeal that was applied to men like Brahe. =Funeral= The Burke and Wills funeral procession Howitt sailed from Adelaide to Melbourne on the SS Havilah with the remains of Burke and Wills in a small wooden box, arriving at Sandridge on 28 December 1862. Order of the funeral procession of Burke and Wills, Wednesday, 21st January, 1863The box was taken to the hall of the Royal Society of Victoria, and a coffining ceremony was held on 31 December. This ceremony was delayed because Macadam, who held the only key to the box, arrived late. A lock smith was called but before he could pick the lock Dr Macadam, blaming his own distress for his lateness, finally arrived with the key. This minor farce perhaps reflecting the confusion and poor organization of the entire expedition. The remains were placed in state for two weeks and around 100,000 people visited the Royal Society of Victoria to view the coffins. It was originally proposed that the funeral should take place at St James Cathedral but it was decided this would be impractical because of the expected crowds and the difficulty of moving the coffins into the church from the grand mourning vehicle. It was agreed that a service at the cemetery would be appropriate. The order and carriage of the clergy was discussed with agreement that they would walk in the procession with the Protestant clergy in front followed by the Roman Catholics. This small example of ecumenism is interesting given the general enmity and divisive sectarianism between Irish Catholics and English Protestants that blighted Victoria‚Äôs history for a century. The funeral was held on 21 January 1863. It was an elaborate affair, with the funeral car modelled on the design used for the Duke of Wellington ten years earlier. It was estimated that 40,000 people lined the streets of Melbourne. Melbourne's population was estimated at only 120,000 at the time. Many had travelled from country Victoria, especially the Castlemaine area where Burke had served most recently as Police Superintendent. (The total population of Victoria was about 600,000). Burke and Wills were buried at the Melbourne General Cemetery. At the cemetery the Dean of Melbourne, Hussey Burgh Macartney, conducted a Church of England burial service, but clergy representing various Christian denominations were represented in the funeral procession. At 8 p.m. that evening there was a public meeting at St. George's Hall, where Macadam addressed the crowd, and acknowledged the contributions of Ambrose Kyte, Howitt, and Commander Norman. =Legacy= In some ways the tragic expedition was not a waste. It completed the picture of inland Australia, and proved that there was no inland sea. More importantly, each of the rescue parties sent from different parts of the continent added in some way to the understanding of the land it crossed. Burke and Wills Statue by Charles Summers on the corner of Collins and Swanston Streets, Melbourne.In 1862 monuments were erected in Back Creek Cemetery, Bendigo, and also on the hill overlooking Castlemaine where Burke had been stationed before leading the expedition. The Victorian towns of Beechworth and Fryerstown also unveiled memorials. In 1863, when Julius von Haast searched for a crossing from Otago to the West Coast in New Zealand, he named two rivers flowing into the Haast River after Burke and Wills. On 21 April 1865, the anniversary of the return to Cooper's Creek, a monument by Charles Summers was unveiled in Melbourne by the Governor, Sir Charles Darling. In 1867 Ballarat erected the Explorer's Fountain on Sturt and Lydiard Streets. Wills, his brother Tom and their father, Dr William Wills, had all lived in Ballarat. In 1890 a monument was erected at Royal Park, the expedition's departure point in Melbourne. The plaque on the monument states, \\"This memorial has been erected to mark the spot from whence the Burke and Wills Expedition started on 20 August 1860. After successfully accomplishing their mission the two brave leaders perished on their return journey at Coopers Creek in June 1861.\\" In 1983 they were honoured on a postage stamp depicting their portraits issued by Australia Post. In August 2010 Australia Post issued four stamps to commemorate the 150th anniversary. In 1918 a silent movie, A Romance of Burke and Wills Expedition of 1860, was released. The plot is fictional and only loosely connected to the Burke and Wills expedition. In 1975 an episode of a British documentary series called The Explorers on the BBC featured the Australian expedition story, in an episode titled Burke and Wills, narrated by David Attenborough (replaced with narration by Anthony Quinn in the later 1976 US broadcast) and directed by Lord Snowdon. In 1985 the film, Burke & Wills, was made with Jack Thompson as Burke, and Nigel Havers as Wills. Also in 1985, the spoof Wills & Burke was released with Garry McDonald as Burke and Kym Gyngell as Wills. In November 2009 the Royal Australian Mint issued two coins, $1 and a 20 cent, to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the expedition.

It is particularly associated with two families: the Beauforts, who held the title from the creation of 1448, and the Seymours, from the creation of 1547, in whose name the title is still held. The present dukedom is unique, in that the first holder of the title created it for himself in his capacity of Lord Protector of the Kingdom of England, using a power granted in the will of his nephew King Edward VI. The only subsidiary title of the duke of Somerset is Baron Seymour, which is used as a courtesy title by the eldest son and heir of the duke. This courtesy title is the lowest in rank of all heirs to dukedoms in the peerages of the British Isles, yet the holder's precedence is higher than his title suggests, by virtue of the seniority of the Dukedom of Somerset (the only more senior non-royal duke is the Duke of Norfolk). Several other titles have been held by the dukes of Somerset, but have become extinct. These include: Earl of Kendal (created 1443, extinct 1444), Earl of Somerset (created 1397, forfeit 1461), Marquess of Dorset (created 1397, degraded 1399; created 1442, forfeit 1461), Marquess of Somerset (created 1397, degraded 1399), Earl of Dorset (created 1441, forfeit 1461), Viscount Rochester (created 1611, extinct 1645), Viscount Beauchamp of Hache (created 1536, forfeit 1552), Earl of Hertford (created 1537, forfeit 1552; and created 1559, extinct 1750), Marquess of Hertford (created 1640, extinct 1675), Baron Seymour of Trowbridge (created 1641, extinct 1750), Baron Percy (created 1722, separated 1750), Baron Cockermouth (created 1749, separated 1750), Earl of Egremont (created 1749, separated 1750), and Earl St. Maur (created 1863, extinct 1885). The ducal seat is Bradley House in Maiden Bradley, west Wiltshire, with a secondary estate at Berry Pomeroy Castle, Totnes, Devon. The principal burial place for the Seymour family today is All Saints' Church, Maiden Bradley, adjacent to Bradley House; the church and the family cemetery can be reached from the grounds of Bradley House via private access.The grave of Algernon Seymour, 15th Duke of Somerset, 19 July 2013 Creation of Empress Matilda William de Mohun of Dunster (?‚Äìc. 1155), a favourite of Empress Matilda and a loyal supporter of her in the war against King Stephen (during which he earned the epithet of the \\"Scourge of the West\\"), was given the title Earl of Somerset in 1141. In the foundation charter of the priory at Bruton he describes himself as \\"Willielmus de Moyne, comes Somersetensis\\". The title was not recognised by Stephen or Henry II (Matilda's son), and his descendants did not use the title. Beaufort creations Beaufort arms: Royal arms of King Edward III (with France modern) within a bordure compony argent and azure John Beaufort (1371/1373‚Äì1410) was the eldest son from John of Gaunt's marriage to Katherine Swynford. He was created Earl of Somerset on 10 February 1397 and on 9 September 1397 he was created Marquess of Somerset following his marriage to Margaret Holland, daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent and was created Marquess of Dorset on 29 September 1397. In 1399 upon the accession of Henry IV his marquessates were revoked. The Commons petitioned the King for his restoration but he himself objected stating \\"the name of marquess is a strange name in this realm\\". He was succeeded as Earl of Somerset by his son Henry Beaufort (1401‚Äì1418), but his early death left the title to his brother John Beaufort (1404‚Äì1444). He was created Duke of Somerset and Earl of Kendal on 28 August 1443. He died on 27 May 1444, possibly through suicide. The dukedom and the Earldom of Kendal became extinct. The Earldom of Somerset passed to his brother Edmund Beaufort, Count of Mortain (c.1406‚Äì1455). Edmund had been created Earl of Dorset on 18 August 1442 and Marquess of Dorset on 24 June 1443. He was created Duke of Somerset under a new creation on 31 March 1448. However he is usually referred to as the 2nd Duke of Somerset. The second duke was killed at the First Battle of St Albans on 22 May 1455 and his titles passed to his son Henry Beaufort (1436‚Äì1464) who had been known as the Earl of Dorset since his father's creation as Duke of Somerset. After the defeat at the battle of Towton on 29 March 1461 he fled to Scotland and was attainted on 4 November 1461. All his honours and estates were declared forfeit. His titles were restored to him on 10 March 1463 but he deserted the King and was captured and beheaded after the battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464. He was unmarried but his illegitimate son Charles Somerset became the 1st Earl of Worcester. Henry's titles were forfeited by act of Parliament; but his brother Edmund Beaufort (c.1439‚Äì1471) was styled Duke of Somerset by the Lancastrians.Jonathan Hughes, \\"Somerset , Charles, first earl of Worcester (c.1460‚Äì1526)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edition, January 2007 [accessed 1 Sept 2010] (Subscription required for online version) After the Battle of Tewkesbury on 4 May 1471 he fled and took refuge in Tewkesbury Abbey. He was beheaded by the Yorkists, and buried in the abbey church. Upon his death the house of Beaufort became extinct in the legitimate line. Royal family creations In 1499 Henry VII nominated his infant son Edmund to the dukedom of Somerset at his baptism, but the child, just over a year old when he died, was probably never formally created a peer. The illegitimate son of Henry VIII, Henry Fitzroy, (1519‚Äì1536), by Bessie Blount, was created Earl of Nottingham, and Duke of Richmond and Somerset on 18 June 1525. He died without heirs on 22 July 1536 so his titles became extinct. Earl of Somerset under James VI and I Robert Carr (c.1590‚Äì1645), born Kerr/Ker, son of Sir Thomas Ker of Ferniehirst, became a favourite of King James VI and I. On 25 March 1611 he was created Viscount Rochester, and subsequently a privy councillor. On the death of Lord Salisbury in 1612 he began to act as the king‚Äôs secretary. On the 3 November 1613 he was created Earl of Somerset. He died in July 1645, leaving a daughter, Anne. His titles became extinct. Seymour creation and 17th century claim to revert to Beaufort creations Arms of Seymour: Gules, two wings conjoined in lure or Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset (c.1500‚Äì1552), was a brother of Henry VIII's third wife, Jane Seymour. Henry had him created Viscount Beauchamp of Hache in 1536 and Earl of Hertford in 1537. He became Lord Protector of England at the start of the minority of his nephew, Edward VI between 1547 and 1549. Edward Seymour married twice; he divorced his first wife, Catherine Fillol, disowning her and her children, around 1535 and married Anne Stanhope who bore him nine children. In 1547 with Privy Council acquiescence he made himself Duke of Somerset. He bought Berry Pomeroy Castle from Sir Thomas Pomeroy, in 1547, although he probably never visited it. Less than two years after losing his position as lord protector, his titles were forfeited and he was beheaded on 22 January 1552. He was replaced in the minority government of Edward VI by John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, whose pragmatic style contrasted with Seymour's mixture of idealism and arrogance. In 1644 Charles I granted the earldom of Glamorgan to Edward Somerset (1613‚Äì1667). He was a descendant of Charles Somerset, the illegitimate son of Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset. In return for obtaining military help from Ireland he promised Edward the title of Duke of Somerset. Under the Commonwealth Edward was banished from England and his estates were seized. At the Restoration his estates were restored, and he claimed the dukedom of Somerset as promised to him by Charles I. However, this claim was rejected by the House of Lords, and so was the title of Earl of Glamorgan. This enabled King Charles II to restore the ducal title to the fourth creation family, the Seymours, who descend from the country's effective regent, the lord protector in 1547. dexter: A unicorn argent armed unguled and crined or gorged with a ducal coronet per pale azure and or and chained of the last; sinister: A bull azure armed unguled ducally gorged and chained orDebrett's Peerage, 1968, p.1036 Edward Seymour (1538‚Äì1621) was son and heir of Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, from his second marriage. He was created the Earl of Hertford in 1559 under Elizabeth I. His grandson William Seymour (1588‚Äî1660) secretly married Lady Arbella Stuart (1575‚Äì1615) on 22 June 1610. She was the niece of Lord Darnley, a Stuart, first cousin of James I and bar for James's children next in succession to Scottish and English thrones. Both William and Arabella were imprisoned but managed to escape. William fled to Paris, but Arbella was recaptured. She was imprisoned in the Tower of London where she died in 1615. William returned to England shortly after her death and inherited his father's titles in 1621. Charles I received his support and made him Marquess of Hertford in 1640 and on 13 September 1660, shortly before his death on 24 October, the title of Duke of Somerset was restored to him as its legitimate heir, following its non-existence for 108 years. He outlived his three eldest sons and as the dukedom descends to heirs male of the holder of the 1547 grant it passed to William Seymour (1654‚Äì1671) who was the son of the third son mentioned (lived 1626‚Äì1654). The 3rd duke died unmarried and the title passed to John Seymour (bef. 1646‚Äì1675) the last surviving son of the 2nd Duke, his uncle. On his death without issue on 29 April 1675 only the Marquessate of Hertford became extinct. His distant cousin Francis Seymour, 3rd Baron Seymour of Trowbridge (1658‚Äì1678) became 5th Duke of Somerset. Francis was the eldest surviving son of Charles Seymour (1621‚Äì1665), whose father Sir Francis Seymour (c. 1590‚Äì1664), a younger brother of the 2nd Duke of Somerset, had been created Baron Seymour of Trowbridge in 1641. When the 5th Duke died unmarried in 1678, the title passed to his brother, Charles Seymour (1662‚Äì1748), youngest son of the 2nd Baron Trowbridge. The 6th Duke, known as \\"the Proud Duke\\", was a favourite of Queen Anne. He first married Lady Elizabeth Percy, daughter of Joceline Percy, 11th Earl of Northumberland (1644‚Äì1670). She died in 1722 and in 1725 he married Lady Charlotte Finch (1711‚Äì1773), daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham. The 6th duke died 2 December 1748, at Petworth House, Sussex at age 86 leaving the title to his son from his first marriage Algernon Seymour (1684‚Äì1750). ;Later subsidiary titles Algernon had been created Baron Percy in 1722. After succeeding his father as 7th Duke of Somerset he was created Earl of Northumberland in 1749, the Earldom of Northumberland having become extinct with the death of his maternal grandfather in 1670. The remainder of the earldom was to pass to Sir Hugh Smithson, husband of Algernon's daughter Elizabeth Seymour (bef. 1730‚Äì1776), whilst the titles Baron Cockermouth and Earl of Egremont were remaindered to the children of his sister, Lady Catherine Seymour (1693‚Äì1731). Without male issue, on his death in February 1750 these titles therefore passed to different families in accordance with the remainders in the patents of their creation. The earldom of Hertford, the barony of Beauchamp, and the barony of Seymour of Trowbridge became extinct; and the dukedom of Somerset, together with the barony of Seymour, devolved on his distant cousin. ;Later descent Sir Edward Seymour, 6th baronet of Berry Pomeroy (1694‚Äì1757) became the 8th Duke of Somerset in 1750. The 1st baronet was (Sir) Edward Seymour (1556‚Äì1613), son of Edward Seymour (1527/1535‚Äì1593) who was the 1st Duke's eldest son and of Catherine Seymour (n√©e Filliol). He was a seventh-generation descendant of the 1st Duke. The 4th Baronet had been speaker of the House of Commons during the reign of Charles II and he moved the family home from Berry Pomeroy Castle in Devon to Bradley House in Maiden Bradley.Report and Transactions of The Devonshire Association for the Advancement of Science, Literature and the Arts. Vol 133 (2001), p 11-12. Upon this Duke's death he was succeeded by his eldest son Edward Seymour (1717‚Äì1792). He died unmarried and was succeeded by his brother Webb Seymour (1718‚Äì1793) who became the 10th Duke. His son Edward Adolphus Seymour (1775‚Äì1855) was a noted mathematician and became the 11th Duke upon his father's death. He changed the family name to St. Maur, but Seymour was still very often used. 12th Duke and sons, the Earls St. Maur Edward Seymour The 11th Duke was succeeded by his eldest son Edward Adolphus Seymour (1804‚Äì1885) who was created Earl St. Maur, of Berry Pomeroy in 1863. His eldest son who predeceased him Edward A. F. Seymour (1835‚Äì1869) was known as Lord Seymour until 1863 as a courtesy title he adopted Earl St. Maur. Commonly known as Ferdy, he was an adventurer who joined Garibaldi's army under the assumed name of Capt. Richard Sarsfield. In 1866 he began a relationship with a 17-year-old maid called Rosina Swan. The Earl took Rosina with him during his travels, returning to England with her in 1868 to live near Brighton. Ferdy and Rosina had two children; a girl named Ruth (1867‚Äì1953) was born whilst the couple were in Tangier and a boy named Richard 'Harold' St. Maur (1869‚Äì1927) was born in Brighton shortly before the death of his father. Had the Earl married Rosina, Harold would have been the heir to his grandfather's dukedom and for this reason Harold tried to find proof that the couple had married whilst they were living in the Netherlands, offering reward of ¬£50 (equal to about ¬£ today) for evidence to support the claim, but was unsuccessful. 13th‚Äì19th dukes The 12th Duke died on 28 December 1885 aged 81 outliving both of his sons with no legitimate male heirs and the title passed to his aged unmarried brother Archibald Henry Algernon Seymour (1810‚Äì1891); when he died a few years later, the youngest brother Algernon Percy Banks St. Maur (1813‚Äì1894) became the 14th Duke. Three and a half years later he was dead. His son Algernon Seymour (1846‚Äì1923) became the 15th Duke. He died without children and the title passed to his distant cousin Edward Hamilton Seymour (1860‚Äì1931), great-great-grandson of Lord Francis Seymour, Dean of Wells (1726‚Äì1799), youngest son of the 8th Duke. He was succeeded by his son Evelyn Francis Seymour (1882‚Äì1954) who passed the title on to his son Percy Hamilton Seymour (1910‚Äì1984). The title is currently held by his son John Michael Edward Seymour who was born in 1952. The current heir to the title is Sebastian Seymour, Lord Seymour who was born in 1982.

It is observed on October 9 in South Korea and on January 15 in North Korea. Excluding year 1990 to 2012 where the government maximized business days to expedite industrial growth, Hangul day has been a national holiday in South Korea since 1970.https://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1023264&cid;=50221&categoryId;=50232 Synopsis Every 9 October is selected as Hangeul Day to spread its originality and excellence in addition to commemorating Sejong the King's achievement. Even in 2020, citizens hoist the Korean national flag to honor the day. Hangeul is one of few writing systems where both the founder and founding date have been revealed. To compensate its significance, Korean government legislated the following amendment below. Language Amendment Section 20 (Hangeul Day) 1\\\\. Government shall dictate every October 9 as Hangeul Day with commemorative event in order to spread Hangeul's originality and scientific superiority, further enhancing pan-national awareness and affection towards the language. 2\\\\. Matters regarding commemorative event above shall abide presidential decree. Etymology =South Korea= In South Korea, the holiday is called Hangeul Proclamation Day, or Hangeul Day for short, and is celebrated on October 9 to commemorate the promulgation of the Hunminjeongeum on October 9, 1446. =North Korea= In North Korea, the holiday is called Chos≈èn'g≈≠l Day and is celebrated on January 15 to commemorate the creation of the Hunminjeongeum on January 15, 1444. History Before the creation of Hangul, people in Korea (known as Joseon at the time) primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of characters needed to be learned, there was much difficulty in learning how to write using Chinese characters for the lower classes, who often didn't have the privilege of education. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created the unique alphabet known as Hangul to promote literacy among the common people. According to the Sejong Sillok (ÏÑ∏Ï¢ÖÏã§Î°ù; ‰∏ñÂÆóÂØ¶Á∂†), King Sejong proclaimed publication of Hunmin Jeongeum (ÌõàÎØºÏ†ïÏùå; Ë®ìÊ∞ëÊ≠£Èü≥), the document introducing the newly created alphabet which was also originally called by the same name, in the ninth month of the lunar calendar in 1446. In 1926, the Korean Language Society, whose goal was to preserve the Korean language during a time of rapid forced Japanization, celebrated the octo-sexagesimal (480th) anniversary of the declaration of hangeul on the last day of the ninth month of the lunar calendar, which is on November 4 of the Gregorian calendar. Members of the Society declared it the first observance of \\"Gagyanal\\" (Í∞ÄÍ∞∏ÎÇ†). The name came from \\"Gagyageul\\" (Í∞ÄÍ∞∏Í∏Ä), an early colloquial name for hangeul, based on a mnemonic recitation beginning \\"gagya geogyeo\\" (Í∞ÄÍ∞∏Í±∞Í≤®). The name of the commemorative day was changed to \\"Hangullal\\" in 1928, soon after the term \\"hangul\\", coined originally in 1913 by Ju Si-gyeong, became widely accepted as the new name for the alphabet. The day was then celebrated according to the lunar calendar. In 1931, the celebration of the day was switched to October 29 of the Gregorian Calendar, the calendar which is in contemporary use. Three years later, the date was moved to October 28, to coordinate the date with that of the Julian Calendar, which had been in use during the 15th century, when King Sejong had made his proclamation. The discovery in 1940 of an original copy of the Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye, a volume of commentary to the Hunmin Jeongeum that appeared not long after the document it commented upon, revealed that the Hunmin Jeongeum was announced during the first ten days (sangsun; ÏÉÅÏàú; ‰∏äÊó¨) of the ninth month. The tenth day of the ninth month of the 1446 lunar calendar was equivalent to October 9 of that same year's Julian calendar. The South Korean government, established in 1945, declared October 9 to be Hangeul Day, a yearly legal holiday which excused government employees from work. Major employers pressured the South Korean government to increase the country's annual number of work days. In 1991, to balance out the adoption of the United Nations Day, it vacated Hangeul Day's status as a holiday. By law, Hangeul Day remained a national commemoration day, and the Hangeul Society campaigned for the holiday's restoration. On November 1, 2012, the Society won that campaign, when the National Assembly voted 189 to 4 (with 4 abstaining) in favor of a resolution that called for the return of Hangeul Day as a national holiday. This put pressure on the Lee Myung Bak administration, which applied the change in 2013. Celebrations In 2009, in celebration of the 563rd anniversary of the invention of the Korean alphabet by King Sejong, the 6.2-meter high, 20-ton bronze statue of King Sejong the Great of Joseon at Gwanghwamun Plaza in Seoul, was unveiled to the public.

In addition to being the divinity of contracts, Mithra is also a judicial figure, an all-seeing protector of Truth, and the guardian of cattle, the harvest, and of the Waters. The Romans attributed their Mithraic mysteries (the mystery religion known as Mithraism) to \\"Persian\\" (i.e., Zoroastrian) sources relating to Mithra. Since the early 1970s, the dominant scholarship has noted dissimilarities between the Persian and Roman traditions, making it, at most, the result of Roman perceptions of (Pseudo-)Zoroastrian ideas.Beck, Roger (2002-07-20). \\"Mithraism\\". Encyclopaedia Iranica, Online Edition. Retrieved 2012-09-07. Etymology Together with the Vedic common noun mitra, the Avestan common noun miŒ∏ra derives from Proto-Indo-Iranian *mitr√°m, from the root *mi- \\"to bind\\", with the \\"tool suffix\\" -tra- \\"causing to\\". Thus, etymologically mitra/miŒ∏ra means \\"that which causes binding\\", preserved in the Avestan word for \\"Covenant, Contract, Oath\\". In Middle Iranian languages (Middle Persian, Parthian etc.), miŒ∏ra became mihr, from which New Persian mehr and Armenian mihr/mehr ultimately derive. In scripture Like most other Divinities, Mithra is not mentioned by name in the Gathas, the oldest texts of Zoroastrianism and traditionally attributed to Zoroaster himself, or by name in the Yasna Haptanghaiti, a seven-verse section of the Yasna liturgy that is linguistically as old as the Gathas. As a member of the Iranian ahuric triad, a feature that only Ahura Mazda and Ahura Berezaiti (Apam Napat) also have, Mithra is an exalted figure. Together with Rashnu \\"Justice\\" and Sraosha \\"Obedience\\", Mithra is one of the three judges at the Chinvat Bridge, the \\"Bridge of Separation\\" that all souls must cross. Unlike Sraosha, Mithra is not, however, a psychopomp, a guide of souls to the place of the dead. Should the Good Thoughts, Words, and Deeds outweigh the Bad, Sraosha alone conveys the Soul across the Bridge. As the Divinity of Contract, Mithra is undeceivable, infallible, eternally watchful, and never-resting. Mithra is additionally the protector of cattle, and his stock epithet is \\"of Wide Pastures.\\" He is Guardian of the waters and ensures that those pastures receive enough of it. The lack of Mithra's presence in the texts was once a cause of some consternation amongst Iranians. An often-repeated speculation of the first half of the 20th century was that the lack of any mention (i.e., Zoroaster's silence) of Mithra in these texts implied that Zoroaster had rejected Mithra. This ex silentio speculation is no longer followed. Building on that speculation was another series of speculations, which postulated that the reason why Zoroaster did not mention Mithra was that the latter was the supreme god of a bloodthirsty group of daeva-worshipers that Zoroaster condemned. However, \\"no satisfactory evidence has yet been adduced to show that, before Zoroaster, the concept of a supreme god existed among the Iranians, or that among them Mithra ‚Äì or any other divinity ‚Äì ever enjoyed a separate cult of his or her own outside either their ancient or their Zoroastrian pantheons.\\". The Avestan Hymn to Mithra (Yacht 10) is the longest, and one of the best-preserved, of the Yashts. Mithra is described in the Zoroastrian Avesta scriptures as \\"Mithra of Wide Pastures, of the Thousand Ears, and of the Myriad Eyes,\\" (Yandasna 1:3), \\"the Lofty, and the Everlasting... the Province Ruler,\\"(Yasna 1:11), \\"the Yazad (Divinity) of the Spoken Name\\" (Yasna 3:5), and \\"the Holy,\\" (Yasna 3:13). The Khorda Avesta (Book of Common Prayer) also refer to Mithra in the Litany to the Sun, \\"Homage to Mithra of Wide Cattle Pastures,\\" (Khwarshed Niyayesh 5), \\"Whose Word is True, who is of the Assembly, Who has a Thousand Ears, the Well-Shaped One, Who has Ten Thousand Eyes, the Exalted One, Who has Wide Knowledge, the Helpful One, Who Sleeps Not, the Ever Wakeful. We sacrifice to Mithra, The Lord of all countries, Whom Ahura Mazda created the most glorious, Of the Supernatural Yazads. So may there come to us for Aid, Both Mithra and Ahura, the Two Exalted Ones,\\"(Khwarshed Niyayesh 6-7), \\"I shall sacrifice to his mace, well-aimed against the Skulls of the Daevas\\" (Khwarshed Niyayesh 15). Some recent theories have claimed Mithra represents the Sun itself, but the Khorda Avesta refers to the Sun as a separate entity ‚Äì as it does with the Moon, with which the Sun has \\"the Best of Friendships,\\" (Khwarshed Niyayesh 15). In inscriptions Although there is no known Mithraic iconography in the Achaemenid period, the deity is invoked in several royal Achaemenid inscriptions: In Artaxerxes II's (r. 404 ‚Äì 358 B.C.) trilingual (Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian) inscription at Susa (A2Sa) and Hamadan (A2Hc), which have the same text, the emperor appeals to \\"Ahuramazda, Anahita, and Mithra protect me against all evil,\\" and in which he beseeches them to protect what he has built. Although the Behistun inscription of Darius I (r. 522 ‚Äì 486 B.C.) invokes Ahuramazda and \\"the Other Gods who are\\", this inscription of Artaxerxes II is remarkable as no Achaemenid king before him had invoked any but Ahura Mazda alone by name. Boyce suggests that the reason for this was that Artaxerxes had chosen Anahita and Mithra as his patron/protector Divinities. Mithra has invoked again in the single known inscription of Artaxerxes III, A3Pa, found at Persepolis. In that inscription, that emperor to appeals to \\"Ahuramazda and the God Mithra preserve me, my country, and what has been built by me.\\" In tradition Coin of Artabanus II of Parthia (c. 128‚Äì124 BC). The Hellenistic depiction on the reverse shows the king kneeling before an Apollo-like god, which is thought to be Mithra.Franz Grenet, \\"MITHRA ii. ICONOGRAPHY IN IRAN AND CENTRAL ASIA\\", Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, online edition, 2016, available at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mithra-2-iconography-in-iran-and- central-asia (accessed on 19 May 2016). A marble relief of the tauroctony in later Roman Mithraism, II-III century AD Investiture of Sassanid emperor Ardashir II (3rd century CE bas-relief at Taq-e Bostan, Iran. On the left stands the yazata Mithra with raised barsom, sanctifying the investiture. In the Zoroastrian calendar, the sixteenth day of the month and the seventh month of the year are dedicated to and are under the protection of Mithra. The Iranian civil calendar of 1925 adopted Zoroastrian month-names, and as such also has the seventh month of the year named \\"Mihr\\". The position of the sixteenth day and seventh month reflects Mithra's rank in the hierarchy of the Divinities; the sixteenth day and seventh month are respectively the first day of the second half of the month and the first month of the second half of the year. The day on which the day-name and month-name dedications intersect is (like all other such intersections) dedicated to the divinity of that day/month, and is celebrated with a Jashan (from Avestan Yasna, \\"Worship\\") in honor of that Divinity. In the case of Mithra, this was Jashan-e Mihragan, or just Mihragan for short. In Zoroastrian scripture, Mithra is distinct from the divinity of the Sun, Hvare-khshaeta (literally \\"Radiant Sun\\", whence also Middle Persian Khorshed for the Sun). However, in Zoroastrian tradition, Mithra evolved from being an all-seeing figure (hence vaguely associated with the Sun) into a divinity co-identified with the Sun itself, effectively taking over Hvare-khshaeta's role. How or when or why this occurred is uncertain, but it is commonly attributed to conflation with Babylonian Shamash and/or Greek Apollo, with whom Mithra shares other characteristics (e.g. a judicial function). This characteristic is part of Mithra's Indo inheritance since the Indic Rigveda have solar divinities that are not distinct from Mithra/Mitra, and in the Atharvaveda, Mitra is associated with sunrise, Sun Salutation is a daily yogic activity worldwide even in current times and is preceded by chanting 'OM Mitraya Namaha' as 'Mitraya'http://www.harekrsna.de/surya/surya- names.htm is one of the 108 Names for Lord Surya/Sun God. Royal names incorporating Mithra's (e.g., \\"Mithradates\\") appear in the dynasties of Parthia, Armenia, and in Anatolia, in Pontus and Cappadocia. The youthful Apollonian-type Mithra is found in images from other countries of Iranian culture in the Parthian period, such as Commagene in the Roman-Parthian border and the Kushan Empire on the Indo-Iranian border. In Manichaeism Persian and Parthian-speaking Manichaeans used the name of Mithra current in their time (Mihryazd, q.e. Mithra-yazata) for two different Manichaean angels. # The first, called Mihryazd by the Persians, was the \\"Living Spirit\\" (Aramaic r≈´·∏•ƒÅ ·∏•ayyƒÅ), a savior-figure who rescues the \\"First Man\\" from the demonic Darkness into which he had plunged. # The second, known as Mihr or Mihr Yazd among the Parthians, is the \\"Messenger\\" (Aramaic ƒ´zgaddƒÅ), likewise a savior figure, but one concerned with setting up the structures to liberate the Light lost when the First Man had been defeated. The second figure mentioned above, the Third Messenger, was the helper and redeemer of mankind, and identified with another Zoroastrian divinity, Narisaf (derived from Pahlavi Narsƒìh from Avestan Nairy≈ç.sa»µh≈ç, meaning 'Potent Utterance', the name of a Yazata). Citing Boyce,Boyce, Mary. (1962) On Mithra in the Manichaean Pantheon. In Sundermann remarks, \\"It was among the Parthian Manicheans that Mithra as a Sun God surpassed the importance of Narisaf as the common Iranian image of the Third Messenger; among the Parthians the dominance of Mithra was such that his identification with the Third Messenger led to cultic emphasis on the Mithraic traits in the Manichaean God.\\" Unrelated to these Mihrs are Parthian and Sogdian Mytr or Mytrg. Although sharing linguistic roots with the name Mithra, Werner Sundermann established that those names denote Manicheanisms equivalent of Maitreya.

There are several interpretations of this main theory, some scholars see it as a kind of Idealism while others argue that it is closer to a kind of phenomenology or representationalism.

Wonhyo's Reliance on Huiyuan in his Exposition of the Two Hindrances. (Published in Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism. Imre Hamar, ed., Harrassowitz Verlag, 2007, p. 281-295.) Source: (accessed: April 7, 2010) =The doctrine of Vij√±apti-mƒÅtra= One of the main features of YogƒÅcƒÅra philosophy is the concept of vij√±apti-mƒÅtra. According to Lambert Schmithausen, the earliest surviving appearance of this term is in chapter 8 of the Sa·πÖdhinirmocana S≈´tra, which unfortunately, has only survived in Tibetan and Chinese translations that differ in syntax and meaning.Schmithausen, Lambert, The Genesis of YogƒÅcƒÅra-Vij√±ƒÅnavƒÅda: Responses and Reflections, Tokyo, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, 2014, p. 387. The passage is depicted as a response by the Buddha to a question which asks \\"whether the images or replicas (*pratibimba) which are the object (*gocara) of meditative concentration (*samadhi), are different/separate (*bhinna) from the contemplating mind (*citta) or not.\\" The Buddha says they are not different, \\"Because these images are vij√±apti-mƒÅtra.\\" The text goes on to affirm that the same is true for objects of ordinary perception.Schmithausen, Lambert, The Genesis of YogƒÅcƒÅra-Vij√±ƒÅnavƒÅda: Responses and Reflections, Tokyo, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, 2014, p. 391. Regarding existing Sanskrit sources, the term appears in the first verse of Vasubandhu's Vim≈õatikƒÅ, which is a locus classicus of the idea, it states:Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. 149. > Vij√±aptimƒÅtram evaitad asad arthƒÅvabhƒÅsanƒÅt yathƒÅ taimirikasyƒÅsat ke≈õa > candrƒÅdi dar≈õanam. \\"This [world] is vij√±aptimƒÅtra, since it manifests itself > as an unreal object (artha), just like the case of those with cataracts > seeing unreal hairs in the moon and the like.\\" According to Mark Siderits, what Vasubandhu means here is that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions which manifest themselves as external objects, but \\"there is actually no such thing outside the mind.\\" The term also appears in Asa·πÖga's classic YogƒÅcƒÅra work, the MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha (no Sanskrit original, trans. from Tibetan): > These representations (vij√±apti) are mere representations (vij√±apti-mƒÅtra), > because there is no [corresponding] thing/object (artha)...Just as in a > dream there appear, even without a thing/object (artha), just in the mind > alone, forms/images of all kinds of things/objects like visibles, sounds, > smells, tastes, tangibles, houses, forests, land, and mountains, and yet > there are no [such] things/objects at all in that [place]. MSg > II.6Schmithausen, Lambert, The Genesis of YogƒÅcƒÅra-Vij√±ƒÅnavƒÅda: Responses > and Reflections, Tokyo, The International Institute for Buddhist Studies, > 2014, p. 389. The term is sometimes used as a synonym with citta-mƒÅtra (mere citta), which is also used as a name for the school that suggests Idealism. Schmithausen writes that the first appearance of this term is in the Pratyupanna samadhi sutra, which states: > This (or: whatever belongs to this) triple world (*traidhƒÅtuka) is nothing > but mind (or thought: *cittamatra). Why? Because however I imagine things, > that is how they appear.Schmithausen, Lambert, The Genesis of YogƒÅcƒÅra- > Vij√±ƒÅnavƒÅda: Responses and Reflections, Tokyo, The International Institute > for Buddhist Studies, 2014, p. 598. >  Interpretations of this doctrine  Some modern scholars believe it is a mistake to conflate the two terms, however. David Kalupahana argues that citta-mƒÅtra signifies a metaphysical reification of mind into an absolute, while vij√±apti-mƒÅtra refers to a certain epistemological approach.Kalupahana 1992, pp. 122, 126, 136. While the standard translations for these terms are often \\"consciousness only\\" and \\"mind-only\\" (signifying an Idealistic doctrine), several modern scholars object to these, as well as to Idealistic interpretation. According to Bruce Cameron Hall, the interpretation of this doctrine as a form of subjective or absolute idealism has been \\"the most common \\"outside\\" interpretation of Vij√±ƒÅnavƒÅda, not only by modern writers, but by its ancient opponents, both Hindu and Buddhist.\\"Cameron Hall, Bruce, The Meaning of Vijnapti in Vasubandhu's Concept of Mind, JIABS Vol 9, 1986, Number 1, p. 7. Different alternative translations for vij√±apti-mƒÅtra have been proposed, such as representation-only, ideation-only, impressions-only and perception-only.Wayman, Alex, A Defense of YogƒÅcƒÅra Buddhism, Philosophy East and West, Vol. 46, No. 4 (Oct., 1996), pp. 447-476. Alex Wayman notes that one's interpretation of YogƒÅcƒÅra will depend on how the qualifier mƒÅtra is to be understood in this context, and he objects to interpretations which claim that YogƒÅcƒÅra rejects the external world altogether, preferring translations such as \\"amounting to mind\\" or \\"mirroring mind\\" for citta-mƒÅtra. For Wayman, what this doctrine means is that \\"the mind has only a report or representation of what the sense organ had sensed.\\" The representationalist interpretation is also supported by Stefan Anacker and Thomas A. Kochumuttom, modern translators of Vasubandhu's works.Vasubandhu (author), Stefan Anacker (translator, annotator) (1984). Seven works of Vasubandhu, the Buddhist psychological doctor. Issue 4 of Religions of Asia series. Motilal Banarsidass Publ. . Source: [1] (accessed: Wednesday April 21, 2010), p.159 According to Thomas Kochumuttom, YogƒÅcƒÅra is a realistic pluralism. It does not deny the existence of individual beings and is against any idea of an absolute mind or monistic reality.Kochumuttom, 1999, p. 1. Other scholars such as Saam Trivedi argue that YogƒÅcƒÅra is similar to Idealism (closer to a Kantian epistemic idealism), though they note that it is its own unique form and that it might be confusing to categorize it as such.Saam Trivedi, Idealism and Yogacara Buddhism, Asian Philosophy Volume 15, 2005 - Issue 3 Pages 231-246. Paul Williams, citing Griffiths, writes that it could be termed \\"dynamic idealism\\".Williams 2008, p. 94. Sean Butler argues for the idealistic nature of YogƒÅcƒÅra, noting that there are numerous similarities between YogƒÅcƒÅra and the systems of Kant and Berkeley.Butler, Sean, Idealism in YogƒÅcƒÅra Buddhism, The Hilltop Review Volume 4 Issue 1 Spring 2010, Jay Garfield also argues that YogƒÅcƒÅra is \\"akin to the idealisms defended by such Western philosophers as Berkeley, Kant and Schopenhauer.\\"Garfield, Jay L. Vasubandhu's treatise on the three natures translated from the Tibetan edition with a commentary, Asian Philosophy, Volume 7, 1997, Issue 2, pp. 133-154. However, according to Dan Lusthaus, the vij√±apti-mƒÅtra theory is closer in some ways to Western Phenomenological theories and Epistemological Idealism or Transcendental idealism, but it is not an ontological idealism because YogƒÅcƒÅra rejects the construction of metaphysical or ontological theories.Lusthaus, Dan, What is and isn't Yogacara, http://www.acmuller.net/yogacara/articles/intro.html Moreover, Western idealism lacks any counterpart to karma, samsara or awakening, which are central for YogƒÅcƒÅra. Regarding vij√±apti-mƒÅtra, Lusthaus translates it as \\"nothing but conscious construction\\" and states it is: > A deceptive trick is built into the way consciousness operates at every > moment. Consciousness projects and constructs a cognitive object in such a > way that it disowns its own creation - pretending the object is \\"out there\\" > - in order to render that object capable of being appropriated. Even while > what we cognize is occurring within our act of cognition, we cognize it as > if it were external to our consciousness. Realization of vij√±apti-mƒÅtra > exposes this trick intrinsic to consciousness's workings, thereby > eliminating it. When that deception is removed one's mode of cognition is no > longer termed vij√±ƒÅna (consciousness); it has become direct cognition > (j√±ƒÅna) (see above). Consciousness engages in this deceptive game of > projection, dissociation, and appropriation because there is no \\"self.\\" > According to Buddhism, the deepest, most pernicious erroneous view held by > sentient beings is the view that a permanent, eternal, immutable, > independent self exists. There is no such self, and deep down we know that. > This makes us anxious, since it entails that no self or identity endures > forever. In order to assuage that anxiety, we attempt to construct a self, > to fill the anxious void, to do something enduring. The projection of > cognitive objects for appropriation is consciousness's main tool for this > construction. If I own things (ideas, theories, identities, material > objects), then \\"I am.\\" If there are eternal objects that I can possess, then > I too must be eternal. To undermine this desperate and erroneous > appropriative grasping, YogƒÅcƒÅra texts say: Negate the object, and the self > is also negated (e.g., MadhyƒÅnta-vibhƒÅga, 1:4, 8). Therefore, when YogƒÅcƒÅra discusses cognitive objects (vi·π£aya), they are analyzing cognition, not positing or denying metaphysical entities. While YogƒÅcƒÅra posits that cognitive objects are real, it denies \\"arthas\\" (objects of intentionality or \\"a telos toward which an act of consciousness intends\\") which are \\"outside the cognitive act in which it is that which is intended.\\" So according to Lusthaus, \\"Yogacarins don't claim that nothing whatsoever exists outside the mind\\" and \\"Consciousness enjoys no transcendent status, nor does it serve as a metaphysical foundation. Consciousness is real by virtue of its facticity -- the fact that sentient beings experience cognitions -- and not because of an ontological primacy.\\" In this way, instead of offering an ontological theory, YogƒÅcƒÅra focuses on understanding and eliminating the underlying tendencies (anu≈õaya) that lead to clinging to ontological constructions, which are just cognitive projections (pratibimba, parikalpita). Jonathan Gold writes that the YogƒÅcƒÅra thinker Vasubandhu can be said to be an idealist (similar to Kant), in the sense that for him, everything in experience as well as its causal support is mental, and thus he gives causal priority to the mental. At the same time however, this is only in the conventional realm, since \\"mind\\" is just another concept and true reality for Vasubandhu is ineffable, \\"an inconceivable ‚Äúthusness‚Äù (tathatƒÅ).\\" Indeed, the Vim≈õatikƒÅ states that the very idea of vij√±apti-mƒÅtra must also be understood to be itself a self-less construction and thus vij√±apti-mƒÅtra is not the ultimate truth (paramƒÅrtha-satya) in YogƒÅcƒÅra. Thus according to Gold, while Vasubandhu's vij√±apti-mƒÅtra can be said to be a ‚Äúconventionalist idealism‚Äù, it is to be seen as unique and different from Western forms, especially Hegelian Absolute Idealism.  Arguments in defense of this doctrine  YogƒÅcƒÅra philosophers were aware of the objections that could be brought against their doctrine. Vasubandhu's Vim≈õatikƒÅ mentions three and refutes them:Williams, 2008, pp. 94-95.Fernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti, Being as Consciousness: YogƒÅcƒÅra Philosophy of Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2004, p xxiv.Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, pp. 150-151. # The problem of spatio-temporal determination or non-arbitrariness in regard to place and time. There must be some external basis for our experiences since experiences of any particular object are not occurrent everywhere and at every time. Vasubandhu explains this by using the dream argument, which shows how a world created by mind can still seem to have spatio-temporal localization. # The problem of multiple minds experiencing the same object or inter-subjective agreement. Vasubandhu counters that mass hallucinations (such as those said to occur to hungry ghosts) caused by the fact they share similar karma, show that inter-subjective agreement is possible without positing real external objects. # Hallucinations have no pragmatic results, efficacy or causal functions and thus can be determined to be unreal, but entities we generally accept as being \\"real\\" have actual causal results that cannot be of the same class as hallucinations. Against this claim, Vasubandhu argues that waking life is the same as in a dream, where objects have pragmatic results within the very rules of the dream. He also uses the example of a wet dream to show that mental content can have causal efficacy outside of a dream. According to Mark Siderits, after disposing of these objections, Vasubandhu believes he has shown that vij√±apti-mƒÅtra is just as good at explaining and predicting the relevant phenomena of experience as any theory of realism that posits external objects. Therefore, he then applies the Indian philosophical principle termed the \\"Principle of Lightness\\" (which is similar to Occam's Razor) to rule out realism since vij√±apti-mƒÅtra is the simpler and \\"lighter\\" theory, \\"that is, the theory that posits the least number of unobservable entities.\\"Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. 157. Another objection that Vasubandhu answers is that of how one person can influence another's experiences, if everything arises from mental karmic seeds in one's mind stream. Vasubandhu argues that \\"impressions can also be caused in a mental stream by the occurrence of a distinct impression in another suitably linked mental stream.\\"Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. 170. As Siderits notes, this account can explain how it is possible to influence or even totally disrupt (murder) another mind, even if there is no physical medium or object in existence, since a suitably strong enough intention in one mind stream can have effects on another mind stream. From the vij√±apti-mƒÅtra position, it is easier to posit a mind to mind causation than to have to explain mind to body causation, which the realist must do. However, Siderits then goes on to question whether Vasubandhu's position is indeed \\"lighter\\" since he must make use of multiple interactions between different minds to take into account an intentionally created artifact, like a pot. Since we can be aware of a pot even when we are not \\"linked\\" to the potter's intentions (even after the potter is dead), a more complex series of mental interactions must be posited.Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. 173. In disproving the possibility of external objects, Vasubandhu's Vim≈õatikƒÅ also attacks Indian theories of atomism and property particulars as incoherent on mereological grounds.Gold, Jonathan C., \\"Vasubandhu\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2018 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/vasubandhu/ Vasubandhu also explains why it is soteriologically important to get rid of the idea of really existing external objects. According to Siderits, this is because: > When we wrongly imagine there to be external objects we are led to think in > terms of the duality of 'grasped and grasper', of what is 'out there' and > what is ' in here' - in short, of external world and self. Coming to see > that there is no external world is a means, Vasubandhu thinks, of overcoming > a very subtle way of believing in an 'I'... once we see why physical objects > can't exist we will lose all temptation to think there is a true ' me' > within. There are really just impressions, but we superimpose on these the > false constructions of object and subject. Seeing this will free us from the > false conception of an 'I'.Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. > 175. Siderits notes how Kant had a similar notion, that is, without the idea of an objective mind independent world, one cannot arrive the concept of a subjective \\"I\\". But Kant drew the opposite conclusion to Vasubandhu, since he held that we must believe in an enduring subject, and thus, also believe in external objects. = Karma = An explanation of the Buddhist doctrine of karma (action) is central to YogƒÅcƒÅra, and the school sought to explain important questions such as how moral actions can have effects on individuals long after that action was done, that is, how karmic causality works across temporal distances. Previous Abhidharma Buddhist schools like the Sautrantika had developed theories of karma based on the notion of \\"seeds\\" (bƒ´jƒÅ) in the mind stream, which are unseen karmic habits (good and bad) which remain until they meet with the necessary conditions to manifest. YogƒÅcƒÅra adopts and expanded this theory. YogƒÅcƒÅra then posited the \\"storehouse consciousness\\" (Sanskrit: ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna), also known as the basal, or eighth consciousness, as the container of the seeds. It simultaneously acts as a storage place for karmic latencies and as a fertile matrix of predispositions that bring karma to a state of fruition. In the YogƒÅcƒÅra system, all experience without exception is said to result from karma or mental intention (cetana), either arising from one's own subliminal seeds or from other minds. For YogƒÅcƒÅra, the seemingly external or dualistic world is merely a \\"by-product\\" (adhipati- phala) of karma. The term vƒÅsanƒÅ (\\"perfuming\\") is also used when explaining karma, and YogƒÅcƒÅrins were divided on the issue of whether vƒÅsƒÅna and bija were essentially the same, whether the seeds were the effect of the perfuming, or whether the perfuming simply affected the seeds. The type, quantity, quality and strength of the seeds determine where and how a sentient being will be reborn: one's race, sex, social status, proclivities, bodily appearance and so forth. The conditioning of the mind resulting from karma is called sa·πÉskƒÅra. Vasubandhu's Treatise on Action (Karmasiddhiprakara·πáa), treats the subject of karma in detail from the YogƒÅcƒÅra perspective.Karmasiddhiprakarana: The Treatise on Action by Vasubandhu. translated by Etienne Lamotte and Leo M. Pruden. Asian Humanities Press: 2001 . pg 13, 35 =Analysis of Consciousness= YogƒÅcƒÅra gives a detailed explanation of the workings of the mind and the way it constructs the reality we experience. According to Lusthaus, \\"the most famous innovation of the YogƒÅcƒÅra school was the doctrine of eight consciousnesses.\\" These \\"eight bodies of consciousnesses\\" (a·π£·π≠a vij√±ƒÅnakƒÅyƒÅ·∏•) are: the five sense- consciousnesses, citta (mentality), manas (self-consciousness), and the storehouse or substratum consciousness (Skt: ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna).Williams, 2008, p. 97. Traditional Buddhist descriptions of consciousness taught just the first six vij√±ƒÅnas, each corresponding to a sense base (ayatana) and having their own sense objects. Standard Buddhist doctrine held that these eighteen \\"dhatus\\" or components of experience, \\"exhaust the full extent of everything in the universe, or more accurately, the sensorium.\\" These six consciousnesses are also not substantial entities, but a series of events, arising and vanishing, stretching back from beginningless (anadi) time.Fernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti, Being as Consciousness: YogƒÅcƒÅra Philosophy of Buddhism, Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2004, p xxv. Buddhist Abhidharma expanded and developed this basic model and YogƒÅcƒÅra responded by rearranging these into their own schema which had three novel forms of consciousness. The sixth consciousness, mano-vij√±ƒÅna, was seen as the surveyor of the content of the five senses as well as of mental content like thoughts and ideas. The seventh consciousness developed from the early Buddhist concept of manas, and was seen as the defiled mentation (kli·π£·π≠a-manas) which is obsessed with notions of \\"self\\". According to Paul Williams, this consciousness \\"takes the substratum consciousness as its object and mistakenly considers the substratum consciousness to be a true Self.\\" The eighth consciousness, ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna (storehouse or repository consciousness), was defined as the storehouse of all karmic seeds, where they gradually matured until ripe, at which point they manifested as karmic consequences. Because of this, it is also called the \\"mind which has all the seeds\\" (sarvabƒ´jakam cittam), as well as the \\"basic consciousness\\" (m≈´la-vij√±ƒÅna) and the \\"appropriating consciousness\\" (adanavij√±ana). According to the Sa·πÖdhinirmocana S≈´tra, this kind of consciousness underlies and supports the six types of manifest awareness, all of which occur simultaneously with the ƒÅlaya.Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vij√±ana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, pp 94-95. William S. Waldron sees this \\"simultaneity of all the modes of cognitive awareness\\" as the most significant departure of YogƒÅcƒÅra theory from traditional Buddhist models of vij√±ƒÅna, which were \\"thought to occur solely in conjunction with their respective sense bases and epistemic objects.\\"Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vij√±ana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, p 97. The ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna is also what experiences rebirth into future lives and what descents into the womb to appropriate the fetal material. Therefore, the ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna's holding on to the body's sense faculties and \\"profuse imaginings\\" (prapa√±ca) are the two appropriations which make up the \\"kindling\\" or \\"fuel\\" (lit. upƒÅdƒÅna) that samsaric existence depends upon. YogƒÅcƒÅra thought thus holds that being unaware of the processes going on in the ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna is an important element of ignorance (avidya). The ƒÅlaya is also individual, so that each person has their own ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna, which is an ever changing process and therefore not a permanent self. According to Williams, this consciousness \\"seen as a defiled form of consciousness (or perhaps sub- or unconsciousness), is personal, individual, continually changing and yet serving to give a degree of personal identity and to explain why it is that certain karmic results pertain to this particular individual. The seeds are momentary, but they give rise to a perfumed series which eventually culminates in the result including, from seeds of a particular type, the whole ‚Äòinter-subjective‚Äô phenomenal world.\\"Williams, 2008, pp. 97-98. Also, Asanga and Vasubandhu write that the ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna ‚Äòceases‚Äô at awakening, becoming transformed into a pure consciousness.Williams, 2008, pp. 98-99. According to Waldron, while there were various similar concepts in other Buddhist Abhidharma schools which sought to explain karmic continuity, the ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna is the most comprehensive and systematic.Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vij√±ana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 131. Waldron notes that the ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna concept was probably influenced by these theories, particularly the Sautrantika theory of seeds and Vasumitra's theory of a subtle form of mind (suksma-citta).Waldron, William S. The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vij√±ana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought. Routledge Critical Studies in Buddhism, 2003, page 93. However, for Kalupahana, this classification of ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna and manas as an eighth and seventh category of consciousness is based on a misunderstanding of Vasubandhu's Tri·πÉ≈õikaikƒÅ-kƒÅrikƒÅ by later adherents. Instead referring to separate consciousnesses, Kalupahana interprets these terms as referring to a function or transformation of consciousness. These transformations are threefold according to Kalupahana. The first is the ƒÅlaya and its seeds, which is the flow or stream of consciousness, without any of the usual projections on top of it. The second transformation is manana, self-consciousness or \\"Self-view, self-confusion, self-esteem and self-love\\". It is \\"thinking\\" about the various perceptions occurring in the stream of consciousness\\". The ƒÅlaya is defiled by this self- interest. The third transformation is visaya-vij√±apti, the \\"concept of the object\\". In this transformation the concept of objects is created. By creating these concepts human beings become \\"susceptible to grasping after the object\\" as if it were a real object (sad artha) even though it is just a conception (vij√±apti). A similar perspective which emphasizes YogƒÅcƒÅra's continuity with early Buddhism is given by Walpola Rahula. According to Rahula, all the elements of this theory of consciousness with its three layers of Vij√±ƒÅna are already found in the PƒÅli Canon:Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, Buddhist and Freudian Psychology. Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66. = The Three Natures and Emptiness = YogƒÅcƒÅra works often define three basic modes or \\"natures\\" (svabhƒÅva) of experience. Jonathan Gold explains that \\"the three natures are all one reality viewed from three distinct angles. They are the appearance, the process, and the emptiness of that same apparent entity.\\" According to Paul Williams, \\"all things which can be known can be subsumed under these Three Natures.\\" Since this schema is YogƒÅcƒÅra's systematic explanation of the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness (≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ), each of the three natures are also explained as having a lack of own-nature (ni·∏•svabhƒÅvatƒÅ).\\"Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. 176. Vasubandhu's TrisvabhƒÅva-nirde≈õa gives a brief definition of these three natures: > \\"What appears is the dependent. How it appears is the fabricated. Because of > being dependent on conditions. Because of being only fabrication. The > eternal non-existence of the appearance as it is appears: That is known to > be the perfected nature, because of being always the same. What appears > there? The unreal fabrication. How does it appear? As a dual self. What is > its nonexistence? That by which the nondual reality is there.\\" In detail, three natures (trisvabhƒÅva) are:Williams (2008), p. 90.Peter Lunde Johnson, Xuanzang, On There Only Being the Virtual Nature of Consciousness, 2019, p. 470.Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, pp. 177-178. #Parikalpita-svabhƒÅva (the \\"fully conceptualized\\" nature). This is the \\"imaginary\\" or \\"constructed\\" nature, wherein things are incorrectly comprehended based on conceptual construction, through the activity of language and through attachment and erroneous discrimination which attributes intrinsic existence to things. According to the MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha, it also refers to the appearance of things in terms of subject-object dualism (literally \\"grasper\\" and \\"grasped\\"). The conceptualized nature is the world of everyday unenlightened people, i.e. samsara, and it is false and empty, it does not really exist (see Tri·πÉ≈õikƒÅ v. 20). According to Xuanzang's Cheng Weishi Lun, \\"there is the absence of an existential nature by its very defining characteristic\\" (lak·π£ana-ni·∏•svabhƒÅvatƒÅ). Because these conceptualized natures and distinct characteristics (lak·π£ana) are wrongly imputed not truly real, \\"they are like mirages and blossoms in the sky.\\" #Paratantra-svabhƒÅva (literally, \\"other dependent\\"), which is the dependently originated nature of dharmas, or the causal flow of phenomena which is erroneously confused into the conceptualized nature. According to Williams, it is \\"the basis for the erroneous partition into supposedly intrinsically existing subjects and objects which marks the conceptualized nature.\\" Jonathan Gold writes that it is \\"the causal process of the thing‚Äôs fabrication, the causal story that brings about the thing‚Äôs apparent nature.\\" This basis is considered to be an ultimately existing (paramƒÅrtha) basis in classical YogƒÅcƒÅra (see MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha, 2:25).Williams (2008), pp. 90-91. However, as Xuanzang notes, this nature is also empty in that there is an \\"absence of an existential nature in conditions that arise and perish\\" (utpatti- ni·∏•svabhƒÅvatƒÅ). That is, the events in this causal flow, while \\"seeming to have real existence of their own\\" are actually like magical illusions since \\"they are said to only be hypothetical and not really exist on their own.\\" As Siderits writes \\"to the extent that we are thinking of it at all - even if only as the non-dual flow of impressions-only - we are still conceptualizing it.\\" #Parini·π£panna-svabhƒÅva (literally, \\"fully accomplished\\"): the \\"consummated nature\\" or the true nature of things, the experience of Suchness or Thatness (TathƒÅtƒÅ) discovered in meditation unaffected by conceptualization or language. It is defined as \\"the complete absence, in the dependent nature, of objects ‚Äì that is, the objects of the conceptualized nature\\" (see MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha, 2:4). What this refers to is that empty non-dual experience which has been stripped of the duality of the constructed nature through yogic praxis. According to Williams, this is \\"what has to be known for enlightenment\\" and Siderits defines it as \\"just pure seeing without any attempt at conceptualization or interpretation. Now this is also empty, but only of itself as an interpretation. That is, this mode of cognition is devoid of all concepts, and so is empty of being of the nature of the perfected. About it nothing can be said or thought, it is just pure immediacy.\\" According to Xuanzang, it has the \\"absence of any existential nature of ultimate meaning\\" (paramƒÅrtha-ni·∏•svabhƒÅvatƒÅ) since it is \\"completely free from any clinging to entirely imagined speculations about its identity or purpose. Because of this, it is conventionally said that it does not exist. However, it is also not entirely without a real existence.\\" The central meaning of emptiness in YogƒÅcƒÅra is a twofold \\"absence of duality.\\" The first element of this is the unreality of any conceptual duality such as \\"physical\\" and \\"non- physical\\", \\"self\\" and \\"other\\". To define something conceptually is to divide the world into what it is and what it is not, but the world is a causal flux that does not accord with conceptual constructs. The second element of this is a perceptual duality between the sensorium and its objects, between what is \\"external\\" and \\"internal\\", between subject (grƒÅhaka, literally \\"grasper\\") and object (grƒÅhya, \\"grasped\\").Skilton, Andrew (1994).

Windhorse Publications, London:. pg 124 This is also an unreal superimposition, since there is really no such separation of inner and outer, but an interconnected causal stream of mentality which is falsely divided up. An important difference between the YogƒÅcƒÅra conception of emptiness and the Madhyamaka conception is that in classical YogƒÅcƒÅra, emptiness does exist and so does consciousness, while Madhyamaka refuses to endorse such existential statements. The MadhyƒÅntavibhƒÅga for example, states \\"there exists the imagination of the unreal (abh≈´ta-parikalpa), there is no duality, but there is emptiness, even in this there is that,\\" which indicates that even though the dualistic imagination is unreal and empty, it does exist.King, Richard, Early YogƒÅcƒÅra and its Relationship with the Madhyamaka School, Philosophy East & West Volume 44, Number 4 October 1994 pp. 659-683. Contra Madhyamaka, which was criticized by Vasubandhu and Asa·πÖga for being nihilistic (see Vim≈õatikƒÅ v. 10), the YogƒÅcƒÅra position is that there is something that exists (the paratantra-svabhƒÅva that is mere vij√±apti), and that it is empty. The Bodhisattvabh≈´mi likewise argues that it is only logical to speak of emptiness if there is something (ie. dharmatƒÅ) that is empty. Thus Asa·πÖga speaks of emptiness as \\"the non-existence of the self, and the existence of the no- self.\\" The YogƒÅcƒÅra school also gave special significance to the Lesser Discourse on Emptiness of the ƒÄgamas.Gadjin M. Nagao, Madhyamika and Yogachara. Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, page 53. It is often quoted in later YogƒÅcƒÅra texts as a true definition of emptiness.Gadjin M. Nagao, Madhyamika and Yogacara. Leslie S. Kawamura, translator, SUNY Press, Albany 1991, page 200. =Meditation and awakening= As the name of the school suggests, meditation practice is central to the YogƒÅcƒÅra tradition. Practice manuals prescribe the practice of mindfulness of body, feelings, thoughts and dharmas in oneself and others, out of which a revolutionary and radically transformative understanding of the non-duality of self and other is said to arise. This process is referred to as ƒÅ≈õraya- parƒÅv·πõtti, \\"overturning the Cognitive Basis\\", or \\"revolution of the basis\\", which refers to \\"overturning the conceptual projections and imaginings which act as the base of our cognitive actions.\\" This event is seen as the transformation of the basic mode of cognition into j√±ƒÅna (knowledge, direct knowing), which is seen as a non-dual knowledge that is non-conceptual (nirvikalpa), i.e., \\"devoid of interpretive overlay\\".Williams, 2008, p. 95. When this occurs, the eight consciousnesses come to an end and are replaced by direct knowings. According to Lusthaus: > Overturning the Basis turns the five sense consciousnesses into immediate > cognitions that accomplish what needs to be done (k·πõtyƒÅnu·π£·π≠hƒÅna-j√±ƒÅna). The > sixth consciousness becomes immediate cognitive mastery (pratyavek·π£a·πáa- > j√±ƒÅna), in which the general and particular characteristics of things are > discerned just as they are. This discernment is considered nonconceptual > (nirvikalpa-j√±ƒÅna). Manas becomes the immediate cognition of equality > (samatƒÅ-j√±ƒÅna), equalizing self and other. When the Warehouse Consciousness > finally ceases it is replaced by the Great Mirror Cognition (MahƒÅdar≈õa- > j√±ƒÅna) that sees and reflects things just as they are, impartially, without > exclusion, prejudice, anticipation, attachment, or distortion. The grasper- > grasped relation has ceased. ...\\"purified\\" cognitions all engage the world > in immediate and effective ways by removing the self-bias, prejudice, and > obstructions that had prevented one previously from perceiving beyond one's > own narcissistic consciousness. When consciousness ends, true knowledge > begins. Since enlightened cognition is nonconceptual its objects cannot be > described. =Five Categories of Beings= One of the more controversial teachings espoused by the Yogacara school was an extension of the teachings on seeds and store-conscious. Based on the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra and the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, the Yogacara school posited that sentient beings had innate seeds that would make them capable of achieving a particular state of enlightenment and no other. Thus, beings were categorized in 5 ways: # Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to achieve full Buddhahood (i.e. Bodhisattva path). # Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to achieve the state of a pratyekabuddha (private Buddha). # Beings whose innate seeds gave them the capacity to achieve the state of an arhat. # Beings whose innate seeds had an indeterminate nature, and could potentially be any of the above. # Beings whose innate seeds were incapable of achieving enlightenment ever because they lacked any wholesome seeds. The fifth class of beings, the Icchantika, were described in various Mahayana sutras as being incapable of achieving Enlightenment, unless in some cases through the aid of a Buddha or Bodhisattva. Nevertheless, the notion was highly criticized by adherents of the Lotus Sutra (e.g. the Tiantai school) and its teaching of universal Buddhahood. This tension appears in East Asian Buddhist history. = AlikƒÅkƒÅravƒÅda and SatyƒÅkƒÅravƒÅda = An important debate about the reality of mental appearances within YogƒÅcƒÅra led to its later subdivision into two systems of AlikƒÅkƒÅravƒÅda (Tib. rnam rdzun pa, False Aspectarians) and SatyƒÅkƒÅravƒÅda (rnam bden pa, True Aspectarians) or \\"Aspectarians\\" (ƒÅkƒÅra) and \\"Non-Aspectarians\\" (anƒÅkƒÅra). The core issue is whether appearances or ‚Äúaspects‚Äù (rnam pa, ƒÅkƒÅra) of objects in the mind are treated as true (bden pa, satya) or false (rdzun pa, alika).Komarovski, Yaroslav, Visions of Unity: The Golden Pa·πá·∏çita Shakya Chokden‚Äôs New Interpretation of YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 8. While this division did not exist in the works of the early YogƒÅcƒÅra philosophers, tendencies similar to these views can be discerned in the works of Yogacara thinkers like Dharmapala (c. 530‚Äì561?) and Sthiramati (c. 510‚Äì570?).Komarovski, Yaroslav, Visions of Unity: The Golden Pa·πá·∏çita Shakya Chokden‚Äôs New Interpretation of YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 73. According to Yaroslav Komarovski the distinction is: > Although YogƒÅcƒÅras in general do not accept the existence of an external > material world, according to SatyƒÅkƒÅravƒÅda its appearances or ‚Äúaspects‚Äù > (rnam pa, ƒÅkƒÅra) reflected in consciousness have a real existence, because > they are of one nature with the really existent consciousness, their > creator. According to AlikƒÅkƒÅravƒÅda, neither external phenomena nor their > appearances and/in the minds that reflect them really exist. What exists in > reality is only primordial mind (ye shes, j√±ƒÅna), described as self- > cognition (rang rig, svasamvedana/ svasamvitti) or individually self- > cognizing primordial mind (so so(r) rang gis rig pa‚Äôi ye shes).Komarovski, > Yaroslav, Visions of Unity: The Golden Pa·πá·∏çita Shakya Chokden‚Äôs New > Interpretation of YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka. Albany, New York: State > University of New York Press, 2011, p. 73-74.  Practice  The main source for the yogic and meditative practices of the YogƒÅcƒÅra school is the encyclopedic YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi-≈öƒÅstra (YBh, Treatise on the Foundation for Yoga Practitioners). The YBh presents a structured exposition of the MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhist path of yoga (here referring to spiritual practice in general) from a YogƒÅcƒÅra perspective and relies in both ƒÄgama/NikƒÅya texts and MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras while also being influenced by VaibhƒÅ·π£ika Abhidharma.Timme Kragh 2013, pp. 16, 25-26, 30, 46. According to some scholars, this text can be traced to communities of YogƒÅcƒÅras, which initially referred not to a philosophical school, but to groups of meditation specialists whose main focus was Buddhist yoga.Timme Kragh 2013, p. 31. Other YogƒÅcƒÅra texts which also discuss meditation and spiritual practice (and show some relationship with the YBh) include the Sa·πÉdhinirmocanas≈´tra, the MadhyƒÅntavibhƒÅga, MahƒÅyƒÅnas≈´trƒÅla·πÉkƒÅra, DharmadharmatƒÅvibhƒÅga and Asanga's MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha.Timme Kragh 2013, p. 34. The main or basic section of the YBh is structured around seventeen bh≈´mis (explained in fourteen books), which are \\"foundations\\" or \\"groundings\\" of meditation, referring to \\"a field of knowledge that the YogƒÅcƒÅra acolyte ought to master in order to be successful in his or her yoga practice.\\"Timme Kragh 2013, p. 50. Some of these are doctrinal topics such as the five vij√±ƒÅnas (book 1), the ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna, afflictive cognition (kli·π£·π≠a·πÉ mana·∏•), the 51 mental factors (book 2), and the defilements (sa·πÉkle≈õa, book 3). Other books discuss meditation practice proper (books 4, 9, 10, and 12).Timme Kragh 2013 pp. 51, 60 - 230 The YBh dicusses numerous classic Buddhist topics dealing with the spiritual practice of both ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna and MahƒÅyƒÅna. Some of the main topics are the eight different forms of dhyƒÅna (meditative absorptions), the three samƒÅdhis, different types of liberation (vimok·π£a), meditative attainments (samƒÅpatti) such as nirodhasamƒÅpatti, the five hindrances (nivara·πáa), the various types of foci (ƒÅlambana) or 'images' (nimitta) used in meditation, the various types of meditation used as antidotes (pratipak·π£a) against the afflictions (like contemplating death, unattractiveness, impermanence, and suffering), the practice of ≈õamatha through \\"the nine aspects of resting the mind\\" (navƒÅkƒÅrƒÅ cittasthiti·∏•), the practice of insight (vipa≈õyanƒÅ), mindfulness of breathing (ƒÅnƒÅpƒÅnasm·πõti), how to understand the four noble truths, the thirty-seven factors of Awakening (saptatri·πÉ≈õad bodhipak·π£yƒÅ dharmƒÅ·∏•), the four immeasurables (apramƒÅ·πáa), and how to practice the six perfections (pƒÅramitƒÅ). = Bodhisattva practice = The YBh's Bodhisattvabh≈´mi section discusses the YogƒÅcƒÅra school's specifically MahƒÅyƒÅna forms of practice which are tailored to bodhisattvas. These figures are seen as spiritual virtuosos who are working on attaining full Buddhahood through a process that can take hundreds of aeons of spiritual development (and countless rebirths).Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing- In-Itself,\\" in Kragh 2013 pp. 884-885. Unlike other books in the YBh (such as the ≈örƒÅvakabh≈´mi) which are more influenced by ≈örƒÅvakayƒÅna texts, the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi is strongly influenced by MahƒÅyƒÅna works, including the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ literature.Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing-In-Itself,\\" in Kragh 2013 p. 887. The aim of the bodhisattva's practice in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi is the wisdom (praj√±ƒÅ) which realizes of the inexpressible Ultimate Reality (tathata) or the 'thing-in-itself (vastumatra), which is essenceless and beyond the duality (advaya) of existence (bhƒÅva) and non- existence (abhƒÅva).Kragh 2013, p. 157.Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing-In- Itself,\\" in Kragh 2013 pp. 889-891. The Bodhisattvabh≈´mi outlines several practices of bodhisattvas, including the six perfections (pƒÅramitƒÅ), the thirty-seven factors of Awakening, and the four immeasurables. Two key practices which are unique to bodhisattvas in this text are the four investigations (parye·π£a·πáƒÅ) and the four correct cognitions (yathƒÅbh≈´taparij√±ƒÅna).Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing-In-Itself,\\" in Kragh 2013 pp. 893-894. The four investigations and the corresponding four correct cognitions or knowledges which arise from them are:Kragh 2013, p. 160.Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing-In-Itself,\\" in Kragh 2013 pp. 894-896. # The investigation of the names [of things] (nƒÅmaparye·π£a·πáƒÅ), leads to correct cognition resulting from the investigation of names just for what they are, which is \\"just names\\" (nƒÅmamƒÅtra). # The investigation of things (vastuparye·π£a·πáƒÅ), leads to correct cognition resulting from the investigation of things. One sees things just for what they are, namely a mere presence or a thing-in-itself (vastumƒÅtra). One understands that this is apart from all labels and is inexpressible (nirabhilƒÅpya). # The investigation of verbal designations suggesting and portraying an intrinsic nature (svabhƒÅva- praj√±apti-parye·π£a·πáƒÅ), leads to correct cognition resulting from the investigation of such designations. One sees the designations just for what they are, namely as mere designations (praj√±aptimƒÅtratƒÅ). Thus, one sees the idea of intrinsic nature to be illusory like a hallucination or a dream. # The investigation of verbal designations expressing individuation and differences (vi≈õe·π£apraj√±aptiparye·π£a·πáƒÅ), leads to correct cognition resulting from the investigation of such designations. One sees the designations just for what they are, namely as mere designations. For example, a thing may be designated as existing or non-existing, but such designations do not apply to true reality or the thing-in-itself. The practice which leads to the realization of the true nature of things is based on the elimination of all conceptual proliferations (prapa√±ca) and ideations (sa·πÉj√±ƒÅ) that one superimposes on true reality.Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing-In-Itself,\\" in Kragh 2013 pp. 896-897. This elimination of concepts and ideas is the basic framework applied by the bodhisattva to all meditative practices. The YBh states: > The path of practice shall be correctly followed in order to eliminate that > ideation. Through understanding, thoroughly exercised upon all objects of > knowledge, [and] by keeping in mind only the ideation that the ideations of > all phenomena [are nothing but] adventitious, you should thus repeatedly > remove any ideation conducive to the proliferation directed at all phenomena > and should consistently dwell on the thing-in-itself by a non- > conceptualizing mental state which is focused on grasping only the object > perceived without any characteristics. Thus you will obtain the > concentration stemming from the lineage of those practicing the pure > contemplation of the Tathagata's Supreme Cognition. Even when you practice > the meditation on the impurity, you should not relinquish this mental > orientation. Likewise when you practice the meditation on friendliness, > dependent origination, analysis of elements, mindfulness of breathing, the > first absorption and so on up to the station of neither ideation nor non- > ideation as well as the bodhisattva's countless meditations, supernatural > faculties, contemplations, and attainments, you should not relinquish > precisely this mental orientation.Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in > the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing-In-Itself,\\" > in Kragh 2013 pp. 897-898. The three samƒÅdhis (meditative absorption and unity) are likewise adapted into this new framework. These three are the emptiness (≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ), wishlessness (apra·πáihita), and imagelessness (ƒÅnimitta) samƒÅdhis.Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing-In-Itself,\\" in Kragh 2013 pp. 898-899. Another original contribution of the YBh regarding the bodhisattva's practice is the doctrine of the thirteen (or sometimes twelve) abodes or dwellings (vihƒÅra). This framework of the bodhisattva's path to awakening is as follows:Kragh 2013 pp. 206-208.Deleanu, Florin. \\"Meditative Practices in the Bodhisattvabh≈´mi: Quest for and Liberation through the Thing-In-Itself,\\" in Kragh 2013 pp. 907-909 # The adobe of the predisposition (gotravihƒÅra). This refers to someone with the predisposition for being a bodhisattva who has not given rise to the resolve for awakening. # The adobe of practicing with ascertainment (adhimukticaryƒÅ- vihƒÅra). This is when a bodhisattva has given rise to the resolve for Awakening and begins to practice, but they have an impure conviction and unstable meditation. # The abode of joy (pramuditavihƒÅra). This is when a bodhisattva has pure conviction due to having their first glimpse of direct realization. Their meditation is now vast, uninterrupted, and certain. # The abode higher discipline (adhi≈õƒ´lavihƒÅra) is when discipline is cultivated on the basis of pure conviction. # The abode of higher mind (adhicittavihƒÅra) is when one practices all stages of mundane meditation on the basis of higher discipline. # The abode of higher insight associated with the factors of Awakening (bodhipak·π£yapratisa·πÉyukto 'dhipraj√±avihƒÅra) is the level of analyzing the thirty-seven factors of Awakening in order to realize the truths, beginning with the four foundations of mindfulness. # The abode of higher insight associated with the truths (satyapratisa·πÉyukto 'dhipraj√±avihƒÅra) is the level of fully realizing the truths as they are on the basis of having analyzed the factors of Awakening. # The abode of higher insight associated with the arising and ceasing of dependent arising (pratƒ´tyasamutpƒÅdaprav·πõttiniv·πõttipratisa·πÉyukto 'dhipraj√±avihƒÅra) is the level wherein the practitioner after having mastered the truths sees how suffering arises when the existential facts are not understood and how suffering comes to an end when the existential facts are understood (through the process of dependent origination). # The abode free from conceptual characteristics where the path is steadily followed intentionally and with effort (sƒÅbhisa·πÉskƒÅra·∏• sƒÅbhogo ni≈õchidra-mƒÅrgavƒÅhano nirnimitto vihƒÅra·∏•). One constantly cultivates non-conceptual insight into the reality of all phenomena, while applying intention and effort. # The abode free from conceptual characteristics where the path is automatically followed spontaneously and effortlessly (anabhisa·πÉskƒÅro 'anƒÅbhoga-mƒÅrgavƒÅhano nirnimitta eva vihƒÅra·∏•). On this level, the bodhisattva is able to walk the path spontaneously and effortlessly. # The abode of analytical knowledge (pratisa·πÉvidvihƒÅra) is when the bodhisattva uses their mastery of insight and meditation to teach the Dharma to others using all terms, their meanings, their derivative analyses, and subdivisions. # The highest and perfected bodhisattva abode (parama·∏• parini·π£-panno bodhisattvavihƒÅra·∏•) is the culmination of the path, where the highest and complete Awakening is achieved. This life is their final rebirth or their penultimate rebirth before entering nirvƒÅ·πáa. # The adobe of a TathƒÅgata (tathƒÅgato vihƒÅra·∏•) is when a bodhisattva becomes a buddha, and performs all the various deeds of a buddha. History The YogƒÅcƒÅra, along with the Madhyamaka, is one of the two principal philosophical schools of Indian MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism,Jones, Lindsay (Ed. in Chief)(2005). Encyclopedia of Religion. (2nd Ed.) Volume 14; Masaaki, Hattori (Ed.)(1987 & 2005)\\"YogƒÅcƒÅra\\": p.9897. USA: Macmillan Reference. (v.14) while the TathƒÅgatagarbha-thought was also influential.E. Frauwallner (2010 (1956)), Die Philosophie des Buddhismus, p.166 =Origination= The bodhisattva Maitreya and disciples, a central figure in Yogacara origin myth. Gandhara, 3rd century CE. One of the earliest texts of this tradition is the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra which might be as early as the first or second century CE. It includes new theories such as the basis- consciousness (ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna), and the doctrine of representation-only (vij√±apti-mƒÅtra) and the \\"three natures\\" (trisvabhƒÅva). However, these theories were not completely new, as they have predecessors in older theories held by previous Buddhist schools, such as the SautrƒÅntika theory of seeds (bƒ´ja) and the Sthavira nikƒÅya's Abhidharma theory of the bhavanga. Richard King has also noted the similarity of the Sautantrika representationalism and the Yogacara: The Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra, as the doctrinal trailblazer of the YogƒÅcƒÅra, inaugurated the paradigm of the Three Turnings of the Wheel of Dharma, with its own tenets in the \\"third turning\\". YogƒÅcƒÅra texts are generally considered part of the third turning along with the relevant sutra. (Some traditions categorize this teaching as within the \\"fourth turning\\" of the wheel of Dharma.) Moreover, YogƒÅcƒÅra discourse surveys and synthesizes all three turnings and considers itself as the final definitive explanation of Buddhism. The early layers of the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi-≈õƒÅstra also contains very early YogƒÅcƒÅra material, perhaps earlier than the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana. This work is strongly influenced by SarvƒÅstivƒÅda Abhidharma. The orientation of the YogƒÅcƒÅra school is largely consistent with the thinking of the PƒÅli nikƒÅyas. It frequently treats later developments in a way that realigns them with earlier versions of Buddhist doctrines. One of the agendas of the YogƒÅcƒÅra school was to reorient the complexity of later refinements in Buddhist philosophy to accord with early Buddhist doctrine. =Asa·πÖga and Vasubandhu= YogƒÅcƒÅra philosophy's systematic exposition owes much to Asa·πÖga and Vasubandhu. Little is known of these figures, but traditional hagiographies state that Asa·πÖga received YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings from the bodhisattva and future Buddha, Maitreya. Accounts of this are given in the writings of ParamƒÅrtha (6th century) and Xuanzang, who reports that important texts like the MahƒÅyƒÅna-s≈´tra-ala·πÉkƒÅra and the Madhyanta-vibhaga are divinely revealed from Maitreya.Wayman, Alex. Untying the Knots in Buddhism: Selected Essays. 1997. p. 213 Asa·πÖga went on to write many of the key YogƒÅcƒÅra treatises such as the MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha and the Abhidharma-samuccaya as well as other works, although there are discrepancies between the Chinese and Tibetan traditions concerning which works are attributed to him and which to Maitreya. Asa·πÖga also went on to convert his brother Vasubandhu into the MahƒÅyƒÅna YogƒÅcƒÅra fold. Vasubandhu had been a top scholar of SarvƒÅstivƒÅda-VaibhƒÅ·π£ika and SautrƒÅntika Abhidharma thought, and the Abhidharmako≈õakƒÅrikƒÅ is his main work which discusses the doctrines of these traditions.Gold, Jonathan, Paving the Great Way: Vasubandhu's Unifying Buddhist Philosophy, Columbia University Press, 2014, p. 2. Vasubandhu also went on to write important YogƒÅcƒÅra works after his conversion, explaining and defending key YogƒÅcƒÅra doctrines. = Development in India = The YogƒÅcƒÅra school held a prominent position in Indian Buddhism for centuries after the time of the two brothers. According to Dan Lusthaus, after Asa·πÖga and Vasubandhu, two distinct \\"wings\\" of the school developed: # A logico-epistemic tradition focusing on issues of epistemology and logic, exemplified by such thinkers as DignƒÅga, Dharmakƒ´rti, ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita, and Ratnakƒ´rti; # an Abhidharmic psychology which refined and elaborated YogƒÅcƒÅra Abhidharma, exemplified by such thinkers as Sthiramati, DharmapƒÅla, ≈öƒ´labhadra, Xuanzang (Hs√ºan-tsang), and Vinƒ´tadeva. However, the doctrines of the Abhidharmic wing came under increased attack by other Buddhists, especially the notion of ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna, which was seen as close to the Hindu ideas of ƒÅtman and prak·πõti. Because of this, the logical tradition shifted over time to using the term citta-santƒÅna instead of ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna, since it was easier to defend a \\"stream\\" (santƒÅna) of thoughts as a doctrine that did not contradict not-self. By the end of the eighth century, the Abhidharma wing had mostly become eclipsed by the logical tradition as well as by a new hybrid school that \\"combined basic YogƒÅcƒÅra doctrines with TathƒÅgatagarbha thought.\\" According to Lusthaus: > the tathƒÅgatagarbha hybrid school was no stranger to the charge of smuggling > notions of selfhood into its doctrines, since, for example, it explicitly > defined tathƒÅgatagarbha as \\"permanent, pleasurable, self, and pure (nitya, > sukha, ƒÅtman, ≈õuddha).\\" Many tathƒÅgatagarbha texts, in fact, argue for the > acceptance of selfhood (ƒÅtman) as a sign of higher accomplishment. The > hybrid school attempted to conflate tathƒÅgatagarbha with the ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna. > Key works of the hybrid school include the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, > RatnagotravibhƒÅga (Uttaratantra), and in China the Awakening of Faith. This syncretic form of YogƒÅcƒÅra-TathƒÅgatagarbha became extremely influential in both East Asia and Tibet. During the sixth and seventh centuries, various forms of YogƒÅcƒÅra dominated the Chinese Buddhist landscape such as orthodox forms and hybrid TathƒÅgatagarbha forms. There were feuds between these two approaches. The translator Bodhiruci (6th century CE) for example, took an orthodox approach while the Ratnamati was attracted to TathƒÅgatagarbha thought and sought to translate texts like the Dasabhumika sutra in conformity with his understanding. Their disagreement on this issue led to the end of their collaboration as co-translators.Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part: The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Shambhala Publications, 2015, p. 117. The translator ParamƒÅrtha is another example of a hybrid thinker. He promoted a new theory that said there was a ninth form of consciousness, the amala-vij√±ƒÅna (a pure vij√±ƒÅna), which is revealed once the ƒÅlaya-vij√±ƒÅna is eliminated. He also associated his theory with TathƒÅgatagarbha ideas.Lusthaus, Dan, Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun, Routledge, 2014, p. 274. According to Lusthaus, Xuanzang's travels to India and his composition of the Cheng Weishi Lun was an attempt to return to a more \\"orthodox\\" and \\"authentic\\" Indian YogƒÅcƒÅra and thus put to rest the debates and confusions in the Chinese YogƒÅcƒÅra of his time. The Cheng Weishi Lun returns to the use of the theory of seeds instead of the tathƒÅgatagarbha to explain the phenomena that tathƒÅgatagarbha is supposed to explain (that is, the potentiality for Buddhahood).Lusthaus, Dan, Buddhist Phenomenology: A Philosophical Investigation of Yogacara Buddhism and the Ch'eng Wei-shih Lun, Routledge, 2014, pp. 8-10. However, Lusthaus writes that in the eighth century, this 'schism' was finally settled \\"in favor of a hybrid version, which became definitive for all subsequent forms of East Asian Buddhism.\\" Later Chinese thinkers like Fa-Tsang would thus criticize Xuanzang for failing to teach the tathƒÅgatagarbha in his system. Karl Brunnh√∂lzl notes that this syncretic tendency also existed in India, but that: > it seems that YogƒÅcƒÅra masters generally adopted the notion of > tathƒÅgatagarbha in accordance with the Uttaratantra only later, when > Buddhist tantra with its very similar notions of ground tantra and all > beings‚Äô primordially being buddhas was flourishing. Examples of such > YogƒÅcƒÅras include J√±ƒÅna≈õrƒ´mitra, RatnƒÅkara≈õƒÅnti, and the authors of several > commentaries on the praj√±aparamita from a YogƒÅcƒÅra perspective.Brunnholzl, > Karl, When the Clouds Part: The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as > a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Shambhala Publications, 2015, p. 118. =YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka= According to Tibetan sources, this school was in protracted dialectic with the Madhyamaka tradition. However, there is disagreement among contemporary Western and traditional Buddhist scholars about the degree to which they were opposed, if at all.:50f. The main difference deals with issues of existence and the nature of emptiness. While Madhyamaka works state that asserting the existence or non-existence of anything was inappropriate (including emptiness), YogƒÅcƒÅra treatises often assert that the dependent nature (paratantra-svabhƒÅva) really exists and that emptiness is an actual absence that also exists. For example, the MadhyƒÅntavibhƒÅga clearly asserts that \\"the imagination of the nonexistent [abh≈´ta-parikalpa] exists. In it duality does not exist. Emptiness, however, exists in it.\\"Williams (2008), p. 93. Classical YogƒÅcƒÅra thinkers like Asa·πÖga and Vasubandhu critiqued Madhyamikas who \\"adhere to non-existence\\" (nƒÅstikas, vainƒÅ≈õkas) because they saw them as straying into nihilism (ucchedavƒÅda).King, Richard, Early YogƒÅcƒÅra and its Relationship with the Madhyamaka School, Philosophy East & West Volume 44, Number 4 October 1994 PP.659-683. They held that there was really something which could be said to \\"exist\\", that is, vij√±apti, and that was what is described as being \\"empty\\" their system. The position that YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka were in dialectic was expounded by Xuanzang in the 7th century. After a suite of debates with exponents of the Madhyamaka school in India, Xuanzang composed in Sanskrit the no longer extant three-thousand verse treatise The Non-difference of Madhyamaka and YogƒÅcƒÅra.Lusthaus, Dan (undated). Xuanzang (Hs√ºan-tsang). Source: (accessed: December 12, 2007) YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka philosophers demonstrated two opposing tendencies throughout the history of Buddhist philosophy in India, one which worked to separate and distance the two systems and one tendency which worked towards harmonizing them.Komarovski, Yaroslav, Visions of Unity: The Golden Pa·πá·∏çita Shakya Chokden‚Äôs New Interpretation of YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 74. The harmonizing tendency can be seen in the work of philosophers like J√±ƒÅnagarbha (8th century), his student ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita (8th century) and also in the work of the YogƒÅcƒÅra thinker Ratnakaraksanti (c. 1000). These thinkers also saw the YogƒÅcƒÅra AlikƒÅkƒÅravƒÅda (\\"false aspectarian\\", those YogƒÅcƒÅras who believe that mental appearances are false or don't ultimately exist) view as the highest. ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita (8th century), whose view was later called \\"YogƒÅcƒÅra-Svatantrika-Madhyamaka\\" by the Tibetan tradition, saw the MƒÅdhyamika position as ultimately true and at the same time saw the YogƒÅcƒÅra view as a useful way to relate to conventionalities and progress students more skillfully toward the ultimate.Shantarakshita & Ju Mipham (2005) pp.117-122 This synthesized view between the two positions, and also incorporated the views of valid cognition (pramana) from DignƒÅga and Dharmakƒ´rti. Later Tibetan Buddhist thinkers like Shakya Chokden would also work to show the compatibility of the AlikƒÅkƒÅravƒÅda sub-school with Madhyamaka, arguing that it is in fact a form of Madhyamaka.Komarovski, Yaroslav, Visions of Unity: The Golden Pa·πá·∏çita Shakya Chokden‚Äôs New Interpretation of YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 10. Likewise, the Seventh Karmapa Ch√∂drak Gyamtso has a similar view which holds that the \\"profound important points and intents\\" of the two systems are one.Komarovski, Yaroslav, Visions of Unity: The Golden Pa·πá·∏çita Shakya Chokden‚Äôs New Interpretation of YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka. Albany, New York: State University of New York Press, 2011, p. 81. Ju Mipham is also another Tibetan philosopher whose project is aimed as showing the harmony between Yogacara and Madhyamaka, arguing that there is only a very subtle difference between them, being a subtle clinging by Yogacaras to the existence of an \\"inexpressible, naturally luminous cognition\\" (rig pa rang bzhin gyis ‚Äôod gsal ba).Komarovski, Yaroslav, Visions of Unity: The Golden Pa·πá·∏çita Shakya Chokden‚Äôs New Interpretation of YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka.

Philosophy of Mind in Sixth-Century China: Paramartha's Evolution of Consciousness. 1984. pp. 30-32 Xuanzang (fl. c. 602 ‚Äì 664) is often seen as the most important founder of East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra. At the age of 33, Xuanzang made a dangerous journey to India in order to study Buddhism and procure texts for later translation.Liu, JeeLoo. An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy: From Ancient Philosophy to Chinese Buddhism. 2006. p. 220 Dan Lusthaus writes that Xuanzang had come to the conclusion that issues of dispute in Chinese Buddhism could be resolved with the availability of important texts like the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi ≈öƒÅstra. Xuanzang spent over ten years in India traveling and studying under various Buddhist masters. Lusthaus writes that during this time, Xuanzang discovered that the manner in which Buddhists understood and interpreted texts was much richer and more varied than the Chinese materials had previously indicated, and drew meaning from a broad cultural context. Xuanzang's teachers included ≈öƒ´labhadra, the abbot of NƒÅlandƒÅ, who was then 106 years old and who tutored him for 10 years.Wei Tat. Cheng Weishi Lun. 1973. p. li Upon his return from India, Xuanzang brought with him 657 Buddhist texts, including important YogƒÅcƒÅra works such as the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi. He was given government support and many assistants for the purpose of translating these texts into Chinese. As an important contribution to East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra, Xuanzang composed the Cheng Weishi Lun, or \\"Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only.\\"Liu, JeeLoo. An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy: From Ancient Philosophy to Chinese Buddhism. 2006. p. 221 This work is framed around Vasubandhu's Tri·πÉ≈õikƒÅ-vij√±aptimƒÅtratƒÅ, or \\"Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only.\\" In his commentary, Xuanzang upheld DharmapƒÅla's commentary on this work as being the correct one, and provided his own explanations of these as well as other views. This work was composed at the behest of Xuanzang's disciple Kuƒ´jƒ´ (632‚Äì682), and became a central work of East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra. Xuanzang also promoted devotional meditative practices toward Maitreya. Xuanzang's disciple Kuiji wrote a number of important commentaries on YogƒÅcƒÅra texts and further developed the influence of this doctrine in China. He was recognized by later adherents as the first true patriarch of the school.Lusthaus, Dan (undated). Quick Overview of the Faxiang School Ê≥ïÁõ∏ÂÆó. Source: (accessed: December 12, 2007) The tradition was also brought to Korea (where it is known as Beopsang) and Japan (where it is known as Hoss≈ç). Principal exponents of YogƒÅcƒÅra in Korea include Daehyeon (Â§ßË≥¢), Sinhaeng (Á•ûË°å ; 704-779), Woncheuk (ÂúìÊ∏¨ ; 631-696) and Wonhyo (ÂÖÉÊõâ ; ÏõêÌö® ; 617 - 686), while in Japan they include Chits≈´ (Êô∫ÈÄö) and Chidatsu (Êô∫ÈÅî) of the Kusha- sh≈´ school, Dosho (ÈÅìÊò≠), Jokei (Ë≤ûÊÖ∂), Zenju (ÂñÑÁè†), Tokuitsu (Âæ≥‰∏Ä). =YogƒÅcƒÅra in Tibet= Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen (1292‚Äì1361), founder of the Jonang school and popularizer of YogƒÅcƒÅra-TathƒÅgatagarbha thought YogƒÅcƒÅra was first transmitted to Tibet by ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita, Kamala≈õƒ´la and Ati≈õa and YogƒÅcƒÅra thought is an integral part of the history of Tibetan Buddhism. YogƒÅcƒÅra is studied in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, though it receives different emphasis in each. Like the Chinese tradition, the Tibetan Nyingma school and its Dzogchen teachings promote a hybrid form of YogƒÅcƒÅra-TathƒÅgatagarbha. The Jonang school meanwhile developed its own systematic view which they termed shentong (\\"other-voidness\\" ), which included elements from YogƒÅcƒÅra, Madhyamaka and TathƒÅgatagarbha. They considered this view to be definitive, in contrast to the rangtong (\\"self-voidness\\" or prasa·πÖgika, ), comprising both Svatantrika and Prasa·πÖgika Madhyamaka. Although Je Tsongkhapa (whose reforms to Ati≈õa's Kadam tradition are generally considered the beginnings of the Gelug school) argued in favour of YogƒÅcƒÅra views (specifically regarding the existence and functioning of eight consciousnesses) early in his career, the prevailing Gelug view eventually came to hold YogƒÅcƒÅra views as a matter of interpretable meaning, therefore distinct from Madhyamaka which was held to be of definitive meaning. Current discussions between Tibetan scholars regarding the differences between shentong and rangtong views may therefore appear similar to historical debates between YogƒÅcƒÅra and Madhyamaka, but the specific distinctions have, in fact, evolved much further. Although later Tibetan views may be said to have evolved from the earlier Indian positions, the distinctions between the views have become increasingly subtle and complex, especially as Tibetan YogƒÅcƒÅra has evolved to incorporate Madhyamaka and TathƒÅgatagarbha philosophies. Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso, the 19th-century Rim√© movement commentator, wrote in his commentary on ≈öƒÅntarak·π£ita's synthesis, that the ultimate view in both schools is the same, and that each path leads to the same ultimate state of abiding. Textual corpus = S≈´tras = The Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra (\\"S≈´tra of the Explanation of the Profound Secrets\\"; 2nd century CE), was the seminal YogƒÅcƒÅra sutra and continued to be a primary referent for the tradition. Another text, the MahƒÅyƒÅnƒÅbhidharmas≈´tra is often quoted in YogƒÅcƒÅra works and is assumed to also be an early YogƒÅcƒÅra sutra. The La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra also later assumed considerable importance in East Asia, and portions of this text were considered by √âtienne Lamotte as being contemporaneous with the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana.Fernando Tola, Carmen Dragonetti. Being as Consciousness: YogƒÅcƒÅra Philosophy of Buddhism, p. xiiFoundations of Buddhism, by Rupert Gethin. Oxford University Press: 1998. This text equates the YogƒÅcƒÅra theory of ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna with the TathƒÅgatagarbha and thus seems to be part of the tradition which sought to merge YogƒÅcƒÅra with TathƒÅgatagarbha thought.Williams, 2008, p. 103. = Asa·πÖga, Vasubandhu and early ≈öƒÅstras = Some of the earliest YogƒÅcƒÅra material can be found in the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi- ≈õƒÅstra, such as the doctrines of ƒÅlayavij√±ƒÅna and ƒÅ≈õrayaparƒÅv·πõtti. This text, a massive encyclopedic work on yogic praxis, is traditionally attributed to Asa·πÖga (4th century) or Maitreya, but most scholars (such as Schmithausen and Aramaki) believe it contains the work of many authors, and its components reflect various stages of historical development. Most of its material is non- Mahayana and according to Lusthaus, it draws extensively from on the ƒÄgamas.Kritzer (2005), p. xvii, xix. Nevertheless, Asa·πÖga may still have influenced its development.Lugli, Ligeia, Asa·πÖga, oxfordbibliographies.com, LAST MODIFIED: 25 NOVEMBER 2014, DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195393521-0205. Tibetan depiction of Asa·πÖga and Maitreya Authorship of several major YogƒÅcƒÅra treatises or ≈õƒÅstras are ascribed to Asa·πÖga, a major doctrinal systematizer of the school. Among them are his magnum opus, the MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha and also a compendium of YogƒÅcƒÅra Abhidharma, the Abhidharma-samuccaya. Asa·πÖga's brother Vasubandhu is also considered to be an important YogƒÅcƒÅra figure. He wrote various important ≈õƒÅstras, including the TrisvabhƒÅva-nirde≈õa (Treatise on the Three Natures), Vi·πÉ≈õa·π≠ikƒÅ-kƒÅrikƒÅ (Treatise in Twenty Stanzas), Tri·πÉ≈õikƒÅ-kƒÅrikƒÅ (Treatise in Thirty Stanzas), VyƒÅkhyƒÅyukti (\\"Proper Mode of Exposition\\"), Karmasiddhiprakarana (\\"A Treatise on Karma\\"), and the Pa√±caskandhaprakara·πáa (Explanation of the Five Aggregates). According to Jay Garfield, the TrisvabhƒÅva-nirde≈õa is \\"arguably one of the most philosophically detailed and comprehensive\\" work on the three natures by Vasubandhu. Vasubandhu also wrote a large systematic work on Abhidharma, the Abhidharmako≈õa-bhƒÅ·π£ya, which remains influential in Tibet and East Asia. According to Robert Kritzer, though this work is traditionally seen as being based on Sarvastivada and Sautrantika Abhidharma, it also contains YogƒÅcƒÅra influences drawn from the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi.Kritzer (2005), p. xii. =Other figures and texts= According to Williams, there is a fairly early YogƒÅcƒÅra work surviving in Sanskrit called the Alokamala (‚ÄòGarland of Light‚Äô) of Kambala (c. 450‚Äì525), which \\"gives of a form of YogƒÅcƒÅra just prior to the vigorous critical Madhyamika response to it represented by the works of Bhavaviveka.\\" Williams also notes that this work \\"tries to harmonize where possible the Madhyamika position with that of YogƒÅcƒÅra.\\"Williams (2008), pp. 87-88. Important commentaries on various YogƒÅcƒÅra texts were written by Sthiramati (6th century) and Dharmapala of Nalanda (6th century), who represent different subschools of the tradition. The Indian Buddhist logician DignƒÅga (c. 480‚Äì 540 CE) wrote an important YogƒÅcƒÅra work, the Alambanapariksa and its vrtti (commentary). The work of Dharmakirti also shows YogƒÅcƒÅra influence. The Chinese figure of Xuanzang (602-664) wrote a commentary (Ch' eng wei shih lun, Skt. reconstruction: Vij√±aptimƒÅtratƒÅsiddhi*) on the TrimsikƒÅ of Vasubandhu, for which he used numerous Indian commentaries, favoring the work of Dharmapala. In the East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra tradition, this is the central work on YogƒÅcƒÅra philosophy. Besides the works of Asa·πÖga and Vasubandhu outlined above, the YogƒÅcƒÅra tradition as it is understood in Tibetan Buddhism is also based on a series of texts called the Five Dharmas of Maitreya. These are the MahƒÅyƒÅnas≈´trƒÅlamkƒÅra, DharmadharmatƒÅvibhƒÅga, MadhyƒÅntavibhƒÅgakƒÅrikƒÅ, Abhisamayalankara and the Ratnagotravibhaga. These texts are traditionally said to have been related to Asa·πÖga by the Bodhisattva Maitreya from Tusita Heaven.The Buddha Within by S. K. Hookham. SUNY Press, , pgs 325-6 According to D.S. Ruegg, the \\"five works of Maitreya\\" are mentioned in Sanskrit sources from only the 11th century onwards.Ruegg, D.S. La Theorie du Tathagatagarbha et du Gotra. Paris: Ecole d'Extreme Orient, 1969, p. 35. As noted by S.K. Hookham and Paul Williams, their attribution to a single author has been questioned by modern scholars, especially the Abhisamayalankara and the Ratnagotravibhaga (which focuses on tathƒÅgatagarbha).Hookham, S. K. (1991). The Buddha within: Tathagatagarbha doctrine according to the Shentong interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga. SUNY Press. . Source; [3] (accessed: Tuesday May 5, 2009), p.325.Williams, 2008, p. 87. There are also various commentaries on these texts from Indian and Tibetan authors that are important in the Tibetan scholastic tradition. According to Karl Brunnholzl, the Chinese tradition also speaks of five Maitreya texts (first mentioned in Dunlun's Yujia lunji), \\"but considers them as consisting of the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi, *YogavibhƒÅga [now lost], MahƒÅyƒÅnas≈´trƒÅlamkƒÅrakƒÅ, MadhyƒÅntavibhƒÅga and the VajracchedikƒÅkƒÅvyƒÅkhyƒÅ.\\"Brunnholzl, Karl, When the Clouds Part: The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Shambhala Publications, 2015, p. 81.

Powers, and Wayman. Buddhist scholar Jay Garfield continues to uphold the equation of YogƒÅcƒÅra and idealism, however.Garfield, Jay L. (2002). Empty words : Buddhist philosophy and cross- cultural interpretation ([Online-Ausg.]. ed.). New York: Oxford University Press. . To the same effect, Nobuyoshi Yamabe states that \\"DignƒÅga also clearly inherited the idealistic system of YogƒÅcƒÅra.\\" Yamabe, Nobuyoshi (2004), \\"Consciousness, Theories of\\", in Buswell, Jr., Robert E., Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism, USA: Macmillan Reference USA, pp. 177, Like many contemporary scholars, Yamabe is aware that the texts considered to be YogƒÅcƒÅra treatises reflect various stages in addressing the issue of mind and matter. YogƒÅcƒÅra has also been aligned with phenomenalism. In modern western philosophical discourse, Edmund Husserl and Maurice Merleau-Ponty have approached what western scholarship generally concedes to be a standard YogƒÅcƒÅra position. Legacy There are two important aspects of the YogƒÅcƒÅra schemata that are of special interest to modern-day practitioners. One is that virtually all schools of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism came to rely on these YogƒÅcƒÅra explanations as they created their own doctrinal systems, including the Zen schools. For example, the early Zen tradition in China was sometimes referred to simply as the \\" school\\" (Ch. Ê•û‰ºΩÂÆó, L√©ngqi√© Z≈çng), due to their strong association with the '. This s≈´tra draws heavily upon YogƒÅcƒÅra theories of the eight consciousnesses, especially the '. Accounts recording the history of this early period are preserved in Records of the Masters (Ch. Ê•û‰ºΩÂ∏´Ë≥áË®ò, L√©ngqi√© Shƒ´zƒ´ J√¨). That the scriptural tradition of YogƒÅcƒÅra is not yet well known among the community of western practitioners is perhaps attributable to the fact that most of the initial transmission of Buddhism to the west has been directly concerned with meditation and basic doctrines. However, within Tibetan Buddhism more and more western students are becoming acquainted with this school. Very little research in English has been carried out on the Chinese YogƒÅcƒÅra traditions.

He is credited as the founder of the Jogye Order, by working to unify the disparate sects in Korean Buddhism into a cohesive organization.  Biography  Bojo Jinul's birthname was Jeong and by age 15 he left his family to ordain under Seon Master Jonghwi of the Sagulsan School, one of the nine mountain schools of Seon, receiving the ordination name \\"Jinul\\". This occurred in 1173. By 1182, Jinul passed the royal examination for monks and qualified for a higher administrative position, but turned it down to join the Seon sangha at Bojesa in Pyongyang. The community being uninterested in his efforts to reform the retreat community, he moved to Cheongwonsa at Changpyeong, then Bomunsa on Hagasan. During this period of travel and study, Jinul was said to have studied the entire Tripi·π≠aka and had a series of awakenings. Jinul sought to establish a new movement within Korean Seon which he called the \\"samadhi and praj√±ƒÅ society\\" (). This movement's goal was to establish a new community of disciplined, pure-minded practitioners deep in the mountains. Jinul eventually accomplished this mission with the founding of Songgwangsa on Jogyesan, and in the process the Jogye Order, which taught a comprehensive approach to Buddhism including meditation, doctrine, chanting and lectures. By 1209, he completed his magnum opus the Excerpts from the Dharma Collection and Special Practice Record with Personal Notes (), an extensive exploration of various schools of Chan Buddhism in China, with extensive commentaries on the writings of the Chinese monk Guifeng Zongmi as well as personal notes. This earned him the respect of the Goryeo, and in particular King Huijong, who ordered that Mount Songgwangsan be renamed Jogyesan in his honor. Upon his death in 1210, he was given a posthumous title of honor by King Huijong as well.  Teachings  = Essence-Function = Essence-Function () is a key concept of Korean Buddhism. Essence-Function takes a particular form in the philosophy and writings of Jinul.Charles A.

This essence is the very nature of Buddha and has always been present in beings. Writing on the faith in such matters held by his own school, Jinul states: Jinul further believed that the true nature of all people is unchanging and that their minds are ultimately numinous and marked by awareness, even when seemingly in a state of delusion.

Nintendo marketed the New-Style NES model as the NES Control Deck, exactly the same as the original NES-001 model, only with a \\"new design\\" mark on the packaging. It retailed in North America for $49.99 USD (equivalent to $ in ). This was at a significantly lower price than the already released Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The NES-101 control deck came packaged with a redesigned version of the standard NES controller (model number NES-039) shaped very similarly to the Super NES controller.  Hardware  The external appearance of the NES was greatly overhauled and restyled to align its looks to the North American version of the Super NES control deck and to address a number of commonly cited ergonomic problems of the original NES-001 model. The case design was by Lance Barr, who also designed the North American versions of the original NES and Super NES, as well as the later redesigned Super NES. The power and reset buttons now matched the curvature of the new look. The NES-101 does not have an LED power light to indicate the unit is on, as the original NES-001 and SNS-001 included. The most obvious change in the redesign was the removal of the front-loading Zero-Insertion-Force (ZIF) mechanism of the cartridge slot in the original NES-001 model. In that system, the user had to first open the lid of the case, slide in the cartridge, then press it down. The large space inside allowed plenty of room for dust to settle and the contact heads were almost impossible to access and clean without disassembling the system or using the official cleaning kit. Wear and tear was another problem; with continued use, the precision of the mechanism deteriorated and the user would have to poke and nudge at the cartridge to move it to a position that would be read correctly. The NES-101 returned to the standard top-loading method, used by almost all cartridge systems before and since for its ease and reliability. The 10NES authentication chip was completely removed from the system in an effort to eliminate the blinking red power light problem associated with it in the original NES. The removal of the 10NES chip also allows the system to play games that are unlicensed and/or from different regions such as Europe, something NES-001 systems cannot do without a hardware modification. A minor side-effect is that Nintendo World Championship will not work properly since it needs to know when the console is reset in order to go back to the menu. This signal is only provided by a working 10NES on official hardware. The RCA composite video output and audio jacks were removed from the system as well; an RF connection is the only way to connect the system to a television unless one has the console modified to add composite output or uses an RF-to-RCA converter. The original video amplifier circuit path on the motherboard was poorly designed and created faint \\"jailbar\\" interference patterns in the game image. = Controller = The New-Style NES Controller The NES-101 control deck features the same 7-pin controller ports as the NES-001 and is compatible with all the same controllers and peripherals. The console came packaged with a similarly-redesigned version of the standard NES controller (model number NES-039), nicknamed the \\"dogbone\\" controller due to its shape, instead of the original NES-004 model controller. While the NES-101 console only came with one controller, the NES-039 controller was also sold by itself and is fully compatible with either version of the NES control deck. The NES-039 controller more closely resemble the Super NES controller, with rounded edges that fit more ergonomically in the hands than the rectangular design of the NES-004 model. The A and B buttons were also set at an angle to mimic the Super NES controller as well as provide better ergonomics. Because of its ergonomic shape, the NES-039 model controller does not fit in R.O.B.'s controller slot. = Revisions = There are two known revisions of the New- Style NES; both have redesigned circuit boards that improve video output quality. The first has a Nintendo AV multi-out port (the same used in the Super NES, Nintendo 64, and GameCube) that replaces the RF jack completely. The other looks exactly the same as the rest with the RF video output jack and channel select switch, but with excellent video output quality. These versions were replacements for those who sent their original New-Style NES systems to Nintendo with a poor quality video complaint. These models are extremely rare as they mostly came as replacement units from Nintendo, but the revised AV model was also found in stores such as Meijer and Radio Shack. All PAL units, model NESP-101, were shipped with the revised motherboard and cleaner RF output, but video output used the 50 Hz PAL standard rather than the 60 Hz NTSC. The PAL versions also do not have a channel select switch. They also have some minor cosmetic differences. On NTSC top loaders, the RF out panel is made from the same light gray plastic as the top shell. On the PAL version, the RF out panel is made from the same dark gray plastic as the base shell. The PAL console also lacks an 1800 service hotline sticker. = AV Family Computer = alt=The AV Famicom with the Disk System add-on attached The HVC-101 model of the Family Computer is a redesign of the video game console of the same name (commonly known by the portmanteau of Famicom) released by Nintendo in Japan in the early 1980s. While officially called the Family Computer, exactly the same branding as the original HVC-001 model, it was also marketed as the or to distinguish it from the original model. It was released in Japan on December 1, 1993 with a retail price for ¬•6800, and remained in production until September 2003. The HVC-101 console is stylistically similar to the New-Style NES model released in North America a few months earlier, but has some slight design changes to suit the different needs of the Japanese market. Instead of hardwired controllers like the original Famicom, the New Famicom has the same 7-pin controller ports as the NES (in addition to having a dedicated expansion port for peripherals just like the original Famicom) and came bundled with two connectable controllers (model number HVC-102). The HVC-102 controllers are identical in design to the NES-039 controller, but have much shorter cords. In bringing NES-style control ports to the HVC-101 model made the console compatible with all NES controllers as well (although certain NES peripherals that required the second controller port, such as the Zapper and the Power Pad, will not work on the New Famicom). Because the two packaged controllers are identical in terms of functionality, they both lack the built-in microphone that the original Famicom's second controller has in place of the Start and Select buttons. The external RF modulator for the AV Famicom The biggest difference between the North American New-Style NES model and the Japanese HVC-101 model was the replacement of the RF modulator output with the same multi-AV output port that the Super Famicom uses. This also represented the biggest selling point the New Famicom has over the original Famicom, which only has RF output as well. Thus the New Famicom requires either, the monaural (SHVC-007) or stereo AV cables (SHVC-008) that the Super Famicom uses for output (however, the New Famicom is only capable of outputting mono audio, even when using stereo cables). The Super Famicom's S-Video (SHVC-009) and RGB (SHVC-010) cables are not compatible with the New Famicom, despite having the same connector type. Nintendo also sold an external RF modulator (HVC-103) for users who wanted to connect the New Famicom to a TV set which lacked a composite video input. Like with the Super Famicom, Nintendo did not package an AV cable or AC adapter with the New Famicom - both were sold separately. The New Famicom requires the same AC adapter (HVC-002) as the original Famicom and the Super Famicom. The HVC-101 has a flat surface in contrast to the convex surface of the New-Style NES. This was done in order to make the New Famicom compatible with the Disk System add-on, which uses a RAM Adapter that plugs into the console's cartridge slot in order to interface with the main Disk System unit. Peripherals that work on the New Famicom (rather than on the original Famicom) were sold the Famicom Family New (or FF New) marking, but aside from the aforementioned hookup cables, the only licensed peripheral that was released with this marking was the New Hori Commander (HFC-07) controller, which was the only licensed third- party controller in Japan that has an NES-style controller plug.

He is also known as a contributor to The Examiner. Early life Prior was probably born in Middlesex.Leopold George Wickham Legg, Matthew Prior: A Study of His Public Career and Correspondence, Cambridge University Press, 2010. pp. 2‚Äì3. He was the son of a Nonconformist joiner at Wimborne Minster, East Dorset. His father moved to London, and sent him to Westminster School, under Dr Busby. On his father's death, he left school, and was cared for by his uncle, a vintner in Channel Row. Here Lord Dorset found him reading Horace, and set him to translate an ode. He did so well that the Earl offered to contribute to the continuation of his education at Westminster. One of his schoolfellows and friends was Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax. It was to avoid being separated from Montagu and his brother James that Prior accepted, against his patron's wish, a scholarship recently founded at St John's College, Cambridge. He took his B.A. degree in 1686, and two years later became a fellow. In collaboration with Montagu he wrote in 1687 the City Mouse and Country Mouse, in ridicule of John Dryden's The Hind and the Panther. Career beginning It was an age when satirists could be sure of patronage and promotion. Montagu was promoted at once, and Prior, three years later, became secretary to the embassy at the Hague. After four years of this, he was appointed a Gentleman of the Bedchamber at court. Apparently he acted as one of the King's secretaries, and in 1697 he was secretary to the plenipotentiaries who concluded the Peace of Ryswick. Prior's talent for affairs was doubted by Pope, who had no special means of judging, but it is not likely that King William would have employed in this important business a man who had not given proof of diplomatic skill and grasp of details. The poet's knowledge of French is specially mentioned among his qualifications, and this was recognized by his being sent in the following year to Paris in attendance on the English ambassador. At this period Prior could say with good reason that \\"he had commonly business enough upon his hands, and was only a poet by accident.\\" To verse, however, which had laid the foundation of his fortunes, he still occasionally trusted as a means of maintaining his position. His occasional poems during this period include an elegy on Queen Mary in 1695; a satirical version of Boileau's Ode sur le prise de Namur (1695); some lines on William's escape from assassination in 1696; and a brief piece called The Secretary. After his return from France Prior became under-secretary of state and succeeded John Locke as a commissioner of trade. In 1701 he sat in Parliament for East Grinstead. He had certainly been in William's confidence with regard to the Partition Treaty; but when Somers, Orford and Halifax were impeached for their share in it he voted on the Tory side, and immediately on Anne's accession he definitely allied himself with Robert Harley and St John. Perhaps in consequence of this for nine years there is no mention of his name in connection with any public transaction. But when the Tories came into power in 1710 Prior's diplomatic abilities were again called into action, and until the death of Anne he held a prominent place in all negotiations with the French court, sometimes as secret agent, sometimes in an equivocal position as ambassador's companion, sometimes as fully accredited but very unpunctually paid ambassador. His share in negotiating the Treaty of Utrecht, of which he is said to have disapproved personally, led to its popular nickname of \\"Matt's Peace.\\" Prior is also known as a contributor to The Examiner newspaper. Prison life and poetry writing When the Queen died and the Whigs regained power, he was impeached by Robert Walpole and kept in close custody for two years (1715‚Äì1717). In 1709, he had already published a collection of verse. During this imprisonment, maintaining his cheerful philosophy, he wrote his longest humorous poem, Alma; or, The Progress of the Mind. This, along with his most ambitious work, Solomon, and other Poems on several Occasions, was published by subscription in 1718. The sum received for this volume (4000 guineas), with a present of ¬£4000 from Lord Harley, enabled him to live in comfort; but he did not long survive his enforced retirement from public life, although he bore his ups and downs with rare equanimity. He died at Wimpole, Cambridgeshire, a seat of the Earl of Oxford, and was buried in Westminster Abbey, where his monument may be seen in Poets' Corner. A History of his Own Time was issued by J Bancks in 1740. The book pretended to be derived from Prior's papers, but it is doubtful how far it should be regarded as authentic. Jonathon Richardson, circa 1718 Prior's poems show considerable variety, a pleasant scholarship and great executive skill. The most ambitious, i.e. Solomon, and the paraphrase of The Nut-Brown Maid, are the least successful. But Alma, an admitted imitation of Samuel Butler, is a delightful piece of wayward easy humour, full of witty turns and well- remembered allusions, and Prior's mastery of the octo-syllabic couplet is greater than that of Jonathan Swift or Pope. His tales in rhyme, though often objectionable in their themes, are excellent specimens of narrative skill; and as an epigrammatist he is unrivalled in English. The majority of his love songs are frigid and academic, mere wax-flowers of Parnassus; but in familiar or playful efforts, of which the type are the admirable lines To a Child of Quality, he has still no rival. \\"Prior's\\"‚Äîsays Thackeray, himself no mean proficient in this kind‚Äî\\"seem to me amongst the easiest, the richest, the most charmingly humorous of English lyrical poems. Horace is always in his mind, and his song and his philosophy, his good sense, his happy easy turns and melody, his loves and his Epicureanism, bear a great resemblance to that most delightful and accomplished master.\\" Wittenham Clumps in Oxfordshire is said to be where Prior wrote Henry and Emma, and this is now commemorated by a plaque. Prior has been commemorated by other poets as well; Everett James Ellis named Prior as a significant influence and source of inspiration.

The Portuguese came to S√£o Tom√© in search of land to grow sugarcane. The island was uninhabited before the arrival of the Portuguese sometime around 1470. S√£o Tom√©, situated about north of the equator, had a climate wet enough to grow sugarcane in wild abundance. 2,000 Jewish children, eight years old and under, were taken from the Iberian peninsula for work on the sugar plantations. The nearby African Kingdom of Kongo eventually became a source of slave labor as well. The island of S√£o Tom√© was the main center of sugar production in the sixteenth century; it was overtaken by Brazil by 1600. S√£o Tom√© is centred on a sixteenth-century cathedral, that was largely rebuilt in the 19th century. Another early building is Fort S√£o Sebasti√£o, built in 1566 and now the S√£o Tom√© National Museum.

He was given the title of Marquis of Conti and between 1581 and 1597 was elevated to the rank of a prince. The title of Prince of Conti was honorary and did not carry any territorial jurisdiction. Biography Fran√ßois was born in La Fert√©-sous- Jouarre, in the √éle-de-France region. He was a member of a junior line of the House of Bourbon, his first cousin being the future Henry IV of France. Brought up within a highly Protestant family, his mother died in 1564 followed by his father in 1569. His father remarried Fran√ßoise d'Orl√©ans, Mademoiselle de Longueville in 1565 and had a further three children, Charles, Count of Soissons being the only child to survive infancy. Conti, who belonged to the older faith, appears to have taken no part in the French Wars of Religion until 1587, when his distrust of Henry of Lorraine, Duke of Guise caused him to declare against the League and to support his cousin Henry of Navarre, afterwards King Henry IV. In 1589 after the murder of Henry III he was one of the two princes of the blood who signed the declaration recognising Henry IV as king, and continued to support him even though he himself was mentioned as a candidate for the throne upon the death of Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon in 1590. Conti's first wife was Jeanne de Coesme, heiress of Bonn√©table. She was the mother of Anne de Montafi√© by her previous marriage to the Count of Montafi√©. The couple were married at the Palais du Louvre on 17 December 1581, Jeanne died in 1601 having had no children. On 24 July 1605 he married Louise Marguerite of Lorraine (1588‚Äì1631), daughter of Duke Henri of Guise and Catherine of Cleves, who was desired by Henry IV. The couple were married at the Ch√¢teau de Meudon. Conti died in 1614 and the title of Prince of Conti lapsed following his death in 1614, as his only child, Marie, predeceased him in 1610. She was only three weeks old. He had an illegitimate son, Nicolas de Conti (d. 1648), abbot of Gramont. His widow followed the fortunes of Maria de' Medici, from whom she received many marks of favour, and was secretly married to Fran√ßois de Bassompierre, who joined her in conspiring against Cardinal Richelieu. Upon the exposure of the plot the cardinal exiled her to her estate at Eu, near Amiens, where she died. The princess wrote Aventures de la cour de Perse, in which, under the veil of fictitious scenes and names, she tells the history of her own time.

Title page of the 1861 first edition. Frontispiece by Thomas Woolner. The Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics is a popular anthology of English poetry, originally selected for publication by Francis Turner Palgrave in 1861. It was considerably revised, with input from Tennyson, about three decades later. Palgrave excluded all poems by poets then still alive. The book continues to be published in regular new editions; still under Palgrave's name. These reproduce Palgrave's selections and notes, but usually include a supplement of more recent poems. Christopher Ricks in 1991 produced a scholarly edition of the original Treasury, along with an account of its evolution from 1861 to 1891, with inclusions and exclusions.

It is part of Turtledove's Southern Victory series of novels. This trilogy is an alternative imaginary scenario of World War I, between 1914 and 1917, as a result of the Confederate States' victory over the United States in 1862. The Great War saga Starting from two defeats at the hands of the Confederate States of America, which was allied with the United Kingdom and France, the United States of America has turned to an alliance with the strengthening German Empire as well as Austria Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. The US military has been reformed along German lines, and gets a great deal of technical assistance from Germany, especially with regard to fighter aircraft. The antebellum Republican Party has mostly collapsed, discredited by the defeats, leaving the right-winged Democratic Party and the left-winged Socialist Party (whose rise was aided by the defection of former President Abraham Lincoln and his supporters from the Republicans to the Socialists) as the main political parties in the United States. When in 1914 the Great War breaks out in Europe following the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Sophie by car bombing, both the USA and CSA join almost immediately on the side of their respective allies, and the USA is fighting a two-front war against Britain's primary representative on North America, Canada and Newfoundland to the north, and the Confederate States to the south. In eastern North America, the conflict soon bogs down into trench warfare, while in the West the battle lines are more fluid. Various characters are traced through the war, with several male characters changed forever by their military service. In South America, Chile went to war with Argentina. In this series, the war remains known as \\"The Great War\\" and the term \\"World War\\" never comes into use. When a second war of comparable proportions breaks out twenty years later, it get named \\"The Second Great War\\" and the earlier one becomes retroactively \\"The First Great War\\". =1914: Declaration and invasion= Entente\\" (sometimes referred to as \\"The Allies\\") are depicted in green, the \\"Central Powers\\" in orange, and neutral countries in grey. The Austro-Hungarian Imperial Crown Prince and Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie are both assassinated by a bomb while touring the city of Sarajevo in the newly annexed Austrian province of Bosnia-Herzegovina in June 1914. The Austrian government quickly learns that a Serb group was responsible, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire quickly accuses the government of nearby Serbia of colluding with the terrorists. Tsar Nicholas II of Russia backs Serbia, while Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany backs Austria-Hungary. The major powers of each system mobilize their militaries, effectively signifying their intent to go to war. In August 1914, the \\"Great War\\" begins, initially putting Great Britain, France, and Russia against the Empires of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Across the Atlantic, Democratic President Theodore Roosevelt orders the U.S. military to mobilize in late July, following Germany's lead. In response, Confederate President Woodrow Wilson orders the C.S. military to do the same. Fighting soon breaks out on their common border and the high seas. The United States officially brings the war to North America when Roosevelt declares war on the Confederate States in early August 1914. Confederate President Wilson responds in kind, although he had hoped to avoid a war. Wilson's speech, given in a tightly-packed public square of Richmond, Virginia decorated with statues of southern war heroes George Washington and Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston from the War of Secession, becomes particularly famous. Hoping to emulate General Lee, the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia (ANV) launches a massive invasion of Maryland and Pennsylvania in August, targeting the northern de facto capital of Philadelphia. The ANV quickly overruns the de jure capital of Washington, D.C. and pushes on through Maryland. The U.S. Army takes a different approach and orders the U.S. First Army under Lieutenant General George Custer and the U.S. Second Army under Major General John Pershing to cross the Ohio River and invade Kentucky. Although Confederate resistance is high, especially from river gunboats modeled after the original iron-clad U.S.S. Monitor of the 1860s, the U.S. succeeds in establishing a bridgehead on the southern bank. U.S. forces also invade western Virginia, aiming for the rail junction at Roanoke, Virginia, which comes to be known as \\"Big Lick\\". A separate U.S. invasion of Sonora, intended to capture the Confederacy's sole Pacific Ocean port of Guaymas, soon becomes bogged down. A young army captain named Irving Morrell is wounded in this venture, and spends much of the next six months recuperating in Tucson, New Mexico. (Arizona is part of New Mexico in this timeline.). The U.S. also launches attacks on Canada, specifically in Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. Perhaps the most successful gambit during these early stages of war is the U.S. Navy's capture of the British base at Pearl Harbor in the Sandwich Islands in a surprise attack. =1915: Stalemate and rebellion= Both American offensives soon stall, however; the U.S. armies find it difficult to push south, and the Army of Northern Virginia is slowed by the winter of 1914‚Äì15. The Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania soon grinds to a halt at the Susquehanna River, only 50 miles from Philadelphia. From that high-water‚Äìmark, U.S. forces slowly start to push the Confederates back into Maryland. Although the U.S. forces easily conquer the southern bank of the St. Lawrence River, crossing it proves another matter. The geography of the Niagara Peninsula soon bottlenecks the invading army. Though Winnipeg, Manitoba, as a major rail junction, lies relatively close to the U.S. border, the War Department allocates too few troops to capture it. Trench warfare becomes ubiquitous as each side digs in for protection from machine guns. Troops huddle in these trenches as heavy artillery in their rear pounds the enemy lines night and day. They dread the order \\"Over the top!\\" which means they have to leave the safety of their lines to charge into No man's land, in the hope of capturing the enemy trenches on the other side. The US, drawing on German chemical expertise, seeks to push forward using chemical warfare. The use of chlorine gas, however, makes only minor gains. Far from the quick, glorious conquest each side had imagined, the \\"Great War\\" becomes a long, bloody stalemate. Early in 1915, another front opens when the Utah Mormons attempt to secede from the United States and declare themselves the independent nation of Deseret. Mormon relations with the rest of the country had been hostile since the Utah War of the 1850s and the brief uprising during the Second Mexican War. They wrongly believe that the distracted U.S. government will be unable to subdue them. However, as Utah sits on one of the major transcontinental rail lines, President Roosevelt states the U.S. will not tolerate unlawful rebellion. The Mormon rebellion rages until mid-1916, when it is finally crushed and Salt Lake City is captured. Utah is then placed under military rule by Roosevelt, a situation that will continue until the 1930s. In the autumn of 1915, as the armies of the Confederacy are fighting those of the United States along the border regions, the C.S.A.'s blacks rise up in revolt. Bitter over their treatment by the whites, and fueled by a rhetoric of Marxism and the teachings of Abraham Lincoln, the blacks declare \\"Red Revolution\\" in several areas across the C.S.A. and establish \\"socialist republics,\\" while massacring whites and seeking justice against their former white masters; most trials are shams, however, and the executions brutal. These rebellions are gradually crushed by 1916, although white justice mellows somewhat as thoughts are preoccupied with winning the war. Ironically, the lasting effect of the \\"Red Revolt\\" is to make white people start to believe in the military potential of blacks. On November 2, Vice President Gabriel Semmes (a descendant of naval commander Raphael Semmes) is easily elected president over Radical Liberal candidate Doroteo Arango (AKA Pancho Villa) in the 1915 Confederate States Presidential Election. =1916: Slaughter= Taking advantage of the Confederacy's plight, the U.S. First Army marches into western Tennessee after slogging through western Kentucky, while the C.S. Army of Northern Virginia is pushed south toward Washington. In mid-spring of 1916, a new armored technical advance called the \\"barrel\\" (referred to as a tank by the British, in the story's timeline the latter term never catches on) is introduced to combat for the first time by U.S. forces operating in the Roanoke River Valley of southwestern Virginia. In this case, as in our time line, the name of the vehicle comes from the cover name used. In Britain, those assembling the vehicle were told they were mobile water tanks; in this time line, they are coded 'barrel,' though there is some indication something called a 'barrel' was coming. Private Reginald Bartlett, escaping with a Confederate naval officer, heard U.S. soldiers singing a song, \\"Roll Out the Barrels\\" (not related to our timeline's Czech/Bohemian polka music \\"Rosalinda\\", which became popular in 1938 and was given the English-language lyrics \\"Roll Out the Barrel\\"). While in Tennessee, Lieutenant General Custer transforms his tactics for cavalry into a doctrine for the new barrels (which anticipates the German \\"blitzkrieg\\" tactics of World War II in our time line), but the U.S. War Department is not interested. When Custer's summer offensive begins, tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers are lost attacking Confederate lines, and the new barrels, deployed singly in an infantry support role rather than massed as an armored fist, break down in the hilly terrain to little effect. The lack of British troops in Canada means that the U.S., while initially held back by the Canadians, slowly advances toward their triple objectives of Quebec City, Toronto, and Winnipeg. Largely thanks to the efforts of Irving Morrell, U.S. forces push up to Banff, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies and cut off the second of three mountain passes that connect the Pacific coast to the rest of Canada. At sea, the great Battle of the Three Navies is fought, with the U.S. on one side and the United Kingdom and Japan on the other. This prevents the \\"Entente\\" from recapturing the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii). With the Central Pacific in American hands, a U.S. Navy flotilla makes its way south toward Cape Horn and around to the Atlantic, with the intent of cutting off Argentine grain and beef shipments to Great Britain. On the Maryland front, the state is cleared of Confederate soldiers, save for those holding Washington, the de jure U.S. capital. In the autumn, the U.S. continues to attack Nashville, Tennessee to no avail, raising the possibility of a possible Democratic loss at the polls, and the possibility that a Socialist President will seek peace with the C.S.A. and renounce all the bloody gains. Except for a local attack on the Roanoke Front that pushes the U.S. out of western Virginia, the Confederates stay on the defensive through the autumn, attempting to drain the U.S. dry in the hope that the U.S. population will become sick of the war. Nevertheless, Northern President Theodore Roosevelt easily beats Socialist Eugene V. Debs in the November election. In Richmond, however, the hopes of new President Gabriel Semmes and his Cabinet are dashed. The U.S. government has four years to crush the C.S.A. before needing to seek re-election, while the Confederates are running out of white soldiers to further the conflict. President Semmes successfully proposes a bill to authorize the training and arming of Negro troops to serve, with civil rights (excepting interracial marriage) to follow after the war, including citizenship in the C.S.A. Meanwhile, the U.S. begins the process of formally returning Kentucky to the Union. In Europe, the war seems little changed from our own real timeline, with the exception of the French fortress of Verdun's capture by the Germans, and an apparently heavier use of North African infantry by the French Army. In addition, Italy remains neutral in the conflict and the \\"Easter Rising\\" by the nascent Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Dublin is not put down, spreading to the rest of Ireland, further draining British resources. =1917: Breakthroughs= Lieutenant General Custer secretly develops a scheme for the U.S. to quickly win the war, using a massed-barrel formation, despite its prohibition by the War Department. Disguising his true intentions to all but his adjutant, Major Abner Dowling, and Lieutenant Colonel Irving Morrell, and lying to President Roosevelt, Custer launches his Barrel Roll Offensive on Remembrance Day ‚Äî April 22, 1917 ‚Äî and quickly breaks through the Confederate trench lines north of the Tennessee capital of Nashville. The Confederates withdraw to a line centered on Nashville, where Custer hits them again three weeks later by outflanking the city using a plan concocted by Morrell. Nashville soon falls, despite the best efforts of the newly formed C.S. colored regiments to stave off Custer's barrels, and the state capital becomes the U.S. First Army's headquarters. From Nashville, in July, Custer attacks the C.S. lines in the direction of Murfreesboro. Near Nolensville the U.S. receives a Confederate request for a local armistice. President Roosevelt assents, and peace on the North American front comes to Tennessee a week before the rest of the U.S. ‚Äì C.S. Frontline. Custer is outraged at the halt, but Roosevelt explains that it would be difficult for the U.S.A. to defend the large salient into Tennessee it has captured, and at the same time, the southeastern chunk of Kentucky that still remains in Confederate hands would prove a nuisance in postwar years as Kentuckians elected to the Confederate Congress would constantly demand a new war against the U.S. to recapture lost territory in their state. Roosevelt's plan calls for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from captured Tennessee territory in exchange for all remaining parts of Kentucky. On the same day that the \\"Barrel Roll Offensive\\" began in Tennessee, the U.S. Army in northern Virginia attacks southward toward Manassas at the same time that U.S. troops enter occupied Washington, D.C. The de jure U.S. capital is recaptured after several days of intense street fighting, which levels the city and its famous landmarks (such as the Washington Monument and the White House). In northern Virginia, several U.S. attacks force the C.S. Army of Northern Virginia to retreat south. In battles at Round Hill, Centreville, and Bull Run, rear-guard actions led by a few battered batteries of the \\"First Richmond Howitzers\\" prevent the complete destruction of the latest incarnation of Robert E. Lee's fabled army. However, it is obvious the war is on the verge of being lost; this does not sit well with Confederate soldiers, who reckoned the war won only a few months before. The Confederate States of America started sending peace feelers to Philadelphia as early as the fall of Nashville, but Theodore Roosevelt refused to grant a cease-fire until certain that the C.S.A. was severely hammered elsewhere. The last hammers on the Confederate Army come in late July, when fighting reaches the town of Fredericksburg, Virginia, only fifty miles from the Confederate States capital. With a cease-fire already in effect in Tennessee, Sequoyah is overrun, and fighting in Texas and Arkansas diminishing, the C.S.A. agrees to a general armistice on land and at sea. For the first time since August 1914, the guns fall silent in North America. At sea, the submarine C.S.S. Bonefish, led by Confederate States Navy officer Roger Kimball, carries out a sneak attack on the U.S.S. Ericsson (named for Swedish-born inventor/engineer John Ericsson who developed the iron-clad ships and transformation of naval power during the War of Secession) despite being fully aware of the war's end. For a few years after the war, both the U.S. and C.S. believe that the ship's destruction was the work of the British Royal Navy, the war between the U.S. and the British Empire at sea still not over at this point. In Europe, mutinies in the French Republic Army prove serious enough to lead to France's exit from the war. (In reality, these mutinies ‚Äî caused by French soldiers' disgust at being ordered into suicidal and utterly pointless attacks across \\"no-man's\\" land ‚Äî resulted in the French Army command agreeing to order no more offensives in exchange for French soldiers continuing to fight only defensively until the Hundred Days Offensive.) Without the U.S. troops, this causes France to surrender. The Russian Empire is threatened by revolution and anarchy (similarly to reality), leaving only the Confederate States and Great Britain to fight against the United States, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. Italy remains neutral and the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) lately joins the war on the side of the \\"Central Powers\\". In South America, Brazil abandons the neutrality it had held since the beginning of the War and allies with Chile and Paraguay (who support the \\"Central Powers\\") against Argentina (which supports the \\"Allies\\" (Entente)), threatening the South Atlantic supply line to Britain. In Canada, Custer's barrel methods are used to break through the Anglo-Canadian lines, leading to the fall of Quebec City and Winnipeg. The United States establishes the Republic of Quebec out of the Canadian province, and American and French-speaking \\"Qu√©b√©cois\\" forces charge towards Toronto, Ontario. By this point the C.S. has been defeated, and with all the U.S. soldiers on the U.S. - C.S. Front now ready to head to Canada, the British Empire requests a cease-fire, which is granted in early June 1917. With U.S.‚ÄìGerman-Brazilian naval operations cutting off Great Britain from its Argentine and Australian food suppliers, the United Kingdom sues for peace later that summer; the U.K. was the last opponent of the \\"Quadruple Entente\\" still in the war.

He coined the term \\"concept art\\" in the early 1960s, during which time he was associated with figures in the Fluxus scene. He later received attention for his anti-art demonstrations against New York cultural institutions in 1963 and 1964. Since 1983, he has focused on philosophical writing related to nihilism, science, mathematical logic, economics, and personhood. A number of his archival musical recordings, which fuse hillbilly music with avant-garde techniques, were released in the 2000s. He has collaborated with artists such as C.C. Hennix, La Monte Young, George Maciunas, and John Berndt. Background Henry Flynt was raised in North Carolina and studied classical violin. He became interested in logical positivism as a teenager, and later attended Harvard University on a scholarship, where he studied mathematics alongside later companions Tony Conrad and John Alten. Flynt was introduced to jazz and the \\"New Music\\" of John Cage, and he also discovered country blues music through Samuel Charters's 1959 book on the subject at this time. He soon dropped out and visited New York in 1960, where he was introduced to La Monte Young and other figures in the city's avant-garde scene. Young would dedicate his 1960 composition \\"X for Henry Flynt\\" to him. In 1960 and 1961, Flynt took part in the monthly concert series held at Yoko Ono's Chambers Street loft. Flynt‚Äôs work developed from what he called \\"cognitive nihilism\\", a concept he first announced in the 1960 and 1961 drafts of a paper called Philosophy Proper. The concept derives from insights about the vulnerabilities of logic and mathematics, and aims to turn the principles of scientific positivism and analytical philosophy against themselves. Embracing Rudolf Carnap's empiricism and his positivist critique of metaphysics, Flynt concluded that science itself did not satisfy the syntactical criteria for empirical claims; he therefore set about developing a \\"radical empiricism\\" (or \\"radical unbelief\\") which undermined scientific systematization. Flynt refined these dispensations in the essay Is there language? that was published as Primary Study in 1964. Concept art and activism In 1961 Flynt coined the term \\"concept art\\"The Times literary Supplement, August 6th, 1964, p. 688 \\"Henry Flynt concept art\\" . in the proto-Fluxus book An Anthology of Chance OperationsKristine Stiles & Peter Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 955 (co-published by Jackson Mac Low and La Monte Young) that was released in 1963,Flynt, Henry. \\"Essay: Concept Art. As published in An Anthology of Chance Operations (1963) alongside works by Fluxus artists such as George Brecht and Dick Higgins. Flynt's concept art, he maintained, devolved from cognitive nihilism and described art in which the material was concepts.Henry Flynt, \\"The Crystallization of Concept Art in 1961\\" Drawing exclusively on the syntax of logic and mathematics, concept art was meant to surpass both mathematics and the compositional practices then current in \\"serious\\" art music circles. Flynt maintained that to merit the label concept art, a work had to be an critique of logic or mathematics in which the material is a linguistic concept, a quality which he claims is absent from subsequent \\"conceptual art.\\"Henry Flynt, \\"Concept-Art (1962)\\", Translated and introduced by Nicolas Feuillie, Les presses du r√©el, Avant- gardes, Dijon. In 1962 Flynt began to campaign for an anti-art position.Michel Oren (1993) Anti-Art as the End of Cultural History, Performing Arts Journal, volume 15, issue 2. He advocated that avant-garde art and its institutions be superseded by the terms of veramusement and brend‚Äîneologisms meaning approximately pure recreation. Thus he demonstrated against cultural institutions in New York City (such as MoMA and Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts) with Tony Conrad and Jack Smith in 1963 and against the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen twice in 1964 (accusing Stockhausen of white supremacy and cultural imperialism).Interview with Henry Flynt in The Village Voice, September 10th, 1964, by Susan Goodman, \\"Anti-Art Pickets Pick on Stockhausen\\" . Flynt read publicly from his text From Culture to Veramusment at Walter De Maria's loft on February 28, 1963‚Äîan act which can be considered performance art. In the mid 1960s, Flynt converted himself to Marxism and published the article \\"Communists Must Give Revolutionary Leadership in Culture\\" in collaboration with George Maciunas, criticizing the white supremacist cultural touchstones of the left-wing tradition and championing African-American music. In 1987 he revived his \\"concept art\\" for tactical reasons; and spent seven years in the art world. Music Henry Flynt is known for musical work that attempts to fuse hillbilly music with the avant- garde, often with him performing on violin or guitar. With the exception of the 1981 German cassette You Are My Everlovin'/Celestial Power, Flynt's recordings remained unreleased until the 21st century, via labels such as Recorded and Locust.Kristine Stiles & Peter Selz, Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 956 Other influences included the free jazz of Ornette Coleman; rockabilly and country blues music; and the North Indian classical music he learned with singer Pandit Pran Nath. Flynt performed duets with La Monte Young in the 1960s, but recordings of these performances were rejected by Mainstream Records employee Earle Brown as being too unconventional for a classical label. In an early 1960s conversation with John Cage, Flynt announced his intention to abandon \\"serious\\" modern composition and pursue music in the style of rock artists like Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry. Flynt briefly performed violin with the Velvet Underground in 1966 as a fill-in for John Cale, and received guitar lessons from Lou Reed. In 1966, he recorded several rehearsal demo tapes with Walter De Maria and others in the garage rock band the Insurrections, which were later compiled and released in 2004 on Locust Music as I Don't Wanna.Cope.

Pitchfork Music Festival.com. Feb. 19, 2004. http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3288-i-dont-wanna-with-the-insurrections/ In 1974 and 1975, Flynt led the group Nova'Billy and recorded material spanning rock, jazz, country, and funk that was later collected on Henry Flynt & Nova'Billy (Locust, 2007). With Catherine Christer Hennix, Flynt formed the jazz-rock group Dharma Warriors in 1978, initially including Arthur Russell on keyboard. Dharma Warriors (Locust, 2008) showcases another meeting between Hennix & Flynt recorded in 1980 in Woodstock, New York. Purified by the Fire, recorded in December 1981, features Hennix on tamboura and Flynt on electric violin and was released in 2005 on Locust. Flynt's first CD release was a reissue of You Are My Everlovin'/Celestial Power on Recorded (curated by John Berndt, and initiating the New American Ethnic Music series on that label), quickly followed by Spindizzy and Hillbilly Tape Music also on Recorded. Later Recorded released NAEM 4, Ascent to The Sun. Recently, Flynt's Glissando No. 1 was published by Recorded (2010). Philosophy Flynt's early philosophical writing, including the 1961 draft of Philosophy Proper, was published in Milan in the book Blueprint for a Higher Civilization (1975). Deriving broadly from his early arguments around \\"cognitive nihilism,\\" Flynt's work aims to overturn the dogmatic scientism and apparent coherence of contemporary scientific and mathematical discourse. In the early 1970s, he returned to college to study communist economics. In the late 1970s, he organized several meetings on the \\"crisis in physics\\" in an attempt to identify the areas where modern science represses incoherent or irrational logics in order to propagate its \\"objective\\" worldview. From about 1980, Flynt has written on philosophy and economics in mostly unpublished papers, focusing on two concepts which did not achieve the notoriety of the early actions: his concepts of meta- technologyHenry Flynt, \\"Lessons in Meta-Technology\\" and personhood theory.Henry Flynt, \\"Personhood Theory: A Sketch\\" These concepts continue his work in sketching a worldview which would supersede scientific objectification. Much of his writing is now available on his website. Relationship with Fluxus Because of his friendship and collaboration with La Monte Young and George Maciunas, Flynt sometimes gets linked to Fluxus. While Flynt himself describes Fluxus as his \\"publisher of last resort\\" (Flynt did permit Fluxus to publish his work, and took part in several Fluxus exhibitions) he claims no affiliation or interest in the Fluxus sensibility. In fact, he is a strong critic of the neo-Dada sensibility.Owen Smith (1998) Fluxus: The History of an Attitude, San Diego State University Press.

Biography Michaud was born at Albens, Savoie, educated at Bourg-en-Bresse, and afterwards engaged in literary work at Lyon, where the French Revolution first aroused the strong dislike of revolutionary principles which manifested itself throughout the rest of his life. In 1791 he went to Paris, where, at great risk to his own safety, he took part in editing several royalist journals. One of those was the Gazette universelle that he founded together with Pascal Boyer and Antoine Marie Cerisier. It was very successful until it was suppressed in August 1792 and its editors had to flee to escape arrest.Favre, R., Antoine Cerisier (1749-1828) in Dictionnaire des Journalistes (1600-1789), page 157 In 1796 he became editor of La Quotidienne, for which he was arrested after the 13th of Vend√©miaire; he evaded his captors, but was sentenced to death in absentia by the military council. Having resumed the editorship of his newspaper on the establishment of the Directory, he was again proscribed on the 18th of Fructidor, but after two years returned to Paris, when the Consulate had superseded the Directory. Viaggio in Grecia ed a Smirne, 1834 His Bourbon sympathies led to a brief imprisonment in 1800, and on his release he temporarily abandoned journalism, and began to write and edit books. In 1806, with his brother Louis Gabriel Michaud and two colleagues, he published Biographie moderne ou dictionnaire des hommes qui se sont fait un nom en Europe, depuis 1789, the earliest work of its kind. In 1811 published the first volume of his Histoire des Croisades (History of the Crusades) and also the first volume of his Biographie Universelle. In 1813 he was elected Academician, taking up the vacancy left by the death of Jean-Fran√ßois Cailhava de L'Estandoux. In 1814 he resumed the editorship of La Quotidienne. His brochure Histoire des quinze semaines ou le dernier r√®gne de Bonaparte (1815) met with extraordinary success, passing through twenty-seven editions within a very short time. His political services were now rewarded with the cross of an officer in the Legion of Honour and the modest post of king's reader, of which last he was deprived in 1827 for having opposed Peyronnet's \\"Loi d'Amour\\" against the freedom of the Press. In 1830-1831 he travelled in Syria and Egypt for the purpose of collecting additional materials for the Histoire des Croisades; his correspondence with a fellow explorer, Jean Joseph Fran√ßois Poujoulat, consisting practically of discussions and elucidations of various points in that work, was afterwards published (', 7 vols., 1833-1835). Like the Histoire, it is more interesting than exact. The Biblioth√®que des croisades, in four volumes more, contained the \\"Pi√®ces justificatives\\" of the Histoire. Michaud died at Passy, where his home had been since 1832. Works \\"The Death of Baldwin\\" (1875), one of 100 plates prepared for a posthumous edition of Michaud's History of the Crusades by Gustave Dor√© Michaud's Histoire des croisades was published in its final form in six volumes in 1840 under the editorship of his friend Jean Joseph Fran√ßois Poujoulat (9th ed., with appendix, by Huillard-Br√©holles, 1856). Michaud, along with Poujoulat, also edited Nouvelle collection des m√©moires pour servir de l'histoire de France (32 vols., 1836-1844). See Sainte-Beuve, Causeries du lundi, vol. vii. In 1875, the famous illustrator Gustave Dor√© produced 100 pictures for a 2 volume medium folio edition of the Histoire which was published by Hachette and Company.

At night, they fly to light sources, but they usually land slightly away from the light.The caterpillars are gray with a reddish tint and begin feeding in May and end in June. The adult feeds on nectar, the larva eat willow and poplar leaves.They pupate well hidden between spun leaves.Hibernation is as an egg. This species and other Catocala moths have brightly coloured underwings, in this case orange, red, or pink. These are not visible at rest, being hidden by the dull forewings, but they help the moth avoid predators such as birds if it is disturbed during the day. As the red underwing moth takes off, the sudden flash of colour may confuse the attacker, and when it lands and immediately closes its wings it may seem to disappear as the colour is \\"switched off\\". It is also thought that the symmetrical patterned orange sections on the rear wings form the illusion of another smaller creature (butterfly), so the attacker will go for the colourful \\"small illusive\\" rear safe region on the main body of this red underwing moth species.

Early life Rohan was born at the Ch√¢teau de Blain (now a part of Blain, Loire-Atlantique), in Brittany. His father was Ren√© II, viscount of Rohan (1550‚Äì1586), and head of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in France, which was connected with many of the reigning houses of Europe.Louis XIV, and the Court of France in the Seventeenth Century: In Three Volumes (Volume 1) by Julia Pardoe (Bentley, 1847) He was educated by his mother, Catherine de Parthenay, who was a woman of exceptional learning and force of character. Henri was by birth the second son, but when his elder brother Ren√© died young he became the heir of the name. He appeared at court and in the army at the age of sixteen, and was a special favourite with Henry IV, after whom, failing the House of Cond√©, he might be said to be the natural chief of the French Protestants. Having served till the Peace of Vervins, he travelled for a considerable time over Europe, including England and Scotland, in the first of which countries he received the not unique honour of being called by Elizabeth I her knight, while in the second he was godfather at Charles I's christening. Military career On his return to France Henri was made duke and peer at the age of twenty-four. From 1593 onward, there had been negotiations of marriage between him and the Swedish princess Catherine, but in 1603, however, he married Marguerite de B√©thune, the duc de Sully's daughter, and transferred the Rohan family seat from Josselin Castle to Pontivy. He served in high command at the celebrated siege of J√ºlich in 1610, but soon afterwards he fell into active or passive opposition to the government over the religious disputes. For a time, however, he abstained from actual insurrection, and he endeavoured to keep on terms with Marie de Medici; he even, despite his dislike of De Luynes, the favourite of Louis XIII, reappeared in the army and fought in Lorraine and Piedmont. Henri, duc de Rohan (1579-1638). It was not till the decree for the restitution of church property in the south threw the Bearnese and Gascons into open revolt that Henri appeared as a rebel. His authority and military skill were very formidable to the royalists; his constancy and firmness greatly contributed to the happy issue of the war for the Huguenots, and brought about the Treaty of Montpellier (1622). But Henri did not escape the results of the incurable factiousness which showed itself more strongly perhaps among the French Huguenots than among any other of the numerous armed oppositions of the 17th century. He was accused of luke-warmness and treachery, though he did not hesitate to renew the war when the compact of Montpellier was broken.The French Wars of Religion, 1562-1629 by Mack P. Holt (Cambridge University Press, 2005) Also during this time in the 1620s, Henri was responsible for considerable damage to the ancient Roman aqueduct bridge Pont du Gard while using it to transport his army across. To make space for his artillery, he had one side of the second row of arches of the ancient structure cut away to only two thirds of their original width, severely weakening the aqueduct bridge.Rennie, George (1855). \\"Description of the Pont du Gard\\". Minutes of proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers 14: 238. Again a hollow peace was patched up, but it lasted but a short time, and Henri undertook a third war (1627‚Äì1629), the first events of which are recounted in his celebrated Memoirs. This last war (famous for the defence of La Rochelle by Benjamin de Rohan-Soubise, Henri's younger brother) was one of considerable danger for Henri. In spite of all efforts he had in the end to sign a peace, and after this he made his way quickly to Venice. Here he is said to have received from the Porte the offer of the sovereignty of Cyprus. It is more certain that his hosts of Venice wished to make him their general-in-chief, a design not executed owing to the Treaty of Cherasco (1631). At Venice he wrote his Memoirs; at Padua, Le Parfait Capitaine. However, when France began to play a more conspicuous part in the Thirty Years' War, Henri was again called to serve his lawful sovereign, and entrusted with the war in the Valtellina. The campaign of 1633 was completely successful, but Henri was still considered dangerous to France, and was soon again in retirement. At this time he wrote his Trait√© du gouvernement des treize cantons. Title page of a German 1645 enhanced translation of Rohan's De l'interest des princes et estats de la chrestient√©, 1639. Henri fought another Valtelline campaign, but without the success of the first, for the motives of France were now held in suspicion. The unfortunate commander retired to Geneva and thence went to the army of Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar. He received a mortal wound at the Battle of Rheinfelden on 28 February 1638, and died at the abbey of Konigsfeld, canton Bern, on 13 April. His body was buried at Geneva, and his arms were solemnly handed over to the Venetian government. With his daughter Marguerite the honours of the family of Rohan-Gi√© passed to the house of Chabot. His grand daughter Anne de Rohan-Chabot married into the Rohans and was princesse de Soubise in her own right. Writings The tomb in the St. Pierre Cathedral Henri's M√©moires sur les choses qui se sont pass√©es en France, etc., rank amongst the best products of the singular talent for memoir writing which the French noblesse of the 16th and 17th centuries possessed. Alike in style, in clearness of matter and in shrewdness, they deserve very high praise. The first three books, dealing with the civil wars, appeared in 1644; the fourth, containing the narrative of the Valtelline campaigns, not till 1758. Some suspicions were expressed about the genuineness of the latter, but, it would seem, groundlessly. His famous book on the history and art of war, Le Parfait Capitaine, appeared in 1631 and subsequently in 1637 and 1693. (See also Quincy, Art de la guerre, Paris, 1741). It treats of the history and lessons of Caesar's campaigns and their application to modern warfare, and contains appendices dealing with phalangite and legionary methods of fighting and the art of war in general. He also wrote an account of his travels, the book on Switzerland mentioned above, De l'int√©r√™t des princes et √âtats de la chr√©tient√©, etc. The Memoirs may be conveniently found in the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat, vol. 19.The memoires of the Duke of Rohan or A faithful relation of the most remarkable occurrences in France: especially concerning those of the reformed churches there. by Henri, Duke of Rohan (1660) See Fauvelet de Foix, Histoire du Duc Henri de Rohan (Paris, 1667); Schybergson, Le Duc de Rohan et la charte du parti protestant en France (Paris, 1880); Buhring, Venedig, Gustaf Adolf, und Rohan (Halle, 1885); Laugel, Henri de Rohan, son r√¥le politique et militaire (Paris, 1889); Veraguth, Herzog Rohan und seine Mission in Graubilnden (Bern, 1894); and Shadwell, Mountain Warfare.

It was considered the largest family in Lepidoptera for a long time, but after regrouping Lymantriinae, Catocalinae and Calpinae within the family Erebidae, the latter holds this title now. Currently, Noctuidae is the second largest family in Noctuoidea, with about 1,089 genera and 11,772 species. However, this classification is still contingent, as more changes continue to appear between Noctuidae and Erebidae. Description left Adult: Most noctuid adults have drab wings, but some subfamilies such as Acronictinae and Agaristinae are very colorful, especially those from tropical regions (e.g. Baorisa hieroglyphica). They are characterized by a structure in the metathorax called the nodular sclerite or epaulette, which separates the tympanum and the conjunctiva in the tympanal organ. It functions to keep parasites (Acari) out of the tympanal cavity. Another characteristic in this group is trifine hindwing venation, by reduction or absence of the second medial vein (M2). Larva: Commonly green or brown; however, some species present bright colors, such as the camphorweed cucullia moth (Cucullia alfarata). Most are pudgy and smooth with rounded short heads and few setae, but there are some exceptions in some subfamilies (e.g. Acronictinae and Pantheinae). Pupa: The pupae most often range from shiny brown to dark brown. When they newly pupate they are bright brownish orange, but after a few days start to get darker. Eggs: Vary in colors, but all have a spherical shape. Etymology The word Noctuidae is derived from the name of the type genus Noctua, which is the Latin name for the little owl, and the patronymic suffix -idae used typically to form taxonomic family names in animals. The common name \\"owlet\\" originally means a small or young owl. The names \\"armyworms\\" and \\"cutworms\\" are based on the behavior of the larvae of this group, which can occur in destructive swarms and cut the stems of plants. Ecology =Distribution and diversity= 202x202px This family is cosmopolitan and can be found worldwide except in the Antarctic region. However, some species such as the setaceous Hebrew character (Xestia c-nigrum) can be found in the Arctic Circle, specifically in the Yukon territory of western Canada, with an elevation 1,702 m above sea level, where the temperature fluctuates between 23/-25 ¬∞C (73/-13 ¬∞F). Many species of dart moths have been recorded in elevations as high as 4,000 m above sea level (e.g. Xestia elisabetha). Among the places where the number of species has been counted are North America and northern Mexico, with about 2,522 species. 1,576 species are found in Europe, while the other species are distributed worldwide. =Mutualism= A Lychnis moth caterpillar feeding on the seeds of red campion (255x255px Members of Noctuidae, like other butterflies and moths, perform an important role in plant pollination. However, some species have developed a stronger connection with their host plants. For example, the lychnis moth (Hadena bicruris) has a strange mutualistic relationship with pink plants or carnation plants (Caryophyllaceae), in that larvae feed on the plant while the adults pollinate the flowers. The eight-spotted forester moth (213x213px =Food guilds= Herbivory: Caterpillars of most Noctuidae feed on plants; some feed on poisonous plants and are unaffected by their chemical defences; for example, the splendid brocade moth (Lacanobia splendens) feeds on cowbane (Cicuta virosa), a plant that is notoriously toxic to vertebrates. Predation and cannibalism: During the larval stage, some cutworms readily feed on other insects. One such species is the shivering pinion (Lithophane querquera), whose larvae commonly feed on other lepidopteran larvae. Moreover, many noctuid larvae, such as those of the fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and of genera such as Heliothis and Helicoverpa, aggressively eat their siblings and often other species of caterpillar. Nectarivory and puddling: Like many Lepidoptera, many species of adult Noctuidae visit flowers for their nectar. They also seek other liquid food resources such as plant juices, honeydew, dung, urea and mud, among others. As is common in members of the order Lepidoptera, courtship in many Noctuidae includes a set of movements in which the female evaluates the male's reproductive fitness. Most noctuid moths produce pheromones that attract the opposite gender. Female pheromones that attract males occur widely and have long been studied, but the study of male pheromones has further to go. =Reproduction= Lesser yellow underwing Noctuid moths commonly begin the reproductive season from spring to fall, and mostly are multivoltine, such as the eastern panthea moth (Panthea furcilla), which reproduces over the year. Nevertheless, some species have just one brood of offspring (univoltine); among the best known is the lesser yellow underwing (Noctua comes). =Defense= The Spanish moth feeding on Amaryllis sp. This group has a wide range of both chemical and physical defenses. Among the chemical defenses three types stand out. First, the pyrrolizidine alkaloid sequestration usually present in Arctiinae is also found in a few species of noctuids, including the Spanish moth (Xanthopastis timais). Another chemical defense is formic acid production, which was thought to be present only in Notodontidae, but later was found in caterpillars of Trachosea champa. Finally, the last type of chemical defense is regurgitation of plant compounds, often used by many insects, but the cabbage palm caterpillar (Litoprosopus futilis) produces a toxin called toluquinone that deters predators. On the other hand, the main physical defense in caterpillars and adults alike is mimicry. Most owlet moths have drab colors with a variety of patterns suitable to camouflage their bodies. The second physical defense consists in thousands of secondary setae that surround the body. The subfamilies that present this mechanism are Pantheinae and Acronictinae. The third is aposematism, represented by species of Cucullinae. Finally, all adults have another mechanism for defense: a tympanal organ available to hear the echolocation spread out by bats, so the moths can avoid them. Human importance The Old World bollworm caterpillar feeding on a strawberry. =Agriculture= Many species of owlet moths are considered an agricultural problem around the world. Their larvae are typically known as \\"cutworms\\" or \\"armyworms\\" due to enormous swarms that destroy crops, orchards and gardens every year. The Old World bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera) produces losses in agriculture every year that exceed US$2 billion. Additionally, the variegated cutworm (Peridroma saucia) is described by many as one of the most damaging pests to vegetables. Systematics Since molecular analysis began to play a larger role in systematics, the structure of many Lepidoptera groups has been changing and Noctuidae is not an exception. Most recent studies have shown that Noctuidae sensu stricto is a monophyletic group, mainly based on trifine venation. However, there are some clades within Noctuidae sensu lato that have to be studied. This taxonomic division represent the subfamilies, tribes and subtribes considered so far. * Family Noctuidae Latreille, 1809 ** Subfamily Plusiinae Boisduval, [1828] *** Tribe Abrostolini Eichlin & Cunningham, 1978 *** Tribe Argyrogrammatini Eichlin & Cunningham, 1978 *** Tribe Plusiini Boisduval, [1828] **** Subtribe Autoplusiina Kitching, 1987 **** Subtribe Euchalciina Chou & Lu, 1979 **** Subtribe Plusiina Boisduval, [1828] ** Subfamily Bagisarinae Crumb, 1956 *** Tribe Cydosiini Kitching & Rawlins, [1998] ** Subfamily Eustrotiinae Grote, 1882 ** Subfamily Acontiinae Guen√©e, 1841 *** Tribe Acontiini Guen√©e, 1841 ** Subfamily Pantheinae Smith, 1898 ** Subfamily Dilobinae Aurivillius, 1889 ** Subfamily Balsinae Grote, 1896 ** Subfamily Acronictinae Heinemann, 1859 ** Subfamily Metoponiinae Herrich- Sch√§ffer, [1851]Calophasia lunula, caterpillar ** Subfamily Cuculliinae Herrich-Sch√§ffer, [1850] ** Subfamily Amphipyrinae Guen√©e, 1837 *** Tribe Amphipyrini Guen√©e, 1837 *** Tribe Psaphidini Grote, 1896 **** Subtribe Psaphidina Grote, 1896 **** Subtribe Feraliina Poole, 1995 **** Subtribe Nocloina Poole, 1995 **** Subtribe Triocnemidina Poole, 1995 *** Tribe Stiriini Grote, 1882 **** Subtribe Azeniina **** Subtribe Stiriina Grote, 1882 **** Subtribe Grotellina Poole, 1995 **** Subtribe Annaphilina Mustelin, 2006 ** Subfamily Oncocnemidinae Forbes & Franclemont, 1954 ** Subfamily Agaristinae Herrich-Sch√§ffer, [1858] ** Subfamily Condicinae Poole, 1995 *** Tribe Condicini Poole, 1995 *** Tribe Leuconyctini Poole, 1995 ** Subfamily Heliothinae Boisduval, [1828] ** Subfamily Eriopinae Herrich-Sch√§ffer, [1851] ** Subfamily Bryophilinae Guen√©e, 1852 ** Subfamily Noctuinae Latreille, 1809 *** Tribe Actinotiini Beck, 1996 *** Tribe Arzamini Grote, 1883 *** Tribe Dypterygiini Forbes, 1954 *** Tribe Glottulini Guen√©e, 1852 *** Tribe Leucaniini Guen√©e, 1837 *** Tribe Noctuini Latreille, 1809 **** Subtribe Agrotina Rambur, 1848 **** Subtribe Noctuina Latreille, 1809 *** Tribe Pseudeustrotiini Beck, 1996 *** Tribe Phosphilini Poole, 1995 *** Tribe Prodeniini Forbes, 1954 *** Tribe Phlogophorini Hampson, 1918 *** Tribe Tholerini Beck, 1996 ** Subfamily Hadeninae Guen√©e, 1837 *** Tribe Apameini Guen√©e, 1841 *** Tribe Caradrinini Boisduval, 1840 **** Subtribe Caradrinina Boisduval, 1840 **** Subtribe Athetiina Fibiger & Lafontaine, 2005 *** Tribe Elaphriini Beck, 1996 *** Tribe Eriopygini Fibiger & Lafontaine, 2005 *** Tribe Hadenini Guen√©e, 1837 *** Tribe Ipimorphini *** Tribe Mythimnini *** Tribe Orthosiini Guen√©e, 1837 *** Tribe Xylenini Guen√©e, 1837 **** Subtribe Xylenina Guen√©e, 1837 **** Subtribe Cosmiina Guen√©e, 1852 **** Subtribe Antitypina Forbes & Franclemont, 1954 **** Subtribe Ufeina Crumb, 1956 ** Subfamily Raphiinae Beck, 1996 ** Subfamily Eucocytiinae Hampson, 1918 Genera with intervening taxonomy not available include: * Alastria * Epilitha * Fabula * Lanatopyga * Lenisa * Neoligia * Orohadena * Orthomoia * Protapamea * Proxenus * Pseudluperina References External links *On University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences Featured Creatures web site: ** Agrotis ipsilon, black cutworm ** Diphthera festiva, hieroglyphic moth ** Litoprosopus futilis , cabbage palm caterpillar ** Pseudaletia unipuncta, true armyworm ** Spodoptera eridania, southern armyworm ** Spodoptera frugiperda, fall armyworm ** Spodoptera ornithogalli, yellowstriped armyworm ** Xanthopastis timais, Spanish moth or convict caterpillar * Images of Noctuidae species in New Zealand Moth families ","title":"Noctuidae"},{"id":"293266","text":"Soubise lost control of the island of R√© following the Siege of Saint-Martin- de-R√© (1625). Benjamin de Rohan, duc de Soubise (1580‚Äì1642), was a French Huguenot leader. Son of Ren√© II, Viscount of Rohan, and younger brother of Henri de Rohan, he inherited the lordship of Soubise through his mother Catherine de Parthenay. He served his apprenticeship as a soldier under Maurice of Nassau in the Low Countries. In the religious wars from 1621 onwards his elder brother chiefly commanded on land and in the south, Soubise in the west and along the sea-coast. His exploits in the conflict have been sympathetically related by his brother, one of the most highly regarded military critics of the time. Soubise's chief exploit was a singularly bold and well-conducted attack (in 1625) on the Royalist fleet in the river Blavet (which included the cutting of a boom in the face of superior numbers) and the occupation of the islands of R√© and Ol√©ron in 1625, leading to the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-R√© (1625) in which Louis XIII recovered the island of R√©. He commanded at La Rochelle during the famous Siege of La Rochelle (1627‚Äì1628). According to his brother, the failure of the defence and of the English attack on √éle de R√© was mainly due to the alternate obstinacy of the townsfolk and the English commanders in refusing to listen to Soubise's advice. When surrender became inevitable he fled to England, which he had previously visited in quest of succour. He died in 1642 in London. No such title as \\"Duke of Soubise\\" ever existed in France. The title, prince de Soubise was later borne by a cadet branch of the House of Rohan, which inherited the secundogeniture of Soubise from a Rohan-Chabot heiress, a descendant in the female line of Henri, 1st Duke of Rohan. The princes de Soubise did not descend from Benjamin, who never bore that title. Nor did he ever receive the dukedom of Frontenay, although that title, too, is sometimes mistakenly attributed to him.

In 1619, the king made him Duke of Luynes and a Peer of France, and in 1621, Constable of France. Luynes died of scarlet fever near the end of that year at the height of his influence. Biography The first duke of Luynes He was the first son of Honor√© d'Albert (1540‚Äì1592), seigneur de Luynes (in today's d√©partement Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne in Provence), who was in the service of the three last Valois kings and of Henry IV of France. Charles was brought up at court and attended the dauphin, later Louis XIII. The king shared his fondness for hunting and rapidly advanced him in favour. In 1615 he was appointed commander of the Louvre Palace and counsellor, and the following year Grand Falconer of France. He used his influence over the king in the court intrigues against the queen- mother Marie de' Medici and her favourite Concini. It was Luynes who, with Vitry, captain of the guard, arranged the plot that ended in Concini's assassination (1617) and secured all the latter's possessions in Italy and France. In the same year he was appointed captain of the Bastille and lieutenant-general of Normandy, and married Marie de Rohan, daughter of the Duke of Montbazon. He employed extreme measures against the pamphleteers of the time, but sought peace in Italy and with the Protestants. In August 1619 he negotiated the Treaty of Angoul√™me by which Marie de' Medici was accorded complete liberty. The same month he was made governor of Picardy and Duke of Luynes. He had recently purchased the Comt√© de Maill√© on the Loire, about 10 miles west of Tours, and the king erected Maill√© into the Duchy of Luynes, which included about 50 parishes and extended to the western wall of Tours and around it on three sides. On 14 November he was officially received as a duke and a Peer of France at a ceremony in the great hall of the Parlement of Paris. His rapid rise to power made him a host of enemies, who looked upon him as but a second Concini. He suppressed an uprising of nobles in 1620. In 1621, at the king's request, Luynes agreed to lead an expedition against the Protestants in the southwest, even though Luynes had for a long time been opposed to the campaign. As part of the agreement, Louis appointed him Constable of France, even though Luynes had slight military ability or achievement. He was sworn in on 2 April. Luynes received the post in part by default: the obvious choice, the Duke of Lesdigui√®res, was a Protestant and refused to abjure. Later, after Luynes's death, Lesdigui√®res converted and became constable. Luynes was involved in the failure of the Siege of Montauban (17 August ‚Äì 2 November), for which he received much criticism, although he had not been the field commander. On 15 December 1621, in the midst of the campaign, Luynes died of scarlet fever, aged 43, at Ch√¢teau de Longueville in Guienne. Family His brother Honor√© d'Albert (1581‚Äì1649), first duke of Chaulnes, was governor of Picardy and Marshal of France (1619), and defended his province successfully in 1625 and 1635.

While definitions vary, a heat wave is usually measured relative to the usual weather in the area and relative to normal temperatures for the season. Temperatures that people from a hotter climate consider normal can be called a heat wave in a cooler area if they are outside the normal climate pattern for that area. The term is applied both to hot weather variations and to extraordinary spells of hot which may occur only once a century. Severe heat waves have caused catastrophic crop failures, thousands of deaths from hyperthermia, and widespread power outages due to increased use of air conditioning. A heat wave is considered extreme weather that can be a natural disaster, and a danger because heat and sunlight may overheat the human body. Heat waves can usually be detected using forecasting instruments so that a warning call can be issued.  Definitions  A definition based on Frich et al.'s Heat Wave Duration Index is that a heat wave occurs when the daily maximum temperature of more than five consecutive days exceeds the average maximum temperature by , the normal period being 1961‚Äì1990. A formal, peer- reviewed definition from the Glossary of Meteorology is: : A period of abnormally and uncomfortably hot and usually humid weather. :: To be a heat wave such a period should last at least one day, but conventionally it lasts from several days to several weeks. In 1900, A. T. Burrows more rigidly defined a \\"hot wave\\" as a spell of three or more days on each of which the maximum shade temperature reaches or exceeds . More realistically, the comfort criteria for any one region are dependent upon the normal conditions of that area. The World Meteorological Organization, defines a heat wave as 5 or more consecutive days of prolonged heat in which the daily maximum temperature is higher than the average maximum temperature by 5 ¬∞C (9 ¬∞F) or more. However, some nations have come up with their own criteria to define a heat wave.Temperature anomalies, March to May 2007 In the Netherlands, a heat wave is defined as a period of at least 5 consecutive days in which the maximum temperature in De Bilt exceeds , provided that on at least 3 days in this period the maximum temperature in De Bilt exceeds . This definition of a heat wave is also used in Belgium and Luxembourg. In Denmark, a national heat wave (hedeb√∏lge) is defined as a period of at least 3 consecutive days of which period the average maximum temperature across more than fifty percent of the country exceeds ‚Äì the Danish Meteorological Institute further defines a \\"warmth wave\\" (varmeb√∏lge) when the same criteria are met for a temperature, while in Sweden, a heat wave is defined as at least 5 days in a row with a daily high exceeding . In the United States, definitions also vary by region; however, a heat wave is usually defined as a period of at least two or more days of excessively hot weather. In the Northeast, a heat wave is typically defined as three consecutive days where the temperature reaches or exceeds , but not always as this ties in with humidity levels to determine a heat index threshold. The same does not apply to drier climates. A heat storm is a Californian term for an extended heat wave. Heat storms occur when the temperature reaches for three or more consecutive days over a wide area (tens of thousands of square miles). The National Weather Service issues heat advisories and excessive heat warnings when unusual periods of hot weather are expected. In Adelaide, South Australia, a heat wave is defined as five consecutive days at or above , or three consecutive days at or over . The Australian Bureau of Meteorology defines a heat wave as \\"three days or more of maximum and minimum temperatures that are unusual for the location\\". Until the introduction of this new Pilot Heatwave Forecast there was no national definition that described heatwave or measures of heatwave severity. In the United Kingdom, the Met Office operates a Heat Health Watch system which places each Local Authority region into one of four levels. Heatwave conditions are defined by the maximum daytime temperature and minimum nighttime temperature rising above the threshold for a particular region. The length of time spent above that threshold determines the particular level. Level 1 is normal summer conditions. Level 2 is reached when there is a 60% or higher risk that the temperature will be above the threshold levels for two days and the intervening night. Level 3 is triggered when the temperature has been above the threshold for the preceding day and night, and there is a 90% or higher chance that it will stay above the threshold in the following day. Level 4 is triggered if conditions are more severe than those of the preceding three levels. Each of the first three levels is associated with a particular state of readiness and response by the social and health services, and Level 4 is associated with more widespread response. A more general indicator that allows comparing heat waves in different regions of the World, characterized by different climates, has been recently developed. This was used to estimate heat waves occurrence at the global scale from 1901 to 2010, finding a substantial and sharp increase in the amount of affected areas in the last two decades. border  Formation  High pressure in the upper atmosphere traps heat near the ground, forming a heat waveHeat waves form when high pressure aloft (from ) strengthens and remains over a region for several days up to several weeks. This is common in summer (in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres) as the jet stream 'follows the sun'. On the equator side of the jet stream, in the upper layers of the atmosphere, is the high pressure area. Summertime weather patterns are generally slower to change than in winter. As a result, this upper level high pressure also moves slowly. Under high pressure, the air subsides (sinks) toward the surface, warming and drying adiabatically, inhibiting convection and preventing the formation of clouds. Reduction of clouds increases shortwave radiation reaching the surface. A low pressure at the surface leads to surface wind from lower latitudes that brings warm air, enhancing the warming. Alternatively, the surface winds could blow from the hot continental interior towards the coastal zone, leading to heat waves there, or from a high elevation towards low elevation, enhancing the subsidence and therefore the adiabatic warming. In the Eastern United States a heat wave can occur when a high pressure system originating in the Gulf of Mexico becomes stationary just off the Atlantic Seaboard (typically known as a Bermuda High). Hot humid air masses form over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea while hot dry air masses form over the desert Southwest and northern Mexico. The SW winds on the back side of the High continue to pump hot, humid Gulf air northeastward resulting in a spell of hot and humid weather for much of the Eastern States. In the Western Cape Province of South Africa, a heat wave can occur when a low pressure offshore and high pressure inland air combine to form a Bergwind. The air warms as it descends from the Karoo interior, and the temperature will rise about 10 ¬∞C from the interior to the coast. Humidities are usually very low, and the temperatures can be over 40 ¬∞C in summer. The highest official temperatures recorded in South Africa (51.5 ¬∞C) was recorded one summer during a bergwind occurring along the Eastern Cape coastline. Global warming boosts the probability of extreme weather events, like heat waves, far more than it boosts more moderate events.Global Warming Makes Heat Waves More Likely, Study Finds 10 July 2012 NYT  Health effects  The heat index (as shown in the table above) is a measure of how hot it feels when relative humidity is factored with the actual air temperature. Hyperthermia, also known as heat stroke, becomes commonplace during periods of sustained high temperature and humidity. Older adults, very young children, and those who are sick or overweight are at a higher risk for heat-related illness. The chronically ill and elderly are often taking prescription medications (e.g., diuretics, anticholinergics, antipsychotics, and antihypertensives) that interfere with the body's ability to dissipate heat. Heat edema presents as a transient swelling of the hands, feet, and ankles and is generally secondary to increased aldosterone secretion, which enhances water retention. When combined with peripheral vasodilation and venous stasis, the excess fluid accumulates in the dependent areas of the extremities. The heat edema usually resolves within several days after the patient becomes acclimated to the warmer environment. No treatment is required, although wearing support stockings and elevating the affected legs will help minimize the edema. Heat rash, also known as prickly heat, is a maculopapular rash accompanied by acute inflammation and blocked sweat ducts. The sweat ducts may become dilated and may eventually rupture, producing small pruritic vesicles on an erythematous base. Heat rash affects areas of the body covered by tight clothing. If this continues for a duration of time it can lead to the development of chronic dermatitis or a secondary bacterial infection. Prevention is the best therapy. It is also advised to wear loose- fitting clothing in the heat. However, once heat rash has developed, the initial treatment involves the application of chlorhexidine lotion to remove any desquamated skin. The associated itching may be treated with topical or systemic antihistamines. If infection occurs a regimen of antibiotics is required. The 1936 North American heat wave. Record temperatures were based on 112-year records Heat cramps are painful, often severe, involuntary spasms of the large muscle groups used in strenuous exercise. Heat cramps tend to occur after intense exertion. They usually develop in people performing heavy exercise while sweating profusely and replenishing fluid loss with non- electrolyte containing water. This is believed to lead to hyponatremia that induces cramping in stressed muscles. Rehydration with salt-containing fluids provides rapid relief. Patients with mild cramps can be given oral .2% salt solutions, while those with severe cramps require IV isotonic fluids. The many sport drinks on the market are a good source of electrolytes and are readily accessible. Heat syncope is related to heat exposure that produces orthostatic hypotension. This hypotension can precipitate a near-syncopal episode. Heat syncope is believed to result from intense sweating, which leads to dehydration, followed by peripheral vasodilation and reduced venous blood return in the face of decreased vasomotor control. Management of heat syncope consists of cooling and rehydration of the patient using oral rehydration therapy (sport drinks) or isotonic IV fluids. People who experience heat syncope should avoid standing in the heat for long periods of time. They should move to a cooler environment and lie down if they recognize the initial symptoms. Wearing support stockings and engaging in deep knee-bending movements can help promote venous blood return. Heat exhaustion is considered by experts to be the forerunner of heat stroke (hyperthermia). It may even resemble heat stroke, with the difference being that the neurologic function remains intact. Heat exhaustion is marked by excessive dehydration and electrolyte depletion. Symptoms may include diarrhea, headache, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, tachycardia, malaise, and myalgia. Definitive therapy includes removing patients from the heat and replenishing their fluids. Most patients will require fluid replacement with IV isotonic fluids at first. The salt content is adjusted as necessary once the electrolyte levels are known. After discharge from the hospital, patients are instructed to rest, drink plenty of fluids for 2‚Äì3 hours, and avoid the heat for several days. If this advice is not followed it may then lead to heat stroke. One public health measure taken during heat waves is the setting-up of air-conditioned public cooling centers. = Mortality = Heat waves are the most lethal type of weather phenomenon in the United States. Between 1992 and 2001, deaths from excessive heat in the United States numbered 2,190, compared with 880 deaths from floods and 150 from hurricanes. The average annual number of fatalities directly attributed to heat in the United States is about 400. The 1995 Chicago heat wave, one of the worst in US history, led to approximately 739 heat-related deaths over a period of 5 days.Near-Fatal Heat Stroke during the 1995 Heat Wave in Chicago. Annals of Internal Medicine Vol. 129 Issue 3 Eric Klinenberg has noted that in the United States, the loss of human life in hot spells in summer exceeds that caused by all other weather events combined, including lightning, rain, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes.Dead Heat: Why don't Americans sweat over heat-wave deaths? By Eric Klinenberg. Slate.com. Posted Tuesday, 30 July 2002 Despite the dangers, Scott Sheridan, professor of geography at Kent State University, found that less than half of people 65 and older abide by heat-emergency recommendations such as drinking plenty of water. In his study of heat-wave behavior, focusing particularly on seniors in Philadelphia, Phoenix, Toronto, and Dayton, Ohio, he found that people over 65 \\"don't consider themselves seniors.\\" One of his older respondents said: \\"Heat doesn't bother me much, but I worry about my neighbors.\\"Floods, Tornadoes, Hurricanes, Wildfires, Earthquakes... Why We Don't Prepare By Amanda Ripley. Time. 28 August 2006. According to the Agency for Health care Research and Quality, about 6,200 Americans are hospitalized each summer due to excessive heat, and those at highest risk are poor, uninsured or elderly.Most People Struck Down by Summer Heat Are Poor Newswise, Retrieved on 9 July 2008. More than 70,000 Europeans died as a result of the 2003 European heat wave. Also more than 2,000 people died in Karachi, Pakistan in June 2015 due to a severe heat wave with temperatures as high as . Our concern now is focusing on predicting the future likelihood of heat waves and their severity. In addition, because in most of the world most of those suffering the impacts of a heat wave will be inside a building, and this will modify the temperatures they are exposed to, there is the need to link climate models to building models. This means producing example time series of future weather. Other work has shown that future mortality due to heat waves could be reduced if buildings were better designed to modify the internal climate, or if the occupants were better educated about the issues, so they can take action in time. ; Underreporting and \\"Harvesting\\" effect The number of heat fatalities is likely highly underreported due to a lack of reports and misreports. Part of the mortality observed during a heat wave, however, can be attributed to a so-called \\"harvesting effect\\", a term for a short-term forward mortality displacement. It has been observed that for some heat waves, there is a compensatory decrease in overall mortality during the subsequent weeks after a heat wave. Such compensatory reductions in mortality suggest that heat affects especially those so ill that they \\"would have died in the short term anyway\\". Another explanation for underreporting is the social attenuation in most contexts of heat waves as a health risk. As shown by the deadly French heat wave in 2003, heat wave dangers result from the intricate association of natural and social factors. = Psychological and sociological effects = In addition to physical stress, excessive heat causes psychological stress, to a degree which affects performance, and is also associated with an increase in violent crime. High temperatures are associated with increased conflict both at the interpersonal level and at the societal level. In every society, crime rates go up when temperatures go up, particularly violent crimes such as assault, murder, and rape. Furthermore, in politically unstable countries, high temperatures are an aggravating factor that lead toward civil wars. Additionally, high temperatures have a significant effect on income. A study of counties in the United States found that economic productivity of individual days declines by about 1.7% for each degree Celsius above . = Power outages = Abnormally hot temperatures can cause electricity demand to increase during the peak summertime hours of 4 to 7 p.m. when air conditioners are straining to overcome the heat. If a hot spell extends to three days or more, however, nighttime temperatures do not cool down, and the thermal mass in homes and buildings retains the heat from previous days. This heat build-up causes air conditioners to turn on earlier and to stay on later in the day. As a result, available electricity supplies are challenged during a higher, wider, peak electricity consumption period. Heat waves often lead to electricity spikes due to increased air conditioning use, which can create power outages, exacerbating the problem. During the 2006 North American heat wave, thousands of homes and businesses went without power, especially in California. In Los Angeles, electrical transformers failed, leaving thousands without power for as long as five days. The 2009 South Eastern Australia Heat Wave caused the city of Melbourne, Australia to experience some major power disruptions which left over half a million people without power as the heat wave blew transformers and overloaded a power grid. = Wildfires = If a heat wave occurs during a drought, which dries out vegetation, it can contribute to bushfires and wildfires. During the disastrous heat wave that struck Europe in 2003, fires raged through Portugal, destroying over or of forest and or of agricultural land and causing an estimated ‚Ç¨1 billion worth of damage. High end farmlands have irrigation systems to back up crops with. Heat waves cause wildfires. = Physical damage = Heat waves can and do cause roads and highways to buckle and melt, water lines to burst, and power transformers to detonate, causing fires. See the 2006 North American heat wave article about heat waves causing physical damage. Heat waves can also damage rail roads, such as buckling and kinking rails, which can lead to slower traffic, delays, and even cancellations of service when rails are too dangerous to traverse by trains. Sun kinking is caused when certain types of rail design like short section rails welded together or fish plate rails expand and push on other sections of rail causing them to warp and kink. Sun kinking can be a serious problem in hotter climates like Southern USA, parts of Canada, the Middle East, etc. In the 2013 heatwave in England, gritters (normally only seen in snow) were sent out to grit melting tarmac roads.  Global warming  Climate models reveal that future heat waves will have a more intense geographic pattern. Model results show that areas associated with the severe heat waves in Chicago in 1995 and Paris in 2003 will experience more intense, more frequent, and longer-lasting heat waves in the second half of the 21st century. Heat waves today in Europe and North America happen parallel to the conditions of atmospheric circulation. Increased anthropogenic activities causing increased greenhouse gas emissions show that heat waves will be more severe. Heat waves and droughts as a result, minimize ecosystem carbon uptake. Carbon uptake is also known as carbon sequestration. Extreme heat wave events are predicted to happen with increased global warming, which puts stress on ecosystems. Stress on ecosystems due to future intensified heat waves will reduce biological productivity. This will cause changes in the ecosystem's carbon cycle feedback because there will be less vegetation to hold the carbon from the atmosphere, which will only contribute more to atmospheric warming. Policy makers, funders and researchers responding to the increasing heatwaves created the Extreme Heat Resiliance Alliance coalition under the Atlantic Council to advocate for naming heatwaves, measuring them, and ranking them to build better awareness of their impacts.  Examples  The great heatwave of 2018 impacted millions of people. Temperatures raised up to locally 47 degrees Celsius. June 2019 was the hottest month on record worldwide, the effects of this were especially prominent in Europe. The effects of climate change have been projected to make heat waves in places such as Europe up to five times more likely to occur. Among other effects, increased wildfires in places such as Spain can also be attributed to heat waves. In July 2019, over 50 million people in the United States were present in a jurisdiction with any type of heat advisory - heat is the deadliest type of extreme weather in the United States. Scientists predicted that in the days following the issuance of these warnings, many records for highest low temperatures will be broken. (I.e. - the lowest temperature in a 24-hour period will be higher than any low temperature measured before.) In addition to posing threat to human health, heat waves significantly threaten agricultural production. In 2019, heat waves in the Mulanje region of Malawi experienced temperatures as high as 40 degrees celsius. Heat waves and a late rain season resulted in significant leaf scorching of tea leaves in Malawi, leading to reduced yields.

Life Blason of Concino Concini Contemporary depiction of the assassination of Concini A Florentine nobleman, Concini was born in the capital city of the Tuscany region H√©l√®ne Duccini, Concini: grandeur et mis√®re du favori de Marie de M√©dicis, Paris: Albin Michel, 1991, (), p.13. (23 November 1569). Emmanuel Poulle, Astronomie plan√©taire au Moyen √Çge latin, Aldershot / Brookfield: Variorum, coll. \\"Collected Studies Series\\", 1996, p.X. He went to France with Maria de Medici, wife of Henri IV, and married the queen's lady-in-waiting, Leonora Dori, known as \\"Galiga√Ø\\". It is generally thought that the favour his wife enjoyed with the queen, combined with his wit and boldness, contributed to make Concini's fortune. In 1610, he purchased the marquisate of Ancre and the position of First Gentleman-in-waiting. Then he obtained successively the governments of Amiens and of Normandy, governor of P√©ronne, Roye and Montdidier and, in 1613, the baton of Marshal of France. From then first minister of the realm, he abandoned the policy of Henri IV, compromised his wise legislation, allowed the treasury to be pillaged, and drew upon himself the hatred of all classes. The nobles were bitterly hostile to him, particularly Henry II de Bourbon, Prince of Cond√©, with whom he negotiated the Treaty of Loudun in 1616, and whom he had arrested in September 1616. This was done on the advice of Cardinal de Richelieu, whose introduction into politics was favoured by Concini. Concini's political power did not commence as early as 1610. From 1610 to 1614, he and his wife settled for expanding their fortune via Galiga√Ø's close relation with the queen. As the queen's closest adviser she and her husband were financially rewarded. With this wealth Concini established himself the marquisate of Ancre in 1610 and three years later in 1613 a marshal's baton. During these years however, most of the political power remained in the hands of minister Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy. Between 1614 and 1616 his political influence expanded, being involved in Spanish marriages and his interference with rebelling princes. In 1615 we can see an increase in criticism towards Concini in the spread of negative pamphlets. Since the Peace of Loudun we can see Concini wielding a true political power over the French kingdom. The couple aimed to strengthen royal authority by disbanding Henry IV's old ministers and having the prince of Cond√© incarcerated. A new ministry was formed with Claude Mangot as keeper of the seals, Claude Barbin as minister of finance and Cardinal Richelieu as foreign minister.John H. Elliott and Laurence Brockliss, The World of the Favorite (London, Yale University Press: 1999) p 72 By 1617, Louis XIII, incited by his favourite Charles de Luynes, was tired of Concini's tutelage. Nicolas de L'H√¥pital, as head of the royal guards, received in the King's name the order to imprison him. According to some authors, young Louis XIII agreed that Concini could be killed if he resisted. Apprehended on the bridge of the Louvre, Concini was killed by guards after allegedly calling out \\"√Ä moi !\\" (\\"To me!\\") for help, which was interpreted as resistance. The action was the result of a secret plot organised by Louis XIII king of France and Charles de Luynes, which was then executed by the Baron of Vitry. Concini had to be eliminated because he was perceived by Louis XIII as a menace‚Äîa powerful politician, having a personal army of 7,000 soldiers and important supporters and contacts among the aristocrats of France. After his murder, the Queen Mother was ordered to retire to Blois. Concini's wife, Leonora Dori, was arrested, imprisoned in Blois and accused of sorcery. She was beheaded and her body subsequently burned at the stake on July 8 of the same year in Place de Gr√®ve, Paris. Concini's son, Henry, born in 1605, fled France and died in 1631 in Florence. The Concinis' chattels and estates, in particular the castle of L√©signy and the palace of Rue de Tournon, were confiscated by King Louis XIII and given to Charles de Luynes. In 1617‚Äì1618, many rumours and pamphlets were distributed in Paris to justify Concini‚Äôs murder. In 1767, D. Sandellius published at Brescia, De Concini vita, On the role of Concini, see the Histoire de France, published under the direction of Ernest Lavisse, vol. vi. (1905), by Mariejol.

Etymology The word syndicate comes from the French word syndicat which means \\"trade union\\" (syndic meaning \\"administrator\\"), from the Latin word syndicus which in turn comes from the Greek word œÉœçŒΩŒ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒøœÇ (syndikos), which means \\"caretaker of an issue\\"; compare to ombudsman or representative. Definition The Merriam Webster Dictionary defines syndicate as a group of people or businesses that work together as a team. This may be a council or body or association of people or an association of concerns, officially authorized to undertake a duty or negotiate business with an office or jurisdiction. It may mean an association of racketeers in organized crime. It may refer to a business concern that sells materials for publication (newspaper, radio, TV, internet) in a number of outlets simultaneously, or a group of newspapers under one management. Labor syndicates A syndicate, labor syndicate or worker's syndicate can also mean a trade union. This usage mirrors the common meaning of the word's etymological cousins in languages such as French and Spanish. =Worker- managed enterprise= In this sense, the term is also associated with anarchist theory, specifically anarcho-syndicalism, in which trade unions form an alternative to both the nation state and capitalist corporations. Anarchists, syndicalists, and other libertarian socialists use the word \\"syndicate\\" to refer to an enterprise managed by its workers. Such an enterprise is governed by a face-to-face meeting of everyone who works there, in which each worker has one vote. Either there are no managers, or the managers are directly elected and recallable. In either case, the most important decisions are made collectively by the whole workforce. This is known as workers' self-management. Crime syndicates Crime syndicates are formed to coordinate, promote, and engage in organized crime, running common illegal businesses on a large, national, or international scale. The subunit of the syndicate is a crime family or clan, organized by blood relationships, as seen in the Italian Mafia and the Italian American Mafia crime families (the Five Families dominating New York City crime, namely, the Gambino crime family, Genovese crime family, Lucchese crime family, Bonanno crime family, and the Colombo crime family). Media syndicates In media, syndicates are organizations by name and credit. For example, BBC Radio International is a radio syndicated business. A news ticker, residing in the lower third of the television screen image, usually shows syndicated news stories. Print syndication distributes news articles, columns, comic strips, and other features to newspapers, magazines and websites. They offer reprint rights and grant permissions to other parties for republishing content of which they own/represent copyrights. Business syndicates A group formed of several business entities, like companies or corporations, which share common interests in a market but usually are not direct competitors. Larger companies or corporations form syndicates to strengthen their position in the market. Internet companies and corporations, focusing on various Internet ventures, tend to form syndicates within their own group, with direct competitors involved. In such cases, they share a certain type of market, like brand management or search engine optimization, and usually form a Conglomerate Syndicate. They may be syndicated nationally or internationally.  Sales syndicates  A sales syndicate is a cartel with a joint sales agency.Robert Liefmann: Cartels, Concerns and Trusts, Ontario 2001 [London 1932], p. 65, 194. Such combinations were widespread before Second World War. The organizational merger of the sales departments of the individual enterprises caused an increased dependence of the cartel member on the cartel administration. This in trend stabilized these combinations. Some headquarters and other premises of these syndicate cartels have remained up to the present although their monument status as historical buildings is politically not accepted because not wanted. Finance syndicates In finance, a bank syndicate, often referred to simply as a syndicate, is a group of banks lending a usually large amount of money for a specific purpose and to one single borrower. Syndicated loans are loans underwritten by a bank syndicate and are more common in the US, where financial markets are in corporate ownership rather than private equity markets as in Europe or South America. Insurance syndicates Insurance contracts (contracts of indemnity) processed under the syndicate form of business organization date to the Hammurabi Code. The notion of insurance syndicate as a process for supplying indemnity was first codified in Lex Rhodia and is still used today as shipping's Law of General Average. =The Insurance Syndicate as Distinguished from the Corporate Insurer= It is canon to the operation of the insurance syndicate that the liability of the suppliers of surplus is several and not joint. This means that members or subscribers at insurance syndicates obligate themselves to a precise individual separate and several liability rather a joint liability. Insurance syndicates are not \\"incorporated\\" and may not be incorporated: the US Supreme Court has held in Roby v Lloyd'sRoby v Lloyd's; 996 F.2d 1353, 61 USLW 2796, Fed. Sec. L. Rep.

Today, insurance syndicates seem present in three forms: =The UK- based Lloyd's of London Insurance Exchange Model= Some insurance markets such as Lloyd's of London provide insurance coverage underwritten by syndicates of investors who bear the full liability for meeting the costs of any claims. Each member of the syndicate has several liability which is a full and unfettered liability for the costs and expenses for the consequences of the underwriting entered into by the syndicate. =The US-based Insurance Exchange Model= In the United States there are four major insurance syndicates that supply indemnity through the several liability of their syndicate names - which are called subscribing members. * United Services Automobile Association;NAIC # 25941; FEIN 74-0959140; TDI Company Number 14-86800; Current TDI Certificate of Authority [CofA] # 14585 granted on April 2 2008.

Lottery syndicates are more common in the UK and Europe in general. They are legal in the US, but legal problems are regularly reported.  Crowdfunding  Researchers argue that syndicates may reduce the potential for market failure in crowdfunding, a method that allows creators to raise funds for projects from many different investors through online platforms. Equity crowdfunding allows creators to issue equity to investors when they make an investment in the project. In equity crowdfunding, information asymmetry between the creator and investor may result in a variety of problems and, in some cases, market failure.Agrawal, Ajay, Christian Catalini, and Avi Goldfarb. \\"Are Syndicates the Killer App of Equity Crowdfunding?\\" California Management Review (2015): 1-16. A syndicate can be started by an individual, angel investor, or venture capitalist. An individual who wants to form a syndicate creates an investment strategy and discloses it on a crowdfunding platform. Other investors can choose to back the individual, who is the leader. The backing investors must follow the leader‚Äôs investment strategy and pay them a fee. Syndicates do not exist on all equity crowdfunding platforms.

Written and directed by Sam Catlin, it aired on AMC in the United States and Canada on September 1, 2013.  Plot  Walt creeps cautiously through his house in search of Jesse, who broke in and doused it in gasoline, but Jesse is nowhere to be found. After a cleaning crew cannot remove the gasoline scent from the floor, Walt douses his clothing and the seats of his car in it. He tells a doubtful Skyler and Walt Jr. a complicated fabrication about a pump malfunction at the gas station. Walt moves the family into a hotel until the carpet and flooring can be replaced. Walt then secretly meets with Saul and Kuby in the hotel's parking lot, asking for an update on Jesse's whereabouts. Using elusive figures of speech, Saul hints at the possibility of killing Jesse, but Walt rejects the idea and warns him to never bring it up again. Back in the hotel room, Skyler confronts Walt over his lies, having just seen him with Saul. Walt confesses that Jesse is upset and tried to burn down their house, but that he is not anything to be concerned about, since he decided not to do it. A shocked Skyler presses Walt to kill Jesse, whom she views as a threat to their safety, saying \\"We've come this far ... What's one more?\\" A flashback reveals that Jesse did not change his mind but was instead stopped by Hank, who had trailed Jesse to Walt's residence after Jesse assaulted Saul. Hank manages to talk Jesse out of torching the house and convinces him to work together to bring Walt down. The two leave mere seconds before Walt arrives. Marie talks to a therapist about her situation involving Walt, but stops short of revealing the true extent of his criminality. Hank keeps Jesse at their house because he believes that he will be more protected there, which Marie agrees to because what Hank is planning will be bad for Walt. Hank brings in Gomez and they tape Jesse's detailed recital of his history with Walt, from the time they first met. However, because there is no physical evidence and Walt has left the meth business, Hank and Jesse have nothing sufficiently incriminating to take to the authorities. Walt calls Jesse, leaving a voicemail asking them to meet in a public plaza in Downtown Albuquerque to discuss Brock's poisoning and to reconcile. Hank coerces the reluctant Jesse to comply, despite Jesse's fear for his own safety. Hank reassures Jesse by recounting Walt's previous attempts to protect him at his own expense, and states that since the meeting is in a public place, he will be safe. However, privately with Gomez, Hank indicates his dislike of Jesse and indifference to risking his death, if caught on camera as potential evidence against Walt. Wired for sound, Jesse goes to meet with Walt but immediately backs down after mistaking a nearby pedestrian for a hitman. Angered, Jesse instead goes to a pay phone to call Walt and threatens him, telling him that he will \\"get him where he really lives.\\" A furious Hank berates Jesse for blowing the plan, but Jesse calmly informs him that he has a better strategy in mind. Meanwhile, Walt calls Todd, requesting a job for his Uncle Jack.

Foreword by Ben Johnston. names a new musical theory developed by Oliveros, \\"sonic awareness\\", and describes it as \\"the ability to consciously focus attention upon environmental and musical sound\\", requiring \\"continual alertness and an inclination to be always listening\\" and which she describes as comparable to John Berger's concept of visual consciousness (as in his Ways of Seeing).Von Gunden, Heidi (Autumn, 1980 ‚Äì Summer, 1981). \\"The Theory of Sonic Awareness in The Greeting by Pauline Oliveros\\", Perspectives of New Music, Vol. 19, No. 1/2, p. 409. Oliveros discusses this theory in the \\"Introductions\\" to her Sonic Meditations and in articles. Von Gunden describes sonic awareness as \\"a synthesis of the psychology of consciousness, the physiology of the martial arts, and the sociology of the feminist movement\\",Von Gunden (1980), p.410. and describes two ways of processing information, \\"attention and awareness\\", or focal attention and global attention, which may be represented by a dot and circle, respectively, a symbol Oliveros commonly employs in compositions such as Rose Moon (1977) and El Rilicario de los Animales (1979). (The titles of Oliveros' pieces Rose Moon and Rose Mountain refer to her romantic partner Linda Montano having gone by Rose Mountain at one time.Von Gunden (1983), p.128-129.) Later this representation was expanded, with the symbol quartered and the quarters representing \\"actively making sound\\", \\"actually imagining sound\\", \\"listening to present sound\\" and \\"remembering past sound\\", with this model used in Sonic Meditations.Von Gunden (1980), p.412.

It is now believed to have been an error: see ) was an Anglo- Welsh soldier, diplomat, historian, poet and religious philosopher of the Kingdom of England. Life =Early life= Edward Herbert was the eldest son of Richard Herbert of Montgomery Castle (a member of a collateral branch of the family of the Earls of Pembroke) and of Magdalen, daughter of Sir Richard Newport, and brother of the poet George Herbert. He was born within England at Eyton-on-Severn near Wroxeter, Shropshire. After private tuition, he matriculated at University College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner, in May 1596. On 28 February 1599, at the age of 15, he married his cousin Mary, then aged 21, (\\"notwithstanding the disparity of years betwixt us\\"Autobiography.), who was daughter and heiress of Sir William Herbert (d. 1593). He returned to Oxford with his wife and mother, continued his studies, and learned French, Italian and Spanish, as well as music, riding and fencing. During this period, before he was 21, he started a family. Herbert entered Parliament as knight of the shire for Montgomeryshire in 1601. On the accession of King James I he presented himself at court and was created a Knight of the Bath on 24 July 1603. From 1604 to 1611 he was Member of Parliament for Merioneth.Bedford, p. 2. From 1605 he was magistrate and appointed sheriff of Montgomeryshire for 1605.Welsh Biography Online =Soldier= Edward Herbert, miniature portrait c. 1613‚Äì1614 by Isaac Oliver, now in Powis Castle In 1608, Edward Herbert went to Paris, with Aurelian Townshend, enjoying the friendship and hospitality of the old Constable de Montmorency at Merlou and meeting King Henry IV; he lodged for many months with Isaac Casaubon.Bedford, p. 2. On his return, as he wrote of himself, he was \\"in great esteem both in court and city, many of the greatest desiring my company\\". At this period he was close to both Ben Jonson and John Donne, and in Jonson's Epicoene, or the Silent Woman Herbert is probably alluded to.Richard Dutton (editor), Epicene, Or, The Silent Woman: By Ben Jonson (2003), p. 10. Both Donne and Jonson honoured him in poetry.Bedford, pp. 10‚Äì11. In December 1609 he fought with a Scottish usher at Greenwich Palace who had snatched a ribbon from Mary Middlemore's hair, and if the Privy Council had not prevented it, would have fought a duel in Hyde Park.Edward Herbert, The Life of Edward Lord Herbert of Cherbury (London, 1826), pp. 108-9: Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 1 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 296. In 1610 Herbert served as a volunteer in the Low Countries under the Prince of Orange, whose intimate friend he became, and distinguished himself at the capture of Juliers from the emperor. He offered to decide the war by engaging in single combat with a champion chosen from among the enemy, but his challenge was declined. Back in England in 1611 he survived an assault in London by Sir John Eyre who accused him of having an affair with his wife Dorothy Bulstrode. He paid a visit to Spinola, in the Spanish camp near Wezel, and afterwards to the elector palatine at Heidelberg, subsequently travelling in Italy. At the instance of the Duke of Savoy he led an expedition of 4,000 Huguenots from Languedoc into Piedmont to help the Savoyards against Spain, but after nearly losing his life in the journey to Lyon he was imprisoned on his arrival there, and the enterprise came to nothing. Thence he returned to the Netherlands and the Prince of Orange, arriving in England in 1617. =Diplomat= In 1619, Herbert was made ambassador to Paris, taking in his entourage Thomas Carew.http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=81305 He became involved with the case of Piero Hugon who had stolen jewels belonging to Anne of Denmark.Sidney Lee, Autobiography of Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury (London, 1886), p. 343. A quarrel with de Luynes and a challenge sent by him to the latter occasioned his recall in 1621. After the death of de Luynes, Herbert resumed his post in February 1622. He was popular at the French court and showed considerable diplomatic ability. His chief objects were to accomplish the marriage between Charles, Prince of Wales and Henrietta Maria, and to secure the assistance of Louis XIII for Frederick V, Elector Palatine. He failed in the latter, and was dismissed in April 1624. Herbert returned home greatly in debt and received little reward for his services beyond the Irish peerage of Baron Herbert of Castle Island on 31 May 1624 and the English barony of Herbert of Cherbury, or Chirbury, on 7 May 1629. =Later life= In 1632, Herbert was appointed a member of the council of war. He attended the king at York in 1639, and in May 1642 was imprisoned by the parliament for urging the addition of the words \\"without cause\\" to the resolution that the king violated his oath by making war on parliament. He determined after this to take no further part in the struggle, retired to Montgomery Castle, and declined the king's summons, pleading ill-health. On 5 September 1644 he surrendered the castle, by negotiation, to the Parliamentary forces led by Sir Thomas Myddelton.http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=37605 He returned to London, submitted, and was granted a pension of ¬£20 a week. In 1647 he paid a visit to Pierre Gassendi at Paris, and died in London the following summer, aged 65, being buried in the church of St Giles in the Fields. =Family= Lord Herbert left two sons, Richard (c. 1600‚Äì1655), who succeeded him as 2nd Lord Herbert of Cherbury, and Edward. Richard's sons, Edward Herbert (d.1678) and Henry Herbert (d.1691), each succeeded to the title, after which it became extinct. It was revived in 1694 when Henry Herbert (1654‚Äì1709), son of Sir Henry Herbert (1595‚Äì1673), brother of the 1st Lord Herbert, was created Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Lord Herbert's cousin and namesake, Sir Edward Herbert, was also a prominent figure in the English Civil War. De Veritate Herbert's major work is the De Veritate, prout distinguitur a revelatione, a verisimili, a possibili, et a falso (On Truth, as It Is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False)On Truth, as it is Distinguished from Revelation, the Probable, the Possible, and the False) (Paris, 1624; London, 1633; translated into French in 1639 and into English in 1937. He published it on the advice of Grotius.http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/herbert.htm In the De veritate, Herbert produced the first purely metaphysical treatise, written by an Englishman. Herbert's real claim to fame is as \\"the father of English Deism\\". The common notions of religion are the famous five articles, which became the charter of the English deists.http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/deismeng.htmhttp://www.sullivan- county.com/nf0/ Charles Blount, in particular, acted as a publicist for Herbert's idea. It has been placed on the index of forbidden books of the Catholic Church. Other works Lord Herbert of Cherbury by Wenceslaus Hollar The De religione gentiliumCompleted 1645, published Amsterdam, 1663, translated into English by William Lewis, London, 1705. was a posthumous work, influenced by the De theologia gentili of Gerardus Vossius, and seen into print by Isaac Vossius. It is an early work on comparative religion, and gives, in David Hume's words, \\"a natural history of religion.\\" It is also to some extent dependent on the De dis Syris of John Selden, and the Quaestiones celeberrimae in Genesim of Marin Mersenne.Bedford, p. 179. By examining pagan religions Herbert finds the universality of his five great articles, and that these are clearly recognisable. The same vein is maintained in the tracts De causis errorum, an unfinished work on logical fallacies, Religio laici, and Ad sacerdotes de religione laici (1645). Herbert's first historical work was the Expedition Buckinghami ducis,Published in a Latin translation in 1656 and in the original English by the Earl of Powis for the Philobiblon Society in 1860. a defence of the Duke of Buckingham's conduct on the La Rochelle expedition of 1627. The Life and Raigne of King Henry VIII (1649) is considered good for its period, but hampered by limited sources. His poems, published in 1665 (reprinted and edited by John Churton Collins in 1881), show him in general a faithful disciple of Donne. His satires are poor, but a few of his lyrical verses show power of reflection and true inspiration, while his use of the metre afterwards employed by Tennyson in his \\"In Memoriam\\" is particularly happy and effective. His Neo-Latin poems are evidence of his scholarship. Three of these had appeared together with the De causis errorum in 1645. To these works must be added A Dialogue between a Tutor and a Pupil,1768; a treatise on education, manuscript in the Bodleian Library. which is of disputed authenticity;Upheld by G√ºnter Gawlick in his 1971 facsimile edition, after this had been cast in doubt by Rossi. and a treatise on the king's supremacy in the Church (manuscript in the Record Office and at the Queen's College, Oxford). His autobiography, first published by Horace Walpole in 1764, a na√Øve and amusing narrative, is much occupied with his duels and amorous adventures, and breaks off in 1624. Missing from it are his friendships and the diplomatic side of his embassy in France, in relation to which he described only the splendour of his retinue and his social triumphs. He was a lutenist, and his collection Lord Herbert of Cherbury's Lute-Book survives in manuscript.http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~wbc/julia/ch7/7a.htm His own compositions, in all four preludes, four pavans and a courante, are conservative in style, showing little influence from the works of the French school that appear in his collection. Herbert of Cherbury's views of prayer Joseph Waligore, in his article \\"The Piety of the English Deists\\" has shown that Herbert was one of the most pious of the deists, as he fervently prayed to God and believed God gave signs in answer to our prayers. He was so sure God answered our prayers that he said prayer was an idea God put into every human. He said that: For Herbert, this universal testimony of God answering our prayers meant that it was a common notion or something engraved into our heart by God. Herbert was speaking from experience. In his autobiography, Herbert said he once prayed for and received a divine sign. He had written De Veritate and was wondering whether he should publish it. So he got down on his knees and prayed fervently to God for a sign instructing him what to do. Even though it was a clear, sunny day with no wind, Herbert said he heard a gentle noise in the clear sky that so comforted him that he decided it was a sign from God that he should publish his book. Herbert wrote: Herbert was attacked by orthodox Protestant ministers of the eighteenth century as a religious enthusiast. One minister, John Brown, said his claim to have received a sign from God was \\"enthusiastic\\".John Brown, A General History of the Christian Church, 2 vols. (Edinburgh, 1771), 2: 278. Another minister, John Leland, said even asking for such a sign was improper, as God does not become involved like that in people‚Äôs lives. Leland said that Herbert‚Äôs claim \\"passed for a high fit of enthusiasm. ... I think it maybe justly doubted, whether an address of such a particular kind, as that made by his Lordship, was proper or regular. It does not seem to me, that we are well-founded to apply for or to expect an extraordinary sign from heaven.\\"John Leland, A View of the Principal Deistical Writers, 3rd ed., 3 vols. (1757; reprint, New York: Garland, 1978), 1:25. Clearly these two eighteenth-century Christian commentators did not see Herbert's understanding of God as distant and uninvolved. Rather, Herbert was attacked for believing in an overly-involved deity who had an overly-intimate relationship with people. Modern scholars of deism often have difficulty fitting Herbert's religious views into their scheme of what deists believed. For example, Peter Gay said that Herbert ‚Äì who lived in the early seventeenth century ‚Äì was atypical of the later deists because Herbert thought he had received a divine sign.Peter Gay, Deism: An Anthology (Princeton: D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc., 1968), 30, 53. But Waligore argues that instead of saying Herbert was not a deist, we should change our notions about the deists and their relationship to God through prayer.Waligore 2012. Besides believing in prayers and divine signs, Herbert also believed in miracles, revelation, and direct divine inspiration. Herbert was so sure God performed miracles that he thought this doctrine, and the related notion that God answered our prayers, was an idea God put into every human.Herbert, De Veritate, 292‚Äì294, as cited in Waligore p. 189. Herbert said his emphasis on natural religion did not mean revelation was superfluous. He said he thought the Bible was a \\"surer source of consolation and support\\" than any other book and reading it stirred \\"the whole inner man\\" to life.Herbert, De Veritate, 316, as cited in Waligore, p. 196. Herbert thought that divine inspiration generally happened through \\"the medium of spirits ... variously called angels, demons, intelligences and geniuses\\".Herbert of Cherbury, De Veritate, trans. Meyrick H. Carre (Bristol: J. W. Arrowsmith, 1937), 308‚Äì309. He said that we could be sure we had divine inspiration if we prepared ourselves for it and it met certain conditions. To begin with, said Herbert, \\"we must employ prayers, vows, faith and every faculty which can be used to invoke\\" the divine. Then \\"the breath of the Divine Spirit must be immediately felt\\" and the recommended course of action must be good. When these conditions were met, \\"and we feel the Divine guidance in our activities, we must recognize with reverence the good will of God\\".Herbert of Cherbury, De Veritate, 308‚Äì9, as cited in Waligore p. 186.

The female counterpart is a daughter. From a biological perspective, a son constitutes a first degree relative. Social issues regarding sons In pre-industrial societies and some current countries with agriculture-based economies, a higher value was, and still is, assigned to sons rather than daughters, giving males higher social status, because males were physically stronger, and could perform farming tasks more effectively. For Example - Siddarth Nandi is Sonu's son. In China, a One-child Policy was in effect until 2015 in order to address rapid population growth. Official birth records showed a rise in the level of male births since the policy was brought into law. This was attributed to a number of factors, including the illegal practice of sex-selective abortion and widespread under-reporting of female births. In patrilineal societies, sons will customarily inherit an estate before daughters. In some cultures, the eldest son has special privileges. For example, in Biblical times, the first-born male was bequeathed the most goods from his father. Some Japanese social norms involving the eldest son are: \\"that parents are more likely to live with their eldest child if their eldest child is a son\\" and \\"that parents are most likely to live with their eldest son even if he is not the eldest child\\". Example: A male Leopon is a female lion's son and Emmanuel is the son of Helene from Cameroon Specialized use of the term son =Christian symbolism= Miniature in Les Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry depicting the Baptism of Jesus, where God the Father proclaimed Jesus to be his Son. Among Christians, \\"the Son\\" or Son of God refers to Jesus Christ. Trinitarian Christians view Jesus as the human incarnation of God the second person of the Trinity, known as God the Son. In the Gospels, Jesus sometimes refers to himself as the Son of Man. =In Semitic names= The Arabic word for son is ibn. Because family and ancestry are important cultural values in the Arab world and Islam, Arabs and most Muslims (e.g. Bruneian) often use bin, which is a form of ibn, in their full names. The bin here means \\"son of.\\" For example, the Arab name \\"Saleh bin Tarif bin Khaled Al-Fulani\\" translates as \\"Saleh, son of Tarif, son of Khaled; of the family Al-Fulani\\" (cf. Arab family naming conventions). Accordingly, the opposite of ibn/bin is abu, meaning \\"the father of.\\" It is a retronym, given upon the birth of one's first-born son, and is used as a moniker to indicate the newly acquired fatherhood status, rather than a family name. For example, if Mahmoud's first-born son is named Abdullah, from that point on Mahmoud can be called \\"Abu Abdullah.\\" This is cognate with the Hebrew language ben, as in \\"Judah ben Abram HaLevi,\\" which means \\"Judah, son of Abram, the Levite.\\" Ben is also a standalone name. =Indications in names= In many cultures, the surname of the family means \\"son of\\", indicating a possible ancestry‚Äîi.e., that the whole family descends from a common ancestor. It may vary between the beginning or the termination of the surname. ;Arabic * bin or ibn.

It is bounded by (from the north and clockwise) the districts of Dillingen, Augsburg, Unterallg√§u and Neu-Ulm, and by the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg (districts Alb- Donau and Heidenheim). For the capital, see G√ºnzburg. History In the early Middle Ages the tiny county of Burgau ruled the region. In 1213 the county was acquired by the lords of Berg; it was then known as Berg-Burgau, but the last ruler of this collateral line died in 1301, and Burgau (now raised to the level of a margraviate) became an exclave of Austria. In the early 17th century the administrative seat was moved from the town of Burgau to G√ºnzburg, but the margraviate retained its name. When the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist in 1806, the margraviate was dissolved and the region was annexed by Bavaria. The district was established in 1972 by merging the former districts of G√ºnzburg and Krumbach. G√ºnzburg lost its status as an urban district and became the administrative seat of the new district. Geography The Danube river and its tributaries characterise this district. The Danube runs through the northernmost parts of the district, passing the cities of G√ºnzburg and Leipheim. There are several affluents coming from the south, for example Biber, G√ºnz and Mindel. Most of the district's area is covered with forests; the eastern third of the territory is part of the Augsburg Western Forests Nature Park.

Activism  A political activist since the early 1990s when he opposed the first Gulf War, Rosebraugh has been involved in a variety of human rights, environmental and animal protection campaigns. In 1996, he co-formed the Liberation Collective organization, a group based in Portland, Oregon that worked to bring together commonalities in various justice struggles. The same year he took part in a protest against the Seattle Fur Exchange, and was one of five people arrested for civil disobedience after blocking the entrance. In May of the same year, Rosebraugh was one of four people who blockaded the entrance to the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center in protest of primate experimentation. In 1997, Rosebraugh co-organized the 1997 Primate Tour, a series of vigils at the then seven regional primate research facilities in the United States. The same year, he took part in a national protest against the California Regional Primate Research Center at the University of California Davis, and was one of thirty-two people arrested for non-violent civil disobedience. In 1997, Rosebraugh also began acting as a spokesperson for the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front. In 1998, he wrote the essay, Arguments Against The Use of Nonhuman Animals in Biomedical And Scientific Experimentation, where he seeks to examine the ethical implications of the experimentation on animals and refute its supposed contribution to the medical research for human health. The following year, Rosebraugh was a co-founder of the Coalition to End Primate Experimentation (CEPE) and served as the National Organizer for the 1999 Primate Freedom Tour, a four-month-long protest tour of the primary primate research facilities in the United States. From 1997 to 2001, Rosebraugh served as a spokesperson for the Earth Liberation Front receiving anonymous communiques from the ELF and forwarding them on to news media internationally. In 1999, Rosebraugh co-formed the North American Earth Liberation Front Press Office (NAELFPO) with Leslie James Pickering, where he continued to forward communiques, conduct international press interviews, and nationwide informational lectures on the ideology of the ELF movement.Interview with Craig Rosebraugh: E.L.F. Spokesperson targeted by Grand Jury , No Compromise, Issue 16. Between 1997 and 2006, Rosebraugh received eight subpoenas to appear before federal grand juries to discuss his sources, but he has said he has no knowledge of them and refused to cooperate with the proceedings. The New York Times Magazine dubbed him the \\"Face of Ecoterrorism\\" in 1998. Rosebraugh resigned his position as spokesperson on September 5, 2001, believing that a refocusing of strategies and tactics needed to occur to fully promote justice in the United States. Despite the seizure of his computer equipment; searches of his business, person, and home; grand jury investigations; FBI and ATF questioning; facing years in prison and hundreds of death threats; he did not reveal the identities of members of the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front movements. Rosebraugh's first book, \\"The Logic of Political Violence: Lessons in Reform and Revolution\\" was published in 2003 and is a comparison study between the use of non-violence and politically motivated violence in historical justice struggles. His second book, \\"Burning Rage of a Dying Planet: Speaking for the Earth Liberation Front\\" was published in 2004 and is a memoir of his time speaking on behalf of the Earth Liberation Front. In 2009, Rosebraugh was the contributing editor of the book, \\"This Country Must Change: Essays on the Necessity of Revolution in the U.S.A.,\\" a compilation of essays from prominent political prisoners and activists in the United States. In the Summer of 2009, the first issue of his magazine, Resistance: Journal of the Earth Liberation Movement, was released. The magazine covers the actions and discusses the philosophy and tactics of earth liberation groups, such as the ELF and ALF. Also in 2009, Rosebraugh co-formed Responsible Education and Media (R.E.M.), a non-profit organization in Los Angeles combining art and entertainment with a factual analysis of social and political issues impacting the global community to promote global justice. The group's projects have included full-page information advertisements in Los Angeles and Phoenix, Arizona newspapers railing against the use of ammonia in the nation's meat supply and Arizona Senate Bill 1070, the controversial immigration law.  Restaurant owner  In January 2004, with the financial backing of his parents, Rosebraugh opened Calendula, then Portland's only all-vegan and organic restaurant. The restaurant was named one of the best vegetarian restaurants in North America in 2004 by Veg News Magazine. He was criticized in the local press for his treatment of his employees and for failing to adhere to principles he had espoused. Employees that he fired joined the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) which organized a boycott of the restaurant. Rosebraugh spent $3,000 to defend himself in ads in the local alternative press. Other employees came to Rosebraugh's defense, accusing the IWW union as misguided and \\"barking up the wrong tree.\\" He closed the restaurant in September 2004, and reopened it for a short time in December of that year. The restaurant closed for the final time during the final months of 2005.  Filmography  Rosebraugh's screenplay, \\"Burning Rage\\" was a quarterfinalist in the prestigious Francis Ford Coppola 2007 Zoetrope International Screenplay Competition and also in the 2009 Phoenix Film Festival Screenplay Competition. In 2009, Rosebraugh began working on a feature-length documentary entitled, Greedy Lying Bastards an investigation into the power and dominance of the fossil fuel industry. Filmed in fourteen countries during the first half of 2010, Greedy Lying Bastards was released theatrically in North America on March 8, 2013, in the UK on September 27, 2013, and is currently available in North America for digital download, video on demand and DVD sales. The President of One Earth Productions in Los Angeles, Rosebraugh's background includes significant work in both feature film and television scripted and non-scripted content and he has personally overseen numerous projects from conception and development, through financing and pre-production, into production, post-production and distribution. Rosebraugh additionally works as a consultant for independent filmmakers as well as continuing to write, direct, and produce content.

The Kakwa people are a Nilotic ethnic group and part of the Karo people found in north-western Uganda, south-western South Sudan, and north-eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, particularly to the west of the White Nile river. Demography The Kakwa people are a small minority but a part of the larger Karo people, an intermarried group that also includes the Bari, Pojulu, Mundari, Kuku, Nyepo, and Nyangwara. Their language, Kutuk na Kakwa, is an Eastern Nilotic language.Kakwa languages, Ethnologue The major cities of the Kakwa people are the city of Yei and Morobo County (South Sudan), Koboko District (Uganda), and Imgbokolo and Aba (Democratic Republic of the Congo). The Kakwa people sometimes refer to themselves as \\"Kakwa Saliya Musala\\", translated directly as \\"kakwa three hills\\" a phrase they commonly use to denote their 'oneness' in spite of being politically dispersed among three countries. History According to the Kakwa oral tradition, they migrated out of East Africa (Nubian region) from the city of Kawa in between the third and fourth cataracts of the Nile. First into South Sudan, and from there southwards into Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Kakwa converted to Islam, accepting the Maliki school of Sunni theology in medieval era. They were annexed into Equitoria region claimed by the Egyptian Islamic ruler Khedive Ismail (Isma'il Pasha) by his descendant Tewfik Pasha in 1889. As the British colonial empire expanded into East Africa and Egypt, the region with Kakwa people became a part of the Uganda Protectorate. General Idi Amin was born in Kakwa ethnic group. The Kakwa people rose to international prominence when General Idi Amin, of Kakwa ancestry, assumed the power in Uganda through a coup. He filled important military and civil positions in his administration with his ethnic group, and Nubians. He arrested and killed officials from other ethnic groups such as the Acholi and Lango people, whom he doubted. Idi Amin also supplied arms and financed the Sudanese Kakwa people in the first civil war of Sudan. The Kakwa officials in Idi Amin regime were later accused of many humanitarian crimes. After Amin was deposed in 1979, many Kakwa people were killed in revenge killings, causing others to leave the area and fled to Sudan. However, they have now returned to their native areas in the West Nile region of northern Uganda.The Republic of Uganda, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica =Ethnic violence= For most of the South Sudanese Civil War, the fighting was focused in the Greater Upper Nile region. After the clashes in Juba in 2016, the fighting largely shifted to the previously safe haven of Equatoria, where the bulk of SPLM-IO forces went for shelter. Accounts point to both sides targeting civilians on ethnic lines between the Dinka and the dozens of ethnic groups among the Equatorians who are historically in conflict with the Dinka, such as the Karo, who include the Bari. Witnesses report Dinka soldiers threatening villagers that they will kill all Kakwa people for their alleged support to Machar and killing Pojulu people while sparing those who they find can speak Dinka. A UN investigation said rape was being used a tool of ethnic cleansing and Adama Dieng, the U.N.'s Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide, warned of genocide after visiting areas of fighting in Yei. Lifestyle The traditional Kakwa livelihood has been based on cultivating corn, millet, cassava, fishing and cattle. The traditional villages of Kakwa are linked by their lineage, with male forming councils of elders. Polygyny is accepted, and the Islamic traditions are a part of the Kakwa people lives.

Ambrogio Spinola Doria, 1st Marquess of Los Balbases (Genoa, 1569Castelnuovo Scrivia, 25 September 1630) was an Italian condottiero and nobleman of the Republic of Genoa, who served as a Spanish general and won a number of important battles. He is often called \\"Ambrosio\\" by Spanish-speaking people and is considered one of the greatest military commanders of his time and in the history of the Spanish army. His military achievements earned him the title of Marquess of Los Balbases in the Spanish peerage, as well as the Order of the Golden Fleece and Order of Santiago. Early life Ambrogio Spinola was born in Genoa, the eldest son of Filippo Spinola, Marquis of Sexten and Venafro, and his wife Polissena Grimaldi, daughter of Nicol√≤ prince of Salerno. The family of Spinola was of great antiquity, wealth and power in Genoa. Don Ambrogio's sister Donna Lelia was married to Don Giulio Cesare Squarciafico, 2nd Marquess of Galatone, from whom descend the Princes of Belmonte. In the 16th century the Italian Republic of Genoa was in practical terms a protected state of the Spanish Empire; the Genoese were the bankers of the Spanish monarchy and had control of its finances. Several of the younger brothers of Ambrogio Spinola sought their fortune in Spain, and one of them, Federico, distinguished himself greatly as a soldier in the Army of Flanders. As eldest brother, Ambrogio remained at home to marry and continue the family. In 1592 he was married to Giovanna Bacciadonne, daughter of the count of Galerata. They had three children: * Filippo (Genoa, Italy, 1594Madrid, Spain, 8 August 1659), 2nd Marquess of Balbases and his successor. * Polissena (died 1639), married Diego Felipe de Guzm√°n, 1st Marquess of Legan√©s, Governor of Flanders. * Agustin, (Genoa, 1597Sevilla, 12 February 1649), Bishop of Tortosa 1625, Archbishop of Granada 1627, Archbishop of Santiago de Compostela 1630, Archbishop of Sevilla 1645. Spanish service Portrait of Ambrogio Spinola by Anthony van Dyck The houses of Spinola and Doria were rivals for authority within the republic. Ambrogio Spinola continued the rivalry with the count of Tursi, then the chief of the Dorias. He was not successful, and having lost a lawsuit into which he had entered to enforce a right of pre-emption of a palace belonging to the Salerno family which the Doria wished to purchase, he decided to withdraw from the city and advance the fortunes of his house by serving the Spanish monarchy in Flanders. In 1602 he and his brother Federico entered into a contract with the Spanish government‚Äîa condotta on the old Italian model. It was a speculation on which Spinola risked the whole of the great fortune of his house. Ambrogio Spinola undertook to raise 9.000 Lombard mercenaries for land service, and Federico to form a squadron of galley ships for service on the coast. Several of Federico's galleys were destroyed by English and Dutch war-ships; first at Sesimbra in June and then in October in the English Channel. He himself was slain in an action with the Dutch on 24 May 1603. Ambrogio Spinola marched overland to Flanders in 1602 with the men he had raised at his own expense. During the first months of his stay in Flanders the Spanish government played with schemes for employing him on an invasion of England, which came to nothing. At the close of the year he returned to Italy for more men. His experience as a soldier did not begin until, as General, and at the age of thirty-four, he undertook to continue the Siege of Ostend on 29 September 1603. Despite failing to relieve Sluis under siege at the same time, the ruins of Ostend fell into his hands on 22 September 1604. For this victory, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece in 1605. War in Flanders The governor of Flanders Archduke Albert and the Infanta Clara Eugenia, daughter of Philip II, who had set their hearts on taking Ostend, were delighted at Spinola's success, and it won him a high reputation among the soldiers of the time. At the close of the campaign he went to Spain to meet with the court, then in Valladolid, and make arrangements for the continuation of the war. At Valladolid he insisted on being appointed commander-in-chief in Flanders. By April he was back in Brussels to lead his first campaign. At this period, the wars of the Low Countries consisted almost entirely of sieges, and Spinola made himself famous by the number of places he took in spite of the efforts of Maurice of Nassau to defend them, including the heavily fortified Groenlo. In 1606 he again went to Spain. He was received with much outward honour, and entrusted with a very secret mission to secure the government of Flanders in case of the death of the Archduke or his wife. However he could not obtain the grandeeship which he desired, and was compelled to pledge his entire fortune as security for the expenses of the war before the bankers would advance funds to the Spanish government. He was never repaid, resulting in his complete financial ruin. The Spanish government now had a reason to keep him away from Spain. Until the signing of the Twelve Years' Truce in 1609, he continued to command in the field with general success. After it was signed he retained his post, and had among other duties to conduct the negotiations with France when Henry II de Bourbon, Prince de Cond√© fled to Flanders with his wife, Charlotte-Marguerite de Montmorency, in order to put her beyond the reach of the admiration of the aging Henry IV of France. By 1611 Spinola's financial ruin was complete, but he was given the aristocratic title, a Grandeza, which he had sought. In 1614 he was involved with operations connected with the settlement of Cleves and J√ºlich. From 1620 to 1622, in the Thirty Years' War, he led the Palatinate campaign in the Lower Palatinate, which included the capture of many towns and villages, including Drais, and was rewarded with the rank of Captain-General. After the renewal of the war in the Low Countries in 1621 he had the most renowned victory of his career, the capture of Breda. Success came after a long siege (28 August 16245 June 1625), in spite of the objections of Philip IV of Spain, who thought the siege was too risky and expensive, and the strenuous efforts of Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange to save it. The surrender of Breda is the subject of a famous painting by Vel√°zquez, known as Las Lanzas. Image:Siege of Breda.jpgThe Siege of Breda.

Museum of Prado, Madrid, Spain. =Capture of Breda= Engraving of Ambrogio Spinola Flag of a Tercio of Spinola in 1621 The taking of Breda was the culmination of Spinola's career. Utter want of money paralysed the Spanish government, and the new favourite, Olivares, was jealous of the general. Spinola could not prevent Frederick Henry of Nassau from taking Groll (or Groenlo) in 1627, a good set-off for Breda. In January 1628 he left for Spain, resolved not to resume the command in Flanders unless security was given him for the support of his army. At Madrid he had to endure much insolence from Olivares, who endeavoured to make him responsible for the loss of Groll. Spinola was resolute not to return to Flanders. Death Meanwhile, the Spanish government added a war over the succession to the Duchy of Mantua to its heavy burdens. Spinola was appointed as plenipotentiary and general. He landed at Genoa on 19 September 1629. With him, at the suggestion of painter Peter Paul Rubens, came the Spanish royal painter Diego Vel√°zquez, who went with him to see famous paintings in Genoa, Milan, Venice and Rome. In Italy he was pursued by the enmity of the Conde-Duque of Olivares, curiously enough, born in Rome in 1587, where his father, don Enrique de Guzm√°n y Ribera, a cadet child from one of Spain's oldest noble families, was the Spanish ambassador, as was also his patron Spinola, who caused him to be deprived of his powers as plenipotentiary. Spinola's health broke down, as he was already 61 years old, with over 30 years experience in the battle fields, and died on 25 September 1630 at the Siege of Casale, muttering, apparently, the words \\"honour\\" and \\"reputation.\\" The title of \\"Marquess of Los Balbases\\", still borne by his representatives in Spain, was all that his family received for the vast fortune they spent in the service of Philip III and IV. He would be painted however after his death, by Diego Vel√°zquez, in 1635, as ordered by Felipe IV, in the famous picture \\"The Surrender of Breda\\", visited by tens of millions of tourists at the Museum of Prado in Madrid for the last two centuries or so. Spinola was a brilliant field commander, whose daring in battle often was used to outflank his opponents and catch them off guard. He was not a great technical innovator, but was a master of military skills. He used rapid movement and pell-mell actions in his battles. He was skilled at picking out an enemy's weakest spot and applying force there to achieve victory.* Fictional portrayals * Spinola (played by Ram√≥n Langa) leads a company of time-warriors to sweep Nazis from The Ministry of Time in the TV episode \\"C√≥mo se reescribe el tiempo\\" and assists in later efforts needing military help.IMBD The Ministry of Time: \\"C√≥mo se reescribe el tiempo\\" * A fictionalized version of him appear as secondary antagonist in the 2017 manga Issak References Sources  Genealog√≠a de la familia y del apellido Spinola (in Spanish) 1569 births 1630 deaths Doria family Generals of former Italian states Governors of the Duchy of Milan Grandees of Spain Italian people of the Eighty Years' War Italian people of the Thirty Years' War Knights of Santiago Knights of the Golden Fleece People of the Republic of Genoa Spanish generals Spanish people of Italian descent Ambrogio 16th- century Italian people 17th-century Italian military personnel People of the Anglo-Spanish War (1625‚Äì1630) ","title":"Ambrogio Spinola, 1st Marquess of Los Balbases"},{"id":"293321","text":"Damien Steven Hirst (; born 7 June 1965) is an English artist, entrepreneur, and art collector.Nicholson, Octavia. \\"Hirst, Damien (Steven)\\", Oxford Art Online (subscription).

He never met his father; his mother married his stepfather when Hirst was two, and the couple divorced 10 years later. His stepfather was reportedly a motor mechanic. Hirst's mother, who was from an Irish Catholic background, worked for the Citizens Advice Bureau, and has stated that she lost control of her son when he was young. He was arrested on two occasions for shoplifting. However, Hirst sees her as someone who would not tolerate rebellion: she cut up his bondage trousers and heated one of his Sex Pistols vinyl records on the cooker to turn it into a fruit bowl (or a plant pot). He says, \\"If she didn't like how I was dressed, she would quickly take me away from the bus stop.\\" She did, though, encourage his liking for drawing, which was his only successful educational subject. His art teacher at Allerton Grange School \\"pleaded\\" for Hirst to be allowed to enter the sixth form, where he took two A-levels, achieving an \\"E\\" grade in art. He was refused admission to Jacob Kramer College when he first applied, but attended the art school after a subsequent successful application to the Foundation Diploma course. He went to an exhibition of work by Francis Davison, staged by Julian Spalding at the Hayward Gallery in 1983. Davison created abstract collages from torn and cut coloured paper which, Hirst said, \\"blew me away\\", and which he modelled his own work on for the next two years. He worked for two years on London building sites, then studied Fine Art at Goldsmiths College (1986‚Äì89), although again he was refused a place the first time he applied. In 2007, Hirst was quoted as saying of An Oak Tree by Goldsmiths' senior tutor, Michael Craig-Martin: \\"That piece is, I think, the greatest piece of conceptual sculpture. I still can't get it out of my head.\\" While a student, Hirst had a placement at a mortuary, an experience that influenced his later themes and materials.Lewis Schiff, Business Brilliant: Surprising Lessons from the Greatest Self-Made Business Icons, Harper Collins, 2013, Early career‚Äîstudent and warehouse shows In July 1988, in his second year at Goldsmiths College, Hirst was the main organiser of an independent student exhibition, Freeze, in a disused London Port Authority administrative block in London's Docklands. He gained sponsorship for this event from the London Docklands Development Corporation. The show was visited by Charles Saatchi, Norman Rosenthal and Nicholas Serota, thanks to the influence of his Goldsmiths lecturer Michael Craig-Martin. Hirst's own contribution to the show consisted of a cluster of cardboard boxes painted with household paint.The Freeze catalogue 1988 After graduating, Hirst was included in New Contemporaries show and in a group show at Kettles Yard Gallery in Cambridge.

In 1991, Charles Saatchi had offered to fund whatever artwork Hirst wanted to make, and the result was showcased in 1992 in the first Young British Artists exhibition at the Saatchi Gallery in North London. Hirst's work was titled The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living and was a shark in formaldehyde in a vitrine, and sold for ¬£50,000. The shark had been caught by a commissioned fisherman in Australia and had cost ¬£6,000.\\"Saatchi mulls ¬£6.25m shark offer\\", BBC. Retrieved 23 February 2007. The exhibition also included In a Thousand Years. As a result of the show, Hirst was nominated for that year's Turner Prize, but it was awarded to Grenville Davey. Hirst's first major international presentation was in the Venice Biennale in 1993 with the work, Mother and Child Divided, a cow and a calf cut into sections and exhibited in a series of separate vitrines. He curated the show Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he exhibited Away from the Flock (a sheep in a tank of formaldehyde). On 9 May, Mark Bridger, a 35-year-old artist from Oxford, walked into the gallery and poured black ink into the tank, and retitled the work Black Sheep. He was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst's wish, and was given two years' probation. The sculpture was restored at a cost of ¬£1,000. When a photograph of Away from the Flock was reproduced in the 1997 book by Hirst I want to spend the rest of my life everywhere, with everyone, one-to-one, always, forever, now, the vandalism was referenced by allowing the tank to be obscured by pulling a card, reproducing the effect of ink being poured into the tank; this resulted in Hirst being sued by Bridger for violating his copyright on Black Sheep. =1995‚Äì1999= In 1995, Hirst won the Turner Prize. New York public health officials banned Two Fucking and Two Watching featuring a rotting cow and bull, because of fears of \\"vomiting among the visitors\\".

No Sense of Absolute Corruption, his first solo show in the Gagosian Gallery in New York was staged the following year. In London the short film, Hanging Around, was shown‚Äîwritten and directed by Hirst and starring Eddie Izzard. In 1997 the Sensation exhibition opened at the Royal Academy in London.

With Alex James of the band Blur and actor Keith Allen, he formed the band Fat Les, achieving a number 2 hit with a raucous football- themed song Vindaloo, followed up by Jerusalem with the London Gay Men's Chorus. Hirst also painted a simple colour pattern for the Beagle 2 probe. This pattern was to be used to calibrate the probe's cameras after it had landed on Mars.

In September 2000, in New York, Larry Gagosian held the Hirst show, Damien Hirst: Models, Methods, Approaches, Assumptions, Results and Findings. 100,000 people visited the show in 12 weeks and all the work was sold. On 10 September 2002, on the eve of the first anniversary of the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, Hirst said in an interview with BBC News Online: The next week, following public outrage at his remarks, he issued a statement through his company, Science Ltd: In 2002, Hirst gave up smoking and drinking after his wife Maia had complained and \\"had to move out because I was so horrible\\". He had met Joe Strummer (former lead singer of The Clash) at Glastonbury in 1995, becoming good friends and going on annual family holidays with him. Just before Christmas 2002, Strummer died of a heart attack. This had a profound effect on Hirst, who said, \\"It was the first time I felt mortal.\\" He subsequently devoted a lot of time to founding a charity, Strummerville, to help young musicians. In April 2003, the Saatchi Gallery opened at new premises in County Hall, London, with a show that included a Hirst retrospective. This brought a developing strain in his relationship with Saatchi to a head (one source of contention had been who was most responsible for boosting their mutual profile). Hirst disassociated himself from the retrospective to the extent of not including it in his CV. He was angry that a Mini car that he had decorated for charity with his trademark spots was being exhibited as a serious artwork. The show also scuppered a prospective Hirst retrospective at Tate Modern. He said Saatchi was \\"childish\\" and \\"I'm not Charles Saatchi's barrel-organ monkey ...

Inside the gallery downstairs were 12 vitrines representing Jesus's disciples, each case containing mostly gruesome, often blood-stained, items relevant to the particular disciple. At the end was an empty vitrine, representing Christ. Upstairs were four small glass cases, each containing a cow's head stuck with scissors and knives.

Hirst had sold these pieces to Saatchi in the early 1990s for rather less, his first installations costing under ¬£10,000. On 24 May 2004, a fire in the Momart storage warehouse destroyed many works from the Saatchi collection, including 17 of Hirst's, although the sculpture Charity survived, as it was outside in the builder's yard. That July, Hirst said of Saatchi, \\"I respect Charles. There's not really a feud. If I see him, we speak, but we were never really drinking buddies.\\" Hirst designed a cover image for the Band Aid 20 charity single featuring the \\"Grim Reaper\\" in late 2004, and image showing an African child perched on his knee. This design was not to the liking of the record company executives, and was replaced by reindeer in the snow standing next to a child. In December 2004, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living was sold by Saatchi to American collector Steve Cohen, for $8 million, in a deal negotiated by Hirst's New York agent, Gagosian. Cohen, a Greenwich hedge fund manager, then donated the work to The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Sir Nicholas Serota had wanted to acquire it for the Tate Gallery, and Hugo Swire, Shadow Minister for the Arts, tabled a question to ask if the government would ensure it stayed in the country. =2005‚Äì2009= Hirst exhibited 30 paintings at the Gagosian Gallery in New York in March 2005. These had taken 3¬Ω years to complete. They were closely based on photos, mostly by assistants (who were rotated between paintings) but with a final finish by Hirst. Also in 2005, Hirst founded the art book publisher Other Criteria. In February 2006, he opened a major show in Mexico, at the Hilario Galguera Gallery, called The Death of God, Towards a Better Understanding of Life without God aboard The Ship of Fools, an exhibition that attracted considerable media coverage as Hirst's first show in Latin America. In June that year, he exhibited alongside the work of Francis Bacon (Triptychs) at the Gagosian Gallery, Britannia Street, London, an exhibition that included the vitrine, A Thousand Years (1990), and four triptychs: paintings, medicine cabinets and a new formaldehyde work entitled The Tranquility of Solitude (For George Dyer), influenced by Bacon.

Major works and events Some of Hirst's principal works are as follows. =The Physical Impossibilities of Death in the Mind of Someone Living= This artwork features a large tiger shark suspended in formaldehyde. The tank in which the shark is floating creates the illusion of the animal being cut into three pieces due to the container looking like three separate sections. The work was created in 1991, and since then, the formaldehyde preserving the shark has slowly eaten away at the animal's body, which shows signs of decay. Hirst says that the formaldehyde surrounding the shark is the process of death and decay. Some critics argue that the minimalistic qualities of the work, coinciding with the 'stereotypical' death theme, are too bland for such a prestigious artist. One critic wrote, \\"But the famous shark, shackled to its coffeebar-existentialist title ‚Äì The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living ‚Äì seems ever more dilapidated, more fairground sideshow, with every dowdy showing. What clich√©d menace it may once have theoretically possessed has evaporated.\\" Another art critic, Luke White, disagrees, saying that others had earlier perceived sharks \\"...as ugly and dangerous, but by the end of the century, they found them instead exhilarating, fascinating, and sublime.\\" White argues that sharks have been seen as transcendent, awe-inspiring creatures throughout centuries, a creature that is the embodiment of sublimitude as well as a metaphorical representation of our mind helps, relaying the importance of how special our thoughts really are. =Beautiful Inside My Head Forever= Beautiful Inside My Head Forever was a two-day auction of Hirst's new work at Sotheby's, London, taking place on 15 and 16 September 2008.Akbar, Arifa.

Critical responses =Positive= Hirst has been praised in recognition of his celebrity and the way this has galvanised interest in the arts, raising the profile of British art and helping to (re)create the image of \\"Cool Britannia.\\" In the mid-1990s, the then-Heritage Secretary, Virginia Bottomley recognised him as \\"a pioneer of the British art movement\\", and even sheep farmers were pleased he had raised increased interest in British lamb. Janet Street-Porter praised his originality, which had brought art to new audiences and was the \\"art-world equivalent of the Oasis concerts at Earl's Court\\". Andres Serrano is also known for shocking work and understands that contemporary fame does not necessarily equate to lasting fame, but backs Hirst: \\"Damien is very clever ... First you get the attention ... Whether or not it will stand the test of time, I don't know, but I think it will.\\" Sir Nicholas Serota commented, \\"Damien is something of a showman ... It is very difficult to be an artist when there is huge public and media attention.

Hirst said that he only painted five spot paintings himself because, \\"I couldn't be fucking arsed doing it\\"; he described his efforts as \\"shite\\"‚Äî\\"They're shit compared to ... the best person who ever painted spots for me was Rachel.

Hirst told her to, \\"'make one of your own.' And she said, 'No, I want one of yours.' But the only difference, between one painted by her and one of mine, is the money.'\\" By February 1999, two assistants had painted 300 spot paintings. Hirst sees the real creative act as being the conception, not the execution, and that, as the progenitor of the idea, he is therefore the artist: Hirst is also known to volunteer repair work on his projects after a client has made a purchase. For example, this service was offered in the case of the suspended shark purchased by Steven A. Cohen. =Restaurant ventures= Hirst had a short-lived partnership with chef Marco Pierre White in the restaurant \\"Quo Vadis\\".

The last seven years of his life he also was the stadtholder of Groningen (1640-1647). As the leading soldier in the Dutch wars against Spain, his main achievement was the successful Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629. It was the main Spanish base and a well-fortified city protected by an experienced Spanish garrison and by formidable water defenses. His strategy was the successful neutralization of the threat of inundation of the area around 's-Hertogenbosch and his capture of the Spanish storehouse at Wesel.Israel, The Dutch Republic (1995) p 507 Biography =Early life= Frederick Henry was born on 29 January 1584 in Delft, Holland, Dutch Republic. He was the youngest child of William the Silent and Louise de Coligny. His father William was stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, and Friesland. His mother Louise was daughter of the Huguenot leader Gaspard de Coligny, and was the fourth wife of his father. He was thus the half brother of his predecessor Maurice of Orange, deceased in 1625. Frederick Henry was born six months before his father's assassination on 10 July 1584. The boy was trained to arms by his elder brother Maurice, one of the finest generals of his age. After Maurice threatened to legitimize his illegitimate children if he did not marry, Frederick Henry married Amalia of Solms-Braunfels in 1625. His illegitimate son by Margaretha Catharina Bruyns (1595‚Äì1625), Frederick Nassau de Zuylestein was born in 1624 before his marriage. This son later became the governor of the young William III of England for seven years. =Stadtholder= Engraving of Frederick Henry by Anselm van Hulle On the death of Maurice in 1625 without legitimate issue, Frederick Henry succeeded him in his paternal dignities and estates, and also in the stadtholderates of the five provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Overijssel and Guelders, and in the important posts of captain and admiral- general of the Union (commander-in-chief of the Dutch States Army and of the Dutch navy). Frederick Henry proved himself almost as good a general as his brother, and a far more capable statesman and politician. For twenty-two years he remained at the head of government in the United Provinces, and in his time the power of the stadtholderate reached its highest point. The \\"Period of Frederick Henry,\\" as it is usually styled by Dutch writers, is generally accounted the golden age of the republic. It was marked by great military and naval triumphs, by worldwide maritime and commercial expansion, and by a wonderful outburst of activity in the domains of art and literature. The chief military exploits of Frederick Henry were the sieges and captures of Grol in 1627, 's-Hertogenbosch in 1629, of Maastricht in 1632, of Breda in 1637, of Sas van Gent in 1644, and of Hulst in 1645. During the greater part of his administration the alliance with France against Spain had been the pivot of Frederick Henry's foreign policy, but in his last years he sacrificed the French alliance for the sake of concluding a separate peace with Spain, by which the United Provinces obtained from that power all the advantages they had been seeking for eighty years. Frederick Henry built the country houses Huis Honselaarsdijk, Huis ter Nieuwburg, and for his wife Huis ten Bosch, and he renovated the Noordeinde Palace in The Hague. Huis Honselaarsdijk and Huis ter Nieuwburg are now demolished. =Death= Frederick Henry died on 14 March 1647 in The Hague, Holland, Dutch Republic. He left his wife Amalia of Solms- Braunfels, his son William II, Prince of Orange, four of his daughters, and his illegitimate son Frederick Nassau de Zuylestein. On Frederick Henry's death, he was buried with great pomp beside his father and brother at Delft. The treaty of Munster, ending the long struggle between the Dutch and the Spaniards, was not actually signed until 30 January 1648, the illness and death of the stadtholder having caused a delay in the negotiations. Frederick Henry left an account of his campaigns in his M√©moires de Fr√©d√©ric Henri (Amsterdam, 1743). See Cambridge Mod. Hist. vol. iv. chap. 24. His widow commissioned an elaborate mausoleum in the Oranjezaal, a panoramic painted ballroom with scenes from his life and allegories of good government based on his achievements. Children Frederick Henry and his family, by Gerard van Honthorst Frederick Henry and his wife Amalia of Solms-Braunfels had nine children, being seven daughters and two sons. Four of their children, including one son, died in childhood, leaving Frederick Henry with only a single son as heir. Ultimately, after the death of Frederick Henry's only male-line grandson, the stadtholdership was to pass to a distant agnatic cousin, who was married to Frederick Henry's daughter Albertine Agnes. Frederick Henry's children were: * William II, Prince of Orange (27 May 16266 November 1650) * Luise Henriette of Nassau (27 December 162718 June 1667) * Henri√´tte Amalia of Nassau (26 October 1628December 1628) * Elisabeth of Nassau (4 August 1630) * Isabella Charlotte of Nassau (22 January/28 April 163217 May 1642) * Albertine Agnes of Nassau (9 April 163424 May 1696) * Henriette Catherine of Nassau (10 February 16373 November 1708) * Hendrik Lodewijk of Nassau (30 November 163919 December 1639) * Maria of Nassau (5 September 164217/20 March 1688) * Alexandra of Nassau (1644‚Äî1670) Frederick Henry recognized one illegitimate child by Margaretha Catharina Bruyns: * Frederick Nassau, lord of Zuylestein (1624‚Äì1672)  Coat of arms and titles  Gartered arms of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange 1Arms of Frederick Henry used as Prince of Orange Frederick Henry, besides being Stadholder of several provinces and Captain-General, both non-hereditary and appointive titles: Stadtholder of Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel; he was the hereditary sovereign of the principality of Orange in what is today Provence in France.

It is a product of the Solvay process used to produce sodium carbonate: :CO2 \\\\+ 2 NH3 \\\\+ 2 NaCl + H2O ‚Üí 2 NH4Cl + Na2CO3 In addition to being the principal method for the manufacture of ammonium chloride, that method is used to minimize ammonia release in some industrial operations. Ammonium chloride is prepared commercially by combining ammonia (NH3) with either hydrogen chloride (gas) or hydrochloric acid (water solution): :NH3 \\\\+ HCl ‚Üí NH4Cl Ammonium chloride occurs naturally in volcanic regions, forming on volcanic rocks near fume- releasing vents (fumaroles). The crystals deposit directly from the gaseous state and tend to be short-lived, as they dissolve easily in water. Reactions Ammonium chloride pyrolyses and reforms into ammonium chloride smoke after cooling. Ammonium chloride appears to sublime upon heating but actually decomposes into ammonia and hydrogen chloride gas. : NH4Cl ‚Üí NH3 \\\\+ HCl Ammonium chloride reacts with a strong base, like sodium hydroxide, to release ammonia gas: : NH4Cl + NaOH ‚Üí NH3 \\\\+ NaCl + H2O Similarly, ammonium chloride also reacts with alkali metal carbonates at elevated temperatures, giving ammonia and alkali metal chloride: : 2 NH4Cl + Na2CO3 ‚Üí 2 NaCl + CO2 \\\\+ H2O + 2 NH3 A 5% by weight solution of ammonium chloride in water has a pH in the range 4.6 to 6.0. Some of ammonium chloride's reactions with other chemicals are endothermic like its reaction with barium hydroxide and its dissolving in water. Applications Ammonium chloride crystal(s) The dominant application of ammonium chloride is as a nitrogen source in fertilizers (corresponding to 90% of the world production of ammonium chloride) such as chloroammonium phosphate. The main crops fertilized this way are rice and wheat in Asia.Zapp, Karl-Heinz (2012) \\"Ammonium Compounds\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Ammonium chloride was used in pyrotechnics in the 18th century but was superseded by safer and less hygroscopic chemicals. Its purpose was to provide a chlorine donor to enhance the green and blue colours from copper ions in the flame. It had a secondary use to provide white smoke, but its ready double decomposition reaction with potassium chlorate producing the highly unstable ammonium chlorate made its use very dangerous. =Metalwork= Ammonium chloride is used as a flux in preparing metals to be tin coated, galvanized or soldered. It works as a flux by cleaning the surface of workpieces by reacting with the metal oxides at the surface to form a volatile metal chloride. For that purpose, it is sold in blocks at hardware stores for use in cleaning the tip of a soldering iron, and it can also be included in solder as flux. =Medicine= Ammonium chloride is used as an expectorant in cough medicine. Its expectorant action is caused by irritative action on the bronchial mucosa, which causes the production of excess respiratory tract fluid, which presumably is easier to cough up. Ammonium salts are an irritant to the gastric mucosa and may induce nausea and vomiting. Ammonium chloride is used as a systemic acidifying agent in treatment of severe metabolic alkalosis, in oral acid loading test to diagnose distal renal tubular acidosis, to maintain the urine at an acid pH in the treatment of some urinary-tract disorders. =Food= Ammonium chloride, under the name sal ammoniac or salmiak is used as food additive under the E number E510, working as a yeast nutrient in breadmaking and as an acidifier. It is a feed supplement for cattle and an ingredient in nutritive media for yeasts and many microorganisms. Ammonium chloride is used to spice up dark sweets called salmiak (popular in Nordic and other nearby countries), in baking to give cookies a very crisp texture, and in the liquor Salmiakki Koskenkorva for flavouring. In Iran, Tajikistan, India, Pakistan and Arab countries it is called \\"Noshader\\" and is used to improve the crispness of snacks such as samosas and jalebi. =In the laboratory= Ammonium chloride has been used historically to produce low temperatures in cooling baths. Ammonium chloride solutions with ammonia are used as buffer solutions including ACK (Ammonium-Chloride-Potassium) lysis buffer.ACK Lysis Buffer. Cshprotocols.cshlp.org (2014-11-01). Retrieved on 2018-01-23. In paleontology, ammonium chloride vapor is deposited on fossils, where the substance forms a brilliant white, easily removed and fairly harmless and inert layer of tiny crystals. That covers up any coloration the fossil may have, and if lighted at an angle highly enhances contrast in photographic documentation of three-dimensional specimens. The same technique is applied in archaeology to eliminate reflection on glass and similar specimens for photography.Home - BCIN . Bcin.ca (2017-08-01). Retrieved on 2018-01-23. In organic synthesis saturated NH4Cl solution is typically used to quench reaction mixtures. =Flotation= Giant squid and some other large squid species maintain neutral buoyancy in seawater through an ammonium chloride solution which is found throughout their bodies and is less dense than seawater. This differs from the method of flotation used by most fish, which involves a gas-filled swim bladder. =Batteries= Around the turn of the 20th century, ammonium chloride was used in aqueous solution as the electrolyte in Leclanch√© cells that found a commercial use as the \\"local battery\\" in subscribers' telephone installations. Those cells later evolved into zinc‚Äìcarbon batteries still using ammonium chloride as electrolyte. =Other applications= Ammonium chloride is used in a ~5% aqueous solution to work on oil wells with clay swelling problems. Other uses include in hair shampoo, in the glue that bonds plywood, and in cleaning products. In hair shampoo, it is used as a thickening agent in ammonium-based surfactant systems such as ammonium lauryl sulfate. Ammonium chloride is used in the textile and leather industry, in dyeing, tanning, textile printing and cotton clustering. In woodworking, a solution of ammonium chloride and water, when applied to unfinished wood, will burn when subjected to a heat gun resulting in a branding iron mark without use of a branding iron. The solution can be painted onto the wood or applied with a common rubber stamp.  History  The earliest mention of ammonium chloride was in 554 A.D. in China.That ammonium chloride was imported into China from Sogdiana in Central Asia is mentioned in the Wei shu (History of the Wei [peoples of what is now China]), which was compiled by Wei Shou È≠èÊî∂ (506‚Äì572 A.D.). (Sutton et al., 2008), p. 596. However, it may have been imported into China even before 150 A.D.: there is a brief mention of what might have been ammonium chloride in the Chinese Chou I Tshan Thung Chhi Chu Âë®ÊòìÂèÇÂêåÂ•ëË®ª [The Kinship of the Three and the Book of Changes, with Commentary] (142 A.D.) by Wei Boyang. Needham et al., p. 439. At that time, ammonium chloride came from two sources: (1) the vents of underground coal fires in Central Asia, specifically, in the Tian Shan mountains (which extend from Xinjiang province of northwestern China through Kyrgyzstan) as well as in the Alay (or Alai) mountains of southwestern Kyrgyzstan, and (2) the fumaroles of the volcano Mount Taftan in southeastern Iran.The locations of the sources of ammonium chloride in the burning coal deposits of Central Asia are shown on the following map: * Sutton et al., pp. 595-596, especially Fig. 6 (map). Ammonium chloride was also found in burning coal deposits in Europe. * Jameson, Robert, Manual of Mineralogy ‚Ä¶ (Edinburgh, Scotland: Archibald Constable & Co. and Hurst, Robinson & Co., 1821), p. 12.

[in French] The Arab geographer Yaqut al- Hamawi (1179‚Äì1229) or \\"Jakut\\" mentioned that ammonium chloride was harvested from \\"Damindan\\" (Tamindan), a valley on the volcano Mount Taftan in southwestern Iran. See: von Lippmann, E.O., \\"Wan and wof√ºr erscheint zuerst die Bezeichnung Ammoniak?\\" (When and why did the term \\"ammonia\\" first appear?)

In discussing ancient China's sources of ammonium chloride. Needham et al., p. 439: \\"The most westerly region of all [of the regions that produce ammonium chloride] lies further to the south, in Persian Baluchistan, where the DamindƒÅn (now Tamindan) valley in the K≈´h-i-Taftan range, a relatively inactive volcanic massif, produces sal ammoniac [i.e., ammonium chloride] down to this day.\\"Ammonium chloride was later harvested from other volcanoes: The Arabs harvested it from Mount Etna in Sicily during the 10th century. * The Arab geographer Al-Muqaddasi (c. 945/946 - 991) mentioned that ammonium chloride was obtained from Mt. Etna. See: Lippmann, Edmund Oskar von, Entstehung und Ausbreitung der Alchemie ‚Ä¶ (Origin and Spread of Alchemy ‚Ä¶ ), vol. 1, (Berlin, Germany: Springer, 1919), p. 404.

Etna. * Sutton et al., p. 595. Europeans later harvested it from the Solfatara crater and Mount Vesuvius near Naples, Italy. * Breislak, Scipion, Essais mineralogiques sur la solfatare de Pouzzole (Naples, Italy: Janvier Giaccio, 1792), p. 140.

Ammonium chloride was also found on the island of R√©union in the western Indian Ocean. * Marcellin, Jean Baptiste Genevi√®ve, Baron Bory de Saint-Vincent, Dictionnaire classique d'histoire naturelle, vol. 1 (Paris, France: Rey et Gravier, 1822). p. 270: \\"On trouve ce Min√©ral dans presque tous les volcans. ‚Ä¶ Elle se trouve √©galement en Tartarie, dans le pays des Kalmuks; en Perse, au Thibet, dans l'√Æle de Bourbon, en Bucharie, ‚Ä¶ \\" (One finds this mineral [i.e., ammonium chloride] in nearly every volcano ‚Ä¶ It is found also in Tartary [i.e., a region extending from Central Asia eastwards to the Pacific Ocean], in the country of the Kalmyks, in Persia, in Tibet, on Bourbon Island [i.e., R√©union], in Bucharia [i.e., a region of Central Asia extending from Turfan through Uzbekistan and Tajikistan ] ‚Ä¶ ) Ammonium chloride was subsequently found at Mount Hekla in Iceland, Mount Chinyero on Tenerife in the Canary Islands, and the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes in Alaska. * Bunsen, Robert (1847) \\"Ueber den innern Zusammenhang der pseudovulkanischen Erscheinungen Islands\\" (On the intrinsic relationship of pseudo-volcanic phenomena of Iceland), Annalen der Chemie and Pharmacie, 62 : 1‚Äì59, see pp. 8‚Äì9. From pp. 8‚Äì9: \\"Im Juli 1846, also nur wenige Monate nach dem Ausbruch des Vulkans, wo ich in diesen Gegenden verweilte, zeigte sich der untere Theil dieses Stromes mit dampfenden Fumarolen √ºbers√§et, in denen sich eine solche Menge reiner, zum Theil sehr sch√∂n krystallisirter Salmiak sublimirte, dass man dort, trotz der unaufh√∂rlichen Regeng√ºsse, dieses wertvolle Salz zu Hunderten von Pfunden h√§tte sammeln k√∂nnen.\\" (In July 1846, thus only months after the eruption of the volcano [i.e., Mt.

Sutton et al., p. 599. (Indeed, the word for ammonium chloride in several Asian languages derives from the Iranian phrase anosh adur (immortal fire), a reference to the underground fires.The term for \\"ammonium chloride\\" in Arabic is n≈´shƒÅdir or n≈´shƒÅdur, in Sanskit, navasadaru or navasara, in Chinese, nao sha, and similarly in Armenian and Syriac. Sutton et al., p. 596.) Ammonium chloride was then transported along the Silk Road eastwards to China and westwards to the Muslim lands and Europe. Around 800 A.D. the Arabs of Egypt discovered ammonium chloride in the soot that resulted from burning camel dung, and this source became an alternative to those in Central Asia.In De Lapidibus (About Stones), which is attributed to \\"Pseudo-Aristotle\\" and which dates from ca. 750‚Äì870 A.D., is a brief statement that ammonium chloride was created at the public baths (from the soot of the fires that served to heat the bath waters). Ruska, Julius, Das Steinbuch des Aristoteles mit literargeschichtlichen Untersuchungen nach der arabischen Handschrift der Biblioth√®que Nationale [The book of stones of Aristotle with literary- historical investigations into the Arabic manuscript of the Biblioth√®que Nationale] (Heidelberg, Germany: Carl Winter, 1912), p. 191.

See also: Sutton et al., p. 595.The Persian geographer Al-Istakhri (d. 957 A.D.) stated that ammonium chloride was obtained from the soot of camel dung that was burned to heat the public baths in Alexandria. See: (Lippmann, 1919), p. 403. From p. 403: Istakhri \\" ‚Ä¶ best√§tigt das persische Vorkommen ‚Ä¶ des N√ªsch√¢dirs, 'den die √Ñgypter aus dem Rauche ihrer B√§der haben' [aus dem Rauche des zum Heizen gebr√§uchlichen getrockneten Kamelmistes], ‚Ä¶ \\" (Istakhri confirms the occurrence in Persia ‚Ä¶ of ammonium chloride (n√ªsh√¢dir), \\"which the Egyptians have [obtained] from the smoke of their baths\\" [i.e., from the smoke of the dried camel dung that's used for heating] ‚Ä¶ ) See also: Sutton et al., p. 595. The production of ammonium chloride from the soot of burned animal dung was reported early in the 18th century by a number of European observers: * Sicard, Claude (S.J.), Nouveaux M√©moires de la Compagnie de Jesus dans le Levant [New memoirs of the Jesuits in the Levant], vol. 2 (Paris, France: Nicolas le Clerc, 1717), pp. 96‚Äì98. From pp. 96‚Äì98: \\" ‚Ä¶ nous arriv√¢mes sur le midy √† Desmayer ‚Ä¶ \\" ( ‚Ä¶ we arrived at midday at Desmayer, a town [in the Nile delta] which is inhabited only by Muslims. It is in this place that the most esteemed sal armoniac [i.e., ammonium chloride] in all Egypt is made. This salt is made in ovens, whose top is vented lengthwise and in several places. One places in these vents twenty or thirty round glass bottles, about a foot and a half in diameter, with a neck of half a foot [across]. The bottles are sealed well: filled with soot and a little sea salt, and animal urine. Then one constructs a layer of loam and brick [on top of the oven], which covers everything except the tops of the bottles' necks, which [remain open] to the air. Then a fire is lit in the oven, and it is maintained continually for three days and three nights. The phlegm [i.e., liquid components] of the material contained in the bottles is driven off, and the acid salts and alkalies meet and cling to each other near the neck, [where they] form a white, round mass. The operation being completed, all of the bottles are broken, and these masses are removed, which are called \\"sal armoniac\\". It is to be noted that the soot of which I spoke, is produced by the smoke of pats, which is called gell√©e in Arabic. They [i.e., the pats] are formed from animal manure. Any other smoke is unlikely to condense into sal armoniac.) * Geoffroy, √âtienne (1720) \\"Observations sur la nature et la composition du sel ammoniac\\" (Observations on the nature and composition of ammonium chloride), Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences: ann√©e MDCCXX, avec les memoires ‚Ä¶ , pp. 189‚Äì191. * Lemere (1719) \\"Adress√© √† l'Acad√©mie sur le sel ammoniac, etc.\\" (Address to the [French Royal] Academy [of Sciences] on ammonium chloride, etc.), Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences: ann√©e MDCCXX, avec les memoires ‚Ä¶ , pp. 191‚Äì194. * (Lemere) (1716) \\"Observations sur la nature et la composition du sel ammoniac,\\" Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences: ann√©e MDCCXX, avec les memoires ‚Ä¶ , pp. 195‚Äì207. On p. 202, Lemere states that ammonium chloride can be made by combining ammonium carbonate and hydrochloric acid: \\"L'on prend de l'esprit ou du sel volatil d'urine; on jette dessus de l'esprit de sel marin, jusqu'√† ce qu'il ne se fasse plus de fermentation; on fait √©vaporer au sable la liqueur, qui, √©tant s√©che, fournit un sel sal√© qui a les m√™mes effets que le sel ammoniac.\\" (One takes the spirit or volatile salt of urine [i.e., ammonium carbonate]; one tosses on it spirit of sea salt [i.e., hydrochloric acid], until it no longer makes fermentation [i.e., effervesces]; one evaporates, on a sand [bath], the solution, which, [upon] being dry, furnishes a salty solid which has the same effects as ammonium chloride.) * Duhamel du Monceau, Henri-Louis (1735) \\"Sur le sel ammoniac,\\" Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences: ann√©e MDCCXXXV, avec les memoires ‚Ä¶ , pp. 106‚Äì116; 414‚Äì434; 483‚Äì504.

After some personnel changes in the late 1980s, the band gained international fame as a duo consisting of Konishi and vocalist Maki Nomiya. With their music blending together 1960s pop, jazz and synth-pop, the group were a prominent component in the Shibuya-kei movement of the 1990s. Pizzicato Five was a hugely prolific group during its existence, usually releasing at least an album each year in addition to various EPs and remix albums. Their music has appeared in numerous movies, television episodes, and video games. History =1980s= Pizzicato V had its beginnings in 1979 when Yasuharu Konishi and Keitar≈ç Takanami were attending university, first meeting each other at a local music society conference. Ry≈ç Kamomiya, Mamiko Sasaki, and Shigeo Miyata were soon recruited after a few years. Miyata left the group almost immediately but the four remaining members kept the name Pizzicato V. The band released its first single on Haruomi Hosono's Non-Standard label (Teichiku Records), a 12-inch EP called Audrey Hepburn Complex which was produced by Hosono in 1985.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 456 They followed this with the Pizzicato V in Action EP. In 1986, Pizzicato V signed with CBS/Sony (now Sony Music Entertainment Japan). In 1987, the band released their first all-new album, Couples. It was a commercial failure, and the record company began pressuring the band to find a new lead singer. Kamomiya and Sasaki decided to quit. Takao Tajima, Original Love's frontman, joined the band soon as the new vocalist. He decided to work at these two bands. With Tajima, the band released its second album, Belissima! in 1988. The next two albums, 1989's On Her Majesty's Request and 1990's Soft Landing on the Moon were also commercial failures. =1990s= Textlogo of Pizzicato Five In 1990, Maki Nomiya, who had previously released one solo album, joined as the third lead vocalist. Takao Tajima left to concentrate on his own band Original Love. In 1991, Pizzicato Five signed with Nippon Columbia/Seven Gods (later Triad Records). Following three EPs showcasing Nomiya's vocals, Pizzicato Five released This Year's Girl. Inspired by the advent of sampling (De La Soul's 3 Feet High and Rising is said to have been a major influence), the group put together a sound which would help start the burgeoning Shibuya-kei scene. The album would spawn two of their best-known songs: \\"Twiggy Twiggy\\" and \\"Baby Love Child\\". 1992 saw a change in direction as the clubby Sweet Pizzicato Five was released. The band began to get increasing exposure via the theme songs it recorded for television dramas (a common practice for pop bands in Japan) achieving widespread fame with the 1993 single \\"Sweet Soul Revue\\", which was featured in a major spring advertising campaign for Kao Corporation (Kanebo Cosmetics). In December, the single (literally, 7 p.m. in Tokyo) became another smash hit after it was used as the opening theme of the children's television programme UgoUgo R≈´ga Ni-g≈ç. The band's American debut came in 1994 with the release of the EP Five By Five on Matador Records. This was quickly followed by a full-length album, Made in USA, a compilation of tracks from their last three Japanese albums which sold 200,000 copies worldwide. Shortly before the release of the next album Overdose in the same year, Keitar≈ç Takanami quit the band, leaving Konishi and Nomiya as the only remaining members. In February 1995 the two set off on a successful 14-stop tour of Europe and America. Another compilation, The Sound of Music was released in October 1995, again featuring various tracks from the Maki-era albums. After the 1996 release of the album Romantique 96 and several singles including the hit Baby Portable Rock, in 1997 the band formed its own label, Readymade Records, and released the commercially successful album Happy End of the World ‚Äì the only album to be released unchanged in both Japan and the rest of the world. In 1998, the band released The International Playboy & Playgirl Record in Japan. It would be released a year later worldwide with a slightly different track-listing and the shortened title (which was also its Japanese title) of \\"Playboy & Playgirl\\". 1999 came and Pizzicato Five released the \\"JBL Maxisonic\\" series of EPs, followed by the album Pizzicato Five‚Ñ¢. It included songs from each of the 3 EPs in very different forms: \\"Darlin' of Discoth√®que\\" is shorter and instrumental, \\"A Perfect World\\" is a lounge-style rearrangement sung by guest vocalist Mieko Hirota and the new song \\"20th Century Girl\\" is based on the B-side \\"Room Service\\", originally written by Masumi Arichika of TV Jesus. =Final years= In 2000, Matador Records released Pizzicato Five‚Ñ¢ under the somewhat less confusing name of The Fifth Release From Matador. The CD version of this left out the first song \\"Love Again\\" but added three extra tracks (one from each of the JBL Maxisonic EPs), while the LP version shared the same title but deviated still further from the original track-listing. It would also be Pizzicato Five's last American release. 2001 saw the Japanese release of the album √á√† et l√† du Japon and the announcement that the band was to break up, followed by a series of live events featuring guest performances by old members and two further \\"Big Hits and Jet Lags\\" albums ‚Äì Pizzicato Five R.I.P.

Biography F. A. Lange. Lange was born in Wald, near Solingen, the son of the theologian, Johann Peter Lange. He was educated at Duisburg, Z√ºrich and Bonn, where he distinguished himself in gymnastics as much as academically. In 1852 he became a schoolmaster at Cologne; in 1853 Privatdozent in philosophy at Bonn; and in 1858 schoolmaster at Duisburg, resigning when the government forbade schoolmasters to take part in political activities. Lange entered journalism as editor of the Rhein- und Ruhr-Zeitung in 1862 in the cause of political and social reform. His ceterum censeo can be considered to be the repeated demand for Bismarck's resignation. He was prominent in public affairs, yet found enough time to write most of his best-known books, Die Leibes√ºbungen (1863), Die Arbeiterfrage (1865, 5th ed. 1894), Geschichte des Materialismus (1866), and John Stuart Mills Ansichten √ºber die soziale Frage (1866). He also wrote a number of works on pedagogy and psychology. In 1863, Lange supported the socialist leader Ferdinand Lassalle in an important trial concerning the constitutional guarantee of academic freedom. From 1864 to 1866, Lange was a member of the executive committee of the Association of German Labour Unions (Verband Deutscher Arbeitervereine), an early organisation of the German labour movement. One of his colleagues there was August Bebel, the Social-Democratic leader who wrote of him that \\"he had a short and strong figure, and was of a sympathetic presence. He had magnificent eyes, and was one of the most amiable men whom I have ever known. He won the hearts of people at first sight\\" while also describing him as of \\"firm character\\".https://www.marxists.org/archive/bebel/1911/reminiscences/ch07.htm In 1866, discouraged by affairs in Germany, he moved to Winterthur, near Z√ºrich, to become connected with the democratic newspaper, Winterthurer Landbote. In 1869 he was Privatdozent at Z√ºrich, and the next year he was appointed professor of inductive philosophy, a new position. He was also engaged in the Swiss Democratic movement and helped write the constitution of the Canton of Zurich. This was distinguished by the use of ‚Äúdirect democratic‚Äù measures such as referendum and recall. Still in Z√ºrich he recognized first signs of his illness, which led several years later to his death. The strong French sympathies of the Swiss in the Franco-Prussian War as well as the prospect for a pension for his wife in the case of his death led to his speedy resignation. He had an offer from the universities of W√ºrzburg, K√∂nigsberg, Kiel, Gie√üen and Jena, but in 1872 he accepted a professorship at the University of Marburg. He is sometimes credited with founding the Marburg School of neo-Kantianism, along with his star pupil, Hermann Cohen. It was Cohen, however, who pioneered the Marburg School's characteristic logicist interpretation of Kantian philosophy. In later years, Lange accepted Cohen's refutation of a psychological interpretation of the a priori, to which he himself had once subscribed. Although he rejected Marxist materialism, Lange continued to influence the German Social-Democratic movement. He favoured an ethically motivated, reformist socialism. He especially influenced some leaders of the Lassallean General German Workers' Union and, posthumously, the Revisionist theoretician Eduard Bernstein, whose slogan \\"Kant, not cant\\" proclaimed his abandonment of Marxian \\"scientific socialism\\" in favour of a neo-Kantian, ethically based social reformism. Subsequent leaders of the Marburg School, such as Cohen and Natorp, continued this association with the reformist wing of the SPD. Unhappily, his body was already stricken with disease. He no longer played a role in the unification of the Lassalleans with Bebel's socialists into the unified SPD in May 1875. After a lingering illness, probably gastro-intestinal cancer, he died in Marburg in November of that year. His Logische Studien (Logical Studies) were published by Hermann Cohen in 1877. Lange also wrote a number of literary studies which were published posthumously. His main work, the Geschichte des Materialismus is a didactic exposition of principles rather than a history in the proper sense. According to Lange, to think clearly about materialism is to refute it. There is a comprehensive school named after him, the Friedrich-Albert-Lange- Gesamtschule, in Wald, his birthplace, which is now part of the city of Solingen.

Essence-Function (), a key concept in East Asian Buddhism and particularly Korean Buddhism, was refined in the syncretic philosophy and world view of Wonhyo.Muller, Charles A. (1995). \\"The Key Operative Concepts in Korean Buddhist Syncretic Philosophy: Interpenetration (ÈÄöÈÅî) and Essence-Function (È´îÁî®) in W≈ènhyo, Chinul and Kihwa\\" cited in Bulletin of Toyo Gakuen University No. 3, March 1995, pp 33-48.Source: (accessed: September 18, 2008) As one of the most eminent scholar-monks in Korean history, he was an influential figure in the development of the East Asian Buddhist intellectual and commentarial tradition. His extensive literary output runs to over 80 works in 240 fascicles, and some of his commentaries, such as those on the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra and the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana, became classics revered throughout China and Japan as well as Korea. In fact, his commentary on the Awakening of Faith helped to make it one of the most influential and intensively studied texts in the East Asian MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition. Chinese masters who were heavily influenced by Wonhyo include Fazang, Li Tongxuan, and Chengguan. The Japanese monks Gy≈çnen, Zenshu and Joto of the Kegon school were also influenced by him. With his life spanning the end of the Three Kingdoms of Korea and the beginning of Unified Silla, Wonhyo played a vital role in the reception and assimilation of the broad range of doctrinal Buddhist streams that flowed into the Korean peninsula at the time. Wonhyo was most interested in and affected by Buddha-nature, East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra and Hwaeom thought. However, in his extensive scholarly works, composed as commentaries and essays, he embraced the whole spectrum of the Buddhist teachings which were received in Korea, including such schools as Pure Land Buddhism, East Asian MƒÅdhyamaka and the Tiantai. Biography Bogwangjeon hall at Bunhwangsa, Gyeongju which is a dedicated shrine to Wonhyo. Wonhyo was born in Amnyang (ÊäºÊ¢Å), nowadays the city of Gyeongsan, North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea. He had a son, Seol Chong, who is considered to be one of the great Confucian scholars of Silla. Wonhyo was famous for singing and dancing in the streets. While the Buddha discouraged such behaviors, his songs and dances were seen as upaya, or skillful means, meant to help save all sentient beings. He is thought to have founded Korea's lone riverside temple, Silleuksa, in the late 600s. While Wonhyo was in Bunhwangsa (in modern Guhwang-dong, Gyeongju), he wrote a number of books. For such strong association with Wonhyo, a research center and a shrine named Bogwangjeon hall dedicated to Wonhyo's legacy are located in Bunhwangsa.(in Korean) Î∂ÑÌô©ÏÇ¨ Ï∞ΩÍ±¥Í≥º Ïó≠ÏÇ¨ Establishment and History of Bunhangsa Korea Temple Contribution to commentarial tradition He wrote commentaries on virtually all of the most influential Mahayana scriptures, altogether including over eighty works in over two hundred fascicles. Among his most influential works were the commentaries he wrote on the Awakening of Faith, MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra and VajrasamƒÅdhi s≈´tra, along with his exposition on the meaning of the two hindrances, the ijangui. These were treated with utmost respect by leading Buddhist scholars in China and Japan, and served to help in placing the Awakening of Faith as the most influential text in the Korean tradition. Teaching story Wonhyo spent the earlier part of his career as a monk. In 661 he and a close friend - Uisang (625‚Äì702, founder of the Hwaeom) - were traveling to China where they hoped to study Buddhism further. Somewhere in the region of Baekje, the pair were caught in a heavy downpour and forced to take shelter in what they believed to be an earthen sanctuary. During the night Wonhyo was overcome with thirst, and reaching out grasped what he perceived to be a gourd, and drinking from it was refreshed with a draught of cool, refreshing water. Upon waking the next morning, however, the companions discovered much to their amazement that their shelter was in fact an ancient tomb littered with human skulls, and the vessel from which Wonhyo had drunk was a human skull full of brackish water. Upon seeing this, Wonhyo vomited. Startled by the experience of believing that a gruesome liquid was a refreshing treat, Wonhyo was astonished at the power of the human mind to transform reality.

He left the priesthood and turned to the spreading of the Buddhadharma as a layman. Because of this aspect of his character, Wonhyo ended up becoming a popular folk hero in Korea.Chun Ock-bae, 2010, \\"Why WonhyoNow?,\\" The Korea Times, April 16, p. 14. An important result of his combined work with Uisang was the establishment of Hwaeom as the dominant stream of doctrinal thought on the Korean Peninsula. English translation project  Wonhyo's twenty-three extant works are currently in the process of being translated into English as a joint project between Dongguk University and Stony Brook University. The University of Hawaii Press is publishing them in five volumes. Legacy The International Taekwon-Do Federation pattern \\"Won-Hyo\\" is named in Wonhyo's honor. This pattern consists of 28 movements.

L√ºcke, held several pastorates, and eventually (1854) settled at Bonn as professor of theology in succession to Isaac August Dorner, becoming also in 1860 counsellor to the Coblence Consistory of the old-Prussian Rhenish Ecclesiastical Province. Theology \\"Lange has been called the poetical theologian par excellence: ‚ÄúIt has been said of him that his thoughts succeed each other in such rapid and agitated waves that all calm reflection and all rational distinction become, in a manner, drowned‚Äù (F.

His Christliche Dogmatik (5 vols, 1849‚Äì1852; new edition, 1870) ‚Äúcontains many fruitful and suggestive thoughts, which, however, are hidden under such a mass of bold figures and strange fancies and suffer so much from want of clearness of presentation, that they did not produce any lasting effect‚Äù (Otto Pfleiderer).\\" Writings His other works include Das Leben Jesu (3 vols, 1844‚Äì1847; Eng. trans. 1864 and 1872), Das apostolische Zeitalter (2 vols, 1853‚Äì1854), Grundriss der theologischen Encyklop√§die (1877), Grundriss der christlichen Ethik (1878), and Grundriss der Bibelkunde (1881).

He is considered one of the most celebrated tap dancers of all time. Hines starred in more than forty films and also made his mark on Broadway during his lifetime. He was the recipient of many accolades, including a Daytime Emmy Award, a Drama Desk Award and a Tony Award, as well as nominations for a Screen Actors Guild Award and four Primetime Emmy Awards. Early life Hines was born in New York City on February 14, 1946 to Alma Iola (Lawless) and Maurice Robert Hines, a dancer, musician, and actor, and grew up in the Sugar Hill neighborhood of Manhattan's Harlem. Hines began tap dancing when he was two years old, and began dancing semi professionally at age five. After that, he and his older brother Maurice performed together, studying with choreographer Henry LeTang. Gregory and Maurice also studied with veteran tap dancers, such as Howard Sims and The Nicholas Brothers when they performed at the same venues. The two brothers were known as The Hines Kids, making nightclub appearances at venues in Miami, Florida, with Cab Calloway. They were later known as \\"The Hines Brothers.\\" When their father joined the act as a drummer, the name changed again in 1963, to Hines, Hines, and Dad. Career Hines made his Broadway debut with his brother in The Girl in Pink Tights in 1954. He earned Tony Award nominations for Eubie! (1979), Comin' Uptown (1980), and Sophisticated Ladies (1981), and won the Tony Award and Drama Desk Award for Jelly's Last Jam (1992) and the Theatre World Award for Eubie!. Hines performed as the lead singer and musician in a rock band called Severance based in Venice, California during the years 1975 and 1976. Severance was one of the house bands at an original music club called Honky Hoagies Handy Hangout, otherwise known as the 4H Club, which released their debut album on Largo Records (a subsidiary of GNP Crescendo) in 1976. In 1981, Hines made his movie debut in Mel Brooks's History of the World, Part I, replacing Richard Pryor, who had originally been cast in the role but suffered severe burns in a house fire just days before he was due to begin shooting. Madeline Kahn, also starring in the film, suggested to director Mel Brooks that he look into Hines for the role after they learned of Pryor's hospitalization. Critics took note of Hines's comedic charm, and he later appeared in movies such as Wolfen, The Cotton Club, White Nights, Running Scared with Billy Crystal, Tap, and Waiting to Exhale. On television, he starred in his own series in 1997, called The Gregory Hines Show on CBS, as well as in the recurring role of Ben Doucette on Will & Grace. He would return to voice Big Bill in Nick Jr.'s television show, Little Bill, in the end of 1999. He starred in The Tic Code, in June 1998. In 1986, he sang a duet with Luther Vandross called \\"There's Nothing Better Than Love,\\" which reached the No. 1 position on the Billboard R&B; charts.[ Luther Vandross Chart History] In an interview in 1987, Hines said that he often looked for roles written for white actors, \\"preferring their greater scope and dynamics.\\" His Will & Grace role, for example, never made reference to race. In 1989, he created and hosted a PBS special called \\"Gregory Hines' Tap Dance in America,\\" which featured various tap dancers such as Savion Glover and Bunny Briggs. He also co-hosted the Tony Awards ceremony in 1995 and 2002. In 1990, Hines visited his idol Sammy Davis Jr., who was dying of throat cancer and was unable to speak. After Davis died, an emotional Hines spoke at Davis's funeral of how Sammy had made a gesture to him, \\"as if passing a basketball ‚Ä¶ and I caught it.\\" Hines spoke of the honor that Sammy thought that Hines could carry on from where he left off. Hines was an avid improviser of tap steps, tap sounds, and tap rhythms alike. His improvisation was like that of a drummer, doing a solo and coming up with rhythms. He also improvised the phrasing of a number of tap steps, mainly based on sound produced. A laid-back dancer, he usually wore loose fitting pants and a tighter shirt. Although he inherited the roots and tradition of the black rhythmic tap, he also promoted the new black rhythmic tap. \\"He purposely obliterated the tempos,\\" wrote tap historian Sally Sommer, \\"throwing down a cascade of taps like pebbles tossed across the floor. In that moment, he aligned tap with the latest free form experiments in jazz and new music and postmodern dance.\\" Throughout his career, Hines wanted and continued to be an advocate for tap in America. He successfully petitioned the creation of National Tap Dance Day in May 1989, which is now celebrated in forty cities in the United States, as well as eight other nations. He was on the board of directors of Manhattan Tap, a member of the Jazz Tap Ensemble, and a member of the American Tap Dance Foundation, which was formerly called the American Tap Dance Orchestra. Through his teaching, he influenced tap dancers such as Savion Glover, Dianne Walker, Ted Levy, and Jane Goldberg. In an interview with The New York Times in 1988, Hines said that everything he did was influenced by his dancing: \\"my singing, my acting, my lovemaking, my being a parent.\\" Personal life Hines's marriages to Patricia Panella and Pamela Koslow ended in divorce. He had two children, a son named Zach and a daughter named Daria, as well as a stepdaughter named Jessica Koslow, and a grandson. Death Hines died of liver cancer on August 9, 2003, en route to the hospital from his home in Los Angeles. He had been diagnosed with the disease more than one year earlier, but informed only his closest friends. At the time of his death, production of the television show Little Bill was ending, and he was engaged to female bodybuilder Negrita Jayde, who was based in Toronto. Hines is buried at St. Volodymyr Ukrainian Cemetery in Oakville, Ontario. Jayde died of cancer on August 28, 2009, at the age of 51, just weeks after holding the sixth annual memorial/celebration to Hines.

It is dedicated to educating both Muslims and non-Muslims.Mission Statement at Minaret of Freedom Institute web site. It was co-founded by Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, its president, and Shahid N. Shah, its treasurer.Staff and Board listing at Minaret of Freedom Institute web site. Its early board of advisers included former Richard Nixon advisor Robert D. Crane, a convert to Islam, and Charles Butterworth, a University of Maryland Islamic scholar.Tarek Atia, A Center For Muslim Thought; Think Tank Will Try To Be Cultural Bridge, The Washington Post, August 18, 1994. Its current board of directors and board of advisers include religious, academic and business leaders.  Mission  Its Mission Statement aims for non-Muslims are: * \\"to counter distortions and misconceptions about Islamic beliefs and practice\\" * \\"to demonstrate the Islamic origins of modern values like the rule of law and sciences like market economics * \\"to advance the status of Muslim peoples maligned by a hostile environment in the West and oppressed by repressive political regimes in the East\\" Its Mission Statement aims for Muslims (in concert with Qur'an and the Sunnah obligations) are: * \\"to discover and publish the politico-economic policy implications of Islamic law (shari\`ah) and their consequences on the economic well-being of the community\\" * \\"to expose both American and Islamic- world Muslims to free market thought\\" * \\"to educate Islamic religious and community leaders in economics and in the fact that liberty is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for the achievement of a good society\\" * \\"to promote the establishment of free trade and justice (an essential common interest of Islam and the West)\\" It implements these goals through independent scholarly research into policy issues of concern to Muslims; publication of scholarly and popular expositions of such research; translation of appropriate works on the free market into the languages of the Muslim world; and the operation of a scholars exchange program.  Religious views  =Sharia law= The Institute holds that adherence to Sharia law and even Islamist politics can be compatible with libertarian ideas.Tim Cavanaugh, Revealed Libertarianism: Minaret of Freedom tries to square the Quran with the free market , Reason Magazine interview with Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, July 28, 2003. In a paper delivered at a 2005 Center for the Study of Islam and Democracy conference Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad noted the similarities of American secularism and Islamic law, argued that the free exercise of religion is inherently part of Islamic law and outlined a vision of \\"Islamic pluralism\\" where the traditional dhimmi system of protection of non-Muslims must be explicitly protected constitutionally.Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, Ph.D., Reconciling Secular Government with Islamic Law, Minaret of Freedom Institute, 2005. In 2006 Imad- ad-Dean Ahmad commented on the Saudi Arabian Embassy's Islamic Affairs Department distribution of \\"The Noble Koran\\" which included commentary that disparaged Jews and Christians. Ahmad told The Washington Post \\"The outcry was so great...People were disgusted. And it wasn't just liberals. I couldn't find an American Muslim who had anything good to say about that edition. I would call it a Wahhabi Koran.\\"Caryle Murphy, For Conservative Muslims, Goal of Isolation a Challenge, Washington Post, September 5, 2006, A01. Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad has been quoted as calling the September 11th attacks in the name of Islam as an offense against Islam. He has written that it is the moral duty of Muslims to identify the perpetrators and their supporters and ‚Äúconfront them with the fact that their actions have violated sharia‚Äôah (sic) in a most egregious manner, to urge them to repent and to punish them if the families of the victims are unwilling to be merciful and accept compensation.‚ÄùJoyce M. Davis, Martyrs, Updated Edition: Innocence, Vengeance, and Despair in the Middle East, Palgrave Macmillan, 2004, p. 199, , 9781403966810 =Loan interest= The institute deviates from orthodox Islamic thinking in its belief that the Qur'anic prohibition of riba (usury) does not prohibit all lending at interest, only that which is excessively high.Hans Visser, Herschel Visser, Islamic Finance: Principles and Practice, Edward Elgar Publishing, 2009, p. 32 , , 9781845425258 Riba and Interest: Definitions and Implications, Minaret of Freedom Institute Preprint Series 96-5, delivered at 22nd Conference of American Muslim Social Scientists, October 1993. Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad has stated that the Islamic world pioneered the scientific method, but may have been unable to progress to an industrial revolution because the prohibition of interest prevented would-be inventors from obtaining the necessary financing to develop their inventions. =Circumcision= With regards to female circumcision, Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad writes that clitoridectomy and infibulation should be viewed as practices prohibited by Islam because they jeopardize the girl's future ability to enjoy sexual relations with her husband, and hence should be considered disliked. He dismisses hygienic or religious justifications for \\"this painful and potentially harmful practice.\\" Ahmad supports male circumcision, writing that although it is not prescribed in the Qur'an \\"male circumcision is clearly a Muslim tradition.\\"Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, Ph.D., Female Genital Mutilation: an Islamic Perspective, Minaret of Freedom Institute Pamphlet #1, 2000. Political views =Civil liberties= In 1999 the Institute sponsored a panel on ‚ÄúSecular Threats to Freedom of Expression,‚Äù which was labeled ‚Äúsecular fundamentalism,\\" and identified as being as great a threat to liberty as religious fundamentalism. Two speakers shared their personal stories, Merve Kavak√ßƒ±, an elected Turkish parliamentarian removed from office because she insisted on wearing the hijab (Islamic headcovering) and Sami Al-Arian, a tenured University of South Florida professor who at the time was threatened with dismissal because a former leader of his dialogue group of Muslim and non-Muslim intellectuals later was identified as the head of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Al-Arian described how the 1996 immigration legislation had led to 29 individuals being held in prison for years under ‚Äúsecret evidence‚Äù provisions, noting that 28 were Muslims.Ayesha Ahmad, Muslim Activists Reject Secular Fundamentalism, originally published at IslamOnline, April 22, 1999.

After the September 11th attacks Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad spoke out about suspicion of and accusations against Muslims that worried many American Muslims, making them more cautious.Hate Crimes Surge in 2001, FBI says, The Dispatch, (Lexington, KY), November 26, 2002. After the U.S. government closed down the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development charity and convicted its leaders of financing terrorism, Ahmad stated that the convictions shocked Muslims, confused donors and ‚Äúseems to give a green light for further intimidation of Muslim charities.‚ÄùLaurie Goodstein, Muslims taken aback by charity case, New York Times, November 27, 2008. In 2006 Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad and Minaret Vice President Aly R. Abuzaakouk signed a letter in ‚Äúdefense of free speech‚Äù condemning ‚Äúany intimidation or threats of violence directed against any individual or group exercising the rights of freedom of religion and speech; even when that speech may be perceived as hurtful or reprehensible.‚Äù They expressed concern about threats ‚Äúmade against individual writers, cartoonists, and others by a minority of Muslims‚Äù and called on all Muslims to ‚Äúrefrain from violence.‚ÄùJonathan Kay, Good news: North American Muslims take a stand in favour of free speech , The National Post, September 29, 2010. =Sami Al-Arian= The Minaret of Freedom has supported Sami Al- ArianImad-ad-Dean Ahmad, Bridging the Divide?

In 2006 an Alexandria, Virginia grand jury subpoena was issued to the Minaret of Freedom Institute seeking notes about the symposium on ‚ÄúThe United States and Iran: It‚Äôs Time to Talk‚Äù that he moderated in 1999. Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad told the New York Sun that he believed the agents sought information because Sami Al-Arian had attended the event. He noted that the same prosecutor seeking Al-Arian‚Äôs grand jury testimony at the time had signed the subpoena. Ahmad never was required to testify to the grand jury.Josh Gerstein, Subpoenas Issued in a Terror-Finance Probe Spark a Secret Battle Before a Federal Court, New York Sun, March 22, 2007. =Anti-imperialism= Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad told Reason magazine that Western liberals had abandoned their anti-imperialist views, including by invading Iraq, and thus had alienated Islamists from pro-liberty viewpoints. He stated Western government financial support for various factions in Muslim and Arab countries tends to prop up the most oppressive elements. =Opposition to Zionism= The Institute defines the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict in terms of Israel's violations of individual property rights, starting with the fact that Jews owned only 7 percent of the land in Palestine in 1948 but have gained control of most of it as of today.

Description  RSA SecurID token (older style, model SD600) RSA SecurID token (model SID700) RSA SecurID (new style, SID800 model with smartcard functionality) The RSA SecurID authentication mechanism consists of a \\"token\\" ‚Äî either hardware (e.g. a key fob) or software (a soft token) ‚Äî which is assigned to a computer user and which creates an authentication code at fixed intervals (usually 60 seconds) using a built-in clock and the card's factory-encoded almost random key (known as the \\"seed\\"). The seed is different for each token, and is loaded into the corresponding RSA SecurID server (RSA Authentication Manager, formerly ACE/Server ) as the tokens are purchased.TOTP: Time-based One-time Password Algorithm On-demand tokens are also available, which provide a tokencode via email or SMS delivery, eliminating the need to provision a token to the user. The token hardware is designed to be tamper-resistant to deter reverse engineering. When software implementations of the same algorithm (\\"software tokens\\") appeared on the market, public code had been developed by the security community allowing a user to emulate RSA SecurID in software, but only if they have access to a current RSA SecurID code, and the original 64-bit RSA SecurID seed file introduced to the server.Sample SecurID Token Emulator with Token Secret Import Later, the 128-bit RSA SecurID algorithm was published as part of an open source library.stoken - Software Token for Linux/UNIX In the RSA SecurID authentication scheme, the seed record is the secret key used to generate one- time passwords. Newer versions also feature a USB connector, which allows the token to be used as a smart card-like device for securely storing certificates.RSA SecurID SID800 Hardware Authenticator A user authenticating to a network resource‚Äîsay, a dial-in server or a firewall‚Äîneeds to enter both a personal identification number and the number being displayed at that moment on their RSA SecurID token. Though increasingly rare, some systems using RSA SecurID disregard PIN implementation altogether, and rely on password/RSA SecurID code combinations. The server, which also has a real-time clock and a database of valid cards with the associated seed records, authenticates a user by computing what number the token is supposed to be showing at that moment in time and checking this against what the user entered. On older versions of SecurID, a \\"duress PIN\\" may be used‚Äîan alternate code which creates a security event log showing that a user was forced to enter their PIN, while still providing transparent authentication. Using the duress PIN would allow one successful authentication, after which the token will automatically be disabled. The \\"duress PIN\\" feature has been deprecated and is not available on currently supported versions. While the RSA SecurID system adds a layer of security to a network, difficulty can occur if the authentication server's clock becomes out of sync with the clock built into the authentication tokens. Normal token clock drift is accounted for automatically by the server by adjusting a stored \\"drift\\" value over time. If the out of sync condition is not a result of normal hardware token clock drift, correcting the synchronization of the Authentication Manager server clock with the out of sync token (or tokens) can be accomplished in several different ways. If the server clock had drifted and the administrator made a change to the system clock, the tokens can either be resynchronized one-by-one, or the stored drift values adjusted manually. The drift can be done on individual tokens or in bulk using a command line utility. RSA Security has pushed forth an initiative called \\"Ubiquitous Authentication\\", partnering with device manufacturers such as IronKey, SanDisk, Motorola, Freescale Semiconductor, Redcannon, Broadcom, and BlackBerry to embed the SecurID software into everyday devices such as USB flash drives and cell phones, to reduce cost and the number of objects that the user must carry.RSA Security to enable ubiquitous authentication as RSA SecurID(r) technology reaches everyday devices and software;. - M2 Presswire  HighBeam Research: Online Press Releases  Theoretical vulnerabilities  Token codes are easily stolen, because no mutual-authentication exists (anything that can steal a password can also steal a token code). This is significant, since it is the principal threat most users believe they are solving with this technology. The simplest practical vulnerability with any password container is losing the special key device or the activated smart phone with the integrated key function. Such vulnerability cannot be healed with any single token container device within the preset time span of activation. All further consideration presumes loss prevention, e.g. by additional electronic leash or body sensor and alarm. While RSA SecurID tokens offer a level of protection against password replay attacks, they are not designed to offer protection against man in the middle type attacks when used alone. If the attacker manages to block the authorized user from authenticating to the server until the next token code will be valid, he will be able to log into the server. Risk-based analytics (RBA), a new feature in the latest version (8.0) provides significant protection against this type of attack if the user is enabled and authenticating on an agent enabled for RBA. RSA SecurID does not prevent man in the browser (MitB) based attacks. SecurID authentication server tries to prevent password sniffing and simultaneous login by declining both authentication requests, if two valid credentials are presented within a given time frame. This has been documented in an unverified post by John G. Brainard.http://malpaso.ru/securid/brainard.htm If the attacker removes from the user the ability to authenticate however, the SecurID server will assume that it is the user who is actually authenticating and hence will allow the attacker's authentication through. Under this attack model, the system security can be improved using encryption/authentication mechanisms such as SSL. Although soft tokens may be more convenient, critics indicate that the tamper-resistant property of hard tokens is unmatched in soft token implementations,http://securology.blogspot.com/2007/11/soft-tokens- arent-tokens-at-all.html which could allow seed record secret keys to be duplicated and user impersonation to occur. Hard tokens, on the other hand, can be physically stolen (or acquired via social engineering) from end users. The small form factor makes hard token theft much more viable than laptop/desktop scanning. A user will typically wait more than one day before reporting the device as missing, giving the attacker plenty of time to breach the unprotected system. This could only occur, however, if the users UserID and PIN are also known. Risk-based analytics can provide additional protection against the use of lost or stolen tokens, even if the users UserID and PIN are known by the attackers. Batteries go flat periodically, requiring complicated replacement and re-enrollment procedures.  Reception and competing products  As of 2003, RSA SecurID commanded over 70% of the two-factor authentication market and 25 million devices have been produced to date. A number of competitors, such as VASCO, make similar security tokens, mostly based on the open OATH HOTP standard. A study on OTP published by Gartner in 2010 mentions OATH and SecurID as the only competitors. Other network authentication systems, such as OPIE and S/Key (sometimes more generally known as OTP, as S/Key is a trademark of Telcordia Technologies, formerly Bellcore) attempt to provide the \\"something you have\\" level of authentication without requiring a hardware token.  March 2011 system compromise  On 17 March 2011, RSA announced that they had been victims of \\"an extremely sophisticated cyber attack\\". Originally online at RSA site. Concerns were raised specifically in reference to the SecurID system, saying that \\"this information could potentially be used to reduce the effectiveness of a current two-factor authentication implementation\\". However, their formal Form 8-K submission indicated that they did not believe the breach would have a \\"material impact on its financial results\\". The breach cost EMC, the parent company of RSA, $66.3 million, which was taken as a charge against second quarter earnings. It covered costs to investigate the attack, harden its IT systems and monitor transactions of corporate customers, according to EMC Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer David Goulden, in a conference call with analysts. The breach into RSA's network was carried out by hackers who sent phishing emails to two targeted, small groups of employees of RSA. Attached to the email was an Excel file containing malware. When an RSA employee opened the Excel file, the malware exploited a vulnerability in Adobe Flash. The exploit allowed the hackers to use the Poison Ivy Remote Administration Tool to gain control of machines and access servers in RSA's network. There are some hints that the breach involved the theft of RSA's database mapping token serial numbers to the secret token \\"seeds\\" that were injected to make each one unique. Reports of RSA executives telling customers to \\"ensure that they protect the serial numbers on their tokens\\" lend credibility to this hypothesis. Barring a fatal weakness in the cryptographic implementation of the token code generation algorithm (which is unlikely, since it involves the simple and direct application of the extensively scrutinized AES-128 block cipher ), the only circumstance under which an attacker could mount a successful attack without physical possession of the token is if the token seed records themselves had been leaked. RSA stated it did not release details about the extent of the attack so as to not give potential attackers information they could use in figuring out how to attack the system. On 6 June 2011, RSA offered token replacements or free security monitoring services to any of its more than 30,000 SecurID customers, following an attempted cyber breach on defense customer Lockheed Martin that appeared to be related to the SecurID information stolen from RSA. In spite of the resulting attack on one of its defense customers, company chairman Art Coviello said that \\"We believe and still believe that the customers are protected\\". = Resulting attacks = In April 2011, unconfirmed rumors cited L-3 Communications as having been attacked as a result of the RSA compromise. In May 2011, this information was used to attack Lockheed Martin systems. However Lockheed Martin claims that due to \\"aggressive actions\\" by the company's information security team, \\"No customer, program or employee personal data\\" was compromised by this \\"significant and tenacious attack\\". The Department of Homeland Security and the US Defense Department offered help to determine the scope of the attack.

Password authentication Dell EMC Authentication methods ","title":"RSA SecurID"},{"id":"293369","text":"A stock split or stock divide increases the number of shares in a company. A stock split causes a decrease of market price of individual shares, not causing a change of total market capitalization of the company. Stock dilution does not occur. A company may split its stock when the market price per share is so high that it becomes unwieldy when traded. One of the reasons is that a very high share price may deter small investors from buying the shares. Stock splits are usually initiated after a large run up in share price. Effects The main effect of stock splits is an increase in the liquidity of a stock: there are more buyers and sellers for 10 shares at $10 than 1 share at $100. Some companies avoid a stock split to obtain the opposite strategy: by refusing to split the stock and keeping the price high, they reduce trading volume. Berkshire Hathaway is a notable example of this. The company has never had a stock split and each share trades at over US$300,000. Other effects could be psychological. If many investors believe that a stock split will result in an increased share price and purchase the stock the share price will tend to increase. Others contend that the management of a company, by initiating a stock split, is implicitly signaling its confidence in the future prospects of the company. In a market where there is a high minimum number of shares, or a penalty for trading in so-called odd lots (a non multiple of some arbitrary number of shares), a reduced share price may attract more attention from small investors. Small investors such as these, however, will have negligible impact on the overall price. Split ratios Ratios of 2-for-1, 3-for-1, and 3-for-2 splits are the most common, but any ratio is possible. Splits of 4-for-3, 5-for-2, and 5-for-4 are used, though less frequently. Investors will sometimes receive cash payments in lieu of fractional shares. In the above examples ‚Äòy-for-x‚Äô Shows the number of shares before (x) and after (y). Other common reporting nomenclatures are ‚Äòx-y‚Äô and ‚Äòstock dividend‚Äô of [=]y-x. In the above ‚Äò3-for-1‚Äô example (or 1-3 and 2 share stock dividend) would mean a stockholder holding 100 shares (on record date) will receive 200 new shares after the split for those 100 shares. Example A company which has 100 issued shares priced at $50 per share, has a market capitalization of $5000 = 100 √ó $50. If the company splits its stock 2-for-1, there are now 200 shares of stock and each shareholder holds twice as many shares. The price of each share is adjusted to $25 = $5000 / 200. The market capitalization is 200 √ó $25 = $5000, the same as before the split. Currency The analog in currency would be redenomination. This would be where a currency increases in value so that people have to use small fractions. Then a new unit (such as dollar) can be introduced, such that an old unit is equal to 10 (or some number) new units. An example is with the Australian currency. The Australian pound was split into two Australian dollars. Effect on historical charts When a stock splits, many charts show it similarly to a dividend payout and therefore do not show a dramatic dip in price. Taking the same example as above, a company with 100 shares of stock priced at $50 per share. The company splits its stock 2-for-1. There are now 200 shares of stock and each shareholder holds twice as many shares. The price of each share is adjusted to $25. As a result, when looking at a historical chart, one might expect to see the stock dropping from $50 to $25.

He was known as a defender of Platonism and an opponent of Aristotelianism. In Croatia he is mostly referred to as Franjo Petri≈° or Frane Petriƒá (sometimes Petris, Petri≈°eviƒá and Petriƒçeviƒá). His family name in Cres was known as Petris. Patricius studied at the University of Padua Aristotelian Philosophy, but turned to Platonism while still a student. He became a sharp, high-profile opponent of Aristotelianism, with whom he grappled extensively in extensive writings. After many years of unsuccessful efforts to secure material livelihood, he finally received an invitation in 1577 to the Ducal Court of Este in Ferrara. At the university there a chair for Platonic philosophy was set up especially for him. In the years that followed, he gained a reputation as a professor, but was also involved in scientific and literary controversy; he tended to polemic and was in turn violently attacked by opponents. In 1592 he accepted an invitation to Rome, where thanks to papal favor a new chair was created for him. A serious conflict darkened the last years of his life with the ecclesiastical Censorship, which banned his main work, the Nova de universis philosophia. As one of the last Renaissance humanists, Patricius was characterized by extensive education, varied scientific activity, a strong will to innovate and exceptional literary fertility. He critically examined established, universally recognized teachings and suggested alternatives. In particular, he wanted to replace the prevailing Aristotelian natural philosophy with his own model. He opposed the traditional view of the meaning of historical studies, which was usually restricted to moral instruction, with his concept of a broad, neutral, scientific historical research. In Poetry he emphasized the importance of Inspiration and fought against conventional rules, which he considered to be arbitrary, unrealistic restrictions on creative freedom. In the Early Modern Period, Patricius's strongly controversial philosophy of nature found considerable echo despite the church's condemnation, but remained an outsider position. Modern research recognizes his contributions to the constitution of modern concept of space and to historical theory. Book cover of the Patricius/Petri≈° biography written by Academician ≈Ωarko Dadiƒá, member of the Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts, published in Zagreb in 2000.  Origin and name  Francesco Patricius came from the town Cres on the homonymous island in front of Istria (Italian Cherso ).Emil Jacobs: Francesco Patricio and his collection of Greek manuscripts in the library of the Escorial. In: Zentralblatt f√ºr Bibliothekswesen 25, 1908, p. 19‚Äì47, here: p. 20 Note 2 assumed to be the place of birth Osor on Cres, but this hypothesis has not been taken up in more recent literature. At that time the island belonged to Republic of Venice, but a large part of their population was Croatian. Francesco was an illegitimate son of the priest Stefano di Niccol√≤ di Antonio Patricius (Stjepan Nikola Antun Petri≈° or Petriƒá), who belonged to the lower nobility. His mother was Stefano's partner Maria Radocca. In older literature, Francesco's father was mistakenly identified with the judge of the same name, Stefano di Niccol√≤ di Matteo Patricius, and his mother Maria was identified with Maria Lupetino, the judge's alleged wife. Also incorrect is the claim related to the erroneous genealogy of a relationship of the philosopher with the famous theologian Matthias Flacius.Cesare Vasoli: Immagini umanistiche , Naples 1983, pp. 531‚Äì541, 547 f. , 553. According to Francesco, his family was originally based in Bosnia and, according to their coat of arms, was of royal descent. As a result of the Turkish conquest of her homeland, she emigrated, and so an ancestor named Stefanello came to Cres. This happened, if the communication is correct, in the second half of the 15th century.Cesare Vasoli: Immagini umanistiche , Naples 1983, pp. 528-530. Following a humanistic custom, the philosopher Latinized his name and called himself Patricius or Patritius . Since he lived in Italy and published his works there, the name form Francesco Patricius has established itself internationally, but in Croatia variants of the Croatian form are preferred. The addition \\"da Cherso\\" (from Cres) serves to distinguish it from the Siena humanist Francesco Patricius (Franciscus Patricius Senensis), who lived in the 15th century.For the name see Zvonko Pand≈æiƒá (ed.) : Franciscus Patricius: Discussiones Peripateticae , Cologne 1999, S. XI; Emil Jacobs: Francesco Patricio and his collection of Greek manuscripts in the library of the Escorial. In: Zentralblatt f√ºr Bibliothekswesen 25, 1908, pp. 19‚Äì47, here: pp. 20 f. Note 2.  Life  = Youth and study time = Francesco Patricius was born on 25 April 1529 in Cres. He initially spent his childhood in his hometown. His uncle Giovanni Giorgio Patricius (Ivan Juraj Petri≈°), who commanded a Venetian warship, took the only nine-year-old boy on a war campaign against the Turks in February 1538. So it turned out that Francesco participated in the Battle of Preveza, in which the Christian fleet was struck. He almost fell into Turkish captivity. He spent several years at sea. In September 1543 he went to Venice to acquire a professional qualification. Initially he went to a commercial school according to Giovanni Giorgio's will, but his inclination was for humanism. Since his father showed understanding for this, the youngster received Latin lessons.Cesare Vasoli: \\"La lettera autobiografica di Francesco Patricius.\\" In: \\"Quaderni di Retorica e Poetica\\" 1986/1, pp. 59‚Äì66, here: 61; Cesare Vasoli: Immagini umanistiche , Naples 1983, pp. 555 f. Later the father sent him to study at Ingolstadt, where the seat of the Bavarian University was. There he acquired knowledge of Greek. In 1546, however, he had to leave Bavaria because of the turmoil of the Schmalkaldic War.See Cesare Vasoli: Immagini umanistiche , Naples 1983, pp. 529, 539, 552 f. In May 1547 Patricius went to Padua, whose university was one of the most respected universities in Europe. Initially, at the request of his practical-thinking father Stefano, he studied medicine with Giambattista Montano, Bassiano Lando and Alberto Gabriele, but only very reluctantly. When Stefano died in 1551, he was able to drop out of medical training. He sold the medical books. He continued to be interested in humanistic education. During his studies, he attended philosophical lectures by professors Bernardino Tomitano, Marcantonio de 'Passeri (Marcantonio Genova), Lazzaro Buonamici and Francesco Robortello. Among his friends and fellow students was Niccol√≤ Sfondrati, who later became pope as Gregory XIV. Philosophy classes were a disappointment for Patricius, because Padua was a stronghold of Aristotelian, whose representatives continued the tradition of medieval Scholastic. This was a direction that Patricius firmly rejected and fought violently later. Under the influence of a Franciscan scholar, he turned to Platonism. The Franciscan recommended the Neoplatonic teaching of the humanist Marsilio Ficino (1433‚Äì1499). The reading of Ficino's writings, especially his major philosophical-theological work, the Theologia Platonica , was pioneering for Patricius.For the influence of Ficinos see Maria Muccillo: Marsilio Ficino e Francesco Patricius da Cherso. In: Gian Carlo Garfagnini (ed.): Marsilio Ficino e il ritorno di Platone. Studi e documenti , Vol. 2, Florenz 1986, pp. 615-678. He later expressed his distance to Padua's scholastic-Aristotelian teaching practice by writing in an autobiographical letter in 1587 as self-taught represented. In his student days he already wrote and published philosophical and philological writings; he had a collection of his youth works printed in Venice in 1553.Cesare Vasoli: \\"La lettera autobiografica di Francesco Patricius.\\" In: \\"Quaderni di Retorica e Poetica\\" 1986/1, pp. 59‚Äì66 , here: 62 f .; Francesco Bottin: Francesco Patricius e l'aristotelismo padovano.

There he experienced an unpleasant time, which was characterized by illness, isolation and the family conflict. At that time he apparently belonged to the spiritual class - at least until 1560.Cesare Vasoli: Immagini umanistiche , Naples 1983, pp. 549‚Äì554. He tried unsuccessfully to secure his livelihood in the long term To get home to an ecclesiastical. After this failure, he went to Rome in 1556, but his efforts for a benefice also failed there. Then he moved to Venice. The young scholar unsuccessfully sought employment at the glamorous courtyard of the house Este in Ferrara. After all, he gained a foothold in the Venetian humanist circles: he joined the Accademia della Fama, a scholarly community in which he found like-minded people.Cesare Vasoli: \\"\\" Francesco Patricius da Cherso \\"\\", Rome 1989, pp. 26-28. = Activities in Cyprus (1560-1568) = The philosopher entered the service of the nobleman Giorgio Contarini in 1560, who belonged to one of the most distinguished genders of Venice. First, he had to teach Aristotelian ethics to his employer. Patricius soon won Contarini's trust and was given an important assignment: he was sent to Cyprus to inspect and then report on the family property, which was administered by a brother of Contarini. When he described the situation on his return in the summer of 1562, Contarini sent him again to Cyprus and gave him authorization to carry out measures for improvement. As the new administrator, Patricius ensured by Melioration a significant increase in the value of the land, which could now be used for growing cotton. However, the measures required were costly and poor harvests also reduced income, so that the client could not be satisfied. Contarini's Cypriot relatives, who Patricius discredited with his report, took this opportunity to take revenge and to blame the administrator on the head of the family. When Patricius's justification was not accepted, he asked to be released in 1567.Maria Muccillo: La biblioteca greca di Francesco Patricius. In: Eugenio Canone (ed.): Bibliothecae selectae.

Subsequently, Patricius initially stayed in Cyprus. He now entered the service of the Catholic Archbishop of Nicosia, the Venetian Filippo Mocenigo, who entrusted him with the administration of the villages belonging to the Archdiocese. But already in 1568 he left the island threatened by the Turks together with the archbishop and went to Venice. In retrospect, he saw the years in Cyprus as lost time. After all, he used the stay in the Greek- speaking world for an important humanistic concern: he searched for Greek manuscripts with considerable success, which he then bought or had written down, or perhaps even copied himself.Emil Jacobs: Francesco Patricio and his collection of Greek Manuscripts in the library of the Escorial. In: Zentralblatt f√ºr Bibliothekswesen 25, 1908, pp. 19‚Äì47, here: 23 f. = Varying endeavors for a material livelihood (1568‚Äì1577) = Upon his return, Patricius returned to science. He now went to Padua again, where he apparently no longer worked at the university but only gave private lessons. Among his disciples was Zaccaria Mocenigo, a nephew of the archbishop. It was very important to him to exchange ideas with the well-known philosopher Bernardino Telesio, with whom he later remained in correspondence.Maria Muccillo: Platonismo, ermetismo e \\"prisca theologia\\" , Florence 1996, p 74 Note 3; Franz Lamprecht: The theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, p. 12. During this time, Patricius's relationship with the archbishop deteriorated. He made contact with Diego Hurtado de Mendoza y de la Cerda, the viceroy of Catalonia, who was an enthusiastic book collector. The beginning of this connection was promising: the viceroy invited him to Barcelona and offered him the prospect of employment as a court philosopher with an annual salary of five hundred ducat. As a result, Patricius made his first trip to Spain. In Barcelona, however, he was very disappointed because the financial promise was not kept. For these circumstances, the philosopher was forced to return in 1569.Maria Muccillo: La biblioteca greca di Francesco Patricius. In: Eugenio Canone (ed.): Bibliothecae selectae.

One of the benefits of the trip, however, was the prospect of making a living in the long-distance book trade. The export of books from Italy to Barcelona seemed lucrative; Patricius had been able to reach an agreement with business partners there before he left. Shipping started and actually proved worthwhile at first, but the company eventually failed because of the philosopher's inexperience and lack of business talent. A serious blow hit Patricius in 1570 when the Turks in Cyprus captured a shipment of goods belonging to him and intended for export to Venice, for which he had spent 3,500 ducats. As a result, he got into such trouble that he turned to his former employer, Contarini, who he still owed him 200 ducats. When the latter refused to pay, a lengthy process appeared which Patricius apparently lost.Corrado Marciani: Un filosofo del Rinascimento editore- libraio: Francesco Patriciuso e l'incisore Giovanni Franco di Cherso.

In: Zentralblatt f√ºr Bibliothekswesen 25, 1908, pp. 19‚Äì47, here: 24 f. In order to restructure his financial situation, Patricius turned to book production. In August 1571 he entered into a contract with the heir to the manuscript of a script by the late scholar Girolamo Ruscelli about Emblems, Le imprese illustri . He took over the editing, and the work was published the following year by a Venetian printer. However, Patricius was unable to meet his contractual obligations due to his precarious financial situation. This resulted in a conflict, which was difficult to resolve.Corrado Marciani: Ancora su Francesco Patriciuso e Giovanni Franco. In: La Bibliofilia 72/73, 1970/1971, p. 303 ‚Äì313, here: 303‚Äì305. After this unpleasant experience, Patricius founded his own publishing house, all'Elefanta . There he published three books in 1573, but then the publisher went in. The philosopher then went on a new trip to Spain in 1574 to sue his former business partners and sell Greek manuscripts. In February 1575 he was received by Antonio Graci√°n, the secretary king Philip II, Who gave him for the royal library in the El Escorial 75 Codices. From a humanistic point of view, however, this commercial success was questionable, because the escorial was considered a \\"book grave\\" by the scholars.Paola Maria Arcari: Il pensiero politico di Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1935, p. 49. When the legal proceedings for the failed book trade dragged on without any foreseeable result, Patricius returned home after thirteen months.See Corrado Marciani for these events: Un filosofo del Rinascimento editore-libraio: Francesco Patriciuso e l ' incisore Giovanni Franco di Cherso.

Da Cusano a Leopardi , Florence 1993, pp. 73‚Äì118, here: 77‚Äì81. Upon his return, Patricius settled in Modena in 1577, where he entered the service of the respected musician and poet Tarquinia Molza, to whom he gave Greek lessons.Maria Giovanna Cavallari: L'insegIERTo del Patricius in alcuni madrigali di Tarquinia Molza. In: Patriciusa Castelli (ed.): Francesco Patricius, filosofo platonico nel crepuscolo del Rinascimento , Florenz 2002, pp. 129‚Äì138, here: 135. = Professorship in Ferrara (1578-1592) = In Modena, Patricius received the invitation to the ducal court of Ferrara that had been sought two decades ago. At the turn of the year 1577/1578 he arrived in Ferrara. He was warmly received by Herzog Alfonso II. D'Este, an important cultural patron. His advocate there was the Ducal Council - from 1579 secretary - Antonio Montecatini, who valued him very much, although he was a representative of the Aristotelianism that Patricius had fought against from a Platonic perspective. At Montecatini's suggestion, a chair for Platonic philosophy was set up for Patricius at the University of Ferrara. The starting salary of 390 lire was later increased to 500. The time of material worries was over.Cesare Vasoli: \\"\\" Francesco Patricius da Cherso \\"\\", Rome 1989, pp. 206-212; Margherita Palumbo: Patricius, Francesco. In: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani , Vol. 81, Rome 2014, pp. 732‚Äì738, here: 734. With the move to Ferrara, the new professor began an enjoyable and profitable phase of life. He was highly regarded both at the glamorous court of Alfonso and in the academic environment. He was friends with the Duke. Patricius also had a good personal relationship with the famous poet Torquato Tasso, who lived in Ferrara, even though he had a controversy with him in a controversial event. In the fourteen years of his work in Ferrara, he published numerous writings.For the double position of Partizi as a university lecturer and as courtier, see Lina Bolzoni: L'universo dei poemi possibili , Rome 1980, pp. 173‚Äì178. However, Patricius's dedicated opinions on philosophical and literary issues also caused controversy and led to disputes. Because of Aristotle's criticism, a written polemic with the Aristotelian Teodoro Angelucci eased. In the literary field, Patricius was involved in a dispute over the criteria of poetic quality, in which Camillo Pellegrino and Torquato Tasso took the opposite view.Margherita Palumbo: Patricius, Francesco. In: Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani , Vol. 81, Rome 2014, pp. 732-738, here: 735. = Professorship in Rome, conflict with censorship and death (1592‚Äì1597) = Patriciuss patron Clement VIII. Patricius's academic career finally peaked thanks to the benevolence of Cardinal Ippolito Aldobrandini, who invited him to Rome in October 1591. In January 1592 Aldobrandini was elected Pope and took the name Clement VIII. He gave an enthusiastic welcome to the scholar who arrived in Rome on 18 April 1592. At the Sapienza University of Rome a chair for Platonic philosophy was created for Patricius. The professor had his residence in the house of Cinzio Passeri Aldobrandini, who was a nephew of the Pope and a well- known patron and was raised to Cardinal in 1593. On 15 May, he gave his inaugural lecture on Plato's \\"Timaios\\" \\"to a large audience. The allowance granted to him - 500 ducats basic salary, with allowances a good 840 ducats\\"Silvano Cavazza (ed.): Una lettera inedita di Francesco Patricius da Cherso.

Among his listeners and interlocutors was Torquato Tasso, now living in Rome, who did not regret the conflict in Ferrara.Tullio Gregory: L' Apologia \\"e le\\" Declarationes \\"di F. Patricius .

In: Roma e lo Studium Urbis , Rome 1992, pp. 200‚Äì247, here: 201‚Äì213, 218 f. Despite his excellent relationship with the Pope, Patricius soon became a target of church censorship. The occasion was his major philosophical work Nova de universis philosophia , which he published in Ferrara in 1591. There the censor Pedro Juan Saragoza discovered a number of statements which he considered heretical or at least suspicious and which he denounced in an expert report. Among other things, he declared the statement that the earth was rotating to be erroneous because this was incompatible with the Scriptures. According to the consensus of the theologians, it can be gathered from the Bible that the fixed star sky revolves around the immovable earth.Ugo Baldini, Leen Spruit (ed.): Catholic Church and Modern Science , Vol. 1/3, Rome 2009, pp. 2197, 2199 f .; Saverio Ricci: Inquisitori, censori, filosofi sullo scenario della Controriforma , Rome 2008, pp. 306-316. In October 1592 the index congregation, the fauthority responsible for the Index of Forbidden Books. In November 1592, she summoned the author of the suspect document and allowed him to read Saragoza's report, which was unusual for the accused at the time. Patricius responded to the censor's attack with a letter of defense, the Apologia ad censuram , in which he basically declared his submission, but defended his position aggressively and assumed Saragoza incompetence. He found no understanding. He later tried unsuccessfully to satisfy the panel with written explanations of his teaching and concessions. Even after the Congregation decided in December 1592 to list the Nova de universis philosophia in the new version of the index, the author continued his rescue efforts, while the publication of the new index of 1593 was delayed. The main disadvantage was that the censor responsible last, the Jesuit Francisco de Toledo, was a well-known representative of the patriotic scholastic Aristotelianism. In July 1594 the congregation banned the distribution and reading of the work and ordered the destruction of all traceable copies. Scripture was listed in the updated edition of the index, which appeared in 1596, and in subsequent editions. However, the author was expressly encouraged to submit an amended version for approval. The aged and conflict-ridden philosopher tackled the revision, but was unable to finish it because he died on 7 February 1597For dates, see Maria Muccillo: Il platonismo all'Universit√† di Roma: Francesco Patricius. In: Roma e lo Studium Urbis , Rome 1992, pp. 200‚Äì247, here: p. 234 and note 88. with a fever. He was buried in the Roman church Sant'Onofrio al Gianicolo next to Torquato Tasso.Ugo Baldini, Leen Spruit (ed.): Catholic Church and Modern Science , Vol. 1/3, Rome 2009, pp. 2197-2201; Michael Stausberg: Fascination Zarathustra , Berlin 1998, Part 1, pp. 374‚Äì381; Saverio Ricci: Inquisitori, censori, filosofi sullo scenario della Controriforma , Rome 2008, pp. 316‚Äì338, 344‚Äì350.  Works  Most of Patricius's writings are in Italian, the rest in Latin. The Latin part of the oeuvre primarily includes two monumental works: the Discussiones peripateticae , an extensive pamphlet against Aristotelianism, and the Nova de universis philosophia , the unfinished overall presentation of his teaching. = Antiaristotelian writings =  Discussiones peripateticae  The struggle against Aristotelianism was a central concern of Patricius, which is evident everywhere in his texts. He not only wanted to refute individual teachings of the ancient thinker, but to bring the entire system to collapse. For this purpose, he wrote a polemical script which he called Discussiones peripateticae (Peripatetic Examinations) , referring to the Peripatos, Aristotle's School of Philosophy. The first impulse came from a request from his student Zaccaria Mocenigo, who asked him to write a story about Aristotle. Patricius fulfilled this request with the original version of the Discussiones , a critical examination of the life and works of the Greek philosopher, which he published in Venice in 1571. Later, after a long interruption, he took up the systematic analysis of Aristotelianism again and expanded his original text to a comprehensive criticism of the peripatetic interpretation of the world. In this expansion of the project, the Discussiones printed in 1571 were the first volume to be incorporated into a four-volume work, which Patricius had printed in folio in Basel in Pietro Perna in 1581. In doing so, he submitted a polemical script, which was also designed as a manual for Aristotelianism.Maria Muccillo: La vita e le opere di Aristotele nelle \\"Discussiones peripateticae\\" di Francesco Patricius da Cherso. In: Rinascimento 21, 1981, pp. 53‚Äì119, here: p. 53 and note 2, pp. 57‚Äì61. The first volume consists of thirteen books. The first book offers a detailed biography of Aristotle, the second a list of works. The following seven books contain philological studies. It is about clarifying the questions as to which of the traditionally attributed writings to Aristotle actually come from him, which work titles are authentic and how the writings are to be arranged systematically. Patricius defines a number of stylistic, substantive and historical criteria for the distinction between genuine and fake writings.Zvonko Pand≈æiƒá (ed.): Franciscus Patricius: Discussiones Peripateticae , Cologne 1999, pp. XXV f .; Maria Muccillo: Platonismo, ermetismo e \\"prisca theologia\\" , Florence 1996, pp. 154‚Äì176. Particular attention is paid to the fragments from lost works by the Greek thinker, which are preserved in later ancient literature. They are compiled in large numbers. The tenth book deals with the history of reception. The last three books are devoted to the various methods that can be used for interpreting teaching and for Aristotelian philosophizing.Attilio Luigi Crespi: La vita e le opere di Francesco Patricio , Milan 1931, p. 36‚Äì39, Friedrich Walkhoff: Francesco Patriciuss Leben und Werk , Bonn 1920, pp. 25 f. In the second volume, Patricius compares peripatetic philosophy with older teachings, especially Platonism. His intention is to discredit Aristotle as plagiarism or and compiler. However, he expresses himself cautiously, because this volume is dedicated to his friend and colleague Antonio Montecatino, the holder of the chair for Aristotelian philosophy in Ferrara. A contrast to this is the open, violent polemic in the last two volumes, in which the author gives up his reluctance. The third volume presents the peripatetic teachings as incompatible with those of the pre-Socratics and Plato. Patricius discusses the disagreements between the authorities on the basis of a plethora of contradicting statements, always declaring Aristotle's view to be wrong . From his point of view, Aristotelianism is a decline in intellectual history, a falsification and destruction of the knowledge of earlier thinkers. The fourth book serves to prove errors in Aristotelian natural philosophy.For Patricius's approach, see Kurt Flasch: Kampfplatz der Philosophie , Frankfurt 2008, pp. 280‚Äì288. See Cesare Vasoli: Aristotele ei filosofi \\"antiquiores\\" nelle \\"Discussiones peripateticae\\" di Francesco Patricius. In: Atti e Memorie della Accademia Petrarca di Lettere, Arti e Scienze 44, 1981, pp. 205‚Äì 233, here: 212-233. When dealing with peripatetic thinking, Patricius attaches great importance to taking Aristotle's doctrine directly from his own words and not - as has been customary since the Middle Ages - to be influenced by the interpretations of the numerous commentators.Thomas S√∂ren Hoffmann: Philosophy in Italy, Wiesbaden 2007, p. 297. In addition, he demands that Aristotle's view not be backed up by a single statement, as was previously the case, but rather that all relevant statements by the philosopher be used.Zvonko Pand≈æiƒá (ed.): Franciscus Patricius: Discussiones Peripateticae , Cologne 1999, pp. XXIV f. In the Discussiones peripateticae Patricius does not consistently go from a Platonic alternative system to Aristotelianism but also takes advantage of arguments based on nonplatonic, rather nominalistic and empirical ideas.Kurt Flasch: Battlefields of Philosophy , Frankfurt 2008, pp. 286‚Äì288. In terms of philosophy, he sees a fateful development: the first pupils of Aristotle still thought independently and also contradicted their teacher; later, however, Alexander of Aphrodisias surrendered unconditionally to the school founder and thus renounced free thinking. The first medieval Arabic- language interpreters, Avicenna, Avempace and Alfarabi, were still relatively unbiased, but then Averroes had the absolute authority of Aristotle proclaimed and thus pointed the way to sterile, scholastic Aristotelism.Giuseppe Saitta: Il pensiero italiano nell' Umanesimo e nel Rinascimento, Vol. 2, 2nd edition, Florenz 1961, pp. 536‚Äì538; Maria Muccillo: Platonismo, ermetismo e \\"prisca theologia\\" , Florence 1996, pp. 181-189; Cesare Vasoli: Aristotele ei filosofi \\"antiquiores\\" nelle \\"Discussiones peripateticae\\" di Francesco Patricius.

Controversy with Teodoro Angelucci  The devastating verdict on Aristotelian philosophy in the Discussiones peripateticae led to controversy with the Aristotelian Teodoro Angelucci. The latter responded to the Discussiones with a counter-writing in which he sharply criticized Patricius's statements on metaphysics and natural science. The attacked man replied to this with the Apologia contra calumnias Theodori Angelutii (Defense against Teodoro Angelucci's defamation) , which he had printed in 1584. The following year, Angelucci continued the argument with another combat script, the Exercitationes (Exercises) .See MariaMuccillo: Un dibattito sui libri metafisici di Aristotele fra platonici, aristotelici e telesiani (con qualche complicazione ermetica).

First, he provided relevant material. He translated the commentary of the pseudo - John Philoponus on the Metaphysics of Aristotle as well as the Elementatio physica and the Elementatio theologica of late antiquity n Neoplatonists Proclus into Latin. Both translations were printed in 1583.Editions: Procli Lycii Diadochi (...) elementa theologica et physica (...), quae Franciscus Patricius de Graecis fecit Latina, Ferrara 1583; Zvonko Pand≈æiƒá (ed.): The Œ£Œ§ŒüŒôŒßŒïŒôŒ©Œ£ŒôŒ£ Œ¶Œ•Œ£ŒôŒöŒó of Proclus in the Latin translation by Franciscus Patricius (F.

Then Patricius worked out his theory of space. In thecompleted in 1586, see Vincenzo De Risi for dates: Francesco Patricius e la nuova geometria dello spazio. In: Delfina Giovannozzi, Marco Veneziani (ed.): Locus-Spatium , Florence 2014, Pp. 269‚Äì327, here: 276. Treatise Della nuova geometria , which he dedicated to Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy, he laid a new foundation for the geometry that he preferred Euclidean definitions. In 1587 a Latin representation of his understanding of space appeared as the first part of a Philosophia de rerum natura (Philosophy on the nature of things) . This publication consists of the two books De spacio physico (About the physical space) and De spacio mathematico (About the mathematical space) . There he presented his alternative to Aristotelian cosmology and physics.See H√©l√®ne V√©drine (ed.): Patricius: De spacio physico et mathematico , Paris 1996, p. 23, 28-37. Patricius's work Zoroaster et eius CCCXX oracula Chaldaica (Zarathustra and its 320 Chaldean oracles) , the first independent modern collection of fragments of the Chaldean Oracles, was also created as part of this preliminary work. He believed that it was authentic teachings Zarathustras and the oracles were the oldest evidence of the history of philosophical thought. It was therefore important to him to secure the text inventory. The positions were taken from works by the late antique authors Proklos, Damaskios, Simplicius of Cilicia, Olympiodorus and Synesius. His collection, which comprises 318 oracle verses, was a strong extension of the previously authoritative compilation of Georgios Gemistos Plethon, which contains only sixty Hexameter.Michael Stausberg: Faszination Zarathustra , Berlin 1998 , Part 1, pp. 321-323; see. Pp. 328-330, 336-338; Udo Reinhold Jeck: Platonica orientalia , Frankfurt 2004, pp. 307‚Äì310.  Nova de universis philosophia  According to his plan, Patricius's main work, the Nova de universis philosophia (New Philosophy of Things in its entirety) should consist of eight parts and explain its entire world interpretation. However, he was only able to complete the first four parts and publish them in Ferrara in 1591. He worked on another part, De humana philosophia , in 1591/1592, but the manuscript remained incomplete and the conflict with the censorship authority prevented its completion and publication. The author dedicated the first edition of 1591 to Pope Gregory XIV, With whom he had a friendship from his childhood in Padua.Maria Muccillo: Il \\"De humana philosophia\\" by Francesco Patricius da Cherso nel codice Barberiniano greco 180.

Materiali per un'edizione emendata , Florence 1993, pp. X ‚Äì XII. In the preface recommended to the Pope that the Pope profoundly changed the Catholic school system: in the teaching of ecclesiastical educational institutions - religious schools and universities under papal control - he proposed to replace Aristotelianism, which had dominated the Middle Ages, with an alternative world view that was superior to the prevailing school philosophy . Five models would be considered. The first is his own system according to the Nova de universis philosophia , the second the Zoroastrianism, the third the Hermetics, the teaching of the Hermes Trismegistos,See also Patricius's hermetic reception Udo Reinhold Jeck: Platonica orientalia , Frankfurt 2004, pp. 334‚Äì343. the fourth is an allegedly ancient Egyptian philosophy - meaning the teaching of the Theologia Aristotelis wrongly attributed to Aristotle -, the fifth is Platonism. He had reconstructed, ordered and explained the four older philosophies. All five models are conducive to religion and acceptable from a Catholic perspective, in contrast to Aristotelianism, which is godless and incompatible with faith. The ancient Church Fathers had already recognized the conformity of Platonism with Christianity. Nevertheless, Aristotelian philosophy had prevailed. Their continued dominance goes back to the medieval scholastics. Plato's works were unknown to them, so they turned to the unsuitable writings of Aristotle.See Patriciuss Kurt Flasch's explanations on these statements: Kampfplatz der Philosophie , Frankfurt 2008, pp. 288‚Äì291; Michael Stausberg: Fascination Zarathustra , Berlin 1998, Part 1, pp. 339‚Äì345. In the preface, Patricius provocatively criticized the approach of the Counter-Reformation church, which tried to secure its belief in its teaching by means of censorship, the Inquisition and state violence. He strongly recommended that you rely on reason and the persuasiveness of philosophical arguments rather than relying on compulsion.Michael Stausberg: Faszination Zarathustra , Berlin 1998, Part 1, pp. 343 f., 366 f .; Kurt Flasch: Battlefields of Philosophy , Frankfurt 2008, pp. 289-291. The first part of the script, entitled Panaugia ( All-Brightness or All-Shine ), deals with the principle of light, which is represented as the shaping and invigorating force in the universe, and with physical light and its properties. Among other things, the reflection and refraction of light and the nature of the colors are discussed. The second part is called Panarchia ( Omnipotence or All- causality ). This is a word creation by the Greek noun arch·∏ó (\\"origin\\", \\"cause\\", \\"rule\\"), which refers to the hierarchical world order and its divine source. The Panarchia describes the Emanationism - the gradual outflow of the Entities s from their divine source - and the hierarchy based on them in the universe. The third part is titled Pampsychia (All-souls) . There the philosopher presents his concept of the soul of the entire physical cosmos through the world soul and particularly discusses the souls of animals. In the fourth part, the Pancosmia (Allorder) , topics of physical cosmology are discussed, in particular the question of the spatial expansion of the universe, which Patricius considers infinite.Paul Oskar Kristeller offers a summary of the content : Eight philosophers of the Italian Renaissance , Weinheim 1986, pp. 102-107. In addition to the source texts, attached are two digression s by the author on special topics: an attempt to determine the order of Plato's dialogues and a compilation of contradictions between Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy. The source texts are Patricius's collection of fragments of the Chaldean oracles, hermetic literature and the Theologia Aristotelis , described as the \\"mystical philosophy of the Egyptians\\", a pseudo-Aristotelian script, the content of which is Patricius with only orally presented \\"unwritten teaching\\" equated to Plato. He said it was a record of Aristotle's wisdom teachings of ancient Egyptian origin, which Plato conveyed to his students in class.Thomas Leinkauf: Plato in the Renaissance: Marsilio Ficino and Francesco Patricius. In: Ada Neschke- Hentschke (ed.): Argumenta in dialogos Platonis , Part 1, Basel 2010, pp. 285‚Äì300, here: 289‚Äì298. Despite his great respect for the creators of the ancient wisdom teachings, Patricius did not hesitateht to take a different view in individual cases. He stressed the need for valid evidence and refused to accept quotes from venerable authorities to replace missing arguments. He saw it as his task to provide arguments for what was not sufficiently founded in the traditional texts of the wise men of antiquity.Karl Schuhmann: Francesco Patricius and Hermetic Philosophy .

The treatise is intended to show the conditions for a successful life in an ideal state community. The starting point is the relevant considerations in the Politics of Aristotle, the views of which the young humanist largely follows here.See Patriciusa Castelli: Le fonti de La Citt√† felice.

Material from Stoic literature is also used in the state model, and the influence of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli s is also noticeable.Maria Muccillo: Aristotelismo, platonismo ed ermetismo ne \\"La citt√† felice \\"Di Francesco Patricius da Cherso.

Della historia diece dialoghi  Patricius was one of the pioneers of History Theory, a young branch of research at that time. Ten dialogues of the Venetian scholar, which he published in 1560 under the title Della historia diece dialoghi , deal with the basics of History of Philosophy and the methods of historical research. The fictional dialogues take place in Venice among friends and acquaintances of the author, he is always there. The participants in the speech represent and oppose different opinions. Her remarks are presented in a way that corresponds to a natural course of conversation, with frequent interruptions and digressions, with irony, doubt, ridicule and a wealth of witty remarks.Friedrich Walkhoff: Francesco Patriciuss Leben und Werk , Bonn 1920 , Pp. 50-52.

Engraving in Patricius's writing La militia romana di Polibio, di Tito Livio, e di Dionigi Alicarnaseo , Ferrara 1583  La militia romana di Polibio, di Tito Livio, e di Dionigi Alicarnaseo  The treatise La militia romana di Polibio, di Tito Livio, e di Dionigi Alicarnaseo (The Roman warfare after Polybios, Titus Livius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus) , which Patricius wrote in 1573, was not printed until ten years later. It is strongly inspired by Machiavelli's ideas. The starting point is the thesis that the art of war is the basis of peace and a prerequisite for human happiness. The decisive factor is the warfare of the ancient Romans, which is superior to all others, especially the Turkish. You have to stick to this model, because if you can regain the old Roman clout, you no longer have to fear the Turks. The only one who has almost succeeded so far is Duke Alfonso I d'Este, who as a general, as well as in siege technology and in fortress construction, is the unmatched role model of all other rulers. With this flattery, Patricius wanted to impress Duke Alfonso II d'Este, grandson of Alfonso I, who was then ruling in Ferrara. He dedicated his writing to him.Cesare Vasoli: Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1989, pp. 229-233; Friedrich Walkhoff: Francesco Patriciuss Leben und Werk , Bonn 1920, pp. 47 f.  Paralleli militari  The Paralleli militari (Military Comparisons) , printed in two parts in 1594 and 1595, are Patricius's last publication. They take stock of his considerations in the face of the political and military crisis in Italy in the late 16th century. He claimed to be able to use his theory of warfare to instruct the military in their own field. For this purpose he sent his writing to the well-known military commanders Ferrante Gonzaga, Francesco Maria II Della Rovere and Alfonso II D'Este.Cesare Vasoli: Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1989, p . 234-240. = Literary studies =  Discorso della diversit√† de 'furori poetici  The Discorso della diversit√† de 'furori poetici (treatise on the diversity of poetic emotions) , a 1553 printed youth work by Patricius, deals with the origin and the different products of poetic inspiration. The author deals with the controversial relationship between inspired work in a state of emotion and learned engineering techniques based on traditional norms and patterns. According to the concept of the Discorso , the inspired poet is a creator who follows his inspiration without being bound by rules; his art cannot be learned, but a divine gift. Following the poetics of the Roman poet Horace, the humanist theorist assumes that \\"ingegno\\" and \\"furore\\" work together in poetic production. By \\"ingegno\\" he means individual inclination, talent and here especially mental agility, by \\"furore\\" the inspiration from the divine Muses. Thanks to the interplay of these factors, the poet gains a privileged relationship with the deity, which makes him appear sick and crazy from the perspective of people without understanding.Marie-Dominique Couzinet: Mythe, fureur et m√©lancolie.

Lettura sopra il sonetto del Petrarca \\"La gola, e'l sonno, e l'ociose piume\\"  This font is also one of Patricius's youth works printed as early as 1553. Here he analyzes the sonnet La gola, e'l sonno, e l'ociose piume of the famous poet Francesco Petrarca from a philosophical perspective, giving him a symbolic meaning in the context of the Platonic Soul Doctrine.Anna Laura Puliafito: Petrarca filosofo platonico.

Della retorica dialoghi dieci  Patricius's ten dialogues on rhetoric were printed in Venice in 1562. They are dedicated to Cardinal Niccol√≤ Sfondrati, who later became Pope Gregory XIV. Each dialogue is named after one of the participants. The author himself is involved in all discussions. The scripture turns against the opinion widespread in humanist circles, based on the view of Aristotle and Ciceros, that rhetoric is an art of conviction that is necessary for any knowledge transfer. Patricius sees this as an overestimation of this discipline, which he regards as a means of deception and is viewed with skepticism. He describes it as a mere technique of dealing with linguistic means of expression without any internal relation to truth and reality. Since the principle of rhetoric is unknown and because it deals with the probable and not with the true, it cannot be called science at the current state of knowledge, although the possibility of future scientific rhetoric remains open.Benedetto Croce: Problemi di estetica e contributi alla storia dell'estetica italiana , 6th edition, Bari 1966, pp. 299-310; Hanna-Barbara Gerl: Introduction to the Philosophy of the Renaissance , 2nd edition, Darmstadt 1995, pp. 142, 145‚Äì150. Other topics of rhetoric writing are the origin of language and the power of words. The author believes that the spoken word had a magical power in a mythical past. The later introduced control of the minds with the art of persuasion was only a cheatechoes of this original power, because the former connection with the truth had been lost to humanity.See for this myth Maria Muccillo: Et√† dell'oro e tempo ciclico in Francesco Patricius. Arthur O. Lewis (ed.): Utopia e modernit√† , Vol. 2, Rome 1989, pp. 785‚Äì825, here: 792‚Äì802. Patricius draws a cultural pessimistic Image of human history, emphasizing fear as a decisive factor that led to the deplorable state of civilization in his time and dominated social life. In the context of this decline he categorizes the origins and history of rhetoric.Eugenio Garin: Aneddoti di storia della cultura del Cinquecento. In: Umanesimo e Rinascimento.

Parere in difesa dell'Ariosto  The appearance of the final version of Torquato Tassos epic Jerusalem Delivered in 1581 sparked lively controversy in Ferrara. Admirers Tassos faced a group of literary critics for whom Ariosts Orlando Furioso was the authoritative pattern. After the poet Camillo Pellegrino made a pejorative statement about Ariost's fabric treatment, Patricius intervened in 1585 with a pamphlet. In his statement, entitled Parere in difesa dell'Ariosto , he praised Ariost's independence, who neither mimicked the epics Homer s nor followed the rules of Aristotle's poetics. Based on the current controversy, Patricius wanted to show the uselessness of the established Aristotelian poetry. He claimed, among other things, that Homer, like Ariost, had not adhered to the rules of this poetics. Tasso immediately responded with a reply in which he defended the conventional principles.Klaus Werner: The genre of the epic according to Italian and French poetics of the 16th century , Bern 1977, pp. 143‚Äì155; Micaela Rinaldi: Torquato Tasso e Francesco Patricius , Ravenna 2001, pp. 33 f., 37‚Äì44; Bernard Weinberg: \\"A History of Literary Criticism in the Italian Renaissance\\", Vol. 1, Chicago 1961, pp. 600-603 and Vol. 2, Chicago 1961, pp. 997-1000. See Lina Bolzoni: L'universo dei poemi possibili , Rome 1980, p. 196. A page from Patricius's handwritten manuscript of Poetica . Parma, Biblioteca Palatina, Pal. 408, fol. 25r  Poetica  The Poetica is a large-scale representation of Patricius's poetry theory, an alternative to Aristotle's Poetics . It comprises seven volumes, called decades, because they each consist of ten books. The first two decades, the Deca istoriale and the Deca disputata , were printed in 1586. The Deca istoriale offers a detailed description of the poetic products of antiquity and the forms of their public reception. The inventory is followed by the classification, the examination of Metrik and the presentation of the presentation of poetry in cultural life. One of the theses put forward here is that the actors had always sung at the Tragedy Performances in ancient Greece. The second decade deals with theory. It concludes with a discussion of Torquato Tasso's understanding of poetic quality. Patricius called this part of his work Trimerone (three-day work) because it had taken three days to draft. The remaining five decades, which were lost in the early modern period, were only discovered in 1949 and published in 1969/1971.Danilo Aguzzi Barbagli (ed.): Francesco Patricius da Cherso: Della poetica , Vol. 1, Florence 1969, p. XVI; Eugene E. Ryan: Torquato Tasso e Francesco Patricius nella controversia cinquecentesca sulla poesia.

Controversy with Jacopo Mazzoni  Patricius had an intensive discussion with the scholar Jacopo Mazzoni, who contradicted him on a philological question. It was about the lost work Daphnis oder Lityerses by the Hellenistic poet Sositheus, which was probably a satire. Patricius wrongly believed that Daphnis and Lityerses were the titles of two tragedies of Sositheos, while Mazzoni - also falsely - assumed that it was an Eclogue with the title Daphnis and Lityerses . Patricius responded to Mazzoni's criticism of his hypothesis in 1587 with a reply, the Risposta di Francesco Patricius a due opposizioni fattegli dal Signor Giacopo Mazzoni (response to two objections by Mr Jacopo Mazzoni) , to which Mazzoni published a reply, to which Patricius replied with a new replica, the Difesa di Francesco Patricius dalle cento accuse dategli dal Signor Iacopo Mazzoni (Francesco Patricius's defense against the hundred accusations made against him by Mr Jacopo Mazzoni) . = Erotic =  Discorsi et argomenti on Luca Contiles sonnets  Patricius was friends with the poet Luca Contile. When he published an edition of his friend's collected poetic works in Venice in 1560, he added his discorsi et argomenti , introductory and explanatory texts, in which he laid out a philosophical basis for the love poetry. He continued the treatment of the subject of Erost in Plato's dialogue Symposium and transferred to his revered friend Tarquinia Molza the role of Plato's famous literary figure Diotima, who had the essential knowledge mediated through love. He compared the ancient love poem with that of the Renaissance. After dealing with the theory, he went into the poetic implementation of philosophical thoughts and commented on fifty sonnets Contiles.Erna Baniƒá-Pajniƒá: Marsilio Ficino and Franciscus Patricius on Love.

Il Delfino overo Del bacio  When Patricius wrote the dialogue Il Delfino overo Del bacio (Delfino or About the Kiss) is controversial.On the dating question Lina Bolzoni: A proposito di una recente edizione di inediti patriziani. In: Rinascimento 16, 1976, pp. 133‚Äì156, here: 148 f. He did not publish it; the work was not made available in print until 1975, when the critical first edition appeared. The interlocutors are the author and an angelo Delfino, after whom the work is named, which cannot be identified with certainty. Delfino is probably a member of the important Venetian noble family of the Dolfin.Danilo Aguzzi Barbagli (ed.): Francesco Patricius da Cherso: Lettere ed opuscoli inediti, Florenz 1975, S. XXIII and p. 135 Note 1. The starting point is a question that the young Delfino asks the patrician who lives in seclusion: he wants to know what is causing the \\"sweetness\\" of the kiss. He found nothing about it in love literature; she ignores the kiss as if it were irrelevant to love. The two men discuss the different types of kissing and their effects, and Patricius gives a detailed explanation that satisfies the questioner. He goes into the different erotic sensibilities of individual parts of the body and rehabilitates the sense of touch that has been dismissed by Marsilio Ficino. Finally, the grateful Delfino sends a prayer to the \\"exceedingly powerful\\" god of love Amor.Pierre Laurens: Petite introduction √† la philosophie du baiser. In: Francesco Patricius: Du baiser, Paris 2002, pp. 17-26, here: 20-26; Sabrina Ebbersmeyer: Sensuality and Reason, Munich 2002, pp. 232 f.  L'amorosa filosofia  Tarquinia Molza L'amorosa filosofia belongs to the genre of the love treatise that was extremely popular in Italy in the 16th century, the trattati d'amore . It is a writing about female attractiveness and love, which Patricius wrote in Modena in 1577 but did not publish. The incompletely preserved, apparently unfinished work was only edited in 1963 based on the author's own manuscript. It consists of four dialogs. Participants in the discussion are a number of people, including the author and Bernardino Telesio as the central figure Tarquinia Molza. In the first dialogue, which makes up about half of the text, Tarquinia does not appear, but is the focus of attention because dThe participants in the discussion describe and praise their intellectual, artistic and physical advantages. According to this representation, she embodies in a unique perfection the ideal of women of her time, which is modeled on the Renaissance ideal of the universal person. She comes from a noble family, is musically and literarily well educated and an excellent poet, has a quick grasp and an excellent memory and is inspired by passionate curiosity. Her character is exemplary, her voice angelic, her beauty makes her godlike. In the remaining three dialogues, Tarquinia herself speaks and expresses her view in a high-level conversation. This is where the traditional ideas, the concepts of Platonic, courtly and the Christian love originate in the background; the self-love is emphasized as the basis of all other manifestations of love.John Charles Nelson (ed.): Francesco Patricius: L'amorosa filosofia , Florence 1963, pp. VII ‚Äì IX, XVI; Cesare Vasoli: Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1989, pp. 187-194. = Water management = In 1578/1579 Patricius dealt with a water management and at the same time political question. The occasion was a serious problem on the lower reaches of the Po, on the bank of which is Ferrara. After a devastating flood of the river Reno it was channeled in 1442 and led into the Po. The melioration measure was in the interest of the city damaged by the flood Bologna, which the Reno flows past. In the opinion of the Ferrarese, however, it was the cause of the landing, which severely impaired shipping in its area on the Po. Therefore, the rulers of Ferrara in the 15th and 16th centuries reluctantly consented to the introduction of Reno water into the Po or refused to grant it. For this reason, a new conflict between the two cities arose in the 1570s, in which Pope Gregory XIII. Took over the mediation.Danilo Aguzzi Barbagli (ed.): Francesco Patricius da Cherso: Lettere ed opuscoli inediti , Florence 1975, pp. XXVI f. The Pope set up a commission of inquiry in which Scipione di Castro, a political advisor without engineering skills, set the tone. Di Castro wrote an expert opinion in 1578, in which he came to the conclusion that the landing was not caused by the Reno. This angered the Ferrarese, for whom Patricius took the floor after extensive studies. He first formulated and justified his opinion in a report drawn up in 1579 for Duke Alfonso II d'Este, the Discorso sopra lo stato del Po di Ferrara (treatise on the condition of the Po of Ferrara) , and then in a damning opinion on the document of Castro, the Risposta alla scrittura di D. Scipio di Castro sopra l'arrenamento del Po di Ferrara . His contact on the part of the Curia was the Bishop Tommaso Sanfelice, with whom he could communicate well. In 1580, Patricius wrote a report on his negotiations with Sanfelice. However, the Duke did not take up his bold proposals for the construction of new canals.Danilo Aguzzi Barbagli (ed.): Francesco Patricius da Cherso: Lettere ed opuscoli inediti , Florence 1975, pp. XXVII ‚Äì XXX; Alessandra Fiocca: Francesco Patricius e la questione del Reno nella seconda met√† del Cinquecento: tre lettere inedite.

The namesake is Fabio Barignano, a contemporary poet from Pesaro who was still very young at that time, and who appears as one of the two participants in the fictional discussion. His interlocutor is also a historical figure, the Count Giovan Giacomo Leonardi, a diplomat in the service of the Duke of Urbino. In the dedication letter, Patricius notes that honor is very important to everyone. Even the worst person wanted to be respected everywhere and held to be honorable and took revenge for insult and slander. Nevertheless, no one has ever dedicated a script to honor and examined philosophically what it actually consists of. Only one special aspect, the duel, has so far been discussed in the literature. The Barignano should remedy this deficiency. During the conversation, Leonardi conveys his young dialogue partner his understanding of true honor. According to him, this does not consist in prestige, but in an unshakable onevirtuous basic attitude. Therefore, one can never lose true honor, which does not depend on the judgments of others, in contrast to the theory of pretense, an ephemeral reputation based on external values and questionable ideas.Isabella Fedozzi: Il Barignano: Francesco Patricius ed il dibattito sull'onore nella cultura del Cinquecento.

He also glorified the painter Irene di Spilimbergo in two sonnets after her early death.Ivana Skuhala Karasman, Luka Bor≈°iƒá: Patricius and His Women. In: Tom√°≈° Nejeschleba, Paul Richard Blum (ed .): Francesco Patricius. Philosopher of the Renaissance , Olomouc 2014, pp. 162-184, here: 167-169. The first of the two poems of praise, L'Eridano (Der Po) , was created when the philosopher unsuccessfully sought employment at the court of the Duke of Ferrara, Ercole II D'Este, tried. It was intended to show the ruler the humanistic qualifications of the author and at the same time to impress with the usual flattery. Patricius dedicated the poem, in which he praised the ruling family, to a duke's brother, the cardinal Ippolito d'Este. He had it printed in 1557 and included an explanation of the verse form, the Sostentamenti del nuovo verso heroico . As in other fields, he also appeared as an innovator here: he claimed that he was introducing a new heroic measure into Italian poetry that matched the heroic content of an epic. These are thirteen silbler with a caesura after the sixth syllable, a form recreated from the classic hexameter. In reality, this measure, which probably goes back to the Alexandrine, was not new, it was already used in the 14th century.Lina Bolzoni: L'universo dei poemi possibili , Rome 1980, pp. 47‚Äì 52; Friedrich Walkhoff: Francesco Patriciuss Leben und Werk , Bonn 1920, pp. 37 f.

Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale, Filze Rinuccini 19, fol. 9r The second poem of praise, the Badoaro , was written in 1558 and is also written in the \\"new\\" heroic measure. Patricius praises the Venetian humanist, politician and diplomat Federico Badoer.

In: Giornale storico della letteratura italiana 18 , 1981, pp. 71-101, here: 71-73, 99-101. = Letters = Around a hundred letters from Patricius have survived, including a letter of 26 June 1572 to Bernardino Telesio, which is particularly important as a source, in which he critically examines his philosophical principles, and an autobiographical letter to his friend Baccio Valori, dated 12 January 1587.See the Silvano Cavazza collection (ed.): Una lettera inedita di Francesco Patricius da Cherso. In: Centro di Ricerche Storiche - Rovigno: Atti 9, 1978/1979, p 377‚Äì396, here: 379. They make up only a modest part of his correspondence and largely date from the years in Ferrara and Rome; all letters from adolescence are lost. The style is factual and dry, without literary jewelry. This source material shows the scholar as an important figure in the cultural life of his era.Danilo Aguzzi Barbagli (ed.): Francesco Patricius da Cherso: Lettere ed opuscoli inediti , Florenz 1975, S. XVII ‚Äì XXII. = Del governo de 'regni = According to a hypothesis by John-Theophanes Papademetriou, which is considered plausible,Paul Oskar Kristeller: Eight philosophers of the Italian Renaissance, Weinheim 1986, p. 98. Patricius has the Italian printed in Ferrara in 1583 Translation of an oriental fairy tale collection under the title Del governo de 'regni' . The template was a Greek version of this work, which was originally made in India and is called Fables of Bidpai orhe Kalƒ´la wa Dimna is known.John-Theophanes Papademetriou: The Sources and the Character of Del governo de 'regni.' 'In:' 'Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association 92, 1961, pp. 422-439, here: 434-437.  Teaching  With his teachings in different subject areas, Patricius wanted to distinguish himself as a critic of traditional ways of thinking and finder of new ways. He preferred to differentiate himself from all previous developments and chose an unusual approach, which he - sometimes exaggerating - presented as a fundamental innovation. He sought to broaden the horizons and go beyond the usual limits. In doing so, he came across one of the main obstacles that he tried to remove: the relatively rigid housing of Aristotelism, which dominated in school philosophy, which had developed over the centuries through the extensive Aristotle commentary and allowed innovation only within a predetermined, narrow framework. In view of this situation, the humanist's polemic was directed not only against Aristotle, but also against the scholastic tradition shaped by Aristotelian thinking and in particular against its averroistic current. He accused Aristotelians and scholastics of dealing with words - abstractions introduced arbitrarily and without reason - rather than things and having lost all contact with the reality of nature.See Cesare Vasoli: La critica di Francesco Patricius ai \\"principia\\" aristotelici. In: Rivista di storia della filosofia 51, 1996, pp. 713-787, here: 713-716, 718-725; Karl Schuhmann: Francesco Patricius and Hermetic Philosophy.

In general, Patricius's philosophy is characterized by the priority of the deductive approach. He derived his theses from premise n, the correctness of which he considered evident. In doing so, he aspired to be scientific, based on the model of mathematical discourse. The goal was knowledge of the whole existing through order (rerum universitas) through an understanding of structures. Patricius justified his rejection of Aristotelian reasoning by saying that it failed in relation to contingents. His approach should remedy this shortcoming; he wanted to systematize the contingent and thereby make it capable of science.Hanna- Barbara Gerl: Humanistic and geometric language philosophy. In: Journal for Philosophical Research 36, 1982, pp. 189-207 , here: 193-199. = Metaphysics, natural philosophy and mathematics = In natural philosophy, Patricius emphasized the novelty of his teaching; he stated that he was announcing \\"great things\\" and \\"outrageous things.\\"Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 2, Hamburg 2017, p. 1631. In fact, he made a fundamental break with the medieval and early modern scholastic tradition.Edward Grant: Much ado about nothing , Cambridge 1981, pp. 200 f.  Space concept  In scholastic physics based on Aristotelian standards, which still prevailed in the 16th century, spatial concept was bound to the concept of location. The place was conceived as a kind of vessel that can absorb the body and constitute the space. The idea of a three- dimensional space that existed independently of places as a reality of its own was missing.Thomas Leinkauf: Floor plan philosophy of humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , vol. 2, Hamburg 2017, p. 1644. See Max Jammer: Das Problem des Raumes , 2nd, extended edition, Darmstadt 1980, pp. 16‚Äì22. Patricius opposed this way of thinking with his new spatial concept.For Patricius's argument against the Aristotelian spatial concept see John Henry: Francesco Patricius da Cherso's Concept of Space and its Later Influence. In: Annals of Science 36, 1979, pp. 549‚Äì573, here: 560‚Äì562. According to his understanding, space is neither a substance nor an Accident, it cannot be integrated into it Aristotelian category scheme.Max Jammer: The Problem of Space , 2nd, extended edition, Darmstadt 1980, p. 93. He is also not a \\"nothing\\" or similar to the non-being, but an actual being something, namely the first being in the world of the sensible. The being of space precedes all other physical being temporally and ontological, it is the prerequisite for its existence. If the world perished, blove the space nonetheless, not only potential, but actually. As something, space is qualitatively determined; its characteristics are receptivity, three-dimensionality and homogeneity. He is indifferent to what is in him. Considered in and of itself, it is equivalent to the vacuum. On the one hand, physical space is physical because it has three dimensions like a body, on the other hand it is non-physical because it does not offer any resistance.Edward Grant: \\"Much ado about nothing\\", Cambridge 1981, pp. 200‚Äì204; Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 2, Hamburg 2017, pp. 1645‚Äì1647; Maria Muccillo: La prima creatura: la concezione patriziana dello spazio fisico e le sue fonti.

Philosophy of Mathematics  With the \\"new geometry\\" that Patricius proposed, he meant a new philosophical foundation of this science. He justified their necessity with an inadequacy of the Euclidean system: Euclid had defined elementary terms such as point, line and area, but had failed to develop a philosophical system that would allow the other geometric terms to be determined correctly. Above all, Euclid does not have a definition of space, although space must be the primary object of geometry. Patricius tried to remedy this deficiency by making space the basis of his own system and deriving points, lines, angles, surfaces and bodies from it.Jacomien Prins: Echoes of an Invisible World , Leiden 2015, p. 258-260; Vincenzo De Risi: Francesco Patricius e la nuova geometria dello spazio. In: Delfina Giovannozzi, Marco Veneziani (ed.): Locus- Spatium , Florence 2014, pp. 269‚Äì327, here: 269‚Äì 275. In Patricius's understanding, the continuum is a real fact, while the discrete is a product of thought. This gave him the primacy of geometry over mathematics over arithmetic. This view corresponded to the state of knowledge at that time; the analytical geometry, which extends the concept of number and makes it continuous, has not yet been discovered.Paul Oskar Kristeller: Eight philosophers of the Italian Renaissance , Weinheim 1986, p. 106; Edward Grant: Much ado about nothing , Cambridge 1981, p. 206.  Cosmology and world origin  According to Aristotelian cosmology, the world of material things enclosed by the spherical vault of heaven forms the whole of the universe. Nothing can be outside of this limited universe, not even time and empty space. Patricius, on the other hand, considered that part of the three- dimensional space that he imagined contains all of the matter to be a delimited area surrounded by empty space. The question of the form of this area remained open. The Aristotelian assumption that the material world is spherical was viewed with skepticism by Patricius, since no proof of the spherical shape of the sky had been provided.Cesare Vasoli: Francesco Patricius sull'infinit√† dell'universo. In: Michele Ciliberto, Cesare Vasoli (ed.): Filosofia e cultura. Per Eugenio Garin , vol. 1, Rome 1991, pp. 277-308, here: 286-291. Apparently he preferred the hypothesis that the material part of the universe takes the form of a regular tetrahedron s hat.Luc Deitz: Space, Light, and Soul in Francesco Patricius's Nova de universis philosophia (1591). In: Anthony Grafton, Nancy Siraisi (ed.): Natural Particulars , Cambridge (Massachusetts) 1999, pp. 139‚Äì169, here: 143‚Äì147, 155 f. In the middle of the material world, according to his model, is the earth, which rotates about its axis every day. He did not consider the counter-hypothesis, a daily rotation of the celestial vault around the earth, to be plausible, since the required speed was hardly possible.Lynn Thorndike: A History of Magic and Experimental Science , Vol 6, 4th edition, New York / London 1966, p. 376. He rejected the conventional explanation of the movements of the heavenly bodies, according to which the stars are attached to transparent material spheres (sphere n), whose revolutions they follow. Instead, he assumed that they were moving freely in the room. For him, the traditional idea that the orbits were circular also fell away. Therefore, he also gave up the concept of the Sphere Harmony, which has been widespread since ancient times, which presupposes physical spheres. However, he held on to the idea of a harmonious structure of the cosmos in the sense of the Platonic natural philosophy.Jacomien Prins: Echoes of an Invisible World , Leiden 2015, pp. 267‚Äì269, 277 f. The appearance of a new star, the Supernova from 1572, he took the opportunity to declare Aristotle's claim that the sky is unchangeable and imperishable to be refuted.Jacomien Prins: Echoes of an Invisible World, Leiden 2015, p. 273. In Patricius's model, the material world is surrounded by an infinitely extended, homogeneous, empty space. This is flooded with light; an empty room must be bright because the light is everywhere where there is no material that could create darkness with its impenetrability.Karl Schuhmann: Francesco Patricius and the hermetic philosophy. In: Schuhmann: Selected papers on Renaissance philosophy and on Thomas Hobbes , Dordrecht 2004, pp. 157-170, here: 159 f. The space that encompasses the material world already existed before the creation of matter, which then in put him in. With this hypothesis, the humanist thinker contradicted Aristotelian teaching, according to which a vacuum is in principle impossible. He also accepted vacuums within the physical world; these are tiny empty spaces between the particles of matter. He saw one of several proofs of the existence of such vacuums in the condensation processes, in which, in his opinion, the empty spaces are filled.John Henry: Francesco Patricius da Cherso's Concept of Space and its Later Influence. \\"In:\\" \\"Annals of Science\\" \\"36, 1979, pp. 549-573, here: 562-565; John Henry: Void Space, Mathematical Realism and Francesco Patricius da Cherso's Use of Atomistic Arguments.

In cosmogony, the doctrine of the origin of the world, Patricius adopted the basic principles of the Neoplatonic Emanationism, which represents the creation of everything created as a gradual emergence from a divine source. He used the ideas of the Chaldean Oracles and the Hermetics.Anna Laura Puliafito: \\"Principio primo\\" e \\"Principi principiati\\" nella \\"Nova de Universis Philosophia\\" di Francesco Patricius .

In: Schuhmann: Selected papers on Renaissance philosophy and on Thomas Hobbes , Dordrecht 2004, pp. 157‚Äì170, here: 161‚Äì165. In contrast to Aristotle, Patricius assumed a temporal beginning of the world. According to his teaching, the creation of the cosmos is not an arbitrary act of God, but a necessity. It inevitably results from God's nature, which demands creation. God must create.Miguel A. Granada: Palingenio, Patricius, Bruno, Mersenne. In: Guido Canziani (ed.): Potentia Dei , Milan 2000, pp. 105‚Äì134, here : 111‚Äì113. As creator, he is the source, the first principle in which everything has its origin. This source is called \\"the one\\" in Neoplatonism. Patricius used his own word creation for this: un'omnia (\\"One-Everything\\").Luc Deitz: \\"\\" Space, Light, and Soul in Francesco Patricius's Nova de universis philosophia (1591). \\"\\" In : Anthony Grafton, Nancy Siraisi (ed.): Natural Particulars , Cambridge (Massachusetts) 1999, pp. 139‚Äì169, here: 140‚Äì142. According to the model of the \\"new philosophy\\", the first product of the creation process is the spatial principle, the indifferent, neutral principle of the local. Its existence is the prerequisite for everything else, for the unfolding of nature. The starting point of nature is the second principle, the \\"light\\". This does not mean light as a natural phenomenon and the object of sensory perception, but a supra-objective natural condition, the generating principle of form, which is also the principle of knowing and being recognized. From this light emerge in a continuous process, which are metaphorically referred to as the \\"seeds\\" of things. These are introduced through the \\"heat\\" (Latin calor ) into the \\"flow\\" or the \\"moisture\\" (Latin \\"fluor\\"), a flexible substrate, from which the preforms are made of world things, their patterns. All of this is not yet material; the first emanation processes take place in a purely intellectual area. In this context, terms such as fluor and calor are only used to illustrate the non-illustrative. By fluor we mean the continuity principle, which creates the connection between the different elementary areas, forces and designs. At the same time, fluorine is the passive principle of taking up form andFactor that gives the bodies the resilience needed to maintain their mutual delimitation. The \\"warmth\\" represents an active principle, it is the dynamic unfolding of the light principle in the fluor .Thomas Leinkauf: Francesco Patricius (1529‚Äì1597). In: Paul Richard Blum (ed. ): Philosophers of the Renaissance , Darmstadt 1999, pp. 173-187, here: 184 f .; Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 2, Hamburg 2017, pp. 1645 f., 1649, 1663‚Äì1666.

Thus the four basic principles \\"space\\", \\"light\\", \\"flowing\\" and \\"warmth\\" are the basis of the cosmos. The material world emerges from them. They form a complex ideal unity that is inherent in all material existence and precedes it as a condition of existence. On the material level, the principle of fluorine is shown in the form of the relative \\"liquid\\" of the material objects. This means their different degrees of density. These are the cause of the different resistance of physical bodies, their hardness or softness.See Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 2, Hamburg 2017, p. 1664 -1666; Gregorio Piaia: Tra misticismo neoplatonico e \\"filosofia dei fiumi\\". In: Quaderni per la storia dell'Universit√† di Padova 29, 1996, pp. 127‚Äì146, here: 138‚Äì140. This cosmology also has an epistemological aspect. If the physical universe depends on the generating principle of light, it is light-like. Accordingly, from Patricius's perspective, nature does not appear to be impenetrable, alien and dark matter, but is in itself clear, it manifests itself. Its clarity does not have to be set and produced by the human observer. Accordingly, there can be no fundamental, unsolvable problem of natural knowledge.Thomas S√∂ren Hoffmann: Philosophy in Italy , Wiesbaden 2007, p. 300 f.  Concept of time  When examining time, Patricius dealt with Aristotle's definition, which he subjected to fundamental criticism. Aristotle made several mistakes at the same time by defining that time is \\"the number or measure of movement by means of earlier or later\\". He had made the measure and number, which are the products of human thought, essential to the inherent fact of nature, as if a thought of man gave being to a natural thing. In reality, time exists without any measurement or count. In addition, Aristotle only took movement into account and ignored standstill or rest. It is not time that measures movement, but movement that time. Movement and measurement are not even essential for human perception of time. Even the \\"earlier\\" and \\"later\\" of things subject to the passage of time are not part of the essence of time. Rather, time is nothing more than the duration of the body.Karl Schuhmann: On the emergence of the modern concept of time: Telesio, Patricius, Gassendi. In: Schuhmann: Selected papers on Renaissance philosophy and on Thomas Hobbes, Dordrecht 2004, pp. 73‚Äì98, here: 82‚Äì89. According to this understanding, time cannot be ontologically equal to space. Since it is determined as the duration of bodies, but the existence of bodies presupposes that of space, time must be subordinate to space, the primary given, and also to the bodies.Karl Schuhmann: To the emergence of the modern concept of time: Telesio, Patricius, Gassendi. In: Schuhmann: Selected papers on Renaissance philosophy and on Thomas Hobbes , Dordrecht 2004, pp. 73‚Äì98, here: 82 f., 89; Thomas S√∂ren Hoffmann: Philosophy in Italy , Wiesbaden 2007, p. 303. = Anthropology = In the Pampsychia , the third part of the Nova de universis philosophia , Patricius dealt with the determination of the specifically human through demarcation from the animal. There he dealt with the animus , the invigorating and enabling body in the cosmos and especially in living things. He came to the conclusion that there was no inherently irrational animus . In doing so, he turned against the popular opinion that the animals had an irrational soul. In his understanding, rationality is not a peculiarity of man, but is more or less pronounced in the animal world. The empirical finding does not allow a fundamental delimitation of the rational from the irrational, rather the differences between the species with regard to rationality are only gradual.Anna Laura Puliafito: Francesco Patricius e la ragione degli animali. In: Bruniana & Campanelliana 17, 2011, pp. 129-138, here: 129 f., 137; Jacomien Prins: Echoes of an Invisible World , Leiden 2015, pp. 344‚Äì349. It also makes no sense to use the speech act - defined as \\"uttered in words\\" - as a demarcation characteristic of humans, because there is no fundamental discontinuity in this regard either. The utterances of the animals are means of communication that are part of their languages, and their functions are analogous to human languages. The animals were also given a certain level of cognition, which enabled them to act in a targeted manner, and they had reason (ratiocinium), because they were able to meaningfully exchange individual memories with new ones To link perceptions, and that is the activity of the mind. The special position of man rests only on his ability to gain deep insight into causal relationships with the intellect and on the immortality of his soul.Anna Laura Puliafito: Francesco Patricius e la ragione degli animali. In: Bruniana & Campanelliana 17, 2011, pp. 129-138. In the writing La gola, e'l sonno, e l'ociose piume , Patricius cited the characteristic of the specifically human in addition to access to knowledge that goes beyond what is perceived by the senses, the impulse control.Anna Laura Puliafito: Animi brutorum in se ipsos faciunt syllogismos? In: Luisa Secchi Tarugi (ed.): ' 'Feritas, humanitas e divinitas come aspetti del vivere nel Rinascimento' ', Florence 2012, pp. 405‚Äì416, here: 406‚Äì408. Like all Neoplatonists, Patricius dealt intensively with the relationship between the spiritual (intelligible) and the sensually perceptible world. In the hierarchical order of his system, the material sphere is subordinate to the spiritual in every respect, since it is its image and product. The spiritual, as the higher level, is the simpler and closer to the divine origin, the sensually perceptible appears in the variety of the individual sensory objects and the complexity of the physical world. Each of the two spheres is graduated in itself, whereby the simpler is always the superior in rank and power. The relatively simple is always the all-encompassing at the same time, since it produces the relatively complex and varied. Within this order of all reality, man takes a middle position. He forms the lowest level of expression in the spiritual world, because his intellect is the spiritual form that connects its unity with the greatest degree of diversity. At the same time, he is the highest level of existence in the field of beings bound to a physical substrate, since he is the only one with an intellect.Thomas Leinkauf: Francesco Patricius's Poetics of the Wonderful. In: Comparatio 3 , 2011, pp. 189-207, here: 193 f. With regard to the classification of the soul in this system, Patricius's view agrees with the teaching Plotin s, the founder of Neoplatonism. This is about the controversial question among the Neo-Platonists, whether the soul, through its descent into the physical world, surrenders completely to the material circumstances, as the late antique Neo-Platonists meant, or whether Plotinus could maintain its presence in the spiritual world at any time. Patriciuss is convinced that the human soul has no non-rational or suffering life in itself, but only a life of knowledge; the impulsiveness, the irrational is a result of the physicality, which it encounters from the outside.Thomas Leinkauf: Francesco Patricius's Poetics of the Wonderful. In: Comparatio 3, 2011, pp. 189-207, here: 194 f. = History and State Theory =  The draft state utopia  With his youth work La citt√† felice Patricius presented a state model based on Aristotle's Political Theory Utopian. At that time, the Aristotelian guidelines were still decisive for him.Lina Bolzoni: L'universo dei poemi possibili , Rome 1980, pp. 38 f. The starting point is the determination of the human goal in life. For the author as a Christian, this can only be the attainment of the highest good, the future bliss in the hereafter. The hope of this maintains man in need of his earthly existence. However, there must also be a provisional goal on this side: the creation of advantageous living conditions that encourage higher aspirations. For Patricius, like for other humanists, the optimum that can be achieved in earthly existence is the felicit√† , the happiness that he, like ancient Peripateticians and Stoics, does with the practice of virtue (operazione della virt√π) . The state that as citystate in the sense of the ancient polis and the Italian city republic, the task is to create and guarantee stable framework conditions for this. The happiness of the city is the sum of the happiness of its citizens. This presupposes the opportunity to be happy.Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, pp. 905‚Äì907. See Paola Maria Arcari: Il pensiero politico di Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1935, pp. 90‚Äì93. On a social level, the needs arising from the natural love for life in community must be met. On an individual level, it is about carefully maintaining the bond that connects soul and body, maintaining the spirit of life by fulfilling the physical needs. First of all, the physical must be guaranteed; The conditions include favorable climatic conditions and an adequate supply of water and food. If these basic requirements are met, community and public life can be optimized. This requires that citizens know and interact with one another, for example through meals together, and in particular that they connect with one another through educational aspirations and intellectual exchange. To make this possible, the citizenship must not exceed a certain size. Furthermore, the social and class structural inequality among the citizens must be kept within limits; the state should provide public meeting places and the legislation should counter private hostilities. Patricius's central demands are the temporal limitation of the exercise of power and the free access of every citizen to the highest state offices. This is to prevent tyrannis chem or oligarchical abuse of power.

See Paola Maria Arcari: Il pensiero politico di Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1935, pp. 122‚Äì132. Patricius believes religious cult, rites and a priesthood to satisfy a basic human need are necessary, \\"temples and churches\\" are to be built and \\"the gods\\" are worshiped. The religion of the \\"happy city\\" is not described in any more detail, in any case it does not have a specifically Christian character.Cesare Vasoli: Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1989, pp. 13, 16‚Äì18. A particularly important state goal is the education of children to virtue. Legislators must ensure that they are not exposed to bad influences. Great emphasis is placed on the musical education of the youth. The teaching in music and painting has a propaedeutic function with regard to later philosophical activity.Michel Aubin: La Cit√© heureuse de Franjo Petriƒá.

According to the state theory of Aristotle, the population of the city-state is divided into classes. Only the upper classes, the ruling class, form the citizens with political rights. The members of the lower classes - farmers, artisans and traders - are busy with their hard work to secure their livelihood and have no opportunity to achieve the happiness they are striving for in the \\"happy city\\". According to the author, they are naturally not predisposed to and capable of doing this. Their arduous existence is a prerequisite for the well-being of the upper class. - With regard to the inevitability of oppression, the young patrician followed the guidelines of Aristotle, who reserved the possibility of a successful life for an elite and saw a natural condition in such social conditions. This view was widespread in the Italian educational class to which Patricius belonged.Lina Bolzoni: \\"L'universo dei poemi possibili\\", Rome 1980, pp. 39‚Äì41; Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, pp. 907 f .; Cesare Vasoli: \\"\\" Francesco Patricius da Cherso \\"\\", Rome 1989, pp. 8-19; Patriciusa Castelli: Le fonti de La Citt√† felice.

See Paola Maria Arcari: Il pensiero politico di Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1935, pp. 95-102.  The evaluation of the forms of government  When comparing the different forms of government, Patricius came to the conclusion that a balanced republican mixed constitution was superior to all alternatives. One should neither entrust too much power to an individual, nor paralyze the state through radical democratization. The rule of a small group spurred ambition too much, which could lead to civil wars. Optimal is the Mixed Constitution of the Republic of Venice, in which aspects of the different forms of government are combined. There the element of individual rule is represented by the office of Doge, the principle of the rule of a small elite is enforced by the Senate and the idea of everyone's participation is taken into account by the establishment of the Grand Council.  Establishing interest in history  As in his state utopia, Patricius also uses his determination of the human aim in life as happiness (felicit√†) when dealing with history. According to his teaching, this has three aspects: mere being as successful self-preservation, eternal being as a union with the deity and being \\"in a good way\\" (bene essere) , successful life in a social context. Looking at history is about studying human striving for being \\"good\\" in this sense. The philosopher turns to his discussion of the historical dimension of life.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 16‚Äì18, 36; Stephan Otto: Materials on the Theory of Intellectual History , Munich 1979, pp. 151 f. The need for happiness in the sense of this good being arises according to Patricius's finding of sensuality and thus the area of Affekt e. Man is a sensual, passionate being. The affects are primary facts and are in themselves neither commendable nor blameworthy, but they create the possibility of behavior to which praise or blame can be referred. Whether or not you can achieve the bene essere depends on whether you learn to properly deal with your passions. A person's work on himself begins with behavior towards his own affinity, and only there can \\"good being\\" be the goal. According to Patricius, the passions do not come into play inside the individual without cause, but always ignite in the encounter with other people and always aim to have a certain effect on others. The right relationship with them can only be gained and consolidated through practice in the community. Good being through mastering passions proves to be identical with ethical behavior in social life, in the family and in the state.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 17 f. , 22. This is where the time dimension comes into play for Patricius. The community is determined not only by the present, but also by its history. Therefore, dealing with the social challenge must include the entire past, which shows itself as history. A human being living only in the present would be exposed to his affects like an animal. What prevents him from doing so is confrontation with the past. Only history opens up the field in which the individual has to face up to his social task and can prove himself through his ethical behavior. A constructive reference to the present is established through the analysis and awareness of the past.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 19, 36 f .; Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, p. 1034.  The criticism of the traditional approaches of historians  The idea that the purpose of dealing with history was to exemplify the validity of moral teachings and to visualize inspiring or dissuasive patterns has been widespread since ancient times. Even in the Renaissance, numerous authors had endorsed this view, including the well-known humanist Giovanni Pontano and Patricius's teacher Francesco Robortello. In this way, the consideration of history was placed in the service of moral education and subordinated to its purposes. This made her the poet and the rhetoricik approximated, which should also aim at educational returns. In addition, a gripping, entertaining, literary narrative was expected from historian as well as from the poet or speaker. As a result, the differences between historical reporting and fictional literature became blurred, for example in the speeches of statesmen and generals invented by historians.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 34‚Äì37; Christiane Haberl: Di scienzia ritratto , Neuried 2001, pp. 151‚Äì153. Patricius rigorously opposed this way of dealing with historical materials, which had been common for thousands of years, although he ultimately also pursued an ethical goal and enthusiastically affirmed the role model function of great figures from the past.For the meaning of role models for Patricius, see Franz Lamprecht: Theory the humanistic historiography, Zurich 1950, pp. 14, 21, 24 f. Like his predecessors, he emphasized the practical use of historical knowledge in civil life and above all in politics. His novelty, however, was that he insisted on a consistent separation between finding the truth and moral instruction or use, and condemned every decoration. In doing so, he attacked the famous historians Thucydides and Livius, whom he accused of having invented alleged speeches that would never have been given in this way.Girolamo Cotroneo: I trattatisti dell \\"Ars historica\\", Naples 1971, pp. 223-226, 231-236; Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 36 f., 48. According to his concept, the lessons to be learned from history are knowledge, which is not mediated through rhetorical language art, but is to be acquired through reflection and contemplation based on the facts ascertained by the historian.Stephan Otto: Materials on the theory of intellectual history , Munich 1979, p. 142. According to Patricius's reasoning, the concept of historiography, which has been common since ancient times, is based on a contradictory relationship to the subject of consideration. The starting point of his considerations can be summarized as follows: The historians theoretically admit to the ideal that historians are obliged to be impartial and to strictly adhere to the truth. However, it is obvious that this is hardly ever the case in practice, because the historians' accounts contradict each other on countless points. Furthermore, there are important obstacles to fulfilling the claim to truth: Because of the obvious subjectivity of perceptions and points of view and the inadequacy of the source-based tradition, historians have only a very limited access to historical reality. At best, they can determine the results of the historical events somewhat correctly, while the circumstances, the background and causes remain in the dark. The actual relationships are only known to the respective actors, but they lack the impartiality required for a truthful presentation. Only impartial eyewitnesses are really reliable, but such rapporteurs are usually not available. The neutral historian has no access to the information that he would actually need for his work.Cesare Vasoli: \\"\\" Francesco Patricius da Cherso \\"\\", Rome 1989, pp. 63‚Äì68; Girolamo Cotroneo: I trattatisti dell '\\" Ars historica \\", Naples 1971, pp. 237‚Äì252; Franz Lamprecht: The theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 38, 47. For Patricius, the train of thought can now be continued like this: A representative of the conventional moralizing, rhetorically embellishing presentation of history may concede, because of the weak points mentioned, that the pure truth must remain hidden. However, he will assert that a rough approximation is still possible. One has to put up with not being able to illuminate the background. This concession will not seem too serious to him, because from his perspective the historical truth is irrelevant anyway. He thinks that historical knowledge is not in itself worth striving for, but only as a means for the purpose of instruction that ultimately serves the actual goal of obtaining bliss.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography, Zurich 1950, pp. 38 f. This is where the decisive counter argument comes in, with which Patricius wants to refute the view he is attacking. It reads: A moral poetic invention - such as the epics of Homer and Virgil s - can produce the desired moral yield as well as a historical work, the truth with Ersomixes. Thus, if one resigns in finding the truth and only holds on to the educational effect, the difference between poetry and historiography is eliminated. Historicity loses its intrinsic value and thus historical research loses its meaning. Then you can - according to Patricius - do without historical studies and instead teach bliss with any fables.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 38 f .; Stephan Otto: Materials on the Theory of Intellectual History , Munich 1979, pp. 154 f.  The concept of scientific history research  Patricius countered the criticism of history with his opposite conviction, according to which the historical researcher's sole aim is to know the historical truth and to find the facts as a contribution to the bene essere is of significant value. According to this concept, objectivity and certainty must be achieved to the extent that is possible for the human mind. In such work, standards of morality are out of the question, there is no question of good or bad. The evaluation of what happened is important, but it is on a different page and has to be done in a different context, from a different perspective. Patricius rejected the connection between philosophy and historiography, as it did for example Polybios;See Marie-Dominique Couzinet: History and Philosophy in Francesco Patricius's Dialoghi della istoria (1560). In: Tom√°≈° Nejeschleba, Paul Richard Blum (ed.): Francesco Patricius. Philosopher of the Renaissance , Olomouc 2014, pp. 62‚Äì88, here: 81‚Äì83. In his opinion, the historian should not philosophize about the hidden causes of the course of history, but only with facts - including the recognizable motives of actors - deal.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 36 f .; Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, pp. 1034 f., 1044 f. See Girolamo Cotroneo: I trattatisti dell '\\" Ars historica \\", Naples 1971, pp. 252‚Äì258. As the subject of historical scientific research in this sense, Patricius determined the documented and remembered processes in the world of the sensible in their entirety. He called them \\"effetti\\" (\\"effects\\"), by which he meant the individual concrete realities over time. It is the singular and contingent facts that enter through the senses and are then processed by the mind and assigned to their reasons. They are effects in contrast to the general causes and purely spiritual conditions with which philosophy deals. The work of the historian is not limited to the collection and documentation of the effetti ; rather, he can also use meticulous research to determine the reasons for their origin, to recognize the intentions and motives behind them. The possibility to explain the empirical historical facts causally justifies the claim of historical research to be a science.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, p. 41; Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, pp. 1036 f. According to this definition of the research object, the historian's field of work is the universal history of the empirically found. Patricius thus opposed the usual limitation to the actions of people and the further narrowing of the field of vision to the deeds of kings, statesmen and generals. From his point of view, the universal history also extends beyond the human world to the processes in nature, that is, the natural history. He also called for the full inclusion of cultural history, that is, intellectual achievements, technical achievements, discoveries of unknown countries and peoples, and the history of individual estates such as artisans, farmers, and shipmen. The Constitutional History deserves special attention; Always ask about the cause of constitutional changes. Patricius considered the intellectual history, which deals with ideas, ideas, opinions and attitudes (concetti dell'animo) , to be more important than the history of deeds. In addition to customs and customs, he also included products such as clothing, structures and ships, as well as all devices manufactured for work and everyday life, as relevant in terms of cultural history. Patricius also called for economic history to be included, which historians had completely neglected. Without considering the economic and financial situation of a state, the representation of its history is empty and airy, because the economy is the basis for the life of every community. Precise information on the state budget is important.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 44 f. Another field that Patricius has complained about so far is peace research. He remarked that he had never heard of a history of peace, even though this area in particular would be a particularly worthwhile topic.Franz Lamprecht: The theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, p. 44.  The method  With regard to the method, Patricius insisted on clear criteria of source criticism. You shouldn't rely on any established authority, you have to check everything yourself. Even the agreement of the information of several authors is not proof of the correctness, it could also be a mere rumor. The best sources are the accounts of historians who themselves were involved in the events. However, they would have to be compared with representations from the opponent's perspective. Secondly, other contemporary reports are relatively credible. Third is information from authors who wrote about the past, but who should nevertheless be given a certain amount of expertise because they themselves belonged to the people in question. Patricius cautioned particularly with historians who report on foreign peoples and deal with events that were long ago. In his opinion, the value of general historical works such as World Chronicle only lies in the fact that the processing of the compiled material from older sources can be examined. One must always ask oneself what expertise the respective rapporteur could have had, to what extent he could be expected to be impartial and what should be said about his guarantors. Patricius annalistic sources are considered to be particularly reliable, provided they are in the original, unadulterated version. In addition, one should pay due attention to the texts created without the intention of tradition, according to the terminology of modern historical science.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 45‚Äì 48; Stephan Otto: Materials on the Theory of Intellectual History , Munich 1979, pp. 155‚Äì158. Patricius compared the historian's penetration from the circumstances of the action to the cause of the action by separating the individual onion skins, which gradually leads to the core of the onion. He also used the metaphor of the anatomist, which is similar to that of the historian. Like the anatomist with the body, the historian has to deal with the action he is investigating. Every action has a main actor (principal attore) , the reason for which must be revealed by cutting.Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, p. 1038 f .; Stephan Otto: Materials on the Theory of the History of Mind , Munich 1979, p. 158.  The story of the future  The determination of the object of investigation as a whole of the temporal processes led Patricius to assume that historical research could even be extended to the future. He considered it fundamentally possible to write a story of the future, that is, to make serious scientific forecasts based on recognized laws. The background was his understanding of the statesman's art, according to which it relies on the ability to anticipate and achieve what is not yet. Accordingly, a ruler empowered to do so would be able to keep records of the correctly foreseen. Then a story of the future lies in the realm of the imaginable.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, p. 41 f .; Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, p. 1037.  The military system  Patricius paid particular attention to the military. He found it unsatisfactory to show the military forces of a state only through reports of battles, conquests, sieges, victories or defeats. Rather, an understanding of the military organization is necessary. You need precise knowledge of the structure and management of the armed forces, weapons, ammunition and Besoldung.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, p. 45. Following Machiavelli, Patricius extensively criticized the use of foreign mercenaries, the disadvantages of which he emphasized. You can only rely on a force of citizens and volunteers. It is fatal to neglect one's armament and to give up the illusion that peace can be maintained through alliances, negotiations and payments instead of securing one's own clout. The belief that an enemy invasion can be stopped with fortresses is also completely wrong.Cesare Vasoli: \\"\\" Francesco Patricius da Cherso \\"\\", Rome 1989, pp. 246‚Äì251. Patricius emphasized the crucial role of the infantry, which is usually crucial. Only in three battles - including the Battle of Ravenna 1512 - did the use of artillery lead to the decision. In general, Patricius's military science statements are characterized by an underestimation of the artillery and the Arquebus n. Therefore, his Paralleli militari were outdated from a technical point of view as soon as they appeared. After all, he recognized the value of guns in naval battles and sieges.Alfredo Perifano: Penser la guerre au XVI e si√®cle: science, art ou pratique? In: Danielle Boillet, Marie -Fran√ßoise Pi√©jus (ed.): Les guerres d'Italie , Paris 2002, pp. 237‚Äì257, here: 245‚Äì248; Cesare Vasoli: Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1989, pp. 249 f. = Poetry Theory =  The determination of the object  With his poetry theory, Patricius distanced himself from traditional guidelines, both from ancient definitions and from the approaches developed in the Renaissance. Above all, he opposed Aristotle's poetics. His protest was directed against all conventional determinations of the nature and meaning of poetry, which impose formal or content-related limits on poetic work and thereby limit the poetic design possibilities. First and foremost, he opposed the ancient thesis, taken up by the influential contemporary Aristotle commentator Lodovico Castelvetro, that the task of the poet was to imitate natural or historical facts.For Lucerne's patriotic argument, see Luc Deitz: Patricius da Cherso on the Nature of Poetry. In: Luc Deitz u. a. (Ed.): Neo-Latin and the Humanities , Toronto 2014, pp. 179‚Äì205, here: 186‚Äì198; Baxter Hathaway: The Age of Criticism: The Late Renaissance in Italy , Ithaca 1962, pp. 9‚Äì17. Castelvetro claimed that poetry takes all of its light from history. He believed that poetry needed credibility and should therefore, at least in the main story, only represent relationships and events that were in harmony with natural processes and that could be imagined as historical facts. Patricius contrasted this with his concept of universal poetry, the subject matter of which encompasses the divine as well as the human and the natural. Any material can be the subject of poetic design if it is treated poetically. As a formal definition, he only accepted the verse form. The verse belongs to the essence of poetry and distinguishes it from prose. The Aristotelian definition of poetry by its alleged character as imitation is unusable, since Aristotle himself uses the term \\"imitation\\" in different meanings.Lina Bolzoni: La \\"Poetica\\" di Francesco Patricius da Cherso: il progetto di un modello universale della poesia. In: Giornale storico della letteratura italiana 151, 1974, pp. 357‚Äì382, here: 365‚Äì368, 371 f., 377‚Äì382; George Saintsbury: \\"A History of Criticism and Literary Taste in Europe\\", Vol. 2, 6th Edition, Edinburgh / London 1949, pp. 97-100; Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, pp. 590‚Äì592.  The peculiarity and function of poetry  A central concept of Patricius's poetics is the 'mirabile', the 'wonderful', that is, what arouses astonishment or admiration in the reader because it stands out from the mass of ordinary, uniform and self-evident phenomena. According to the understanding of the humanist philosopher, the mirabile is the defining characteristic of poetry, through which it is defined in terms of content. When determining the function of this wonderful thing, there is an analogy between the peculiarity and position of man in the cosmos and the specific nature and task of poetry in culture. According to an anthropological premise common in the Renaissance, man stands as a mediating and connecting entity between the world of the spiritual and that of the physical. This enables him to bring the spiritual into the physicalwear and also depict physical in the spiritual. It transfers from one area to another, transforming and transfiguring. For Patricius, this role of man in creation corresponds to the task of poetry in the field of \\"art\\" (arte) , human products: Poetry mediates in an analogous way between the purely spiritual and the material. The analogy thus established also extends to the factor that makes the mediating entity what it is. The peculiarity of man, which determines his nature and from which his special position results, is the spirit (mente) or reason. What the spirit is in relation to man is, according to Patricius's explicit statement, the mirable in poetry. Just as reason is the universal form of man, which constitutes him as man, so the wonderful is the specific quality that makes every poem such. This also results in an analogy in the order of rank of those who work: Just as the exercise of reason places man above all other animated beings, so the linguistic design of the mirabile elevates the poet above all others who write texts of any kind .Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, pp. 589‚Äì593. The determining factor is the mirable form principle of what it designs. His function is thus comparable to that of the soul in man. Just as the soul penetrates and shapes all parts of the body, the mirabile exerts its shaping power on the whole of a seal. We can only speak of poetry where the effective presence of the wonderful is palpable and gives the entire product the appropriate quality. Thus three aspects determine the poetic: firstly, the influence of its specific principle of form, secondly, the dignity that corresponds to the high rank of this creative principle, and thirdly, the universal presence of the principle of form in what it has shaped. This results in the need for the verse form, since according to Patricius's judgment it is the only linguistic form that is appropriate to the content quality made possible by the mirabile .Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophie des Humanismus und Renaissance (1350 ‚Äì1600) , vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, pp. 593 f. One of the common connotations of the miraculous in the Renaissance is that it not only arouses astonishment and admiration, but also enables knowledge by leading into the world of the new and amazing. According to Patricius's teaching in the field of poetry, this refers to a special being, an independent reality, which the poet created through his shaping (formazione) . The peculiarity of the mirabile in poetry for the humanist thinker is that it shows itself in a successful mixture (mescolanza) of the familiar and the unfamiliar. A poet may and should exceed the limits of what is allowed by the theoreticians, he should consciously disregard norms such as imitation of the natural and conformity with normal life experience and include the unusual and improbable. Since he has to present to the public both familiar and credible effects as well as new and incredible things, he has to mix opposites, and his mastery of this task shows his art. The poetic act takes place on the border of being and not being, of possible and real, of believable and unbelievable, but does not let this border exist, but gives the unbelievable the \\"face\\" of the believable and vice versa. The success of this mixing creates the mirabile in the product, which turns it into poetry.Thomas Leinkauf: Floor plan philosophy of humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, pp. 594-597. The universal conception of Patricius's poetics excludes narrowing the poetic productivity by one-sided standards. A preference for certain role models such as Homer or trends such as Petrarcism is therefore not an option.Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017 , P. 597. In Patricius's poetry, particular emphasis is placed on the requirement that the aim of poetry should not be to create affects, not to enchant and deceive, but to redirect the soul of the listener or reader through the insight conveyed to him.Thomas Leinkauf : Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, p. 559, note 801, p. 563. The mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar, the understood and the misunderstood should create a tension in the reader that drives him to do soto want to understand what is not understood. It should initiate a learning process. The role of the mirabile as the central principle of the action of poetry is therefore not an expression of a subjectivist aesthetic of Patricius or an orientation towards the irrational; rather, it results from the didactic concern of poetry to bring about a transition from ignorance to knowledge. This occurs through an impetus for reflection.Rainer Stillers: Humanistic Interpretation , D√ºsseldorf 1988, pp. 368-370. See Carolin Hennig: Francesco Patriciuss Della Poetica , Berlin 2016, pp. 138 f., 144‚Äì148. An important goal of Patricius's poetics is the defense of Theory of inspiration, according to which significant poets share in a Transcendent reality and their productivity is the fruit of divine inspiration. The inspiration is shown in the furore poetico , the ecstatic enthusiasm for poetic production that can only be explained as a result of the influence of a deity. Patricius's remarks are a response to Aristotelian Lodovico Castelvetro's fundamental criticism of enthusiasm. In Castelvetro's opinion, the furore poetico only exists in a naive popular belief, which is fueled by the poet's addiction to self- validation and self-mystification. Accordingly, it is a list of poets who claim to be inspired to gain prestige and hearing. In contrast, Patricius's plea stands for the authenticity of the emotion. It tries to invalidate the physiological reasoning of Aristotelians, according to which the \\"obsession\\" of what is seized by the \\"furore\\" can be interpreted as a symptom of a temperament.See Liane Nebes: The \\"furor poeticus\\" in Italian Renaissance platatonism, Marburg 2001, pp. 161-182. However, according to Patriciuss, the furore was only at work with authors of past ages, not in the Petrarchist poetry of his own time. The successful contemporary poems are not divinely inspired, but products of talent and artistry.Carolin Hennig: Francesco Patriciuss Della Poetica , Berlin 2016, pp. 172‚Äì174. = Love theory = Patricius also appeared in the field of love theory as an innovator, he announced a \\"new philosophy of love\\".John Charles Nelson (ed.): Francesco Patricius: L'amorosa filosofia, Florence 1963, p. 7. However, the core components of his concept were already known, were based on ancient ideas or had already been presented by other humanists. The teaching presented in Plato's dialogues Symposium and Phaidros served as the starting point. Like Plato, Patricius saw love as an inclination to the divine beauty, which gives the soul the \\"wings\\" with which it can rise to its transcendent home. It was a performance familiar to the educated audience. Two other theses of the humanist were less conventional: he claimed that love does not belong to the nature of man, but comes from outside as Accidents, and that all kinds of love are from love itself itself, the philautia . However, these ideas were not new either. They had been brought forward by Mario Equicola in the early 16th century, and Aristotle had already attributed love for others to self- love.Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol . 2, Hamburg 2017, pp. 1329 f., 1372-1375; Cesare Vasoli: \\"L'amorosa filosofia\\" di Francesco Patricius e la dissoluzione del mito platonico dell'amore. In: Davide Bigalli, Guido Canziani (ed.): Il dialogo filosofico nel '500 europeo' , Milan 1990, pp. 185-208, here: 198-203. At the time, however, this was a subversive concept, because the appreciation of love for oneself was unusual and offensive to large groups. It was particularly provocative that the Christian love of neighbor and love of God of the believer were also interpreted as variations of self-love. In the Platonic and Stoic as well as in the Christian tradition, self-love was considered suspect. The suspicion of a justification of selfishness or an Epicurean way of thinking was obvious. However, Patricius's thesis was not meant that way because he did not take self-love in the sense of selfish preference. Rather, he also referred to an aspect that compensates for self-reference: the enviousness of good that was already thematized by Plato. According to Platonic understanding, this inevitably causes the good altruistic to be communicated.Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 2, Hamburg 2017, Pp. 1373-1378. A real innovation was the insertion of sexuality into the old concept of the ascent of the lover driven by Eros. According to the conventional Platonic view, Patricius said that human love begins with the sight of physical beauty and then rises to the spiritual beauty of the loved one, and so one gradually moves towards divine love. In contrast to tradition, however, the humanist theorist assumed that the erotic then descended again over several levels to sensual love until he reached the bottom and last level, and that was the physical union. Patricius thus shifted the end point of the erotic movement from transcendence to sexuality.Sabrina Ebbersmeyer: Sensuality and Reason , Munich 2002, p. 231. Following the Platonic tradition, Patricius also assigned a metaphysical and cosmological dimension to love. He saw in it not only a phenomenon of the human world, but a real principle in the cosmos, which he believed to be inspired. On the cosmic level, according to his philosophy of love, the function of holding together the individual components of the world as a connecting force and ensuring the continuity of being exists. Accordingly, it is the foundation of the existence of all things. Their universal presence permeates all life in the universe. Here too, it is originally self-love, because God created creation out of love for himself, and he loves things because they are aspects of himself. So he loves himself in them. Accordingly, as an image of God, man also loves himself first. This is the prerequisite for his love for others and especially for God. According to this understanding, every human or divine love for others is a self- communication, which presupposes that the lover affirms his own being and his self-identity. Self-love understood in this way is a manifestation of unity as a self-reference. Then when the love of the individual turns to the outside world, his self-preservation efforts are extended there. In addition, self- love is the source and foundation of all human feelings, thoughts and actions, including religious ones. The background to this concept is Patricius's conviction that the being of all being is characterized by the basic structure of the self-relationship. In this context, he coined the Latin expression persentiscentia (\\"self-awareness\\"), with which he described the experience of staying with one another, the awareness of permanent self-identity.Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance ( 1350-1600) , vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, p. 180 f.

Reception  = Early Modern times = The title page of the edition of the Nova de universis philosophia printed in Venice, supposedly in 1593, but only after the church ban of 1594. After a long period of unsuccess, Patricius was finally able to gain respect in science, as the establishment of two chairs at important universities shows for him. His proposal to replace the Aristotelian program with a Platonic one in church educational institutions was not heard by Pope Clement VIII. The demise of the two chairs for Platonic philosophy tailored to him after his departure shows that his philosophy was considered out of date. The Roman chair was closed in 1600.Ugo Baldini: Philosophy at universities. In: Floor plan of the history of philosophy.

In: Christoph L√ºthy u. a. (Ed.): Late Medieval and Early Modern Corpuscular Matter Theories , Leiden 2001, pp. 133‚Äì161, here: p. 134 and note 10. Patricius's theory of nature and criticism of Aristotle were strongly received in the late 16th and 17th centuries, although his main work was on the index of forbidden books, from which it was only removed in 1900. Even in Italy, the ban on the Nova de universis philosophia could initially not be enforced across the board: a new edition with the wrong date 1593 appeared in Venice, pretending that it had already been printed before the ban in 1594. This issue was distributed in Protestant Northern and Central Europe, where at that time a Catholic condemnation acted as an advertisement.Paola Zambelli: Aneddoti patriziani.

Positive reception  Patricius's philosophy of nature was well received by anti- Aristotelian thinkers who liked to use his arguments. An early recipient was the English natural philosopher Nicholas Hill, who took up the ideas of the Italian humanist in his \\"Philosophia Epicurea\\" printed in 1601, without naming him.Sandra Plastina: \\"Philosophia lucis proles verissima est\\". Nicholas Hill lettore di Francesco Patricius. In: Bruniana & Campanelliana 10, 2004, pp. 175‚Äì182. Pierre Gassendi (1592‚Äì1655), who wrote a book against Aristotelianism wanted to write, gave up his project when he discovered the Nova de universis philosophia . Gassendi's concept of space clearly shows the influence of this work.John Henry: Francesco Patricius da Cherso's Concept of Space and its Later Influence. In: Annals of Science 36, 1979, pp. 549‚Äì 573, here: 567‚Äì569. Tommaso Campanella (1568‚Äì1639) positively received Patricius's theory of principles,Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 2, Hamburg 2017, p. 1666, note 801.

Pierre Bayle (1647‚Äì1706) appreciated the metaphysics and natural science of the Venetian philosopher. He considered him an important thinker and said that the Nova de universis philosophia reveals the very admirable depth of mind of its author.Pierre Bayle: Dictionnaire historique et critique , 11th edition, vol. 11 , Geneva 1969 (reprint), pp. 464 f., 469. Patricius's main work was also appreciated in the 17th century by the Cambridge Platonists n, especially by Henry More, who wrote the further developed the space concept presented there.John Henry: Francesco Patricius da Cherso's Concept of Space and its Later Influence. In: Annals of Science 36, 1979, pp. 549‚Äì573, here: 567‚Äì 572. The dialogues about history and its research met with a considerable response. A Latin translation, De legendae scribendaeque historiae ratione dialogi decem , appeared in Basel in 1570,See Susanna Gambino-Longo: La traduction latine des Dialoghi della Historia de Francesco Patricius da Cherso par Nicholas Stupan (1570 ) et la r√©ception europ√©enne de sa th√©orie de l'histoire. In: Ast√©rion 16, 2017 (online). one of English abstract, Thomas Blundeville, \`\` The true order and method of wryting and reading hystories , 1574 in London. Patricius's concept met with enthusiastic approval from the Italian emigrant living in England, Jacopo Aconcio, a friend of Blundeville. It was taken up by Paolo Beni and Tommaso Campanella in the early 17th century.See Giorgio Spini: I trattatisti dell'arte storica nella Controriforma italiana.

Critical voices  Defenders of Aristotelism like Teodoro Angelucci and Jacopo Mazzoni were among the contemporary opponents of the Venetian Platonist, but also Giordano Bruno, who, like Patricius, fought Aristotelism, but did not believe in the Discussiones peripateticae . He described this work as pedant manure and regretted that the author had stained so much paper with his effusions. Later, however, Bruno seems to have passed a milder judgment. He is said to have said that Patricius was an incredulous philosopher and still succeeded as the Pope's favorite in Rome.Laura Fedi: Patricius da Cherso Francesco. In: Michele Ciliberto (ed.): Giordano Bruno. Parole, concetti, immagini , Vol. 2, Pisa / Florenz 2014, pp. 1442-1445; Thomas S√∂ren Hoffmann: Philosophy in Italy , Wiesbaden 2007, p. 298. For the accusation of pedantism, see Kurt Flasch: Kampfplatz der Philosophie , Frankfurt 2008, p. 279 f. Judging very disparagingly Francis Bacon, a younger contemporary. He found that Patricius had recently made nonsensical and fantastic claims in a state of contempt.Francis Bacon: Descriptio globi intellectualis 7, ed. by James Spedding u. a .: The Works of Francis Bacon , Vol. 3, London 1876, pp. 747 f. Sharp criticism came from the astronomical side. Tycho Brahe complained in a letter to Johannes Kepler in December 1599 that his position in the Nova de universis philosophia was misrepresented. This is true; Patricius had criticized Brahe's view on the basis of an incorrect second-hand presentation, since his treatise on Comet of 1577 was not accessible to him. Kepler then violently attacked Patricius in his 1600/1601 Apologia pro Tychone contra Ursum , a defense document for Tycho. He accused him of not distinguishing between real and apparent movements. Kepler's criticism, however, was based on the fact that he had misunderstood Patricius's model.See Nicholas Jardine: The birth of history and philosophy of science , Cambridge 1984, pp. 98‚Äì100, 154‚Äì156, 234‚Äì 237; Paolo Rossi: La negazione delle sfere e l'astrobiologia di Francesco Patricius.

See Edward Rosen: \\"\\" Francesco Patricius and the Celestial Spheres. \\"\\" In: \\"\\" Physis \\"\\" 26, 1984, pp. 305-324. Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz also had an unfavorable opinion. He described Patricius as a man of considerable talent, but who had spoiled his mind by reading the writings of \\"pseudoplatonists\\". By this Leibniz meant above all the ancient Neoplatonists. The Venetian recognized defects in geometry, but was unable to fix them.Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz: Philosophische Schriften (Academy Edition), Vol. 4, Part A, Berlin 1999, p. 479 , 966. See Vincenzo De Risi: Francesco Patricius e la nuova geometria dello spazio. In: Delfina Giovannozzi, Marco Veneziani (ed.): Locus-Spatium , Florenz 2014, pp. 269‚Äì327 , here: 310 f., 320 f.  The philosopher as a dialogue figure  The writer Annibale Romei had Patricius appear as a dialogue figure in his Discorsi , which was completed in 1586. There the Venetian philosopher presents his cosmology and beauty theory and takes part in the dispute over honor, duel, nobility and wealth. On the seventh and last day of the dialogues, he discussed with the experienced courtier Giulio Cesare Brancaccio whether philosophy or military service should be given priority.Stefano Prandi: Il \\"Cortegiano\\" ferrarese , Florence 1990, p 87-112, 198, 203-210; Isabella Fedozzi: Il Barignano: Francesco Patricius ed il dibattito sull'onore nella cultura del Cinquecento. In: Patriciusa Castelli (ed.): Francesco Patricius, filosofo platonico nel crepuscolo del Rinascimento , Florence 2002, p 115‚Äì125, here: 125. = Modern = Statue Patricius in Cres, Croatia In the very rich modern research literature, Patricius is often recognized as an independent, innovative thinker and his performance is considered important. This refers to the philosophical and literary theoretical works, to the historical theory and philological competence of the humanist, but not to his mathematical ideas.Kurt Flasch: Kampfplatz der Philosophie , Frankfurt 2008, p. 276 f., 280; Paul Oskar Kristeller: Eight philosophers of the Italian Renaissance , Weinheim 1986, pp. 95, 98; Michael Stausberg: Fascination Zarathustra , Berlin 1998, Part 1, p. 292; Franz Lamprecht: The theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 43, 52; Eugenio Garin: Ritratti di umanisti , Florence 1967, p. 100. Hanna-Barbara Gerl describes him as an ingenious thinker of genuinely Renaissance philosophy who has the unconditional will to Represent the method and the uniform explanatory ground for everything real.Hanna-Barbara Gerl: Introduction to the philosophy of the Renaissance , 2nd edition, Darmstadt 1995, p. 142. After the judgment of Thomas Leinkauf he was the most important Platoniker of the early modern period after Marsilio Ficino.Thomas Leinkauf: Grundriss Philosophy of Humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , Vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, p. 1034. However, it is also pointed outthat his strength lay in criticizing the conventional, not in developing viable alternatives. In this sense, Benedetto Croce already expressed itself in 1903.Benedetto Croce: Problemi di estetica e contributi alla storia dell'estetica italiana , 6th edition, Bari 1966, p. 309 f. Judge similarly Arno Seifert: Cognitio historica , Berlin 1976, pp. 64 f. and Paul Richard Blum: Philosophizing in the Renaissance , Stuttgart 2004, p. 60. The natural philosophy model, above all the theory of space, receives attention and recognition. Thus, Ernst Cassirer in 1911 ruled that the Nova de universis philosophia , along with Telesio's main work De rerum natura , was the most important attempt at a uniform and independent explanation of nature in philosophy at the time. Paul Oskar Kristeller expressed a widespread opinion when he 1964 stated that there were good reasons to count Patricius among the natural philosophers who \\"paved the way for the new science and philosophy of the 17th century and modernity\\". As a thinker of a transition period, he tried to develop a systematic explanation of the physical universe in a new and original way. This is a mixture of science and speculation. His work represents a great attempt at system formation, but at the same time reveals a number of gaps and discrepancies.Paul Oskar Kristeller: Eight philosophers of the Italian Renaissance , Weinheim 1986, pp. 97, 107. See Thomas S√∂ren Hoffmann: Philosophy in Italy , Wiesbaden 2007, pp. 293, 304; Edward Grant: \\"Much ado about nothing\\", Cambridge 1981, pp. 199-201; August Buck: The reception of antiquity in the Romanesque literature of the Renaissance , Berlin 1976, p. 99. The poetry theory of the humanist is regarded as an exceptional achievement, whose special position in the extensive literature of Cinquecento on this subject is emphasized. Patricius's struggle against Aristotelian poetics is seen as an innovative, albeit little after-effect, impulse that could hardly have affected Aristotelian dominance in this area in the 17th and 18th centuries.Paul Oskar Kristeller: Eight philosophers of the Italian Renaissance , Weinheim 1986, pp. 98 f. George Saintsbury found in 1902 that as a literary critic Patricius was two centuries ahead of his time.George Saintsbury: A History of Criticism and Literary Taste in Europe , Vol. 2, New York 1902, p. 101. Rainer Stillers highlighted the highly developed methodological awareness in 1988, which is reflected in Patricius's careful consideration of tradition and his methodical progression from facts to theory show.Rainer Stillers: Humanistic Interpretation , D√ºsseldorf 1988, pp. 378‚Äì384. On the other hand, Bernard Weinberg, who raised the accusation of a lack of consistency in 1961, and the antiaristoteli rejected the argumentation as not valid.Bernard Weinberg: A History of Literary Criticism in the Italian Renaissance , Vol. 2, Chicago 1961, pp. 768 f., 772, 781. Cf. Weinberg's finding that Statement by Christiane Haberl: Di scienzia ritratto , Neuried 2001, p. 192. History theory is also highly valued.See the research overview at R√ºdiger Landfester: Historia magistra vitae , Geneva 1972, pp. 13‚Äì15. For example, Franz Lamprecht wrote in 1950 that Patricius was in the middle of an empty formalism, frozen mindset \\"preserves the pure basic idea of the humanistic world view\\". He was a main representative of the current, which \\"was looking for a way to a more comprehensive and scientifically based conception of history\\". In his concept, history has become science in the modern sense for the first time.Franz Lamprecht: On the theory of humanistic historiography , Zurich 1950, pp. 43, 52, 55. Similar comments were made on Patricius's pioneering role in the establishment of scientific history research u. a. Giorgio Spini (1948),Giorgio Spini: I trattatisti dell'arte storica nella Controriforma italiana.

Thomas Leinkauf (2017) said that Patricius had probably the most interesting and bold concept of history in the 16th Century.Thomas Leinkauf: Floor plan philosophy of humanism and the Renaissance (1350‚Äì1600) , vol. 1, Hamburg 2017, p. 1033. The diligence of the humanistic scholar, his thorough knowledge of the history of philosophy and his precise textual work are emphasized.Thomas Leinkauf: Cusanus, Ficino, Patricius - Forms of Platonic Thinking in the Renaissance , Berlin 2014, p. 351 f .; Kurt Flasch: Battlefields of Philosophy , Frankfurt 2008, p. 280; Giuseppe Saitta: Il pensiero italiano nell 'Umanesimo e nel Rinascimento , Vol. 2, 2nd edition, Florence 1961, p. 538; Friedrich Walkhoff: Francesco Patriciuss Leben und Werk , Bonn 1920, p. 25. However, criticism is given to the bias, which is sometimes regarded as fanatical, in his polemical efforts to refute and discredit Aristotle in all areas.Michael J. Wilmott: \\"Aristotle exotericus, acroamaticus, mysticus\\". In: Nouvelles de la R√©publique des Lettres 1985/1, pp. 67‚Äì95, here: p. 70 and Notes 13, 14. There is general agreement that Patricius's attempt to re-establish geometry was unsuccessful. From a mathematical-historical point of view, it is found that he actually found a weakness in Euclid Elements ', but that he was unable to fix it with his own approach.Jacomien Prins: Echoes of an Invisible World , Leiden 2015, pp. 258 f.

In : Jean-Claude Margolin (ed.): Platon et Aristote √† la Renaissance , Paris 1976, pp. 239‚Äì248. Even though some of the relevant assumptions were correct, his astronomical view of the world has also proved unsuitable. The reason for this failure is given in research as his purely philosophical approach to scientific problems.Matja≈æ Vesel: Franzesco Patricius, a Renaissance Philosopher and the Science of Astronomy.

Patricius's diverse impulses are answered differently to the question of the classification of intellectual history. Some researchers such as Cesare VasoliCesare Vasoli: Francesco Patricius da Cherso , Rome 1989, pp. 38 f. and Lina BolzoniLina Bolzoni: L'universo dei poemi possibili, Rome 1980, pp. 195 f. locate his ideas in the middle of the Cinquecento world of ideas.

You see him as an exponent of an epochal upheaval, a forerunner of the rationalistic discourse that subsequently strengthened and aimed at scientific precision.See Christiane Haberl's overview of research history: Di scienzia ritratto , Neuried 2001, p. 137 ‚Äì144. Carolin Hennig locates him in a zone of upheaval between Renaissance and Baroque and registers \\"proto-baroque tendencies\\".Carolin Hennig: Francesco Patriciuss Della Poetica , Berlin 2016, pp. 40 f.

He traveled to China, studying at Mount Zhongnan as a student of the influential Huayan master Zhiyan (Êô∫ÂÑº) and as a senior colleague of Fazang (Ê≥ïËóè), with whom he established a lifelong correspondence. He became an expert in Huayan (ËèØÂö¥) doctrine and was the founder of the Korean Hwaeom school. Most well-known among his writings is the Beopseongge or Hwaeom ilseung beopgye do (Diagram of the Avata·πÉsaka Single Vehicle DharmadhƒÅtu) (ËèØÂö¥‰∏Ä‰πòÊ≥ïÁïåÂúñ). This is a commentary on his mandala-like diagram haein do ('Ocean Seal'), which consists of 210 Chinese characters that express the essence of the Huayan doctrine. A full translation can be found in the appendix to Odin, 1982. Little is known of his early life other than his father was named Hin-sin and his family name was Kim. He is famous for his travel to T√°ng China with his friend, Wonhyo. At one point they were captured by border guards and held for ten days as suspected spies but were subsequently released and expelled. Late, Wonhyo left Uisang, after unknowingly drinking water from a skull in the dark. The shock of this brought about an enlightenment experience such that he felt it was unnecessary to continue to China in search of wisdom. Dismayed, but nonetheless determined, Uisang continued on his journey eventually reaching China by sea. A Korean folk story relates how, when he was young, Uisang fell in love with a beautiful girl, Myo Hwa (\\"Delicate Flower\\") but she was chosen by the king of Silla to be sent as a gift to the Chinese Emperor thus thwarting their relationship. This turned Uisang to the religious life and he became a monk. Myo Hwa in desperation tried to commit suicide on the journey in China by throwing herself in the river. However, she was rescued and nursed back to health by a family who subsequently adopted her. Many years later she met Uisang on his travels to China but he explained that he was now a monk and could not go back with her to Silla as she wished. However, he said he would visit her when his studies in China were complete. This he did ten years later. Unfortunately, Myo Hwa was not at home so Uisang left her a note and hurried to get his ship back to Silla. Myo Hwa returned and realized she had just missed him and ran down to the sea to try and catch him before he left. The ship however had already left the shore and in desperation she leapt in the water. As she hit the water she was magically transformed into a dragon by the strength of her love and she was able to follow the ship back to Silla. Safely arrived in Silla, Uisang went on to found Buseoksa, a temple in the Gyeongsangbuk-do (North Gyeongsang) mountains. The temple name means \\"Floating Rock\\" and is derived from an incident in which Myo Hwa, as a dragon, scares away some bandits by magically raising a boulder into the air. She is said to have transformed herself into a rock to continue protecting the site and her lover, Uisang. (Story related by Sunim, 1987). Uisang is often referred to as the \\"Temple Builder\\" because of the number of temples he established or extended during his lifetime.

Less than three months after his inauguration as the seventh vice president in March 1998, he succeeded Suharto who resigned after 31 years in office. His presidency is seen as a landmark and transition to the Reformation era. Upon becoming president, he liberalized Indonesia's press and political party laws, and held an early democratic election three years sooner than scheduled, which resulted in the end of his presidency. His 517-day presidency and 71-day vice presidency are the shortest in the country's history. Early life Habibie's monument in Gorontalo, 2018. Habibie was a native of Parepare, in South Sulawesi.

Habibie's father died when he was 14 years old. Studies and career in Europe Habibie went to Delft, the Netherlands, to study aviation and aerospace at the Technische Hogeschool Delft (Delft University of Technology), but for political reasons (the West New Guinea dispute between the Netherlands and Indonesia), he had to continue his study at the Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH Aachen University) in Aachen, Germany. In 1960, Habibie received an engineer's degree in Germany with the title Diplom-Ingenieur. He remained in Germany as a research assistant under Hans Ebner at the Lehrstuhl und Institut f√ºr Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to conduct research for his doctoral degree. In 1962, Habibie returned to Indonesia for three months on sick leave. During this time, he was reacquainted with Hasri Ainun, the daughter of R. Mohamad Besari. Habibie had known Hasri Ainun in childhood, junior high school and in senior high school at SMA Kristen Dago (Dago Christian Senior High School), Bandung. The two married on 12 May 1962, returning to Germany shortly afterwards. Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to Oberforstbach. In May 1963 they had a son, Ilham Akbar Habibie. Habibie later found employment with the railway stock firm Waggonfabrik Talbot, where he became an advisor in designing train wagons. Due to his work with Makosh, the head of train construction offered his position to Habibie upon retirement three years later, but Habibie refused the position. In 1965, Habibie delivered his dissertation in aerospace engineering and received the grade of \\"very good,\\" giving him the title Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.). The same year, he accepted Hans Ebner's offer to continue his research on Thermoelastisitas and work toward his Habilitation, but he declined the offer to join RWTH as a professor. His thesis about light construction for supersonic or hypersonic states also attracted offers of employment from companies such as Boeing and Airbus, which Habibie again declined. Habibie did accept a position with Messerschmitt-B√∂lkow-Blohm in Hamburg. There, he developed theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics known as the Habibie Factor, Habibie Theorem, and Habibie Method, respectively. He worked for Messerschmitt on the development of the Airbus A-300B aircraft. In 1974, he was promoted to vice president of the company. Career in Indonesia B. J. Habibie as the State Minister of Research and Technology In 1974, Suharto recruited Habibie to return to Indonesia as part of his drive to industrialize and develop the country. Habibie initially served as a special assistant to Ibnu Sutowo, chief executive officer of the state oil company Pertamina and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (, BPPT). Two years later, Habibie was made CEO of the new state-owned enterprise Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio (IPTN; Nurtanio Aircraft Industry), which in 1985 changed its name to Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (Nusantara Aircraft Industry; also abbreviated as IPTN) and is known as Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia) since 2000). In 1978, he was appointed as State Minister of Research and Technology (, Menristek). He continued to play an important role in IPTN other \\"strategic\\" industries in this post. By the 1980s, IPTN had grown considerably, specializing in the manufacture of helicopters and small passenger planes. Under Habibie's leadership, IPTN became a manufacturer of aircraft including Puma helicopters and CASA planes. It pioneered a small passenger airplane, the N-250 Gatotkaca, in 1995, but the project was a commercial failure. In developing Indonesia's aviation industry, he adopted an approach called \\"Begin at the End and End at the Beginning\\". In this method, elements such as basic research became the last things upon which to focus, whilst actual manufacturing of the planes was placed as the first objective. ABC news report of Suharto announcing he would retire in 1998, including an interview with Habibie, who declared no interest in becoming president. Habibie (center) campaigns for Golkar in 1997 By 1991, Habibie oversaw ten state-owned industries including ship- and train- building, steel, arms, communications, and energy. A 1993 estimate determined that the estimates used nearly $2 billion a year in state funding, although the government's opaque accounting practices meant that the size of the industries was not completely known. As minister, Habibie created the OFP (Overseas Fellowship Program), STMDP (Science Technology and Manpower Development Program) and STAID (Science and Technology for Industrial Development). These three programs provided scholarships to thousands of high school graduates to earn their bachelor's degrees in the STEM fields and for other technical professionals to continue their study for master's and doctorate program in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other countries. Habibie was, continuously, a member of six Indonesian cabinets for over 20 years. After his initial appointment in 1978, he served in another five cabinets (including the Development Reform Cabinet which, as president he formed after the resignation of Suharto in May 1998): * 1978‚Äì1983: State Minister of Research and Technology and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology in the Third Development Cabinet * 1983‚Äì1988: State Minister of Research and Technology and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology in the Fourth Development Cabinet * 1988‚Äì1993: State Minister of Research and Technology and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology in the Fifth Development Cabinet * 1993‚Äì1998: State Minister of Research and Technology and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology in the Sixth Development Cabinet * 1998: Vice president in the Seventh Development Cabinet * 1998‚Äì1999: President in the Development Reform Cabinet In Suharto's regime, as was expected of senior government executives, Habibie became a member of the Golkar organisation. Suharto appointed him as deputy daily coordinator for the chairman of the executive board in 1992, and the following year he became the daily coordinator. While serving in cabinet, Habibie was also elected as the first Chair of the Indonesian Association of Muslim Intellectuals (ICMI) in 1990. This modernist Muslim organization provided him with a political base, linked to but independent of the Suharto administration. Vice presidency BRI 2nd Class featured. In January 1998, after accepting nomination for a seventh term as President, Suharto announced the selection criteria for the nomination of a vice president. Suharto did not mention Habibie by name, but his suggestion that the next vice president should have a mastery of science and technology made it obvious he had Habibie in mind. In that year, in the midst of the Asian Financial Crisis, this suggestion was received badly, causing the rupiah to fall. Despite this, Habibie was elected as Vice President in March 1998. Presidency Habibie taking his presidential oath on 21 May 1998. On 21 May 1998, just two months into Habibie's vice presidency, Suharto announced his resignation. Habibie, as the Constitution says, succeeded him as president. The following day, Habibie announced the Development Reform Cabinet, which removed some of the most controversial ministers in Suharto's last cabinet while maintaining others - with no major figures from the opposition. Within days of his appointment, he asked his relatives to resign from government positions, promised an early election, repealed some legislation, and ordered the release of political prisoners. =East Timor= Habibie was opposed to East Timorese Independence but did offer East Timor special autonomy.Miller, M. (2004). 'From reform to repression: the post-New Order's shifting security policies in Aceh', Review of Indonesian and Malaysian Affairs, 38(4), 129‚Äì162. Timorese independence forces led by the National Council of Timorese Resistance had been calling for a referendum in the territory for some time. Its chief diplomat, Jose Ramos Horta, proposed a transitional period of autonomy leading up to a referendum. In late 1998, John Howard, the Prime Minister of Australia, sent a letter to Habibie suggesting that Indonesia defuse the East Timorese issue by providing autonomy to be followed by the promise of a referendum in the long run, following the method used by France to settle New Caledonian demands for independence. Wishing to avoid the impression that Indonesia ruled East Timor as a colony, Habibie surprised some by announcing that a referendum, offering a choice between special autonomy and independence, would be held immediately in East Timor. Leaders of the Indonesian armed forces (ABRI) were not consulted on this decision. On 30 August 1999, the referendum was held and the East Timorese people overwhelmingly chose Independence. Subsequently, pro-Indonesia militias killed and displaced large numbers of people during the 1999 East Timorese crisis. On 10 September, General Wiranto allegedly threatened to stage a military coup if Habibie allowed in peacekeeping forces, causing Habibie to back down. On 12 September, however, Habibie accepted a UN-mandated peacekeeping force to halt violence. A UN administration followed and East Timor became independent in 2002. =Suharto's corruption charge= The MPR Special Session in November 1998 decried the presence of corruption in Indonesia, focusing particularly on Suharto. In response to this, Habibie then appointed Andi Muhammad Ghalib as Attorney General. A tape of a telephone conversation between Habibie and Ghalib was made public. It raised concerns about the veracity of the investigation by suggesting that the interrogation of Suharto was intended only for public appearances. Under Habibie, the Indonesian government also began investigating and prosecuting Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra (commonly known as Tommy Suharto). Ghalib charged Tommy in December 1998 in conjunction with the Goro scandal, where the government, under pressure from Tommy, allegedly gave him a desirable parcel and below-market loan for the construction of a Goro supermarket. However, Tommy was found innocent in the case after several key witnesses, including Habibie aide Rahardi Ramelan, changed their testimony and declared that the deal did not cause losses to the state. Habibie's government stabilized the economy in the face of the Asian financial crisis and the chaos of the last few months of Suharto's presidency. Habibie's government began to make conciliatory gestures towards Chinese-Indonesians who, because of their elite status, were targeted in the riots of 1998. In September 1998, Habibie issued a 'Presidential Instruction' forbidding use of the terms pribumi and non- pribumi to differentiate indigenous and non-indigenous Indonesians. In May 1999, Habibie directed that an ID card was sufficient proof of Indonesian citizenship, revoking the previous requirement for a 'Letter of Evidence of Republic of Indonesia Citizenship' (SBKRI). Additionally, he lifted restrictions on the teaching of Mandarin Chinese. =Political reform= Under Habibie, Indonesia made significant changes to its political system that expanded competition and freedom of speech. Shortly after taking office, in June 1998, Habibie's government lifted the Suharto-era restriction on political parties and ended censorship by dissolving the Information Ministry. He also quickly committed to holding democratic elections, albeit on an initially vague timetable. In December, he proposed political reform laws that were passed by the legislature and MPR. These laws set elections for December 1999, reduced the number of seats in parliament held by the military, and barred political activity by civil servants. However, political opponents criticized Habibie for allowing the military to retain some seats in parliament, and taking little action on other military and judicial reforms. Habibie's government also passed laws which granted significant autonomy to regional governments, namely at the regency and city level. The laws resulted in indirect elections for mayors and regents, and allowed local legislatures to hold said executives accountable, though it was not implemented until after his presidency. =End of presidency= Although he had been viewed as leading a transitional government, Habibie seemed determined to continue as president. He was initially unclear about whether he would seek a full term as president when he announced parliamentary elections in June 1998. Habibie faced opposition from many within the government party, Golkar; in July 1998, he struggled to win control of Golkar by appointing Akbar Tandjung as chair of the party, but was ultimately able to defeat a rival camp including former Vice President Try Sutrisno, Defence Minister Edi Sudrajat, Siswono Yudhohusodo, and Sarwono Kusumaatmadja. Habibie began to lose support from Akbar Tandjung and a faction in Golkar, composed of both reformers and hardliners, that wanted to oust him. In March 1999, Golkar put forth five presidential nominees: Habibie, Tandjung, Wiranto, Hamengkubuwono X, and Ginandjar Kartasasmita. In May 1999, after extensive lobbying, Golkar announced that Habibie would be their presidential candidate, but a large faction in the party remained loyal to Tandjung and opposed to Habibie. His political credibility was tarnished by the exposure of the 1999 Bank Bali scandal, in which banking funds were funneled to members of Habibie's re- election team. At the 1999 MPR General Session in October, Habibie delivered an accountability speech. MPR members then began voting to decide if they would accept or reject his speech. Habibie attempted to win the support of the military by offering the vice-presidency to General Wiranto, but his offer was declined. Tandjung's Golkar faction broke ranks and voted against him, and his accountability speech was rejected by 355 votes to 322, and Habibie withdrew his nomination as President. He was succeeded by Abdurrahman Wahid. Post- presidency, final years and death State funeral procession of Habibie at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery in Jakarta, 12 September 2019 After relinquishing the presidency, Habibie spent more time in Germany than in Indonesia, though he was active during Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono's presidency as a presidential adviser. During this time, he established the Habibie Centre, an independent think tank. In September 2006, he released a book called Detik-Detik Yang Menentukan: Jalan Panjang Indonesia Menuju Demokrasi (Decisive Moments: Indonesia's Long Road Towards Democracy). The book recalled the events of May 1998 which led to his rise to the Presidency. In the book, he controversially accused Lieutenant General Prabowo Subianto, Suharto's son-in-law (at that time) and the Kostrad Commander, of planning a coup d'√©tat against him in May 1998. In early September 2019, he was admitted to Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, where he was undergoing treatments for heart problems, namely cardiomyopathy, and died on 11 September 2019. He became the first Indonesian President to be buried at the Kalibata Heroes Cemetery, next to his wife's grave. In response to his death, the Government of Indonesia announced a three-day national mourning period starting on 12 September, and announced that the Indonesian flag is to be flown at half-staff during the period. On 12 September 2019, video was released showing East Timor's former President, Xanana Gusm√£o, visiting Habibie in hospital on 22 July 2019. Gusm√£o is shown talking briefly to Habibie while crying, then kissing Habibie on the forehead and lowering his face to Habibie‚Äôs chest, with the other holding his head. A wreath in Gusm√£o‚Äôs name was at the funeral, with a sign reading: \\"Profound Condolences ‚Äì With heartfelt sympathy for the loss of Big Brother President B.J.

As travel  The Rihla travel practice originated in Middle Ages Morocco and served to connect Muslims of Morocco to the collective consciousness of the ummah across the Islamic world, thereby generating a larger sense of community. Rihla consists of three types: #Rihla - journey within Morocco, typically to meet with other pilgrims before traveling beyond the local area. #Rihla hijaziyya - journey to the Hejaz which would be transmitted via an oral or written report. #Rihla sifariyya - journey to foreign lands including to embassies and missions in territories in Dar al- Harb. Events on these journeys would be the basis of the extant travel literature.

Concerning Ibn Jubayr's voyage to Mecca in 1183, one writer claimed that \\"...his two-year journey made a considerable impact on literary history. His account of his travels and tribulations in the East served as the foundational work of a new genre of writing, the rihla, or the creative travelogue: a mix of personal narrative, description, opinion and anecdote. In following centuries, countless people emulated and even plagiarized him.\\"Grammatico, Daniel and Werner, Louis. 2015. The Travel Writer Ibn Jubayr. Aramco World. Volume 66, No. 1, January‚ÄìFebruary 2015. Page 40. It is important to note that travel narratives were written prior to Ibn Jubayr's; for example, the 12th century ri·∏•la of Abu Bakr ibn al-Arabi, and accounts of foreign lands visited by merchants and diplomats (such as the 9th century accounts of India and China by Abu Zayd al-Sirafi, and the 10th century ri·∏•la by Ibn Fadlan with the Abbasid mission to the Volga) long predate Ibn Jubayr's travelogue. The best known Rihla manuscript is \\"A Masterpiece to Those Who Contemplate the Wonders of Cities and the Marvels of Travelling\\" (, or ), often referred to as \\"The Travels of Ibn Battuta\\" (, or ). The Travels is a medieval book which recounts the journey of the 14th-century Moroccan scholar and traveler Ibn Battuta. The book was dictated to Ibn Juzayy on orders from the Marinid Sultan Abu Inan Faris who was impressed by the story and travels of Ibn Battuta. Although Ibn Battuta was an accomplished and well-documented explorer, his travels had been unknown outside the Islamic world for many years.

While his natural theories were later disproven, his emphasis on observation made him the \\"first of the moderns\\" who eventually developed the scientific method. Biography Telesio was born of noble parentage in Cosenza, a city in Calabria, Southern Italy. He was educated in Milan by his uncle, Antonio, himself a scholar and a poet of eminence, and afterwards in Rome and Padua. His studies included all the wide range of subjects, classics, science and philosophy, which constituted the curriculum of the Renaissance savants. Thus equipped, he began his attack upon the medieval Aristotelianism which then flourished in Padua and Bologna. In 1553 he married and settled in Cosenza, becoming the founder of the Cosentian Academy. From 1544 to 1550 and after 1565 he lived in the household of Alfonso III Carafa, Duke of Nocera.Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Telesio. In 1565 appeared his great work De Rerum Natura Iuxta Propria Principia (On the Nature of Things according to their Own Principles) and the complete edition of nine books was published in 1586. This was followed by a large number of scientific and philosophical works of subsidiary importance, added to bolster his major work. In 1552 Telesio married Diana Sersale, a widow with two children, with whom he had four children, the eldest of whom, Prospero, was mysteriously killed in 1576. After the death of his wife, Pope Pius IV offered him the Archbishopry of Cosenza, but Telesio refused in favor of his brother Tommaso. Bernardino spent the last years of his life in Cosenza where he took over the philosophical-scientific \\"Telesian\\" Academy that had been started by Aulo Giano Parrasio. He died in Cosenza in 1588, famous among scholars and his students, but opposed by the Church for the heterodox views which he maintained against the established Aristotelianism, and a short time after his death Pope Clement VIII put his books on the Index of prohibited books of 1596. Theory of matter, heat and cold Instead of postulating matter and form, he bases existence on matter and force. This force has two opposing elements: heat, which expands, and cold, which contracts. These two processes account for all the diverse forms and types of existence, while the mass on which the force operates remains the same. The harmony of the whole consists in this, that each separate thing develops in and for itself in accordance with its own nature while at the same time its motion benefits the rest. The obvious defects of this theory, (1) that the senses alone cannot apprehend matter itself, (2) that it is not clear how the multiplicity of phenomena could result from these two forces, though it is no less convincing than Aristotles hot/cold, dry/wet explanation, and (3) that he adduced no evidence to substantiate the existence of these two forces, were pointed out at the time by his pupil, Patrizzi. Moreover, his theory of the cold earth at rest and the hot sun in motion was doomed to disproof at the hands of Copernicus. At the same time, the theory was sufficiently coherent to make a great impression on Italian thought. It should be mentioned, though, that his obliteration of a distinction between superlunar and sublunar physics was certainly quite prescient though not acknowledged by his successors as particularly worthy of note. When Telesio went on to explain the relation of mind and matter, he was still more heterodox. Material forces are, by hypothesis, capable of feeling; matter also must have been from the first endowed with consciousness. For consciousness exists, and could not have been developed out of nothing. This leads him to a form of hylozoism. Again, the soul is influenced by material conditions; consequently the soul must have a material existence. He further held that all knowledge is sensation (\\"non- ratione sed sensu\\") and that intelligence is, therefore, an agglomeration of isolated data, given by the senses. He does not, however, succeed in explaining how the senses alone can perceive difference and identity. At the end of his scheme, probably in deference to theological prejudices, he added an element which was utterly alien, namely, a higher impulse, a soul superimposed by God, in virtue of which we strive beyond the world of sense. This divine soul is hardly a completely novel concept if viewed in the context of Averroestic or Thomasian perceptual theory. The whole system of Telesio shows gaps in his argument, and ignorance of essential facts, but at the same time it is a forerunner of all subsequent empiricism, scientific and philosophical, and marks clearly the period of transition from authority and reason to experiment and individual responsibility. Reliance on sensory data Statue of Bernardino Telesio in the Piazza XV marzo, Cosenza Telesio was the head of the great Southern Italian movement which protested against the accepted authority of abstract reason, and sowed the seeds from which sprang the scientific methods of Tommaso Campanella and Giordano Bruno, of Francis Bacon and Ren√© Descartes, with their widely divergent results. He, therefore, abandoned the purely intellectual sphere and proposed an inquiry into the data provided by the senses, from which he held that all true knowledge really comes (his theory of sense perception was essentially a reworking of Aristotle's theory from De Anima). Telesio writes in the beginning of the Proem of the first book of the third edition of De Rerum Natura Iuxta Propria Principia Libri Ix... \\"That the construction of the world and the magnitude of the bodies contained within it, and the nature of the world, is to be searched for not by reason as was done by the ancients, but is to be understood by means of observation.\\" (Mundi constructionem, corporumque in eo contentorum magnitudinem, naturamque non-ratione, quod antiquioribus factum est, inquirendam, sed sensu percipiendam.) This statement, found on the very first page, summarizes what many modern scholars have generally considered to be Telesian philosophy, and it often seems that many did not read any further for on the very next page he sets up his hot/cold theory of informed matter, a theory that is clearly not informed by our modern idea of observation. For Telesio, observation (sensu percipiendam) is a much larger mental process than simply recording data, observation also includes analogical thought. Though Francis Bacon is generally credited nowadays with the codification of an inductive method that wholeheartedly endorses observation as the primary procedure for acquiring knowledge, he was certainly not the first to suggest that sensory perception should be the primary source for knowledge. Among natural philosophers from the Renaissance, this honor is generally bestowed upon Telesio. Bacon himself acknowledges Telesio as being \\"the first of the moderns\\" (De Telesio autem bene sentimus, atque eum ut amantem veritatis, & Scientiis utilem, & nonnullorum Placitorum emendatorem & novorum hominum primum agnoscimus., from Bacon's De principiis atque originibus) for putting observation above all other methods for acquiring knowledge about the natural world. This frequently quoted phrase from Bacon, though, is misleading, for it oversimplifies and misrepresents Bacon's opinion of Telesio. Most of Bacon's essay is an attack on Telesio and this phrase, invariably taken out of context, has facilitated a general misconception of Telesian natural philosophy by giving to it a Baconian stamp of approval, which was far from Bacon's original intentions. Bacon sees in Telesio an ally in the fight against ancient authority, but he has little positive to say about Telesio's specific theories. What is perhaps most striking about De rerum natura is Telesio's attempt to mechanize as much as possible. Telesio clearly strives to explain everything in terms of matter informed by hot and cold and to keep his arguments as simple as possible. When his discussions turn to human beings he introduces an instinct of self-preservation to account for their motivations. And when he discusses the human mind and its ability to reason in the abstract about immaterial and divine topics, he adds a soul. For without a soul, all thought, by his reasoning, would be limited to material things. This would make God unthinkable and clearly this was not the case, for observation proves that people think about God.

The Huayan worldview is based primarily on the Avatamsaka Sutra (). The name Flower Garland is meant to suggest the crowning glory of a Buddha's profound understanding of ultimate reality. The Huayan School is known as Hwaeom in Korea, Kegon in Japan and Hoa Nghi√™m in Vietnam. This tradition also had a strong influence on Chan Buddhism. Origins and development Aerial view of Huayan temple, Datong =Origins= The earliest texts associated with the Avatamsaka sutra are the Dousha jing (Taisho 280), produced by Lokaksema in the latter part of the second century CE and the Pusa benye jing (T. 281), translated by Zhi Qian in the early to mid third century. There is evidence that these small Buddhavatamsaka sutras circulated on their own as individual scriptures.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 110. The translation of the large Avatamsaka sutra is often dated to the Southern Dynasties (420-589) when a translation team led by Gandharan master, Buddhabhadra worked on the sutra. There is also evidence of this sutra tradition in the Northern Dynasties (386-581) where a certain Xuangao (402-444) taught the Huayan samadhi.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 169. =Patriarchs= The founding of the school is traditionally attributed to a series of five \\"patriarchs\\" who were instrumental in developing the schools' doctrines. These five are: #Dushun (), responsible for the establishment of Huayan studies as a distinct field; #Zhiyan (), considered to have established the basic doctrines of the sect; #Fazang (), considered to have rationalized the doctrine for greater acceptance by society; #Chengguan (), together with Zongmi, are understood to have further developed and transformed the teachings #Guifeng Zongmi (), who is simultaneous a patriarch of the Chinese Ch√°n tradition and who also incorporated Taoist and Confucian teachings. The five monks later honored as Huayan patriarchs were erudite scholar-practitioners who connected Buddhism with Chinese traditional culture closely, creating a Buddhist historical trend in developing multiple facets while the tradition‚Äôs essence remained the same. Based on their writings, exegeses, and oral teachings, these men each played a significant and distinct role in the development of the school, although there are certain aspects of this patriarchal scheme which are clearly contrived. For example, Chengguan was born 26 years after Fazang's death. According to Robert Gimello's dissertation on Chih-Yen (1976), \\"most if not all of the major themes of Huayen thought\\" can be found in the works of the second patriarch Chih-yen, particularly the classification of scriptures and theories on the Dharmadhatu. Thus he names the patriarch Chih-yen (602-668) as the crucial figure in the foundation of Huayan.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 3. The tradition reached the height of its influence under Fazang, who was the Buddhist teacher of the Empress Wu Zetian (684‚Äì705). Another important figure in the development and popularization of Huayan thought was the lay scholar Li Tongxuan (, 635?-730), the author of the Hu√°y√°n l√πn (), a popular and lengthy commentary on the Avatamsaka sutra. Fazang's disciple Huiyuan (673-743) also wrote a commentary on the Avatamsaka.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page XV. Some accounts of the school also like to extend its patriarch-ship earlier to and NƒÅgƒÅrjuna. =Stagnation= After the time of Zongmi and Li Tongxuan the Chinese school of Huayan generally stagnated in terms of new development, and then eventually began to decline. The school, which had been dependent upon the support it received from the government, suffered severely during the Buddhist purge of 841-845, initiated by Emperor Wuzong of Tang, never to recover its former strength. Nonetheless, its profound metaphysics, such as that of the Four DharmadhƒÅtu () of interpenetration, had a deep impact on surviving East Asian schools. Texts Avatamsaka Sutra, vol. 12, frontispiece in gold and silver text on indigo blue paper, mid 14th century =Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra= The Huayan school's worldview was inspired on the content of what it considered to be the supreme Buddhist revelation, the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra (Flower Garland Sutra, Ch. HuƒÅy√°n Jƒ´ng). The Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra is a compilation of sutras of various length, which originally circulated as their own sutras before being combined.Williams, Paul, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, 2008, p. 132. The earliest of these texts, the Ten Stages Sutra, maybe dates from the first century CE. The Da≈õabh≈´mika S≈´tra describes the ten stages on the Bodhisattva-path. The various sutras were probably joined together shortly before its translation into Chinese, at the beginning of the 5th century CE.Gregory, Peter N. Tsung-Mi and the Sinification of Buddhism, University of Hawaii Press, 2002, p. 9. According to Williams, the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra is not a systematic philosophical work, but mentions various Mahayana teachings, including Madhyamaka ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ teachings, Yogacara ideas, as well as mentioning a pure untainted awareness or consciousness (amalacitta).Williams, Paul, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, 2008, p. 133. It is filled with mystical and visionary imagery, focusing on the Buddha Vairocana, who is said to pervade every atom of the entire universe with his magical creations and emanations as a way to help all beings:Williams, Paul, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, 2008, p. 136. An important doctrine that the Huayan school drew from this sutra is the idea that all levels of reality are interrelated and interpenetrated, the idea that \\"inside everything is everything else\\". The sutra states: > They . . . perceive that the fields full of assemblies, the beings and aeons > which are as many as all the dust particles, are all present in every > particle of dust. They perceive that the many fields and assemblies and the > beings and the aeons are all reflected in each particle of dust.Williams, > Paul, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, 2008, p. 136. In the Huayan school, this is depicted in the image of Indra's net. This \\"unity in totality allows every individual entity of the phenomenal world its uniqueness without attributing an inherent nature to anything\\". According to Williams, > As a description of the way things are in our unenlightened world this seems > incredible. But the dharmadhatu is the world as seen by the Buddha wherein > there is no question of the world (an objectively real world ‚Äòout there‚Äô) as > distinct from meditative vision. Thus the sutra is less concerned with > describing the world this way as with recounting the Bodhisattva‚Äôs > attainments by which he can see the world in such a light, and the > Bodhisattva‚Äôs miraculous powers by which, through his magical interventions > in this world with no fixed hard boundaries, he can cause things to > interpenetrate. =Other texts= Other Mahayana texts such as the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana (Dasheng Qixin Lun Â§ß‰πòËµ∑‰ø°Ë´ñ), which was a condensation of Chinese thought on awakening and ultimate reality, influenced Huayan masters like Fazang and Zongmi, who both wrote commentaries on the text. The Lotus sutra was also seen as an important text in this school, though not as important as the Avatamsaka. The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment was particularly important for Zongmi. The Huayen patriarchs wrote numerous commentaries and original treatises on the Mahayana sutras and Huayen philosophy. Fazang for example, wrote commentaries on the Avatamsaka, the Lankavatara Sutra and the Awakening of Faith.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 199. One of the key Huayen treatises is On the Meditation of the DharmadhƒÅtu attributed to the first patriarch Dushun. Another is Fazang‚Äôs Treatise on the Golden Lion which is said to have been written to explain Huayen's view of interpenetration to Empress Wu.Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 141. Peter N. Gregory notes that the Huayan commentarial tradition was: > \\"not primarily concerned with a careful exegesis of the original meaning of > the scripture. Rather, what it discovered in the text was the justification > for a number of ideas and metaphors in terms of which it elaborated its own > body of doctrine. Many of the key Huayan doctrines that were inspired by the > scripture (such as nature origination, the conditioned origination of the > dharmadhatu, the samadhi of oceanic reflection, or the six aspects of all > dharmas) played only a peripheral role in or had a tenuous connection with > the actual Huayan sutra itself. The great commentaries written on the text > by Fa-tsang and Ch'eng-kuan were not so much concerned with rendering a > faithful and judicious interpretation of the words of the text as they were > with using the text as a basis from which to advance a doctrinal agenda that > was determined by the context of Sui-Tang Buddhism.\\"Gregory, Peter N. Tsung- > Mi and the Sinification of Buddhism, University of Hawaii Press, 2002, p. > 9-10. Theory and practice A 3D rendering of Indra's net. Huayan thought is mainly focused on explaining the nature of the Dharmadhatu, the world as it is ultimately, from the point of view of a fully awakened being. It is often said to be the philosophical articulation of Chan meditation.Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 139. It is influenced by the Avatamsaka and Buddha nature literature as well as by the Chinese Yogacara and Madhyamaka schools. Patriarchs of the school such as Zongmi were also influenced by Chinese philosophy, particularly the classics of Taoism.Fox, Alan. The Practice of Huayan Buddhism, http://www.fgu.edu.tw/~cbs/pdf/2013%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E9%9B%86/q16.pdf =Interpenetration= A key doctrine of Huayan is the mutual containment and interpenetration of all phenomena (dharmas) or \\"perfect interfusion\\" (yuanrong, ÂúìËûç). This is associated with what the Huayan sees as its unique contribution, the \\"dharmadhatu pratityasamutpada\\". This is described by Wei Daoru as the idea that \\"countless dharmas (all phenomena in the world) are representations of the wisdom of Buddha without exception\\" and that \\"they exist in a state of mutual dependence, interfusion and balance without any contradiction or conflict. This thought essentially argues that there is no relationship of cause and result among phenomena and that things are not formed sequentially. Instead, they constitute the world by the mutual interfusion of complete equality.\\"Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189. According to this theory, any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality, its existence depends on the total network of all other things, which are all equally connected to each other and contained in each other.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189. The Huayan patriarchs used various metaphors to express this, such as Indra's net, a hall of mirrors and the world text. To illustrate the doctrine to Empress Wu, the patriarch Fazang: > \\"called for a candle and placed it surrounded by mirrors on every side. When > lit, the candle was reflected in each mirror, and each of the reflections in > every other mirror so that in any one mirror were the images of all the > others.\\"Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd > edition, 2009, page 140. This Buddhist doctrine also includes the views that:Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 190-93. *\\"Practicing one teaching is practicing all teachings\\" *Ending one mental defilement is ending all of them * Truth (or reality) is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating falsehood (or illusion), and vice versa * Good is understood as encompassing and interpenetrating evil * Similarly, all mind-made distinctions are understood as \\"collapsing\\" in the enlightened understanding of emptiness (a tradition traced back to the Buddhist philosopher Nagarjuna) =Li and Shi= Another important distinction used by Huayan patriarchs is that of li and shi, noumenon and phenomenon which was explained using the metaphor of gold and lions, or water and waves. According to Paul Williams: > First, noumenon and phenomena mutually interpenetrate and are (in a sense) > identical. There is no opposition between the two. The one does not cancel > out the other. Second, Fazang explains elsewhere that since all things arise > interdependently (following Madhyamika), and since the links of > interdependence expand throughout the entire universe and at all time (past, > present, and future depend upon each other, which is to say the total > dharmadhatu arises simultaneously), so in the totality of interdependence, > the dharmadhatu, all phenomena are mutually interpenetrating and > identical.Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd > edition, 2009, page 143. =Fourfold Dharmadhatu and meditation= The theory of the Fourfold Dharmadhatu (sifajie, ÂõõÊ≥ïÁïå) is explained in the \\"Meditative Perspectives on the Huayan Dharmadhatu\\" (Huayan Fajie Guanmen, ËèØÂö¥Ê≥ïÁïåËßÄÈñÄ) and its commentaries. This theory is the central meditative framework for the Huayan tradition. Another key text is the \\"Cessation and Contemplation in the Five Teachings of Huayan\\" (Huayan wujiao zhiguan ËèØÂö¥‰∫îÊïôÊ≠¢ËßÄ). The Dharmadhatu is the goal of the bodhisattva's practice, the ultimate nature of reality which must be known or entered into (ru, ÂÖ•). According to Fox, the Fourfold Dharmadhatu is \\"four cognitive approaches to the world, four ways of apprehending reality\\".The four ways of seeing reality are: # All dharmas are seen as particular separate events or phenomena (shi ‰∫ã). This is the mundane way of seeing. # All events are an expression of li (ÁêÜ, the absolute, principle or noumenon), which is associated with the concepts of shunyata, ‚ÄúOne Mind‚Äù (yi xin ‰∏ÄÂøÉ) and Buddha nature # Shi and Li interpenetrate (lishi wuai ÁêÜ‰∫ãÁÑ°Á§ô) # All events interpenetrate (shishi wuai ‰∫ã‰∫ãÁÑ°Á§ô), \\"all distinct phenomenal dharmas interfuse and penetrate in all ways\\" (Zongmi). The three levels of Huayan meditation on the Dharmadhatu correspond to the last three views of the Dharmadhatu are: #Meditation on ‚ÄúTrue Emptiness.‚Äù #Illuminating the non-obstruction of principle and phenomena. #Meditation on ‚Äúuniversal pervasion and complete accommodation.‚Äù According to Fox, \\"these dharmadhatus are not separate worlds ‚Äì they are actually increasingly more holographic perspectives on a single phenomenological manifold...they more properly represent four types or orders of perspectives on experience.\\" Furthermore, for Huayan, this practice is the solution to the problem of samsara which lies in the \\"fixation or attachment to a particular perspective. What we think are the essences of objects are really therefore nothing but mere names, mere functional designations, and none of these contextual definitions need necessarily interfere with any of the others.\\" =Other practices= According to Paul Williams, the reading and recitation of the Avatamsaka sutra was also a central practice for the tradition, for monks and laity.Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 145. Another practice which is highlighted in the Avatamsaka sutra is that of BuddhƒÅnusm·πõti or nianfo- mindfulness of the Buddha.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 224 The tradition also mentions two key samadhis, the ocean-seal samadhi (Ch. haiyin sanmei) and the huayan samadhi (huayan sanmei).Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 226-227 Layman Li Tongxuan developed a unique meditative practice based on the 9th chapter of the Avatamsaka sutra. The practice, named 'the contemplation of Buddhalight' (foguang guan), focused on tracing the universal light which is radiated by the Buddha in one's mind and expanding it further outwards.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 228. =Sudden enlightenment= Huayan favored the teaching of sudden enlightenment. This is because the Buddha nature is already present in all sentient beings and also because their theory of interpenetration entails that Buddhahood is already present at the first stage of a Bodhisattva's path.Williams, Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page 144. According to Li Tongxuan: > [T]he first access of faith in the mind of the practitioner is in itself the > culmination of the entire path, the very realization of final Buddhahood.... > ‚ÄòFaith‚Äô or confidence in the possibility of enlightenment is nothing but > enlightenment itself, in an anticipatory and causative modality.Williams, > Paul. Mahayana Buddhism the doctrinal foundations, 2nd edition, 2009, page > 144-45. Buddhahood was seen as beyond language and stages of practice. Because practices cannot create something that is already not imminent, they were seen as simply revealing what was already there. The patriarch Zongmi formulated his own theory of awakening which was \\"immediate awakening followed by gradual cultivation\\" and the view that \\"immediate and gradual are not only not contradictory, but are actually complementary\\". =Paradox= Huayan makes extensive use of paradox in argument and literary imagery. All three types of paradox originate in the tension between conventional and absolute truth. Huayan uses three types of paradox: 1\\\\. Emphasizing the concept of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ, first is asserted that a phenomenon X is empty, which implies that X is not X. An example from Fazang is the assertion: 2\\\\. Reversing the first paradox by asserting that any empty phenomenon is an expression of the absolute non- duality between emptiness and form, or the identity between conditioned, relative reality and the ultimate truth of tathatƒÅ. This paradox is derived from two doctrinal sources: * The Huayan concept of \\"true emptiness.\\" * The Huayan interpretation of the dialectic of the One Mind in the Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana. Fazang's paradoxical assertion illustrates this second type: 3\\\\. The third variation of paradox is grounded in the Huayan doctrine of the \\"nonobstruction of all phenomena\\" (shih shih wu-ai(k)). Each phenomenon is perceived as interpenetrating with and containing all others. This paradoxical violation of the conventional order of time and space is exemplified by Fa- tsang's famous \\"Essay on the Golden Lion\\": Classification of Buddhist teachings Buddhism was introduced into China in bits and pieces. When the knowledge of Buddhism grew larger, various schools attempted to get a grip on the Buddhist tradition by developing classifications of teachings, such as the Five Periods and Eight Teachings of the Tiantai-school. The Huayan school developed a fivefold classification: # The Hinayana-teachings, especially the Sarvastivadins # The Mahayana-teachings, including Yogacara, Madhyamaka # The \\"Final Teachings\\", based on the Tathagatagarbha-teachings, especially the Awakening of Faith # The Sudden Teaching, \\"which 'revealed' (hsien) rather than verbalised the teaching\\" # The Complete, or Perfect, Teachings of the Avatamsaka-sutra and the Huayan school. Huayan and Chan had doctrinal arguments regarding which would be the correct concept of sudden awakening. The teachings of the Ch√°n-school were regarded as inferior by the Huayan teachers. The Ch√°n-school polemitized against this classification, by devising its own rhetorics in defense. Influence The doctrines of the Huayan school ended up having profound impact on the philosophical attitudes of East Asian Buddhism. According to Wei Daoru their theory of perfect interfusion was \\"gradually accepted by all Buddhist traditions and it eventually permeated all aspects of Chinese Buddhism.\\"Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 189. Chinese Ch√°n was profoundly influenced by it, though Ch√°n also defined itself by distinguishing itself from Huayan. Tsung-mi, the Fifth Patriarch of the Huayan school, also occupies a prominent position in the history of Ch√°n. During the Song, the Huayan metaphysics were completely assimilated by the Ch√°n-school. References Sources Cleary, Thomas, trans. (1993).

The most common context is field emission from a solid surface into a vacuum. However, field emission can take place from solid or liquid surfaces, into a vacuum, a fluid (e.g. air), or any non-conducting or weakly conducting dielectric. The field-induced promotion of electrons from the valence to conduction band of semiconductors (the Zener effect) can also be regarded as a form of field emission. The terminology is historical because related phenomena of surface photoeffect, thermionic emission (or Richardson‚ÄìDushman effect) and \\"cold electronic emission\\", i.e. the emission of electrons in strong static (or quasi-static) electric fields, were discovered and studied independently from the 1880s to 1930s. When field emission is used without qualifiers it typically means \\"cold emission\\". Field emission in pure metals occurs in high electric fields: the gradients are typically higher than 1 gigavolt per metre and strongly dependent upon the work function. While electron sources based on field emission have a number of applications, field emission is most commonly an undesirable primary source of vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena, which engineers work to prevent. Examples of applications for surface field emission include the construction of bright electron sources for high-resolution electron microscopes or the discharge of induced charges from spacecraft. Devices which eliminate induced charges are termed charge- neutralizers. Field emission was explained by quantum tunneling of electrons in the late 1920s. This was one of the triumphs of the nascent quantum mechanics. The theory of field emission from bulk metals was proposed by Ralph H. Fowler and Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim. A family of approximate equations, Fowler‚ÄìNordheim equations, is named after them. Strictly, Fowler‚ÄìNordheim equations apply only to field emission from bulk metals and (with suitable modification) to other bulk crystalline solids, but they are often used ‚Äì as a rough approximation ‚Äì to describe field emission from other materials. Terminology and conventions Field electron emission, field-induced electron emission, field emission and electron field emission are general names for this experimental phenomenon and its theory. The first name is used here. Fowler‚ÄìNordheim tunneling is the wave-mechanical tunneling of electrons through a rounded triangular barrier created at the surface of an electron conductor by applying a very high electric field. Individual electrons can escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from many materials in various different circumstances. Cold field electron emission (CFE) is the name given to a particular statistical emission regime, in which the electrons in the emitter are initially in internal thermodynamic equilibrium, and in which most emitted electrons escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from electron states close to the emitter Fermi level. (By contrast, in the Schottky emission regime, most electrons escape over the top of a field-reduced barrier, from states well above the Fermi level.) Many solid and liquid materials can emit electrons in a CFE regime if an electric field of an appropriate size is applied. Fowler‚ÄìNordheim-type equations are a family of approximate equations derived to describe CFE from the internal electron states in bulk metals. The different members of the family represent different degrees of approximation to reality. Approximate equations are necessary because, for physically realistic models of the tunneling barrier, it is mathematically impossible in principle to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation exactly in any simple way. There is no theoretical reason to believe that Fowler-Nordheim-type equations validly describe field emission from materials other than bulk crystalline solids. For metals, the CFE regime extends to well above room temperature. There are other electron emission regimes (such as \\"thermal electron emission\\" and \\"Schottky emission\\") that require significant external heating of the emitter. There are also emission regimes where the internal electrons are not in thermodynamic equilibrium and the emission current is, partly or completely, determined by the supply of electrons to the emitting region. A non-equilibrium emission process of this kind may be called field (electron) emission if most of the electrons escape by tunneling, but strictly it is not CFE, and is not accurately described by a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation. Care is necessary because in some contexts (e.g. spacecraft engineering), the name \\"field emission\\" is applied to the field-induced emission of ions (field ion emission), rather than electrons, and because in some theoretical contexts \\"field emission\\" is used as a general name covering both field electron emission and field ion emission. Historically, the phenomenon of field electron emission has been known by a variety of names, including \\"the aeona effect\\", \\"autoelectronic emission\\", \\"cold emission\\", \\"cold cathode emission\\", \\"field emission\\", \\"field electron emission\\" and \\"electron field emission\\". Equations in this article are written using the International System of Quantities (ISQ). This is the modern (post-1970s) international system, based around the rationalized-meter-kilogram-second (rmks) system of equations, which is used to define SI units. Older field emission literature (and papers that directly copy equations from old literature) often write some equations using an older equation system that does not use the quantity Œµ0. In this article, all such equations have been converted to modern international form. For clarity, this should always be done. Since work function is normally given in electronvolts (eV), and it is often convenient to measure fields in volts per nanometer (V/nm), values of most universal constants are given here in units involving the eV, V and nm. Increasingly, this is normal practice in field emission research. However, all equations here are ISQ-compatible equations and remain dimensionally consistent, as is required by the modern international system. To indicate their status, numerical values of universal constants are given to seven significant figures. Values are derived using the 2006 values of the fundamental constants. Early history of field electron emission Field electron emission has a long, complicated and messy history. This section covers the early history, up to the derivation of the original Fowler‚ÄìNordheim-type equation in 1928. In retrospect, it seems likely that the electrical discharges reported by Winkler in 1744 were started by CFE from his wire electrode. However, meaningful investigations had to wait until after J.J. Thomson's identification of the electron in 1897, and until after it was understood ‚Äì from thermal emission and photo-emission work ‚Äì that electrons could be emitted from inside metals (rather than from surface-adsorbed gas molecules), and that ‚Äì in the absence of applied fields ‚Äì electrons escaping from metals had to overcome a work function barrier. It was suspected at least as early as 1913 that field-induced emission was a separate physical effect. However, only after vacuum and specimen cleaning techniques had significantly improved, did this become well established. Lilienfeld (who was primarily interested in electron sources for medical X-ray applications) published in 1922 the first clear account in English of the experimental phenomenology of the effect he had called \\"autoelectronic emission\\". He had worked on this topic, in Leipzig, since about 1910. Kleint describes this and other early work. After 1922, experimental interest increased, particularly in the groups led by Millikan at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, California, and by Gossling at the General Electric Company in London. Attempts to understand autoelectronic emission included plotting experimental current‚Äìvoltage (i‚ÄìV) data in different ways, to look for a straight-line relationship. Current increased with voltage more rapidly than linearly, but plots of type log(i) vs. V were not straight. Schottky suggested in 1923 that the effect might be due to thermally induced emission over a field-reduced barrier. If so, then plots of log(i) vs. should be straight, but they were not. Nor is Schottky's explanation compatible with the experimental observation of only very weak temperature dependence in CFE ‚Äì a point initially overlooked. A breakthrough came when Lauritsen (and Oppenheimer independently) found that plots of log(i) vs. 1/V yielded good straight lines. This result, published by Millikan and Lauritsen in early 1928, was known to Fowler and Nordheim. Oppenheimer had predicted that the field-induced tunneling of electrons from atoms (the effect now called field ionization) would have this i(V) dependence, had found this dependence in the published experimental field emission results of Millikan and Eyring, and proposed that CFE was due to field-induced tunneling of electrons from atomic-like orbitals in surface metal atoms. An alternative Fowler‚ÄìNordheim theory explained both the Millikan-Lauritsen finding and the very weak dependence of current on temperature. Fowler‚ÄìNordheim theory predicted both to be consequences if CFE were due to field-induced tunneling from free-electron-type states in what we would now call a metal conduction band, with the electron states occupied in accordance with Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics. Oppenheimer had mathematical details of his theory seriously incorrect. There was also a small numerical error in the final equation given by Fowler‚ÄìNordheim theory for CFE current density: this was corrected in the 1929 paper of . Strictly, if the barrier field in Fowler-Nordheim 1928 theory is exactly proportional to the applied voltage, and if the emission area is independent of voltage, then the Fowler-Nordheim 1928 theory predicts that plots of the form (log(i/V2) vs. 1/V) should be exact straight lines. However, contemporary experimental techniques were not good enough to distinguish between the Fowler-Nordheim theoretical result and the Millikan-Lauritsen experimental result. Thus, by 1928 basic physical understanding of the origin of CFE from bulk metals had been achieved, and the original Fowler-Nordheim-type equation had been derived. The literature often presents Fowler-Nordheim work as a proof of the existence of electron tunneling, as predicted by wave-mechanics. Whilst this is correct, the validity of wave-mechanics was largely accepted by 1928. The more important role of the Fowler-Nordheim paper was that it was a convincing argument from experiment that Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics applied to the behavior of electrons in metals, as suggested by Sommerfeld in 1927. The success of Fowler‚ÄìNordheim theory did much to support the correctness of Sommerfeld's ideas, and greatly helped to establish modern electron band theory. In particular, the original Fowler-Nordheim-type equation was one of the first to incorporate the statistical-mechanical consequences of the existence of electron spin into the theory of an experimental condensed-matter effect. The Fowler-Nordheim paper also established the physical basis for a unified treatment of field-induced and thermally induced electron emission. Prior to 1928 it had been hypothesized that two types of electrons, \\"thermions\\" and \\"conduction electrons\\", existed in metals, and that thermally emitted electron currents were due to the emission of thermions, but that field-emitted currents were due to the emission of conduction electrons. The Fowler-Nordheim 1928 work suggested that thermions did not need to exist as a separate class of internal electrons: electrons could come from a single band occupied in accordance with Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics, but would be emitted in statistically different ways under different conditions of temperature and applied field. The ideas of Oppenheimer, Fowler and Nordheim were also an important stimulus to the development, by Gamow,Z. Physik 51, 204 (1928) G. Gamow, \\"Zur Quantentheorie des Atomkernes\\". and Gurney and Condon, later in 1928, of the theory of the radioactive decay of nuclei (by alpha particle tunneling). Practical applications: past and present =Field electron microscopy and related basics= As already indicated, the early experimental work on field electron emission (1910‚Äì1920) was driven by Lilienfeld's desire to develop miniaturized X-ray tubes for medical applications. However, it was too early for this technology to succeed. After Fowler-Nordheim theoretical work in 1928, a major advance came with the development in 1937 by Erwin W. Mueller of the spherical-geometry field electron microscope (FEM) (also called the \\"field emission microscope\\"). In this instrument, the electron emitter is a sharply pointed wire, of apex radius r. This is placed, in a vacuum enclosure, opposite an image detector (originally a phosphor screen), at a distance R from it. The microscope screen shows a projection image of the distribution of current-density J across the emitter apex, with magnification approximately (R/r), typically 105 to 106. In FEM studies the apex radius is typically 100 nm to 1 Œºm. The tip of the pointed wire, when referred to as a physical object, has been called a \\"field emitter\\", a \\"tip\\", or (recently) a \\"Mueller emitter\\". When the emitter surface is clean, this FEM image is characteristic of: (a) the material from which the emitter is made: (b) the orientation of the material relative to the needle/wire axis; and (c) to some extent, the shape of the emitter endform. In the FEM image, dark areas correspond to regions where the local work function œÜ is relatively high and/or the local barrier field F is relatively low, so J is relatively low; the light areas correspond to regions where œÜ is relatively low and/or F is relatively high, so J is relatively high. This is as predicted by the exponent of Fowler- Nordheim-type equations [see eq. (30) below]. The adsorption of layers of gas atoms (such as oxygen) onto the emitter surface, or part of it, can create surface electric dipoles that change the local work function of this part of the surface. This affects the FEM image; also, the change of work-function can be measured using a Fowler-Nordheim plot (see below). Thus, the FEM became an early observational tool of surface science. For example, in the 1960s, FEM results contributed significantly to discussions on heterogeneous catalysis.\\"The role of the adsorbed state in heterogeneous catalysis\\", Discuss. Faraday Soc., Vol. 41 (1966) FEM has also been used for studies of surface-atom diffusion. However, FEM has now been almost completely superseded by newer surface-science techniques. A consequence of FEM development, and subsequent experimentation, was that it became possible to identify (from FEM image inspection) when an emitter was \\"clean\\", and hence exhibiting its clean- surface work-function as established by other techniques. This was important in experiments designed to test the validity of the standard Fowler-Nordheim- type equation. These experiments deduced a value of voltage-to-barrier-field conversion factor Œ≤ from a Fowler-Nordheim plot (see below), assuming the clean-surface œÜ‚Äìvalue for tungsten, and compared this with values derived from electron-microscope observations of emitter shape and electrostatic modeling. Agreement to within about 10% was achieved. Only very recently has it been possible to do the comparison the other way round, by bringing a well-prepared probe so close to a well-prepared surface that approximate parallel-plate geometry can be assumed and the conversion factor can be taken as 1/W, where W is the measured probe-to emitter separation. Analysis of the resulting Fowler- Nordheim plot yields a work-function value close to the independently known work-function of the emitter. =Field electron spectroscopy (electron energy analysis)= Energy distribution measurements of field-emitted electrons were first reported in 1939. In 1959 it was realized theoretically by Young, and confirmed experimentally by Young and Mueller that the quantity measured in spherical geometry was the distribution of the total energy of the emitted electron (its \\"total energy distribution\\"). This is because, in spherical geometry, the electrons move in such a fashion that angular momentum about a point in the emitter is very nearly conserved. Hence any kinetic energy that, at emission, is in a direction parallel to the emitter surface gets converted into energy associated with the radial direction of motion. So what gets measured in an energy analyzer is the total energy at emission. With the development of sensitive electron energy analyzers in the 1960s, it became possible to measure fine details of the total energy distribution. These reflect fine details of the surface physics, and the technique of Field Electron Spectroscopy flourished for a while, before being superseded by newer surface-science techniques. =Field electron emitters as electron-gun sources= To achieve high-resolution in electron microscopes and other electron beam instruments (such as those used for electron beam lithography), it is helpful to start with an electron source that is small, optically bright and stable. Sources based on the geometry of a Mueller emitter qualify well on the first two criteria. The first electron microscope (EM) observation of an individual atom was made by Crewe, Wall and Langmore in 1970, using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an early field emission gun. From the 1950s onwards, extensive effort has been devoted to the development of field emission sources for use in electron guns.L.W. Swanson and A.E. Bell, Adv. Electron. Electron Phys. 32 (1973) 193 [e.g., DD53] Methods have been developed for generating on-axis beams, either by field-induced emitter build- up, or by selective deposition of a low-work-function adsorbate (usually Zirconium oxide - ZrO) into the flat apex of a (100) oriented Tungsten emitter. Sources that operate at room temperature have the disadvantage that they rapidly become covered with adsorbate molecules that arrive from the vacuum system walls, and the emitter has to be cleaned from time to time by \\"flashing\\" to high temperature. Nowadays, it is more common to use Mueller- emitter-based sources that are operated at elevated temperatures, either in the Schottky emission regime or in the so-called temperature-field intermediate regime. Many modern high-resolution electron microscopes and electron beam instruments use some form of Mueller-emitter-based electron source. Currently, attempts are being made to develop carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as electron-gun field emission sources. The use of field emission sources in electron optical instruments has involved the development of appropriate theories of charged particle optics, and the development of related modeling. Various shape models have been tried for Mueller emitters; the best seems to be the \\"Sphere on Orthogonal Cone\\" (SOC) model introduced by Dyke, Trolan. Dolan and Barnes in 1953. Important simulations, involving trajectory tracing using the SOC emitter model, were made by Wiesener and Everhart. Nowadays, the facility to simulate field emission from Mueller emitters is often incorporated into the commercial electron-optics programmes used to design electron beam instruments. The design of efficient modern field-emission electron guns requires highly specialized expertise. =Atomically sharp emitters= Nowadays it is possible to prepare very sharp emitters, including emitters that end in a single atom. In this case, electron emission comes from an area about twice the crystallographic size of a single atom. This was demonstrated by comparing FEM and field ion microscope (FIM) images of the emitter. Single-atom-apex Mueller emitters also have relevance to the scanning probe microscopy and helium scanning ion microscopy (He SIM). Techniques for preparing them have been under investigation for many years. A related important recent advance has been the development (for use in the He SIM) of an automated technique for restoring a three-atom (\\"trimer\\") apex to its original state, if the trimer breaks up. =Large-area field emission sources: vacuum nanoelectronics= Materials aspects Large-area field emission sources have been of interest since the 1970s. In these devices, a high density of individual field emission sites is created on a substrate (originally silicon). This research area became known, first as \\"vacuum microelectronics\\", now as \\"vacuum nanoelectronics\\". One of the original two device types, the \\"Spindt array\\", used silicon-integrated-circuit (IC) fabrication techniques to make regular arrays in which molybdenum cones were deposited in small cylindrical voids in an oxide film, with the void covered by a counterelectrode with a central circular aperture. This overall geometry has also been used with carbon nanotubes grown in the void. The other original device type was the \\"Latham emitter\\". These were MIMIV (metal-insulator-metal- insulator-vacuum) ‚Äì or, more generally, CDCDV (conductor-dielectric-conductor- dielectric-vacuum) ‚Äì devices that contained conducting particulates in a dielectric film. The device field-emits because its microstructure/nanostructure has field-enhancing properties. This material had a potential production advantage, in that it could be deposited as an \\"ink\\", so IC fabrication techniques were not needed. However, in practice, uniformly reliable devices proved difficult to fabricate. Research advanced to look for other materials that could be deposited/grown as thin films with suitable field-enhancing properties. In a parallel-plate arrangement, the \\"macroscopic\\" field FM between the plates is given by FM = V/W, where W is the plate separation and V is the applied voltage. If a sharp object is created on one plate, then the local field F at its apex is greater than FM and can be related to FM by : F = \\\\gamma F_{\\\\mathrm{M}}. The parameter Œ≥ is called the \\"field enhancement factor\\" and is basically determined by the object's shape. Since field emission characteristics are determined by the local field F, then the higher the Œ≥-value of the object, then the lower the value of FM at which significant emission occurs. Hence, for a given value of W, the lower the applied voltage V at which significant emission occurs. For a roughly ten year-period from the mid-1990s, there was great interest in field emission from plasma-deposited films of amorphous and \\"diamond-like\\" carbon. However, interest subsequently lessened, partly due to the arrival of CNT emitters, and partly because evidence emerged that the emission sites might be associated with particulate carbon objects created in an unknown way during the deposition process: this suggested that quality control of an industrial-scale production process might be problematic. The introduction of CNT field emitters, both in \\"mat\\" form and in \\"grown array\\" forms, was a significant step forward. Extensive research has been undertaken into both their physical characteristics and possible technological applications. For field emission, an advantage of CNTs is that, due to their shape, with its high aspect ratio, they are \\"natural field-enhancing objects\\". In recent years there has also been massive growth in interest in the development of other forms of thin-film emitter, both those based on other carbon forms (such as \\"carbon nanowalls \\") and on various forms of wide-band-gap semiconductor. A particular aim is to develop \\"high-Œ≥\\" nanostructures with a sufficiently high density of individual emission sites. Thin films of nanotubes in form of nanotube webs are also used for development of field emission electrodes,. It is shown that by fine-tuning the fabrication parameters, these webs can achieve an optimum density of individual emission sites Double-layered electrodes made by deposition of two layers of these webs with perpendicular alignment towards each other are shown to be able to lower the turn-on electric field (electric field required for achieving an emission current of 10 ŒºA/cm2) down to 0.3 V/Œºm and provide a stable field emission performance. Common problems with all field emission devices, particularly those that operate in \\"industrial vacuum conditions\\" is that the emission performance can be degraded by the adsorption of gas atoms arriving from elsewhere in the system, and the emitter shape can be in principle be modified deleteriously by a variety of unwanted subsidiary processes, such as bombardment by ions created by the impact of emitted electrons onto gas-phase atoms and/or onto the surface of counter-electrodes. Thus, an important industrial requirement is \\"robustness in poor vacuum conditions\\"; this needs to be taken into account in research on new emitter materials. At the time of writing, the most promising forms of large-area field emission source (certainly in terms of achieved average emission current density) seem to be Spindt arrays and the various forms of source based on CNTs. Applications The development of large-area field emission sources was originally driven by the wish to create new, more efficient, forms of electronic information display. These are known as \\"field emission displays\\" or \\"nano-emissive displays\\". Although several prototypes have been demonstrated, the development of such displays into reliable commercial products has been hindered by a variety of industrial production problems not directly related to the source characteristics [En08]. Other proposed applications of large-area field emission sources include microwave generation, space-vehicle neutralization, X-ray generation, and (for array sources) multiple e-beam lithography. There are also recent attempts to develop large-area emitters on flexible substrates, in line with wider trends towards \\"plastic electronics\\". The development of such applications is the mission of vacuum nanoelectronics. However, field emitters work best in conditions of good ultrahigh vacuum. Their most successful applications to date (FEM, FES and EM guns) have occurred in these conditions. The sad fact remains that field emitters and industrial vacuum conditions do not go well together, and the related problems of reliably ensuring good \\"vacuum robustness\\" of field emission sources used in such conditions still await better solutions (probably cleverer materials solutions) than we currently have. =Vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena= As already indicated, it is now thought that the earliest manifestations of field electron emission were the electrical discharges it caused. After Fowler- Nordheim work, it was understood that CFE was one of the possible primary underlying causes of vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena. (The detailed mechanisms and pathways involved can be very complicated, and there is no single universal cause) Where vacuum breakdown is known to be caused by electron emission from a cathode, then the original thinking was that the mechanism was CFE from small conducting needle-like surface protrusions. Procedures were (and are) used to round and smooth the surfaces of electrodes that might generate unwanted field electron emission currents. However the work of Latham and others showed that emission could also be associated with the presence of semiconducting inclusions in smooth surfaces. The physics of how the emission is generated is still not fully understood, but suspicion exists that so-called \\"triple-junction effects\\" may be involved. Further information may be found in Latham's book and in the on-line bibliography. =Internal electron transfer in electronic devices= In some electronic devices, electron transfer from one material to another, or (in the case of sloping bands) from one band to another (\\"Zener tunneling\\"), takes place by a field-induced tunneling process that can be regarded as a form of Fowler- Nordheim tunneling. For example, Rhoderick's book discusses the theory relevant to metal-semiconductor contacts. Fowler‚ÄìNordheim tunneling =Introduction= The next part of this article deals with the basic theory of cold field electron emission from bulk metals. This is best treated in four main stages, involving theory associated with: (1) derivation of a formula for \\"escape probability\\", by considering electron tunneling through a rounded triangular barrier; (2) an integration over internal electron states to obtain the \\"total energy distribution\\"; (3) a second integration, to obtain the emission current density as a function of local barrier field and local work function; (4) conversion of this to a formula for current as a function of applied voltage. The modified equations needed for large-area emitters, and issues of experimental data analysis, are dealt with separately. Fowler‚ÄìNordheim tunneling is the wave-mechanical tunneling of an electron through an exact or rounded triangular barrier. Two basic situations are recognized: (1) when the electron is initially in a localized state; (2) when the electron is initially not strongly localized, and is best represented by a travelling wave. Emission from a bulk metal conduction band is a situation of the second type, and discussion here relates to this case. It is also assumed that the barrier is one-dimensional (i.e., has no lateral structure), and has no fine-scale structure that causes \\"scattering\\" or \\"resonance\\" effects. To keep this explanation of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling relatively simple, these assumptions are needed; but the atomic structure of matter is in effect being disregarded. =Motive energy= For an electron, the one-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation can be written in the form :\\\\frac{\\\\hbar^2}{2 m} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}^2 \\\\Psi(x)}{\\\\mathrm{d}x^2} = \\\\left[U(x)-E_{\\\\mathrm{n}}\\\\right]\\\\Psi(x) = M(x)\\\\Psi(x), \\\\qquad \\\\qquad (1) where Œ®(x) is the electron wave-function, expressed as a function of distance x measured from the emitter's electrical surface, ƒß is the reduced Planck constant, m is the electron mass, U(x) is the electron potential energy, En is the total electron energy associated with motion in the x-direction, and M(x) is called the electron motive energy. M(x) can be interpreted as the negative of the electron kinetic energy associated with the motion of a hypothetical classical point electron in the x-direction, and is positive in the barrier. The shape of a tunneling barrier is determined by how M(x) varies with position in the region where M(x) > 0\\\\. Two models have special status in field emission theory: the exact triangular (ET) barrier and the Schottky- Nordheim (SN) barrier. These are given by equations (2) and (3), respectively: :M^{\\\\mathrm{ET}}(x) = h - eFx \\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\qquad\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; (2) :M^{\\\\rm{SN}}(x) = h - eFx -e^2/(16\\\\pi\\\\varepsilon_0 x), \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (3) Here h is the zero-field height (or unreduced height) of the barrier, e is the elementary positive charge, F is the barrier field, and Œµ0 is the electric constant. By convention, F is taken as positive, even though the classical electrostatic field would be negative. The SN equation uses the classical image potential energy to represent the physical effect \\"correlation and exchange\\". =Escape probability= For an electron approaching a given barrier from the inside, the probability of escape (or \\"transmission coefficient\\" or \\"penetration coefficient\\") is a function of h and F, and is denoted by D(h,F). The primary aim of tunneling theory is to calculate D(h,F). For physically realistic barrier models, such as the Schottky-Nordheim barrier, the Schr√∂dinger equation cannot be solved exactly in any simple way. The following so-called \\"semi-classical\\" approach can be used. A parameter G(h,F) can be defined by the JWKB (Jeffreys-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin) integral: :G(h, F) = g\\\\int M^{1/2}\\\\mbox{d}x, \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (4) where the integral is taken across the barrier (i.e., across the region where M > 0), and the parameter g is a universal constant given by : g \\\\,= 2\\\\sqrt{2m}/\\\\hbar \\\\approx 10.24624 \\\\; {\\\\rm{eV}}^{-1/2}\\\\; {\\\\rm{nm}}^{-1}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (5) Forbes has re-arranged a result proved by Fr√∂man and Fr√∂man, to show that, formally ‚Äì in a one-dimensional treatment ‚Äì the exact solution for D can be written :\\\\,D = \\\\frac{P\\\\mathrm{e}^{-G}}{1 + P\\\\mathrm{e}^{-G}}, \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (6) where the tunneling pre-factor P can in principle be evaluated by complicated iterative integrations along a path in complex space.H. Fr√∂man and P.O. Fr√∂man, \\"JWKB approximation: contributions to the theory\\" (North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1965). In the CFE regime we have (by definition) G ‚â´ 1\\\\. Also, for simple models P ‚âà 1\\\\. So eq. (6) reduces to the so-called simple JWKB formula: :D\\\\approx P \\\\mathrm{e}^{-G} \\\\approx \\\\mathrm{e}^{-G}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (7) For the exact triangular barrier, putting eq. (2) into eq. (4) yields , where : b = \\\\frac{2g}{3e} = \\\\frac{4\\\\sqrt{2 m}}{3e\\\\hbar} \\\\approx 6.830890 \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{eV}}^{-3/2} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{V} \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{nm}}^{-1}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (8) This parameter b is a universal constant sometimes called the second Fowler- Nordheim constant. For barriers of other shapes, we write :G(h, F) = u(h, F) G^{\\\\mathrm{ET}} = u(h, F)b h^{3/2}/F, \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (9) where ŒΩ(h,F) is a correction factor that in general has to be determined by numerical integration, using eq. (4). =Correction factor for the Schottky‚ÄìNordheim barrier= enhanced thermionic emission). The Schottky-Nordheim barrier, which is the barrier model used in deriving the standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, is a special case. In this case, it is known that the correction factor \\\\it{ u} is a function of a single variable fh, defined by fh = F/Fh, where Fh is the field necessary to reduce the height of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier from h to 0. This field is given by : \\\\, F_h = (4\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0/e^3) h^2 = (0.6944617 \\\\; \\\\mathrm{V}\\\\; {\\\\mathrm{nm}}^{-1})(h/{\\\\rm{eV}})^2. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (10) The parameter fh runs from 0 to 1, and may be called the scaled barrier field, for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of zero-field height h. For the Schottky-Nordheim barrier, ŒΩ(h,F) is given by the particular value ŒΩ(fh) of a function ŒΩ(‚Ñì‚Ä≤). The latter is a function of mathematical physics in its own right and has been called the principal Schottky-Nordheim barrier function. An explicit series expansion for ŒΩ(‚Ñì‚Ä≤) is derived in a 2008 paper by J. Deane. The following good simple approximation for ŒΩ(fh) has been found: :v(f_h) \\\\approx 1 - f_h + \\\\tfrac{1}{6} f_h\\\\ln f_h...........\\\\rm{(11)} =Decay width= The decay width (in energy), dh, measures how fast the escape probability D decreases as the barrier height h increases; dh is defined by: :\\\\frac{1}{d_h} = -\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}(\\\\ln D)}{\\\\mathrm{d}h}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (12) When h increases by dh then the escape probability D decreases by a factor close to e ( ‚âà 2.718282). For an elementary model, based on the exact triangular barrier, where we put ŒΩ = 1 and P ‚âà 1, we get :d_h^{\\\\mathrm{(el)}} = \\\\frac{2F}{3b\\\\sqrt{h}} = \\\\frac{e F}{g \\\\sqrt{h}}. The decay width dh derived from the more general expression (12) differs from this by a \\"decay-width correction factor\\" Œªd, so: :d_h= \\\\lambda_d d_h^{\\\\mathrm{(el)}} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_d e F}{g \\\\sqrt{h}}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (13) Usually, the correction factor can be approximated as unity. The decay-width dF for a barrier with h equal to the local work-function œÜ is of special interest. Numerically this is given by: : d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}= \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_d e F}{g \\\\sqrt{\\\\phi}} \\\\approx \\\\frac{e F}{g \\\\sqrt{\\\\phi}} \\\\approx 0.09759678 \\\\; \\\\mathrm{eV} \\\\, \\\\cdot \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1\\\\ \\\\mathrm{eV}}{\\\\phi}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{F}{1\\\\ \\\\mathrm{V}\\\\ \\\\mathrm{nm}^{-1}}. \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (14) For metals, the value of dF is typically of order 0.2 eV, but varies with barrier-field F. =Comments= A historical note is necessary. The idea that the Schottky-Nordheim barrier needed a correction factor, as in eq. (9), was introduced by Nordheim in 1928, but his mathematical analysis of the factor was incorrect. A new (correct) function was introduced by Burgess, Kroemer and Houston in 1953, and its mathematics was developed further by Murphy and Good in 1956. This corrected function, sometimes known as a \\"special field emission elliptic function\\", was expressed as a function of a mathematical variable y known as the \\"Nordheim parameter\\". Only recently (2006 to 2008) has it been realized that, mathematically, it is much better to use the variable ‚Ñì‚Ä≤ . And only recently has it been possible to complete the definition of ŒΩ(‚Ñì‚Ä≤) by developing and proving the validity of an exact series expansion for this function (by starting from known special-case solutions of the Gauss hypergeometric differential equation). Also, approximation (11) has been found only recently. Approximation (11) outperforms, and will presumably eventually displace, all older approximations of equivalent complexity. These recent developments, and their implications, will probably have a significant impact on field emission research in due course. The following summary brings these results together. For tunneling well below the top of a well-behaved barrier of reasonable height, the escape probability D(h,F) is given formally by: :D(h, F) \\\\approx P\\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{ u(h, F) bh^{3/2}}{F}\\\\right], \\\\qquad\\\\qquad (15) where ŒΩ(h,F) is a correction factor that in general has to be found by numerical integration. For the special case of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier, an analytical result exists and ŒΩ(h,F) is given by ŒΩ(fh), as discussed above; approximation (11) for ŒΩ(fh) is more than sufficient for all technological purposes. The pre-factor P is also in principle a function of h and (maybe) F, but for the simple physical models discussed here it is usually satisfactory to make the approximation P = 1\\\\. The exact triangular barrier is a special case where the Schr√∂dinger equation can be solved exactly, as was done by Fowler and Nordheim; for this physically unrealistic case, ŒΩ(fh) = 1, and an analytical approximation for P exists. The approach described here was originally developed to describe Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from smooth, classically flat, planar emitting surfaces. It is adequate for smooth, classical curved surfaces of radii down to about 10 to 20 nm. It can be adapted to surfaces of sharper radius, but quantities such as ŒΩ and D then become significant functions of the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature. When the emitter is so sharp that atomic-level detail cannot be neglected, and/or the tunneling barrier is thicker than the emitter-apex dimensions, then a more sophisticated approach is desirable. As noted at the beginning, the effects of the atomic structure of materials are disregarded in the relatively simple treatments of field electron emission discussed here. Taking atomic structure properly into account is a very difficult problem, and only limited progress has been made. However, it seems probable that the main influences on the theory of Fowler-Nordheim tunneling will (in effect) be to change the values of P and ŒΩ in eq. (15), by amounts that cannot easily be estimated at present. All these remarks apply in principle to Fowler Nordheim tunneling from any conductor where (before tunneling) the electrons may be treated as in travelling-wave states. The approach may be adapted to apply (approximately) to situations where the electrons are initially in localized states at or very close inside the emitting surface, but this is beyond the scope of this article. Total-energy distribution The energy distribution of the emitted electrons is important both for scientific experiments that use the emitted electron energy distribution to probe aspects of the emitter surface physics and for the field emission sources used in electron beam instruments such as electron microscopes. In the latter case, the \\"width\\" (in energy) of the distribution influences how finely the beam can be focused. The theoretical explanation here follows the approach of Forbes. If Œµ denotes the total electron energy relative to the emitter Fermi level, and Kp denotes the kinetic energy of the electron parallel to the emitter surface, then the electron's normal energy Œµn (sometimes called its \\"forwards energy\\") is defined by : \\\\; \\\\epsilon_{\\\\mathrm{n}} = \\\\epsilon - K_{\\\\mathrm{p}}...........(16) . Two types of theoretical energy distribution are recognized: the normal-energy distribution (NED), which shows how the energy Œµn is distributed immediately after emission (i.e., immediately outside the tunneling barrier); and the total-energy distribution, which shows how the total energy Œµ is distributed. When the emitter Fermi level is used as the reference zero level, both Œµ and Œµn can be either positive or negative. Energy analysis experiments have been made on field emitters since the 1930s. However, only in the late 1950s was it realized (by Young and Mueller [,YM58]) that these experiments always measured the total energy distribution, which is now usually denoted by j(Œµ). This is also true (or nearly true) when the emission comes from a small field enhancing protrusion on an otherwise flat surface. To see how the total energy distribution can be calculated within the framework of a Sommerfeld free-electron-type model, look at the P-T energy- space diagram (P-T=\\"parallel-total\\"). P-T energy-space diagram, showing the region in P-T energy space where traveling-wave electron states exist. This shows the \\"parallel kinetic energy\\" Kp on the horizontal axis and the total energy Œµ on the vertical axis. An electron inside the bulk metal usually has values of Kp and Œµ that lie within the lightly shaded area. It can be shown that each element dŒµdKp of this energy space makes a contribution z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}} \\\\mathrm{d}{\\\\it{\\\\epsilon}} \\\\mathrm{d} K_{\\\\mathrm{p}} to the electron current density incident on the inside of the emitter boundary. Here, zS is the universal constant (called here the Sommerfeld supply density): :z_{\\\\mathrm{S}}=4\\\\mathrm{\\\\pi}em / h_{\\\\mathrm{P}}^3 = 1.618311 \\\\times 10^{14} \\\\, \\\\rm{A} \\\\, m^{-2} \\\\, eV^{-2}, ...........(17) and f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}} is the Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution function: : \\\\, f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}} (\\\\epsilon) = 1/[1+\\\\mathrm{exp}(\\\\epsilon / k_{\\\\mathrm{B}}T)],...........(18) where T is thermodynamic temperature and kB is Boltzmann's constant. This element of incident current density sees a barrier of height h given by: : \\\\, h=\\\\phi - \\\\epsilon + K_{\\\\mathrm{p}}...........(19a) The corresponding escape probability is D(h,F): this may be expanded (approximately) in the form : D(h,F) \\\\approx D_{\\\\mathrm{F}} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{exp}(\\\\epsilon / d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}) \\\\; \\\\mathrm{exp}(-K_{\\\\mathrm{p}} / d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}) .......... (19b), where DF is the escape probability for a barrier of unreduced height equal to the local work-function œÜ. Hence, the element dŒµdKp makes a contribution z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}} D \\\\mathrm{d} {\\\\it{\\\\epsilon}} \\\\mathrm{d} K_{\\\\mathrm{p}} to the emission current density, and the total contribution made by incident electrons with energies in the elementary range dŒµ is thus : j(\\\\epsilon) \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\epsilon = z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}} \\\\left[ \\\\int D \\\\mathrm{d} K_{\\\\mathrm{p}} \\\\right] \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\epsilon = z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}} D_{\\\\mathrm{F}} \\\\mathrm{exp}(\\\\epsilon / d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}) \\\\left[ \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\mathrm{exp}(-K_{\\\\mathrm{p}} / d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}) \\\\; \\\\mathrm{d} K_{\\\\mathrm{p}} \\\\right] \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\epsilon...........(20) , where the integral is in principle taken along the strip shown in the diagram, but can in practice be extended to ‚àû when the decay-width dF is very much less than the Fermi energy KF (which is always the case for a metal). The outcome of the integration can be written: : \\\\, j(\\\\epsilon) = z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} d_{\\\\mathrm{F}} D_{\\\\mathrm{F}} f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}}(\\\\epsilon) \\\\mathrm{exp}(\\\\epsilon/d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}) = j_{\\\\mathrm{F}} f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}}(\\\\epsilon) \\\\mathrm{exp} (\\\\epsilon / d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}), ...........(21) where d_{\\\\mathrm{F}} and D_{\\\\mathrm{F}} are values appropriate to a barrier of unreduced height h equal to the local work function œÜ, and j_{\\\\mathrm{F}} [ \\\\,= z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} d_{\\\\mathrm{F}} D_{\\\\mathrm{F}} ] is defined by this equation. For a given emitter, with a given field applied to it, j_{\\\\mathrm{F}} is independent of F, so eq. (21) shows that the shape of the distribution (as Œµ increases from a negative value well below the Fermi level) is a rising exponential, multiplied by the FD distribution function. This generates the familiar distribution shape first predicted by Young. At low temperatures, f_{\\\\mathrm{FD}} (\\\\epsilon) goes sharply from 1 to 0 in the vicinity of the Fermi level, and the FWHM of the distribution is given by: : \\\\mathrm{FWHM} \\\\, = d_{\\\\mathrm{F}} \\\\mathrm{ln} (2) \\\\approx 0.693 \\\\, d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}. ..........(22) The fact that experimental CFE total energy distributions have this basic shape is a good experimental confirmation that electrons in metals obey Fermi‚ÄìDirac statistics. Cold field electron emission =Fowler‚ÄìNordheim-type equations= Introduction Fowler‚ÄìNordheim-type equations, in the J-F form, are (approximate) theoretical equations derived to describe the local current density J emitted from the internal electron states in the conduction band of a bulk metal. The emission current density (ECD) J for some small uniform region of an emitting surface is usually expressed as a function J(œÜ,F) of the local work-function œÜ and the local barrier field F that characterize the small region. For sharply curved surfaces, J may also depend on the parameter(s) used to describe the surface curvature. Owing to the physical assumptions made in the original derivation, the term Fowler-Nordheim-type equation has long been used only for equations that describe the ECD at zero temperature. However, it is better to allow this name to include the slightly modified equations (discussed below) that are valid for finite temperatures within the CFE emission regime. Zero-temperature form Current density is best measured in A/m2. The total current density emitted from a small uniform region can be obtained by integrating the total energy distribution j(Œµ) with respect to total electron energy Œµ. At zero temperature, the Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution function fFD = 1 for Œµ<0, and fFD = 0 for Œµ>0. So the ECD at 0 K, J0, is given from eq. (18) by : J_0 = z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} d_{\\\\mathrm{F}} D_{\\\\mathrm{F}} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{0} \\\\mathrm{exp}(\\\\epsilon / d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}) \\\\; \\\\mathrm{d} \\\\epsilon \\\\; = \\\\; z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} {d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}}^2 D_{\\\\mathrm{F}} \\\\; = \\\\; Z_{\\\\mathrm{F}} D_{\\\\mathrm{F}}, ..........(23) where Z_{\\\\mathrm{F}} \\\\; [=z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} {d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}}^2] is the effective supply for state F, and is defined by this equation. Strictly, the lower limit of the integral should be ‚ÄìKF, where KF is the Fermi energy; but if dF is very much less than KF (which is always the case for a metal) then no significant contribution to the integral comes from energies below KF, and it can formally be extended to ‚Äì‚àû. Result (23) can be given a simple and useful physical interpretation by referring to Fig. 1. The electron state at point \\"F\\" on the diagram (\\"state F\\") is the \\"forwards moving state at the Fermi level\\" (i.e., it describes a Fermi-level electron moving normal to and towards the emitter surface). At 0 K, an electron in this state sees a barrier of unreduced height œÜ, and has an escape probability DF that is higher than that for any other occupied electron state. So it is convenient to write J0 as ZFDF, where the \\"effective supply\\" ZF is the current density that would have to be carried by state F inside the metal if all of the emission came out of state F. In practice, the current density mainly comes out of a group of states close in energy to state F, most of which lie within the heavily shaded area in the energy-space diagram. Since, for a free-electron model, the contribution to the current density is directly proportional to the area in energy space (with the Sommerfeld supply density zS as the constant of proportionality), it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from electron states in an area of size dF2 (measured in eV2) in the energy-space diagram. That is, it is useful to think of the ECD as drawn from states in the heavily shaded area in Fig. 1. (This approximation gets slowly worse as temperature increases.) ZF can also be written in the form: : Z_{\\\\mathrm{F}} =z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} {d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}}^2= {\\\\lambda_d}^2 (z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} e^2 g^{-2}) \\\\phi^{-1} F^2 = {\\\\lambda_d}^2 a \\\\phi^{-1} F^2, ..........(24) where the universal constant a, sometimes called the First Fowler‚ÄìNordheim Constant, is given by : a = z_{\\\\mathrm{S}} e^2 g^{-2} = e^3 /8 \\\\pi h_{\\\\mathrm{P}} \\\\approx \\\\; 1.541434 \\\\times 10^{-6} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{A \\\\; eV} \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{V}}^{-2}. ..........(25) This shows clearly that the pre-exponential factor a œÜ‚àí1F2, that appears in Fowler-Nordheim-type equations, relates to the effective supply of electrons to the emitter surface, in a free-electron model. Non- zero temperatures To obtain a result valid for non-zero temperature, we note from eq. (23) that zSdFDF = J0/dF. So when eq. (21) is integrated at non- zero temperature, then ‚Äì on making this substitution, and inserting the explicit form of the Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution function ‚Äì the ECD J can be written in the form: : J=J_0 \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{exp}(\\\\epsilon / d_{\\\\mathrm{F}})}{1 + \\\\mathrm{exp} [(\\\\epsilon/d_{\\\\mathrm{F}})(d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}/k_{\\\\mathrm{B}} T)]} \\\\mathrm{d}(\\\\epsilon/ d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}) = \\\\lambda_T J_0 ,..........(26) where ŒªT is a temperature correction factor given by the integral. The integral can be transformed, by writing w = d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}/k_{\\\\mathrm{B}}T and x=\\\\epsilon/d_{\\\\mathrm{F}} , and then u = \\\\mathrm{exp}(x) , into the standard result: see formula 3.241 (2), with Œº=1 : \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{ {\\\\mathrm{e}}^x } { 1+ {\\\\mathrm{e}}^{wx} } \\\\mathrm{d}x = \\\\int_{0}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}u}{1+u^w} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi} {w\\\\mathrm{sin}(\\\\pi/w)}. ..........(27) This is valid for w>1 (i.e., dF/kBT > 1). Hence ‚Äì for temperatures such that kBTF: : \\\\lambda_T = \\\\frac{\\\\pi k_{\\\\mathrm{B}} T/d_{\\\\mathrm{F}} }{ \\\\mathrm{sin}(\\\\pi k_{\\\\mathrm{B}} T / d_{\\\\mathrm{F}})} \\\\approx 1 + \\\\frac{1}{6} {\\\\frac{\\\\pi k_{\\\\mathrm{B}} T}{ d_{\\\\mathrm{F}}}}^2, ..........(28) where the expansion is valid only if (œÄkBT /dF) << 1\\\\. An example value (for œÜ= 4.5 eV, F= 5 V/nm, T= 300 K) is ŒªT= 1.024. Normal thinking has been that, in the CFE regime, ŒªT is always small in comparison with other uncertainties, and that it is usually unnecessary to explicitly include it in formulae for the current density at room temperature. The emission regimes for metals are, in practice, defined, by the ranges of barrier field F and temperature T for which a given family of emission equations is mathematically adequate. When the barrier field F is high enough for the CFE regime to be operating for metal emission at 0 K, then the condition kBTF provides a formal upper bound (in temperature) to the CFE emission regime. However, it has been argued that (due to approximations made elsewhere in the derivation) the condition kBT<0.7dF is a better working limit: this corresponds to a ŒªT-value of around 1.09, and (for the example case) an upper temperature limit on the CFE regime of around 1770 K. This limit is a function of barrier field. Note that result (28) here applies for a barrier of any shape (though dF will be different for different barriers). Physically complete Fowler‚ÄìNordheim-type equation Result (23) also leads to some understanding of what happens when atomic-level effects are taken into account, and the band-structure is no longer free- electron like. Due to the presence of the atomic ion-cores, the surface barrier, and also the electron wave-functions at the surface, will be different. This will affect the values of the correction factor u, the prefactor P, and (to a limited extent) the correction factor Œªd. These changes will, in turn, affect the values of the parameter DF and (to a limited extent) the parameter dF. For a real metal, the supply density will vary with position in energy space, and the value at point \\"F\\" may be different from the Sommerfeld supply density. We can take account of this effect by introducing an electronic-band-structure correction factor ŒªB into eq. (23). Modinos has discussed how this factor might be calculated: he estimates that it is most likely to be between 0.1 and 1; it might lie outside these limits but is most unlikely to lie outside the range 0.01<ŒªB<10. By defining an overall supply correction factor ŒªZ equal to ŒªT ŒªB Œªd2, and combining equations above, we reach the so-called physically complete Fowler-Nordheim-type equation: : J \\\\;= \\\\lambda_Z a \\\\phi^{-1} F^2 P_{\\\\mathrm{F}} \\\\mathrm{exp}[- u_{\\\\mathrm{F}} b \\\\phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(29) where { u}_{\\\\mathrm{F}} [={ u}_{\\\\mathrm{F}}(œÜ,F)] is the exponent correction factor for a barrier of unreduced height œÜ. This is the most general equation of the Fowler‚ÄìNordheim type. Other equations in the family are obtained by substituting specific expressions for the three correction factors { u}_{\\\\mathrm{F}}, PF and ŒªZ it contains. The so-called elementary Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, that appears in undergraduate textbook discussions of field emission, is obtained by putting ŒªZ‚Üí1, PF‚Üí1, { u}_{\\\\mathrm{F}}‚Üí1; this does not yield good quantitative predictions because it makes the barrier stronger than it is in physical reality. The so-called standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, originally developed by Murphy and Good, and much used in past literature, is obtained by putting ŒªZ‚ÜítF‚àí2, PF‚Üí1, { u}_{\\\\mathrm{F}}‚ÜívF, where vF is v(f), where f is the value of fh obtained by putting h=œÜ, and tF is a related parameter (of value close to unity). Within the more complete theory described here, the factor tF‚àí2 is a component part of the correction factor Œªd2 [see, and note that Œªd2 is denoted by ŒªD there]. There is no significant value in continuing the separate identification of tF‚àí2. Probably, in the present state of knowledge, the best approximation for simple Fowler-Nordheim-type equation based modeling of CFE from metals is obtained by putting ŒªZ‚Üí1, PF ‚Üí 1, { u}_{\\\\mathrm{F}} ‚Üí v(f). This re-generates the Fowler-Nordheim-type equation used by Dyke and Dolan in 1956, and can be called the \\"simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation\\". Recommended form for simple Fowler‚ÄìNordheim-type calculations Explicitly, this recommended simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, and associated formulae, are: : J = \\\\; a {\\\\phi^{-1}} F^2 \\\\mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \\\\;b \\\\phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(30a) : a \\\\approx \\\\; 1.541434 \\\\times 10^{-6} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{A \\\\; eV} \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{V}}^{-2};\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; b \\\\approx 6.830890 \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{eV}}^{-3/2} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{V} \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{nm}}^{-1}, ..........(30b) : v(f) \\\\approx 1 - f + (1/6) f \\\\mathrm{ln} f.......... (30c) : f = \\\\; F/F_{\\\\phi} = (e^3 / 4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0) (F/ {\\\\phi}^2) = (1.439964 \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{eV}}^2 \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{V}}^{-1} \\\\; \\\\mathrm{nm}) (F/ {\\\\phi}^2). ..........(30d) where FœÜ here is the field needed to reduce to zero a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of unreduced height equal to the local work-function œÜ, and f is the scaled barrier field for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier of unreduced height œÜ. [This quantity f could have been written more exactly as fœÜSN, but it makes this Fowler-Nordheim-type equation look less cluttered if the convention is adopted that simple f means the quantity denoted by fœÜSN in, eq. (2.16).] For the example case (œÜ= 4.5 eV, F= 5 V/nm), f‚âà 0.36 and v(f) ‚âà 0.58; practical ranges for these parameters are discussed further in. Note that the variable f (the scaled barrier field) is not the same as the variable y (the Nordheim parameter) extensively used in past field emission literature, and that \\" v(f) \\" does NOT have the same mathematical meaning and values as the quantity \\" v(y) \\" that appears in field emission literature. In the context of the revised theory described here, formulae for v(y), and tables of values for v(y) should be disregarded, or treated as values of v(f1/2). If more exact values for v(f) are required, then provides formulae that give values for v(f) to an absolute mathematical accuracy of better than 8√ó10‚àí10. However, approximation formula (30c) above, which yields values correct to within an absolute mathematical accuracy of better 0.0025, should gives values sufficiently accurate for all technological purposes. Comments A historical note on methods of deriving Fowler- Nordheim-type equations is necessary. There are several possible approaches to deriving these equations, using free-electron theory. The approach used here was introduced by Forbes in 2004 and may be described as \\"integrating via the total energy distribution, using the parallel kinetic energy Kp as the first variable of integration\\". Basically, it is a free-electron equivalent of the Modinos procedure (in a more advanced quantum-mechanical treatment) of \\"integrating over the surface Brillouin zone\\". By contrast, the free-electron treatments of CFE by Young in 1959, Gadzuk and Plummer in 1973 and Modinos in 1984, also integrate via the total energy distribution, but use the normal energy Œµn (or a related quantity) as the first variable of integration. There is also an older approach, based on a seminal paper by Nordheim in 1928, that formulates the problem differently and then uses first Kp and then Œµn (or a related quantity) as the variables of integration: this is known as \\"integrating via the normal-energy distribution\\". This approach continues to be used by some authors. Although it has some advantages, particularly when discussing resonance phenomena, it requires integration of the Fermi‚ÄìDirac distribution function in the first stage of integration: for non-free- electron-like electronic band-structures this can lead to very complex and error-prone mathematics (as in the work of Stratton on semiconductors). Further, integrating via the normal-energy distribution does not generate experimentally measured electron energy distributions. In general, the approach used here seems easier to understand, and leads to simpler mathematics. It is also closer in principle to the more sophisticated approaches used when dealing with real bulk crystalline solids, where the first step is either to integrate contributions to the ECD over constant energy surfaces in a wave-vector space ( k -space), or to integrate contributions over the relevant surface Brillouin zone. The Forbes approach is equivalent either to integrating over a spherical surface in k -space, using the variable Kp to define a ring-like integration element that has cylindrical symmetry about an axis in a direction normal to the emitting surface, or to integrating over an (extended) surface Brillouin zone using circular-ring elements. =CFE theoretical equations= The preceding section explains how to derive Fowler-Nordheim-type equations. Strictly, these equations apply only to CFE from bulk metals. The ideas in the following sections apply to CFE more generally, but eq. (30) will be used to illustrate them. For CFE, basic theoretical treatments provide a relationship between the local emission current density J and the local barrier field F, at a local position on the emitting surface. Experiments measure the emission current i from some defined part of the emission surface, as a function of the voltage V applied to some counter-electrode. To relate these variables to J and F, auxiliary equations are used. The voltage-to-barrier-field conversion factor Œ≤ is defined by: : F = \\\\; \\\\beta V, ..........(31) The value of F varies from position to position on an emitter surface, and the value of Œ≤ varies correspondingly. For a metal emitter, the Œ≤‚àívalue for a given position will be constant (independent of voltage) under the following conditions: (1) the apparatus is a \\"diode\\" arrangement, where the only electrodes present are the emitter and a set of \\"surroundings\\", all parts of which are at the same voltage; (2) no significant field-emitted vacuum space-charge (FEVSC) is present (this will be true except at very high emission current densities, around 109 A/m2 or higher); (3) no significant \\"patch fields\\" exist, as a result of non-uniformities in local work-function (this is normally assumed to be true, but may not be in some circumstances). For non-metals, the physical effects called \\"field penetration\\" and \\"band bending\\" [M084] can make Œ≤ a function of applied voltage, although ‚Äì surprisingly ‚Äì there are few studies of this effect. The emission current density J varies from position to position across the emitter surface. The total emission current i from a defined part of the emitter is obtained by integrating J across this part. To obtain a simple equation for i(V), the following procedure is used. A reference point \\"r\\" is selected within this part of the emitter surface (often the point at which the current density is highest), and the current density at this reference point is denoted by Jr. A parameter Ar, called the notional emission area (with respect to point \\"r\\"), is then defined by: : i = A_{\\\\mathrm{r}} J_{\\\\mathrm{r}} = \\\\int J \\\\mathrm{d} A, ..........(32) where the integral is taken across the part of the emitter of interest. This parameter Ar was introduced into CFE theory by Stern, Gossling and Fowler in 1929 (who called it a \\"weighted mean area\\"). For practical emitters, the emission current density used in Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is always the current density at some reference point (though this is usually not stated). Long-established convention denotes this reference current density by the simple symbol J, and the corresponding local field and conversion factor by the simple symbols F and Œ≤, without the subscript \\"r\\" used above; in what follows, this convention is used. The notional emission area Ar will often be a function of the reference local field (and hence voltage), and in some circumstances might be a significant function of temperature. Because Ar has a mathematical definition, it does not necessarily correspond to the area from which emission is observed to occur from a single- point emitter in a field electron (emission) microscope. With a large-area emitter, which contains many individual emission sites, Ar will nearly always be very very much less than the \\"macroscopic\\" geometrical area (AM) of the emitter as observed visually (see below). Incorporating these auxiliary equations into eq. (30a) yields : i = \\\\; A_{\\\\mathrm{r}} a {\\\\phi^{-1}} {\\\\beta}^2 V^2 \\\\mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \\\\;b \\\\phi^{3/2} / \\\\beta V ], ..........(33) This is the simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation, in i-V form. The corresponding \\"physically complete\\" equation is obtained by multiplying by ŒªZPF. =Modified equations for large-area emitters= The equations in the preceding section apply to all field emitters operating in the CFE regime. However, further developments are useful for large-area emitters that contain many individual emission sites. For such emitters, the notional emission area will nearly always be very very much less than the apparent \\"macroscopic\\" geometrical area (AM) of the physical emitter as observed visually. A dimensionless parameter Œ±r, the area efficiency of emission, can be defined by : A_{\\\\mathrm{r}} = \\\\; \\\\alpha_{\\\\mathrm{r}} A_{\\\\mathrm{M}}. ..........(34) Also, a \\"macroscopic\\" (or \\"mean\\") emission current density JM (averaged over the geometrical area AM of the emitter) can be defined, and related to the reference current density Jr used above, by : J_{\\\\mathrm{M}} = \\\\; i/A_{\\\\mathrm{M}} = \\\\alpha_{\\\\mathrm{r}} (i /A_{\\\\mathrm{r}}) = \\\\alpha_{\\\\mathrm{r}} J_{\\\\mathrm{r}}. ..........(35) This leads to the following \\"large-area versions\\" of the simplified standard Fowler-Nordheim-type equation: : J_{\\\\mathrm{M}} = \\\\alpha_{\\\\mathrm{r}} a {\\\\phi^{-1}} F^2 \\\\mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \\\\;b \\\\phi^{3/2} / F ], ..........(36) : i = \\\\; \\\\alpha_{\\\\mathrm{r}} A_{\\\\mathrm{M}} a {\\\\phi^{-1}} {\\\\beta}^2 V^2 \\\\mathrm{exp}[- v(f) \\\\;b \\\\phi^{3/2} / \\\\beta V ], ..........(37) Both these equations contain the area efficiency of emission Œ±r. For any given emitter this parameter has a value that is usually not well known. In general, Œ±r varies greatly as between different emitter materials, and as between different specimens of the same material prepared and processed in different ways. Values in the range 10‚àí10 to 10‚àí6 appear to be likely, and values outside this range may be possible. The presence of Œ±r in eq. (36) accounts for the difference between the macroscopic current densities often cited in the literature (typically 10 A/m2 for many forms of large-area emitter other than Spindt arrays) and the local current densities at the actual emission sites, which can vary widely but which are thought to be generally of the order of 109 A/m2, or possibly slightly less. A significant part of the technological literature on large- area emitters fails to make clear distinctions between local and macroscopic current densities, or between notional emission area Ar and macroscopic area AM, and/or omits the parameter Œ±r from cited equations. Care is necessary in order to avoid errors of interpretation. It is also sometimes convenient to split the conversion factor Œ≤r into a \\"macroscopic part\\" that relates to the overall geometry of the emitter and its surroundings, and a \\"local part\\" that relates to the ability of the very-local structure of the emitter surface to enhance the electric field. This is usually done by defining a \\"macroscopic field\\" FM that is the field that would be present at the emitting site in the absence of the local structure that causes enhancement. This field FM is related to the applied voltage by a \\"voltage-to-macroscopic-field conversion factor\\" Œ≤M defined by: : F_{\\\\mathrm{M}} = \\\\; \\\\beta_{\\\\mathrm{M}} V. ..........(38) In the common case of a system comprising two parallel plates, separated by a distance W, with emitting nanostructures created on one of them, Œ≤M = 1/W. A \\"field enhancement factor\\" Œ≥ is then defined and related to the values of Œ≤r and Œ≤M by : \\\\gamma = \\\\; F_{\\\\mathrm{r}} / F_{\\\\mathrm{M}} = \\\\beta_{\\\\mathrm{r}} / \\\\beta_{\\\\mathrm{M}}. ..........(39) With eq. (31), this generates the following formulae: : F = \\\\; \\\\gamma F_{\\\\mathrm{M}} = \\\\beta V ..........(40); \\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\;\\\\; \\\\beta = \\\\; \\\\beta_{\\\\mathrm{M}} \\\\gamma ..........(41); where, in accordance with the usual convention, the suffix \\"r\\" has now been dropped from parameters relating to the reference point. Formulae exist for the estimation of Œ≥, using classical electrostatics, for a variety of emitter shapes, in particular the \\"hemisphere on a post\\". Equation (40) implies that versions of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations can be written where either F or Œ≤V is everywhere replaced by \\\\gamma F_{\\\\mathrm{M}}. This is often done in technological applications where the primary interest is in the field enhancing properties of the local emitter nanostructure. However in some past work, failure to make a clear distinction between barrier field F and macroscopic field FM has caused confusion or error. More generally, the aims in technological development of large-area field emitters are to enhance the uniformity of emission by increasing the value of the area efficiency of emission Œ±r, and to reduce the \\"onset\\" voltage at which significant emission occurs, by increasing the value of Œ≤. Eq. (41) shows that this can be done in two ways: either by trying to develop \\"high-Œ≥\\" nanostructures, or by changing the overall geometry of the system so that Œ≤M is increased. Various trade-offs and constraints exist. In practice, although the definition of macroscopic field used above is the commonest one, other (differently defined) types of macroscopic field and field enhancement factor are used in the literature, particularly in connection with the use of probes to investigate the i-V characteristics of individual emitters. In technological contexts field emission data are often plotted using (a particular definition of) FM or 1/FM as the x-coordinate. However, for scientific analysis it usually better not to pre-manipulate the experimental data, but to plot the raw measured i-V data directly. Values of technological parameters such as (the various forms of) Œ≥ can then be obtained from the fitted parameters of the i-V data plot (see below), using the relevant definitions. = Modified equations for nanometrically sharp emitters = Most of the theoretical derivations in the field emission theory are done under the assumption that the barrier takes the Schottky-Nordheim form eq. (3). However, this barrier form is not valid for emitters with radii of curvature R comparable to the length of the tunnelling barrier. The latter depends on the work function and the field, but in cases of practical interest, the SN barrier approximation can be considered valid for emitters with radii R > 20 \\\\text{nm}, as explained in the next paragraph. The main assumption of the SN barrier approximation is that the electrostatic potential term takes the linear form \\\\Phi = Fx in the tunnelling region. The latter has been proved to hold only if x \\\\ll R. Therefore, if the tunnelling region has a length L, x for all x that determines the tunnelling process; thus if L \\\\ll R eq. (1) holds and the SN barrier approximation is valid. If the tunnelling probability is high enough to produce measurable field emission, L does not exceed 1-2nm. Hence, the SN barrier is valid for emitters with radii of the order of some tens of nm. However, modern emitters are much sharper than this, with radii that of the order of a few nm. Therefore, the standard FN equation, or any version of it that assumes the SN barrier, leads to significant errors for such sharp emitters. This has been both shown theoretically and confirmed experimentally. The above problem was tackled in ref. The SN barrier was generalized taking into account the curvature of the emitter. It can be proven that the electrostatic potential in the vicinity of any metal surface with radius of curvature R can be asymptotically expanded as :\\\\Phi(x) = Fx \\\\left[ 1-\\\\frac{x}{R} + O \\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{R} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right] \\\\text{, for } x \\\\ll R \\\\text{.}..........(42) Furthermore, the image potential for a sharp emitter is better represented by the one corresponding to a spherical metal surface rather than a planar one. After neglecting all O(x/R)^2 terms, the total potential barrier takes the form found by Kyritsakis and Xanthakis : M^{KX} (x) = h - eFx\\\\left(1-\\\\frac{x}{R} \\\\right) - \\\\frac{e^2}{16\\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0 x (1+x/2R)} ..........(43) If the JWKB approximation (4) is used for this barrier, the Gamow exponent takes a form that generalizes eq. (5) : G(h,F,R) = \\\\frac{b h^{3/2}}{F} \\\\left(v(f) + \\\\omega(f)\\\\frac{h}{eFR} \\\\right)..........(44) where f is defined by (30d), v(f) is given by (30c) and \\\\omega(f) is a new function that can be approximated in a similar manner as (30c) (there are typographical mistakes in ref., corrected here): :\\\\omega(f) \\\\approx \\\\frac{4}{5} - \\\\frac{7}{40} f + \\\\frac{1}{200} \\\\log(f) \\\\text{.}..........(45) Given the expression for the Gamow exponent as a function of the field-free barrier height h, the emitted current density for cold field emission can be obtained from eq. (23). It yields : J = a \\\\frac{F^2}{\\\\phi} \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_d(f)} + \\\\frac{\\\\phi}{eFR} \\\\psi(f) \\\\right)^{-2} \\\\exp\\\\left[-\\\\frac{b \\\\phi^{3/2}}{F} \\\\left(v(f) + \\\\omega(f)\\\\frac{\\\\phi}{eFR} \\\\right) \\\\right]..........(46) where the functions \\\\lambda_d(f) and \\\\psi(f) are defined as :\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda_d(f)} \\\\equiv v(f) - \\\\frac{4}{3}f \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial f} \\\\approx 1 + \\\\frac{f}{9} - \\\\frac{f \\\\log(f)}{22} ..........(47a) and :\\\\psi(f) \\\\equiv \\\\frac{5}{3} \\\\omega(f) - \\\\frac{4}{3}f\\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\omega}{\\\\partial f} \\\\approx \\\\frac{4}{3} - \\\\frac{f}{15} - \\\\frac{f \\\\log(f)}{1200}..........(47b) In equation (46), for completeness purposes, \\\\lambda_d is not approximated by unity as in (29) and (30a), although for most practical cases it is a very good approximation. Apart from this, equations (43), (44) and (46) coincide with the corresponding ones of the standard Fowler-Nordheim theory (3), (9), and (30a), in the limit R \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty; this is expected since the former equations generalise the latter. Finally, note that the above analysis is asymptotic in the limit L \\\\ll R, similarly to the standard Fowler-Nordheim theory using the SN barrier. However, the addition of the quadratic terms renders it significantly more accurate for emitters with radii of curvature in the range ~5-20nm. For sharper emitters there is no general approximation for the current density. In order to obtain the current density, one has to calculate the electrostatic potential and evaluate the JWKB integral numerically. For this purpose, scientific computing software-libraries have been developed. =Empirical CFE i‚ÄìV equation= At the present stage of CFE theory development, it is important to make a distinction between theoretical CFE equations and an empirical CFE equation. The former are derived from condensed matter physics (albeit in contexts where their detailed development is difficult). An empirical CFE equation, on the other hand, simply attempts to represent the actual experimental form of the dependence of current i on voltage V. In the 1920s, empirical equations were used to find the power of V that appeared in the exponent of a semi-logarithmic equation assumed to describe experimental CFE results. In 1928, theory and experiment were brought together to show that (except, possibly, for very sharp emitters) this power is V‚àí1. It has recently been suggested that CFE experiments should now be carried out to try to find the power (Œ∫) of V in the pre-exponential of the following empirical CFE equation: : i = \\\\; C V^{\\\\kappa} \\\\mathrm{exp}[-B/V], ..........(48) where B, C and Œ∫ are treated as constants. From eq. (42) it is readily shown that : \\\\- \\\\mathrm{dln} i / \\\\mathrm{d} (1/V) = \\\\; \\\\kappa V + B, ..........(49) In the 1920s, experimental techniques could not distinguish between the results Œ∫ =0 (assumed by Millikan and Laurtisen) and Œ∫=2 (predicted by the original Fowler- Nordheim-type equation). However, it should now be possible to make reasonably accurate measurements of dlni/d(1/V) (if necessary by using lock-in amplifier/phase-sensitive detection techniques and computer-controlled equipment), and to derive Œ∫ from the slope of an appropriate data plot. Following the discovery of approximation (30b), it is now very clear that ‚Äì even for CFE from bulk metals ‚Äì the value Œ∫=2 is not expected. This can be shown as follows. Using eq. (30c) above, a dimensionless parameter Œ∑ may be defined by : \\\\eta = b \\\\phi^{3/2} / F_{\\\\phi} = \\\\; (b e^3 / 4 \\\\pi \\\\epsilon_0) {\\\\phi}^{-1/2} \\\\approx 9.836239 \\\\;\\\\; (\\\\mathrm{eV} / \\\\phi)^{1/2}. ..........(50) For œÜ = 4.50 eV, this parameter has the value Œ∑ = 4.64. Since f = F/FœÜ and v(f) is given by eq (30b), the exponent in the simplified standard Fowler- Nordheim-type equation (30) can be written in an alternative form and then expanded as follows: : \\\\mathrm{exp} [-v(f) \\\\; b {\\\\phi}^{3/2} / F] \\\\; = \\\\;\\\\mathrm{exp}[-v(f) \\\\; \\\\eta /f] \\\\; \\\\approx \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{e}}^{\\\\eta} f^{-\\\\eta/6} \\\\mathrm{exp}[- \\\\eta /f] \\\\; = \\\\; {\\\\mathrm{e}}^{\\\\eta} f^{-\\\\eta/6} \\\\mathrm{exp}[-b {\\\\phi}^{3/2} /F ]. ..........(51) Provided that the conversion factor Œ≤ is independent of voltage, the parameter f has the alternative definition f = V/VœÜ, where VœÜ is the voltage needed, in a particular experimental system, to reduce the height of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier from œÜ to zero. Thus, it is clear that the factor v(f) in the exponent of the theoretical equation (30) gives rise to additional V-dependence in the pre-exponential of the empirical equation. Thus, (for effects due to the Schottky-Nordheim barrier, and for an emitter with œÜ=4.5 eV) we obtain the prediction: : \\\\kappa \\\\approx 2 - \\\\eta / 6 = 2 - 0.77 = 1.23. ..........(52) Since there may also be voltage dependence in other factors in a Fowler- Nordheim-type equation, in particular in the notional emission area Ar and in the local work-function, it is not necessarily expected that Œ∫ for CFE from a metal of local work-function 4.5 eV should have the value Œ∫ = 1.23, but there is certainly no reason to expect that it will have the original Fowler- Nordheim value Œ∫ = 2. A first experimental test of this proposal has been carried out by Kirk, who used a slightly more complex form of data analysis to find a value 1.36 for his parameter Œ∫. His parameter Œ∫ is very similar to, but not quite the same as, the parameter Œ∫ used here, but nevertheless his results do appear to confirm the potential usefulness of this form of analysis.T. Kirk, 21st Intern. Vacuum Nanoelectronics Conf., Wroc≈Çaw, July 2008. Use of the empirical CFE equation (42), and the measurement of Œ∫, may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler-Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the conduction band of bulk crystalline solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification might be needed for very sharp emitters). It seems very likely that one way in which CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of F (or V) in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of Œ∫ might provide some experimental indication of this. Fowler‚ÄìNordheim plots and Millikan‚ÄìLauritsen plots The original theoretical equation derived by Fowler and Nordheim has, for the last 80 years, influenced the way that experimental CFE data has been plotted and analyzed. In the very widely used Fowler- Nordheim plot, as introduced by Stern et al. in 1929, the quantity ln{i/V2} is plotted against 1/V. The original thinking was that (as predicted by the original or the elementary Fowler-Nordheim-type equation) this would generate an exact straight line of slope SFN. SFN would be related to the parameters that appear in the exponent of a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation of i-V form by: :S_{\\\\mathrm{FN}} = \\\\; - b {\\\\phi}^{3/2} / \\\\beta. ..........(47) Hence, knowledge of œÜ would allow Œ≤ to be determined, or vice versa. [In principle, in system geometries where there is local field-enhancing nanostructure present, and the macroscopic conversion factor Œ≤M can be determined, knowledge of Œ≤ then allows the value of the emitter's effective field enhancement factor Œ≥ to be determined from the formula Œ≥ = Œ≤/Œ≤M. In the common case of a film emitter generated on one plate of a two-plate arrangement with plate- separation W (so Œ≤M = 1/W) then : \\\\gamma = \\\\; \\\\beta W. ..........(48) Nowadays, this is one of the most likely applications of Fowler-Nordheim plots.] It subsequently became clear that the original thinking above is strictly correct only for the physically unrealistic situation of a flat emitter and an exact triangular barrier. For real emitters and real barriers a \\"slope correction factor\\" œÉFN has to be introduced, yielding the revised formula :S_{\\\\mathrm{FN}} = \\\\; - \\\\sigma_{\\\\mathrm{FN}} b {\\\\phi}^{3/2} / \\\\beta. ..........(49) The value of œÉFN will, in principle, be influenced by any parameter in the physically complete Fowler-Nordheim-type equation for i(V) that has a voltage dependence. At present, the only parameter that is considered important is the correction factor u_{\\\\mathrm{F}} relating to the barrier shape, and the only barrier for which there is any well- established detailed theory is the Schottky-Nordheim barrier. In this case, œÉFN is given by a mathematical function called s. This function s was first tabulated correctly (as a function of the Nordheim parameter y) by Burgess, Kroemer and Houston in 1953; and a modern treatment that gives s as function of the scaled barrier field f for a Schottky-Nordheim barrier is given in. However, it has long been clear that, for practical emitter operation, the value of s lies in the range 0.9 to 1. In practice, due to the extra complexity involved in taking the slope correction factor into detailed account, many authors (in effect) put œÉFN = 1 in eq. (49), thereby generating a systematic error in their estimated values of Œ≤ and/or Œ≥, thought usually to be around 5%. However, empirical equation (42) ‚Äì which in principle is more general than Fowler-Nordheim-type equations - brings with it possible new ways of analyzing field emission i-V data. In general, it may be assumed that the parameter B in the empirical equation is related to the unreduced height H of some characteristic barrier seen by tunneling electrons by : B = \\\\; b H^{3/2} / \\\\beta. ..........(50) (In most cases, but not necessarily all, H would be equal to the local work-function; certainly this is true for metals.) The issue is how to determine the value of B by experiment. There are two obvious ways. (1) Suppose that eq. (43) can be used to determine a reasonably accurate experimental value of Œ∫, from the slope of a plot of form [‚Äìdln{i}/d(1/V) vs. V]. In this case, a second plot, of ln(i)/VŒ∫ vs. 1/V, should be an exact straight line of slope ‚ÄìB. This approach should be the most accurate way of determining B. (2) Alternatively, if the value of Œ∫ is not exactly known, and cannot be accurately measured, but can be estimated or guessed, then a value for B can be derived from a plot of the form [ln{i} vs. 1/V]. This is the form of plot used by Millikan and Lauritsen in 1928. Re-arranging eq. (43) gives : B = \\\\; - \\\\mathrm{dln} (i) / \\\\mathrm{d} (1/V) - \\\\kappa (1/V). ..........(51) Thus, B can be determined, to a good degree of approximation, by determining the mean slope of a Millikan-Lauritsen plot over some range of values of 1/V, and by applying a correction, using the value of 1/V at the midpoint of the range and an assumed value of Œ∫. The main advantages of using a Millikan- Lauritsen plot, and this form of correction procedure, rather than a Fowler- Nordheim plot and a slope correction factor, are seen to be the following. (1) The plotting procedure is marginally more straightforward. (2) The correction involves a physical parameter (V) that is a measured quantity, rather than a physical parameter (f) that has to be calculated [in order to then calculate a value of s(f) or, more generally œÉFN(f)]. (3) Both the parameter Œ∫ itself, and the correction procedure, are more transparent (and more readily understood) than the Fowler-Nordheim-plot equivalents. (4) This procedure takes into account all physical effects that influence the value of Œ∫, whereas the Fowler-Nordheim-plot correction procedure (in the form in which it has been carried out for the last 50 years) takes into account only those effects associated with barrier shape ‚Äì assuming, furthermore, that this shape is that of a Schottky-Nordheim barrier. (5) There is a cleaner separation of theoretical and technological concerns: theoreticians will be interested in establishing what information any measured values of Œ∫ provide about CFE theory; but experimentalists can simply use measured values of Œ∫ to make more accurate estimates (if needed) of field enhancement factors. This correction procedure for Millikan-Lauritsen plots will become easier to apply when a sufficient number of measurements of Œ∫ have been made, and a better idea is available of what typical values actually are. At present, it seems probable that for most materials Œ∫ will lie in the range -1<Œ∫<3\\\\. Further theoretical information Developing the approximate theory of CFE from metals above is comparatively easy, for the following reasons. (1) Sommerfeld's free-electron theory, with its particular assumptions about the distribution of internal electron states in energy, applies adequately to many metals as a first approximation. (2) Most of the time, metals have no surface states and (in many cases) metal wave-functions have no significant \\"surface resonances\\". (3) Metals have a high density of states at the Fermi level, so the charge that generates/screens external electric fields lies mainly on the outside of the top atomic layer, and no meaningful \\"field penetration\\" occurs. (4) Metals have high electrical conductivity: no significant voltage drops occur inside metal emitters: this means that there are no factors obstructing the supply of electrons to the emitting surface, and that the electrons in this region can be both in effective local thermodynamic equilibrium and in effective thermodynamic equilibrium with the electrons in the metal support structure on which the emitter is mounted. (5) Atomic-level effects are disregarded. The development of \\"simple\\" theories of field electron emission, and in particular the development of Fowler-Nordheim-type equations, relies on all five of the above factors being true. For materials other than metals (and for atomically sharp metal emitters) one or more of the above factors will be untrue. For example, crystalline semiconductors do not have a free-electron-like band- structure, do have surface states, are subject to field penetration and band bending, and may exhibit both internal voltage drops and statistical decoupling of the surface-state electron distribution from the electron distribution in the surface region of the bulk band-structure (this decoupling is known as \\"the Modinos effect\\"). In practice, the theory of the actual Fowler-Nordheim tunneling process is much the same for all materials (though details of barrier shape may vary, and modified theory has to be developed for initial states that are localized rather than are travelling-wave-like). However, notwithstanding such differences, one expects (for thermodynamic equilibrium situations) that all CFE equations will have exponents that behave in a generally similar manner. This is why applying Fowler-Nordheim-type equations to materials outside the scope of the derivations given here often works. If interest is only in parameters (such as field enhancement factor) that relate to the slope of Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plots and to the exponent of the CFE equation, then Fowler-Nordheim-type theory will often give sensible estimates. However, attempts to derive meaningful current density values will usually or always fail. Note that a straight line in a Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plot does not indicate that emission from the corresponding material obeys a Fowler-Nordheim-type equation: it indicates only that the emission mechanism for individual electrons is probably Fowler-Nordheim tunneling. Different materials may have radically different distributions in energy of their internal electron states, so the process of integrating current-density contributions over the internal electron states may give rise to significantly different expressions for the current-density pre-exponentials, for different classes of material. In particular, the power of barrier field appearing in the pre-exponential may be different from the original Fowler-Nordheim value \\"2\\". Investigation of effects of this kind is an active research topic. Atomic-level \\"resonance\\" and \\"scattering\\" effects, if they occur, will also modify the theory. Where materials are subject to field penetration and band bending, a necessary preliminary is to have good theories of such effects (for each different class of material) before detailed theories of CFE can be developed. Where voltage- drop effects occur, then the theory of the emission current may, to a greater or lesser extent, become theory that involves internal transport effects, and may become very complex.

The programme, which has had continuous seasons since it was first aired, is now the longest-running children's TV show in the world. It was broadcast mainly from BBC Television Centre in London until September 2011, when the programme moved North to dock10 studios at MediaCityUK in Salford, Greater Manchester. It is currently shown live on the CBBC television channel. Created by John Hunter Blair, the programme was later developed by a BBC team led by Biddy Baxter. She became the programme editor in 1965, relinquishing the role in 1988. Throughout the show's history there have been many presenters. Currently, it is hosted by Lindsey Russell, Richie Driss, Mwaka Mudenda and Adam Beales. The show used a nautical title and theme. Its content, which follows a magazine/entertainment format, features viewer and presenter challenges, competitions, celebrity interviews, popular culture and sections on making arts and crafts items from household items. The show has had a garden in both London and Salford, known as the Blue Peter Garden, which is used during the summer and for outdoor activities. The programme has featured a number of pets that became household names, such as dogs Petra, Shep, and Goldie, as well as other animals such as tortoises, cats, and parrots. The longevity of Blue Peter has established it as a significant part of British culture and British heritage. Content Blue Peter content is wide-ranging. Most programmes are broadcast live, but usually include at least one filmed report. There will also often be a demonstration of an activity in the studio, or a music or dance performance. Between the 1960s and 2011 the programme was made at BBC Television Centre, and often came from Studio 1, the fourth-largest TV studio in Britain and one of the largest in Europe. This enabled Blue Peter to include large-scale demonstrations and performances within the live programme. From the September 2007 series, the programme was broadcast from a small fixed set in Studio 2. However, from 2009 the series began to use the larger studios once more; also more programmes were broadcast in their entirety from the Blue Peter Garden. The show is also famous for its \\"makes\\", which are demonstrations of how to construct a useful object or prepare food. These have given rise to the oft-used phrase \\"Here's one I made earlier\\", as presenters bring out a perfect and completed version of the object they are making ‚Äì a phrase credited to Christopher Trace, though Marguerite Patten is another possibility. Trace also used the line \\"And now for something completely different\\", which was later taken up by Monty Python.Alistair McGown, 'Trace, Christopher Leonard (1933‚Äì1992)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edn, Oxford University Press, October 2005; online edn, October 2008 accessed 29 June 2009 Time is also often given over to reading letters and showing pictures sent in by viewers. Over 5,000 editions have been produced since 1958, and almost every episode from 1964 onwards still exists in the BBC archives. This is unusual for programmes of that era. Editor Biddy Baxter personally ensured that telerecordings and, from 1970, video recording were kept of each episode. Many items from Blue Peter history have become embedded in British popular culture, especially moments when things have gone wrong, such as the much-repeated clip of Lulu the baby elephant (from a 1969 edition) who urinated and defecated on the studio floor, appeared to tread on the foot of presenter John Noakes and then proceeded to attempt an exit, dragging her keeper along behind her. Although it is often assumed to have been broadcast live, the edition featuring Lulu was one of the rare occasions when the programme was pre-recorded, as the presenters were en route to Ceylon for the summer expedition at the time of transmission. Other well-remembered and much-repeated items from this era include the Girl Guides' campfire that got out of hand on the 1970 Christmas edition, John Noakes's report on the cleaning of Nelson's Column, and Simon Groom referring to a previous item on the production of a facsimile door knocker for Durham Cathedral which was displayed alongside the original, with the words 'what a beautiful pair of knockers'. History Blue Peter maritime signal flag =Early years= Blue Peter was first aired on 16 October 1958. It had been commissioned to producer John Hunter Blair by Owen Reed, the head of children's programmes at the BBC, as there were no programmes for children aged between five and eight. Reed got his inspiration after watching Children's Television Club, the brainchild of former radio producer, Trevor Hill, who created the latter show as a successor to his programme Out of School, broadcast on BBC Radio's Children's Hour; Hill networked the programme from BBC Manchester and launched it aboard the MV Royal Iris ferry on the River Mersey, Liverpool with presenter Judith Chalmers welcoming everyone aboard at the bottom of the gangplank. It was subsequently televised about once a month. Hill relates how Reed came to stay with him and his wife, Margaret Potter, in Cheshire, and was so taken with the \\"Blue Peter\\" flag on the side of the ship and the programme in general, that he asked to rename it and take it to London to be broadcast on a weekly basis (see Reed's obituary). The \\"Blue Peter\\" is used as a maritime signal, indicating that the vessel flying it is about to leave, and Reed chose the name to represent 'a voyage of adventure' on which the programme would set out. Hunter Blair also pointed out that blue was a popular colour with children, and Peter was a common name of a typical child's friend. The first two presenters were Christopher Trace, an actor, and Leila Williams, winner of Miss Great Britain in 1957. The two presenters were responsible for activities which matched the traditional gender roles. As broadcasting historian Asa Briggs expressed it in 1995: \\"Leila played with dolls; Chris played with trains\\".Asa Briggs The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom: Volume V: Competition, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1995, p.178 They were supported on occasion by Tony Hart,Baxter & Barnes, p.13 an artist who later designed the ship logo,Baxter & Barnes, p.33 who told stories about an elephant called Packi (or Packie). It was broadcast every Thursday for fifteen minutes (17.00‚Äì17.15) on BBC TV (which later became BBC One). Over the first few months more features were added, including competitions, documentaries, cartoons, and stories. Early programmes were almost entirely studio-based, with very few filmed inserts being made. =1960‚Äì1969= From Monday 10 October 1960, Blue Peter was switched to every Monday and extended from 15 minutes to 20 minutes (17.00‚Äì17.20). In 1961, Hunter Blair became ill, and was often absent. After he produced his last edition on 12 June 1961,Marson, p.16 a series of temporary producers took up the post. Hunter Blair was replaced the following September by Clive Parkhurst. He did not get along with Leila Williams, who recalled \\"he could not find anything for me to do\\", and in October, Williams did not appear for six editions, and was eventually fired, leaving Christopher Trace on his own or with one-off presenters.Marson, p.21 Parkhurst was replaced by John Furness, and Anita West joined Trace on 7 May 1962.Marson, p.22 She featured in just 16 editions, making her the shortest-serving presenter, and was replaced by Valerie Singleton,Marson, p.23 who presented regularly until 1972,Marson, p.51 and on special assignments until 1981. Following the departure of Furness, a new producer who was committed to Blue Peter was required, so Biddy Baxter was appointed. At the time she was contracted to schools' programmes on the radio, and therefore unable to take up her new post immediately.Alistair McGown \\"Baxter, Biddy (1933‚Äì)\\", BFI screenonline It was suggested that Edward Barnes,Marson, p.37 a production assistant, would temporarily produce the show until Baxter arrived, at which point he would become her assistant. This suggestion was turned down, and a more experienced producer, Leonard Chase, was appointed, with Barnes as his assistant.Baxter & Barnes, p.14 Baxter eventually joined Blue Peter at the end of October 1962. During this period, many iconic features of Blue Peter were introduced. The first appeal took place in December 1962, replacing the practice of reviewing toys that children would ask for themselves.Baxter & Barnes, p.48 Blue Peter's first pet, a brown and white mongrel dog named Petra, was introduced on 17 December 1962.Marson, p.24 The puppy soon died of distemper, and having decided against upsetting young viewers over the news, Barnes and Baxter had to search London pet shops for a convincing clandestine replacement.Nick Allen \\"Petra the Blue Peter dog was a fake\\", telegraph.co.uk, 1 September 2008 Features such as \\"makes\\" (normally involving creating something such as an advent crown, out of household junk) and cooking became regular instalments on Blue Peter and continue to be used today.Marson, p.39Marson, p.41 The Blue Peter badge was introduced in 1963, along with the programme's new logo designed by Tony Hart. Baxter introduced a system that ensured replies sent to viewers' letters were personal; as a girl, she had written to Enid Blyton and twice received a standard reply, which had upset her.Marson, p.118 The next year, from 28 September 1964, Blue Peter began to be broadcast twice weekly, with Baxter becoming the editor in 1965, and Barnes and Rosemary Gill (an assistant producer who had joined as a temporary producer while Baxter was doing jury service) becoming the programme's producers.Marson, p.45 The first Blue Peter book, an annual in all but name, was published that year, and one was produced nearly every year after that, until 2010.Marson, p.88Marson, p.89 A third presenter, John Noakes, was introduced at the end of 1965 and became the longest-serving presenter. A complete contrast to Trace, Noakes set the scene for \\"daredevil\\" presenters that has continued through the generations of presenters.Marson, p.54 Trace left Blue Peter in July 1967,Marson, p.18 and was replaced by Peter Purves in November. The trio of Valerie Singleton, John Noakes and Peter Purves lasted five years, and according to Richard Marson were 'the most famous presenting team in the show's history'.Marson, p.49 In 1965, the first Summer Expedition (a filming trip abroad) was held in Norway, and continued every year (except 1986 and 2011) until 2012, all over the world.Marson, p.58 =1970‚Äì1999= The first colour edition of Blue Peter aired on 14 September 1970, and the last black and white edition on 24 June 1974.Marson, p.63 A regular feature of the 1970s were the Special Assignments, which were essentially reports on interesting topics, filmed on location. Singleton took this role, and in effect became the programme's \\"roving reporter\\".Marson, p.64 Blue Peter also offered breaking news on occasion, such as the 1971 eruption of Mount Etna, as well as unique items such as the first appearance of Uri Geller on British television. In May 1976, presenter Lesley Judd interviewed Otto Frank, father of Anne Frank, after he had agreed to bring his daughter's diaries to Britain.Marson, p.71 From 1971, the summer expedition from the previous year was edited into special programmes broadcast under the title Blue Peter Flies The World, televised during the summer break when the team were recording the latest expedition. The first was shown in July 1971 and featured the expedition to Jamaica In 1974, the Blue Peter Garden was officially opened in a green space outside the Television Centre restaurant block.Marson, p.84 By this time, Blue Peter had become an established children's programme, with regular features which have since become traditions. In 1978, the show celebrated its twentieth anniversary with a nationwide balloon launch from five regional cities during a special edition of the programme when Christopher Trace, Leila Williams, Valerie Singleton and Peter Purves returned. John Noakes contributed a message pre-recorded on film. At this time, Trace introduced the Blue Peter Outstanding Endeavour Award. Its theme music was updated by Mike Oldfield in 1979, and at the end of the decade a new presenting team was brought in, consisting of Simon Groom, Tina Heath and Christopher Wenner. They were overshadowed by the success of the previous two decades, and failed to make as much of an impact.Marson, p.72 Heath decided to leave after a year when she discovered she was pregnant, but agreed to have a live scan of her baby, something which had never been done on television before. Blue Peter was praised for this by the National Childbirth Trust who told the BBC that in 'five minutes, Blue Peter had done more to educate children about birth than they'd achieved in ten years of sending out leaflets'.Marson, p.83 Wenner decided to leave along with Heath on 23 June 1980.Marson, p.81 Sarah Greene and Peter Duncan both joined in 1980, and a new producer, Lewis Bronze, joined in 1982.Marson, p.92 The 1980s saw the Blue Peter studio become more colourful and bright, with the presenters gradually wearing more fashionable outfits, in contrast to the more formal appearance of previous decades.Marson, p.95 Several videos of Blue Peter were made available from 1982, the first being Blue Peter Makes, and an omnibus comprising the two weekly editions appeared in 1986 on Sunday mornings. Ahead of the show's 25th anniversary in October 1983, BBC1 ran a series Blue Peter Goes Silver, revisiting previous summer expeditions. The 25th anniversary itself was commemorated by a documentary presented by Valerie Singleton shown on BBC1 on Sunday, 16 October 1983. This was followed the next day by a special edition of the programme when Christopher Trace presented the annual Outstanding Endeavour Award and Valerie Singleton, Peter Purves, Christopher Wenner, Tina Heath and Sarah Greene returned to celebrate the show's birthday with the current presenting trio of Simon Groom, Peter Duncan and Janet Ellis who launched a national balloon treasure hunt. On 27 June 1988, Baxter took part in her final show, after nearly 26 years of involvement,Marson, p.96 and Bronze took her place as editor.Marson, p.99 Around this time, Blue Peter became distinctively environmentally aware, and introduced a green badge in November 1988 for achievements related to the environment.Marson, p.100 Shortly before, in October 1988, the show celebrated its thirtieth anniversary with a competition to design the cover of a commemorative issue of the 'Radio Times' and Valerie Singleton presented the Outstanding Endeavour Award on the birthday show itself. The following year, the award was presented for the last time. In 1989 (and again in 1992 and 1994), new arrangements of the theme tune was used. Due to falling ratings in BBC children's programming, BBC1 controller Alan Yentob suggested airing a third edition of Blue Peter each week from 1995. This meant that it was sometimes pre-recorded; Joe Godwin, the director, suggested that the Friday edition should be a lighter version of Blue Peter, which would concentrate on music, celebrities and games.Marson, p.124 Helen Lederer presented a documentary on BBC2 to celebrate the show's 35th anniversary Here's One I Made Earlier, with a special edition of the regular programme featuring the returns of Leila Williams, John Noakes and Lesley Judd amongst many other presenters. Neither Noakes or Judd had appeared in the studio since leaving the programme and Williams was returning for the first time in 15 years. A fourth presenter, Katy Hill, was introduced in 1995,Marson, p.138 but unlike earlier decades, there was little stability in the line-up, with resignations and new additions made almost every year of the decade. The 1990s also saw many more live broadcasts on location, with many shot entirely away from the studio. Blue Peter was also one of the first television series to launch a website. Oliver Macfarlane replaced Bronze as editor in 1996.Marson, p.127 1998 marked the 40th anniversary of the TV show. Apart from two summer proms concerts, the most talked about event to celebrate the milestone was a trip behind LNER Peppercorn Class A2 60532 Blue Peter on an Edinburgh to London railtour. The special train in question was Days out Limited's \\"Heart of Midlothian\\" from London Kings Cross to Edinburgh Waverley on Sun 19 April 1998, with 60532 working the train from Edinburgh. Due to safety rules, none of the presenters were supposed to ride on board the footplate during the trip. Peter Kirk, who was in charge on board the train and who was presenting from the footplate, however, allowed Stuart Miles to travel on board the footplate between Newark-on-Trent and Peterborough. This was the stretch of track which, on 3 July 1938, saw the world speed record for steam locomotives of set by LNER A4 Locomotive no. 4468 Mallard. In October 1998, Richard Bacon was sacked, following reports in News of the World that he had taken cocaine.Marson, p.142 This incident followed shortly after the show's 40th anniversary, when previous presenters returned for a special programme. Those returning included Leila Williams, Valerie Singleton, John Noakes, Peter Purves, Diane Louise Jordan, Anthea Turner, John Leslie, Tim Vincent, Yvette Fielding, Caron Keating, Mark Curry, Janet Ellis, Peter Duncan, Sarah Greene, Tina Heath, Simon Groome and Christopher Wenner. Steve Hocking then replaced Macfarlane as editor, at a time that was believed to be a difficult period for the programme.Marson, p.129 He introduced a further re- arrangement of the theme tune and a new graphics package in September 1999. =2000‚Äì2010= The 2000s began with the opening of two previously buried time capsules. Former presenters including Singleton, Purves and Noakes were invited back to assist, and the programme also looked at life in the 1970s when the first capsule was buried.Marson, p.158 With Hill's departure and replacement by Liz Barker in 2000, the new team of herself, Konnie Huq, Simon Thomas, and Matt Baker were consistent for the next few years. The Friday edition, as in the previous decade, featured games, competitions and celebrities, but additionally there was a drama series, The Quest, which featured cameos of many former presenters. It was at this time that the new Head of the BBC Children's Department, Nigel Pickard, asked for Blue Peter to be broadcast all year round. This was achieved by having two editions per week instead of three during the summer months, and using pre-recorded material.Marson, p.161 The early 2000s also introduced Christmas productions, in which the presenters took part.Marson, p.163 In 2003, Richard Marson became the new editor, and his first tasks included changing the output of Blue Peter on the digital CBBC. The first year of the channel's launch consisted of repeated editions, plus spin-off series Blue Peter Unleashed and Blue Peter Flies the World. This new arrangement involved a complex schedule of live programmes and pre-recorded material, being broadcast on BBC One and CBBC. Marson also introduced a brand new set, graphics and music.Marson, p.165 In September 2007, a new editor, Tim Levell, took over. At the same time, budget cuts meant that the programme came from a smaller studio. In February 2008 the BBC One programme was moved from 5 pm to 4.35 pm to accommodate The Weakest Link, and as a result, Blue Peters ratings initially dropped to as low as 100,000 viewers in the age 6‚Äì12 bracket, before steadily improving. As with the previous decade, numerous presenters joined and left the programme. This included the exits of Thomas, Baker and Barker and the additions of Z√∂e Salmon, Gethin Jones and Andy Akinwolere. Early 2008 saw the departure of Huq, who had become the longest serving female presenter with over ten years on the show. Later that year, Salmon and Jones both left and the presenting team of Akinwolere with new additions Helen Skelton and Joel Defries was introduced. The specially painted Blue Peter British Airways Boeing 757 landing at London Heathrow Airport. On 16 October 2008, Blue Peter celebrated the 50th Anniversary with a reception at Buckingham Palace hosted by Queen Elizabeth II and featuring several former presenters. There was a special live edition of the show broadcast to celebrate the anniversary with many returning presenters and a 60-minute documentary on BBC1 featuring interviews with many previous presenters and production staff, including Edward Barnes, Biddy Baxter and Rosemary Gill. Writing in the BBC's in-house magazine, Ariel, in 2009, BBC Children's Controller Richard Deverell announced plans to re-invent the show to be more like the BBC's motoring programme Top Gear. Deverell hopes that by adding \\"danger and excitement\\", Blue Peter will achieve the same \\"playground buzz\\" among children as Top Gear.Rushton, Katherine (18 February 2009). \\"Blue Peter to be 'more like Top Gear'\\", Broadcastnow, Emap Media. Retrieved 18 February 2009. =2011‚Äì2017= In January 2011, Barney Harwood was introduced to the programme as replacement for Defries, who had departed in late 2010 after two years. Unusually, Harwood was no stranger to Blue Peter viewers, having appeared as a presenter on CBBC for many years, on shows including Prank Patrol and Bear Behaving Badly. On 29 March 2011, Blue Peter became the first programme in the UK to broadcast an entire show in 360 degrees on the web. Viewers were able to watch the programme via their TVs and simultaneously interact with the television studio in front and behind the cameras on the website. Viewers were also challenged to play a game where they had to find particular crew members and staff dressed up in distinctive costumes. The final edition of Blue Peter to broadcast from the BBC's Television Centre in London, was broadcast on 28 June 2011, before a move to the BBC's new facilities at Dock10, MediaCityUK. The set left behind at BBC Television Centre was subsequently purchased and installed at Sunderland University's David Puttnam Media Centre in August 2013. When the new series started on 26 September 2011, after the usual summer break, Harwood and Skelton revealed the new look Blue Peter studio along with the new music and title sequence. Departed presenter Andy Akinwolere was not initially replaced, and for the first time in 50 years only two presenters remained on the programme. The new Blue Peter Garden, located outside the studios, was officially opened by Princess Anne in February 2012. From 12 January 2012, Blue Peter has been broadcast all year round (with no break for summer) once a week, its original premiere being on CBBC on Thursdays at 5.45pm, changed to 5.30pm from April 2013 then 5:00 pm from March 2015. It was usually repeated on Fridays on BBC One, although this ceased in December 2012. A repeat airs at 9.00am on Sundays. At this time, Levell left to work at BBC Radio 5 Live; he was replaced (initially in an acting capacity) as editor by Ewan Vinnicombe, who had worked on the programme as a producer since 2007. The reformatted Blue Peter occasionally also included specials and spin-offs such as \\"Helen's Polar Adventure\\" or the Stargazing Live special on other days of the week. In 2013, Lindsey Russell was voted the 36th presenter via Blue Peter - You Decide!, a series of five programmes hosted by Dick and Dom, where ten wannabe presenters were set a number of challenges to prove that they were worthy of the position. Judges Cel Spellman, Eamonn Holmes and Myleene Klass decided the final three, before viewers were given the chance to vote online. Russell joined Blue Peter in September of that year, shortly before Skelton's departure and the introduction of her replacement Radzi Chinyanganya. From October 2013, the team consisted of Harwood, Russell and Chinyanganya. The format adapted with slightly different branding and a more classic take on the show, as well as beginning Blue Peter Bites, which are five-minute clips showing just one challenge or video from episodes broadcast on CBBC. Blue Peter guide pup Iggy joined the team in 2014 and Shelley the Tortoise continues to make occasional appearances. The Blue Peter Garden is currently maintained by child gardener George who appears throughout the year. The team made more use of the website with more quizzes and videos such as 'Blue Peter VS...' and 'Ultimate Challenges' as well as holding a fan club hour after the show where fans could leave comments as to the answers of riddles or headline suggestions and ask guests questions. A popular game on the programme, Spot Shelley was also introduced, where, in most episodes, an animated version of Shelley the tortoise is hiding somewhere/on something and viewers must leave a comment on the website during the show, the first person to spot her wins a shout-out (or some more expensive or weird prizes as Harwood would often joke, such as a house in Spain or a unicorn called Eric). From April 2017, the show reverted to 5:30 pm. In September 2017, Harwood left the show, again leaving just two presenters. In the summer, Blue Peter often challenges its viewers to earn all of their Blue Peter badges (with the exception of orange and gold) through five weeks, where the team look at each individual badge for a week, finishing with the limited time Sports badge which appears every summer with a different design. In the show before these weeks, the team show viewers how to make something to keep their badges in/on and continue the theme through the weeks, these have included the Badge Baton Relay in 2016, where badges stored within a baton tube and the Big Badge Boat Bonanza in 2017, where badges displayed on the iconic BP ship, a 2D model that can be made from paper. Ahead of their Jubilee celebrations, Blue Peter introduced its first ever Guest Editor to the show on 19 October 2017 which was children's author Dame Jacqueline Wilson. Guest Editors have control for the day and plan what they what to show on their edition, as well as taking control behind the scenes. =2018‚Äìpresent= A special programme broadcast on 1 February 2018, marked Blue Peter's 5000th edition. A brand new Diamond badge was revealed for the first time, designed by Henry Holland. This was only to be awarded within the special 60th year of 2018. On 12 October 2017, it was revealed that outside of MediaCityUK, a Hollywood style walk of fame would be created with the names of famous people who have received a Gold Blue Peter badge. The walkway would lead up to the front of the studios and would help to mark 60 years of Blue Peter. There were various celebrations across the UK for \\"The Big Birthday Year\\". In January, a competition was launched to design Blue Peters second birthday balloon to be flown. In May, the Millennium Time Capsule formally buried under the Millennium Dome, which was dug up accidentally in 2017 by builders went on tour with various past presenters around the country. A play, \\"Once Seen On Blue Peter\\", ran at the Edinburgh Festival fringe in August, with six former presenters appearing in it. On 16 October 2018, a special one- hour live edition of the programme, entitled Blue Peter: Big 60th Birthday, was broadcast on CBBC. Guests included The Vamps, Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Ed Sheeran, who was presented with a gold Blue Peter badge. Former presenters returned for the show and contributed to the broadcast, including Leila Williams, Anita West, Valerie Singleton, Peter Purves, Lesley Judd, Sarah Greene, Peter Duncan, Janet Ellis, Yvette Fielding, John Leslie, Diane-Louise Jordan, Anthea Turner, Tim Vincent, Stuart Miles, Katy Hill, Romana D'Annunzio, Richard Bacon, Konnie Huq, Simon Thomas, Liz Barker, Z√∂e Salmon, Andy Akinwolere, Helen Skelton, Joel Defries and Barney Harwood. Matt Baker contributed a pre-recorded message and Mark Curry was represented by a lego model as he had to cancel his contribution due to ill health. The programme was repeated on BBC Two on 20 October.https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/tv- listings/?sd=20-10-2018%2016:00 The celebration was also marked by other BBC programming, including The One Show hosted by Matt Baker and former Blue Peter contributor Gabby Logan, which featured Sarah Greene, Mark Curry, Simon Thomas and Konnie Huq; ITV's Lorraine, where Greene appeared with Leila Williams and Anthea Turner; and BBC Breakfast which featured Lesley Judd. A documentary entitled Happy Birthday Blue Peter was broadcast that evening on BBC Radio 2. It was hosted by Barney Harwood and featured interviews with past and present presenters, as well as members of the production team. As part of the birthday celebrations a new plant species was named Blue Peter. In February 2019 a gritter was named and decorated \\"Blue Peter\\", unveiled by Lindsey. Presenters and contributors Christopher Trace and Leila Williams were the first presenters of Blue Peter in October 1958, and since then, there have been 37 subsequent presenters. Lindsey Russell, who joined the programme in 2013, currently hosts along with Richie Driss, who was announced as the 38th presenter and began in May 2019. The next addition was Mwaksy Mudunda who was revealed as the 39th presenter on 13 June, 2019. The 40th presenter joined the team in September 2020, Adam Beales. Other personnel who have played roles on the show include the zoologist George Cansdale, who was the programme's first on-screen veterinarian, and Percy Thrower who was the show's gardening expert from 21 March 1974 to 23 November 1987 and was presented with a Gold Blue Peter badge shortly before he died in 1988. He was followed from 1988 until 1991 by Chris Crowder and from 1991 until 2000 by Clare Bradley. From 2004 until 2013 by Chris Collins. From 2014 to present, The Skinny Jean Gardeners Lee & Dale Connelly and child gardener George Hassal the RHS Ambassador, who makes various appearances throughout the year. Another contributor, though rarely seen on screen, was Margaret Parnell, who created almost all of the show's \\"makes\\" from 1963 until her retirement in 2001. Her role was then filled by Gillian Shearing, though Parnell's name still appeared in the credits from time to time when a classic \\"make\\" was re-used. Director/producer Alex Leger who joined the show in 1975 as a production assistant and retired in 2011, making him Blue Peters longest serving staff member ever. Presenter Anthea Turner said of Leger: \\"Alex was the director we feared and loved in the same sentence; he would push you to your limits of endurance and in my case made me face my fear of water by taking me to Crystal Palace to shoot a film about high board diving. Never have my knees knocked so much.\\"Turner, Turner. \\"Blue Peter Party\\" Anthea Turner's Blog. 26 November 2011. Retrieved 12 September 2012. Writing on The Huffington Post in November 2012, Leger admitted the \\"piles of clippings, strange souvenirs from overseas trips, half- finished 'makes' from the show and half-dead pot plants disguised the fact something ground-breaking was happening in the cramped Blue Peter offices\\". Leger published his book, Blue Peter: Behind the Badge, on 5 November 2012, in collaboration with many of his former colleagues.Blue Peter Book. \\"Blue Peter: Behind the Badge\\" Retrieved 31 October 2012 Pets The Blue Peter pets are the animals who regularly appear on the programme. These include dogs, cats, parrots and tortoises. John Noakes was almost famous for his work with a dog called Shep. Among the most recent Blue Peter pets are two cats, one called Socks and one called Cookie; and one tortoise called Shelley. Dog Mabel retired on 30 March 2010 after 14 years on the show. Barney, a red setter- dachshund, made his TV debut on Tuesday 22 September 2009, and left four years later at the same time as his owner, presenter Helen Skelton. Lucy, a golden retriever, died aged 13 in late March 2011. In July 2013, Socks and Cookie made their final appearance in the studio in Salford, as (like Shelley the tortoise) they live in London, but they are still regarded as part of the programme team. Trained Guide Dog Iggy, who joined in 2014, still appears regularly. In 2019, new dog (Beagle-Basset Hound cross) Henry joined the team. They are attended by resident vet Dr Rory Cowlam.

Since the 1970s, presenters have maintained a Blue Peter Garden. The first garden, which was designed by British horticulturist Percy Thrower in 1974, was at the rear of Television Centre (). Its features included an Italian sunken garden with a pond that contained goldfish, a vegetable patch, greenhouse and viewing platform. The garden was also used to commemorate the show's pets and notable events. A bust of the dog Petra was placed in the garden after her death in 1977. The remains of George the Tortoise were interred there in 2004. It had a sculptures of the Blue Peter ship, and a plaque honouring Percy Thrower, who died in 1988. The garden was often made available to other programmes for outside broadcasts such as the links between children's programmes during the summer months and for BBC Breakfasts weather forecasts. On Monday 21 November 1983, Janet Ellis reported that over the weekend the garden had been vandalised. A rumour circulated in the early 1990s that the vandalism had been carried out by a gang that included the future English international footballers Dennis Wise and Les Ferdinand when they were teenagers. Both men denied any involvement, although Ferdinand did later appear to confess to \\"helping a few people over the wall.\\" However, Ferdinand later recanted saying he had been making a joke and was never there. In September 2011, when the programme's production base moved to Dock10 in Salford, parts of the first garden including the sculptures and the sunken pond, were relocated to the piazza outside the new studio (). The 2000 Blue Peter time capsule that was buried in London was also brought to the new location. It was due to be opened in 2029 but was accidentally dug up in 2017. Blue Peter's second garden was officially opened on Thursday 23 February 2012 by The Princess Royal. Like its predecessor, it continues to be used throughout the year for outdoor broadcasts and live events. Main badges The design of the original \\"Blue\\" badge Children (and adults) who appear on the show or achieve something notable may be awarded the coveted Blue Peter badge. The Blue Peter badge allows holders free entry into a number of visitor attractions across the UK. In March 2006, this privilege was temporarily suspended after a number of badges were discovered for sale on the auction site eBay. This suspension was lifted in June 2006, when a new \\"Blue Peter Badge Card\\" was introduced to combat the problem, which is issued to each badge winner to prove that they are the rightful owners.Edition broadcast 19 June 2006. The presenters almost always wear their badge; the only exception being when their apparel is incompatible (for example, a life jacket), in which case a sticker with the ship emblem is normally used instead. In addition, large prints or stickers of the ship are attached to vehicles driven by the presenters during filming assignments. In addition to the standard \\"blue\\" badge, several variations of the badge exist, for various achievements, including: * Silver badges, for sending in a letter or poem to the show when you already have the blue badge * Green badges, for contributions with a conservation, nature or environmental theme * Gold badges, the most rarely awarded, for exceptional achievement the second-highest awarded badge * Competition winners orange badges, for competition winners or runners up (replacing the previous circular \\"competition winner's badge\\") * Purple badges, awarded for completing a review of the show by completing the form on the Blue Peter website * 50th anniversary badge, awarded for sending a picture, poem or letter on the subject of the programme's 50th birthday * Factbyte factory badge, awarded to people who completed up to V.I.P. level 7 on the Factbyte factory online game on the official Blue Peter Website in 2009. * Sport badge, awarded to people from July ‚Äì September 2013 (and again each summer since) for inspiring a friend or family member to try a new sport. * Diamond Badge, awarded to people from February 2018 to February 2019 who filled in their Diamond Badge application form. It is a special badge for Blue Peter's 60th year. Annual events The programme also marks annual events, including Chinese New Year, St David's Day, Shrove Tuesday, Mothering Sunday, Guy Fawkes Night and Christmas. The latter, in particular, is a special occasion with a traditional format repeated year on year. =Shrove Tuesday= Usually shows one of the presenters making a pancake. It is usually the newest presenter who makes the pancake and attempts to toss it perfectly. =Mothering Sunday= Usually shows the viewers how to make their own Mother's Day card or present. =Guy Fawkes Night= Usually tells the history of Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot whilst the presenters tell viewers about the firework code and tips for a safe bonfire and fireworks night. =Christmas= The traditional Christmas programme usually opens with the signature tune being replaced with a brass band arrangement of the carol \\"Good King Wenceslas\\" juxtaposed with shots of viewers' home-made Christmas cards and followed by the lighting of the final candle on the Advent Crown. The programme's Christmas manger figures are featured, reminding viewers of the Nativity story, a last-minute Christmas make, either a song and dance or filming assignment and the grand finale; the Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band and children from various schools, assisted by members of the BBC Symphony Chorus, marching \\"up the hill\\" and into the studio from the cold outside (lanterns in hand) singing a Christmas carol (alternating years between either \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing\\" or \\"O! Come All Ye Faithful\\") around the Blue Peter Christmas tree. In some years there was a Christmas play, either spoofing hit movies like Grease, popular songs or a pantomime. Much of the script has been repeated year after year for this special programme. However, for the 2007 Christmas programme, none of these traditions were featured (although the crib had been glimpsed in the previous edition), ending a format repeated annually since the 1960s. Apart from presents for the presenters and pets and a brief look at the programme's Nativity crib, the traditional elements remained largely absent in 2008 and 2009. From 2010 the closing carol was reinstated, with the Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band being replaced by the Salford band from 2011 onwards, as the programme had moved to MediaCity by then. In 2014, the full traditional content was revived, including the viewers' home-made cards accompanied by the Good King Wenceslas arrangement, the Advent Crown (although now using electric candles for safety reasons) and (after an absence in the previous two years) the sparkling ship logo appearing by the shot of the crib in the studio at the end of the closing carol. These elements have been retained in the subsequent two years, apart from the Good King Wenceslas sequence being dropped in 2016. =Appeals= D class lifeboat, one of 25 lifeboats funded by the programme, now part of the Royal National Lifeboat Collection on display at the Historic Dockyard, Chatham. An enduring feature of the programme is the annual charity appeal, which asks viewers to collect items that can be recycled or sold to raise money for the chosen cause. For example, in 1973‚Äì74, Blue Peter sponsored a \\"Stampede\\", asking people to donate postage stamps in support of Ethiopian famine relief. This is always a charity project in the UK in odd- numbered years, and abroad in even-numbered. The appeal is usually launched in late November and runs through to February or March of the following year. Until 1979, only waste products were ever collected, such as stamps, linens, coins, scrap metal etc. In 1979, one of the most popular forms of raising appeal money was introduced; encouraging viewers to hold \\"Blue Peter Bring And Buy Sales\\" at which buyers are also encouraged to bring their own bric-a-brac or produce to sell. The Great Bring And Buy Sale was used every few years or so as a means of adding variety to the collecting theme during other years. Between 2001 and 2003 a series of \\"Bring And Buy Appeals\\" led many viewers and the media to voice their concern that the traditional method of collecting scrap items to recycle was being abandoned in favour of the \\"easier revenue\\" generated by the sales. This led to an on-air explanation by presenter Konnie Huq during the 2003 Get Together Appeal that this particular appeal required the sort of funding that only Bring And Buy Sales could raise. The 2004 and 2005 appeals saw a return to the collecting theme: the first being to collect old clothes that Oxfam could sell in its stores to raise funds for a family- searching service in third world countries ravaged by war, and the second being the collection of old mobile telephones and coins that could be recycled to raise money for ChildLine. Continuing the return to collecting unwanted items, Blue Peter launched its Shoe Biz Appeal campaign in 2006. In partnership with UNICEF, its aim was to collect unwanted pairs of shoes or other footwear in order to raise money for children orphaned by AIDS and HIV in Malawi. The 2007 appeal was the \\"Disc Drive\\" ‚Äì working with Barnardo's to sell unwanted CDs and DVDs. During appeals, the sum of money or objects collected is presented on the totaliser ‚Äì a display that lights to show the amount collected. With some appeals, a second totaliser has often been introduced immediately after the original target has been met, with the aim of providing an incentive to keep on donating. The 2007 Disc Drive Appeal was, controversially, handled in a different editorial style, and it was not featured in each programme since its launch as in previous years. Also the totaliser, previously a part of the studio set, was relegated to an on-screen animation/graphic. The 2008 appeal was called Mission Nutrition, an attempt to provide children in the UK, Bangladesh and South Africa with better food. As part of this appeal, the Blue Peter presenters held the world's biggest bring and buy sale on 18 February 2009, which was attended by several celebrities as well as regular people. Since the 2008 appeal there has been a return to regular features on the Appeal's progress in each edition, and the reinstatement of a physical studio set Totaliser. The 2009 Appeal was \\"Send a Smile Appeal\\" which was symbolic as being the first Appeal in the history of the programme to blend a collecting theme with the Blue Peter \\"make\\" methodology. Children were encouraged to collect unwanted T-shirts to be donated to Operation Smile, a charity providing free reconstructive surgery to children in the developing world, where they were to be used as surgical gowns for their operations. Appeal contributors were encouraged to customise their gowns in a variety of creative ways, as well as following instructions given on the programme for how to include eyelets and ties to the backs of the gowns. In subsequent years, the traditional Appeal has been dropped in favour of general fundraising and awareness-raising for BBC Children in Need. As part of the 50th year a BBC estimate was that since the first appeal started Blue Peter has raised over ¬£100 million (inflation adjusted figure to 2008 value) by appeals. In 2018, it was announced that to celebrate Blue Peter's 60th year, it's 'Bring and Buy Sales' would be returning in aid of BBC Children in Need. =Book awards= Blue Peter promotes the Blue Peter Book Awards, a series of literary prizes for children's literature awarded annually, and inaugurated in 2000. Time capsules One of the most iconic parts of the show is its time capsules. Tradition began in 1971 when the first Blue Peter time capsule was buried, set to be opened in 2000 to show the next generations of viewers about life of the time, viewers selecting what goes in the time capsule. Since then more time capsules have been buried and opened. =1971‚Äì2000= The first time capsule was buried by Valerie Singleton, John Noakes and Peter Purves in front of the BBC Television Centre, where the presenters dug and buried the capsule. It contained objects from the time such as a copy of the 1970 Blue Peter annual, a set of decimal coins ‚Äì which were introduced in 1971 ‚Äì and photographs of the three presenters. The box had to be moved at one point in its long burial ‚Äì the original site of the capsule was due to be developed in 1984 so the unopened box was unearthed and moved to another site in the Blue Peter garden. On Friday 7 January 2000, presenters Katie, Konnie, Simon and Matt were joined with Valerie, John and Peter, who buried the capsule, to help unearth it. The team used a treasure map to locate the box and then dug it up and opened it. Water had leaked into the box and partially damaged some items, however most of the items were in surprisingly good condition. Editor Richard Marson decided that the opening of the capsule should not be broadcast live as it was unclear as to what would be discovered inside or even if the rusted container could even be opened. He was glad he made this decision when it became clear during the recording that the capsule had at some point been opened - probably at the time it was moved and reburied - and that the contents had been wrapped entirely differently from the original burial. By editing the video of the opening, he managed to avoid this becoming obvious to the viewers.Marson, Richard (2008). Blue Peter 50th Anniversary Book: The Story of Television's Longest-running Children's Programme. Hamlyn. =1984‚Äì2000= A second box was buried alongside the original by presenters Simon Groom, Peter Duncan and Janet Ellis, when the original was moved to the Blue Peter garden. This box contained hairs from Goldie the Blue Peter Labrador, a record of the programme's theme tune arranged by Mike Oldfield and video footage of the moving of Petra's statue. The later capsule was dug up by Groom and Ellis. =1998‚Äì2017/2050 (The Millennium Time Capsule)= The third was buried by Katie Hill and Richard Bacon in the floor beneath the Millennium Dome on 11 June 1998. As well as containing Blue Peter items including a badge and history of the programme, the capsule also contains a set of Teletubby dolls, an insulin pen and a France '98 football. The time capsule was set to be opened in 2050, however in 2017 it was accidentally dug up by builders and damaged. It was then taken back to Salford and restored successfully. In 2018 it was announced that, as part of the shows 60th birthday, the contents would go on tour with various past presenters meeting it at several locations, after which it would be stored in the National Archives until 2050. =2000‚Äì2029= Following the unearthing of the first two time capsules in 2000 a fourth time capsule was to be buried in the Blue Peter garden.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1h-2LcAV- Mg&t;=66s Burying the 2000-2029 Capsule Alongside one of the recent Blue Peter books, two video tapes of the shows best bits from 1999, Photographs of the presenters and crew of the show in 2000 as well as items celebrating the shows 40th birthday in 1998. Matt Baker, Simon Thomas, Katy Hill & Konnie Huq also contributed by adding their own contribution. The capsule is due to be dug up in 2029. =2018‚Äì2038 (The Diamond Time Capsule)= In 2018, the team announced a new time capsule for their 60th anniversary. Viewers could suggest the contents of the time capsule through the website for the first time, and it is also to be stored in the National Archives, the first time it will not be buried. The capsule was stored on the 60th birthday programme by a competition winner, who had won the chance to have her design printed onto the capsule, as well as presenters Radzi Chinyanganya, Lindsey Russell, Valerie Singleton, Peter Purves, Janet Ellis and Katy Hill. Books In 1964, the first Blue Peter book was published by Lutterworth Press, by arrangement with the BBC. Due to the success of the book, the BBC produced an in house publication the following year.https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/bluepeter/earlyyears/trivia.shtml Although an annual in all but name, the books are rarely referred to as such. Each book (published in time for Christmas) features highlights from the previous twelve months of Blue Peter features, and chronicles major guests who visit the studio, the Summer expedition, the annual appeal, and the pets. The style of the books' contents has changed very little over the years, with the only noticeable difference between a 1960s book and the current formula being the increase in colour photography and digital artwork; otherwise, the principle is the same. There was, in 1986 and 1990, and between 1992 and 1997, a break in the publication of the books. Since Pedigree took over the books in 2004, there has been an increase in quality. The books are now bigger than before, with a greater number of pages. The Blue Peter editor and members of the production team write the book, and choose its content, though the book is written from the presenters' point of view. As for the 'book or annual' debate, as of Book 34 in 2004, the cover makes reference to it as \\"Annual XXXX\\" and the spine marking it as \\"Book XX\\". This is probably because The Beano and The Dandy books were renamed as annuals in 2003, leaving Blue Peter the only one still using the name book on its annuals. A collectors' market has developed, with \\"Book One\\" being especially rare and commanding triple figures on online auction websites. Books from the late 1960s and 1970s are more common, and often turn up for less than a pound in second hand bookshops or charity stores. Books from the 1980s and 1990s tend to be more expensive and rarer, as people realised the value of keeping hold of them. In the early 1970s a set of Blue Peter mini books were produced, covering specific topics that had been featured in the TV series. A set of these were buried in 1971 in the time capsule for the year 2000. The spin-off series Blue Peter Special Assignment also had books. In 2011 it was announced that due to falling sales, the annuals would be scrapped.\\"End of story for the Blue Peter Annual\\", The Daily Telegraph, 23 September 2011.\\"Blue Peter annual readers forced to jump ship\\", The Guardian, 21 September 2011. However, programme editor Tim Levell indicated that the book could return in the future. Broadcast history =BBC One (1958‚Äì2012)= Blue Peter first aired once a week on Mondays on the BBC Television Service, now BBC One, for a duration of 15 minutes.b&b13; From 28 September 1964 until 1995 it was shown twice a week on Mondays and Thursdays, extending its duration to 25 minutes. A third show was added in 1995, broadcasting on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and from 2000 the show began airing at 5pm, due to Newsround moving to a later slot. From 2006 the show's output began to be reduced, first by dropping the Friday edition, and initially moving the programme schedule to Monday to Wednesday, before moving again to Tuesday to Thursday. In May 2007, it was announced the show would lose a show a week and return to broadcasting twice weekly, leaving Tuesday and Wednesday the only days on which Blue Peter was broadcast on BBC One. At the time the BBC claimed that the purpose of returning to two shows a week was to increase the quality of the programme's content rather than simply a means of reducing production costs.\\"BBC cuts back Blue Peter,\\" The Guardian. Published 25 May 2007. The show's schedule was changed again in February 2008 when Blue Peter was moved to the 4.35 pm slot on BBC One,Marson, p.168 due to The Weakest Link moving from BBC Two to replace Neighbours which had transferred to Five. However, this timing change led to a decrease in viewing figures for the weekday afternoon CBBC One slot, with Blue Peter receiving fewer than 100,000 viewers, down from around 335,000 in 2003. The BBC Trust recommended that the BBC produce plans, detailing how they intended to increase viewership, by mid-2009. In September 2010, the show was moved from Wednesdays and Tuesdays to Mondays and Tuesdays at the same time slot. =CBBC Channel (2012‚Äì)= From Thursday, 12 January 2012 another episode was dropped, with the show coming full circle by only broadcasting one new episode each week. For the first time in the show's history, first run episodes were now broadcast on the CBBC Channel, at 5.45pm on Thursdays. However, a repeat was still broadcast the following day on BBC One. Eventually however, in December 2012, Blue Peter ended its 54-year run on BBC One and now airs only on the CBBC Channel. The move came as regular children's programming was removed entirely from BBC One and Two following the completion of the digital switchover. Viewing figures determined that 93% of CBBC's target audience was now watching the BBC's children's programming on the dedicated CBBC Channel (including first-run episodes of Blue Peter), and few viewers were watching solely on BBC One. =Repeats and spin-off shows= Blue Peter was first repeated in full on satellite and cable channel UK Gold in the 1990s, one of the first archive channels in the UK. Later it moved to sister channel UK Gold Classics when UK Gold began broadcasting more recent programmes, although that channel lasted only six months before closing. In September 1998, the BBC launched its first digital only channel BBC Choice. A few months after launch, a new weekend afternoon CBBC Choice strand began broadcasting, and as part of this a highlights show Re:Peter showcased the best of that week's Blue Peter shows. Re:Peter, along with a similar highlights show for Live & Kicking known as L&K; Replay, ended when the strand was axed in April 2000 and became the daily 6am7pm CBBC on Choice programming block which launched in November 1999. However, in 2002, repeats of Blue Peter started being shown on CBBC on Choice's successor, the newly launched CBBC Channel, along with spin-off shows Blue Peter Unleashed and Blue Peter Flies the World. From 2003 a new arrangement involved new material being shown daily, on both BBC One and the CBBC Channel. In 2017, Blue Peter Bite, a five-minute programme which features challenges previously shown on the programme was introduced. Signature tune and motif The signature tune has always been a hornpipe, originally using variations of Barnacle Bill by Herbert Ashworth-Hope (not to be confused with the bawdy American drinking song Barnacle Bill the Sailor.) The original version of the theme was a recording by the New Century Orchestra issued by the FDH Mood Music library. From the 2008 series, the theme became a rendition of the similar Sailor's Hornpipe. However, from 14 October 2008, the tune has been a blend of both tunes. =Opening theme= The following is a list of all the versions of the Blue Peter signature tune that have been used on the show: * Sidney Torch & The New Century Orchestra: October 1958 to January 1979 * Mike Oldfield: January 1979 to June 1989 (see \\"Blue Peter\\" (Mike Oldfield instrumental)) * Simon Brint: September 1989 to September 1992 * Simon Brint: September 1992 to September 1994 * The Yes/No People: September 1994 to August 1999 * David Arnold and the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra: September 1999 to June 2004 * Nial Brown: September 2004 to December 2006 *Dave Cooke: January 2007 to June 2007 *Dave Cooke & Blue Peter Music Makers September 2007 to June 2008 *Dobs Vye: September 2008 ‚Äì June 2011 * Banks & Wag: September 2011 ‚Äì present The debut of a new version of the theme tune is sometimes accompanied with an introduction by the presenters at the time explaining the reasons behind the new rendition. In 2006, a new version was arranged and recorded by Murray Gold as part of the Music Makers competition, with prize winners taking part in the final orchestral recording. Viewers were told that this recording would be used when the series returned from its summer break in September 2006; however, for unknown reasons this was not the case, save for excerpts being used as incidental music. Instead, when the September 2006 series began, a slightly shortened version of the 2004 arrangement was used, with the opening bars removed. Between January and June 2007, Dave Cooke (who was the husband of ex-presenter Tina Heath) re-arranged the theme tune, although it was confirmed that Murray Gold's new arrangement would be used from the new series in September 2007, to coincide with the programme's 50th anniversary celebrations. However, the version that ultimately aired bears little resemblance to either the original Murray Gold/Music Makers recording or any previous recording of the theme.BBC ‚Äì Blue Peter ‚Äì Your Questions Answered For the start of the September 2008 series, Barnacle Bill was dropped after nearly fifty years and replaced by an arrangement of the very similar Sailor's Hornpipe. On 14 October (the same week as the 50th anniversary) the opening tune was reworked to include elements of \\"Barnacle Bill\\" once again. The closing theme for 2008 is the same as opening signature tune. In September 2011, the series returned to using \\"Barnacle Bill\\" though with the opening bars and drum roll omitted (along with the \\"Sailor's Hornpipe\\") and the traditional closing signature tune not used. = Closing theme = It is unknown what the closing music of Blue Peter was in its earliest days, but by the mid-1960s, the show was closing with an edit of Parts Two and Three of Drums and Fife, from a 1961 suite of six library cues by Wilfred Burns, performed by The Light Symphonia, conducted by Roberto Capelli (Conroy, BM 301-A). This recording remained in use until January 1979 when it was replaced by an arrangement by Mike Oldfield. The track continued to be rearranged along with subsequent versions of the opening theme until 1999, when Drums and Fife was dropped and the opening theme used to close the show too. Drums and Fife returned in an arrangement by Nial Brown used from 2004 to 2006, and then by Dave Cooke as of January 2007. From September 2007 to June 2008 the closing theme was slightly extended and rearranged, again by Dave Cooke. From 2008 Drums and Fife was dropped again with the closing theme being the same as opening signature tune. =Motif= The programme's motif is a stylised sailing ship designed by Tony Hart. Hart's original design was never successfully used in a totally uniform fashion, with several different reproductions used in studio, on badges, the Blue Peter books and on-screen graphics. This was until the show's redesign in 1999, when the ship's rigging and hull detail was removed, and in 2000, the flags were subtly reshaped. For the 2008 series there has been a return to the original flag design on the ship, although some of the mast detail on the bow and stern has been removed. =Opening titles= 1958‚Äì1989: The original opening titles showed a Blue Peter flag being lowered on a ship.Marson, p.12 By the late 1960s, the opening sequence featured extracts of that edition's filmed inserts or an event in the studio where speech was absent accompanied by the signature tune and superimposed presenter credits. The presenter's names were always listed in 'seniority' based on the order in which they joined the programme. From 1972‚Äì1975, any edition that featured Valerie Singleton, whether she was in the studio co-presenting the show, being seen in a filmed insert or even featuring in a repeated film item from the archives, her name was always above the other presenters. 1989‚Äì1997: From 1989, a 2D animation of the Blue Peter ship had been developed and used alongside the 1985-introduced word-logo and was used as a method of displaying both the ship and Blue Peter name to precede any film or episode footage as before. From 1992 a 3D animation was used and further replaced by another graphical sequence in 1994. Once again, these animations preceded any film, studio or episode footage. Occasionally, from the 1994 series onwards, the 3D animation of the Blue Peter ship would be followed by a preview of certain items on the day's programme with a \\"coming up\\" caption and a presenter commentary. Again, the theme music would either play in full or fade out at an appropriate time. 1997‚Äì1999: From 1997, a more generic title sequence was used with the 1994 ship and title animation remaining, but was followed by clips of different action shots from a variety of the past years' filming assignments intermixed with specially filmed \\"posing\\" footage of the presenters. The traditional format of episode-specific film or studio setting scenes were still used, occasionally on their own, or mixed into the generic footage to varying degrees depending on the day's edition. The theme music tended to play out in full, and on days when a totally generic version of the titles were used, the opening was often followed by a \\"coming up\\" sequence narrated by the presenters. 1999‚Äì2004: By 1999, a new \\"bubble ship\\" symbol and titles sequence had been developed to be used alongside the traditional ship emblem. These bubble ships were seen floating around the presenters who were displayed in specially posed shots, and appeared to be floating above a graphical ocean on their own blue coloured ships, and in 2003 when the presenters' shots were updated, they appeared to be waving, smiling and blowing the bubble ships. This footage was also mixed in with episode-specific film, introductory studio setting or more predominantly from the 2003 series onwards a preview of many items on the day's programme with a return to a \\"coming up\\" caption and presenter commentary. 2004‚Äì2006: In 2004, a similar approach was adopted with each presenter posing with \\"ship's rigging\\" in their hands, appearing as though they were hoisting the sails of the Blue Peter ship. This sequence, designed by BBC Broadcast (now Red Bee Media) saw a return to the sole use of the original Blue Peter ship logo and also featured the Blue Peter pets in their own poses. Predominantly these titles would precede a \\"coming up\\" sequence or occasionally clips of the edition's filming assignment. The original version used from 2004‚Äì2005 opened with the ship logo and featured silhouettes of unidentified children also hoisting sails along with the presenters. This was discarded in 2005 for the last year of the sequence's run and opened with the ship and Blue Peter name for the first time in six years ‚Äì allowing more flexibility for when the titles would merge into that day's edition without being completed in full, as in the 1950‚Äì1990s era ‚Äì before flowing into the rest of the titles (minus children) as before. 2006‚Äì2008: From September 2006 a new title sequence was introduced, opening with the traditional Blue Peter ship logo, followed by the presenters surrounded by \\"fact file boxes\\" displaying statistics and information about them and also pictures of the pets and snippets of previous assignment films. This also marked the end of the traditional format of the presenter credits being credited in order of seniority (although this is likely to be down to the stylistic dictation of the titles in their \\"girl boy girl boy\\" arrangement ‚Äì the only irregularity being Gethin Jones appearing before Z√∂e Salmon who debuted on the show five months before him). As in previous years, this new graphical sequence precedes a \\"coming up\\" sequence or, alternatively, footage of that edition's filming assignment. From September 2007 the posed portion of the same opening titles followed a \\"coming up\\" clip of that day's programme and used a new theme tune to accompany it. Following Konnie Huq's departure in January 2008, the order of the opening sequence was rejigged slightly, with a filmed aerial pan of a cliff-face taken from a helicopter, featuring a lighthouse and large-scale impression of the Blue Peter ship on a grass lawn adjacent to it. The \\"chopper\\" sound of the helicopter's propellers imitates the traditional drum roll of the Blue Peter theme tune. The sequence then merges into a summary of what's coming up on the programme, with a quick cut at the end to the remaining three presenter poses, now having reverted to appearance order, i.e., Z√∂e > Gethin > Andy, before ending with the 2006‚Äì2008 logo board, minus Konnie's silhouette. 2008‚Äì2009: This era of Blue Peter titles see a return to the original format without posing presenters. Instead, a fast moving graphical approach is taken where the main colour is light blue. The logo board with the new look word logo appears at the end and graphically 'flows' away to reveal the day's programme. 2008 sees a new word mark for the first time since 1999 and some of the detail has been altered on the ship logo ‚Äì for example, a return to the original flag design. Small changes have also featured in the studio where the mezzanine wall is now red, the big screen has a new frame and the seating has been re-jigged slightly. 2009‚Äì2011: In the same style to the 2008 titles; however, the presenters' pictures and first names were now featured in the titles, following the 'coming up' section. 2011‚Äì2013: The new Blue Peter titles were created by Mighty Giant. The titles were meant to capture the essence of the show in 20 short seconds. The sequence Mighty Giant created had the presenters playing and throwing an object that changes throughout. As it transforms it captures another element of Blue Peter. These objects include for Helen, the Blue Peter adventure box, Technology screen and a ball. Barney's elements of Blue Peter in the titles include a globe, a piece of gaming technology and a keyboard. Mighty Giant shot the presenters against a green screen and then combined them with 3d objects back at its Northern Quarter base to create the desired effect. The logo also had a make over with the ship being put into a blue circle and the original designed ship in white inside the circle. The writing is the same as the 2008 logo. 2013‚Äì2015: In 2013, the sequence had been replaced by a series of clips of previous programme activities. 2015‚Äìpresent: In 2015, the sequence has a colourful graphics with rainbow lines, as well as the letters of the logo and the Blue Peter ship logo were floating around in the titles. This sequence is designed by Liquid. It looks similar to the 1999‚Äì2004 and 2004‚Äì2006 ones. General notes: The opening titles of every programme featured the list of the presenters in order of their first appearance on Blue Peter, regardless of whether they actually appear in the edition in question (after 1995 and the introduction of the fourth presenter it was unusual to have all four presenters in the studio at the same time, save for special programmes). The only time this rule was not adopted is when the programme is a special pre-recorded assignment ‚Äì for example a visit to a foreign country by two of the presenters, in which case the usual practice is just to credit the presenters appearing. Until 2004, the presenters were always credited by their full names. From September 2004, the opening titles only featured their first names, perhaps in a move to make the presenters appear more accessible to the audience. From September 2008, the titles went back to traditional style, not including presenters or their names. This however was changed again in 2009, when pictures of the presenters popped out from nowhere with their name by the side of them. For the new Technology themed titles for September 2011, the presenters Helen and Barney appeared with specially shot sequences. The names however did not make a return. For the first time the presenters were interacting with different objects in the titles. =Closing credits= 1958‚Äì1992: The Blue Peter closing credits were put on screen over the final moments of the programme to the sound of the closing theme tune. Alternatively, once the programme had officially ended (i.e., the presenters had said their \\"goodbyes\\") the camera would focus on shots of the pets or aspects of the studio as a calmer backdrop against which to flash up the credits. The sequence would always end with the Blue Peter ship filling the screen (originally a simple flat image, latterly a more graphically interesting incarnation) and BBC copyright blurb. Before 1989 the \\"Editor\\" credit (for almost all this period it was Biddy Baxter) would also flash up over the final moments of the programme, but since Lewis Bronze's promotion the editor credit was saved for the final ship frame. 1992‚Äì2003: Once again during this period the credits maintained the practice of appearing during the final seconds of the programme's presentation or once the script had finished. The major difference was that the text scrolled along the bottom third of the screen from right to left, usually overlaid on a graphical bar in the style of the opening titles. The exception to this rule was when the programme was on permanent Outside Broadcast for the whole show. During these occasions the same \\"theme\\" of credits would be used ‚Äì i.e. the same graphics and background etc. but the typeface would almost always change to a completely different font and colour, regardless of the regular typeface used at the time. Also, the credits would flash up on screen one by one, as opposed to scrolling. It is unknown why these anomalies occurred, but it is likely to be related to the reduced technical abilities whilst transmitting a live O.B. The final frame of the credits was always the Blue Peter ship as displayed in the opening titles of the time and the editor's credit, along with BBC branding. 2004‚Äì2007: This period saw a sequence which showed flashed up credits along the bottom third of the screen, whilst a photo of a recent Blue Peter badge winner, with or without the project that won them their badge, was shown above. One of the presenters' voices was also heard introducing the winner and explaining what they did to win their badge. Occasionally on certain programmes, for example the launch of an appeal, special guests in the studio or when out on location, the credits ran as pre-2004 over the closing moments of the programme with the music fading in. Again, the credits end with the Blue Peter ship, editor and BBC credit. 2004, 2007‚Äì2008: Early in 2004, the producers experimented with flashing up the credits over a background of \\"on the next Blue Peter\\" type footage. This was discarded later in 2004 when the new arrangement of signature tune and titles were introduced and a revised format was adopted that remained in use until 2007. September 2007 saw a return to the \\"coming up next time\\" sequence of footage, with credits text overlaid on a graphical bar at the bottom section of the screen. The same ship and editor credit is used as the final frame. 2008‚Äìpresent: There are no closing crew credits; instead, the programme ends with a five-second caption of Blue Peter and the CBBC logo. General notes: The exceptions to the above were during the Christmas programme, when the credits still scrolled from right to left, often with Christmassy themed drawings separating each crew member. Until 2006, and again from 2010, the Christmas programme ends on a view of the children carol singers in the studio in the background, the Nativity scene in the foreground, studio lights dimmed, a star of Bethlehem glowing on the cyclorama and a sparkling silver Blue Peter ship overlaid on the screen (although the sparkling ship did not appear in the Christmas 2012 and 2013 editions). When a \\"make\\" was featured in the programme, the creator of the item (invariably the retired Margaret Parnell or Gillian Shearing) was credited first (until credits were discontinued in 2008). An example of this would be \\"Dolls House make by Margaret Parnell\\". Controversy =Presenters sacked= In October 1998, Richard Bacon became the first presenter to have his contract terminated mid-run, after he admitted to taking cocaine and punching a wall, following reports in a tabloid newspaper. Lorraine Heggessey, then the Head of BBC Children's programmes, apologised on air. However, before Bacon, four previous presenters had left the programme when their contracts were not renewed, each for different reasons: these were Leila Williams in 1962, Christopher Wenner in 1980, Michael Sundin in 1985 and Romana D'Annunzio in 1998. =Fake phone competition winner= It was revealed by the BBC that a phone-in competition supporting the UNICEF \\"Shoe Biz Appeal\\", held on 27 November 2006, was rigged. The person who appeared to be calling in the competition was actually a Blue Peter Team Player who was visiting that day. The visitor pretended to be a caller from an outside line who had won the phone-in and the chance to select a prize. The competition was rigged due to a technical error with receiving the calls. Former editor Biddy Baxter, described as still being influential with the programme today, described the problem as an issue with a member of the production team on the studio floor and the Editor being oblivious to the situation in the studio gallery. She also went on to say that the programme would not feature premium rate telephone competitions in the future. It was announced on 16 May 2007 that Blue Peter editor and unofficial historian, Richard Marson, stood down from his job, although any link to the controversy of March 2007 remains in doubt. In July 2007, Blue Peter was given a ¬£50,000 fine, by the Office of Communications (OFCOM) as a result of rigging the competition. =Political partiality= In August 2007 while the programme was off air for its annual Summer Expedition, long-time presenter Konnie Huq was involved in a press conference to promote the health benefits of cycling along with Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone. The Conservative Party accused the BBC of political bias as a result of one of its employees appearing at what was construed as a pro-Labour Party event. The BBC claimed to have turned down the offer for Huq to appear, but this was unknown to both her and her agent. On 24 November 1988, Frank Ruse, a left-wing Labour councillor for Liverpool City Council, accompanied Liverpool's Pagoda Chinese Youth Orchestra to London for an appearance on Blue Peter. He was given a Blue Peter badge and wore it proudly to his council meetings. However, he received a BBC headed letter requesting the return of the badge. The letter (which was later discovered to be a forgery) stated that Blue Peter had been approached by Neil Kinnock's office (Labour leader at the time) who were alarmed that a councillor with hard-left views had been given a Blue Peter badge. On receiving the Blue Peter badge from Frank Ruse, the BBC wrote back to him stating that they had sent no such letter (thereby proving it was a hoax) and an angry Ruse started a local and national enquiry to find out who sent the hoax letter. =\\"Socks\\"= In September 2007, an online vote on the BBC's Blue Peter official website took place to choose the name of the new Blue Peter kitten in January ‚Äì the reported story was that, instead of calling the cat \\"Cookie\\" as chosen by a majority of the votes, the staff overruled the vote and called the kitten \\"Socks\\", citing problems with the voting system and a large surge in the former name. As a result of negative media coverage, the original cat, Socks, was joined by another kitten named Cookie, as had been chosen in the online vote. The BBC broadcast an apology on 25 September 2007 at the start of the new series. Tributes, honours and awards In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, voted for by industry professionals, Blue Peter was placed 6th. In 1992, Blue Peter won the BAFTA for Best Children's Programme (Factual): Lewis Bronze. In 2008, Blue Peter was nominated for the BAFTA Children's Kids Vote Award. Asteroid 16197 Bluepeter is named in its honour. The asteroid was discovered on 7 January 2000, the day that the Blue Peter time capsules from 1971 and 1984 were unearthed.

They are far lighter and thinner than traditional cathode ray tube (CRT) television sets and are usually less than thick. Flat- panel displays can be divided into two display device categories: volatile and static. Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically electronically refreshed to retain their state (e.g. liquid-crystal displays (LCD)). A volatile display only shows an image when it has battery or AC mains power. Static flat-panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable (e.g., e-book reader tablets from Sony), and as such, flat-panel displays retain the text or images on the screen even when the power is off. As of 2016, flat-panel displays have almost completely replaced old CRT displays. In many 2010-era applications, specifically small portable devices such as laptops, mobile phones, smartphones, digital cameras, camcorders, point-and- shoot cameras, and pocket video cameras, any display disadvantages of flat- panels (as compared with CRTs) are made up for by portability advantages (low power consumption from batteries, thinness and lightweightness). Most 2010s-era flat-panel displays use LCD and/or light emitting diode (LED) technologies. Most LCD screens are back-lit as color filters are used to display colors. Flat-panel displays are thin, lightweight, provide better linearity and are capable of higher resolution than typical consumer-grade TVs from earlier eras. The highest resolution for consumer-grade CRT TVs was 1080i; in contrast, many flat-panels can display 1080p or even 4K resolution. As of 2016, some devices that use flat-panels, such as tablet computers, smartphones and, less commonly, laptops, use touchscreens, a feature that enables users to select onscreen icons or trigger actions (e.g., playing a digital video) by touching the screen. Many touchscreen-enabled devices can display a virtual QWERTY or numeric keyboard on the screen, to enable the user to type words or numbers. A multifunctional monitor (MFM) is a flat-panel display that has additional video inputs (more than a typical LCD monitor) and is designed to be used with a variety of external video sources, such as VGA input, HDMI input from capable equipped VHS VCR or video game console and, in some cases, a USB input or card reader for viewing digital photos. In many instances, an MFM also includes a TV tuner, making it similar to a LCD TV that offers computer connectivity. History The first engineering proposal for a flat-panel TV was by General Electric in 1954 as a result of its work on radar monitors. The publication of their findings gave all the basics of future flat-panel TVs and monitors. But GE did not continue with the R&D; required and never built a working flat panel at that time.\\"Proposed Television Sets Would Feature Thin Screens.\\" Popular Mechanics, November 1954, p. 111. The first production flat-panel display was the Aiken tube, developed in the early 1950s and produced in limited numbers in 1958. This saw some use in military systems as a heads up display and as an oscilloscope monitor, but conventional technologies overtook its development. Attempts to commercialize the system for home television use ran into continued problems and the system was never released commercially.William Ross Aiken, \\"History of the Kaiser-Aiken, thin cathode ray tube\\", IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices, Volume 31 Issue 11 (November 1984), pp. 1605-1608. The Philco Predicta featured a relatively flat (for its day) cathode ray tube setup and would be the first commercially released \\"flat panel\\" upon its launch in 1958; the Predicta was a commercial failure. The plasma display panel was invented in 1964 at the University of Illinois, according to The History of Plasma Display Panels.Plasma TV Science.org - The History of Plasma Display Panels =LCD displays= The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor, or MOS transistor) was invented by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and presented in 1960. Building on their work, Paul K. Weimer at RCA developed the thin-film transistor (TFT) in 1962. It was a type of MOSFET distinct from the standard bulk MOSFET. The idea of a TFT-based LCD was conceived by Bernard J. Lechner of RCA Laboratories in 1968. B.J. Lechner, F.J. Marlowe, E.O. Nester and J. Tults demonstrated the concept in 1968 with a dynamic scattering LCD that used standard discrete MOSFETs. The first active-matrix addressed electroluminescent display (ELD) was made using TFTs by T. Peter Brody's Thin- Film Devices department at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1968. In 1973, Brody, J. A. Asars and G. D. Dixon at Westinghouse Research Laboratories demonstrated the first thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display (TFT LCD). Brody and Fang-Chen Luo demonstrated the first flat active-matrix liquid- crystal display (AM LCD) using TFTs in 1974. By 1982, pocket LCD TVs based on LCD technology were developed in Japan. The 2.1-inch Epson ET-10 Epson Elf was the first color LCD pocket TV, released in 1984. In 1988, a Sharp research team led by engineer T. Nagayasu demonstrated a 14-inch full-color LCD display, which convinced the electronics industry that LCD would eventually replace CRTs as the standard television display technology. , all modern high- resolution and high-quality electronic visual display devices use TFT-based active-matrix displays. =LED displays= The first usable LED display was developed by Hewlett-Packard (HP) and introduced in 1968. It was the result of research and development (R&D;) on practical LED technology between 1962 and 1968, by a research team under Howard C. Borden, Gerald P. Pighini, and Mohamed M. Atalla, at HP Associates and HP Labs. In February 1969, they introduced the HP Model 5082-7000 Numeric Indicator. It was the first alphanumeric LED display, and was a revolution in digital display technology, replacing the Nixie tube for numeric displays and becoming the basis for later LED displays. In 1977, James P Mitchell prototyped and later demonstrated what was perhaps the earliest monochromatic flat panel LED television display. Ching W. Tang and Steven Van Slyke at Eastman Kodak built the first practical organic LED (OLED) device in 1987. In 2003, Hynix produced an organic EL driver capable of lighting in 4,096 colors. In 2004, the Sony Qualia 005 was the first LED-backlit LCD display. The Sony XEL-1, released in 2007, was the first OLED television.Sony XEL-1:The world's first OLED TV , OLED-Info.com (2008-11-17). Common types =Liquid crystal display (LCD)= An LCD screen used as an information display for travellers. LCDs are lightweight, compact, portable, cheap, more reliable, and easier on the eyes than CRT screens. LCD screens use a thin layer of liquid crystal, a liquid that exhibits crystalline properties. It is sandwiched between two electrically conducting plates. The top plate has transparent electrodes deposited on it, and the back plate is either fitted with a reflector or is illuminated from behind so that the viewer can see the images on the screen. By applying controlled electrical signals across the plates, various segments of the liquid crystal can be activated, causing changes in their light diffusing or polarizing properties. These segments can either transmit or block light. An image is produced by passing light through selected segments of the liquid crystal to the viewer. They are used in various electronics like watches, calculators, and notebook computers. =LCD with backlit light-emitting diode (LED)= Some LCD screens are back-lit with a number of LEDs. LEDs are two- lead semiconductor light sources. The image is still generated by the LCD. LED-backlit LCD displays are the most prevalent in the 2010s. =Plasma panel= A plasma display consists of two glass plates separated by a thin gap filled with a gas such as neon. Each of these plates has several parallel electrodes running across it. The electrodes on the two plates are at right angles to each other. A voltage applied between the two electrodes one on each plate causes a small segment of gas at the two electrodes to glow. The glow of gas segments is maintained by a lower voltage that is continuously applied to all electrodes. By 2010, consumer plasma displays had been discontinued by numerous manufacturers. =Electroluminescent panel= In an electroluminescent display (ELD), the image is created by applying electrical signals to the plates which makes the phosphor glow. =Organic light-emitting diode= An OLED (organic light-emitting diode) is a light-emitting diode (LED) in which the emissive electroluminescent layer is a film of organic compound which emits light in response to an electric current. This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes; typically, at least one of these electrodes is transparent. OLEDs are used to create digital displays in devices such as television screens, computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs. =Quantum dot light emitting diode= QLED or quantum dot LED is a flat panel display technology introduced by Samsung under this trademark. Other television set manufacturers such as Sony have used the same technology to enhance the backlighting of LCD TVs already in 2013.CES 2015 placing bets on new TV technologies. IEEE Spectrum, January 7, 2015. Retrieved October 21, 2017LG leaps quantum dot rivals with new TV. CNET, December 16, 2014. Retrieved October 21, 2017 Quantum dots create their own unique light when illuminated by a light source of shorter wavelength such as blue LEDs. This type of LED TV enhances the color gamut of LCD panels, where the image is still generated by the LCD. In the view of Samsung, quantum dot displays for large-screen TVs are expected to become more popular than the OLED displays in the coming years; Firms like Nanoco and Nanosys compete to provide the QD materials. In the meantime, Samsung Galaxy devices such as smartphones are still equipped with OLED displays manufactured by Samsung as well. Samsung explain on their website that the QLED TV they produce can determine what part of the display needs more or less contrast. Samsung also announced a partnership with Microsoft that will promote the new Samsung QLED TV. Volatile A large LED display at the Taipei Arena displays commercials and movie trailers. Volatile displays require that pixels be periodically refreshed to retain their state, even for a static image. As such, a volatile screen needs electrical power, either from mains electricity (being plugged into a wall socket) or a battery to maintain an image on the display or change the image. This refresh typically occurs many times a second. If this is not done, for example, if there is a power outage, the pixels will gradually lose their coherent state, and the image will \\"fade\\" from the screen. =Examples= The following flat- display technologies have been commercialized in 1990s to 2010s: * Plasma display panel (PDP) * Active-matrix liquid-crystal display (AMLCD) * Rear projection: Digital Light Processing (DLP), LCD, LCOS * Electronic paper: E Ink, Gyricon * Light-emitting diode display (LED) * Active-matrix organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) * Quantum dot display (QLED) Technologies that were extensively researched, but their commercialization was limited or has been ultimately abandoned: * Active-matrix electroluminescent display (ELD) * Interferometric modulator display (IMOD) * Field emission display (FED) * Surface-conduction electron-emitter display (SED, SED-TV) Static Kindle Keyboard e-reader displaying a page of an e-book. The Kindle's image of the book's text will remain onscreen even if the battery runs out, as it is a static screen technology. Without power, however, the user cannot change to a new page. Static flat-panel displays rely on materials whose color states are bistable. This means that the image they hold requires no energy to maintain, but instead requires energy to change. This results in a much more energy-efficient display, but with a tendency toward slow refresh rates which are undesirable in an interactive display. Bistable flat-panel displays are beginning deployment in limited applications (cholesteric liquid crystal displays, manufactured by Magink, in outdoor advertising; electrophoretic displays in e-book reader devices from Sony and iRex; anlabels; interferometric modulator displays in a smartwatch).

He served from 1905 to 1906. A glassware and china merchant, he was a President of the Vancouver Board of Trade in 1900. Buscombe was born in 1862 in Bodmin, Cornwall, England, to Edwin and Isabella Oliver Grilles Buscombe. He immigrated to Canada with his family in 1870, settling near Hamilton, Ontario, where his father became a builder. He first worked in Hamilton from 1878 to James A. Skinner & Company, a glassware and china company, as a travelling salesman from 1878 to 1891. In 1891, his job with the company brought him west to Vancouver, where he established an office with his brother, George. Prior to 1891, he visited the Vancouver area twice, in 1884 and 1886. He served as a partner of the company in Vancouver until 1899, when he bought out the company, and established Frederick Buscombe & Co. Ltd. china, glassware and earthenware with his brother, which grew to be one of the largest businesses of the kind in the Canadian West. He was also president of the Pacific Coast Lumber & Sawmills Company, and director of the Pacific Marine Insurance Company. In 1899, he commissioned the Buscombe Building, located at 342 Water Street & 403 West Cordova Street, in Gastown, Vancouver, which is now the site of a restaurant and various businesses. Buscombe was elected Mayor of Vancouver in 1905. During the election, he advocated for improved financial management within the municipal affairs, earning support from three newspapers, and many businessmen. He served two terms, until 1906. During his mayoralty, he helped develop the Greater Vancouver Water Board. The city council also passed a motion to request suspension of immigration of East Indians to Vancouver due to public discontent of immigrants working in the growing amount construction jobs. Buscombe served as president of Vancouver's Board of Trade from 1900 to 1901, and as president of the Vancouver Tourist Association in 1901. A Mason, he was also a member of the Vancouver Club, Royal Vancouver Yacht Club, Terminal City Club, Jericho Country Club, and the Sons of England Society.

He married Catherine MacIntosh of Paisley, Ontario in 1878, and they had two daughters. A Presbyterian church, Bethune enjoyed hunting, fishing and motoring as hobbies. He was also a Freemason and founding member of Acacia Lodge No. 22. Career After completing his education in Ontario, he moved to Manitou, Manitoba in 1887 where he entered the hardware business. He also served as postmaster of Manitou as well as on the city council as an alderman. He moved further west in 1890, to Vancouver. In Vancouver he would establish a shoe store, Mills & Bethune, operating from 1896 to 1900, when he entered the building business. Bethune was elected to Vancouver City Council in 1900 and served until 1907, when he was elected mayor. He was also the head of the Electoral Union slate. During the election, which was at the time overshadowed by the ongoing provincial election, the main issue of contention was whether to have a stop in the city along the Vancouver Westminster and Yukon Railway. During his term, he was faced with the September 1907 Vancouver riots in which he permitted demonstrators from the Asiatic Exclusion League to hold a rally at city hall in which speeches were delivered in support of the prohibition of Asian immigration to the city. Bethune was also a founder, paying member and ardent supporter of the organization. After the city hall rally, the crowd descended upon Vancouver's Chinatown and Japantown, continuing protests, smashing windows and even beating residents. Bethune would later express regret about the riot and urged citizens to use moderation.Aftermath of the anti-Asian riots - Source Docs Bethune was also against the immigration of Indians, prohibiting them from settling in Vancouver during his term in 1907.

See John of Cappadocia. John the Cappadocian () (fl. 530s, living 548) was a praetorian prefect of the East (532‚Äì541) in the Byzantine Empire under Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565). He was also a patrician and the consul ordinarius of 538.. Biography Both John the Lydian and Zacharias Rhetor report that John was a native of Caesarea, Cappadocia. Procopius, John Malalas, the Chronicon Paschale, and Zacharias called him \\"John the Cappadocian\\" for disambiguation reasons, as the name John (Ioannes in Greek and Johannes in Latin) was widely used by his time. John the Lydian and John Malalas at times mention him only as \\"the Cappadocian\\". His family connections are obscure and only two relatives are known with certainty. Those are his only daughter Euphemia and a kinsman called Ioannes Maxilloplumacius. =Rise to power= His contemporary historians were biased against him, particularly Procopius and John the Lydian, and their accounts are often coloured by their prejudices. Procopius calls John poorly educated, though he grudgingly admits the Cappadocian's great natural abilities led to his rise to prominence. He first appears in the sources as a scriniarius (notary) in the service of an unidentified magister militum. His administrative ideas reportedly attracted the attention of Emperor Justinian, resulting in his promotion to positions with financial responsibilities. From there, he gained enough favour to become a vir illustris and eventually the acting Prefect. There is a theory that his close relationship with Emperor Justinian may date to Justinian's service as magister militum praesentalis in the 520s, prior to his elevation to the Byzantine throne.

The new taxes were very unpopular, and the mob involved in the Nika riots of 532 demanded that both John the Cappadocian and the quaestor sacri palatii Tribonian be dismissed. Emperor Justinian did so, until the riots had been suppressed, after which he reinstated John as prefect and Tribonian as quaestor. After the riots, which had been supported by upper- class Senators, John, who had the same lower-class background as Justinian, became even more important in political affairs. John influenced Emperor Justinian's military decisions, helping to draft the Eternal Peace with Khosrau I of Persia (531‚Äì579) and convincing Justinian not to empty the treasury with a large expedition against the Vandal kingdom in North Africa. John worked with the Byzantine emperor to reduce the size of the bureaucracy, both in Constantinople and in the provinces, developing a rudimentary meritocracy. Zacharias reports that the Cappadocian was widely feared for his influence on Emperor Justinian and a tendency to bring accusations against many people. He was reportedly aided by several flatterers in his service. John the Lydian reports that the Cappadocian constructed a prison within the Praetorium of Constantinople. There, prisoners were regularly tortured and executed. John the Lydian asserts that the Cappadocian extracted money from his victims and gives an eyewitness testimony to the execution of one such victim.. John the Lydian goes on to report other changes to life in the Praetorium. The Cappadocian transferred his quarters upstairs, offering the traditional living quarters of the Prefect to his followers. The Prefect reportedly treated his official staff as common slaves. He converted the baths of the Praetorium to a stable for his horses, building a new elevated bathroom for himself equipped with fountains. He reportedly used his official residence to give lavish feasts and indulge \\"in all manners of debaucheries\\" while maintaining a luxurious private residence at the same time. Procopius seems to agree, reporting that the Cappadocian would spend his mornings robbing the taxpayers, devoting the rest of the day to \\"unrestrained debauchery\\". Procopius also claims that John employed thousands of bodyguards to ensure his security. =Downfall and exile= John the Cappadocian's downfall seems to have been the result of an ongoing rivalry with Empress Theodora and general Belisarius. He was considered a rival of Theodora for independent, unique and great influence with Emperor Justinian; At that time the influence of both on the emperor was in fact so great that they became very hostile to each other and each supposedly accused the other to him, so that they can influence the government alone. Belisarius had reportedly gained much popular support following his return from the Gothic War and the Cappadocian considered him another rival favorite. According to Procopius, Theodora and Antonina, wife of Belisarius, allied against the Prefect. Antonina arranged a private meeting with John, supposedly to conspire against Justinian. John agreed to meet her at the palace of Rufinianae near Chalcedon, reportedly violating a direct order by Justinian to avoid secret meetings with Antonina. Their supposedly private conversation was actually overheard by Marcellus and Narses, as pre- arranged by the two women.. Marcellus and Narses were ordered by Theodora to kill John if he spoke out in favor of treason. In the ensuing scuffle, however, John escaped and fled to a church, while Marcellus was wounded by one of John's guards. John was removed from office immediately after and banished to Cyzicus.; . Theodotus succeeded John as praetorian prefect in late May or early June 541. A continuation of Marcellinus Comes reports that the private residence of John at Constantinople passed to the ownership of Belisarius. The Cappadocian was ordained a priest against his will, and he reportedly avoided practicing his priesthood in fear that this would ruin his chances for a return to power. His wealth was confiscated, but Justinian was reluctant to be overly harsh to his old favourite and restored part of John's private property to him at a later date. Procopius noted that John remained wealthy enough to live a life of luxury, but his troubles were not over. He was hostile to his new superior, Eusebius, Bishop of Cyzicus, and when Eusebius was murdered, the Cappadocian found himself accused of complicity in the crime.. John was imprisoned, his captors beating him to produce a confession. His guilt was not established, but his wealth was again confiscated. This time Justinian was much harsher to him. His new place of exile was Antinoe in Egypt. He was transported there by ship, forced to only wear a cheap cloak and earn his living as a beggar at every stop on the way. Procopius wrote his account on the third year of John's exile, that is in 544. John still didn't lose his hopes for restoration to power. He had taken to accusing various citizens of Alexandria for tax avoidance. Procopius notes Theodora's continued efforts to put John on trial for murder, but the residents of Cyzicus would not testify against him.. In 548, Theodora died, and Justinian recalled John to Constantinople. However, the Cappadocian never returned to political power and was not allowed to resign his unwanted priesthood. John Malalas notes that the Cappadocian died peacefully at Constantinople some time later. His contemporary historians acknowledge his ability to identify problems and produce solutions, but decry his wickedness, greed, and the way he squandered his wealth. =Cultural Depiction= John is the main antagonist of Theodora, Slave Empress, a 1954 sword and sandal film depicting Justinian's early reign.

Corporate actions are typically agreed upon by a company's board of directors and authorized by the shareholders. For some events, shareholders or bondholders are permitted to vote on the event. Examples of corporate actions include stock splits, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, rights issues, and spin-offs. Some corporate actions such as a dividend (for equity securities) or coupon payment (for debt securities) may have a direct financial impact on the shareholders or bondholders; another example is a call (early redemption) of a debt security. Other corporate actions such as stock split may have an indirect financial impact, as the increased liquidity of shares may cause the price of the stock to decrease. Some corporate actions, such as name changes or ticker symbol changes to better reflect a company's business focus, have no direct financial impact on the shareholders; securities may be listed under a different security identifier (e.g. ISIN, CUSIP, Sedol) however. For example, \\"Apple Computers\\" changed its name to Apple Inc.  Overview  =Types= There are three types of corporate actions: voluntary, mandatory, and mandatory with choice. * Mandatory corporate action: A mandatory corporate action is an event initiated by the board of directors of the corporation that affects all shareholders. Participation of shareholders are mandatory for these corporate actions. An example of a mandatory corporate action is cash dividend. A shareholder does not need to act to receive the dividend. Other examples of mandatory corporate actions include stock splits, mergers, pre- refunding, return of capital, bonus issue, asset ID change, and spin-offs. Strictly speaking, the word \\"mandatory\\" is not appropriate because the shareholder is not required to do anything; the shareholder is just a passive beneficiary in all the cases cited above. There is nothing the shareholder has to do or does in a Mandatory Corporate Action. * Voluntary corporate action: A voluntary corporate action is an action where the shareholders elect to participate in the action. A response is required for the corporation to process the action. An example of a voluntary corporate action is a tender offer. A corporation may request shareholders to tender their shares at a predetermined price. The shareholder may or may not participate in the tender offer. Shareholders send their responses to the corporation's agents, and the corporation will send the proceeds of the action to the shareholders who elect to participate. * Mandatory with choice corporate action: This corporate action is a mandatory corporate action where shareholders are given a chance to choose among several options. An example is cash or stock dividend option with one of the options as default. Shareholders may or may not submit their elections. In case a shareholder does not submit the election, the default option will be applied. Some market participants use a different method to distinguish the corporate action types. For example, \\"mandatory corporate action\\" and \\"mandatory with choice corporate action\\" may be used together. DTC uses the terms distributions, redemptions and reorganizations. =Purpose= Purpose of corporate actions The primary reasons companies use corporate actions are: * Return profits to shareholders: Cash dividends are a classic example where a public company declares a dividend to be paid on each outstanding share. Bonus is another case where the shareholder is rewarded. In a stricter sense, the bonus issue should not impact the share price but in reality, in rare cases, it does and results in an overall increase in value. * Influence the share price: If the price of a stock is too high or too low, the liquidity of the stock suffers. Stocks priced too high will not be affordable to all investors and stocks priced too low may be delisted. Corporate actions such as stock splits or reverse stock splits increase or decrease the number of outstanding shares to decrease or increase the stock price respectively. Buybacks are another example of influencing the stock price where a corporation buys back shares from the market in an attempt to reduce the number of outstanding shares thereby increasing the price. * Corporate restructuring: Corporations restructure in order to increase profitability. Examples include mergers (where two companies that are competitive or complementary join forces) and spin-offs (where a company breaks itself up in order to focus on its core competencies). =Impact= Beneficial impact of corporate actions As an owner, the impact of a corporate action is usually measured in terms of changes to the securities and/or cash positions, so corporate actions can be divided into two categories: * Benefits: Actions that result in an increase to the position holder‚Äôs securities or cash position, without altering the underlying security. Examples include bonus issues, which is a Mandatory With Options Action/Event. * Reorganizations: Actions that reshape or restructure the beneficial owner's underlying securities position, which sometimes also results in a cash payout. Examples include equity restructures, conversions, and subscriptions. Notification requirement In order to keep investors and the market informed of corporate actions, they need to be announced. For public companies listed on exchanges, the exchanges themselves handle the announcement, notifying shareholders as well as making information about the corporate action available online. For companies that trade in the over-the-counter (OTC) marketplace, U.S. federal securities regulators task Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a self- regulatory organization, with processing the corporate action announcement. The event information flow for public companies where shareholders or bondholders can vote usually involves numerous parties. The information is first announced by the company to the exchange. Financial data vendors collect such information and disseminate it via their own services to banks, institutional investors, financial data processors, and other market participants. In addition, the central securities depository (CSD) of the respective market collects the data and informs the CSD participants holding the respective share or bond in custody about the upcoming corporate action. The CSD sets a deadline for its participants by which the elections must be returned. The CSD participants then further disseminate the information to its clients (e.g. banks, institutional investors or private clients), which in turn must submit their election by the deadline set by the CSD participant.

Museo Nazionale del Bargello h.158 cm 3-D model of the bronze statue (click to rotate) David is the title of two statues of the biblical hero David by the Italian early Renaissance sculptor Donatello. They consist of an early work in marble of a clothed figure (1408‚Äì09), and a far more famous bronze figure that is nude except for helmet and boots, and dates to the 1440s or later. Both are now in the Museo Nazionale del Bargello in Florence.  The biblical text  The story of David and Goliath comes from 1 Samuel 17. The Israelites are fighting the Philistines, whose champion ‚Äì Goliath ‚Äì repeatedly offers to meet the Israelites' best warrior in single combat to decide the whole battle. None of the trained Israelite soldiers is brave enough to fight the giant Goliath, until David ‚Äì a shepherd boy who is too young to be a soldier ‚Äì accepts the challenge. Saul, the Israelite leader, offers David armour and weapons, but the boy is untrained and refuses them. Instead, he goes out with his sling, and confronts the enemy. He hits Goliath in the head with a stone, knocking the giant down, and then grabs Goliath's sword and cuts off his head. The Philistines withdraw as agreed and the Israelites are saved. David's special strength comes from God, and the story illustrates the triumph of good over evil.Frontain, Raymond-Jean and Wojcik, Jan eds. (1980) The David Myth in Western Literature, Purdue University Press, .  The marble David Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence. Height 191 cm. Donatello, then in his early twenties, was commissioned to carve a statue of David in 1408, to top one of the buttresses of Florence Cathedral, though it was never placed there. Nanni di Banco was commissioned to carve a marble statue of Isaiah, at the same scale, in the same year. One of the statues was lifted into place in 1409, but was found to be too small to be easily visible from the ground and was taken down; both statues then languished in the workshop of the opera for several years.Janson, pp. 3‚Äì7Pope-Hennessey, John (1958) Italian Renaissance Sculpture, London, pp. 6‚Äì7Poeschke, p. 27. In 1416, the Signoria of Florence commanded that the David be sent to the Palazzo della Signoria; evidently the young David was seen as an effective political symbol, as well as a religious hero. Donatello was asked to make some adjustments to the statue (perhaps to make him look less like a prophet), and a pedestal with an inscription was made for it: PRO PATRIA FORTITER DIMICANTIBUS ETIAM ADVERSUS TERRIBILISSIMOS HOSTES DII PRAESTANT AUXILIUM (\\"To those who fight bravely for the fatherland the gods lend aid even against the most terrible foes\\").Documents on the statue may be found in Omaggio a Donatello, pp. 126‚Äì127. On the political implications of David for early-modern Florence, see Maria Monica Donato. \\"Hercules and David in the Early Decoration of the Palazzo Vecchio: Manuscript Evidence.\\" Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 54 (1991) 83-98; Andrew Butterfield. ‚ÄùNew Evidence for the Iconography of David in Quattrocento Florence.‚Äù I Tatti Studies 6 (1995) 114‚Äì133. The marble David is Donatello's earliest known important commission, and it is a work closely tied to tradition, giving few signs of the innovative approach to representation that the artist would develop as he matured. Although the positioning of the legs hints at a classical contrapposto, the figure stands in an elegant Gothic sway that surely derives from Lorenzo Ghiberti. The face is curiously blank (that is, if one expects naturalism, but very typical of the International Gothic style), and David seems almost unaware of the head of his vanquished foe that rests between his feet. Some scholars have seen an element of personality ‚Äì a kind of cockiness ‚Äì suggested by the twist of the torso and the akimbo placement of the left arm,Poeschke, p. 377.Omaggio a Donatello, p. 125 but overall the effect of the figure is rather bland. The head of Goliath, lying at David's feet, \\"is carved with great assurance and reveals the young sculptor‚Äôs genuinely Renaissance interest in an ancient Roman type of mature, bearded head\\".Grove  The bronze David  Another view Donatello's bronze statue of David (circa 1440s) is famous as the first unsupported standing work of bronze cast during the Renaissance, and the first freestanding nude male sculpture made since antiquity. It depicts David with an enigmatic smile, posed with his foot on Goliath's severed head just after defeating the giant. The youth is completely naked, apart from a laurel-topped hat and boots, and bears the sword of Goliath. The creation of the work is undocumented. Most scholars assume the statue was commissioned by Cosimo de' Medici, but the date of its creation is unknown and widely disputed; suggested dates vary from the 1420s to the 1460s (Donatello died in 1466), with the majority opinion recently falling in the 1440s, when the new Medici Palace designed by Michelozzo was under construction.Greenhalgh, M. (1982) Donatello and His Sources, London, p. 166. According to one theory, it was commissioned by the Medici family in the 1430s to be placed in the center of the courtyard of the old Medici Palace. Alternatively it may have been made for that position in the new Palazzo Medici, where it was placed later, which would place the commission in the mid-1440s or even later. The statue is only recorded there by 1469. The Medici family were exiled from Florence in 1494, and the statue was moved to the courtyard of the Palazzo della Signoria (the marble David was already in the palazzo). It was moved to the Palazzo Pitti in the 17th century, to the Uffizi in 1777, and then finally, in 1865, to the Museo Nazionale del Bargello, where it remains today.Janson, pp. 77‚Äì78Poeschke, p. 397.Omaggio a Donatello, pp. 196‚Äì197Randolph, Adrian W.B. (2002) Engaging Symbols: Gender, Politics, and Public Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence, New Haven, pp. 139‚Äì141, . Randolph published a poem from 1466 that seems to describe the statue in the Medici palace. According to Vasari, the statue stood on a column designed by Desiderio da Settignano in the middle of the courtyard of the Palazzo Medici; an inscription seems to have explained the statue's significance as a political monument. A quattrocento manuscript containing the text of the inscription is probably an earlier reference to the statue; unfortunately the manuscript is not dated. Although a political meaning for the statue is widely accepted, what that meaning is has been a matter of considerable debate among scholars.Political readings of the David include The iconography of the bronze David follows that of the marble David: a young hero stands with sword in hand, the severed head of his enemy at his feet. Visually, however, this statue is startlingly different. David is both physically delicate and remarkably effeminate. The head has been said to have been inspired by classical sculptures of Antinous, a favourite of Hadrian renowned for his beauty. The statue's physique, contrasted with the large sword in hand, shows that David has overcome Goliath not by physical prowess, but through God. The boy's nakedness further implies the idea of the presence of God, contrasting the youth with the heavily-armoured giant. David is presented uncircumcised, which is customary for male nudes in Italian Renaissance art. = Controversy = Museo Nazionale del Bargello, Florence. There are no indications of contemporary responses to the David. However, the fact that the statue was placed in the town hall of Florence in the 1490s indicates that it was not viewed as controversial. In the early 16th century, the Herald of the Signoria mentioned the sculpture in a way that suggested there was something unsettling about it: \\"The David in the courtyard is not a perfect figure because its right leg is tasteless.\\"Gaye, G. (1840) Carteggio inedito d'artisti dei secoli xiv.xv.xvi., 3 vols., Florence, II: 456: \\"El Davit della corte √® una figura et non √® perfecta, perch√® la gamba sua di drieto √® schiocha.\\" Cited in Shearman, John (1992) Only Connect...Art and the Spectator in the Italian Renaissance, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 22 n. 17. Shearman notes that schiocha could be translated as \\"imprudent\\" or \\"stupid.\\" By mid-century Vasari was describing the statue as so naturalistic that it must have been made from life. However, among 20th- and 21st-century art historians there has been considerable controversy about how to interpret it. Goliath's beard curls around David's sandaled foot, as if the young hero is running his toes through his dead opponent's hair. Goliath is wearing a winged helmet. David's right foot stands firmly on the short right wing, while the left wing, considerably longer, works its way up his right leg to his groin. The figure has been interpreted in a variety of ways. One has been to suggest that Donatello was homosexual and that he was expressing that sexual attitude through this statue.Janson, pp. 77‚Äì86 A second is to suggest that the work refers to homosocial values in Florentine society without expressing Donatello's personal tendencies.Randolph, Adrian W.B. (2002) Engaging Symbols: Gender, Politics, and Public Art in Fifteenth-Century Florence, New Haven, pp. 139‚Äì192, . However, during the Renaissance sodomy was illegal, and over 14,000 men had been tried in Florence for this crime,PBS documentary \\"The Medici\\", 2003 so this homosexual implication would have been dangerous. A third interpretation is that David represents Donatello's effort to create a unique version of the male nude, to exercise artistic licence rather than copy the classical models that had thus far been the sources for the depiction of the male nude in Renaissance art.Poeschke, p. 398. =Change in identification= Detail of the base The traditional identification of the figure was first questioned in 1939 by Jeno Lanyi, with an interpretation leaning toward ancient mythology, the hero's helmet especially suggesting Hermes. A number of scholars over the last 70 years have followed Lanyi, sometimes referring to the statue as David-Mercury.Lanyi never published his hypothesis; his ideas were made public in John Pope-Hennessey (1984) ‚ÄúDonatello‚Äôs Bronze David,\\" Scritti di storia dell‚Äôarte in onore di Federico Zeri Milan: Electa, pp. 122‚Äì127, and further developed in Paroncchi, Alessandro (1980) Donatello e il potere, Florence, pp. 101‚Äì115 and Fossi, G. et al. (2000) Italian Art, Florence, p. 91. If the figure were indeed meant to represent Mercury, it may be supposed that he stands atop the head of the vanquished giant Argus Panoptes. However, this identification is certainly mistaken; all quattrocento references to the statue identify it as David.Shearman, John (1992) Only Connect...Art and the Spectator in the Italian Renaissance, Princeton: Princeton University Press, pp. 20‚Äì21, . =Restoration= The statue underwent restoration from June 2007 to November 2008. This was the first time the statue had ever been restored, but concerns about layers of \\"mineralised waxings\\" on the surface of the bronze led to the 18-month intervention. The statue was scraped with scalpels (on the non-gilded areas) and lasered (on the gilded areas) to remove surface build-up.Il Restauro del David di Donatello. Museo Nazionale del Bargello. polomuseale.firenze.it (in Italian) = Copies and influence = There is a full-size plaster cast (with a broken sword) in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.

In addition to the copies in the United Kingdom, there is also another copy at the Slater Museum at the Norwich Free Academy in Norwich, Connecticut, United States. David continued to be a subject of great interest for Italian patrons and artists. Later representations of the Biblical hero include Antonio del Pollaiuolo's David (Berlin, Staatliche Museen, c. 1470, panel painting), Verrocchio's David (Florence, Bargello, 1470s, bronze), Domenico Ghirlandaio's David (Florence, S.

There are at least two distinct, but overlapping meanings. Other uses of the word \\"character\\" are almost always qualified. Multiplicative character A multiplicative character (or linear character, or simply character) on a group G is a group homomorphism from G to the multiplicative group of a field , usually the field of complex numbers. If G is any group, then the set Ch(G) of these morphisms forms an abelian group under pointwise multiplication. This group is referred to as the character group of G. Sometimes only unitary characters are considered (thus the image is in the unit circle); other such homomorphisms are then called quasi-characters. Dirichlet characters can be seen as a special case of this definition. Multiplicative characters are linearly independent, i.e. if \\\\chi_1,\\\\chi_2, \\\\ldots , \\\\chi_n are different characters on a group G then from a_1\\\\chi_1+a_2\\\\chi_2 + \\\\ldots + a_n \\\\chi_n = 0 it follows that a_1=a_2=\\\\cdots=a_n=0 . Character of a representation The character \\\\chi : G \\\\rightarrow F of a representation \\\\phi \\\\colon G\\\\to\\\\mathrm{GL}(V) of a group G on a finite-dimensional vector space V over a field F is the trace of the representation \\\\phi , i.e. \\\\chi_\\\\phi(g) = Tr(\\\\phi(g)) for g \\\\in G In general, the trace is not a group homomorphism, nor does the set of traces form a group. The characters of one-dimensional representations are identical to one-dimensional representations, so the above notion of multiplicative character can be seen as a special case of higher- dimensional characters. The study of representations using characters is called \\"character theory\\" and one dimensional characters are also called \\"linear characters\\" within this context. =Alternative definition= If restricted to Finite Abelian Group with 1 \\\\times 1 representation in \\\\mathbb{C} (i.e. GL(V) = GL(1, \\\\mathbb{C})), the following alternative definition would be equivalent to the above (For Abelian groups, every matrix representation decomposes into a direct sum of 1 \\\\times 1 representations. For non-Abelian group, the original definition would be more general than this one): A character \\\\chi of Group (G, \\\\cdot) is a mapping \\\\chi: G \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{C} such that \\\\chi (x \\\\cdot y)=\\\\chi (x) \\\\chi (y) for all x, y \\\\in G If G is a finite Abelian group, the characters play the role of harmonics.

Publication history The title of the book was taken from a now-forgotten Western titled The Banditti of the Range. It is written from the perspective of Mercer, who had come to Wyoming to edit the North West Live Stock Journal, the official publication of the Wyoming Stock Growers Association (WSGA), which represented the monied interests intent on controlling the cattle industry. As the events of the range wars unfolded, Mercer came to sympathize with the homesteaders and turned against the WSGA. The book reflects his pro-settler view and is an important document of the events. The first edition of the book is one of the rarities of western Americana. Immediately after it was printed, the Wyoming cattlemen objected and sued. The court ordered it destroyed. While the books were in the court's custody, a number were stolen and smuggled to Denver and later bound. For many years, the Wyoming Stockgrowers' Association, their sympathizers, and their descendants destroyed every copy they came across. Surviving copies are rare, and in 2016 copies were listed for prices between $1,250 and $6000. The second edition simply disappeared somewhere between Denver, Colorado, and Cheyenne, Wyoming, and the Wyoming Stock Growers Association was rumored to have hijacked and destroyed the second printing as it was being shipped. Mercer saw his printing press in Cheyenne burned down; he was harassed, arrested, jailed and had the plates of his book destroyed. His writings were seized in the mails as obscenity; his business was ruined. Mercer's main views of the Johnson County War were ultimately proved true, and never again did the cattle barons attempt to invade Wyoming. Thanks to republication in 1954 by the University of Oklahoma Press, with a foreword by William H. Kittrell, the first edition text is now readily available, having appeared in paperback in 1976.

He continued to teach and also became active in politics. Murphy is best known as the only delegate to have repeatedly voted against secession at the second Arkansas Secession Convention in 1861. Having served in local offices and the State House, Murphy was elected as governor in a special election after the US Army occupied Arkansas in 1863 under President Abraham Lincoln. He is considered the first Reconstruction governor of Arkansas, as he was allowed to stay in office after the Reconstruction Acts were passed by Congress in 1867. Murphy was known for his fiscal restraint and a conciliatory attitude toward former Confederates. Biography Murphy was born near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania to a wealthy paper manufacturer and his wife. He was educated locally and at Washington College (now Washington & Jefferson College) in Washington, Pennsylvania. He was admitted to the bar in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania on April 29, 1825. In 1830, Murphy moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, where he taught school. There he met and wed Angelina Lockhart on July 31, 1830. Her father so opposed the marriage when he learned that Murphy favored the abolition of slavery that he disinherited Angelina. In 1834, the Murphys, with their newborn daughter, moved west to Fayetteville in the Arkansas Territory. In Fayetteville, Murphy established himself as a school teacher, surveyor, and lawyer. The territory was admitted as a state in 1836. Career Murphy became active in politics, elected as the first county treasurer of Washington County in 1836, and serving for two years. He was appointed as a master in chancery in 1841. From 1837 to 1838, Murphy ran the original government land lines for Franklin County, Arkansas. On November 30, 1844, the noted Indian Missionary Cephas Washburn, along with Murphy and other leaders, secured a charter for a college known as the Far West Seminary. Murphy taught both whites and Indians at the seminary, intended for young men. Murphy taught here until the building was destroyed by fire on February 17, 1845, putting him in debt, as he had invested in the school. In 1846 Murphy was elected to the Arkansas House of Representatives for Washington County, and re-elected in 1848. With assignment to the Banking Committee, he attempted to introduce reforms but was stymied by the powerful political cabal known as \\"The Family\\". Murphy ran into financial difficulties about 1849 and left for California to seek wealth in the California Gold Rush. Among the many who did not succeed, he returned to Arkansas in 1854 with nothing to show for his efforts. Upon his return he moved to Huntsville in Madison County, Arkansas. His daughter Mrs. Mary Lowe Pierson of Washington County had been hired to teach at a new female seminary in Huntsville, the Pleasant View Female Seminary. Murphy and two more daughters were hired to assist in its operations.Hatfield, Kevin. \\"The Huntsville Massacre‚ÄîThe Civil War Forever Changes a Community.\\" Madison County Musings 25 (Winter 2006): 174‚Äì192. In 1856, Murphy was elected to the State Senate representing Madison and Benton counties, to succeed the late senator John Berry. Murphy's eldest daughter Malilla married James R. Berry, one of the senator's sons. Northwest Arkansas was a Unionist stronghold in the years before the Civil War. Civil War era =Secession convention= When the secession crisis swept the State in February 1861, Murphy was elected by 85% on a Unionist platform to represent Madison County at the Secession Convention; his county voted to remain in the Union. When Fort Sumter, South Carolina, was fired on and President Abraham Lincoln called for troops from Arkansas, the delegates of the Secession Convention were recalled, before the planned statewide referendum on secession could be held. The convention voted to take Arkansas out of the Union, but Murphy and four other delegates opposed this step. The convention chair called on the five to switch their votes. All four of the other \\"nay\\" delegates changed their votes, but Murphy refused. Initially his position was popular in Huntsville, but as the war went on, Confederate sentiment increased. =Governorship= As war broke out, Murphy fled his home in Huntsville; he spent much of the war traveling with the Union army in northwestern Arkansas. Following the fall of the capital city of Little Rock to the Union in 1863, Arkansas' Confederate government, led by Governor Harris Flanagin, went into exile. In a special election, held with the approval of President Lincoln, Isaac Murphy was elected as governor of Arkansas in 1863. =Reconstruction= Murphy worked to try to heal the war wounds in Arkansas, even as the war continued in the southern parts of the state. He worked for balance and said publicly that \\"We have all done wrong.\\" The 4th of July celebrations in Little Rock were led by pro-Union speakers who refrained from anti-Southern speeches or actions. After Lincoln's assassination and the actions of numerous state legislatures to control freedmen and limit their rights, Republicans in Congress began advocating stricter Reconstruction for the former Confederate states. In 1866, pro-Confederate legislators won majorities in several southern states. That same year, white violence against former slaves broke out in several states. In response, Republicans in Congress pushed through the 14th Amendment, granting full citizenship, rights and due process to freedmen, and the Reconstruction Acts of 1867. The rebel states were divided into military districts, to be controlled by US Army forces until the states passed new state constitutions protecting the civil rights of former slaves and accepting the 14th Amendment. Murphy was allowed to stay in office, but he was criticized by both sides. When Murphy left office, his administration had a budget surplus. It had started with no funds. With no initiatives passed by the Reconstruction legislature to provide for public welfare and education, as well as investment in infrastructure, this surplus was diverted to public projects. Death and legacy Murphy returned to Huntsville and took up farming and practicing law. He lived a quiet life with his family. On September 8, 1882, Murphy died unexpectedly at his home. He is buried in Huntsville Cemetery in Huntsville. In 1974, historian John I. Smith published several articles about what he called the Huntsville Massacre, an execution of prisoners of war in 1862. He said that Murphy had been implicated in those deaths. A memorial to those murdered in Huntsville was erected, dedicated on September 30, 2006.  See also  References External links * Michael B.

It may also be a final theatrical sequel, the last part of a television miniseries, the last installment of a literary series, or any final episode. Origins in television Most early television series consisted of stand-alone episodes rather than continuing story arcs, so there was little reason to provide closure at the end of their runs. Early series that had special finale episodes include Howdy Doody in September 1960, Leave It to Beaver in June 1963, and in early 1964, Route 66. Considered to be \\"the series finale that invented the modern-day series finale,\\" the 1967 final episode of ABC's The Fugitive, \\"The Judgment: Part 2\\", attracted a 72% audience share when broadcast. This remained the highest viewership percentage in U.S. television history until the 1977 finale of the TV mini-series Roots (on the same network) and later the 1980 resolution episode of the internationally prominent \\"Who Shot J.R.?\\" cliffhanger of CBS' Dallas. Notable television series finales =Most watched series finales= The most watched series finale in U.S. television history remains the 1983 finale of the CBS war/medical dramedy M*A*S*H, titled \\"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\\". Viewed by 105.9 million viewers and drawing 77% of those watching televisions at the time, the finale of M*A*S*H held the record for most watched telecast of all- time for decades until 2010's Super Bowl XLIV edged it out with 106 million viewers, which coincidentally also aired on CBS. However, M*A*S*H's final episode remains the all-time most-watched U.S. television episode (and so far, the only single television episode in U.S. history to be watched by at least 100 million viewers for a single telecast). The second-most-watched series finale in U.S. television history is the 1993 finale of the NBC comedy Cheers, titled \\"One for the Road\\". \\"One for the Road\\" was watched by between 80.4 million and 93.5 million viewers (estimates vary) while drawing 64% of TVs turned on at the time. To date, \\"One for the Road\\" remains the most watched U.S. TV series finale following the rise of cable television, and in terms of sheer viewership numbers for non-sports programming, sits second only to the aforementioned finale of M*A*S*H With only slightly fewer viewers than the series finale of Cheers is the finale of its one-time follow-up on NBC's \\"Must See TV\\" Thursday night line-up, the absurdist NBC comedy Seinfeld. The fourth most-watched U.S. TV series finale in television history, Seinfelds controversial 1998 episode \\"The Finale\\" was watched by 76.3 million people, drawing 67% of all televisions turned on at the time ‚Äì as the New York Times put it, \\"grazing Super Bowl country\\" in terms of viewership. With the shift away from network television viewing toward cable television viewing (and later, internet use) that occurred during the decade between the finales of M*A*S*H (1983) and Cheers (1993) ‚Äì and continued unabated until and beyond the finale of Seinfeld (1998) ‚Äì it remains debatable which of these three \\"event\\" series finales accomplished the most impressive viewership numbers. Moreover, a large gap in viewership numbers exists between the Super Bowl-sized audiences of the M*A*S*H, Cheers and Seinfeld finales, and the fifth and sixth most watched series finales in television history ‚Äì respectively, those of the comedy Friends (2004, NBC, 52.5 million viewers) and the detective procedural Magnum, P.I. (1988, CBS, 50.7 million viewers). The Friends finale's viewership numbers dwarf those of all finales since the start of the new millennium and seem particularly impressive in light of the increased media options since the 1990s \\"event\\" finales of Cheers (1993) and Seinfeld (1998). = Reception= No matter how critically lauded during their respective runs, relatively few popular television series finales end up pleasing critics and audiences universally and/or escaping controversy ‚Äì with the finale of the comedies Roseanne (\\"Into That Good Night\\", 1997), Seinfeld (\\"The Finale\\", 1998), 2004), How I Met Your Mother (\\"Last Forever,\\" 2014), Two and a Half Men (\\"Of Course He's Dead\\", 2015); the mob drama The Sopranos (\\"Made in America\\", 2007); the epic fantasy Game of Thrones (‚ÄúThe Iron Throne‚Äù, 2019); and the crime drama Dexter (\\"Remember the Monsters?\\", 2013) being some of the better known examples of this trend. For example, The Sopranos finale caused millions of viewers to temporarily believe they had lost cable service due to an abrupt blackout, whereas the series finales for Dexter and Game of Thrones caused massive backlash from both fans and critics and both are often regarded as some of the worst series finales for a TV show. Several iconic television series' finales did, however, manage to produce episodes that lived up to critics' and audiences' expectations; for example, the twist endings that concluded both the Newhart and St. Elsewhere finales, the mixture of comedy and resonance that wrapped up both The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Cheers, The Nanny, Friends, Everybody Loves Raymond, Mike & Molly, The Middle, and The Big Bang Theory and the redemption story that completed the arc of The Fugitive. Several series finales have won awards for their excellence, like Star Trek: The Next Generation.The Hugo Awards by Year , World Science Fiction Society website, accessed 29 January 2008 Recent series finales receiving high praise include The Vampire Diaries episode \\"I Was Feeling Epic\\" (2018), Community episode \\"Emotional Consequences of Broadcast Television\\" (2015), Breaking Bad episode \\"Felina\\" (2013), Gravity Falls episode ‚ÄúWeirdmageddon 3: Take Back The Falls‚Äù (2016), Regular Show episode ‚ÄùA Regular Epic Final Battle‚Äù (2017), and earlier in the millennium, the 2005 series finale of Six Feet Under, \\"Everyone's Waiting\\", which TV Guide ranked No. 22 on their list of \\"TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time\\". In 2018, The Americans finale, START, was lauded as one of the best TV finales, and was included in lists by USA Today and Business Insiderhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/05/31/series- finales-10-best-and-five-worst-all-time-americans-breaking-bad-mash-lost- himym-newhart-cheers/636504002/https://www.businessinsider.com/best-tv- finales-of-all-time-the-americans-30-rock-breaking-bad-2018-6#the-americans- season-6-episode-10-start-17 Plot devices Television series finales frequently feature fundamental deviations from the central plot line, such as the resolution of a central mystery or problem, (e.g. Dallas, Two and a Half Men, Full House) the separation or return of a major character (e.g. Cheers, That '70s Show, The Office) or an event signifying the end of an era, such as a change to primary setting for the series (e.g. The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Boy Meets World, Martin.) Series finales will sometimes include clips or characters from the series' past (e.g. Seinfeld, Six Feet Under, Martin, Star Trek: The Next Generation), and the ending moments of the episode often take place in the show's primary setting. In rare examples, game shows have been given series finales; examples include The Hollywood Squares (which ended its 15-season run in syndication in 1981 with a \\"Grand Championship Tournament\\" that awarded a massive cache of prizes including a house to the winner of the tournament), Family Feud (which ended a nine-season run on ABC in 1985 with a tribute from Richard Dawson), Sale of the Century (which ended a six-season run on NBC in 1989), and History IQ (which ended its two-season run on History in 2001 with a $250,000 tournament of champions). Game shows conducted in a tournament format are more likely to have series finales; examples of those include The Million Second Quiz (which aired on NBC in September 2013) and Mental Samurai (which aired on Fox between March and May 2019). Premature series finales In some cases, a TV series finale proves premature, as was the case with Here's Lucy, Charmed, King of the Hill, 7th Heaven and Babylon 5, to name but a few. Some shows that have constantly been in danger of cancellation wrote every season finale with the idea that the episode would serve as a quality series finale if the network decided not to bring it back; in recent years from NBC's Thursday night comedy lineup, Parks and Recreation used this formula for the season finales for Seasons 3‚Äì6, before getting a renewal for a 7th and final season where the series finale was planned in advance, and Community wrote its 5th-season finale with the notion that whether the show found new life elsewhere or not, it would definitely not be returning to the network (while NBC did indeed cancel the show, it was renewed for a 6th season by Yahoo Screen, where the season, and sure enough, series finale was once again scripted as a potential last episode ever; the final image is that of text reading \\"#andamovie\\", a reference to the show's recurring catchphrase \\"six seasons and a movie\\"). The series finale of Dr. Ken, a fictionalized sitcom based on the life of doctor-turned-actor Ken Jeong, features the title character trying out for a fictional version of Community (a show where Jeong was a cast member in real life). The medical comedy Scrubs aired its two-part finale episode billed simply as a \\"My Finale\\" in May 2009 as the show's renewal or cancellation had not been decided as of its airing, and so it was not known whether the episode would conclude just the season or the entire series; Scrubs would eventually be renewed for one additional season, which became a spin-off series titled Scrubs: Med School. The cartoon Futurama has had four designated series finales, due to the recurringly uncertain future of the series. \\"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\\", \\"Into the Wild Green Yonder (Part 4)\\", \\"Overclockwise\\", and \\"Meanwhile\\" were all been written to serve as a final episode for the show. Archived by Wayback Machine from on 7 September 2010. The series finale of The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour (itself an epilogue to I Love Lucy) was unintentionally fitting: stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were about to divorce and end the show, a fact that the show's guest star for what would be the final program, Edie Adams, did not know when she chose the song she would sing on the program. Prophetically, the song was named \\"That's All.\\" The series also ended with Lucy and Ricky making up and kissing, while in reality Ball and Arnaz would not (the two would eventually reconcile later in life, although both would go on to marry other people). The last produced half-hour episode was titled \\"The Ricardos Dedicate a Statue\\" which included real-life kids Luci Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr. in the final scene where Ricky unveils what he thinks is a Revolutionary War statue only to find out that it is Lucy. The afore- mentioned Magnum, P.I. had a premature series finale, as well. At the end of the seventh season, protagonist Thomas Magnum was to be killed off, which was intended to end the series. The final episode of the season, \\"Limbo\\", after seeing Magnum wander around as a ghost for nearly the entire run-time, closes with him appearing to walk off into heaven. However, following outcry from fans, who demanded a more satisfactory conclusion, an eighth, final season was produced, to bring Magnum \\"back to life\\", and to round the series off. The mystery of whether Higgins was Robin Masters, or not, was a highly anticipated series finale reveal. The mystery still has yet to be revealed. A number of other episodes also make reference to supernatural occurrences and the seeming existence of ghosts. The Showtime series Californication was designed from start to make any season finale work as a series finale, in case of early cancelling the show. It is seen most primarily at the end of the first and fourth season. After its 5th season, the television show Reba was in danger of being cancelled; the 6th and final season's finale episode was written to serve as a series finale, in which Brock and Barbara-Jean come to a reconciliation and Van and Cheyenne move back in with Reba, bringing the show to a full wrap. Finales launching spin-offs Series finales are sometimes used as a backdoor pilot to launch spinoff series. Two well-known examples include The Andy Griffith Shows series finale, which launched the spinoff Mayberry RFD and The Practice's series finale, and much of its final season was used as a launching pad for Boston Legal, starring James Spader and William Shatner. The Golden Girls series finale was set up to lead into a new series with most of the remaining cast, The Golden Palace, Three's Company transitioned more or less seamlessly into Three's a Crowd while The Fosters series finale acted as an introduction to its spin-off series Good Trouble. Additionally, the Steven Universe finale \\"Change Your Mind\\" served as not just a conclusion to the original series and its overarching plot, but helped pave the way for Steven Universe: The Movie, and eventually the limited epilogue series Steven Universe Future. The Harvey Girls Forever! series finale will lead to a spinoff for the Horn-A-Corns. Some planned spin-offs that influenced series finales, however, never materialized, as in the case of the proposed Laverne & Shirley spin-off for Carmine that never came into fruition, or Posse Impossible, a proposed spin-off of Hong Kong Phooey that, instead of getting its own show, aired as an interstitial segment on CB Bears.

Until its merger into the parish of Vidago, Arcoss√≥, Selhariz e Vilarinho das Paranheiras., the civil parish administered an area of and included a population of 1186 inhabitants. History A view of Hotel Palace of Vidago Known as a spa town, Vidago was a centre of mineral water treatments dating back to the late 19th century and early 20th century. For a long time distance was an impediment to the development of the town, due to the difficulty of transport. Guests would arrive by coach from Porto, using roads that were often little more than dirt path. Finally in 1907 the railroad between R√©gua and Vila Real was extended to Pedras Salgadas, to the south of Vidago. Three years later the first train arrived at the Vidago station, resulting in renewed popularity of the spa. During the Gilded Age, the popularity of the waters in Vidago resulted in the construction of the Hotel Palace of Vidago, which became the retreat of some Portuguese monarchs. The spa town saw its period of splendor from 1875 to 1877 when King Lu√≠s I made consecutive visits. The fame of the curative powers of the waters spread so far that from 1876 to 1889 they were awarded prizes in Madrid, Paris, Vienna and Rio de Janeiro. For this, Vidago was once one of the most visited Portuguese spas; the water is apparently effective in the treatment of digestive problems, as it contains sodium bicarbonate and, according to publicity leaflets, radioactive elements. Bottled mineral waters Salus and Campilho are extracted in Vidago. When the Palace Hotel was built in 1910, it was one of the most luxurious on the Iberian Peninsula, that included concerts, tennis and croquet courts, and, on the small island within the lake, there was a spacious skating rink. Following a period of remodelling, refurbishing and renovation, the 5-star hotel reopened in 2010, which included an expanded golf course and park.

E. Horses and Horsemanship 6th edition USA: Interstate Publishers 1990 pp. 65‚Äì66 Classification Gaits are typically categorized into two groups: the \\"natural\\" gaits that most horses will use without special training, and the \\"ambling\\" gaits that are various smooth-riding four-beat footfall patterns that may appear naturally in some individuals. Special training is often required before a horse will perform an ambling gait in response to a rider's command. Another system of classification that applies to quadrupeds uses three categories: walking and ambling gaits, running or trotting gaits, and leaping gaits.Tristan David Martin Roberts (1995) Understanding Balance: The Mechanics of Posture and Locomotion, Nelson Thornes, The British Horse Society Dressage Rules require competitors to perform four variations of the walk, six forms of the trot, five leaping gaits (all forms of the canter), halt, and rein back, but not the gallop. The British Horse Society Equitation examinations also require proficiency in the gallop as distinct from the canter. The so-called \\"natural\\" gaits, in increasing order of speed, are the walk, trot, canter, and gallop.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 p. 32 Some consider these as three gaits, with the canter a variation of the gallop, even though the canter is distinguished by having three beats, whereas the gallop has four beats. All four gaits are seen in wild horse populations. While other intermediate speed gaits may occur naturally to some horses, these four basic gaits occur in nature across almost all horse breeds. In some animals the trot is replaced by the pace or an ambling gait. Horses who possess an ambling gait are usually also able to trot. Walk The walk, a four-beat gait The walk is a four-beat gait that averages about . When walking, a horse's legs follow this sequence: left hind leg, left front leg, right hind leg, right front leg, in a regular 1-2-3-4 beat. At the walk, the horse will alternate between having three or two feet on the ground. A horse moves its head and neck in a slight up and down motion that helps maintain balance.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 pp. 32‚Äì33 In detail, suppose the horse starts by lifting its left front leg (the other three feet are touching the ground). It then lifts its right hind leg (while being supported by the diagonal pair front right and left hind). Next, the left front foot touches the ground (the horse is now supported by all but the right hind leg); then the horse lifts its right front leg (it is now supported laterally on both left legs), and shortly afterwards it sets down the right rear leg (only the front right leg is now lifted). Then it lifts its left rear leg (diagonal support), puts down the front right (lateral support), lifts the left front, puts down the rear left, and the pattern repeats. Ideally, the advancing rear hoof oversteps the spot where the previously advancing front hoof touched the ground. The more the rear hoof oversteps, the smoother and more comfortable the walk becomes. Individual horses and different breeds vary in the smoothness of their walk. However, a rider will almost always feel some degree of gentle side-to-side motion in the horse's hips as each hind leg reaches forward. The fastest \\"walks\\" with a four-beat footfall pattern are actually the lateral forms of ambling gaits such as the running walk, singlefoot, and similar rapid but smooth intermediate speed gaits. If a horse begins to speed up and lose a regular four-beat cadence to its gait, the horse is no longer walking, but is beginning to either trot or pace. Trot The trot, a two-beat gait involving diagonal pairs of legs. The two legs with white stockings are off the ground. The trot is a two-beat gait that has a wide variation in possible speeds, but averages about . A very slow trot is sometimes referred to as a jog. An extremely fast trot has no special name, but in harness racing, the trot of a Standardbred is faster than the gallop of the average non-racehorse.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 pp. 35‚Äì37 The North American speed record for a racing trot under saddle was measured at In this gait, the horse moves its legs in unison in diagonal pairs. From the standpoint of the balance of the horse, this is a very stable gait, and the horse need not make major balancing motions with its head and neck. The trot is the working gait for a horse. Horses can only canter and gallop for short periods at a time, after which they need time to rest and recover. Horses in good condition can maintain a working trot for hours. The trot is the main way horses travel quickly from one place to the next. The Fairman Rogers Four-in-Hand (1879‚Äì80) by Thomas Eakins, was the first painting to demonstrate precisely how horses move based on systematic photographic analysis. Eakins based these on Eadweard Muybridge's 1878 photographs of the trotter \\"Abe Edgington\\". Depending on the horse and its speed, a trot can be difficult for a rider to sit because the body of the horse drops a bit between beats and bounces up again when the next set of legs strike the ground. Each time another diagonal pair of legs hits the ground, the rider can be jolted upwards out of the saddle and meet the horse with some force on the way back down. Therefore, at most speeds above a jog, especially in English riding disciplines, most riders post to the trot, rising up and down in rhythm with the horse to avoid being jolted. Posting is easy on the horse's back, and once mastered is also easy on the rider. To not be jostled out of the saddle and to not harm the horse by bouncing on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders can easily learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride even a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, is virtually impossible to sit. Because the trot is such a safe and efficient gait for a horse, learning to ride the trot correctly is an important component in almost all equestrian disciplines. Nonetheless, \\"gaited\\" or \\"ambling\\" horses that possess smooth 4-beat intermediate gaits that replace or supplement the trot (see \\"ambling gaits\\" below) are popular with riders who prefer for various reasons not to have to ride at a trot. Two variations of the trot are specially trained in advanced dressage horses: the Piaffe and the Passage. The Piaffe is essentially created by asking the horse to trot in place, with very little forward motion. The Passage is an exaggerated slow motion trot. Both require tremendous collection, careful training and considerable physical conditioning for a horse to perform.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 p. 39 Canter and gallop Andalusian performing the canter. The left hind and right fore will land at the same moment, creating three beats in the stride. This horse is on the left lead, as the left rear and right fore are moving together, with the left hind leading the right hind. As the left fore lands, it will be in front of the right fore. =Canter= The canter is a controlled three-beat gait that is usually a bit faster than the average trot, but slower than the gallop. The average speed of a canter is 16‚Äì27 km/h (10‚Äì17 mph), depending on the length of the stride of the horse. Listening to a horse canter, one can usually hear the three beats as though a drum had been struck three times in succession. Then there is a rest, and immediately afterwards the three-beat occurs again. The faster the horse is moving, the longer the suspension time between the three beats.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 pp. 42‚Äì44 The word is thought to be short for \\"Canterbury gallop\\". In the canter, one of the horse's rear legs - the right rear leg, for example - propels the horse forward. During this beat, the horse is supported only on that single leg while the remaining three legs are moving forward. On the next beat the horse catches itself on the left rear and right front legs while the other hind leg is still momentarily on the ground. On the third beat, the horse catches itself on the left front leg while the diagonal pair is momentarily still in contact with the ground. The more extended foreleg is matched by a slightly more extended hind leg on the same side. This is referred to as a \\"lead\\". Except in special cases, such as the counter-canter, it is desirable for a horse to lead with its inside legs when on a circle. Therefore, a horse that begins cantering with the right rear leg as described above will have the left front and hind legs each land farther forward. This would be referred to as being on the \\"left lead\\". When a rider is added to the horse's natural balance, the question of the lead becomes more important. When riding in an enclosed area such as an arena, the correct lead provides the horse with better balance. The rider typically signals the horse which lead to take when moving from a slower gait into the canter. In addition, when jumping over fences, the rider typically signals the horse to land on the correct lead to approach the next fence or turn. The rider can also request the horse to deliberately take up the wrong lead (counter-canter), a move required in some dressage competitions and routine in polo, which requires a degree of collection and balance in the horse. The switch from one lead to another without breaking gait is called the \\"flying lead change\\" or \\"flying change\\". This switch is also a feature of dressage and reining schooling and competition. If a horse is leading with one front foot but the opposite hind foot, it produces an awkward rolling movement, called a cross-canter, disunited canter or \\"cross-firing\\". The lope is another term for the canter, used in western U.S.A. =Gallop= The suspension phase, seen in the canter and the gallop In motion Le derby d'Epsom, painting by Th√©odore G√©ricault, 1821 The gallop is very much like the canter, except that it is faster, more ground-covering, and the three-beat canter changes to a four-beat gait. It is the fastest gait of the horse, averaging about , and in the wild is used when the animal needs to flee from predators or simply cover short distances quickly. Horses seldom will gallop more than before they need to rest, though horses can sustain a moderately paced gallop for longer distances before they become winded and have to slow down.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 pp. 47‚Äì49 The gallop is also the gait of the classic race horse. Modern Thoroughbred horse races are seldom longer than , though in some countries Arabian horses are sometimes raced as far as . The fastest galloping speed is achieved by the American Quarter Horse, which in a short sprint of a quarter mile () or less has been clocked at speeds approaching . The Guinness Book of World Records lists a Thoroughbred as having averaged over a two-furlong () distance in 2008. Like a canter, the horse will strike off with its non-leading hind foot; but the second stage of the canter becomes, in the gallop, the second and third stages because the inside hind foot hits the ground a split second before the outside front foot. Then both gaits end with the striking off of the leading leg, followed by a moment of suspension when all four feet are off the ground. A careful listener or observer can tell an extended canter from a gallop by the presence of the fourth beat. Contrary to the old \\"classic\\" paintings of running horses, which showed all four legs stretched out in the suspension phase, when the legs are stretched out, at least one foot is still in contact with the ground. When all four feet are off the ground in the suspension phase of the gallop, the legs are bent rather than extended. In 1877, Leland Stanford settled an argument about whether racehorses were ever fully airborne: he paid photographer Eadweard Muybridge to prove it photographically. The resulting photos, known as The Horse in Motion, were the first documented example of high-speed photography and they clearly showed the horse airborne. Stills of the Muybridge sequence; images 7 and 8 show the suspension phase, the second from the last image show the broken strike sequence of the inside hind and outside fore feet According to Equix, who analyzed the biometrics of racing thoroughbreds, the average racing colt has a stride length of ; that of Secretariat, for instance, was , which was probably part of his success. A controlled gallop used to show a horse's ground- covering stride in horse show competition is called a \\"gallop in hand\\" or a hand gallop. In complete contrast to the suspended phase of a gallop, when a horse jumps over a fence, the legs are stretched out while in the air, and the front legs hit the ground before the hind legs. Essentially, the horse takes the first two steps of a galloping stride on the take-off side of the fence, and the other two steps on the landing side. A horse has to collect its hindquarters after a jump to strike off into the next stride.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 pp. 57‚Äì63 Pace Pace The pace is a lateral two-beat gait. In the pace, the two legs on the same side of the horse move forward together, unlike the trot, where the two legs diagonally opposite from each other move forward together. In both the pace and the trot, two feet are always off the ground. The trot is much more common, but some horses, particularly in breeds bred for harness racing, naturally prefer to pace. Pacers are also faster than trotters on the average, though horses are raced at both gaits. Among Standardbred horses, pacers breed truer than trotters ‚Äì that is, trotting sires have a higher proportion of pacers among their get than pacing sires do of trotters.Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 p. 50 A slow pace can be relatively comfortable, as the rider is lightly rocked from side to side. A slightly uneven pace that is somewhat between a pace and an amble, is the sobreandando of the Peruvian Paso. On the other hand, a slow pace is considered undesirable in an Icelandic horse, where it is called a lull or a \\"piggy-pace\\". With one exception, a fast pace is uncomfortable for riding and very difficult to sit, because the rider is moved rapidly from side to side. The motion feels somewhat as if the rider is on a camel, another animal that naturally paces. However, a camel is much taller than a horse and so even at relatively fast speeds, a rider can follow the rocking motion of a camel. A pacing horse, being smaller and taking quicker steps, moves from side to side at a rate that becomes difficult for a rider to follow at speed, so though the gait is faster and useful for harness racing, it becomes impractical as a gait for riding at speed over long distances. However, in the case of the Icelandic horse, where the pace is known as the skei√∞, \\"flying pace\\" or flugskei√∞, it is a smooth and highly valued gait, ridden in short bursts at great speed. A horse that paces and is not used in harness is often taught to perform some form of amble, obtained by lightly unbalancing the horse so the footfalls of the pace break up into a four beat lateral gait that is smoother to ride. A rider cannot properly post to a pacing horse because there is no diagonal gait pattern to follow, though some riders attempt to avoid jostling by rhythmically rising and sitting. Based on studies of the Icelandic horse, it is possible that the pace may be heritable and linked to a single genetic mutation on DMRT3 in the same manner as the lateral ambling gaits. \\"Ambling\\" gaits There are a significant number of names for various four-beat intermediate gaits. Though these names derive from differences in footfall patterns and speed, historically they were once grouped together and collectively referred to as the \\"amble\\". In the United States horses that are able to amble are referred to as \\"gaited\\".Harris, Susan E. Horse Gaits, Balance and Movement New York: Howell Book House 1993 pp. 50‚Äì55 In almost all cases, the primary feature of the ambling gaits is that 1 of the 4 feet is bearing full weight at any one time, reflected in the colloquial term, \\"singlefoot\\". All ambling gaits are faster than a walk but usually slower than a canter. They are smoother for a rider than either a trot or a pace and most can be sustained for relatively long periods, making them particularly desirable for trail riding and other tasks where a rider must spend long periods of time in the saddle. There are two basic types: lateral, wherein the front and hind feet on the same side move in sequence, and diagonal, where the front and hind feet on opposite sides move in sequence.Lieberman, Bobbie. \\"Easy-Gaited Horses\\". Equus, issue 359, August, 2007, pp. 47‚Äì51. Ambling gaits are further distinguished by whether the footfall rhythm is isochronous, four equal beats in a 1‚Äì2‚Äì3‚Äì4 rhythm; or a non-isochronous 1‚Äì2, 3‚Äì4 rhythm created by a slight pause between the groundstrike of the forefoot of one side to the rear of the other. Not all horses can perform an ambling gait. However, many breeds can be trained to produce them. In most \\"gaited\\" breeds, an ambling gait is a hereditary trait. A 2012 DNA study of movement in Icelandic horses and mice have determined that a mutation on the gene DMRT3, which is related to limb movement and motion, causes a \\"premature 'stop codon in horses with lateral ambling gaits. The major ambling gaits include: * The fox trot is most often associated with the Missouri Foxtrotter breed, but is also seen under different names in other gaited breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind.Ensminger, M. E. Horses and Horsemanship 6th edition USA: Interstate Publishers 1990 p. 68 The same footfall pattern is characteristic of the trocha, pasitrote and marcha batida seen in various South American breeds. * Many South American horse breeds have a range of smooth intermediate lateral ambling gaits. The Paso Fino's speed variations are called (from slowest to fastest) the paso fino, paso corto, and paso largo. The Peruvian Paso's lateral gaits are known as the paso llano and sobreandando. The lateral gait of the Mangalarga Marchador is called the marcha picada. * The rack or racking is a lateral gait most commonly associated with the five-gaited American Saddlebred. In the rack, the speed is increased to be approximately that of the pace, but it is a four-beat gait with equal intervals between each beat. * The running walk, a four-beat lateral gait with footfalls in the same sequence as the regular walk, but characterized by greater speed and smoothness. It is a distinctive natural gait of the Tennessee Walking Horse. * The slow gait is a general term for various lateral gaits that follow the same general lateral footfall pattern, but the rhythm and collection of the movements are different. Terms for various slow gaits include the stepping pace and singlefoot. * The t√∂lt is a gait that is often described as being unique to the Icelandic horse. The footfall pattern is the same as for the rack, but the t√∂lt is characterized by more freedom and liquidity of movement. Some breeds of horses that are related to the Icelandic horse, living in the Faroe Islands and Norway, also t√∂lt. * The revaal or ravaal is a four-beat lateral gait associated with Marwari, Kathiawari or Sindhi horse breeds of India.

It is famous for its mineral waters. There are several small hotels in the area, which cater to tourists who want to relax in the green countryside and benefit from the spa facilities located there. In 2010 the Portuguese beer and water company Unicer opened a brand new spa complex in the town. Pedras Salgadas is located in the municipality of Vila Pouca de Aguiar. Both are located on N2, the national road linking Chaves with Vila real. The new four-lane A24 highway passes a few kilometers west of the town and is connected by a feeder road. The railway was closed in the nineteen eighties and the abandoned railway bed has now been tarmacked for use as a cycling and walking path.

He flourished around 1350 BC, and is thought to have been the official court sculptor of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten in the latter part of his reign. A German archaeological expedition digging in Akhenaten's deserted city of Akhetaten, known today as Amarna, found a ruined house and studio complex (labeled P47.1-3)Located at in early December 1912; the building was identified as that of Thutmose based on an ivory horse blinker found in a rubbish pit in the courtyard inscribed with his name and job title.Reeves. (2005) p. 157. Since it gave his occupation as \\"sculptor\\" and the building was clearly a sculpture workshop, the determination seemed logical and has proven to be accurate. Recovered works Bust of Nefertiti by Thutmose on display at the Neues Museum in Berlin Among many other sculptural items recovered at the same time was the polychrome bust of Nefertiti, apparently a master study for others to copy, which was found on the floor of a storeroom. In addition to this now-famous bust, twenty-two plaster casts of faces‚Äîsome of which are full heads, others just the face‚Äîwere found in Rooms 18 and 19 of the studio, with an additional one found in Room 14. Eight of these have been identified as various members of the royal family, including Akhenaten, his other wife Kiya, his late father Amenhotep III, and his eventual successor Ay. The rest represent unknown individuals, presumably contemporary residents of Amarna. A couple of the pieces found in the workshop depict realistic images of older noblewomen, something rare in Ancient Egyptian art, which more often portrayed women in an idealized manner as always young, slender, and beautiful.Sweeney. (2004) p. 67. One of the plaster faces depicts an older woman, with wrinkles at the corner of her eyes, bags under them, and a deeply lined forehead. This piece has been described as showing \\"a greater variety of wrinkles than any other depiction of an elite woman from ancient Egypt\\"Sweeney. (2004) p. 79. It is thought to represent the image of a wise, older woman. A small statue of an aging Nefertiti also was found in the workshop, depicting her with a rounded, drooping belly, thick thighs, and a curved line at the base of her abdomen showing that she had borne several children, perhaps intended to project an image of fertility.Tyldesley (2006). p. 126-127. Examples of his work recovered from his abandoned studio may be viewed at the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City. Upon the death of Akhenaten, the seat of government was returned from Amarna to Thebes and the associated bureaucratic and professional industries followed.  Tomb  In 1996 the French Egyptologist Alain Zivie discovered at Saqqara the decorated rock cut tomb of the \\"head of the painters in the place of truth\\", Thutmose. The tomb dates to the time shortly after the Amarna Period. Although the title of the Thutmose in Saqqara is slightly different from the title of the Thutmose known from Amarna, it seems likely that they refer to the same person and that the different titles represent different stages in his career.Alain Zivie: La tombe de Thoutmes, directeur des peintres dans la Place de Ma√¢t, 2013 An extensive article by Zivie in the July-August 2018 edition of Biblical Archaeology Review provides great detail and many images of artifacts recovered in an adjacent tomb,Zivie, Alain, Pharaoh's Man, Abdiel, the vizier with a Semitic name, Biblical Archaeology Review, July- August 2018, page 23,ff discussion of many aspects of several topics regarding Ancient Egyptian research and identification, as well as information about the sculptor, Thutmose.

In mathematics, an involution, or an involutory function, is a function that is its own inverse, : for all in the domain of . Equivalently, applying twice produces the original value. The term anti- involution refers to involutions based on antihomomorphisms (see ' below) : such that : . General properties Any involution is a bijection. The identity map is a trivial example of an involution. Common examples in mathematics of nontrivial involutions include multiplication by ‚àí1 in arithmetic, the taking of reciprocals, complementation in set theory and complex conjugation. Other examples include circle inversion, rotation by a half-turn, and reciprocal ciphers such as the ROT13 transformation and the Beaufort polyalphabetic cipher. The number of involutions, including the identity involution, on a set with elements is given by a recurrence relation found by Heinrich August Rothe in 1800: :a_0 = a_1 = 1 and a_n = a_{n - 1} + (n - 1)a_{n-2} for n > 1. The first few terms of this sequence are 1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 26, 76, 232 ; these numbers are called the telephone numbers, and they also count the number of Young tableaux with a given number of cells.. The composition of two involutions f and g is an involution if and only if they commute: .. Every involution on an odd number of elements has at least one fixed point. More generally, for an involution on a finite set of elements, the number of elements and the number of fixed points have the same parity.. Involution throughout the fields of mathematics =Pre-calculus = Basic examples of involutions are the functions: : f_1(x) = -x , or f_2(x) = \\\\frac {1}{x} , as well as their composition (f_1\\\\circ f_2)(x) = (f_2\\\\circ f_1)(x) = f_3(x) = -\\\\frac {1}{x}. These are not the only pre-calculus involutions. Another one within the positive reals is: : f(x) = \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac {e^x+1}{e^x-1}\\\\right) . The graph of an involution (on the real numbers) is line-symmetric over the line y=x. This is due to the fact that the inverse of any general function will be its reflection over the 45¬∞ line y=x. This can be seen by \\"swapping\\" x with y. If, in particular, the function is an involution, then it will serve as its own reflection. Other elementary involutions are useful in solving functional equations. =Euclidean geometry= A simple example of an involution of the three-dimensional Euclidean space is reflection through a plane. Performing a reflection twice brings a point back to its original coordinates. Another involution is reflection through the origin; not a reflection in the above sense, and so, a distinct example. These transformations are examples of affine involutions. =Projective geometry= An involution is a projectivity of period 2, that is, a projectivity that interchanges pairs of points.A.G. Pickford (1909) Elementary Projective Geometry, Cambridge University Press via Internet Archive * Any projectivity that interchanges two points is an involution. * The three pairs of opposite sides of a complete quadrangle meet any line (not through a vertex) in three pairs of an involution. This theorem has been called Desargues's Involution Theorem.J. V. Field and J. J. Gray (1987) The Geometrical Work of Girard Desargues, (New York: Springer), p. 54 Its origins can be seen in Lemma IV of the lemmas to the Porisms of Euclid in Volume VII of the Collection of Pappus of Alexandria.Ivor Thomas (editor) (1980) Selections Illustrating the History of Greek Mathematics, Volume II, number 362 in the Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge and London: Harvard and Heinemann), pp. 610-3 * If an involution has one fixed point, it has another, and consists of the correspondence between harmonic conjugates with respect to these two points. In this instance the involution is termed \\"hyperbolic\\", while if there are no fixed points it is \\"elliptic\\". In the context of projectivities, fixed points are called double points. Another type of involution occurring in projective geometry is a polarity which is a correlation of period 2. H. S. M. Coxeter (1969) Introduction to Geometry, pp 244‚Äì8, John Wiley & Sons =Linear algebra= In linear algebra, an involution is a linear operator T on a vector space, such that T^2=I. Except for in characteristic 2, such operators are diagonalizable for a given basis with just 1s and ‚àí1s on the diagonal of the corresponding matrix. If the operator is orthogonal (an orthogonal involution), it is orthonormally diagonalizable. For example, suppose that a basis for a vector space V is chosen, and that e1 and e2 are basis elements. There exists a linear transformation f which sends e1 to e2, and sends e2 to e1, and which is the identity on all other basis vectors. It can be checked that for all x in V. That is, f is an involution of V. For a specific basis, any linear operator can be represented by a matrix T. Every matrix has a transpose, obtained by swapping rows for columns. This transposition is an involution on the set of matrices. The definition of involution extends readily to modules. Given a module M over a ring R, an R endomorphism f of M is called an involution if f 2 is the identity homomorphism on M. Involutions are related to idempotents; if 2 is invertible then they correspond in a one-to-one manner. =Quaternion algebra, groups, semigroups= In a quaternion algebra, an (anti-)involution is defined by the following axioms: if we consider a transformation x \\\\mapsto f(x) then it is an involution if * f(f(x))=x (it is its own inverse) * f(x_1+x_2)=f(x_1)+f(x_2) and f(\\\\lambda x)=\\\\lambda f(x) (it is linear) * f(x_1 x_2)=f(x_1) f(x_2) An anti-involution does not obey the last axiom but instead * f(x_1 x_2)=f(x_2) f(x_1) This former law is sometimes called antidistributive. It also appears in groups as . Taken as an axiom, it leads to the notion of semigroup with involution, of which there are natural examples that are not groups, for example square matrix multiplication (i.e. the full linear monoid) with transpose as the involution. =Ring theory= In ring theory, the word involution is customarily taken to mean an antihomomorphism that is its own inverse function. Examples of involutions in common rings: * complex conjugation on the complex plane * multiplication by j in the split-complex numbers * taking the transpose in a matrix ring. =Group theory= In group theory, an element of a group is an involution if it has order 2; i.e. an involution is an element a such that a ‚â† e and a2 = e, where e is the identity element. John S. Rose. \\"A Course on Group Theory\\". p. 10, section 1.13. Originally, this definition agreed with the first definition above, since members of groups were always bijections from a set into itself; i.e., group was taken to mean permutation group. By the end of the 19th century, group was defined more broadly, and accordingly so was involution. A permutation is an involution precisely if it can be written as a product of one or more non-overlapping transpositions. The involutions of a group have a large impact on the group's structure. The study of involutions was instrumental in the classification of finite simple groups. An element x of a group G is called strongly real if there is an involution t with xt = x‚àí1 (where xt = t‚àí1‚ãÖx‚ãÖt). Coxeter groups are groups generated by involutions with the relations determined only by relations given for pairs of the generating involutions. Coxeter groups can be used, among other things, to describe the possible regular polyhedra and their generalizations to higher dimensions. = Mathematical logic = The operation of complement in Boolean algebras is an involution. Accordingly, negation in classical logic satisfies the law of double negation: ¬¨¬¨A is equivalent to A. Generally in non-classical logics, negation that satisfies the law of double negation is called involutive. In algebraic semantics, such a negation is realized as an involution on the algebra of truth values. Examples of logics which have involutive negation are Kleene and Bochvar three-valued logics, ≈Åukasiewicz many-valued logic, fuzzy logic IMTL, etc. Involutive negation is sometimes added as an additional connective to logics with non-involutive negation; this is usual, for example, in t-norm fuzzy logics. The involutiveness of negation is an important characterization property for logics and the corresponding varieties of algebras. For instance, involutive negation characterizes Boolean algebras among Heyting algebras. Correspondingly, classical Boolean logic arises by adding the law of double negation to intuitionistic logic. The same relationship holds also between MV-algebras and BL-algebras (and so correspondingly between ≈Åukasiewicz logic and fuzzy logic BL), IMTL and MTL, and other pairs of important varieties of algebras (resp. corresponding logics). In the study of binary relations, every relation has a converse relation. Since the converse of the converse is the original relation, the conversion operation is an involution on the category of relations. Binary relations are ordered through inclusion. While this ordering is reversed with the complementation involution, it is preserved under conversion. = Computer science = The XOR bitwise operation with a given value for one parameter is an involution. XOR masks were once used to draw graphics on images in such a way that drawing them twice on the background reverts the background to its original state. The NOT bitwise operation is also an involution, and is a special case of the XOR operation where one parameter has all bits set to 1. Another example is a bit mask and shift function operating on color values stored as integers, say in the form RGB, that swaps R and B, resulting in the form BGR. f(f(RGB))=RGB, f(f(BGR))=BGR. The RC4 cryptographic cipher is an involution, as encryption and decryption operations use the same function. Practically all mechanical cipher machines implement a reciprocal cipher, an involution on each typed-in letter. Instead of designing two kinds of machines, one for encrypting and one for decrypting, all the machines can be identical and can be set up (keyed) the same way.

A member of the Republican Party, Clayton also served in the U.S. Senate and as the 9th governor of Arkansas from 1868 to 1871. Clayton was educated in the common schools at Bethel Township, Pennsylvania; the Pennsylvania Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Bristol; and an engineering school in Wilmington, Delaware. In 1855, Clayton moved to Kansas Territory where he engaged in civil engineering, becoming the city engineer of Leavenworth in 1859. During the Civil War, he served as a senior officer of United States Volunteers who commanded cavalry in the Trans- Mississippi Theater. Early life and career Powell Foulk Clayton was born in Bethel Township, Pennsylvania, to John and Ann (n√©e Clark) Clayton. The Clayton family was descended from early Quaker settlers of Pennsylvania. Clayton's ancestor William Clayton emigrated from Chichester, England, was a personal friend of William Penn, one of nine justices who sat at the Upland Court in 1681, and a member of Penn's Council. Clayton attended the Forwood School in Wilmington, Delaware and the Pennsylvania Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Bristol. He later studied civil engineering in Wilmington, Delaware. In 1855, he moved to Kansas to work as a surveyor. He speculated in land in Kansas and entered politics in 1860 when he successfully ran for the office of city engineer in Leavenworth. American Civil War Clayton in uniform In May 1861 Clayton was formally mustered into the U.S. Volunteers as a Captain of company E in the 1st Kansas Infantry. During the war he served primarily in Arkansas and Missouri and fought in several battles in those states. In August 1861, Clayton received a commendation for his leadership when his unit saw action in the Battle of Wilson's Creek in Missouri. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel of the 5th Kansas Cavalry in December 1861 and to colonel in March 1862. At the Battle of Helena in Arkansas on July 4, 1863, Clayton commanded the cavalry brigade on the right flank of the Union forces and received a commendation for his actions. In August and September 1863, Clayton's regiment accompanied General Frederick Steele's troops in the campaign against Little Rock. In October 1863, Clayton commanded federal troops occupying Pine Bluff, Arkansas using the Boone-Murphy House as his headquarters. During the Battle of Pine Bluff, he successfully repulsed a three-pronged confederate attack of the forces of General John S. Marmaduke. During the battle, his troops piled cotton bales around the Jefferson County Courthouse and surrounding streets to make a barricade for the Union defenders. Clayton was idolized by his men and respected by his enemies. John Edwards, a Confederate officer in Joseph O. Shelby's command wrote: \\"Colonel Clayton was an officer of activity and enterprise, clear-headed, quick to conceive, and bold and rapid to execute. His success in the field has caused him...to be considered the ablest Federal commander of Cavalry west of the Mississippi.\\" Clayton was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers on August 1, 1864. When he was mustered out of the service in August 1865, he commanded the cavalry division of the Seventh Army Corps. While still in command at Pine Bluff, Clayton invested in cotton and acquired sufficient capital to purchase a plantation in Jefferson County where he settled after the war. Political career =Governor of Arkansas: 1868‚Äì1871= In 1867, Clayton participated in the formation of the Arkansas Republican party. He attributed his participation in Arkansas politics to confrontations with ex- Rebels on his plantation that convinced him that Unionists required additional protection. In 1866, Democrats took control of the state legislature and nominated two U.S. Senators. However, the Republican-controlled Congress refused to seat them. In March 1867, Congress passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867 declaring the governments of Arkansas and nine other former Confederate states illegal and requiring those states to adopt new constitutions providing civil rights to freedmen. Congressional Reconstruction established military rule across the South and General Edward Ord was appointed military governor of the Fourth Military District which included Mississippi and Arkansas. He disbanded the legislature and called for a constitutional convention. Most of the delegates to the 1868 constitutional convention were Republican since few Democrats could take the \\"ironclad oath\\" that they had not served in the Confederacy or given aid or comfort to the enemy. Clayton was not a delegate to the constitutional convention but did participate in the Republican state nominating convention which was meeting at the same time. That convention selected Clayton as the Republican gubernatorial nominee and James M. Johnson as the candidate for lieutenant governor. The ratification of the 1868 constitution, providing civil rights and the vote to freedmen, produced a furor among Democrats, who adhered to white supremacist beliefs. That Spring the Ku Klux Klan arose in Arkansas, and was responsible for more than 200 murders of former slaves and Republicans leading up to the 1868 election. On April 1, 1868, the state board of election commissioners announced ratification of the constitution and Clayton's election as Governor of Arkansas. Congress accepted the Arkansas constitution of 1868 as legal. Democratic President Andrew Johnson vetoed it, but the Republican-dominated Congress was able to override his veto. The state was readmitted to representation in Congress when Clayton was inaugurated as Governor on July 2, 1868. The new legislature unanimously accepted the Fourteenth Amendment and Congress declared Arkansas reconstructed. As governor, Clayton faced fierce opposition from the state's conservative political leaders and violence against blacks and members of the Republican party led by the Ku Klux Klan. During this time Arkansas Republican Congressman James Hinds was attacked and killed while on his way to a political event and Clayton survived an attempt on his life. Clayton responded aggressively to the emergence of the Klan in Arkansas by declaring martial law in fourteen counties for four months in late 1868 and early 1869. Clayton organized the state militia and placed General Daniel Phillips Upham in charge to help suppress violence throughout the state. Clayton and the Republicans in the legislature accomplished much during his three-year terms as governor. State bonds were issued to fund the construction of several railroads throughout the state. Arkansas completed its first ever free public school system. The Clayton administration also formed the Arkansas Industrial University, the Arkansas School for the Deaf and the relocation of the Arkansas School for the Blind. During Clayton's Reconstruction governorship, the Arkansas Republican party splintered in the face of serious opposition from conservatives. Clayton and his supporters were known locally as \\"Minstrels\\", they dominated the Republican party and were able to secure recognition from the National Republican organization and control the federal patronage in the state. This position garnered Clayton few friends at the state Republican party level and he faced repeated challenges to his leadership. In 1868, Joseph Brooks who had been a partner with Clayton in the formation of the Arkansas Republican party, broke with Clayton and formed a faction known as the \\"Brindletails\\". Brooks opposition to Clayton developed partly due to Clayton's increasingly moderate stance toward ex-Confederates but also due to Clayton's displacement of Brooks as leader of the Arkansas Republican party. In 1869, Lieutenant Governor James M. Johnson charged Clayton with corruption in the issuance of railroad bonds and misuse of power in his program to suppress violence. The supporters of Johnson, mostly white Republicans from Northwest Arkansas called themselves Liberal Republicans. The Brindletails managed to impeach Clayton in 1871 but he withstood the challenge and the legislature never heard the case against the governor. =U.S. Senator: 1871‚Äì1877= In January 1871, the Arkansas legislature elected Clayton to the United States Senate which initiated another controversy of Clayton's administration. Clayton did not want to accept the Senate seat and have his political opponent and lieutenant governor James M. Johnson succeed him as governor. Instead, Clayton refused the Senate position and negotiated Johnson's appointment as Secretary of State of Arkansas and replaced Johnson with Ozra Hadley. In March 1871, the legislature again elected Clayton to the U.S. Senate which he accepted this time. In January 1872, the U.S. Senate Joint Select Committee to Inquire into the Condition of the Late Insurrectionary States heard testimony raising questions about Clayton's behavior and integrity as governor. A United States district attorney testified that in April 1871, after Clayton became U.S. Senator, a grand jury had indicted him on charges that as governor Clayton issued fraudulent election credentials for the U.S. House of Representatives election to John Edwards. In response to these allegations, Clayton contended that in eight precincts, there had been two separate sets of polls. One set was overseen by authorized judges and the other under the unauthorized control of opposing political factions. The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the legal election had been held at the authorized polling places and that returns from the others were fraudulent. As governor, Clayton discarded the returns from the fraudulent polling places and certified the candidate who won from the genuine votes. The opposing candidate, Thomas Boles, contested the election and replaced John Edwards in the U.S. House of Representatives in February 1872. The committee judged the issue to be beyond its jurisdiction and turned the matter over to the Senate. At Clayton's request, the Senate appointed a special three-member committee to investigate the charges. In June 1872, after interviewing thirty-eight witnesses and generating five thousand pages of transcript, the committee issued a partial report indicating that the testimony appeared to not sustain the charges against Clayton. The committee noted that the charges came from Clayton's bitter political rivals and that the indictment against Clayton had been dropped due to lack of evidence. However, the committee members stated that they required additional time and would issue a final report in the next session of the Senate. In February 1873, the committee issued its final report declaring that the testimony failed to sustain the charges against Clayton and that there was no evidence that he had any fraudulent intent in certifying the election of Edwards as directed by the state supreme court. The Senate voted 33 to 6 to accept the committee's findings. Nine senators, mostly Democrats, abstained from voting on the grounds that they had been given insufficient time to review all of the testimony. While in the Senate, Clayton appealed to his brother, William H.H. Clayton, the US Attorney in Arkansas, and President Ulysses S. Grant to have Judge Isaac Parker reassigned from Utah to Fort Smith, Arkansas, a frontier area with a high rate of violence and crime. Parker, the legendary \\"Hanging Judge,\\" along with U.S. Attorney Clayton, are credited with bringing law and order to the region. In 1877, Clayton lost his Senate seat since the legislature, now dominated by Democrats elected one of their own to the Senate. Clayton returned to Little Rock, Arkansas where he practiced law and supported economic development. Later life and death Clayton at the 1912 Republican National Convention held at the Chicago Coliseum, Chicago, Illinois. In 1882, Clayton established a home at the developing resort town of Eureka Springs in Carroll County in northwestern Arkansas. He and his wife lived in what is now the Crescent Cottage Inn.\\"Crescent Cottage Inn\\" As president of the Eureka Springs Improvement Company (ESIC), Clayton worked to develop commercial and residential structures, many which still exist. ESIC sponsored the development of the Eureka Springs Railroad which was key to making the resort accessible to tourists. The ESIC also built the Crescent Hotel, now one of Eureka Springs' most notable landmarks. A poem on the fireplace in the lobby of the Crescent Hotel is attributed to Clayton\\"History: Powell Clayton\\" , Eureka Vacation In 1883, Clayton became the president of the Eureka Springs Railway, which provided service to the resort community until 1889, when it was merged into what became the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad. The now-defunct railroad line provided passenger and freight service from Joplin, Missouri, to Helena in Phillips County in eastern Arkansas. Clayton remained active in the Republican Party. In 1897, he served as a member of the Republican National Committee. He was appointed as the first ambassador to Mexico by President William McKinley when that post was elevated to an embassy post and served until 1905. While Clayton had resided in Washington, D.C. after resigning from being an Ambassador of Mexico, he was still able to manage multiple businesses and enterprises in Arkansas. He continued to do this, as well as presevering his status in the Republican party. In 1912, Clayton moved to Washington, D.C. and died there on August 25, 1914. He is interred at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.Arlington National Cemetery Personal life On December 14, 1865 Clayton married Adaline McGraw of Helena, Arkansas. Together they had three daughters and two sons although one son died in early infancy. Their son, Powell Clayton, Jr., became a Major in the 16th United States Cavalry and is also buried in Arlington National Cemetery. Two of Clayton's daughters married diplomats from Belgium and England. On September 9, 1868, he lost his left hand while hunting outside Little Rock when his rifle discharged. Clayton had two twin brothers, W. H. H. Clayton and John M. Clayton. These three men made their careers in Arkansas. William was appointed as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Arkansas and served as the chief prosecutor in the court of \\"hanging judge\\" Isaac Parker for 14 years. John was elected as an Arkansas Congressman, Arkansas State Senator and U.S. Congressman-elect. John was assassinated in 1889 in Plumerville, Arkansas. He had disputed the election results of a Congressional race with Democrat Clifton R. Breckinridge and was shot through the window of the boarding-house where he was staying. Clayton's brother Thomas J. Clayton, became a prominent Philadelphia lawyer and a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Pennsylvania for Delaware County, serving for 25 years.

","title":"Powell Clayton"},{"id":"293482","text":"The Guoqing Temple on Tiantai Mountain, originally built in 598 during the Sui dynasty and renovated during the reign of the Qing Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722-35). Tiantai or T'ien-t'ai () is a school of Buddhism in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam that reveres the Lotus Sutra as the highest teaching in Buddhism. In Japan the school is known as Tendai, in Korea as Cheontae, and in Vietnam as Thi√™n thai. The name is derived from the fact that Zhiyi (538‚Äì597 CE), the fourth patriarch, lived on Tiantai Mountain. Zhiyi is also regarded as the first major figure to make a significant break from the Indian tradition, to form an indigenous Chinese system. Tiantai is sometimes also called \\"The Lotus School\\", after the central role of the Lotus Sutra in its teachings. During the Sui dynasty, the Tiantai school became one of the leading schools of Chinese Buddhism, with numerous large temples supported by emperors and wealthy patrons. The school's influence waned and was revived again through the Tang dynasty and also rose again during the Song dynasty. Its doctrine and practices had an influence on Chinese Chan and Pure land Buddhism. History Unlike earlier schools of Chinese Buddhism, the Tiantai school was entirely of Chinese origin. The schools of Buddhism that had existed in China prior to the emergence of the Tiantai are generally believed to represent direct transplantations from India, with little modification to their basic doctrines and methods. However, Tiantai grew and flourished as a native Chinese Buddhist school under the 4th patriarch, Zhiyi, who developed an original and extensive Chinese Buddhist system of doctrine and practice through his many treatises and commentaries. Over time, the Tiantai school became doctrinally broad, able to absorb and give rise to other movements within Buddhism, though without any formal structure. The tradition emphasized both scriptural study and meditative practice, and taught the rapid attainment of Buddhahood through observing the mind. The school is largely based on the teachings of Zhiyi, Zhanran, and Zhili, who lived between the 6th and 11th centuries in China. These teachers took an approach called \\"classification of teachings\\" (panjiao Âà§Êïô) in an attempt to harmonize the numerous and often contradictory Buddhist texts that had come into China. This was achieved through a particular interpretation of the Lotus S≈´tra. =Early figures= Due to the use of NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's philosophy of the Middle Way, he is traditionally taken to be the first patriarch of the Tiantai school. The sixth century dhyƒÅna master Huiwen () is traditionally considered to be the second patriarch of the Tiantai school. Huiwen studied the works of NƒÅgƒÅrjuna, and is said to have awakened to the profound meaning of NƒÅgƒÅrjuna's words: \\"All conditioned phenomena I speak of as empty, and are but false names which also indicate the mean.\\" Huiwen later transmitted his teachings to Chan master Nanyue Huisi (, 515-577), who is traditionally figured as the third patriarch. During meditation, he is said to have realized the \\"Lotus SamƒÅdhi\\", indicating enlightenment and Buddhahood. He authored the MahƒÅyƒÅna-≈õamatha-vipa≈õyanƒÅ. Huisi then transmitted his teachings to Zhiyi (, 538-597), traditionally figured as the fourth patriarch of Tiantai, who is said to have practiced the Lotus SamƒÅdhi and to have become enlightened quickly. He authored many treatises such as explanations of the Buddhist texts, and especially systematic manuals of various lengths which explain and enumerate methods of Buddhist practice and meditation. The above lineage was proposed by Buddhists of later times and do not reflect the popularity of the monks at that time.È£éÁ©¥ÂØ∫‰∏é‰∏¥ÊµéÂÆó =Zhiyi= Painting of ≈örama·πáa Zhiyi Scholars such as Paul Loren Swanson consider Zhiyi (Chinese: Êô∫È°ó, 538‚Äì597 CE) to have been the major founder of the Tiantai school as well as one of the greatest Chinese Buddhist philosophers. He was the first to systematize and popularize the complex synthesis of Tiantai doctrine as an original Chinese tradition.Swanson, Paul Loren. Foundations of T ªien-T ªai Philosophy: The Flowering of the Two Truths Theory in Chinese Buddhism, Asian Humanities Press, 1989, page ix Zhiyi analyzed and organized all the ƒÄgamas and Mahayana sutras into a system of five periods and eight types of teachings. For example, many elementary doctrines and bridging concepts had been taught early in the Buddha's advent when the vast majority of the people during his time were not yet ready to grasp the 'ultimate truth'. These ƒÄgamas were an upaya, or skillful means - an example of the Buddha employing his boundless wisdom to lead those people towards the truth. Subsequent teachings delivered to more advanced followers thus represent a more complete and accurate picture of the Buddha's teachings, and did away with some of the philosophical 'crutches' introduced earlier. Zhiyi's classification culminated with the Lotus Sutra, which he held to be the supreme synthesis of Buddhist doctrine. The difference on Zhiyi's explanation to the Golden Light Sutra caused a debate during the Song dynasty.Ë´ñÂÆã‰ª£Â§©Âè∞ÂÆóÂ±±ÂÆ∂„ÄÅÂ±±Â§ñ‰πãÁà≠ Zhiyi's Tiantai school received much imperial support during the Sui dynasty, because of this, it was the largest Buddhist school at the beginning of the Tang and thus suffered because of its close relationship with the house of Sui.William M. Johnston (editor). Encyclopedia of Monasticism: A-L =Zhanran= Illustration of Zhanran After Zhiyi, Tiantai was eclipsed for a time by newer schools such as the East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra (F«éxi√†ng-z≈çng), and Huayan schools, until the 6th patriarch Jingxi Zhanran (711-782) revived the school and defended its doctrine against rival schools such as the Huayen and Faxiang.Groner, Paul (2000). Saicho : The Establishment of the Japanese Tendai School. University of Hawaii Press. pp. 228‚Äì229. . The debates between the Faxiang school and the Tiantai school concerning the notion of universal Buddhahood were particularly heated, with the Faxiang school asserting that different beings had different natures and therefore would reach different states of enlightenment, while the Tiantai school argued in favor of the Lotus Sutra teaching of Buddhahood for all beings. Zhanran's view of Buddha nature was expanded in his Jingangpi or \\"Diamond Scalpel,\\" which is the 'locus classicus' of the doctrine of \\"the Buddha-nature of Insentient Beings.\\" According to Shuman Chen, Zhanran: > provides his rationale primarily from the perspective of the all-pervasive > quality of Buddha-nature, which he considers synonymous with suchness. This > rationale indicates that external tangible objects like water, buildings, > and flora, formless sounds and smells, and internal thoughts or ideas all > possess Buddha-nature. This is because Sakyamuni Buddha and any other > Buddha‚Äôs meritorious qualities in their practice leading to enlightenment > and in the resultant realization do not reject anything, instead embracing > all. In the Tiantai terminology, the Buddha and all beings mutually include, > inter-pervade, and are identical to each other.Shuman Chen. Buddha-Nature of > Insentient Beings. Encyclopedia of Psychology and Religion , 2nd ed., vol. > 1, pp. 208-212, 2014 =Post-Tang crisis and Song revival= After Zhanran, Tiantai declined once again. Brook Ziporyn writes that this period has been seen as the second dark age of Tiantai, a state of crisis \\"extending from the Tang into the Five Dynasties and Northern Song, an age marked internally by the deterioration of distinctive Tiantai ideas and marked externally by the loss of crucial texts and monastic institutions, especially after the persecution of 845 (a period that saw the increased influence of Chan).\\"Ziporyn, Brook (1994). Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies 17 (1), 26-65 During this period, Huayan and Chan influences made strong inroads into Tiantai thought. Zhanran's disciple and seventh patriarch Daosui, and syncretic figures such as Zhi Yuan (768-844) and Daochang Ningfen all combined Tiantai with Chan ideas (particularly of the Heze school).Ziporyn, Brook (1994). Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies 17 (1), 26-65 Daosui (Chinese: ÈÅìÈÇÉ; pinyin: D√†osu√¨), is important because he was the primary teacher of Saich≈ç, the founder of the Japanese Tiantai tradition (known in Japanese as Tendai). Other Tiantai syncretists include Deshao (881-972) who was associated with the Fayen branch of Chan and his student Yongming Yenshou (954-974) who attempted to unify Tiantai, Huayen and Yogacara teachings under a kind of idealism influenced by Zongmi, emphasizing what he called the \\"one pure formless mind\\".Ziporyn, Brook (1994). Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies 17 (1), 26-65 This situation led to the famous debate within the Tiantai school known as the \\"home mountain\\" (shanjia) vs. \\"off mountain\\" (shanwai) debate. \\"Off mountain\\" supporters, as they were later polemically termed, supported these new doctrines (such as the \\"one pure mind\\") claiming they were originally Tiantai doctrines, while \\"home mountain\\" supporters saw the original Tiantai view as different and superior to this new view influenced by Chan and Huayan doctrines (especially by Zongmi's works).Ziporyn, Brook. Anti-Chan Polemics in Post-Tang Tiantai. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 17 ‚Ä¢ Number 1 ‚Ä¢ Summer 1994 The most eminent figure during this debate was Patriarch Siming Zhili (960-1028), who wrote various commentaries on Zhiyi's works and defended the \\"Home mountain\\" view. Zhili's major criticisms included attacking Chan's failure to understand the necessity of the use of words and scriptural study as part of practice as well as criticizing Zongmi's view of a pure mind as the buddha-nature, arguing instead that the \\"three truths\\" as taught by Zhiyi are the ultimate reality. For Zhili, mind or consciousness has no special status relative to other types of dharmas, such as physical matter.Ziporyn, Brook. Anti-Chan Polemics in Post- Tang Tiantai. Journal of the international Association of Buddhist Studies Volume 17 ‚Ä¢ Number 1 ‚Ä¢ Summer 1994 Over time, Zhili's \\"home mountain\\" view turned out to be victorious, and his works became part of the orthodox Tiantai canon during the Song dynasty.Randall L. Nadeau (editor). The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions, pg. 107 Ciyun Zunshi (964-1032) was another important figure in this second Tiantai revival. His work focused on the promotion of rituals for lay Buddhists and worked on converting the populace away from using blood, meat and alcohol for funerary and ancestral rites. Ciyi also promoted the practice of adopting local Chinese deities and spirits into the Buddhist religion as \\"vassals\\" or \\"retainers\\" and strongly promoted repentance rituals.Randall L. Nadeau (editor). The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions, pg. 108 These two figures were also associated with the popularization of Pure Land practices through the foundation of lay societies (lotus societies, lianshe). Tiantai monk Mao Ziyuan (1096?-1166) took this one step further by establishing what became known as the \\"White Lotus Society\\" which allowed both men and women to attend together and even to preach and be in charge of society repentance halls as married clergy.Randall L. Nadeau (editor). The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Chinese Religions, pg. 109 Due to the efforts of these major Tiantai figures, the school became one of the dominant forms of Buddhism during the Song, alongside of Chan.Walsh, Michael J. Review of Buddhism in the Sung Edited by Peter N. Gregory and Daniel A. Getz =Yuan, Ming and Qing= The defeat of the Song dynasty was a serious blow to Tiantai which suffered another setback during the Yuan dynasty which supported Tibetan Buddhism, while Chan Buddhism continued to grow in popularity while attacking the legitimacy of other schools.Ma, Yung-fen. The Revival of Tiantai Buddhism in the Late Ming: On the Thought of Youxi Chuandeng (1554-1628), 2011, page 95 This period saw the Tiantai figure Huxi Huaize (fl. 1310) write his polemical treatise Record of Tiantai‚Äôs Transmission of the Buddha‚Äôs Mind-seal as an effort to defend the Tiantai tradition against Chan critiques.Ma, Yung-fen.

Jikai Dehn, Mohe Zhiguan study materials, http://tendaiaustralia.org.au/documents/MoheZhiguanOutline.pdf In addition to its doctrinal basis in Indian Buddhist texts, the Tiantai school also created its own meditation texts which emphasize the principles of ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ. Of the Tiantai meditation treatises, Zhiyi's Concise ≈öamatha- vipa≈õyanƒÅ (Â∞èÊ≠¢Ë¶≥), MahƒÅ-≈õamatha-vipa≈õyanƒÅ (Êë©Ë®∂Ê≠¢Ë¶≥), and Six Subtle Dharma Gates (ÂÖ≠Â¶ôÊ≥ïÈñÄ) are the most widely read in China.

This classification is usually attributed to Zhiyi, but is probably a later development. The classification of teachings was also done by other schools, such as the Fivefold Classification of the Huayan school. =Five Periods= The Five Periods are five periods in the life of the Buddha in which he delivered different teachings, aimed at different audiences with a different level of understanding: # The Period of Avatamsaka. During twenty-one days after his Enlightenment, the buddha delivered the Avatamsaka Sutra. # The Period of Agamas. During twelve years, the Buddha preached the Agamas for the Hinayana, including the Four Noble Truths and dependent origination. # The Period of Vaipulya. During eight years, the Buddha delivered the Mahayana teachings, such as the Vimalakirti Sutra, the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅdevƒ´ S≈´tra, the Suvarnaprabhasa Sutra and other Mahayana sutras. # The Period of Prajna. During twenty-two years, the Buddha explained emptiness in the Prajnaparamita-sutras. # The Period of Saddharmapundarika and Nirvana Sutra. In the last eight years, the Buddha preached the doctrine of the One Buddha Vehicle, and delivered the Lotus Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra just before his death. =Eight Teachings= The Eight Teachings consist of the Four Doctrines, and the Fourfold Methods. Four Doctrines # Tripitaka Teaching: the Sutra, Vinaya and Abhidhamma, in which the basic teachings are explained # Shared Teaching: the teaching of emptiness # Distinctive Teaching: aimed at the Bodhisattva # Perfect Teaching - the Chinese teachings of the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka Sutra Fourfold Methods # Gradual Teaching, for those with medium or inferior abilities # Sudden Teaching, the Distinctive Teachings and the Complete Teaching for those with superior abilities # Secret Teaching, teachings which are transmitted without the recipient being aware of it # Variable Teaching, no fixed teaching, but various teachings for various persons and circumstances Teachings David Chappell lists the most important teachings as the doctrines of: * The Threefold Truth, * The Threefold Contemplation, * The Fourfold Teachings, * The Subtle Dharma, * The Nonconceivable Discernment. Nan Huai-Chin, a 20th-century Chan teacher, summarizes the main teaching of the Tiantai school as the following: * The One Vehicle (Skt. EkayƒÅna), * The vehicle of attaining Buddhahood, as the main principle; * The three forms of ≈õamatha-vipa≈õyanƒÅ correlated with the meditative perspectives of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ, * The mean, as the method of cultivating realization. =The Threefold Truth= The Tiantai school took up the principle of The Threefold Truth, derived from NƒÅgƒÅrjuna: # Phenomena are empty of self-nature, # Phenomena exist provisionally from a worldly perspective, # Phenomena are both empty of existence and exist provisionally at once. The transient world of phenomena is thus seen as one with the unchanging, undifferentiated substratum of existence. This doctrine of interpenetration is reflected in the Tiantai teaching of three thousand realms in a single moment of thought. The Threefold Truth has its basis in NƒÅgƒÅrjuna: All things arise through causes and conditions. That I declare as emptiness. It is also a provisional designation. It is also the meaning of the Middle Path. =Three Contemplations= While the Three Truths are essentially one, they may be recognized separately as one undertakes the Three Contemplations: # The first contemplation involves moving from the world of provisionality to the world of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ. # The second contemplation is moving back from the world of emptiness to the world of provisionality with an acceptance thereof. # The third contemplation involves balancing the previous two by following the Middle Path. =The Fourfold Teachings= The Three Contemplations and Threefold Truth in turn form the basis of the Fourfold Teachings, making them \\"parallel structures\\". Meditation-practice According to Charles Luk, in China it has been traditionally held that the meditation methods of the Tiantai are the most systematic and comprehensive of all. Tiantai emphasizes ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ meditation. Regarding the functions of ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ in meditation, Zhiyi writes in his work Concise ≈öamatha-vipa≈õyanƒÅ: In Zhiyi's magnum opus, the \\"Great Samatha-Vipasyana\\", he outlined his meditation system as consisting of 25 preparatory practices, four kinds of samadhi and ten modes of contemplation. Zhiyi saw the four samadhis as the main pillar of Tiantai meditation practice. Zhiyi writes: > Now if you wish to ascend to the stage of wondrous realization, you will not > be able to reach it unless you practice. But if you become skilled at > stirring and agitating [the raw milk], then the essence of ghee may be > obtained. The Lotus Sutra says, \\"I also see the sons of Buddha cultivating > all manner of practices in order to seek the path to Buddhahood.\\" There are > many methods of practice, but we may summarize them under four sorts: (I) > constantly sitting, (2) constantly walking, (3) part walking part sitting, > and (4) neither walking nor sitting. By referring to them collectively as > \\"samadhis,\\" we mean [that one thereby] attunes, rectifies, and stabilizes > [the mind]. The Ta-[chih-tu]lun (\\"Great [Perfection of Wisdom] Treatise\\") > says, \\"Skillfully to fix the mind on one spot and abide there without > shifting-that is called samadhi.\\"\\" The Dharmadhatu is a \\"single spot,\\" and > through true discernment you can abide there and never stray from it. These > four types of activity constitute the supporting condition [for meditation]. > By discerning the mind and resorting to the supporting condition [of the > four activities], one attunes and rectifies [the mind]. For this reason we > call them samadhis.\\"Gregory, Peter N. Traditions of Meditation in Chinese > Buddhism, page 49 The Tiantai school also places a great emphasis on Mindfulness of Breathing (Skt. ') in accordance with the principles of ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ. Zhiyi classifies breathing into four main categories: Panting (Âñò), Unhurried breathing (È¢®), Deep and quiet breathing (Ê∞£), and Stillness or rest (ÊÅØ). Zhiyi holds that the first three kinds of breathing are incorrect, while the fourth is correct, and that the breathing should reach stillness and rest. Influence David Chappell writes that although the Tiantai school, \\"has the reputation of being...the most comprehensive and diversified school of Chinese Buddhism, it is almost unknown in the West\\" despite having a \\"religious framework that seemed suited to adapt to other cultures, to evolve new practices, and to universalize Buddhism\\". He attributes this failure of expansion to the school having \\"narrowed its practice to a small number of rituals\\" and because it has \\"neglected the intellectual breadth and subtlety of its founder\\".

Tiantai was introduced to Korea a couple of times during earlier periods, but was not firmly established until the time of Uicheon (1055-1101) who established Cheontae in Goryeo as an independent school. Due to Uicheon's influence, it came to be a major force in the world of Goryeo Buddhism. After he returned from Song China in 1086, Uicheon sought to ease conflict between the doctrinal Gyo () schools and Seon () schools, believing that the Cheontae doctrine would be effective to this end. Cheontae doctrine holds the Lotus Sutra as the peak of the Buddha's teachings, and postulates the following: * All things are empty and without essential reality. * All things have a provisional reality. * All things are both absolutely unreal and provisionally real at once. In accordance with the Cheontae doctrine, all experiences in the sensory world are in fact expressions of Buddhist law (Dharma), and therefore contain the key to enlightenment. This explains the extravagant altars and the colorful details found at Cheontae temples, differing from the austere aesthetic of the Seon (Zen) school. Cheontae as a school has been largely absorbed into the Jogye Seon tradition, but an independent Cheontae school has been revived and has an estimated 2 million adherents. The school's headquarters are at Guinsa in Chungcheongbuk-do, near Danyang. The school also funds and operates the Buddhist university, Geumgang University.

The Tendai school rose to prominence during the Heian period (794-1185), gradually eclipsing the powerful YogƒÅcƒÅra school (Hoss≈ç-sh≈´) and competing with the upcoming Shingon Buddhism to become the most influential at the Imperial court. However, political entanglements during the Genpei War (1180‚Äì1185) led many disaffected monks to leave, and in some cases to establish their own schools of Buddhism such as J≈çdo-sh≈´, Nichiren-sh≈´ and the S≈çt≈ç school of Zen. Destruction of the head temple of Mount Hiei by warlord Oda Nobunaga, as well as the geographic shift of the capital away from Kyoto to Edo, further weakened Tendai's influence. In Chinese and Japanese, its name is identical to Tiantai, its parent school of Chinese Buddhism; both Tiantai and Tendai hold the Lotus Sutra as the ultimate teaching of the Buddha and revere the teachings of Tiantai's founder Zhiyi. In English, the Japanese romanization distinguishes the particularly Japanese history of the school and its innovations. These include an exclusive use of the Bodhisattva Precepts for ordination, an emphasis on the \\"Four Integrated Schools\\", and Saich≈ç's focus on the \\"One Vehicle\\" teaching. David W. Chappell frames the relevance of Tendai for a universal Buddhism:Chappell, David W. (1987). 'Is Tendai Buddhism Relevant to the Modern World?' in Japanese Journal of Religious Studies 1987 14/2-3. Source: Nanzan Univ.; accessed: Saturday August 16, 2008. p.247  History  Painting of Saich≈ç, founder of the Tendai sect in Japan = Foundation = Although Jianzhen (Jp. Ganjin) had brought Tiantai teachings to Japan as early as 754, its teachings did not take root until generations later when Saich≈ç, a monk, joined the Japanese missions to Imperial China in 804. The future founder of Shingon Buddhism, K≈´kai, also traveled on the same mission; however, the two were on separate ships and never saw one another once they arrived in China. From the city of Ningbo (then called M√≠ngzh≈çu ÊòéÂ∑û), Saich≈ç was introduced by the governor to D√†osu√¨ (ÈÅìÈÇÉ), who was the seventh Tiantai patriarch, and later he journeyed to Tiantai Mountain for further study. After receiving initiations in Chan and Chinese Esoteric traditions at Tiantai Mountain, Saich≈ç devoted much of his time to making accurate copies of Tiantai texts and studying under D√†osu√¨. By the sixth month of 805, Saicho had returned to Japan along with the official mission to China. Because of the Imperial Court's interest in Tiantai as well as esoteric Buddhism, Saich≈ç quickly rose in prominence upon his return. He was asked by Emperor Kanmu to perform various esoteric rituals, and Saich≈ç also sought recognition from the Emperor for a new, independent school of Tiantai in Japan. Because the emperor sought to reduce the power of the Hoss≈ç school, he granted this request, but with the stipulation that the new \\"Tendai\\" school would have two programs: one for esoteric Buddhism and one for meditation. However, Emperor Kanmu died shortly thereafter, and Saich≈ç was not allocated any ordinands until 809 with the reign of Emperor Saga. Saich≈ç's choice of establishing his community at Mount Hiei also proved fortuitous because it was located to the northeast of the new capital of Kyoto and thus was auspicious in terms of Chinese geomancy as the city's protector. The remainder of Saich≈ç's life was spent in heated debates with notable Hoss≈ç figures, particularly Tokuitsu, and maintaining an increasingly strained relationship with K≈´kai to broaden his understanding of esoteric Buddhism. Finally, Saich≈ç's efforts were also devoted to developing a \\"Mahayana-only\\" ordination platform that required the Bodhisattva Precepts of the Brahmajala Sutra only, and not the pratimok·π£a code of the Dharmaguptaka vinaya, which was traditionally used in East Asian Buddhist monasticism. By the time that Saich≈ç died in 822, his yearly petition was finally granted and the traditional \\"Four Part Vinaya\\" () was replaced by the Bodhisattva Precepts for the Tendai. = Growth and Development after Saich≈ç = Seven days after Saich≈ç died, the Imperial Court granted permission for the Tendai to exclusively use the Bodhisattva Precepts for its ordination process. This effectively allowed Tendai to use an ordination platform separate from the powerful schools in Nara. Gishin, Saich≈ç's disciple and the first , presided over the first allotted ordinands in 827. Further, the Tendai order underwent efforts to deepen its understanding of teachings that Saich≈ç had brought back, particularly esoteric Buddhism. Saich≈ç had only received initiation in the Diamond Realm Mandala, and since the rival Shingon school under K≈´kai had received deeper training, early Tendai monks felt it necessary to return to China for further initiation and instruction. Saich≈ç's disciple Ennin went to China in 838 and returned ten years later with a more thorough understanding of esoteric, Pure Land, and Tiantai teachings. By 864, Tendai monks were now appointed to the powerful with the naming of An'e (ÂÆâÊÖß) as the provisional vinaya master. Other examples include Enchin's appointment to the Office of Monastic Affairs in 883. While Saich≈ç had opposed the Office during his lifetime, within a few generations disciples were now gifted with positions in the Office by the Imperial Family. By this time, Japanese Buddhism was dominated by the Tendai school to a much greater degree than Chinese Buddhism was by its forebearer, the Tiantai.  Head of the Tendai Order  For reference, the first eight after Saich≈ç were: # Gishin (Áæ©Áúü) # Ench≈ç (ÂÜÜÊæÑ) # Ennin (ÂÜÜ‰ªÅ) # An'e (ÂÆâÊÖß) # Enchin (ÂÜÜÁèç) # Yuishu (ÊÉüÈ¶ñ) # Y≈´ken(Áå∑ÊÜ≤) # K≈çsai (Â∫∑Ê∏à) Appointments as zasu typically only lasted a few years, thus among the same generation of disciples, a number could be appointed zasu in one's lifetime. = Divisions within the Order = Philosophically, the Tendai school did not deviate substantially from the beliefs that had been created by the Tiantai school in China. However, what Saich≈ç transmitted from China was not exclusively Tiantai, but also included Zen (Á¶™), the esoteric Mikky≈ç (ÂØÜÊïô), and Vinaya School (ÊàíÂæã) elements. The tendency to include a range of teachings became more marked in the doctrines of Saich≈ç's successors, such as Ennin (Âúì‰ªÅ) and Enchin (ÂúìÁèç). However, in later years, this range of teachings began to form sub-schools within Tendai Buddhism. By the time of Ry≈çgen, there were two distinct groups on Mt. Hiei, the Jimon and Sanmon: the Sammon-ha \\"Mountain Group\\" (Â±±ÈñÄÊ¥æ) followed Ennin and the Jimon-ha \\"Temple Group\\" (ÂØ∫ÈñÄÊ¥æ) followed Enchin. = Later Years = Although the Tendai sect flourished under the patronage of the Imperial House of Japan and the noble classes, by the end of the Heian, it experienced an increasing breakdown in monastic discipline, plus political entanglements with rival factions of the Genpei War, namely the Taira and Minamoto clans. Due to its patronage and growing popularity among the upper classes, the Tendai sect became not only respected, but also politically and even militarily powerful, with major temples each fielding their own monastic armies of s≈çhei (warrior-monks). This was not unusual for major temples at the time, as rival schools also fielded armies, such as the head temple of the YogƒÅcƒÅra school, K≈çfuku-ji. With the outbreak of the Genpei War, Tendai temples even fought one another, such as Mount Hiei clashing with Mii-dera depending on their political affiliations. A number of low-ranking monks of the Tendai became dissatisfied and sought to establish independent schools of their own. Such founders as Nichiren, H≈çnen, Shinran, Eisai and D≈çgen‚Äîall famous thinkers in non-Tendai schools of Japanese Buddhism‚Äîwere all initially trained as Tendai monks. Tendai practices and monastic organization were adopted to some degree or another by each of these new schools, but one common feature of each school was a more narrowly-focused set of practices (e.g. daimoku for the Nichiren school, zazen for Zen, nembutsu for Pure Land schools, etc.) in contrast to the more integrated approach of the Tendai. Although a number of breakaway schools rose during the Kamakura period, the Tendai school used its patronage to try to oppose the growth of these rival factions‚Äîparticularly Nichiren Buddhism, which began to grow in power among the merchant middle class, and Pure Land Buddhism, which eventually came to claim the loyalty of many of the poorer classes. Enryaku-ji, the temple complex on Mount Hiei, became a sprawling center of power, attended not only by ascetic monks, but also by brigades of s≈çhei who fought in the temple's interest. As a result, in 1571 Enryaku-ji was razed by Oda Nobunaga as part of his campaign to unify Japan. Nobunaga regarded the Mount Hiei monks as a potential threat or rival, as they could employ religious claims to attempt to rally the populace to their side. The temple complex was later rebuilt, and continues to serve as the head Tendai temple today.  Tendai doctrine  A priest from the Japanese Tendai school of Buddhism Tendai Buddhism can be summed up in the following quotation: Tendai Buddhism has several philosophical insights which allow for the reconciliation of Buddhist doctrine with aspects of Japanese culture such as Shinto and traditional aesthetics. It is rooted in the idea, fundamental to Mahayana Buddhism, that Buddha-hood, the capability to attain enlightenment, is intrinsic in all things. Also central to Mahayana is the notion that the phenomenal world, the world of our experiences, fundamentally is an expression of the Buddhist law (Dharma). This notion poses the problem of how we come to have many differentiated experiences. Tendai Buddhism claims that each and every sense phenomenon just as it is is the expression of Dharma. For Tendai, the ultimate expression of Dharma is the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, the fleeting nature of all sense experiences consists in the Buddha's preaching of the doctrine of Lotus Sutra. The existence and experience of all unenlightened beings is fundamentally equivalent and undistinguishable from the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. = Lotus Sutra as the Highest Teaching in Buddhism = Tendai Buddhism, in keeping with Tiantai, reveres the Lotus Sutra as the highest teaching in Buddhism. In Saich≈ç's writings, he frequently used the terminology to imply it was the culmination of the previous sermons given by Gautama Buddha. Further, because of the central importance of the Lotus Sutra, Tendai Buddhism includes such teachings as: * All Buddhist teachings and practices fit into a single \\"vehicle\\". Saich≈ç frequently used the term and referred to the second chapter of the Lotus Sutra for his scriptural basis. * All beings have the potential for full buddhahood. This teaching in particular was a major point of contention with the powerful Hoss≈ç school in Japan who espoused the . The heated debates between Saich≈ç and Tokuitsu frequently addressed this controversy and mirrored similar debates in China. * The importance of . Tendai Buddhism uses a similar hierarchy as the Tiantai in to classify the various other sutras in the canon in relation to the Lotus Sutra, and it also follows Zhiyi's original conception of Five Periods Eight Teachings or . This is based on the doctrine of expedient means, but was also a common practice among East Asian schools trying to sort the vast corpus of writing inherited from Indian Buddhism. = Integrating the Four Schools of Practice = A feature unique to Japanese Tendai Buddhism from its inception was the concept of . Under the umbrella of the Lotus Sutra, Tendai integrates four different aspects of practice: * Pure Land practices - veneration of AmitƒÅbha, recitation of the Buddha's name (nembutsu), etc. * Dhyana meditation - which comprises both samatha and vipassanƒÅ meditation. In Japanese Tendai, this is called meditation. Much of this comes from the writings of Zhiyi and Tiantai. * Esoteric practices, also known as . * Precepts, in particular the Bodhisattva Precepts. Senior teachers, or ajari, train in all four schools. In addition, sutras from each of these schools are revered, chanted and studied in Tendai. =The Doctrine of Original Enlightenment= Stone holds that: > In the early decades of the twentieth century, Buddhologist Shimaji Daito > (1875‚Äì1927) introduced to the Japanese academic world a new interpretive > category, which he called \\"original enlightenment thought\\" (Jpn. hongaku > shiso).

Source: (accessed: Thursday April 22, 2010), p.3 = Tendai and Pure Land Buddhism = Practices related to and veneration of AmitƒÅbha and his Sukhavati in the Tendai tradition began with Saich≈ç's disciple, Ennin. After journeying to China for further study and training, he brought back a practice called the \\"five-tone nembutsu\\" or , which was a form of intonation practiced in China for reciting the Buddha's name. This contrasted with earlier practices in Japan starting in the Nara period, where meditation on images of the Pure Land, typically in the form of mandala, were practiced. However, both meditation on the Pure Land (kans≈ç nenbutsu Ë¶≥ÊÉ≥Âøµ‰ªè) and recitation of the Buddha's name (sh≈çmy≈ç nenbutsu Áß∞ÂêçÂøµ‰ªè) became an integral part of Pure Land practices in the Tendai tradition. In addition to the five-tone nembutsu brought back from China, Ennin also integrated a special monastic training program called the originally promulgated by Zhiyi. In this practice, monks spend 90 days in retreat, circumambulating a statue of AmitƒÅbha constantly reciting his name. In addition to increasing monastic practices related to the Pure Land, monks also taught Pure Land practices to the lay community in the form of reciting the Buddha's name. The most famous of these was a monk named K≈´ya (Á©∫‰πü, 903-972). Pure Land Buddhist thought was further developed by a Tendai monk named Genshin (Ê∫ê‰ø°, 942-1017) who was a disciple of Ry≈çgen, the 18th chief abbot or zasu (Â∫ß‰∏ª) of Mount Hiei. Genshin wrote an influential treatise called , which vividly contrasted the Sukhavati Pure Land of AmitƒÅbha with the descriptions of the hell realms in Buddhism. Further, Genshin promoted the popular notion of the Latter Age of the Dharma, which posited that society had degenerated to a point when they could no longer rely on traditional Buddhist practices, and would instead need to rely solely on AmitƒÅbha's grace to escape sa·πÉsƒÅra. Genshin drew upon past Chinese Pure Land teachers such as Daochuo and Shandao. Finally, Pure Land practices in Tendai were further popularized by former Tendai monk H≈çnen, who established the first independent Pure Land school, the J≈çdo-sh≈´, and whose disciples carried the teachings to remote provinces in one form or another. This includes another ex-Tendai monk named Shinran, who eventually established the related J≈çdo Shinsh≈´. = Tendai and Esoteric Buddhism = A statue of Ennin, an important disciple of Saicho One of the adaptations by the Tendai school was the introduction of esoteric ritual into Tendai Buddhism, which was later named Taimitsu \\"Tendai Esotericism\\" (Âè∞ÂØÜ), distinguishing it from the Shingon Buddhist esoteric lineage known as T≈çmitsu \\"Eastern Esotericism\\" (Êù±ÂØÜ). Eventually, according to Taimitsu doctrine, the esoteric rituals came to be considered of equal importance with the exoteric teachings of the Lotus Sutra. Therefore, by chanting mantras, maintaining mudras, or performing certain meditations, one is able to see that the sense experiences are the teachings of Buddha, have faith that one is inherently an enlightened being, and one can attain enlightenment within this very body. The origins of Taimitsu are found in Chinese Esoteric Buddhism similar to the lineage of K≈´kai, and Saich≈ç's disciples were encouraged to study under him. As a result, Tendai esoteric ritual bears much in common with the explicitly Vajrayana tradition of Shingon, though the underlying doctrines may differ somewhat. Where Shingon sees esoteric teachings as the highest teachings in Buddhism, Tendai sees esoteric teachings as a means to an end in order to understand the profundity of the Lotus Sutra. Another difference is the sutras and mandalas used. Where Shingon emphasizes the Mandala of the Two Realms, and by extension the Mahavairocana Tantra and the Vajrasekhara Sutra, for its esoteric practices, esoteric Tendai adds a third sutra called the SusiddhikƒÅra S≈´tra or and its related tantric practices. Other differences mainly relate to lineages and outlook. The existing lineage began with Saich≈ç; however, his training had largely been limited to the Diamond Realm Mandala only. After Saich≈ç died, Ennin journeyed to China on the last diplomatic mission to China, and after extensive training, returned with both esoteric and Pure Land practices. = Tendai and Shinto = Tendai doctrine allowed Japanese Buddhists to reconcile Buddhist teachings with the native religion of Japan, Shinto, and with traditional Japanese aesthetics. In the case of Shinto, the difficulty is the reconciliation of the pantheon of Japanese gods, as well as with the myriad spirits associated with places, shrines or objects, with the Buddhist doctrine that one should not concern oneself with any religious practice save the pursuit of enlightenment. However, priests of the Tendai sect argued that Kami are simply representations of the truth of universal buddhahood that descend into the world to help mankind. Thus, they were seen as equivalent with Buddhas. This doctrine, however, regards Kami as more sacred. While Buddhas represent the possibility of attaining enlightentment through many lifetimes of work and devotion to Dharma, Kami are seen to be manifest representations of universal buddhahood. They exemplify the doctrine that all things are inherently enlightened and that it is possible for a person of sufficient religious faculties to attain enlightenment instantly within this very body.. Those Kami that Shinto regards as violent or antagonistic to mankind are considered as simply supernatural beings that are violent and evil. = Tendai and Japanese aesthetics = The Buddha taught a Middle Way between the extremes of sensual indulgence and self-mortification. In the context of the Four Noble Truths this meant ceasing the craving (Sanskrit t·πõ·π£·πáƒÅ) of worldly desire and attachment, thus putting an end to suffering (dukkha). In early Buddhism, the emphasis, especially for monastics, was on avoiding activities that might arouse worldly desires. Buddhist art and poetry focused on overtly Buddhist themes. This tendency toward renunciation created a potential conflict with mainstream culture in China and Japan when Buddhism was introduced. Shedding worldly pleasures and attachments might seem to require that such flowers of culture as poetry, literature, and visual arts be given up. However, later Mahayana views developed a different emphasis. By claiming that the phenomenal world is not distinct from Dharma, Tendai doctrine allows for the reconciliation of beauty and aesthetics with Buddhist teachings. Things are to be seen just as they are, as expressions of Dharma. Poetry, instead of being a potential distraction, now in fact can lead to enlightenment. Contemplation of poetry, provided that it is done in the context of Tendai doctrine, is simply contemplation of Dharma. This same thing can be said of other forms of art. Therefore, it is possible to construct an aesthetic that is not in conflict with Buddhism.  Notable Tendai scholars  Ry≈çgen is known generally by the names of Gansan Daishi (left) or Tsuno Daishi (\\"Horned Great Master\\", right). Tsuno Daishi is said to be a portrait of him subjugating y≈´rei. In the history of Tendai school, a number of notable monks have contributed to Tendai thought and administration of Mt. Hiei: * Saich≈ç ‚Äì Founder. * Gishin ‚Äì Second of the Tendai School, who travelled with Saicho to China and ordained alongside him. * Ennin ‚Äì Saicho's successor, the first to try to merge esoteric practices with exoteric Tendai School theories (this merger is now known as \\"Taimitsu\\"), as well as promote nianfo. * Enchin ‚Äì Gishin successor, junior to Ennin.

Boise Cascade Wood Products manufactures plywood, engineered wood products and lumber; it supplies a broad line of wood products and building materials through Boise Cascade Building Materials Distribution's 38 distribution locations. with sales over $4.6 billion in 2019, it is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol BCC. The company has approximately 6,000 employees across North America. Its logo, designed in the 1960s, depicts a pine tree inside the containing circle. The company is not affiliated with the Canadian paper company Cascades. The company is not affiliated with Boise, Inc. or Boise Paper, a division of Packaging Corporation of America.  History  Boise Cascade Corporation was formed in 1957 through the merger of Cascade Lumber Company of Yakima, Washington, and Boise Payette Lumber Company Robert Hansberger of Boise Payette became the CEO, and the new corporation focused on ownership and management of timberlands, the growing and harvesting of timber, and the manufacturing and distribution of lumber products and building materials. By late 1958, the company had established more than 100 retail outlets for its wholesale distribution business. That same year, BC's first paper mill became operational in Wallula, to produce corrugated shipping containers. The 1960s saw the company's swift expansion into the forest products industry, as well as wide variety of other businesses. Boise Cascade owned concrete ready-mix plants, plastic manufacturing plants, textiles, and sand and gravel companies. In 1964, the company entered office products distribution. The mid 1960s brought an even more diverse portfolio including ownership of a motor home manufacturer, a cruise line, involvement in real estate and recreation projects, and an acquisition in the engineering and construction business for major utilities. Boise native William Agee joined the company in 1964 and was the chief financial officer from 1969 the stock price rapidly rose to $77 in 1969, but was down to $15 by the fall Boise Cascade's current headquarters in Boise was built in 1970, designed by architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. With the share price at around eleven dollars, Hansberger resigned in John Fery was promoted to CEO and moved the company back to its core competencies of building materials and As the 1980s progressed, a decline in the housing market led to a downsizing in building products distribution business, and by 1987, all retail outlets had been sold or closed. In the early 1990s, the company sold the wholesale portion of its office products distribution business while keeping the consumer business. In the 1990s, Boise Cascade invested in engineered wood products, building mills in White City, Oregon, and in Alexandria, Louisiana, for producing LVL. Boise Cascade introduced the finger-jointing technique for manufacturing LVL that remains unique to the EWP industry today. After leading the company for 22 years, Fery retired and George Harad was named CEO. During his tenure, the company focused on expanding its activity in distribution and reducing its presence in manufacturing. In 1999, Furman Lumber of Billerica, Massachusetts, was purchased, which led to a nationwide building material wholesale distribution system for Boise Cascade. The next decade continued to bring big changes. In 2003, the company acquired OfficeMax and Boise Cascade Corporation changed its name to OfficeMax. Madison Dearborn Capital Partners purchased the paper, forest products and timberland assets which became Boise Cascade, LLC. When Tom Stephens began as CEO of Boise Cascade, LLC in 2004, the company had incurred $3.2 billion in debt to fund the acquisition. The company's 1.6 million acres of timberlands were sold in 2005 to help pay down that debt. Three years later, a publicly traded shell company bought the pulp and paper operations and became Boise, Inc., allowing Boise Cascade to pay off most of the remaining debt. The timing was fortuitous when, in 2008, the housing market collapsed and tough times ensued for the entire industry. Tom Carlile assumed the position of CEO in 2009, and began to lead the company through the slow housing recovery with investments in EWP and veneer facilities and the building materials distribution footprint. By late 2012, the company prepared to launch an IPO, which was completed on February 6, 2013 when it rang the bell at the NYSE. Tom Corrick was named CEO in 2015 and retired March 6, 2020. Nate Jorgensen is the current CEO. Operations The company operates through two vertically-integrated divisions: * The Wood Products division manufactures engineered wood products (EWP), plywood and lumber for wholesalers, retail dealers and builders to meet residential and commercial construction needs. The division has manufacturing facilities are located in the Pacific Northwest and southeastern U.S., and one mill in Canada at St. Jacques, New Brunswick. BC owns and operates the world's two largest laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and I-joist manufacturing plants, and is the #2 producer of engineered wood products and #2 producer of plywood in North America. * The Building Materials Distribution division stocks an extensive inventory of structural building products used from the foundation to the roof, including engineered wood, siding, composite decking, metal, insulation and more from over 1,100 third-party suppliers. The division delivers orders by truck and rail to home improvement centers, retail lumber dealers, and industrial customers. There are 35 distribution branches nationwide, making it the largest wholesale building products distributor in the U.S. Environmental stewardship Boise Cascade does not own forest lands, so the company procures all of its timber to operate its mills from with Federal, state, and private landowners. The company's environmental management system controls the procurement of all forest-based fiber for its mills, providing supply chain assurances regarding legality of fiber, exclusion of controversial sources, and compliance with mandatory resource and trade legislation. Boise Cascade has earned certifications through the Sustainable Forestry Initiative¬Æ (SFI¬Æ), the Forest Stewardship Council¬Æ (FSC¬Æ), and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification‚Ñ¢ (PEFC‚Ñ¢). Nearly 100% of the wood brought into its mills is used and almost no waste is landfilled; for example, after making the primary products, the bark and wood residuals can be used to heat dryers, produce particleboard, or sold to make paper. From a greenhouse gas emission perspective, wood is a superior building product as it sequesters carbon in the structure as well as minimizing the use of non- renewable carbon-based fuels. Finally, Boise Cascade's I-joists, which are used in approximately one of every seven houses built in the U.S., use about 50% as much wood fiber as the dimension lumber products they replace. Corporate governance Boise Cascade's executive leadership includes CEO Nate Jorgensen, Wayne Rancourt (CFO, EVP and Treasurer), Mike Brown (EVP, Wood Products) and Nick Stokes (EVP, Building Materials Distribution). Nine additional leaders make up the Boise Cascade Officer team. The company's Board of Directors has 10 members and is currently led by Chairman Tom Carlile, former CEO and CFO of Boise Cascade. After over-extending into non-traditional areas under CEO Hansberger and young the company nearly went into liquidation in 1972. A management team under new CEO Fery got the company back to basics through the rest of After the purchase of OfficeMax in 2003, Boise Cascade separated its distribution and manufacturing businesses the following The pulp and paper assets of Boise Cascade L.L.C. were sold to an investment firm in 2008, then acquired by Packaging Corporation of America in 2013 and became its Boise Paper division.

It differs from the standard sencha (a classic unshaded green tea) in being grown under the shade rather than the full sun. Gyokuro is shaded longer than kabuse tea (lit., \\"covered tea\\"). While gyokuro is shaded for approximately three to four weeks, kabuse-cha is shaded for approximately one week. The name \\"gyokuro\\" translates as \\"jewel dew\\" (or \\"jade dew\\", referring to the pale green colour of the infusion). While most sencha is from the cultivar of Camellia sinensis, gyokuro is often made from a specialized variety such as Asahi, Okumidori, Yamakai, and Saemidori.  Preparation  Gyokuro is normally prepared differently from other green teas. * Use between 1-2 g per 30 ml (or 1 oz) of water. * Use a temperature range of 50 ¬∞C‚Äì60 ¬∞C (122 ¬∞F‚Äì140 ¬∞F) (instead of 65 ¬∞C‚Äì75 ¬∞C (149 ¬∞F‚Äì167 ¬∞F) for sencha). For high-end gyokuro (e.g. National Tea Jury rank), consider a lower temperature, such as 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F). Then for each additional steeping, increase the temperature by 5.5 ¬∞C (10 ¬∞F), until the last steeping, which may be increased by up to 11 ¬∞C (20 ¬∞F). * Steep between 2-3 minutes, then 30-60 seconds for each additional steep. * The larger quantity of tea and lower-temperature allows for approximately 5-6 steepings. = Notes = Since gyokuro is typically steeped at a lower temperature than most other teas, it is common practice to preheat the teaware to ensure a more steady brewing temperature during steeping time and to prolong the warmth of the lower- temperature tea. One standard method is to heat the water at a higher temperature, pour it into and between the various teaware, and finally into the brewing vessel containing the tea leaves. When done properly, by the time the water has transferred between the various teaware and into the brewing vessel it has cooled to appropriate temperature and the teaware has been warmed. One reason for the lower steeping temperature is to preserve the subtle and delicate sweet notes in most gyokuro. One the other hand, it is possible to steep at higher temperatures to bring out more of the vegetable and briny qualities, but usually at risk of homogenizing or removing the sweet notes while increasing bitterness. = Example Steeping = Using a premium Yamecha cv. yabukita gyokuro with 1.1 grams per ounce. 1st Steep: 120 s at 140 ¬∞F. 2nd Steep: 30 s at 150 ¬∞F. 3rd Steep: 30 s at 160 ¬∞F. 4th Steep: 40 s at 170 ¬∞F. 5th Steep: 40 s at 180 ¬∞F. 6th Steep: 40 s at 195 ¬∞F.  Cultivation  Though it is categorized as a type of sencha according to production methods, gyokuro cultivation differs from other sencha teas. Gyokuro tea leaves are shielded from the sun for at least 20 days with straw mats before being harvested. This causes both the amino acid theanine and the alkaloid caffeine in the tea leaves to increase, which yields a sweet flavour. The tea also gains a distinct aroma from the covering process. This type of cultivation is also used in producing but records indicate this process had already been developed in the Azuchi- Momoyama period.  Market  Gyokuro is one of the most expensive types of sencha available in Japan. The name was originally the product name of the tea made by the Yamamotoyama Tea Company (Japanese). The tea was first discovered by Yamamotoyama's sixth owner, Yamamoto Kahei, in 1835 (Tenp≈ç year 6). The process was completed by another manufacturer at the start of the Meiji period. The greatest appellation of gyokuro in terms of both quality and quantity is Yamecha, which is produced in Yame in Fukuoka Prefecture. More than 40% of gyokuro is produced in Yame, and in the national tea jury in August 2007, Yamecha held all the ranking positions from first to 26th as the best gyokuro.Result of 2007 National Tea Jury The Uji district is the oldest gyokuro-producing region in Japan. Gyokuro should not be confused with \\"tamaryokucha\\", a tea produced in the Kyushu region. Tamaryokucha also has a sweet flavour, but its production process differs from that of gyokuro.

Popularized by William J. Bennett's Why We Fight: Moral Clarity and the War on Terrorism, the phrase was first used in its current context during the 1980s, in reference to the politics of Ronald Reagan. The phrase moral clarity encodes a complex political argument that includes all of the following claims: * The War on Terrorism, like some previous wars involving the United States (particularly World War II and the Cold War), is a conflict between good and evil. * Traditional American values like democracy and freedom are universal human rights, worth promoting and defending through military intervention. * Attempts to understand or explain the actions of anti-Western terrorists as justifiable responses to actions of the United States or Israel are a sign of moral weakness at best, and sympathy for the terrorists at worst, and will hamper efforts to defeat them. * Though the actions of the United States and its allies may lead to civilian deaths or other forms of collateral damage, may require the use of means such as torture that would be condemned in other contexts, and may involve temporary alliances with undemocratic regimes, these actions are justified by the greater moral necessity of defeating terrorism and thus promoting American values and ensuring long-term U.S. security. * Opponents of action against terrorists are guilty of promoting moral relativism or moral equivalence, in which the allegedly similar means of both anti-terrorists and terrorists are used to blur the moral differences between good and evil. Opposing views For opponents of the notion of \\"moral clarity\\", dividing the world into good and evil does not lend itself to a workable foreign policy. For example, if Iraq was invaded for reasons of \\"moral clarity\\", it follows that other \\"rogue states\\" (like North Korea) would also be similarly attacked. This apparent contradiction is used to argue that proponents of \\"moral clarity\\" are guilty of hypocrisy or special pleading, and that the slogan moral clarity masks less exalted reasons for military intervention, particularly economic motives. Opponents of the notion of \\"moral clarity\\" also note that organizations such as al Qaida and neo-Nazis also believe that their own point of view is one of \\"moral clarity\\", which justifies them to take whatever action they feel necessary against what they see as the \\"forces of evil\\". Thus, opponents of the notion of \\"moral clarity\\" assert that, but for the accident of their country and culture of birth, the proponents of \\"moral clarity\\" might well be on the opposite side, holding the same views. Proponents of this view argue that understanding the motivations and values of other cultures, rather than labeling them \\"evil\\", is a better first step in eliminating violence. Critics also argue that \\"moral clarity\\" promotes a dangerous view expressed in the famous phrase \\"My country, right or wrong\\". The idea that the United States is always \\"good\\" is actually an argument of moral relativism, they say, since it makes no distinction between right and wrong actions. Furthermore, it is argued that \\"moral clarity\\" is used to discredit those want to hold the United States to a higher moral standard than \\"My country, right or wrong\\", a standard expressed by U.S. Brigadier General Carl Schurz: \\"Our country right or wrong. When right, to be kept right; when wrong, to be put right.\\" See also * American exceptionalism ‚Äì the idea (not traditionally restricted to conservatives) that the United States has special values and a unique role in promoting and defending those values * Useful idiot ‚Äì disparaging term for Americans who purportedly lack \\"moral clarity\\" References Further reading * William J Bennett (2002) Why We Fight: Moral Clarity and the War on Terrorism Regnery Publishing Inc. * Susan Neiman (2008) Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-up Idealists Harcourt Inc.

Inherently controversial While nearly all examples of alleged \\"dual loyalty\\" are considered highly controversial, they point to the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between what constitutes a \\"danger\\" of dual loyalty, a pair of misaligned interests, versus what might be more simply a pair of partially-aligned or even, according to the party being accused, a pair of fully-aligned interests. For example, immigrants who still have feelings of loyalty to their country of origin often insist that their two (or more) loyalties do not conflict. As Stanley A. Renshon at the Center for Immigration Studies noted, =Transnationalist interpretations= Some scholars refer to a growing trend of transnationalism and suggest that as societies become more heterogeneous and multicultural, the term \\"dual loyalty\\" had increasingly become a meaningless bromide. According to the theory of transnationalism, migration and other factors, including improved global communication, produce new forms of identity that transcend traditional notions of physical and cultural space. Nina Glick Schiller, Linda Basch, and Cristina Blanc-Szanton define a process by which immigrants \\"link together\\" their country of origin and their country of settlement. The transnationalist view is that \\"dual loyalty\\" is a potentially-positive expression of multi- culturalism and can contribute to the diversity and strength of civil society. That view is popular in many academic circles, but others are skeptical of the idea. As one paper describes it, Beyond its usage in particular instances, the terms \\"dual loyalty\\" and \\"transnationalism\\" continue to be the subject of much debate. As one academic wrote: Historical examples Other historical examples of actual or perceived \\"dual loyalty\\" include the following: * During World War II, a number of United States citizens of Japanese, German, and Italian ancestry, including some born in the U.S., were confined to internment camps (see Internment of Japanese Americans). * Roman Catholics are subject to the Pope on religious matters. This has often perceived as dual loyalty by powers opposed to the Holy See. ** During the English Reformation, many important English and Scottish Catholics, such as Thomas More, Mary, Queen of Scots and Edmund Campion, were tried and executed for their alleged double loyalty to the Papacy and infidelity to the Crown. ** During John F. Kennedy's campaign for and brief tenure as U.S. President, some opponents questioned whether a Roman Catholic President of the United States had a divided loyalty with respect to the Papacy and Vatican City. ** The Chinese Catholics have been forced by the government of the People's Republic of China to substitute the Roman Catholic Church in China by the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association. * Jews in the Jewish Diaspora have been accused of dual loyalty by the Romans in the 1st century, by the French in the Dreyfus Affair in the late 19th century, in Stalin-era Soviet Union in the 20th century.Leonard P.

Vision corrected to normal acuity using corrective lenses is still considered \\"naked\\". In astronomy, the naked eye may be used to observe celestial events and objects visible without equipment, such as conjunctions, passing comets, meteor showers, and the brightest asteroids, including 4 Vesta. Sky lore and various tests demonstrate an impressive variety of phenomena visible to the unaided eye. Basic properties Some basic properties of the human eye are: *Quick autofocus from distances of 25 cm (young people) to 50 cm (most people 50 years and older) to infinity. *Angular resolution: about 1 arcminute, approximately 0.02¬∞ or 0.0003 radians, which corresponds to 0.3 m at a 1 km distance. *Field of view (FOV): simultaneous visual perception in an area of about 160¬∞ √ó 175¬∞.Wandell, B.

Visual perception allows a person to gain much information about their surroundings: *the distances and 3-dimensional position of things and persons *the vertical (plumb line) and the slope of plain objects *luminosities and colors and their changes by time and direction In astronomy A photographic approximation of a naked eye view of the night sky from a small rural town (top) and a metropolitan area (bottom). Light pollution dramatically reduces the visibility of stars. The visibility of astronomical objects is strongly affected by light pollution. Even a few hundred kilometers away from a metropolitan area where the sky can appear to be very dark, it is still the residual light pollution that sets the limit on the visibility of faint objects. For most people, these are likely to be the best observing conditions within their reach. Under such \\"typical\\" dark sky conditions, the naked eye can see stars with an apparent magnitude up to +6m. Under perfect dark sky conditions where all light pollution is absent, stars as faint as +8m might be visible. The angular resolution of the naked eye is about 1‚Ä≤; however, some people have sharper vision than that. There is anecdotal evidence that people had seen the Galilean moons of Jupiter before telescopes were invented.Zezong, Xi, \\"The Discovery of Jupiter's Satellite Made by Gan De 2000 years Before Galileo\\", Chinese Physics 2 (3) (1982): 664‚Äì67. Uranus and Vesta had most probably been seen but could not be recognized as planets because they appear so faint even at maximum brightness; Uranus' magnitude varies from +5.3m to +5.9m, and Vesta's from +5.2m to +8.5m (so that it is only visible near its opposition dates). Uranus, when discovered in 1781, was the first planet discovered using technology (a telescope) rather than being spotted by the naked eye. Theoretically, in a typical dark sky, the dark adapted human eye would see the about 5,600 stars brighter than +6m while in perfect dark sky conditions about 45,000 stars brighter than +8m might be visible. In practice, the atmospheric extinction and dust reduces this number somewhat. In the center of a city, where the naked-eye limiting magnitude due to extreme amounts of light pollution can be as low as 2m, as few as 50 stars are visible. Colors can be seen but this is limited by the fact that the eye uses rods instead of cones to view fainter stars. The visibility of diffuse objects such as star clusters and galaxies is much more strongly affected by light pollution than is that of planets and stars. Under typical dark conditions only a few such objects are visible. These include the Pleiades, h/œá Persei, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Carina Nebula, the Orion Nebula, Omega Centauri, 47 Tucanae, the Ptolemy Cluster Messier 7 near the tail of Scorpius and the globular cluster M13 in Hercules. The Triangulum Galaxy (M33) is a difficult averted vision object and only visible at all if it is higher than 50¬∞ in the sky. The globular clusters M 3 in Canes Venatici and M 92 in Hercules are also visible with the naked eye under such conditions. Under really dark sky conditions, however, M33 is easy to see, even in direct vision. Many other Messier objects are also visible under such conditions. The most distant objects that have been seen by the naked eye are nearby bright galaxies such as Centaurus A, Bode's Galaxy,SEDS, Messier 81http://messier.obspm.fr/xtra/supp/m81naked.txt Sculptor Galaxy, and Messier 83. Five planets can be recognized as planets from Earth with the naked eye: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. Under typical dark sky conditions Uranus (magnitude +5.8) can be seen as well with averted vision, as can the asteroid Vesta at its brighter oppositions. The Sun and the Moon‚Äîthe remaining noticeable naked-eye objects of the solar system‚Äîare sometimes added to make seven \\"planets.\\" During daylight only the Moon and Sun are obvious naked eye objects, but in many cases Venus can be spotted in daylight and in rarer cases Jupiter. Close to sunset and sunrise, bright stars like Sirius or even Canopus can be spotted with the naked eye as long as one knows the exact position in which to look. Historically, the zenith of naked-eye astronomy was the work of Tycho Brahe (1546‚Äì1601). He built an extensive observatory to make precise measurements of the heavens without any instruments for magnification. In 1610, Galileo Galilei pointed a telescope towards the sky. He immediately discovered the moons of Jupiter and the phases of Venus, among other things. Meteor showers are better observed by naked eye than with binoculars. Such showers include the Perseids (10‚Äì12 August) and the December Geminids. Some 100 satellites per night, the International Space Station and the Milky Way are other popular objects visible to the naked eye. In geodesy and navigation Many other things can be estimated without an instrument. If an arm is stretched the span of the hand corresponds to an angle of 18 to 20¬∞. The distance of a person, just covered up by the outstretched thumbnail, is about 100 meters. The vertical can be estimated to about 2¬∞ and, in the northern hemisphere, observing the Pole Star and using a protractor can give the observer's geographic latitude, up to 1 degree of accuracy. The Babylonians, Mayans, ancient Egyptians, ancient Indians, and Chinese measured all the basics of their respective time and calendar systems by naked eye: *the length of a year and a month to ¬±0.1 hour or to better than 1 minute (0.001%) *the 24 hours of a day, and the equinoxes *the periods of the planets were calculated by Mayan astronomers, to within 5 to 10 minutes accuracy in the case of Venus and Mars. In a similar manner star occultations by the moon can be observed. By using a digital clock an accuracy of 0.2 second is possible. This represents only 200 meters at the moon's distance of 385,000 km. Small objects and maps Observing a nearby small object without a magnifying glass or a microscope, the size of the object depends on the viewing distance. Under normal lighting conditions (light source ~ 1000 lumens at height 600‚Äì700 mm, viewing angle ~ 35 degrees) the angular size recognized by naked eye will be round 1 arc minute = 1/60 degrees = 0.0003 radians. At a viewing distance of 16\\" = ~ 400 mm, which is considered a normal reading distance in the US, the smallest object resolution will be ~ 0.116 mm. For inspection purposes laboratories use a viewing distance of 200‚Äì250 mm, which gives the smallest size of the object recognizable to the naked eye of ~0.058- 0.072 mm (~55-75 micrometers). The accuracy of a measurement ranges from 0.1 to 0.3 mm and depends on the experience of the observer. The latter figure is the usual positional accuracy of faint details in maps and technical plans. Environmental pollution The Milky Way is visible over the Very Large Telescope, demonstrating clear atmosphere above Paranal Observatory. A clean atmosphere is indicated by the fact that the Milky Way is visible. Comparing the zenith with the horizon shows how the \\"blue quality\\" is degraded depending on the amount of air pollution and dust. The twinkling of a star is an indication of the turbulence of the air. This is of importance in meteorology and for the \\"seeing\\" of astronomy. Light pollution is a significant problem for amateur astronomers but becomes less late at night when many lights are shut off. Air dust can be seen even far away from a city by its \\"light dome\\".

Founded in 1938 during the Great Depression as part of the New Deal, the corporation's purpose is to expand the secondary mortgage market by securitizing mortgage loans in the form of mortgage-backed securities (MBS), allowing lenders to reinvest their assets into more lending and in effect increasing the number of lenders in the mortgage market by reducing the reliance on locally based savings and loan associations (or \\"thrifts\\"). Its sister organization is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), better known as Freddie Mac. As of 2018, Fannie Mae is ranked number 21 on the Fortune 500 rankings of the largest United States corporations by total revenue. History A view, from the southwest, of the Federal National Mortgage Association's (Fannie Mae's) Reston, Virginia facility. Historically, most housing loans in the early 1900s in the USA were short term mortgage loans with balloon payments. The Great Depression wrought havoc on the U.S. housing market as people lost their jobs and were unable to make payments. By 1933, an estimated 20 to 25% of the nation's outstanding mortgage debt was in default. This resulted in foreclosures in which nearly 25% of America's homeowners lost their homes to banks. To address this, Fannie Mae was established by the U.S. Congress in 1938 by amendments to the National Housing Act as part of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal. Originally chartered as the National Mortgage Association of Washington, the organization's explicit purpose was to provide local banks with federal money to finance home loans in an attempt to raise levels of home ownership and the availability of affordable housing. Fannie Mae created a liquid secondary mortgage market and thereby made it possible for banks and other loan originators to issue more housing loans, primarily by buying Federal Housing Administration (FHA) insured mortgages. For the first thirty years following its inception, Fannie Mae held a monopoly over the secondary mortgage market. Other considerations may have motivated the New Deal focus on the housing market: about a third of the nation's unemployed were in the building trade, and the government had a vested interest in getting them back to work by giving them homes to build. Fannie Mae was acquired by the Housing and Home Finance Agency from the Federal Loan Agency as a constituent unit in 1950. In 1954, an amendment known as the Federal National Mortgage Association Charter Act made Fannie Mae into \\"mixed-ownership corporation\\", meaning that federal government held the preferred stock while private investors held the common stock; in 1968 it converted to a privately held corporation, to remove its activity and debt from the federal budget.Krishna Guha, Saskia Scholtes, James Politi: Saviours of the suburbs, Financial Times, June 4, 2008, page 13 In the 1968 change, arising from the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, Fannie Mae's predecessor (also called Fannie Mae) was split into the current Fannie Mae and the Government National Mortgage Association (\\"Ginnie Mae\\"). Ginnie Mae, which remained a government organization, guarantees FHA-insured mortgage loans as well as Veterans Administration (VA) and Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) insured mortgages. As such, Ginnie Mae is the only home- loan agency explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. In 1970, the federal government authorized Fannie Mae to purchase conventional loans, i.e. those not insured by the FHA, VA, or FmHA, and created the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), colloquially known as Freddie Mac, to compete with Fannie Mae and thus facilitate a more robust and efficient secondary mortgage market. That same year FNMA went public on New York and Pacific Exchanges.J. Keith Baker (2010). Residential Mortgage Loan Origination 2nd edition. p. 8. In 1981, Fannie Mae issued its first mortgage passthrough and called it a mortgage-backed security. Ginnie Mae had guaranteed the first mortgage passthrough security of an approved lender in 1968 and in 1971 Freddie Mac issued its first mortgage passthrough, called a participation certificate, composed primarily of private mortgage loans. = 1990s = In 1992, President George H.W. Bush signed the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. The Act amended the charter of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to reflect the Democratic Congress' view that the GSEs \\"have an affirmative obligation to facilitate the financing of affordable housing for low- and moderate-income families in a manner consistent with their overall public purposes, while maintaining a strong financial condition and a reasonable economic return\\". For the first time, the GSEs were required to meet \\"affordable housing goals\\" set annually by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and approved by Congress. The initial annual goal for low-income and moderate-income mortgage purchases for each GSE was 30% of the total number of dwelling units financed by mortgage purchases and increased to 55% by 2007. In 1999, Fannie Mae came under pressure from the Clinton administration to expand mortgage loans to low and moderate income borrowers by increasing the ratios of their loan portfolios in distressed inner city areas designated in the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) of 1977. In 1999, The New York Times reported that with the corporation's move towards the subprime market \\"Fannie Mae is taking on significantly more risk, which may not pose any difficulties during flush economic times. But the government- subsidized corporation may run into trouble in an economic downturn, prompting a government rescue similar to that of the savings and loan industry in the 1980s.\\" = 2000s = Franklin Raines earned $90 million in salary and bonuses while he was head of Fannie Mae. In 2000, because of a re-assessment of the housing market by HUD, anti-predatory lending rules were put into place that disallowed risky, high-cost loans from being credited toward affordable housing goals. In 2004, these rules were dropped and high-risk loans were again counted toward affordable housing goals. The intent was that Fannie Mae's enforcement of the underwriting standards they maintained for standard conforming mortgages would also provide safe and stable means of lending to buyers who did not have prime credit. As Daniel Mudd, then president and CEO of Fannie Mae, testified in 2007, instead the agency's underwriting requirements drove business into the arms of the private mortgage industry who marketed aggressive products without regard to future consequences: Alex Berenson of The New York Times reported in 2003 that Fannie Mae's risk was much larger than was commonly believed. Nassim Taleb wrote in The Black Swan: \\"The government-sponsored institution Fannie Mae, when I look at its risks, seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite, vulnerable to the slightest hiccup. But not to worry: their large staff of scientists deem these events 'unlikely'\\". On January 26, 2005, the Federal Housing Enterprise Regulatory Reform Act of 2005 (S.190) was first introduced in the Senate by Sen. Chuck Hagel. The Senate legislation was an effort to reform the existing GSE regulatory structure in light of the recent accounting problems and questionable management actions leading to considerable income restatements by the GSEs. After being reported favorably by the Senate's Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs in July 2005, the bill was never considered by the full Senate for a vote. Sen. John McCain's decision to become a cosponsor of S.190 almost a year later in 2006 was the last action taken regarding Sen. Hagel's bill in spite of developments since clearing the Senate Committee. Sen. McCain pointed out that Fannie Mae's regulator reported that profits were \\"illusions deliberately and systematically created by the company's senior management\\" in his floor statement giving support to S.190. At the same time, the House also introduced similar legislation, the Federal Housing Finance Reform Act of 2005 (H.R. 1461), in the Spring of 2005. The House Financial Services Committee had crafted changes and produced a Committee Report by July 2005 to the legislation. It was passed by the House in October in spite of President Bush's statement of policy opposed to the House version, which stated: \\"The regulatory regime envisioned by H.R. 1461 is considerably weaker than that which governs other large, complex financial institutions.\\" The legislation met with opposition from both Democrats and Republicans at that point and the Senate never took up the House passed version for consideration after that. =The mortgage crisis from late 2007= Following their mission to meet federal Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing goals, GSEs such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks) had striven to improve home ownership of low and middle income families, underserved areas, and generally through special affordable methods such as \\"the ability to obtain a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a low down payment... and the continuous availability of mortgage credit under a wide range of economic conditions\\".HUD 2002 Annual Housing Activities Report Then in 2003‚Äì2004, the subprime mortgage crisis began. The market shifted away from regulated GSEs and radically toward Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) issued by unregulated private-label securitization (PLS) conduits, typically operated by investment banks. As loan originators began to distribute more and more of their loans through private label PLS's, the GSEs lost the ability to monitor and control loan originators. Competition between the GSEs and private securitizers for loans further undermined GSEs' power and strengthened mortgage originators. This contributed to a decline in underwriting standards and was a major cause of the financial crisis. Investment bank securitizers were more willing to securitize risky loans because they generally retained minimal risk. Whereas the GSEs guaranteed the performance of their mortgage- backed securities (MBSs), private securitizers generally did not, and might only retain a thin slice of risk. Often, banks would offload this risk to insurance companies or other counterparties through credit default swaps, making their actual risk exposures extremely difficult for investors and creditors to discern. The shift toward riskier mortgages and private label MBS distribution occurred as financial institutions sought to maintain earnings levels that had been elevated during 2001‚Äì2003 by an unprecedented refinancing boom due to historically low interest rates. Earnings depended on volume, so maintaining elevated earnings levels necessitated expanding the borrower pool using lower underwriting standards and new products that the GSEs would not (initially) securitize. Thus, the shift away from GSE securitization to private-label securitization (PLS) also corresponded with a shift in mortgage product type, from traditional, amortizing, fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to nontraditional, structurally riskier, nonamortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM's), and in the start of a sharp deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards. The growth of PLS, however, forced the GSEs to lower their underwriting standards in an attempt to reclaim lost market share to please their private shareholders. Shareholder pressure pushed the GSEs into competition with PLS for market share, and the GSEs loosened their guarantee business underwriting standards in order to compete. In contrast, the wholly public FHA/Ginnie Mae maintained their underwriting standards and instead ceded market share. The growth of private-label securitization and lack of regulation in this part of the market resulted in the oversupply of underpriced housing finance that led, in 2006, to an increasing number of borrowers, often with poor credit, who were unable to pay their mortgages ‚Äì particularly with adjustable rate mortgage loans (ARM), caused a precipitous increase in home foreclosures. As a result, home prices declined as increasing foreclosures added to the already large inventory of homes and stricter lending standards made it more and more difficult for borrowers to get loans. This depreciation in home prices led to growing losses for the GSEs, which back the majority of US mortgages. In July 2008, the government attempted to ease market fears by reiterating their view that \\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac play a central role in the US housing finance system\\". The US Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve took steps to bolster confidence in the corporations, including granting both corporations access to Federal Reserve low-interest loans (at similar rates as commercial banks) and removing the prohibition on the Treasury Department to purchase the GSEs' stock. Despite these efforts, by August 2008, shares of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had tumbled more than 90% from their one-year prior levels. On October 21, 2010 FHFA estimates revealed that the bailout of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae will likely cost taxpayers $224‚Äì360 billion in total, with over $150 billion already provided. = 2008 ‚Äì crisis and conservatorship = On July 11, 2008, The New York Times reported that U.S. government officials were considering a plan for the U.S. government to take over Fannie Mae and/or Freddie Mac should their financial situations worsen due to the U.S. housing crisis. Fannie Mae and smaller Freddie Mac owned or guaranteed a massive proportion of all home loans in the United States and so were especially hard hit by the slump. The government officials also stated that the government had also considered calling for explicit government guarantee through legislation of $5 trillion on debt owned or guaranteed by the two companies. Fannie stock plunged. Some worried that Fannie lacked capital and might go bankrupt. Others worried about a government seizure. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson as well as the White House went on the air to defend the financial soundness of Fannie Mae, in a last-ditch effort to prevent a total financial panic.On the Brink, Henry Paulson Fannie and Freddie underpinned the whole U.S. mortgage market. As recently as 2008, Fannie Mae and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) had owned or guaranteed about half of the U.S.'s $12 trillion mortgage market. If they were to collapse, mortgages would be harder to obtain and much more expensive. Fannie and Freddie bonds were owned by everyone from the Chinese Government, to money market funds, to the retirement funds of hundreds of millions of people. If they went bankrupt there would be mass upheaval on a global scale.On the Brink, Henry Paulson The Administration PR effort was not enough, by itself, to save the GSEs. Their government directive to purchase bad loans from private banks, in order to prevent these banks from failing, as well as the 20 top banks falsely classifying loans as AAA, caused instability. Paulson's plan was to go in swiftly and seize the two GSEs, rather than provide loans as he did for AIG and the major banks; he told president Bush that \\"the first sound they hear will be their heads hitting the floor\\", in a reference to the French revolution. The major banks have since been sued by the Feds for a sum of $200,000,000, and some of the major banks have already settled. In addition, a lawsuit has been filed against the federal government by the shareholders of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for a) creating an environment by which Fannie and Freddie would be unable to meet their financial obligations b) forcing the executive management to sign over the companies to the conservator by (a), and c) the gross violation of the (fifth amendment) taking clause. On September 7, 2008, James Lockhart, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were being placed into conservatorship of the FHFA. The action was \\"one of the most sweeping government interventions in private financial markets in decades\\". Lockhart also dismissed the firms' chief executive officers and boards of directors, and caused the issuance to the Treasury new senior preferred stock and common stock warrants amounting to 79.9% of each GSE. The value of the common stock and preferred stock to pre- conservatorship holders was greatly diminished by the suspension of future dividends on previously outstanding stock, in the effort to maintain the value of company debt and of mortgage-backed securities. FHFA stated that there are no plans to liquidate the company. The authority of the U.S. Treasury to advance funds for the purpose of stabilizing Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac is limited only by the amount of debt that the entire federal government is permitted by law to commit to. The July 30, 2008 law enabling expanded regulatory authority over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased the national debt ceiling US$800 billion, to a total of US$10.7 Trillion in anticipation of the potential need for the Treasury to have the flexibility to support the federal home loan banks.

Since then the stocks have continued to trade on the Over-the- Counter Bulletin Board. = 2013 ‚Äì $59.39 billion dividend = In May 2013, Fannie Mae announced that it is going to pay a dividend of $59.4 billion to the United States Treasury. = 2014 ‚Äì $134.5 billion dividend paid = * $116 billion received from Treasurybailout scorecard * $134 billion paid to TreasuryForbes Fannie Mae pays Fannie Mae's 2014 financial results enabled it to pay $20.6 billion in dividends to Treasury for the year, resulting in a cumulative total of $134.5 billion in dividends through December 31, 2014 ‚Äì approximately $18 billion more than Fannie Mae received in support. As of March 31, 2015, Fannie Mae expects to have paid a total of $136.4 billion in payments to the Treasury.Bloomberg Payment will exceed bailoutCNN bailout now profitableUsa Today bailouts repaid Business Fannie Mae makes money partly by borrowing at low rates, and then reinvesting its borrowings into whole mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities. It borrows in the debt markets by selling bonds, and provides liquidity to loan originators by purchasing whole loans. It purchases whole loans and then securitizes them for the investment market by creating MBS that are either retained or sold. As a Government Sponsored Enterprise, or GSE, Fannie Mae is compelled by law to provide liquidity to loan originators in all economic conditions. It must legally ignore adverse market conditions which appear to be unprofitable. If there are loans available for purchase that meet its predetermined underwriting standards, it must purchase them if no other buyers are available. Because of the size, scale, and scope of the United States single- family residential and commercial residential markets, market participants viewed Fannie Mae corporate debt as having a very high probability of being repaid. Fannie Mae is able to borrow very inexpensively in the debt markets as a consequence of market perception. There usually exists a large difference between the rate at which it can borrow and the rate at which it can 'lend'. This was called \\"The big, fat gap\\" by Alan Greenspan.All the Devils are Here, Bethany McClean, Joe Nocera, Penguin/Portfolio 2010 By August 2008, Fannie Mae's mortgage portfolio was in excess of $700 billion. Fannie Mae also earns a significant portion of its income from guaranty fees it receives as compensation for assuming the credit risk on mortgage loans underlying its single-family Fannie Mae MBS and on the single-family mortgage loans held in its retained portfolio. Investors, or purchasers of Fannie Mae MBSs, are willing to let Fannie Mae keep this fee in exchange for assuming the credit risk; that is, Fannie Mae's guarantee that the scheduled principal and interest on the underlying loan will be paid even if the borrower defaults. Fannie Mae's charter has historically prevented it from guaranteeing loans with a loan-to-values over 80% without mortgage insurance or a repurchase agreement with the lender; however, in 2006 and 2007 Fannie Mae did purchase subprime and Alt-A loans as investments. =Business mechanism= Fannie Mae is a purchaser of mortgages loans and the mortgages that secure them, which it packages into mortgaged-backed securities (MBS). Fannie Mae buys loans from approved mortgage sellers and securitizes them; it then sells the resultant mortgage-backed security to investors in the secondary mortgage market, along with a guarantee that the stated principal and interest payments will be timely passed through to the investor.. In addition, Fannie MBS, like those of Freddie Mac MBS and Ginnie Mae MBS, are eligible to be traded in the \\"to-be- announced,\\" or \\"TBA\\" market.Lemke, Lins and Picard, Mortgage-Backed Securities, Chapters 2 and 4 (Thomson West, 2013 ed.). By purchasing the mortgages, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide banks and other financial institutions with fresh money to make new loans. This gives the United States housing and credit markets flexibility and liquidity. In order for Fannie Mae to provide its guarantee to mortgage-backed securities it issues, it sets the guidelines for the loans that it will accept for purchase, called \\"conforming\\" loans. Fannie Mae produced an automated underwriting system (AUS) tool called Desktop Underwriter (DU) which lenders can use to automatically determine if a loan is conforming; Fannie Mae followed this program up in 2004 with Custom DU, which allows lenders to set custom underwriting rules to handle nonconforming loans as well.Krovvidy S. (2008). Custom DU: A Web-Based Business User-Driven Automated Underwriting System. AI Magazine. Free-full text (abstract ). The secondary market for nonconforming loans includes jumbo loans, which are loans larger than the maximum that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will purchase. In early 2008, the decision was made to allow TBA (To-be- announced)-eligible mortgage-backed securities to include up to 10% \\"jumbo\\" loans. = Conforming loans = Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a limit on the maximum sized loan they will guarantee. This is known as the \\"conforming loan limit\\". The conforming loan limit for Fannie Mae, along with Freddie Mac, is set by Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the regulator of both GSEs. OFHEO annually sets the limit of the size of a conforming loan based on the October to October changes in mean home price, above which a mortgage is considered a non-conforming jumbo loan. The conforming loan limit is 50 percent higher in Alaska and Hawaii. The GSEs only buy loans that are conforming to repackage into the secondary market, lowering the demand for non-conforming loans. By virtue of the law of supply and demand, then, it is harder for lenders to sell these loans in the secondary market; thus these types of loans tend to cost more to borrowers (typically 1/4 to 1/2 of a percent). Indeed, in 2008, since the demand for bonds not guaranteed by GSEs was almost non-existent, non-conforming loans were priced nearly 1% to 1.5% higher than conforming loans. = Implicit guarantee and government support = Originally, Fannie had an 'explicit guarantee' from the government; if it got in trouble, the government promised to bail it out. This changed in 1968. Ginnie Mae was split off from Fannie. Ginnie retained the explicit guarantee. Fannie, however, became a private corporation, chartered by Congress and with a direct line of credit to the US Treasury. It was its nature as a Government Sponsored Enterprise (GSE) that provided the 'implied guarantee' for their borrowing. The charter also limited their business activity to the mortgage market. In this regard, although they were a private company, they could not operate like a regular private company. Fannie Mae received no direct government funding or backing; Fannie Mae securities carried no actual explicit government guarantee of being repaid. This was clearly stated in the law that authorizes GSEs, on the securities themselves, and in many public communications issued by Fannie Mae. Neither the certificates nor payments of principal and interest on the certificates were explicitly guaranteed by the United States government. The certificates did not legally constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than Fannie Mae. During the sub-prime era, every Fannie Mae prospectus read in bold, all-caps letters: \\"The certificates and payments of principal and interest on the certificates are not guaranteed by the United States, and do not constitute a debt or obligation of the United States or any of its agencies or instrumentalities other than Fannie Mae.\\" (Verbiage changed from all-caps to standard case for readability). However, the implied guarantee, as well as various special treatments given to Fannie by the government, greatly enhanced its success. For example, the implied guarantee allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to save billions in borrowing costs, as their credit rating was very good. Estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Treasury Department put the figure at about $2 billion per year. Vernon L. Smith, recipient of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, has called FHLMC and FNMA \\"implicitly taxpayer-backed agencies\\". The Economist has referred to \\"the implicit government guarantee\\" of FHLMC and FNMA. In testimony before the House and Senate Banking Committee in 2004, Alan Greenspan expressed the belief that Fannie Mae's (weak) financial position was the result of markets believing that the U.S. Government would never allow Fannie Mae (or Freddie Mac) to fail. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were allowed to hold less capital than normal financial institutions: e.g., they were allowed to sell mortgage-backed securities with only half as much capital backing them up as would be required of other financial institutions. Regulations exist through the FDIC Bank Holding Company Act that govern the solvency of financial institutions. The regulations require normal financial institutions to maintain a capital/asset ratio greater than or equal to 3%.Capital Adequacy Guidelines for Bank Holding Companies: Tier 1 Leverage Measure, Appendix D to 12 C.F.R. Part 225, FDIC's Law, Regulations & Related Acts Index The GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are exempt from this capital/asset ratio requirement and can, and often do, maintain a capital/asset ratio less than 3%. The additional leverage allows for greater returns in good times, but put the companies at greater risk in bad times, such as during the subprime mortgage crisis. FNMA is exempt from state and local taxes, except for certain taxes on real estate. In addition, FNMA and FHLMC are exempt from SEC filing requirements; they file SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports, but many other reports, such as certain reports regarding their REMIC mortgage securities, are not filed. Lastly, money market funds have diversification requirements, so that not more than 5% of assets may be from the same issuer. That is, a worst-case default would drop a fund not more than five percent. However, these rules do not apply to Fannie and Freddie. It would not be unusual to find a fund that had the vast majority of its assets in Fannie and Freddie debt. In 1996, the Congressional Budget Office wrote \\"there have been no federal appropriations for cash payments or guarantee subsidies. But in the place of federal funds the government provides considerable unpriced benefits to the enterprises... Government-sponsored enterprises are costly to the government and taxpayers... the benefit is currently worth $6.5 billion annually.\\". =Accounting= FNMA is a financial corporation which uses derivatives to \\"hedge\\" its cash flow. Derivative products it uses include interest rate swaps and options to enter interest rate swaps (\\"pay-fixed swaps\\", \\"receive-fixed swaps\\", \\"basis swaps\\", \\"interest rate caps and swaptions\\", \\"forward starting swaps\\"). Duration gap is a financial and accounting term for the difference between the duration of assets and liabilities, and is typically used by banks, pension funds, or other financial institutions to measure their risk due to changes in the interest rate. \\"The company said that in April its average duration gap widened to plus 3 months in April from zero in March.\\" \\"The Washington-based company aims to keep its duration gap between minus 6 months to plus 6 months. From September 2003 to March, the gap has run between plus to minus one month.\\" Controversies =Accounting controversy= In late 2004, Fannie Mae was under investigation for its accounting practices. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight released a report on September 20, 2004, alleging widespread accounting errors. Fannie Mae was expected to spend more than $1 billion in 2006 alone to complete its internal audit and bring it closer to compliance. The necessary restatement was expected to cost $10.8 billion, but was completed at a total cost of $6.3 billion in restated earnings as listed in Fannie Mae's Annual Report on Form 10-K. Concerns with business and accounting practices at Fannie Mae predate the scandal itself. On June 15, 2000, the House Banking Subcommittee On Capital Markets, Securities And Government-Sponsored Enterprises held hearings on Fannie Mae. On December 18, 2006, U.S. regulators filed 101 civil charges against chief executive Franklin Raines; chief financial officer J. Timothy Howard; and the former controller Leanne G. Spencer. The three were accused of manipulating Fannie Mae earnings to maximize their bonuses. The lawsuit sought to recoup more than $115 million in bonus payments, collectively accrued by the trio from 1998 to 2004, and about $100 million in penalties for their involvement in the accounting scandal. After 8 years of litigation, in 2012, a summary judgment was issued clearing the trio, indicating the government had insufficient evidence that would enable any jury to find the defendants guilty. =Conflict of interest= In June 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported that two former CEOs of Fannie Mae, James A. Johnson and Franklin Raines, had received loans below market rate from Countrywide Financial. Fannie Mae was the biggest buyer of Countrywide's mortgages. The \\"Friends of Angelo\\" VIP Countrywide loan program included many people from Fannie Mae; lawyers, executives, etc.Friends of Angelo program, article Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have given contributions to lawmakers currently sitting on committees that primarily regulate their industry: The House Financial Services Committee; the Senate Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs Committee; or the Senate Finance Committee. The others have seats on the powerful Appropriations or Ways & Means committees, are members of the congressional leadership or have run for president. 2011 SEC charges In December 2011, six Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives, including Daniel Mudd, were charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission with securities fraud. \\"The SEC alleges they 'knew and approved of' misleading statements claiming the companies had minimal exposure to subprime loans at the height of home mortgage bubble.\\" Former Freddie chief financial officer Anthony ‚ÄúBuddy‚Äù Piszel, who in February 2011, was CFO of CoreLogic, \\"had received a notice from the SEC that the agency was considering taking action against him\\". He then resigned from CoreLogic. Piszel was not among the executives charged in December 2011. Piszel had been succeeded at Freddie by David Kellermann. Kellermann committed suicide during his tenure at Freddie. A contemporaneous report on the SEC charges continued: > The SEC said Mudd‚Äôs misconduct included knowingly giving false testimony to > Congress. Mudd said last week that the government approved Fannie Mae‚Äôs > disclosures during his tenure. ‚ÄúNow it appears that the government has > negotiated a deal to hold the government, and government-appointed > executives who have signed the same disclosures since my departure, > blameless ‚Äì so that it can sue individuals it fired years ago,‚Äù he said in a > statement last week. 2011 lawsuits In 2011, the agency had a number of other big banks in the crosshairs as well. JPMorgan (JPM) was one of 18 financial institutions the FHFA sued back in 2011, accusing them of selling to Fannie and Freddie securities that \\"had different and more risky characteristics than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales materials\\". Fannie and Freddie, the government-backed housing finance firms, sustained massive losses on mortgage-backed securities as the housing market imploded, requiring a bailout of over $187 billion. The firms have been controlled by the FHFA since their 2008 rescue. Swiss lender UBS has already reached an $885 million settlement with the FHFA in connection with losses Fannie and Freddie sustained on over $6.4 billion worth of mortgage securities. The agency also settled for undisclosed sums earlier this year with Citigroup (C) and General Electric (GE). The FHFA is reportedly seeking $4 billion from JPMorgan to resolve its claims over $33 billion worth of securities sold to Fannie and Freddie by JPMorgan, Bear Stearns and WaMu. Bank of America (BAC), which acquired Countrywide and Merrill Lynch during the crisis era, could be on the hook for even more. The Charlotte-based firm is facing claims from the FHFA over $57 billion worth of mortgage bonds. In all, the 18 FHFA lawsuits cover more than $200 billion in allegedly misrepresented securities. The question of whether any individual bankers will be held to account is another matter. Thus far, criminal cases related to the packaging and sale of mortgage-backed securities have been conspicuously absent. The proposed JPMorgan settlement covers only civil charges, and would not settle the question of whether any individual executives engaged in wrongdoing. There is an ongoing federal criminal probe based in Sacramento, Calif., the state where Washington Mutual was based. JPMorgan originally sought to be protected from any criminal charges as part of this deal, but that request was rejected by the government.  2013 allegations of kickbacks  On May 29, 2013 the Los Angeles Times reported that a former foreclosure specialist at Fannie Mae has been charged but pleaded ‚Äúnot guilty\\" to accepting a kickback from an Arizona real estate broker in a Santa Ana Federal court. Another lawsuit filed earlier in Orange County Superior Court, this one for wrongful termination, has been filed against Fannie Mae by an employee who claims she was fired when she tried to alert management to kickbacks. The employee claims that she started voicing her suspicions in 2009. Related legislation On May 8, 2013, Representative Scott Garrett introduced the Budget and Accounting Transparency Act of 2014 (H.R. 1872; 113th Congress) into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill, if it were passed, would modify the budgetary treatment of federal credit programs, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill would require that the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees be recognized in the federal budget on a fair-value basis using guidelines set forth by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. The changes made by the bill would mean that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were counted on the budget instead of considered separately and would mean that the debt of those two programs would be included in the national debt. These programs themselves would not be changed, but how they are accounted for in the United States federal budget would be. The goal of the bill is to improve the accuracy of how some programs are accounted for in the federal budget.  2015 ruling  On May 11, 2015 The Wall Street Journal reported that A U.S. District Court judge said Nomura Holdings Inc. was not truthful in describing mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, giving a victory to the companies‚Äô conservator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Judge Denise Cote asked the FHFA to propose updated damages to be paid by Nomura and co-defendant RBS Securities Inc., which underwrote some of the investments. At the outset of the case, the FHFA asked for about $1.1 billion. The order brought to conclusion a rare trial addressing alleged mortgage- related infractions committed during the housing boom. Over the past few years, more than a dozen firms chose to settle similar allegations brought by the FHFA rather than face a court battle. The settlements have brought Fannie and Freddie $18 billion in penalties. In her decision, Judge Cote wrote that Nomura, in offering documents for mortgage-backed securities sold to Fannie and Freddie, didn't accurately describe the loans‚Äô quality. ‚ÄúThe magnitude of falsity, conservatively measured, is enormous,‚Äù she wrote. During the boom, Fannie and Freddie invested billions of dollars in mortgage-backed securities issued by such companies as Nomura. Those investments bolstered profits but, in the bust, contributed to steep losses that ultimately resulted in the companies‚Äô 2008 government takeover. Nomura and RBS were two of 18 financial institutions, including Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., targeted in 2011 by the FHFA, which alleged that the companies lied about the quality of the loans underlying the securities. During the nonjury trial, lawyers for the FHFA said that Nomura and RBS inflated values of homes behind some mortgages and sometimes said a home was owner-occupied when it was not.Light, Joe (May 11, 2015) The Wall Street Journal https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-rules-against-nomura-in-fhfa-suit-over- sales-to-fannie-freddie-1431370471 Leadership = Chief executive officer = * Hugh R.

Haeinsa is most notable for being the home of the Tripitaka Koreana, the whole of the Buddhist Scriptures carved onto 81,350 wooden printing blocks, which it has housed since 1398. Haeinsa is one of the Three Jewels Temples, and represents Dharma or the Buddha‚Äôs teachings. It is still an active Seon (ÏÑ†, Á¶™) practice center in modern times, and was the home temple of the influential Seon master Seongcheol (ÏÑ±Ï≤†, ÊÄßÂæπ), who died in 1993. History The temple was first built in 802. Legend says that two Korean monks Suneung and Ijeong, returned from China and healed Aejang of Silla's wife of her illness. In gratitude for Gautama Buddha's mercy, the king ordered the construction of the temple. Another account, by Choe Chi-Won in 900 states that Suneung and his disciple Ijeong, gained the support of a queen dowager who converted to Buddhism and then helped to finance the construction of the temple. The temple complex was renovated in the 10th century, 1488, 1622, and 1644. Huirang, the temple abbot enjoyed the patronage of Taejo of Goryeo during that king‚Äôs reign. Haeinsa was burned down in a fire in 1817 and was rebuilt in 1818. Another renovation in 1964 uncovered a royal robe of Gwanghaegun of Joseon, who was responsible for the 1622 renovation, and an inscription on a ridge beam. The main hall, Daejeokkwangjeon (ÎåÄÏ†ÅÍ¥ëÏ†Ñ, Â§ßÂØÇÂÖâÊÆø: Hall of Great Silence and Light), is unusual because it is dedicated to Vairocana, whereas most other Korean temples house images of Gautama Buddha in their main halls. The Temple of Haeinsa and the Depositories for the Tripi·π≠aka Koreana Woodblocks were made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1995. The UNESCO committee noted that the buildings housing the Tripi·π≠aka Koreana are unique because no other historical structure was specifically dedicated to the preservation of artifacts and the techniques used were particularly ingenious. The temple also holds several official treasures including a realistic wooden carving of a monk and interesting Buddhist paintings, stone pagodas, and lanterns. =Crisis= A Buddha statue inside the temple's inner grounds After independence, when the Korean War broke out, Haeinsa encountered a crisis. In September 1951, after the Battle of Inchon, South Korea turned the war around but then North Korea did not retreat so the remnants of one thousand North Korean soldiers around Haeinsa engaged in guerrilla warfare. UN forces were ordered to bomb Haeinsa with four bombers. However, at that time Kim Young Hwan, the leader of the Air Force's pilots, worried about the loss of the Haeinsa Tripi·π≠aka Koreana and did not obey the command. Due to his lack of action, Haeinsa weathered the crisis and did not experience the bombing. Haeinsa gongdeokbi honors him with the landscaped grounds of Haeinsa. Janggyeong Panjeon (National Treasure No.32) Tripi·π≠aka Koreana woodblocks at Haeinsa The storage halls known as the Janggyeong Panjeon complex are the depository for the Tripi·π≠aka Koreana woodblocks at Haeinsa and were also designated by the Korean government as a National Treasure on December 20, 1962. They are some of the largest wooden storage facilities in the world. Remarkably, the halls were untouched during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592‚Äì98) and were spared from the 1818 fire that burned most of the temple complex down. All told, the storage halls have survived seven serious fires and one near-bombing during the Korean War when a pilot disobeyed orders because he remembered that the temple held priceless treasures. Janggyeong Panjeon complex is the oldest part of the temple and houses the 81,258 wooden printing blocks from the Tripi·π≠aka Koreana. Although the exact construction date of the hall that houses the Tripi·π≠aka Koreana is uncertain, it is believed that Sejo of Joseon expanded and renovated it in 1457. The complex is made up of four halls arranged in a rectangle and the style is very plain because of its use as a storage facility. The northern hall is called Beopbojeon (Hall of Dharma) and the southern hall is called the Sudara-jang (\\"Hall of Sutras\\"). These two main halls are 60.44 meters in length, 8.73 meters in width, and 7.8 meters in height. Both have fifteen rooms with two adjoining rooms. Additionally, there are two small halls on the east and west which house two small libraries. here for an image of the woodblock print. Rice terraces in farmland surrounding Haeinsa Several ingenious preservation techniques are utilized to preserve the wooden printing blocks. The architects also utilized nature to help preserve the Tripitaka. The storage complex was built at the highest point of the temple and is 655 meters above sea level. Janggyeong Panjeon faces southwest to avoid damp southeasterly winds from the valley below and is blocked from the cold north wind by mountain peaks. Different sized windows on the north and south sides of both main halls are used for ventilation, utilizing principles of hydrodynamics. The windows were installed in every hall to maximize ventilation and regulate temperature. The clay floors were filled with charcoal, calcium oxide, salt, lime, and sand, which reduce humidity when it rains by absorbing excess moisture which is then retained during the dry winter months. The roof is also made with clay and the bracketing and wood rafters prevent sudden changes in temperature. Additionally, no part of the complex is exposed to sun. Apparently, animals, insects, and birds avoid the complex but the reason for this is unknown. These sophisticated preservation measures are widely credited as the reason the woodblocks have survived in such fantastic condition to this day. In 1970, a modern storage complex was built utilizing modern preservation techniques but when test woodblocks were found to have mildewed, the intended move was canceled and the woodblocks remained at Haeinsa.  Tourism  It also offers Temple Stay programs where visitors can experience Buddhist culture.

She also presented the BBC Radio 4 PM programme for ten years as well as a series of radio and television programmes on financial and business issues. Early life Valerie Singleton is the daughter of ex- RAF wing commander Dennis Singleton, later an advertising manager. She was educated at Frensham Heights School in Surrey and at the independent Arts Educational School, Tring Park in Hertfordshire. She wanted to be a dancer and for two years attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She won a scholarship for her first term and began her career as an actress at the New Theatre in Bromley. In 1959, she starred in the BBC television sitcom The Adventures of Brigadier Wellington-Bull. She began presenting on BBC Radio in 1963, hosting On the Sunny Side of the Street for the Light Programme. She was also a reporter on BBC Two's Time Out in 1964. Blue Peter She joined the BBC in 1961 as a continuity announcer and in 1962 joined Blue Peter, where she stayed until 1972. She then continued until 1975 in a part-time role as a 'roving reporter'. During her time on Blue Peter, Singleton accompanied Princess Anne on her first solo trip overseas in a Kenyan Royal Safari in 1971. In 1998, the two women met to reminisce about the Royal safari for one of Blue Peters fortieth anniversary programmes. At Christmas 1971, Singleton and the Blue Peter presenting team hosted the annual Disney Time on BBC One. The documentary on the Royal Safari led to a spin-off series, Blue Peter Special Assignment, in which Singleton was solo presenter. It was shown at weekends and ran from 1973 to 1981. Initially each edition focused on European capital cities, but later covered islands and well-known historic figures. After making the last of her 'in studio' appearances on Blue Peter in October 1975 and being featured as part of the end-of-year 'review', she returned in January 1976 to mark the death of the first Blue Peter cat, Jason. Just a few weeks later, producer Edward Barnes wrote to tell her that as she was no longer associated with the show in any genuine sense, they were replacing her as the presenter of the Special Assignment series. Her fees were reportedly a factor in their decision. However, the programme continued to repeat items featuring Singleton for many years and she returned for a final series of the Special Assignment spin-off in 1981 reporting on the Yukon and Niagara Rivers. For both the 20th and 25th Anniversary editions of Blue Peter in 1978 and 1983 respectively, Singleton moderated the live link-ups from around the UK to launch the anniversary badge balloon hunts, thus extending her presenting tenure to 21 years. As a guest, she presented the \\"Outstanding Endeavour\\" award to its young recipient on the programme's 30th anniversary edition. Richard Marson states in his Blue Peter 50th Anniversary book that \\"Singleton never really left Blue Peter\\". During her time on Blue Peter, Singleton presented another BBC children's show, Val Meets The VIPs, a chat show which ran for three series during 1973‚Äì74. Each edition featured an interview with a single public figure to which an audience of children were invited to put across their questions. A guest in March 1973 was the then Secretary of State for Education, Margaret Thatcher, who when asked if she would like to be Prime Minister said that she did not have enough experience, nor would there be a \\"woman Prime Minister in my lifetime\\". Later work Plaque commemorating Singleton's opening of Priory Country Park Having co-hosted a special programme about Metrication in July 1973, She joined Nationwide in October 1973 as the show's \\"Consumer Unit\\" presenter with Richard Stilgoe, later becoming one of the main hosts of the show. Singleton was the co-anchor of Nationwides royal wedding coverage in November 1973. She left Nationwide in 1978 to present the BBC's late-night news programme Tonight, replacing Sue Lawley. In 1980, she was the presenter of BBC Two's series A Kind Of Childhood. She made a brief return to Nationwide in the summer of 1983, presenting a series of films looking at people forced to leave their homeland and settle in Britain. Singleton hosted many other programmes, notably undertaking a ten-year stint on the Monday-to-Friday BBC Radio 4 PM programme beginning in 1982 (having previously presented the station's Midweek with Valerie Singleton) and eight years presenting BBC Two's The Money Programme from September 1980 to March 1988. While hosting PM, Singleton admitted she had a difficult relationship with co-presenter Hugh Sykes and threw a cup of water in his face while live on air. For the 1983 UK General Election, Singleton covered the results from two constituencies, Torbay and Truro, interviewing the winning candidates after the results for the BBC's Election results programming. When she quit PM in 1993, she presented a travel programme for ITV and became a regular travel writer for several national publications. She made a one-off return to PM on 29 February 2016 to co- present a special 'Leap Day' programme, alongside Eddie Mair.Valerie Singleton's wedding proposal to Eddie, BBC Radio 4, 29 February 2016.Val Singleton returns to the PM Programme on Radio 4, Radio Moments, 1 March 2016. In 1994, she was awarded the OBE for her services to children's television. In the 1990s she presented a popular quiz on Channel 4 ‚Äì Backdate. She was an early enthusiast for and patron of the painter Jack Vettriano. In 2005, the story of Singleton's move from London to Dorset and the sale of the flat she had lived in for more than forty years was reported in The Times. According to the Metro newspaper in 2007, Singleton intended to publish her biography in time for Blue Peters fiftieth anniversary in October 2008. According to the article, the book would reveal \\"a few things that will shock\\". The book is yet to be published. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 2001 when she was surprised by Michael Aspel. Earlier, in 1974, she had been the featured castaway on Desert Island Discs.

Company logo The company's logo was designed by American graphic designers Lester Beall and Richard Rogers in 1960. The logo features the letters \\"I\\" and \\"P\\" which form a stylized arrow also resembling a tree surrounded by a circle. A primary constraint in the design process was the need for a logo simple enough that it could be stenciled onto trees and lumber intended for paper production. Headquarters International Paper owns Tower I (at 6400 Poplar) and occupies the entire property and leases 50,000 square feet in Tower II (at 6410 Poplar) and all of Tower III (at 6420 Poplar). In 2000, International Place Tower III was designed and rests amid the two existing towers and courtyard. The Crump Firm designed the eleven-story, 234,000 square foot tower to include offices, conference rooms, training rooms and dining facilities. The exterior granite was bought and warehoused in the mid-1980s with the intent that its construction would mimic that of the earlier towers. However, inclusion of seismic criteria to the Memphis building code in 1994 made the initial design unable to move forward. Therefore, architects had to completely change the original structural design in order to adhere to the strict exterior dimensions needed to utilize the existing granite and to match the existing towers. In 2012, it was announced that International Papers was building a $90.2 million, 235,000-square-foot tower at 6430 Poplar Ave. in East Memphis. In addition to the four office towers at International Place, the company operates an airport hangar facility (at 2522 Winchester Road) and a Southwind data center at (3232 Players Club Parkway).

Georgia-Pacific was founded by Owen Robertson Cheatham in 1927 in Augusta, Georgia, as the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Co. Over the years it expanded, adding sawmills and plywood plants. The company acquired its first West Coast facility in 1947 and changed its name to Georgia-Pacific Plywood & Lumber Company in 1948. In 1956, the company changed its name to Georgia- Pacific Corporation. In 1957 the company entered the pulp and paper business by building a kraft pulp and linerboard mill at Toledo, Oregon. The company continued to make a series of acquisitions, including US Plywood in 1987, Great Northern Nekoosa in 1990, and the Fort James Corporation in 2000. The Fort James Corporation was the result of a series of mergers of enterprises that included the Fort Howard Corporation, the James River Corporation and Crown-Zellerbach. In August 2001, Georgia-Pacific completed the sale of four un-coated paper mills and their associated businesses and assets to Canadian papermaker Domtar for . It was announced on November 13, 2005 that Georgia- Pacific would be acquired by Koch Industries.Koch Industries newsroom On December 23, 2005, Koch Industries finalized the $21 billion acquisition of Georgia-Pacific. Georgia-Pacific was removed from the NYSE (it had traded under the symbol GP) and shareholders surrendered their shares for about $48 per share. Koch initially were only interested in the GP Building Products Business but GP CEO & President, Pete Correll refused to break up the company. Koch soon realized that they struck gold with the very lucrative NA Consumer Products Business. Koch Industries then spent the next 6 years focused on offloading the European business which was eventually made possible by a huge business turn around of the UK business. Koch sold to the European business in 2013 to SCA (now Essity) however with a proviso from The European Competition Commission that the UK & Ireland Consumer Products business had to be separated and sold off.

Environmental record Green Bay, Wisconsin, was formerly owned and operated by Fort Howard. Diboll, south of Lufkin, Texas Stephen Engelberg of The New York Times wrote that in 1995, Georgia-Pacific persuaded the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee to approve an amendment that derailed a pending E.P.A. investigation of Weyerhauser Company, Louisiana-Pacific Corporation, and Georgia-Pacific, arguing that the E.P.A. was \\"unfairly applying present-day standards to decisions made 10 to 15 years ago\\", and that the E.P.A. test method overstated the emissions from wood products factories. Georgia- Pacific's opponents believed \\"the measure could allow Georgia-Pacific avoid installing pollution gear at many of its plants.\\" Engelberg wrote, \\"Nonetheless, [Georgia-Pacific] said they would install controls at plants that need them.\\" Georgia-Pacific is also involved in several remediation sites, many of which were landfills used by other manufacturers, municipalities and other businesses, and individuals. Two of the primary remediation sites - the Fox River in Wisconsin and Kalamazoo River in Michigan - involve the cleanup of PCBs. Georgia Pacific is contributing to dam removal work as part of an effort to clean up PCB contamination in Kalamazoo.Georgia- Pacific pitches $80-$90 million plan to remove Otsego-area dams as part of Kalamazoo River cleanup August 23, 2012 Kalamazoo News Each year the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires Georgia-Pacific, as it does all large manufacturers, to report publicly quantities of certain chemicals that facilities release into the air, water, and onto land. For the 2006 period (as of Spring 2008) ‚Äì the company showed a 12 percent decrease in these releases from 2005. Between 2000 and 2006, Georgia-Pacific reduced its total releases and transfers of these specified compounds by 26 percent. Georgia-Pacific publicly reports on its environmental performance through its Environmental and Social Responsibility report, which is available on its web site. In 2007, the EPA announced legal agreements among itself, Michigan, Georgia-Pacific, and Millennium Holdings (a corporate successor of the Allied Paper Corporation) requiring the companies to clean up an estimated $21,000,000 worth of environmental damage to the Plainwell Impoundment Area. Another settlement required an additional $15,000,000 of environmental work on the Kalamazoo River Superfund Site. Georgia-Pacific is the largest user of de-ink fiber in the world, and its subsidiary company GP Harmon trades in the recycled material. The company has expanded into other markets in countries like Mexico and China. In 2005, president of the division Simon Davies estimated that China would require the import of scrap paper from the US and elsewhere for at least 15 years. In the long run, he asserted, the growth of the Chinese middle class would be correlated with a large increase in paper production, and having viable paper recovery systems in place would be of great value to them. The Georgia-Pacific Paper Mill in Crossett, Arkansas was the subject of environmental documentary film Company Town, released in 2016. The film alleges that improper waste disposal by the mill has caused a cluster of cancer incidents in the area around the mill. Awards and charity In 2009, the EPA awarded Koch subsidiary Georgia-Pacific its SmartWay Excellence award, \\"an innovative collaboration between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the freight industry designed to increase energy efficiency while significantly reducing air pollution,\\" and specifically commended Georgia-Pacific.

The town lies between Codette Lake, created by the Francois-Finlay Dam (built in 1986) and Tobin Lake, created by the E.B. Campbell Dam built in 1963, renamed from Squaw Rapids. The construction of Francois-Finlay Dam earned Nipawin the nickname, The Town of Two Lakes. Nipawin is bordered by the Rural Municipality of Nipawin No. 487 and the Rural Municipality of Torch River No. 488 (the latter across the Saskatchewan River). Highway 35 and Highway 55 intersect in Nipawin. The Nipawin Airport and the Nipawin Water Aerodrome also serve the community. Nipawin is a Cree word meaning \\"a bed, or resting place\\" which referred to a low-lying area along the river now flooded by Codette Lake where First Nations women and children would camp and wait for the men to arrive. History Francois Finlay dam and SaskPower Nipawin Hydroelectric Station The first permanent settlement of Nipawin occurred in 1910 with the establishment of a trading post. In 1924 the Canadian Pacific Railway passed nearby over the Crooked Bridge, and the settlement was moved, building by building, to its current location to be closer to the railway. =Fur trade= There were a number of fur trading posts in the area, but they are poorly documented.Arthur Morton,\\"A History of Western Canada\\",circa 1936 In 1763 Joseph Smith reached the area from York Factory. In 1768 James Finlay from Montreal built a post. Fran√ßois le Blanc, apparently the man known as \\"Saswe\\", had a post by that year or the next. In 1790 William Thorburn built here and next year moved to Hungry Hall. In 1795 there were two posts, one run by A. N McLeod for the North West Company and another run by James Porter working for David Grant. =Recent history= On April 18, 2008, a downtown meat shop exploded, destroying three buildings as well as damaging several more. The explosion killed two and injured five. The explosion is suspected to have been caused by a backhoe that snagged and sheared a natural gas riser from the main line. The explosion prompted the implementation of a state of emergency by the mayor. The explosion received extensive national news coverage. Demographics While English is spoken by all residents, over 10% of the population also speak a second language with Cree, German, Ukrainian, French, Tagalog, Spanish, Afrikaans, Dutch, Chinese, Korean, Inuktitut, English, Albanian, Bantu languages, Bosnian, Greek, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian and Mandarin represented. The Nipawin Population Centre, the 19th largest in Saskatchewan, had a population of 3,989 in 2016. Climate Nipawin Experiences a Humid continental climate (Koppen: Dfb) bordering on a subarctic climate (Dfc), with long, extremely cold winters and short, warm summers. The highest temperature ever recorded in Nipawin was on 19 July 1941. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 8 January 1930. Economy Nipawin is near the Fort √† la Corne Provincial Forest, location of the world's largest diamond bearing kimberlites and intensive diamond exploration activity. Other industries in the area include: agriculture, tourism, canola oil processing, honey production, candle manufacturing, forestry, and commercialization of second- generation biofuels. Attractions This resort community has become a destination for fishing, camping, boating, golfing, hunting and outdoor recreation. *Nipawin hosts several annual fishing events, including, the Great Northern Pike Festival, a summer-long event offering prizes for catching tagged fish. Other annual fishing events are the Codette Walleye tournament, Ladies Fish for Freedom tournament, Premier's Walleye Cup tournament, and the Vanity Cup Walleye tournament running the last weekend in September and the first week in October. *The name Nipawin was also given to Nipawin Regional Park, a large recreational area a few kilometres northwest of the town. *Nipawin is also home to a beautifully landscaped 18-hole golf course.

It has a poseable PVC skeleton with steel joints and silicone flesh. Details and history The RealDolls are designed to recreate the appearance, texture, and weight of the human female and male bodies. Their primary function is to serve as sex partners. This activity can be accompanied by certain preparations such as dressing them up in different types of clothes, changing wigs or makeup, and even adjusting body temperature by use of electric blankets or baths. Early prototypes were made from solid latex with an interior skeleton, but construction of the outer material was later switched to silicone. In June 2009, Abyss Creations switched from tin cure silicone to platinum silicone, which resulted in dolls that are less prone to tears and compression marks than older RealDolls. The current incarnation of the female Real Doll product was introduced in 1996. In 2003, Abyss introduced the \\"Face-X\\" system, allowing any face to be interchangeable with any body. Multiple faces can then be attached once at a time to a single doll by the owner. As of 2011, there are nine female bodies and 16 female faces in the first product line. In 2009 the RealDoll 2 was introduced, which feature removable inserts for the mouth and vagina and faces that attach by magnets instead of Velcro. The line started with two female bodies and three female faces and as of 2013 offers ten faces and three bodies of females. Another female body is in development phase. Charlie, the first male Real Doll, was retired in 2008 and replaced with two body types and three head types. Transgender dolls may also be purchased from the company, although these must be custom ordered. Abyss also sells silicone toys such as female torso products and dildos among other offerings. For a time, the company also offered customizations such as robotic hip actuators, finger skeletons (instead of the usual wire finger armatures) and computer-controlled speech feedback, but these expensive options are no longer available.

The term was first used in 1991 by technology critic and writer Howard Rheingold in his book Virtual Reality. In the publication, Rhinegold made futiritistc conclusions and summaries surrounding technology and used the term 'teledildonics' to refer to remote sexual activity using technology. Nowadays, the term is commonly used to describe remote sex or, at least, remote mutual masturbation), where tactile sensations are communicated over a remote cloud between the participants. The term can also refer to the integration of telepresence with sexual activity that these interfaces make possible and can be used in conjunction or interchangeably with sex-technology. The term has also been used less accurately (since there's no \\"tele-\\" element) to refer to robotic sex, i.e., computer-controlled sex toys that aim to substitute for or improve upon sex with a human partner.Stein, Joel \\"Will cybersex be better than real sex?\\" Time magazine, June 19, 2000. Retrieved July 23, 2008 Nowadays, it is commonly used to refer to Bluetooth enabled sex toys. Background Teledildonics is commonly used to describe Bluetooth enabled sex toys, many of which have entered the market in the last decade. As well as being open to a remote connection for control, some toys can also be connected with corresponding devices to deliver synchronized movements between couples and remote partners. Teledildonics have also been used within the adult industry to create 'immersive' webcam shows, whereby users control the vibrations of the webcammers Bluetooth-enabled sex toy. Some media outlets have reported on 'teldildonic' technology used by long-distance couples in order to maintain sexual relations. As well as offering remote functions, many teledildonic or Bluetooth-enabled toys can be synchronized with pornography movies. Synchronization of porn with teledildonic or Bluetooth toys actions are controlled by means of a previously-written script. A report in 2008 suggested that teledildonics, along with text and email and webcams, can be used to \\"wind each other up to fever pitch during the working day\\" as a prelude to sex with a human during the evening hours. New technologies can help people establish \\"emotional connections\\" via the web. Indeed, teledildonics technology has already been integrated with adult online webcam services and certain sex toys, such as OhMiBod, Lovense and We-Vibe. One Dutch manufacturer, KIIROO, offers a two-way connection between both female and male sex toys. Sex robots and sex-technology have both attracted the same platforms from which debate and interest has taken hold. The development of sex robots has been entwined with advancements in wider examples of sex-technology in society. For example, in 2015, the world's largest retailer of sex robots and creator of Harmony the sex robot, announced their intentions to combine the sex robot experience with virtual reality. Whilst the venture has not yet come into fruition, there have been other considerations surrounding sex robots and sex-technology and commentators on sex robots have spoken about the emergence of sex-tech in society. In 2019, Dr. Kate Devlin, a British computer scientist and philosopher wrote Turned On, a book that focused on the evolution of sex robots in society. In the book, Devlin argues that sex robots are an \\"extension\\" of sex-technology. Another commentator of sex robots, David Levy, who wrote Love and Sex with Robots, spoke about sex-technology in The Guardian in 2008. He suggested that teledildonics was \\"but one stage in a technological and social revolution\\" in which robots will play an increasingly important role, with artificial lifeforms that will \\"attend to our needs with magic fingers\\"; Levy argued that by 2050 \\"sex with robots will be commonplace.\\" History  The idea of virtual sex has been prominent in literature, fiction and popular culture. Promoters of these devices have claimed since the 1980s they are the \\"next big thing\\" in cybersex technology.Grossman, Anna Jane \\"Single, white with dildo.\\" Salon, July 23, 2008. Retrieved July 23, 2008 At the time Howard Rhinegold coined the term teledildonics in 1990, there were already many enthusiasts seeking to explore the power of technology, sex and intimacy. A report in the Chicago Tribune in 1993 suggested that teledildonics was \\"the virtual-reality technology that may one day allow people wearing special bodysuits, headgear and gloves to engage in tactile sexual relations from separate, remote locations via computers connected to phone lines.\\" It was the same year that the Cyber-SM suit was released by Stahl Stensile, which featured on the cover of FutureSex publication, a 1990's San-Fransisco based magazine that focused on the emergence of teledidlonics. Some products have been shown at the Museum of Sex in New York City and there was an exhibition about Stensile's Cyber-SM suit in 2016. The responses to teledildonics have been mixed; however, the dominant concern has centered on the separation of personal intimacy and embodied presence. In the words of one early text on the subject:  Controversy  At the 2016 South by Southwest Festival virtual reality entrepreneur Ela Darling asserted that patent holders were preventing the production of teledildonic technology. Many companies experimenting in the field have been hit with patent lawsuits relating to US patent 6,368,268. It was a patent that was tarnised with \\"stifling innovation\\" by blocking companies from using Bluetooth-enabled sex toys without a law suit. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has named one such patent the \\"stupid patent of the month\\". That patent expired in August 2018, lowering the barrier of entry to the field.

Death is considered to be among the most influential bands in heavy metal and a pioneering force in the extreme metal subgenre of death metal. Their debut album, Scream Bloody Gore, has been widely regarded as the first death metal record (although there is some dispute to that claim as Possessed's debut album Seven Churches and Necrophagia's debut album Season of the Dead were released before). Death had a revolving lineup, with Schuldiner being the sole consistent member. The group's style also progressed, from the raw sound on its first two albums to a more sophisticated one in its later stage. The band ceased to exist after Schuldiner died of glioma and pneumonia in December 2001, but remains an enduring influence on heavy metal. Biography =Early history (1984‚Äì1987)= Chuck Schuldiner, founder of Death, in 1992. Founded in 1984 by Chuck Schuldiner under the original name of Mantas in Altamonte Springs, Florida, Death was among the more widely known early pioneers of the death metal sound, along with California's Possessed. In the late 80s, the band was both a part of and integral in defining the death metal scene which gained international recognition with the release of albums by a number of area acts. Together with Kam Lee, and Rick Rozz, Schuldiner started to compose songs that were released on several rehearsal tapes in 1984. These tapes, along with the Death by Metal demo, circulated through the tape-trader world, quickly establishing the band's name. In 1984, Schuldiner dissolved Mantas and quickly started a new band under the name Death. Tim Aymar, in an article written in December 2010, states that Chuck Schuldiner renamed the band Death in order to turn his experience of the death of his brother Frank years earlier into \\"something positive\\". Its members again included Rick Rozz and Kam Lee. Another demo was released, called Reign of Terror. In 1985, the Infernal Death tape was recorded and released. Rick Rozz was out of the band by early 1985. Kam Lee played with Scott Carlson and Matt Olivo, bassist and guitarist respectively, of the band Genocide (later to be renamed Repulsion) for a short time. However, Kam had some \\"personal problems\\" that caused him to be ejected from the band. Olivo and Carlson left soon afterward. Schuldiner moved to the San Francisco Bay Area and recruited Dirty Rotten Imbeciles drummer Eric Brecht, then recorded the Back from the Dead demo. However, Chuck was not happy with this incarnation of Death and moved back to Florida without a band. In 1986, Schuldiner got an invitation from early Canadian thrash metal band Slaughter to play on their album, which he accepted, moving to Canada. However, this only lasted two weeks, and he returned to the States. He returned to Florida, then moved back to the San Francisco Bay Area again, where he joined with 17-year-old drummer Chris Reifert. They recorded the Mutilation demo, which led to a deal with Combat Records, owned by Important Distribution (later becoming Relativity, and subsequently Sony), that enabled them to record the first LP. Scream Bloody Gore was released in 1987, widely considered a genre template for death metal. The band briefly had a second guitar player, John Hand, but he did not appear on the album (though his photo did). By this time Schuldiner had moved back to Florida, splitting with Reifert who had chosen to remain in California, where he went on to form Autopsy. There, Schuldiner teamed up with former bandmate Rick Rozz and two members of Rozz's band Massacre, Terry Butler and Bill Andrews. =Mid-era (1988‚Äì1992)= In 1988, that line-up recorded Leprosy. After much touring in support of the album, including a quick and ill-planned tour of Europe, Rick Rozz was fired in 1989. After a tour of Mexico featuring guitarist Paul Masvidal (later to re-emerge in the Death camp), a replacement was found in James Murphy, with whom the third album Spiritual Healing was recorded in Tampa in the summer of 1989. Murphy left the band relatively quickly. By this time Schuldiner abandoned the \\"gore\\" lyrical theme for more social critique and melody was added to the band's sound. In 1990, on the eve of a European tour, Schuldiner decided against traveling, claiming at the last minute that he felt the tour was not adequately organized (and citing the group's previous disorganized European tour in 1988). Andrews and Butler continued with the tour of Europe as 'Death' to fulfill the band's contractual obligations, and recruited roadies Walter Trachsler (guitar) and Louie Carrisalez (vocals) to replace Schuldiner, much to Schuldiner's shock and disgust. Schuldiner took legal action and Butler and Andrews were fired from the band. Schuldiner abandoned the idea of a band set-up altogether and began working with session musicians only. Schuldiner hired Steve Di Giorgio and recruited Sean Reinert and Paul Masvidal from underground Florida band Cynic. In 1991, Death released Human, which is considered a more technical and progressive album than their previous works, incorporating complex rhythms, riffs and song structures. Human was Death's best-selling album yet, receiving many accolades and some MTV play for the group's first video, directed by David Bellino, for the track \\"Lack of Comprehension\\". Due to obligations with his primary band Sadus, Di Giorgio was forced to depart after the recording of Human and new bassist Skott Carino did Death's extensive world tour, from October 1991 until March 1992, in addition to appearing in the music video for \\"Lack of Comprehension\\". Schuldiner fired his manager Eric Greif after Spiritual Healing but settled and re-hired him before the recording of Human. Although there were at least two lawsuits between Greif and Schuldiner, Schuldiner was characteristically mellow in an interview with Thrash 'n Burn about what the writer referred to as his \\"gruesome collaboration\\" with Greif: \\"We just came to the conclusion that it was stupid just fighting all the time, taking each other to court and all that stupid shit.\\" \\"Fate has an interesting way of working these things out ... Yes, we had a falling out, but we're working together again and it takes a lot of worries off my mind knowing Eric is the man for us\\", Schuldiner told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. =The final years and Schuldiner's death (1993‚Äì2001)= In 1993, Reinert and Masvidal left the group to continue with the band Cynic, as they were working on a full-length album at the time. Schuldiner, unable to persuade them otherwise, replaced them with drummer Gene Hoglan of the recently dissolved thrash metal band Dark Angel, and guitarist Andy LaRocque from King Diamond for Individual Thought Patterns. Since LaRocque was obligated to his band, Schuldiner hired a then-unknown Ralph Santolla as touring guitarist. Death was arguably at the peak of their commercial and popular culture success, and the video for the track \\"The Philosopher\\" even made it on to an episode of Beavis & Butt-head in 1994 (Beavis also parodies Schuldiner's vocals in a mock 'drive-thru' order of 'tacos, to go!' in death-metal style). Also in 1994, Death abandoned its eight-year relationship with Relativity and signed with Roadrunner Records, their European distributor. For 1995's Symbolic, Santolla and Di Giorgio were exchanged for underground Florida musicians Kelly Conlon and Bobby Koelble. For the Symbolic tour Brian Benson was brought in on bass (Conlon having left the band prior to the tour). After Symbolic, Schuldiner broke up Death after tension with Roadrunner Records. Schuldiner focused on Control Denied following the break up of Death. The seventh Death release, titled The Sound of Perseverance, included Florida musicians Richard Christy, Shannon Hamm and Scott Clendenin, and the album was completed at Morrisound Recording in Tampa and released on Nuclear Blast in 1998. After the album and two supporting tours, Schuldiner put Death aside to pursue Control Denied with Christy and Hamm. Clendenin was dropped in favor of Steve Di Giorgio, who was once again available, and an underground power metal singer named Tim Aymar. Although the line-up and writing style was largely the same, Schuldiner created Control Denied in large part because he was displeased with the harsher vocals for Death. However, rather than betray what the band Death meant and sounded like to the fans, he opted to create a new band: \\"For me, it is just a matter of evolving, doing it the right way. I didn't put out a Death record with this stuff on it. I made the right choice and changed the name of the band. I tried to do everything the right way.\\" As Schuldiner finished Control Denied's debut album, he was diagnosed with brain cancer, forcing the band to scrap plans for a U.S. and Canadian tour. As he worked on the second release, Schuldiner's condition improved, but the tumor left him in a weakened, vulnerable state. He contracted pneumonia and was placed in a hospital. On December 13, 2001, Schuldiner was released and returned home an hour later, where he died. =The aftermath (2001‚Äìonwards)= The second Control Denied release was not completed. Mired in legal problems involving its Dutch label, the musicians and Schuldiner's sister Beth, the former of whom have publicly stated their desire to complete the album, and former manager Eric Greif representing the Estate. In 2004, Hammerheart Records released a two-part bootleg made up of old, pre-Scream Bloody Gore demos, along with partial demos of the unfinished album and live Death recordings from 1990. This was issued under the name Chuck Schuldiner, not Death or Control Denied, but its markedly unfinished state and lack of vocals led to the release not being successful, aided by Schuldiner's mother Jane's pleas for fans to stay away from it. In October 2009, Greif litigated against Hammerheart, representing Schuldiner's estate, and all matters were settled by December, theoretically allowing for the Control Denied album to be completed by the other musicians. Members of Death have since stayed active as musicians. Gene Hoglan from Dark Angel and Andy LaRocque from King Diamond had already made a name for themselves, with LaRocque continuing to work with King Diamond while Hoglan has done stints with a wide variety of bands including Strapping Young Lad, Old Man's Child, Opeth, Zimmers Hole, Unearth, Pitch Black Forecast, Dethklok, Fear Factory, and most recently, Testament. Paul Masvidal found success with Cynic alongside fellow Death member Sean Reinert, who continue to release albums and tour in the present. Richard Christy went on to gigs with Acheron and Iced Earth before joining The Howard Stern Show, though he has recently resurfaced on the metal scene with Charred Walls of the Damned and guesting on a Crotchduster album. Ralph Santolla has also played with Iced Earth, as well as Sebastian Bach; both are bands which Steve DiGiorgio played in as well. Santolla was in Obituary and he was previously in Deicide. Di Giorgio also played for Testament and is still active with his original band Sadus. Bobby Koelble founded the Orlando rock-funk-Latin fusion group JunkieRush in 2000. He joined the Jazz faculty of the University of Central Florida (UCF) in 2007, and performs and records with The Jazz Professors. James Murphy was also in Testament, formed projects such as Disincarnate, as well as having stints with death metal bands Obituary and Cancer. Murphy was also stricken with a noncancerous brain tumor, for which he received treatment, and, along with Deron Miller of CKY, attempted to organize a Death tribute album. Kam Lee became well known as the frontman and face of the band Massacre, and formed the band Denial Fiend with Terry Butler, who has also found success in Six Feet Under and is currently in Obituary. Lee also continues to perform and record today with numerous underground projects, including Bone Gnawer and The Grotesquery. Scott Clendenin died on March 24, 2015 at the age of 48. On May 12, 2010, it was announced that Perseverance Holdings Ltd. had partnered with Relapse Records to re-master and re-issue the Death and Control Denied releases, as well as his earlier work in Mantas. On December 13 of the same year, it was announced that The Sound of Perseverance would be the first Death album to receive this treatment, and was released February 2011 in a 2-CD and 3-CD format. The Human album has been remixed, with Schuldiner's intellectual property lawyer Eric Greif stating that Sony had lost the tapes of the original mixes, and was reissued in 2-CD and 3-CD formats as well as a digital release. Shortly after, the Individual Thought Patterns album was reissued. In February 2012, Relapse Records released a 2 CD live album entitled Vivus! that included the previously released 1998 concerts Live in L.A. and Live in Eindhoven, including liner notes by drummer Christy and manager/lawyer Greif. The Relapse deal does not include Death's acclaimed 1995 album Symbolic, whose rights are still retained by Roadrunner Records . On March 16, 2012, it was announced by Sick Drummer Magazine and the Schuldiner's corporation, Perseverance Holdings Ltd, that musicians who previously played in Death would take part in a benefit tour titled \\"Death to All\\" for the Sweet Relief Musicians Fund. The former Death members slated to participate were drummers Gene Hoglan and Sean Reinert, bassists Steve Di Giorgio and Scott Clendenin, guitarists Paul Masvidal, Shannon Hamm and Bobby Koelble. It was later announced that Obscura vocalist Steffen Kummerer and Abysmal Dawn/Bereft frontman Charles Elliott would assume vocal and guitar duties for the tour, but visa issues made Kummerer's participation impossible and he was replaced by Exhumed vocalist/guitarist Matt Harvey. After the tour, Eric Greif, acting as President of Perseverance Holdings Ltd. (PHL), alleged that the owners of Sick Drummer Magazine, Ian Macdonald and Anton Hefele, had not paid the charity, the musicians, PHL, the crew or the booking agency despite the five shows of the tour being successful. However, dates for a second edition of the tour were announced in February 2013, with no involvement from Sick Drummer Magazine, and a successful tour of North America in April 2013 was followed by a sold out three-week European tour in November 2013, featuring Masvidal, Reinert, Di Giorgio and vocalist/guitarist Max Phelps. The Death To All moniker was altered to Death (DTA). Musical style and legacy The last logo used by the band found on the cover for their album The Sound of Perseverance. Death is considered to be one of the most influential bands in heavy metal and a pioneering force in death metal. Death is also now recognized as one of the most acclaimed music groups of all time, held in high praise by critics, metal musicians, and fans. Scream Bloody Gore is widely regarded as the first death metal album. Music biographer Garry Sharpe-Young considered Death \\"a genre- breaking band centered upon frontman Chuck Schuldiner\\" and that the band \\"would become one of the prime instigators of the death metal movement\\". However, Schuldiner dismissed such attributions by stating, in an interview with Metal-Rules.com, \\"I don't think I should take the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band\\". In Death's later output, the band's music became more technical and melodic, moving to a technical death metal, progressive metal and melodic death metal style. In January 2001, Mahyar Dean, an Iranian musician, wrote Death, a book about Death and Schuldiner and released it in Iran. The book includes bilingual lyrics and many articles about the band. The book was sent through the site keepers of emptywords.org to Schuldiner, who in his words was \\"truly blown away and extremely honored by the obvious work and devotion he put into bringing the book to life\\". A documentary entitled Death By Metal was released in 2016. Regarding percussion styles, Gene Hoglan is recognised as a percussionist using double kick drum equipment and one of a crop who 'set new standards in speed and endurance'.Nyman, John (2009). \\"Double Bass Legends: A Short History \\", DrumMagazine.com. Retrieved 02.04.2018 During an interview he described Sean Reinert's drumming on Human as 'godly' and praised it as 'the fastest double bassing around at the time' and 'a template which we tried to match on Individual Thought Patterns.' Schuldiner designed the Death logo and its various incarnations during the length of his career. In 1991, before the release of Human, he cleaned up the logo taking out more intricate details and the \\"T\\" in the logo was swapped from an inverted Cross to a more regular looking \\"T\\", one reason being to quash any implication of religion. The logo was changed again, between Symbolic and The Sound of Perseverance, with a more streamlined look and the removal of the hooded reaper above the \\"H\\", among other changes (shown right) Musicians Final lineup * Chuck Schuldiner (died 2001) ‚Äì guitars (1984‚Äì2001), vocals (1984‚Äì2001), bass (1984-1984,1986‚Äì1987) * Shannon Hamm ‚Äì guitars (1996‚Äì2001) * Richard Christy ‚Äì drums (1996‚Äì2001) * Scott Clendenin (died 2015) ‚Äì bass (1996-1997, 1998‚Äì2001) Previous musicians Guitarists * Rick Rozz (1984‚Äì1985, 1987‚Äì1989) * Matt Olivo (1985) * Paul Masvidal (1989, 1990, 1991‚Äì1992) * Albert Gonzalez (1990) * James Murphy (1989‚Äì1990) * Andy LaRocque (1993) * Ralph Santolla (died 2018) (1993‚Äì1994) * Bobby Koelble (1995) Bassists * Dave Tett (1984) * Scott Carlson (1985; also vocals) * Erik Meade (1985) * Terry Butler (1987‚Äì1990) * Steve Di Giorgio (1986, 1991, 1993‚Äì1994, 1997‚Äì1998) * Scott Carino - (1991‚Äì1992), played on one track on Human * Kelly Conlon (1995) Drummers * Kam Lee (1984‚Äì1985; also vocals: 1984‚Äì1984) * Eric Brecht (1985) * Chris Reifert (1986‚Äì1987) * Bill Andrews (1987‚Äì1990) * Sean Reinert (died 2020) (1991‚Äì1992) * Gene Hoglan (1993‚Äì1995) Live musicians * Scott Carino - bass (1991‚Äì1992) * Craig Locicero - guitars (1993) * Brian Benson - bass (1995) Timeline Discography *Scream Bloody Gore (1987) *Leprosy (1988) *Spiritual Healing (1990) *Human (1991) *Individual Thought Patterns (1993) *Symbolic (1995) *The Sound of Perseverance (1998) References External links  American melodic death metal musical groups American technical death metal musical groups Articles which contain graphical timelines Death metal musical groups from Florida Musical groups disestablished in 2001 Musical groups from Orlando, Florida Musical quartets American death metal musical groups ","title":"Death (metal band)"},{"id":"293593","text":"Michael Deane Harris (born January 23, 1945) is a Canadian politician who served as the 22nd Premier of Ontario from June 26, 1995 to April 14, 2002. He is most noted for the \\"Common Sense Revolution\\", his Progressive Conservative government's program of deficit reduction in combination with lower taxes and cuts to education and social services. Mike Harris is associated with the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario. Background Harris was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Hope Gooding (n√©e Robinson) and Sidney Deane Harris. He grew up in North Bay, where his father operated the Wasi Falls Resort fishing camp. Harris attended Waterloo Lutheran University (now Wilfrid Laurier University) but left after a year. At the age of 21, following his father's purchase of a ski-hill, Harris moved to Sainte-Ad√®le, Quebec where he became a ski instructor over the course of two years. After the end of his first marriage, he enrolled at Laurentian University and North Bay Teacher's College where he received his teaching certificate. He was employed as an elementary school teacher at W. J. Fricker Public School in North Bay where he taught grade seven and eight mathematics for several years in a new open- concept class of 120 students. He continued in his previous occupation as a ski-instructor at Nipissing Ridge on weekends as well as working at his father's fishing camp during the summer season. He eventually left the teaching profession as the success of the ski resort escalated. After his father sold his ski-hill operation, Harris was hired to manage North Bay's Pinewood Golf Club. From Maclean's, June 19, 1995 Early political career Harris was elected to public office as a school board trustee in 1974. He entered provincial politics in the 1981 election, and defeated the incumbent Liberal Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) in Nipissing, Mike Bolan. Harris later suggested that he was motivated to enter politics by an opposition to the policies of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.Stevenson, Mark. \\"Right in the heartland\\". Saturday Night (May 1995), Vol. 110 Issue 4, pp. 19‚Äì25 He sat as a backbencher in Bill Davis's Progressive Conservative government from 1981 to 1985. He supported Frank Miller's successful bid to succeed Davis as party leader in 1985, and took the role of rival candidate Dennis Timbrell to prepare Miller for the party's all-candidate debates. Miller was sworn in as Premier of Ontario on February 8, 1985, and appointed Harris as his Minister of Natural Resources. The Tories were reduced to a minority government in the 1985 provincial election, although Harris was personally re-elected without difficulty. He kept the Natural Resources portfolio after the election, and was also named Minister of Energy on May 17, 1985. Harris made no contributions in these portfolios, and the Miller government was soon defeated on a motion of no confidence by David Peterson's Liberals and Bob Rae's New Democratic Party. An agreement between the Liberals and the NDP allowed a Liberal minority government to govern for two years in exchange for the implementation of certain NDP policies. This decision consigned the Tories to opposition for the first time in 42 years. Miller resigned and was replaced by Larry Grossman, who led the party to a disastrous showing in the 1987 election and announced his resignation shortly thereafter. Harris was again re-elected in Nipissing without difficulty. Leadership (1990) The party was not ready to hold a leadership convention in 1987. Grossman, who had lost his legislative seat, remained the official leader of the party until 1990 while Sarnia MPP Andy Brandt served as \\"interim leader\\" in the legislature. Harris was chosen as PC house leader, and had become the party's dominant voice in the legislature by 1989. Harris entered the 1990 leadership race, and defeated Dianne Cunningham in a province-wide vote to replace Grossman as the party's official leader. The 1990 provincial election was called soon after Harris became party leader. With help from past leader Larry Grossman, Harris managed to rally his party's core supporters with pledges of tax cuts and spending reductions. Due to his teaching background, Harris was personally endorsed by several local members of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation (OSSTF). The election was won by Bob Rae's NDP. The Conservatives increased their seat total from 17 to 20 out of 130. Despite some early concerns, Harris was again able to retain his own seat. 1995 election On 3 May 1994, Harris unveiled his \\"Common Sense Revolution\\" platform. It called for significant spending and tax cuts, as well as elimination of the province's record $11 billion deficit. By the 1995 election, the governing New Democratic Party and incumbent Premier Bob Rae had become unpopular with the electorate, partly due to the state of the Ontario economy and its record debt and deficit amidst a Canada-wide recession. Lyn McLeod's Liberals were leading in pre-election polls and were expected to benefit from the swing in support away from the NDP, but they began losing support due to several controversial policy reversals and what was generally regarded as an uninspiring campaign.https://archive.macleans.ca/issue/19950619 The turning point in the election is often considered to be Harris's performance in the televised leaders' debate. Harris used his camera time to speak directly to the camera to convey his party's Common Sense Revolution platform. The Rae government had previously lost much of its base in organized labour, due in part to the unpopularity of its \\"Social Contract\\" legislation in 1993 (which Harris, after some initial vacillations, eventually voted against). Harris's opposition to Rae's affirmative action measures helped him to capture some unionized-worker support during the election, particularly among male workers. Although there were regional variations, many union voters shifted from the NDP to the Tories in 1995 (instead of to the Liberals as expected pre-campaign), enabling the Tories to win a number of new ridings, such as Cambridge and Oshawa, which had long supported the NDP.Mallan, Caroline. \\"The legacy of Mike Harris\\". Toronto Star, March 16, 2002, H02. In addition roughly half of the Tories seats came from the suburban belt surrounding Metro Toronto, often called the '905' for its telephone area code. The Conservatives' growth from 20 to 82 seats in the 130 seat legislature vaulted them from third place to a large majority government. First term as Premier of Ontario (1995‚Äì1999) Ontario Legislative Building where Harris entered as Ontario Premier in 1995 =Common Sense Revolution= Upon election, the Harris government immediately began to implement a far-reaching reform agenda to cut the large provincial deficit accumulated under the previous Rae government. One of its first major policy decisions in 1995 was to cut social assistance rates by 21.6%. The government argued that too many people were taking advantage of the program, and that it acted as a disincentive for seeking employment. The government also introduced \\"Ontario Works\\", frequently referred to as \\"workfare\\", a program that required able-bodied welfare recipients to participate in either training or job placements. Provincial income taxes were cut by 30% to pre-1990 levels. In addition, a new Fair Share Health Levy was established and charged to high- income earners to help pay for mounting health care costs. Shortly after assuming office, the Harris government announced that several hundred nurses would be laid off to cut costs in the health sector. The government also implemented a series of hospital closures and amalgamations on the recommendations of a Health Services Restructuring Commission. Harris compared the laid off hospital workers to the people who lost their jobs after the hula hoop fad died down in the early 1960s, commenting \\"Just as Hula-Hoops went out and those workers had to have a factory and a company that would manufacture something else that's in, it's the same in government, and you know, governments have put off these decisions for so many years that restructuring sometimes is painful\\" (The Globe and Mail, 6 March 1997). The Harris government cut funding of major urban infrastructure projects upon assuming office. Though construction had already begun on the Eglinton West subway in Toronto, a proposed rapid transit line to ultimately link the main north/south subway line of the city with the suburbs and airport, funding was cancelled shortly after Harris's election. Harris's government also cut health spending to counter the $30 billion cut in transfer payments from the Liberal federal government. It also introduced Telehealth Ontario, a 24-hour toll-free telephone help line with live connection to registered nurses. Harris also announced funding vehicles such as the Ontario R&D; Challenge Fund, the Ontario Innovation Trust and the Premier's Research Excellence Awards. One part of the Common Sense Revolution was to sell off various government-owned enterprises, the largest of which were to be Ontario Hydro and the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. Neither was actually sold off, but Ontario Hydro was split into five successor companies (the two largest being Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, representing generation and distribution of power respectively) with the plan of eventually selling them off. Public opposition to the sale of these money-making government enterprises postponed the government's plans. In 1999, Highway 407 was leased to a private consortium. Harris reduced the number of MPPs from 130 to 103 by redrawing riding boundaries to correspond to federal electoral districts. The Harris government passed Bill 26, the Savings and Restructuring Act, which undertook an extensive program of municipal mergers between 1996 and 2002. The province had 815 municipalities in 1996; by 2002, this had been reduced to 447. In the largest and most widely covered of these moves, the individual cities that made up Metro Toronto were merged into a single city (called the \\"megacity\\" by the media and citizens); the amalgamation was not part of their pre-election policy platform. The Conservatives argued that the move would eliminate duplication of services and increase efficiency. Opposition parties were strongly opposed to the move; the NDP took the unusual step of attempting to filibuster against the bill by reading out the name of every street in Toronto. In order to further reduce provincial commitments, financial responsibility for provincial income assistance programs was transferred or \\"downloaded\\" to municipalities, increasing the burden on municipal tax bases.\\"Hefty housing costs stay local in good news bad news provincial funding deal\\". Wellesley Institute website The list of municipalities in Ontario was updated by the Municipal Act, 2001, which is the legislation that enables incorporation and stipulates governance of Ontario's municipalities, excluding the City of Toronto, which is now subject to the City of Toronto Act, 2006. The Municipal Act, 2001 provides lower and single-tier municipalities with the authority to incorporate as cities, towns, villages, townships, or generically as municipalities. The Harris government also passed The Public Sector Salary Disclosure Act in 1996, publishing so-called Sunshine lists annually to disclose wages and benefits of public employees earning over $100 000 per year, to increase accountability. =Education= The Harris government introduced several education reforms. The fifth year of high school in Ontario, (known as the OAC year), was eliminated. This created a double graduating class in 2003 (known as the \\"double cohort\\"). Harris introduced Bill 160, (the Education Quality Improvement Act), which mandated a standardized curriculum and province-wide testing for students. This included Grade 3 and 6 EQAO (numeracy and literacy) testing, as well as a Grade 10 Literacy test. Harris introduced a requirement for High School students to complete a mandatory 40 hours of volunteering in community service in order to graduate. In 1999, it introduced a policy of \\"teacher testing\\", requiring teachers to take examinations on a regular basis. Principals and vice principals were removed from the CUPE. = The 1995 referendum on the separation of Quebec = Mike Harris, with Stephen Harper, was appointed negotiator by Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien to face Quebec negotiators nominated by the separatist leaders of Quebec: Lucien Bouchard and Mario Dumont.https://l-express.ca/reecrire-lhistoire-en-pleine-campagne- electorale/https://www.ledevoir.com/culture/medias/89192/point-de- break-a- radio-canada-portrait-grabbing-and-a-referendum At the time of the referendum campaign, Mike Harris affirmed \\"That a separate Quebec would be a foreign country.

During a confrontation, Ontario Provincial Police acting Sgt. Kenneth Deane fired on the demonstrators killing a protester named Dudley George. The Ipperwash Inquiry would later be called by the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty, due to recalcitrance on Harris's part. Second term as Premier of Ontario (1999‚Äì2002) In 1999, the Harris government was re-elected for a second term with a majority government, helped largely by its political base in the suburban areas around Toronto. The Harris government balanced the provincial budget in 1999. Harris supporters pointed to the fact that government revenues rose from $48 billion in 1995 to $64 billion by 2001, when the budget was balanced. In 1999 Harris also announced a program called Ontario's Living Legacy. The initiative added 378 new parks and protected areas, bringing the total in Ontario to 650 and increasing Ontario's protected areas to more than . Controversy arose in 2000 when the town water supply of Walkerton became infected by E. coli. Seven people died and hundreds became ill. Provincial water testing had been privatized in October 1996 by Harris's first government. It was later discovered the local official responsible for water quality, Stan Koebel, had lied, falsified records, failed to test water quality regularly, and when the outbreak occurred had failed to promptly notify the local Medical Officer of Health. In late 2004, Koebel pleaded guilty to a minor charge in relation to the offence and was sentenced to one year in jail. The Walkerton tragedy had serious ramifications for Harris's government. Harris blamed the previous NDP government for loosening water standards. Harris called a public inquiry, headed by Justice Dennis O'Connor, which later noted that in addition to Stan Koebel's failure to properly monitor and treat the water supply, deregulation of water quality testing and cuts to the Ministry of the Environment were contributing factors. The inquest into the tragedy found that the government cuts to inspection services and their privatization had created a situation in which future water safety could not be guaranteed. The Ontario government was also blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing the guidelines that had been in place. A riot developed at Queen's Park, the site of the Ontario Legislature, on 15 June 2000. The Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and other activists who included George Smitherman, lobbed molotov cocktails, bricks, and bottles. No convictions resulted from several attempts to try individuals for substantial crimes. Harris's government reduced Ontario welfare rolls by 500,000 people; critics contend these cuts led to a rise in homelessness and poverty. Supporters argued that high welfare rates had created disincentives to find entry-level jobs, and that poverty levels remained relatively unchanged between 1995 and 2005. Employment rates increased significantly during the late 1990s. The government rewrote labour laws to require secret ballot votes before workplaces could unionize. The previous NDP government's law outlawing the hiring of replacement workers during strikes was repealed. Other changes brought in by the Harris government include standardized math and literacy student tests, known as EQAO. EQAO testing is conducted in Grade 3 and 6 (for math and literacy) and 9 (for math only). Teachers are not allowed to preview the tests ahead of time, eliminating the risk of 'teaching to the test'. School principals are required to discuss EQAO results during staff meetings, and plan their focus accordingly. In Grade 10, high school students are required to pass a literacy test in order to graduate.http://www.eqao.com/en/about_eqao/about_the_agency/Pages/GeneralQuestions.aspx_Lang=E.aspx Parents valued the tests as a means for them to measure their children's achievement and that of the school against peers. A new provincial funding formula for school boards stripped the local boards of their taxation powers. In 2001, the Harris government introduced a plan to give a tax credit for parents who send their children to private and denominational schools (despite having campaigned against such an initiative in 1999). Supporters claimed it was fair given the public funding of Catholic schools, while opponents were concerned about a potential diversion of resources and students from the public system. Harris also broke with tradition to place backbench MPPs on Cabinet committees. Withdrawal from politics (2002‚Äì2004) For personal reasons Harris resigned in 2002 and was succeeded as Tory leader and premier by his long-time friend and Minister of Finance, Ernie Eves. Soon after leaving office, Harris joined the Toronto law firm Goodmans LLP, where he served as an advisor until 2010. Later in 2002, Harris also joined the Fraser Institute, a right-of-centre libertarian think tank, as a Senior Fellow. It was there that he became involved with the ideals of Preston Manning, becoming a major influence in federal politics as well as Alberta. Harris served on the board of directors of the Manning Centre. His Common Sense Revolution was repeated in Alberta with each of the steps including the firing and rehiring of nurses. In January 2003, Harris was named to the Board of Directors of Magna International. More recently in 2011, he was criticized for accepting re-election to the Board of Magna despite receiving only 38% of shareholder support. This was possible since shareholder votes in Canada are either counted as \\"for\\" a director or else considered as \\"withheld\\", meaning that they are not counted. In 2012, Harris indicated that he would step down from the Board of Directors at Magna International after completing a process to collapse the company's dual-class share structure that he helped begin in 2010. During his time as Premier, Harris was frequently cited as someone who could \\"unite the right\\" in Canada, and lead a merged party of federal Progressive Conservatives and Reform/Canadian Alliance supporters. He made serious steps toward a career in federal politics after stepping down as Premier, weighing in on issues such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq (which he supported) and the value of the Canadian dollar (which he wanted to see increase in relation to the American dollar). In late 2003, he made a speech in Halifax which many believed was the unofficial launch of a campaign to lead the new Conservative Party of Canada. In the end, Harris decided to stand aside; he later endorsed former Magna International President and CEO Belinda Stronach, in the 2004 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. He was later involved in a minor controversy, yelling and repeatedly swearing at a party official who asked him for his identification as he voted in the 2004 Ontario Progressive Conservative Party leadership election.Canadian Press. \\"Harris apologizes for swearing at Tories.\\" Thunder Bay Chronicle-Journal, September 23, 2004. Ipperwash Inquest (2005‚Äì2007) Shortly after his first election win in 1995, Harris faced his first crisis as Premier. Protesters fighting land claim issues took over a Provincial Park 200 km west of Toronto. During a confrontation with the demonstrators, Ontario Provincial Police acting Sgt. Kenneth Deane fired on First Nations demonstrators who had occupied the park, killing a protester named Dudley George. In the inquiry following the shooting, it was determined that while some protesters were carrying rocks, sticks and baseball bats, none were carrying firearms. The confrontation that led to the shooting began when police clashed with a protester armed with a steel pipe. The government and the OPP maintained that there was no political involvement in the shooting, but inside the Legislature where Parliamentary privilege outweighs any civil claims, several opposition politicians suggested that the attack may have been ordered by the Premier's office, and called for an independent judicial inquiry. In a court case that went all the way the Supreme Court of Canada, Deane maintained that he was not under orders to shoot and was convicted of criminal negligence causing death. An inquiry, headed by commissioner Justice Sidney Linden, was called after the government of Dalton McGuinty was elected in 2003. On November 28, 2005, former Attorney General Charles Harnick testified before the Ipperwash Inquiry that Harris had shouted \\"I want the fucking Indians out of the park\\" at a meeting with Ontario Provincial Police officer Ron Fox, hours before the shooting occurred (Canadian Press, 28 November 2005). Other witnesses have disputed this account, and Harris himself denied it in his testimony on 14 February 2006 at the inquiry. According to the Ontario Court of Justice history project, the Ipperwash Inquiry \\"found that the OPP, the provincial government led by Premier Mike Harris, and the federal government all bore responsibility for the events that led to George‚Äôs death. The report also called on the federal government to issue a public apology and return Camp Ipperwash ‚Äì along with compensation ‚Äì to the Kettle and Stoney Point First Nation.\\" In Volume 1 of the report it was noted that, Premier Harris's \\"comments\\" and \\"generally the speed at which he wished to end the occupation of Ipperwash Park, created an atmosphere that unduly narrowed the scope of the government's response to the Aboriginal occupation.\\" Volume 1 > The Premier's determination to seek a quick resolution closed off many > options endorsed by civil servants in the Ontario government, including > process negotiations, the appointment of mediators, and opening up > communication with the First Nations people. His narrow approach to the > occupation did not enable the situation to stabilize at the park. In spite of his denials, the Inquiry found that Harris did say \\"I want the fucking Indians out of the park.\\" This finding was based on not being able to find an existing animosity from Harnick towards Harris and the fact that Harnick was reversing previous statements that he had made in the legislature which would not be of any benefit to himself. Later life In late May 2010, Nipissing University confirmed that Harris would receive an honorary doctorate. In response, the Ontario Teachers' Federation threatened to discourage, or even prevent, their members from acting as associate teachers for students in Nipissing University's Bachelor of Education program, which requires students to complete 12 weeks of practice teaching in a classroom. Nipissing University's $25 million Harris Learning Library, which opened in 2011, is named after the former premier. In 2012, Harris started a local Nurse Next Door Home Care franchise in Toronto with wife Laura. In May 2014, Harris co-led an independent Canadian mission to observe the Ukrainian presidential election. In 2018 Ontario general election, his son Mike Harris Jr. was elected as MPP for Kitchener-Conestoga, also a member of the Progressive Conservative Party.Jeff Outhit and Catherine Thompson, \\"Mike Harris Jr. wins in Kitchener-Conestoga, taking riding previously held by Michael Harris\\".

In 1968, his family moved to Florida. He started playing guitar at the age of 9.Jane Schuldiner: The Unpublished Interview (page 1) . Guitar World. September 11, 2008. Retrieved May 7, 2011. He took classical lessons for less than a year in which his teacher taught him \\"Mary had a Little Lamb\\", which he did not like very much, and almost stopped completely until his parents bought him an electric guitar at a yard sale. The young Schuldiner immediately took to the instrument and began playing, writing and teaching himself. He was known to spend the weekend in the garage or his room playing his guitar but was limited to three hours on weekdays when school was in session. Schuldiner first played in public in his early teens. Schuldiner was originally inspired by Metallica, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, Kiss and classical jazz, among others. He was particularly interested in the metal movement known as NWOBHM ‚Äì New Wave of British Heavy Metal ‚Äì and cited bands of that genre among his favorites. He frequently cited French band Sortil√®ge as his personal favorite metal group. Slayer, Celtic Frost, Possessed, Mercyful Fate/King Diamond and Metallica were later influences he would apply more to his own band. Later in his career, Schuldiner frequently cited progressive metal bands such as Watchtower, Coroner and Queensr√øche as influences. The official Schuldiner website, Empty Words, quotes Schuldiner's mother making the claim that he enjoyed all forms of music except country and rap.Perennial Questions. Empty Words. He also enjoyed jazz and classical music in addition to metal and British alternative acts such as Lush. Schuldiner performed well in school before becoming bored with education and eventually dropped out. He later regretted this decision.Deep Look Inside, Spark Magazine. Emptywords. February 22, 2003. Retrieved February 14, 2007. He has stated that if he had not become a musician, he would have liked to have become a veterinarian or a cook. =Musical career= Schuldiner formed Death as Mantas in 1983 when he was just 16 years old. Original members were Schuldiner (guitar), Rick Rozz (guitar) and Kam Lee (drums and vocals). In January 1986, Schuldiner moved to Toronto and temporarily joined the Canadian band Slaughter.Krgin, Borivoj. Liner notes to Death's Scream Bloody Gore However, he quickly returned to continue the formation of Death. Death underwent many lineup changes. With Chris Reifert, Schuldiner eventually released the first Death album, titled Scream Bloody Gore, in 1987. He continued with 1988's Leprosy with the line-up of former Mantas guitarist Rick Rozz and rhythm section Terry Butler on bass and Bill Andrews on drums, and 1990's Spiritual Healing, where guitarist James Murphy had replaced the fired Rozz in 1989. Schuldiner in 1989 After Spiritual Healing, Schuldiner stopped working with full-time band members, preferring to work with studio and live venue musicians, due to bad relationships with Death's previous rhythm section and guitarists. This earned Schuldiner something of a 'perfectionist' reputation in the metal community. Schuldiner had also fired his manager Eric Greif but settled and re-hired him before the recording of his next, influential release. Death's breakthrough album, Human saw the band evolving to a more technical and progressive style, in which Schuldiner displayed his guitar skills more than ever. He continued in this style (and continued the success of the band) with 1993's Individual Thought Patterns, 1995's Symbolic, and finally The Sound of Perseverance in 1998. He put Death on hold after this to continue Control Denied, which he had been putting together prior to the release of The Sound of Perseverance, and released The Fragile Art of Existence in 1999. Control Denied also had other players from the latest Death album but featured a melodic metal vocalist. Schuldiner also played guitar in the \\"supergroup\\" Voodoocult on the album Jesus Killing Machine in 1994 and played a guest solo on Naphobia's 1995 release, Of Hell on the track \\"As Ancients Evolve\\" as a favor to the band's bassist at the time who was a friend of Schuldiner's. Schuldiner was also asked to be one of the many guest vocalists on Dave Grohl's 2001 Probot. Grohl, Napalm Death, Ozzy Osbourne, and Anthrax all increased efforts to raise funds for Schuldiner's medical bills with Grohl trying to involve Schuldiner on an album he was working on.[ Chuck Schuldiner: Biography, Billboard.com], (retrieved February 18, 2011) In a 1999 interview Schuldiner spoke about why he didn't sing on the Control Denied album The Fragile Art of Existence \\"...these vocals are all I ever wanted to do in Death but couldn't. I've had this dream of recording like that for years, and it seems like a dream come true. Tim Aymar is an amazing singer and this is the main difference. I think people will be surprised at the violence and strength of the album. Many people are expecting something like Iron Maiden, but, despite being one of my favorite bands, I didn't want to make an Iron Maiden-like album. I wanted to make an unpredictable album, just like I did in Death, I guess. I don't like to make predictable albums.\\" =Illness and death= On his 32nd birthday, May 13, 1999, Schuldiner was diagnosed with brain cancer. Schuldiner continued to work on his music, continuing his work with Control Denied. He was at first unable to afford the surgery that he needed immediately. A press release called for support from everyone, including fellow artists. Jane Schuldiner urged all who read the statements about Schuldiner and his illness to go out and get insurance, stating her frustration in the American healthcare system. Schuldiner had taken out medical insurance after his first surgery, but the insurer had refused to pay because the cancer pre-dated insurance being taken out. Many artists, including Kid Rock, Korn and Red Hot Chili Peppers, got together during the summer of 2001 to auction off personal items, with the funds assisting Schuldiner's medical expenses, an effort covered by MTV. Matt Heafy, vocalist and guitarist for Trivium has also stated that the band had played a benefit show for Schuldiner while he was in the hospital in their days as a local band. In November 2001, Schuldiner's condition worsened as he became ill with Pneumocystis carinii. On December 13, 2001, Schuldiner died at the age of 34 and was cremated.Eric Greif Interview ‚Äì \\"Chuck Schuldiner\\" Part 3 of 6, DEATHinHD, (retrieved April 25, 2011) MTV reported that recording artists including Dave Grohl, Mike Patton, Max Cavalera, King Diamond, Ville Valo, Trey Azagthoth, Glen Benton, Jason Newsted, Corey Taylor, and all former and active members of Death, attended his memorial service. =Legacy= With the assistance of Schuldiner's family, former manager Eric Greif handles his legacy as President of Perseverance Holdings Ltd. Schuldiner's mother Jane and sister Beth Schuldiner frequently interact with his fans and both have stated many times that they enjoy his music. Greif keeps track of his recordings and handles Schuldiner's intellectual property. Beth Schuldiner has a son named Christopher Steele, who also plays guitar and has all of Schuldiner's guitars. BC Rich also released a statement in their 2008 catalog stating that Schuldiner's signature model Stealth will be available for purchase, and that endorsement is overseen by Steele. Schuldiner had homes and two dogs in the area surrounding Orlando. Schuldiner built a studio inside the garage where many of his songs such as \\"Crystal Mountain\\" were inspired. Schuldiner's home office was the site of the Metal Crusade newsletter and fan club. A legal battle began from the time of Schuldiner's death on the settlement of the rights to the partially completed second Control Denied album, When Man and Machine Collide, which was recorded in 2000‚Äì2001 and was scheduled for release in 2013. Demos of these unreleased Control Denied songs, as well as early Death demos and live Death recordings from 1990, were released in the Zero Tolerance two-part compilation bootlegs by the Dutch Hammerheart Holdings company and the Schuldiners and Greif asserted rights on behalf of Schuldiner's Estate. The matter was settled in November 2009, anticipating the project being finished and released in 2010. Tribute concerts have been coordinated or funded by Schuldiner's mother and family and various Death tribute groups internationally. Former CKY frontman, Deron Miller, who considers Schuldiner an idol of his, got the idea, while working on various projects with former Death guitarist (and pituitary tumor survivor) James Murphy, to do a tribute album. Murphy announced he would release a Chuck Schuldiner tribute album to commemorate his lasting mark on the metal community and Schuldiner's family publicly offered support for Murphy's effort, though it has never materialized. Schuldiner's sister Beth confirmed via her YouTube channel that Death: Live in Japan, a behind the scenes Death video, as well as a potential boxset containing all of Schuldiner's works including some exclusive copies of handwritten notes by Schuldiner are in the works via Relapse Records. Schuldiner Estate lawyer Eric Greif held a charity Chuck Schuldiner Birthday Bash in Calgary, Alberta, May 13, 2011 featuring speeches by Greif and former Death guitarist Paul Masvidal, as well as bands performing Schuldiner's music.Celebrating Death in style: Calgary‚Äôs metalheads remember the legend Chuck Schuldiner, The Calgary Herald, (retrieved June 14, 2011) Greif repeated this May 12, 2012, with special guest band Massacre, featuring former Death members Rick Rozz and Terry Butler. =The book= In January 2001, Mahyar Dean, an Iranian metal guitarist/musician, wrote Death, a book about Death and Schuldiner poems. The book includes bilingual lyrics and many articles about the band. The book was sent through the site keepers of emptywords.org to Schuldiner, who in his words was \\"truly blown away and honored by the obvious work and devotion he put into bringing the book to life\\".emptywords.org April 2001 Beliefs Schuldiner once described himself as \\"a lover of life\\", \\"friendship\\", and \\"animals\\"., (accessed August 31, 2009) \\"I would like to live forever, if it was possible\\", he once said in an interview. He commonly spoke out against artists who were \\"out of control\\", garnering negative attention to the death metal scene. Schuldiner openly condemned and disavowed stereotypes of metal musicians as being harmful to animals, people, or being \\"anti-life\\" and ‚Äúbeing brutal for the sake of being brutal‚Äù. When asked about his opinions regarding an afterlife, Schuldiner responded \\"I don't know\\", but elaborated that he believed \\"this is hell\\", and that demons are in people, as they \\"create evil\\", also stating that \\"this is heaven\\" because of love and happiness. Although his father is Jewish and his mother a Christian, Schuldiner did not have strongly religious upbringing. In the documentary, \\"666 at Calling Death\\", he was asked whether Satanism was a part of his music. He replied, \\"Not at all. I really don't want to involve any type of religious theme in our music. I think that's more of a personal thing. Yeah, I'm not a Satanist and I definitely don't put that into our music on purpose. I was really young when the band first started out. I was never really into writing Satanic lyrics at all, personally. We did write gore lyrics, but it was more like kind of tongue-in-cheek, horror-movie type level. Nothing like encouraging people to go out and hurt themselves or anything stupid like that. It's pure fantasy-movie type, scary stuff. And then, I just really got into writing about reality, which is what we all have to deal with.\\" Schuldiner designed the Death logo and its various incarnations during the length of his career. In 1991, before the release of Human, he cleaned up the logo taking out more intricate details and the \\"T\\" in the logo was swapped from an inverted cross to a more regular looking \\"T\\", one reason being to quash any implication of religion.Death, Alters of Metal Interviews, (accessed August 26, 2008) Schuldiner was also openly against hard drugs; he is quoted as saying, \\"I've tripped several times. That's all because I don't like the hard drugs. And my only drugs are alcohol and grass.\\" Schuldiner also stated that he was pro-choice. He is quoted as saying that \\"it should be legal. If I was a woman surely I would like to have a choice to have a child or not. In U.S. a lot of new-borns are killed because they were unwanted. It is better to solve it immediately when a woman finds out about the pregnancy and she doesn't want a child. Better to go for an abortion than to kill a baby. That is terrible. Men cannot force women to keep a child when they themselves feel they can't.\\" Musical style Schuldiner was mostly self-taught as a guitarist. In 1993 he expressed a disinterest in music theory: \\"I know enough about what I'm playing to memorize the scales and things, but I have no idea how you would label them. As long as I can play it, memorize it and apply it, I don't need to know what you call it.\\"Kitts, Jeff. (September 1993). \\"Dead again\\" Guitar School USA Magazine. In the early days of Death, Schuldiner used a \\"deep, raspy\\" death growl vocal technique. He said in 1993 that \\"it takes a lot of energy and a lot of throat abuse to get through a show.\\" Equipment =Guitar= Schuldiner's primary guitar throughout most of his career was the B.C. Rich Stealth model, an extremely rare model available only through the BC Rich custom shop until 2008, when it was released to the public as the Chuck Schuldiner Tribute Stealth.(The stealth was also released as an N.J. model in the 80's and 90's, but was extremely rare) Prior to this, he used a BC Rich Mockingbird copy, built by \\"someone in Florida\\", and a B.C Rich Ignitor. Most of Schuldiner's sound came from a DiMarzio X2N pickup placed in the bridge. During the (In)Human Tour of the World (1991‚Äì92), Schuldiner briefly endorsed a small Wisconsin custom guitar company called Axtra, who worked with him on designs, though he still insisted on using his BC Rich during filming of the Lack of Comprehension video in September 1991 in Orlando. =Amps= The amp he used towards the end of his career was a Marshall Valvestate (Model 8100) amp head and Valvestate 4x12 speaker cabinets on Individual Thought Patterns as well as the ITP tour and eventually started using Marshall 1960 cabs. Before that he used various equipment including Randall RG100ES heads and Randall cabinets, and on the (In)Human Tour of the World he used a small GK 250ML miked up, despite having hollow 4x12 stacks 'for show'. On the first two Death albums, he stated he used a Boss distortion pedal, but didn't specify which, after which he used amplifier distortion.

The latter was an endonym of the (pre-Islamic) inhabitants of Turkey, the Middle East, and the Balkans, dating to when those regions were parts of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire. The term R√ªm is now used to describe: * Remaining pre-Islamic ethnocultural Christian minorities living in the Near East and their descendants, notably the Antiochian Greek Christians who are members of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Melkite Greek Catholic Church of Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Palestine, and the Hatay Province in Southern Turkey whose liturgy is still based on Koine Greek. * Orthodox Christian citizens of Turkey originating in the pre-Islamic (pre- Turkic invasion) native peoples of Turkey, including Pontic Greeks from the Black Sea mountains, Cappadocians from Turkey's central plateau, and Hayhurum (Orthodox Christian Armenians) from eastern Turkey. However, use of the term in Turkey is rapidly disappearing, apart from small remaining communities in Istanbul, due to genocides and expulsions of these indigenous groups throughout the 20th century, in particular the genocide of the minorities of Turkey in the 1920s and the subsequent persecutions of the 1940s and 1950s. * Geographical areas such as Anatolia and the Balkans that were historically regions within the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, or of the Seljuk Sultanate of R√ªm, which ruled over conquered Byzantines (R√ªm) in central Asia Minor from 1077 to 1308. underground R√ªm city in Turkey. Origins R√ªm is found in the pre-Islamic Namara inscriptionR√ªm, Nadia El Cheikh, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. VIII, ed. C.E. Bosworth, E. Van Donzel, W.P. Heinrichs and G. Lecomte, (Brill, 1995), 601. and later in the Quran (7th century), where it refers to a contemporary ruler (Heraclius) of the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire, the Western Roman Empire having fallen two centuries earlier (5th century).Nadia Maria El-Cheikh, Byzantium Viewed by the Arabs, (Harvard University Press, 2004), 24. A R√ªm architect from Konya built the G√∂k Medrese (Celestial Madrasa) of Sivas, while it was a capital of the Sultanate of R√ªm. The Qur'an includes the Surat Ar-Rum (the sura dealing with \\"the Romans\\", sometimes translated as \\"The Byzantines\\"). These people, referred to as Byzantines in modern Western scholarship, were inhabitants of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire and called themselves Œ°œâŒºŒπŒøŒØ or ·ø¨œâŒºŒ±·øñŒøŒπ Rhomaioi (Romans) in their own language. (The term \\"Byzantine\\" is a modern designation to describe the Eastern Roman Empire, particularly after the major political restructuring of the seventh and eighth century.) The city of Rome was known in classical Arabic instead as R≈´miyah (in modern Arabic as R≈´mƒÅ ), and Ancient Romans were called instead \\"R≈´m\\" or sometimes \\"Latin'yun\\" (Latins). The Arabs called Ancient Greece by the name \\"Y≈´nƒÅn\\" (Ionia) and ancient Greeks \\"Y≈´nƒÅnƒ´m\\" (similar to Hebrew \\"Yavan\\" [◊ô◊ï◊ï◊ü] for the country and \\"Yevanim\\" [◊ô◊ï◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù] for the people). The Byzantine state shrank from encompassing the eastern Mediterranean in 395 AD to consisting only of what is now modern Turkey and the Balkans in 700 AD; it finally fell in 1453 AD to OttomanS. The Arabs, therefore, called these pre-Islamic peoples of Turkey, the Balkans, and the Middle East \\"R√ªm\\", and called their territory \\"the land of the R√ªm\\", generally referring to what is now Turkey and the Balkans, and called the Mediterranean \\"the Sea of the R√ªm\\". After the fall of the Byzantine state in the 15th century, the Ottoman Turkish sultan Mehmed II declared himself Kayser-i Rum, literally \\"Caesar of the Romans\\". In the Ottoman Millet system, the conquered Orthodox Christian natives (i.e. the former Byzantine peoples) were placed into the \\"Rum Millet\\" (Millet-i Rum). In modern Turkey, Rum is still used to denote the Orthodox Christian minority population of Turkey and other pre-conquest remnant institutions, cf. Rum Ortodoks Patrikhanesi, the Turkish designation of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in Istanbul. R√ªm in geography Because Muslim contact with the Byzantine Empire most often took place in Asia Minor, which was the heartland of the Byzantine state from the seventh century onward, the term R√ªm became fixed there geographically. The term remained even after the conquest of central Asia Minor by the Seljuk Turks, so their territory was called the land of the Seljuks of R√ªm or the Sultanate of R√ªm. Cappadocia, Nev≈üehir/Turkey. R√ªm as a name Al-R≈´mƒ´ is a nisbah designating people originating in the Byzantine Roman Empire or lands that formerly belonged to Byzantine Roman Empire, especially Anatolia.

The lines are often used as guides for plotting graphs of functions or experimental data and drawing curves. It is commonly found in mathematics and engineering education settings and in laboratory notebooks. Graph paper is available either as loose leaf paper or bound in notebooks.  History  The first commercially published \\"coordinate paper\\" is usually attributed to a Dr. Buxton of England, who patented paper, printed with a rectangular coordinate grid, in 1794. A century later, E. H. Moore, a distinguished mathematician at the University of Chicago, advocated usage of paper with \\"squared lines\\" by students of high schools and universities. The 1906 edition of Algebra for Beginners by H. S. Hall and S. R. Knight included a strong statement that \\"the squared paper should be of good quality and accurately ruled to inches and tenths of an inch. Experience shows that anything on a smaller scale (such as 'millimeter' paper) is practically worthless in the hands of beginners.\\" The term \\"graph paper\\" did not catch on quickly in American usage. A School Arithmetic (1919) by H. S. Hall and F. H. Stevens had a chapter on graphing with \\"squared paper\\". Analytic Geometry (1937) by W. A. Wilson and J. A. Tracey used the phrase \\"coordinate paper\\". The term \\"squared paper\\" remained in British usage for longer; for example it was used in Public School Arithmetic (1961) by W. M. Baker and A. A. Bourne published in London.  Formats  * Quad paper, sometimes referred to as quadrille paper from French quadrill√©, 'small square', is a common form of graph paper with a sparse grid printed in light blue or gray and right to the edge of the paper. In the U.S. and Canada, it often has two, four or five squares to the inch for work not needing too much detail. Metric paper with similarly sparse grid typically has one or two squares per centimeter. * Dot grid paper uses dots at intersections instead of gridlines. It is often used for bullet journalling. * Engineering paper, or an Engineer's Pad, is traditionally printed on light green or tan translucent paper. It may have four, five or ten squares per inch. The grid lines are printed on the back side of each page and show through faintly to the front side. Each page has an unprinted margin. When photocopied or scanned, the grid lines typically do not show up in the resulting copy, which often gives the work a neat, uncluttered appearance. In the U.S. and Canada, some engineering professors require student homework to be completed on engineering paper. * Millimeter paper has ten squares per centimeter and is used for technical drawings. * Hexagonal paper shows regular hexagons instead of squares. These can be used to map geometric tiled or tesselated designs among other uses. * Isometric graph paper or 3D graph paper is a triangular graph paper which uses a series of three guidelines forming a 60¬∞ grid of small triangles. The triangles are arranged in groups of six to make hexagons. The name suggests the use for isometric views or pseudo-three-dimensional views. Among other functions, they can be used in the design of trianglepoint embroidery. It can be used to draw angles accurately. * Logarithmic paper has rectangles drawn in varying widths corresponding to logarithmic scales for semi-log plots or log- log plots. * Normal probability paper is another graph paper with rectangles of variable widths. It is designed so that \\"the graph of the normal distribution function is represented on it by a straight line\\", i.e. it can be used for a normal probability plot. * Polar coordinate paper has concentric circles divided into small arcs or 'pie wedges' to allow plotting in polar coordinates. In general, graphs showing grids are sometimes called Cartesian graphs because the square can be used to map measurements onto a Cartesian (x vs. y) coordinate system. It is also available without lines but with dots at the positions where the lines would intersect.

The company also manufactures wood products. Weyerhaeuser is a real estate investment trust. History In 1904, after years of successful Mississippi River-based lumber and mill operations with Frederick Denkmann and others, Frederick Weyerh√§user moved west to fresh timber areas and founded the Weyerh√§user Timber Company. Fifteen partners and of Washington timberland were involved in the founding, and the land was purchased from James J. Hill of the Great Northern Railway. In 1929, the company built what was then the world's largest sawmill in Longview, Washington. Weyerh√§user's pulp mill in Longview, which began production in 1931, sustained the company financially during the Great Depression. In 1959, the company eliminated the word \\"Timber\\" from its name to better reflect its operations. In 1965, Weyerh√§user built its first bleached kraft pulp mill in Canada. Weyerh√§user implemented its High Yield Forestry Plan in 1967 which drew upon 30 years of forestry research and field experience. It called for the planting of seedlings within one year of a harvest, soil fertilization, thinning, rehabilitation of brushlands, and, eventually, genetic improvement of trees. In 1975 the company bought the 3,200 acres of land of the Northwest Landing and developed the town of DuPont using a New Urbanism model. Weyerh√§user consolidated its core businesses in the late 1990s and ended its services in mortgage banking, personal care products, financial services, and information systems consulting. Weyerh√§user also expanded into South America, Australia, and Asia. In 1999, Weyerh√§user purchased MacMillan Bloedel Limited, a large Canadian forestry company. Then in 2002 after a protracted hostile buyout, the company acquired Willamette Industries, Inc. of Portland, Oregon. On August 23, 2006, Weyerh√§user announced a deal which spun off its fine paper business to be combined with Domtar, a $3.3 billion cash and stock deal leaving Weyerhauser stock holders with 55 percent ownership of the new Domtar company. In March 2008, Weyerh√§user Company announced the sale of its containerboard packaging and recycling business to International Paper for $6 billion in cash, subject to post closing adjustments.

It follows the chalk escarpment that includes the Berkshire Downs and Chiltern Hills. Background It is generally said to be, within Great Britain, one of the oldest roads, the route of which can still be traced, being one of the few long-distance trackways to have existed before the Romans occupied the country. However, this has been disputed, and the evidence for its being a prehistoric route has been questioned. The name is Celto-British in derivation, and may be named after the Iceni tribe. They may have established this route to permit trade with other parts of the country from their base in East Anglia. It has also been suggested that the road has older prehistoric origins. The name is also said to have been initially used for the part to the west and south (i.e. south of the River Thames) but now refers usually to the track or traces north of the Thames. From ancient times, at least as early as the Iron Age period (before the Roman invasion of 43 AD) and through Anglo- Saxon times, it stretched from Berkshire through Oxfordshire and crossed the River Thames at Cholsey, near Wallingford. Early documentary evidence The earliest mentions of the Icknield Way are in Anglo-Saxon charters from the year 903 onwards. The oldest surviving copies were made in the 12th and 13th centuries, and these use the spellings , , , and . The charters refer to locations at Wanborough, Hardwell in Uffington, Lockinge, Harwell, Blewbury and Risborough, which span a distance of from Wiltshire to Buckinghamshire. The \\"Four Highways\\" of medieval England The Icknield Way was one of four highways that appear in the literature of the 1130s. Henry of Huntingdon wrote that the Ermine Street, Fosse Way, Watling Street and Icknield Way had been constructed by royal authority. The Leges Edwardi Confessoris gave royal protection to travellers on these roads, and the Icknield Way was said to extend across the width of the kingdom. Geoffrey of Monmouth elaborated the story by saying that Belinus had improved the four roads so that it was clear that they were the protected highways. Around 1250, the Four Highways were shown by Matthew Paris on a diagramatic map of Britain called Scema Britannie. The Icknield Way is depicted by a straight line from Salisbury (i.e., Old Sarum) to Bury St Edmunds which intersects the other three roads near Dunstable. =Icknield Street= In the 14th century, Ranulf Higdon described a different route for the Icknield Way: from Winchester to Tynemouth by way of Birmingham, Lichfield, Derby, Chesterfield and York. This route includes the Roman road running from Bourton-on-the-Water to Templeborough near Rotherham, which is now called Icknield Street (or Ryknild Street) to distinguish it from the Icknield Way. Route Spencer Gore: \\"Icknield Way\\", 1912. Used as the cover picture of \\"The Icknield Way Path - A Walkers' Guide\\" published by the Icknield Way Association in 2012 In many places the track consists or consisted of several routes, particularly as it passes along the line of the escarpment of the Chilterns, probably because of the seasonal usage, and possibly the amount of traffic especially of herds or flocks of livestock. To the west the track can be detected below the escarpments of the Berkshire Downs. Near Wantage, the route along the ridge of the Downs is known as The Ridgeway, and the name Icknield Way is applied to a parallel lowland route above the spring-line at the northern edge of the chalk. Between Lewknor and Ivinghoe there are two parallel courses known as the Lower Icknield Way and the Upper Icknield Way. In Cambridgeshire, Street Way (Ashwell Street), Ditch Way and others have been put forward as variant routes, possibly for use in summer or winter. Many modern roads follow the Icknield Way, for example the B489 from Aston Clinton to Dunstable and the A505 from Baldock to Royston. In some places, especially from the east of Luton in Bedfordshire to Ickleford (so named from the Way crossing a stream) near Hitchin in Hertfordshire, the route is followed by minor roads, and is not distinguishable at all in many places, except by landscape features such as barrows and mounds which line the route, and indentation presumably from ancient and frequent use. It could be described as a belt studded with archaeological sites found at irregular intervals. The Icknield Way used to form part of the boundary between Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, and at one time Royston was cut in two by this boundary. Royston is where the Icknield Way crosses Ermine Street. In the south-west some writers take the Way to Exeter, while others only take it as far as Salisbury. To the north-east, Icklingham, Suffolk, and Caistor-by- Norwich, Yarmouth and Hunstanton, Norfolk have all been proposed as the destination. In support of the western route, a road at Dersingham near Hunstanton was named Ykenildestrethe and Ikelynge Street in the 13th century. Modern paths Modern long-distance footpaths have been created from Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast to Holme-next-the-Sea on the Norfolk coast, following the general line of the Icknield Way. The Hobhouse Committee report of 1947 suggested the creation of a path between Seaton Bay and the Chiltern ridge, and in 1956 Tom Stephenson proposed a longer route to Cambridge. A route through Norfolk was discussed in the 1960s. The first section to be officially designated as a Long-Distance Footpath (as National Trails were then known) was that from Overton Hill to Ivinghoe Beacon, and it was declared open as the Ridgeway in 1973. The Peddars Way, from Knettishall Heath to Holme-next-the-Sea, forms part of the Peddars Way and Norfolk Coast Path National Trail, which was opened as a Long Distance Route in 1986. Between the Ridgeway and Peddars Way, parts of the original line of the Icknield Way had been covered in tarmac or built over, so a route was devised that avoids walking on roads. In 1992, this was designated by the Countryside Commission as a Regional Route called the Icknield Way Path. The Wessex Ridgeway from Lyme Regis to Marlborough was declared open by Dorset County Council in 1994. Charles Thurstan Shaw, archaeologist and long-distance walker, founded the Icknield Way Association which campaigned to reopen the entire Icknield Way as a long-distance path in 1984, the same year he produced the first walker's guide to the route.(31 Mar 2013). Professor Thurstan Shaw - Obituary. The Daily Telegraph.CANTAB RAMBLER73 April 2013 - Thurstan Shaw, 1914 ‚Äì 2013. cambridgeramblers.org The author Ray Quinlan has combined most of the Wessex Ridgeway, the Ridgeway National Trail, the Icknield Way Path, the Peddars Way, and a small part of the Norfolk Coast Path to form a path that he calls the Greater Ridgeway, with a length of approximately from Lyme Regis to Hunstanton. Parts of the Ridgeway National Trail and the Icknield Way Path are only usable as a footpath, so the Icknield Way Path Riders Route or Icknield Way Trail have been created for horseriders and cyclists. The route runs from Bledlow to Roudham Heath, where it joins the Peddars Way Riders Route. Artists and writers on the Way The Icknield Way has inspired a number of writers and artists. Spencer Gore, the founder of the Camden Town Group of artists, painted the route in 1912 while staying with his friend Harold Gilman at Letchworth. His work, influenced by C√©zanne, van Gogh and Gauguin, is acknowledged as one of the pioneering works of British Modernism.Google Arts & Culture - The Icknield Way. From the collection of Art Gallery of New South Wales.Smith, Bernard (2002). A Pavane for Another Time. . Macmillan Education AU. p.449 One of the best known literary travellers of the Icknield Way is the poet Edward Thomas, who walked the path in 1911 and published his account in 1913. Thomas was interested in ancient roads and inspired by Hilaire Belloc's Old Road and other travel memoirs published by Constable written by R. Hippisley Cox, Harold J.E. Peake and others. Although the book takes the form of a single 10-day journey, Thomas wrote the book in stages over the course of a year. He was often joined by his brother Julian, both rising at 5 am or 6 am to walk a day. Although more interested in poetic description, his publisher directed him to give more concrete details of his route, thus the book is closer to being a guidebook than Thomas' earlier, more poetic, travel books.Moorcroft Wilson, Jean (2015). Edward Thomas: from Adlestrop to Arras: A Biography Bloomsbury. . p.227-229. Inspired by Thomas's journey, contemporary British nature writer, Robert MacFarlane, begins his book of walking ancient paths, The Old Ways, by walking the Icknield Way, \\"hoping to summon him [Thomas] by walking where he had walked\\".MacFarlane, Robert (2012). The Old Ways: A Journey on Foot. Penguin. . p.47. George R. R. Martin used the \\"Four Highways\\" as the model for the Kingsway in his A Song of Ice and Fire novels.Higgs, John (2017). Watling Street: Travels Through Britain and Its Ever-Present Past. Hachette UK. .p.47. The first episode of the 2016-17 documentary series Britain's Ancient Tracks with Tony Robinson was about the Icknield Way and included drone views of the trail.

It developed and published numerous games, including starting the Civilization and X-COM series. Most of their internally developed titles were vehicle simulation and strategy games. In 1993, the company lost most of its UK-based personnel and became a subsidiary of Spectrum HoloByte. Subsequent cuts and corporate policies led to Sid Meier, Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds leaving and forming Firaxis Games in 1996, as MicroProse closed its ex-Simtex development studio in Austin, Texas. In 1998, following an unsuccessful buyout attempt by GT Interactive Software, the struggling MicroProse (Spectrum HoloByte) became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive and its development studios in Alameda, California and Chapel Hill, North Carolina were closed the following year. In 2001, MicroProse ceased to exist as an entity and Hasbro Interactive sold the MicroProse intellectual properties to Infogrames Entertainment, SA. MicroProse UK's former main office in Chipping Sodbury was closed in 2002, followed by the company's former headquarters in Hunt Valley, Maryland in 2003. The brand was revived in 2007 when Interactive Game Group acquired it from Atari Interactive, formerly Infogrames. The MicroProse brand was licensed to the Legacy Engineering Group for consumer electronics. Cybergun owned the MicroProse brand from 2010 to 2018, which was then acquired by David Lagettie working with Stealey. Since its revival by Lagettie in 2019, it had announced 3 upcoming games: Sea Power : Naval Combat in the Missile Age by the developer Triassic Games AB, Task Force Admiral - Vol.1: American Carrier Battles by Drydock Dreams Games, and Operation: Harsh Doorstop by Drakeling Labs. MicroProse has also published Warfare 1944 by Drakeling Labs. History =Independent company (1982‚Äì1993)= 1980s In summer 1982, mutual friends who knew of their shared interest in aviation arranged for retired military pilot Bill Stealey and computer programmer Sid Meier to meet in Las Vegas. After Meier surprised Stealey by repeatedly defeating him when playing Red Baron, he explained that he had analyzed the game's programming to predict future actions and claimed that he could design a better home computer game in one week. Stealey promised to sell the game if Meier could develop it. Although Meier needed two months to produce Hellcat Ace, Stealey sold 50 copies in his first sales appointment and the game became the first product of their new company. They planned to name it Smugger's Software, but chose MicroProse. (In 1987 the company agreed to change its name to avoid confusion with MicroPro International, but MicroPro decided to rename itself after its WordStar word processor). MicroProse became profitable in its second month and had $10 million in sales by 1986. MicroProse advertised its first batch of games in 1982, under the headline \\"Experience the MicroProse Challenge!!!\\" All three were written by Sid Meier for the Atari 8-bit family of home computers: platformer Floyd of the Jungle, 2D shooter Chopper Rescue, and first-person airplane combat game Hellcat Ace. Hellcat Ace began a series of increasingly sophisticated 8-bit flight simulation games, including Spitfire Ace (1982) and Solo Flight (1983), that defined the company. Gunship Design Team flight jacket In 1983, MicroProse ported Floyd of the Jungle to the Commodore 64, their first product for that machine. By 1984, the company had begun supporting the Apple II and IBM compatibles. MicroProse released the air traffic control game Kennedy Approach, written by Andy Hollis, in 1985. Conflict in Vietnam (1986) was the final MicroProse title for the Atari 8-bit line. By 1987, Computer Gaming World considered MicroProse one of the top five computer game companies, alongside likes of Activision and Electronic Arts. The PC market was, along with the Commodore 64, the company's top priority. By 1989, support for 8-bit machines was dropped. MicroProse supported the Amiga and developed for that machine its entire nine years on the market (Amiga development was outsourced to MicroProse UK in 1991). MicroProse also started a branch in the United Kingdom to cross-publish titles in Europe, and to import some European titles to be published in the United States. Notable products from this period include simulation games F-15 Strike Eagle, F-19 Stealth Fighter, Gunship, Project Stealth Fighter, Red Storm Rising and Silent Service, and action-strategy games such as Sid Meier's Pirates! and Sword of the Samurai. Several games from different developers were also distributed by MicroProse under the labels \\"Firebird\\" and \\"Rainbird\\" (acquired after buying Telecomsoft in 1989), including Carrier Command, Midwinter and Savage. 1990s In the early 1990s, MicroProse released the strategy games Sid Meier's Railroad Tycoon and Sid Meier's Civilization, designed by Meier and developed by its internal division, MPS Labs, on multiple platforms. Critically acclaimed, both of them quickly became two of the best-selling strategy games of all time and spawned multiple sequels. Some of MicroProse's simulation games from the 1980s received remakes in the early 1990s, such as Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0, Silent Service II and Gunship 2000, and made some first cautious attempts to expand into the console market with F-117A Stealth Fighter and Super Strike Eagle (MicroProse also ported several of their titles to the 16- and 32-bit consoles during the mid-1990s). Brand new simulation and strategy titles included 1942: The Pacific Air War, Dogfight, Fields of Glory, Formula One Grand Prix, Harrier Jump Jet, Knights of the Sky, Starlord, Subwar 2050 and Task Force 1942. MicroProse attempted to diversify beyond its niche roots as a sim and strategy game company, looking for opportunities into the arcade game industry. MicroProse designed further action-strategy titles such as Covert Action (also designed by Sid Meier) and Hyperspeed, and experimented with the role-playing genre by developing BloodNet and Darklands (in addition to publishing The Legacy: Realm of Terror). The company invested a large sum of money to create its arcade game division as well as their own graphic adventure game engine. Meier felt that Stealey was taking the company in a risky direction, and the two could not work out their differences. Meier opted to quietly sell Stealey his share of the company but remained on in the same apparent role for all other purposes to the rest of the staff and their customers to allow Stealey to proceed in this direction. The arcade division did not perform well, and was canceled after making only two games: F-15 Strike Eagle: The Arcade Game and Battle of the Solar System (both of which featured high-end 3D graphics but failed to become popular as they were too different from existing machines), while the adventure game engine was used for just three games: Rex Nebular and the Cosmic Gender Bender, Return of the Phantom and Dragonsphere, before it was sold off to Sanctuary Woods. In August 1991, MicroProse filed for an initial public offering. The company hoped to raise $18 million to help repay debts from its unsuccessful arcade games. During the same period, MicroProse created two labels: MicroStyle (UK), and MicroPlay Software (US), using them for publishing a variety of externally developed games, such as Challenge of the Five Realms, Command HQ, Global Conquest, Elite Plus, Flames of Freedom, Rick Dangerous, Stunt Car Racer, Xenophobe and XF5700 Mantis. In 1992 MicroProse acquired Paragon Software. It also acquired Leeds-based flight simulation developer Vektor Grafix,\\"MicroProse buys Vektor Grafix\\", Computer Business Review Online which had already developed titles for them (such as B-17 Flying Fortress), turning it into a satellite development studio named MicroProse Leeds. =Under Spectrum HoloByte (1993‚Äì1998)= In December 1993, following Black Wednesday in the UK, MicroProse Software Inc. merged with Spectrum HoloByte, another game company that specialized in simulation games, to form MicroProse Inc. Bill Stealey, who was good friends with Spectrum HoloByte president Gilman Louie, convinced Louie to help MicroProse as Stealey was afraid that some bank would not understand the company culture. MicroProse UK was forced to close its two satellite studios of MicroProse in northern England and dispose of over 40 staff at its Chipping Sodbury head office (Microprose Chipping Sodbury). A core group of artists, designers, and programmers left MicroProse UK to join Psygnosis, which opened an office in Stroud specifically to attract ex-MicroProse employees. In 1994, Stealey departed MicroProse and Spectrum HoloByte agreed to buy out his shares. He later commented, \\"Spectrum Holobyte had a lot of cash and very few products. Microprose had a lot of products and no cash. It was a great marriage, but the new company only needed one chairman, so I resigned.\\" Stealey went on to found an independent game company Interactive Magic (also specializing in vehicle simulators and strategy games), while Andy Hollis departed for Origin Systems, and Sandy Petersen joined id Software. Spectrum Holobyte managed to line up licenses, including Top Gun (Top Gun: Fire At Will), Magic: The Gathering (Magic: The Gathering), Star Trek: The Next Generation (A Final Unity, Birth of the Federation, Klingon Honor Guard) and MechWarrior (MechCommander, MechWarrior 3). Strategy game UFO: Enemy Unknown (X-COM: UFO Defense) proved to be an unanticipated hit in 1994, spawning multiple sequels. In 1996, Spectrum HoloByte/MicroProse bought out Simtex, earlier a developer of MicroProse-published bestsellers Master of Orion and Master of Magic. Simtex was re-branded as MicroProse Texas (Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares), based in Austin, Texas. Other MicroProse developed and/or published games during that period included 7th Legion, Addiction Pinball, AEGIS: Guardian of the Fleet, Civilization II, Dark Earth, F-15 Strike Eagle III, Fleet Defender, Grand Prix 2, Pizza Tycoon, Sid Meier's Colonization, Tinhead, Transport Tycoon, X-COM: Apocalypse, X-COM: Interceptor and X-COM: Terror from the Deep. Insufficient financial resources largely prevented MicroProse from developing games for other game platforms, therefore MicroProse concentrated on the PC game market.\\"Hasbro Buying Alameda's MicroProse\\" from San Francisco Chronicle MicroProse Software continued as separate subsidiary company under Spectrum HoloByte until 1996. That year, Spectrum HoloByte started cutting a majority of the MicroProse staff to reduce costs. Soon after, it consolidated all of its titles under the MicroProse brand (essentially renaming itself MicroProse). MicroProse's remaining co-founder Sid Meier, along with Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds, departed the company after the staff cut, forming a new company named Firaxis Games. On October 5, 1997, GT Interactive Software announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire MicroProse for $250 million in stock, the deal had even been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of both companies. After the announcement MicroProse's stock price reached $7 a share. GT Interactive expected the deal to be completed by the end of that year.\\"GT Interactive to Expand as World's Fastest Growing Interactive Entertainment Company Through Acquisition of MicroProse\\" from BNET Research Center\\"$250 Million Stock Deal for Microprose\\" from The New York Times But the acquisition was cancelled on December 5, as according to both CEOs \\"the time is simply not right\\" for the deal. MicroProse's stock plummeted to just $2.31 after the announcement of the deal's cancellation.\\"Company News; Microprose And Gt Interactive End Merger Talks\\" from The New York Times According to Computer Gaming World, the merger was annulled due to a \\"fundamental\\" disagreement over how the joint company would be writing off its research and development costs, as MicroProse insisted to keep their method of paying off the developer immediately.Computer Gaming World 164 (March 1998), page 40. In November 1997, MicroProse was sued by both Avalon Hill (who had the U.S. publishing rights to the name Civilization)The Fall of Avalon Hill from Academic Gaming Review and Activision for copyright infringement. MicroProse responded by buying Hartland Trefoil, which was the original designer and manufacturer of the Civilization board game, and then sued Avalon Hill and Activision for trademark infringement and unfair business practices as a result of Activision's decision to develop and publish Civilization video games. Because Hasbro was negotiating the acquisition of both Avalon Hill and MicroProse, the lawsuits were settled in July 1998. Under the terms of the settlement MicroProse became the sole owner of the rights of the name Civilization and Activision acquired a license to publish a Civilization video game which was later titled Civilization: Call to Power. =Under Hasbro Interactive (1998‚Äì2001)= In preparation for its sale, MicroProse closed down its studio in Austin in June 1998; as a result of the closure, 35 employees lost their jobs.Microprose Inc/DE ¬∑ 10-Q ¬∑ For 6/30/98 from SEC Info On August 14, 1998, Hasbro issued a $70 million cash tender offer to purchase all MicroProse's shares for $6 each.Hasbro MicroProse acquisition information (SC 14D1) from SEC Info (secinfo.com) This deal was completed on September 14, when Hasbro bought 91% of MicroProse's shares and announced that MicroProse had become a wholly owned subsidiary.Hasbro MicroProse acquisition information (SC 14D1/A) from SEC Info The remaining shares would also be acquired for $6 in cash.

Infogrames began to slowly phase out the brand name, with many MicroProse branded titles that were previously released by Hasbro being reissued with Infogrames' logo on the packaging. The final two games branded under the MicroProse name were Tactical Ops: Assault on Terror and Grand Prix 4. Infogrames shut down the former MicroProse studio in Chipping Sodbury in September 2002.Gamespot.com , \\"Infogrames closes UK MicroProse studio\\", from GameSpot Infogrames intermittently used the Atari name as a brand name for selected titles before officially changing the U.S. subsidiary's name to Atari, Inc. in 2003.

However, several game developers now exist in the area, including Firaxis Games and BreakAway Games, who all owe their origin to MicroProse. = Brand revival (2019‚Äìpresent) = In 2019, the MicroProse brand (then owned by Cybergun) was purchased and revived by David Lagettie, one of the makers of TitanIM open world military simulation software. Lagettie was a former developer for Bohemia Interactive at their Australian studios before starting his own company to create video game simulations to be used by military groups. Lagettie had been a fan of the original MicroProse games growing up, and as he saw the games transition ownership and eventually disappear, he started investigating the fate of Microprose around 2005. When possible, he began buying whatever IP from Microprose he could, including the name and original logo trademarks, allowing him to establish the new Microprose as a games publisher by 2019. Lagettie's acquisitions drew the attention of Stealey, who subsequently inquired to Lagettie about his plans and leading to Stealey to join Lagettie in an unofficial manner in the new Microprose. The new company announced in May 2020 the first of three new games to be released for personal computers, Triassic Games' Sea Power and Drydock Dreams' Task Force Admiral, and Hexdraw's Second Front, with about twenty additional titles planned out for publishing in the future. Lagettie said that while the new Microprose will branch out to other game genres such as adventure and racing games, their core portfolio will be centered on combat-based games. Games Games by MicroProse include Civilization (1991), Civilization II (1996), Darklands (1992), F-15 Strike Eagle (1985), F-19 Stealth Fighter (1988), Formula One Grand Prix (1992), Grand Prix 2 (1995), Gunship (1986), M1 Tank Platoon (1989), Master of Magic (1994), Master of Orion (1993), Master of Orion II (1996), Midwinter (1989), Pirates! (1987), Project Stealth Fighter (1987), Railroad Tycoon (1990), Red Storm Rising (1988), Silent Service (1985), and UFO: Enemy Unknown (1994). Legacy Sid Meier, who now works at Firaxis Games, eventually got the rights of most of his games back under his control from Atari Inc. Railroad Tycoon series rights was sold to PopTop Software, who developed Railroad Tycoon II and Railroad Tycoon 3. Eventually, Poptop was acquired by Take-Two Interactive, which later also acquired Firaxis as well, thus returning the rights to the series to Meier, resulting in Sid Meier's Railroads!, released by Take-Two's 2K Games along with a new Sid Meier's Pirates! and the new Civilization games, including Sid Meier's Civilization III, Sid Meier's Civilization IV, Sid Meier's Civilization V, Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Colonization and Sid Meier's Civilization Revolution. Firaxis Games also developed the X-COM series' reboot XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which was followed by 2K Marin's spin-off The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. Master of Orion III was developed by Quicksilver Software and released under the Infogrames label. Falcon 4.0 rights were sold to Graphsim Entertainment, who developed Falcon 4.0: Allied Force. =Brand name= In 2007, Interactive Game Group acquired the MicroProse brand from Atari Interactive Inc, which filed for transfer of trademark protection on December 27, 2007. Interactive Game Group then shared a percentage of the MicroProse brand to I-Drs At in January 2008. Originally, claims as to what titles and other intellectual properties were also acquired by the Interactive Game Group from Infogrames were originally unverified, and the last verified owner of MicroProse properties was Infogrames. Later on, however, MicroProse's IPs that remained with Atari/Infogrames were eventually included as part of asset sale and sold to Tommo, who have been republish the titles under their \\"Retroism\\" brand. The Interactive Game Group also licensed the MicroProse brand to the Legacy Engineering Group (LEG), which used the license to form subsidiaries called Microprose Systems and Microprose Consumer Electronics Division, selling consumer electronics from February 2008 to the second half of 2008. In October 2008, the licensing agreement between LEG and Frederic Chesnais, owner of Interactive Game Group, was discontinued, forcing LEG to rebrand its subsidiaries to Legacy Consumer Electronics. In 2010, the Cybergun Group, manufacturer of airsoft gun products, merged with Interactive Game Group and MicroProse, giving them access to officially licensed weapons. The name has been used by a video game studio Microprose (with no capital \\"P\\" in the name). Since 2018, the MicroProse brand has been owned by David Lagettie, working with Bill Stealey's own company iEntertainment Network on the WarBirds series of combat flight simulators.

Acta 35. affirmed their significance. The axioms exist in the context of constructive quantum field theory, and they are meant to provide a basis for rigorous treatment of quantum fields, and strict foundation for the perturbative methods used. One of the Millennium Problems is to realize the Wightman axioms in the case of Yang‚ÄìMills fields. Rationale One basic idea of the Wightman axioms is that there is a Hilbert space upon which the Poincar√© group acts unitarily. In this way, the concepts of energy, momentum, angular momentum and center of mass (corresponding to boosts) are implemented. There is also a stability assumption which restricts the spectrum of the four-momentum to the positive light cone (and its boundary). However, this isn't enough to implement locality. For that, the Wightman axioms have position dependent operators called quantum fields which form covariant representations of the Poincar√© group. Since quantum field theory suffers from ultraviolet problems, the value of a field at a point is not well-defined. To get around this, the Wightman axioms introduce the idea of smearing over a test function to tame the UV divergences which arise even in a free field theory. Because the axioms are dealing with unbounded operators, the domains of the operators have to be specified. The Wightman axioms restrict the causal structure of the theory by imposing either commutativity or anticommutativity between spacelike separated fields. They also postulate the existence of a Poincar√©-invariant state called the vacuum and demand it is unique. Moreover, the axioms assume that the vacuum is \\"cyclic\\", i.e., that the set of all vectors which can be obtained by evaluating at the vacuum state elements of the polynomial algebra generated by the smeared field operators is a dense subset of the whole Hilbert space. Lastly, there is the primitive causality restriction which states that any polynomial in the smeared fields can be arbitrarily accurately approximated (i.e. is the limit of operators in the weak topology) by polynomials in smeared fields over test functions with support in an open set in Minkowski space whose causal closure is the whole Minkowski space. Axioms =W0 (assumptions of relativistic quantum mechanics)= Quantum mechanics is described according to von Neumann; in particular, the pure states are given by the rays, i.e. the one-dimensional subspaces, of some separable complex Hilbert space. In the following, the scalar product of Hilbert space vectors Œ® and Œ¶ will be denoted by \\\\langle\\\\Psi,\\\\Phi\\\\rangle, and the norm of Œ® will be denoted by \\\\lVert\\\\Psi\\\\rVert. The transition probability between two pure states [Œ®] and [Œ¶] can be defined in terms of non-zero vector representatives Œ® and Œ¶ to be :P([\\\\Psi],[\\\\Phi]) = \\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\Psi,\\\\Phi\\\\rangle^2}{\\\\lVert\\\\Psi\\\\rVert^2 \\\\lVert\\\\Phi\\\\rVert^2} and is independent of which representative vectors, Œ® and Œ¶, are chosen. The theory of symmetry is described according to Wigner. This is to take advantage of the successful description of relativistic particles by Eugene Paul Wigner in his famous paper of 1939. See Wigner's classification. Wigner postulated the transition probability between states to be the same to all observers related by a transformation of special relativity. More generally, he considered the statement that a theory be invariant under a group G to be expressed in terms of the invariance of the transition probability between any two rays. The statement postulates that the group acts on the set of rays, that is, on projective space. Let (a,L) be an element of the Poincar√© group (the inhomogeneous Lorentz group). Thus, a is a real Lorentz four-vector representing the change of space-time origin x ‚Ü¶ x ‚àí a where x is in the Minkowski space M4 and L is a Lorentz transformation, which can be defined as a linear transformation of four-dimensional space-time which preserves the Lorentz distance c¬≤t¬≤ ‚àí x‚ãÖx of every vector (ct,x). Then the theory is invariant under the Poincar√© group if for every ray Œ® of the Hilbert space and every group element (a,L) is given a transformed ray Œ®(a,L) and the transition probability is unchanged by the transformation: :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\Psi(a,L),\\\\Phi(a,L) \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\left\\\\langle\\\\Psi,\\\\Phi\\\\right\\\\rangle Wigner's theorem says that under these conditions, the transformation on the Hilbert space are either linear or anti-linear operators (if moreover they preserve the norm then they are unitary or antiunitary operators); the symmetry operator on the projective space of rays can be lifted to the underlying Hilbert space. This being done for each group element (a, L), we get a family of unitary or antiunitary operators U(a, L) on our Hilbert space, such that the ray Œ® transformed by (a, L) is the same as the ray containing U(a, L) œà. If we restrict attention to elements of the group connected to the identity, then the anti-unitary case does not occur. Let (a, L) and (b, M) be two Poincar√© transformations, and let us denote their group product by (a, L).(b,M); from the physical interpretation we see that the ray containing U(a, L)[U(b, M)œà] must (for any psi) be the ray containing U((a, L). (b, M))œà (associativity of the group operation). Going back from the rays to the Hilbert space, these two vectors may differ by a phase (and not in norm because we choose unitary operators), which can depend on the two group elements (a, L) and (b, M), i.e. we don't have a representation of a group but rather a projective representation. These phase can't always be cancelled by redefining each U(a), example for particles of spin ¬Ω. Wigner showed that the best one can get for Poincare group is :U(a,L)U(b,M)= \\\\pm U((a,L).(b,M)) i.e. the phase is a multiple of \\\\pi . For particles of integer spin (pions, photons, gravitons...) one can remove the +/‚àí sign by further phase changes, but for representations of half-odd-spin, we cannot, and the sign changes discontinuously as we go round any axis by an angle of 2œÄ. We can, however, construct a representation of the covering group of the Poincare group, called the inhomogeneous SL(2,C); this has elements (a, A) where as before, a is a four-vector, but now A is a complex 2 √ó 2 matrix with unit determinant. We denote the unitary operators we get by U(a, A), and these give us a continuous, unitary and true representation in that the collection of U(a,A) obey the group law of the inhomogeneous SL(2,C). Because of the sign-change under rotations by 2œÄ, Hermitian operators transforming as spin 1/2, 3/2 etc., cannot be observables. This shows up as the univalence superselection rule: phases between states of spin 0, 1, 2 etc. and those of spin 1/2, 3/2 etc., are not observable. This rule is in addition to the non-observability of the overall phase of a state vector. Concerning the observables, and states v), we get a representation U(a, L) of Poincar√© group, on integer spin subspaces, and U(a, A) of the inhomogeneous SL(2,C) on half-odd-integer subspaces, which acts according to the following interpretation: An ensemble corresponding to U(a, L)v) is to be interpreted with respect to the coordinates x^\\\\prime=L^{-1}(x-a) in exactly the same way as an ensemble corresponding to v) is interpreted with respect to the coordinates x; and similarly for the odd subspaces. The group of space-time translations is commutative, and so the operators can be simultaneously diagonalised. The generators of these groups give us four self-adjoint operators, P_0,P_j, j = 1, 2, 3, which transform under the homogeneous group as a four-vector, called the energy-momentum four- vector. The second part of the zeroth axiom of Wightman is that the representation U(a, A) fulfills the spectral condition - that the simultaneous spectrum of energy-momentum is contained in the forward cone: :P_0\\\\geq 0............... P_0^2 - P_jP_j\\\\geq 0. The third part of the axiom is that there is a unique state, represented by a ray in the Hilbert space, which is invariant under the action of the Poincar√© group. It is called a vacuum. =W1 (assumptions on the domain and continuity of the field)= For each test function f, there exists a set of operators A_1(f),\\\\ldots ,A_n(f) which, together with their adjoints, are defined on a dense subset of the Hilbert state space, containing the vacuum. The fields A are operator-valued tempered distributions. The Hilbert state space is spanned by the field polynomials acting on the vacuum (cyclicity condition). =W2 (transformation law of the field)= The fields are covariant under the action of Poincar√© group, and they transform according to some representation S of the Lorentz group, or SL(2,C) if the spin is not integer: :U(a,L)^{\\\\dagger}A(x)U(a,L)=S(L)A(L^{-1}(x-a)). =W3 (local commutativity or microscopic causality)= If the supports of two fields are space-like separated, then the fields either commute or anticommute. Cyclicity of a vacuum, and uniqueness of a vacuum are sometimes considered separately. Also, there is property of asymptotic completeness ‚Äì that Hilbert state space is spanned by the asymptotic spaces H^\\\\text{in} and H^\\\\text{out}, appearing in the collision S matrix. The other important property of field theory is mass gap which is not required by the axioms ‚Äì that energy-momentum spectrum has a gap between zero and some positive number. Consequences of the axioms From these axioms, certain general theorems follow: * CPT theorem ‚Äî there is general symmetry under change of parity, particle-antiparticle reversal and time inversion (none of these symmetries alone exists in nature, as it turns out) * Connection between spin and statistic ‚Äî fields which transform according to half integer spin anticommute, while those with integer spin commute (axiom W3) There are actually technical fine details to this theorem. This can be patched up using Klein transformations. See parastatistics. See also the ghosts in BRST. * The impossibility of superluminal communication ‚Äì if two observers are spacelike separated, then the actions of one observer (including both measurements and changes to the Hamiltonian) do not affect the measurement statistics of the other observer. Arthur Wightman showed that the vacuum expectation value distributions, satisfying certain set of properties which follow from the axioms, are sufficient to reconstruct the field theory ‚Äî Wightman reconstruction theorem, including the existence of a vacuum state; he did not find the condition on the vacuum expectation values guaranteeing the uniqueness of the vacuum; this condition, the cluster property, was found later by Res Jost, Klaus Hepp, David Ruelle and Othmar Steinmann. If the theory has a mass gap, i.e. there are no masses between 0 and some constant greater than zero, then vacuum expectation distributions are asymptotically independent in distant regions. Haag's theorem says that there can be no interaction picture ‚Äî that we cannot use the Fock space of noninteracting particles as a Hilbert space ‚Äî in the sense that we would identify Hilbert spaces via field polynomials acting on a vacuum at a certain time. Relation to other frameworks and concepts in quantum field theory The Wightman framework does not cover infinite energy states like finite temperature states. Unlike local quantum field theory, the Wightman axioms restrict the causal structure of the theory explicitly by imposing either commutativity or anticommutativity between spacelike separated fields, instead of deriving the causal structure as a theorem. If one considers a generalization of the Wightman axioms to dimensions other than 4, this (anti)commutativity postulate rules out anyons and braid statistics in lower dimensions. The Wightman postulate of a unique vacuum state doesn't necessarily make the Wightman axioms inappropriate for the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking because we can always restrict ourselves to a superselection sector. The cyclicity of the vacuum demanded by the Wightman axioms means that they describe only the superselection sector of the vacuum; again, that is not a great loss of generality. However, this assumption does leave out finite energy states like solitons which can't be generated by a polynomial of fields smeared by test functions because a soliton, at least from a field theoretic perspective, is a global structure involving topological boundary conditions at infinity. The Wightman framework does not cover effective field theories because there is no limit as to how small the support of a test function can be. I.e., there is no cutoff scale. The Wightman framework also does not cover gauge theories. Even in Abelian gauge theories conventional approaches start off with a \\"Hilbert space\\" with an indefinite norm (hence not truly a Hilbert space, which requires a positive-definite norm, but physicists call it a Hilbert space nonetheless) and the physical states and physical operators belong to a cohomology. This obviously is not covered anywhere in the Wightman framework. (However, as shown by Schwinger, Christ and Lee, Gribov, Zwanziger, Van Baal, etc., canonical quantization of gauge theories in Coulomb gauge is possible with an ordinary Hilbert space, and this might be the way to make them fall under the applicability of the axiom systematics.) The Wightman axioms can be rephrased in terms of a state called a Wightman functional on a Borchers algebra equal to the tensor algebra of a space of test functions. Existence of theories which satisfy the axioms One can generalize the Wightman axioms to dimensions other than 4. In dimension 2 and 3, interacting (i.e. non-free) theories which satisfy the axioms have been constructed. Currently, there is no proof that the Wightman axioms can be satisfied for interacting theories in dimension 4. In particular, the Standard model of particle physics has no mathematically rigorous foundations. There is a million dollar prize for a proof that the Wightman axioms can be satisfied for gauge theories, with the additional requirement of a mass gap. =Osterwalder‚ÄìSchrader reconstruction theorem= Under certain technical assumptions, it has been shown that a Euclidean QFT can be Wick-rotated into a Wightman QFT. See Osterwalder‚ÄìSchrader theorem. This theorem is the key tool for the constructions of interacting theories in dimension 2 and 3 which satisfy the Wightman axioms.

Somerset Maugham. The film starred Madeleine Carroll, Peter Lorre, John Gielgud, and Robert Young. Future star Michael Redgrave made a brief, uncredited appearance; he would play the male lead in Hitchcock's The Lady Vanishes (1938). The work was also Michael Rennie's film debut (though an uncredited one). Typical Hitchcockian themes used in Secret Agent include mistaken identity and murder. Plot On 10 May 1916, during World War I, British Captain and novelist Edgar Brodie (Gielgud) returns home on leave, only to discover his obituary in the newspaper. He is brought to a man identifying himself only as \\"R\\", who asks him to undertake a secret mission: to identify and eliminate a German agent on his way to Arabia to stir up trouble in the Middle East. Upon agreeing, Brodie is given a new identity (Richard Ashenden), a fake death, and the assistance of a killer known variously as \\"the Hairless Mexican\\" and \\"the General\\" (Lorre), though he's not bald, Mexican or a general. Brodie's late \\"predecessor\\" thought that the enemy agent was staying at the Hotel Excelsior in neutral Switzerland. When \\"Ashenden\\" arrives there, he is surprised to find that \\"R\\" has also provided him with an attractive wife, Elsa Carrington (Carroll). Entering their suite, he also encounters her new admirer, fellow hotel guest Robert Marvin (Young), who is only slightly deterred by the arrival of her husband (and continues to flirt with Elsa for much of the film). When they are alone, Ashenden is displeased when Elsa reveals she insisted upon the assignment for the thrill of it. Ashenden and the General go to contact a double agent, the church organist, only to find him dead. In his hand, however, they find a button, evidently torn off in the struggle. When they go to the casino to meet Elsa, the button is accidentally dropped onto a gambling table. Since it looks the same as his own buttons, an experienced mountaineer named Caypor assumes it is his. The agents persuade Caypor to help them settle a concocted bet: which one of them can climb higher on a nearby mountain. As the moment approaches, Ashenden finds he is unable to commit cold-blooded murder, but the General has no such qualms and pushes the unsuspecting Caypor off a cliff. However, a coded telegram informs them that Caypor is not their target. The General finds it very funny, but Elsa becomes terribly distraught when they are told. She decides to quit, despite having told Ashenden that she fell in love with him at first sight. In the lobby, she encounters Marvin. With no destination in mind, she persuades him to take her along with him. Meanwhile, the other two bribe a worker at a chocolate factory (the secret \\"German spy post office\\") to show them a very important message received the day before. They discover that it is addressed to none other than Marvin. They set out in pursuit, taking the same train as Marvin and Elsa. Before they can arrange anything, the train crosses the border into Turkey ‚Äì enemy territory ‚Äì and a large number of soldiers board. Despite this, they manage to get Marvin alone in his compartment. Objecting to cold-blooded murder, Elsa draws a pistol. Before Ashenden can do anything, one way or the other, the train is attacked and derailed by airplanes sent by \\"R\\". Marvin is pinned in the wreckage, but manages to shoot the General fatally before dying. The \\"Ashendens\\" quit the spy business.

R. Crisler of The New York Times disliked the film, praising Peter Lorre for his performance as \\"one of the most amusing and somehow one of the most wistfully appealing trigger men since Victor Moore,\\" but criticizing technical aspects such as \\"inexpert camera technique\\" and \\"strangely uneven sound recording.\\" He also thought Madeleine Carroll was a \\"waste\\" in her role. Variety called the film \\"good spy entertainment,\\" adding that Hitchcock had \\"done well at blending the tale's grim theme with deftly fashioned humor, appropriate romantic interplay and some swell outdoor photography.\\" Harrison's Reports declared it \\"A pretty good espionage melodrama.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker called it a \\"good picture,\\" adding, \\"'The 39 Steps' was a first-rate English thriller, you may know, and the bright, quick fresh touch that made it good isn't lacking here.\\" The Monthly Film Bulletin praised the \\"technical quality\\" of the film and called the acting \\"good,\\" but thought that the ending was \\"brief and not very satisfactory\\" and that it was \\"often difficult to know quite what [Hitchcock] is getting at, whether he is making a profound protest against war and senseless murder or just presenting simple melodrama.\\" Writing for The Spectator in 1936, Graham Greene gave the film a poor review, characterizing it as a despoilment of Maugham's Ashenden and dismissing it as \\"a series of small 'amusing' melodramatic situations\\". According to Greene, these \\"melodramatic situations\\" are built perfunctorily \\"paying no attention on the way to inconsistencies, loose ends, psychological absurdities[,] and then drop[ped:] they mean nothing: they lead to nothing\\". Greene jokes that the element of humour may have at least livened the film with laughter. (reprinted in: ) The film was voted the fifth best British film of 1936. It currently has a 90% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with Geoff Andrew of Time Out writing, \\"This thriller may not be one of Hitchcock's best English films, but it is full of startling set pieces and quirky characterisation\\".

This transformation is also used to find solutions to problems in quantum mechanics and other areas. Overview Wick rotation is motivated by the observation that the Minkowski metric in natural units (with metric signature convention) :ds^2 = -\\\\left(dt^2\\\\right) + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 and the four-dimensional Euclidean metric :ds^2 = d\\\\tau^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 are equivalent if one permits the coordinate to take on imaginary values. The Minkowski metric becomes Euclidean when is restricted to the imaginary axis, and vice versa. Taking a problem expressed in Minkowski space with coordinates , and substituting sometimes yields a problem in real Euclidean coordinates which is easier to solve. This solution may then, under reverse substitution, yield a solution to the original problem. Statistical and quantum mechanics Wick rotation connects statistical mechanics to quantum mechanics by replacing inverse temperature 1/(k_\\\\text{B} T) with imaginary time it/\\\\hbar. Consider a large collection of harmonic oscillators at temperature . The relative probability of finding any given oscillator with energy is \\\\exp(-E/k_\\\\text{B} T), where is Boltzmann's constant. The average value of an observable is, up to a normalizing constant, :\\\\sum_j Q_j e^{-\\\\frac{E_j}{k_\\\\text{B} T}}, where the runs over all states, Q_j is the value of in the th state, and E_j is the energy of the th state. Now consider a single quantum harmonic oscillator in a superposition of basis states, evolving for a time under a Hamiltonian . The relative phase change of the basis state with energy is \\\\exp(-E it/ \\\\hbar), where \\\\hbar is reduced Planck's constant. The probability amplitude that a uniform (equally weighted) superposition of states :\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_j j\\\\rangle evolves to an arbitrary superposition :Q\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_j Q_j j\\\\rangle is, up to a normalizing constant, : \\\\left\\\\langle Q \\\\left e^{-\\\\frac{iHt}{\\\\hbar}} \\\\right \\\\psi \\\\right\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_j Q_j e^{-\\\\frac{E_j it}{\\\\hbar}}\\\\langle jj\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_j Q_j e^{-\\\\frac{E_j it}{\\\\hbar}}. Statics and dynamics Wick rotation relates statics problems in dimensions to dynamics problems in dimensions, trading one dimension of space for one dimension of time. A simple example where is a hanging spring with fixed endpoints in a gravitational field. The shape of the spring is a curve . The spring is in equilibrium when the energy associated with this curve is at a critical point (an extremum); this critical point is typically a minimum, so this idea is usually called \\"the principle of least energy\\". To compute the energy we integrate the energy spatial density over space, :E = \\\\int_x \\\\left[ k \\\\left(\\\\frac{dy(x)}{dx}\\\\right)^2 + V(y(x)) \\\\right] dx, where is the spring constant and is the gravitational potential. The corresponding dynamics problem is that of a rock thrown upwards. The path the rock follows is that which extremalizes the action; as before, this extremum is typically a minimum, so this is called the \\"principle of least action\\". Action is the time integral of the Lagrangian, :S = \\\\int_t \\\\left[ m \\\\left(\\\\frac{dy(t)}{dt}\\\\right)^2 - V(y(t)) \\\\right] dt We get the solution to the dynamics problem (up to a factor of ) from the statics problem by Wick rotation, replacing by and the spring constant by the mass of the rock : :iS = \\\\int_t \\\\left[ m \\\\left(\\\\frac{dy(it)}{dt}\\\\right)^2 + V(y(it)) \\\\right] dt = i \\\\int_t \\\\left[ m \\\\left(\\\\frac{dy(it)}{dit}\\\\right)^2 - V(y(it)) \\\\right] d(it) Both thermal/quantum and static/dynamic Taken together, the previous two examples show how the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics is related to statistical mechanics. From statistical mechanics, the shape of each spring in a collection at temperature will deviate from the least-energy shape due to thermal fluctuations; the probability of finding a spring with a given shape decreases exponentially with the energy difference from the least- energy shape. Similarly, a quantum particle moving in a potential can be described by a superposition of paths, each with a phase : the thermal variations in the shape across the collection have turned into quantum uncertainty in the path of the quantum particle. Further details The Schr√∂dinger equation and the heat equation are also related by Wick rotation. However, there is a slight difference. Statistical mechanics -point functions satisfy positivity whereas Wick-rotated quantum field theories satisfy reflection positivity. Wick rotation is called a rotation because when we represent complex numbers as a plane, the multiplication of a complex number by is equivalent to rotating the vector representing that number by an angle of about the origin. Wick rotation also relates a QFT at a finite inverse temperature to a statistical mechanical model over the \\"tube\\" with the imaginary time coordinate being periodic with period . Note, however, that the Wick rotation cannot be viewed as a rotation on a complex vector space that is equipped with the conventional norm and metric induced by the inner product, as in this case the rotation would cancel out and have no effect.

Dunstable, Berkhamsted and Tring are nearby. The Beacon lies within the Ashridge Estate and is managed and owned by the National Trust. It is the starting point of the Icknield Way to the east, and the Ridgeway long-distance path to the west. Flying model gliders at Ivinghoe Beacon Ivinghoe Beacon is a popular spot for walkers and sightseers. Model aircraft enthusiasts also use lift generated by the wind blowing up the hill to fly their unpowered aircraft ‚Äì a technique known as slope soaring. Those wishing to participate in model flying at the Beacon should review and comply with the agreement between the National Trust and the Ivinghoe Soaring Association. History The hill is an ancient signal point, which was used in times of crisis to send messages across long distances. It is also the site of an early Iron Age hill fort. Archaeological evidence has revealed human activity dating back to the Bronze Age, and the area contains many Scheduled Ancient Monuments, including a number of Bronze Age burial mounds and the faint remains of an Iron Age hill fort at the top of the hill. There also exists evidence of ancient farming as the Beacon is also crossed by deep channels which are thought to be cattle drovers' paths and cross-ridge dykes. The prehistoric earthwork, Grim's Ditch passes to the south of the Beacon at Incombe Hole. Nature Ivinghoe Beacon is part of the Ivinghoe Hills Site of Special Scientific Interest and this area forms part of the Chilterns Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The chalk grassland supports a range of wildlife. A number of wild flower species grow on the Beacon such as rare types of wild orchid and pasque-flower, and these support endangered butterfly species such as the Duke of Burgundy. Filming location Ivinghoe Beacon's appearance of remoteness, yet relative proximity to the film studios at Elstree and Leavesden, has made it a popular choice as a filming location. It has been used as a location for many dramas, especially those produced by ITC in the 1960s.

He ruled the Sultanate during the time of the First Crusade and thus faced the attack. He also re-established the Sultanate of Rum after the death of Malik Shah I of Great Seljuq and defeated the Crusaders in three battles during the Crusade of 1101. Kilij Arslan was the first Muslim commander to fight against the Crusaders, commanding his horse archers while a teenager. Rise to power After the death of his father, Suleyman, in 1086, he became a hostage of Sultan Malik Shah I of Great Seljuq in Isfahan, but was released when Malik Shah died in 1092 in the wake of a quarrel among his jailers. Kilij Arslan then marched at the head of the Turkish Oghuz Yiva tribe army and set up his capital at Nicaea, replacing Amin 'l Ghazni, the governor appointed by Malik Shah I. Following the death of Malik Shah I the individual tribes, the Danishmends, Mangujekids, Saltuqids, Tengribirmish begs, Artuqids (Ortoqids) and Akhlat-Shahs, had started vying with each other to establish their own independent states. Alexius Comnenus's Byzantine intrigues further complicated the situation. He married Ay≈üe Hatun, the daughter of the Emir Tzachas to attempt to ally himself against the Byzantines, who commanded a strong naval fleet. They had four sons: Malik Shah, Mesud I, Arab and Toghrul. In 1094, Kilij Arslan received a letter from Alexius suggesting that the Tzachas sought to target him to move onto the Byzantines, thereupon Kilij Arslan marched with an army to Smyrna, Tzachas's capital, and invited his father-in-law to a banquet in his tent where he slew him while he was intoxicated. The Crusades =People's Crusade= The People's Crusade (also called the Peasants' Crusade) army of Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless arrived at Nicaea in 1096. A German contingent of the crusade overran the castle Xerigordon and held it until Kilij sent a force to starve them out. Those that renounced Christianity were spared and sent into captivity to the east, the rest were slaughtered. Kilij Arslan also cunningly sent spies to trick the Crusaders into thinking Xerigordon was ripe for the taking, and the ill- disciplined Crusaders rushed to Xerigordon despite orders against this. They were consequently ambushed, forcing Peter the Hermit to eventually give up the crusade. The remainder of Peter's crusade was surprised near the village of Civetot by Kilij Arslan's army. They were easily defeated and around 17,000 out of the 20,000 remaining Christian's died. He then invaded the Danishmend Emirate of Malik Ghazi in eastern Anatolia. The First Crusade would start a few months later. =First Crusade= Because of this easy first victory he did not consider the main crusader army, led by various nobles of western Europe, to be a serious threat. He resumed his war with the Danishmends, and was away from Nicaea when these new Crusaders besieged Nicaea in May 1097. He hurried back to his capital to find it surrounded by the Crusaders, and was defeated in battle with them on May 21. The city then surrendered to the Byzantines and his wife and children were captured. When the crusaders sent the Sultan to Constantinople, to their dismay she was later returned without ransom in 1097 because of the relationship between Kilij Arslan and Alexius Comnenus. As result of the stronger invasion, Rum and the Danismends allied in their attempt to turn back the crusaders. The Crusaders continued to split their forces as they marched across Anatolia. The combined Danishmend and Rum forces planned to ambush the Crusaders near Dorylaeum on June 29. However, Kilij Arslan's horse archers could not penetrate the line of defense set up by the Crusader knights, and the main body under Bohemond arrived to capture the Turkish camp on July 1. Kilij Arslan retreated and inflicted losses on the Crusader Army with guerilla warfare and hit-and-run tactics. He also destroyed crops and water supplies along their route in order to damage logistical supplying of the Crusader Army. :See also: Siege of Nicaea, Battle of Dorylaeum =Crusade of 1101= Crusade of 1101 Gazi G√ºm√ºshtigin captured Bohemond resulting in a new force of Lombards attempting to rescue him. In their march they took Ankara from Arslan upon the Danishmends. In alliance with Radwan the Atabeg of Aleppo he ambushed this force at the Battle of Mersivan. In 1101 he defeated another Crusader army at Heraclea Cybistra, which had come to assist the fledgling Crusader States in Syria. This was an important victory for the Turks, as it proved that an army of Crusader knights was not invincible. After this victory he moved his capital to Konya and defeated a force led by William II of Nevers who attempted to march upon it as well as the subsequent force a week later. In 1104 he resumed once more his war with the Danishmends who were now weakened after the death of Malik Ghazi, demanding half the ransom gained for Bohemond. As a result, Bohemond allied with the Danishmends against Rum and the Byzantines. War and death in Syria After the crusades he moved towards the east taking Harran, and Diyarbakr. In 1107 he conquered Mosul, but he was defeated by Mehmed I of Great Seljuq supported by Ilghazi of the Ortoqids and Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan of Aleppo at the battle of Khabur river. Having lost the battle, Kilij Arslan died trying to escape across the river.

In 1870 Train made the first of three widely publicized trips around the globe. He believed that a report of his first journey in a French periodical inspired Jules Verne's novel Around the World in Eighty Days and the protagonist Phileas Fogg may partially be modeled on him. In 1872, he ran for president of the United States as an independent candidate. That year, he was jailed on obscenity charges while defending Victoria Woodhull against charges regarding a report her newspaper had published on an alleged adulterous affair. Despite his many business successes in early life, he was known as an increasingly eccentric figure in American and Australian history. Early life and education George Francis Train was born on March 24, 1829 in Boston, son of Oliver Train and his wife Maria Pickering. He had a cousin Adeline, who later became a noted author. His parents and three sisters died in a yellow fever epidemic in New Orleans in 1833 when George was four. He was raised by his strict Methodist grandparents in Boston. They hoped George would become a minister. He attended common schools, where he acquired knowledge about different countries, got exposed to logical ways of thinking, and honed his mechanical engineering skills using toy blocks and sticks. His best friend in school had immigrated from England, and related to Train how difficult it was to get around in his hometown, Birkenhead. This is what inspired Train to set up a tramway system in the same town. He did not go into the ministry as he sought more adventure in his life. Career Train entered the mercantile business in Boston, and made it his career all his life in the United States and in Australia. He initiated numerous new businesses, building the corporate and financial structures to make them work. In 1860 he went to England to found horse tramway companies in Birkenhead and London, where he soon met opposition. He was also involved in the construction of a short-lived horse tramway in Cork, Ireland.Walter McGrath, Tram Tracks Through Cork, Tower Books, Cork, 1981 Although his trams were popular with passengers, his designs had rails that stood above the road surface and obstructed other traffic. In 1861 Train was arrested and tried for \\"breaking and injuring\\" Uxbridge Road in London.\\"Police News,\\" The Times, March 27, 1861 He tried again with the Darlington Street Railroad Company in 1862, but it was short-lived and closed in 1865. Train was involved in the formation of the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) in 1864 during the American Civil War. The federal government chartered the railroad for construction of the portion of the Transcontinental Railroad west of the Missouri River. Train was involved in setting up the shadow finance company for the project, the Cr√©dit Mobilier of America, whose principal officers were the same as those of UP. (See below) That year, he left the United States for England. Referring to himself as \\"Citizen Train\\", Train became a shipping magnate, a prolific writer, a minor presidential candidate after return to the United States, and a confidant of French and Australian revolutionaries. He claimed to have been offered the presidency of a proposed Australian republic, but declined. During the American Civil War, he gave numerous speeches in England in favor of the Union and denounced the Confederacy. In 1868 Train was arrested while aboard the RMS Scotia in the port of Queenstown (now Cobh) in Ireland, \\"Arrest of George Francis Train\\". Daily Southern Cross 31 March 1868 and held in custody. He had in his possession a bundle of papers containing many speeches he had given in the United States in defense of the Fenian cause of Irish independence. These documents were seized by a local magistrate. His release four days after his arrest was on condition that he disavowed any intention of promoting Fenianism while in Ireland or England. In the middle of his campaign for president in 1870, Train decided to make a trip around the globe, which was covered by many newspapers. The actual traveling took 80 days, though he stayed two months in France, supporting the Paris Commune for which he spent two weeks in jail (the US government and Alexandre Dumas intervened to get him released).George Francis Train, The Bostonian Who Really Was Phileas Fogg at the New England Historical Society. His exploits possibly inspired Jules Verne's novel Around the World in Eighty Days. His protagonist Phileas Fogg is believed to have been partially modeled on Train. While in Europe after his 1870 trip, Train met with the Grand Duke Constantine. During that period, he persuaded the queen of Spain to back the construction of a railway in the backwoods of Pennsylvania; her support provided funding for the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad. He promoted and built tramways in Britain after some opposition. He overcame this by agreeing to run the rails level with the streets.\\"Street Tramways,\\" The Times, May 26, 1869 On his return to the U.S., Train's popularity and reputation soared. He began promoting the Union Pacific Railroad, with which he had been involved for several years, despite the advice of Vanderbilt, who told him it would never work. Forming a finance company called Credit Foncier of America, Train made a fortune from real estate when the transcontinental railway opened up settlement and development of huge swathes of western America, including large amounts of land in Council Bluffs, Iowa; Omaha, Nebraska; and Columbus, Nebraska. He was responsible for building the Cozzens Hotel and founding Train Town in pioneer Omaha. Train was noted for having created the Cr√©dit Mobilier in 1864, which he started specifically to finance the Union Pacific. While appearing to be a separate, independent company which Union Pacific hired, Cr√©dit Mobilier was staffed by the same officers as the railroad. Train and others created a structure that allowed them to realize outsize profits during the construction of the railroad. The story about the scam and congressional graft was broken in 1872 by The Sun, a New York newspaper opposed to the re-election of Ulysses S. Grant for president. Eventually the scandals resulted in congressional and executive federal investigations which implicated numerous congressmen, including James Garfield.McCague, J. (1964) Moguls and Iron Men: The Story of the First Transcontinental Railroad. Harper and Row. p 135. Denying the charges, Garfield was elected as president. In 1872, Train ran for president of the United States as an independent candidate. He was a staunch supporter of the temperance movement. That year, he was jailed on obscenity charges while defending Victoria Woodhull for her newspaper's reporting the alleged affair of Henry Ward Beecher and Elizabeth Tilton, each of whom were married to other people. He was the primary financier of the newspaper The Revolution, which was dedicated to women's rights, and published by Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Later years As he aged, Train was considered to become more eccentric. In 1873, he was arrested and threatened with being sent to an insane asylum. He stood for the position of dictator of the United States, charged admission fees to his campaign rallies, and drew record crowds. He became a vegetarian and adopted various fads. Instead of shaking hands with other people, he shook hands with himself, the manner of greeting he had seen in China. He spent his final days on park benches in New York City's Madison Square Park, handing out dimes and refusing to speak to anyone but children and animals. In 1890, Nellie Bly traveled around the world in 72 days, instigating Train to do a second circumnavigation of the earth in the same year. He completed the trip from Tacoma, Washington and back in 67 days 12 hours and 1 minute, a world record at the time. A plaque in Tacoma commemorates the point at which his 1890 trip began and ended. Train was accompanied on many of his travels by George Pickering Bemis, his cousin and private secretary. Bemis later was elected as mayor of Omaha, Nebraska. In 1892, the town of Whatcom, Washington offered to finance yet another trip around the world in order to publicize itself. Train finished this trip in a record 60 days. He became ill with smallpox while visiting his daughter Susan M. Train Gulager in Stamford, Connecticut in 1903. On January 5, 1904, Train died of heart failure in New York. At the time of his death, he was living in a cheap lodging house named the Mills Hotel. He was buried at a small private ceremony at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. After his death The Thirteen Club, of which he was a member, passed a resolution that he was one of the few sane men in \\"a mad, mad world.\\" Marriage and family Train married Wilhelmina Wilkinson Davis in 1851, with whom he had four children, including daughter Susan M.

Recently, SCA has been caught in the crossfire as Greenpeace exposed its role in \\"wiping away\\" the Great Northern Forest and thereby its contribution to Global warming. History SCA was founded by Ivar Kreuger in November 27, 1929 as a holding company for ten Swedish forest industry companies. Following Kreuger's bankruptcy in 1932, the company came to be controlled by the bank Handelsbanken, who along with associated funds and companies continue to control SCA. Axel Gustaf Torbj√∂rn Enstr√∂m was the managing director from 1950 to 1960 and chairman of the board from 1960 to 1965. In 1975 SCA acquired M√∂lnlycke Health Care, a leading western European producer of disposable hygiene products, and in 1990 SCA acquired transport packaging company Reedpack. In 1995 the Germany-based paper and packaging company PWA was acquired. In 2001 the division Wisconsin Tissue of the United States company Georgia-Pacific Tissue was acquired. In 2004 SCA acquired the tissue and hygiene products businesses of Carter Holt Harvey from International Paper. In 2007, SCA bought the European business of Procter & Gamble, significantly expanding its hygiene product business. In 2008 SCA increases ownership in Chinese tissue company Vinda.

This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and to retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are found only in China, Japan, and southeast Asia. The Heptathelidae were once considered their own family; today they are considered a subfamily of the Liphistiidae. Description Members of Mesothelae have paraxial chelicerae, two pairs of coxal glands on the legs, eight eyes grouped on a nodule, two pairs of book lungs, and no endites on the base of the pedipalp. Most have at least seven or eight spinnerets near the middle of the abdomen. Lateral spinnerets are multi-segmented. Recent Mesothelae are characterized by the narrow sternum on the ventral side of the prosoma. Several plesiomorphic characteristics may be useful in recognizing these spiders: there are tergite plates on the dorsal side and the almost median position of the spinnerets on the ventral side of the opisthosoma. Although it has been claimed that they lack venom glands and ducts, which almost all other spiders have, subsequent works have demonstrated that at least some, possibly all, do in fact have both the glands and ducts. All Mesothelae have eight spinnerets in four pairs. Like mygalomorph spiders, they have two pairs of book lungs. Unlike all other extant mesothelians, heptathelines do not have fishing lines in front of the entrances to the burrows that they construct, making them more difficult to find. They also have a paired receptaculum (unpaired in other liphistiids), and have a conductor in their palpal organ. These long palps can confusingly look like an extra pair of legs, a mistake also made of some solifugids. Taxonomy Reginald Innes Pocock in 1892 was the first to realize that the exceptional characters of the genus Liphistius (the only member of the group then known) meant that it was more different from the remaining spiders than they were among themselves. Accordingly, he proposed dividing spiders into two subgroups, Mesothelae for Liphistius, and Opisthothelae for all other spiders. The names refer to the position of the spinning organs, which are in the middle of the abdomen in Liphistius and nearer the end in all other spiders. In Greek, ŒºŒ≠œÉŒøœÇ (mesos) means \\"middle\\", and Œ∏ŒÆŒªŒ± (thƒìla) \\"teat\\". =Phylogeny and classification= Pocock divided his Opisthothelae into two groups, which he called Mygalomorphae and Arachnomorphae (now Araneomorphae), implicitly adopting the phylogeny shown below. Pocock's approach was criticized by other arachnologists. Thus in 1923, Petrunkevitch rejected grouping mygalomorphs and araneomorphs into Opisthothelae, treating Liphistiomorphae (i.e. Mesothelae), Mygalomorphae and Arachnomorphae (Araneomorphae) as three separate groups. Others, such as Bristowe in 1933, put Liphistiomorphae and Mygalomorphae into one group, called Orthognatha, with Araneomorphae as Labidognatha: In 1976, Platnick and Gertsch argued for a return to Pocock's classification, drawing on morphological evidence. Subsequent phylogenetic studies based on molecular data have vindicated this view. The accepted classification of spiders is now: Order Araneae (spiders) :Suborder Mesothelae Pocock, 1892 :Suborder Opisthothelae Pocock, 1892 ::Infraorder Mygalomorphae Pocock, 1892 ::Infraorder Araneomorphae Smith, 1902 (syn. Arachnomorphae Pocock, 1892) Distribution Liphistiinae spiders are distributed in Myanmar, Thailand, the Malayan peninsula, and Sumatra. Heptathelinae are found in Vietnam, the Eastern provinces of China, and Southern Japan. Fossils A number of families and genera of fossil arthropods have been assigned to the Mesothelae, particularly by Alexander Petrunkevitch. However, Paul A. Selden has shown that most only have \\"the general appearance of spiders\\", with segmented abdomens (opisthosomae), but no definite spinnerets. These families include: * ‚Ä†Arthrolycosidae Friƒç, 1904 * ‚Ä†Arthromygalidae Petrunkevitch, 1923 * ‚Ä†Pyritaraneidae Petrunkevitch, 1953 * ‚Ä†Palaeothele Selden, 2000 (unplaced in a family) Between 2015 and 2019 six genera of Mesothele spider in four families were described from Cenomanian aged Burmese Amber in Myanmar.

It was produced by the Californian company Calgene, and submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1992. On May 18, 1994, the FDA completed its evaluation of the Flavr Savr tomato and the use of APH(3')II, concluding that the tomato \\"is as safe as tomatoes bred by conventional means\\" and \\"that the use of aminoglycoside 3'-phosphotransferase II is safe for use as a processing aid in the development of new varieties of tomato, rapeseed oil, and cotton intended for food use.\\" It was first sold in 1994, and was only available for a few years before production ceased in 1997.Weasel, Lisa H. 2009. Food Fray. Amacom Publishing Calgene made history, but mounting costs prevented the company from becoming profitable, and it was eventually acquired by Monsanto Company.  Characteristics  Tomatoes have a short shelf-life in which they remain firm and ripe. This lifetime may be shorter than the time needed for them to reach market when shipped from winter growing areas to markets in the north, and the softening process can also lead to more of the fruit being damaged during transit. To address this, tomatoes intended for shipping are often picked while they are unripe, or \\"green\\", and then prompted to ripen just before delivery through the use of ethylene gas which acts as a plant hormone. The downside to this approach is that the tomato does not complete its natural growing process, and the final flavor suffers as a result. Through genetic engineering, Calgene hoped to slow down the ripening process of the tomato and thus prevent it from softening, while still allowing the tomato to retain its natural colour and flavour. This would allow it to fully ripen on the vine and still be shipped long distances without it going soft. The Flavr Savr was made more resistant to rotting by adding an antisense gene which interferes with the production of the enzyme Beta polygalacturonase. The enzyme normally degrades pectin in the cell walls and results in the softening of fruit which makes them more susceptible to being damaged by fungal infections. Flavr Savr turned out to disappoint researchers in that respect, as the antisensed PG gene had a positive effect on shelf life, but not on the fruit's firmness, so the tomatoes still had to be harvested like any other unmodified vine-ripe tomatoes.Martineau, Belinda. 2001. First Fruit: The Creation of the Flavr Savr Tomato and the Birth of Biotech Food. McGraw-Hill. An improved flavor, later achieved through traditional breeding of Flavr Savr and better tasting varieties, would also contribute to selling Flavr Savr at a premium price at the supermarket. The FDA stated that special labeling for these modified tomatoes was not necessary because they have the essential characteristics of non-modified tomatoes. Specifically, there was no evidence for health risks, and the nutritional content was unchanged. The failure of the Flavr Savr has been attributed to Calgene's inexperience in the business of growing and shipping tomatoes.Charles, Dan. 2001. Lords of The Harvest. Perseus Publishing. 144-148.  Tomato paste  In the UK, Zeneca produced a tomato paste that used technology similar to the Flavr Savr. Don Grierson was involved in the research to make the genetically modified tomato. Due to the characteristics of the tomato, it was cheaper to produce than conventional tomato paste, resulting in the product being 20% cheaper. Between 1996 and 1999, 1.8 million cans, clearly labelled as genetically engineered, were sold in the major supermarket chains Sainsbury's and Safeway UK. At one point the paste outsold normal tomato paste but sales fell in the autumn of 1998. The House of Commons of the United Kingdom published a report in which they stated that the decline in sales during this period was linked to changing consumer perceptions of genetically modified crops. The report identified several possible factors, including product labeling and perception of choice, lobbying campaigns, and media attention. It concluded that the tone of media reports on the subject underwent a \\"fundamental shift\\" in response to a high- profile incident in which Dr. Arpad Pusztai, a researcher for Rowett Research Institute, was fired after making a televised claim about detrimental health effects in lab rats fed a diet of genetically modified potatoes (see the Pusztai affair). Subsequent peer review and testimony by Dr. Pusztai led the House Science and Technology Select Committee to conclude that his initial claim was \\"contradicted by his own evidence.\\" In the intervening period, Sainsbury's and Safeway both pledged that none of their house brand products would contain genetically modified ingredients.The case of the FLAVR SAVR tomato G.

In 1971, the Yugoslav authorities suppressed the movement by force. History =Background= The 1960s and 1970s in Croatia were marked by general emancipation from the Stalinist policies employed in Yugoslavia after World War II. Despite significant conservative resistance, the country underwent major reforms, including economic reforms that in 1964/1965 started to introduce a market economy, and the democratization of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia between 1966 and 1969 which led to giving a bigger role to the Leagues of Communists of each individual republic and province. The 1960s also saw the rise of social sciences in the country. Political science and sociology were introduced to universities against the resistance of communist hardliners. After studying abroad, in Western countries, social scientists introduced critical thought to their home universities, which gradually made them centers of opposition thought and criticism of the regime, especially in Ljubljana, Zagreb and Belgrade. After being a target of significant animosity and suppression by the regime in the 1940s and the 1950s, the Catholic Church's status in Croatia also improved as a consequence of the democratization of the country, particularly in the wake of the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì65) and the establishment of diplomatic relations between Vatican and Yugoslavia in 1966. By the mid-1960s, public religious events were permitted again, and the relationship between the Church and the state was that of mutual tolerance. The Catholic Church in Croatia, however, did not take an active role in the national movement and political events associated with it, even if its leadership was privately sympathetic with the reformists. =Political demands= The removal of Aleksandar Rankoviƒá, a strong proponent of a centralized Yugoslavia, in 1966 marked an opening for groups seeking greater devolution. A group of 130 influential Croatian poets and linguists, 80 of whom were Communists, published a Declaration on the Status and Name of the Croatian Standard Language in March 1967. After 1968 the patriotic goals of that document morphed into a generic Croatian movement for more rights for Croatia which received grassroots support, especially amongst many student organizations which actively started to voice their support for the cause. A younger generation of reformer politicians in the republics' Communist Party organizations gave the movement momentum in an effort to overcome the Party monopoly and to expand various civil rights. The right to take pride in one's history was a prominently featured topic. This irritated President Josip Broz Tito's communist government. Among the issues raised was the practice by the Yugoslav People's Army to send people on mandatory military service into other republics rather than leaving them in their home republic. There were also attempts to bring the notion of including Herzegovina into Croatia to the attention of the authorities (similar to the Banovina of Croatia that existed within the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1939 to 1941), but this was far from anything that the movement leaders were proposing. In fact, such red herrings were often used to denounce the demands related to decentralization and autonomy as expansionist and ultimately separatist. =Economic issues= In the early days of the movement, the Croatian political leadership voiced demands for a democratization and decentralization of the economy, which would have allowed the republic to keep more of the profits made within Croatia, as opposed to using the income from tourism and from emigrants to avert economic ruin. The economic problems in Yugoslavia at the time contributed to increased economic emigration, and these economic problems particularly affected Croatia, despite the fact it had been the source of the majority of the income from tourism and that 37% of all Yugoslav emigrant workers had come from Croatia. Croatian economist became known during this period for writing about the how Croatia had failed to profit from the foreign currency that had entered Yugoslavia through Croatia, using a disproportionately small amount of it. An independent National Bank of Croatia would have allowed for a fairer distribution of profits. By waiving the right to use the federal bank of Yugoslavia, the republic would also have to waive its right to use the federal fund for underdeveloped regions. At the 10th session of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Croatia held on 15 January 1970, Savka Dabƒçeviƒá-Kuƒçar presented a quality paper on what she described as petty rhetoric about how Croatia was getting harmed in Yugoslavia. Croatian 1968 GDP per capita was 25% above the national average, among other positive statistics. Croatia used only 16.5% of the money from the federal solidarity fund between 1965 and 1970, while the Yugoslav government used 46.6% mostly for the least developed region Kosovo and Metohija. Concerns were also raised about the monopoly of the Yugoslav Investment Bank and the Bank for Foreign Trade from Belgrade on all foreign investments and trade. Yugoslavia's 1971-75 Five-Year Plan was to be adopted in July 1970 but was postponed due to inter-republic conflict, high inflation and administrative reorganization.Central Intelligence Bulletin, Central Intelligence Agency. 15 October 1970. In the midst of the movement, the Federal Executive Council froze all prices in November 1971 for a four-month period.Central Intelligence Bulletin, Central Intelligence Agency. 29 November 1971. =Public unrest= The movement organized demonstrations in 1971 and thousands of Zagreb students publicly protested. Three Croatian linguists, Stjepan Babiƒá, Bo≈æidar Finka and Milan Mogu≈°, published a spelling and grammar textbook in September 1971 called Hrvatski pravopis (Croatian Orthography), rather than the Srpskohrvatski (Serbo-Croatian). It was summarily banned, and virtually all copies were destroyed. However, a surviving copy found its way to London where it was reprinted and published in 1972. The Yugoslav leadership interpreted the whole affair as a restoration of Croatian nationalism, dismissed the movement as chauvinistic and had the police brutally suppress the demonstrators. In 1971, Soviet Union leadership applied additional pressure on Marshall Tito directly by Leonid Brezhnev and indirectly by its ambassadors to Yugoslavia, to assert control of the Communist party within Yugoslavia, ostensibly adhering to the Brezhnev Doctrine. After the calls to the student strike, in December 1971 Tito persuaded to resign some unreliable, in his view, public figures like Savka Dabƒçeviƒá-Kuƒçar, Miko Tripalo and Dragutin Haramija and make a sweep in Croatian communist party and local administration. According to Tripalo's estimate, two thousand people were criminally prosecuted in Croatia in 1972 and 1973 for participation in these events., cited in Among those arrested at this time were future president of Croatia Franjo Tuƒëman and dissident journalist Bruno Bu≈°iƒá. Others arrested and convicted include student activists Dra≈æen Budi≈°a, , Ante Parad≈æik and Goran Dodig, and Matica hrvatska members Vlado Gotovac, Marko Veselica, ≈†ime ƒêodan, Jozo Iviƒçeviƒá and Hrvoje ≈†o≈°iƒá. In 1972, more than 25,000 people were expelled from the League of Communists of Croatia. The social and political conservative forces engaged in a repression that prevented the final reforms that would have made Yugoslavia a true federation of sovereign republics and provinces, instead reducing both the Yugoslav political concept and its nomenklatura to a kind of \\"real socialism\\" that lacked potential. Aftermath In 1974, a new federal constitution was ratified that gave more autonomy to the individual republics, thereby basically fulfilling some of the goals of the Croatian Spring 1971 movement. The downfall of the Croatian Spring marked the beginning of a period known as the \\"Croatian silence\\" (), in which Croatian politicians refrained from taking a firmer stance in federal politics, aligning themselves with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. This period would last until 1989. Legacy Several student leaders from the Croatian Spring later emerged as influential political figures after the collapse of communism. Franjo Tuƒëman became the first President of Croatia, ≈†ime ƒêodan became a member of parliament and a one time Minister of Defence, Ivan Zvonimir ƒåiƒçak became the leader of the Croatian Helsinki Committee for Human Rights. Dra≈æen Budi≈°a became the leader of the Croatian Social Liberal Party. Savka Dabƒçeviƒá-Kuƒçar, Miko Tripalo, and Dragutin Haramija became founding members of the new Croatian People's Party. The fourth edition of the Babiƒá-Finka-Mogu≈° Hrvatski pravopis is used today as a standard definition of the Croatian language, though other Croatian spelling and grammar manuals have also been published.

The Waitaki dam was built first, without earthmoving machinery, followed by the development of the Aviemore Dam on Lake Aviemore and Benmore Dam on Lake Benmore. Lake Pukaki was initially dammed at this stage to provide storage and flow control. A small station was also installed on Lake Tekapo, but although it has a small dam to raise the pre- existing lake, water was taken through a tunnel to a powerstation below the level of the lake. In the 1960s, work was started on the Upper Waitaki project. This project consisted of taking the discharge from the original Tekapo (A) station through a power canal, the Tekapo Canal, to Tekapo B station at the edge of Lake Pukaki. The dam at Pukaki was increased in height. Water from Pukaki is then transferred into the Pukaki Canal which meets the Ohau Canal from Lake Ohau into Ohau A station and Lake Ruataniwha. The Ohau Canal continues beyond Lake Ruataniwha to Ohau B midway along, before emptying through Ohau C into Lake Benmore.

The stages and films term \\"prop\\", an abbreviation of \\"property\\", refers to any object an actor handles in the course of a performance. Though some form of prop comedy has likely existed as long as there have been comedians, the genre reached its zenith in the vaudeville era. The vaudeville team Olsen and Johnson used prop comedy extensively in their long running Broadway revue Hellzapoppin. A prop comic is a comedian who uses prop comedy. Prop comics are sometimes looked down upon by other comedians, and the term is sometimes used derisively. However, some, such as Tommy Cooper, rose to critical acclaim as their props revolved around a gimmick (such as Cooper's magic) and the comedian's character around that gimmick. Types of props Props are any items that the comedian or comic uses in an absurd way. These can be hand props, such as a book or slapstick, costume props (such as tearaway pants), and set props (such as a breakaway chair). Another example is the rubber chicken. Other occurrences The TV comedy game show Whose Line Is It Anyway? has a round called Props in which two teams of comedians are each given a prop each and must improvise with them to humorous effect.

We'll make ourselves a GNU one.\\" event. GNUnet is a software framework for decentralized, peer-to-peer networking and an official GNU package. The framework offers link encryption, peer discovery, resource allocation, communication over many transports (such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS, WLAN and Bluetooth) and various basic peer-to-peer algorithms for routing, multicast and network size estimation. GNUnet's basic network topology is that of a mesh network. GNUnet includes a distributed hash table (DHT) which is a randomized variant of Kademlia that can still efficiently route in small-world networks. GNUnet offers a \\"F2F topology\\" option for restricting connections to only the users' trusted friends. The users' friends' own friends (and so on) can then indirectly exchange files with the users' computer, never using its IP address directly. GNUnet uses Uniform resource identifiers (not approved by IANA, although an application has been made). GNUnet URIs consist of two major parts: the module and the module specific identifier. A GNUnet URI is of form \`gnunet://module/identifier\` where module is the module name and identifier is a module specific string. The primary codebase is written in C, but there are bindings in other languages to produce an API for developing extensions in those languages. GNUnet is part of the GNU Project. It has gained interest to the hacker community after the PRISM revelations. GNUnet consists of several subsystems, of which essential ones are Transport and Core subsystems. Transport subsystem provides insecure link-layer communications, while Core provides peer discovery and encryption. On top of the core subsystem various applications are built. GNUnet includes various P2P applications in the main distribution of the framework, including filesharing, chat and VPN; additionally, a few external projects (such as secushare) are also extending the GNUnet infrastructure. GNUnet is unrelated to the older Gnutella P2P protocol. Gnutella is not an official GNU project while GNUnet is.  Transport  Originally, GNUnet used UDP for underlying transport. Now GNUnet transport subsystem provides multiple options, such as TCP and SMTP. The communication port, officially registered at IANA, is 2086 (tcp + udp).Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number Registry, p. 37  Trust system  GNUnet provides trust system based on excess-based economic model. The idea of employing economic system is taken from MojoNation network. GNUnet network has no trusted entities so it is impossible to maintain global reputation. Instead, each peer maintains its own trust for each of its local links. When resources, such as bandwidth and CPU time, are in excess, peer provides them to all requesting neighbors without reducing trust or otherwise charging them. When a node is under stress it drops requests from its neighbor nodes having lower internal trust value. However, when peer has less resources than enough to fulfill everyone's requests, it denies requests of those neighbors that it trusts less and charges others by reducing their trust.  File sharing  The primary application at this point is anonymous, censorship-resistant file- sharing, allowing users to anonymously publish or retrieve information of all kinds. The GNUnet protocol which provides anonymity is called GAP (GNUnet anonymity protocol). GNUnet FS can additionally make use of GNU libextractor to automatically annotate shared files with metadata. = File encoding = Files shared with GNUnet are ECRS (An Encoding for Censorship-Resistant Sharing) coded. All content is represented as GBlocks. Each GBlock contains 1024 bytes. There are several types of GBlocks, each of them serves a particular purpose. Any GBlock B is uniquely identified by its RIPEMD-160 hash H(B). DBlocks store actual file contents and nothing else. File is split at 1024 byte boundaries and resulting chunks are stored in DBlocks. DBlocks are linked together into Merkle tree by means of IBlocks that store DBlock identifiers. Blocks are encrypted with a symmetric key derived from H(B) when they are stored in the network. = Queries and replies = GNUnet Anonymity Protocol consists of queries and replies. Depending on load of the forwarding node, messages are forwarded to zero or more nodes. Queries are used to search for content and request data blocks. Query contains resource identifier, reply address, priority and TTL (Time-to-Live). Resource identifier of datum Q is a triple-hash H(H(H(Q))). Peer that replies to query provides H(H(Q))to prove that it indeed has the requested resource without providing H(Q) to intermediate nodes, so intermediate nodes can't decrypt Q. Reply address is the major difference compared to Freenet protocol. While in Freenet reply always propagates back using the same path as the query, in GNUnet the path may be shorter. Peer receiving a query may drop it, forward it without rewriting reply address or indirect it by replacing reply address with its own address. By indirecting queries peer provides cover traffic for its own queries, while by forwarding them peer avoids being a link in reply propagation and preserves its bandwidth. This feature allows the user to trade anonymity for efficiency. User can specify an anonymity level for each publish, search and download operation. An anonymity level of zero can be used to select non-anonymous file-sharing. GNUnet's DHT infrastructure is only used if non-anonymous file-sharing is specified. The anonymity level determines how much cover traffic a peer must have to hide the user's own actions. Priority specifies how much of its trust user wants to spend in case of resource shortage. TTL is used to prevent queries from staying in the network for too long. = File sharing URIs = The fs module identifier consists of either chk, sks, ksk or loc followed by a slash and a category specific value. Most URIs contain hashes, which are encoded in base32hex. * chk identifies files, typically: \`gnunet://fs/chk/[file hash].[query hash].[file size in bytes]\` : File hash is the hash of the plaintext file, which allows decrypting it once it is downloaded. Query hash is the hash of topmost GBlock which allows downloading the whole tree of GBlocks that contain encrypted file. File size is required to determine the shape of the tree. * sks identifies files within namespaces, typically: \`gnunet://fs/sks/NAMESPACE/IDENTIFIER\` * ksk identifies search queries, typically: \`gnunet://fs/ksk/KEYWORD[+KEYWORD]*\` * loc identifies a datum on a specific machine, typically: \`gnunet://fs/loc/PEER/QUERY.TYPE.KEY.SIZE\`  Examples  A type of GNUnet filesharing URI pointing to a specific copy of GNU GPL license text: \` gnunet://fs/chk/9E4MDN4VULE8KJG6U1C8FKH5HA8C5CHSJTILRTTPGK8MJ6VHORERHE68JU8Q0FDTOH1DGLUJ3NLE99N0ML0N9PIBAGKG7MNPBTT6UKG.1I823C58O3LKS24LLI9KB384LH82LGF9GUQRJHACCUINSCQH36SI4NF88CMAET3T3BHI93D4S0M5CC6MVDL1K8GFKVBN69Q6T307U6O.17992\` Another type of GNUnet filesharing URI, pointing to the search results of a search with keyword \\"gpl\\": \` gnunet://fs/ksk/gpl \`  GNU Name System  GNUnet includes an implementation of the GNU Name System (GNS), a decentralized and censorship-resistant replacement for DNS. In GNS, each user manages their own zones and can delegate subdomains to zones managed by other users. Lookups of records defined by other users are performed using GNUnet's DHT.  Protocol translation  GNUnet can tunnel IP traffic over the peer-to- peer network. If necessary, GNUnet can perform IPv4-IPv6 protocol translation in the process. GNUnet provides a DNS Application-level gateway to proxy DNS requests and map addresses to the desired address family as necessary. This way, GNUnet offers a possible technology to facilitate IPv6 transition. Furthermore, in combination with GNS, GNUnet's protocol translation system can be used to access hidden services ‚Äî IP-based services that run locally at some peer in the network and which can only be accessed by resolving a GNS name.

The scalability property is achieved through multicast message delivery, while extensibility is made possible by using PSYC (Protocol for SYnchronous Conferencing), which provides an extensible RPC (Remote Procedure Call) syntax that can evolve over time without having to upgrade the software on all nodes in the network. Another key feature provided by the PSYC layer are stateful multicast channels, which are used to store e.g. user profiles. End-to-end encrypted communication is provided by the mesh service of GNUnet, upon which the multicast channels are built. Pseudonymous users and social places in the system have cryptographical identities ‚Äî identified by their public key ‚Äî these are mapped to human memorable names using GNS (GNU Name System), where each pseudonym has a zone pointing to its places.

N. Trubaƒç√≥v In some South Slavic languages, including Serbo-Croatian and Slovene, the word krajina or its cognate still refers primarily to a border, fringe, or borderland of a country (sometimes with an established military defense), and secondarily to a region, area, or landscape. The word kraj can today mean an end or extremity, or region or area. Archaically extrapolated, it could mean \\"army\\" or \\"war\\"; this meaning developed from the earlier meaning of \\"borderland\\" in a manner analogous to the French word '. The term is equal to German Mark and French marche. In other Slavic languages (including the Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects of Serbo-Croatian), the term has other meanings, either a territorial name (cf. Krajna in Poland, from Old Polish , meaning region, borderland, extremity) or word with meaning \\"a land, landscape\\" (e.g. in Polish, Slovak, Czech or Sorbian).

Like Excel Saga, it is a parody of other anime, manga and various aspects of popular culture, though in this case with the magical girl genre providing its primary focus and general structure. The series was originally an in-joke from an episode of Excel Saga; Watanabe decided to take the in-joke to its most extreme logical conclusion, creating the series. Episodes Puni Puni Poemy was advertised in North America as a successor to Excel Saga. Puni Puni Poemy comprises two episodes, both around 26 minutes in length. * Part 1 - Poemy is in a Bad Mood :The introductory sequence shows Poemy fighting shadowy figures of various other magical girls such as Usagi Tsukino from Sailor Moon, Tickle from Majokko Tickle, Utena from Revolutionary Girl Utena, Megu and Non from Majokko Megu-chan, Sakura Kinomoto from Cardcaptor Sakura, the considered first magical girl in Japanese animation, Sally, from Sally, the Witch and for some reason Mahoro from Mahoromatic despite her not being a magical girl. :At the start of a new school year the over-energetic Poemy Watanabe is introduced, along with her adoptive parents Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi. Poemy rushes to the school to be the first there, at the same time she repeatedly proclaims her desire to become a successful voice actress. At the school, Poemy's best girl friend, Futaba Aasu, is presented as Poemy's biggest supporter and in fact perennially sexually attracted to her. Back from school, Poemy and Futaba realize the horror of finding Poemy's parents and their robot dog crucified by Alien #1, an extraterrestrial assassin with peculiar genitalia. Her home destroyed, Poemy moves in with Futaba and her six sisters. Later, a massive alien robot attacks the city, whereupon it turns out that Futaba and her sisters are actually a secret team of super-powered heroines dedicated to defending the Earth, also known as Sol III. Unfortunately, the Aasu sisters' magic is strictly defensive, so they are unable to defeat the rampaging robot. Meanwhile, Poemy obtains a talking, magic fish that when used as a magic wand transforms her into Puni Puni Poemy, a powerful magical girl. After the typical transformation, however, she promptly throws away her wand, forgoes the use of magic, and attacks the robot with her bare hands. * Part 2 - With a Dream Greater Than Earth :Continuing from the previous scene, the wastefully energetic Poemy uses her new powers to tear through the alien mecha, destroying it. Next, Poemy decides to use her new strength to continue pursuing her career as a voice actress, and right wrongs as she sees them throughout society. However, Poemy appears to do more bad than good, as she harshly punishes citizens for small incidents, and accidentally sends a nuclear missile off-course, completely destroying an entire country. Then, the Aasu sisters finally decide to confront Puni Puni Poemy, and realize she is actually the Poemy Watanabe they have been hosting in their own house. Afterwards, it is revealed that K, the school boy whom Poemy is attracted to, is actually an octopus-like alien, and he will be commanding the following invasion to Earth. Next morning, the invasion proceeds, with a massive Death Star en route to Earth, and with K capturing the Aasu sisters, and subjecting them to hentai-related bondage, as he learned from Japanese animation. In the end, the two alien henchmen are inexplicably revealed to be Poemy's foster parents, Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, who are thus not dead, and Poemy and Futaba combine their powers in order to make the world nice and end the extraterrestrial menace. Characters * : :The star of the show, Poemi Watanabe is 10 years old and hyperactive beyond comparison. Described as \\"wastefully energetic\\", she's an eager student, she's got a crush on K, the popular boy in her class, and she wants to become a voice actress. She normally breaks the fourth wall by referring to herself as \\"Kobayashi\\", which is the last name of her own voice actress, Yumiko Kobayashi. Poemy also breaks the fourth wall by referring to Nabeshin as \\"the Director\\", since Nabeshin is voiced by Shinichi Watanabe himself, the director of the series. :After her adoptive parents, Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, are killed by Alien #1, Poemy moves in with her best friend, Futaba Aasu. Then, when an alien mecha attacks the city, Poemy encounters a mysterious and silent man playing the shamisen, who is apparently her real father, and he gives her a fish, which when gutted and used as a magic wand, allows her to transform into Puni Puni Poemy, a magical girl embodying the will of Earth itself. * Shinichi \\"Nabeshin\\" Watanabe („ÉØ„Çø„Éä„Éô„Ç∑„É≥„Ç§„ÉÅ Watanabe Shin'ichi, „Éä„Éô„Ç∑„É≥ Nabeshin) : :Nabeshin is the animated alter-ego of real-life director Shinichi Watanabe, who previously appeared in Puni Puni Poemy's forerunner, Excel Saga. At the conclusion of that series, he married Kumi-Kumi, and at the beginning of this show, they have adopted ten- year-old Poemy. As in Excel Saga, Nabeshin seems to be constantly hunted down by different enemies, and being the director of these shows, he displays super-human abilities that involve his afro. In this occasion, Nabeshin and his wife are successfully killed by crucifixion, along with their robotic pet dog, by Alien #1. However, near the end of the second part they are inexplicably alive and appear to be the alien henchmen themselves. * Kumi-Kumi („ÇØ„Éü„ÇØ„Éü„Åï„Çì Kumikumi-san) : Voiced by: Satomi Korogi (Japanese, uncredited); Tiffany Grant (English) :Introduced in Excel Saga, Kumi-Kumi was a simple mountain girl who rescued Nabeshin from an avalanche and attempted to feed him soup. But Nabeshin isn't too good with hot foods, so he refused, only to have her pursue him across the rest of the series. He finally relented, marrying her at the end of the final episode. At the start of Puni Puni Poemy, she and Nabeshin now have Poemy as their adopted daughter. Despite being killed by the alien invader along with Nabeshin, Kumi-Kumi apparently saved her husband using acupuncture, and they are both alright at the end of the second part. * K (K„Åè„Çì K-kun) : :K is one of Poemy's classmates, but unfortunately for Poemy, her wild crush on him isn't reciprocated. In the second episode, K discovers that he is an octopus-like alien who had been raised in human form for ten years, and he takes charge of the invasion of the planet, which is focused on ravishing Japanese women, since hentai transmissions have given the aliens the idea that that's what women are really like. K, whose real name is Space Alien Prince, is composed entirely of tentacles as he and his family parody the Mars People from the game series Metal Slug. * Mage Queen (È≠îÈÅìÂ£´„ÅÆÂ•≥Áéã Mad≈ç-shi no jo≈ç) : :A mysterious figure, the precise nature of the Mage Queen is not explained. Initially, her somewhat threatening monologue aboard a space station that oversees Earth seems to count her an enemy. However, she greets the eventual arrival of Puni Puni Poemy with joy and considers the invading aliens a threat. Her reign as queen of the magic is cut short when she is assassinated by Alien #2. Her design is based on the female characters of Leiji Matsumoto. * Alien Henchmen : - Alien 1 : - Alien 2 :These extraterrestrial assassins dress like pimps from the waist up and speak in an undecipherable hipster jargon. Their genitalia look like Bungee Balls that hang down to their knees, and can be used as sort of like whips. Alien #1 has one such testicle, and Alien #2 has two, and no reason for this anatomical difference is given. Early in the first episode, Alien #1 kills Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, and then controls the giant robot that attacks the city. Then, during most of the second episode, he spends his time at the Aasu household completely unnoticed, even joining the girls in the bathtub, until he captures them. Alien #2's main role is in arriving with a giant battleship and attacking the Mage Queen. Ultimately, both alien henchmen are not whom they appear to be, as in a paradox they take off their disguises and reveal to be Nabeshin and Kumi-Kumi, who are alive and well. =The Aasu Sisters= Poemy's classmate, Futaba, is but one of the seven Aasu sisters, protectors of Earth. Aasu is the Japanese transliteration of the English word \\"Earth\\", and each of the girl's names is derived from a number: seven, six, five, and so on. All of the girls have magical powers, but given that these powers are purely defensive in nature, the family is useless as an offensive unit. Additionally to their family name referring to the Earth, aasu is also the Japanese transliteration of the English words \\"arse\\" or \\"ass\\", which is comically exploited in the English dub, such as the character Futaba saying \\"save my Aasus\\" when the sisters are captured. * Nanase Aasu („ÅÇ„ÅÇ„Åô„Å™„Å™„Åõ ƒÄsu Nanase) : :At 28 years old, Nanase is the eldest sister, who works as a data processor in an office. Her power is the Earth Dance of Flowers, the ability to summon a whirlwind of flowers, to absolutely no effect. Her name is derived from nana, the Japanese word for \\"seven\\". * Mutsumi Aasu („ÅÇ„ÅÇ„Åô„ÇÄ„Å§„Åø ƒÄsu Mutsumi) : :Mutsumi is 22 years old, and much to her own surprise speaks with a Kansai accent (in the English language dub a Brooklyn accent is used). She has something of a complex about the small size of her breasts. Her power is the Earth Breakfall, which means she can fall over safely. Her name is derived from mutsu, the Japanese word for \\"six\\". Her short, purple hair, and her white outfit, make her physically similar to the first Ropponmatsu from Excel Saga. * Itsue Aasu („ÅÇ„ÅÇ„Åô„ÅÑ„Å§„Åà ƒÄsu Itsue) : :The 19-year-old Itsue is working her way through high school as a dominatrix, and is prone to using her whip to physically abuse her sisters when she gets angry. Her power, the Earth Barrier Shield, enables her to generate a protective energy field, which she activates while spinning her whip. Her name comes from itsu, the Japanese word for \\"five\\". * Shii Aasu („ÅÇ„ÅÇ„Åô„Åó„ÅÑ ƒÄsu Shƒ´) : :Shii is 18 years old, and her most distinctive feature are her excessively large breasts. She constantly grabs them and announces how heavy they are, but in one occasion she mentioned she would use Poemy's magic to have a flat chest instead. Her special power is Earth Healing, which does no damage. Her name comes from shi, the Japanese word for \\"four\\". Shii has blue hair and resembles Hyatt from Excel Saga, and in fact, both characters have the same voice actresses, Omi Minami and Monica Rial. * Mitsuki Aasu („ÅÇ„ÅÇ„Åô„Åø„Å§„Åç ƒÄsu Mitsuki) : :Cute and energetic, Mitsuki is 15 years old, and seems to play an active role in the running of the Aasu household. Initially, she opposes the idea of letting Poemy stay with them, and later she distrusts Puni Puni Poemy's actions. Her power is Earth Acceleration, enabling her to run at vast speeds. Her name is derived from mittsu, the Japanese word for \\"three\\". With her long ponytail Mitsuki is physically similar to Misaki Matsuya from Excel Saga. * Futaba Aasu („ÅÇ„ÅÇ„Åô„Åµ„Åü„Å∞ ƒÄsu Futaba) : :10-year-old Futaba is Poemy's classmate and best friend, and she is madly in love with her, a fact to which Poemy is oblivious. Futaba's power allows her to pacify hostile creatures, making them happy and harmless. In the final confrontation with the invading aliens, Futaba combines her power with Poemy's, and since Poemy is a representation of Earth, this act pacifies the planet's population, resulting in peace with the aliens. After this event, director Nabeshin casually mentions that Futaba is in reality the main character of the show. Her name comes from futa, the Japanese word for \\"two\\". Futaba is mostly a parody of Tomoyo Daidouji, the best friend of magical girl Sakura Kinomoto from Cardcaptor Sakura. Unlike Tomoyo, however, Futaba displays more extreme fantasies and lesbian arousal whenever she is with her friend. * Hitomi Aasu („ÅÇ„ÅÇ„Åô„Å≤„Å®„Åø ƒÄsu Hitomi) : :The youngest of the Aasu sisters, at only 3 years old, Hitomi is in a hurry to grow up and grow breasts. She possesses the power of precognition, although it is not very good because she mostly foresees the obvious. Whenever she is having a vision, she seems to have bowel movements. Her name comes from hito, the Japanese word for \\"one\\". Banning in New Zealand Due to its sexual and violent scenes, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned Puni Puni Poemy in New Zealand. A New Zealand anime fan, Simon Brady, unsuccessfully appealed to the OFLC to change its decision, citing that the show was only rated MA15+ in Australia. However, the OFLC stated that programs were banned if the board felt that it promoted the exploitation of children or young persons for sexual purposes, extreme violence and extreme cruelty.

Thanks largely to the intelligent use made of the aid given by the U.S.S.R., the United States, West Germany, Britain, China, and the World Bank, the internal economy of the country made good progress. The first five-year plan, which began in 1956, aimed at encouraging agriculture, especially irrigation. Experience showed, however, that progress in these spheres could only be partially achieved as long as internal communications remained primitive and the natural resources of the country were largely unexplored. As a result, the major effort was diverted to the construction of roads and airports, and to the systematic investigation of sources of water supply and of mineral wealth. During the course of the second five-year plan, conditions became favourable on many economic front. Promising deposits of natural gas and of iron ore were discovered; the power available for industrial use increased dramatically; and the extension of irrigation led to substantially increased agricultural production. In Afghanistan, as in many other underdeveloped countries, however, this rapid success led to the emergence of new problems, unforeseen in the original planning: inflation of prices, difficulties over foreign exchange, and an unhealthy reliance on large-scale external aid for the easing of current domestic shortages. The indications are that the third five-year plan will aim mainly at consolidating what has already been achieved rather than at any new major advances. Incumbents * Monarch - Mohammed Zahir Shah * Prime Minister - Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal January 1966 The break with the past represented by the new democratic constitution inaugurated in 1965 is further underlined by the appointment of a woman, Kubra Noorzai, to the cabinet as Minister of Public Health. Under the new constitution, women can both vote and stand as candidates, and in September 1965, four were returned to the new National Assembly. Even so, Miss Noorzai's elevation to cabinet rank is regarded as a striking illustration of the determination of King Mohammad Zahir Shah and of the government headed by Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal to bring the country into line with modern ideas on the political and social status of women. April 4‚Äì8, 1966 Cordiality with the People's Republic of China is cemented by a visit to Kabul by President Liu Shaoqi and Marshal Chen Yi. Afghanistan maintains its traditional policy of friendliness without involvement, its relations with Communist and non-Communist countries being equally cordial. The former friction with Pakistan has also ceased. End of 1966 The first parliament created under the new democratic constitution adjourns for the winter recess. Its relations with the Maiwandwal cabinet were close and cordial, and it gave full support to the government's efforts to achieve national financial stability. Drastic cuts were made in government expenditure and, due to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund, the country is able to face with confidence the completion of the second five-year plan and the beginning in May 1967 of the third five-year plan.

Sepak takraw differs from the similar sport of footvolley in its use of a rattan ball and only allowing players to use their feet, knee, chest and head to touch the ball. In Indonesia, Brunei, Singapore and Malaysia it is called sepak takraw. In Malaysia, it can be known as sepak raga as well. In the Philippines, the sport is also called \\"sepak takraw\\", resembling the related native sport known as sip√†, while the international version is known by the borrowed terms sip√† t√°kraw or sepak takraw. In Thailand, it is known simply as takraw. In Laos, it is kataw (). In Myanmar, it is known as chin lone, and is considered more of an art as there is often no opposing team, and the point is to keep the ball aloft gracefully and interestingly. Similar games include footbag net, footvolley, football tennis, bossaball, jianzi, jokgu and sipa. Etymology \\"Sepak\\" is the Malay word for kick and \\"takraw\\" is the Thai word for a woven rattan ball; therefore sepak takraw quite literally means \\"to kick a ball\\". Sepak takraw is known in many names across Southeast Asia; including ; ; , , ; , Pike Kyaw Chin; , ; , Sei Dak; , ka-taw; , \\"calameae ball\\" or \\"rattan ball\\". History Video recording of a Sepak Takraw game The earliest historical evidence shows the game was played in the 15th century's Malacca Sultanate of Malaysia, for it is mentioned in the Malay historical text, \\"Sejarah Melayu\\" (Malay Annals). The Malay Annals described in details the incident of Raja Muhammad, a son of Sultan Mansur Shah who was accidentally hit with a rattan ball by Tun Besar, a son of Tun Perak, in a Sepak raga game. The ball hit Raja Muhammad's headgear and knocked it down to the ground. In anger, Raja Muhammad immediately stabbed and killed Tun Besar, whereupon some of Tun Besar's kinsmen retaliated and wanted to kill Raja Muhammad. However, Tun Perak managed to restrain them from such an act of treason by saying that he would no longer accept Raja Muhammad as the Sultan's heir. As a result of this incident, Sultan Mansur Shah ordered his son out of Malacca and had him installed as the ruler of Pahang. In Indonesia, sepak takraw was spread from nearby Malacca across the strait to Riau islands and Riau area in Sumatra as early as the 16th century, where it is also called as Sepak Raga in local Malay tongue, at that time some of Sumatran areas were part of Malacca sultanate. From there the Malay people spread across archipelago and introduced the game to Buginese people in Sulawesi. Then the game is developed as Buginese traditional game which is called \\"Raga\\" (the players are called \\"Pa'Raga\\"). The \\"Raga\\" can trace its origin from Malacca Sultanate, and was popular in South Sulawesi since the 19th century. Some men playing \\"Raga\\" encircling within a group, the ball is passed from one to another and the man who kicked the ball highest is the winner. \\"Raga\\" is also played for fun by demonstrating some tricks, such as kicking the ball and putting it on top of player's head holds by tengkolok bugis (Bugis cloth headgear similar to Malay tanjak). In Thailand (formerly Siam), there was evidence that the Thai had played Sepak Takraw since the Ayutthaya Kingdom, at least during the reign of King Naresuan (1590‚Äì1605). A French historian, Fran√ßois Henri Turpin, wrote about how the Siamese played the game of takraw to stay in shape. Murals at Bangkok's Wat Phra Kaeo which was built in 1785, depict the Hindu god Hanuman playing sepak takraw in a ring with a troop of monkeys. The game was played in its circle form for hundreds of years, and the modern version of sepak takraw began taking shape in Thailand sometime during the early 1740s. In 1929 the Siam Sports Association drafted the first rules for takraw competition. Four years later, the association introduced the volleyball-style net and held the first public contest. Within just a few years, takraw was introduced to the curriculum in Siamese schools. The game became such a cherished local custom that another exhibition of volleyball-style takraw was staged to celebrate the kingdom's first constitution in 1933, the year after Thailand abolished absolute monarchy. A traditional sip√† (rattan wicker ball) from the Maranao people of the Philippines, along with kakasing tops and a sungka board In the Philippines the sport is related with a native game called \\"sip√†\\" (or \\"sip√† salama\\" among Muslim Filipinos) and along with traditional martial arts survived the three century Spanish colonisation. It is a popular sport played by children in Philippines. It was the Philippine national sport until it was replaced by arnis in 2009. Sepak Takraw is included in Philippine's elementary and highschool curriculum. In Myanmar, or Burma, it was dubbed \\"chinlone\\", in Laos \\"kator\\", \\"c·∫ßu m√¢y\\" in Vietnam and in Indonesia \\"raga\\" or \\"sepak takraw\\". Some of the people believed that many variations of the game evolved from cuju, an ancient Chinese military exercise, where soldiers would try to keep a feathered shuttlecock airborne by kicking it back and forth between two people. As the sport developed, the animal hide and chicken feathers were eventually replaced by balls made of woven strips of rattan. The first versions of sepak takraw were not so much of a competition, but rather cooperative displays of skill designed to exercise the body, improve dexterity and loosen the limbs after long periods of sitting, standing or working. By the 1940s, the net version of the game had spread throughout Southeast Asia, and formal rules were introduced. This sport became officially known as \\"sepak takraw\\". Competition International play is now governed by ISTAF, the International Sepak Takraw Federation. Major competitions for the sport such as the ISTAF SuperSeries, the ISTAF World Cup and the King's Cup World Championships are held every year. Sepak takraw is now a regular sport event in the Asian Games and the Southeast Asian Games, in which Thailand has won the most medals for. =Asian Games= Sepak takraw has been a sport at the Asian Games since 1990 with Thailand securing the highest number of gold medals. =Canada= The Lao people first brought sepak takraw into Canada when they immigrated as refugees in the 1970s. But the game got exposure outside the Laotian communities and really started taking off when a Saskatchewan teacher, Richard (Rick) Engel, who encountered sepak takraw while living in Asia, included it in Asian Sport, Education & Culture (ASEC) International's School Presentation Program. Sepak takraw was so well received by schools that it became part of ASEC's mandate to help introduce, promote and organise the sport right across the country. In May 1998, after getting many schools playing sepak takraw, and by networking with experienced players, ASEC International organised the first Canadian inter-provincial tournament to include men's, boys and girls teams. By the end of 1998, Engel was sent to Bangkok, Thailand to film at the 14th King's Cup Sepak Takraw World Championships ‚Äì the footage of which was used to produce a widely used instructional sepak takraw video/DVD, called Sepak Takraw ‚Äì Just for Kicks. On 11 December 1998, the Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC)Sepak Takraw Association of Canada (STAC) was incorporated to organise and govern the sport nationally. Its office was set up in Regina, SK, where there are experienced players and organisational support, and where it could share the resources and office space of the already established ASEC International, a committee from which has now become Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc.Sepak Takraw Saskatchewan Inc. The first annual Canadian Open Sepak Takraw Championships (a national and international tournament event) were held in May 1999 in Regina, SK, and have over the years attracted teams from across Canada, the United States, Japan, Malaysia and China. That same year Canada also attended its first International Sepak Takraw Federation (ISTAF) Congress and was accepted as members of ISTAF, which governs the sport globally. In 2000, Rick Engel, Perry Senko and Brydon Blacklaws played for Team Canada and earned a silver medal in the entry level division of the King's Cup World Sepak Takraw Championships in Thailand. Another major milestone was achieved on 3 December 2000, when STAC and the sport of sepak takraw became an official class E Member of the Canadian Olympic Committee. Canada has since contributed much to the development of sepak takraw worldwide, with Engel authoring three instructional sepak takraw books and helping produce five sepak takraw DVDs, while STAC does the publishing. The most notable of these books is Sepak Takraw 101 - The Complete Coaching/Instructional Manual for Sepak Takraw (Kick Volleyball), the third edition of which has also been translated and published in the Indonesian language and released in Indonesia through a government education project. Engel has found himself to be in demand, introducing the sport and conducting sepak takraw skills clinics in schools and sessions at physical education teachers' conferences all over Canada, the US and Europe. =Japan= A Japanese team played at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing. While as of 2010 there are no professional teams in Japan, university level teams had been established at Asia University, Chiba University, Keio University, and Waseda University. =United States= The earliest accounts of organized takraw in the United States involve a group of students from Northrop University (Greg St. Pierre, Thomas Gong, Joel \\"big bird\\" Nelson, and Mark Kimitsuka) in 1986 in Inglewood, California, learning about and playing the sport in Los Angeles. In the early 80s, Southeast Asians held soccer tournaments that had takraw events in Wisconsin, Michigan, Minnesota and California, especially within the Lao, Hmong and Thai communities.The Log, Northrop University Student Newspaper, 5 November 1987, Vol 35, No. 3. Malaysian students attending the University often enjoyed playing the sport on a court on top of the dormitory cafeteria. They taught a handful of curious American students how to play, which in turn inspired Malaysia Airlines to sponsor a US team from the university to attend the National Tournament in Kuala Lumpur in November 1987. The Northrop team played in a bracket of international new teams with Korea, Sri Lanka, and Australia. The US team beat Sri Lanka and Australia to bring home the gold.Northrop University Magazine, December 1987, Vol 3, No. 4. Los Angeles's Asian community and Northrop's team had already established a takraw community in and around L.A. Sonderegger moved to Los Angeles, founded the United States Takraw Association, and started a business that sold plastic takraw balls. In 1989, he was sent an invitation from the International Sepak Takraw Federation, and Sonderegger along with a few of the Northrop group travelled to represent the United States in the World Championships. The team was beaten badly but the takraw world was enchanted with the fact that non-Asian teams had competed at the World Championships. Rules and regulations Measurements of courts and equipment often vary among tournaments and organisations that operate from a recreational to a competitive level; international competitive rules and regulations are used in this section. There are two types of event categories: the regu and the doubles regu. The regu category is played by three players on each team while the doubles regu is played by two players on each team. =Expressions= Takraw is the Thai word for the hand-woven rattan ball originally used in the game. Therefore, the game is essentially \\"kick ball\\".Talking Takraw[Electronic Version]. Journal of Mens Fitness, Vol. 20, Issue 10. The concept of Footvolley originates from Thai Takraw pronounced (Tha-Graw) Also, sometimes misnamed by foreigners as \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" however it is an ancient game mainly enjoyed between Thai and Laos. =Court= Sepak takraw court diagram The sepak takraw sport is played on a similar to badminton double sized court.Sportsmatchmaker.

The width of the lines bounding the court should not be more than measured and drawn inwards from the edge of the court measurements. All the boundary lines should be drawn at least away from all obstacles. The centre line of should be drawn equally dividing the right and left court. At the corner of each at the center line, the quarter circle shall be drawn from the sideline to the center line with a radius of measured and drawn outwards from the edge of the 0.9 m radius. The service circle of 0.3 m radius shall be drawn on the left and on the right court, the center of which is 2.45 m from the back line of the court and 3.05 m from the sidelines, the 0.04 m line shall be measured and drawn outward from the edge of the 0.3 m radius. =Net= The net shall be made of fine ordinary cord or nylon with 6 cm to 8 cm mesh. Similar to a volleyball net.Sportsmatchmaker. (2005). Sepak Takraw.Retrieved 23 March 2009, from the sportsmatchmaker website: http://www.sportsmatchmaker.com/rules/s-sports/sepak_takraw.cfm The net shall be 0.7 m in width and not shorter than 6.10 m in length and taped at 0.05 m from tape double at the top and sideline, called boundary tape. The net shall be edged with 0.05 m tape double at the top and the bottom of the net supported by a fine ordinary cord or nylon cord that runs through the tape and strain over and flush with the top of the posts. The top of the net shall be 1.52 m (1.42 m for women) in height from the center and 1.55 m (1.45 m for women) at the posts. =Ball= A sepak takraw ball made out of rattan The sepak takraw ball shall be spherical, made of synthetic fibre or one woven layer. Sepak takraw balls without synthetic rubber covering must have 12 holes and 20 intersections, must have a circumference measuring not less from for men and from for women, and must have a weight that ranges from for men and from for women. The ball can be in plain single colour, multi-colour, and luminous colours, but not in any colour that will impair the performance of the players. The sepak takraw ball can also be constructed of synthetic rubber or soft durable material for covering the ball, for the purpose of softening the impact of the ball on the player's body. The type of material and method used for constructing the ball or for covering the ball with rubber or soft durable covering must be approved by ISTAF before it can be used for any competition. All world, international, and regional competitions sanctioned by International Sepak Takraw Federation, including but not limited to, the Olympic Games, World Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and SEA Games, must be played with ISTAF approved sepak takraw balls. =Players= A match is played by two teams called 'regu', each consisting of three players. On some occasions, it can be played by only two players (doubles) or four players (quadrant) per team. One of the players shall be at the back; he/she is called a \\"Tekong\\" or also known as the \\"Server\\". The other two players shall be in front, one on the left and the other on the right. The player on the left is called a \\"feeder/setter/tosser\\" and the player on the right is called a \\"attacker/striker/killer\\". =Start of play and service= The side that must serve first shall start the first set. The side that wins the first set shall have the options of \\"Choosing Service\\". The throw must be executed as soon as the referee calls the score. If either of the \\"Inside\\" players throws the ball before the referee calls the score, it must be re-thrown and a warning will be given to the thrower. During the service, as soon as the Tekong kicks the ball, all the players are allowed to move about freely in their respective courts. The service is valid if the ball passes over the net, whether it touches the net or not, and inside the boundary of the two net tapes and boundary lines of the opponent's court. =Faults in the game= Serving side during service * The \\"Inside\\" player who is making service throws, plays with the(throwing up the ball, bumping, giving to other \\"Inside\\" player etc.) after the call of score has been made by the referee. * The \\"Inside\\" player lifts his feet or steps on the line or crosses over or touches the net while throwing the ball. * The Tekong jumps off the ground to execute the service. * The Tekong does not kick the ball on the service throw. * The ball touches his own player before crossing over the opponent court. * The ball goes over the net but falls outside the court. * The ball does not cross to the opponent side. * A player uses his hand or hands, or any other part of his arms to facilitate the execution of a kick even if the hand or arm does not directly touch the ball, but it touches other objects or surfaces instead when doing so. Serving and receiving side during service * Creating distracting manner or noise or shouting at his opponent. For both sides during the game * Any player who touches the ball on the opponent side. * Any part of player's body crosses over into opponent's court whether above or under the net except during the follow-through of the ball. * Playing the ball more than 3 times in succession. * The ball touches the arm * Stopping or holding the ball under the arm, between the legs or body. * Any part of the body or player's outfits e.g. shoes, jersey, head band etc., touches the net or the post or the referee's chairs or falls into the opponent's side. * The ball touches the ceiling, roof or the wall (any objects). =Scoring system= An official doubles or regu match is won by best of three sets (win 2 out of 3 sets), with each set being played up to 21 points. A team event or group match is effectively three regu matches played back to back, using different players for each regu. The winner is determined by best of three regus (win 2 out of 3 regus), where a winner of each individual regu is determined by best of 3 sets, played up to 21 points per set. In the last 3rd set the change of sides takes place when one team reaches 11 points. Point: when either serving side or receiving side commits a fault, a point is awarded to the opponent side. Competing countries International play is now governed by ISTAF, the International Sepak Takraw Federation Serving: Teams alternate serve every three points, regardless of who wins the points. I.e., each team serves three times, then the other team serves three times, and so on. If a tie takes place at 21-21, each team alternates one serve each until a winner is determined. Set: each set is won by the side which scores 21 points with a minimum lead of two points to a ceiling of 25 points. In the event of a 21-21 tie, the set shall be won by the side which gets a lead of two points, or when a side reaches 25 points (whichever occurs first).

It is one of the largest transnational criminal gangs in Los Angeles, with 30,000 to 50,000 members in 20 states across the US alone and is also allied with the Mexican Mafia. A United States Department of Justice report featured the following statement regarding 18th Street and rival gang MS-13, \\"These two gangs have turned the Central American northern triangle into the area with the highest homicide rate in the world.\\"  History  18th Street gang started near 18th Street and Union Avenue in the Rampart District of Los Angeles. There is conflicting information as to the exact area, but this is a generally accepted area by most academic sources. They were originally part of Clanton 14 but wanted to make a separate \\"clique\\" called Clanton 18th Street and allow immigrants the opportunity to join. This proposal was rejected by the Clanton 14, which led to the formation of the 18th Street gang. The two gangs have been bitter rivals ever since.Zilberg, E. (2011). Space of Detention: The Making of a Transnational Gang Crisis between Los Angeles and San Salvador. Durham, NC: Duke University Press. The 18th Street gang grew by expanding its membership to other nationalities and races, and it was among the first multiracial, multi-ethnic gangs in Los Angeles. In the beginning, they were made up largely of second-generation Hispanics. As the 18th Street gang began to battle with more established Hispanic gangs, they began to recruit outside the Hispanic community. There are approximately 200 separate individual autonomous gangs operating under the same name within separate barrios in the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, South Bay, Riverside, East Los Angeles, South Los Angeles, Downtown Los Angeles, Pico Union, Inglewood, Lynwood, South Gate, Huntington Park, Maywood, Long Beach, Orange County, and Los Angeles' Westside, according to the latest figures from the NDIC. In the early 2000s, the Federal Bureau of Investigation initiated wide-scale raids against known and suspected gang members, netting hundreds of arrests across the country. = Central America= Although it started as a Mexican gang, 18th Street quickly became mainly Central American as it started to recruit more members of other ethnic groups.Maras in Guatemala Increasing in Sophistication - published by Jeremy McDermott on 3 January 2013 When Central American gang members were arrested in the United States, they were then deported back to Central America where the gang rose out-of-control on different levels of violence not just in El Salvador, but in Honduras and Guatemala as well, becoming one of the most violent gangs in Central America.Honduras gangs \\"You can recognise the gangs from their murders\\" published By Rob Crilly on 14 November 2014 18th Street later became a bitter rival of MS-13 as both gangs wanted the top spot in Central America. Members of 18th street are mainly Salvadoran, Guatemalan, and Honduran, but the gang does have members from other parts of Central America. 18th Street influences have recently been spotted in Belize as well.Honduran 18th Street gang member arrested in Belize publish by edition.channel5belize.com In El Salvador a faction called the \\"Revolucionarios\\" (\\"Revolutionaries\\") split off 18th Street in 2005, becoming rivals with the remaining members, who came to be known as the \\"Sure√±os\\" (\\"Southerners.\\")  Location  The majority of 18th Street cliques operate throughout Southern California, but are active in other states and internationally as well. Los Angeles members began migrating to other areas outside America and started to establish their own cliques. 18th Street cliques have been identified in 120 cities in 37 states and the District of Columbia in the United States, as well internationally in Spain, Australia, Canada, England, France, Germany, Lebanon, Peru, Philippines, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador.  Culture  18th Street gang members are required to abide by a strict set of rules. Failure to obey the word of a gang leader, or to show proper respect to a fellow gang member, may result in an 18-second beating, or even execution for more serious offenses. According to the FBI, some factions of the 18th Street gang have developed a high level of sophistication and organization. 18th Street gang members often identify themselves with the number 18 on their clothing and sporting clothing from sports teams such as the Duke Blue Devils, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Angels, Los Angeles Chargers, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Lakers and Las Vegas Raiders. 18th Street will use the symbols XV3, XVIII, X8, 99 (9+9=18), and 3-dots in their graffiti and tattoos. 18th Street colors are blue and black; blue is to represent and to pay tribute to The Mexican Mafia, and black is to represent the original color for the gang. The 18th Street gang is occasionally referred to as the \\"Children's Army\\" because of its recruitment of elementary and middle-school aged youth. They also allow other races to join their ranks making the gang multi-ethnic. In El Salvador it is common for members of the gang to be tattooed on the face with a large \\"18\\". In many cases the tattoo covers the entire face.  Criminal activity  18th Street gang signs \\"We recognize them as one of the most violent street gangs and one of the most prolific in the United States,\\" says Special agent George Rodriguez, who until his retirement oversaw investigations for the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Cars are stolen and homes are burglarized by the gang routinely. On average, someone in Los Angeles County is assaulted or robbed by 18th Streeters every day. The gang has left a bloody trail at a pace three times that of many of the city's most active gangs. 18th Street is a well established gang that is involved in all areas of street-crime. Several 18th Street gang members have reached a higher level of sophistication and organization in their illicit activities than other gangs. While their main source of income is street-level distribution of drugs, they also have been linked to murders, assaults, arson, copyright infringement, extortion, human trafficking, illegal immigration, kidnapping, prostitution, robbery, and weapons trafficking, as well as other crimes.National Gang Intelligence Center ‚Äì National Gang threat assessment 2009 18th Street Gang has also been implicated in the high-profile kidnapping and murder of the 16-year-old brother of internationally renowned Honduran football player Wilson Palacios.

The was awarded as both a military and civil honour and ranked, along with the Order of the Black Eagle, the Order of the Red Eagle and the House Order of Hohenzollern, among the highest orders of merit in the Kingdom of Prussia. After 1871, when the various German kingdoms, grand duchies, duchies, principalities and Hanseatic city states had come together under Prussian leadership to form the federally structured German Empire, the Prussian honours gradually assumed, at least in public perception, the status of honours of Imperial Germany, even though many honours of the various German states continued to be awarded. The ' was an honour conferred both for military (1740‚Äì1918) and civil (1740‚Äì1810, after 1842 as a separate class) services. It was awarded strictly as a recognition of extraordinary personal achievement, rather than as a general marker of social status or a courtesy- honour, although certain restrictions of social class and military rank were applied. The order was secular, and membership endured for the remaining lifetime of the recipient, unless renounced or revoked. New awards of the military class (known during the First World War informally as the Blue Max []) ceased with the end of the Prussian monarchy in November 1918. (The colloquial name \\"Blue Max\\" was given in honour of Max Immelmann, the first recipient of the Pour le M√©rite during WWI. Immelmann was also the first aviator ever to win the award.) The civil class was revived as an independent organization in 1923 ( ). Instead of the King of Prussia, the President of Germany acted as head of the order. After the Second World War, the civil class was re-established in 1952. This version of the ' is still active today. The ' is still an order into which a person is admitted into membership, like the United Kingdom's Order of the British Empire, and is not simply a medal or state decoration. German author Ernst J√ºnger, who died in 1998, was the last living recipient of the military class award. History =Origins= The Pour le M√©rite was founded in 1740 by King Frederick II of Prussia. It was named in French, which was the leading international language and the favoured language at Frederick's court. The French name was retained, despite the rising tide of nationalism and increasing hostility between French and Germans during the 19th century, and ironically many of its recipients were honoured for acts performed in wars against France. The insignia of the military award was a blue-enameled Maltese Cross with golden eagles between the arms (which is based on the symbol of the Johanniter Order) and the Prussian royal cypher and the words Pour le M√©rite (\\"For Merit\\" in French) written in gold letters on the body of the cross. The ribbon was black with edge stripes of silver- white. The order consisted of only one class, both civil and military, until 1810. Only a few civilians were honored: Pierre Louis Maupertuis (1747), Francesco Algarotti (1747) and Voltaire (1750). =Military class= ' with oak leaves In January 1810, during the Napoleonic wars, King Frederick William III decreed that the award could be presented only to serving military officers. In March 1813, the king added an additional distinction, a spray of gilt oak leaves attached above the cross. Award of the oak leaves originally indicated extraordinary achievement in battle, and was usually reserved for high-ranking officers. The original regulations called for the capture or successful defence of a fortification, or victory in a battle. By World War I, the oak leaves often indicated a second or higher award of the Pour le M√©rite, though in most cases the recipients were still high-ranking officers (usually distinguished field commanders fitting the criteria above; the few lower ranking recipients of the oak leaves were mainly general staff officers responsible for planning a victorious battle or campaign). In early 1918, it was proposed to award the oak leaves to Germany's top flying ace, Manfred von Richthofen, but he was deemed ineligible under a strict reading of the regulations. Instead, Prussia awarded von Richthofen a slightly less prestigious honor, the Order of the Red Eagle, 3rd Class with Crown and Swords. This was still a high honour, as the 3rd Class was normally awarded to colonels and lieutenant colonels, and von Richthofen's award was one of only two of the 3rd Class with Crown and Swords during World War I. In 1866, a special military Grand Cross class of the award was established. This grade of the award was given to those who, through their actions, caused the retreat or destruction of an army. There were only five awards of the Grand Cross: to King Wilhelm I in 1866, to Crown Prince Frederick William of Prussia (later Emperor Frederick III) and Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia in 1873, to Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1878, and to Helmuth Graf von Moltke in 1879. \\"The Red Baron\\" Manfred von Richthofen wears \\"the Blue Max.\\" The Pour le M√©rite gained international fame during World War I. Although it could be awarded to any military officer, its most famous recipients were the pilots of the German Army Air Service (Luftstreitkr√§fte), whose exploits were celebrated in wartime propaganda. In aerial warfare, a fighter pilot was initially entitled to the award upon downing eight enemy aircraft. Aces Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke were the first airmen to receive the award, on January 12, 1916. It was awarded to Germany's highest-scoring ace, Manfred von Richthofen, in January 1917. Although it has been reported that because of Immelmann's renown among his fellow pilots and the nation at large, the Pour le M√©rite became known, due to its colour and Immelmann's first name, as the \\"Blue Max,\\" that has not been confirmed. The number of aerial victories necessary to receive the award continued to increase during the war; by early 1917, it generally required destroying 16 enemy airplanes, and by war's end the approximate figure was 30. However, other aviation recipients included zeppelin commanders, bomber and observation aircrews, and at least one balloon observer. Recipients of the \\"Blue Max\\" were required to wear the award whenever in uniform. Although many of its famous recipients were junior officers, especially pilots, more than a third of all awards in World War I went to generals and admirals. Senior officer awards tended to be more for outstanding leadership in combat than for individual acts of bravery. Junior officers (army captains and lieutenants and their navy equivalents) accounted for only about a fourth of all awards. Several famous lieutenant-ranked (Kapit√§nleutnant) U-boat commanders, including Lothar von Arnauld de la Peri√®re (), Walther Schwieger () Otto Hersing () and Otto Weddigen, received the Pour le M√©rite. The last new member admitted to the military class of the order was flying ace Theo Osterkamp, on 2 September 1918. The military class of the Pour le M√©rite became extinct as a result of Kaiser William II's abdication as king of Prussia and German Emperor on 9 November 1918. This marked the end of the Prussian monarchy and it was never awarded thereafter; however the honour continued to be recognized for, and worn by, previous recipients. =Civil class= In 1842, King Frederick William IV of Prussia, acting on the advice of Alexander von Humboldt, founded a separate civil class of the order, the Order Pour le M√©rite for Sciences and Arts (Orden Pour le M√©rite f√ºr Wissenschaften und K√ºnste), with the three sections: humanities, natural science and fine arts. When a vacancy occurred the Academy of Arts and Sciences nominated three candidates, one of whom the king appointed. In November 1918 the Kingdom of Prussia came to an end, and with it that state's sponsorship of the Pour le M√©rite. However, unlike the military class of the order, the class of the order for achievements in the arts and sciences did not come to an end. The members re-established their order as an autonomous organization, with revised rules and processes for nomination. The awarding of new memberships resumed in 1923. Recipients included Albert Einstein (1923), K√§the Kollwitz (1929) and Ernst Barlach (1933). During the era of National Socialism in Germany (1933‚Äì45), the order was re-absorbed into the state honours system, and the list of its members was reviewed and revised according to the policies of the new government. A number of Jews and other perceived dissidents or \\"enemies\\" of the state were deprived of their awards by the Nazi regime. They included Einstein (who resigned his membership in the order in 1933, and refused invitations to renew it after the war), Kollwitz, and Barlach. Such actions were later repudiated by both the order, and the postwar German government. In 1952, with the assistance of President of West Germany Theodor Heuss, the order was again re-established ‚Äì now as an independent organization with state recognition and the President of the German Federal Republic as Protector of the Order. However, unlike the somewhat similar Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit) also established by Heuss, it is not a state order. The revived civil order of the Pour le M√©rite is awarded for achievements in the arts and sciences. Active membership is limited to 40 German citizens, ten each in the fields of humanities, natural science, and medicine and the arts. Honorary membership can be conferred on foreigners, again to the limit of 40. When a vacancy occurs, the remaining members select a new inductee.

These included the Kingdom of Bavaria's Maximilian Order for Art and Science (Maximiliansorden f√ºr Kunst und Wissenschaft), the Duchy of Anhalt's Order of Merit for Science and Art (Verdienstorden f√ºr Wissenschaft und Kunst), and the Principality of Lippe's Lippe Rose Order for Art and Science (Lippische Rose, Orden f√ºr Kunst und Wissenschaft). A number of other countries have founded similar high civic honors for accomplishments in the arts and sciences. The sovereign of the Commonwealth realms confers the Order of Merit and Order of the Companions of Honour. The Republic of Austria confers the Austrian Decoration of Honor for Science and the Arts, founded in 1955. Like the Order Pour le M√©rite for Sciences and Arts, this was in a sense a revival of an earlier imperial award, in this case the Austro-Hungarian Decoration of Honor for Art and Science (√ñsterreichisch-Ungarisches Ehrenzeichen f√ºr Kunst und Wissenschaft), which existed from 1887 to 1918. Unlike the German award, however, the design of the modern Austrian award is unlike that of its imperial predecessor. France has the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres for significant contributions to the arts and literature. In Poland the Gloria Artis Medal has been established for the same purpose. Other countries also may recognize accomplishments in the arts and sciences, but with more general orders also awarded for accomplishments in other fields. France's L√©gion d'honneur is an example of a decoration often conferred for accomplishment in many fields, including the arts and sciences. Belgium awards either its Order of Leopold or Order of the Crown for outstanding accomplishments in the arts and sciences, and may award its Civil Decoration for lesser accomplishments in these fields.

It connects Martigny in the canton of Valais in Switzerland with Aosta in the region Aosta Valley in Italy. It is the lowest pass lying on the ridge between the two highest mountains of the Alps, Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa. The pass itself is located in Switzerland in the canton of Valais, very close to Italy. It is located on the main watershed that separates the basin of the Rh√¥ne from that of the Po.The border between the two countries runs along a straight line from the Petite Chenalette to the Mont Mort, instead of following the watershed Great St Bernard is one of the most ancient passes through the Western Alps, with evidence of use as far back as the Bronze Age and surviving traces of a Roman road. In 1800, Napoleon's army used the pass to enter Italy, an event depicted in Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard Pass and Hippolyte Delaroche's Bonaparte Crossing the Alps, both notable oil paintings. Having been bypassed by easier and more practical routes, particularly the Great St Bernard Tunnel which opened in 1964, its value today is mainly historical and recreational. Straddling the highest point of the road, the Great St Bernard Hospice was founded in 1049. The hospice later became famous for its use of St Bernard dogs in rescue operations. Geography =Route= The pass runs northeast- southwest through the Valais Alps (formerly known as the Pennine Alps after the Roman name for the pass, poeninus mons or summus poeninus) at a maximum elevation of . The road running through the pass, highway E27 in both Italy and Switzerland, joins Martigny on the upper Rh√¥ne in the canton of Valais, Switzerland, to Aosta in the Aosta Valley region of Italy. From Martigny Route 9 descends to Lausanne and from Aosta Route A5 descends to Torino. View of the pass towards the Italy-Switzerland border From the north, in Switzerland, the route to the pass follows the lower part of the river La Drance above Martigny, then into the wild and desolate Val d'Entremont (lit.: \\"valley between mountain\\") through which the Drance d'Entremont flows. The Great St Bernard Tunnel (and the main road) plunges through the mountains at a level, reducing, since the tunnel's opening in 1964, the commercial relevance of the road over the pass. On the south side the route follows the steep slopes of the upper part of the Torrent du Grand Saint-Bernard to the south, then turns to the east and follows the river in a bend to the south, where the mountain river enters the Torrent Artanavaz and turns to the east again, then smoothly to the southeast. Here the river enters the La Buthier in the lower end of the Valpelline and turns south again on which end finally the river flows into the Dora Baltea in Aosta. The route here in the main valley of the Val d'Aoste becomes part of the motorway connecting the Mont Blanc Tunnel to the west and the upper Po Basin to the southeast. A reduction of utility began after the construction of the Simplon Tunnel, strictly a railway tunnel, to the east in 1905. The much smaller historic road winding over the pass itself, which lies a few hundred metres from the Swiss border with Italy, is only passable June to September. The pass at narrowest point runs between the peaks of Grande Chenalette at and Mont Mort at . Slightly to the west is Pointe de Dr√¥ne at , the highest peak. Between it and the pass is Petite Chenalette at . The Tour de France has visited the pass five times. It was climbed four times as a 1st category climb, and one time, in 2009, as a hors cat√©gorie climb. =Weather= The snow in the pass in winter may be as much as 10 metres deep. The temperature may drop as low as -30 ¬∞C. The lake in the pass is frozen for 265 days per year. A summary of weather data for the year 1981-2010 is given below. =Ecology= The pass is well above the tree line. All the wood required for construction and firewood must be hauled in from some distance. On the south-west side of the pass is a small tarn, the Great St Bernard Lake, which captures melt water and does not support fish, even though attempts have been made to stock it. In past years the tarn has not always thawed completely in summer. Alpine flowers are abundant in the vicinity: Gentiana clusii, Ranunculus glacialis, Dryas octopetala, Forget-me-not, Saxifraga oppositifolia among many hundreds more. Moss is prolific and the rocks are lichen-covered. The hospice and the dogs Hospice at the Great St Bernard, with Roman road in foreground. The modern road is below it. To the right the snowy slope descends to the tarn. On the other side of the monastery buildings the road descends into Switzerland. A hospice for travellers was founded in 1049 by Saint Bernard of Menthon and came to be named after him in the 16th century, along with the pass. It was not the first hospice in the pass. Buildings were probably there since the Roman mansio, but the region was not secure and they were destroyed many times. The first concern of the founder of the current monastery was to clear the region of bandits and keep the pass safe for travellers, the role of rescuers developing naturally. The hospice later became famous for its use of St Bernard dogs in rescue operations. Pope Pius XI confirmed Bernard as patron saint of the Alps in 1923. St Bernard dog with barrel The hospice straddles the highest point of the road, which is in Switzerland. Today the modern road for through traffic has been routed around the outside of the monastery buildings to allow some integrity of the grounds. The old road may still be seen, above the paved road. The hospice occupies two buildings, of 1560 and 1898 (picture, right). The Congregation of Canons of the Great Saint Bernard (the monks) also owns the H√¥tel de l'Hospice du Grand- St-Bernard, a four-story building made of grey stone (built in 1899) on the Italian side, which it leases to a private entrepreneur for the provision of hotel services. The St Bernards were bred large enough to traverse deep snow and to find lost persons by scent. The first evidence that the dogs were in use at the monastery is two paintings dating to 1690 by Salvatore Rosa. It is often said that they carried small casks of brandy around their necks (although this is only legend), in the belief that the liquor had medicinal properties. A description of an overnight stay at the monastery in 1857 was given by Theodore Nielsen a Danish Kleinsmith Journeyman in his memoirs: Today the tunnel and modern technology have made rescue operations at the pass mainly unnecessary. The dogs were put up for sale in 2004 because of the high cost of maintenance and were promptly bought by two foundations created for the purpose: Fondation Barry du Grand Saint Bernard (major contributor Christine Cerletti-Sarasin) and Fondation Bernard et Caroline de Watteville. Barry bought the kennels and the facilities in Martigny and continues to support and breed the dogs (three or four dozen). One condition of the sale is that they be brought to the monastery for the summer. Travellers are likely to see them romping around the slopes. The de Watteville Foundation keeps several dogs in kennels adjunct to its Mus√©e. Both have agreed to work together and others have joined the partnership. The monastery currently houses a handful of monks on a permanent basis and serves as a spiritual center for others on retreat. History View toward the Italian side from the monastery. Beyond the buildings at the end of the lake the road drops sharply. On the hillside above the modern road can be seen the Roman road. Mont Blanc, and the Ruitor massifs. =Celtic period= The pass first appears in history as the route taken by the Celtic tribes of the Boii and Lingones in the invasion of Italy of 390 BC.History of Rome, V.35. The classical authors first mentioning the pass in that or other contexts lived the 1st century BC under the early Roman empire. They were calling the pass and the mountains Poeninus or Poenini, \\"Punic\\", an apparent reference to Hannibal's crossing. He did not cross there, however. On the presumption that the name was falsely altered by analogy, it can be reconstructed to *peninus, a Roman-Celtic word, considering that Celtic tribes owned the entire pass until defeated by the Romans. Livy says that the pass was not named after the Carthaginians but after a mountain god.History of Rome XXXI.38. For well over a century scholars such as the Grimm brothers have made a connection with continental Celtic pen or ben, \\"head, summit, chief\\" on an analogy with the Zeus karaios of Hesychius. Two tribes occupied the valleys on either side of the pass on a permanent basis: the Veragri on the Swiss side and the Salassi on the Italian side. =Roman period= Julius Caesar sent an expedition under his best commander, Servius Galba, from Gaul in 57 BC to seize the pass, hoping to obtain a shorter route between Italy and Gaul than the contemporaneous coastal route. Galba was deceived by the Veragri into making camp near Martigny with the expectation of moving into the pass on the next day. At that time the Romans found the heights over the trail occupied by three hostile Gallic tribes. The Romans won a local victory by a daring foray from the camp but Galba judged he could not take the pass and departed. Augustus succeeded where his adoptive father failed and the pass became Roman. Augustus placed a large castra stativa and colony, Augusta Praetoria Salassorum, below the pass, which became Aosta (contraction of Augusta). Its ruins are a historic attraction there. By 43 AD under the emperor Claudius a good Roman road through the pass was completed with a mansio at the top and a temple to Jupiter Poeninus, resulting in the name Mons Jovis in late antiquity, Monte Jove in the early Italian period and Mont Joux in the French period, a synonym for the pass. The site of the temple is known as the Plan de Jupiter, located on a knoll on the Italian side of the pass. A cross was placed there in 1816 bearing the inscription Deo optimo maximo, \\"to the best and greatest god.\\" The bronze statue of St Bernard on a pedestal above the road on the Italian side, across a small valley from the cross, was constructed in 1905 on the site of the Roman mansio. The coins and votive tablets found at the site of the temple roughly date the upper limit of Roman control of the pass. The youngest date to the reign of Theodosius II (1st half of the 5th century). These and other artifacts are stored in the monastery museum. Fragments of the marble temple, some with inscriptions, have been incorporated into many structures of the village of Bourg-Saint-Pierre on the Swiss side of the pass. The Roman milestone for mile XXIIII was also brought to the center of the settlement from the top of the pass. =Napoleonic crossing= Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David, 1801 The pass had entered history with the Gallic invasion of 390 BC. The last Gallic invasion over it occurred in May, 1800, under the direction of the 30-year-old First Consul of the French Republic, Napoleon Bonaparte. An Austrian army of 140,000 men had laid siege to French-occupied Genoa on the west coast of northern Italy. Napoleon traversed the pass with 40,000 men and ‚Öì of their heavy artillery sending another 20,000 over three other passes as a diversion, intending to strike the Austrian rear. The panicked Austrians were unable to assemble fast enough to meet the French en masse but rather in a piecemeal way in June 1800, and so were defeated first at the Battle of Montebello and then at the Battle of Marengo. Napoleon prepared for the march secretly by assembling men in small units below the pass, establishing supply dumps along the lower part of their route, and hiring artisans to set up shop along it as well. On May 15 an advance unit went over the pass to take Aosta, after which hospitals were set up at Martigny and Aosta. At Martigny the army assembled and received rations for three days. All the equipment - carriages, artillery, arms and ammunition - was disassembled and divided into packs of 60-70 pounds for the men to carry. The cannons were to be dragged up over the snow in hollowed-out pine half-logs by mules, and then when the mules died or were exhausted, by 100 soldiers and hired men each. Napoleon offered liberal monetary rewards to soldiers and laborers who could perform difficult portages in a timely fashion. Napoleon passing the Great St Bernard Pass, by Edouard Castres Over several days at the end of May the army went over the pass single-file, 6000 men per day. Bands played martial music along the route, with drum rolls at especially difficult places to alert the men. At the top the monks handed each man two glasses of wine and a slice of rye with cheese as he filed by (courtesy of the French army). Accounts of the amounts expended vary. On the other side the snow became so packed that the men slid down sitting. Napoleon was the last man over, sliding also. The good weather held for the entire crossing, which could easily have turned into a disaster, if it had not. On the way up Napoleon had discussed affairs of the heart with his young guide and mule driver, Pierre Nicholas Dorsaz, who did not know his identity. Offered a reward at the top, Dorsaz asked for the mule on which Napoleon was riding. He received the mule and a short note for the chief supply officer of the army. Versions of the story vary, but they all agree that when the young man had turned in the note and had drawn his ample pay for the work, he found that his companion was Napoleon and the latter had given him a house and farm so that he could marry his sweetheart. In the Aosta Valley Napoleon's army slipped by an Austrian garrison at Bard just out of cannon range. The commander related that he was astonished to watch an army of 40,000 men in full equipment go marching past from the direction of the heights. In literature The Dorrit family crossed from France into Italy in Book Two: Riches, as recounted in the novel Little Dorrit by Charles Dickens. They meet the newlywed Gowans and the gentlemanly murderer Rigaud, now called Blandois, at the inn after climbing up on mules. The novel was published in 1857, but set in the mid 1820s. Dickens describes the sites of the pass, and the experience of staying overnight in the inn.

Origin Takrur was the capital of the state which flourished on the lower Senegal River. Takruri was a term, like Bilad-ul-Sudan, that was used to refer to all people of West African ancestry,Ibn Khalikan, op. cit. vi, 14. and is still in use as such in the Middle East, with some corruption, as in Takruni, pl. Takarna ÿ™ŸÉÿ±ŸàŸÜŸä in Saudi Arabia. The district of Bulaq Al-Dakrur ÿ®ŸàŸÑÿßŸÇ ÿßŸÑÿØŸÉÿ±Ÿàÿ± in Cairo is named after an ascetic from West Africa. The formation of the state may have taken place as an influx of Fulani from the east settled in the Senegal valley. John Donnelly Fage suggests that Takrur was formed through the interaction of Berbers from the Sahara and \\"Negro agricultural peoples\\" who were \\"essentially Serer\\". Centre of trade Located in the Senegal valley, along the border of present-day Senegal and Mauritania, it was a trading centre, where gold from the Bambuk region, salt from the Awlil, and Sahel grain were exchanged. It was rival of the Ghana Empire, and the two states clashed from occasionally with the Sonink√©, usually winning. Despite these clashes, Takrur prospered throughout the 9th and 10th centuries. According to Levtzion, \\"It is significant that the cotton tree and the manufacture of cloth were first reported from Takrur.\\" Adoption of Islam The kings of Takrur eventually adopted Islam. Sometime in the 1030s during the reign of king War Jabi, the court converted to Islam, the first regent to officially pronounce orthodoxy in the Sahel, establishing the faith in the region for centuries to come. In 1035 War Jabi introduced Sharia law in the kingdom. This adoption of Islam greatly benefited the state economically and created greater political ties that would also affect them in the coming conflicts between the traditionalist state of Ghana and its northern neighbours. Ghana Empire The Fulani of Takrur became independent after Ghanaian power faded. Takrur in turn set out to conquer the Kingdom of Diara, which was a Ghanaian province before. Then in 1203, Takrur leader Sumanguru took control of Kumbi Saleh, the capital of Ghana. Thus, Takrur became the sole power in the region. Downfall Among these were the Susu who carved out the sizeable, though short-lived, Kaniaga commune. Waalo, the first Wolof state, emerged out of its south. By the time the Mandinka tribes united to form the Mali Empire in 1235, Takrur was in a steep decline. The state was finally conquered by the usurper emperor Sabakoura of Mali in the 1280s. Takrur was later conquered by Mali; it was also conquered by Jolof in the 15th century.Leyti, Oumar Ndiaye. Le Djoloff et ses Bourba. Nouvelles Editions Africaines, 1981. However, Koli (a Fula rebel) did finally manage to regain Takrur, and named it Fouta Toro in the 15th century, thereby setting up the first Fula dynasty (Denanke). This dynasty also did not last and in 1776 during the Fouta Revolution, led by Muslim clerics, the kingdom was entered and the house of Denanke was brought down.Ogot, Bethwell A. General history of Africa: Africa from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. University of California Press, 1999, , p 146 Takrur as toponym After the fall of Takrur its name was employed by Arab historians as a synonym for \\"West Africa\\".

On February 28, 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress established a provisional volunteer army and gave control over military operations and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the newly chosen Confederate president, Jefferson Davis. Davis was a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, and colonel of a volunteer regiment during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. He had also been a United States Senator from Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce. On March 1, 1861, on behalf of the Confederate government, Davis assumed control of the military situation at Charleston, South Carolina, where South Carolina state militia besieged Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, held by a small U.S. Army garrison. By March 1861, the Provisional Confederate Congress expanded the provisional forces and established a more permanent Confederate States Army. An accurate count of the total number of individuals who served in the Confederate Army is not possible due to incomplete and destroyed Confederate records; estimates of the number of individual Confederate soldiers are between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men. This does not include an unknown number of slaves who were pressed into performing various tasks for the army, such as construction of fortifications and defenses or driving wagons.Records of the number of individuals who served in the United States Army are more extensive and reliable, but still are not entirely accurate. Estimates of the number of individual Union soldiers range between 1,550,000 and 2,400,000, with a number between 2,000,000 and 2,200,000 most likely. Union Army records show slightly more than 2,677,000 enlistments but this number apparently includes many re- enlistments. These numbers do not include sailors who served in United States Navy or United States Marine Corps. These figures represent the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, not the size of the army at any given date. Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the army at any given date. These numbers do not include men who served in Confederate States Navy. Although most of the soldiers who fought in the American Civil War were volunteers, both sides by 1862 resorted to conscription, primarily as a means to force men to register and to volunteer. In the absence of exact records, estimates of the percentage of Confederate soldiers who were draftees are about double the 6 percent of United States soldiers who were conscripts.Albert Burton Moore, Conscription and Conflict in the Confederacy (1924). Confederate casualty figures also are incomplete and unreliable. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers are about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in United States prison camps. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026. These numbers do not include men who died from other causes such as accidents, which would add several thousand to the death toll.In comparison, the best estimates of the number of deaths of United States soldiers are 110,100 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 224,580 deaths from disease and 30,192 deaths in Confederate prison camps, although some historians also dispute these figures. The best conjecture for United States Army wounded is 275,175. The main Confederate armies, the Army of Northern Virginia under General Robert E. Lee and the remnants of the Army of Tennessee and various other units under General Joseph E. Johnston, surrendered to the U.S. on April 9, 1865 (officially April 12), and April 18, 1865 (officially April 26). Other Confederate forces surrendered between April 16, 1865, and June 28, 1865.Confederate forces at Mobile, Alabama, and Columbus, Georgia, also had already surrendered on April 14, 1865, and April 16, 1865, respectively. U.S. and Confederate units fought a battle at Columbus, Georgia, before the surrender on April 16, 1865, and a small final battle at Palmito Ranch, Texas, on May 12, 1865. In areas more distant from the main theaters of operations, Confederate forces in Alabama and Mississippi under Lieutenant General Richard Taylor, in Arkansas under Brigadier General M. Jeff Thompson, in Louisiana and Texas under General E. Kirby Smith and in Indian Territory under Brigadier General Stand Watie surrendered on May 4, 1865, May 12, 1865, May 26, 1865 (officially June 2, 1865), and June 28, 1865, respectively. By the end of the war, more than 100,000 Confederate soldiers had deserted, and some estimates put the number as high as one third of Confederate soldiers. The Confederacy's government effectively dissolved when it fled Richmond in April and exerted no control over the remaining armies. Prelude By the time Abraham Lincoln took office as President of the United States on March 4, 1861, the seven seceding slave states had formed the Confederate States. They seized federal property, including nearly all U.S. Army forts, within their borders. Lincoln was determined to hold the forts remaining under U.S. control when he took office, especially Fort Sumter in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. On February 28, shortly before Lincoln was sworn in as president, the Provisional Confederate Congress had authorized the organization of a large Provisional Army of the Confederate States (PACS). Under orders from Confederate President Jefferson Davis, C.S. troops under the command of General P. G. T. Beauregard bombarded Fort Sumter on April 12‚Äì13, 1861, forcing its capitulation on April 14. The United States was outraged by the Confederacy's attack and demanded war. It rallied behind Lincoln's call on April 15 for all the loyal states to send troops to recapture the forts from the secessionists, to put down the rebellion and to save the Union.Weigley 2000, p. 24 Four more slave states then joined the Confederacy. Both the United States and the Confederate States began in earnest to raise large, mostly volunteer, armies, with the opposing objectives of putting down the rebellion and preserving the Union on the one hand, or of establishing independence from the United States on the other.McPherson 1997, pp. 104‚Äì105 Establishment Private Edwin Francis Jemison, whose image became one of the most famous portraits of the young soldiers of the war The Confederate Congress provided for a Confederate army patterned after the United States Army. It was to consist of a large provisional force to exist only in time of war and a small permanent regular army. The provisional, volunteer army was established by an act of the Provisional Confederate Congress passed on February 28, 1861, one week before the act which established the permanent regular army organization, passed on March 6. Although the two forces were to exist concurrently, little was done to organize the Confederate regular army. * The Provisional Army of the Confederate States (PACS) began organizing on April 27. Virtually all regular, volunteer, and conscripted men preferred to enter this organization since officers could achieve a higher rank in the Provisional Army than they could in the Regular Army. If the war had ended successfully for them, the Confederates intended that the PACS would be disbanded, leaving only the ACSA. * The Army of the Confederate States of America (ACSA) was the regular army and was authorized to include 15,015 men, including 744 officers, but this level was never achieved. The men serving in the highest rank as Confederate States generals, such as Samuel Cooper and Robert E. Lee, were enrolled in the ACSA to ensure that they outranked all militia officers. ACSA ultimately existed only on paper. The organization of the ACSA did not proceed beyond the appointment and confirmation of some officers. Three state regiments were later denominated \\"Confederate\\" regiments but this appears to have had no practical effect on the organization of a regular Confederate Army and no real effect on the regiments themselves. Members of all the military forces of the Confederate States (the army, the navy, and the marine corps) are often referred to as \\"Confederates\\", and members of the Confederate army were referred to as \\"Confederate soldiers\\". Supplementing the Confederate army were the various state militias of the Confederacy: * Confederate States State Militias were organized and commanded by the state governments, similar to those authorized by the United States' Militia Act of 1792. =Control and conscription= A cartoon from the war, showing the Confederates forcibly drafting a Unionist man into the Confederate army. The Unionist man objects, with the Confederates threatening to lynch him if he does not comply. Control and operation of the Confederate army were administered by the Confederate States War Department, which was established by the Confederate Provisional Congress in an act on February 21, 1861. The Confederate Congress gave control over military operations, and authority for mustering state forces and volunteers to the President of the Confederate States of America on February 28, 1861, and March 6, 1861. On March 8 the Confederate Congress passed a law that authorized Davis to issue proclamations to call up no more than 100,000 men. The War Department asked for 8,000 volunteers on March 9, 20,000 on April 8, and 49,000 on and after April 16. Davis proposed an army of 100,000 men in his message to Congress on April 29. On August 8, 1861, the Confederacy called for 400,000 volunteers to serve for one or three years. In April 1862, the Confederacy passed the first conscription law in either Confederate or Union history, the Conscription Act, which made all able bodied white men between the ages of 18 and 35 liable for a three-year term of service in the Provisional Army. It also extended the terms of enlistment for all one-year soldiers to three years. Men employed in certain occupations considered to be most valuable for the home front (such as railroad and river workers, civil officials, telegraph operators, miners, druggists and teachers) were exempt from the draft.War Conscription Laws: November 15, 2012 by Margaret Wood. The act was amended twice in 1862. On September 27, the maximum age of conscription was extended to 45.Faust, Patricia L. ed Historical Times Encyclopedia of the Civil War: New York, 1986 On October 11, the Confederate Congress passed the so-called \\"Twenty Negro Law\\", which exempted anyone who owned 20 or more slaves, a move that caused deep resentment among conscripts who did not own slaves. The Confederate Congress enacted several more amendments throughout the war to address losses suffered in battle as well as the United States' greater supply of manpower. In December 1863, it abolished the practice of allowing a rich drafted man to hire a substitute to take his place in the ranks. Substitution had also been practiced in the United States, leading to similar resentment from the lower classes. In February 1864, the age limits were extended to between 17 and 50. Challenges to the subsequent acts came before five state supreme courts; all five upheld them.. Morale and motivations An 1861 Confederate recruiting poster from Virginia, urging men to join the Confederate cause and fight off the U.S. Army, which it refers to as a \\"brutal and desperate foe\\" In his 2010 book Major Problems in the Civil War, historian Michael Perman says that historians are of two minds on why millions of men seemed so eager to fight, suffer and die over four years: Educated soldiers drew upon their knowledge of American history to justify their costs. McPherson says: > Confederate and Union soldiers interpreted the heritage of 1776 in opposite > ways. Confederates professed to fight for liberty and independence from a > too radical government; Unionists said they fought to preserve the nation > conceived in liberty from dismemberment and destruction ... The rhetoric of > liberty that had permeated the letters of Confederate volunteers in 1861, > grew even stronger as the war progressed.James McPherson, For Cause and > Comrades: Why Men Fought in the Civil War (1998) pp 104‚Äì5. Before and during the Civil War, the popular press of Richmond, including its five major newspapers, sought to inspire a sense of patriotism, Confederate identity, and the moral high ground in the southern population. =Religion= The southern churches met the shortage of Army chaplains by sending missionaries. The Southern Baptists sent a total of 78 missionaries, starting in 1862. Presbyterians were even more active, with 112 missionaries sent in early 1865. Other missionaries were funded and supported by the Episcopalians, Methodists, and Lutherans. One result was wave after wave of religious revivals in the Army,W. Harrison Daniel, \\"Southern Protestantism and Army Missions in the Confederacy.\\" Mississippi Quarterly 17.4 (1964): 179+. religion playing a major part in the lives of Confederate soldiers. Some men with a weak religious affiliation became committed Christians, and saw their military service in terms of satisfying God's wishes. Religion strengthened the soldiers' loyalty to their comrades and the Confederacy. Military historian Samuel J. Watson argues that Christian faith was a major factor in combat motivation. According to his analysis, the soldiers' faith was consoling for the loss of comrades; it was a shield against fear; it helped reduce drinking and fighting in the ranks; it enlarged the soldiers' community of close friends and helped compensate for their long-term separation from home.Samuel J. Watson, \\"Religion and combat motivation in the Confederate armies.\\" Journal of Military History 58#1 (1994): 29+. =Slavery and white supremacism= In his 1997 book For Cause and Comrades, which examines the motivations of the American Civil War's soldiers, historian James M. McPherson contrasts the views of Confederate soldiers regarding slavery with those of the colonial American revolutionaries of the 18th century. He stated that while the American rebel colonists of the 1770s saw an incongruity between owning slaves on the one hand, and proclaiming to be fighting for liberty on the other, the Confederacy's soldiers did not, as the Confederate ideology of white supremacy negated any contradiction between the two: McPherson states that Confederate soldiers did not discuss the issue of slavery as often as United States soldiers did, because most Confederate soldiers readily accepted as an obvious fact that they were fighting to perpetuate slavery and thus did not feel the need to debate over it: Continuing, McPherson also stated that of the hundreds of Confederate soldiers' letters he had examined, none of them contained any anti-slavery sentiment whatsoever: McPherson admits some flaws in his sampling of letters. Soldiers from slaveholding families were overrepresented by 100%: In some cases, Confederate men were motivated to join the army in response to the United States' actions regarding its opposition to slavery. After U.S. President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, some Confederate soldiers welcomed the move, as they believed it would strengthen pro-slavery sentiment in the Confederacy and thus lead to greater enlistment of white men in the Confederate army. One Confederate soldier from Texas gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that \\"we are fighting for our property\\", contrasting this with the motivations of Union soldiers, who, he claimed, were fighting for the \\"flimsy and abstract idea that a negro is equal to an Anglo American\\". One Louisianan artilleryman stated, \\"I never want to see the day when a negro is put on an equality with a white person. There is too many free niggers ... now to suit me, let alone having four millions.\\" A North Carolinian soldier stated, \\"[A] white man is better than a nigger.\\" In 1894, Virginian and former Confederate soldier John S. Mosby, reflecting on his role in the war, stated in a letter to a friend that \\"I've always understood that we went to war on account of the thing we quarreled with the North about. I've never heard of any other cause than slavery.\\" =Desertion= At many points during the war, and especially near the end, the Confederate armies were very poorly fed. At home their families were in worsening condition and faced starvation and the depredations of roving bands of marauders. Many soldiers went home temporarily (\\"Absent Without Official Leave\\") and quietly returned when their family problems had been resolved. By September 1864, however, President Davis publicly admitted that two-thirds of the soldiers were absent, \\"most of them without leave\\". The problem escalated rapidly after that, and fewer and fewer men returned. Soldiers who were fighting in defense of their homes realized that they had to desert to fulfill that duty. Historian Mark Weitz argues that the official count of 103,400 deserters is too low. He concludes that most of the desertions came because the soldier felt he owed a higher duty to his own family than to the Confederacy.Mark A. Weitz, A higher duty: desertion among Georgia troops during the Civil War (U of Nebraska Press, 2005). Confederate policies regarding desertion generally were severe. For example, on August 19, 1862, General Stonewall Jackson approved the court-martial sentence of execution for three soldiers for desertion, rejecting pleas for clemency from the soldiers' regimental commander. Jackson's goal was to maintain discipline in a volunteer army whose homes were under threat of enemy occupation.K. M. L. \\"Stonewall's Rush to Judgment,\\" Civil War Times (2010) 49#2 pp 51+.Ella Lonn, Desertion during the Civil War (1928). Historians of the Civil War have emphasized how soldiers from poor families deserted because they were urgently needed at home. Local pressures mounted as Union forces occupied more and more of Confederate territory, putting more and more families at risk of hardship. One Confederate officer at the time noted, \\"The deserters belong almost entirely to the poorest class of non-slave-holders whose labor is indispensable to the daily support of their families\\" and that \\"When the father, husband or son is forced into the service, the suffering at home with them is inevitable. It is not in the nature of these men to remain quiet in the ranks under such circumstances.\\" Some soldiers also deserted from ideological motivations. A growing threat to the solidarity of the Confederacy was dissatisfaction in the Appalachian mountain districts caused by lingering unionism and a distrust of the power wielded by the slave-holding class. Many of their soldiers deserted, returned home, and formed a military force that fought off regular army units trying to punish them. North Carolina lost nearly a quarter of its soldiers (24,122) to desertion. The state provided more soldiers per capita than any other Confederate state, and had more deserters as well.Scott King-Owen, \\"Conditional Confederates: Absenteeism among Western North Carolina Soldiers, 1861‚Äì1865.\\" Civil War History 2011; 57(4): 349‚Äì379. online Young Mark Twain deserted the army long before he became a famous writer and lecturer, but he often commented upon the episode comically. Author Neil Schmitz has examined the deep unease Twain felt about losing his honor, his fear of facing death as a soldier, and his rejection of a Southern identity as a professional author. Organization CSA M1857 Napoleon Artillery Piece Because of the destruction of any central repository of records in Richmond in 1865 and the comparatively poor record-keeping of the time, there can be no definitive number that represents the strength of the Confederate States Army. Estimates range from 500,000 to 2,000,000 men who were involved at any time during the war. Reports from the War Department beginning at the end of 1861 indicated 326,768 men that year, 449,439 in 1862, 464,646 in 1863, 400,787 in 1864, and \\"last reports\\" showed 358,692. Estimates of enlistments throughout the war range from 1,227,890 to 1,406,180. The following calls for men were issued: * March 6, 1861: 100,000 volunteers and militia * January 23, 1862: 400,000 volunteers and militia * April 16, 1862, the First Conscription Act: conscripted white men ages 18 to 35 for the duration of hostilities * September 27, 1862, the Second Conscription Act: expanded the age range to 18 to 45, with implementation beginning on July 15, 1863 * February 17, 1864, the Third Conscription Act: ages 17 to 50 * March 13, 1865, authorized up to 300,000 African American troops but was never fully implemented. The CSA was initially a (strategically) defensive army, and many soldiers were resentful when Lee led the Army of Northern Virginia in an invasion of the North in the Antietam Campaign. =Command= General Robert E. Lee, the Confederacy's most famous general The army did not have a formal overall military commander, or general in chief, until late in the war. The Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, himself a former U.S. Army officer and U.S. Secretary of War, served as commander-in-chief and provided the strategic direction for Confederate land and naval forces. The following men had varying degrees of control: * Robert E. Lee was \\"charged with the conduct of military operations in the armies of the Confederacy\\" from March 13 to May 31, 1862. He was referred to as Davis' military adviser but exercised broad control over the strategic and logistical aspects of the Army, a role similar in nature to the current Chief of Staff of the United States Army. On June 1, he assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia, which was considered the most important of all the Confederate field armies. * Braxton Bragg was similarly \\"charged with the conduct of military operations in the armies of the Confederacy\\" from February 24, 1864 (after he was relieved of field command following the Battle of Chattanooga) to January 31, 1865. This role was a military advisory position under Davis. * Lee was formally designated general in chief by an act of Congress (January 23, 1865) and served in this capacity from January 31 to April 9, 1865. The lack of centralized control was a strategic weakness for the Confederacy, and there are only a few examples of its armies acting in concert across multiple theaters to achieve a common objective. One instance occurred in late 1862 with Lee's invasion of Maryland, coincident with two other actions: Bragg's invasion of Kentucky and Earl Van Dorn's advance against Corinth, Mississippi. All three initiatives were unsuccessful, however. Georgia Governor Joseph E. Brown was an extreme case of a Southern States Rights advocate asserting control over Confederate soldiers: he defied the Confederate government's wartime policies and resisted the military draft. Believing that local troops should be used only for the defense of Georgia, Brown tried to stop Colonel Francis Bartow from taking Georgia troops out of the state to the First Battle of Bull Run. Many of the Confederacy's senior military leaders (including Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, James Longstreet) and even President Jefferson Davis, were former U.S. Army and, in smaller numbers, U.S. Navy officers who had been opposed to, disapproved of, or were at least unenthusiastic about secession, but resigned their U.S. commissions upon hearing that their states had left the Union. They felt that they had no choice but to help defend their homes. President Abraham Lincoln was exasperated to hear of such men who professed to love their country but were willing to fight against it. =Personnel organization= As in the U.S. Army, the Confederate Army's soldiers were organized by military specialty. The combat arms included infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Although fewer soldiers might comprise a squad or platoon, the smallest infantry maneuver unit in the Army was a company of 100 soldiers. Ten companies were organized into an infantry regiment, which theoretically had 1,000 men. In reality, as disease, desertions and casualties took their toll, and the common practice of sending replacements to form new regiments took hold, most regiments were greatly reduced in strength. By the mid-war, most regiments averaged 300‚Äì400 men, with Confederate units slightly smaller on average than their U.S. counterparts. For example, at the pivotal Battle of Chancellorsville, the average U.S. Army infantry regiment's strength was 433 men, versus 409 for Confederate infantry regiments. Rough unit sizes for CSA combat units during the war:The Civil War Book of Lists, p. 56 * Corps - 24,000 to 28,000 * Division - 6,000 to 14,000 * Brigade - 800 to 1,700 * Regiment - 350 to 400 * Company ‚Äì 35 to 40 Regiments, which were the basic units of army organization through which soldiers were supplied and deployed, were raised by individual states. They were generally referred by number and state, for example 1st Texas, 12th Virginia. To the extent the word \\"battalion\\" was used to describe a military unit, it referred to a multi- company task force of a regiment or a near-regimental size unit. Throughout the war, the Confederacy raised the equivalent of 1,010 regiments in all branches, including militias, versus 2,050 regiments for the U.S. Army. Four regiments usually formed a brigade, although as the number of men in many regiments became greatly reduced, especially later in the war, more than four were often assigned to a brigade. Occasionally, regiments would be transferred between brigades. Two to four brigades usually formed a division. Two to four divisions usually formed a corps. Two to four corps usually formed an army. Occasionally, a single corps might operate independently as if it were a small army. The Confederate States Army consisted of several field armies, named after their primary area of operation. The largest Confederate field army was the Army of Northern Virginia, whose surrender at Appomattox Courthouse in 1865 marked the end of major combat operations in the US Civil War. Companies were commanded by captains and had two or more lieutenants. Regiments were commanded by colonels. Lieutenant colonels were second in command. At least one major was next in command. Brigades were commanded by brigadier generals although casualties or other attrition sometimes meant that brigades would be commanded by senior colonels or even a lower grade officer. Barring the same type of circumstances which might leave a lower grade officer in temporary command, divisions were commanded by major generals and corps were commanded by lieutenant generals. A few corps commanders were never confirmed as lieutenant generals and exercised corps command for varying periods as major generals. Armies of more than one corps were commanded by (full) generals.

This was a decision made early in the conflict. The Confederate Congress initially made the rank of brigadier general the highest rank. As the war progressed, the other general-officer ranks were quickly added, but no insignia for them was created. (Robert E. Lee was a notable exception to this. He chose to wear the rank insignia of a colonel.) Only seven men achieved the rank of (full) general; the highest- ranking (earliest date of rank) was Samuel Cooper, Adjutant General and Inspector General of the Confederate States Army. Officers' uniforms bore a braided design on the sleeves and kepi, the number of adjacent strips (and therefore the width of the lines of the design) denoting rank. The color of the piping and kepi denoted the military branch. The braid was sometimes left off by officers since it made them conspicuous targets. The kepi was rarely used, the common slouch hat being preferred for its practicality in the Southern climate. { border=\\"1\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"margin:auto; width:100%;\\" - !colspan=11 Enlisted rank structure - !Sergeant Major !Quartermaster Sergeant !Ordnance Sergeant !First Sergeant - !80px !80px !80px !80px - !Sergeant !Corporal !Musician !Private - !80px !80px !no insignia !no insignia } Branch colors were used for the color of chevrons‚Äîblue for infantry, yellow for cavalry, and red for artillery. This could differ with some units, however, depending on available resources or the unit commander's desire. Cavalry regiments from Texas, for example, often used red insignia and at least one Texas infantry regiment used black. The CSA differed from many contemporaneous armies in that all officers under the rank of brigadier general were elected by the soldiers under their command. The Confederate Congress authorized the awarding of medals for courage and good conduct on October 13, 1862, but wartime difficulties prevented the procurement of the needed medals. To avoid postponing recognition for their valor, those nominated for the awards had their names placed on a Roll of Honor, which would be read at the first dress parade after its receipt and be published in at least one newspaper in each state. =Armies and prominent leaders= The C.S. Army was composed of independent armies and military departments that were constituted, renamed, and disbanded as needs arose, particularly in reaction to offensives launched by the United States. These major units were generally named after states or geographic regions (in comparison to the U.S. Army's custom of naming armies after rivers). Armies were usually commanded by full generals (there were seven in the C.S. Army) or lieutenant generals.

Stuart, Gideon Pillow, A. P. Hill, John B. Gordon. Supply and logistics Island No. 10 and taken at POW Camp Douglas (Chicago); photograph possibly by D. F. Brandon The supply situation for most Confederate armies was dismal, even when they were victorious on the battlefield. The central government was short of money so each state government had to supply its regiments. The lack of central authority and the ineffective railroads, combined with the frequent unwillingness or inability of Southern state governments to provide adequate funding, were key factors in the Confederate army's demise. The Confederacy early on lost control of most of its major river and ocean ports to capture or blockade. The road system was poor, and it relied more and more on a heavily overburdened railroad system. U.S. forces destroyed track, engines, cars, bridges and telegraph lines as often as possible, knowing that new equipment was unavailable to the Confederacy.George Edgar Turner, Victory rode the rails: the strategic place of the railroads in the Civil War (1972) Occasional raids into the North were designed to bring back money and supplies. In 1864, the Confederates burned down Chambersburg, a Pennsylvania city they had raided twice in the years before, due to its failure to pay an extortion demand. As a result of severe supply problems, as well as the lack of textile factories in the Confederacy and the successful U.S. naval blockade of Southern ports, the typical Confederate soldier was rarely able to wear the standard regulation uniform, particularly as the war progressed. While on the march or in parade formation, Confederate armies often displayed a wide array of dress, ranging from faded, patched-together regulation uniforms; rough, homespun uniforms colored with homemade dyes such as butternut (a yellow-brown color), and even soldiers in a hodgepodge of civilian clothing. After a successful battle, it was not unusual for victorious Confederate troops to procure U.S. Army uniform parts from captured supplies and dead U.S. soldiers; this would occasionally cause confusion in later battles and skirmishes.Steven G. Collins, \\"System in the South: John W. Mallet, Josiah Gorgas, and uniform production at the confederate ordnance department.\\" Technology and culture (1999) 40#3 pp: 517‚Äì544 in Project MUSE. Individual states were expected to supply their soldiers, which led to a lack of uniformity. Some states (such as North Carolina) were able to better supply their soldiers, while other states (such as Texas) were unable for various reasons to adequately supply their troops as the war continued. Furthermore, each state often had its uniform regulations and insignia, which meant that the \\"standard\\" Confederate uniform often featured a variety of differences based on the state the soldier came from. For example, uniforms for North Carolina regiments often featured a colored strip of cloth on their shoulders to designate what part of the service the soldier was in. Confederate soldiers also frequently suffered from inadequate supplies of shoes, tents, and other gear, and would be forced to innovate and make do with whatever they could scrounge from the local countryside. While Confederate officers were generally better-supplied and were normally able to wear a regulation officer's uniform, they often chose to share other hardships ‚Äì such as the lack of adequate food ‚Äì with their troops. Confederate troops marching south on N Market Street, Frederick, Maryland, during the Civil War Confederate soldiers were also faced with inadequate food rations, especially as the war progressed. There was plenty of meat in the Confederacy. The unsolvable problem was shipping it to the armies, especially when Lee's army in Virginia was at the end of a long, tenuous supply line. The United States victory at Vicksburg in 1863 shut off supplies from Texas and the west. By 1863 Confederate generals such as Robert E. Lee often spent as much time and effort searching for food for their men as they did in planning strategy and tactics. Individual commanders often had to \\"beg, borrow or steal\\" food and ammunition from whatever sources were available, including captured U.S. depots and encampments, and private citizens regardless of their loyalties. Lee's campaign against Gettysburg and southern Pennsylvania (a rich agricultural region) was driven in part by his desperate need of supplies, especially food.Larry J. Daniel, Soldiering in the Army of Tennessee: A Portrait of Life in a Confederate Army (2003) ch 4 on inadequate rations General Sherman's total warfare reduced the ability of the South to produce food and ship it to the armies or its cities. Coupled with the U.S. blockade of all ports the devastation of plantations, farms and railroads meant the Confederacy increasingly lost the capacity to feed its soldiers and civilians. Native Americans and the Confederate army Native Americans served in both the United States and Confederate military during the American Civil War. They fought knowing they might jeopardize their freedom, unique cultures, and ancestral lands if they ended up on the losing side of the Civil War. During the Civil War 28,693 Native Americans served in the U.S. and Confederate armies, participating in battles such as Pea Ridge, Second Manassas, Antietam, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and in Federal assaults on Petersburg. Many Native American tribes, such as the Creek, the Cherokee, and the Choctaw, were slaveholders themselves, and thus, found a political and economic commonality with the Confederacy. At the beginning of the war, Albert Pike was appointed as Confederate envoy to Native Americans. In this capacity he negotiated several treaties, one such treaty was the Treaty with Choctaws and Chickasaws conducted in July 1861. The treaty covered sixty-four terms covering many subjects like Choctaw and Chickasaw nation sovereignty, Confederate States of America citizenship possibilities, and an entitled delegate in the House of Representatives of the Confederate States of America. The Cherokee, Choctaw, Seminole, Catawba, and Creek tribes were the only tribes to fight on the Confederate side. The Confederacy wanted to recruit Indians east of the Mississippi River in 1862, so they opened up a recruiting camp in Mobile, Alabama \\"at the foot of Stone Street\\". The Mobile Advertiser and Register would advertise for a chance at military service. =Cherokee= A Cherokee Confederates reunion in New Orleans, 1903 Stand Watie, along with a few Cherokee, sided with the Confederate army, in which he was made colonel and commanded a battalion of Cherokee. Reluctantly, on October 7, 1861, Chief Ross signed a treaty transferring all obligations due to the Cherokee from the United States to the Confederate States. In the treaty, the Cherokee were guaranteed protection, rations of food, livestock, tools, and other goods, as well as a delegate to the Confederate Congress at Richmond. In exchange, the Cherokee would furnish ten companies of mounted men, and allow the construction of military posts and roads within the Cherokee Nation. However, no Indian regiment was to be called on to fight outside Indian Territory. As a result of the Treaty, the 2nd Cherokee Mounted Rifles, led by Col. John Drew, was formed. Following the Battle of Pea Ridge, Arkansas, March 7‚Äì8, 1862, Drew's Mounted Rifles defected to the United States forces in Kansas, where they joined the Indian Home Guard. In the summer of 1862, U.S. troops captured Chief Ross, who was paroled and spent the remainder of the war in Washington and Philadelphia proclaiming Cherokee loyalty to the United States Army. William Holland Thomas, the only white chief of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, recruited hundreds of Cherokees for the Confederate army, particularly for Thomas' Legion. The Legion, raised in September 1862, fought until the end of the War. =Choctaw= CSA Choctaw Confederate battalions were formed in Indian Territory and later in Mississippi in support of the southern cause. The Choctaws, who were expecting support from the Confederates, got little. Webb Garrison, a Civil War historian, describes their response: when Confederate Brigadier General Albert Pike authorized the raising of regiments during the fall of 1860, Seminoles, Creeks, Chickasaws, Choctaws, and Cherokees responded with considerable enthusiasm. Their zeal for the Confederate cause, however, began to evaporate when they found that neither arms nor pay had been arranged for them. A disgusted officer later acknowledged that \\"with the exception of a partial supply for the Choctaw regiment, no tents, clothing, or camp, and garrison equipage was furnished to any of them.\\" African Americans and the Confederate Army An 1862 illustration showing Confederates escorting kidnapped African American civilians south into slavery. A similar instance occurred in Pennsylvania when the Army of Northern Virginia invaded it in 1863 to fight the U.S. at Gettysburg. An 1862 illustration of a Confederate officer forcing slaves at gunpoint to fire a cannon at U.S. soldiers in battle. A similar instance occurred at the first Battle of Bull Run, where slaves were forced by the Confederates to load and fire a cannon at U.S. forces. An 1864 cartoon lampooning the Confederacy's deliberating on the use of black soldiers, showing them defecting en masse towards U.S. lines if such proposals were adopted. \\"Marlboro\\", an African-American body servant to a white Confederate soldier With so many white males conscripted into the army and roughly 40% of its population unfree, the work required to maintain a functioning society in the Confederacy ended up largely on the backs of slaves. Even Georgian governor Joseph E. Brown noted that \\"the country and the army are mainly dependent upon slave labor for support.\\" African American slave labor was used in a wide variety of logistical support roles for the Confederacy, from infrastructure and mining, to teamster and medical roles such as hospital attendants and nurses.Levine 2005, pp. 62‚Äì63,Jaime Amanda Martinez, Confederate Slave Impressment in the Upper South (U. North Carolina Press, 2013) =Using slaves as soldiers= The Confederacy did not allow African Americans to join the army, including both free blacks and slaves. The idea of arming the Confederacy's slaves for use as soldiers was speculated on from the onset of the war, but such proposals were not seriously considered by Jefferson Davis or others in the Confederate administration until late in the war when severe manpower shortages were faced.Levine 2005, pp. 17‚Äì18 Gary Gallagher says, \\"When Lee publicly advocated arming slaves in early 1865, he did so as a desperate expedient that might prolong Southern military resistance.\\" After acrimonious debate the Confederate Congress agreed in March 1865. The war was nearly over by then and very few slaves ended up being enlisted before the Confederate armies all surrendered. Opposition from Confederates As early as November 1864, some Confederates knew that the chance of securing victory against the U.S. was slim. Despite lacking foreign assistance and recognition and facing slim chances of victory against superior U.S. assets, Confederate newspapers such as the Georgian Atlanta Southern Confederacy continued to maintain their position and oppose the idea of armed black men in the Confederate army, even late in the war as January 1865. They stated that it was incongruous with the Confederacy's goals and views regarding African Americans and slavery. The Georgian newspaper opined that using black men as soldiers would be an embarrassment to Confederates and their children, saying that although African Americans should be used for slave labor, they should not be used as armed soldiers, opining that: Prominent Confederates such as R. M. T. Hunter and Georgian Democrat Howell Cobb opposed arming slaves, saying that it was \\"suicidal\\" and would run contrary to the Confederacy's ideology. Opposing such a move, Cobb stated that African Americans were untrustworthy and innately lacked the qualities to make good soldiers, and that using them would cause many Confederates to quit the army.Howell Cobb letter to James A. Seddon January 1865, The overwhelming support most Confederates had for maintaining black slavery was the primary cause of their strong opposition to using African Americans as armed soldiers. Maintaining the institution of slavery was the primary goal of the Confederacy's existence, and thus, using their slaves as soldiers was incongruous with that goal. According to historian Paul D. Escott: Though most Confederates were opposed to the idea of using black soldiers, a small number suggested the idea. An acrimonious and controversial debate was raised by a letter from Patrick Cleburne urging the Confederacy to raise black soldiers by offering emancipation; Jefferson Davis refused to consider the proposal and issued instructions forbidding the matter from being discussed. It would not be until Robert E. Lee wrote the Confederate Congress urging them that the idea would take serious traction. On March 13, 1865, the Confederate Congress passed General Order 14 by a single vote in the Confederate senate, and Jefferson Davis signed the order into law. The order was issued March 23, but as it was late in the war, only a few African American companies were raised in the Richmond area before the town was captured by the U.S. Army and placed back under U.S. control. According to historian James M. McPherson in 1994, \\"no black soldiers fought in the Confederate army, unless they were passing as white. He noted that some Confederates brought along \\"their body servants, who in many cases had grown up with them\\" and that \\"on occasion some of those body servants were known to have picked up a rifle and fought. But there was no official recruitment of black soldiers in the Confederate army until the very end of the war...\\" He continued, \\"But Appomattox came only a few weeks later, and none of these men were ever put in uniform to fight.\\" =Treatment of black civilians= In some cases, the Confederates forced their African American slaves to fire upon U.S. soldiers at gunpoint, such as at the first Battle of Bull Run. According to John Parker, a slave who was forced by the Confederates to fight Union soldiers, \\"Our masters tried all they could to make us fight ... They promised to give us our freedom and money besides, but none of us believed them; we only fought because we had to.\\" Parker stated that had he been given an opportunity, he would have turned against his Confederate captors, and \\"could do it with pleasure\\". According to abolitionist Henry Highland Garnet in 1862, he had met a slave who \\"had unwillingly fought on the side of Rebellion\\", but the slave had since defected to \\"the side of Union and universal liberty\\". During the Siege of Yorktown (1862), The United States Army's elite sniper unit, the 1st United States Sharpshooters, was devastatingly effective at shooting Confederate artillerymen defending the city. In response, some Confederate artillery crews started forcing slaves to load the cannons. \\"They forced their negroes to load their cannon,\\" reported a U.S. officer. \\"They shot them if they would not load the cannon, and we shot them if they did.\\" In other cases, under explicit orders from their commanders, Confederate armies would often forcibly kidnap free African American civilians during their incursions into Union territory, sending them south into Confederate territory and thus enslaving them, as was the case with the Army of Northern Virginia when it invaded Pennsylvania in 1863.David G. Smith, \\"Race and Retaliation: The Capture of African Americans During the Gettysburg Campaign.\\" in Peter Wallenstein and Bertram Wyatt-Brown, ed., Virginia's Civil War (2004) pp: 122‚Äì37. onlineTed Alexander, \\"'A Regular Slave Hunt': The Army of Northern Virginia and Black Civilians in the Gettysburg Campaign,\\" North & South 4 (September 2001): 82‚Äì89 =Treatment of black prisoners of war= The usage of black men as soldiers by the Union, combined with Abraham Lincoln's issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, profoundly angered the Confederacy, with the Confederates calling it uncivilized. As a response, in May 1863 the Confederacy passed a law demanding \\"full and ample retaliation\\" against the United States, stating that any black person captured in \\"arms against the Confederate States\\" or giving aid and comfort to their enemies would be turned over to state authorities, where they could be tried as slave insurrectionists; a capital offense punishable with a sentence of death.Williams, George W., History of the Negro Race in America from 1619 to 1880: Negros as Slaves, as Soldiers, and as Citizens, vol. II, New York: G.P. Putnam Son's, 1883, pp. 351‚Äì352. However, Confederate authorities feared retaliation, and consequently no black prisoner was ever put on trial and executed. James McPherson states that \\"Confederate troops sometimes murdered black soldiers and their officers as they tried to surrender. In most cases, though, Confederate officers returned captured black soldiers to slavery or put them to hard labor on southern fortifications.\\" African American soldiers who served in the United States Colored Troops were often singled out by the Confederates and suffered extra violence when captured by them. They were often the victims of battlefield massacres and atrocities at the hands of the Confederates, most notably at Fort Pillow in Tennessee and at the Battle of the Crater in Virginia. The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography 98, no. 2 (The Trumpet Unblown: The Old Dominion in the Civil War), (1990), pp. 242‚Äì43. Prisoner exchanges with the United States The Confederate law declaring black U.S. soldiers to be insurrectionist slaves, combined with the Confederacy's discriminatory mistreatment of captured black U.S. soldiers, became a stumbling block for prisoner exchanges between the United States and the Confederacy, as the U.S. government in the Lieber Code officially objected to the Confederacy's discriminatory mistreatment of prisoners of war on basis of color. The Republican Party's platform of the 1864 presidential election reflected this view, as it too condemned the Confederacy's discriminatory mistreatment of captured black U.S. soldiers. According to the authors of Liberty, Equality, Power, \\"Expressing outrage at this treatment, in 1863 the Lincoln administration suspended the exchange of prisoners until the Confederacy agree to treat white and black prisoners alike. The Confederacy refused.\\" Statistics and size Julian Scott's 1873 painting, Surrender of a Confederate Soldier Incomplete and destroyed records make an accurate count of the number of men who served in the Confederate army impossible. Historians provide estimates of the actual number of individual Confederate soldiers between 750,000 and 1,000,000 men.Long, E. B. The Civil War Day by Day: An Almanac, 1861‚Äì1865. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1971. . p. 705 The exact number is unknown. Since these figures include estimates of the total number of individual soldiers who served in each army at any time during the war, they do not represent the size of the armies at any given date. Confederate casualty figures are as incomplete and unreliable as the figures on the number of Confederate soldiers. The best estimates of the number of deaths of Confederate soldiers appear to be about 94,000 killed or mortally wounded in battle, 164,000 deaths from disease and between 26,000 and 31,000 deaths in Union prison camps. In contrast, about 25,000 Union soldiers died as a result of accidents, drowning, murder, killed after capture, suicide, execution for various crimes, execution by the Confederates (64), sunstroke, other and not stated. Confederate casualties for all these reasons are unavailable. Since some Confederate soldiers would have died for these reasons, more total deaths and total casualties for the Confederacy must have occurred. One estimate of the Confederate wounded, which is considered incomplete, is 194,026; another is 226,000. At the end of the war 174,223 men of the Confederate forces surrendered to the Union Army.Long, 1971, p. 711 Compared to the Union Army at the time, the Confederate army was not very ethnically diverse. Ninety-one percent of Confederate soldiers were native-born white men and only 9% were foreign-born white men, Irishmen being the largest group with others including Germans, French, Mexicans, and British. A small number of Asian men were forcibly inducted into the Confederate army against their will when they arrived in Louisiana from overseas.

Abitibi- Consolidated was formed from the merger of Abitibi-Price Inc. and Stone Consolidated Corp. on May 29, 1997; the Company merged with Bowater in 2007 to form AbitibiBowater. Operations A network of 19 paper mills, 20 sawmills, 4 remanufacturing facilities and 2 engineered wood facilities, located in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, supplied publishers, printers, building products distributors and housing manufacturers in over 70 countries. It had approximately 12,500 employees. A global leader in newsprint, commercial printing papers and wood products, the Company saw combined revenues of $4.85 billion in 2006. Number one in Canada in terms of total certified woodlands, Abitibi-Consolidated was also one of the largest recyclers of newspapers and magazines, serving 21 metropolitan areas in North America and the United Kingdom. In addition, the Company had significant hydroelectric generating assets in eastern Canada, which provided a cost advantage for the associated production facilities and was an extension into the energy sector. History =Price Brothers= Price Brothers & Company Limited was a lumber firm from Quebec founded in 1820 as William Price Company by William Price. Following the death of Price Sr sons William Evan Price and Evans John Price took over and the firm became Price Brothers and Company Limited. In 1910 the company became Price Brothers Limited as (Sir) William Price III took control of the family firm. After Sir William's death in 1924, his sons John Herbert and Arthur Clifford Price assumed control. In the 1930s the Price family lost control and the firm was sold. Price Brothers and Company was renamed Price Limited in 1966 and was acquired by Abitibi Power and Paper Co. and became Abitibi-Price in 1974. When Abitibi-Price became Abitibi-Consolidated in 1997, the Price name finally disappeared. =Abitibi= Abitibi Pulp and Paper Co. Ltd. was founded in 1912 at Iroquois Falls, Ontario on the Abitibi River by Frank Harris Anson. The following February, the company name was changed to Abitibi Power and Paper Co. Ltd. to reflect the power generation business it created through the need to build a dam to generate electricity for its mill. The company expanded to other locations in Ontario where it also built damsDams and operated hydro electric power stations. Wherever the company built a mill, a new town sprang up around it and it even built radio stations such as CFCH in Iroquois Falls to serve these remote new communities. The company acquired other small lumber operations and grew to become a major force in the North American newsprint business but the Great Depression forced the company to file for bankruptcy protection on September 10, 1932. A Royal commission was held to enquire into the company's affairs, with its report issued in March 1941. It remained under the control of the Court-appointed Receiver until 1946, the longest such receivership in Canadian history. Emerging from bankruptcy, the company prospered in the post-World War II industrial boom and in 1965 changed its name to the Abitibi Paper Company Ltd. In 1974, Abitibi purchased a controlling interest in the Price Brothers & Company Limited which had extensive operations in the Province of Quebec and whose vast forestry business dated back to the William Price Company established in Quebec City in 1820. The merger of Abitibi and the Price Brothers made it the world's biggest newsprint producer. In 1979, the corporate name was changed to Abitibi-Price Inc. and in 1981 it was taken over by Olympia and York Developments Ltd. In 1982, Abitibi-Price bought out the Hilroy companies, whose founder, Roy Hill, had been a member of the Abitibi board of directors and had died in 1978.hilroy.ca: \\"About Hilroy\\" With the purchase of Hilroy, Abitibi-Price became the premiere vertically-integrated supplier of office stationery in the Canadian market. The collapse of Olympia and York in 1992 resulted in the consortium of banks being forced to take control of Abitibi-Price Inc. for a short time until they sold it through a public share issue in 1994. The share issue also entailed the divestment and sale of Hilroy to the Mead Corporation. =Consolidated= The Bathurst Power and Paper Company Ltd. built a mill in Bathurst, New Brunswick in 1914. Majority control of the company was obtained in the late 1930s by Arthur J. Nesbitt and his partner Peter A. T. Thomson through their holding company, Power Corporation of Canada. In the early 1960s, Power Corporation bought the Consolidated Paper Company. When Paul Desmarais acquired control of Power Corporation in 1968, the two companies were merged to become Consolidated-Bathurst Inc, which, in 1989, was sold to Stone Container Corporation of Chicago, Illinois who renamed it Stone Consolidated Inc. =Acquisitions= In 2000, Abitibi-Consolidated acquired a majority shareholding in Canadian integrated forest products company Donohue Inc.  Merger with Bowater On January 29, 2007, Bowater and Abitibi- Consolidated announced they would be merging to create AbitibiBowater. The merger created the third largest pulp and paper company in North America, and the eighth largest in the world. Following the merger, Abitibi-Consolidated was rated B1, B+ and B+ by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings respectively.

It is a part of the North Shore Mountains, rising to the north from the shores of Burrard Inlet and Indian Arm to a summit of above the Indian River and Deep Cove neighbourhoods. Mount Seymour is most commonly identified for its ski area of the same name, and as a popular hiking area. It is named in honour of Frederick Seymour, second governor of the Colony of British Columbia. The name is used to refer to the ridge although the main summit is one of several, and is also known as Third Peak. History The mountain opened for skiing in 1938 under the ownership of the Swedish emigrant, Harald Enqvist, with a cafeteria and ski rental. A few years later, in 1949, the Government of British Columbia bought the ski area. The Government did not have the experience to run a ski area, so, they issued Mr. Enqvist the first Park Use Permit to operate the area. When the permit expired in 1951, the government found a concessionaire, who was put in charge of running the lifts, ski school and cafeteria. The name Enqvist was later spelled Enquist giving name to \\"The Enquist Lodge\\" and \\"Enquist Tube Park\\" among other facilities. The government retained overall ownership until 1984, when it privatized its operation as part of a cost-cutting measure. The ski area has been run by the Wood family since 1984. They installed the Lodge chairlift in 1986 and the Brockton chairlift in the early 1990s. Starting in the 2010s, the mountain has been more aggressively upgraded. The original Mystery Peak chairlift was removed in 2012 and replaced with a high-speed quad, while the Goldie rope tow was replaced with a magic carpet. The original Mystery Peak chairlift, early 2000s. On January 19, 2014, Tim Jones died while coming down from the North Shore Rescue team cabin on Mount Seymour. Tim had saved many lives on the mountain over the years. Shortly after his passing a community movement was formed to name the yet unnamed Second Peak of Seymour after him. This movement has gained a lot of traction in the community and has resulted in Bivouac.com changing the name on their mountain database. Vegetation Recreation Facilities The Mount Seymour ski area has four lifts, the Mystery Peak Express high-speed quad chairlift, Brockton and Lodge double chairlifts, and the Goldie Lake covered magic carpet. Another double chairlift, the Ridge Chair, was destroyed in a windstorm in 1998, and is currently still standing, though gradually rotting away. Another beginner lift, the Goldie Ropetow was removed in 2011 replaced by the magic carpet. The area offers of vertical drop and about of annual snowfall. Skiing and snowboarding are available on 40 marked trails and many unmarked routes. The longest trail is long (Unicorn) and 18 of the trails have night lighting. Four additional terrain parks exist for freestyle activities. Terrain has also been developed for snowtubing and tobogganing. Guided and unguided snowshoeing takes place on a separate network of maintained trails. Backcountry access for snowshoeing and camping is permitted. Mount Seymour's Enquist Cabin, located in the Tube Park Parking Lot was destroyed in a fire in the late spring of 2005. The cabin was available for rental and was the home of the Mount Seymour Ski Club. This cabin has been rebuilt, and has been in operation since the beginning of the 2010/2011 season. Snow depth Mount Seymour has three weather stations: one at the bottom of the Mystery Peak Chairlift, one near tower 9 of the Mystery Peak Chairlift, and one just below Brockton Point which is the top lift station of the Brockton Chairlift. Except for the unusually warm winter of 2014-2015, there is usually a snow depth of or more at the Brockton weather station. BCRFC historical records (from 1960 to 1989) report that Mount Seymour's average snow base has been on January 1, increasing through winter and spring to on May 1. Broadcasting Several Vancouver-area broadcasters use transmission towers located on Mount Seymour. On 16 December 1953, the first television broadcast in Western Canada was transmitted from this site by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's CBUT Channel 2. The CBC broadcasting site on Mount Seymour was both the first television broadcasting site in Western Canada and the first high elevation/mountain top broadcasting site in Canada. =FM stations= * CBU-2-FM 88.1 (CBC Radio One) * CBUX-FM 90.9 (ICI Musique) * CKYE-FM 93.1 (Red FM) * CJJR-FM 93.7 (JR-FM) * CFBT-FM 94.5 (Virgin Radio 94.5) * CKZZ-FM 95.3 (Z 95.3) * CHKG-FM 96.1 (Fairchild Radio) * CJAX-FM 96.9 (Jack FM) * CBUF-FM 97.7 (ICI Radio-Canada Premi√®re) * CFOX-FM 99.3 (99.3 The Fox) * CFMI-FM 101.1 (Rock 101) * CKPK-FM 102.7 (The Peak) * CHQM-FM 103.5 (103.5 QM/FM) * CHHR-FM 104.3 (LG 104.3 FM) * CKKS-FM-2 104.9 (Kiss Radio) * CBU-FM 105.7 (CBC Radio 2) * CKAV-FM-2 106.3 (Aboriginal Voices Radio) =TV stations= * CBUT-DT (CBC): UHF 43 (digital) * CHAN-DT (Global): UHF 22 (digital) * CIVI-DT-2 (rebroadcaster of CIVI-TV, CTV Two): UHF 17 (digital) * CBUFT-DT (Radio-Canada): UHF 26 (digital) * CIVT-DT (CTV): UHF 32 (digital) * CHNM-DT (OMNI): UHF 20 (digital) * CKVU-DT (\\"Citytv\\"): UHF 33 (digital) Filming location Due to its easy road access and ample parking lots, Mount Seymour is often used as a filming location.

Most species make little use of webs, instead spending their lives as hunting spiders on plants. Many species frequent flowers in particular, ambushing pollinators, much as crab spiders do. They tend to tolerate members of their own species more than most spiders do, and at least one species has been identified as exhibiting social behaviour. Description and habits There are several genera of Oxyopidae and they differ in their habits and adaptations. Most of them have large spiny bristles on their legs and in many species the bristles form almost a basket-like structure that may assist in confining the prey that they grasp, and protect the spider from its struggles. Most Oxyopes and Hamataliwa species are small to medium in size; they tend to be drab ambush hunters; depending to some extent on the season, some occupy flowers, ambushing pollinating insects. In this they resemble the crab spiders (Thomisidae) in behaviour. Others crouch in wait, camouflaged on plant stalks or bark. Peucetia species on the other hand, commonly are larger. They are rangy and their camouflage is vivid green, adapted to hunting or hiding among foliage. Lynx spiders, in spite of being largely ambush hunters, are very speedy runners and leapers, alert and with good vision. Except when defending egg purses, many tend to flee rapidly when approached by predators or large creatures such as humans. They tend not to be very aggressive towards other members of their own species, and sometimes meet casually in small groups. Possibly as an extreme example, at least one member of the genus Tapinillus is remarkable as being one of the few social spiders, living in colonies with communal feeding, cooperative brood care, and generational overlap.Aviles, Leticia : Social behaviour in a web-building lynx spider, Tapinillus spp. (Araneae, Oxyopidae) (1994) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 52 (2), pp. 163-176. A Peucetia female, showing the eye pattern and the \\"flat-faced\\" appearance typical of the Oxyopidae. In this species the leg bristles are only moderately developed. Oxyopidae in general rely on keen eyesight in stalking, chasing, or ambushing prey, and also in avoiding enemies. As with many other families of spiders, the arrangement of their eyes is typical of the family and is an important aid in identifying them as members of the family. Six of the eight eyes of Oxyopid spiders are arranged in a hexagon-like pattern, more or less on a prominent hump on the front upper corner of the prosoma. The other two eyes are smaller, less conspicuous, and generally are situated in front of and below the other six. The basal parts of the chelicerae of most species are large, vertical and parallel, which combine with the bluff front end, a \\"high forehead\\" to the prosoma, to give most species a peculiar \\"flat-faced\\" appearance. Some members of the genus Oxyopes are abundant enough to be important in agricultural systems as biological control agents. This is especially true of the striped lynx spider (Oxyopes salticus). Their net value in agriculture has been disputed however, on the grounds of their predation of pollinators.Weems, H. V. Jr. and Whitcomb, W. H.

In other words, every supergroup carries a natural group structure, but there may be more than one way to structure a given group as a supergroup. A supergroup is like a Lie group in that there is a well defined notion of smooth function defined on them. However the functions may have even and odd parts. Moreover, a supergroup has a super Lie algebra which plays a role similar to that of a Lie algebra for Lie groups in that they determine most of the representation theory and which is the starting point for classification. Details More formally, a Lie supergroup is a supermanifold G together with a multiplication morphism \\\\mu :G \\\\times G\\\\rightarrow G, an inversion morphism i : G \\\\rightarrow G and a unit morphism e: 1 \\\\rightarrow G which makes G a group object in the category of supermanifolds. This means that, formulated as commutative diagrams, the usual associativity and inversion axioms of a group continue to hold. Since every manifold is a super manifold, a Lie supergroup generalises the notion of a Lie group. There are many possible supergroups. The ones of most interest in theoretical physics are the ones which extend the Poincar√© group or the conformal group. Of particular interest are the orthosymplectic groups Osp(MN)(MN) is pronounced \\"M vertical bar N.\\" M denotes the bosonic dimensions and N denotes the Grassmann dimensions (cf. Larus Thorlacius, Thordur Jonsson (eds.), M-Theory and Quantum Geometry, Springer, 2012, p. 263). and the superunitary groups SU(MN). An equivalent algebraic approach starts from the observation that a super manifold is determined by its ring of supercommutative smooth functions, and that a morphism of super manifolds corresponds one to one with an algebra homomorphism between their functions in the opposite direction, i.e. that the category of supermanifolds is opposite to the category of algebras of smooth graded commutative functions. Reversing all the arrows in the commutative diagrams that define a Lie supergroup then shows that functions over the supergroup have the structure of a Z2-graded Hopf algebra. Likewise the representations of this Hopf algebra turn out to be Z2-graded comodules. This Hopf algebra gives the global properties of the supergroup. There is another related Hopf algebra which is the dual of the previous Hopf algebra. It can be identified with the Hopf algebra of graded differential operators at the origin. It only gives the local properties of the symmetries i.e., it only gives information about infinitesimal supersymmetry transformations. The representations of this Hopf algebra are modules. Like in the non-graded case, this Hopf algebra can be described purely algebraically as the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie superalgebra. In a similar way one can define an affine algebraic supergroup as a group object in the category of superalgebraic affine varieties. An affine algebraic supergroup has a similar one to one relation to its Hopf algebra of superpolynomials. Using the language of schemes, which combines the geometric and algebraic point of view, algebraic supergroup schemes can be defined including super Abelian varieties.

It is often used for this purpose in inflammatory bowel disease and short bowel syndrome. It is not recommended for those with blood in the stool, mucus in the stool or fevers. The medication is taken by mouth. Common side effects include abdominal pain, constipation, sleepiness, vomiting, and a dry mouth. It may increase the risk of toxic megacolon. Loperamide's safety in pregnancy is unclear, but no evidence of harm has been found. It appears to be safe in breastfeeding. It is an opioid with no significant absorption from the gut and does not cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier when used at normal doses. It works by slowing the contractions of the intestines. Loperamide was first made in 1969 and used medically in 1976. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Loperamide is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 351st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 700 thousand prescriptions. Medical uses Loperamide is effective for the treatment of a number of types of diarrhea. This includes control of acute nonspecific diarrhea, mild traveler's diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic diarrhea due to bowel resection, and chronic diarrhea secondary to inflammatory bowel disease. It is also useful for reducing ileostomy output. Off-label uses for loperamide also include chemotherapy-induced diarrhea, especially related to irinotecan use. Loperamide should not be used as the primary treatment in cases of bloody diarrhea, acute exacerbation of ulcerative colitis, or bacterial enterocolitis. Loperamide is often compared to diphenoxylate. Studies suggest that loperamide is more effective and has lower neural side effects. Side effects Adverse drug reactions most commonly associated with loperamide are constipation (which occurs in 1.7‚Äì5.3% of users), dizziness (up to 1.4%), nausea (0.7‚Äì3.2%), and abdominal cramps (0.5‚Äì3.0%). Rare, but more serious, side effects include toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus, angioedema, anaphylaxis/allergic reactions, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, erythema multiforme, urinary retention, and heat stroke. The most frequent symptoms of loperamide overdose are drowsiness, vomiting, and abdominal pain, or burning. High doses may result in heart problems such as abnormal heart rhythms. =Contraindications= Treatment should be avoided in the presence of high fever or if the stool is bloody. Treatment is not recommended for people who could have negative effects from rebound constipation. If a suspicion exists of diarrhea associated with organisms that can penetrate the intestinal walls, such as E. coli O157:H7 or Salmonella, loperamide is contraindicated as a primary treatment. Loperamide treatment is not used in symptomatic C. difficile infections, as it increases the risk of toxin retention and precipitation of toxic megacolon. Loperamide should be administered with caution to people with liver failure due to reduced first-pass metabolism. Additionally, caution should be used when treating people with advanced HIV/AIDS, as cases of both viral and bacterial toxic megacolon have been reported. If abdominal distension is noted, therapy with loperamide should be discontinued. =Children= The use of loperamide in children under two years is not recommended. Rare reports of fatal paralytic ileus associated with abdominal distention have been made. Most of these reports occurred in the setting of acute dysentery, overdose, and with very young children less than two years of age. A review of loperamide in children under 12 years old found that serious adverse events occurred only in children under three years old. The study reported that the use of loperamide should be contraindicated in children who are under 3, systemically ill, malnourished, moderately dehydrated, or have bloody diarrhea. In 1990, all formulations for children of the antidiarrheal loperamide were banned in Pakistan. =Pregnancy and breast feeding= Loperamide is not recommended in the United Kingdom for use during pregnancy or by nursing mothers. In the U.S., loperamide is classified by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as pregnancy category C. Studies in rat models have shown no teratogenicity, but sufficient studies in humans have not been conducted. One controlled, prospective study of 89 women exposed to loperamide during their first trimester of pregnancy showed no increased risk of malformations. This, however, was only one study with a small sample size. Loperamide can be present in breast milk, and is not recommended for breast- feeding mothers. Drug interactions Loperamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein; therefore, the concentration of loperamide increases when given with a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. Common P-glycoprotein inhibitors include quinidine, ritonavir, and ketoconazole. Loperamide is capable of decreasing the absorption of some other drugs. As an example, saquinavir concentrations can decrease by half when given with loperamide. Loperamide is an antidiarrheal agent, which decreases intestinal movement. As such, when combined with other antimotility drugs, the risk of constipation is increased. These drugs include other opioids, antihistamines, antipsychotics, and anticholinergics. Mechanism of action Ball-and-stick model of loperamide molecule Loperamide is an opioid-receptor agonist and acts on the Œº-opioid receptors in the myenteric plexus of the large intestine. It works like morphine, decreasing the activity of the myenteric plexus, which decreases the tone of the longitudinal and circular smooth muscles of the intestinal wall. This increases the time material stays in the intestine, allowing more water to be absorbed from the fecal matter. It also decreases colonic mass movements and suppresses the gastrocolic reflex. Loperamide's circulation in the bloodstream is limited in two ways. Efflux by P-glycoprotein in the intestinal wall reduces passage of loperamide, and the fraction of drug crossing is then further reduced through first-pass metabolism by the liver. Loperamide metabolizes into an MPTP-like compound, but is unlikely to exert neurotoxicity. =Blood‚Äìbrain barrier= Efflux by P-glycoprotein also prevents circulating loperamide from effectively crossing the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, so it can generally only antagonize muscarinic receptors in the peripheral nervous system, and currently has a score of one on the anticholinergic cognitive burden scale. Concurrent administration of P-glycoprotein inhibitors such as quinidine potentially allows loperamide to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and produce central morphine-like effects. Loperamide taken with quinidine was found to produce respiratory depression, indicative of central opioid action. Loperamide has been shown to cause a mild physical dependence during preclinical studies, specifically in mice, rats, and rhesus monkeys. Symptoms of mild opiate withdrawal were observed following abrupt discontinuation of long-term treatment of animals with loperamide. When originally approved for medical use in the United States, loperamide was considered a narcotic and was put into Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act 1970. It was transferred to Schedule V on 17 July 1977, and then decontrolled on 3 November 1982.  History  Loperamide hydrochloride was first synthesized in 1969 by Paul Janssen from Janssen Pharmaceutica in Beerse, Belgium, following previous discoveries of diphenoxylate hydrochloride (1956) and fentanyl citrate (1960). The first clinical reports on loperamide were published in 1973 in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry with the inventor being one of the authors. The trial name for it was \\"R-18553\\". Loperamide oxide has a different research code: R-58425. The trial against placebo was conducted from December 1972 to February 1974, its results being published in 1977 in Gut, an edition of British Society of Gastroenterology. In 1973, Janssen started to promote loperamide under the brand name Imodium. In December 1976, Imodium got US FDA approval. During the 1980s, Imodium became the best-selling prescription antidiarrheal in the United States. In March 1988, McNeil Pharmaceutical began selling loperamide as an over-the-counter drug under the brand name Imodium A-D. In the 1980s, loperamide also existed in the form of drops (Imodium Drops) and syrup. Initially, it was intended for children's usage, but Johnson & Johnson voluntarily withdrew it from the market in 1990 after 18 cases of paralytic ileus (resulting in six deaths) were registered in Pakistan and reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the following years (1990-1991), products containing loperamide have been restricted for children's use in a number of countries (ranging from two to five years of age). In the late 1980s, before the US patent expired on 30 January 1990, McNeil started to develop Imodium Advanced containing loperamide and simethicone for treating both diarrhea and gas. In March 1997, the company patented such combination. The drug was approved in June 1997, by the FDA as Imodium Multi-Symptom Relief in the form of a chewable tablet. In November 1993, loperamide was launched as an orally disintegrating tablet based on Zydis technology. In 2013, loperamide in the form of 2-mg tablets was added to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. Society and culture =Cost= Loperamide is sold as a generic medication. In 2016, Imodium was one of the biggest-selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of . =Brand names= Loperamide was originally marketed as Imodium, and many generic brands are sold. =Recreational use= Loperamide has typically been deemed to have a relatively low risk of misuse. In 2012, no reports of loperamide abuse were made. In 2015, however, case reports of extremely high-dose loperamide use were published. Primary intent of users has been to manage symptoms of opioid withdrawal such as diarrhea, although a small portion derive psychoactive effects at these higher doses. At these higher doses central nervous system penetrance occurs and long term use may lead to tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal on abrupt cessation. Dubbing it \\"the poor man's methadone\\", clinicians warned that increased restrictions on the availability of prescription opioids passed in response to the opioid epidemic were prompting recreational users to turn to loperamide as an over- the-counter treatment for withdrawal symptoms. The FDA responded to these warnings by calling on drug manufacturers to voluntarily limit the availability of loperamide for public-safety reasons, in an analogous manner to restrictions put on the sales of pseudoephedrine, to be sold only in limited amounts. Since 2015, several reports of sometimes-fatal cardiotoxicity due to high-dose loperamide abuse have been published.
