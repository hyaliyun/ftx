The nerve is important for breathing because it provides exclusive motor control of the diaphragm, the primary muscle of respiration. In humans, the right and left phrenic nerves are primarily supplied by the C4 spinal nerve, but there is also contribution from the C3 and C5 spinal nerves. From its origin in the neck, the nerve travels downward into the chest to pass between the heart and lungs towards the diaphragm. In addition to motor fibers, the phrenic nerve contains sensory fibers, which receive input from the central tendon of the diaphragm and the mediastinal pleura, as well as some sympathetic nerve fibers. Although the nerve receives contributions from nerves roots of the cervical plexus and the brachial plexus, it is usually considered separate from either plexus. The nerve is named from the Ancient Greek phren, meaning diaphragm. Structure The phrenic nerve originates in the phrenic motor nucleus in the ventral horn of the cervical spinal cord. It descends obliquely with the internal jugular vein across the anterior scalene, deep to the prevertebral layer of deep cervical fascia and the transverse cervical and suprascapular arteries. On the left, the phrenic nerve crosses anterior to the first part of the subclavian artery. On the right, it lies on the anterior scalene muscle and crosses anterior to the 2nd part of the subclavian artery. On both sides, the phrenic nerve usually runs posterior to the subclavian vein as it enters the thorax where it runs anterior to the root of the lung and between the fibrous pericardium and mediastinal parietal pleura. * The right phrenic nerve passes over the brachiocephalic artery, posterior to the subclavian vein, and then crosses the root of the right lung anteriorly and then leaves the thorax by passing through the vena cava hiatus opening in the diaphragm at the level of T8. The right phrenic nerve passes over the right atrium. * The left phrenic nerve passes over the pericardium of the left ventricle and pierces the diaphragm separately. The pericardiacophrenic arteries and veins travel with their respective phrenic nerves. The phrenic nerve can be marked by a line connecting these two points: # 1st point can be labelled 3.5 cm at the level of the thyroid cartilage from the midsagittal plane. # 2nd point is at the medial end of the clavicle. =Variation= As with most nerves in the neck, multiple anatomic variants have been described. Notably, there may be variability in the course of the phrenic nerve in the retroclavicular region such that the nerve courses anterior to the subclavian vein, rather than its typical position posterior to the vein (between the subclavian vein and artery). This variant may predispose the phrenic nerve to injury during subclavian vascular cannulation. In addition, an accessory phrenic nerve is commonly identified, present in up to 75% of a cadaveric study. In canines the phrenic nerve arises from C5-C7 with occasional small contributions from C4. In the cat, horse, ox, and small ruminant the phrenic nerve arises variably from C4-C7. Function Both of these nerves supply motor fibers to the diaphragm and sensory fibers to the fibrous pericardium, mediastinal pleura, and diaphragmatic peritoneum. Some sources describe the right phrenic nerve as innervating the gallbladder, other sources make no such mention. The right phrenic nerve may also supply the capsule of the liver. Clinical significance Left phrenic nerve palsy (right image side) in fluoroscopy: forced inspiration with closed mouth leads to paradox elevation of the paralytic left diaphragm while the healthy right side moves down. Pain arising from structures supplied by the phrenic nerve is often \\"referred\\" to other somatic regions served by spinal nerves C3-C5. For example, a subphrenic abscess beneath the right diaphragm might cause a patient to feel pain in the right shoulder. Irritation of the phrenic nerve (or the tissues it supplies) leads to the hiccup reflex. A hiccup is a spasmodic contraction of the diaphragm, which pulls air against the closed folds of the larynx. The phrenic nerve must be identified during thoracic surgery and preserved. To confirm the identity of the phrenic nerve, a doctor may gently manipulate it to elicit a dartle (diaphragmatic startle) response. The right phrenic nerve may be crushed by the vena cava clamp during liver transplantation. Severing the phrenic nerve, or a phrenectomy, will paralyse that half of the diaphragm. Diaphragm paralysis is best demonstrated by sonography. Breathing will be made more difficult but will continue provided the other nerve is intact. The phrenic nerve arises from the neck (C3-C5) and innervates the diaphragm, which is much lower. Hence, patients suffering spinal cord injuries below the neck are still able to breathe effectively, despite any paralysis of the lower limbs. Brachial plexus injuries can cause paralysis to various regions in the arm, forearm, and hand depending on the severed nerves. The resulting palsy has been clinically treated using the phrenic nerve as a donor for neurotization of the musculocutaneous nerve and the median nerve.Yu-Dong, G., Min-Ming, W., Yi-Lu, Z., Jia-Ao, Z., Gao-Meng, Z., De-Song, C., Ji-Geng, Y. and Xiao-Ming, C. (1989), Phrenic nerve transfer for brachial plexus motor neurotization. Microsurgery, 10: 287‚Äì289. doi: 10.1002/micr.1920100407 This treatment has a high success rate (84.6%) in partial to full restoration of the innervation to the damaged nerve. Furthermore, this procedure has resulted in restored function to nerves in the brachial plexus with minimal impact to respiratory function of the phrenic nerve. The instances where pulmonary vital capacity is reduced have typically been a result of use of the right phrenic as the donor for the neurotization whereas use of left phrenic nerve has not been significantly linked to reduced pulmonary vital capacity.Luedemann, Wolf, Michael Hamm, Ulrike Bl√∂mer, Madjid Samii, and Marcos Tatagiba. \\"Brachial Plexus Neurotization with Donor Phrenic Nerves and Its Effect on Pulmonary Function.\\" Journal of Neurosurgery 96.3 (2002): 523-26.

Once the nerve leaves C5 it commonly pierces the middle scalene muscle, and continues deep to levator scapulae and the rhomboids (minor superior to major). It provides motor innervation to the rhomboid muscles, which pull the scapula towards the spine and levator scapulae muscle, which elevates the scapula. Injury to this nerve is usually apparent on inspection when the scapula on the injured side is located farther from the midline than the uninjured scapula. The patient would be unable to pull their shoulder back, as when standing at attention. Isolated dorsal scapular nerve injury is uncommon, but case reports usually involve injury to the scalene muscles. The nerve is accompanied by one of two arteries: either the dorsal scapular artery (the only artery that branches off the third part of the subclavian artery, although its origin is highly variable in humans) or, when the dorsal scapular artery is absent, the deep branch of the transverse cervical artery. The latter is one of three arteries branching off the thyrocervical trunk, a branch of the first part of the subclavian artery, with the other two branches being the suprascapular artery, and the inferior thyroid artery.

Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935), also known as the Hot Oil case, was a case, in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Roosevelt Administration's prohibition of interstate and foreign trade in petroleum goods produced in excess of state quotas, the \\"hot oil\\" orders adopted under the 1933 National Industrial Recovery Act, was unconstitutional. The ruling was the first of several that overturned key elements of the Administration's New Deal legislative program. The relevant section 9(c) of the NIRA was found to be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, as it permitted presidential interdiction of trade without defining criteria for the application of the proposed restriction. The finding thus differed from later rulings that argued that federal government action affecting intrastate production breached the Commerce Clause of the Constitution; in Panama v. Ryan, the Court found that Congress had violated the nondelegation doctrine by vesting the President with legislative powers without clear guidelines, giving the President enormous and unchecked powers. The omission of Congressional guidance on state petroleum production ceilings occasioned the adverse ruling because it allowed the executive to assume the role of the legislature. Justice Cardozo dissented, claiming that the guidelines had been sufficient.

This nerve characteristically arises from the anterior rami of three spinal nerve roots: the fifth, sixth, and seventh cervical nerves (C5-C7) although the root from C7 may be absent. The roots from C5 and C6 pierce through the scalenus medius, while the C7 root passes in front of the muscle. The nerve descends through the cervicoaxillary canal behind (posterior to) the brachial plexus and the axillary artery and vein, resting on the outer surface of the serratus anterior. It extends along the side of the thorax to the lower border of that muscle, supplying filaments to each of its digitations (finger-like projections).Fischer, J. (2012). Anatomy of the Axilla.

Injury has been reported in almost all sports, typically occurring from a blow to the ribs underneath an outstretched arm. The long thoracic nerve can also be damaged during surgery for breast cancer, specifically radical mastectomies that involve removal of axillary lymph nodes. Injuries to the nerve can result from carrying heavy bags over the shoulder for a prolonged time. There are also reports of isolated damage to this nerve as a variant of Parsonage Turner Syndrome, an autoimmune disease. Symptoms are often minimal ‚Äì if symptomatic, a posterior shoulder or scapular burning type of pain may be reported. A lesion of the nerve paralyses the serratus anterior to produce winged scapula, which is most prominent when the arm is lifted forward or when the patient pushes the outstretched arm against a wall.

It was developed by the National Academy of the Korean Language from 1995 and was released to the public on 7 July 2000 by South Korea's Ministry of Culture and Tourism in Proclamation No. 2000-8. The new system corrected problems in the McCune‚ÄìReischauer system, such as phenomena where different consonants and vowels became indistinguishable in the absence of special symbols. To be specific, under the McCune‚ÄìReischauer system, Korean consonants \\"(k), (t), (p) and (ch)\\" and \\"(k'), (t'), (p') and (ch')\\" became indistinguishable when the apostrophe was removed. In addition, Korean vowels \\"Ïñ¥(≈è)\\" and \\"Ïò§(o)\\" and \\"Ïúº(≈≠)\\" and \\"Ïö∞(u)\\" became indistinguishable when the breve was removed. Especially in internet use where omission of apostrophes and breves is common, this caused many Koreans as well as foreigners confusion. Hence, the revision of the Romanization of Korean was made with the belief that if the old system was left unrevised, it would continue to confuse people, both Koreans and foreigners.  Features  These are notable features of the Revised Romanization system: * The aspiration distinction between consonants is represented in a new way. The unaspirated consonants are represented as ‚ü®g‚ü© ‚ü®d‚ü© ‚ü®b‚ü© ‚ü®j‚ü© respectively, and the aspirated consonants are represented as ‚ü®k‚ü© ‚ü®t‚ü© ‚ü®p‚ü© ‚ü®ch‚ü©. These letter pairs have a similar aspiration distinction in English at the beginning of a syllable (though they also have a voicing distinction unlike Korean); this approach is also used by Hanyu Pinyin. By contrast, the McCune‚ÄìReischauer system uses ‚ü®k‚ü© ‚ü®t‚ü© ‚ü®p‚ü© ‚ü®ch‚ü© both for the unaspirated and aspirated consonants, adding an apostrophe for the aspirated versions (‚ü®k'‚ü© ‚ü®t'‚ü© ‚ü®p'‚ü© ‚ü®ch'‚ü©). (The McCune‚ÄìReischauer system also includes voicing, which the revised romanization does not.) ** However, are not always romanized as ‚ü®g‚ü© ‚ü®d‚ü© ‚ü®b‚ü© ‚ü®j‚ü©, depending on their environment. For example, they are romanized as ‚ü®k‚ü© ‚ü®t‚ü© ‚ü®p‚ü© ‚ü®ch‚ü© when placed in the final position, as they are neutralized to unreleased stops: ‚Üí byeok, ‚Üí bak, ‚Üí bueok, ‚Üí byeoke, ‚Üí bakke, ‚Üí bueoke, ‚Üí keop. * Vowels and are written as ‚ü®eo‚ü© and ‚ü®eu‚ü© respectively, replacing the '‚ü®≈è‚ü© and ‚ü®≈≠‚ü© of the McCune‚ÄìReischauer system). ** However, is written as ‚ü®wo‚ü© (not ‚ü®weo‚ü©), and is written as ‚ü®ui‚ü© (not ‚ü®eui‚ü©) * „ÖÖ used to be written as sh and s, depending on context. Now it will be written as s in all cases. ** is written as ‚ü®s‚ü© regardless of the following vowels and semivowels; there is no ‚ü®sh‚ü©: ‚Üí sa, ‚Üí si. ** When followed by another consonant or when in final position, it is written as ‚ü®t‚ü©: ‚Üí ot (but ‚Üí ose). * is ‚ü®r‚ü© before a vowel or a semivowel and ‚ü®l‚ü© everywhere else: ‚Üí rieul, ‚Üí Cheorwon, ‚Üí Ulleungdo, ‚Üí Balhae. Like in McCune‚ÄìReischauer, is written ‚ü®l‚ü© whenever pronounced as a lateral rather than as a nasal consonant: ‚Üí Jeollabuk-do In addition, special provisions are for regular phonological rules in exceptions to transliteration (see Korean phonology). Other rules and recommendations include the following: * A hyphen optionally disambiguates syllables: ‚Üí ga-eul (fall; autumn) versus ‚Üí gae-ul (stream). However, few official publications make use of this provision since actual instances of ambiguity among names are rare. ** A hyphen must be used in linguistic transliterations to denote syllable-initial except at the beginning of a word: ‚Üí eops-eoss-seumnida, ‚Üí oegug-eo, ‚Üí Ae-ogae * It is permitted to hyphenate syllables in the given name, following common practice. Certain phonological changes, ordinarily indicated in other contexts, are ignored in names, for better disambiguating between names: ‚Üí Gang Hongrip or Gang Hong-rip (not *Hongnip), ‚Üí Han Boknam or Han Bok-nam (not *Bongnam or \\"Bong-nam\\") * Administrative units (such as the do) are hyphenated from the placename proper: ‚Üí Gangwon-do ** One may omit terms such as : ‚Üí Pyeongchang- gun or Pyeongchang, ‚Üí Pyeongchang-eup or Pyeongchang. * However, names for geographic features and artificial structures are not hyphenated: ‚Üí Seoraksan, ‚Üí Haeinsa * Proper nouns are capitalized. Usage = In South Korea = The sign with the name of the railway station in Bucheon ‚Äî at the top, a writing in hangul, the transliteration in Latin script below using the Revised Romanization, along with the hanja text. The sign with the name of the railway station in Jecheon ‚Äî at the top, a writing in hangul, the transliteration in Latin script below using the Revised Romanization and the English translation of the word 'station', along with the hanja text. Almost all road signs, names of railway and subway stations on line maps and signs, etc. have been changed according to Revised Romanization of Korean (RR, also called South Korean or Ministry of Culture (MC) 2000). It is estimated to have cost at least 500 billion won to 600 billion won (US$500~600 million) to carry out this procedure. All Korean textbooks, maps and signs to do with cultural heritage were required to comply with the new system by 28 February 2002. Romanization of surnames and existing companies' names has been left untouched because of the reasons explained below. However, the Korean government encourages using the revised romanization of Korean for the new names. = Exception = Like several European languages that have undergone spelling reforms (such as Portuguese, German or Swedish), the Revised Romanization is not expected to be adopted as the official romanization of Korean family names. This is because the conditions for allowing changes in romanization of surnames in passport is very strict. The reasons are outlined below. 1\\\\. Countries around the world manage information about foreigners who are harmful to the public safety of their countries, including international criminals and illegal immigrants by the Roman name and date of birth of the passport they have used in the past. And if a passport is free to change its Roman name, it will pose a serious risk to border management due to difficulties in determining the same person. 2\\\\. The people of a country where it is free to change its Roman name will be subject to strict immigration checks, which will inevitably cause inconvenience to the people of that country. 3\\\\. Arbitrary changes in the Romanization of passports can lead to a fall in the credibility of the passports and national credit, which can have a negative impact on the new visa waiver agreement, etc. Also, with very few exceptions, it is impossible for a person who has ever left the country under their romanized name to change their family name again. However, South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism encourages those who ‚Äúnewly‚Äù register their romanized names to follow the Revised Romanization of Korean. In addition, North Korea continues to use a version of the McCune‚ÄìReischauer system of Romanization, a different version of which was in official use in South Korea from 1984 to 2000. = Outside Korea = Textbooks and dictionaries intended for students of the Korean language tend to include this Romanization. However, some publishers have acknowledged the difficulties or confusion it can cause for non-native Korean speakers who are unused to the conventions of this style of Romanization.Tuttle Publishing: \\"In addition, easy-to-use phonetic spellings of all Korean words and phrases are given. For example, ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù‚Äîannyeonghaseyo? is also written as anh-nyawng-hah-seyo?\\", blurb for two Korean phrasebooks: Making Out in Korean and More Making Out in Korean .

The most common specimens include the Type 38 chambered for the 6.5√ó50mmSR Type 38 cartridge, and the Type 99 chambered for the 7.7√ó58mm Type 99 cartridge, which is comparable in power to a modern .308 Winchester round. History The Arisaka rifle was designed by Colonel Arisaka Nariakira (ÊúâÂùÇ ÊàêÁ´†; 1852‚Äì1915), who was later promoted to lieutenant general and also received the title of baron from Emperor Meiji, in 1907. Over the course of various wars several productions runs and variants were made, including the transition from the 6.5mm Type 38 cartridge to the larger 7.7mm Type 99, and the introduction of a paratrooper rifle that could be disassembled into two major parts for airborne operations. Tests on samples of Arisaka rifles conducted after the war showed that their bolts and receivers were constructed of carbon steel \\"similar to SAE steel grade No. 1085 with a carbon content of 0.80% to 0.90%, and a manganese content of 0.60% to 0.90%.\\"Hatcher p. 231 During destructive tests, the Arisakas were shown to be stronger than the M1903 Springfield, Lee‚ÄìEnfield, and Mauser rifles.Hatcher p. 206 The Arisaka's were also one of the only guns of the era to use polygonal rifling in its barrels, rather than the more traditional lands and grooves. Some of the early issue Type 99 rifles were fitted with a folding wire monopod intended to improve accuracy in the prone position. The rear sights also featured folding horizontal extensions to give a degree of lead suitable for firing against aircraft. Near the end of World War II, last-ditch ersatz models were being made in various cost-cutting feature variations with the goal of cheaply bolstering the imperial armed forces; for example, the ovoid bulb-shaped bolt of earlier runs were replaced by a smaller and utilitarian cylindrical shape, the handguard on the barrel was omitted, and crude fixed sights were fitted. A Type 38 with its imperial seal intact The Arisaka bolt-action service rifle was used everywhere in the Imperial Japanese Army and the Imperial Japanese Navy. Prior to World War II, Arisakas were used by the British Navy and Russian Army, in Finland and Albania. The Czech Legions that fought in the Russian Revolution were almost entirely armed with Type 30s and 38s. Many captured Arisaka rifles were employed by neighboring countries both during and after World War II, in places such as China, Thailand and Cambodia. However, after the Japanese surrender in the summer of 1945, manufacture of rifles and ammunition stopped abruptly, and the Arisaka quickly became obsolete. Since most Imperial Japanese Armory contents were thrown into Tokyo Harbor after the signing of the surrender, spare ammunition also became rare. Additional 6.5√ó50mmSR ammunition was, however, produced in China for use in their captured rifles. A Type 99 with its imperial seal ground The imperial ownership seal, a 16-petal chrysanthemum known as the Chrysanthemum Flower Seal stamped upon the top of the receiver in all official imperial-issue rifles, has often been defaced by filing, grinding, or stamping on surviving examples. There are conflicting claims that this was done on the orders of the Imperial Japanese Military prior to surrender, however it is generally accepted by most historians that the imperial chrysanthemums were ground off the rifles on the orders from General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of occupation forces at that time.Honeycutt & Anthony p. 12 To date, no documentation from either Japanese or U.S. forces has been found that required the defacing. Most of the Arisakas with surviving insignia are in Japan, though there are a few remaining on samples taken as war trophies before the surrender, and those captured by Chinese forces. Some of the captured Sino Arisakas were later exported to the United States, examples including a number of Type 38 carbines rebarrelled and rechambered for the 7.62√ó39mm round. Some Type 38 rifles captured by the Kuomintang forces were also converted to fire the 7.92√ó57mm Mauser round. Many of the Chrysanthemum Seals were completely ground off, but some were merely defaced with a chisel, scratch or had the number \\"0\\" stamped repeatedly along the edges. The latter was usually done with rifles removed from Japanese military service (and thus no longer the emperor's property), including rifles given to schools or sold to other nations, such as the British Royal Navy's purchase of many Type 38s in World War I to free up SMLE rifles for their land forces. A very small run of Type 38 rifles was also manufactured for export to Mexico in 1910, with the Mexican coat of arms instead of the imperial chrysanthemum, though few arrived before the Mexican Revolution and the bulk remained in Japan until World War I, when they were sold to Imperial Russia. Many thousands of Type 99s and other Arisaka variants were brought to the United States by Army soldiers and Marines as war trophies during and after World War II. Models =Type 30= First rifle of the Arisaka series. Chambered in 6.5√ó50mmSR Type 30. 554,000 built. Type 30 carbine Carbine variant of the Type 30; 300 mm shorter. 45,000 built. Type 35 Officially designated as Type 35 navy rifle. Also in 6.5√ó50mmSR Type 30. Design improvement based on the Type 30 for the Imperial Japanese Navy Land Forces by Major Nambu Kijir≈ç. Changes include tangent type rear sight, separate sliding bolt cover (as opposed to simultaneously moving ones on all other types after) of the same type later used on the Siamese Mauser style rifle, hook safety replaced with a large knob cocking piece to protect from gases in case of a blown primer, larger bolt handle knob, improved bolt head, gas port in bolt body, and improved chamber configuration for better cartridge feeding. =Type 38= Developed by Major Nambu Kijir≈ç. Chambered in 6.5√ó50mmSR Type 38, Type 30 cartridge is also usable. A short variant exists for ease of handling, its length is between the basic rifle and the carbine. One of the most produced and commonly encountered model. Designed in 1905 and simultaneously produced until 1942 with 3,400,000 built. Type 38 carbine Carbine variant of the Type 38; 300 mm shorter. Also fielded by support personnel. =Type 44 carbine= Carbine derived from the Type 38 rifle. Chambered in 6.5√ó50mmSR Type 38, Type 30 cartridge is also usable. Distinguishing features are its folding spike bayonet and two-piece takedown cleaning rods concealed within the buttstock. Originally intended for the cavalry, also used by other support personnel. =Type 97 sniper rifle= One of the two main sniper rifles in imperial military service. Based on the Type 38 rifle. Chambered in 6.5√ó50mmSR Type 38, but more commonly used reduced charge cartridges associated with the Type 11 and 96 light machine guns for lighter recoil, reduced report, camouflaged muzzle flash, and overall accuracy. Uses factory-zeroed Type 97 telescopic sight (2.5X). About 22,500 built. =Type 99= Successor to the Type 38 rifle. Chambered in 7.7√ó58mm Type 99, later rimless variants of the Type 92 and 97 cartridges also usable. Designed in 1939, then produced and fielded from 1941 to 1945, the Type 99 was the most common Imperial Japanese service rifle of World War II and second most produced imperial rifle with 2,500,000 built. Significant changes are the improvement of the rear sight form transitioning from a V-notch type like those on a Type 38, to an aperture, the front sight blade was renewed to a triangular shape, chrome-lined barrels were used, and on earlier productions, the rear sight was equipped with anti-aircraft calipers. Sub-variations included a long rifle (approximately only 38,000 made), and short rifle; former being 1258 mm in total and latter being 1118 mm. The short rifle also varied in quality from initial, intermediate, to last-ditch. Type 99 sniper rifle The other sniper rifle of the Imperial Japanese Military. Built on both the long and short models with the latter being higher in number. Chambered in 7.7√ó58mm Type 99, later rimless variants of the Type 92 and 97 cartridges also usable. The larger, more powerful caliber allowed the ballistics to be less affected by windage at the cost of stronger recoil. Two different types of scopes were issued to the rifles: the Type 97 2.5X telescopic scope, or the Type 99 4X telescopic scope. Later production of the Type 99 scope allowed for distance adjustment. Scopes were issued with their respective holsters and were often detached from the rifle and placed within them while advancing. By doctrine, snipers of the imperial military were selected by their skill in marksmanship. The caliber of the rifle assigned to a sniper corresponded with the ammunition of the company he served under. Production began in May 1942. Total number made is approximately 10,000. =TERA= A small series of takedown rifles produced for the imperial army paratroopers and imperial navy paratroopers. Only production model is the Type 2 based on the Type 99 short rifle; the rest are two proto-test types (Type 100 and Type 1). The Type 2 is chambered in 7.7√ó58mm Type 99, later rimless variants of the Type 92 and 97 cartridges also usable. The Type 2 allowed for compact storage by breaking down to two pieces: the stock and action, and barrel and handguard. About a total of 19,000 were produced from 1942 to 1944. Bayonets =Type 30= Created simultaneously with the Type 30 rifle, this sword-type bayonet is compatible with all variants of the Arisaka rifle except for the Type 44 carbine. Twenty different variations exist, and is further categorized by early, mid, and late-war production phases. Also fixable on Type 96 and 99 light machine guns. =Type 35 bayonet= The Type 35 bayonet was a slightly modified Type 30 bayonet made specifically for the Type 35 rifle. The dimensions of the bayonet is almost exactly the same as the Type 30 bayonet. The only real difference between the two is the added addition of a sprung catch that hooks into the scabbard when not in use.Allan; White; Zielinkski. p. 78 About 8,400,000 were made. =Type 44= Fixed permanently on the Type 44 carbine, this spike-type bayonet is foldable under the handguard and does not interfere with the barrel when deployed. =Type 2= With the long length of the Type 30 bayonet unfit for concealing within a paratrooper's personal equipment set, this knife-type bayonet was created to address this issue. Twenty centimetres shorter than a Type 30, its total length is 32.3 cm. Used primarily with the Type 2 TERA rifle or the Type 100 submachine gun by the Imperial Military Airborne Divisions. About 25,000 were made. Users *: Some captured at the Eastern front during World War I.

Details As with all captured foreign firearms they may be dangerous when fired, due to both the lower quality of the \\"last-ditch\\" rifles produced during the end-half of World War II, and to modifications performed by returning U.S. servicemen on those rifles. Ammunition for the Arisaka series, which were often battlefield pick-ups, or souvenirs, were not readily available after the end of the war. Consequently, many were rebored or rechambered for readily available calibers of that time. Additionally, some were occasionally rendered inoperable prior to being shipped home, or even potentially sabotaged. The manner in which rifles may have been demilled can include permanently damaging the receiver or removal of parts. Rear sight of a Type 99 with intact anti-aircraft calipers deployed. Type 38s in particular were commonly rechambered to 6.5√ó.257 Roberts, a wildcat cartridge made using the readily available .257 Roberts cases with the neck expanded to use 6.5mm bullets specific to the already existing barrel. Likewise, the Type 99 in 7.7√ó58mm were known to be converted to .30-06 Springfield, which is again of similar but not identical dimensions. While the .30-06 can be fired by lengthening the chamber of the rifle slightly (from 58 to 63mm), the 7.7mm case is slightly wider than the .30-06 and uses a slightly larger-diameter bullet, meaning a .30‚Äì06 cartridge case will swell slightly to fit the oversized chamber, and a standard .30-06 bullet with a .308 diameter will not provide a good fit to the .310‚Äì312 diameter rifling. Those seeking ammunition for their Type 99 rifles often manufacture it by modifying .30‚Äì06 cases. The German 7.92√ó57mm Mauser cartridge may also be used with the proper .311 diameter bullet. The widely available British .303 bullets also provide a proper fit for the firearm's rifling. Norma currently manufactures stock 7.7√ó58mm ammunition, as well as making new brass available for reloaders. Hornady also produces new Arisaka ammunition in both 6.5mm and 7.7mm calibers. Since the base of the 7.7mm case is slightly larger than the .30-06 (thereby causing varying amounts of bulging in the reformed brass), some owners may find it preferable to use proper brass or new factory cartridges. Bullets and powder charges of surplus .303 British ammunition may also be loaded into proper 7.7√ó58mm cases to produce rifle cartridges with ballistics that are similar to the original Japanese military load.

For example, the positive integers are closed under addition, but not under subtraction: 1 - 2 is not a positive integer even though both 1 and 2 are positive integers. Another example is the set containing only zero, which is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication (because 0+0=0, 0-0=0, and 0\\\\times{0}=0). Similarly, a set is said to be closed under a collection of operations if it is closed under each of the operations individually. Basic properties A set that is closed under an operation or collection of operations is said to satisfy a closure property. Often a closure property is introduced as an axiom, which is then usually called the axiom of closure. Modern set-theoretic definitions usually define operations as maps between sets, so adding closure to a structure as an axiom is superfluous; however in practice operations are often defined initially on a superset of the set in question and a closure proof is required to establish that the operation applied to pairs from that set only produces members of that set. For example, the set of even integers is closed under addition, but the set of odd integers is not. When a set S is not closed under some operations, one can usually find the smallest set containing S that is closed. This smallest closed set is called the closure of S (with respect to these operations). For example, the closure under subtraction of the set of natural numbers, viewed as a subset of the real numbers, is the set of integers. An important example is that of topological closure. The notion of closure is generalized by Galois connection, and further by monads. The set S must be a subset of a closed set in order for the closure operator to be defined. In the preceding example, it is important that the reals are closed under subtraction; in the domain of the natural numbers subtraction is not always defined. The two uses of the word \\"closure\\" should not be confused. The former usage refers to the property of being closed, and the latter refers to the smallest closed set containing one that may not be closed. In short, the closure of a set satisfies a closure property. Closed sets A set is closed under an operation if the operation returns a member of the set when evaluated on members of the set. Sometimes the requirement that the operation be valued in a set is explicitly stated, in which case it is known as the axiom of closure. For example, one may define a group as a set with a binary product operator obeying several axioms, including an axiom that the product of any two elements of the group is again an element. However the modern definition of an operation makes this axiom superfluous; an n-ary operation on S is just a subset of Sn+1. By its very definition, an operator on a set cannot have values outside the set. Nevertheless, the closure property of an operator on a set still has some utility. Closure on a set does not necessarily imply closure on all subsets. Thus a subgroup of a group is a subset on which the binary product and the unary operation of inversion satisfy the closure axiom. An operation of a different sort is that of finding the limit points of a subset of a topological space. A set that is closed under this operation is usually referred to as a closed set in the context of topology. Without any further qualification, the phrase usually means closed in this sense. Closed intervals like [1,2] = {x : 1 ‚â§ x ‚â§ 2} are closed in this sense. A subset of a partially ordered set is a downward closed set (also called a lower set) if for every element of the subset, all smaller elements are also in the subset. This applies for example to the real intervals (‚àí‚àû, p) and (‚àí‚àû, p], and for an ordinal number p represented as interval [0, p). Every downward closed set of ordinal numbers is itself an ordinal number. Upward closed sets (also called upper sets) are defined similarly. Examples * In topology and related branches, the relevant operation is taking limits. The topological closure of a set is the corresponding closure operator. The Kuratowski closure axioms characterize this operator. * In linear algebra, the linear span of a set X of vectors is the closure of that set; it is the smallest subset of the vector space that includes X and is closed under the operation of linear combination. This subset is a subspace. * In matroid theory, the closure of X is the largest superset of X that has the same rank as X. * In set theory, the transitive closure of a set. * In set theory, the transitive closure of a binary relation. * In algebra, the algebraic closure of a field. * In commutative algebra, closure operations for ideals, as integral closure and tight closure. * In geometry, the convex hull of a set S of points is the smallest convex set of which S is a subset. * In formal languages, the Kleene closure of a language can be described as the set of strings that can be made by concatenating zero or more strings from that language. * In group theory, the conjugate closure or normal closure of a set of group elements is the smallest normal subgroup containing the set. * In mathematical analysis and in probability theory, the closure of a collection of subsets of X under countably many set operations is called the œÉ-algebra generated by the collection. Closure operator : Given an operation on a set X, one can define the closure C(S) of a subset S of X to be the smallest subset closed under that operation that contains S as a subset, if any such subsets exist. Consequently, C(S) is the intersection of all closed sets containing S. For example, the closure of a subset of a group is the subgroup generated by that set. The closure of sets with respect to some operation defines a closure operator on the subsets of X. The closed sets can be determined from the closure operator; a set is closed if it is equal to its own closure. Typical structural properties of all closure operations are: *The closure is increasing or extensive: the closure of an object contains the object. *The closure is idempotent: the closure of the closure equals the closure. *The closure is monotone, that is, if X is contained in Y, then also C(X) is contained in C(Y). An object that is its own closure is called closed. By idempotency, an object is closed if and only if it is the closure of some object. These three properties define an abstract closure operator. Typically, an abstract closure acts on the class of all subsets of a set. If X is contained in a set closed under the operation then every subset of X has a closure. Binary relation closures Consider first homogeneous relations R ‚äÜ A √ó A. If a relation S satisfies aSb ‚áí bSa, then it is a symmetric relation. An arbitrary homogeneous relation R may not be symmetric but it is always contained in some symmetric relation: R ‚äÜ S. The operation of finding the smallest such S corresponds to a closure operator called symmetric closure. A transitive relation T satisfies aTb ‚àß bTc ‚áí aTc. An arbitrary homogeneous relation R may not be transitive but it is always contained in some transitive relation: R ‚äÜ T. The operation of finding the smallest such T corresponds to a closure operator called transitive closure. Among heterogeneous relations there are properties of difunctionality and contact which lead to difunctional closure and contact closure. The presence of these closure operators in binary relations leads to topology since open-set axioms may be replaced by Kuratowski closure axioms. Thus each property P, symmetry, transitivity, difunctionality, or contact corresponds to a relational topology. In the theory of rewriting systems, one often uses more wordy notions such as the reflexive transitive closure R*--the smallest preorder containing R, or the reflexive transitive symmetric closure R‚â°--the smallest equivalence relation containing R, and therefore also known as the equivalence closure. When considering a particular term algebra, an equivalence relation that is compatible with all operations of the algebra that is, such that e.g. xRy implies f(x,x2) R f(y,x2) and f(x1,x) R f(x1,y) for any binary operation f and arbitrary x1,x2 ‚àà S is called a congruence relation. The congruence closure of R is defined as the smallest congruence relation containing R. For arbitrary P and R, the P closure of R need not exist. In the above examples, these exist because reflexivity, transitivity and symmetry are closed under arbitrary intersections. In such cases, the P closure can be directly defined as the intersection of all sets with property P containing R. Some important particular closures can be constructively obtained as follows: * clref(R) = R ‚à™ { ‚ü®x,x‚ü© : x ‚àà S } is the reflexive closure of R, * clsym(R) = R ‚à™ { ‚ü®y,x‚ü© : ‚ü®x,y‚ü© ‚àà R } is its symmetric closure, * cltrn(R) = R ‚à™ { ‚ü®x1,xn‚ü© : n >1 ‚àß ‚ü®x1,x2‚ü©, ..., ‚ü®xn-1,xn‚ü© ‚àà R } is its transitive closure, * clemb,Œ£(R) = R ‚à™ { ‚ü®f(x1,‚Ä¶,xi-1,xi,xi+1,‚Ä¶,xn), f(x1,‚Ä¶,xi-1,y,xi+1,‚Ä¶,xn)‚ü© : ‚ü®xi,y‚ü© ‚àà R ‚àß f ‚àà Œ£ n-ary ‚àß 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n ‚àß x1,...,xn ‚àà S } is its embedding closure with respect to a given set Œ£ of operations on S, each with a fixed arity. The relation R is said to have closure under some clxxx, if R = clxxx(R); for example R is called symmetric if R = clsym(R). Any of these four closures preserves symmetry, i.e., if R is symmetric, so is any clxxx(R). formally: if R = clsym(R), then clxxx(R) = clsym(clxxx(R)) Similarly, all four preserve reflexivity. Moreover, cltrn preserves closure under clemb,Œ£ for arbitrary Œ£. As a consequence, the equivalence closure of an arbitrary binary relation R can be obtained as cltrn(clsym(clref(R))), and the congruence closure with respect to some Œ£ can be obtained as cltrn(clemb,Œ£(clsym(clref(R)))).

On 30 July 1993 the company was renamed Brymon Airways Limited to reflect the operating name. The company was purchased by British Airways in 1993 and on 28 March 2002 it was merged with British Regional Airlines and was renamed British Airways Citiexpress Limited operating as British Airways Citiexpress. British Airways Citiexpress is recognised for pioneering and attaining CAA approval for the print-at-home boarding pass, one of the first self-service tools of the digital era. The regional operations of British Airways at Birmingham and Manchester,The regional operations of British Airways sub divided into Scotland, Birmingham and Manchester. Aircraft were titled British Airways Scotland; British Airways Birmingham and British Airways Manchester respectively. The service previous operated by BR Scotland were incorporated with the Loganair franchise services into the British Regional Airlines operation. Flagship aircraft of the BA Birmingham operation was Boeing 737 G-XBHX, and of the BA Manchester operation was Boeing 737 G-XMAN. Several other Boeing 737 aircraft based at these airports were given registrations appropriate to the destinations served - G-OMUC and G-OFRA and the operations of the former CityFlyer Express, were integrated into the new airline later in 2002. On 1 February 2006 the airline was renamed BA Connect Limited operating as BA Connect and operations moved to a low-cost carrier model, with food sold via a 'buy on board' programme (except for flights to London City Airport). However, allocated seating and a baggage valet service were still available, while lounge access, tier points and BA Miles remained unaffected for those in the Executive Club. Operationally the new service came into effect on 26 March 2006. BAe 146-200 departing Manchester Airport in 2007 BA Connect handled most of British Airways' domestic and European services that do not serve London Heathrow or Gatwick airports. It had hubs in Birmingham, Bristol, London City, Manchester and Southampton. From these locations the carrier operated services to several northwest European destinations and also to Glasgow, Edinburgh and Aberdeen. A few services also operated from Gatwick. In total, BA Connect flew from 17 airports in the UK and Ireland on 63 routes to major or central regional airports. On 3 November 2006, British Airways chief executive said that he had reached an agreement for Flybe to purchase BA Connect. BA would ensure that Flybe has sufficient funding in order to achieve its growth targets and the transition out of current BA Connect fleet. In return BA would acquire a 15% stake in the new business. The acquisition (which did not include BA Connect routes to London City or from Manchester to New York) would significantly increase the Flybe route network in both the UK and continental Europe, making Flybe the largest regional airline in Europe. Retention of the London City routes would result in BA retaining the RJ100 aircraft for these domestic and European services. BA had to pay Flybe a sum of money to take on the company due to Flybe actually taking on a company that would cost them money rather than make profits for the foreseeable future.ATW: August terrorist scare, BA Connect charge weigh on BA profit Much concern was expressed at the shedding of routes across Scotland, but Flybe stated that BA Connect routes would be kept and expanded.http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/73626.html On 6 March 2007 Flybe stated that they would not be operating any former BA Connect services from Bristol.

It is currently the world's fifth largest container carrier in terms of vessel capacity. The company was formed in 1970 by the merger of two German transportation/maritime companies, Hamburg-American Line (HAPAG), which dated from 1847, and Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) or North German Lloyd (NGL), which was formed in 1857. Since its formation, Hapag-Lloyd has been sold to many organizations and has also undergone numerous mergers with other companies. For instance, Hapag-Lloyd was completely acquired by, and became a subsidiary of TUI AG (Hanover) in 1998. This major event was followed by TUI selling a majority stake of Hapag-Lloyd to various private investors in Hamburg in 2009 and again in 2012. Other important events in the company's history include Hapag-Lloyd's acquisition of CP Ships in 2005 as well as Hapag-Lloyd's merger with the container business of CSAV in 2014, and United Arab Shipping Company in 2017. Currently, the company's shares are owned by several public and private investors, with the largest stake controlled by K√ºhne Holding AG, followed by CSAV.HL Quarterly financial report 1 January to 30 September 2019, p. 4 History Hapag-Lloyd was formed in 1970 through a merger of Hamburg- American Line (HAPAG) and North German Lloyd. =HAPAG= Headquarters of Hapag-Lloyd in Hamburg The Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Aktien- Gesellschaft for shipping across the Atlantic Ocean was founded in Hamburg. In 1912, Hapag built the first of their \\"Big Three\\" ocean liners; the Imperator, followed by her sister Vaterland. The third sister, Bismarck, was under construction at the outbreak of World War I and was completed after the war for White Star Line as the Majestic. These were the first liners to exceed 50,000 gross tons and 900 feet in length. During World War I, the majority of Hapag's fleet of 175 ships were wiped out, and most of the surviving ships (including the \\"Big Three\\") had to be turned over to the winning side as war reparations. After war's end, Hapag rebuilt its fleet with much smaller ships than before the war, but their fleet was again mostly wiped out during World War II, with surviving ships turned over to allied powers. =North German Lloyd= The NDL liner Kaiser Wilhelm II, which made its maiden voyage in 1903 Bremen and Europa Norddeutscher Lloyd (NDL) was formed in 1857 in the City- State of Bremen, offering passenger and cargo transportation between Bremen and New York, with an emphasis on emigration to the United States. Service started in June 1858 with the Bremen, the first of four steamships, and the company established its American base at Hoboken, New Jersey. NDL eventually built a large fleet of ships that carried many thousands of emigrants westwards, with around 218,000 passengers transported across the Atlantic in 1913 alone. The outbreak of World War I resulted in the internment of 32 vessels in US ports, a status later changed to confiscation when the US entered the war in 1917. Likewise, its Hoboken base was confiscated, and turned over to the US Navy, which used it as a transshipping point for the duration. As with HAPAG, those NDL ships surviving the war eventually were confiscated as reparation, leaving the company to start over from scratch. US- Operations were resumed in 1922, when NDL was able to purchase its former base from the United States Alien Property Administrator. NDL launched a new Bremen and Europa in 1929‚Äì30. During World War II, NDL repeated its World War I experience, with some parts of its fleet again being interned at the outbreak of the war, while a number of vessels remained under NDL control.NDL Annual Report 1939-1948. P. 4. One such exception was the Bremen, which raced across the Atlantic, and achieved protection at Murmansk in 1939, before eventually making a dash for Bremerhaven, where she was ultimately destroyed by a fire in 1941. Passenger service resumed in 1954 with the Gripsholm formerly belonging to the Swedish American Line (the ship was renamed to only the following year). Later two other second-hand ships, (formerly Pasteur) and (formerly Swedish American Line's Kungsholm), were purchased. NDL attained several speed records over the years. Notable among them was the record for the run between Southampton and New York of eight days in 1881, which was set by the Elbe; and the record for the fastest transatlantic crossing set by the new Bremen in 1929 (see Blue Riband). =Hapag-Lloyd= Hapag-Lloyd container ship D√ºsseldorf Express The Colombo Express, 8700 TEU container ship owned and operated by Hapag-Lloyd Hapag and NGL continued to compete until establishing a joint-venture container line. The \\"Hapag-Lloyd Container Line\\", founded in 1967 and operating from 1968 onward, was established to share the huge investments related to the containerisation of the fleets. Both companies finally merged on September 1, 1970 under the name Hapag-Lloyd. Hapag-Lloyd was acquired in 1998 by Preussag AG (since 2002 called TUI AG (Hanover)), a tourism conglomerate, and became its fully owned subsidiary in 2002.\\"Hapag- Lloyd CEO: reduction in operational costs needed\\", Arabian Supply Chain, 30 March 2015.

Industry speculation predicted a sale price of approximately $US5.9 billion. Airline activities Hapag-Lloyd founded the charter airline Hapag-Lloyd Flug in 1972, buying a few Boeing 727s to fly its cruise passengers from Germany to the cruises' ports of call. The airline eventually added some regular passenger flights as well. Hapag-Lloyd Flug used the IATA code HF and became a directly owned subsidiary of Preussag AG in 1999.\\"Facts and Figures.\\" Hapagfly. 1 June 2005. Retrieved on 29 May 2009.

The deal, which was approved by the boards of both CP Ships, TUI, and the shareholders, was a success, and made the combined fleet the fifth-largest by capacity in the worldwide container shipping market. =Hamburg S√ºd= In late 2012, Hapag-Lloyd announced it was considering the possibility of a merger with its smaller compatriot Hamburg S√ºd. The merger plans were scotched when Hamburg S√ºd's shareholders and owners did not reach an agreement with the Hapag-Lloyd stakeholders. After this event, Hamburg S√ºd remained a private, independent company until December 2016, when the container transport division of Danish logistics and energy company Maersk, announced it would purchase Hamburg S√ºd. =Compa√±√≠a Sud Americana de Vapores (CSAV)= In 2014, Hapag-Lloyd took over the container business of Chile's Compa√±√≠a Sud Americana de Vapores SA (CSAV), with the latter becoming a major shareholder of Hapag-Lloyd.

Accessed: 12 December 2014 =United Arab Shipping Company (UASC)= In April 2016, Hapag-Lloyd announced it was in merger talks with the United Arab Shipping Company (UASC). The merger was agreed upon later in 2016 and the integration between the two companies was completed in 2017. At the time of the merger, UASC was reported to be the world's 10th largest liner shipping company with a fleet of 56 ships and a market share of 2.7 percent. As a result of the merger, Hapag-Lloyd strengthened its position as the world's fifth largest container transporter in terms of vessel capacity, ahead of Taiwan's Evergreen Line. As a result of the merger, the former shareholders of UASC would become the largest shareholder in the new entity, whilst Hapag- Lloyd would absorb all operations and assets of UASC. UASC mv Al Abdali Historically United Arab Shipping Company was jointly established in July 1976 by the six shareholding governments of the Arab states of the Gulf (Bahrain, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and U.A.E). Originally based in Kuwait, its corporate headquarters then moved to Dubai during the Iraqi conflict, and only some departments were moved back after the war. The UASC fleet operated more than 45 services, connecting the Middle East to Europe, the Mediterranean, Indian Sub-continent, Far East, West Africa and the Americas. Its network covered over 220 ports, offering containerized and conventional cargo shipping by a fleet of 58 owned and chartered vessels. On June 29, 2016, UASC's six shareholding states voted unanimously to approve the proposed merger. The deal gave a relative valuation of the two businesses at 72 percent for Hapag-Lloyd and 28 percent for UASC. At the time of the merger, UASC was 51 percent owned by Qatar and 35 percent owned by Saudi Arabia government, with the remainder held by other Arab states.

Fragmentary translation probably began in the 2nd century CE, and the famous Ten Stages Sutra, often treated as an individual scripture, was first translated in the 3rd century. The first complete Chinese version was translated by Buddhabhadra around 420 in 60 scrolls with 34 chapters, and the second by around 699 in 80 scrolls with 40 chapters.Hamar, Imre (2007), The History of the BuddhƒÅvata·πÉsaka S≈´tra.

The second translation includes more sutras than the first, and the Tibetan translation, which is still later, includes many differences with the 80 scrolls version.

The single extant Tibetan version was translated from the original Sanskrit by Jinamitra et al. at the end of ninth century.Hamar, Imre (Editor). Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism (ASIATISCHE FORSCHUNGEN), 2007, page 87 According to ParamƒÅrtha, a 6th-century monk from Ujjain in central India, the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra is also called the \\"Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka.\\" In his translation of the MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgrahabhƒÅ·π£ya, there is a reference to the Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka, which ParamƒÅrtha notes is the same as the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra in 100,000 lines. Identification of the Avata·πÉsaka S≈´tra as a \\"Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka\\" was also recorded in the colophon of a Chinese manuscript at the Mogao Caves: \\"Explication of the Ten Stages, entitled Creator of the Wisdom of an Omniscient Being by Degrees, a chapter of the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tra Bodhisattvapi·π≠aka BuddhƒÅvata·πÉsaka, has ended.\\"  Overview  Illustration of the Avatamsaka Sutra at Songgwangsa in Suncheon, Korea. The sutra, among the longest Buddhist sutras, is a compilation of disparate texts on various topics such as the Bodhisattva path, the interpenetration of phenomena (dharmas), the visionary powers of meditation and the equality of things in emptiness.Takeuchi Yoshinori (editor). Buddhist Spirituality: Indian, Southeast Asian, Tibetan, and Early Chinese, page 160 According to Paul Demi√©ville, the collection is \\"characterized by overflowing visionary images, which multiply everything to infinity, by a type of monadology that teaches the interpenetration of the one whole and the particularized many, of spirit and matter\\" and by \\"the notion of a gradual progress towards liberation through successive stages and an obsessive preference for images of light and radiance.\\"Takeuchi Yoshinori (editor). Buddhist Spirituality: Indian, Southeast Asian, Tibetan, and Early Chinese, page 161 Likewise, Alan Fox has described the sutra's worldview as \\"fractal\\", \\"holographic\\" and \\"psychedelic\\".Fox, Alan. The Practice of Huayan Buddhism, 2015.04, http://www.fgu.edu.tw/~cbs/pdf/2013%E8%AB%96%E6%96%87%E9%9B%86/q16.pdf The East Asian view of the text is that it expresses the universe as seen by a Buddha (the Dharmadhatu), who sees all phenomena as empty and thus infinitely interpenetrating, from the point of view of enlightenment. This interpenetration is described in the Avatamsaka as the perception \\"that the fields full of assemblies, the beings and aeons which are as many as all the dust particles, are all present in every particle of dust.\\"Paul Williams, Anthony Tribe, Alexander Wynne. Buddhist Thought: A Complete Introduction to the Indian Tradition, page 168. Thus, a buddha's view of reality is also said to be \\"inconceivable; no sentient being can fathom it\\". Paul Williams notes that the sutra speaks of both Yogacara and Madhyamaka doctrines, stating that all things are empty of inherent existence and also of a \\"pure untainted awareness or consciousness (amalacitta) as the ground of all phenomena\\".Williams, Paul. MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, page 121. The Avatamsaka sutra also highlights the visionary and mystical power of attaining the spiritual wisdom which sees the nature of the world: > Endless action arises from the mind; from action arises the multifarious > world. Having understood that the world's true nature is mind, you display > bodies of your own in harmony with the world. Having realized that this > world is like a dream, and that all Buddhas are like mere reflections, that > all principles [dharma] are like an echo, you move unimpeded in the world > (Trans in Gomez, 1967: lxxxi) As a result of their meditative power, Buddhas have the magical ability to create and manifest infinite forms, and they do this in many skillful ways out of great compassion for all beings.Williams, Paul. MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, page 122. > :In all atoms of all lands :Buddha enters, each and every one, :Producing > miracle displays for sentient beings: :Such is the way of Vairocana.... :The > techniques of the Buddhas are inconceivable, :All appearing in accord with > beings‚Äô minds.... :In each atom the Buddhas of all times :Appear, according > to inclinations; :While their essential nature neither comes nor goes, :By > their vow power they pervade the worlds.(Cleary 1984‚Äì7: I, Bk 4) The point of these teachings is to lead all beings through the ten bodhisattva levels to the goal of Buddhahood (which is done for sake of all other beings). These stages of spiritual attainment are also widely discussed in various parts of the sutra (book 15, book 26). The sutra also includes numerous Buddhas and their Buddhalands which are said to be infinite, representing a vast cosmic view of reality, though it centers on a most important figure, the Buddha Vairocana (great radiance). Vairocana is a cosmic being who is the source of light and enlightenment of the 'Lotus universe', who is said to contain all world systems. According to Paul Williams, the Buddha \\"is said or implied at various places in this vast and heterogeneous sutra to be the universe itself, to be the same as ‚Äòabsence of intrinsic existence‚Äô or emptiness, and to be the Buddha's all-pervading omniscient awareness.\\" The very body of Vairocana is also seen as a reflection of the whole universe: > The body of [Vairocana] Buddha is inconceivable. In his body are all sorts > of lands of sentient beings. Even in a single pore are countless vast > oceans.Ry√ªichi Ab√©. The Weaving of Mantra: K√ªkai and the Construction of > Esoteric Buddhist Discourse, page 285 Also, for the Avatamsaka, the historical Buddha Sakyamuni is simply a magical emanation of the cosmic Buddha Vairocana. Sections and Themes Luis Gomez notes that there is an underlying order to the collection. The discourses in the sutra version with 39 chapters are delivered to eight different audiences or \\"assemblies\\" in seven locations such as Bodh Gaya and the Tusita Heaven. Following the Chinese tradition, Gomez states that the major themes in each \\"assembly\\" are:Takeuchi Yoshinori (editor).

These two are the only sections of the Avatamsaka which survive in Sanskrit. = Ten Stages = The sutra is also well known for its detailed description of the course of the bodhisattva's practice through ten stages where the Ten Stages Sutra, or ' (, ), is the name given to this chapter of the '. This sutra gives details on the ten stages (bh≈´mis) of development a bodhisattva must undergo to attain supreme enlightenment. The ten stages are also depicted in the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra and the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra. The sutra also touches on the subject of the development of the \\"aspiration for Enlightenment\\" (bodhicitta) to attain supreme buddhahood. = Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha = Sudhana learning from one of the fifty- two teachers along his journey toward enlightenment. Sanskrit manuscript, 11-12th century. The last chapter of the Avatamsaka circulates as a separate and important text known as the Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha Sutra (, or 'bouquet'; ‚ÄòEntering the Dharma Realm‚Äô). Considered the \\"climax\\" of the larger text, this section details the pilgrimage of the layman Sudhana to various lands (worldly and supra-mundane) at the behest of the bodhisattva Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ to find a spiritual friend who will instruct him in the ways of a bodhisattva. According to Luis Gomez, this sutra can also be \\"regarded as emblematic of the whole collection.\\" Despite the former being at the end of the Avata·πÉsaka, the Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha and the Ten Stages are generally believed to be the oldest written chapters of the sutra.

Nicknamed \\"The Human Horn\\", he is noted for his highly idiosyncratic scat style, using sounds and syllables quite unlike those used by other scat singers. Writing in the New York Times, Marc Ferris noted that \\"those who seek out music that swims against the mainstream have been entranced by [Taylor's] originality.\\" Music historian Irwin Chusid described Taylor as \\"the world's weirdest scat singer,\\" \\"100 percent uninhibited and soulful, in a lovably demented way,\\" and stated that \\"a joyousness permeates [his] performances, a celebratory quality that serves as an analgesic for temporary relief from existential pain.\\" Biography Shooby Taylor was born in Indiana Township, Pennsylvania and, at an early age, moved with his family to Harlem, where he spent the majority of his life. He entered the army in 1953 and began working for the U.S. Post Office following his discharge in 1955. A long-time jazz fan, he claimed he heard sounds in his head and felt the need to express them. After attempting to learn the saxophone, he realized he could instead employ his voice as an instrument, declaring \\"I am the horn!\\" He began studying at the Hartnett Music School in New York under the GI Bill, and performed at Harlem clubs and in Greenwich Village jam sessions, emulating the vocal style of Babs Gonzales. He claimed to have gotten permission from Dizzy Gillespie to use the nickname \\"Shooby,\\" and adopted the moniker \\"Shooby Taylor, The Human Horn.\\" After retiring from the Post Office in the early 1970s, Taylor devoted his time to music, making numerous home recordings. In 1983, Taylor briefly appeared on the show Amateur Night at the Apollo, but was booed off the stage after roughly twenty seconds. At around that time, he paid multiple visits to Angel Sound Studios in New York, where he recorded a number of tracks, and where he came to the attention of studio engineer Craig Bradley, who recalled \\"I was attuned to the unusual... Shooby was an exciting character, someone you were drawn to right away.\\" Bradley later transferred the tracks to cassette and sent copies to WFMU manager Ken Freedman, who, with Irwin Chusid, began broadcasting and circulating them, leading to a growing cult following for Taylor and \\"generating a frothing fan base\\". Taylor, however, was unaware of the publicity, and his fans were unaware of his whereabouts. In 1992, Shooby moved to a senior complex in Newark, New Jersey, and in 1994, he experienced a stroke that crippled his scat skill, stopping him from recording and performing. In July 2002, Elektra Records executive and Taylor fan Rick Goetz managed to track Taylor down by cold calling every person named William Taylor in the New York area. On August 28, 2002, Shooby appeared for a radio interview on WFMU, leading to further publicity. Following the broadcast, Goetz and Chusid transferred a number of Taylor's home recordings to CD-R to preserve some of his legacy. In September of that year, WFMU staff delivered birthday greetings to Taylor from fans around the world. Taylor died on June 4, 2003 at the VA Hospital in East Orange, New Jersey. Plans for an official CD release of his work are still pending. Style and Reception Marc Ferris wrote that Taylor's music can be \\"difficult to digest. As he tries to approximate the sound of a saxophone solo with his voice, he hits sour notes. He spits out nonsense syllables like a machine gun, communicating in a private language nearly impossible to imitate. And he rarely meshes with his background music.\\" Allmusic reviewer Jason Ankeny described his music as \\"singular and eccentric... equal parts nonsense words, off-tempo vocalese, and saxophone-inspired squawks.\\" Irwin Chusid wrote that Taylor's scatting \\"echoes Mother Goose nonsense simmering in a rich Afro- Yiddish stew.\\" According to Chusid, \\"Shooby's vocabulary is a whole 'nuther language. Some of his favorite scat syllables are 'Raw-shaw,' 'poppy-poppy,' and 'splaw,' sputtered in a virile baritone vaguely reminiscent of Dudley Do- Right, the chaos-prone Canadian Mountie,\\" and \\"his lung capacity is staggering; he never pauses long enough to inhale as he spews out astonishing high-octane vocal runs.\\" Singer Joe Henry described Taylor's singing as \\"a cross between scat singing and speaking in tongues,\\" stating that it was \\"unlike anything I've ever heard in my life. A lot of people who hear it think of it like a novelty, but I hear it as a man who's completely come out of a vacuum and developed an approach to music that's as unique as Charlie Parker... I can't stop listening to it. It's so full of a kind of passion that I can't even begin to describe.\\" While scatting, Taylor would frequently mime playing an \\"air\\" saxophone. Craig Bradley recalled that all of Taylor's recordings were first takes: \\"I think he was just winging it, improvising. So even if we did a second take, it wouldn't be to fix mistakes, it would just be a different version. But he was happy with his performance every time.\\" Legacy The Adam and Joe Show, a UK TV series from the 1990s, used the first 4 seconds of Taylor's version of \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\", at the start of their theme tune. In the 2000 song \\"Walk & Chew Gum\\" by the band Optiganally Yours, there is a mention of \\"Shooby Taylor\\" in the last line of their scat-like bridge. In 2005, Taylor made a posthumous appearance on a split 7-inch EP by Xiu Xiu and The Dead Science. In the 2016 Illumination Entertainment animated film Sing, a recording of Taylor's rendition of \\"Stout Hearted Man\\" is used for one of the auditions. In 2019, Taylor was the subject of a BBC 4 radio broadcast by Adam Buxton. Musicians Tom Waits and Marshall Crenshaw are fans of Taylor's music, with Crenshaw proclaiming Taylor \\"The King of Farfisa-Wielding, Outer-Space, Lunatic-Fringe Scat Singers.\\" Discography * Ink Spots - You Were Only Foolin' / Miles Davis - The Theme / Wolfgang Mozart - Rondeau, Allegretto (cassette) * Blowing My Mind (1970, Shooby Records, 45 RPM vinyl) * Expressing Myself (parts 1 & 2) as \\"Shooby Taylor the Human Instrument\\" (January 1971, Shooby Records) * The Human Horn (and then some) - Dexter Gordon / Coltrane / Elvis (1980s, cassette) * The Human Horn (and then some) - Johnny Cash (1980s, cassette) * The Human Horn (and then some) - Country & Jazz (1980s, cassette) * The Human Horn (2001, WFMU, cassette/MP3) * The Human Horn (Side One) (2017, Apple Music) * The Human Horn (Side Two) (2017, Apple Music) References External links * 1929 births 2003 deaths People from Indiana Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania Singers from Pennsylvania Outsider musicians Scat singers Singers from New York City 20th-century American singers People from Harlem Stroke survivors ","title":"Shooby Taylor"},{"id":"293834","text":"Derek and the Dominos were an English‚ÄìAmerican blues-rock band formed in the spring of 1970 by guitarist and singer Eric Clapton, keyboardist and singer Bobby Whitlock, bassist Carl Radle and drummer Jim Gordon. All four members had previously played together in Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, during and after Clapton's brief tenure with Blind Faith. Dave Mason supplied additional lead guitar on early studio sessions and played at their first live gig. Another participant at their first session as a band was George Harrison, the recording for whose album All Things Must Pass marked the formation of Derek and the Dominos. The band released only one studio album, Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, produced by Tom Dowd, which also featured extensive contributions on lead and slide guitar from Duane Allman. A double album, Layla did not immediately enjoy strong sales or receive widespread radio airplay, but went on to earn critical acclaim. Although released in 1970 it was not until March 1972 that the album's single \\"Layla\\" (a tale of unrequited love inspired by Clapton's infatuation with his friend Harrison's wife, Pattie Boyd) made the top ten in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The album is often considered to be the defining achievement of Clapton's career. History =Background and formation= Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, a soul band fronted by Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett. Derek and the Dominos came about through its four members' involvement in the American soul revue Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. The group were anchored by the musical duo Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett with a rotating ensemble of supporting members. Delaney & Bonnie and Friends supported Blind Faith, Eric Clapton's short-lived supergroup with Stevie Winwood, on a US tour in the summer of 1969. While on that tour, Clapton was drawn to Delaney & Bonnie's relative anonymity, which he found more appealing than the excessive fan worship lavished on his own band.The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, pp. 88, 183, 254. Together with his fellow future Dominos ‚Äì Bobby Whitlock (vocals, keyboards), Carl Radle (bass) and Jim Gordon (drums) ‚Äì Clapton toured Europe and the United States again between November 1969 and March 1970, this time as a member of Delaney & Bonnie and Friends.Whitlock, pp. 52, 60. In addition, the entire band backed him on his debut solo album, Eric Clapton,Reid, pp. xiii, 29. recorded over the same period. Disagreements over money led several members to leave Delaney & Bonnie and Friends. Whitlock, recalling other difficulties with Delaney and Bonnie, noted the couple's frequent fights and described Delaney as a demanding band leader in the manner of James Brown.The Layla Sessions liner notes, page 5.Santoro, p. 63. Gordon, Radle and other Friends personnel, including drummer Jim Keltner, immediately joined Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour with Leon Russell, but Whitlock remained with the Delaney and Bonnie for a short time. In April 1970, at the suggestion of his friend and mentor Steve Cropper,Whitlock, p. 65. Whitlock travelled to England to visit Clapton.Harris, p. 70. Whitlock subsequently lived in Hurtwood Edge, Clapton's house in Surrey, where the two musicians jammed and began to write the bulk of the Dominos' catalogue on acoustic guitars. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Many of the new songs reflected Clapton's growing infatuation with Pattie Boyd, the wife of his best friend George Harrison, who had joined Clapton as a guitarist on Delaney & Bonnie's European tour in December 1969.Clayson, pp. 275, 277‚Äì79. Soon after Whitlock's arrival, he and Clapton were eager to form a new bandWhitlock, p. 73. and contacted Radle and Gordon in the United States. Although their first choice for a drummer was Keltner ‚Äì like Radle and Russell, a native of TulsaReid, pp. 42, 47. ‚Äì he was busy recording with jazz guitarist G√°bor Szab√≥. Gordon, however, had been invited to London to work on Harrison's post- Beatles solo album All Things Must Pass. In May that year, Clapton, Whitlock, Radle and Gordon reunited in London at a session for P.P. Arnold,Harris, p. 72. before going on to serve as the backing band on much of Harrison's album. In a 1990 interview, Clapton said, \\"We made our bones, really, on that album with George\\", since the four musicians had \\"no game plan\\" other than living at Hurtwood Edge, \\"getting stoned, and playing and semi-writing songs\\". Clapton biographer Harry Shapiro comments on the unprecedented aspect of Clapton's bond with his new bandmates, in that from the Blind Faith tour onwards, the guitarist \\"had been able to build a working relationship in a slow and natural fashion\\" for the first time. Among the friendships formed before the group officially came into existence, Shapiro continues, \\"the empathy ... outcropped most noticeably in Bobby Whitlock, in whom Eric found an accomplished and sympathetic songwriting partner and back-up vocalist.\\"Shapiro, p. 118. Clapton and Whitlock considered adding the Delaney & Bonnie horn section to their new band, but this plan was abandoned. Whitlock later explained the ethos of Derek and the Dominos: \\"we didn't want any horns, we didn't want no chicks, we wanted a rock 'n' roll band. But my vocal concept was that we approach singing like Sam and Dave did: [Clapton] sings a line, I sing a line, we sing together.\\"Santoro, p. 64. =Concert debut= Towards the end of the sessions for the basic tracks on All Things Must Pass, Dave Mason ‚Äì another former guitarist with Delaney & BonnieReid, p. 47. ‚Äì joined the Dominos at Clapton's home.Shapiro, pp. 115, 116. With the lineup expanded to a five-piece band, Derek and the Dominos gave their debut live performance on 14 June 1970.Shapiro, p. 115. The event was a charity concert in aid of the Dr Spock Civil Liberties Legal Defence Fund, held at London's Lyceum Theatre. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). The group had been billed as \\"Eric Clapton and Friends\\", but a discussion ensued backstage just before their appearance, with HarrisonClayson, p. 290. and pianist Tony Ashton among those involved, in an effort to find a proper band name. Clapton recalls that Ashton suggested \\"Del and the Dominos\\",Clapton, p. 133. having taken to calling the guitarist \\"Derek\\" or \\"Del\\" since the Delaney & Bonnie tour the previous year. Whitlock maintains that \\"the Dynamics\\" was the name chosen and that Ashton, following his opening set with Ashton, Gardner and Dyke, mispronounced it when introducing the band. Writing in 2013, Clapton and Whitlock biographer Marc Roberty quoted Jeff Dexter, the compere at the Lyceum show, who recalled that \\"Derek and the Dominos\\" had already been decided on before they went on stage. According to Dexter, Clapton was immediately taken with the name, but Whitlock, Radle and Gordon ‚Äì all Americans ‚Äì were concerned that they might be mistaken for a doo-wop act. The reception afforded the band from critics and fans was mixed.Reid, pp. 104‚Äì05.Shapiro, pp. 115‚Äì16. Together with the unfavourable reviews for Clapton's eponymous solo album, particularly in Britain, this reaction was reflective of a widespread reluctance to view Clapton as a singer and frontman, rather than as the virtuoso guitarist synonymous with his role in bands such as Cream and the Yardbirds.Sandford, pp. 112, 114, 116. In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton wrote that his main recollection of the Lyceum show was consulting New Orleans‚Äìborn musician Dr. John, a self-styled practitioner of voodoo,The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, p. 276. and receiving a package made of straw that would serve as a means of winning Boyd's affection.Clapton, pp. 133‚Äì34. =Recording with Phil Spector= In return for the Dominos' assistance on All Things Must Pass, Clapton and Harrison had agreed that the latter's co-producer, Phil Spector, would produce a single for the new group.Reid, pp. 92‚Äì93, 105. On 18 June, the five band members, together with Harrison on guitar, took part in a session for the single at the Beatles' Apple Studio in central London.Madinger & Easter, p. 427.Reid, pp. 104, 105. With Spector producing, two Clapton‚ÄìWhitlock compositions were recorded that dayClapton, p. 132. ‚Äì \\"Tell the Truth\\" and \\"Roll It Over\\" ‚Äì along with two instrumental jams that would be included on the Apple Jam disc of Harrison's triple album.Whitlock, p. 82. After this London session, Mason departed from the lineup; he later told Melody Maker that he was impatient to see the band start working full-time whereas Clapton was committed to helping Harrison complete All Things Must Pass.Clayson, pp. 289, 478. Clapton and Whitlock then contributed to the overdubbing phase of Harrison's album, including adding backing vocals with Harrison (as \\"the George O'Hara-Smith Singers\\") to tracks such as \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Awaiting on You All\\".Whitlock, p. 81. In addition, while continuing to rehearse at Hurtwood Edge,Shapiro, p. 116. all four band members participated in London sessions for Dr. John's album The Sun, Moon & Herbs (1971).Reid, p. 105. =UK summer tour= Early in the summer of 1970, Clapton asked former Apple Records employee Chris O'Dell to find accommodation for Whitlock, Gordon and Radle in central London, telling O'Dell that they were \\"going bonkers\\" out in the Surrey countryside.O'Dell, p. 170. The band then moved into a two-storey flat at 33 Thurloe Place,Whitlock, p. 98. close to South Kensington tube station.O'Dell, pp. 170‚Äì71. The flat also served as a meeting place for Clapton and Boyd,O'Dell, p. 172. who found herself flattered by Clapton's attention in light of her husband's infidelities and his preoccupation with Eastern spirituality.Boyd, pp. 119‚Äì20, 135, 138. In his autobiography, Clapton wrote that he was both inspired and \\"tormented\\" by his feelings for Boyd, which he channelled into his music, beginning with a UK tour by Derek and the Dominos.Clapton, p. 135. For three weeks from 1 August,\\"Clapton hits the road\\", Melody Maker magazine, July 18, 1970, p. 3. the group performed in clubs and other small venues in Britain,Reid, p. 107. where Clapton chose to play anonymously, still weary from the fame that he felt had plagued Cream and Blind Faith.The Layla Sessions liner notes, page 4. Admission for the shows was set at ¬£1, and clauses in the contract with each venue stipulated that Clapton's name was not to be used as a crowd-puller. Shapiro writes that the band had \\"made great strides\\" since the Lyceum concert; their set list included \\"Tell the Truth\\",Sandford, p. 116. covers of Billy Myles' \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" and Jimi Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\", and songs such as \\"Bottle of Red Wine\\" and \\"Don't Know Why\\", both from the Eric Clapton album. Clapton has said of this UK tour, \\"no one knew who we were, and I loved it. I loved the fact that we were this little quartet, playing in obscure places, sometimes to audiences of no more than fifty or sixty people.\\" =Layla sessions= The band flew to Miami, Florida, on 23 August 1970 to begin recording with Atlantic Records producer Tom Dowd. Until early September,Santoro, p. 62. sessions took place at Criteria Studios for what became the double album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. Most of the material, particularly the track \\"Layla\\", was inspired by Clapton's unrequited love for Boyd. After Clapton and Whitlock's initial experimentation with heroin while recording All Things Must Pass, the band's time in Miami was marked by all four members' excessive use of hard drugs.Shapiro, p. 120. According to Clapton, \\"We were staying in this hotel on the beach, and whatever drug you wanted, you could get it at the newsstand. The girl would just take your orders.\\" The Thunderbird Motel, in current Sunny Isles Beach, Florida.Eric Clapton: A Life in 12 Bars (2017) The first few days of the Layla sessions were unproductive. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required).Santoro, p. 66. On 26 August, Dowd, who was also producing the Allman Brothers Band's album Idlewild South, took the Dominos to an Allman Brothers concert, where Clapton, already a fan of the Nashville-born guitarist, first heard Duane Allman play in person.The Layla Sessions liner notes, page 6. After Clapton invited the whole band back to Criteria that night,Reid, p. 123. he and Allman formed an instant bond that provided the catalyst for the Layla album.Santoro, pp. 66‚Äì67. Over ten recording dates, Allman contributed to most of the tracks on the album, in between his commitments to the Allman Brothers Band. Only three songs ‚Äì \\"I Looked Away\\", \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" and \\"Keep on Growing\\" ‚Äì were recorded without his participation. The band remade \\"Tell the Truth\\" during the sessions and subsequently attempted to have the Spector-produced single cancelled.Sandford, p. 117. In the United States, Atco Records released the original version of \\"Tell the Truth\\" backed with \\"Roll It Over\\" in September, but soon withdrew the single. Clapton has described Allman as \\"the musical brother that I never had, but wished I did\\".Clapton, p. 136. Allman's slide guitar playing elevated the album's blues covers, which included \\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\" (by Jimmy Cox), \\"Have You Ever Loved a Woman\\" (the Billy Myles song, originally recorded by Freddie King) and \\"Key to the Highway\\" (Big Bill Broonzy).Santoro, pp. 67‚Äì68. Clapton invited him to become a member of Derek and the Dominos, but Allman demurred, choosing to remain loyal to his own band. According to Whitlock, however, Allman was \\"a hired gun\\" and an \\"unnecessary\\" addition; Whitlock added, \\"He played with us twice, and it was not good both times he played, because he was not a fluid player ... He could play parts, but he couldn‚Äôt sing with his guitar.\\" The jams from Allman's first night at Criteria with the Dominos were issued on the second CD of The Layla Sessions: 20th Anniversary Edition in 1990. The album's best-known track, \\"Layla\\", was compiled from recordings from two separate sessions. The main, guitar-oriented section was taped on 9 September, after the band had recorded their version of Hendrix's \\"Little Wing\\"; the closing section was added several weeks later, after Clapton had decided that the song lacked a suitable ending. The answer was an elegiac piano piece composed by Gordon (and an uncredited Rita Coolidge) and played by the drummer, with Whitlock providing a second piano part to cover Gordon's relative inexperience on the instrument. During the Layla sessions, Gordon had been writing and playing songs for an intended solo album when, by chance, Clapton first heard the piano piece. According to Clapton's recollection, in return for continuing to use the Dominos' studio time for his own project, Gordon agreed to have the segment used as the ending for \\"Layla\\". =October‚ÄìDecember 1970 live shows= Eric Clapton, Carl Radle, and Duane Allman live at the Curtis Hixon Hall in Tampa, one of the two shows in which Allman appeared After the recording of Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, the four-piece Derek and the Dominos returned to the UK to continue touring there before heading back to America to start the US tour on 15 October. Allman performed two shows with the group near the end of the US tour: at Curtis Hixon Hall, in Tampa, Florida, on 1 December, and at the Onondaga County War Memorial in Syracuse, New York, the following night. Whitlock recalled of their drug consumption during the tour: \\"We didn't have little bits of anything. There were no grams around, let's just put it like that. Tom couldn't believe it, the way we had these big bags laying out everywhere. I'm almost ashamed to tell it, but it's the truth. It was scary, what we were doing, but we were just young and dumb and didn't know. Cocaine and heroin, that's all and Johnny Walker.\\"The Layla Sessions liner notes, page 12. Elton John, who opened for them, said that despite the reports of drugs and booze ‚ÄòThey were phenomenal. From the side of the stage, I took mental notes of their performance‚Ä¶it was their keyboard player Bobby Whitlock that I watched like a hawk‚Ä¶. You watched and you learned, from people that had more experience than you.‚Äô In 1973, a live double album, titled In Concert, was released, culled from the band's October 1970 shows at the Fillmore East in New York City. Six of the recordings from that album were digitally remastered and expanded with additional material from the same shows to become Live at the Fillmore, released in 1994. =Album release= Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs was issued in November 1970. According to Shapiro, relative to the band and Dowd's high expectations, it was a \\"critical and commercial flop\\". Clapton similarly describes Layla as having \\"died a death\\" on release.Clapton, pp. 136‚Äì37. Although it received favourable reviews in Rolling Stone and The Village Voice, the album missed the top ten in the United States and failed to chart at all in the United Kingdom, until a reissue on CD resulted in a one-week stay at number 68 in 2011. It garnered little attention,Santoro, p. 69. partly as a result of a lack of promotion by Polydor, and partly due to the public's ignorance of Clapton's presence in the band.Shapiro, p. 123. Dowd said that he \\"felt it was the best album I'd been involved with since The Genius of Ray Charles\\" and was disappointed at the lack of acclaim it initially received. \\"Layla\\" was included on The History of Eric Clapton in 1972, and Atlantic issued the song as a single in July that year. It became a hit, reaching number 10 in America and number 7 in Britain.Sandford, p. 119. The success of the title track in 1972 led to a reappraisal of Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. It has since received widespread critical acclaim and has been ranked among the best albums of all time by VH1 (at number 89). and Rolling Stone (number 115). Layla is considered one of Clapton's most outstanding achievements. =Johnny Cash Show appearance= The band appeared on The Johnny Cash Show, in their only television appearance. Filmed at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, Tennessee, and broadcast on 6 January 1971, the band performed \\"It's Too Late\\" and then joined Cash and Carl Perkins to play Perkins' \\"Matchbox\\". =Tragedy and dissolution= Tragedy and misfortune dogged the group throughout and following its brief career. In September 1970, Clapton was devastated by the death of his friend and professional rival Jimi Hendrix; having just recorded a version of \\"Little Wing\\" in Miami, the Dominos included the track on Layla as a tribute to Hendrix. In October 1971, Duane Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident. Clapton later wrote in his autobiography that he and Allman had been inseparable during the sessions at Criteria.Clapton, p. 128. In addition, Clapton took the lukewarm critical and commercial reception to Layla personally, which accelerated his spiral into drug addiction and depression. In 1985 when talking about the band, Clapton said: > We were a make-believe band. We were all hiding inside it. Derek and the > Dominos ‚Äì the whole thing. So it couldn't last. I had to come out and admit > that I was being me. I mean, being Derek was a cover for the fact that I was > trying to steal someone else's wife. That was one of the reasons for doing > it, so that I could write the song, and even use another name for Pattie. So > Derek and Layla ‚Äì it wasn't real at all.DeCurtis, Anthony (May 1998). > Rocking My Life Away, Duke University Press, Bobby Whitlock in 1972 In February 1971, Radle and Gordon participated in sessions, produced by Spector and Harrison, for a planned solo album by Ronnie Spector.Madinger & Easter, p. 434. Later that year, the Dominos disbanded acrimoniously in London, just before they could complete their second LP. In a subsequent interview with music critic Robert Palmer, Clapton said the second album \\"broke down halfway through because of the paranoia and tension. And the band just dissolved.\\" After the dissolution, Clapton turned away from touring and recording to nurse an intense heroin addiction.Harris, p. 74. This three- year career hiatus was interrupted only by his participation in Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh shows in August 1971, along with a large cast of musicians, including Leon Russell, Keltner and Radle;Clayson, pp. 309‚Äì310, 313. a guest appearance at Russell's December 1971 show at London's Rainbow Theatre;Shapiro, pp. 123‚Äì24. and his own Rainbow Concert, in January 1973. The latter event was organised by Pete Townshend of the Who to help Clapton kick his drug habit and build momentum for his return.The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, p. 183.Shapiro, pp. 126‚Äì27. Whitlock signed with the US record label ABC-Dunhill, for which he recorded the albums Bobby Whitlock and Raw Velvet. Both albums were released in 1972 and included contributions from all the Dominos (recorded in early 1971), along with Harrison, the Bramletts, Keltner, and the former Delaney & Bonnie horn section. Following Clapton's return as a solo artist in 1974, he and Radle worked together until 1979, when Clapton abruptly dismissed him from his band. Radle died in June 1980 of complications from a kidney infectionShapiro, p. 152. associated with alcohol and drug use.[ Whitlock and Clapton did not work together again until 2000, when they performed on Jools Holland's BBC show Later... with Jools Holland. In 1983, Gordon, an undiagnosed schizophrenic at the time, killed his mother with a hammer during a psychotic episode. He was confined to a mental institution in 1984,Sandford, p. 120. where he remains today.Romanowski, Patricia (2003).

Etymology The term F«éxi√†ng itself was first applied to this tradition by the Huayan teacher Fazang (), who used it to characterize Consciousness Only teachings as provisional, dealing with the phenomenal appearances of the dharmas. Chinese proponents preferred the title W√©ish√≠ (), meaning \\"Consciousness Only\\" (Sanskrit Vij√±aptimƒÅtra). This school may also be called W√©ish√≠ Y√∫jiƒÅx√≠ng P√†i ( \\"Consciousness-Only YogƒÅcƒÅra School\\") or Y«íu Z≈çng ( \\"School of Existence\\"). Yin Shun also introduced a threefold classification for Buddhist teachings which designates this school as X≈´w√†ng W√©ish√≠ X√¨ ( \\"False Imagination Mere Consciousness System\\"). Characteristics Like the parent YogƒÅcƒÅra school, the Faxiang school teaches that understanding of reality comes from one's own mind, rather than actual empirical experience. The mind distorts reality and projects it as reality itself. In keeping with YogƒÅcƒÅra tradition, the mind is divided into the Eight Consciousnesses and the Four Aspects of Cognition, which produce what we view as reality. Faxiang Buddhism also maintained the Five Natures Doctrine () which brought it into doctrinal conflict with the Tiantai school in China. History in China Xuanzang Memorial Hall in Nalanda, Bihar, India Statue of Xuanzang at Giant Wild Goose Pagoda in Xi'an, China =Early history and teachers= Translations of Indian YogƒÅcƒÅra texts were first introduced to China in the early fifth century. Among these was Gu·πáabhadra's translation of the La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra in four fascicles, which would also become important in the early history of Chan Buddhism. During the sixth century CE, the Indian monk and translator ParamƒÅrtha widely propagated YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings in China. His translations include the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra, the MadhyƒÅntavibhƒÅga-kƒÅrikƒÅ, the Tri·πÉ≈õikƒÅ-vij√±aptimƒÅtratƒÅ, and the MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha. ParamƒÅrtha also taught widely on the principles of Consciousness Only, and developed a large following in southern China. Many monks and laypeople traveled long distances to hear his teachings, especially those on the MahƒÅyƒÅnasa·πÉgraha. =Xuanzang and Kuiji= Although YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings had been propagated widely, most look to Xuanzang as the most important founder of East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra. At the age of 33, Xuanzang made a dangerous journey to India in order to study Buddhism there and to procure Buddhist texts for translation into Chinese. This journey was later the subject of legend and eventually fictionalized as the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West, a major component of East Asian popular culture from Chinese opera to Japanese television (Monkey Magic). Xuanzang spent over ten years in India traveling and studying under various Buddhist masters. These masters included ≈öƒ´labhadra, the abbot of the NƒÅlandƒÅ MahƒÅvihƒÅra, who was then 106 years old.Wei Tat. Cheng Weishi Lun. 1973. p. li Xuanzang was tutored in the YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings by ≈öƒ´labhadra for several years at NƒÅlandƒÅ. Upon his return from India, Xuanzang brought with him a wagon-load of Buddhist texts, including important YogƒÅcƒÅra works such as the YogƒÅcƒÅrabh≈´mi-≈õastra. In total, Xuanzang had procured 657 Buddhist texts from India. Upon his return to China, he was given government support and many assistants for the purpose of translating these texts into Chinese. As an important contribution to East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra, Xuanzang composed the treatise Cheng Weishi Lun, or \\"Discourse on the Establishment of Consciousness Only.\\" This work is framed around Vasubandhu's Tri·πÉ≈õikƒÅ-vij√±aptimƒÅtratƒÅ, or \\"Thirty Verses on Consciousness Only.\\" Xuanzang upheld Dharmapala of Nalanda's commentary on this work as being the correct one, and provided his own explanations of these as well as other views in the Cheng Weishi Lun. This work was composed at the behest of Xuanzang's disciple Kuiji, and became a central representation of East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra. Xuanzang also promoted devotional meditative practices toward Maitreya Bodhisattva. Xuanzang's disciple Kuiji wrote a number of important commentaries on the YogƒÅcƒÅra texts and further developed the influence of this doctrine in China, and was recognized by later adherents as the first true patriarch of the school. =Later history and the modern era= In time, Chinese YogƒÅcƒÅra was weakened due to competition with other Chinese Buddhist traditions such as Tiantai, Huayan, Chan and Pure Land Buddhism. Nevertheless, it continued to exert an influence, and Chinese Buddhists relied on its translations, commentaries, and concepts heavily, absorbing YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings into the other traditions. YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings and concepts remained popular in Chinese Buddhism, including visions of the bodhisattva Maitreya and teachings given from him in Tu·π£ita, usually observed by advanced meditators. One such example is that of Hanshan Deqing during the Ming dynasty. In his autobiography, Hanshan describes the palace of Maitreya in Tu·π£ita, and hearing a lecture given by Maitreya to a large group of his disciples. Hanshan recalls the teaching given as the following: In the early part of the 20th century, the laymen Yang Wenhui and Ouyang Jian (Ê≠êÈôΩÊº∏) (1871‚Äì1943) promoted Buddhist learning in China, and the general trend was for an increase in studies of Buddhist traditions such as YogƒÅcƒÅra, Sanlun, and Huayan. In his 1929 book on the history of Chinese Buddhism, Jiang Weiqiao wrote: Ouyang Jian founded the Chinese Institute of Inner Studies (), which provided education in YogƒÅcƒÅra teachings and the MahƒÅyƒÅna praj√±ƒÅ class of s≈´tras, given to both monastics and laypeople. Many modern Chinese Buddhist scholars are second-generation descendants of this school or have been influenced by it indirectly. History in Japan The Eastern Golden Hall or Tokondo (Êù±ÈáëÂ†Ç) of K≈çfuku-ji, Nara, Japan. Kofukuji Temple is the head temple of the Yogacara School in Japan The Consciousness-Only teachings were transmitted to Japan as Hoss≈ç, and they made considerable impact. One of the founders of the Hoss≈ç sect in Japan was Kuiji.Sho, Kyodai (2002). The Elementary-Level Textbook: Part 1: Gosho Study \\"Letter To The Brothers\\". SGI-USA Study Curriculum. Source: (accessed: January 8, 2007) Although a relatively small Hoss≈ç sect exists in Japan to this day, the sect has survived long after it died out in Korea and China, though its influence has diminished as the center of Buddhist authority moved away from Nara, and with the rise of the EkayƒÅna schools of Buddhism. During its height, scholars of the Hoss≈ç school frequently debated with other emerging schools. Both the founder of Shingon Buddhism, K≈´kai, and the founder of Tendai, Saich≈ç, exchanged letters of debate with Hoss≈ç scholar Tokuitsu, which became particularly heated in the case of Saich≈ç. Nevertheless, the Hoss≈ç maintained amicable relations with the Shingon esoteric sect, and adopted its practices while providing further scholarship on Yogacara philosophy. H≈çnen, founder of the J≈çdo-sh≈´ Pure Land sect, likewise sought advice from Hoss≈ç scholars of his time as a novice monk, and later debated with them after establishing his sect. Another Hoss≈ç scholar, J≈çkei was among H≈çnen's toughest critics, and frequently sought to refute his teachings, while simultaneously striving, as H≈çnen did, to make Buddhism accessible to a wider audience by reviving devotion to the bodhisattva Maitreya and teaching followers the benefits of rebirth in the Tu·π£ita rather than the pure land of AmitƒÅbha. J≈çkei is also a leading figure in the efforts to revive monastic discipline at places like T≈çsh≈çdai-ji, K≈çfuku-ji and counted other notable monks among his disciples, including Eison, who founded the Shingon Risshu sect. During the Meiji period, as tourism became more common, the Hoss≈ç sect was the owner of several famous temples, notably H≈çry≈´-ji and Kiyomizu-dera. However, as the Hoss≈ç sect had ceased Buddhist study centuries prior, the head priests were not content with giving part of their tourism income to the sect's organization. Following the end of World War II, the owners of these popular temples broke away from the Hoss≈ç sect, in 1950 and 1965, respectively. The sect still maintains K≈çfuku-ji and Yakushi-ji. History in Korea East Asian YogƒÅcƒÅra () were transmitted to Korea. The most well-known Korean figure of Beopsang was Woncheuk, who studied under the Chinese monk Xuanzang. Woncheuk is well known amongst scholars of Tibetan Buddhism for his commentary on the Sa·πÉdhinirmocana S≈´tra. While in China, Woncheuk took as a disciple a Korean-born monk named Dojeung (), who travelled to Silla in 692 and propounded and propagated Woncheuk's exegetical tradition there where it flourished. In Korea, Beopsang teachings did not endure long as a distinct school, but as with China, its teachings were frequently included in later schools of thought.

According to tradition he was an uneducated layman who suddenly attained awakening upon hearing the Diamond Sutra. Despite his lack of formal training, he demonstrated his understanding to the fifth patriarch, Daman Hongren, who then supposedly chose Huineng as his true successor instead of his publicly known selection of Yuquan Shenxiu. Twentieth century scholarship revealed that the story of Huineng's Buddhist career was likely invented by the monk Heze Shenhui, who claimed to be one of Huineng's disciples and was highly critical of Shenxiu's teaching. Huineng is regarded as the founder of the \\"Sudden Enlightenment\\" Southern Chan school of Buddhism, which focuses on an immediate and direct attainment of Buddhist enlightenment. The Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch (), which is said to be a record of his teachings, is a highly influential text in the East Asian Buddhist tradition. Biography =Sources= The Sixth Patriarch's Rice Mill, ink on paper, 10.8 x 16.7 cm, Shinwa-an Collection The two primary sources for Huineng's life are the preface to the Platform SutraPine 2006 and the Transmission of the Lamp. Most modern scholars doubt the historicity of traditional biographies and works written about Huineng, considering his extended biography to be a legendary narrative based on a historical person of \\"merely regional significance,\\" of whom very little is known. This legendary narrative reflects historical and religious developments which took place in the century after his life and death. =The Platform Sutra= The Platform S≈´tra of the Sixth Patriarch is attributed to a disciple of Huineng named Fahai () and purports to be a record of Huineng's life, lectures and interactions with disciples. However, the text shows signs of having been constructed over a longer period of time, and contains different layers of writing. According to John McRae, it is According to Wong, the Platform S≈´tra cites and explains a wide range of Buddhist scriptures listed here in the order of appearance: *Diamond Sutra *La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra *MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra *MahƒÅpraj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra *BrahmajƒÅla S≈´tra *Vimalakirti Sutra *Lotus Sutra *≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra *Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana =Early life and introduction to Buddhism= According to Huineng's autobiography in the Platform Sutra, Huineng's father was from Fanyang, but he was banished from his government position and passed away at a young age. Huineng and his mother were left in poverty and moved to Nanhai, where Huineng sold firewood to support his family. One day, Huineng delivered firewood to a customer's shop, where he met a man reciting the Diamond Sutra. \\"On hearing the words of the scripture, my mind opened up and I understood.\\" He inquired about the reason that the Diamond Sutra was chanted, and the person stated that he came from the Eastern Meditation Monastery in Huangmei District of the province of Qi, where the Fifth Patriarch of Chan lived and delivered his teachings. Huineng's customer paid his ten silver taels and suggested that he meet the Fifth Patriarch of Chan. =Meeting the Fifth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism= Huineng reached Huangmei thirty days later, and expressed to the Fifth Patriarch his specific request of attaining Buddhahood. Since Huineng came from Guangdong and was physically distinctive from the local Northern Chinese, the Fifth Patriarch Hongren questioned his origin as a \\"barbarian from the south,\\" and doubted his ability to attain enlightenment. Huineng impressed Hongren with a clear understanding of the ubiquitous Buddha nature in everyone, and convinced Hongren to let him stay. The first chapter of the Ming canon version of the Platform Sutra describes the introduction of Huineng to Hongren as follows: Huineng was told to split firewood and pound rice in the backyard of the monastery and avoid going to the main hall. =Poem contest= Eight months later, the Fifth Patriarch summoned all his followers and proposed a poem contest for his followers to demonstrate the stage of their understanding of the essence of mind. He decided to pass down his robe and teachings to the winner of the contest, who would become the Sixth Patriarch. Shenxiu, the leading disciple of the Fifth Patriarch, composed a stanza, but did not have the courage to present it to the master. Instead, he wrote his stanza on the south corridor wall to remain anonymous one day at midnight. The other monks saw the stanza and commended it. Shenxiu's stanza is as follows: The Patriarch was not satisfied with Shenxiu's stanza, and pointed out that the poem did not show understanding of \\"[his] own fundamental nature and essence of mind.\\" He gave Shenxiu a chance to submit another poem to demonstrate that he had entered the \\"gate of enlightenment,\\" so that he could transmit his robe and the Dharma to Shenxiu, but the student's mind was agitated and could not write one more stanza. Two days later, the illiterate Huineng heard Shenxiu's stanza being chanted by a young attendant at the monastery and inquired about the context of the poem. The attendant explained to him the poem contest and the transmission of the robe and Dharma. Huineng asked to be led to the corridor, where he could also pay homage to the stanza. He asked a low-ranking official named Zhang Riyong from Jiangzhou to read the verse to him, and then immediately asked him to write down a stanza that he composed. According to McRae, \\"the earliest version of the Platform Sutra contains two versions of Huineng's verse. Later version contain one version of Huineng's stanza, somewhat different from the two older ones: The followers who were present were astonished by the work of a southern barbarian. Being cautious of Huineng's status, the Patriarch wiped away the stanza and claimed that the author of the stanza had not reached enlightenment. = Interpretation of the verses = According to the traditional interpretation, which is based on Guifeng Zongmi, the fifth-generation successor of Shenhui, the two verses represent respectively the gradual and the sudden approach. According to McRae, this is an incorrect understanding: Huineng's verse does not stand alone, but forms a pair with Shenxiu's verse: McRae notes a similarity in reasoning with the Oxhead School, which used a threefold structure of \\"absolute, relative and middle\\", or \\"thesis-antithesis- synthesis\\". According to McRae, the Platform Sutra itself is the synthesis in this threefold structure, giving a balance between the need of constant practice and the insight into the absolute. = Succession of Hongren = However, on the next day, the Patriarch secretly went to Huineng's room and asked, \\"Should not a seeker after the Dharma risk his life this way?\\" Then he asked, \\"is the rice ready?\\" Huineng responded that the rice was ready and only waiting to be sieved. The Patriarch secretly explained the Diamond Sutra to Huineng, and when Huineng heard the phrase \\"one should activate one‚Äôs mind so it has no attachment,\\" he was \\"suddenly and completely enlightened, and understood that all things exist in self-nature.\\" The Dharma was passed to Huineng at night, when the Patriarch transmitted \\"the doctrine of sudden enlightenment\\" as well as his robe and bowl to Huineng. He told Huineng, ‚ÄúYou are now the Sixth Patriarch. Take care of yourself, save as many sentient beings as you can, and spread the teachings so they will not be lost in the future. = Escape from monastery = He also explained to Huineng that the Dharma was transmitted from mind to mind, whereas the robe was passed down physically from one patriarch to the next. Hongren instructed the Sixth Patriarch to leave the monastery before he could be harmed. \\"You can stop at Huai and then hide yourself at Hui.\\" Hongren showed Huineng the route to leave the monastery, and rowed Huineng across the river to assist his escape. Huineng immediately responded with a clear understanding of Hongren's purpose in doing so, and demonstrated that he could ferry to \\"the other shore\\" with the Dharma that had been transmitted to him. The Sixth Patriarch reached the Tayu Mountains within two months, and realized that hundreds of men were following him, attempting to rob him of the robe and bowl. However, the robe and bowl could not be moved by Huiming, who then asked for the transmission of Dharma from Huineng. Huineng helped him reach enlightenment and continued on his journey. Teachings =Sudden Enlightenment= Doctrinally, the Southern School is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is sudden, while the Northern School is associated with the teaching that enlightenment is gradual. This is a polemical exaggeration, since both schools were derived from the same tradition, and the so-called Southern School incorporated many teachings of the more influential Northern School. Eventually both schools died out, but the influence of Shenhui was so immense that all later Chan schools traced their origin to Huineng, and \\"sudden enlightenment\\" became a standard doctrine of Chan. =\\"No-thought\\" and meditation= According to tradition, Huineng taught \\"no-thought\\", the \\"pure and unattached mind\\" which \\"comes and goes freely and functions fluently without any hindrance\\".John M. Thompson, Huineng (Hui-neng), Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy It does not mean that one does not think at all, but is \\"a highly attentive yet unentangled way of being [...] an open, non-conceptual state of mind that allows one to experience reality directly, as it truly is.\\" The alleged Northern school's emphasis on quiet contemplation was criticized by Huineng: Historical impact Liang Kai, The Sixth Patriarch Tearing a Sutra, Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279 AD), ink on paper, 72.9 x 31.6 cm, Mitsu Memorial Museum, Japan According to modern historiography, Huineng was a marginal and obscure historical figure. Modern scholarship has questioned his hagiography, with some researchers speculating that this story was created around the middle of the 8th century, beginning in 731 by Shenhui, who supposedly was a successor to Huineng, to win influence at the Imperial Court. He claimed Huineng to be the successor to Hongren, instead of the then publicly recognized successor Shenxiu: In 745, Shenhui was invited to take up residence in the Heze temple in Luoyang. In 753, he fell out of grace, and had to leave the capital to go into exile. The most prominent of the successors of his lineage was Guifeng Zongmi. According to Zongmi, Shenhui's approach was officially sanctioned in 796, when \\"an imperial commission determined that the Southern line of Ch'an represented the orthodox transmission and established Shen-hui as the seventh patriarch, placing an inscription to that effect in the Shen-lung temple\\". According to Schl√ºtter and Teiser, the biography of Huineng explained in the Platform Sutra is a compelling legend of an illiterate, \\"barbarian\\" layman who became a Patriarch of Chan Buddhism. Most of what we know about Huineng comes from the Platform Sutra, which consists of the record of a public talk that includes an autobiography of Huineng, which was a hagiography, i.e. a biography of a saint portraying him as a hero.This pseudoautobiography was written to give authority to the teachings of Huineng. The Sutra became a very popular text to be circulated around, attempting to increase the importance of this exclusive lineage of Huineng. As a result, the account might have been altered over the centuries. Shenhui (685-758) was the first person to claim that Huineng was both a saint and a hero. As a result of this contested claim, modifications were made to the Platform Sutra, a manuscript copy of which was later found at Dunhuang. It turns out that little was known about Huineng before Shenhui's account of him. \\"It took all the rhetorical skills of Shen- hui and his sympathizers to give a form to the name Huineng,\\"; thus, the character Huineng described by Shenhui was not completely factual. In the Platform Sutra, following Huineng's sermon was a narrative by Fahai, who addressed a few interviews between Huineng and his disciples, including Shenhui. It is likely that \\"much of the Platform Sutra was built on the inventions of Shenhui,\\" and the textual evidence suggests that \\"the work was written soon after his death.\\" After Huineng's death, Shenhui wanted to claim his authority over Chan Buddhism, but his position was challenged by Shenxiu and Puji, who supported the Northern lineage that taught gradual enlightenment. It is reasonable to assume that this autobiography was likely an attempt by Shenhui to relate himself to the most renowned figures in Zen Buddhism, which essentially enabled him to connect to the Buddha through this lineage. An epitaph of Huineng, inscribed by the established poet Wang Wei also reveals inconsistencies with Shenhui's account of Huineng. The epitaph \\"does not attack Northern Chan, and adds new information on a monk, Yinzong (627-713), who is said to have tonsured Huineng.\\" Wang Wei was a poet and a government official, whereas Shenhui was a propagandist who preached to the crowd, which again leads to questions about his credibility. \\"As far as can be determined from surviving evidence, Shenhui possessed little or no reliable information on Huineng except that he was a disciple of Hongren, lived in Shaozhou, and was regarded by some Chan followers as a teacher of only regional importance.\\" It seems that Shenhui invented the figure of Huineng for himself to become the \\"true heir of the single line of transmission from the Buddha in the Southern lineage,\\" and this appears to be the only way he could have done so. On a related note, the Chan Buddhist practices, including the wordless transmission and sudden enlightenment were much different from the traditional training of a monk. According to Kieschnick, \\"The Chan accounts ridicule every element of the scholar-monk ideal that had taken shape over the centuries in traditional hagiography,\\" with examples found in the immense literature of the \\"classical period.\\" Mummification Nanhua Temple today, where Huineng is said to have lived and taught. A mummified body, supposedly that of Huineng, is kept in Nanhua Temple in Shaoguan (northern Guangdong).Images of Huineng's temple and Mummy This mummy was seen by the Jesuit Matteo Ricci who visited Nanhua Temple in 1589. Ricci told the European readers the story of Huineng (in a somewhat edited form), describing him as akin to a Christian ascetic. Ricci names him Li√πz«î (i.e. ÂÖ≠Á•ñ, \\"The Sixth Ancestor\\").De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas, Book Three, Chapter 1. Pages 222-224 in the English translation: Louis J. Gallagher (1953). \\"China in the Sixteenth Century: The Journals of Matthew Ricci\\", Random House, New York, 1953.Latin original text: De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu Liang Kai's Portrayal of Huineng Liang Kai, The Sixth Patriarch Cutting the Bamboo, Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279 AD), ink on paper, 72.7 x 31.5 cm, Tokyo National Museum, JapanThe two paintings to the right were both completed by Liang Kai, a painter from Southern Song dynasty, who left his position as the court painter in Jia Tai's count to practice Chan. These paintings depict Huineng, the Sixth Patriarch of Chan Buddhism. The protagonist occupies the lower central portion of both paintings, with his face turned to the side, so that his facial features are not portrayed. \\"The Sixth Patriarch Cutting the Bamboo\\" depicts the process that Huineng went through to attain enlightenment, and exemplifies Huineng's concentration and contemplation in doing so through the process od chopping bamboo. This particular enlightenment moment of his is only documented in this painting, and not in any literary sources. He holds an ax in his right hand, and extends his left arm to steady a stalk of bamboo while scrutinizing it. The brushstrokes are loose and free but construct a simplistic and lively image: they indicate a subtle motion of pulling the bamboo towards him. Huineng wears a shirt with sleeves rolled up, which is suggested by the crease at the edges of the shoulders. He puts his extra cloth into a hair bun. The light and dark ink indicate gradation and contrast, and the light shadow on his right arm and body of bamboo implies the source of light. Similarly, The Sixth Patriarch Tearing a Sutra adopts a similar style in portraying the same figure, Huineng, performing a different mundane action. This reaffirms the focus of the Southern Chan Tradition, which is to attain sudden enlightenment without having to train to be a monk in the conventional way or to study Buddhist scriptures.

The third tropical cyclone, first named storm, and first hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto developed near the western coast of Africa from a tropical wave on August 3\\\\. Initially a tropical depression, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4\\\\. While briefly turning westward on August 6, Alberto attained hurricane status. The cyclone continued to track west-northwestward, and by early the following day, reached an initial peak with winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Shortly thereafter, Alberto re-curved northwestward and began encountering increased wind shear. As a result, Alberto weakened back to a tropical storm on August 9\\\\. However, the system quickly re-strengthened as winds became more favorable, and early on August 10, Alberto became a hurricane again. The storm gradually curved northward and north-northeastward between August 11 and August 12; Alberto attained its peak intensity with winds of 125 mph (205 km/h) during that time. Increasing upper-level westerlies caused Alberto to weaken as it moved east-northeastward, with the cyclone losing most of its convection. Early on August 14, Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm. A westerly trough that had been guiding Alberto outran the storm, and strong ridging developed to the north and west. As a result, Alberto turned southward on August 15, southwestward on August 16, and then to the west on August 17\\\\. While curving northwestward and then northward, Alberto began to re-strengthen, and was upgraded to a hurricane for a third time on August 18\\\\. Alberto reached a third peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with winds of 105 mph (205 km/h) on August 20\\\\. After weakening back to a Category 1 hurricane, Alberto conducted an unusually large cyclonic loop, spanning approximately 5 degrees latitude and 8 degrees longitude. The cyclone was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 23, shortly before completing its extratropical transition. Although it did not affect land while tropical, the precursor tropical wave caused light rainfall in Senegal. The remnant extratropical cyclone also likely produced tropical storm-force winds in Iceland and Jan Mayen. Meteorological history A mesoscale convective complex, or large circular area of thunderstorms, developed in the Ethiopian Highlands of Africa on July 28\\\\. The complex moved west-southwestward through the continent, waxing and waning until persisting along a tropical wave on August 2\\\\. The next day, the wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from Guinea. Once over the open Atlantic Ocean, the wave quickly developed and became Tropical Depression Three later that day. The depression moved to the west-northwest and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Alberto early on August 4. Alberto continued to strengthen, but moved to cooler waters late on August 5 and weakened briefly. However, the storm strengthened again early on August 6, and it was upgraded to hurricane status as an eye became visible. The upgrade was accompanied with a brief westward turn. However, Alberto continued to move to the west-northwest later that day, reaching its first peak intensity of 90 mph (150 km/h) on August 7. A vigorous upper-level low developed west of Alberto on August 7 and August 8. This caused an increase in vertical shear, weakening the hurricane down to a tropical storm on August 9. The low also caused the storm to turn to the northwest. However, on August 10, Alberto became better organised and was upgraded to hurricane status again. It then moved in a gradual curve towards the north and northeast through a break in a subtropical ridge between August 11 and August 12. Alberto made its closest approach to Bermuda on August 11, passing about 345 mi (555 km) east of the island. The strong storm became a Category 3 major hurricane on August 12 and reached its second and highest peak intensity of 125 mph (205 km/h), and a 60 mi (95 km) wide eye was observed. Alberto was an unusual storm in that it reached its peak intensity at a high latitude, north of 35ÀöN, after it had re-curved. The hurricane began to weaken due to increasing upper-level westerlies on August 13 and August 14, while moving east-northeastward. Alberto was downgraded to a tropical storm on August 14. Hurricane Alberto near its secondary peak intensity on August 19. As early as August 10, computer models anticipated the hurricane to accelerate to the northeast and become extratropical within three days, but this did not occur. A westerly trough that had been influencing Alberto's motion outran the storm, and a strong ridge developed to the north and west, causing the storm to turn abruptly to the south on August 15, and to complete a large loop over the open Atlantic. Alberto turned to the southwest on August 16 and to the west on August 17. The storm then took a sharp turn toward the northwest as a large, slow-moving mid-level trough was carving out over the eastern United States. Alberto began to strengthen, and reached hurricane status for the third time on August 18. The hurricane continued to turn to the north on August 19 and to the northeast on August 20 and August 21. During this time, Alberto reached a third peak intensity of 105 mph (165 km/h) on August 20, and a 70 mi (110 km) wide eye was observed. Operationally, Alberto reached a peak intensity of 110 mph (175 km/h), but after reanalysis, it was reduced to 105 mph (165 km/h). Hurricane Alberto began to weaken on August 22 as it accelerated into higher latitudes. It was downgraded to a tropical storm early on August 23. Initially, it was forecast to become extratropical on August 22, but a little burst of colder cloud tops enabled Alberto to remain tropical for a longer time, persisting into August 23, while it moved into a very high latitude at 53ÀöN. The weakening storm finally became extratropical late on August 23, while accelerating to the north-northeast, passing near Iceland on August 24. Winds dropped below gale-force, as the centre turned to the east- northeast on August 25. Alberto dissipated about 85 mi (140 km) east of Jan Mayen later that day. Impact, records, and naming Very minimal impact occurred as a result from Hurricane Alberto. Dakar, Senegal, received 25 mm (1 in) of rain as the pre-Alberto tropical wave passed over the city. A discussion was issued on August 9 advising residents in Bermuda to monitor the progress of the storm until it safely passed. Also, from August 12 to August 14, public advisories were issued advising people from Azores to monitor the progress of Hurricane Alberto. This stopped when Alberto began to slow its motion and began to turn to the south, away from the Azores. Some swells were reported along the east coast of the United States a few days after the storm's recurvature. No reports were available on the impact of Alberto on Iceland, but it was estimated that winds of at least tropical storm force were experienced there. Otherwise, there were no known reports of damage or casualties as a result of Hurricane Alberto. Hurricane Alberto completed the largest loop ever observed over the Atlantic Ocean, spanning approximately 5 degrees latitude by 8 degrees longitude. The storm is currently the ninth longest-lived storm in the Atlantic Ocean (lasting 19.75 days), and is also the second longest-lived Atlantic storm during August (the longest lived is the 1899 Hurricane San Ciriaco). Also, Alberto is the third farthest- travelling in the Atlantic (travelling 6,500 miles), only behind Hurricane Faith and Hurricane Carrie, being able to retain tropical characteristics at an unusually high latitude, up to 53ÀöN. The last storm to do so was Hurricane Frances in 1980.

The terminology can also be used to describe forms of competition of two-wheeled motorised vehicles under the banner of motorcycle racing, and includes off- road racing such as motocross. Four- (or more) wheeled motorsport competition is globally governed by the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA); and the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM) governs two-wheeled competition. Likewise, the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM) governs powerboat racing while the F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) governs air sports; including aeroplane racing. History Postcard picture of the Brighton Motor Trials ‚Äì July 1905 In 1894, a French newspaper organised a race from Paris to Rouen and back, starting city to city racing. In 1900, the Gordon Bennett Cup was established. Closed circuit racing arose as open road racing, on public roads, was banned. Aspendale Racecourse in Australia in 1906 was the first dedicated motor racing track in the world. Following World War I, European countries organised Grand Prix races over closed courses. In the United States, dirt track racing became popular. After World War II, the Grand Prix circuit became more formally organised. In the United States, stock car racing and drag racing became firmly established. Motorsports ultimately became divided by types of motor vehicles into racing events, and their appropriate organisations.  Racing Motor racing is the subset of motorsport activities which involve competitors racing against each other. =Open wheel racing= Formula racing The Red Bull RB8, the 2012 Formula One World Championship winning car Formula racing is a set of classes of motor vehicles, with their wheels outside, and not contained by, any bodywork of their vehicle. These have been globally classified as specific 'Formula' series - the most common being Formula One, and Formula Two. Many others include the likes of Formula 3, Formula Ford, Formula Renault and Formula Palmer Audi. However, in North America, the IndyCar series is the most followed open-wheeled racing series. More recently, new open-wheeled series have been created, originating in Europe, which omit the 'Formula' moniker, such as FIA Formula 2 and FIA Formula 3. Former 'Formula' series include Formula 5000, GP2 and GP3. =Formula One= Formula One is a class of single-seat and open-wheel Grand Prix closed course racing, governed by the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), and currently organized by the privately owned company Formula One Group. The formula regulations contain a very strict set of rules which govern vehicle power, weight, size, and design. The rules do allow for some variation, however. =Formula E= A second generation Formula E car in 2019.Formula E is a class of open-wheel auto racing that uses only electric-powered cars. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is also sanctioned by the FIA and races a spec chassis/battery combination with manufacturers allowed to develop their own electric power- trains. The series has gained significant traction in recent years. =IndyCar Series= A series originated on June 12, 1909 in Portland, Oregon at its first race. Shortly after, Indianapolis Motor Speedway opened in 1909 and held races that ranged from 50 to 200 miles. Its premier race is the Indianapolis 500 which began on May 11, 1911 and a tradition was born. Today, Indycar operates a full schedule with over 20 teams and 40 different drivers. The current schedule includes 15 tracks over the course of 17 races per season. Josef Newgarden was crowned current champion of the Indycar Series in September 2019. =Enclosed wheel racing= A Ford Focus WRC rally racing car during 2010 Rally Finland Enclosed wheel racing is a set of classes of vehicles, where the wheels are primarily enclosed inside the bodywork of the vehicle, similar to a North American 'stock car'. Sports car racing Sports car racing is a set of classes of vehicles, over a closed course track, including GT sports cars, and specialised racing prototypes. The premiere race is the 24 Hours of Le Mans which takes place annually in France during the month of June. Sports car racing rules and specifications differentiate in North America from established international sanctioning bodies. Stock car racing Stock car racing is a set of vehicles that race over a speedway track, organized by NASCAR. While once stock cars, the vehicles are now purpose built, but resemble the body design and shape of production cars. Bootleggers throughout the Carolinas are often credited for the origins of NASCAR due to the resistance during the prohibition. Many of the vehicles were modified to increase top speed and handling, to provide the bootleggers with an advantage toward the vehicles local law enforcement would use in the area. An important part to the modifications of stock cars, was to increase the performance of the vehicle while also maintaining the same exterior look giving it the name Stock car racing. Many legends in NASCAR originated as bootleggers in the Great Smoky Mountains of North Carolina like Junior Johnson. Organized oval racing began on Daytona Beach in Florida as a hobby but quickly gained interest from all over the country. As oval racing became larger and larger, a group gathered in hopes to form a sanctioning body for the sport. NASCAR was organized in 1947, to combine flat track oval racing of production cars. Daytona Beach and Road Course was founded where land speed records were set on the beach, and including part of A1A. The highlight of the stock car calendar is the season-opening Daytona 500, also nicknamed 'The Great American Race' which is held at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. NASCAR has now held over 2,500 sanctioned events over the course of 70 seasons. Richard Petty is known as the king of NASCAR with over 200 recorded wins in the series and has competed in 1,184 races in his career. Touring car racing Touring car racing is a set of vehicles, modified street cars, that race over closed purpose built race tracks and street courses. Off-road racing Off-road racing is a group of vehicles that specialize in off-road racing and are modified street cars that can race on close purpose built off-road tracks and courses. Off-road racing is popular all over the world. Premier off-road events include the Dakar Rally and the Baja 1000 desert race. Series like the National Off-Road Racing Association (NORRA) which was founded in 1967, sanctions events utilizing off-road vehicles racing through the Baja Desert. The first event sanctioned by the organization was the 1967 Mexican 1000 rally that began in Tijuana and ended in La Paz. =Other racing= speedway riders in the Speedway Extraliiga competition Motor sports which involve competitors racing against each other include: *Air racing *Auto racing (car racing) *Motor rallying *Rallycross *Motorcycle racing *Kart racing *Banger racing *Motorboat racing *Drone racing *Hovercraft racing *Lawn mower racing *Radio-controlled model racing *Slot car racing *Snowmobile racing *Truck racing Non-racing disciplines Forms of motorsport which do not involve racing include drifting, demolition derby, regularity rally, motorcycle trials, gymkhana, Freestyle Motocross and tractor pulling. Race organisation Racing events are governed by Race Officials. In preparation for the race, a Race Committee is formed, senior officials such as Race Director, Clerk of the Course, Chief Steward are established. Race Officials are typically members of the country's motorsport governing organization and represent its rules and regulations. Throughout the racing event, Race Officials are responsible for logistics, supporting services, safety, participant scrutineering, race judging, arbitration, and any other decision making. After the race, the Race Officials are responsible in resolving any issues that may have arisen during the race. Parties can appeal its decisions to the country's motorsport governing organization.

Most of his life was spent homeless or institutionalized, and he later became regarded as \\"the godfather of outsider music\\". Born in Los Angeles, Fischer was repeatedly sent to mental institutions as a teenager, where he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. In 1968, he recorded a double album, An Evening with Wild Man Fischer, that was produced by Frank Zappa for the Bizarre label. At one point, Fischer was the opening act for the Byrds, Iron Butterfly, Solomon Burke, and Bo Diddley. His relationship with Zappa came to an abrupt end after Fischer threw a bottle that nearly hit Zappa's daughter Moon. In 1975, Fischer helped jumpstart Rhino Records with the novelty single \\"Go to Rhino Records\\". The label put out a trilogy of albums that ultimately became his last: Wildmania (1977), Pronounced Normal (1981), and Nothing Scary (1983); the latter two were produced by the comedy music duo Barnes & Barnes. A documentary about Fischer's life, Derailroaded: Inside the Mind of Wild Man Fischer, premiered at the South by Southwest festival in 2005. In 2004, he consented to move into an assisted-living hospital. He died of heart failure several years later at the age of 66. Biography =Early life= Larry Fischer was born on November 6, 1944 in Los Angeles, California. From an early age, he experienced major mood swings typical of bipolar disorder, and developed a habit of singing Paul Anka songs at the top of his voice, which he called having \\"the pep\\". When his mood worsened, he experienced auditory hallucinations and acted violently toward his family. He attended Fairfax High School but was expelled in 1962 for singing in class. In 1963, he was committed to Camarillo State Hospital for threatening his mother with a knife, and he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and manic depression. Released one year later, he appeared at numerous talent shows and was discovered by R&B; singer Solomon Burke, who gave him the nickname \\"Wild Man\\" and brought him along on a tour. Fischer was still living at home at this time, and in 1965, was once again institutionalized for his behavior. According to Fischer, the hospital stays only exacerbated his condition.

For a nickel or a dime, he would offer a \\"new kind of song\\" to passersby as an a cappella performance. This led him to become an opening act for the Byrds, Bo Diddley, and Iron Butterfly. While performing onstage and outside at the Sunset Strip, he was noticed by Frank Zappa, bandleader for the Mothers of Invention. Zappa later said: \\"I thought from the first day I met him that someone should make an album about Wild Man Fischer.\\" He invited Fischer into a studio and recorded him singing about topics such as his mother, mental hospitals, fame, circles, and how he could move faster than a cat could see him. The Mothers of Invention, record producer Kim Fowley, and Zappa's girl group the GTOs made guest appearances on some of the tracks. Released as a double album in 1968, An Evening with Wild Man Fischer was given a positive review in Rolling Stone magazine, where it was described as \\"captur[ing] the total being of one strange member of the human community\\". On September 23, 1968, thanks to his connections with Zappa, Fischer appeared on Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, singing \\"Leaves Are Falling\\" and \\"Merry-Go-Round\\". During this period he also made contributions to the 1968 psychsploitation album \\"Bedlam\\" by The Crazy People. In December, Zappa arranged for him to perform at a Christmas show involving the Mothers, the GTOs, and Alice Cooper. Fischer sang \\"Circles\\". Fischer was frustrated that the album failed to bring him the fame he expected. One day, he visited Zappa and threw a bottle that nearly hit Zappa's infant daughter Moon. This ended their relationship. In a song Fischer later wrote (\\"Frank Zappa\\"), he alleged that Zappa subsequently withheld his recording income (\\"Frank's got my publishing rights / You could say he's on my mind / I think about him all the time\\"). After Frank's death in 1993, Gail Zappa inherited her husband's musical copyrights, and refused to reissue the album for as long as she lived feeling that the recording was \\"a poor example of Frank's work.\\" =Rhino Records albums= In 1974, Larry appeared as a guest vocalist on noise band Smegma's album Sing Popular Songs. In 1975, he recorded Rhino Records' first release, a novelty single entitled \\"Go to Rhino Records\\". At the time, Rhino Records was only a record shop in Los Angeles. According to the New York Times: \\"Demand for [the single] proved so great that it catapulted the store's owners into the record-producing business.\\" Two years later he recorded their very first LP, Wildmania. In the 1980s, Fischer worked with the comedy music duo Barnes and Barnes (Bill Mumy and Robert Haimer) to produce two more albums for Rhino, Pronounced Normal (1981) and Nothing Scary (1984). In 1986, Barnes and Barnes also wrote and produced \\"It's a Hard Business\\", a duet featuring Fischer and Rosemary Clooney. The song was the result of a telephone friendship they began due to mutual acquaintances. In 1988, a judge awarded Fischer royalties on his song \\"Merry-Go-Round\\" (from the videocassette release of the movie Medium Cool), but the attorney representing Fischer did not know how to contact him. Fischer was still homeless, living in motels and on the streets while panhandling at places like Dodger Stadium and Disneyland. He performed at the 1988 San Diego Comic Con with Bill Mumy's group as his backing band. In 1998, Date with the Devils Daughter, an album by Robert Williams (a drummer formerly with Captain Beefheart) includes \\"Hello Robert\\", which consists of messages that Fischer left on Williams's phone. In 1999, Rhino released The Fischer King, a two-CD package comprising 100 tracks and a 20-page booklet, which sold out within weeks. The limited-edition album comprises his entire Rhino catalog, including all three of the Rhino albums plus singles, unreleased material, interviews done for this release, and his duet with Clooney. It releases almost everything Fischer ever recorded, except An Evening with Wild Man Fischer, for which the Zappa family still held the rights. =Final years and death= In the early 2000s, Fischer was filmed as the subject of a full-length documentary, Derailroaded: Inside the Mind of Wild Man Fischer, which premiered at South by Southwest in March 2005. Co- director Josh Rubin called the four years making the film \\"the most arduous, trying time of my life\\" due to Fischer's erratic behavior. It included an appearance from Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh who called him: \\"as pure a rock and roll icon as you can find. He's mainlined into the creative subconscious.\\" In 2004, Fischer was the subject of a comic book (The Legend of Wild Man Fischer by Dennis Eichhorn), and in October, appeared on ABC-TV's late-night talk/comedy show, Jimmy Kimmel Live!. In 2003, Fischer suffered a six-month- long paranoid episode, convinced somebody was trying to kill him, and he started living on the streets again. He called Bill Mumy up to 20 times a day, hanging up each time, until Mumy finally had to change his phone number. Fischer eventually moved in with his aunt Josephine, but three weeks later she was diagnosed with terminal cancer (this happened during the filming of Derailroaded). Fischer and his family consented to move him into an assisted- living mental institution in Van Nuys. The medications he was prescribed helped him control his behavior, but it also eliminated his creative drive, or \\"pep\\". Fischer made his final performance on August 16, 2006, at the Trunk Space in Phoenix, Arizona. The last seven years of Fischer's life were spent peacefully but uneventfully. On June 16, 2011, he died of heart failure at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, at the age of 66.

It is present in Albania, Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France (Corsica, and mainland), Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Ireland, Italy, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Netherlands, North Macedonia, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Tajikistan, Turkey (Turkey-in-Europe), Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and in part of United Kingdom.IUCN The black-tailed skimmer is abundant throughout its range and is one of the most commonly seen dragonflies in Europe. It holds a stable population and has no known major threats. This species has expanded its range, assisted by the creation of gravel pits which give it the extensive open unvegetated areas it prefers. It was first recorded in Great Britain in Essex in 1934. It is decreasing rapidly in the Maltese Islands. Habitat This dragonfly is found at any open water with bare patches along the shore where the patrolling males frequently rest in the sun. It also inhabits near slow-flowing waters. It favors lakes, slow rivers, ponds and sometimes marshy area, without dense riparian vegetation. Females are less bold and not encountered as regularly. Adults prefer to perch on bare ground and rocks. Description It is a fairly large dragonfly (the length of 47‚Äì53 mm, 29‚Äì35 mm abdomen, rear wing 35‚Äì41 mm.) with relatively broad, flattened abdomen, but not as broad as to chaser species. With age, adult males develop extensive blue pruinescence on their abdomen, offset by yellow lateral patches. The middle lobe of the pronotum is large and notched in the middle. The chest is yellow or yellowish-brown. The base of the hind wings do not show a dark opaque spots. The pterostigma is dark brown or black. On the front wings pterostigma 2‚Äì3 mm long. Anal appendages are black. The females and immature males are a deep yellow color, with wavy black lines dorsally on their abdomen. Males and females have the costal vein (the leading edge of the wing) yellow or black. The species is similar to its much more localized congener the Orthetrum albistylum, but readily identifiable in the field. The males develop a blue pruinescence on the abdomen darkening to the rear with S8-10 becoming black. Its eyes are very dark green. They fly swift and low, skimming the water surface. Females retain their color and markings though they become quite grayish brown with age. This species could be confused with Keeled skimmer or Scarce chaser. Adults ‚ôÇ: Adult males have a bluish or blue-gray patina on the body, gradually darkening with age. They have a blue abdomen with a black tip and transparent wings. The young have a grid pattern on a yellow-brownish abdomen. ‚ôÄ: Adult females have a yellow-brownish abdomen with a lattice pattern (wide longitudinal dark brown stripes and bright crescent- shaped spots) and transparent wings. 10 tergite of abdomen is black. Even the abdomen of the immature males looks that way.

Average wingspan is about 77 mm, while hindwings are 35‚Äì40 mm long. The eyes are dorsally narrowly apposed to dorsally broadly contiguous. They are brown (in the female), or blue (in the male). Legs are black and brown (the femoral bases brown). Thoracic antehumeral stripes are absent. The wings spread more or less horizontally in repose. They are dissimilar in shape and venation, sessile, unpatterned and clear. The inner wing venation is blackish. Discoidal cell is divided longitudinally into a conspicuous triangle and supra-triangle. There are antenodal veins in the forewings 10‚Äì13 (fewer in the hindwings). Pterostigma is well over twice but no more than five times as long as wide. Abdomen is lanceolate and 30‚Äì35 mm long; predominantly blue (in the male), or brown (in the female), or grey (sometimes, in old females). It is rather plain (in the male, but often with orange lateral markings, and darkened over the terminal segments), or predominantly longitudinally lined (the female with a dark medio-lateral band on either side along each segment); without mid-dorsal spots. The male abdomen is without auricles on segment 2; with a single inferior anal appendage. Nymphs The nymphs are stout, body is expanded in the middle. When mature, they are 23‚Äì25.5 mm long. The postocular lobes is curving sharply to the back of the head from some distance behind the eyes. The antennae is 7 segmented. The mask have the prementum hollowed dorsally. The prementum bears three (rarely two or four) long setae inserted near each lateral margin, and two medial fields of seven to eight short spiniform setae, the latter flanked by four setae of medium length. The body of the labial palps bears 6 or 7 major setae. Distal margins of the labial palps are weakly crenate. Legs are longer than the abdomen. The abdomen terminates in five short spine-like appendages. The cerci are no more than half the length of the paraprocts. The abdomen has mid-dorsal spines. The mid-dorsal abdominal spines are prominent on segments 3 to 6. The abdomen is without a mid-dorsal spine on segment 8; gizzard with 4‚Äì8 folds. Mating wheel Biology and behavior The main flight period is June and July.Brocross Males characteristically perch horizontally on exposed surfaces. They fly swift and low, skimming the water surface, while defending their territories. Mating can occur in flight or on land. Females oviposit alone but with male in attendance. Eggs are laid in flight by dipping abdomen onto water surface. They hatch after five or six weeks and the larvae live partially hidden by bottom debris. They emerge after two or three years. Larvae prefer bottom areas rich in vegetation and decaying plant material. References Sources Klaas-Douwe B Dijkstra, Richard Lewington, 2006: Field Guide to the Dragonflies of Britain and Europe.

The notice is an important part of US administrative law, which facilitates government by typically creating a process of taking of public comment. The term is also used at the state level in the United States.http://www.csac.ca.gov/pubs/forms/grnt_frm/noticeofproposedrulemaking_080310.pdf Procedure Although it is not required by the US Constitution, NPRM is required and defined by the Administrative Procedure Act, section 553. The US Congress created the requirement to enlighten agencies and to force them to listen to comments and concerns of people who will likely be affected by the regulation. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Federal Communications Commission (FCC), National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are examples of agencies subject to the NPRM. The NPRM is published in the Federal Register and typically gives 60 days for public comment from any interested party and an additional 30 days for reply comments. Original comments may still be filed in the reply comments window. While that is the normal method of agency rulemaking, emergency rulemaking may bypass the NPRM process. A notice is not required to be published in the Federal Register if all persons subject to it are named and personally served with a copy of it. Each notice, whether published in the Federal Register or personally served, includes: #A statement of the time, place, and nature of the proposed rulemaking proceeding; #A reference to the authority under which it is issued; #A description of the subjects and issues involved or the substance and terms of the proposed regulation; #A statement of the time within which written comments must be submitted; and #A statement of how and to what extent interested persons may participate in the proceeding. NPRMs are often preceded by a notice of inquiry (NOI) in which comments are invited but no rules have yet been proposed. Comments received in that period allow the agency to prepare the NPRM better by making more-informed decisions on proposals. An NPRM may be followed by a further notice of proposed rulemaking (FNPRM), if the comments from the initial NPRM lead the agency to change the proposal drastically to the point that further comment is required. Rules are finalized when a report and order (R&O;) is issued, which may be amended with a second R&O; (or more) in a continuing proceeding (such as the DTV transition). Regulations.govRegulations.gov is a website established in 2002 to provide better access to rulemaking and allows comments to be posted to nearly 300 federal agencies. Foreign equivalents Equivalent procedures of public consultation are also used outside the United States for a document giving public notice of a proposed rule change and inviting informed comment on it. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) publishes similar notices referred to a notice of proposed amendment when it seeks public comment.

The Allman Brothers Band was formed in Jacksonville, Florida in 1969, and achieved its greatest success in the early 1970s. Allman is best remembered for his brief but influential tenure in the band and in particular for his expressive slide guitar playing and inventive improvisational skills. A sought-after session musician both before and during his tenure with the band, Duane Allman performed with such established stars as King Curtis, Aretha Franklin, Herbie Mann, Wilson Pickett, and Boz Scaggs. He also contributed greatly to the 1970 album Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, by Derek and the Dominos. He died following a motorcycle crash in 1971, at the age of 24. In 2003, he was ranked number 2 in Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. In 2011, he was ranked number 9. His guitar tone (achieved with a Gibson Les Paul and two 50-watt bass Marshall amplifiers) was named one of the greatest of all time by Guitar Player. Duane Allman's skills as a guitarist were complemented by personal qualities such as his intensity, drive and ability to draw the best out of others in making music.His brother, Gregg Allman, said that \\"it would be real accurate to say that Duane was the father of the band, He had a lot to do with the spontaneity of the whole thing. He was like the mother ship. Somehow he had this real magic about him that would lock us all in, and we'd all take off. He really had that quality about him. Those were very happy days.\\" Jas Obrecht, \\"Duane Allman remembered\\", Guitar Player, October 1981, Vol. 15, no 10. He is still referred to by his nickname \\"Skydog\\".This may be a reference to his signature guitar sound and tone. Many consider \\"Skydog\\" a variant of the nickname \\"Skyman\\" given to him by Wilson Pickett during the recording of Pickett's cover of the Beatles' \\"Hey Jude.\\" Jim Dickinson was quoted in Keith Richards' autobiography Life as saying he was given the name because he was high much of the time. Early years Duane Allman was born on November 20, 1946, in Nashville, Tennessee. He was the elder son of Willis Allman (1918‚Äì1949) who, at the time of his death, was a Second Lieutenant on active duty in the United States Army, having served as an Army non-commissioned officer during World War II;Allman, Galadrielle (2014), Please Be with Me: A Song for My Father, Duane Allman, New York and Geraldine Allman (n√©e Robbins) (1917‚Äì2015). His brother, Gregg, was born on December 8, 1947. On December 26, 1949, when the family was living near Norfolk, Virginia where he was stationed, Willis Allman was murdered.Freeman, Scott, Midnight Riders: The Story of the Allman Brothers Band, Little, Brown & Company, 1995, p. 5. To retrain as an accountant, Geraldine \\"Mama A\\" Allman sent Duane and Gregg to Castle Heights Military Academy in Lebanon, Tennessee, which they both disliked intensely.Freeman, 1995, pp. 5‚Äì6. In 1957, the family moved to Daytona Beach, Florida, where the boys attended Seabreeze High School. The boys returned to Nashville to spend summers with their grandmother, and there Gregg learned guitar basics from a neighbor. In 1960, he had saved enough money to buy his first guitar, a Japanese-made Teisco Silvertone, while Duane acquired a Harley 165 motorbike. Despite Duane being left-handed, he played the guitar right-handed. Duane began to take an interest in the guitar, and the boys would sometimes fight over it, until Duane wrecked the motorbike and traded it for a Silvertone of his own. His mother eventually bought Duane a Gibson Les Paul Junior.Freeman, 1995, p. 8. It was also in Nashville that the boys became musically inspired by a rhythm and blues concert where they saw blues guitar legend B. B. King perform. Duane told Gregg, \\"We got to get into this.\\" Duane learned to play very quickly and soon became the better guitarist of the two. Career =1961‚Äì1968: Allman Joys and Hour Glass= The brothers started playing publicly in 1961, joining or forming a number of local groups. Around this time, Duane left school to focus on his guitar playing. His early band \\"The Escorts\\" opened for the Beach Boys in 1965 but disbanded, some of its members eventually forming the Allman Joys. After Gregg graduated from Seabreeze High School in 1965, the Allman Joys went on the road, performing throughout the Southeast, and eventually were based in Nashville. The Allman Joys became Hour Glass and moved to Los Angeles in early 1967. There Hour Glass recorded two albums for Liberty Records, but the band was unsatisfied. Liberty tried to market them as a pop band, ignoring the band's desire to play more blues- oriented material. Hour Glass broke up in early 1968. Duane and Gregg went back to Florida, where they played on demo sessions with the 31st of February, a folk rock outfit whose drummer was Butch Trucks. Gregg returned to California to fulfill Hour Glass obligations, while Duane jammed around Florida for months but didn't get another band going. Duane began to learn to play slide guitar on his birthday in 1968. He was recovering from an injury to his left elbow, suffered in a fall from a horse. Gregg brought him a birthday present, the debut album by Taj Mahal, and a bottle of Coricidin pills. He left them on the front porch and rang the bell, as Duane was angry with him about the injury. \\"About two hours after I left, my phone rang,\\" Gregg recalled. \\"'Baby brother, baby brother, get over here now!'\\" Duane had poured the pills out of the Coricidin bottle, washed off the label and was using it as a slide to play along with the album track \\"Statesboro Blues\\" (on the recording, the slide guitar is played by Jesse Ed Davis). \\"Duane had never played slide before,\\" Gregg later said, but \\"he just picked it up and started burnin'. He was a natural.\\" The song became a part of the Allman Brothers Band's repertoire, and Duane's slide guitar became crucial to their sound. Because of his use of the early-1970s-era Coricidin medicine bottle, which is no longer manufactured, replica Coricidin bottles are now popular with slide guitar players who like its glassy feel and sound. =1966‚Äì1969: Session musician= Allman's first major recording session occurred in Nashville's RCA Studio \\"B\\". Producer Tony Moon was recording The Vogues first album after his successful \\"5\\"O'Clock World\\" went Top 5, and had been recorded in that same studio. He hired Allman to play on several sides, as he wanted a more rock sound. This was in early 1966, 2 years before Duane's Alabama success as a sideman. The Allman Joys were the house band at The Briar Patch in Nashville at the time. Allman's playing on the two Hour Glass albums and an Hour Glass session in early 1968 at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, caught the ear of Rick Hall, owner of FAME. In November 1968 Hall bought Allman's contract for $10,000. Allman, tired of the studio limitation, was able to play on his first album as a sessions ace with Wilson Pickett. Allman's work on that album, Hey Jude (1968), got him hired as a full-time session musician at Muscle Shoals and brought him to the attention of other musicians, notably Eric Clapton, who later said, \\"I remember hearing Wilson Pickett's 'Hey Jude' and just being astounded by the lead break at the end. I had to know who that was immediately ‚Äì right now.\\" Allman's performance on \\"Hey Jude\\" impressed Atlantic Records producer and executive Jerry Wexler when Hall played it over the phone for him. Wexler immediately bought Allman's recording contract from Hall and wanted to use him on sessions with Atlantic R&B; artists. While at Muscle Shoals, Allman played on recordings by numerous artists, including Clarence Carter, King Curtis, Aretha Franklin, Laura Nyro, Wilson Pickett, Otis Rush, Percy Sledge, Johnny Jenkins, Boz Scaggs, Delaney & Bonnie, Doris Duke and jazz flautist Herbie Mann. For his first sessions with Franklin, Allman traveled to New York where, in January 1969, he went as an audience member to the Fillmore East to see Johnny Winter and told Muscle Shoals guitarist Jimmy Johnson that in a year he'd be on that stage. That December, the Allman Brothers Band indeed played the Fillmore.From an interview with Muscle Shoals staff guitarist Jimmy Johnson: \\"I remember a specific incident when we were in New York, doing Aretha. It was Duane's first time there to do sessions ‚Äì this was around late '68, maybe the first of the year. He says, 'Hey, let's run over to the Fillmore East to hear this new guy.' Johnny Winter was playing his premiere performance in New York, and the publicity was unreal. We got up in the balcony, and at that point, Duane had never really expressed that he wanted to go back to live performing. But that night it just go too much for him. I'll never forget what he said ‚Äì this was about midway through: 'Johnny is really good but I can cut him.' Of course, I knew what he meant. Johnny was great ‚Äì this ain't belittlin' Johnny ‚Äì but I think he was giving Duane the confidence that he could make it because he knew he could play, he could cut it. He looked over at me. 'Jimmy,' he said. 'Do you see that stage down there? Next year by this time I'm going to be down there.' I looked at him and kind of did one of them double-takes, and I said, 'You know, I think you will.' And he was. I get chills when I think of that night.\\" =1968: Formation of the Allman Brothers Band= When asked how the band came together Duane stated: \\"Very slowly, I was in Muscle Shoals and I went down to Jacksonville and was jamming with Berry and Dicky. Jaimoe came with me from Muscle Shoals, he's originally from Macon. Gregg was in California and Butch was in Jacksonville where we all got together and jammed for a couple of months putting together songs and stuff. We just needed a singer and Gregg was the guy. Two weeks after Gregg got back from California we went up to New York and recorded there. We never played a gig before we cut our first album.\\" While living in Macon, Allman met Donna Roosman, who bore his second child, Galadrielle. The couple's relationship soon ended. He had an earlier relationship with Patti Chandlee which resulted in the birth of a daughter who was born deaf. =1969‚Äì1971: Success with Layla and At Fillmore East= The Allman Brothers Band went on to become one of the most influential rock groups of the 1970s. George Kimball, writing in Rolling Stone in 1971, described the group as \\"the best damn rock and roll band this country has produced in the past five years.\\" After months of nonstop rehearsing and gigging without Gregg, including free shows in Central City Park in Macon and Piedmont Park in Atlanta, all they needed was a singer/organist and Duane knew who he wanted. When Gregg got back from California the group settled on the name of the band and was ready to record. Their debut album, The Allman Brothers Band, was recorded in New York in September 1969 and released a few months later. In the midst of intense touring, work began in Macon and Miami (at Atlantic South‚ÄìCriteria Studios), and a little bit in New York, on the band's second album, Idlewild South. Produced mostly by Tom Dowd, Idlewild South was released in August 1970 and broke new ground for them by getting into the Billboard charts. After a concert in Miami, in August, watched by Eric Clapton and the other members of Derek and the Dominos, the two bands went back to Criteria studios in Miami, where the Dominoes were recording Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs. Members of both jammed, after which Allman and Clapton stayed up all night trading and showing-one another favorite licks, discovering they had a deep and instinctive rapport. Allman participated in the recording of most of the album's tracks, contributing some of his best- known work. He never left the Allman Brothers Band, though, despite being offered a permanent position with Clapton. Allman never toured with Derek and the Dominos, but he did make at least two appearances with them, on December 1, 1970, at the Curtis Hixon Hall in Tampa (Soulmates LP), and on the following day at Onondaga County War Memorial in Syracuse, New York. It is unclear whether he also appeared with them on November 20, 1970, at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, in Santa Monica, California, when guitarist Delaney Bramlett performed with the band.Roberty, Marc, The Eric Clapton Album, Viking Studio Books, 1994, In an interview, Allman told listeners how to tell who played what: Eric played the Fender parts and Duane played the Gibson parts. He continued by nonchalantly noting that the Fender had a sparklier sound, while the Gibson produced more of a \\"full-tilt screech\\".Jas Obrecht, \\"Duane Allman Remembered\\", Guitar Player, October 1981 Clapton wrote later in his autobiography that he and Allman were inseparable during the sessions in Florida; he talked about Allman as the \\"musical brother I'd never had but wished I did.\\"Clapton, The Autobiography, 128. The Allman Brothers went on to record At Fillmore East in March 1971. Meanwhile, Allman continued contributing session work to other artists' albums whenever he could. According to Skydog: The Duane Allman Story, he would spontaneously drop in at recording sessions and contribute to whatever was being taped that day. He received cash payments but no recording credits, making it virtually impossible to compile a complete discography of his works. Allman was well known for his melodic, extended and attention-holding guitar solos. During this period two of his stated influences were Miles Davis and John Coltrane. He said that he had listened intently to Davis's Kind of Blue for two years.Robert Palmer, liner notes for Kind of Blue, Columbia CK64935, 1997 As Allman's distinctive electric bottleneck sound began to mature, it evolved into the musical voice of what would come to be known as Southern rock, being picked up by other slide guitarists, including his bandmate Dickey Betts (after Allman's death), Rory Gallagher, Derek Trucks, Gary Rossington of Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Joe Walsh. Duane also taught a young Don Felder to play slide. Personal life Allman had a daughter, Galadrielle Allman, with Donna Roosman in 1969. In 2014, Galadrielle Allman published a reflection on her father, mother, family, and the culture of the 1960s, called Please Be With Me: A Song for My Father. Death Allman was killed in a motorcycle crash shortly after the release and initial success of At Fillmore East. On October 29, 1971, while the band was on a break from touring and recording, Allman was riding his Harley-Davidson Sportster motorcycle at high speed on Hillcrest Avenue, in the western part of Macon. As he approached Bartlett Street, a flatbed boom truck stopped suddenly in the intersection, forcing him to swerve sharply. He struck either the back of the truck or the ball on the crane and was thrown from the motorcycle, which landed on top of him and skidded another with him pinned underneath it, crushing his internal organs. He was alive when he was taken to a hospital, but despite immediate medical treatment, he died several hours later from massive internal injuries. =Memorial= The graves of Duane Allman and Berry Oakley Allman's funeral service was held on Monday, November 1, 1971, at Snow's Memorial Chapel in Macon, Georgia. In the chapel, packed with family and friends, many of the musicians who had been part of Allman's life were in attendance to mourn his death. Record producer Jerry Wexler gave the eulogy. Wexler praised Allman's musical achievements; his uncompromising dedication to Southern gospel, country, and blues music; and the place he attained alongside the great black musicians and blues singers from the South.Poe, Randy, Skydog: The Duane Allman Story (Backbeat Books) The band, joined by others, played several tunes, concluding with a group rendition of the Southern spiritual, \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken,\\" a band favorite.  Legacy  After Allman's funeral and some weeks of mourning, the five surviving members of the Allman Brothers Band carried on, resuming live performances and finishing the recording work interrupted by Allman's death. They named their next album Eat a Peach for Allman's response to an interviewer's question: \\"How are you helping the revolution?\\" Allman replied, \\"I'm hitting a lick for peace, and every time I'm in Georgia I eat a peach for peace. But you can't help the revolution, because there's just evolution. I'm a player. And players don't give a damn for nothing but playing....\\" Released as a double album in February 1972, it contains a side of live and studio tracks with Allman, two sides of \\"Mountain Jam\\", recorded with Allman at the same time as At Fillmore East in March, and a side of tracks by the surviving five members of the band. Allman Brothers Band bassist Berry Oakley died less than 13 months later, also at the age of 24, in a similar motorcycle crash with a city bus, three blocks from the site of Allman's fatal accident. Oakley was buried beside Allman in Rose Hill Cemetery in Macon, Georgia. The variety of Allman's session work and Allman Brothers Band bandleading can be heard to good effect on two posthumous Capricorn releases, An Anthology (1972) and An Anthology Volume II (1974). There are also several archival releases of live Allman Brothers Band performances from what the band calls \\"Duane's era\\". \\"Remember Duane Allman\\" tribute, carved into an excavation face next to Interstate 20 in 1973 Shortly after Allman's death, Ronnie Van Zant of Lynyrd Skynyrd dedicated the song \\"Free Bird\\" to Allman's memory. Van Zant would sometimes allude to this in concert; in the band's 1976 performance of \\"Free Bird\\" in Knebworth, England, Van Zant said to pianist Billy Powell, \\"Play it for Duane Allman.\\" The song was written well before Allman died and was not written with him in mind. (Allen Collins wrote the song after his then girlfriend asked him the question \\"if I leave here tomorrow, would you still remember me?\\") In 1973, four boys who were Hinds Junior College students living in Vicksburg, Miss. carved the very large letters \\"REMEMBER DUANE ALLMAN\\" into a vertical excavation face beside Interstate Highway 20 between Vicksburg, Mississippi and the school's campus in Raymond, Miss., on the route they travelled together while commuting between their homes and campus. A photograph was published in Rolling Stone magazine and in the Rolling Stone Illustrated History of Rock & Roll; the carving lasted for over 10 years. In 1998, the Georgia State Legislature passed a resolution designating a stretch of State Highway 19, U.S. Route 41, within Macon, as Duane Allman Boulevard in his honor. The route, which passes near The Allman Brothers Band Museum (at \\"The Big House,\\" where the band once lived) and the H&H; Restaurant, where the band members often dined, crosses the Raymond Berry Oakley III Bridge. The Skydog Musical Festival began on Duane Allman's 60th birthday and is celebrated every year in November in Macon's Central City Park. Admission is contribution to the needs of the homeless. Big House Van with Gazebo in Central City Park, Macon, GA. Country singer Travis Tritt, in the song \\"Put Some Drive in Your Country\\" on his debut album, sings \\"Now I still love old country / I ain't tryin' to put it down / But damn I miss Duane Allman / I wish he was still around.\\" Skydog, a seven-CD box set tracing the virtuosity of Allman on the guitar, was released in 2013 with the help of his daughter, Galadrielle Allman.

A generic drug is a pharmaceutical drug that contains the same chemical substance as a drug that was originally protected by chemical patents. Generic drugs are allowed for sale after the patents on the original drugs expire. Because the active chemical substance is the same, the medical profile of generics is believed to be equivalent in performance. A generic drug has the same active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) as the original, but it may differ in some characteristics such as the manufacturing process, formulation, excipients, color, taste, and packaging. Although they may not be associated with a particular company, generic drugs are usually subject to government regulations in the countries in which they are dispensed. They are labeled with the name of the manufacturer and a generic non-proprietary name such as the United States Adopted Name (USAN) or International Non-proprietary Name (INN) of the drug. A generic drug must contain the same active ingredients as the original brand-name formulation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires generics to be identical to or within an acceptable bioequivalent range of their brand-name counterparts, with respect to pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. (The FDA's use of the word \\"identical\\" is a legal interpretation, not literal.) Biopharmaceuticals, such as monoclonal antibodies, differ biologically from small molecule drugs. Biosimilars have active pharmaceutical ingredients that are almost identical to the original product and are typically regulated under an extended set of rules, but they are not the same as generic drugs as the active ingredients are not the same as those of their reference products. In most cases, generic products become available after the patent protections, afforded to a drug's original developer, expire. Once generic drugs enter the market, competition often leads to substantially lower prices for both the original brand-name product and its generic equivalents. In most countries, patents give 20 years of protection. However, many countries and regions, such as the European Union and the United States, may grant up to five years of additional protection (\\"patent term restoration\\") if manufacturers meet specific goals, such as conducting clinical trials for pediatric patients. Manufacturers, wholesalers, insurers, and drugstores can all increase prices at various stages of production and distribution. In 2014, according to an analysis by the Generic Pharmaceutical Association, generic drugs accounted for 88% of the 4.3 billion prescriptions filled in the United States. \\"Branded generics\\" on the other hand are defined by the FDA and NHS as \\"products that are (a) either novel dosage forms of off-patent products produced by a manufacturer that is not the originator of the molecule, or (b) a molecule copy of an off-patent product with a trade name.\\" Since the company making branded generics can spend little on research and development, it is able to spend on marketing alone, thus earning higher profits and driving costs down. For example, the largest revenues of Ranbaxy, now owned by Sun Pharma, came from branded generics. Nomenclature Generic drug names are constructed using standardized affixes that distinguish drugs between and within classes and suggest their action. Economics When a pharmaceutical company first markets a drug, it is usually under a patent that, until it expires, the company can use to exclude competitors by suing them for patent infringement. Pharmaceutical companies that develop new drugs generally only invest in drug candidates with strong patent protection as a strategy to recoup their costs of drug development (including the costs of the drug candidates that fail) and to make a profit. The average cost to a brand-name company of discovering, testing, and obtaining regulatory approval for a new drug, with a new chemical entity, was estimated to be as much as US$800 million in 2003 and US$2.6 billion in 2014. Drug companies that bring new products have several product line extension strategies they use to extend their exclusivity, some of which are seen as gaming the system and referred to by critics as \\"evergreening\\", but at some point there is no patent protection available. For as long as a drug patent lasts, a brand-name company enjoys a period of market exclusivity, or monopoly, in which the company is able to set the price of the drug at a level that maximizes profit. This profit often greatly exceeds the development and production costs of the drug, allowing the company to offset the cost of research and development of other drugs that are not profitable or do not pass clinical trials. ¬∑ The impact of loss of patent exclusivity on pharmaceutical products varies significantly across different product classes (e.g., biologics vs. small molecules) largely due to regulatory, legal and manufacturing hurdles associated with such products. Indeed, the greater degree of ‚Äòbrand-brand‚Äô competitive dynamics seen in the biologics and complex generics space allows manufacturers of originators to better protect market share following loss of patent exclusivity. Large pharmaceutical companies often spend millions protecting their patents from generic competition. Apart from litigation, they may reformulate a drug or license a subsidiary (or another company) to sell generics under the original patent. Generics sold under license from the patent holder are known as authorized generics. Generic drugs are usually sold for significantly lower prices than their branded equivalents and at lower profit margins. One reason for this is that competition increases among producers when a drug is no longer protected by patents. Generic companies incur fewer costs in creating generic drugs‚Äîonly the cost of manufacturing, without the costs of drug discovery and drug development‚Äîand are therefore able to maintain profitability at a lower price. The prices are often low enough for users in less-prosperous countries to afford them. For example, Thailand has imported millions of doses of a generic version of the blood-thinning drug Plavix (used to help prevent heart attacks) from India, the leading manufacturer of generic drugs, at a cost of US$0.03 per dose. Generic drug companies may also receive the benefit of the previous marketing efforts of the brand-name company, including advertising, presentations by drug representatives, and distribution of free samples. Many drugs introduced by generic manufacturers have already been on the market for a decade or more and may already be well known to patients and providers, although often under their branded name. India is a leading country in the world's generic drugs market, exporting US$20.0 billion worth of drugs in the 2019‚Äì20 (April‚ÄìMarch) year. India exports generic drugs to the United States and the European Union. In the United Kingdom, generic drug pricing is controlled by the government's reimbursement rate. The price paid by pharmacists and doctors is determined mainly by the number of license holders, the sales value of the original brand, and the ease of manufacture. A typical price decay graph will show a \\"scalloped\\" curve, which usually starts at the brand-name price on the day of generic launch and then falls as competition intensifies. After some years, the graph typically flattens out at approximately 20% of the original brand price. In about 20% of cases, the price \\"bounces\\": Some license holders withdraw from the market when the selling price dips below their cost of goods, and the price then rises for a while until the license holders re-enter the market with new stock. The NHS spent about ¬£4.3 billion on generic medicines in 2016‚Äì17. In 2012, 84% of prescriptions in the US were filled with generic drugs, and in 2014, the use of generic drugs in the United States led to US$254 billion in health care savings. In the mid 2010s the generics industry began transitioning to the end of an era of giant patent cliffs in the pharmaceutical industry; patented drugs with sales of around US$28 billion were set to come off patent in 2018, but in 2019 only about US$10 billion in revenue was set to open for competition, and less the next year. Companies in the industry have responded with consolidation or turning to try to generate new drugs. Regulation Most nations require generic drug manufacturers to prove that their formulations are bioequivalent to their brand-name counterparts.WHO Technical Report Series No. 937: Annex 7 (pdf) WHO Expert Committee on Specifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations, Fortieth Report (WHO Technical Report Series No. 937): Annex 7 ‚Äì Multisource (generic) pharmaceutical products: guidelines on registration requirements to establish interchangeability, May 2006.

Accessed 2008-06-15 Bioequivalence does not mean generic drugs must be exactly the same as the brand-name product (\\"pharmaceutical equivalent\\"). Chemical differences may exist; a different salt or ester may be used, for instance. Different inactive ingredients means that the generic may look different from the originator brand. However, the therapeutic effect of the drug must be the same (\\"pharmaceutical alternative\\"). Most small molecule drugs are accepted as bioequivalent if their pharmacokinetic parameters of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) are within a 90% confidence interval of 80‚Äì125%; most approved generics are well within this limit. For more complex products‚Äîsuch as inhalers, patch delivery systems, liposomal preparations, or biosimilar drugs‚Äîdemonstrating pharmacodynamic or clinical equivalence is more challenging. =United States= Enacted in 1984, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act, informally known as the Hatch‚ÄìWaxman Act, standardized procedures for recognition of generic drugs. In 2007, the FDA launched the Generic Initiative for Value and Efficiency (GIVE): an effort to modernize and streamline the generic drug approval process, and to increase the number and variety of generic products available. Before a company can market a generic drug, it needs to file an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) with the Food and Drug Administration, seeking to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence to a previously approved \\"reference-listed drug\\" and proving that it can manufacture the drug safely and consistently. For an ANDA to be approved, the FDA requires that the 90% confidence interval of the geometric mean test/reference ratios for the total drug exposure (represented by the area under the curve or AUC) and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) should fall within limits of 80‚Äì125%. (This range is part of a statistical calculation, and does not mean that generic drugs are allowed to differ from their brand-name counterparts by up to 25 percent.) The FDA evaluated 2,070 studies conducted between 1996 and 2007 that compared the absorption of brand-name and generic drugs into a person's body. The average difference in absorption between the generic and the brand-name drug was 3.5 percent, comparable to the difference between two batches of a brand-name drug. Non-innovator versions of biologic drugs, or biosimilars, require clinical trials for immunogenicity in addition to tests establishing bioequivalency. These products cannot be entirely identical because of batch- to-batch variability and their biological nature, and they are subject to extra rules. Generic Drugs Research When an application is approved, the FDA adds the generic drug to its Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations list and annotates the list to show the equivalence between the reference-listed drug and the generic. The FDA also recognizes drugs that use the same ingredients with different bioavailability and divides them into therapeutic equivalence groups. For example, as of 2006, diltiazem hydrochloride had four equivalence groups, all using the same active ingredient, but considered equivalent only within each group.Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, Preface. ‚Äì an explanation of FDA terms and procedures In order to start selling a drug promptly after the patent on innovator drug expires, a generic company has to file its ANDA well before the patent expires. This puts the generic company at risk of being sued for patent infringement, since the act of filing the ANDA is considered \\"constructive infringement\\" of the patent. In order to incentivize generic companies to take that risk the Hatch-Waxman act granted a 180-day administrative exclusivity period to generic drug manufacturers who are the first to file an ANDA. When faced with patent litigation from the drug innovator or patent holder, generic companies will often counter-sue, challenging the validity of the patent. Bristol-Myers Squibb press release on successful defense of Plavix patent Apotex press release on successful challenge of Paxil patent Like any litigation between private parties, the innovator and generic companies may choose to settle the litigation. Some of these settlement agreements have been struck down by courts when they took the form of reverse payment patent settlement agreements, in which the generic company basically accepts a payment to drop the litigation, delaying the introduction of the generic product and frustrating the purpose of the Hatch‚ÄìWaxman Act. Innovator companies sometimes try to maintain some of the revenue from their drug after patents expire by allowing another company to sell an authorized generic; a 2011 FTC report found that consumers benefitted from lower costs when an authorized generic was introduced during the 180 day exclusivity period, as it created competition. Innovator companies may also present arguments to the FDA that the ANDA should not be accepted by filing an FDA citizen petition. The right of individuals or organizations to petition the federal government is guaranteed by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. For this reason, the FDA has promulgated regulations that provide, among other things, that at any time, any \\"interested person\\" can request that the FDA \\"issue, amend, or revoke a regulation or order,\\" and set forth a procedure for doing so. 21 C.F.R. Part 10 Acceptance Some generic drugs are viewed with suspicion by doctors. For example, warfarin (Coumadin) has a narrow therapeutic window and requires frequent blood tests to make sure patients do not have a subtherapeutic or a toxic level. A study performed in Ontario showed that replacing Coumadin with generic warfarin was safe, but many physicians are not comfortable with their patients taking branded generic equivalents. In some countries (for example, Australia) where a drug is prescribed under more than one brand name, doctors may choose not to allow pharmacists to substitute a brand different from the one prescribed unless the consumer requests it.\\"Prescribers may disallow brand switching by ticking the relevant box on the PBS prescription form\\" Fraud A series of scandals around the approval of generic drugs in the late 1980s shook public confidence in generic drugs; there were several instances in which companies obtained bioequivalence data fraudulently, by using the branded drug in their tests instead of their own product, and a congressional investigation found corruption at the FDA, where employees were accepting bribes to approve some generic companies' applications and delaying or denying others. In 2007, North Carolina Public Radio's The People's Pharmacy began reporting on consumers' complaints that generic versions of bupropion (Wellbutrin) were yielding unexpected effects. Subsequently, Impax Laboratories's 300 mg extended-release tablets, marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, were withdrawn from the US market after the FDA determined in 2012 that they were not bioequivalent. Problems with the quality of generic drugs ‚Äì especially those produced outside the United States ‚Äì are widespread as of 2019. The FDA does infrequent ‚Äì less than annual ‚Äì inspections of production sites outside the United States. The FDA normally gives advance notice of inspections, which can lead to cover-ups of problems before inspectors arrive; inspections performed with little or no advance notice have produced evidence of serious problems at a majority of generic drug manufacturing sites in India and China. Litigation Two women, each claiming to have suffered severe medical complications from a generic version of metoclopramide, lost their Supreme Court appeal on June 23, 2011. In a 5‚Äì4 ruling in PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing,Supreme Court of the United States 564 PLIVA, Inc. v. Mensing U. S.  (2011) the court held that generic companies cannot be held liable for information, or the lack of information, on the originator's label.Adam Liptak for the New York Times. June 23, 2011 Drug Makers Win Two Supreme Court DecisionsSteven Casey for Law360. October 24, 2012 Generic Pharmaceutical Liability: Challenges And Changes =India= The Indian government began encouraging more drug manufacturing by Indian companies in the early 1960s, and with the Patents Act in 1970.http://www.ircc.iitb.ac.in/IPcourse/patent.html The Patents Act removed composition patents for foods and drugs, and though it kept process patents, these were shortened to a period of five to seven years. The resulting lack of patent protection created a niche in both the Indian and global markets that Indian companies filled by reverse-engineering new processes for manufacturing low-cost drugs. The code of ethics issued by the Medical Council of India in 2002 calls for physicians to prescribe drugs by their generic names only. India is a leading country in the world's generic drugs market, with Sun Pharmaceuticals being the largest pharmaceutical company in India. Indian generics companies exported US$17.3 billion worth of drugs in the 2017‚Äì18 (April‚ÄìMarch) year. = China = Generic drug production is a large part of the pharmaceutical industry in China. Western observers have said that China lacks administrative protection for patents. However, entry to the World Trade Organization has brought a stronger patent system.  Industry  As of 2019, several major companies traditionally dominate the generic drugs market, including Teva, Mylan, Novartis' Sandoz, Amneal and Endo International. Prices in traditional generic drugs have declined and newer companies such India- based Sun Pharma, Aurobindo Pharma, and Dr. Reddy's Laboratories as well as Canada-based Apotex have taken market share, which has led to a focus on biosimilars.

The island covers an area of approximately , which is only the peak of a much larger submarine volcano. The island is New Zealand's most active cone volcano, and has been built up by continuous volcanic activity over the past 150,000 years. The nearest mainland towns are Whakatane and Tauranga. The island has been in a nearly continuous stage of releasing volcanic gas at least since it was sighted by James Cook in 1769. Whakaari erupted continually from December 1975 until September 2000, marking the world's longest historic eruption episode, according to GeoNet, and also in 2012, 2016, and 2019. Sulphur was mined on the island until the 1930s. Ten miners were killed in 1914 when part of the crater wall collapsed. The main activities on the island now include guided tours and scientific research. Access to the island is allowed only as a member of a tour run by a registered tour operator. A large eruption occurred at 14:11 on 9 December 2019, which resulted in 21 fatalities, including two people who were missing and ruled to be dead by a coroner. Twenty-five survivors were seriously injured, many critically and suffering severe burns. Three survivors suffered minor injuries. Forty-seven people were reportedly on the island when it erupted. A second eruption closely followed the first. Geography Whakaari / White Island is an irregular oval in shape, with a length (northwest‚Äìsoutheast) of and a width of , and covers an area of approximately . It lies in the Bay of Plenty from the North Island mainland, due north of the town of Opotiki and north-northeast of WhakatƒÅne. The island's active crater lies slightly southeast of the island's centre, and contains an acidic lake. The crater has a sharp rim to the northwest, with its highest point (also the island's highest point) being the Mount Gisborne in the west. The Mount Percival forms the northern part of the rim. An older vent, the Mount Ngatoro, lies to the northwest.\\"Whakaari / White Island,\\" topomap.co.nz. Retrieved 16 December 2019. The exposed island is only the peak of a much larger submarine volcano, which rises up to above the nearby seafloor. The island is generally rugged, with cliffs surrounding most of the coast. The only exceptions are to the southeast of the crater, where ash and boulder slopes descend to Te Awapuia Bay (also known as Crater Bay), the site of derelict buildings and the island's wharf. This bay lies between a prominent headland, Troup Head, at the island's southeastern extreme, and the island's southernmost point, Otaketake, which is the site of one of the island's gannet colonies. Another colony exists at Te Hokowhitu, the cliff which forms much of the western coast of the island. Several rock reefs and islets are located along the island's northeast coast, and there is also a rock reef at Troup Head. A small islet, Club Rocks, lies south of Otaketake Point. It consists of a set of four sea stacks rising to more than above sea level. In addition, four sea stacks collectively known as Volckner Rocks lie northwest of Whakaari / White Island. Three of these sea stacks rise precipitously from the sea Ô¨Çoor (less than below sea level) to a maximum height of m above sea level. The fourth sea stack is just an eroded stump. Geology Whakaari / White Island is an andesite‚Äìdacite stratovolcano that consists of two overlapping volcanic cones, which are the Ngatoro and Central cones. The Ngatoro Cone is extinct and partially eroded. The amphitheatre- shaped Central Cone is an active cone. The crater of Central Cone is open to the southeast as the result of major, past flank landslides involving hydrothermally altered rock and past phreatic and phreatomagmatic eruptions. the Ngatoro Cone and Central cones are both constructed of alternating layers of lava flows, tuffs, agglomerates, tephra, igneous dikes, and breccias. Some of these strata have been altered to varying degrees by highly corrosive and acid hydrothermal fluids and gases.Cole, J.W., Thordarson, T. and Burt, R.M., 2000.

The modern crater floor of Whakaari / White Island lies less than above sea level and is largely covered by material from the 1914 debris avalanche. The main crater contains three coalescing sub-craters. The sub-craters are aligned NW-SE within the amphitheatre-shaped Central Cone. The open sea breaches the south-eastern crater wall in three places to form Shark, Te Awapuia, and Wilson bays, which Troup Head and Pinnacle Head separate from each other. Long-lived, semi-continuous, weak, hydrothermal explosions, similar to those occurring in the Western sub-crater today, are regarded to have formed these three bays as hydrothermal explosion craters. Whakaari / White Island and the sea stacks that form Club Rocks and Volckner Rocks are the emergent summits of a larger, √ó , submarine volcano. It is known as White Island Volcano and has a total volume of . The bathymetry surrounding the emergent summit of Whakaari / White Island consists of a broad, sloping shelf extending from sea level to approximately depth. Steep margins define the extent of the submarine volcano at a depths of Duncan, A.R., 1970. The petrology and petrochemistry of andesite volcanoes in Eastern Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. Unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand. pp.362 The amphitheatre-shaped crater of the modern Central Cone is argued to have been created by the collapse of the former cone of the White Island Volcano to the southwest. Based on extrapolating 20 m GIS contour data to enclose the present crater and upwards with a maximum slope angle of 30¬∞, the former pre-collapse summit was inferred to have been high. Side-scan and bathymetric data indicate possible debris flows associated with its collapse that can be traced back to the current crater on White Island. One of these debris flows exited the crater on the southern side of Troup Head and towards the southeast. It produced well-defined boulder-covered lobes on the seafloor. Another debris flow exited the modern crater on the northern side of Troup Head and through several submarine valleys towards the east into deep water. It produced boulder-covered valley-fill deposits. The latter debris flow was large enough to have produced a significant tsunami. As a result of the collapse of the former cone of the White Island Volcano, it is suspected to have generated a high tsunami that flooded the coast of Bay of Plenty as much as inland between 3,000 and 2,200 B.P.de Lange, W.P., Hansford, A. and Moon, V.G., 2006.

The Taupo Volcanic Zone forms the southernmost segment of the -long Tonga‚ÄìKermadec‚ÄìTaupo volcanic arc system and the Lau Basin‚ÄìHavre Trough‚ÄìNgatoro Basin back-arc basin system. For the past few thousand years, Whakaari / White Island has been the location for an open, highly reactive hydrothermal system. This hydrothermal system expresses itself as hot springs and mud pools, fumaroles, and acid streams and lakes. the present day centre for volcanic activity and outgassing is a large crater lake of boiling acidic waters located in the western subcrater. The intermixing m√©lange of marine waters, meteoric waters, and hot magmatic fluids generate acid brines, with ph as low as 2, that outgas and form numerous and often transitory hot springs and mud pools, fumaroles, and acid streams and lakes. The crater lake of boiling acidic water, which occupies the western subcrater, appears to vary in volume due to changing meteorological conditions and fluctuating levels of hydrothermal activity.Christenson, B.W., White, S., Britten, K. and Scott, B.J., 2017.

Although Strombolian activity occurred from the late seventies to the mid-eighties, explosive eruptions at Whakaari / White Island are typically phreatic or phreatomagmatic in style. The lava flows, ash, and pyroclastic flows produced by historic and prehistoric eruptions are andesitic and dacitic in composition. These eruptions also produce discrete craters within crater-fill deposits of the Central Cone. Since 1826, there has been a minimum of 28 phreatic or phreatomagmatic eruptions. In addition, prehistoric eruptions have also extruded lava. The lava flows from these prehistoric eruptions are exposed crater walls of the Central Cone. Whakaari / White Island's frequent activity and easy access attract scientists and volcanologists as well as many tourists. For example, this volcano provides a readily studied example of the type of volcanic magmatic‚Äìhydrothermal system involved in the generation of porphyry copper deposits.Hedenquist, J.W., Simmons, S.F., Giggenbach, W.F., and Eldridge, C.S., 1993. \\"White Island, New Zealand, volcanic-hydrothermal system represents the geochemical environment of high-sulfidation Cu and Au ore deposition\\", Geology, v. 21, pp. 731‚Äì734.Mandon, C.

Using volcanic tremor for eruption forecasting at White Island volcano (Whakaari), New Zealand. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, 302, pp.11‚Äì23. The island is typically on an alert level rating of 1 or 2 on a scale of 0 to 5; as \\"Level 2 is the highest alert level before an eruption takes place and indicates 'moderate to heightened volcanic unrest' with the 'potential for eruption hazards.'\\" The alert level was moved from level 1 to level 2 on 18 November 2019. This volcano is monitored by the Deep Earth Carbon Degassing Project. At most times the volcanic activity is limited to steaming fumaroles and boiling mud. In March 2000, three small vents appeared in the main crater and began belching ash which covered the island in fine grey powder. An eruption on 27 July 2000 blanketed the island with mud and scoria and a new crater appeared. Major eruptions in 1981‚Äì83 altered much of the island's landscape and destroyed the extensive p≈çhutukawa forest. The large crater created at that time now contains a lake, whose level varies substantially. Between July and August 2012 the island showed signs of increased activity with lake and gas levels rising from inside the crater. On 5 August 2012 a minor eruption occurred, sending ash into the air. More eruptions have followed since. Ongoing volcanic activity and tremors on 25 January 2013 suggested another eruption was imminent. A small eruption occurred on 20 August 2013 at 10.23 am, lasting for ten minutes and producing mostly steam. =2019 eruption= In November 2019, background activity at Whakaari increased and gas, steam and mud was being ejected from the crater.https://www.geonet.org.nz/news/1prVlz8jGXwWayA8D6Uu5yhttps://www.geonet.org.nz/news/5gMP3pBjFuQmNOQB89rZT4 View of the 2019 Whakaari / White Island eruption from Whakatane at 14:20, 9 minutes after the start of the eruption At 14:11 NZDT on 9 December 2019, Whakaari / White Island erupted. It was reported that there were forty-seven people on the island when the eruption happened. Twenty-one people were killed, including two people who are missing and confirmed dead on 23 January 2020, and a further twenty-five were seriously injured, many critically. The bodies of two victims have not been recovered and may have been lost to the sea. The ongoing seismic and volcanic activity in the area and subsequently heavy rainfall as well as low visibility and toxic gases all hampered recovery efforts.https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/helicopter-pilot-says- rain-and-ash-hampering-search-bodies-white-island-victims Experts identified the event as a phreatic eruption: a release of steam and volcanic gases which caused an explosion, launching rock and ash into the air.. Minor ash emissions were observed on 23 and 26 December, but no further eruptions occurred. Visual observations conducted in January showed that lava had been extruded into the vents created by the eruption on 9 December. History Whakaari / White Island, 22 October 1844, from album of drawings compiled by T.E. Donne =Name= The MƒÅori name Whakaari is recorded in multiple 19th century texts by Europeans, with one mention dating back to 1849, though spelling varied including Wakaari, Whakari, and Whaka ari. The name Whakaari means \\"to make visible\\" or \\"exposed to view\\". The full MƒÅori name for the island is te puia whakaari, meaning \\"The Dramatic Volcano\\". Whakaari was named \\"White Island\\" by Captain Cook on 1 October 1769. According to LINZ this name came from the dense clouds of white steam emanating from it. Alternatively, he may have been alluding to the guano deposits that once covered the island. Although Cook sailed close to the island, he did not record that it was a volcano. The island's official name was changed from \\"White Island (Whakaari)\\" to \\"Whakaari / White Island\\" in 1997. This makes it one of many places in New Zealand with dual MƒÅori and English names. =Mythology= Some MƒÅori myths describe Whakaari as part of NgƒÅtoro-i-rangi's ascent of Tongariro. In one account, he called on his ancestors for warmth; the fire was kindled on Whakaari and brought to him. Other versions of this story are similar but it is his sisters, or the gods, who send him warmth from Whakaari. Other stories give origin stories for the island. One states that it rose from the deep after the god Maui, having first touched fire was so greatly tortured by the pain that he instantly dived under water to calm his pain; and in the place where he shook the fire from him arose Whakaari. Another tells that Moutohora Island and Whakaari / White Island were peaks in the Huiarau Range near Waikaremoana but were jealous of each other, and rushed towards the ocean, leaving behind them the tracks that now form the Whakatane valley and either the Tauranga or Te Waimana valley. Whakaari was faster, so got to the better position where it stands today. =Industry= Corroding machinery at old sulphur mine Attempts were made in the mid-1880s, again from 1898 to 1901, and then from 1913 to 1914, to mine sulphur from Whakaari / White Island, with the island at first being owned by John Wilson. Mining came to a halt in September 1914, when part of the western crater rim collapsed, creating a lahar that killed all 10 workers,Boon, Kevin. \\"The 1914 White Island eruption\\". URL accessed 4 December 2007. (Archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5TqkjKdYS) who disappeared without trace. Only a camp cat survived, found some days afterwards by the resupply ship and dubbed \\"Peter the Great\\".Sarah Lowe and Kim Westerskov (1993). \\"Steam and brimstone\\", New Zealand Geographic 17, 82‚Äì106. In 1923, mining was again attempted but, learning from the 1914 disaster, the miners built their huts on a flat part of the island near a gannet colony. Each day they would lower their boat into the sea from a gantry, and row around to the mining factory wharf in Crater Bay. If the sea was rough they had to clamber around the rocks on a very narrow track on the crater's edge. Before the days of antibiotics, sulphur was used as an antibacterial agent in medicines, in the making of match-heads, and for sterilising wine corks. The sulphur was hauled to the crushing plant in small rail trucks, and a bagging facility was also constructed. However, there was not enough sulphur in the material mined at the island, so the ground-up rock was used as a component of agricultural fertiliser. Mining ended in the 1930s, because of the inadequate mineral content in the fertiliser. The remains of the buildings involved can still be seen, heavily corroded by the sulphuric gases. =Ownership= The ownership of Whakaari / White Island was one of the first two cases heard by the Native Land Court of New Zealand (now called the MƒÅori Land Court), the other being ownership of nearby Motuhora. Retireti Tapihana (Tapsell) brought the case in 1867, claiming ownership. Retireti was the son of Phillip Tapsell and Hine-i-t≈´rama NgƒÅtiki. Ownership was awarded jointly to Retireti Tapihana and his sister, Katherine Simpkins. In 1874, the island was sold to the partnership John Wilson and William Kelly by the estate of Retireti Tapihana (Tapsell). Wilson and Kelly subsequently leased it to the Auckland-based partnership of Stewart and Appleby, however after the conditions of the lease were unfulfilled; it was put up for lease again. The island is privately owned by the Buttle Family Trust. It was bought by George Raymond Buttle, a stockbroker, in 1936. Buttle later refused to sell it to the government, but agreed in 1952 that it be declared a private scenic reserve. Local government The island is not included in the boundaries of a territorial authority council (district council) and the Minister of Local Government is its territorial authority, with support from the Department of Internal Affairs. The functions of the territorial authority are limited, as the island is uninhabited, the land is undeveloped and it is privately owned. The island is within the boundaries of the Bay of Plenty Regional Council for regional council functions. Natural life Whakaari / White Island is one of New Zealand's main breeding colonies for Australasian gannets. Thousands of gannets come to the island each year to mate, raise chicks, and feed on the fish in the water around it. There is little vegetation on the island itself, but seaweed grows in the waters around it and gannet parents harvest it to cool off chicks. An ornithologist who visited in 1912 found five species and identified four; in addition to gannets they found red-billed gulls, great- winged petrels, and white-fronted terns. BirdLife International has declared the island to be an Important Bird Area because of the gannets nesting colony. Access Tourists on the island in April 2019 Visitors approaching the wharf Whakaari / White Island is privately owned. It was declared a private scenic reserve in 1953, and is subject to the provisions of the Reserves Act 1977. Visitors cannot land without permission. However, it is easily accessible by authorised tourist operators. The waters surrounding the island are well known for their fish stocks. Yellowtail kingfish abound all year, while there is deep-water fishing for hapuka and bluenose (a type of warehou) in the winter. In the summer, blue, black and striped marlin, as well as yellowfin tuna can be caught. A small charter fleet, offering day trips and overnight or longer trips, operates from the nearby port at Whakatane.

Origins He was the son and heir of Humphrey III de Bohun (pre-1144-1181) of Trowbridge Castle in Wiltshire and of Caldicot Castle in south-east Wales, 5th feudal baron of Trowbridge,Sanders, I.J. English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, p.91 who served King Henry II as Lord High Constable of England. His mother was Margaret of Huntingdon, widow of Conan IV, Duke of Brittany (d.1171) and a daughter of Henry of Scotland, 3rd Earl of Northumberland, 3rd Earl of Huntingdon, son of King David I of Scotland by his wife Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon. Henry's half-sister was Constance, Duchess of Brittany.  Earldom  His paternal grandmother was Margaret of Hereford, a daughter of Miles FitzWalter of Gloucester, 1st Earl of Hereford, Lord of Brecknock (died 1143), Sheriff of Gloucester and Constable of England. After the male line of Miles of Gloucester failed, in 1199 King John created Henry de Bohun Earl of Hereford and Constable of England. His lands lay chiefly on the Welsh Marches, and from this date the Bohuns took a foremost place among the Marcher barons. Henry de Bohun was one of the twenty-five barons elected by their peers to enforce the terms of Magna Carta in 1215. He was subsequently excommunicated by the Pope. In the civil war that followed Magna Carta, he was a supporter of King Louis VIII of France and was captured at the Battle of Lincoln in 1217.

Lineage He was the fifth son of Humphrey de Bohun, 4th Earl of Hereford and Elizabeth of Rhuddlan. He had a twin brother, Edward. His maternal grandparents were Edward I of England and his first Queen consort Eleanor of Castile. Life William de Bohun assisted at the arrest of Roger Mortimer in 1330, allowing Edward III to take power. After this, he was a trusted friend and commander of the king and he participated in the renewed wars with Scotland. In 1332, he received many new properties: Hinton and Spaine in Berkshire; Great Haseley, Ascott, Deddington, Pyrton and Kirtlington in Oxfordshire; Wincomb in Buckinghamshire; Longbenington in Lincolnshire; Kneesol in Nottinghamshire; Newnsham in Gloucestershire, Wix in Essex, and Bosham in Sussex. In 1335, he married Elizabeth de Badlesmere (1313 ‚Äì 8 June 1356). Her parents Bartholomew de Badlesmere, 1st Baron Badlesmere, and Margaret de Clare had both turned against Edward II the decade before. Elizabeth and William were granted some of the property of Elizabeth's first husband, who had also been Mortimer's son and heir. William was created Earl of Northampton in 1337, one of the six earls created by Edward III to renew the ranks of the higher nobility. Since de Bohun was a younger son, and did not have an income suitable to his rank, he was given an annuity until suitable estates could be found. In 1349 he became a Knight of the Garter. He served as High Sheriff of Rutland from 1349 until his death in 1360. Campaigns in Flanders, Brittany, Scotland, Victor at Sluys and Crecy In 1339 he accompanied the King to Flanders. He served variously in Brittany and in Scotland, and was present at the great English victories at Sluys and was a commander at Cr√©cy. His most stunning feat was commanding an English force to victory against a much bigger French force at the Battle of Morlaix in 1342. Some of the details are in dispute, but it is clear that he made good use of pit traps, which stopped the French cavalry. Renowned Diplomat In addition to being a warrior, William was also a renowned diplomat. He negotiated two treaties with France, one in 1343 and one in 1350. He was also charged with negotiating in Scotland for the freedom of King David Bruce, King of Scots, who was held prisoner by the English. Senior naval command From the 8 March 1352 to 5 March 1355 he was appointed Admiral of the Northern Seas, Fleet. Issue 1\\\\.

Vast plateaus, river valleys, mountains, and castles abound in Tr√°s os Montes e Alto Douro. History A first attempt to register its constitution was made under the reign of King Sancho II (1223‚Äì1248). A second was made in the reign of his son and successor, Afonso III (1248‚Äì1279), under the Inquiri√ß√µes or royal commissions in 1258, intending to base the territory of Tr√°s-os-Montes on so-called \\"new towns\\" under direct control of the Crown. Afonso III (1248‚Äì1279) gave it its charter in 1253, referring to the town, \\"a hill opposite the Crespos\\", which already had a core of settlements organized around the Church of St. Facundo. Currently the region is divided into two districts on the right (northern) bank of the Douro river -- Vila Real and Bragan√ßa, with 5 other municipalities on the south bank of the Douro river included in the districts of Viseu and Guarda. The name -- Beyond-the-Mountains and Upper Douro -- refers to the location on the \\"other\\" (eastern) side of such mountains as Mar√£o, Alv√£o and Ger√™s, which separate the coast from the interior, and along the upper valley of the Douro River. This isolation kept the province poor and underpopulated for centuries, causing many people to move to the coast or emigrate to other European countries such as France, Luxembourg and Switzerland, and to Brazil. The most important towns in the region are Vila Real, Bragan√ßa, Chaves, Mirandela, Macedo de Cavaleiros, Lamego, Peso da R√©gua, Mogadouro, Miranda do Douro and Valpa√ßos. All are relatively small, with less than 50 000 inhabitants. Many people in the region still live in small villages. Traditionally these villages were cut off from the coast due to the lack of good roads, and suffered the effects of poverty and isolation. Emigration was often the only option. Today the situation has improved with better roads, but most villages are still losing population as youngsters there move to bigger towns for a better life. In small villages the ageing inhabitants still eke out a living from small farms. Corn, rye, potatoes, wheat, olive oil, chestnuts, and grapes for wine (namely Port wine) have been the main agricultural products. Granite and mineral water are also important industries. There is a popular saying: \\"Beyond Mar√£o, those who rule are those who're there\\" (\\"Para l√° do Mar√£o mandam os que l√° est√£o\\"). Lisbon has paid little attention to this area until recent years. According to Padre Fontes, a local ethnographer, \\"in this centuries-old \\"corner of the corner of Europe\\", alone, in a struggle against the harsh soil and inclement climate, a character was formed: \\"that of the sad demeanor, the mistrusting air, courageous, daring, hardworking, loyal, and with strength of character a way of life.\\" Etnografia Transmontana, Lisbon, 1992 The Transmontanos are known in Portugal for their often plentiful table, usually filled with wine, olive oil, sausage and bread. Municipalities The historical province of Tr√°s-os-Montes e Alto Douro included 31 municipalities, divided between four districts (Vila Real, Bragan√ßa, Viseu and Guarda), that include: ;Vila Real (14 municipalities): * Alij√≥ * Boticas * Chaves * Mes√£o Frio * Mondim de Basto * Montalegre * Mur√ßa * Peso da R√©gua * Ribeira de Pena * Sabrosa * Santa Marta de Penagui√£o * Valpa√ßos * Vila Pouca de Aguiar * Vila Real ;Bragan√ßa (12 municipalities) * Alf√¢ndega da F√© * Bragan√ßa * Carrazeda de Ansi√£es * Freixo de Espada-√†-Cinta * Macedo de Cavaleiros * Miranda do Douro * Mirandela * Mogadouro * Torre de Moncorvo * Vila Flor * Vimioso * Vinhais ;Viseu (4 of 24 municipalities) * Armamar * Lamego * S√£o Jo√£o da Pesqueira * Tabua√ßo ;Guarda (1 of 14 municipalities) * Vila Nova de Foz C√¥a In 1998 there was a referendum on the creation of new Administrative Regions. The proposed region of Tr√°s-os- Montes e Alto Douro included these 31 municipalities, plus M√™da, also from the District of Guarda. The referendum had low participation (less than the required 50% to be mandatory), but the No won and the Administrative Regions were not created. Culture Mask Diabo used on folk fest of Carnaval. Due to the region's isolation from outside influence, many folkloric forms have remained preserved up to the modern day. One example would be the area's distinctive traditional bagpipe, the gaita transmontana. Not only did Tr√°s-os- Montes maintain a piping tradition as bagpipes in general declined throughout Europe, but the regional bagpipe also shows many aspects of pre-modern musical scales which have been preserved. Also, it's in this region that is spoken the second official language of Portugal, the Mirandese language.

University of Hawaii Press 1998, The Life and Works of Shinran Shonin was a Japanese Buddhist monk, who was born in Hino (now a part of Fushimi, Kyoto) at the turbulent close of the Heian Period and lived during the Kamakura Period. Shinran was a pupil of H≈çnen and the founder of what ultimately became the J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ sect in Japan. Names Shinran's birthname was Matsuwakamaro. In accordance with Japanese customs, he has also gone by other names, including Hanen, Shakku and Zenshin, and then finally to Shinran, which was derived by combining the names of Seshin (Vasubandhu in Japanese) and Donran (Tanluan‚Äôs name in Japanese). His posthumous title was Kenshin Daishi.https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shinran-Japanese-Buddhist- philosopher For a while, Shinran also went by the name Fujii Yoshizane.Young Man Shinran: A Reappraisal of Shinran's life. Takamichi Takshataka, Wilfrid Laurier Press, page 2 After he was disrobed, he called himself Gutoku Shinran, in a self-deprecating manner which means \\"stubble-haired foolish one,\\" to denote his status as \\"neither a monk, nor a layperson\\".  Biography  Statue of Shinran Shonin in Kyoto. Shinran was born on May 21, 1173, to Lord and Lady Arinori, a branch of the Fujiwara clan, and was given the name Matsuwakamaro. Early in Shinran's life his parents both died. In 1181, desperate to know what happens after dying, he entered the Shoren-in temple near present-day Maruyama Park in Kyoto at age 9. He wrote this poem on entering: \\"Like the cherry blossom, the heart planning on tomorrow is ephemeral indeed‚Äîwhat sudden storm may not arise in the middle of the night\\". Acutely aware of his own impermanence, he was desperate to find a solution. He then practiced at Mt. Hiei for the next 20 years of his life. Letters between his wife and daughter indicate that he was a Tendai . According to his own account to his wife Eshinni (whose letters are preserved at the Hongan-ji), in frustration at his own failures as a monk and at obtaining enlightenment, he took a retreat at the temple of Rokkaku-d≈ç. There, while engaged in intense practice, he experienced a vision in which Avalokitesvara appeared to him as Prince Sh≈çtoku, directing Shinran to another disillusioned Tendai monk named H≈çnen.Shinran's Biography Nishi Honganji Homepage In 1201, Shinran met H≈çnen and became his disciple. During his first year under H≈çnen's guidance, at the age of 29, Shinran attained enlightenment, or salvation through Amida's Vow. Though the two only knew each other for a few years, H≈çnen entrusted Shinran with a copy of his secret work, the Senchakush≈´. However his precise status amongst H≈çnen's followers is unclear as in the Seven Article Pledge, signed by H≈çnen's followers in 1204, Shinran's signature appears near the middle among less-intimate disciples. During his time as a disciple of H≈çnen's, Shinran caused a great stir among society by publicly getting married and eating meat. Both practices were strictly forbidden for monks, but Shinran took these drastic steps to show that Amida's salvation is for all people and not just for monks and priests. In 1207, The Buddhist establishment in Kyoto persuaded the military to impose a nembutsu ban, after an incident where two of H≈çnen's most prominent followers were accused of using nembutsu practice as a coverup for sexual liaisons.Bowring, Richard. Religious Traditions of Japan: 500-1600. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005. 247. These two monks were subsequently executed. H≈çnen and Shinran were exiled, with Shinran being defrocked and sent to Echigo Province (contemporary Niigata Prefecture). They never met each other again. H≈çnen would die later in Kyoto in 1212. Although Shinran was critical of the motivations that ultimately led to the exile, and the disruption of H≈çnen's practice community, the exile itself proved to be a critical turning point in Shinran's religious life. Having been stripped of his monastic name, he renamed himself , coming to understand himself as neither monk nor layman. In this period, aristocratic exiles were provided land and seed and were required to take up farming, a measure designed to humiliate and humble them, which brought Shinran into the company of many of the lower social classes. While in exile, Shinran sought to continue the work of H≈çnen and spread the doctrine of salvation through Amida Buddha's compassion, as expressed through the nembutsu practice, however in time his teachings diverged from H≈çnen enough that later followers would use the term J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ or \\"True [Essence of the] Pure Land Sect\\", as opposed to J≈çdo-sh≈´ or \\"Pure Land Sect\\". Shinran married his wife, Eshinni, and had seven children with her. Five years after being exiled in Echigo, in 1211, the nembutsu ban was lifted and Shinran was pardoned though he chose not to return to Kyoto at that time. Instead, Shinran left for an area known as Inada, a small area in Kant≈ç just north of Tokyo. In 1224 Shinran authored his most significant text, Kyogyoshinsho, which is a series of selections and commentaries on Buddhist sutras supporting the new Pure Land Buddhist movement, and establishing a doctrinal lineage with Buddhist thinkers in India and China. In 1234 Shinran left the Kant≈ç area and returned to Kyoto, with his daughter Kakushinni. On returning to Kyoto, Shinran discovered that his eldest son, Zenran (ÂñÑÈ∏û 1217?‚Äì1286?), who remained in Hitachi and Shimotsuke provinces was telling people he received special teachings from Shinran and was otherwise leading people astray. Shinran wrote stern letters to Zenran (frequently addressed by his Buddhist name ) instructing him to cease his activities, but when Zenran refused, Shinran disowned him: Shinran died in Kyoto the year 1263 at the age of 90. Kakushinni was instrumental in maintaining the mausoleum, and passing on his teachings, with her descendants ultimately becoming the Monshu, or head of the Honganji Temples built around the Mausoleum.

According to a letter composed by his wife, Eshinni: H≈çnen's disciples were said to have been largely divided by questions arising from the need for a single invocation (nenbutsu) of Amitabha's name versus many-callings, and thereby emphasis on faith versus practice. Shinran, like H≈çnen's disciple K≈çsai, leaned more toward faith over practice, however he did not advocate the single-recitation teaching. While Shinran's teachings and beliefs were generally consistent with the Pure Land Buddhist movement at the time, he also had idiosyncrasies as well: = Primacy of faith = thumb In any case Shinran, like others in H≈çnen's community, felt that in the age of Dharma Decline, it was no longer possible to achieve enlightenment through traditional monastic practices, and thus one could only rely on the vows of Amitabha Buddha, particular the 18th or \\"Primal Vow\\" and seek rebirth in the Pure Land. In a passage from his magnum opus, the Ky≈çgy≈çshinsh≈ç, he writes of himself: In this passage, Shinran explains that he not only gave up traditional monastic practices to focus on rebirth in the Pure Land, but that in time he eventually gave up on practices related to rebirth in the Pure Land, instead relying solely on faith in the vow of Amitabha Buddha. In the Ky≈çgy≈çshinsh≈ç, third fascicle, Shinran explores the nature of , by describing it as something bestowed by Amitabha Buddha, not arising from the believer. Through this endowment, faith is awakened in a person, and the recitation of the Buddha's name or nembutsu because an expression of praise or gratitude. However, this cannot occur until the believer fully entrusts themselves to Amitabha Buddha, even for a moment. Once this state of faith is bestowed, one is assured of rebirth in the Pure Land, and ultimately enlightenment. Shinran cautions though: Further, once a follower has awakened to this deep faith, one should live life as an expression of gratitude, follow moral conduct and fulfill one's social obligations. As one's faith in Amida deepens, Shinran articulated ten spiritual benefits that develop: Protected by unseen divine beings (myoshu goji), Possessed of the supreme virtue (shitoku gusoku), Having evil turned into good (tenaku jyozen), Protected by all Buddhas (shobutsu gonen), Praised by all Buddhas (shobutsu shyosan), Protected by the Buddha's spiritual light (shinko jogo), Having much joy in mind (shinta kangi), Acknowledging His benevolence and repaying it (chion hotoku), Always practicing the Great Compassion (jyogyo daihi), Entering the Rightly- Established Group (shojyoju ni iru). = Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land = The last three fascicles of the Ky≈çgy≈çshinsh≈ç delve into the nature of Amitabha Buddha and the Pure Land. The Pure Land is treated as a temporary refuge whereby one can attain enlightenment, and then return to this world to lead and teach others as a bodhisattva. Elsewhere, Shinran is quoted in the as saying: On the nature of Amitabha Buddha, Shinran stated that in their true form, both the Buddha and the Pure Land are beyond comprehension, but due to people's ignorance and attachments they can only perceive Amitabha in terms of his physical form described in the sutras, as well as the layout of the Pure Land. If one attains true faith, then upon rebirth in the Pure Land, one can perceive their true form. However, if one's faith is incomplete, or they continue to rely on their own efforts, then they will be reborn in the outer regions of the Pure Land, and will still perceive Amitabha Buddha through physical forms until eventually attaining true faith and proceeding further. Shinran's definition of Amitabha Buddha as the absolute, equating the Pure Land with Nirvana itself, therefore differed somewhat from traditional interpretations of the Pure Land in Buddhist scripture. = Age of Dharma decline = Shinran's interpretation of the final age of the Dharma, was consistent with other Buddhist thinkers of the time. In particular, he drew inspiration from a Chinese Buddhist master named Tao-cho who centuries earlier taught that in the latter age of the Dharma the Pure Land teachings were the most suitable for the capacities of the people of the time. Shinran felt this decline was inevitable that Japan was already 600 years into age of Dharma Decline, and that people were no longer capable of maintaining Buddhist practice, let alone enlightenment. Thus, only the vow of Amitabha Buddha to save all beings could be relied upon. = Other religious practices = Shinran acknowledged the religious practices of Japan outside the Buddhist tradition, including Shinto kami, spirits, divination, astrology, etc., he believed that they were irrelevant in comparison to the power of Amitabha Buddha. He developed a Japanese Buddhist heresiology that constructed other forms of religious practice as equivalent to demon-worship; his followers would later use this equivocation both to enforce proper interpretations of Shinran's thought and to criticize \\"heretical\\" sects of Buddhism such as the Tachikawa-ryu. To this day, omamori, ofuda and other charms are not found in Jodo Shinshu temples.  Statue  Statue of Shinran Shonin, Riverside Drive, New York. A survivor of the bombing at Hiroshima, the statue was brought to New York in 1955 A statue of Shinran Shonin stands in Upper West Side Manhattan, in New York City on Riverside Drive between 105th and 106th Streets, in front of the New York Buddhist Church. The statue depicts Shinran in a peasant hat and sandals, holding a wooden staff, as he peers down at the sidewalk. Although this kind of statue is often found at J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ temples, the statue is notable because it survived the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, standing a little more than a mile from ground zero. It was brought to New York in 1955. The plaque calls the statue \\"a testimonial to the atomic bomb devastation and a symbol of lasting hope for world peace.\\" Ashes On March 14, 2008, what are assumed to be some of the ash remains of Shinran were found in a small wooden statue at the J≈çrakuji temple in Shimogy≈ç-ku, Ky≈çto. The temple was created by Zonkaku (1290‚Äì1373), the son of Kakunyo (1270‚Äì1351), one of Shinran's great grandchildren. Records indicate that Zonkaku inherited the remains of Shinran from Kakunyo. The 24.2 cm wooden statue is identified as being from the middle of the Edo period. The remains were wrapped in paper.

The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution New York: Ballantine Books, 1988. is an island in the Caribbean. It is a special municipality (officially \\"public body\\") of the Netherlands. The island lies in the northern Leeward Islands portion of the West Indies, southeast of the Virgin Islands. Sint Eustatius is immediately to the northwest of Saint Kitts, and to the southeast of Saba. The regional capital is Oranjestad. The island has an area of . Travellers to the island by air arrive through F. D. Roosevelt Airport. Formerly part of the Netherlands Antilles, Sint Eustatius became a special municipality of the Netherlands on 10 October 2010. Together with Bonaire and Saba it forms the BES islands. The name of the island, \\"Sint Eustatius\\", is the Dutch name for Saint Eustace (also spelled Eustachius or Eustathius), a legendary Christian martyr, known in Spanish as San Eustaquio and in Portuguese as Santo Eust√°quio or Santo Eust√°cio. History It is unclear if the island was inhabited by native peoples prior to European colonisation. It is thought that the island was likely seen by Christopher Columbus in 1493. From the first European settlement, in the 17th century until the early 19th century, St. Eustatius changed hands twenty-one times between the Netherlands, Britain and France. In 1636, the chamber of Zeeland of the Dutch West India Company took possession of the island, reported to be uninhabited at the time. In 1678 the islands of St. Eustatius, Sint Maarten and Saba were under the direct command of the Dutch West India Company, with a commander stationed on St. Eustatius to govern all three. At the time, the island was of some importance for the cultivation of tobacco and sugar. =Slave trade and free port= In the 18th century, St. Eustatius' geographical placement in the middle of Danish (Virgin Islands), British (Jamaica, St. Kitts, Barbados, Antigua), French (St. Domingue, Ste. Lucie, Martinique, Guadeloupe) and Spanish (Cuba, Santo Domingo, Puerto Rico) territories‚Äîits large harborage, neutrality and status from 1756 as a free port with no customs duties were all factors in it becoming a major point of transhipment of goods, and a locus for trade in contraband. St. Eustatius's economy flourished under the Dutch by ignoring the monopolistic trade restrictions of the British, French and Spanish islands; it became known as The Golden Rock. Edmund Burke said of the island in 1781: :It has no produce, no fortifications for its defence, nor martial spirit nor military regulations ... Its utility was its defence. The universality of its use, the neutrality of its nature was its security and its safeguard. Its proprietors had, in the spirit of commerce, made it an emporium for all the world. ... Its wealth was prodigious, arising from its industry and the nature of its commerce. =\\"First Salute\\"= Johannes de Graaff The island sold arms and ammunition to anyone willing to pay, and it was therefore one of the few places from which the young United States could obtain military stores. The good relationship between St. Eustatius and the United States resulted in the noted \\"First Salute\\". On November 16, 1776, the 14-gun American brig Andrew Doria commanded by Captain Isaiah Robinson sailed, flying the Continental Colors of the fledgling United States, into the anchorage below St. Eustatius' Fort Oranje. Robinson announced his arrival by firing a thirteen gun salute, one gun for each of the thirteen American colonies in rebellion against Britain. Governor Johannes de Graaff replied with an eleven-gun salute from the cannons of Fort Oranje (international protocol required two guns fewer to acknowledge a sovereign flag). It was the first international acknowledgment of American independence.The first salute to the Colors may have occurred one month earlier. It is debatable if a Colonial merchantman received a formal salute from Fort Frederik on the Danish island of St Croix (The birth of our Flag page 13 published 1921) and (Americas Library) Translated from the Danish Wikipedia article on Frederiksted \\"Frederiksted is a town on St Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands which were previously the Danish West Indies. .. The town is dominated by the red and white Fort Frederik from the 1750s. The fort has special meaning to both USA and Denmark-Norway. It was from here that the first foreign salute of recognition of USA independence was given in 1776.\\" The Andrew Doria had arrived to purchase munitions for the American Revolutionary forces. She was carrying a copy of the Declaration of Independence which was presented to Governor De Graaff. An earlier copy had been captured by the British on its way to Holland. It was wrapped in documents that the British believed to be a strange cipher, but were actually written in Yiddish, addressed to Jewish merchants in Holland. U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt visited St. Eustatius for two hours on February 27, 1939 on USS Houston to recognise the importance of the 1776 \\"First Salute\\". He presented a large brass plaque to St. Eustatius, displayed today under a flagpole atop the walls of Fort Oranje, reading: :\\"In commemoration to the salute to the flag of the United States, Fired in this fort November 16. 1776, By order of Johannes de Graaff, Governor of Saint Eustatius, In reply to a National Gun-Salute, Fired by the United States Brig of War Andrew Doria, Under Captain Isaiah Robinson of the Continental Navy, Here the sovereignty of the United States of America was first formally acknowledged to a national vessel by a foreign official. Presented by Franklin Delano Roosevelt, President of the United States of America\\" The recognition provided the title for Barbara W. Tuchman's 1988 book The First Salute: A View of the American Revolution. The British took the Andrew Doria incident seriously, and protested bitterly against the continuous trade between the United Colonies and St. Eustatius. In 1778, Lord Stormont claimed in Parliament that, \\"if Sint Eustatius had sunk into the sea three years before, the United Kingdom would already have dealt with George Washington\\". Nearly half of all American Revolutionary military supplies were obtained through St. Eustatius. Nearly all American communications to Europe first passed through the island. The trade between St. Eustatius and the United States was the main reason for the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War of 1780‚Äì1784. For example, the British Admiral George Brydges Rodney, having occupied the island for Great Britain in 1781, urged the commander of the landing troops, Major-General Sir John Vaughan, to seize \\"Mr. Smith at the house of Jones - they (the Jews of St. Eustatius, Caribbean Antilles) cannot be too soon taken care of - they are notorious in the cause of America and France.\\" The war was disastrous for the Dutch economy. Rodney's sailors and troops pillaged the island. Britain declared war on the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands on December 20, 1780. Even before officially declaring war, Britain had outfitted a massive battle fleet to take and destroy the weapons depot and vital commercial centre that St. Eustatius had become. British Admiral George Brydges Rodney was appointed the commander of the battle fleet. February 3, 1781, the massive fleet of 15 ships of the line and numerous smaller ships transporting over 3,000 soldiers appeared before St. Eustatius prepared to invade. Governor De Graaff did not know about the declaration of war. Rodney offered De Graaff a bloodless surrender to his superior force. Rodney had over 1,000 cannon to De Graaff's one dozen cannon and a garrison of sixty men. De Graaff surrendered the island, but first fired two rounds as a show of resistance in honour of Dutch Admiral Lodewijk van Bylandt, who commanded a ship of the Dutch Navy which was in the harbor. Ten months later, the island was conquered by the French, allies of the Dutch Republic in the war. The Dutch regained control over the looted and plundered island in 1784. At its peak, St. Eustatius may have had a largely transient population of about 10,000 people. Most were engaged in commercial and maritime interests. A census list of 1790 gives a total population (free and enslaved people combined) of 8,124. Commerce revived after the British left. Many of the merchants (including the Jews) returned to the island. However, French and British occupations from 1795 disrupted trade and also the North- Americans, now globally recognised as an independent nation, had meanwhile developed their own trading network and did not need St. Eustatius anymore. The island was eclipsed by other Dutch ports, such as those on the islands of Cura√ßao and Sint Maarten. During the last years of the 18th century Statia developed trade in bay rum. The economy declined in the early 19th century. From about 1795 the population declined, dropping to 921 in 1948. =Jewish population= The first record of Jews on St. Eustatius dates to 1660. The Jews were mainly merchants with significant international trading and maritime commercial ties. Jews were captains, owners or co-owners with Christian partners, of significant numbers of ships originating out of St. Eustatius. A few were island plantation owners. Jews were estimated to have comprised at least 10% of the permanent population of St. Eustatius. Source covers growing Jewish population, but gives no numbers. Ten days after the island surrendered to the British on 3 February 1781, Rodney ordered that the entire Jewish male adult population assemble for him. They were rounded up and thirty one heads of families were summarily deported to St. Kitts without word or mercy to their dependents. The choice of exiling the Jews to St. Kitts was significant. The nearby British Island of Nevis had a large Jewish population and an established community capable of aiding the refugees. St. Kitts did not have any Jewish community or population. The other seventy-one were locked up in the weighing house in Lower Town where they were held for three days. Expulsion of Americans followed on 23 February, of merchants from Amsterdam on 24 February and of other Dutch citizens and Frenchmen on 5 March. The crews of the Dutch ships Rodney took were sent to St. Kitts for imprisonment - after first stripping them of all their belongings. Because of their maltreatment, many perished. The Jews were well received on St. Kitts - where many knew them as their respected business partners. They were supported in their protest against their deportation and it proved successful. They were allowed to return to St. Eustatius after a few weeks to observe all their property being sold at small fractions of the original value after having been confiscated by Rodney. The resentment the British felt for the population of this island that helped the Americans to defeat them translated in a harsh treatment of the inhabitants. There were numerous complaints about \\"individuals of both sexes being halted in the streets and being body searched in a most scandalous way.\\"West Indisch Plakaatboek, Amsterdam 1979 Pieter Runnels, an eighty-year- old member of the island council and captain of the civic guard, did not survive the rough treatment he received aboard Rodney's ship. He, a member of one of the island's oldest-established families, became the only civilian casualty of the British occupation. British soldiers prevented the family and others paying their last respects at his funeral from using the water from the family's own cistern. The tomb of former governor Jan de Windt was broken open by British soldiers, all the silver decorations stolen off the caskets, and the bodies of the governor and his wife exposed, without any of Rodney's officers interfering. Rodney singled out the Jews: the harshness was reserved for them alone. He did not do the same to French, Dutch, Spanish or even the American merchants on the island. He permitted the French to leave with all their possessions. Rodney was concerned that his unprecedented behavior would be repeated upon British islands by French forces when events were different. However, Governor De Graaff was also deported. As he did with all other warehouses, Rodney confiscated the Jewish warehouses, looted Jewish personal possessions, even cutting the lining of their clothes to find money hidden in there. When Rodney realized that the Jews might be hiding additional treasure, he dug up the Jewish cemetery.Norton, Louis Arthur. \\"Retribution: Admiral Rodney and the Jews of St. Eustatius\\" Jewish Magazine (October 2006) Later, in February 1782, Edmund Burke, the leading opposition member of the Whig Party, upon learning of Rodney's actions in St. Eustatius, rose to condemn Rodney's anti-Semitic, avaricious vindictiveness in Parliament: > \\"...and a sentence of general beggary pronounced in one moment upon a whole > people. A cruelty unheard of in Europe for many years‚Ä¶ The persecution was > begun with the people whom of all others it ought to be the care and the > wish of human nations to protect, the Jews‚Ä¶ the links of communication, the > mercantile chain‚Ä¶ the conductors by which credit was transmitted through the > world‚Ä¶a resolution taken (by the British conquerors) to banish this unhappy > people from the island. They suffered in common with the rest of the > inhabitants, the loss of their merchandise, their bills, their houses, and > their provisions; and after this they were ordered to quit the island, and > only one day was given them for preparation; they petitioned, they > remonstrated against so hard a sentence, but in vain; it was irrevocable.\\" > EDMUND BURKE, THE ATLANTIC AMERICAN WAR AND THE \\"POOR JEWS AT ST. > EUSTATIUS\\". EMPIRE AND THE LAW OF NATIONS, Guido Abbattista The synagogue and the cemetery The restored and stabilized walls of the 1737 synagogue From about 1815, when there was no longer a viable Jewish community using and maintaining the synagogue on St. Eustatius, it gradually fell into ruin. The synagogue building, known as Honen Dalim, (He who is charitable to the Poor) was constructed in 1737. Permission for building the synagogue came from the Dutch West India Company, additional funding came from the Jewish community on Cura√ßao. Permission was conditional on the fact that the Jewish house of worship would be sited where \\"the exercise of their (Jewish) religious duties would not molest those of the Gentiles\\".The Jewish Nation of the Caribbean, Mordechai Arbell, Geffen Press, 2002 The building is located off a small lane called Synagogue Path, away from the main street. The synagogue attested to the wealth of the Jews of St. Eustatius and their influence on the island. The Jewish cemetery In 2001 its walls were restored as part of the Historic Core Restoration Project, although there are no known images showing what the synagogue looked like when still in use, so that archeological research is attempting to restore the structure to the best estimate of its former condition. The grounds include a Jewish ritual bath (mikveh) and an oven used on Passover. A restored and respectfully maintained Jewish cemetery is located adjacent to the Old Church Cemetery, at the top of Oranjestad, Sint Eustatius. = Rodney's delayed departure, 1781 = The wealth Rodney and General Vaughan discovered on St. Eustatius exceeded their expectations. There were 130 merchantmen in the bay as well as the Dutch frigate and five smaller American armed merchantmen. In total the value of goods seized, including a very rich Dutch convoy captured off Sombrero, was estimated to be well in excess of ¬£3 million.Trew p.103-104 On 5 February 1781 Rodney and Vaughan signed an agreement stating that all goods taken belonged to the Crown.Trew p.106 Rodney and Vaughan, by British custom, expected to personally receive a significant share of the captured wealth from the King once it reached England. Instead of delegating the task of sorting through and estimating the value of the confiscated property Rodney and Vaughan delayed their departure and oversaw this themselves. Rodney, privately, wrote to his family with promises of a new London home. To his daughter he promised \\"the best harpsichord money can purchase\\". He confidently wrote of a marriage settlement for one of his sons and a soon-to-be-purchased commission in the Foot Guards for another son. He wrote of a dowry for his daughter to marry the Earl of Oxford. He noted he would have enough to pay off the young prospective bridegroom's debts. The excessive amount of time Rodney spent on St. Eustatius led to allegations that Rodney and Vaughan had neglected their military duties. In particular, Viscount Samuel Hood suggested that Rodney should have sailed to intercept a French fleet under Lieutenant g√©n√©ral de Grasse, traveling to Martinique.Trew p.104-105 The French fleet instead turned north and headed for the Chesapeake Bay. Battle of the Capes Rodney's delay at St. Eustatius was not the first time he had taken the opportunity to capture prizes over the immediate and expeditious fulfilment of his military duties. During the Seven Years' War of 1756-1763, Rodney had delayed transporting Major General Jeffrey Amherst in order to pursue prizes. Later, Rodney had been ordered to Barbados to link up with Admiral Sir George Peacock and the Earl of Albemarle for an attack on Cuba. Instead, Rodney sent valuable ships off in search of prizes. In 1762, after the fall of Martinique, Rodney quarrelled with the army over prize-money. During Rodney's command in Jamaica (1771&-1774) the Earl of Sandwich feared that Rodney might provoke a war with Spain to obtain prize money.Rodney, Spinney, pgs. 141, 201-202,206,255 Rodney further weakened his fleet earlier by sending a strong defending force to England to accompany his treasure ships. After months on St. Eustatius, capturing additional merchants and treasure, Rodney was prevailed upon to send part of his fleet north to aid General Cornwallis and British armed forces fighting the Americans. He did not dispatch the bulk of his fleet from St. Eustatius until July/August 1781. The ships arrived too late to affect the events that were taking place in North America. Surrender of the British to George Washington at Yorktown, Virginia (19 October 1781) Outside of the Chesapeake Bay, a much stronger combined French fleet under Grasse defeated the weakened British fleet (5 September 1781). The battle between Grasse and Rear Admiral Sir Thomas Graves became known as the Battle of the Chesapeake or the Battle of the Capes, one of the most pivotal battles in history. British General Cornwallis, trapped at Yorktown, Virginia, desperately awaited much- needed supplies and men that Rodney would have brought. American General George Washington, with French siege-artillery and supporting forces, closed the vise from the land side. Cornwallis could not be aided from the sea because of the British naval defeat. The French controlled the Bay. Cornwallis' predicament linked directly to Rodney's failure to depart St. Eustatius promptly following its capture and the destruction of the military stores there. Cornwallis had no choice, and surrendered on 19 October 1781; the American Revolutionary war was over, and the Americans had won, partially due to Rodney's anti-Semitic and avaricious delays.The Men Who Lost American, Andrew Jackson O'Shaunhassey, Yale, 2013 A series of disastrous French and British occupations of Sint Eustatius from 1795 to 1815 diverted trade to the occupiers' islands. St. Eustatius' economy collapsed, and the merchants, including the Jews left. St. Eustatius reverted permanently to Dutch control from 1816. =Slave Revolt of 1848= After 1848, slavery only existed on the Dutch and Danish Caribbean islands, which caused unrest on the islands colonized by the Netherlands. As a result, a proclamation declared on June 6, 1848 on Sint Maarten that enslaved Africans would be treated as free persons . Unrest also arose on Sint Eustatius. On June 12, 1848, a group of free and enslaved Africans gathered in front of Lieutenant Governor Johannes de Veer's home demanding their declaration of liberty, increased rations, and more free hours. The Island Governor addressed the group, but it persisted in its demands. The militia was mobilized and, after consultation with the Colonial Council and the main residents, an attack was decided by the Lieutenant Governor. After another warning to leave the city or otherwise experience the consequences, fire was opened on the group. The insurgents fled the city, leaving two or three seriously injured. From a hill just outside the city they pelted the militia with stones and pieces of rock. A group of 35 shooters stormed the hill, killing two insurgents and injuring several. The six leaders of the uprising were exiled from the island and transferred to Cura√ßao. Thomas Dupersoy, a free African, is considered the chief leader of the uprising. One of the other leaders sent a death notice to his ‚Äúowner‚Äù in 1851. After the uprising, the largest plantation owners on Sint Eustatius decided to give their enslaved workers a certain wage for fear of repetition of revolt. =Abolition of slavery= In 1863 slavery was officially abolished in the Netherlands. The Dutch were among the last to abolish slavery. The freed slaves no longer wanted to live in the field and moved to the city. Due to a lack of trade, the bay of Sint Eustatius underwent a recession. Natural disasters such as the hurricane of September 1928 and May 1929 accelerated the process of economic decline on the island. =Dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles= Sint Eustatius became a member of the Netherlands Antilles when that grouping was created in 1954. Between 2000 and 2005 the member islands of the Netherlands Antilles voted on their future status. In a referendum on 8 April 2005, 77% of Sint Eustatius voters voted to remain within the Netherlands Antilles, compared to 21% who voted for closer ties with the Netherlands. None of the other islands voted to remain. After the other islands decided to leave, ending the Netherlands Antilles, the island council opted to become a special municipality of the Netherlands, like Saba and Bonaire. This process was completed in 2010. In 2011 the island officially adopted the US dollar as its currency. Geography Sint Eustatius as photographed from the International Space Station Quill, St. Eustatius' dormant volcano, and over the water in the distance, the northern end of the island of St. Kitts Sint Eustatius is 6 miles (10 km) long and up to 3 miles (5 km) wide. Topographically, the island is saddle-shaped, with the 602 meter- high dormant volcano Quill (Mount Mazinga), (from Dutch kuil, meaning 'pit'‚Äîoriginally referring to its crater) to the southeast and the smaller summits of Signal Hill/Little Mountain (or Bergje) and Boven Mountain to the northwest. The Quill crater is a popular tourist attraction on the island. The bulk of the island's population lives in the flat saddle between the two elevated areas, which forms the centre of the island. =Climate= St. Eustatius has a tropical monsoon climate. Tropical storms and hurricanes are common. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to November 30, sharply peaking from late August through September. =Nature= As St. Eustatius is a volcanic island and very small, all of the beaches on the island are made up of black volcanic sand. These volcanic sands, especially one of the more popular nesting beaches called Zeelandia, are very important nesting sites for several endangered sea turtles such as: the green turtle, leatherback, loggerhead and hawksbill. =National parks= Sint Eustatius has three nature parks - on land and at sea: the Sint Eustatius National Marine Park, Quill/Boven National Park, and Miriam Schmidt Botanical Garden. Two of them have national park status. These areas have been designated as important bird areas. The nature parks are maintained by the St Eustatius National Parks Foundation (STENAPA). Zeelandia Beach Demography =Population= As of January 2019, the population is 3,138, with a population density of 150 inhabitants per square kilometre. =Language= The official language is Dutch, but English is the \\"language of everyday life\\" on the island and education is solely in English.English to be sole language of instruction in St Eustatian schools. Government of the Netherlands. 19 June 2014. Retrieved 20 February 2015. A local English-based creole is also spoken informally. More than 52% of the population speak more than one language. The most widely spoken languages are English (92.7%), Dutch (36%), Spanish (33.8%) and Papiamento (20.8%). =Religion= Sint Eustatius is predominantly a Christian territory. The main denominations are Methodist 28.6%, Catholics 23.7%, Adventist 17.8%, Pentecostal 7.2% and Anglicans 2.6%. Catholic church in Sint Eustatius Economy Ruins of numerous warehouses on Oranje Bay In the 18th century, \\"Statia\\" was the most important Dutch island in the Caribbean and was a center of great wealth from trading. At this time it was known as the \\"Golden Rock\\" because of its immense wealth. A very large number of warehouses lined the road that runs along Oranje Bay; most (but not all) of these warehouses are now ruined and some of the ruins are partially underwater. A French occupation in 1795 was the beginning of the end of great prosperity for Sint Eustatius. According to the Sint Eustatius government website, \\"Statia's economy is stable and well placed to grow in the near future. With practically no unemployment and a skilled workforce, we have a infrastructure in place to ensure sustained growth.\\"\\"Economy,\\" statiagovernment.com, accessed 15 December 2012. The government itself is the largest employer on the island, and the oil terminal owned by NuStar Energy is the largest private employer on the island.\\"Economy,\\" rijksdienstcn.com, accessed 22 April 2014. = Energy and water = The solar park on Sint Eustatius in 2016 Statia Utility Company N.V. provides electricity to the island, as well as drinking water per truck and on part of the island by a water network. The electricity supply is rapidly being made green. Until 2016 all electricity was produced by diesel generators. In March 2016 the first phase of the solar park with 1.89 MWp capacity became operational, covering 23% of entire electricity demand. In November 2017 Artikel in dagblad Trouw, 3 november 2017 another 2.15 MWp was added, totaling 14,345 solar panels, with 4.1 MW capacity and a yearly production of 6.4 GWh. The solar park includes lithium ion batteries of 5.9 MWh size. These provide power for grid stability, as well as energy shifting. On a sunny day the diesel generators are switched off from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. This is made possible by grid forming inverters produced by SMA. This is one of the first such solar parks in the world, and provides 40% to 50% of the island's electricity. Education Dutch government policy towards St. Eustatius and other SSS islands promoted English medium education. Sint Eustatius has bilingual English-Dutch education.Dijkhoff, Marta, Silvia Kowenberg, and Paul Tjon Sie Fat.

Sports The most popular sports on Sint Eustatius are football, futsal, softball, basketball, swimming and volleyball. Due to the small population, there are few sport associations. One of them, the Sint Eustatius Volleyball Association, is a member of ECVA and NORCECA. Currently St. Eustatius is a non-active member of the Caribbean zone of Pony Baseball and Softball leagues.

Beginning at the I-85/Langford Parkway interchange, the Downtown Connector runs generally due north, meeting the west‚Äìeast I-20 in the middle. Just north of this is the Grady Curve around Grady Memorial Hospital. Continuing north, the terminus of the Downtown Connector is the Brookwood Interchange or Brookwood Split in the Brookwood area of the city. The overall length of the Downtown Connector is approximately . Since the 2000s, it has been officially named James Wendell George Parkway for most of its length, although it is still designated the Connector in the mainstream. It also has unsigned designations State Route 401 (I-75) and State Route 403 (I-85) along its length, due to I-75 and I-85 having 400-series reference numbers. History The Downtown Connector had its origins in the city's original system of expressways, construction of which began in the early 1950s with the Northeast Expressway and the South Expressway. Construction of the \\"connector\\" between the two, which was numbered State Route 295, Accessed January 23, 2007 and was slated to carry US 19/US 41 at one point, was not completed until the early 1960s.http://www.geocities.com/garoadwarrior76/SR295_1956 Accessed January 23, 2007 110px Initial construction of the highway displaced parts of Techwood Drive and Williams Street in Midtown Atlanta. It also destroyed street grids east and south of downtown, dividing Sweet Auburn in two and the interchange with I-20 leveling the northern part of the Washington-Rawson district. The proposed I-485 was originally planned by the Georgia Department of Transportation to carry some south‚Äìnorth traffic through the eastern side of the city, but most of this was canceled in the 1970s by the then-governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter (parts of that road are now I-675 and SR 400). The highway was heavily reconstructed during the 1980s as part of GDOT's Freeing the Freeways program to widen Atlanta-area freeways, with most of the Connector's width being doubled from three to six or seven lanes in each direction. \\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,968392,00.html\\" The project included work to increase lanes from six to eight on I-20, I-75, I-85, and I-285 (\\"The Perimeter\\"), as well as ten lanes on the downtown connector, involving 126 total miles and was phased over 13 years between 1976 and 1988. The improvement campaign also included elimination of sharp curves and grades, left-hand exits, excessive interchanges, and short acceleration/deceleration lanes. So as to offer a bypass around construction through the center of the city, the perimeter road (I-285) was completed first. The radiating expressways were then upgraded, and the last phase was reconstruction of the depressed sections through downtown Atlanta. By June 1983, some $252 million in discretionary funds had been used to complete most of the highways save for some major interchanges and the downtown section. The eight miles of the downtown section, which includes the 4.4-mile long downtown connector, was the most complicated section of the entire reconstruction. Work was started on it in 1984, and it included redesigning the massive interchange between I-20 and I-75/85 at Memorial Drive where much of the mileage was on structure. The downtown connector was to be widened to ten lanes, and this required quite a bit of right of way acquisition. Many bridges, including the 55 over the connector portion alone, had to be designed and built. In addition to the general-purpose lanes, provisions for high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes and dedicated on-ramps at Williams Street, Piedmont Avenue, and Memorial Drive were built, and were subsequently converted to HOV usage in 1996. Between 2000 and 2004, the six-lane wide 17th Street Bridge was constructed over the Brookwood Interchange, connecting Midtown Atlanta with the then-new Atlantic Station development. In 2008, reconstruction of the 14th Street Bridge took place in order to accommodate increased traffic flow and pedestrian amenities. This work also included the construction of two new off-ramps: a southbound ramp to 10th Street, and a northbound ramp to 17th Street. This work was completed on May 28, 2010. In early January 2010, a section of the highway between 14th and 17th streets developed an unusual problem dubbed \\"phantom ice\\" during a prolonged cold wave that kept temperatures below freezing for several days in the Atlanta region. GDOT engineers believe that heavy rain in previous months raised the water table and caused it to seep upward through joints between lanes, where it subsequently froze. Commuter traffic was stopped briefly on at least two days in order to treat it with deicing materials and inspect the freeway to determine the cause. In January 2016, GDOT started a study of the Downtown Connector. Citing high levels of congestion that occur outside of peak periods, the purpose of the study is to gather data and explore options for reducing congestion. Data collection took place all year in 2016, and the data is being analyzed and options evaluated throughout 2017 and 2018. The study is expected to be completed in 2019. The study has already released their data on their website, including nine \\"Hot Spots\\", or dangerous and congested points that could most benefit from design improvements, and a detailed analysis of traffic in the whole metro area and how it relates to traffic on the Downtown Connector. = The Stitch = In August 2016, Central Atlanta Progress announced plans to cover the Downtown Connector, converting it to a subterranean roadway and building a series of greenspaces on top of the road, similar to Klyde Warren Park in Dallas. This project was drafted by Jacobs Engineering Group and is called \\"The Stitch\\", as one of the intents of the project would be to \\"stitch\\" together roads that had been divided with the creation of the Downtown Connector. As of 2019, the project was still in the pre-construction phase, with an estimated timeline and budget of ten years and $452 million, respectively. Features The Downtown Connector carries more than 437,000 vehicles per day at its busiest point ‚Äî just south of 10th Street in Midtown, while the least traveled portion carries 243,000 vehicles per day ‚Äî just south of Fulton Street, near the interchange with Interstate 20. The area around the connector and associated interchanges are considered one of the ten-most congested stretches of interstate in the U.S. Due to this fact, many motorists often compare Atlanta to Los Angeles, which is also known for its notoriously-congested freeway system. The highway is fully instrumented with Intelligent transportation system (ITS) devices. There are more than 25 closed-circuit television cameras between the Langford Parkway interchange (south end) and the Brookwood Interchange (north end). Additionally, the Downtown Connector has three large overhead electronic message signs, and four smaller HOV-dedicated message signs on the median barrier wall. Traffic flow data is gathered through a video detection system, using pole-mounted black-and-white cameras spaced every on both sides of the roadway. All video and data is fed into the GDOT's Transportation Management Center (TMC), via fiber optic cable located under the shoulders of the roadway. Virtually all entrance ramps are metered, with the exception of the freeway-to-freeway connection ramps from I-20. Atlanta's skyline, both Downtown and Midtown, can be seen from the highway, especially at the northern and southern ends.

During his reign, the nobility essentially ruled the country. Dying childless, Louis V was the last Carolingian monarch in West Francia. Youth Louis was born . He was the eldest son of King Lothair of France, the Carolingian ruler of France, and Queen Emma, daughter of King Lothair II of Italy and Empress Adelaide. Louis was associated to the government by his father in 978 and crowned co-king on 8 June 979 at the Abbey of Saint-Corneille in Compi√®gne by Archbishop Adalbero of Reims.Jim Bradbury,The Capetians: Kings of France, 987-1328 (London: Hambledon Continuum, 2007), p. 45 Marriage In 982 at Vieille-Brioude, Haute-Loire, the fifteen year old Louis was married to the forty-year-old Adelaide-Blanche of Anjou, sister of Count Geoffrey I and twice a widow from her previous marriage with Count Stephen of G√©vaudanAccording to Settipani, Stephen was not properly Comte de G√©vaudan, although his descendants by Adelaide-Blance later possessed the counties of G√©vaudan, Brioude and Forez. Christian Settipani: La Pr√©histoire des Cap√©tiens, 1993, p. 336 footnote 996. and Count Raymond of Toulouse, Prince of Gothia. This union was purely political and arranged by the king ‚Äì following the advices of Queen Emma and Count Geoffrey I ‚Äì with the double purpose of restoring the Carolingian royal power in the south of the kingdom, and (according to Richerus) to obtain the support of the local southern lords in his fight against the Robertians: being now related by marriage to two of the most powerful southern comital families of the Kingdom, Lothair believed that he could confront the power of Hugh Capet. Immediately after their wedding, Louis and Adelaide-Blanche were crowned king and queen of Aquitaine by Adelaide's brother Bishop Guy of le Puy.Pierre Rich√©, The Carolingians; A Family who Forged Europe, Trans. Michael Idomir Allen (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), p. 265 From the very beginning, however, the mismatched couple was unable to peacefully live together,Bernard S. Bachrach: Fulk Nerra the Neo-Roman Consul, 987-1040, University of California Press, 1993, p. 15. not only due to the notorious age difference between them, but (according to Richerus) also because of Louis' debauched lifestyle: ::[...] They had almost no conjugal love; because Louis had barely reached puberty, and Adelaide was old, there was only incompatibility and disagreements between them. They did not share a common bedroom as they could not bear it; when they had to travel, each took a separate residence, and when they were forced to talk, their conversations were in the open air and were never long, but only lasted for a few words. They lived in this way for two years, until they obtained the divorce for their opposite characters. [...] Louis, who did not have a tutor, indulged himself in all sorts of frivolity due to his young age.Richerus: Historiarum libri quatuor, Acad√©mie imp√©riale de Reims, Reims 1855, Book III, p. 339. In 984, after two years of childless union (and according to Rodulfus Glaber), Adelaide tricked her young husband into making a visit to Aquitaine, and once there, she left him and returned to her family, marrying shortly thereafter Count William I of Provence: ::When the young prince reached adolescence, Lothair made him king and appointed him his successor; he also chose for him a princess of Aquitaine as his wife, but soon she perceived that the young man would not inherit the talents of his father. Therefore she decided to separate from her husband; and for this purpose she adroitly convinced him to make a trip to her province of Aquitaine, assuming that her hereditary rights there guaranteed her the possession of the land. Louis, without suspecting the artifice, yielded to the advice of his wife, and went with her. When they were in Aquitaine, she left her husband to join her family.Rodulfus Glaber: Collection des m√©moires de France par M. Guizot, Paris 1824, Book I, chapter III, parts 180 and 181. However, despite being recorded by relative contemporary and later sources (Richerus, Rodulfus Glaber, the Chronicon Andegavensi and the Chronicle of Saint-Maxence, among others), the existence of this marriage was recently challenged by historian Carlrichard Br√ºlh.Carlrichard Br√ºlh: Naissance de deux peuples, Fran√ßais et Allemands (10th‚Äë11th si√®cle), Fayard, August 1996, p. 248. Reign Carolingian ruled lands (in yellow) formed a small part of West Francia by the 10th century Upon his father's death on 2 March 986, the already-crowned Louis V became the undisputed king of the Franks. At that time, however, there existed in the Frankish court two factions: one led by Archbishop Adalberon of Reims and Queen Emma, who, being strongly influenced by her mother Empress Adelaide, wanted the renewal of friendly relationships with the Ottonian dynasty; the other faction wanted to continue Lothair's policy, and taking advantage of the minority of Emperor Otto III, wanted a policy of expansion to the east and the recovery of Lotharingia. In addition, the young monarch inherited a battle between his father's line of elected kings (which had been interrupted twice by Robertians and once by the Bosonids), and the Ottonian house of Emperor Otto I. As defender of Rome, Otto I had the power to name the clergy in Carolingian territory, and the clergy he had named were not supporting the Carolingians. Initially, Queen Emma dominated the situation, but in the summer of 986 there was a reversal: the Anti-Ottonian party prevailed, after which she was forced to leave court and seek refuge with Hugh Capet. This event also put Adalberon in a predicament: having been elevated by Otto I to the powerful Archbishopric of Reims, he was forced to leave his episcopal seat and took refuge in one of his fortresses on the Meuse river, who belonged to the Ottonian sphere. The escape of the archbishop was perceived by Louis V as treason; he turned violently against Adalberon and threatened him with a siege of Reims. The matter was finally settled in a trial court at Compi√®gne. Before this meeting, however, Louis V changed his mind and sought a reconciliation with Adalberon, and so in the spring of 987, he planned a peace meeting with Empress Theophanu, who acted on behalf of her son Otto III. Before all these tangled events were resolved, Louis V died on 21 May 987Detlev Schwennicke, Europ√§ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ√§ischen Staaten, Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 1 (Marburg, Germany: Verlag von J.

Michael Idomir Allen (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1993), p. 277 He was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Corneille in Compi√®gne. Louis V left no legitimate heirs, so his uncle Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, was nominated as the hereditary successor to the throne. But the clergy, including both Adalberon and Gerbert (who later became Pope Sylvester II), argued eloquently for the election of Hugh Capet, who was not only of royal blood but had proven himself through his actions and his military might. Hugh was elected to the Frankish throne and Adalberon crowned him, all within two months of Louis V's death. Thus the rule of the Carolingian dynasty ended and the Capetian era had begun.

Frequently, the exemption is limited; it may extend for a set time, or it may be lost under certain circumstances.

Often, such a provision is used as a compromise or out of practicality, to allow new rules to be enacted without upsetting a well- established logistical or political situation. This extends the idea of a rule not being retroactively applied. The term originated in late nineteenth- century legislation and constitutional amendments passed by a number of U.S. Southern states, which created new requirements for literacy tests, payment of poll taxes, and/or residency and property restrictions to register to vote. States in some cases exempted those whose ancestors (grandfathers) had the right to vote before the American Civil War, or as of a particular date, from such requirements. The intent and effect of such rules was to prevent African- American former slaves and their descendants from voting, but without denying poor and illiterate whites the right to vote. Although these original grandfather clauses were eventually ruled unconstitutional, the terms grandfather clause and grandfather have been adapted to other uses. Origin The original grandfather clauses were contained in new state constitutions and Jim Crow laws passed between 1890 and 1908 by white-dominated state legislatures including Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Virginia. They restricted voter registration, effectively preventing African Americans from voting. Racial restrictions on voting in place before 1870 were nullified by the Fifteenth Amendment. After Democrats took control of state legislatures again after the Compromise of 1877, they began to work to restrict the ability of blacks to vote. Paramilitary groups such as the White League, Red Shirts, and rifle clubs had intimidated blacks or barred them from the polls in numerous elections before what they called the Redemption (restoration of white supremacy). Nonetheless, a coalition of Populists and Republicans in fusion tickets in the 1880s and 1890s gained some seats and won some governor positions. To prevent such coalitions in the future, the Democrats wanted to exclude freedmen and other blacks from voting; in some states they also restricted poor whites to avoid biracial coalitions. White Democrats developed statutes and passed new constitutions creating restrictive voter registration rules. Examples included imposition of poll taxes and residency and literacy tests. An exemption to such requirements was made for all persons allowed to vote before the American Civil War, and any of their descendants. The term grandfather clause arose from the fact that the laws tied the then-current generation's voting rights to those of their grandfathers. According to Black's Law Dictionary, some Southern states adopted constitutional provisions exempting from the literacy requirements descendants of those who fought in the army or navy of the United States or of the Confederate States during a time of war. After the U.S. Supreme Court found such provisions unconstitutional in Guinn v. United States (1915), states were forced to stop using the grandfather clauses to provide exemption to literacy tests. Without the grandfather clauses, tens of thousands of poor Southern whites were disenfranchised in the early 20th century. As decades passed, Southern states tended to expand the franchise for poor whites, but most blacks could not vote until after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Ratification in 1964 of the Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited the use of poll taxes in federal elections, but some states continued to use them in state elections. The 1965 Voting Rights Act had provisions to protect voter registration and access to elections, with federal enforcement and supervision where necessary. In 1966, the Supreme Court ruled in Harper v. Virginia Board of Elections that poll taxes could not be used in any elections. This secured the franchise for most citizens, and voter registration and turnout climbed dramatically in Southern states. There is also a rather different, older type of grandfather clause, perhaps more properly a grandfather principle in which a government blots out transactions of the recent past, usually those of a predecessor government. The modern analogue may be repudiating public debt, but the original was Henry II's principle, preserved in many of his judgments, \\"Let it be as it was on the day of my grandfather's death\\", a principle by which he repudiated all the royal grants that had been made in the previous 19 years under King Stephen. Modern examples =Technology= * Most cellular phone carriers including AT&T; and Verizon had an unlimited data plan in the past, but these plans were removed. Customers who already had unlimited data plans could continue to have them for as long as they kept the same service. For new subscribers, the unlimited plan was no longer available and they had to select from a limited plan (usually 2‚Äì4 GB) with extra charges and fees for going over the limit. * Tablet computers (and similar devices) with screen sizes below eight inches which ran Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1 featured a traditional Windows desktop with legacy app support, alongside the ability to run the newer Metro- style apps. However, newer devices with sub-8-inch screens that ran the successor Windows 10 Mobile operating system had no legacy app capability, and, as such, could only run apps downloaded from the Windows Store. Most (if not all) owners of the older Windows 8 devices of that screen size class who upgrade to Windows 10 can still retain the old-style desktop and legacy app support, despite this upgrade. * Sirius XM Satellite Radio lifetime subscriptions are no longer being offered to new subscribers. Sirius XM Satellite Radio still honors lifetime subscriptions to people who have bought them in the past, under certain conditions.listenercare.siriusxm.com , Can I transfer my Lifetime subscription to a new radio? =Law= * Many jurisdictions prohibit ex post facto laws, and grandfather clauses can be used to prevent a law from having retroactive effects. For example, in the UK the offence of indecent assault is still charged in respect of crimes committed before the offence was abolished and replaced with sexual assault (among others) by the Sexual Offences Act 2003. * Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution appears on a cursory reading to stipulate that presidential candidates must be natural born citizens of the United States. However, there is a further category of persons eligible for that office, now exhausted: those who were citizens of the United States at the time of the adoption of that constitution. Without that provision, it would have required a strained reading to construe that all actual presidents born in the colonial era were born in the United States, because the United States did not exist prior to July 4, 1776, the date on which the Declaration of Independence was adopted. * Many acts requiring registration to practice a particular profession incorporated transition or \\"grandfather sections\\" allowing those who had already practised for a specified time (often three or four years) to be registered under the act even if they did not have the training or qualifications required for new applications for registration. Examples are the Nurses Registration Act 1901 in New Zealand and the Nurses Registration Act 1919 in England and Wales. * In 1949, standards were passed requiring certain fire safety improvements in schools. However, older schools, such as the Our Lady of the Angels School in Illinois, were not required to be retrofitted to meet the requirements, leading to the deadly Our Lady of the Angels School fire in which 92 students and 3 teachers died. * In 1951, the United States ratified the Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution, preventing presidents from running for more than two full terms (or one full term, if they had served more than two years of another person's term). The text of the amendment specifically excluded the sitting president from its provisions, thus making Harry Truman eligible to run for president in 1952‚Äîand, theoretically, for every subsequent presidential election thereafter‚Äîeven though he had served a full term and almost four years of a previous president's term. Truman was highly unpopular and lost the New Hampshire primary by nearly 55% to 44%. Eighteen days later the president announced he would not seek a second full term. * In the 1980s, as states in America were increasing the permitted age of drinking to 21 years, many people who were under 21 but of legal drinking age before the change were still permitted to purchase and drink alcoholic beverages. Similar conditions applied when New Jersey and certain counties in New York raised tobacco purchase ages from 18 to 19 years in the early 2000s. * In 2012, Macau increased the permitted age of entering casinos to 21. However, casino employees between the ages of 18 and 21 before the change were still permitted to enter their places of employment. This category was exhausted by the end of 2015. * During the Federal Assault Weapons Ban, certain firearms made before the ban's enactment were legal to own. Automatic weapons that were manufactured and registered before the Firearm Owners Protection Act (enacted May 19, 1986) may legally be transferred to civilians. * According to the Interstate Highway Act, private businesses are not allowed at rest areas along interstates. However, private businesses that began operations before January 1, 1960, were allowed to continue operation indefinitely. * Michigan law MCL 287.1101‚Äì1123 forbade ownership or acquisition of large and dangerous exotic carnivores as pets. But animals already owned as pets at the time of enactment were grandfathered in, and permitted to be kept. * The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) stated that, as of March 1, 2007, all televisions must be equipped with digital tuners, but stores that had TV sets with analog tuners only could continue to sell analog-tuner TV sets. * In 1967, the FCC prohibited companies from owning both a radio and a television station in the same marketing area, but those already owned before the ruling were permanently grandfathered. For example, ABC already owned WABC-TV, 77 WABC and WABC-FM (now WPLJ), and so could continue to own all three stations after the law was passed. But then-current broadcasting companies that had a radio station in a city could not acquire an adjacent television station, and companies that owned a television station in a city could not acquire adjacent radio stations. In 1996, the law was overturned. Companies can now own up to eight radio stations and two television stations in a market, provided that they do not receive more than 33% of that market's advertising revenues. * In 1984 Mississippi passed a law changing its official mode of capital punishment from the gas chamber to lethal injection. Under the new law, anyone sentenced after July 1, 1984, was to be executed by lethal injection; those condemned before that date were \\"grandfathered\\" into the gas chamber. Therefore, three more convicted murderers would die in the chamber‚ÄîEdward Earl Johnson and Connie Ray Evans in 1987, and Leo Edwards in 1989. In 1998, the Mississippi Legislature changed the execution law to allow all death row inmates to be executed by lethal injection. * In 1965, the Canadian government under Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson passed legislation that required senators to retire when they reached the age of 75. However, senators appointed before the legislation was passed were exempted from the mandatory retirement rule. * When Quebec enacted the Charter of the French Language in 1977, making French the province's official language, the famous Montreal kosher-style deli Schwartz's was allowed to keep its name with the apostrophe, a feature not used in French in the possessive form. * During Canada's federal Redistribution, a grandfather clause ensures that no province can have fewer seats after Redistribution than it did in 1985. * In the early 2000s the Houston Police Department mandated to police academy graduating classes that tenured officers are required to carry a .40 caliber sidearm; tenured police officers prior to the mandate were grandfathered in where they still carried their existing sidearms. * In 2013, Tennessee enacted a law requiring that products labeled as \\"Tennessee whiskey\\" be produced in the state, meet the legal definition of bourbon whiskey, and also use the Lincoln County Process. The law specifically allowed Benjamin Prichard's Tennessee Whiskey, which does not use the Lincoln County Process, to continue to be labeled as such. * In 2014, Kentucky radically simplified its classification of cities, with the previous system of six population-based classes being replaced by a two-class system based solely on the type of government, effective January 1, 2015. In the old classification system, many cities had special privileges (notably in alcoholic beverage control, taxing powers, certain labor laws, and the ability to operate its own school system) based on their class; the new legislation contained elaborate provisions to ensure that no city lost a privilege due to the reclassification. =Standards compliance= * Strict building codes to withstand frequent seismic activity were implemented in Japan in 1981. These codes applied only to new buildings, and existing buildings were not required to upgrade to meet the codes. One result of this was that during the great Kobe earthquake, many of the pre-1981 buildings were destroyed or written off, whereas most buildings built post-1981, in accordance with the new building codes, withstood the earthquake without structural damage. * Wigwag-style railroad crossing signals were deemed inadequate in 1949 and new installations were banned in the United States. Existing wigwag signals were allowed to remain and 65 years later, there are still about 40 wigwag signals in use on railroads in the United States. * The UK's national rail infrastructure management company Network Rail requires new locomotives and rolling stock to pass tests for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) to ensure that they do not interfere with signalling equipment. Some old diesel locomotives, which have been in service for many years without causing such interference, are exempted from EMC tests and are said to have acquired grandfather rights. * The Steel Electric-class ferryboats used by Washington State Ferries were in violation of several U.S. Coast Guard regulations, but because they were built in 1927, before the enactment of the regulations, they were allowed to sail. Those ferries were decommissioned in 2008. * Tolled highways that existed before the Interstate Highway System are exempt from Interstate standards despite being designated as Interstate highways. Many such toll roads (particularly the Pennsylvania Turnpike) remain as such. However, tolled highways built since the Interstate system, such as the tolled section of PA Route 60 and PA Turnpike 576, must be built or upgraded to Interstate standards before receiving Interstate designation. Both highways are to be part of the Interstate system, with PA 60 now I-376 and PA Turnpike 576 to become I-576 in the near future. As well, U.S. Interstate Highway standards mandate a minimum 11-foot median; however, highways built before those standards have been grandfathered into the system. The Kansas Turnpike is the most notable example, as it has been retrofitted with a Jersey barrier along its entire 236-mile (380-km) length. * The earliest Ontario 400-series highways and other expressways do not meet current standards; however, it would be prohibitively expensive to immediately rebuild them all to updated guidelines, unless a reconstruction is warranted by safety concerns and traffic levels. As a result, substandard sections of freeways such as low overpasses and short acceleration/deceleration lanes are often retrofitted with guard rails, warning signage, lower speed limits, or lighting. * The United States Federal Communications Commission has required all radio stations licensed in the United States since the 1930s to have four-letter call signs starting with a W (for stations east of the Mississippi River) or a K (for stations west of the Mississippi River). But stations with three-letter call signs and stations west of the Mississippi River starting with a W and east of the Mississippi River starting with a K‚Äîsuch as WRR in Dallas and WHB in Kansas City, plus KQV and KYW in Pennsylvania, all licensed before the 1930s‚Äîhave been permitted to keep their call signs. In the western United States, KOA in Denver, KGA in Spokane, KEX in Portland, and KHJ and KFI in Los Angeles, among many others, have been permitted to keep their original or reassigned three-letter call signs. In addition, a new or existing station may adopt a three-letter call set if they have a sister radio or TV station in that market with those calls (examples include WJZ-FM Baltimore and WGY-FM Albany, New York). (Note that stations licensed in Louisiana and Minnesota, the two states with significant territory on both sides of the Mississippi, are allowed to use call signs starting with either W or K, regardless of their location with respect to the river.) *In aviation, grandfather rights refers to the control that airlines exert over \\"slots\\" (that is, times allotted for access to runways). While the trend in airport management has been to reassert control over these slots, many airlines are able to retain their traditional rights based on current licences. * In the UK, until 1992, holders of ordinary car driving licences were allowed to drive buses of any size, provided that the use was not commercial and that there was no element of \\"hire or reward\\" in the vehicles' use; in other words, no one was paying to be carried. The law was changed in 1992 so that all drivers of large buses had to hold a PCV (PSV) licence, but anyone who had driven large buses could apply for grandfather rights to carry on doing so. * Some MOT test standards in the UK do not apply to vehicles first registered prior to the implementation of the legislation that introduced them. For example, vehicles first registered prior to January 1, 1973, are exempt from the requirement to use retro-reflective yellow/white vehicle registration plates and vehicles first registered prior to January 1, 1965, are exempt from seat belt standards/legislation unless they have been retrospectively fitted. *In some U.S. states, the inspection/maintenance (I/M) programs for motor vehicle emission testing have a rolling chassis exemption, e.g. a motor vehicle model 25 years old or more is exempted from emission tests. =Sports= * In 1920, when Major League Baseball introduced the prohibition of the spitball, the league recognized that some professional pitchers had nearly built their careers on using the spitball. The league made an exception for 17 named players, who were permitted to throw spitballs for the rest of their careers. Burleigh Grimes threw the last legal spitball in 1934. * Beginning in the 1979‚Äì80 season, the National Hockey League required all players to wear helmets. Nevertheless, if a player had signed his first professional contract before this ruling, he was allowed to play without a helmet if he so desired. Craig MacTavish was the last player to do so, playing without a helmet up until his retirement in 1997. Other notable players include Guy Lafleur and Rod Langway, who retired in 1991 and 1993, respectively. A similar rule was passed for NHL officials for the 1988‚Äì89 season; any official who started his career before the ruling could also go helmet-less if they so desired. Kerry Fraser was the last referee who was not required to wear a helmet, until the ratification of the new NHL Officials Association collective bargaining agreement on March 21, 2006, required all remaining helmet-less officials to wear one. The NHL created a similar rule in 2013 requiring visors for players with fewer than 25 games' experience. * Major League Baseball rule 1.16 requires players who were not in the major leagues before 1983 to wear a batting helmet with at least one earflap. The last player to wear a flapless helmet was the Florida Marlins' Tim Raines in 2002 (career began in 1979). The last player eligible to do so was Julio Franco in 2007 (career began in 1982), although he opted to use a flapped helmet. * The NFL outlawed the one-bar facemask for the 2004 season but allowed existing users to continue to wear them (even though by that time, the mask had mostly fallen out of favor, save for a handful of kickers/punters). Scott Player was the last player to wear the one-bar facemask in 2007. * For many decades, American League (AL) umpires working behind home plate used large, balloon-style chest protectors worn outside the shirt or coat, while their counterparts in the National League wore chest protectors inside the shirt or coat, more akin to those worn by catchers. In 1977, the AL ruled that all umpires entering the league that year and in the future had to wear the inside protector, although umpires already in the league who were using the outside protector could continue to do so. The last umpire to regularly wear the outside protector was Jerry Neudecker, who retired after the 1985 season. (Since 2000, Major League Baseball has used the same umpire crews for both leagues.) * The National Football League (NFL) currently prohibits corporate ownership of teams. Ownership groups can have no more than 24 members, and at least one partner must hold a 30% ownership stake. The league has exempted the Green Bay Packers from this rule; the team has been owned by a publicly owned, nonprofit corporation since 1923, decades before the league's current ownership rules were put in place in the 1980s. * Similarly, in association football the , which operates the and , prohibits corporate ownership of more than 49% of teams and rebranding as well (see 50+1 rule). The Royal Dutch Football Association has a similar rule with regard to the . However, Bayer Leverkusen and PSV Eindhoven can maintain their property and names as they were founded in the first decades of the twentieth century by Bayer and Philips as their sport teams. Another Bundesliga side, VfL Wolfsburg, is allowed to remain under the ownership of Volkswagen as it was founded in 1945 as a club for VW workers. * Three former venues in the National Hockey League‚ÄîChicago Stadium, Boston Garden and Buffalo Memorial Auditorium‚Äîhad shorter-than-regulation ice surface, as their construction predated the regulation. The distance was taken out of the neutral zone. All three arenas were replaced by newer facilities by 1996. The regulation does not apply in many minor league venues, and in older minor league venues shorter than regulation, the distance was taken from neutral zones. * Five schools that are members of NCAA Division III, a classification whose members are generally not allowed to offer athletic scholarships, are specifically allowed to award scholarships in one or two sports, with at most one for each sex. Each of these schools had a men's team that participated in the NCAA University Division, the predecessor to today's Division I, before the NCAA adopted its current three-division setup in 1973. (The NCAA did not award national championships in women's sports until 1980‚Äì81 in Division II and Division III, and 1981‚Äì82 in Division I.) Three other schools were formerly grandfathered, but have either moved their Division I sports to Division III or discontinued them entirely. * In 2006, NASCAR passed a rule that required teams to field no more than four cars. Since Roush Racing had five cars, they could continue to field five cars until the end of 2009. * Jackie Robinson's #42 shirt, which he wore when he broke Major League Baseball's 20th-century color line and throughout his Hall of Fame career with the Brooklyn Dodgers, is the subject of two such grandfather clauses. ** In 1997, MLB prohibited all teams from issuing #42 in the future; current players wearing #42 were allowed to continue to do so. The New York Yankees' closer Mariano Rivera was the last active player to be grandfathered in, wearing #42 until he retired after the 2013 season. However, since 2009, all uniformed personnel (players, managers, coaches, umpires) are required to wear #42 (without names) on Jackie Robinson Day. ** In 2014, Robinson's alma mater of UCLA, where he played four sports from 1939 to 1941, retired #42 across its entire athletic program. (The men's basketball team had previously retired the number for Walt Hazzard.) Three athletes who were wearing the number at the time (in women's soccer, softball, and football) were allowed to continue wearing the number for the rest of their UCLA careers. * The NFL introduced a numbering system for the 1973 season, requiring players to be numbered by position. Players who played in the NFL in 1972 and earlier were allowed to keep their old numbers if their number was outside of their range for their position, although New York Giants linebacker Brad Van Pelt wore number 10 despite entering the league in 1973. (Linebackers had to be numbered in the 50s at the time; since 1984 they may now wear numbers in the 50s or 90s. Van Pelt got away with it because he was the team's backup kicker his rookie season.) The last player to be covered by the grandfather clause was Julius Adams, a defensive end (1971‚Äì1985, 1987) for the New England Patriots, who wore number 85 through the 1985 season. He wore a different number during a brief return two years later. ** Similarly, the NFL also banned the use of the numbers 0 and 00 (both treated a single number) for uniforms around the same time, but players Jim Otto and Ken Burrough used the number throughout the 1970s. * The National Hot Rod Association is enforcing a grandfather clause banning energy drink sponsors from entering the sport if they were not sponsoring cars as of April 24, 2008, pursuant to the five-year extension of its sponsorship with Coca-Cola, which is changing the title sponsorship from Powerade to Full Throttle Energy Drink. * Even though tobacco advertising in car racing was banned, the Marlboro cigarette brand, owned by British American Tobacco in Canada and Philip Morris International elsewhere, is grandfathered in to sponsoring a car in the F1 series on the agreement that the name is not shown in places that banned it. * NASCAR allows some grandfathered sponsorships by energy drink brands in the top-level Monster Energy Cup Series, while rules prohibit new sponsors in that category. Similar policies with regard to telecommunications companies were in effect when the series was sponsored by Sprint. Additionally, some insurance company sponsorships were grandfathered in when the second-level series now known as the Xfinity Series was sponsored by Nationwide Insurance. * In 2013, the Professional Bull Riders made it mandatory that all contestants at their events who were born on or after October 15, 1994, ride with helmets. Those born before that date were grandfathered in and permitted to ride with their cowboy hats if so desired. * In August 2014, the Baseball Hall of Fame and the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) announced changes to the Hall of Fame balloting process effective with the election for the Hall's induction class of . The most significant change was reducing the time frame of eligibility for recently retired players from 15 years to 10. Three players on the 2015 BBWAA ballot who had appeared on more than 10 previous ballots‚ÄîDon Mattingly, Lee Smith, and Alan Trammell‚Äîwere exempted from this change, and remained eligible for 15 years (provided they received enough votes to stay on the ballot). * In November 2015, Little League Baseball changed its age determination date from April 30 to August 31‚Äîa calendar date that falls after the completion of all of the organization's World Series tournaments‚Äîeffective with the 2018 season. The rule was written so that players born between May 1 and August 31, 2005, who would otherwise have been denied their 12-year-old season in the flagship Little League division, would be counted as 12-year- olds in the 2018 season. * In December 2016, French Rugby Federation (FFR) president Bernard Laporte announced that all future members of France national teams in rugby union and rugby sevens would be required to hold French passports. At the time, eligibility rules of World Rugby, the sport's international governing body, required only three years' residency for national team eligibility, and did not require citizenship. Players who had represented France prior to the FFR policy change remain eligible for national team selection.

VajradhƒÅtu ma·πá·∏çala used in Amoghavajra's teachings from the '. Amoghavajra ( ; , 705‚Äì774) was a prolific translator who became one of the most politically powerful Buddhist monks in Chinese history and is acknowledged as one of the Eight Patriarchs of the Doctrine in Shingon Buddhism. Life Born in Samarkand of an Indian merchant or a brahmin father and a mother of Sogdian origin, he went to China at age 10 after his father's death. In 719, he was ordained into the sangha by Vajrabodhi and became his disciple. After all foreign monks were expelled from China in 741, he and some associates went on a pilgrimage to gather texts, visiting Sri Lanka, Indochina and India. During this voyage, he apparently met Nagabodhi, Vajrabodhi's master, and studied the Tattvasa·πÉgraha Tantra at length. He returned to China in 746 with some five hundred volumes. In 750, he left the court to join the military governorship of General Geshu Han of the Tang dynasty, for whom he conducted large-scale tantric initiations at his field headquarters. In 754, he translated the first portion of the Tattvasa·πÉgraha Tantra texts (Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka. 865), central to the Outer Tantras of Vajrayana Buddhism, which became one of his most significant accomplishments. He regarded its teachings as the most effective method for attaining enlightenment yet devised, and incorporated its basic schema in a number of writings. Amoghavajra was captured during the An Lushan Rebellion but in 757 was freed by loyalist forces, whereupon he performed rites to purify the capital and consolidate the security of the Tang state. Two years later, he initiated the emperor Emperor Suzong of Tang as a chakravartin. In 765, Amoghavajra used his new rendition of the Humane King Sutra in an elaborate ritual to counter the advance of a 200,000-strong army of Tibetan and Uyghurs which was poised to invade Chang'an. Its leader, Pugu Huai'en, dropped dead in camp and his forces dispersed. The opulent Jinge Temple on Mount Wutai was completed in 767, a pet project of Amoghavajra, one of his many efforts to promote the bodhisattva Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ as the protector of China. Amoghavajra continued to perform rites to avert disaster at the request of Emperor Daizong of Tang. On his death in 774, three days of mourning were officially declared, and he posthumously received various exalted titles. The Chinese monks Huilang, Huiguo and Huilin were among his most prominent successors. Seventy-seven texts were translated by Amoghavajra according to his own account, though many more, including original compositions, are ascribed to him in the Chinese canons.

They are named after the symbol used to denote them, the Hebrew letter aleph (\\\\aleph). (Though in older mathematics books, the letter aleph is often printed upside down by accident,For example, in the letter aleph appears both the right way up and upside down partly because a monotype matrix for aleph was mistakenly constructed the wrong way up). The cardinality of the natural numbers is \\\\aleph_0 (read aleph-naught or aleph-zero; the term aleph-null is also sometimes used), the next larger cardinality is aleph-one \\\\aleph_1, then \\\\aleph_2 and so on. Continuing in this manner, it is possible to define a cardinal number \\\\aleph_\\\\alpha for every ordinal number \\\\alpha, as described below. The concept and notation are due to Georg Cantor, Miller quotes : \\"His new numbers deserved something unique. ... Not wishing to invent a new symbol himself, he chose the aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet...the aleph could be taken to represent new beginnings...\\" who defined the notion of cardinality and realized that infinite sets can have different cardinalities. The aleph numbers differ from the infinity (\\\\infty) commonly found in algebra and calculus, in that the alephs measure the sizes of sets, while infinity is commonly defined either as an extreme limit of the real number line (applied to a function or sequence that \\"diverges to infinity\\" or \\"increases without bound\\"), or as an extreme point of the extended real number line. Aleph-naught \\\\aleph_0 (aleph-naught, also aleph-zero or aleph-null) is the cardinality of the set of all natural numbers, and is an infinite cardinal. The set of all finite ordinals, called \\\\omega or \\\\omega_{0} (where \\\\omega is the lowercase Greek letter omega), has cardinality \\\\aleph_0. A set has cardinality \\\\aleph_0 if and only if it is countably infinite, that is, there is a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between it and the natural numbers. Examples of such sets are * the set of all square numbers, the set of all cubic numbers, the set of all fourth powers, ... * the set of all perfect powers, the set of all prime powers, * the set of all even numbers, the set of all odd numbers, * the set of all prime numbers, the set of all composite numbers, * the set of all integers, * the set of all rational numbers, * the set of all constructible numbers (in the geometric sense), * the set of all algebraic numbers, * the set of all computable numbers, * the set of all definable numbers, * the set of all binary strings of finite length, and * the set of all finite subsets of any given countably infinite set. These infinite ordinals: \\\\omega, \\\\omega+1, \\\\omega\\\\cdot2, \\\\omega^{2}, \\\\omega^{\\\\omega} and \\\\varepsilon_{0} are among the countably infinite sets. For example, the sequence (with ordinality œâ¬∑2) of all positive odd integers followed by all positive even integers :\\\\\\\\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ...\\\\\\\\} is an ordering of the set (with cardinality \\\\aleph_0) of positive integers. If the axiom of countable choice (a weaker version of the axiom of choice) holds, then \\\\aleph_0 is smaller than any other infinite cardinal. Aleph-one \\\\aleph_1 is the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinal numbers, called \\\\omega_{1} or sometimes \\\\Omega. This \\\\omega_{1} is itself an ordinal number larger than all countable ones, so it is an uncountable set. Therefore, \\\\aleph_1 is distinct from \\\\aleph_0. The definition of \\\\aleph_1 implies (in ZF, Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory without the axiom of choice) that no cardinal number is between \\\\aleph_0 and \\\\aleph_1. If the axiom of choice is used, it can be further proved that the class of cardinal numbers is totally ordered, and thus \\\\aleph_1 is the second-smallest infinite cardinal number. Using the axiom of choice, one can show one of the most useful properties of the set \\\\omega_{1}: any countable subset of \\\\omega_{1} has an upper bound in \\\\omega_{1}. (This follows from the fact that the union of a countable number of countable sets is itself countable‚Äîone of the most common applications of the axiom of choice.) This fact is analogous to the situation in \\\\aleph_0: every finite set of natural numbers has a maximum which is also a natural number, and finite unions of finite sets are finite. \\\\omega_{1} is actually a useful concept, if somewhat exotic-sounding. An example application is \\"closing\\" with respect to countable operations; e.g., trying to explicitly describe the \\\\sigma-algebra generated by an arbitrary collection of subsets (see e.g. Borel hierarchy). This is harder than most explicit descriptions of \\"generation\\" in algebra (vector spaces, groups, etc.) because in those cases we only have to close with respect to finite operations‚Äîsums, products, and the like. The process involves defining, for each countable ordinal, via transfinite induction, a set by \\"throwing in\\" all possible countable unions and complements, and taking the union of all that over all of \\\\omega_{1}. Every uncountable coanalytic subset of a Polish space X has cardinality \\\\aleph_1 or 2^{\\\\aleph_0}.Dales H.G., Dashiell F.K., Lau A.TM., Strauss D. (2016) Introduction. In: Banach Spaces of Continuous Functions as Dual Spaces. CMS Books in Mathematics (Ouvrages de math√©matiques de la SMC). Springer, Cham Continuum hypothesis The cardinality of the set of real numbers (cardinality of the continuum) is 2^{\\\\aleph_0}. It cannot be determined from ZFC (Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice) where this number fits exactly in the aleph number hierarchy, but it follows from ZFC that the continuum hypothesis, CH, is equivalent to the identity The CH states that there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers. CH is independent of ZFC: it can be neither proven nor disproven within the context of that axiom system (provided that ZFC is consistent). That CH is consistent with ZFC was demonstrated by Kurt G√∂del in 1940, when he showed that its negation is not a theorem of ZFC. That it is independent of ZFC was demonstrated by Paul Cohen in 1963, when he showed conversely that the CH itself is not a theorem of ZFC‚Äîby the (then novel) method of forcing. Aleph-omega Aleph-omega is :\\\\aleph_\\\\omega = \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\aleph_n : n \\\\in \\\\omega \\\\\\\\} = \\\\sup \\\\\\\\{ \\\\aleph_n : n \\\\in \\\\left\\\\\\\\{\\\\,0,1,2,\\\\dots\\\\,\\\\right\\\\\\\\}\\\\, \\\\\\\\} where the smallest infinite ordinal is denoted œâ. That is, the cardinal number \\\\aleph_\\\\omega is the least upper bound of \\\\aleph_\\\\omega is the first uncountable cardinal number that can be demonstrated within Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory not to be equal to the cardinality of the set of all real numbers; for any positive integer n we can consistently assume that 2^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\aleph_n, and moreover it is possible to assume 2^{\\\\aleph_0} is as large as we like. We are only forced to avoid setting it to certain special cardinals with cofinality \\\\aleph_0, meaning there is an unbounded function from \\\\aleph_0 to it (see Easton's theorem). Aleph-\\\\alpha for general \\\\alpha To define \\\\aleph_\\\\alpha for arbitrary ordinal number \\\\alpha, we must define the successor cardinal operation, which assigns to any cardinal number \\\\rho the next larger well-ordered cardinal \\\\rho^{+} (if the axiom of choice holds, this is the next larger cardinal). We can then define the aleph numbers as follows: and for Œª, an infinite limit ordinal, The Œ±-th infinite initial ordinal is written \\\\omega_\\\\alpha. Its cardinality is written \\\\aleph_\\\\alpha. In ZFC, the aleph function \\\\aleph is a bijection from the ordinals to the infinite cardinals. Fixed points of omega For any ordinal Œ± we have In many cases \\\\omega_{\\\\alpha} is strictly greater than Œ±. For example, for any successor ordinal Œ± this holds. There are, however, some limit ordinals which are fixed points of the omega function, because of the fixed-point lemma for normal functions. The first such is the limit of the sequence Any weakly inaccessible cardinal is also a fixed point of the aleph function. This can be shown in ZFC as follows. Suppose \\\\kappa = \\\\aleph_\\\\lambda is a weakly inaccessible cardinal. If \\\\lambda were a successor ordinal, then \\\\aleph_\\\\lambda would be a successor cardinal and hence not weakly inaccessible. If \\\\lambda were a limit ordinal less than \\\\kappa , then its cofinality (and thus the cofinality of \\\\aleph_\\\\lambda) would be less than \\\\kappa and so \\\\kappa would not be regular and thus not weakly inaccessible. Thus \\\\lambda \\\\geq \\\\kappa and consequently \\\\lambda = \\\\kappa which makes it a fixed point. Role of axiom of choice The cardinality of any infinite ordinal number is an aleph number. Every aleph is the cardinality of some ordinal. The least of these is its initial ordinal. Any set whose cardinality is an aleph is equinumerous with an ordinal and is thus well- orderable. Each finite set is well-orderable, but does not have an aleph as its cardinality. The assumption that the cardinality of each infinite set is an aleph number is equivalent over ZF to the existence of a well-ordering of every set, which in turn is equivalent to the axiom of choice. ZFC set theory, which includes the axiom of choice, implies that every infinite set has an aleph number as its cardinality (i.e. is equinumerous with its initial ordinal), and thus the initial ordinals of the aleph numbers serve as a class of representatives for all possible infinite cardinal numbers. When cardinality is studied in ZF without the axiom of choice, it is no longer possible to prove that each infinite set has some aleph number as its cardinality; the sets whose cardinality is an aleph number are exactly the infinite sets that can be well-ordered. The method of Scott's trick is sometimes used as an alternative way to construct representatives for cardinal numbers in the setting of ZF. For example, one can define card(S) to be the set of sets with the same cardinality as S of minimum possible rank. This has the property that card(S) = card(T) if and only if S and T have the same cardinality. (The set card(S) does not have the same cardinality of S in general, but all its elements do.)

Lights Out is an American old-time radio program devoted mostly to horror and the supernatural. Created by Wyllis Cooper and then eventually taken over by Arch Oboler, versions of Lights Out aired on different networks, at various times, from January 3, 1934 to the summer of 1947 and the series eventually made the transition to television. Lights Out was one of the earliest radio horror programs, predating Suspense and Inner Sanctum. History =The Wyllis Cooper era= In the fall of 1933, NBC writer Wyllis Cooper conceived the idea of \\"a midnight mystery serial to catch the attention of the listeners at the witching hour.\\"\\"MIDNITE JITTERS\\", Variety, November 28, 1933 The idea was to offer listeners a dramatic program late at night, at a time when the competition was mostly airing music. At some point, the serial concept was dropped in favor of an anthology format emphasizing crime thrillers and the supernatural. The first series of shows (each 15 minutes long) ran on a local NBC station, WENR, at midnight Wednesdays, starting in January 1934. By April, the series proved successful enough to expand to a half-hour. In January 1935, the show was discontinued in order to ease Cooper's workload (he was then writing scripts for the network's prestigious Immortal Dramas program), but was brought back by huge popular demand a few weeks later. After a successful tryout in New York City, the series was picked up by NBC in April 1935 and broadcast nationally, usually late at night and always on Wednesdays. Cooper stayed on the program until June 1936, when another Chicago writer, Arch Oboler, took over. By the time Cooper left, the series had inspired about 600 fan clubs. Cooper's run was characterized by grisly stories spiked with dark, tongue-in- cheek humor, a sort of radio Grand Guignol. A character might be buried, eaten, or skinned alive, vaporized in a ladle of white-hot steel, absorbed by a giant slurping amoeba, have his arm torn off by a robot, or forced to endure torture, beating or decapitation‚Äîalways with the appropriate blood-curdling acting and sound effects. Though there had been efforts at horror on radio previously (notably The Witch's Tale), there does not seem to have been anything quite as explicit or outrageous as this on a regular basis. When Lights Out switched to the national network, a decision was made to tone down the gore and emphasize tamer fantasy and ghost stories. Only one recording survives from Cooper's 1934‚Äì1936 run, but his less gruesome scripts were occasionally rebroadcast. An interesting example is his \\"Three Men,\\" which became the series' annual Christmas show (a 1937 version circulates among collectors under titles like \\"Uninhabited\\" or \\"Christmas Story\\"); it has a plot typical of Cooper's gentler fantasies. On the first Christmas after World War I, three Allied officers meet by chance in a train compartment and find one another vaguely familiar. They fall asleep and share a dream in which they are the Three Wise Men searching for Jesus. But is it really a dream? In the best tradition of supernatural twist endings, Cooper has the officers wake to find a strange odor in their compartment--which turns out to be myrrh and frankincense. In the mid-1940s, Cooper's decade-old scripts were used for three brief summertime revivals of Lights Out. The surviving recordings reveal that Cooper was experimenting with both stream of consciousness and first- person narration a few years before these techniques were popularized in American radio drama by, among others, Arch Oboler and Orson Welles. In one tale (The Haunted Cell, original broadcast date unknown, rebroadcast 7/20/1946), a murderer describes how the Chicago police try to beat a confession out of him. When that doesn't work, they put him in a jail cell haunted by the ghost of a previous occupant, a smooth gangster named Skeeter Dempsey who describes his own execution and discusses the afterlife knowledgeably. In the final twist, the narrator reveals that he has taken Skeeter's advice to commit suicide and is now himself a ghost. Another story, originally broadcast in March 1935 as \\"After Five O'Clock\\" and revived in 1945 as \\"Man in the Middle,\\" allows us to follow the thoughts of a businessman as he spends a day at the office cheating on his wife with his secretary. The amusing contrast between what the protagonist thinks to himself and what he says out loud to the other characters enlivens one of Cooper's favorite plot devices, the love triangle. One radio critic, in reviewing a March 1935 episode that used multiple first-person narrators, said: Other Cooper scripts are more routine, perhaps in part because the author's attention was divided by other projects. From the summer of 1933 until August 1935, Cooper was NBC Chicago's continuity chief, supervising a staff of writers and editing their scripts. He resigned in order to devote more time to Lights Out as well as a daily aviation adventure serial, Flying Time. At various times, he also served on NBC's Program Planning Board, wrote the soap opera Betty and Bob, and commuted weekly to produce another program in Des Moines, Iowa. From early 1934 to mid 1936, Cooper produced close to 120 scripts for Lights Out. Some episode titles (all from 1935) include \\"The Mine of Lost Skulls,\\" \\"Sepulzeda's Revenge,\\" \\"Three Lights From a Match,\\" \\"Play Without a Name,\\" and \\"Lost in the Catacombs\\" (about a honeymoon couple in Rome who lose their way in the catacombs under the city). Typical plots included: * A novelist, struggling to write a locked room mystery, locks himself in his office only to be interrupted by a stranger who resembles the story's murderer. * A killer named \\"Nails\\" Malone has \\"a conference with his conscience\\" about the murders he's committed. * A scientist accidentally creates a giant amoeba that grows rapidly, eats living things (like the lab assistant's cat), and exhibits powers of mind control. The show benefited tremendously from Chicago's considerable pool of creative talent. The city was, like New York, one of the main centers of radio production in 1930s America. Among the actors who participated regularly during the Cooper era were Sidney Ellstrom, Art Jacobson, Don Briggs, Bernardine Flynn, Betty Lou Gerson, and Betty Winkler. The sound effects technicians frequently had to perform numerous experiments to achieve the desired noises. Cooper once had them build a gallows and wasn't satisfied until one of the sound men personally dropped through the trap. The series had little music scoring save for the thirteen chime notes that opened the program (after a deep voice intoned, \\"Lights out, everybody!\\") and an ominous gong which was used to punctuate a scene and provide the transition to another. A veteran radio dramatist, Ferrin Fraser, wrote some of the scripts.Ferrin Fraser, 65, Writer for Radio. New York Times. Apr 2, 1969, p 47 =The Arch Oboler era= When Cooper departed, his replacement‚Äîa young, eccentric and ambitious Arch Oboler‚Äîpicked up where he left off, often following Cooper's general example but investing the scripts with his own concerns. Oboler made imaginative use of stream-of-consciousness narration and sometimes introduced social and political themes that reflected his commitment to antifascist liberalism. Although in later years Lights Out would be closely associated with Oboler, he was always quick to credit Cooper as the series' creator and spoke highly of the older author, calling him \\"the unsung pioneer of radio dramatic techniques\\"Arch Oboler, Oboler Omnibus: Radio Plays and Personalities, Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1945. and the first person Oboler knew of who understood that radio drama could be an art form.\\"Radio: The Lost Medium\\", Washington Post, January 7, 1973 In June 1936, Oboler's first script for Lights Out was \\"Burial Service,\\" about a paralyzed girl who is buried alive. NBC was flooded with outraged letters in response. His next story, one of his most popular efforts, was the frequently repeated \\"Catwife,\\" about the desperate husband of a woman who turns into a giant feline. He followed with \\"The Dictator,\\" about Roman emperor Caligula. This set the pattern for Oboler's run: For every two horror episodes, he said later, he would try to write one drama on subjects that were ostensibly more serious, usually moral, social, and political issues. Like Cooper, Oboler was much in demand and highly prolific. While working on Lights Out, he wrote numerous dramatic sketches for variety shows (The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Rudy Vallee's programs), anthologies (Grand Hotel, The First Nighter Program, The Irene Rich Show) and specials. In August 1936, singer Vallee, then the dean of variety show hosts, claimed that Lights Out was his favorite series. Oboler occasionally redrafted his Lights Out scripts for use on Vallee's and other variety hours. A version of Oboler's \\"Prelude to Murder\\" starring Peter Lorre and Olivia de Havilland was scheduled to air on a November 1936 Vallee broadcast. Other Lights Out plays that turned up on various late 1930s variety programs included \\"Danse Macabre\\" (with Boris Karloff), \\"Alter Ego\\" (with Bette Davis) and \\"The Harp.\\" Oboler met the demand by adopting an unusual scripting procedure: He would lie in bed at night, smoke cigarettes, and improvise into a Dictaphone, acting out every line of the play. In this way, he was able to complete a script quickly, sometimes in as little as 30 minutes, though he might take as long as three or four hours. In the morning, a stenographer would type up the recording for Oboler's revisions. Years later, Rod Serling, who counted radio fantasists like Cooper, Oboler, and Norman Corwin among his inspirations, would use a similar process to churn out his many teleplays for The Twilight Zone, a series that in many respects was to television what Lights Out was to radio. Despite acclaim for Oboler's dramas, NBC announced it was canceling the series in the summer of 1937--\\"just to see whether listeners are still faithful to it,\\" according to one press report but also, it seems, to allow the hard-working author a vacation. Another outcry from fans led to the program's return that September for another season. In the spring of 1938, the series earned a good deal of publicity for its fourth anniversary as a half-hour show when actor Boris Karloff, the star of many a Hollywood horror film, traveled to Chicago to appear in five consecutive episodes. Among his roles: an accused murderer haunted by an unearthly woman-like demonic creature (played by Templeton Fox) urging him to \\"kill...kill...kill\\" in \\"The Dream\\"; the desperate husband in a rebroadcast of \\"Catwife\\"; and a mad, violin-playing hermit who imprisons a pair of women, threatening to murder one and marry the other, in \\"Valse Triste.\\" Oboler left in the summer of 1938 to pursue other projects, writing and directing several critically acclaimed dramatic anthology series: Arch Oboler's Plays, Everyman's Theatre, and Plays for Americans. A variety of NBC staff writers and freelancers filled in until Lights Out was canceled in 1939. NBC Chicago continuity editor Ken Robinson supervised some of the writing. Regular contributors included William Fifield and Hobart Donovan. A recording of the fifth anniversary show survives from this season. Donovan's \\"The Devil's Due,\\" about criminals haunted by a mysterious stranger, is in keeping with the formula laid down by Cooper. In 1942, Oboler, needing money, revived the series for a year on CBS. Airing in prime time instead of late at night, the program was sponsored by the makers of Ironized Yeast. Most of the Lights Out recordings that exist today come from this version of the show. For this revival, each episode began with an ominously tolling bell over which Oboler read the cryptic tagline: \\"It...is...later...than...you...think.\\" This was followed by a dour \\"warning\\" to listeners to turn off their radios if they felt their constitutions were too delicate to handle the frightening tale that was about to unfold. Directing and hosting the 1942-43 broadcasts, mostly from New York and Hollywood, Oboler not only reused scripts from his 1936‚Äì38 run but also revived some of the more fantasy-oriented plays from his other, more recent anthology series. Some episodes had originally aired on the author's groundbreaking, critically acclaimed 1939-1940 program Arch Oboler's Plays, among them: * \\"The Ugliest Man in the World,\\" a sentimental tale of a hideously deformed man seeking love in a cruel world, inspired by Boris Karloff's typecasting in horror roles. * \\"Bathysphere,\\" a political thriller about a scientist and a dictator sharing a deep sea diving bell. * \\"Visitor from Hades,\\" about a bickering married couple trapped in their apartment by a doppelg√§nger. Another unusual script, \\"Execution,\\" about a mysterious French woman who bedevils the Nazis trying to hang her, had previously aired on Oboler's wartime propaganda series Plays for Americans. Like Cooper, Oboler made effective use of atmospheric sound effects, perhaps most memorably in his legendary \\"Chicken Heart,\\" a script that debuted in 1937 and was rebroadcast in 1938 and 1942. It features the simple but effective \\"thump-thump\\" of an ever-growing, ever-beating chicken heart which, thanks to a scientific experiment gone wrong, threatens to engulf the entire world. Although the story bears similarities to an earlier Cooper episode (about an ever-growing amoeba that makes an ominous \\"slurp! slurp!\\" sound), Oboler's unique choice of monster was inspired by a Chicago Tribune article announcing that scientists had succeeded in keeping a chicken heart alive for a considerable period of time after its having been removed from the chicken. Recordings of the original radio broadcasts are lost or unavailable, although Oboler later recreated this episode for a record album in 1962. Part of the episode's notoriety stems from a popular standup routine by comedian Bill Cosby (on his 1966 album Wonderfulness), an account of his staying up late as a child to listen to scary radio shows against his parents' wishes and being terrified by the chicken heart. Cosby also referenced the episode in a camping episode of Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. Other well-remembered Oboler tales, many of them written in the 1930s and rebroadcast in the '40s, include: * \\"Come to the Bank,\\" in which a man learns to walk through walls but gets stuck when he tries to rob a vault. * \\"Oxychloride X,\\" about a chemist who invents a substance that can eat through anything. * \\"Murder Castle,\\" based on the real- life case of H. H. Holmes, Chicago's notorious serial killer. * \\"Profits Unlimited,\\" a still-relevant allegory on the promises and dangers of capitalism. * \\"Spider,\\" in which two men attempt to capture a giant arachnid. * \\"The Flame,\\" a weird exercise in supernatural pyromania. * \\"Sub-Basement,\\" which finds yet another husband and wife in peril--this time trapped far beneath a department store in the subterranean railway of the Chicago Tunnel Company. Lights Out often featured metafictional humor. Perhaps inspired by Cooper's \\"The Coffin in Studio B,\\" in which actors rehearsing an episode of Lights Out are interrupted by a mysterious coffin salesman peddling his wares, Oboler wrote stories like \\"Murder in the Script Department,\\" in which two Lights Out script typists become trapped in their building after hours as frightening, unexplained events occur. In \\"The Author and the Thing,\\" Oboler even plays himself pitted against one of his own monstrous creations. After the 1942-43 Lights Out, Oboler continued to work in radio (Everything for the Boys and revivals of Arch Oboler's Plays) and pursued a second career in filmmaking, first in the Hollywood mainstream and then as an independent producer, writing and directing a number of offbeat, low-budget films, including Five, about survivors of a nuclear war, The Twonky, a satire of television, and the 3-D film Bwana Devil, which made a huge profit on a small investment. He dabbled in live television (a six-episode 1949 anthology series, Arch Oboler Comedy Theater), playwriting (Night of the Auk), and fiction (House on Fire). In 1962, he produced an album entitled Drop Dead! which recreated abbreviated versions of his Lights Out thrillers, including \\"Chicken Heart\\" and \\"The Dark,\\" about a mysterious creeping mist that turns people inside-out. In 1971‚Äì1972, Oboler produced a syndicated radio series, The Devil and Mr. O (he liked for people to call him \\"Mr. O\\"), which featured vintage recordings from Lights Out and his other series with newly recorded introductions by Mr. O himself. =Later revivals= The success of Oboler's 1942-1943 Lights Out revival was part of a trend in 1940s American radio toward more horror. Genre series like Inner Sanctum, Suspense and others drew increasingly large ratings. Perhaps with this in mind, NBC broadcast another Lights Out revival series from New York in the summer of 1945, using seven of Wyllis Cooper's original 1930s scripts. Like Oboler's, this revival aired in the early evening and not late at night, and because of this, it was reported, \\"only those Cooper scripts which stressed fantasy rather than horror\\" were broadcast. These included a bloodless ghost story about a man who accidentally condemns his dead wife to haunt a nearby cemetery and \\"The Rocket Ship\\", science fiction involving interstellar travel. Cooper, then an advertising executive at New York's Compton Agency, may have had little or nothing to do with the actual broadcasts other than allowing his scripts to be performed. This was followed by an eight-episode revival in the summer of 1946, from NBC Chicago, although at least one of the scripts is not by Cooper (an adaptation of Charles Dickens' \\"The Signal-Man\\"). This series also avoided the use of outright gore. In fact, a review in Variety complained that the premiere episode, The Seven Plovers, was \\"a little too serious in content for a thriller\\" since it included \\"religious background, philosophical discussion and dream diagnosis ...\\" A third series of eight vintage Cooper scripts was scheduled to run in the summer of 1947 as well. Broadcast from Hollywood over ABC Radio, it starred Boris Karloff and was sponsored by Eversharp, whose company president canceled the series after the third episode, apparently unhappy with the gruesome subject matter. The premiere, \\"Death Robbery\\", featured Karloff as a scientist who brings his wife back from the dead, only to find she's become a gibbering homicidal maniac. An uncredited Lurene Tuttle plays the wife. This episode is one of the few surviving examples of Cooper's Lights Out work that reflects the sort of explicit horror that characterized the original series. Eversharp paid off Cooper for his five unused scripts and Lights Out ended its long run on network radio.\\"Eversharp Yanks 'Lights Out' Switch\\", Variety, August 6, 1947 From 1936 to 1939, Cooper pursued a screenwriting career in Hollywood (his major credits are the screenplay for Universal's 1939 Son of Frankenstein and contributions to the Mr. Moto mystery series starring Peter Lorre) but continued to work in radio, advertising and, later, television. By 1940, he had changed the spelling of his name from \\"Willis\\" to \\"Wyllis\\" (to satisfy \\"his wife's numerological inclinations\\")Time, June 2, 1941 and lived mainly in the New York City area where he worked on a number of radio programs, the most important of which was probably Edward M. Kirby's popular and acclaimed government propaganda series, The Army Hour, which Cooper wrote, produced and directed for its first year. In 1947, Cooper created Quiet, Please, another radio program dealing with the supernatural, which he wrote and directed until 1949, occasionally borrowing ideas from his Lights Out stories while creating wholly new scripts that were often more sophisticated than his 1930s originals. In 1949 and 1950, he produced (and contributed scripts to) three live TV series that frequently dealt with the supernatural: Volume One, Escape and Stage 13. Television In 1946, NBC Television brought Lights Out to TV in a series of four specials, broadcast live and produced by Fred Coe, who also contributed three of the scripts. NBC asked Cooper to write the script for the premiere, \\"First Person Singular\\", which is told entirely from the point of view of an unseen murderer who kills his obnoxious wife and winds up being executed. Variety gave this first episode a rave review (\\"undoubtedly one of the best dramatic shows yet seen on a television screen\\"), but Lights Out did not become a regular NBC-TV series until 1949. Coe initially produced this second series but, for much of its run, the live 1949-1952 program was sponsored by appliance maker Admiral, produced by Herbert Bayard Swope, Jr., directed by Laurence Schwab, Jr., and hosted by Frank Gallop. Critical response was mixed but the program was successful for several seasons (sometimes appearing in the weekly lists of the ten most watched network shows) until competition from the massively popular sitcom I Love Lucy on CBS helped to kill it off. The 1949‚Äì1952 series featured scripts by a variety of authors, including a young Ira Levin. In 1951, producer Swope even bought a few stories from Cooper and Oboler. \\"Dead Man's Coat,\\" starring Basil Rathbone, was adapted from one of Cooper's 1930s plays (and not to be confused with his Quiet, Please episode \\"Wear the Dead Man's Coat\\" with which it shares a similar premise). Oboler's \\"And Adam Begot,\\" adapted by Ernest Kinoy from a radio play, starred Kent Smith. Among the young actors employed was Leslie Nielsen, who appeared in several episodes including \\"The Lost Will of Dr. Rant,\\" based on \\"The Tractate Middoth\\", an M. R. James story. These and many others are available on DVD. Other notable guest stars included Anne Bancroft, Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint, Lee J. Cobb, Anthony Quinn, Jessica Tandy, Veronica Lake, John Forsythe, Boris Karloff, Beatrice Straight, Eli Wallach, Vincent Price, Jane Wyatt, and Jack Palance. Notable directors included Delbert Mann and Fred Coe. In 1972, NBC aired yet another TV incarnation of Lights Out, a TV movie pilot which was not well received. In fact, Oboler (who was then syndicating his The Devil and Mr. O radio show) announced publicly that he had nothing to do with it. In 1995, the network announced it was developing a TV movie and \\"potential miniseries\\" called Lights Out which, it was stressed, was \\"not being adapted from the radio series.\\" Although Oboler retained the rights to his radio scripts, NBC still owns the rights to the series' title. Despite its modest television success, radio historian John Dunning suggested that the legend of Lights Out is firmly rooted in radio.

Sometimes it is also an officially accredited title, that is only awarded to a town when the requirements are met (like the title Seebad in Germany). Where a beach is the primary focus for tourists, it may be called a beach resort. History Barcola, a holiday seaside resort in antiquity as well as in the 19th century with the Miramare Castle and later Heiligendamm in Mecklenburg (Germany), established in 1793, is the oldest seaside resort in continental Europe. Seaside resorts have existed since antiquity. In Roman times, the town of Baiae, by the Tyrrhenian Sea in Italy, was a resort for those who were sufficiently prosperous. Barcola in northern Italy, with its Roman luxury villas, is considered a special example of ancient leisure culture by the sea.Zeno Saracino: ‚ÄúPompei in miniatura‚Äù: la storia di ‚ÄúVallicula‚Äù o Barcola. In: Trieste All News, 29 September 2018. Mersea Island, in Essex, England was a seaside holiday destination for wealthy Romans living in Colchester. The development of the beach as a popular leisure resort from the mid-19th century was the first manifestation of what is now the global tourist industry. The first seaside resorts were opened in the 18th century for the aristocracy, who began to frequent the seaside as well as the then fashionable spa towns, for recreation and health. One of the earliest such seaside resorts was Scarborough in Yorkshire during the 1720s; it had been a popular spa town since a stream of acidic water was discovered running from one of the cliffs to the south of the town in the 17th century. The first rolling bathing machines were introduced by 1735. In 1793, Heiligendamm in Mecklenburg, Germany was founded as the first seaside resort of the European continent, which successfully attracted Europe's aristocracy to the Baltic Sea.Bradley, Kimberly. \\"A Spa Town Reclaims Its Glory,\\" New York Times. 3 June 2007. Brighton, The Front and the Chain Pier Seen in the Distance, early 19th century The opening of the resort in Brighton and its reception of royal patronage from King George IV extended the seaside as a resort for health and pleasure to the much larger London market, and the beach became a centre for upper-class pleasure and frivolity. This trend was praised and artistically elevated by the new romantic ideal of the picturesque landscape; Jane Austen's unfinished novel Sanditon is an example of that. Later, Queen Victoria's long- standing patronage of the Isle of Wight and Ramsgate in Kent ensured that a seaside residence was considered as a highly fashionable possession for those wealthy enough to afford more than one home. =Seaside resorts for the middle and working classes= The Blackpool Promenade c. 1898 The extension of this form of leisure to the middle and working classes began with the development of the railways in the 1840s; they offered cheap travel to fast-growing resort towns. In particular, the branch line to the small seaside town of Blackpool from Poulton-le-Fylde led to a sustained economic and demographic boom. A sudden influx of visitors arriving by rail motivated entrepreneurs to build accommodation and create new attractions, leading to more visitors and rapid growth throughout the 1850s and 1860s. The growth was intensified by the practice among the Lancashire cotton mill owners of closing the factories for a week every year to service and repair machinery. These became known as wakes weeks. Each town's mills would close for a different week, allowing Blackpool to manage a steady and reliable stream of visitors over a prolonged period in the summer. A prominent feature of the resort was the promenade and the pleasure piers, where an eclectic variety of performances vied for the people's attention. In 1863, the North Pier in Blackpool was completed, rapidly becoming a centre of attraction for elite visitors. Central Pier was completed in 1868, with a theatre and a large open-air dance floor.. Many popular beach resorts were equipped with bathing machines, because even the all-covering beachwear of the period was considered immodest. By the end of the century the English coastline had over 100 large resort towns, some with populations exceeding 50,000. =Expansion around the world= Seaside facade at Monte Carlo, 1870s The development of the seaside resort abroad was stimulated by the well-developed English love of the beach. The French Riviera on the Mediterranean had already become a destination for the British upper class by the end of the 18th century. In 1864, the first railway to Nice was completed, making the Riviera accessible to visitors from all over Europe. By 1874, foreign residents in Nice, mostly British, numbered 25,000. The coastline became renowned for attracting the royalty of Europe, including Queen Victoria and King Edward VII.Michael Nelson, Queen Victoria and the Discovery of the Riviera, Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2007. The Strandkorb became a symbol of seaside tourism by the end of the 19th century, especially on the southern Baltic Sea coast. In the United States, early seaside resorts in the late 1800s catered to the wealthy, including city businessmen. Cape May, New Jersey became one of the first coastal resorts in the United States, when regular steamboat traffic on the Delaware River began after the War of 1812. Early visitors to Cape May included Henry Clay in 1847, and Abraham Lincoln in 1849. By 1880, Henry Flagler had extended several rail lines southward down the US Atlantic coastline, enticing northern upper-class families south to subtropical Florida. The Florida East Coast Railway brought northern tourists to St. Augustine in greater numbers, and by 1887 Flagler began to build two large ornate hotels in St. Augustine, the 540-room Ponce de Leon Hotel and the Hotel Alcazar, and bought the Casa Monica Hotel the next year. Continental European attitudes towards gambling and nudity tended to be more lax than in Britain, and British and French entrepreneurs were quick to exploit the possibilities. In 1863, the Prince of Monaco, Charles III and Fran√ßois Blanc, a French businessman, arranged for steamships and carriages to take visitors from Nice to Monaco, where large luxury hotels, gardens and casinos were built. The place was renamed Monte Carlo. Commercial seabathing also spread to other areas of the United States and parts of the British Empire such as Australia, where surfing became popular in the early 20th century. By the 1970s cheap and affordable air travel was the catalyst for the growth of a truly global tourism market. Recreational fishing and leisure boat pursuits have recently become very lucrative, and traditional fishing villages are often well positioned to take advantage of this. For example, Destin, on the coast of Florida, has evolved from an artisanal fishing village into a seaside resort dedicated to tourism with a large fishing fleet of recreational charter boats.History of the World‚Äôs Luckiest Fishing Village The Destin Area Chamber of Commerce. Retrieved 21 April 2009. The tourist appeal of fishing villages has become so big that the Korean government is purpose-building 48 fishing villages for their tourist drawing power.Henderson J C (2002) \\"Tourism and Politics in the Korean Peninsula\\" The Journal of Tourism Studies, 13 (2).  Seasideness  Seasideness being displayed in Morecambe Seasideness is the distinct sense of place, or genius loci, associated with seaside resorts and as experienced by visitors to these coastal destinations.Jarratt, D.

(2016) The Coastal History Blog (#38): Sea Blindness, or Ocean Optimism? Available at: http://porttowns.port.ac.uk/blog38/#_ftnref5 Retrieved 29 June 2017. Seasideness is also reflected in the distinct built heritage and architecture of coastal resorts such as 19th century piers and early 20th century seaside modern buildings.Steele, J. (2016).

Designing the Seaside. London, Reaktion Books. The seaside experience, associated with seasideness, has also been associated with an emotional nostalgic reaction and feelings of wellbeing, which have in turn been connected to visitor appeal.Walton, J.K. (2000). The British seaside: Holidays and resorts in the twentieth century. Manchester, Manchester University Press.Jarratt, D. and Gammon, S. (2016).

The Seaside, Health and The Environment in England and Wales since 1800. Ashgate, Aldershot, UK. Seasideness can be traced back to research by a British academic, David Jarratt, and is summarised in Jarratt's (2015) peer- reviewed journal article entitled 'Sense of place at a British coastal resort: Exploring seasideness in Morecambe'. Jarratt links seasideness with feelings of wellness and especially nostalgia, which is explored in more detail in a joint-authored 2016 journal article. The research is case-study based and so there is a good deal of scope for further research in this area from human geographers, environmental / social psychologists, tourism scholars and other academics. Nevertheless, a connection with the sea lies at this heart of seasideness, and anecdotally it appears to be something shared by modern societies; it is a common theme in literature and the arts. The case-study centred on Morecambe, a once popular Lancastrian resort on the North-West coast of England, which saw a dramatic decline in visitor numbers in the late 20th century and regeneration at the start of the 21st century. One could argue that such resorts, like any destination, need to understand the motivation and experiences of visitors and this is one way in which an understanding of seasideness may be useful.

In German they are called Seebad (\\"Sea Spa\\") or Seeheilbad, sometimes with Ostsee- or Nordsee- as prefixes for the respective coastline. The most prestigious resorts can be found along the Baltic coastline, including the islands of Rugia and Usedom. They often feature a unique architectural style called resort architecture. The coast of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania alone has an overall length of 2000 km and is nicknamed German Riviera. Heiligendamm in Mecklenburg, established in 1793, is the oldest seaside resort in Germany and continental Europe.

Some of them are listed below: =India= India has a long coastline and hence has numerous beaches and resort towns. Beaches were already a popular tourist destination for the kings and the masses alike especially in South India where the Dravidian Empires built large temples near the seashore. Beaches are also associated with Hindu rituals where pilgrims from different parts of India go for worshipping rituals. The sun rise and Sunset are also associated with Hindu traditions which are considered sacred my many Hindu communities and there are festivals to celebrate the sunset and sunrise. A major example of such festivals is Chhath Puja. The British Raj also contributed in the development of Beach Resorts where Europeans used to visit during the harsh and cold winter of Europe. Major sea beaches can be found in large coastal cities of India like Mumbai and Chennai. The Marina Beach in Chennai is the longest unnatural beach in India. Apart from that, Juhu Beach in Mumbai and Kovalam Beach in Trivandrum are also famous. Beach resorts of Puri, Vishakhapatnam, Kochi, Kannur, Tuticorin, Mahabalipuram and Kanyakumari are equally famous. In the recent years, Goa has become a hotspot for beach resorts and hotels. Goa has numerous beaches and is very near to Mumbai and Pune and not very far from Bengaluru and Chennai making is a favourite destination for many. Goa is also a destination for Russian tourists. The archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep are also famous for beach resorts. Other beach resorts in India includes: * Digha * Bakkhali * Sagar Island * Kovalam * Kollam * Calangute * Canacona * Juhu * Puri * Visakhapatnam * Karaikal = Ireland = Bray, County Wicklow Kilkee Strand on the west coast of Ireland The 'Irish Riviera' on the South Coast of Ireland features the seaside resorts of Youghal, Ardmore, Dungarvan, C√≥bh and Ballycotton, all set close to the south coast of Ireland. Youghal has been a favoured holiday destination for over 100 years, situated on the banks of the River Blackwater as it reaches the sea. Youghal is well known for its beaches, having been, until 2008, the only town in the Republic of Ireland with two beaches awarded E.U. Blue Flag status. Dungarvan is a seaside market town beneath the mountains in the centre of the Irish south coast. Kinsale is often described as a food lover's and yachting town, with a diverse range of restaurants, as well as a large and active creative community with numerous art galleries and record and book shops. Seaside resorts in the East of Ireland developed after the introduction of rail travel. The Dublin and Kingstown Railway introduced day-trippers from Dublin to Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire) in South Dublin, and the coastal town became Ireland's first seaside resort. Other South Dublin towns and villages such as Sandycove, Dalkey and Killiney grew as seaside resorts when the rail network was expanded. Since the opening of Bray Daly Station in 1852, the County Wicklow coastal town of Bray has become the largest seaside resort on the East Coast of Ireland. The town of Greystones, five miles south of Bray, also grew as a seaside resort when the railway line was extended in 1855. Other seaside resorts include Courtown and Rosslare Strand in County Wexford. Ulster has a number of seaside resorts, such as Portrush, situated on the north coast, with its two beaches and a world-famous golf course, Royal Portrush Golf Club.Ranked as the third best course outside the United States by Golf Digest in 2007 Other Ulster seaside resorts are Newcastle, located on the east coast at the foot of the Mourne Mountains; Ballycastle; Portstewart; Rathmullan; Bundoran and Bangor. Bangor Marina is one of the largest in Ireland and the marina has on occasion been awarded the Blue Flag for attention to environmental issues. The main seaside towns in the west of Ireland are in Clare; the largest are Lahinch and Kilkee. Lahinch is a popular surfing location. Like British resorts, many seaside towns in Ireland have turned to other entertainment industries. Larger resorts such as Bray or Portrush host air shows, while most resorts host summer festivals. = Israel = Ein Bokek Israel is a major tourist area. Tourism in Israel is one of the major sources of income, with beautiful beaches, such as those found on the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.

Blackpool catered for workers from across industrial Northern England, who packed its beaches and promenade. Other northern seaside towns (for example Bridlington, Cleethorpes, Morecambe, Scarborough, Skegness, and Southport) shared in the success of this new concept, especially from trade during wakes weeks. The concept spread rapidly to other British coastal towns, including several on the coast of North Wales, notably Rhyl, and Llandudno, the largest resort in Wales and known as \\"The Queen of the Welsh Resorts\\", from as early as 1864.Ivor Wynne Jones. Llandudno Queen of Welsh Resorts (chapter 3 page 19) referring to the Liverpool Mercury As the 19th century progressed, British working class day-trippers travelled on organised trips such as railway excursions, or by steamer, for which long piers were erected so that the ships bringing the trade could berth. Another area notable for its seaside resorts was (and is) the Firth of Clyde, outside Glasgow. Glaswegians would take a ferry \\"doon the watter\\" from the city, down the River Clyde, to the Firth's islands and peninsulas and beyond, such as Cowal, Bute, Arran, and Kintyre. Resorts include Rothesay, Lamlash, Whiting Bay, Dunoon, Tighnabruaich, Carrick Castle, Helensburgh, Largs, Millport and Campbeltown. In contrast to many resorts, some on the Firth of Clyde have continued to prosper as middle-class commuter towns. Some resorts, especially those more southerly such as Hastings, Worthing, Eastbourne, Bournemouth and Brighton were built as new towns or extended by local landowners to appeal to wealthier holidaymakers. Others came about due to their proximity to large urban areas of population, such as Southend-on-Sea, which became increasingly popular with residents of London once rail links were established to it allowing day trips from London. The sunshine and sea air were seen by Victorians as beneficial for health, and resorts such as Ventnor owed their growth to a visit being considered as treatment for chest complaints. Owing to its generally better climate, the south coast has many seaside towns, the most being in Sussex. In the later 20th century, the popularity of the British seaside resort declined for the same reason that it first flourished: advances in transport. The greater accessibility of foreign holiday destinations, through package holidays and, more recently, European low-cost airlines, makes it easier to holiday abroad. Despite the loyalty of returning holidaymakers, resorts such as Blackpool have struggled to compete against the hotter weather of Southern Europe and the sunbelt in the United States. Now, many symbols of the traditional British resort (holiday camps, end-of-the-pier shows and saucy postcards) are regarded by some as drab and outdated; the skies are imagined to be overcast and the beach windswept. This is not always true; for example Broadstairs in Kent has retained much of its old world charm with Punch and Judy and donkey rides and still remains popular, being only one hour from the M25. Brighton has also seen a fall in visitor numbers over the past couple of years.

The cinemas and theatres often remain to become host to a number of pubs, bars, restaurants and nightclubs. Most of their entertainment facilities cater to local people, and the beaches are still popular in summer. Although international tourism turned people away from British seaside towns, it also brought in inward foreign travel; many seaside towns offer foreign language schools, the students of which often return to vacation and sometimes to settle. Many people can now afford more time off, and 'second holidays' and short breaks, resulting in increased tourism in British seaside towns. Many young people and students can take short holidays and discover the town's nightlife. Many seaside towns have large shopping centres which also attract people from a wide area. Day trippers still come to the coastal towns, but on a more local scale than during the 19th century. Many coastal towns are also popular retirement hotspots where older people reside permanently or take short breaks in the autumn months. Other English coastal towns have successfully sought to project a sense of their unique character. In particular, Southwold on the Suffolk coast is an active yet peaceful retirement haven with an emphasis on calmness, quiet countryside and jazz. Weymouth, Dorset offers itself as 'the gateway to the Jurassic Coast', Britain's only natural World Heritage Site. Newquay in Cornwall offers itself as the 'surfing capital of Britain', hosting international surfing events on its shores. Torbay in South Devon is known is also known as the English Riviera. Consisting of the towns of Torquay, Paignton with its pier and Brixham, the bay has 20 beaches and coves along its coastline, ranging from small secluded coves to the larger promenade-style seafronts of Torquay's Torre Abbey Sands and Paignton Sands. However, British seaside resorts have faced increasingly stiff competition from sunnier resorts overseas since the 1970s. In 1975, some 9,000 British families holidayed abroad, but by the mid-1980s that figure had risen to some 20,000. A decade later, it was around 30,000. This was largely due to the falling price of air travel which the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher (elected in 1979) had allowed. This decline is discussed in the Morrissey song 'Everyday Is Like Sunday' where daily life in the resort is likened to the emptiness of streets once associated with the shop closures on Sunday. = United States = With 3,800 miles (6100 km) of coastline, the USA mainland has hundreds of seaside resorts on three coasts, Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and Pacific ocean. Unlike in many smaller countries, the seaside resorts in the USA are located in various climate zones, with great differences in topography and environment. Many American seaside resorts are popular destination across the world, known for their climates, culture, and entertainment opportunities. American seaside resorts first developed near the big industrial cities on the upper East Coast like New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston. Cape May, New Jersey, and Provincetown, MA, were two of the first seaside resorts in the 1800s that catered to city workers in Philadelphia, New York and Boston. Cape May is often called Americas \\"first seaside resort\\". The early emergence of Cape May as a summer resort was due to easy transport by water from Philadelphia to the Atlantic Ocean. Early Cape May vacationers were carried to the town on sloops from Philadelphia, and water transport was also easy from New York, Baltimore, Washington, D.C. and points south. The resort business in Cape May began to thrive when regular steamboat traffic on the Delaware River began after the War of 1812. Early visitors to Cape May included Henry Clay in 1847, and Abraham Lincoln in 1849. Today, the Cape May Historic District is one of the largest and well preserved examples of Victorian architecture in the United States. On the southern Atlantic coast, Henry Flagler had the idea to make St. Augustine, Florida a winter resort. He built several rail lines south, and combined them with existing lines to create the Florida East Coast Railway in 1885. He built a railroad bridge over the St. Johns River in 1888, opening up the Atlantic coast of Florida to development. In 1887 Flagler began construction of two large ornate hotels in St. Augustine, the 540-room Ponce de Leon Hotel and the Hotel Alcazar, and bought the Casa Monica Hotel the next year. In Miami, Florida, the community of Cocoanut (now Coconut) Grove began development as a resort town in the 1880s with the building of the Bayview House (aka Peacock Inn) which closed in 1902. Visitors to the greater Miami area then flocked to Camp Biscayne (in Coconut Grove), the Royal Palm Hotel in Downtown Miami, and other resort hotels in Miami, as well as in smaller numbers to the Florida Keys. In 1894, the lavish Royal Poinciana Hotel opened in Palm Beach, Florida, with rave reviews from wealthy New York tourists who picked oranges in January to their delight. On the Gulf of Mexico, the City of Galveston was emerging as a booming city, and in 1882, architect Nicholas J. Clayton designed the Beach Hotel. By 1888, Galveston, TX was a wealthy city and booming seaside playground for wealthy New Orleans businessmen. On the Pacific coast in California, in April 1886, Babcock and Story created the Coronado Beach Company, which sought to develop Coronado as a seaside resort. In the mid-1880s, the San Diego region was in the midst of one of its first real estate booms. The Hotel del Coronado was built in March 1887, with Babcock's visions for the hotel built around a courtyard of tropical trees, shrubs and flowers, with a dining wing to give full value to the view of the ocean, bay and city. By 1915, more hotels were built along the Los Angeles coastline to serve the wealthy tourists and Hollywood film makers. In May 1926, brothers E.A. \\"Jack\\" Harter and T.D. \\"Til\\" Harter built the Hotel Casa del Mar in Santa Monica, at a cost of $2 million, creating one of the most successful beach clubs in Southern California, popular with socialites and Hollywood celebrities. In the 1920s, Carl Fisher was the main promoter of Miami Beach, and helped to develop the city as a seaside resort. To accommodate the wealthy tourists, several grand hotels were built, among them the Flamingo Hotel. In 1926, the massive The Breakers hotel in Palm Beach had been rebuilt, and there was a large northern tourist industry in coastal southern Florida. By the 1950s with increasing auto travel, more seaside resorts grew along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts, while small, declining industrial ports were being rebuilt. In 1954, the Fontainebleau Miami Beach, and was considered, (at that time) the most lavish seaside hotel in the world. In the modern era, hundreds of seaside resorts now string the Gulf, Atlantic, and Pacific coasts of the United States. Many Americans move with the seasons when they visit seaside resorts, vacationing in northern seaside areas in the warm season (April through October), and then moving to southern areas in the cold season (November through March). Many seaside resorts in Florida and California however, see travelers all year.

Cashman in 1984, at a workshop attended by individuals interested in using technology to support people in their work. At about this same time, in 1987 Dr. Charles Findley presented the concept of Collaborative Learning-Work..Findley, Charles A. 1989. Collaborative Learning-work. Presentation at the Pacific Telecommunications Council 1989 Conference, January 15‚Äì20, Honolulu, Hawaii.Collaborative Networked Learning Project ‚Äì Digital Equipment Corporation. Primary documents stored on Internet Archive According to Carstensen and Schmidt, CSCW addresses \\"how collaborative activities and their coordination can be supported by means of computer systems\\". On the one hand, many authors consider that CSCW and groupware are synonyms. On the other hand, different authors claim that while groupware refers to real computer-based systems, CSCW focuses on the study of tools and techniques of groupware as well as their psychological, social, and organizational effects. The definition of Wilson (1991) expresses the difference between these two concepts: Central concerns CSCW is a design- oriented academic field that is interdisciplinary in nature and brings together librarians, economists, organizational theorists, educators, social psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists and computer scientists, among others. The expertise of researchers in various and combined disciplines help researchers identify venues for possible development. Despite the variety of disciplines, CSCW is an identifiable research field focused on understanding characteristics of interdependent group work with the objective of designing adequate computer-based technology to support such cooperative work. Essentially, CSCW goes beyond building technology itself and looks at how people work within groups and organizations and the impacts of technology on those processes. CSCW has ushered in a great extent of melding between social scientists and technologists as developers work together to overcome both technical and non-technical problems within the same user spaces. For example, many R&D; professionals working with CSCW are computer scientists who have realized that social factors play an important role in the development of collaborative systems. On the flip side, many social scientists who understand the increasing role of technology in our social world become \\"technologists\\" who work in R&D; labs to develop cooperative systems. Over the years, CSCW researchers have identified a number of core dimensions of cooperative work. A non-exhaustive list includes: * Awareness: individuals working together need to be able to gain some level of shared knowledge about each other's activities. * Articulation work: cooperating individuals must somehow be able to partition work into units, divide it amongst themselves and, after the work is performed, reintegrate it. * Appropriation (or tailorability): how an individual or group adapts a technology to their own particular situation; the technology may be appropriated in a manner completely unintended by the designers. These concepts have largely been derived through the analysis of systems designed by researchers in the CSCW community, or through studies of existing systems (for example, Wikipedia). CSCW researchers that design and build systems try to address core concepts in novel ways. However, the complexity of the domain makes it difficult to produce conclusive results; the success of CSCW systems is often so contingent on the peculiarities of the social context that it is hard to generalize. Consequently, CSCW systems that are based on the design of successful ones may fail to be appropriated in other seemingly similar contexts for a variety of reasons that are nearly impossible to identify a priori. CSCW researcher Mark Ackerman calls this \\"divide between what we know we must support socially and what we can support technically\\" the socio-technical gap and describes CSCW's main research agenda to be \\"exploring, understanding, and hopefully ameliorating\\" this gap. Matrix the CSCW Matrix One of the most common ways of conceptualizing CSCW systems is to consider the context of a system's use. One such conceptualization is the CSCW Matrix, first introduced in 1988 by Johansen; it also appears in Baecker (1995). The matrix considers work contexts along two dimensions: first, whether collaboration is co-located or geographically distributed, and second, whether individuals collaborate synchronously (same time) or asynchronously (not depending on others to be around at the same time). =Same time/same place= Face to face interaction * Roomware * Shared tables, wall displays * Digital whiteboards * Electronic meeting systems * Single display groupware * Group Decision Support System =Same time/different place= Remote interaction * Electronic meeting systems * Videoconferencing * Real-time groupware * Messaging (instant messaging, email, chat) * Telephoning =Different time/same place= Continuous task (Ongoing task ) * Team rooms, * Large displays * Post-it * Warrooms =Different time/different place= Communication + Coordination * Electronic meeting systems * Blogs * Workflow * Version control There is a collaborative mode called multi-synchronous that can not fit the matrix. Challenges =Leadership= Generally, teams working in a CSCW environment need the same types of leadership as other teams. However, research has shown that distributed CSCW teams may need more direction at the time the group is formed than traditional working groups, largely to promote cohesion and liking among people who may not have as many opportunities to interact in person, both before and after the formation of the working group. =Adoption of groupware= Groupware goes hand in hand with CSCW. The term refers to software that is designed to support activities of a group or organization over a network and includes email, conferencing tools, group calendars, workflow management tools, etc. While groupware enables geographically dispersed teams to achieve organizational goals and engage in cooperative work, there are also many challenges that accompany use of such systems. For instance, groupware often requires users to learn a new system, which users may perceive as creating more work for them without much benefit. If team members are not willing to learn and adopt groupware, it is difficult (if not impossible) for the organization to develop the requisite critical mass for the groupware to be useful. Further, research has found that groupware requires careful implementation into a group setting, and product developers have not as yet been able to find the most optimal way to introduce such systems into organizational environments. On the technical side, networking issues with groupware often create challenges in using groupware for CSCW. While access to the Internet is becoming increasingly ubiquitous, geographically dispersed users still face challenges of differing network conditions. For instance, web conferencing can be quite challenging if some members have a very slow connection and others are able to utilize high speed connections. =Intergenerational groups= One of the recurring challenges in CSCW environments is development of an infrastructure that can bridge cross- generational gaps in virtual teams. Ideally, system designs will accommodate all team members, but orienting older workers to new CSCW tools can often be difficult. This can cause problems in virtual teams due to the necessity of incorporating the wealth of knowledge and expertise that older workers bring to the table with the technological challenges of new virtual environments. Orienting and retraining older workers to effectively utilize new technology can often be difficult, as they generally have less experience than younger workers with learning such new technologies. Advantages While CSCW working environments certainly face challenges, they also provide many advantages as well. For instance, teams that work together asynchronously provide members with the luxury to contribute when they want, from the location of their choosing, thus eliminating the need for members to \\"synchronize schedules\\". CSCW also allows employees with specific expertise to be a part of teams without the concern of geographic restraints.\\" CSCW can also result in major cost savings to companies who implement virtual teams and allow employees to work at home by eliminating the need for travel, rented office space, parking, electricity, office equipment, etc. Conversely, from the employee‚Äôs perspective, commuting costs and time associated with communing are also eliminated. Further, research has shown that the use of multiple communication threads can increase group participation and contribution from more team members and foster a more egalitarian communication structure. Along the same lines, text-based CSCW communication, such as email, allows users to keep a record of communication and can promote long-term collaboration and learning through observing others. Challenges in research =Differing meanings= Even within the CSCW field, researchers often rely on different journals, research, contextual factors and schools of thought, which can result in disagreement and confusion especially when common terms in the field are used in subtly different ways (\\"user\\", \\"implementation\\", etc.) Also, user requirements change over time and are often not clear to participants due to their evolving nature and the fact that requirements are always in flux. =Identifying user needs= Because organizations are so nuanced, CSCW researchers often have difficulty deciding which set(s) of tools will benefit a particular group. This is exacerbated by the fact that it is almost impossible to accurately identify user/group/organization needs and requirements because such needs and requirements inevitably change through the introduction of the system itself. Even when researchers study requirements through several iterations, such requirements often change and evolve yet again by the time that researchers have completed a particular iteration of inquiry. =Evaluation and measurement= The range of disciplinary approaches leveraged in implementing CSCW systems makes CSCW difficult to evaluate, measure, and generalize to multiple populations. Because researchers evaluating CSCW systems often bypass quantitative data in favor of naturalistic inquiry, results can be largely subjective due to the complexity and nuances of organizations themselves. Possibly as a result of the debate between qualitative and quantitative researchers, three evaluation approaches have emerged in the literature examining CSCW systems. However, each approach faces its own unique challenges and weaknesses: Methodology-oriented frameworks explain the methods of inquiry available to CSCW researchers without providing guidance for selecting the best method for a particular research question or population. Conceptual frameworks provide guidelines for determining factors that a researcher should consider and evaluate through CSCW research but fail to link conceptual constructs with methodological approaches. Thus, while researchers may know what factors are important to their inquiry, they may have difficulty understanding which methodologies will result in the most informative findings. Concept-oriented frameworks provide specific advice for studying isolated aspects of CSCW but lack guidance as to how specific areas of study can be combined to form more comprehensive insight. Conferences Since 2010, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has hosted a yearly conference on CSCW. From 1986-2010, it was held biannually. The conference is currently held in October or November and features research in the design and use of technologies that affect organizational and group work. With the rapidly increasing development of new devices that allow collaboration from different locations and contexts, CSCW seeks to bring together researchers from across academia and industry to discuss the many facets of virtual collaboration from both social and technical perspectives. Internationally, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) sponsors the International Conference on Computer Supported Work in Design, which takes place yearly. In addition, the European Society for Socially Embedded Technologies sponsors the European Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, which has been held every two years since 1989. CSCW panels are a regular component of conferences of the adjacent field of Science and Technology Studies.

Often nicknamed the \\"Blonde Bombshell\\" and the \\"Platinum Blonde\\", she was popular for her \\"Laughing Vamp\\" screen persona. Harlow was in the film industry for only nine years, but she became one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood, whose image in the public eye has endured. In 1999, the American Film Institute ranked Harlow 22 on their greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema list. Harlow was first signed by business magnate Howard Hughes, who directed her first major role in Hell's Angels (1930). After a series of critically unsuccessful films, and Hughes's losing interest in her career, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer bought out Harlow's contract in 1932 and cast her in leading roles in a string of hits built on her comedic talent: Red-Headed Woman (1932), Red Dust (1932), Dinner at Eight (1933), Reckless (1935) and Suzy (1936). Harlow's popularity rivaled and then surpassed that of MGM's top leading ladies Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer. She died at the age of 26, of kidney failure during filming of Saratoga. MGM completed the film with the use of body doubles and released it less than two months after her death; it became the highest-grossing picture of 1937.  Early life  Harlow was born as Harlean Harlow Carpenter in a house located at 3344 Olive Street in Kansas City, Missouri. Her father, Mont Clair Carpenter (1877‚Äì1974), son of Abraham L. Carpenter and Dianna (n√©e Beal), was a dentist who attended dental school in Kansas City. He was from a working-class background. Harlow with her mother in 1934 Her mother, Jean Poe Carpenter (n√©e Harlow; 1891‚Äì1958), was the daughter of wealthy real estate broker Skip Harlow and his wife, Ella Harlow (n√©e Williams). In 1908, her father arranged her marriage to Mont Clair Carpenter. She was underage at the time and grew resentful and unhappy in the marriage, but they remained together living in a Kansas City house owned by her father. Harlean was called \\"The Baby\\", a nickname she was accustomed to that endured for the rest of her life. It was not until she was five years old that she learned her real name was Harlean, when staff and students at Miss Barstow's Finishing School for Girls used the name. Harlean was always very close to her mother, who was extremely protective and was reported to have instilled a sense in her daughter that she owed everything she had to her; \\"She was always all mine!\\", Mama Jean said of her daughter in interviews. (Jean Carpenter was later known by \\"Mama Jean\\" when Harlean achieved star status as Jean Harlow.) When Harlean was at school, her mother filed for a divorce. On September 29, 1922, the uncontested divorce was finalized, giving sole custody of Harlean to her mother. Although Harlean loved her father, she did not see him often before her untimely death and he outlived her by thirty- seven years. In 1923, the 34-year-old Jean Carpenter took her daughter and moved to Hollywood in hopes of becoming an actress, but was told that she was too old to begin a film career. Harlean was enrolled at the Hollywood School for Girls, where she met Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Joel McCrea, and Irene Mayer Selznick, but dropped out at the age of 14, in the spring of 1925. With their finances dwindling, Jean and Harlean moved back to Kansas City after Skip Harlow issued an ultimatum that he would disinherit his daughter if they did not return. Several weeks later, Skip sent his granddaughter to summer camp at Camp Cha-Ton-Ka, in Michigamme, Michigan, where she became ill with scarlet fever. Jean Carpenter traveled to Michigan to care for Harlean, rowing herself across the lake to the camp, but was told that she could not see her daughter. Harlean next attended the Ferry Hall School (now Lake Forest Academy) in Lake Forest, Illinois. Jean Carpenter had an ulterior motive for her daughter's attendance at this particular school: It was close to the Chicago home of her boyfriend, Marino Bello. During Harlean's freshman year at the school, she was paired with a \\"big sister\\" from the senior class who introduced her to 19-year-old Charles \\"Chuck\\" Fremont McGrew, an heir to a large fortune. By the fall of 1926, Harlean and Chuck were dating seriously, and they were married in 1927. Jean Carpenter was also married that same year to Marino Bello, on January 18. However, Harlean did not attend her mother's wedding. In 1928, the McGrews left Chicago and moved to Beverly Hills. Chuck McGrew turned 21 two months after the marriage and received part of his large inheritance. The couple moved to Los Angeles, settling into a home in Beverly Hills where Harlean thrived as a wealthy socialite. McGrew hoped to distance Harlean from her mother with the move. Neither Chuck nor Harlean worked during this time, and both were considered heavy drinkers.  Career  =1928‚Äì1929: Work as an extra= While living in Los Angeles, Harlean befriended a young aspiring actress named Rosalie Roy. Not owning a car herself, Rosalie asked Harlean to drive her to Fox Studios for an appointment. While waiting for Rosalie, Harlean was noticed and approached by Fox executives, whom she told she was not interested. Nevertheless, she was given letters of introduction to Central Casting. A few days later, Rosalie Roy bet Harlean that she did not have the nerve to go in for an audition. Unwilling to lose a wager and pressed by her enthusiastic mother who had followed her daughter to Los Angeles by this time, Harlean went to Central Casting and signed in under her mother's maiden name, Jean Harlow. After several calls from casting and a number of rejected job offers by Harlean, Mother Jean finally pressed her into accepting work at the studio. Harlean appeared in her first film, Honor Bound (1928), as an unbilled \\"extra\\" for $7 a day and a box lunch, common pay for such work. This led to a wage increase to $10 per day and small parts in feature films such as Moran of the Marines (1928) and the Charley Chase lost film Chasing Husbands (1928). In December 1928, Harlean as Jean Harlow signed a five-year contract with Hal Roach Studios for $100 per week. She had small roles in the 1929 Laurel and Hardy shorts: Double Whoopee, Liberty and Bacon Grabbers, with the latter giving her a costarring credit. Jean Arthur, Clara Bow, Harlow, and Leone Lane in The Saturday Night Kid, in which Harlow had her first speaking part In March 1929, she parted with Hal Roach, who tore up her contract after Harlow told him, \\"It's breaking up my marriage, what can I do?\\" In June 1929, Harlow separated from her husband and moved in with Mother Jean and Bello. After her separation from McGrew, Harlow continued working as an \\"extra\\" in such films as This Thing Called Love, Close Harmony, and The Love Parade (all 1929), until she landed her first speaking role in the Clara Bow film The Saturday Night Kid. Harlow and her husband divorced in 1929. =1929‚Äì1932: Platinum blonde star= In late 1929, Harlow was spotted by Ben Lyon, an actor filming Howard Hughes' Hell's Angels; another account gives Angels head cameraman Arthur Landau as the man that spotted and suggested her to Hughes. Hughes was reshooting most of his originally silent film with sound and needed an actress to replace Greta Nissen, whose Norwegian accent was undesirable for her character. Harlow screen-tested for Hughes, who gave her the part and signed her to a five-year, $100-per-week contract on October 24, 1929. During filming, Harlow met MGM executive Paul Bern. Harlow and Ben Lyon in Hell's Angels (1930), her first major film appearance Hell's Angels premiered in Hollywood at Grauman's Chinese Theatre on May 27, 1930, and became the highest-grossing film of that year, besting even Greta Garbo's talkie debut in Anna Christie. Hell's Angels made Harlow an international star. Though she was popular with audiences, the critics were less than enthusiastic. The New Yorker called her performance \\"plain awful\\", though Variety magazine conceded, \\"It doesn't matter what degree of talent she possesses ... nobody ever starved possessing what she's got.\\" In spite of her relative success with Hell's Angels, Harlow again found herself in the role of \\"uncredited extra\\" in the Charlie Chaplin film City Lights (1931), though her appearance did not make the final cut. With no other projects planned for Harlow at the time, Hughes decided to send her to New York, Seattle, and Kansas City for Hell's Angels premieres. In 1931, his Caddo Company loaned her out to other studios, where she gained more attention by appearing in The Secret Six, with Wallace Beery and Clark Gable; Iron Man, with Lew Ayres and Robert Armstrong; and The Public Enemy, with James Cagney. Even though the successes of these films ranged from moderate to hit, Harlow's acting ability was mocked by critics. Hughes sent her on a brief publicity tour in order to bolster her career, but this was not a success as Harlow dreaded making personal appearances. Harlow briefly dated Abner Zwillman, who bought her a jeweled bracelet and a red Cadillac, and made a large cash loan to studio head Harry Cohn to obtain a two-picture deal for her at Columbia Pictures. The relationship ended when he reportedly referred to her in derogatory and vulgar terms when speaking to other associated crime figures, as revealed in secret surveillance recordings. Columbia Pictures' first cast Harlow in a Frank Capra film with Loretta Young, originally titled Gallagher for Young's lead character but renamed Platinum Blonde to capitalize on Hughes' publicity of Harlow's \\"platinum\\" hair color. Though Harlow denied her hair was bleached, the platinum blonde color was reportedly achieved with a weekly application of ammonia, Clorox bleach, and Lux soap flakes. This process weakened and damaged Harlow's naturally ash-blonde hair. Many female fans began dyeing their hair to match hers and Hughes' team organized a series of \\"Platinum Blonde\\" clubs across the nation offering a prize of $10,000 to any beautician who could match Harlow's shade. No one could, and the prize went unclaimed, but the publicity scheme worked and the \\"Platinum Blonde\\" nickname stuck with Harlow. Her second film for that studio was Three Wise Girls (1932), with Mae Clarke and Walter Byron. Paul Bern then arranged with Hughes to borrow her for MGM's The Beast of the City (1932), co-starring Walter Huston. After filming, Bern booked a 10-week personal-appearance tour on the East Coast. To the surprise of many, especially Harlow herself, she packed every theater in which she appeared, often appearing in a single venue for several nights. Despite critical disparagement and poor roles, Harlow's popularity and following were large and growing, and in February 1932, the tour was extended by six weeks. According to Fay Wray, who played Ann Darrow in RKO Pictures's King Kong (1933), Harlow was the original choice to play the screaming blonde heroine, but was under an exclusive contract with MGM during the film's pre-production phase‚Äîand the part went to Wray, a brunette who had to wear a blonde wig. When mobster Benjamin \\"Bugsy\\" Siegel came to Hollywood to expand casino operations, Harlow became the informal godmother of Siegel's eldest daughter, Millicent, when the family lived in Beverly Hills. =1932‚Äì1937: Successful actress at MGM= Paul Bern was now romantically involved with Harlow and spoke to Louis B. Mayer about buying out her contract with Hughes and signing her to MGM, but Mayer declined. MGM's leading ladies were presented as elegant, and Harlow's screen persona was not so to Mayer. Bern then began urging close friend Irving Thalberg, production head of MGM, to sign Harlow, noting her popularity and established image. After initial reluctance Thalberg agreed, and on March 3, 1932, Harlow's 21st birthday, Bern called her with the news that MGM had purchased her contract from Hughes for $30,000. Harlow officially joined the studio on April 20, 1932. Harlow received recognition as an actress in Red-Headed Woman, her first MGM film; she wore a red wig for the role. At MGM, Harlow was given superior movie roles to show off her looks and nascent comedic talent. Though her screen persona changed dramatically during her career, one constant was her sense of humor. In 1932, she starred in the comedy Red-Headed Woman for which she received $1,250 a week. It was the first film in which she \\"resembles something of an actress\\", portraying a woman who is successful at being amoral in a film that does not moralize or punish the character for her behavior. The film is often noted as being one of the few films in which Harlow did not appear with platinum blonde hair; she wore a red wig for the role. While Harlow was filming Red-Headed Woman, actress Anita Page passed her on the studio lot without acknowledging her. She later told Page that the snub had caused her to cry until she saw herself, noticed the red wig, and burst out laughing when she realized Page had not recognized her. \\"That shows you how sensitive she was\\", Page said. \\"She was a lovely person in so many ways.\\"Ankerich, Michael G. The Sound of Silence: Conversations with 16 Film and Stage Personalities. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, 1998. p. 190. She next starred in Red Dust, her second film with Clark Gable. Harlow and Gable worked well together and co-starred in a total of six films. She was also paired multiple times with Spencer Tracy and William Powell. MGM began trying to distinguish Harlow's public persona from her screen characters by putting out press releases that her childhood surname was not the common 'Carpenter' but the chic 'Carpenti√©r', claiming that writer Edgar Allan Poe was one of her ancestors and publishing photographs of her doing charity work to change her image to that of an all-American woman. This transformation proved difficult; once, Harlow was heard muttering, \\"My God, must I always wear a low-cut dress to be important?\\" During the making of Red Dust, Bern‚Äîher husband of two months‚Äîwas found dead at their home; this created a lasting scandal. Initially, Harlow was suspected of killing Bern, but his death was officially ruled a suicide by self-inflicted gunshot wound. Louis B. Mayer feared negative publicity from the incident and intended to replace Harlow in the film, offering the role to Tallulah Bankhead. Bankhead was appalled by the offer and wrote in her autobiography, \\"To damn the radiant Jean for the misfortune of another would be one of the shabbiest acts of all time. I told Mr. Mayer as much.\\" Harlow kept silent, survived the ordeal, and became more popular than ever. A 2009 biography of Bern asserted that Bern was, in fact, murdered by a former lover and the crime scene re-arranged by MGM executives to make it appear Bern had killed himself. After Bern's death, Harlow began an indiscreet affair with boxer Max Baer who, though separated from his wife Dorothy Dunbar, was threatened with divorce proceedings naming Harlow as a co- respondent for alienation of affection, a legal term for adultery. After Bern's death, the studio did not want another scandal and defused the situation by arranging a marriage between Harlow and cinematographer Harold Rosson. Rosson and Harlow were friends, and Rosson went along with the plan. They quietly divorced eight months later. Harlow with Clark Gable in 1933's Hold Your Man, another successful film pairing of the two and box office success for MGM By 1933, MGM realized the value of the Harlow-Gable team and paired them again in Hold Your Man (1933), which was also a box-office success. In the same year, she played the adulterous wife of Wallace Beery in the all-star comedy-drama Dinner at Eight, and played a pressured Hollywood film star in the screwball comedy Bombshell with Lee Tracy. The film has been said to be based on Harlow's own life or that of 1920s \\"It girl\\" Clara Bow. The following year, she was teamed with Lionel Barrymore and Franchot Tone in The Girl from Missouri (1934). The film was the studio's attempt to soften Harlow's image, but suffered from censorship problems, so much so that its original title, Born to Be Kissed, had to be changed. After the financial success of Red Dust and Hold Your Man, MGM cast Harlow with Clark Gable in two more successful films: China Seas (1935), with Wallace Beery and Rosalind Russell; and Wife vs. Secretary (1936), with Myrna Loy and James Stewart. Stewart later spoke of a scene in a car with Harlow in Wife vs. Secretary, saying, \\"Clarence Brown, the director, wasn't too pleased by the way I did the smooching. He made us repeat the scene about half a dozen times ... I botched it up on purpose. That Jean Harlow sure was a good kisser. I realized that until then, I had never been really kissed.\\" From 1933 onward, Harlow was consistently voted one of the strongest box office draws in the United States, often outranking her female colleagues at MGM in audience popularity polls. Reckless (1935) was her first movie musical. It co-starred her then-boyfriend William Powell and Franchot Tone. When her character sings in the movie, the voice is that of skilled vocalist Virginia Verrill. By the mid-1930s, Harlow was one of the biggest stars in the United States, and, it was hoped, MGM's next Greta Garbo. Still young, her star continued to rise while the popularity of other female stars at MGM, such as Garbo, Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer, waned. Harlow's movies continued to make huge profits at the box office even during the middle of the Depression. After her third marriage ended in 1934, Harlow met William Powell, another MGM star, and quickly fell in love. The couple were reportedly engaged for two years, but differences that ranged from past marriages to Powell's uncertainty about the future, kept them from publicly formalizing their relationship. MGM also liked the box office of the attainable, single Harlow. Suzy (1936), in which she played the title role, gave her top billing over Franchot Tone and Cary Grant. While critics noted that Harlow dominated the film, it was a reasonable box-office success. She then starred in Riffraff (1936) with Spencer Tracy and Una Merkel, a financial disappointment, and the worldwide hit Libeled Lady (1936), in which she was top-billed over Powell, Myrna Loy, and Tracy. She then filmed W.S. Van Dyke's comedy Personal Property (1937), co-starring Robert Taylor. It was Harlow's final completed motion picture appearance.  Illness and death  On January 30, 1937, Harlow stands beside alt= In January 1937, Harlow and Robert Taylor traveled to Washington, D.C., to take part in fundraising activities associated with President Franklin D. Roosevelt's birthday, for the organization later known as the March of Dimes. The trip was physically taxing for Harlow, and she contracted influenza. She recovered in time to attend the Academy Awards ceremony with William Powell. Filming for Harlow's final film, Saratoga, co-starring Clark Gable, was scheduled to begin in March 1937. However, production was delayed when she developed sepsis after a multiple wisdom tooth extraction, and had to be hospitalized. Almost two months later, Harlow recovered, and shooting began on April 22, 1937. On May 20, 1937, during the filming of Saratoga, Harlow began to complain of illness. Her symptoms‚Äîfatigue, nausea, fluid retention and abdominal pain‚Äîdid not seem very serious to her doctor, who believed that she was suffering from cholecystitis and influenza. Unfortunately, the doctor was not aware that Harlow had been ill during the previous year with a severe sunburn and influenza. Her friend and co-star, Una Merkel, noticed Harlow's gray pallor, fatigue and weight gain on the set of Saratoga. On May 29, 1937, Harlow filmed a scene in which the character she was playing had a fever. Harlow was clearly sicker than her character. She leaned against her co-star Gable between scenes and said, \\"I feel terrible! Get me back to my dressing room.\\" Harlow requested that the assistant director telephone William Powell, who immediately left his own movie set, in order to escort Harlow back home. Jack Conway and Clark Gable on the set of Saratoga was taken only minutes before Harlow's collapse and was issued at the time her death was announced.alt= The next day, Powell checked on Harlow and discovered that her condition had not improved. He contacted her mother and insisted that she cut her holiday short to come be at her daughter's side. Powell also summoned a doctor. Because Harlow's previous illnesses had delayed the shooting of three movies (Wife vs. Secretary, Suzy, and Libeled Lady), initially there was no great concern regarding Harlow's latest bout with a recurring illness. On June 2, 1937, it was announced that Harlow was again suffering from influenza. Dr. Ernest Fishbaugh, who had been called to Harlow's home to treat her, diagnosed her with an inflamed gallbladder. Harlow felt better on June 3, 1937, and co-workers expected her back on the set by Monday, June 7, 1937. Press reports were contradictory, with headlines reading \\"Jean Harlow seriously ill\\" and \\"Harlow recovers from illness crisis\\". Clark Gable, who visited Harlow during this time, later remarked that she was severely bloated and that he smelled urine on her breath when he kissed her ‚Äî both signs of kidney failure. Dr. Leland Chapman, a colleague of Fishbaugh, was called in to give a second opinion on Harlow's condition. Chapman recognized that she was not suffering from an inflamed gallbladder, but was in the final stages of kidney failure. On June 6, 1937, Harlow said that she could not see Powell clearly and could not tell how many fingers he was holding up. That evening, she was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, where she slipped into a coma. The next day at 11:37 a.m., Harlow died in the hospital at the age of 26. In the doctor's press releases, the cause of death was given as cerebral edema, a complication of kidney failure. Hospital records mention uremia. For years, rumors circulated about Harlow's death. Some claimed that her mother had refused to call a doctor because she was a Christian Scientist or that Harlow had declined hospital treatment or surgery. alt=Harlow's bed in the Jean Harlow Museum in Black Canyon City, Arizona From the onset of her illness, Harlow had been attended by a doctor while she was resting at home. Two nurses also visited her house, and various equipment was brought from a nearby hospital. Harlow's grayish complexion, recurring illnesses, and severe sunburn were signs of the disease. Toxins also adversely affected her brain and central nervous system. She had suffered from scarlet fever when she was 15. Speculation that Harlow suffered a poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis following the scarlet fever incident, which may have caused high blood pressure and ultimately kidney failure, has been suggested. Harlow's death certificate gives the causes of her death as \\"acute respiratory infection\\", \\"acute nephritis\\", and \\"uremia\\".Jean Harlow death certificate, autopsyfiles.org; accessed November 12, 2016. One of the MGM writers later said, \\"The day Baby died...there wasn't one sound in the commissary for three hours.\\" Spencer Tracy wrote in his diary, \\"Jean Harlow died today. Grand gal.\\" MGM closed on the day of her funeral, June 9, 1937. Harlow was interred in the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale in a private room of multicolored marble, which William Powell bought for $25,000 (). She was laid to rest in the gown she wore in Libeled Lady; in her hands she had a white gardenia and a note that Powell had written: \\"Goodnight, my dearest darling.\\" Harlow's inscription reads, \\"Our Baby\\". Spaces in the same room were reserved for Harlow's mother and Powell. Harlow's mother was buried there in 1958, but Powell married actress Diana Lewis in 1940. After his death in 1984, he was cremated and his ashes buried in Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California. MGM planned to replace Harlow in Saratoga with either Jean Arthur or Virginia Bruce, but due to public objections the film was finished using three doubles (Mary Dees for close-ups, Geraldine Dvorak for long shots, and Paula Winslowe for dubbing Harlow's lines) and rewriting some scenes without her. The film was released on July 23, 1937, less than two months after Harlow's death, and was a hit with audiences, becoming the highest-grossing film of 1937.  Legacy  Harlow's Hollywood Walk of Fame star Her name was given to a cocktail, the \\"Jean Harlow\\", which is equal parts light rum and sweet vermouth. Legendary blues musician Lead Belly (Huddie William Leadbetter; 1888 ‚Äì 1949) wrote the song \\"Jean Harlow\\" while in prison upon hearing about her death. The French composer Charles Koechlin composed the piece √âpitaphe de Jean Harlow (opus 164) in 1937. On February 8, 1960, Jean Harlow was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6910 Hollywood Boulevard on the south part of the Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, California. Harlow's signature, hands and footprints were imprinted in cement on September 29, 1933, in the 24th ceremony at Grauman's Chinese Theater and are located near the forecourt on the west side of the box office at 6925 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood, CA. A woman's hair color is described as \\"Harlow gold\\" in the first line of Kim Carnes' 1981 hit song \\"Bette Davis Eyes\\", and is one of sixteen Hollywood icons named in Madonna's 1990 hit song \\"Vogue\\" in the rap lyrics: \\"Harlow, Jean, Picture of a beauty queen.\\"  Novel  Harlow wrote a novel titled Today is Tonight. In Arthur Landau's introduction to the 1965 paperback edition, Harlow stated in around 1933‚Äì1934 her intention to write the book, but it was not published during her lifetime. During her life, Harlow's stepfather Marino Bello shopped the unpublished manuscript around to a few studios. Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, had prevented the book from being sold by putting an injunction on it using a clause in Harlow's contract: her services as an artist can't be used without MGM's permission. After her death, Landau writes, her mother sold the film rights to MGM, though no film was made. The publication rights were passed from Harlow's mother to a family friend, and the book was finally published in 1965.  Film portrayals  Film adaptations of Harlow's life were considered at different times during the 1950s. Twentieth Century-Fox had slated Jayne Mansfield for the role and ideas for Columbia Pictures actress Cleo Moore to play Harlow were also tabled. These projects never materialized. Actress Marilyn Monroe was given a Harlow script in 1953, however, she turned down the part of her idol, feeling it was underdeveloped. In 1965, two films about Jean Harlow were released, both titled Harlow. The first film was released by Magna in May 1965, and stars Carol Lynley. The second was released in June 1965 by Paramount Pictures and stars Carroll Baker. Both were poorly received and did not perform well at the box office.Parish p. 238 In 1978, Lindsay Bloom portrayed her in Hughes and Harlow: Angels in Hell. In August 1993, Sharon Stone hosted a documentary about Harlow titled Harlow: The Blonde Bombshell, which aired on Turner Classic Movies. In 2004, Gwen Stefani briefly appeared as Harlow in Martin Scorsese's Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator.  Filmography   References   Sources      Further reading  * Pascal, John.

Don, and dom, is derived from the Latin Dominus: a master of a household, a title with background from the Roman Republic in classical antiquity. With the abbreviated form having emerged as such in the Middle Ages, traditionally it is reserved for Catholic clergy and nobles, in addition to certain educational authorities and persons of distinction. The female equivalent is Do√±a (), Donna (), and Dona (), abbreviated D.¬™, Da., or simply D. It is a common honorific reserved for women, such as the First Lady of Brazil. In Portuguese \\"Dona\\" tends to be less restricted in use to women than \\"Dom\\" is to men. Usage =General= Although originally a title reserved for royalty, select nobles, and church hierarchs, it is now often used as a mark of esteem for a person of personal, social or official distinction, such as a community leader of long standing, a person of significant wealth, or a noble, but may also be used ironically. As a style, rather than a title or rank, it is used with, rather than in place of, a person's name. Syntactically, it is used in much the same way (although for a broader group of persons) as \\"Sir\\" and \\"Dame\\" are used in English when speaking of or to a person who has been knighted, e.g. \\"Don Firstname\\" or \\"Do√±a Firstname Lastname\\". Unlike \\"The Honourable\\" in English, Don may be used when speaking directly to a person, and unlike \\"Mister\\" it must be used with a given name. For example, \\"Don Diego de la Vega,\\" or (abbreviating \\"se√±or\\") \\"Sr. Don Diego de la Vega,\\" or simply \\"Don Diego\\" (the secret identity of Zorro) are typical forms. But a form like \\"Don de la Vega\\" is not correct and would never be used by Spanish speakers. \\"Se√±or de la Vega\\" should be used instead. Today in the Spanish language, Do√±a is used to respectfully refer to a mature lady. Today in the Americas, and in Mexican-American communities, the title Don or Do√±a is used in honorific form when addressing a senior citizen. In some countries, Don or Do√±a may be used as a generic honorific, similar to Sir and Madam in the American South. =Religion= It is used in English for certain Benedictine (including some communities which follow the Rule of St. Benedict) and Carthusian monks, and for members of certain communities of Canons Regular. Examples include Benedictine monks of the English Benedictine Congregation (e.g. Dom John Chapman, late Abbot of Downside). Since the Second Vatican Council, the title can be given to any monk (lay or ordained) who has made a solemn profession. The equivalent title for a nun is \\"Dame\\" (e.g. Dame Laurentia McLachlan, late Abbess of Stanbrook, or Dame Felicitas Corrigan, author). As a varia, an article by Dom Aidan Bellenger about Buckfast Abbey was published on 2 June 2018 in The Tablet, Britain's leading Catholic journal. However, by editorial error the article was attributed to ‚ÄúDominic Aidan Bellenger‚Äù.The Tablet, 2 June 2018, page 9 It is not the only time that this former Abbot of Downside's honorific has been misconstrued. =Academia= United Kingdom Don is also a title given to fellows and tutors of a college or university, especially traditional collegiate universities such as Oxford and Cambridge in England,For background information and opinion, see a recently published selection of short articles by Cambridge don Mary Beard: It's a Don's Life, London: Profile, 2009. and Trinity College, Dublin, in Ireland. Like the don used for Roman Catholic priests, this usage derives from the Latin dominus, meaning \\"lord\\", a historical remnant of Oxford and Cambridge having started as ecclesiastical institutions in the Middle Ages. The earliest use of the word in this sense appears, according to the New English Dictionary, in Souths Sermons (1660). An English corruption, \\"dan\\", was in early use as a title of respect, equivalent to master. The particular literary application to poets is due to Edmund Spenser's use of \\"Dan Chaucer, well of English undefiled.\\" Canada At some universities in Canada, such as the University of King's College and the University of New Brunswick, a don is the senior head of a university residence. At these institutions, a don is typically a faculty member, staff member, or postgraduate student, whose responsibilities in the residence are primarily administrative. The don supervises their residence and a team of undergraduate resident assistants, proctors, or other student employees. In other Canadian institutions, such as Huron College and the University of Toronto, a don is a resident assistant, typically an upper-year student paid a stipend to act as an advisor to and supervisor of the students in a university residence. United States At Sarah Lawrence College, faculty advisors are referred to as \\"dons\\". Dons meet regularly with students to plan a course of study. The \\"Don\\" is also an official mascot of the athletic teams of the University of San Francisco and Spanish Fork High School =In popular culture= In North America, Don has also been made popular by films depicting the Mafia, such as The Godfather series, where the crime boss is given by his associates the same signs of respect that were traditionally granted in Italy to nobility. However, the honorific followed by the last name (e.g. Don Corleone, Don Barzini, etc.) would be used in Italy for priests only: the proper Italian respectful form (\\"Don Firstname\\") is similar to the Castilian Spanish form. This title has in turn been applied by the media to real-world Mafia figures, such as the nickname \\"Teflon Don\\" for John Gotti.  Spanish- speaking countries and territories  Historically, don was used to address members of the nobility, e.g. hidalgos, as well as members of the secular clergy. The treatment gradually came to be reserved for persons of the blood royal, and those of such acknowledged high or ancient aristocratic birth as to be noble de Juro e Herdade, that is, \\"by right and heredity\\" rather than by the king's grace. However, there were rare exemptions to the rule, such as the mulatto Miguel Enr√≠quez, who received the distinction from Philip V due to his privateering work in the Caribbean. But by the twentieth century it was no longer restricted in use even to the upper classes, since persons of means or education (at least of a \\"bachiller\\" level), regardless of background, came to be so addressed and, it is now often used as if it were a more formal version of Se√±or, a term which was also once used to address someone with the quality of nobility (not necessarily holding a nobiliary title). This was, for example, the case of military leaders addressing Spanish troops as \\"se√±ores soldados\\" (gentlemen-soldiers). = Spain = During the reign of King Juan Carlos of Spain from 1975 until his abdication as monarch on 19 June 2014, he was titled Su Majestad [S.M.] el Rey Juan Carlos (His Majesty King Juan Carlos). Following the abdication, Juan Carlos and his wife are titled, according to the Royal Household website, S.M. el Rey Don Juan Carlos (H.M. King Juan Carlos) and S.M. la Reina Do√±a Sof√≠a (H.M. Queen Sof√≠a)‚Äîthe same as during his reign, with the honorific Don/Do√±a prefixed to the names. Juan Carlos' successor is S.M. el Rey Felipe VI.Website of Royal Household of Spain, La Familia Real, post-abdication  Sephardi Jews  The honorific was also used among Ladino-speaking Sephardi Jews, as part of the Spanish culture which they took with them after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492. = Latin America = The honorific title Don is widely used in the Americas. This is the case of the Mexican New Age author Don Miguel √Ångel Ruiz, the Chilean television personality Don Francisco, and the Puerto Rican industrialist and politician Don Luis Ferr√©, among many other figures. The title Don is considered highly honorific, more so than, for example, academic titles such as \\"Doctor\\" or than political titles such as \\"Governor.\\" For example, although Puerto Rican politician Pedro Albizu Campos had a doctoral degree, he has been titled Don. Likewise, Puerto Rican Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n has often been called Don Lu√≠s Mu√±oz Marin instead of Governor Mu√±oz Marin.Primera Hora (Electronic Edition of the El Nuevo Dia newspaper). Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Senate Resolution 937. February 11, 2010. In the same manner, Don Miguel √Ångel Ruiz is an M.D.Additionally the honorific is usually used with people of older age. The same happens in other Latin American countries. For example, despite having a doctoral degree in Theology, the Paraguayan dictator Jos√© Gaspar Rodr√≠guez de Francia was usually styled as \\"Don\\". Likewise, despite being a respected military commander with the rank of Brigade General, Argentine Ruler Juan Manuel de Rosas was formally and informally styled \\"Don\\" as a more important title. Prior to the American conquest of the Southwest, a number of Americans immigrated to California, where they often became Mexican citizens and changed their given names to Spanish equivalents, for example \\"Juan Temple\\" for Jonathan Temple. It was common for them to assume the honorific \\"don\\" once they had attained a significant degree of distinction in the community. = Philippines = In the Spanish Colonial Philippines, the honorific title was reserved to the nobility, the DatuFor more information about the social system of the Indigenous Philippine society before the Spanish colonization confer Barangay in Enciclopedia Universal Ilustrada Europea-Americana, Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, S. A., 1991, Vol. VII, p.624. known as the Principal√≠a, whose right to rule was recognised by Philip II on 11 June 1594. Similar to Latin America, the title Don is considered highly honorific,The use of the honorific addresses \\"Don\\" and \\"Do√±a\\" was strictly limited to what many documents during the colonial period would refer to as \\"vecinas y vecinos distinguidos\\". An example of a document of the Spanish colonial government mentioning the \\"vecinos distinguidos\\" is the 1911 Report written by R. P. Fray Agapito Lope, O.S.A. (parish priest of Banate, Iloilo in 1893) on the state of the Parish of St. John the Baptist in this town in the Philippines. The second page identifies the \\"vecinos distinguidos\\" of the Banate during the last years of the Spanish rule. The original document is in the custody of the Monastery of the Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines in Valladolid, Spain. Cf. Fray Agapito Lope 1911 Manuscript, p. 1. Also cf. Fray Agapito Lope 1911 Manuscript, p. 2.. In these documents, Spanish Friars would place \\"D\\" (Don) before the name of a Filipino notable, and \\"Da\\" (Dona) before the name of a filipina notable. more so than academic titles such as \\"Doctor\\" political titles such as \\"Governor.\\" and even titled knights with \\"Sir\\". Usage was retained during the American Colonisation. Although the traditional positions of the Principal√≠a (e.g., Gobernadorcillo, Cabeza de Barangay, etc.) were replaced by American political positions such as Municipal President, etc. When the Americans appointed local officials at the onset of their rule, like the Spaniards they also acknowledged the ruling class. In the list of the municipal leaders, American documents placed the traditional Spanish title of these local notables - the title of \\"Don\\". Cf. Annual report of the Philippine Commission / Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department to the President of the United States, Washington D.C.: 1901, Vol. I, p. 130. But slowly, however, the practice faded after the World War II, as children of Principal√≠a often did not carry on the title, and when the leaders were no longer appointed, but chosen through popular election. Prior to the electoral regime, which started in 1954,Cf. Jennifer Franco, Heyday of Casique Democracy (1954-1972) in Elections and Democratization in the Philippines, 2001: New York, Routledge, Chapter 3. the appointment of Mayors were done by the President of the Republic of the Philippines, pursuant to Commonwealth Act No. 158 amending Commonwealth Act No. 57. Section 8 of Commonwealth Act No. 158, as amended by Republic Act No. 276.Sample of an actual document, dated 25 July 1953, attesting that Mayors used to be appointed.  Italy  Officially, Don was the honorific for a principe or a duca (and any legitimate, male-line descendant thereof) who was a member of the nobility (as distinct from a reigning prince or duke, who was generally entitled to some form of the higher style of Altezza). This was how the style was used in the Almanach de Gotha for extant families in its third section. The last official Italian nobility law (abrogated 1948) stated that the style belonged to members of the following groups: * those whose main title was principe or duca; * those who had a special grant; * those to whom it had been recognized by the former Lombardy (Duchy of Milan); or * those from the Kingdom of Sardinia who bore either a title of hereditary knight or of the titled nobility (whatever the main title of the family). Ordinamento dello stato nobiliare italiano (Statute of Italian nobility condition) approved by Royal Decree 651 dated 7 June 1943: art. 39. When opening the link, click on Statuto e Elenco Nobiliare Sardo on the left and then on the Ordinamento itself (second link). Genealogical databases and dynastic works still reserve the title for this class of noble by tradition, although it is no longer a right under Italian law. In practice, however, the style Don/Donna (or Latin Dominus/Domina) was used more loosely in church, civil and notarial records. The honorific was often accorded to the untitled gentry (e.g., knights or younger sons of noblemen), priests, or other people of distinction. It was, over time, adopted by organized criminal societies in Southern Italy (including Naples, Sicily, and Calabria) to refer to members who held considerable sway within their hierarchies. Today in Italy, the title is usually only given to Roman Catholic diocesan priests (never to prelates, who bear higher honorifics such as monsignore, eminenza, and so on). In Sardinia, until recently it was commonly used for nobility (whether titled or not), but it is being presently used mainly when the speaker wants to show that he knows the don's condition of nobility. Outside of the priesthood or old nobility, usage is still common in the south, mostly as an honorific form to address the elderly, but it is rarely, if ever, used in central or northern Italy. It can be used satirically or ironically to lampoon a person's sense of self-importance. Don is prefixed either to the full name or to the person's given name. The form \\"Don Lastname\\" for crime bosses (as in Don Corleone) is an American custom. In southern Italy, mafia bosses are addressed as \\"Don Firstname\\" by other mafiosi and sometimes their victims as well, while the press usually refers to them as \\"Firstname Lastname\\", without the honorific. Priests are the only ones to be referred as \\"Don Lastname\\", although when talking directly to them they are usually addressed as \\"Don Firstname\\", which is also the most common form used by parishioners when referring to their priest. Portuguese-speaking countries and territories The usage of Dom was a prerogative of princes of royal blood and also of other individuals to whom it had been granted by the sovereign. In most cases, the title was passed on through the male line. Strictly speaking, only females born of a nobleman bearing the title Dom would be addressed as Dona, but the style was not heritable through daughters. The few exceptions depended solely on the conditions upon which the title itself had been granted. A well-known exception is the descent of Dom Vasco da Gama. There were many cases, both in Portugal and Brazil, in which the title of Dom (or Dona) was conceded to, and even bought by, people who were not from royalty. In any case, when the title was officially recognized by the proper authority, it became part of the name. In Portugal and Brazil, Dom () is used for certain higher members hierarchs, such as superiors, of the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches. In Catholic religious orders, such as the Order of Saint Benedict, it is also associated with the status of Dom Frater. Dom is similarly used as an honorific for Benedictine monks within the Benedictine Order throughout France and the English speaking world, such as the famous Dom P√©rignon. In France, it is also used within the male branch of the Carthusian Order. It is also employed for laymen who belong to the royal and imperial families (for example the House of Aviz in Portugal and the House of Braganza in Portugal and Brazil). It was also accorded to members of families of the titled Portuguese nobility. Unless ennobling letters patent specifically authorised its use, Dom was not attributed to members of Portugal's untitled nobility: Since hereditary titles in Portugal descended according to primogeniture, the right to the style of Dom was the only apparent distinction between cadets of titled families and members of untitled noble families. In the Portuguese language, the feminine form, Dona (or, more politely, Senhora Dona), has become common when referring to a woman who does not hold an academic title. It's commonly used to refer to First Ladies, although it is less common for female politicians. Croatia Within the Catholic Church, the prefix Don is usually used for the diocesan priests with their first name, as well as veleƒçasni (The Reverend).

Creation  Clarence Kelley and his wife ran a dance school for children, which taught the \\"Waltz Clog\\", a popular and easy-to-learn tap dance routine. This routine, however, proved too difficult for the younger students to master. To solve this problem, George Sanders wrote The Teapot Song, which required minimal skill and encouraged natural pantomime. Both the song and its accompanying dance, the \\"Teapot Tip\\", became enormously popular in America and overseas. \\"I'm a Little Teapot\\" was recorded and made famous by Art Kassel and His Kassels in the Air orchestra with featured vocalist Marion Holmes singing the tune.

The nature of the regime evolved and changed during its existence. Months after the start of the Spanish Civil War in July 1936, Franco emerged as the dominant rebel military leader and was proclaimed head of state on 1 October 1936, ruling a dictatorship over the territory controlled by the Nationalist faction. The 1937 Unification Decree, which merged all parties supporting the rebel side, led to Nationalist Spain becoming a single-party regime under the FET y de las JONS. The end of the war in 1939 brought the extension of the Franco rule to the whole country and the exile of Republican institutions. The Francoist dictatorship originally took a form described as \\"fascistized dictatorship\\", or \\"semi-fascist regime\\", showing clear influence of fascism in fields such as labor relations, the autarkic economic policy, aesthetics, and the single-party system.; Cap√≠tulo V As time went on, the regime opened up and became closer to developmental dictatorships, although it always preserved residual fascist trappings.¬´La ausencia de un ideario definido le permiti√≥ transitar de unas f√≥rmulas dictatoriales a otras, rozando el fascismo en los cuarenta y a las dictaduras desarrollistas en los sesenta¬ª., cap. ¬´El franquismo como dictadura¬ª.¬´La tesis defendida por Payne en dicho dossier puede sintetizarse con estas palabras: ¬ª Glicerio Sanchez Recio. En torno a la Dictadura franquista Hispania Nova During the Second World War, Spain did not join the Axis powers (its supporters from the civil war, Italy and Germany). Nevertheless, Spain supported them in various ways throughout most of the war while maintaining its neutrality. Because of this, Spain was isolated by many other countries for nearly a decade after World War II, while its autarkic economy, still trying to recover from the civil war, suffered from chronic depression. The 1947 Law of Succession made Spain a de jure kingdom again but defined Franco as the head of state for life with the power to choose the person to become King of Spain and his successor. Reforms were implemented in the 1950s and Spain abandoned autarky, reassigned authority from the Falangist movement, which had been prone to isolationism, to a new breed of economists, the technocrats of Opus Dei. This led to massive economic growth, second only to Japan, that lasted until the mid-1970s, known as the \\"Spanish miracle\\". During the 1950s the regime also changed from being openly totalitarian and using severe repression to an authoritarian system with limited pluralism.Payne (2000), p. 645 As a result of these reforms, Spain was allowed to join the United Nations in 1955 and during the Cold War Franco was one of Europe's foremost anti-communist figures: his regime was assisted by the Western powers, particularly the United States. Franco died in 1975 at the age of 82. He restored the monarchy before his death and made his successor King Juan Carlos I, who would lead the Spanish transition to democracy. Establishment On 1 October 1936, Franco was formally recognised as Caudillo of Spain‚Äîthe Spanish equivalent of the Italian Duce and the German F√ºhrer‚Äîby the Junta de Defensa Nacional (National Defense Council), which governed the territories occupied by the Nationalists.Paul Preston, Chapter 6 \\"The Making of a Caudillo\\" in Franco: A Biography (1993), pp. 171‚Äì198 In April 1937, Franco assumed control of the Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS, then led by Manuel Hedilla, who had succeeded Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, who was executed in November 1936 by the Republican government. He merged it with the Carlist Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista to form the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS. The sole legal party of Francoist Spain, it was the main component of the Movimiento Nacional (National Movement).Preston (1993), Chapter 10. \\"The Making of a Dictator: Franco and the Unification April 1937\\", pp. 248‚Äì274 The Falangists were concentrated at local government and grassroot level, entrusted with harnessing the Civil War's momentum of mass mobilisation through their auxiliaries and trade unions by collecting denunciations of enemy residents and recruiting workers into the trade unions.√Ångela Cenarro Lagunas, \\"Historia y Memoria del Auxilio Social de Falange\\" in Pliegos de Juste 11‚Äì12 (2010), pp. 71‚Äì74 While there were prominent Falangists at a senior government level, especially before the late 1940s, there were higher concentrations of monarchists, military officials and other traditional conservative factions at those levels. However, the Falange remained the sole party. The Francoists took control of Spain through a comprehensive and methodical war of attrition (guerra de desgaste) which involved the imprisonment and executions of Spaniards found guilty of supporting the values promoted by the Republic: regional autonomy, liberal or social democracy, free elections and women's rights, including the vote.Helen Graham, \\"The memory of murder: mass killing, incarceration and the making of Francoism\\" in War Memories, Memory Wars. Political Violence in Twentieth-Century SpainFranco's description: \\"The work of pacification and moral redemption must necessarily be undertaken slowly and methodically, otherwise military occupation will serve no purpose\\". Roberto Cantalupo, Fu la Spagna: Ambasciata presso Franco: de la guerra civil, Madrid, 1999: pp. 206‚Äì208. The right-wing considered these \\"enemy elements\\" to comprise an \\"anti-Spain\\" that was the product of Bolsheviks and a \\"Judeo-Masonic conspiracy\\". The latter allegation pre-dated Falangism, having evolved after the Reconquista of the Iberian Peninsula from the Islamic Moors. The Reconquista had formally ended with the Alhambra Decree of 1492, which ordered the expulsion of Jews from Spain.Alejandro Quiroga, Making Spaniards, p. 58. Palgrave, 2007 At the end of the Spanish Civil War, according to the regime's own figures there were more than men and women held in prisons and some had fled into exile. Large numbers of those captured were returned to Spain or interned in Nazi concentration camps as stateless enemies. Between six and seven thousand exiles from Spain died in Mauthausen. It has been estimated that more than Spaniards died in the first years of the dictatorship from 1940 to 1942 as a result of political persecution, hunger and disease related to the conflict.The Splintering of Spain, pp. 2‚Äì3 Cambridge University Press, Spain's strong ties with the Axis resulted in its international ostracism in the early years following World War II as Spain was not a founding member of the United Nations and did not become a member until 1955.See Member states of the United Nations. This changed with the Cold War that soon followed the end of hostilities in 1945, in the face of which Franco's strong anti-communism naturally tilted its regime to ally with the United States. Independent political parties and trade unions were banned throughout the duration of the dictatorship.The Splintering of Spain, p. 4. Cambridge University Press Nevertheless, once decrees for economic stabilisation were put forth by the late 1950s, the way was opened for massive foreign investment‚Äî\\"a watershed in post-war economic, social and ideological normalisation leading to extraordinarily rapid economic growth\\"‚Äîthat marked Spain's \\"participation in the Europe-wide post-war economic normality centred on mass consumption and consensus, in contrast to the concurrent reality of the Soviet bloc\\".The Splintering of Spain, p. 7 On 26 July 1947, Spain was declared a kingdom, but no monarch was designated until in 1969 Franco established Juan Carlos of Bourbon as his official heir-apparent. Franco was to be succeeded by Luis Carrero Blanco as Prime Minister with the intention of continuing the Francoist regime, but those hopes ended with his 1973 assassination by the Basque separatist group ETA. With the death of Franco on 20 November 1975, Juan Carlos became the King of Spain. He initiated the country's subsequent transition to democracy, ending with Spain becoming a constitutional monarchy with an elected parliament and autonomous devolved governments. Government After Franco's victory in 1939, the Falange was declared the sole legally sanctioned political party in Spain and it asserted itself as the main component of the National Movement. In a state of emergency-like status, Franco ruled with, on paper, more power than any Spanish leader before or since. He was not even required to consult his cabinet for most legislation.Payne, p. 231-234 According to historian Stanley G. Payne, Franco had more day-to-day power than Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin possessed at the respective heights of their power. Payne noted that Hitler and Stalin at least maintained rubber-stamp parliaments, while Franco dispensed with even that formality in the early years of his rule. According to Payne, the lack of even a rubber-stamp parliament made Franco's government \\"the most purely arbitrary in the world.\\"Payne, p. 323. The 100-member National Council of the Movement served as a makeshift legislature until the passing of the organic law of 1942 and the Ley Constitutiva de las Cortes (Constituent Law of the Cortes) the same year, which saw the grand opening of the Cortes Espa√±olas on 18 July 1942. The Organic Law made the government ultimately responsible for passing all laws, while defining the Cortes as a purely advisory body elected by neither direct nor universal suffrage. The Cortes had no power over government spending, and the government was not responsible for it; ministers were appointed and dismissed by Franco alone as the \\"Chief\\" of state and government. The Ley del Referendum Nacional (Law of the National Referendum), passed in 1945 approved for all \\"fundamental laws\\" to be approved by a popular referendum, in which only the heads of families could vote. Local municipal councils were appointed similarly by heads of families and local corporations through local municipal elections while mayors were appointed by the government. It was thus one of the most centralised countries in Europe and certainly the most centralised in Western Europe following the fall of the Portuguese Estado Novo in the Carnation Revolution. The referendum law was used twice during Franco's rule‚Äîin 1947, when a referendum revived the Spanish monarchy with Franco as de facto regent for life with sole right to appoint his successor; and in 1966, another referendum was held to approve a new \\"organic law\\", or constitution, supposedly limiting and clearly defining Franco's powers as well as formally creating the modern office of Prime Minister of Spain. By delaying the issue of republic versus monarchy for his 36-year dictatorship and by refusing to take up the throne himself in 1947, Franco sought to antagonise neither the monarchical Carlists (who preferred the restoration of a Bourbon) nor the republican \\"old shirts\\" (original Falangists). Franco ignored the claim to the throne of Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona, son of the last king, Alfonso XIII, who designated him as his heir; Franco found him too liberal. In 1961, Franco offered Otto von Habsburg the throne, but was refused and ultimately followed Otto's recommendation by selecting in 1969 the young Juan Carlos of Bourbon, son of Infante Juan, as his officially designated heir to the throne, shortly after his 30th birthday (the minimum age required under the Law of Succession). In 1973, due to old age and to lessen his burdens in governing Spain he resigned as Prime Minister and named Navy Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco to the said post, but Franco remained as the Chief of State, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces and Jefe del Movimiento (Chief of the Movement). However, Carrero Blanco was assassinated in the same year and Carlos Arias Navarro became the country's new Prime Minister. Armed forces During the first year of peace, Franco dramatically reduced the size of the Spanish Army‚Äîfrom almost one million at the end of the Civil War to in early 1940, with most soldiers two- year conscripts. Concerns about the international situation, Spain's possible entry into World War II and threats of invasion led him to undo some of these reductions. In November 1942, with the Allied landings in North Africa and the German occupation of France bringing hostilities closer than ever to Spain's border, Franco ordered a partial mobilization, bringing the army to over men. The Air Force and Navy also grew in numbers and in budgets to airmen and sailors by 1945, although for fiscal reasons Franco had to restrain attempts by both services to undertake dramatic expansions. The army maintained a strength of about men until the end of the Second World War. Colonial empire and decolonisation Spain attempted to retain control of the last remnants of its colonial empire throughout Franco's rule. During the Algerian War (1954‚Äì1962), Madrid became the base of the Organisation arm√©e secr√®te right- wing French Army group which sought to preserve French Algeria. Despite this, Franco was forced to make some concessions. When the French protectorate in Morocco became independent in 1956, Spain surrendered its Spanish protectorate in Morocco to Mohammed V, retaining only a few exclaves, the Plazas de soberan√≠a. The year after, Mohammed V invaded Spanish Sahara during the Ifni War (known as the \\"Forgotten War\\" in Spain). Only in 1975, with the Green March and the military occupation, did Morocco take control of all of the former Spanish territories in the Sahara. In 1968, under United Nations pressure Franco granted Spain's colony of Equatorial Guinea its independence and the next year ceded the exclave of Ifni to Morocco. Under Franco, Spain also pursued a campaign to gain sovereignty of the British overseas territory of Gibraltar and closed its border in 1969. The border would not be fully reopened until 1985. Francoism Initially the regime embraced the definition of \\"Totalitarian State\\" or the \\"nacional-sindicalista\\" label. Following the defeat of Fascism in much of Europe in WW2, was the new moniker the regime adopted for itself, yet it only sounded credible to staunch believers. Other later soft definitions include \\"authoritarian regime\\" or \\"constituent or developmental dictatorship\\", the latter having inner backing from within the regime. During Cold War, Juan Jos√© Linz, either accused of whitewashing the regime or being praised as the elaborator of \\"the first scientific conceptualization\\" of the regime, famously early characterized it as an \\"authoritarian regime with limited pluralism\\". The Francoist regime has been described by other scholars as a \\"Fascismo a la espa√±ola\\" (\\"Spanish-style Fascism\\") or as a specific variant of Fascism marked by the preponderance of the Catholic Church, the Armed Forces and Traditionalism. While the regime evolved along with its protracted history, the primitive essence of it‚Äîunderpinned by the legal concentration of all powers into a single person, Francisco Franco, \\"Caudillo of Spain by the Grace of God\\", embodying national sovereignty and \\"only responsible before God and History\\"‚Äîremained. The consistent points in Francoism included above all authoritarianism, Anti- Communism, Spanish nationalism, national Catholicism, monarchism, militarism, national conservatism, anti-Masonry, anti-Catalanism, pan-Hispanism, and anti- liberalism‚Äîsome authors also include integralism.Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p 31, and Paul Preston, \\"The Theorists of extermination\\" essay in Unearthing Franco's Legacy, pp 42‚Äì67 University of Notre Dame Press Stanley Payne, a scholar of Spain notes that \\"scarcely any of the serious historians and analysts of Franco consider the generalissimo to be a core fascist\\".Payne, Stanley Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977, p. 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin PressLaqueur, Walter Fascism: Past, Present, Future, p. 13, 1997 Oxford University Press US According to historian Walter Laqueur \\"during the Civil War, Spanish fascists were forced to subordinate their activities to the nationalist cause. At the helm were military leaders such as General Francisco Franco, who were conservatives in all essential respects. When the civil war ended, Franco was so deeply entrenched that the Falange stood no chance; in this strongly authoritarian regime, there was no room for political opposition. The Falange became junior partners in the government and, as such, they had to accept responsibility for the regime's policy without being able to shape it substantially\\".Fascism: Past, Present, Future. Google Books. The United Nations Security Council voted in 1946 to deny the Franco regime recognition until it developed a more representative government.Michael Burleigh, Sacred Causes, p. 316, 2006, HarperPress, ; see also United Nations Security Council Resolution 7 =Development= The Falange Espa√±ola de las JONS, a fascist party formed during the Republic, soon transformed itself into the framework of reference in the National Movement. In April 1937, the Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista (Traditionalist Spanish Phalanx and of the Councils of National Syndicalist Offensive) was created from the absorption of the Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista (Traditionalist Communion) by the Falange Espa√±ola de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional Sindicalista, which itself was the result of an earlier absorption of the Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista by Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera's Falange Espa√±ola. This party, often referred to as Falange, became the sole legal party during Franco's regime, but the term \\"party\\" was generally avoided, especially after World War II, when it was commonly referred to as the \\"National Movement\\" or just as \\"the Movement\\". =Fascism and Authoritarianism= The main point of those scholars that tend to consider the Spanish State to be authoritarian rather than fascist is that the FET-JONS were relatively heterogeneous rather than being an ideological monolith.De Menses, Filipe Ribeiro Franco and the Spanish Civil War, p. 87, RoutledgeGilmour, David, The Transformation of Spain: From Franco to the Constitutional Monarchy, p. 7 1985 Quartet BooksPayne, Stanley Fascism in Spain, 1923‚Äì1977, p. 347, 476 1999 Univ. of Wisconsin PressLaqueur, Walter Fascism: Past, Present, Future p. 13 1996 Oxford University Press After World War II, the Falange opposed free capital markets, but the ultimately prevailing technocrats, some of whom were linked with Opus Dei, eschewed syndicalist economics and favoured increased competition as a means of achieving rapid economic growth and integration with wider Europe.\\"The Franco Years: Policies, Programs, and Growing Popular Unrest.\\" A Country Study: Spain The Spanish State was authoritarian: Non-government trade unions and all political opponents across the political spectrum were either suppressed or controlled by all means, including police repression. Most country towns and rural areas were patrolled by pairs of Guardia Civil, a military police for civilians, which functioned as a chief means of social control. Larger cities, and capitals, were mostly under the heavily armed Polic√≠a Armada, commonly called grises due to their grey uniforms. Franco was also the focus of a personality cult, which taught that he had been sent by Divine Providence to save the country from chaos and poverty. Members of the oppressed ranged from Catholic trade unions to communist and anarchist organisations to liberal democrats and Catalan or Basque separatists. The Confederaci√≥n Nacional del Trabajo (CNT) and the Uni√≥n General de Trabajadores (UGT) trade unions were outlawed and replaced in 1940 by the corporatist Sindicato Vertical. The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and the Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) party were banned in 1939 while the Communist Party of Spain (PCE) went underground. University students seeking democracy revolted in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which was repressed by the grises. The Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) went into exile and in 1959 the armed separatist group ETA was created to wage a low-intensity war against Franco. Like others at the time, Franco evinced a concern about a possible Masonic and Judaic conspiracy against his regime. Franco continued to personally sign all death warrants until just months before he died despite international campaigns requesting him to desist. =Spanish nationalism= Francoist demonstration in Salamanca in 1937 Franco's Spanish nationalism promoted a unitary national identity by repressing Spain's cultural diversity. Bullfighting and flamencoRoman, Mar. \\"Spain frets over future of flamenco.\\" 27 October 2007. Associated Press. were promoted as national traditions, while those traditions not considered Spanish were suppressed. Franco's view of Spanish tradition was somewhat artificial and arbitrary: while some regional traditions were suppressed, Flamenco, an Andalusian tradition, was considered part of a larger, national identity. All cultural activities were subject to censorship and many were forbidden entirely, often in an erratic manner. This cultural policy relaxed over time, most notably in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Franco was reluctant to enact any form of administrative and legislative decentralisation and kept a fully centralised form of government with a similar administrative structure to that established by the House of Bourbon and General Miguel Primo de Rivera. These structures were modelled after the centralised French state. As a result of this type of governance, government attention and initiatives were irregular and often depended more on the goodwill of government representatives than on regional needs. Thus inequalities in schooling, health care or transport facilities among regions were patent: historically affluent regions like Madrid, Catalonia or the Basque Country fared much better than others such as Extremadura, Galicia or Andalusia. Franco eliminated the autonomy granted by the Second Spanish Republic to the regions and abolished the centuries-old fiscal privileges and autonomy (the fueros) in two of the three Basque provinces: Guipuzcoa and Biscay, which were officially classified as \\"traitor regions\\". The fueros were kept in the third Basque province, Alava, and also in Navarre, a former kingdom during the Middle Ages and the cradle of the Carlists, possibly due to the region's support during the Civil War. Franco also used language politics in an attempt to establish national homogeneity. Despite Franco himself being Galician, the government revoked the official statute and recognition for the Basque, Galician and Catalan languages that the Republic had granted them for the first time in the history of Spain. The former policy of promoting Spanish as the only official language of the state and education was resumed, even though millions of the country's citizens spoke other languages. The legal usage of languages other than Spanish was forbidden: all government, notarial, legal and commercial documents were to be drawn up exclusively in Spanish and any written in other languages were deemed null and void. The use of any other language was forbidden in schools, advertising, religious ceremonies and on-road and shop signs. Publications in other languages were generally forbidden, though citizens continued to use them privately. During the late 1960s, these policies became more lenient yet non-Castilian languages continued to be discouraged and did not receive official status or legal recognition. Additionally, the popularisation of the compulsory national educational system and the development of modern mass media, both controlled by the state and exclusively in Spanish, reduced the competency of speakers of Basque, Catalan and Galician. =Roman Catholicism= Although Franco himself was previously known for not being very devout, his regime often used religion as a means to increase its popularity throughout the Catholic world, especially after the Second World War. Franco himself was increasingly portrayed as a fervent Catholic and a staunch defender of Roman Catholicism, the declared state religion. The regime favoured very conservative Roman Catholicism and it reversed the secularisation process that had taken place under the Republic. According to historian Julian Casanova, \\"the symbiosis of religion, fatherland and Caudillo\\" saw the Church assume great political responsibilities, \\"a hegemony and monopoly beyond its wildest dreams\\" and it played \\"a central role in policing the country's citizens\\". Franco with Catholic Church dignitaries in 1946 The Law of Political Responsibility of February 1939 turned the Church into an extralegal body of investigation as parishes were granted policing powers equal to those of local government officials and leaders of the Falange. Some official jobs required a \\"good behaviour\\" statement by a priest. According to historian Julian Casanova, \\"the reports that have survived reveal a clergy that was bitter because of the violent anti-clericalism and the unacceptable level of secularisation that Spanish society had reached during the republican years\\" and the law of 1939 made the priests investigators of peoples' ideological and political pasts.Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p. 108 - 115 The authorities encouraged denunciations in the workplace. For example, Barcelona's city hall obliged all government functionaries to \\"tell the proper authorities who the leftists are in your department and everything you know about their activities\\". A law passed in 1939 institutionalised the purging of public offices.Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.103 The poet Carlos Barral recorded that in his family \\"any allusion to republican relatives was scrupulously avoided; everyone took part in the enthusiasm for the new era and wrapped themselves in the folds of religiosity\\". Only through silence could people associated with the Republic be relatively safe from imprisonment or unemployment. After the death of Franco, the price of the peaceful transition to democracy would be silence and \\"the tacit agreement to forget the past\\", which was given legal status by the 1977 Pact of forgetting. Civil marriages that had taken place in the Republic were declared null and void unless they had been validated by the Church, along with divorces. Divorce, contraception and abortions were forbidden, yet enforcement was inconsistent. Children had to be given Christian names. Franco was made a member of the Supreme Order of Christ by Pope Pius XII whilst Spain itself was consecrated to the Sacred Heart. The Catholic Church's ties with the Franco dictatorship gave it control over the country's schools and crucifixes were once again placed in schoolrooms. After the war, Franco chose Jos√© Ib√°√±ez Mart√≠n, a member of the National Catholic Association of Propagandists, to lead the Ministry of Education. He held the post for 12 years, during which he finished the task of purging the ministry begun by the Commission of Culture and Teaching headed by Jos√© Mar√≠a Pem√°n. Pem√°n led the work of Catholicizing state-sponsored schools and allocating generous funding to the Church's schools.Unearthing Franco's Legacy p. 112 Romualdo de Toledo, head of the National Service of Primary Education, was a traditionalist who described the model school as \\"the monastery founded by Saint Benedict\\". The clergy in charge of the education system sanctioned and sacked thousands of teachers of the progressive left and divided Spain's schools up among the families of falangists, loyalist soldiers and Catholic families. In some provinces, like Lugo, practically all the teachers were dismissed. This process also affected tertiary education, as Ib√°√±ez Mart√≠n, Catholic propagandists and the Opus Dei ensured professorships were offered only to the most faithful.Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p.113 Franco visiting the Basilica of Saint Mary of the Chorus in San Sebasti√°n The orphaned children of \\"Reds\\" were taught in orphanages run by priests and nuns that \\"their parents had committed great sins that they could help expiate, for which many were incited to serve the Church\\". Francoism professed a strong devotion to militarism, hypermasculinity and the traditional role of women in society. A woman was to be loving to her parents and brothers, faithful to her husband and to reside with her family. Official propaganda confined women's roles to family care and motherhood. Most progressive laws passed by the Second Republic were declared void. Women could not become judges, or testify in the trial. They could not become university professors. In the 1960s and 1970s, there was increasing liberalization, yet such measures would continue until Franco's death. In 1947, Franco proclaimed Spain a monarchy through the Ley de Sucesi√≥n en la Jefatura del Estado act, but did not designate a monarch. He had no particular desire for a king because of his strained relations with the legitimist heir to the Crown, Juan of Bourbon. Therefore, he left the throne vacant with himself as regent and set the basis for his succession. This gesture was largely done to appease monarchist factions within the Movement. At the same time, Franco wore the uniform of a captain- general (a rank traditionally reserved for the King), resided in the Royal Palace of El Pardo, appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a canopy and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were Jefe del Estado (Head of State) and General√≠simo de los Ej√©rcitos Espa√±oles (Generalissimo of the Spanish Armies), he was referred to as Caudillo of Spain, by the Grace of God. Por la Gracia de Dios is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in absolute monarchies and had been used only by monarchs before. The long-delayed selection of Juan Carlos of Bourbon as Franco's official successor in 1969 was an unpleasant surprise for many interested parties as Juan Carlos was the rightful heir for neither the Carlists nor the Legitimists. Narrative of the Civil War For nearly twenty years after the war, Francoist Spain presented the conflict as a crusade against Bolshevism in defence of Christian civilization. In Francoist narrative, authoritarianism had defeated anarchy and overseen the elimination of \\"agitators\\", those \\"without God\\" and the \\"Judeo-Masonic conspiracy\\". Since Franco had relied on thousands of North African soldiers, anti-Islamic sentiment \\"was played down but the centuries- old myth of the Moorish threat lay at the base of the construction of the \\"communist menace\\" as a modern-day Eastern plague\\".Michael Richards, Unearthing Franco's Legacy, p. 129. The official position was therefore that the wartime Republic was simply a proto-Stalinist monolith, its leaders intent on creating a Spanish Soviet satellite. Many Spanish children grew up believing the war was fought against foreigners and the painter Julian Grau Santos has said \\"it was instilled in me and I always believed that Spain had won the war against foreign enemies of our historic greatness\\".

Media Under the 1938 Press Law, all newspapers were put under prior censorship and were forced to include any articles the government desired. Chief editors were nominated by the government and all journalists were required to be registered. All liberal, republican and left-wing media were prohibited. The Delegaci√≥n Nacional de Prensa y Propaganda was established as a network of government media, including daily newspapers Diario Arriba and Pueblo. The EFE and Pyresa government news agencies were created in 1939 and 1945. The Radio Nacional de Espa√±a state radio had the exclusive right to transmit news bulletins, which all broadcasters were required to air. The No-Do were 10-minute newsreels shown at all cinemas. The Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola, the government television network, debuted in 1956. The Roman Catholic Church had its own media outlets, including the Ya newspaper and the Cadena COPE radio network. Other pro- government media included Cadena SER, ABC, La Vanguardia Espa√±ola, El Correo and El Diario Vasco. Notable independent media outlets included humour magazine La Codorniz. The 1966 Press Law dropped the prior censorship regime and allowed media outlets to select their own directors, although criticism was still a crime. Economic policy The Civil War had ravaged the Spanish economy. Infrastructure had been damaged, workers killed and daily business severely hampered. For more than a decade after Franco's victory, the economy improved little. Franco initially pursued a policy of autarky, cutting off almost all international trade. The policy had devastating effects and the economy stagnated. Only black marketeers could enjoy an evident affluence. In 1940, the Sindicato Vertical was created. It was inspired by the ideas of Jos√© Antonio Primo de Rivera, who thought that class struggle would be ended by grouping together workers and owners according to corporative principles. It was the only legal trade union and was under government control. Other trade unions were forbidden and strongly repressed along with political parties outside the Falange. On the brink of bankruptcy, a combination of pressure from the United States (including about $1.5 billion in aid 1954-1964), the IMF and technocrats from Opus Dei managed to \\"convince\\" the regime to adopt a free market economy in 1959 in what amounted to a mini coup d'√©tat which removed the old guard in charge of the economy, despite the opposition of Franco. However, this economic liberalisation was not accompanied by political reforms and oppression continued unabated. Economic growth picked up after 1959 after Franco took authority away from these ideologues and gave more power to the liberal technocrats. The country implemented several development policies and growth took off creating the \\"Spanish Miracle\\". Concurrent with the absence of social reforms and the economic power shift, a tide of mass emigration commenced to European countries and to lesser extent to South America. Emigration helped the regime in two ways: the country got rid of surplus population and the emigrants supplied the country with much needed monetary remittances. During the 1960s, Spain experienced further increases in wealth. International firms established their factories in Spain: salaries were low, taxes nearly nonexistent, strikes were forbidden, labour health or real state regulations were unheard of and Spain was virtually a virgin market. Spain became the second-fastest-growing economy in the world, alongside Brazil and just behind Japan. The rapid development of this period became known as the \\"Spanish Miracle\\". At the time of Franco's death, Spain still lagged behind most of Western Europe, but the gap between its GDP per capita and that of the major Western European economies had greatly narrowed. In world terms, Spain was already enjoying a fairly high material standard of living with basic but comprehensive services. However, the period between the mid-1970s and mid-1980s was to prove difficult as in addition to the oil shocks to which Spain was highly exposed, the settling of the new political order took priority over the modernising of the economy. Legacy By the decision of King Juan Carlos I, Franco was entombed in the monument of Valle de los Ca√≠dos, until his body was moved in October 2019. Equestrian statue of Franco in the Plaza del Ayuntamiento of Santander, taken down in late 2008 In Spain and abroad, the legacy of Franco remains controversial. In Germany, a squadron named after Werner M√∂lders has been renamed because as a pilot he led the escorting units in the bombing of Guernica. As recently as 2006, the BBC reported that Maciej Giertych, an MEP of the right-wing League of Polish Families, had expressed admiration for Franco's stature who allegedly \\"guaranteed the maintenance of traditional values in Europe\\".Europe diary: Franco and Finland, BBC News, 6 July 2006 Spanish opinion has changed. Most statues of Franco and other public Francoist symbols have been removed, with the last statue in Madrid coming down in 2005.Madrid removes last Franco statue, BBC News, 17 March 2005 Additionally, the Permanent Commission of the European Parliament \\"firmly\\" condemned in a resolution unanimously adopted in March 2006 the \\"multiple and serious violations\\" of human rights committed in Spain under the Francoist regime from 1939 to 1975.Primera condena al r√©gimen de Franco en un recinto internacional, EFE, El Mundo, 17 March 2006 Von Martyna Czarnowska, Almunia, Joaquin: EU-Kommission (4): Ein halbes Jahr Vorsprung , Weiner Zeitung, 17 February 2005 (article in German language). Accessed 26 August 2006. The resolution was at the initiative of the MEP Leo Brincat and of the historian Luis Mar√≠a de Puig and is the first international official condemnation of the repression enacted by Franco's regime. The resolution also urged to provide public access to historians (professional and amateurs) to the various archives of the Francoist regime, including those of the Fundaci√≥n Francisco Franco, which as well as other Francoist archives remain as of 2006 inaccessible to the public. Furthermore, it urged the Spanish authorities to set up an underground exhibition in the Valley of the Fallen in order to explain the terrible conditions in which it was built. Finally, it proposed the construction of monuments to commemorate Franco's victims in Madrid and other important cities. In Spain, a commission to restore the dignity of the victims of Franco's regime and pay tribute to their memory (comisi√≥n para reparar la dignidad y restituir la memoria de las v√≠ctimas del franquismo) was approved in the summer of 2004 and was directed by the then-Vice President Mar√≠a Teresa Fern√°ndez de la Vega. Because of his repressive regional linguistic policies, Franco's memory is still particularly resented in Catalonia and the Basque Country. The Basque Provinces and Catalonia were among the regions that offered the strongest resistance to Franco in the Civil War, as well as during his regime. In 2008, the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory initiated a systematic search for mass graves of people executed during Franco's regime, a move supported since the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party's victory during the 2004 elections by Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero's government. The Historical Memory Law (Ley de Memoria Hist√≥rica) was passed in 2007 as an attempt to enforce official recognition of the crimes committed against civilians during Franco's rule and to organise under state supervision the search for mass graves. Investigations have begun into wide-scale child abduction during the Franco years. The lost children of Francoism may reach 300,000. Flags and heraldry =Flags= At the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War and in spite of the army's reorganisation, several sections of the army continued with their bi-colour flags improvised in 1936, but since 1940 new ensigns began to be distributed, whose main innovation was the addition of the eagle of Saint John to the shield. The new arms were allegedly inspired in the coat of arms the Catholic Monarchs adopted after the taking of Emirate of Granada from the Moors, but replacing the arms of Sicily with those of Navarre and adding the Pillars of Hercules on either side of the coat of arms. In 1938, the columns were placed outside the wings. On 26 July 1945, the commander's ensigns were suppressed by decree and on 11 October a detailed regulation of flags was published that fixed the model of the bi-colour flag in use, but better defined its details, emphasising a greater style of the Saint John's eagle. The models established by this decree remained in force until 1977. During this period, two more flags were usually displayed along with the national flag: the flag of Falange (red, black and red vertical stripes, with the yokes and arrows in the centre of the black stripe) and the traditionalist flag (white background with the Cross of Burgundy in the middle), representing the National Movement which had unified Falange and the Requet√©s under the name Falange Espa√±ola Tradicionalista y de las JONS. From the death of Franco in 1975 until 1977, the national flag followed the 1945 regulations. On 21 January 1977, a new regulation was approved that stipulated an eagle with more open wings, with the restored Pillars of Hercules placed within the wings and the tape with the motto \\"Una, Grande y Libre\\" (\\"One, Great and Free\\") moved over the eagle's head from its previous position around the neck.

As Prince of Spain from 1969 to 1975, Juan Carlos used a royal standard which was virtually identical to the one later adopted when he became King in 1975. The earlier standard differed only that it featured the royal crown of a Crown Prince, the King's royal crown has 8 arches of which 5 are visible, while the Prince's one has only 4 arches of which 3 are visible. The Royal Standard of Spain consists of a dark blue square with the coat of arms in the centre. The King's guidon is identical to the standard.

He is associated with the Enlightenment, Sturm und Drang, and Weimar Classicism. Biography Born in Mohrungen (now MorƒÖg, Poland) in Kingdom of Prussia (in former Ducal Prussia), Herder grew up in a poor household, educating himself from his father's Bible and songbook. In 1762, as a youth of 17, he enrolled at the University of K√∂nigsberg, about 60 miles (100 km) north of Mohrungen, where he became a student of Immanuel Kant. At the same time, Herder became an intellectual prot√©g√© of Johann Georg Hamann, a K√∂nigsberg philosopher who disputed the claims of pure secular reason. Hamann's influence led Herder to confess to his wife later in life that \\"I have too little reason and too much idiosyncrasy\\",Columbia studies in the social sciences, Issue 341, 1966, p. 74. yet Herder can justly claim to have founded a new school of German political thought. Although himself an unsociable person, Herder influenced his contemporaries greatly. One friend wrote to him in 1785, hailing his works as \\"inspired by God.\\" A varied field of theorists were later to find inspiration in Herder's tantalizingly incomplete ideas. In 1764, now a clergyman, Herder went to Riga to teach. It was during this period that he produced his first major works, which were literary criticism. In 1769 Herder traveled by ship to the French port of Nantes and continued on to Paris. This resulted in both an account of his travels as well as a shift of his own self-conception as an author. By 1770 Herder went to Strasbourg, where he met the young Goethe. This event proved to be a key juncture in the history of German literature, as Goethe was inspired by Herder's literary criticism to develop his own style. This can be seen as the beginning of the \\"Sturm und Drang\\" movement. In 1771 Herder took a position as head pastor and court preacher at B√ºckeburg under William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe. By the mid-1770s, Goethe was a well-known author, and used his influence at the court of Weimar to secure Herder a position as General Superintendent. Herder moved there in 1776, where his outlook shifted again towards classicism. On May 2, 1773 Herder married Maria Karoline Flachsland (1750-1809) in Darmstadt. 1774 his son Gottfried (1774-1806) was born in B√ºckeburg. 1776 his second son August (1776-1838) was born in B√ºckeburg. His third son Wilhelm Ludwig Ernst was born 1778. His fourth son Karl Emil Adelbert (1779-1857) was born 1779 in Weimar. 1781 his daughter Luise (1781-1860) was born in Weimar. 1783 his fifth son Emil Ernst Gottfried (1783-1855) was born in Weimar. 1790 his sixth son Rinaldo Gottfried was born in Weimar. Towards the end of his career, Herder endorsed the French Revolution, which earned him the enmity of many of his colleagues. At the same time, he and Goethe experienced a personal split. Another reason for his isolation in later years was due to his unpopular attacks on Kantian philosophy.Copleston, Frederick Charles. The Enlightenment: Voltaire to Kant. 2003. p. 146. In 1802 Herder was ennobled by the Elector-Prince of Bavaria, which added the prefix \\"von\\" to his last name. He died in Weimar in 1803 at age 59. Works and ideas In 1772 Herder published Treatise on the Origin of Language and went further in this promotion of language than his earlier injunction to \\"spew out the ugly slime of the Seine. Speak German, O You German\\". Herder now had established the foundations of comparative philology within the new currents of political outlook. Throughout this period, he continued to elaborate his own unique theory of aesthetics in works such as the above, while Goethe produced works like The Sorrows of Young Wertherthe Sturm und Drang movement was born. Herder wrote an important essay on Shakespeare and Auszug aus einem Briefwechsel √ºber Ossian und die Lieder alter V√∂lker (Extract from a correspondence about Ossian and the Songs of Ancient Peoples) published in 1773 in a manifesto along with contributions by Goethe and Justus M√∂ser. Herder wrote that \\"A poet is the creator of the nation around him, he gives them a world to see and has their souls in his hand to lead them to that world.\\" To him such poetry had its greatest purity and power in nations before they became civilised, as shown in the Old Testament, the Edda, and Homer, and he tried to find such virtues in ancient German folk songs and Norse poetry and mythology. Herder - most pronouncedly after Georg Forster's 1791 translation of the Sanskrit play Shakuntala - was influenced by the religious imagery of Hinduism and Indian literature, which he saw in a positive light, writing several essays on the topic and the preface to the 1803 edition of Shakuntala.Willson, A. Leslie. \\"Herder and India: The Genesis of a Mythical Image.\\" PMLA 70, no. 5 (1955): 1049-058. Accessed October 3, 2020. doi:10.2307/459885. St. Peter und Paul After becoming General Superintendent in 1776, Herder's philosophy shifted again towards classicism, and he produced works such as his unfinished Outline of a Philosophical History of Humanity which largely originated the school of historical thought. Herder's philosophy was of a deeply subjective turn, stressing influence by physical and historical circumstance upon human development, stressing that \\"one must go into the age, into the region, into the whole history, and feel one's way into everything\\". The historian should be the \\"regenerated contemporary\\" of the past, and history a science as \\"instrument of the most genuine patriotic spirit\\". Herder gave Germans new pride in their origins, modifying that dominance of regard allotted to Greek art (Greek revival) extolled among others by Johann Joachim Winckelmann and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. He remarked that he would have wished to be born in the Middle Ages and mused whether \\"the times of the Swabian emperors\\" did not \\"deserve to be set forth in their true light in accordance with the German mode of thought?\\". Herder equated the German with the Gothic and favoured D√ºrer and everything Gothic. As with the sphere of art, equally he proclaimed a national message within the sphere of language. He topped the line of German authors emanating from Martin Opitz, who had written his Aristarchus, sive de contemptu linguae Teutonicae in Latin in 1617, urging Germans to glory in their hitherto despised language. Herder's extensive collections of folk-poetry began a great craze in Germany for that neglected topic. Herder was one of the first to argue that language contributes to shaping the frameworks and the patterns with which each linguistic community thinks and feels. For Herder, language is 'the organ of thought'. This has often been misinterpreted, however. Neither Herder nor the great philosopher of language, Wilhelm von Humboldt, argue that language determines thought. Language is both the means and the expression of man's creative capacity to think together with others. And in this sense, when Humboldt argues that all thinking is thinking in language, he is perpetuating the Herder tradition. But for both thinkers, culture, language, thinking, feeling, and above all the literature of individuals and the people's folk traditions are expressions of free-spirited groups and individuals expressing themselves in space and time. Two centuries later, these ideas continue to stimulate thinkers, linguists and anthropologists, and they have often been considered central to the Sapir‚ÄìWhorf hypothesis, and the American linguistic anthropology tradition inspired by Boas, and more recently, Dell Hymes. Herder's focus upon language and cultural traditions as the ties that create a \\"nation\\" extended to include folklore, dance, music and art, and inspired Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm in their collection of German folk tales. Arguably, the greatest inheritor of Herder's linguistic philosophy was Wilhelm von Humboldt. Humboldt's great contribution lay in developing Herder's idea that language is \\"the organ of thought\\" into his own belief that languages were specific worldviews (Weltansichten), as J√ºrgen Trabant argues in the Wilhelm von Humboldt lectures on the Rouen Ethnolinguistics Project website. Herder attached exceptional importance to the concept of nationality and of patriotism\\"he that has lost his patriotic spirit has lost himself and the whole worlds about himself\\", whilst teaching that \\"in a certain sense every human perfection is national\\". Herder carried folk theory to an extreme by maintaining that \\"there is only one class in the state, the Volk, (not the rabble), and the king belongs to this class as well as the peasant\\". Explanation that the Volk was not the rabble was a novel conception in this era, and with Herder can be seen the emergence of \\"the people\\" as the basis for the emergence of a classless but hierarchical national body. The nation, however, was individual and separate, distinguished, to Herder, by climate, education, foreign intercourse, tradition and heredity. Providence he praised for having \\"wonderfully separated nationalities not only by woods and mountains, seas and deserts, rivers and climates, but more particularly by languages, inclinations and characters\\". Herder praised the tribal outlook writing that \\"the savage who loves himself, his wife and child with quiet joy and glows with limited activity of his tribe as for his own life is in my opinion a more real being than that cultivated shadow who is enraptured with the shadow of the whole species\\", isolated since \\"each nationality contains its centre of happiness within itself, as a bullet the centre of gravity\\". With no need for comparison since \\"every nation bears in itself the standard of its perfection, totally independent of all comparison with that of others\\" for \\"do not nationalities differ in everything, in poetry, in appearance, in tastes, in usages, customs and languages? Must not religion which partakes of these also differ among the nationalities?\\" Following a trip to Ukraine, Herder wrote a prediction in his diary (Journal meiner Reise im Jahre 1769) that Slavic nations would one day be the real power in Europe, as the western Europeans would reject Christianity and rot away, while the eastern European nations would stick to their religion and their idealism, and would this way become the power in Europe. More specifically, he praised Ukraine's \\"beautiful skies, blithe temperament, musical talent, bountiful soil, etc. [...] someday will awaken there a cultured nation whose influence will spread [...] throughout the world.\\" One of his related predictions was that the Hungarian nation would disappear and become assimilated by surrounding Slavic peoples; this prophecy caused considerable uproar in Hungary and is widely cited to this day. =Germany and the Enlightenment= This question was further developed by Herder's lament that Martin Luther did not establish a national church, and his doubt whether Germany did not buy Christianity at too high a price, that of true nationality. Herder's patriotism bordered at times upon national pantheism, demanding of territorial unity as \\"He is deserving of glory and gratitude who seeks to promote the unity of the territories of Germany through writings, manufacture, and institutions\\" and sounding an even deeper call: :\\"But now! Again I cry, my German brethren! But now! The remains of all genuine folk-thought is rolling into the abyss of oblivion with a last and accelerated impetus. For the last century we have been ashamed of everything that concerns the fatherland.\\" Herder In his Ideas upon Philosophy and the History of Mankind he wrote: \\"Compare England with Germany: the English are Germans, and even in the latest times the Germans have led the way for the English in the greatest things.\\" Herder, who hated absolutism and Prussian nationalism, but who was imbued with the spirit of the whole German Volk, yet as a historical theorist turned away from the ideas of the eighteenth century. Seeking to reconcile his thought with this earlier age, Herder sought to harmonize his conception of sentiment with reasoning, whereby all knowledge is implicit in the soul; the most elementary stage is the sensuous and intuitive perception which by development can become self- conscious and rational. To Herder, this development is the harmonizing of primitive and derivative truth, of experience and intelligence, feeling and reasoning. Herder is the first in a long line of Germans preoccupied with this harmony. This search is itself the key to the understanding of many German theories of the time; however Herder understood and feared the extremes to which his folk-theory could tend, and so issued specific warnings. He argued that Jews in Germany should enjoy the full rights and obligations of Germans, and that the non-Jews of the world owed a debt to Jews for centuries of abuse, and that this debt could be discharged only by actively assisting those Jews who wished to do so to regain political sovereignty in their ancient homeland of Israel.Barnard, F. M., \\"The Hebrews and Herder's Political Creed,\\" Modern Language Review,\\" vol. 54, no. 4, October 1959, pp. 533‚Äì546. Herder refused to adhere to a rigid racial theory, writing that \\"notwithstanding the varieties of the human form, there is but one and the same species of man throughout the whole earth\\". He also announced that \\"national glory is a deceiving seducer. When it reaches a certain height, it clasps the head with an iron band. The enclosed sees nothing in the mist but his own picture; he is susceptible to no foreign impressions.\\" The passage of time was to demonstrate that while many Germans were to find influence in Herder's convictions and influence, fewer were to note his qualifying stipulations. Herder had emphasised that his conception of the nation encouraged democracy and the free self-expression of a people's identity. He proclaimed support for the French Revolution, a position which did not endear him to royalty. He also differed with Kant's philosophy for not placing reasoning within the context of language. Herder did not think that reason itself could be criticized, as it did not exist except as the process of reasoning. This process was dependent on language.Copleston, Frederick Charles. The Enlightenment: Voltaire to Kant, 2003, p. 145. He also turned away from the Sturm und Drang movement to go back to the poems of Shakespeare and Homer. To promote his concept of the Volk, he published letters and collected folk songs. These latter were published in 1773 as Voices of the Peoples in Their Songs (Stimmen der V√∂lker in ihren Liedern). The poets Achim von Arnim and Clemens von Brentano later used Stimmen der V√∂lker as samples for The Boy's Magic Horn (Des Knaben Wunderhorn). Herder also fostered the ideal of a person's individuality. Although he had from an early period championed the individuality of cultures ‚Äì for example, in his This Too a Philosophy of History for the Formation of Humanity (1774), he also championed the individuality of persons within a culture; for example, in his On Thomas Abbt's Writings (1768) and On the Cognition and Sensation of the Human Soul (1778). In On Thomas Abbt's Writings, Herder stated that \\"a human soul is an individual in the realm of minds: it senses in accordance with an individual formation, and thinks in accordance with the strength of its mental organs. ... My long allegory has succeeded if it achieves the representation of the mind of a human being as an individual phenomenon, as a rarity which deserves to occupy our eyes.\\"Herder: Philosophical Writings, ed. M. N. Forster. Cambridge: 2002, p. 167 =Evolution= Herder has been described as a proto-evolutionary thinker by some science historians, although this has been disputed by others.Headstrom, Birger R. (1929). Herder and the Theory of Evolution. The Open Court 10 (2): 596-601.Nisbet, H. B. (1970). Herder and the Philosophy and History of Science. Modern Humanities Research Association. pp. 210-212.

Herder Today: Contributions from the International Herder Conference: Nov. 5-8, 1987 Stanford, California. pp. 1-16. Concerning the history of life on earth, Herder proposed naturalistic and metaphysical (religious) ideas that are difficult to distinguish and interpret. He was known for proposing a great chain of being. In his book From the Greeks to Darwin, Henry Fairfield Osborn wrote that \\"in a general way he upholds the doctrine of the transformation of the lower and higher forms of life, of a continuous transformation from lower to higher types, and of the law of Perfectibility.\\"Osborn, Henry Fairfield. (1908). From the Greeks to Darwin: An Outline of the Development of the Evolution Idea. New York: Macmillan. p. 103 However, biographer Wulf K√∂pke disagreed, noting that \\"biological evolution from animals to the human species was outside of his thinking, which was still influenced by the idea of divine creation.\\"K√∂pke, Wulf.

He received many awards and was considered a candidate for the Nobel Prize for Literature. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's personal journals in book form attracted both controversy and admiration for blurring the conventions of reportage with the allegory and magical realism of literature.https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/world/europe/24kapuscinski.html He was the Communist-era Polish Press Agency's only correspondent in Africa during decolonization, and also worked in South America and Asia. Between 1956 and 1981 he reported on 27 revolutions and coups, until he was fired because of his support for the pro-democracy Solidarity movement in his native country. He was celebrated by other practitioners of the genre. The acclaimed Italian reportage-writer Tiziano Terzani, Colombian writer Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and Chilean writer Luis Sep√∫lveda accorded him the title \\"Maestro\\". Notable works include Jeszcze dzie≈Ñ ≈ºycia (1976; Another Day of Life), about Angola; Cesarz (1978; The Emperor, 1983), about the downfall of Ethiopian ruler Haile Selassie, also considered to be a satire of Communist Poland; Wojna futbolowa (1978; The Soccer War, 1991), an account of the 1969 conflict between Honduras and El Salvador, and other stories from the life of the reporter in Africa and Latin America; Szachinszach (1982; Shah of Shahs, 2006) about the downfall of the last Shah of Persia; Imperium (1993) an account of his travels through the collapsing Soviet Union; Heban (1998), later published in English as The Shadow of the Sun (2001), the story of his years in Africa; and Podr√≥≈ºe z Herodotem (2004; Travels with Herodotus), in which he ponders over relevance of The Histories by Herodotus to a modern reporter's job. Biography House where Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's family lived in Pinsk in the 1930s (photo from 2009) at B≈Çotna Street (now Suvorov Street 43) Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was born in Pinsk (now in Belarus), Polesie Voivodeship, in the Kresy Wschodnie or eastern borderlands of the Second Polish Republic in 1932, the son of Maria Bobka (b. 1910) and J√≥zef Kapu≈õci≈Ñski (b. 1903), primary school teachers. His sister Barbara was born the following year. They were born into poverty: he would later say that he felt at home in Africa as \\"food was scarce there too and everyone was also barefoot.\\" In September 1938 Ryszard started attending Primary School No 5 in Pinsk. He spent the summer of 1939 together with his mother and sister in Paw≈Ç√≥w, a small village near Rejowiec in Lublin Voivodeship. When the Second World War began in September 1939 they came back to Pinsk after the city was captured by the Red Army and Ryszard returned to school there. In 1940 Maria, afraid of deportation to the East, together with Ryszard and Barbara left Pinsk and moved to Sierak√≥w, near Warsaw. There they met J√≥zef. Later the family moved near Otwock. Ryszard continued education in primary school in Otwock (1944‚Äì45).Nowacka B., ZiƒÖtek Z. \\"Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski. Biografia pisarza\\", Znak, Krak√≥w 2008 He described his early life in the book Imperium. In 1945 the family settled in Warsaw where Ryszard began education in Stanis≈Çaw Staszic Gymnasium. He became an amateur boxer (bantamweight) and football player. In 1948, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski joined the official Communist youth organisationthe ZMPand served lower rank posts. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was the hero of the article published in the weekly periodical Odrodzenie reporting on a poetry conference organised at his school, in which the teenager's poems were compared with works of Mayakovsky and Wierzy≈Ñski. In June 1950 he graduated from Gymnasium and started working for the Sztandar M≈Çodych (The Banner of Youth), a nationwide newspaper founded in 1950 as the organ of the ZMP. In October 1950 he began his studies at Warsaw University (Department of Polish Studies) and in 1951 he moved to the department of history after he suspended working for Sztandar M≈Çodych till 1955. He participated in the Youth Festival in East Berlin staged in August 1951 in East Germany. This was his first foreign trip. From 1952 and till his death Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was married to doctor Alicja Mielczarek (b. 1933). Their daughter Zofia was born in 1953. During the period from 1953 to 1981the year of the imposition of the martial law in PolandKapu≈õci≈Ñski was a member of the Polish United Workers' Party (the PZPR). His attitude to the PZPR changed early on, \\"the decisive moment having come in the year 1956\\" (presumably a reference to the events of Pozna≈Ñ June and the process of de-Stalinisation brought about by the Thaw of Gomu≈Çka, and the Hungarian Revolution of 1956).In May 2007Newsweek Polska magazine wrote that Kapu≈õci≈Ñski worked for the Communist Polish secret service from 1965 to 1972 or 1977. \\"Teczka pisarza\\" (The Dossier of a Writer; an interview with Ernest Skalski). Nowacka and ZiƒÖtek in the book published in 2013 Literatura \\"non-fiction\\". Czytanie Kapu≈õci≈Ñskiego po Domos≈Çawskim (Non‚Äëfiction literature: Reading Kapu≈õci≈Ñski after Domos≈Çawski) state that in the case of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski one can not say about Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's constant cooperation, rather about three cases of secret service's extortion on Kapu≈õci≈Ñski of intelligence activities (during his travels abroad) from which he evaded either not writing the demanded \\"reports\\" or writing analysis which could be published in the official press. In June 1955 he graduated from Warsaw University. After publishing, in September 1955, a critical article about the construction of Nowa Huta, a Cracow conurbation built on a site chosen as the \\"first socialist municipality in Poland\\",Cf. Jan Skarbowski [et al.], Nowa Huta: pierwsze socjalistyczne miasto w Polsce, Cracow, Wydawnictwo Literackie, 1971. Similarly, the French urban sociologist, Paul-Henry Chombart de Lauwe (1913‚Äì1998), called Nowa Huta \\"ville phare du socialisme\\" (flagship conurbation of socialism). which brought to light the inhuman working and living conditions of the labourers involved in the venture‚Äîa story which occasioned consternation before eventually winning favour with the Communist authorities unsure at first how to react to a fault-finding depiction of their pet project by one of their own‚ÄîKapu≈õci≈Ñski was awarded the Golden Cross of Merit at the age of 23. In August 1956 he reported from Kiev and in September he was sent to India, his first travel outside Europe. He returned via Afghanistan (where he was detained at the airport in Kabul) and Moscow. In August 1957 he went for half a year to China (via Tokyo and Hong Kong). He came back to Poland by the Trans-Siberian Railway. Beginning with that journey to India undertaken at the age of 24, he travelled across the developing world reporting on wars, coups and revolutions in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. He started learning English in India by reading, with the help of a dictionary, a copy of Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls. He wrote about his first travels to Asia in the book Travels with Herodotus. In 1958 he left Sztandar M≈Çodych and started working for the Polish Press Agency. Shortly afterwards he also joined the weekly Polityka (where he worked till 1962). The result of his work for the weekly was the book Busz po polsku (The Polish Bush) published in 1962, a collection of his articles from the \\"Polish wilderness\\" that he went into to relate \\"the perspectives of forgotten, invisible, marginal people and so to record a living history of those seldom deemed worthy to enter the annals of official history\\" (in the words of Diana Kuprel, the literary scholar and translator of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's works).Diana Kuprel, \\"Literary Reportage: Between and Beyond Art and Fact\\"; in: History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th Centuries, ed. M. Cornis-Pope and J. Neubauer, Amsterdam, Benjamins, 2004‚Äì2006, vol.1, p.384. . He was aggrieved at the indifference of the reading public towards the majority of his early books. \\"Antycia≈Ça: z Ryszardem Kapu≈õci≈Ñskim rozmawia Andrzej Skworz\\" (Antibodies: An Interview with Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski Conducted by A. Skworz), Press (monthly magazine), No. 2 (121), February 2006, pp. 25‚Äì28. ISSN 1425-9818. In the late 1950s he went for the first time to Africa (Ghana, Republic of Dahomey and Niger). After honing his skills on domestic stories he was later \\"'responsible' for fifty countries\\" for the Polish Press Agency in Africa. (Although a correspondent of an official state press agency, he never in his life asked a single question at any press conference that he attended). When he finally returned to Poland, he had lived through twenty-seven revolutions and coups, been jailed 40 times and survived four death sentences. In the English-speaking world, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski is best known for his reporting from Africa in the 1960s and 1970s, when he witnessed first-hand the end of the European colonial empires on that continent. In 1961 he reported from the Republic of the Congo. He described his escape to Bujumbura and subsequent arrest in the book The Soccer War. In the years 1962‚Äì65 he lived initially in Dar es Salaam and later in Nairobi from where he travelled to other countries in Africa. He came back to Poland only for few weeks in 1965 but returned to Africa to live in Lagos and continue reporting. In April 1965 he travelled to Senegal and Mauritania which he later described in the book The Shadow of the Sun. At the end of 1966 he came back to Poland. In April 1967 he went to Central Asia and Caucasus. In November the same year he started working as a foreign correspondent in South America, based in Santiago. Later he moved to Mexico (1969‚Äì72). In 1969 he witnessed war in Honduras which he described in the book The Soccer War. In 1969 he edited and translated from the Spanish El diario del Che en Bolivia, the final literary bequest of Che Guevara.Ernesto Guevara, Dziennik z Boliwii Che Guevara, intro. Fidel Castro, ed. & tr. R. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, Warsaw, Wydawnictwo KsiƒÖ≈ºka i Wiedza, 1970. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski analyzed the situation in Guatemala after a German diplomat Karl von Spreti was kidnapped. He published his reportage in 1970 entitled Dlaczego zginƒÖ≈Ç Karl von Spreti (Why Karl von Spreti Died). He returned to Poland in 1972 and later worked for magazines Kontynenty and Kultura. In September 1975 he went to Angola after which he published the book Another Day of Life. In 1975 and 1977 he went to Ethiopia. The Emperor was written after his travels there.A film-script adaptation of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's The Emperor, written by Marcel ≈Åozi≈Ñski for the film-director Andrzej Wajda in 1979, has never reached the production stage, having been banned by Communist censors (Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's original book was not affected). In 1979 he visited his birthplace Pinsk for the first time since 1940. In 1979 he went to Iran to witness the Iranian Revolution. His book Shah of Shahs deals with this subject and the fall of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski with Julia Hartwig in Warsaw, 2006 In 1980 he witnessed the strikes that took place in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland.Pracownia Reporta≈ºu (Beck et al., inspired by Marek Miller), Who Allowed Journalists Here (\\"Kto tu wpu≈õci≈Ç dziennikarzy\\"), Independent Publishing House NOWA, 1985 http://kapuscinski.info/kto-tu-wpuscil-dziennikarzy.html In 1988 two episodes of Arena were dedicated to him and his work. He travelled in European and Asian parts of the Soviet Union (1989‚Äì1992) and witnessed the dissolution of the Soviet Union. After this experience he wrote Imperium. He was awarded German Academic Exchange Service scholarship in Berlin in 1994. In 1999 Kapu≈õci≈Ñski talked about his life in VPRO in a series of autobiographical interviews with prominent people from the worlds of science, culture and politics. In a 2006 interview with Reuters, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski said that he wrote for \\"people everywhere still young enough to be curious about the world.\\" He was fluent in Polish, English, Russian, Spanish, French and Portuguese. He was visiting professor in Bangalore (1970s), Bonn, Cape Town, Caracas (1979), Columbia University (1983), Harvard University, Irkutsk, London, Madrid, Mexico (1979), San Sebastian, Temple University (1988) and Vancouver.Kapu≈õci≈Ñski R., \\"Encountering the Other\\", Universitas, Krak√≥w 2007 Kapu≈õci≈Ñski died on January 23, 2007, of a heart attack suffered in a Warsaw hospital where he was being treated for unrelated ailments. Literary works From the early 1960s onwards, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski published books of increasing literary craftsmanship characterized by sophisticated narrative technique, psychological portraits of characters, a wealth of stylization and metaphor and unusual imagery that serves as means of interpreting the perceived world. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's best-known book, The Emperor, concerns itself with the decline of Haile Selassie's anachronistic r√©gime in Ethiopia. The book's story had a special meaning that was not lost on the people of Poland, especially as dissent against the PZPR was taking root. The Emperor was also the book that established Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's reputation in the West. When it appeared in English translation in 1983 it received an immediate critical success. In 1987 the book was adapted by Michael Hastings and Jonathan Miller into a theatre play, produced by the Royal Court Theatre, London. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was fascinated by the humanity he found in different worlds and people, as well as the books of these worlds and people: he approached foreign countries first through literature, spending months reading before each trip. He was skilled in listening to the diverse people he met, but he was also capable of \\"reading\\" the hidden sense of the scenes he encountered: the way the Europeans moved out of Angola, a discussion regarding alimony in the Tanganyikan parliament, the reconstruction of frescoes in the new Russiahe turned each of these vignettes into a metaphor of historical transformation. This tendency to process private experiences into a greater social synthesis made Kapu≈õci≈Ñski an eminent thinker, and the volumes of the ongoing Lapidarium series are a record of the shaping of a reporter's observations into philosophical reflections on the world, its people and their suffering. He had great compassion for the poor, the victimised, and the debased. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski himself called his work \\"literary reportage\\", and reportage d'auteur.Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, Autoportret reportera, ed. K. StrƒÖczek, Cracow, Znak, 2003, p. 42\\\\. . In the English-speaking world, his genre is sometimes characterised as \\"magic journalism\\" (in counterpoint to magic realism), a term coined by Adam Hochschild in 1994.In an article in Slate Magazine, writer Jack Shafer called Kapu≈õci≈Ñski a fabulist who did not adhere to the basic rules of journalism.\\"The Lies of Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski\\". Jack Shafer, Slate Magazine, January 25, 2007. As part of his criticism, Shafer cited the anthropology professor John Ryle. His condemnation was rebutted by Meghan O'Rourke in Slate five days later; O'Rourke contended that Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's invention of petty details to reveal a larger truth did not make him a bad journalist. O'Rourke, Meghan (January 30, 2007). \\"Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski: Defending his literary license\\". Slate MagazineThe British journalist Michela Wrong wrote in the New Statesman, \\"Kapu≈õci≈Ñski would have helped his own case if he had been more consistent, and modest, about what he offered. If you present your work as 'magical journalism', of the Garc√≠a M√°rquez genre, best not simultaneously lecture a younger generation of journalists, as he did, on their imprecision. And if your prime years in the field were largely confined to the Cold War, best not present yourself as an eternal sage on the subject.\\" Kapu≈õci≈Ñski often introduced himself with the line \\"I am a poor reporter who unfortunately lacks the imagination of a writer\\". Italian journalist Tiziano Terzani and Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski shared a similar vision of journalism. Jaime Abello Banfi, the friend and associate of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, reports that Garc√≠a M√°rquez and Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, unbeknownst to each other, shared the opinion that the way to good journalism led through poetry (on account of the fact that it inculcates both the conciseness of expression and its aptness). Kapu≈õci≈Ñski considered the ancient Greek historian Herodotus a great reporter and his master. He wrote a book Travels with Herodotus where he shows that the Histories of Herodotus are timeless and the masterpiece of reportage. He also considered Curzio Malaparte, Melchior Wa≈Ñkowicz, Ksawery Pruszy≈Ñski and Franciszek Gil (1917‚Äì1960) to have been his literary models and stylistic precursors.Tomasz ≈Åubie≈Ñski (b. 1938), \\"Ucze≈Ñ Kapu≈õci≈Ñskiego?\\" (Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's Pupil?), Gazeta Wyborcza, March 3, 2010, p. 13 (in Polish) (\\"...byƒá mo≈ºe uwa≈ºa≈Ç za swoich reporterskich poprzednik√≥w Melchiora Wa≈Ñkowicza i Curzio Malapartego, dla kt√≥rych liczy≈Ç siƒô efekt, wra≈ºenie, szczeg√≥≈Ç o sile metafory...\\")Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, Autoportret reportera , Cracow, Znak (2003). . (Of Pruszy≈Ñski and Wa≈Ñkowicz, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski says: \\"Obu zna≈Çem osobi≈õcie, obu podziwia≈Çem, kocha≈Çem i ceni≈Çem.\\" (I have known them both personally, I have admired them both, I have loved them and esteemed them).) On some level, Pruszy≈Ñski and Wa≈Ñkowicz shared a very similar approach to facts with Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, believing that the general picture of the story can be glued from bits and pieces to reveal a truth as a wholly independent construct.Diana Kuprel, \\"Literary Reportage: Between and Beyond Art and Fact\\"; in: History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and Disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries, ed. M. Cornis-Pope and J. Neubauer, Amsterdam, John Benjamins Pub. Co., 2004‚Äì2006, vol. 1, pp. 382‚Äì83. . Students of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's work observed correspondences between his work and that of J. M. Coetzee in that both writers were supposedly beholden to the theory of \\"the responsibility of witness\\".Gosia Kasperska, \\"Coetzee i Kapu≈õci≈Ñskipr√≥ba zestawienia afryka≈Ñskich motyw√≥w tw√≥rczo≈õci\\" ; unpublished (?) dissertation, University of Wroc≈Çaw; published on Kapuscinski.info Internet portal, March 18, 2011. One reviewer saw in Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's mixing of subtle psychological reflection with vivid description an invitation to a comparison with Joseph Conrad; Binyavanga Wainaina and Aleksandar Hemon made the same comparison, if for other, less laudatory reasons. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski confirmed to Bill Deedes the fact that Conrad was one of his literary inspirations. Neal Ascherson likened him to Egon Erwin Kisch (1885‚Äì1948) considered the father of literary reportage. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski himself cites Kisch with approval as the \\"classic of reportage\\" who dealt a death blow to traditional forms of reporting by putting the person of the reporter at centre stage. Certainly, neither Kisch nor Kapu≈õci≈Ñski believed in what might be called \\"journalistic objectivity\\": whereas Kisch thought it necessary for a (Communist) reporter to \\"engage politically\\" with his subject, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski would put objectivity as a concept out of court altogether, stating explicitly, \\"There is no such thing as objectivity. Objectivity is the question of the conscience of the one who writes.

Excerpts =Posthumous and non-reportage works= In Ten Inny (\\"The Other\\"), a collection of lectures delivered in Vienna, Graz and Cracow, published shortly before his death, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski laments a state of affairs perpetuated by the myths which inculcate the notion of the Other as sub-human or non-human. He saw encountering the Other as the main challenge for the twenty-first century. The posthumously published Ho dato voce ai poveri: dialogo con i giovani (\\"I Gave a Voice to the Poor: Conversations with the Youth\\"; Trent, Il Margine, 2007; subsequently published in Poland as Da≈Çem g≈Ços ubogim. Rozmowy z m≈Çodzie≈ºƒÖ; Cracow, Znak, 2008) is a record of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's interactions with the students of the University of Bolzano in Italy in October 2006; while RwƒÖcy nurt historii. Zapiski o XX i XXI wieku (\\"In the Whirlpools of History: Jottings on the 20th and the 21st Centuries\\"; Cracow, Znak, 2007) is a compilation of interviews and lectures, reflecting Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's training as a historian and dealing with contemporary issues and their historical and cross- cultural parallels (including such issues as globalisation, Islam, the birth of the Third World, and the dawn of the Pacific civilisation). Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's pronouncements on current affairs were noteworthy: he thought that the causes of the 9/11 tragedy, for example, were too complex to lend themselves to an exhaustively thorough analysis at present, although he offered an extensive and sophisticated exposition of some of the key elements of the puzzle in the Clash of Civilisations. He was critical on the Clash of Civilisations theory which he saw as an American vision of the world. He told a BBC interviewer right after the attacks: \\"I greatly fear that we will waste this moment. That instead of meaningful dialogue, it will just be gates and metal detectors\\". In an interview granted in 2002 to the then editor-in-chief of the monthly Letras Libres, Ricardo Cayuela Gally, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski opined that the war on terror, owing to the asymmetrical character of the combatants engaged in it, could only be wonand indeed easily, within a monththrough a (re)introduction of \\"Stalinism\\", a method undesirable for the sole reason that it would leave the world under the permanent \\"hegemony\\" of the United States, a circumstance that would spell the end of \\"the free society\\". In Poland, since 1986 Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was also known as a poet:\\"The reporter as poet: The Polish writer Ryszard Kapuscinski may be one of our last great foreign correspondents in whose reports morality, philosophy and poetry exist side by side with fact.\\" by Ian Parker (The Independent, 18 September 1994), https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-reporter-as-poet-the- polish-writer-ryszard-kapuscinski-may-be-one-of-our-last-great-foreign- correspondents-in-whose-reports-morality-philosophy-and-poetry-exist-side-by- side-with-fact-now-something-of-a-media-star-he-joins-the-modern-historians- with-a-new-book-about-the-end-of-the-soviet-union-1449539.html Retrieved February 1, 2014. he privately confided in his Swedish translator, Anders Bodeg√•rd, that he considered this to be his primary identity. In November 2007 the Canadian publishing house Biblioasis published Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's selected poems in English, I Wrote Stone, the first English translation of his poetry. Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"Big events (...) may have been treated lyrically in his prose, but (...) these poems capture the moments between crises, impressions that carry a book-length argument in a few lines\\". Collected poems from his books were published in Poland and Canada in 2012 in both Polish and English in the book Collected Poems, translated by Diana Kuprel and Marek Kusiba. Although he was not the sole model for the role, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was given a portrayal as the main character in Andrzej Wajda's 1978 film Without Anesthesia. Aleksandar Hemon, the Bosnian-American novelist (who had previously impugned Robert D. Kaplan's stereotyping of \\"the Balkan mind\\"), in a critique of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's Africa writings published in The Village Voice, accused Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's readers of turning a blind eye to \\"the underlying proto- racist essentialism\\" that informs his vision of and his approach to the cultures of the continent: \\"[Kapu≈õci≈Ñski] fumes against the racism absurdly based on skin colour, and would probably be shocked if told that his obsessive listing of essential differences [between \\"the African mind\\" and \\"the European mind\\"] is essentially racist\\".Rice, Andrew (October 1, 2007). \\"The Passenger\\", The NationThe Economist magazine said, \\"[Kapu≈õci≈Ñski] creates an Africa of his own.\\" Reception Kapu≈õci≈Ñski had a global reputation, and is one of the Polish writers translated into the highest number of foreign languages. In an obituary published in Der Spiegel, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was described by German journalist Claus Christian Malzahn as \\"one of the most credible journalists the world has ever seen\\". Daniel Alarc√≥n, a Peruvian-American novelist, cited Kapu≈õci≈Ñski as a formative influence together with Dostoyevsky. The American journalist and reportage-writer Richard Bernstein, saw value in the \\"penetrating intelligence\\" of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's vision and in his \\"crystallised descriptive\\" style of writing. The British journalist Bill Deedes, who had witnessed the Rwandan genocide first-hand, said of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski that what he \\"writes about Africa is authoritative as well as captivating. His account of how the Hutus and the Tutsis were drawn into that dark night of genocide in Rwanda is the most enlightening I have read anywhere\\" and that he had \\"transformed journalism into literature in his writings about Africa\\". Professor Philip Melling of Swansea University has concurred with this opinion, citing Kapu≈õci≈Ñski as an authority on the Rwandan conflict.Cf. Philip Melling, Fundamentalism in America: Millennialism, Identity, and Militant Religion, Edinburgh, Edinburgh University Press, 1999, p. xiv. . Salman Rushdie wrote about him: \\"One Kapu≈õci≈Ñski is worth more than a thousand whimpering and fantasizing scribblers. His exceptional combination of journalism and art allows us to feel so close to what Kapu≈õci≈Ñski calls the inexpressible true image of war\\". \\"Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski nie ≈ºyje\\" Gazeta Wyborcza (23-01-2007). Frequently mentioned as a favorite to win the Nobel Prize in literature, he never did. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's dying before he could be awarded the Prize was bemoaned in the Swedish press as late as October 2010.\\"Bj√∂rn Wiman: Anna Politkovskajas minne vore v√§rt ett Nobelpris\\", Dagens Nyheter October 7, 2010. (\\"Polske Ryszard Kapuscinski gick dessv√§rre bort innan han fick priset...\\") Since his death he has been offered many epitaphs in the press, such as, \\"The master of modern journalism\\", \\"Translator of the World\\" and \\"The Greatest Reporter in the World\\", \\"Herodotus of our times\\", \\"Third World chronicler\\". Over the years, particularly since 1983 when The Emperor was named Book of the Year by The Sunday Times of London, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was the recipient of many international literary prizes that brought recognition to his creative oeuvre: these included, for example, the biennial Hanseatic Goethe Prize awarded by the Hamburg-based foundation, the Alfred Toepfer Stiftung, which he received in 1999; or the Italian Elsa Morante Prize (Premio Elsa Morante, Sezione Culture D'Europa) in 2005, for his Travels with Herodotus (the new category of the Premio Elsa Morante, called \\"Cultures of Europe\\", in effect a separate prize awarded by the same jury, having apparently been created specially for him). In 2001 Kapu≈õci≈Ñski received the literary Prix Tropiques of the French Development Agency for his book The Shadow of the Sun, published in France under the title √âb√®ne: Aventures africaines, which had a year earlier been named the best book of the year by the French literary monthly, Lire; the book also won the Italian literary award, Feudo Di Maida Prize (in full, Premio Letterario Internazionale Feudo Di Maida), for the year 2000. That same year (2000) Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was honoured with the prestigious Premio Internazionale Viareggio-Versilia, as well as having received the Creola Prize (Premio Creola) in Bologna (awarded for travel books and facilitation of intercultural encounters), and the \\"Premio Letterario 'Della Resistenza' of the Piedmontese city of Omegna (Premio Omegna). In 2003 Kapu≈õci≈Ñski received the Premio Grinzane Cavour per la Lettura in Turin; shared the Prince of Asturias Award (in the category \\"Communications and Humanities\\") with the Peruvian theologian Gustavo Guti√©rrez; and was awarded the Kreisky Prize (Bruno-Kreisky-Preis f√ºr das politische Buch) for the entirety of his work (\\"Sonderpreis f√ºr das publizistische Gesamtwerk\\"; the award ceremony having taken place in Vienna in May of the following year). As the doyen of literary reportage, he was the keynote speaker at the inaugural ceremony, held in Berlin in October 2003, for the Lettre Ulysses Awards for the Art of Reportage. In 2005 the Italian edition of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's poems (which appeared in print the previous year as Taccuino d'appunti in the translation of Silvano De Fanti) won the state- funded Naples Prize (Premio Napoli). To complete the round-up of Italian prizes, the next year Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was awarded a special category of the Ilaria Alpi Prize for the entirety of his career (Premio Ilaria Alpi alla carriera), one of the best-known of Italian journalistic awards, named for an Italian investigative reporter murdered in Somalia in 1994 (although the scope of the prize is limited to TV journalism, special categories of prizes for which he would not otherwise qualifyas also for example in the case of the Elsa Morante Prizehave been created for Kapu≈õci≈Ñski). Kapu≈õci≈Ñski received honorary doctorates from the University of Silesia (1997), the University of Wroc≈Çaw (2001), the University of Sofia (2002), the University of Gda≈Ñsk (2004), Jagiellonian University (2004). In June 2005 Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was invested with an honorary doctorate by the private Ramon Llull University of Barcelona, Spain; and in May 2006, just eight months before his death, he received a similar degree from the University of Udine in Italy. In 2010, the Council of the Capital City of Warsaw established the Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski Award for literary reportage as a form of distinction and promotion of the most worthwhile reportage books which touch on important contemporary issues, evoke reflection, and deepen our knowledge of the world of other cultures. =Controversy and biographies= Since at least 1987http://www.richardwebster.net/johnryle.html Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's veracity as a reporter has been disputed, and he responded with the explanation that his work had been allegorical.http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/recycled/2007/01/ryszard_kapuciski.html By his own account he chose to avoid dates, names, and orders of events.http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/press_box/2007/01/the_lies_of_ryszard_kapuciski.html Since at least 2001, there has been literary debate about to which genre Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's work should be categorized. A 2001 review by John Ryle concerned the Kapu≈õci≈Ñski memoir entitled The Shadow of the Sun released in the same year.John Ryle (2001), \\"At play in the bush of ghosts\\" originally published as the \\"Tales of Mythical Africa\\" by the Times Literary Supplement, 27 July 2001. Review of: Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski, The Shadow of the Sun, translated by Klara Glowczewska, 336 pp, Penguin Books, 2001. See: Reprint of the review in full. Ryle alleged that questions about the reliability of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's reportage began with The Emperor. Scrutinizing Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's translation of expressions of fealty by Ethiopian courtiers, Ryle said that \\"native speakers of Amharic say that these honorifics correspond to no known expressions in their language.\\" Ryle wrote that he visited Ethiopia in the 1990s when the action of The Shadow of the Sun was taking place. He said there were inaccuracies in the story, for example, that Mengistu's generals did not escape justice and that the 'academics' among them were few and far in between. Ryle noticed that the initials of Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's informants did not correspond to the names of witnesses in the trial of the Derg in Addis Ababa. He added that Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's description of the capital devoid of bookstores did not correspond to what he has seen on his last visit there, because he found six bookstores there. He also disputed Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's assertion that Haile Selassie did not read books by saying he had a library, was well read, and annotated documents. Ryle continued: Polish scholars Dr. Beata Nowacka (University of Silesia)Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu ≈ölƒÖskiego (2012), Beata Nowacka.

Their monograph was translated in 2010 to Spanish (Kapuscinski. Una biograf√≠a literaria) and in 2012 to Italian (Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski. Biografia di uno scrittore). Professor Silvano De Fanti from the University of Udine wrote Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's biography for the Opere (2009), published in Italian in the Meridiani series which aims to collect major writers of all times from all countries. In 2010, a Polish language monograph titled Kapu≈õci≈Ñski Non-Fiction written by Artur Domos≈Çawski was published in Warsaw.Artur Domos≈Çawski (2010), Kapu≈õci≈Ñski non-fiction, Wydawnictwo ≈öwiat ksiƒÖ≈ºki, Warszawa, Hardcover, , e-book: . ≈öwiat KsiƒÖ≈ºki is an imprint of Bertelsmann. Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's widow, Alicja Kapu≈õci≈Ñska, sought an injunction against Domos≈Çawski's book, claiming defamation and invasion of privacy. The injunction was rejected by the Polish court on the grounds that she had chosen to give Domos≈Çawski access to her husband's archive.Luke Harding (2 March 2010), Poland's ace reporter Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski accused of fiction-writing. The Guardian.com. In an interview with The Guardian Domos≈Çawski said: \\"Kapu≈õci≈Ñski was experimenting in journalism. He wasn't aware he had crossed the line between journalism and literature. I still think his books are wonderful and precious. But ultimately, they belong to fiction.\\" Domos≈Çawski's monograph was translated to English in 2012 by Antonia Lloyd-Jones and first published by Verso Books as Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski. A Life in 2012.Artur Domoslawski (2012), Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski: A Life. Verso Books. , 464 pages. Google Books. Neal Ascherson defended Kapu≈õci≈Ñski in March 2010 by saying: \\"None of the doubts, as far as I can see, are about the despatches and features he sent to newspapers, or to the Polish Press Agency. They are about his books. The adventures and encounters he describes in his books are on a different level of veracity. Like his friend Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Kapu≈õci≈Ñski used to talk about \\"literary reportage\\". You're meant to believe what you are being told, but not in every literal detail. ... Scrupulous in his journalism, in his books he was capable of inventing in order to make a truth even truer. He was a great story-teller, but not a liar.\\" https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/mar/03/ryszard-kapuscinski- story-liar Timothy Garton Ash was more critical. Ash wrote later that month (reprinted in his Facts Are Subversive): \\"with Kapuscinski, we keep crossing from the Kenya of fact to the Tanzania of fiction, and back again, but the transition is nowhere explicitly signalled.\\"Timothy Garton Ash (10 March 2010), Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski. Opinion. Bearing witness is a sacred trust. The Guardian.com. Reviewing the English translation of Domos≈Çawski's book for The Financial Times in 2012, the then permanent secretary of the Nobel-awarding Swedish Academy, Peter Englund, said: \\"In any case, the \\"literary\\" in \\"literary reportage\\" doesn't absolve you of your duty to the facts. Neither is it possible, in my mind, to see it as a sliding scale, in which you are able slowly to introduce droplets of fiction into a factual text until, at a certain point, the mixture transforms into pure fiction. No, once an element of fiction is introduced into a text everything immediately turns into fiction ‚Äì maybe fiction with a strong resemblance to the real world, but still fiction.\\"https://www.ft.com/content/b63cf254-ed1d-11e1-95ba-00144feab49a The first biographers, Nowacka and ZiƒÖtek, responded to Domos≈Çawski's allegations with their own new book, Literatura non-fiction. Czytanie Kapu≈õci≈Ñskiego po Domos≈Çawskim (Non‚Äëfiction literature: Reading Kapu≈õci≈Ñski after Domos≈Çawski) which was published in Polish by the University of Silesia Press in 2013. They oppose the accusation of creating a myth, and his own legend, as well as confabulations and opportunism, showing a selected and tendentious usage of the author's life knowledge, the lack of comprehension of literary reportage, manipulation with texts and quotations, as well as numerous factual and technical mistakes made by Domos≈Çawski. In 2013 the publisher of Domos≈Çawski's book apologized to Alicja Kapu≈õci≈Ñska and her daughter.An announcement by the publisher ≈öwiat KsiƒÖ≈ºki was published on October 18, 2013, in \\"Gazeta Wyborcza\\" newspaper. It reads (in Polish): ZarzƒÖd Sp√≥≈Çki ≈öwiat KsiƒÖ≈ºki Sp z o.o. wyra≈ºa ubolewanie z powodu naruszenia d√≥br osobistych Pani Alicji Kapu≈õci≈Ñskiej i Pani Rene Maisner, to jest prawa do prywatno≈õci, dobrego imienia i godno≈õci oraz kultu po zmar≈Çym Ryszardzie Kapu≈õci≈Ñskim poprzez wydawanie i rozpowszechnianie ksiƒÖ≈ºki \\"Kapu≈õci≈Ñski non-fiction\\" zawierajƒÖce nieprawdziwe informacje, odno≈õnie Pani Alicji Kapu≈õci≈Ñskiej i Pani Rene Maisner. In May 2015 amendments were ordered by a court in Warsaw which also ruled that Domos≈Çawski should apologise to Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's widow, however in August 2015 the same court has ruled that the author will not have to apologise to Kapu≈õci≈Ñski's daughter.We know the verdict on the biography of Ryszard Kapu≈õci≈Ñski Polish Radio SA 27 May 2015http://www.thenews.pl/1/9/Artykul/218696,Kapuscinski-daughter-loses-case- against-her-fathers-biographer- Kapuscinski-daughter-loses-case-against-her- fathers-biographer Selected books =Works available in English= * Another Day of Life (Jeszcze dzie≈Ñ ≈ºycia) (1976) * The Soccer War (Wojna futbolowa) (1978) * The Emperor: Downfall of an Autocrat (Cesarz) (1978) * Shah of Shahs (Szachinszach) (1982) * Imperium (Imperium) (1993) * The Shadow of the Sun (Heban) (1998) * Our Responsibilities in a Multicultural World (Powinno≈õci obywatela ≈õwiata wielokulturowego) (2002)Bilingual edition; tr.

It stands in contrast to the concept of intensionality, which is concerned with whether the internal definitions of objects are the same. Example Consider the two functions f and g mapping from and to natural numbers, defined as follows: * To find f(n), first add 5 to n, then multiply by 2. * To find g(n), first multiply n by 2, then add 10. These functions are extensionally equal; given the same input, both functions always produce the same value. But the definitions of the functions are not equal, and in that intensional sense the functions are not the same. Similarly, in natural language there are many predicates (relations) that are intensionally different but are extensionally identical. For example, suppose that a town has one person named Joe, who is also the oldest person in the town. Then, the two argument predicates \\"has one person named\\", \\"is the oldest person in\\" are intensionally distinct, but extensionally equal for \\"Joe\\" in that \\"town\\" now. In mathematics The extensional definition of function equality, discussed above, is commonly used in mathematics. Sometimes additional information is attached to a function, such as an explicit codomain, in which case two functions must not only agree on all values, but must also have the same codomain, in order to be equal. A similar extensional definition is usually employed for relations: two relations are said to be equal if they have the same extensions. In set theory, the axiom of extensionality states that two sets are equal if and only if they contain the same elements. In mathematics formalized in set theory, it is common to identify relations--and, most importantly, functions--with their extension as stated above, so that it is impossible for two relations or functions with the same extension to be distinguished. Other mathematical objects are also constructed in such a way that the intuitive notion of \\"equality\\" agrees with set-level extensional equality; thus, equal ordered pairs have equal elements, and elements of a set which are related by an equivalence relation belong to the same equivalence class. Type-theoretical foundations of mathematics are generally not extensional in this sense, and setoids are commonly used to maintain a difference between intensional equality and a more general equivalence relation (which generally has poor constructibility or decidability properties).

Freeman, along with childhood friend Dean Ween (Mickey Melchiondo), started the group in the mid-1980s. Freeman announced his departure from Ween in 2012, shortly after releasing Marvelous Clouds, his first solo album. After leaving Ween, he stopped using the name Gene Ween and performed under his birth name Aaron Freeman. In 2014 he formed a new five- piece band called Freeman. In 2015, Freeman returned to using the Gene Ween name for his \\"Gene Ween Does Billy Joel\\" concerts, saying it was a positive thing: In November 2015, Ween announced a February 2016 reunion for three shows in Colorado, with later dates subsequently announced. Career Freeman performing with Ween in November 2007 Freeman and Melchiondo met in an eighth grade typing class in 1984, in New Hope, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, where they both grew up. Both of them talked about bands they liked and playing their own music. Soon, they hung out and began jamming, recording most of what they put together. Ween's music slowly progressed from a bedroom-style recording project, eventually signing to a major record label and transforming into a full live band. In May 2012, Freeman suddenly announced his departure from Ween, as an attempt to rehabilitate himself after years of drug and alcohol abuse, which peaked during Ween's 2011 tour. Even before his departure from Ween, Freeman had maintained a solo career. He has performed solo concerts with artists such as Jon Anderson of Yes. Around 2008, Freeman launched the Gene Ween Band, where he plays alongside Ween bassist Dave Dreiwitz, and with guitarist Scott Metzger and drummer Joe Russo. In 2012, he released Marvelous Clouds, his first solo album under the name Aaron Freeman. The album consisted entirely of cover versions of Rod McKuen songs. In 2014, Freeman formed a new full band called Freeman and released an eponymous album of original material with them in August of that year. He continues to tour with Freeman, as well as perform acoustic shows accompanied by Freeman bassist Joe Young. In 2015, Freeman announced he would be fronting a Billy Joel tribute band that would feature, among others Paul Green and Dan Hickey. Two shows under the banner \\"Gene Ween Does Billy Joel\\" are scheduled for Woodstock and Brooklyn. On May 22, 2015, Freeman joined Umphrey's McGee onstage at the Summer Camp Music Festival under the name 'Godboner' for a set of Ween covers. Freeman was billed as 'Gene Ween' for this appearance. On November 16, 2015, Ween announced that they would reunite for three concerts at the 1stBank Center in Broomfield, Colorado in February 2016. Ween has continued to play and tour since. Personal life Aaron Freeman lives with his wife Leah Ben- Ari and their son. He has another child from a previous relationship, born in 1998. Freeman has talked about drug use, but does not often divulge specifics. He speaks openly and in detail about his personal life, drug use, and time spent in Ween on Marc Maron's W.T.F. podcast (episode 309).

The position was established in the early 12th century. The Dean presides over the College of Cardinals, serving as primus inter pares in the college. He always holds the rank of cardinal bishop. The Dean of the College of Cardinals is assisted by the Vice-Dean. Both are elected by and from the Cardinal Bishops who are not Eastern Catholic patriarchs and their election is subject to papal confirmation. Except for presiding, the Dean and Vice-Dean have no power over the other cardinals. In the order of precedence in the Catholic Church as the senior Cardinal Bishops, the Dean and Vice-Dean are placed second and third, respectively, after the pope. The Dean is often, but not necessarily, the longest-serving member of the whole College. It had been customary for centuries for the longest-serving of the six cardinal bishops of suburbicarian sees to be Dean. This was required by canon law from 1917 until 1965, when Pope Paul VI empowered the six to elect the Dean from among their number. This election was a formality until the time of Pope John Paul II. With a document dated 29 November and published on 21 December 2019, Pope Francis, when accepting the resignation of Cardinal Angelo Sodano as Dean, established that going forward the Dean of the College of Cardinals will serve a five-year term that can be renewed once. Sodano received the title \\"Dean Emeritus\\" upon resigning on 21 December 2019. In anticipation of the election of Sodano's successor, Francis said: \\"I am hoping they will elect someone who can carry this important responsibility full time.\\" Previously the Dean held the position until death or resignation; there was no mandatory age of retirement. Responsibilities The dean summons the conclave for the purposes of electing a new pope following a death or resignation. The Dean presides over the daily meetings of the College of Cardinals in advance of the conclave and then presides over the conclave if his age does not prohibit his participation. The dean also has the responsibility of communicating the \\"news of the Pope's death to the Diplomatic Corps accredited to the Holy See and to the Heads of the respective Nations\\". He is the public face of the Holy See until a new pope is elected. If he participates in the conclave, the dean asks the pope-elect if he accepts the election, and then asks the new pope what name he wishes to use. If the newly elected pope is not already a bishop, the dean ordains him a bishop. The dean has \\"the title of the diocese of Ostia, together with that of any other church to which he already has a title,\\" such as his suburbicarian diocese. This has been the case since 1914, by decree of Pope Pius X‚Äîprevious deans had given up their suburbicarian see and taken the joint title of Ostia and Velletri, which were separated in that same 1914 decree.

List of Deans The following is the list of Deans of the Sacred College of Cardinals, separated into three groups to account for the Western Schism, which ended after the Council of Constance. The earliest attested reference to the \\"College of Cardinals\\" is at the Council of Reims in 1148.John F. Broderick, S.J., \\"The Sacred College of Cardinals: Size and Geographical Composition (1099‚Äì1986),\\" Archivum Historiae Pontificiae, Vol. 25 (1987), pp. 7-71, at p. 9 note 6.

Without the existence of the College, of course, a Dean of the College of Cardinals would be impossible.

It is 10 km south of the Spanish border and 22 km south of Ver√≠n (Spain). The population in 2011 was 41,243,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 591.23 km2. The municipality is the second most populous of the district of Vila Real (the district capital, Vila Real, is 60 km south on the A24 motorway). With origins in the Roman civitas Aqu√¶ Flavi√¶, Chaves has developed into a regional center. The urban area has 17,535 residents (2001).Uma popula√ß√£o que se urbaniza, uma avalia√ß√£o recente - Cidades, 2004 Nuno Pires Soares, Instituto Geogr√°fico Portugu√™s (Geographic Institute of Portugal) History Titus Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus, patron of Aquae Flaviae The remnants of ancient Keep of the Castle of Chaves Artefacts discovered in the region of Chaves identify the earliest settlement of humans dating back to the Paleolithic. Remnants discovered in Mairos, Pastoria and S√£o Louren√ßo, those associated with transient proto-historic settlements and castros, show a human presence in the Alto T√¢mega dating to the Chalcolithic. The region has seen persistent human settlement since Roman legions conquered and occupied the fertile valley of the T√¢mega River, constructing a nascent outpost and taking over the existing castros in the area. The settlement was located at the convergence of three important Roman roads: the Bracara Augusta, Asturica, and Lamecum that crossed the Roman Province of Gallaecia, linking Rome to the region's natural resources. It was a military centre known for its baths, which lasted until the 16th century. This civilization constructed protective walls to protect the local population; spanned the river with the bridge;The construction of the bridge was a remodelling of the existing bridge, which was constructed by various tribes that already lived in the vicinity (CUP, 1970, p.13) promoted the baths (with its warm medicinal waters); exploited local mines and alluvial deposits and other natural resources. Its importance led to the urban nucleus being elevated to the status ofmunicipality in 79 AD, during the reign of the first Flavian Caesar, Titus Flavius Caesar Vespasianus Augustus. Its benefactor consequently influenced its toponymy, becoming known as Aquae Flaviae. Artefacts from the area around the Matriz church indicate that Aquae Flaviae's centre was located in this place, in addition to an ancient headstone showing gladiatorial combat.Discovered in 2006, the archeological remnants were found and removed to the Museu da Regi√£o Flaviense (). Rome's hegemony lasted until the 3rd century, when, successively, the proto-Germanic tribes of the Suebi, Visigoths and Alani colonized the imperial settlements of Chaves. Wars between Remismund and Frumar followed over their claims to the throne, which almost completely destroyed the village (it was settled in favour of Frumar, who imprisoned Id√°cio, the notable Bishop of Aquae Flaviae). Ironically, the Romans were complicit in Aquae Flaviae's near destruction.Thompson (1982), p.167; Hydatius wrote: Inter Frumarium et Rechimundum oritur de regni potestate dissensio (\\"Between Frumar and Rechimund arose a dissension of the power of the kingdom\\") Barbarian dominion lasted until the Moors invaded from North Africa, defeating the Visigoth King Roderic at the beginning of the 8th century. In course, the name of Aquae Flaviae began to disappear, being supplanted by the more Hispanic-sounding Aquae Calidae ().Robert Southey (1827), p. 172 Arab rule of the Iberian peninsula forced many Christians to escape from Chaves into the mountains in the northwest. Battles between the Christians and Muslim forces then continued until the 11th century, when Alfonso V of Le√≥n reconquered the territory. After finally defeating the last vestiges of Moorish influence, he reconstructed, settled and encircled the settlement of Chaves with walls, in addition to establishing a Jewish quarter in the community. It was in the reign of Afonso I of Portugal that it was taken from Le√≥n and firmly integrated into the Kingdom of Portugal domain (1160). Owing to its geographic location (on Portugal's northern frontier with Spain), King Denis, ordered the construction of a castle to protect the kingdom's border. During the reign of Afonso II, when the king continued to provoke the ire of the Papacy, Portuguese knights attacked the Galician tenancy of his half-brother Martin Sanches (who lived in the kingdom of Alfonso IX of Le√≥n), possibly since the Bishop of Braga had estates in that region. Provoking Sanches to invade northern Portugal.CUP (1970), p.117 The Leonese fought battles in Barcelos, Braga and Guimar√£es, where they defeated Portuguese forces, before retiring to Galicia with their spoils. At the same time, Alfonso IX of Le√≥n seized Chaves, which remained in Leonese hands until the reign of King Sancho II, when he and Ferdinand III met in 1230/1231.CUP (1970), p.122 This was likely a self- serving decision on Fernando's part, as he was fearful that Leonese barons would support Sancho against him. Alfonso IX continued to occupy Chaves as a method of ensuring his wife, Teresa, would be able to enjoy her properties in Portugal. During the Portuguese Interregnum, the nobility of Chaves supported Beatrice of Portugal, as she was heir presumptive to King Ferdinand I, since he left no male heirs. The potential loss of independence of Portugal, through her marriage to John I of Castile resulted in the rebellion by the Master of the Order of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal), who would garner the support of the Portuguese Cortes, thus laying the seeds for his triumph at the Battle of Aljubarrota.CUP (1970), p.179 Yet, many nobles refused to break their oaths of fielty to Beatrice (including in Chaves), necessitating John's travel to Porto in force and scaring the nobles of Chaves and Bragan√ßa into capitulating. The remnants of the Roman baths, and the houses used to assist the invalid, were demolished by the Count of Mesquitella at the end of the 17th century, in order to reinforce the defense of Chaves.Robert Southey (1827), p.173 French forces invaded and attacked in 1807, during the Siege of Chaves, part of the Peninsular Wars.CUP (1970), p.400 On 7 March 1808, Soult's forces invaded northern Portugal to remove British forces from Iberia. Brigadier Francisco Silveira was charged with the defense of Chaves, but his 6000 men were unable to support its defense, and quickly abandoned the castle.Robert Southey (1827), p.174 An attempt to defend Chaves by Francisco Pizarro was futile, and the city surrendered to French forces shortly after the engagement. With too many troops to imprison Soult released many under oath, in order to continue the attack on the main forces who had retreated to the south. But Francisco Silveira did not quit, and as the main French went on to defeat the Anglo-Portuguese alliance at the First Battle of Porto, Silveira retook Chaves. On 20 September 1837, the Convention of Chaves, which followed the Battle of Ruiv√£es and which ended Chartist or Marshall's Revolt, was signed in Chaves. Chaves was also a site of various religious apparitions, during the decade of 1830, eventually resulting in the construction of the Santu√°rio da Nossa Senhora Aparecida (). On 8 July 1912, forces loyal to the former monarchy, under the command of Henrique Paiva Couceiro, confronted government forces, commanded by Colonel Ribeiro de Carvalho, during the second monarchist incursion.The Republican forces were eulogized in toponymic references in Lisbon, with the designation of an avenue in their honour (Avenida Defensores de Chaves), between Avenida Casal Ribeiro and Campo Pequeno.CUP (1970), p.452 On 12 March 1929, the town of Chaves was elevated to the category of city. Geography =Physical geography= A glimpse of the sedimentary Chaves basin, consisting of the parishes of Santa Maria Maior and Madalena Chaves is in the extreme north of Portugal, bounded on the north by Galicia (Spain), on the east by the municipalities of Vinhais and Valpa√ßos, on the south by the municipality of Vila Pouca de Aguiar and on the west by the municipalities of Montalegre and Boticas. Chaves is one of the six municipalities of the Alto T√¢mega, situated in the district of Vila Real, strategically positioned in the northwest of the Iberian peninsula and accessed by important international highways. The region is dominated by the Quaternary Chaves sedimentary basin, a graben aligned on a north-northeast to south-southwest orientation bounded by the Hercynian massif and metamorphic schistose formations.Santos et al. (1997), p.87 Mixed with the schistose complex, there are bands of graphitic slates, mainly in the southern part of the urbanized area of Chaves and south-east of Fai√µes. To the north, and into Galicia, the basin extends into the depression of the Verin Basin. One of the oldest formations in the region, it dates back to the Ordovician period ( between 488.3¬±1.7 to 443.7¬±1.5 million years ago), is composed of schist and graywacke deposits. During the Ordovician-Silurian geological periods quartzites and schists were formed, metamorphosed by Hercynian granitic intrusions, at the end of the Paleozoic. The Alpine orogeny was the main cause of extensive tectonic activities and it was responsible for the formation of the hydrothermal field within the region.Santos et al. (1997), p.88 The Chaves graben was formed by the relative motion of the block with different types of sediments being settled. The most recent formations are a sedimentary series (lacustrine, alluvial, colluvial, detritic, etc.) with variable thickness that had their origin during the Miocene.UTAD, ed. (1992) Two main faults cross and influence the tectonic activities: the north-northeast by south-southeast Chaves-Verin Fault and a fault system crossing near Fai√µes and Santo Est√™v√£o. The first fault developed from late Hercynian tectonic episode occurring between 280 and 300 million years ago, that developed into an almost north- south direction into the lithosphere.Santos et al. (1995) Intense neotectonic activity reactivated these old fractures, originating in a complex pattern of faults in the sedimentary basin. Thermal springs Mineral waters are the clearest evidence of these recent tectonic fractures. The Penacova-R√©gua- Ver√≠n Fault, is an active formation that extends longitudinally for 500 kilometres, intermingled with other faults resulting in subterranean hydrology. The thermal springs, principally those in Campilho and Salus Vidago (in Vila de Vidago) have developed from this mixture of circumstances. With temperatures reaching , these mineral springs (bicarbonates, sodium, silicates and fluoride) in the vicinity of the city of Chaves, have provided a potential source of income. The hot springs () were known since the Roman period, when the town was Aquae Flaviae; the Waters of Flavius were an important social gathering point, but fell into disuse as the town was slowly abandoned by attacks. The spas belong to a vast area of hydrothermal springs that stretch from Ver√≠n (in Galicia) to Pedras Salgadas, 30 km from Chaves (on the road to Vila Real). Despite its vastness and abundance of water, this thermal system is little utilized; of the nine groups of thermal springs there are only adequate installations in four of them: Chaves, Carvalhelhos, Vidago, Pedras Salgadas, and Ver√≠n. The waters of the spring, that are captured in three springs within Chaves, have mean temperatures of (the hottest bicarbonate waters in Europe). The modern spa industry in Chaves use these waters for numerous treatments, including stomach, liver, intestinal, and kidney ailments, through oral ingestion. Many small guesthouses in the old part of the town are dependent on the influx of these visitors. The thermal spas are located between the castle and the river, in front of a large area of grass- covered park with playgrounds and tennis courts. =Climate= An example of the winter climate in Chaves, in the shadow of the Castle Keep of Chaves Chaves has a Mediterranean climate (K√∂ppen: Csa) with continental and oceanic influences. The mountains between the Minho region and Tr√°s-os-Montes serve as a climatic barrier and lessen rainfall closer to the interior. Winters can be cold; January highs rarely surpass and lows are often below zero. Fog often hovers over the valley during the winter, usually lifting by midday, but on rare occasions can last for days. Cold fronts from the Arctic can often cause daytime temperatures to drop below 5 ¬∞C. Snow is infrequent, especially in recent years although the surrounding hills often receive a dusting. Temperatures in July and August frequently pass 30 ¬∞C with nighttime temperatures dropping to 13 ¬∞C. Summer brush fires can often make this season unpleasant although in recent years they have diminished, perhaps because most of the forest cover has been burnt. =Human geography= Government is administrated by the Municipal Chamber of Chaves (), while locally the municipality is divided into the following parishes (freguesias): * √Åguas Frias * Anelhe * Bustelo * Calv√£o e Soutelinho da Raia * Cimo de Vila da Castanheira * Curalha * Eiras, S√£o Juli√£o de Montenegro e Cela * Ervededo * Fai√µes * Lama de Arcos * Loivos e P√≥voa de Agra√ß√µes * Ma√ßos * Madalena e Samai√µes * Mairos * Moreiras * Nogueira da Montanha * Oura * Outeiro Seco * Paradela * Planalto de Monforte (Oucidres e Borbadela) * Redondelo * Sanfins * Santa Cruz-Trindade e Sanjurge * Santa Leoc√°dia * Santa Maria Maior * Santo Ant√≥nio de Monforte * Santo Est√™v√£o * S√£o Pedro de Agost√©m * S√£o Vicente * Soutelo e Seara Velha * Travancas e Roriz * Tronco * Vala de Anta * Vidago, Arcoss√≥, Selhariz e Vilarinho das Paranheiras * Vila Verde da Raia * Vilar de Nantes * Vilarelho da Raia * Vilas Boas * Vilela do T√¢mega * Vilela Seca Demographics { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } In the past 127 years, the municipality has seen a 29% increase in local population (from 31815 in 1864 to 40940 in 1991). This was not a gradual nor homogeneous increase, since there were periods of extreme growth or rapid decline. During the 20th century, growth after 1920 is notably influenced by the restriction of trans-Atlantic emigration, just like after 1991, the population decreases were associated with liberal emigration policies as a result of the Maastricht Treaty. The parish populations have seen fluctuations, although the most recent census show that 31 of these agglomerations had population levels in 1991 much lower than their first tabulation. Further, analysis of the data identifies that the municipal increase (29%) was primarily from the more urbanized parishes, while peripheral rural/mountainous parishes show net decreases. Many of the local people have emigrated to settlements in northern Europe in addition to France, but commonly return or visit their villages for weddings or village festivals. Chaves has been isolated from the coastal urban centers and has suffered from a lack of convenient road communications. Recently, a new four-lane highway (A24) was opened to traffic. It links Chaves to Vila Real, and to the border with Spain. In Vila Pouca de Aguiar the highway also connects with the A7 that leads to Porto. City The population of the city encompasses 17,535 residents in the parishes of Santa Cruz-Trinidade, Madalena, and Santa Maria Maior: these parishes form the urbanized population of the city of Chaves. Although many of the older buildings outside the historical walls were demolished to make way for apartment blocks, the medieval quarter with its Rua Direita and Rua de Santo Ant√≥nio have been declared historic zones. In these areas there are narrow multi-story dwellings, whose origin has been limited by the walled city. Historically, the old quarter was the city, and few buildings were located outside its walls, since its frontier location and the imminent risk of invasion impeded the construction of homes outside the barriers. Consequently, space was limited and land primarily used for multi-purpose dwellings, resulting in very narrow streets and multi-story structures (with balconies that extend over the streets and protected the citizenry). Many of the lower floors were occupied by shops or small businesses, while the residents lived in the upper stories. Remnants of these verandas are still visible in the medieval quarter. The walled city was at the forefront of the political turmoils during the Reconquista, transited by armies and sacked by enemies. Chaves was built, destroyed, and rebuilt several times by either faction (Christian and Muslim), when they occupied the castle (it is likely that for some periods the town was completely abandoned). In 1253, Afonso III supported the reconstruction of the castle. By 1258, Chaves was granted the status of a vila (or town). While the walls were eventually rebuilt, the advent of artillery would make the castle's fortifications obsolete, and its importance waned, while the historical battlements fell into ruins. On 15 November 2009 an extensive green space on the east side of the T√¢mega River, between the Engenheiro Carmona Bridge and the Public Gardens, was opened to the public. It is an area with playgrounds, pedestrian and cycling paths, a beach football pitch, and a large grassy area. A modern pedestrian bridge was constructed to link the park and recreational area with the hot springs on the west bank of the river. At the same time cycling and walking paths were built on both banks of the river extending north for several kilometers. The pedestrian bridge, which is approximately 90 ft, is Chave's tallest and most expensive bridge. Economy Agriculture and services are still the main sources of income. The traditional prosperity of Chaves comes, mainly, from a highly fertile plain, nine kilometres long and three to five wide, referred to as the\\"veiga\\". Since the land can be irrigated with canals there is intensive farming of potatoes, corn, rye, hay, while plots of vegetables are also commonplace in the local market. The main canal begins near Vila Verde da Raia and crosses the valley on the right bank of the T√¢mega as far as Nantes. On the whole, the land is made up of small plots that are rarely economically viable. There is some dairy farming, and a milk production unit on the south side of town, but few cows can be seen in the valley. In general most of the farmers are of retirement age and farming is often pursued more as a hobby than as a profession. In addition to agriculture there are some small industries producing glass, tiles, and food products. Like Vila Pouca de Aguiar, located thirty kilometres south, this is a land of granite; there are several granite extraction and finishing industries located in Chaves, in addition to three brickworks, located on the south side of the city. Further, two mineral water plants, located in Vidago, belong to the municipality. =Transportation= It is serviced by A24 motorway, which links Chaves with the south, to Viseu, Coimbra and Figueira da Foz, connecting to Vila Pouca de Aguiar by the A7 (which acts as the gateway to the southern Tr√°s-os-Montes), and the N103 from Bragan√ßa to Braga. Chaves is located 415 kilometres from Lisbon, 105 kilometres from Porto and just 55 kilometres from the district capital, Vila Real. Between 1921 and 1990 Chaves was the northern terminus station of the Corgo line, a narrow gauge railway line which linked Chaves with Vila Real and Regua (the junction station for main line trains to Porto). The section between Chaves and Vila Real closed in 1990 and the remainder of the line closed in 2009. Chaves Airport, a small, single runway airport for light aircraft, also serves the town. Architecture The town of Chaves is built upon a long military history, that includes many fortifications or vestiges of battlements. Apart from the medieval castle and 17th century forts (Forte de S√£o Francisco andForte de S√£o Neutel), two medieval fortifications still exist: Santo Est√™v√£o Tower (in the village of the same name north of Chaves) and Monforte Castle (in the hills east of the town). =Prehistoric= * Bulideira Stone () * Castro of Alto do Vamba () * Castro of Curalha () * Castro of Muradal () * Castro of Outeiro dos Mouros () * Castro of Santiago do Monte () * Castro of Vale de Lagares () * Prehistoric Rock-Art Site of Bustelo () * Prehistoric Rock-Art Site of Eiras () * Prehistoric Rock-Art Site of Outeiro Machado () =Civic= The emblematic symbol of Chaves, the historic Roman bridge of Emperor Trajan The former residence of the Majorat of Vilar de Perdizes, now the municipal palace/hall of Chaves * Agrarian School of Alves Teixeira () * Agricultural Cooperative of Chaves () * Agricultural School of Chaves () * Bridge of Arco () * Bridge of Erdevedo () * Bridge of Guilherme () * Bridge of Meirinho () * Bridge of Missa () * Bridge of Ribela () * Bridge of Oura () * Bridge of Santiago () * Bridge of Trajan (), a symbol of Chaves, the bridge was constructed during the reign of Emperors Vespasian and Trajan to span the T√¢mega River and connect the Roman provincial towns of Astorga and Bracara Augusta, identifiable by columns, that identify the bridge and its dedication to Emperor; * Caixa Geral de Dep√≥sitos () * Cine-Theatre of Chaves () * Estate of Macieira em Casas Novas () * Forest Administration of Chaves () * Frontier Station of Vila Verde da Raia () * Fountain of √Åguas da Facha () * Fountain of Casa dos Montes () * Fountain of Castel√µes () * Fountain of Couto () * Fountain of Cruzeiro () * Fountain of Curalha () * Fountain of Lagoinha () * Fountain of Mina () * Fountain of Olmo () * Fountain of Povo de Castel√µes () * Fountain of Quinta de Humberto Teixeira () * Fountain of Santo Ant√≥nio de Monforte () * Fountain of Santa Marinha () * Fountain of Vila Frade () * Hospital of the Santa Casa da Miseric√≥ridia () * Hospital of S√£o Jo√£o de Deus (), also known as the Church of Madalena, this 18th century building was built during the reign of King John VI (his coat-of-arms appears on the main door), as a chapel and military hospital,The military hospital, known as the School of Anatomy and Surgery of Chaves, was one of the four schools of surgery in the country, lasting until the last century. but includes many Neoclassic and Baroque elements (including a high facade). * Hotel-Palace of Vidago () * Kiln of Povo de Castel√µes () * Markers of Ervededo () * Manorhouse of Azeredo () * Manorhouse of the Braganzas () * Manorhouse of the Machados () * Manorhouse of the Montalv√µes () * Manorhouse of the Viscounts of Ros√°rio () * Municipal Council of Chaves () * Municipal Council of Ervededo () * Municipal Stadium Eng.

It was piloted by Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager. The flight took off from Edwards Air Force Base's 15,000 foot (4,600 m) runway in the Mojave Desert on December 14, 1986, and ended 9 days, 3 minutes and 44 seconds later on December 23, setting a flight endurance record. The aircraft flew westerly 26,366 statute miles (42,432 km; the FAI accredited distance is 40,212 km) at an average altitude of 11,000 feet (3,350 m). Design and development Voyager on display in the National Air and Space Museum The aircraft was first imagined by Jeana Yeager, Dick Rutan, and Dick's brother Burt Rutan when they were at lunch in 1981. The idea was sketched out on the back of a napkin. Voyager was built in Mojave, California over a period of five years, mainly by volunteers working under both the Rutan Aircraft Factory and an organization named Voyager Aircraft. Burt Rutan served as the lead designer for the project. The airframe made of fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar weighed 939 pounds (426 kg) when empty. With the engines included, the unladen weight of the plane was 2250 lb (1020.6 kg). However, when it was fully loaded before the historic flight it weighed 9,694.5 pounds (4,397 kg) due to the amount of fuel required for the long-distance flight.Rutan VoyagerSmithsonian National Air and Space Museum. The aircraft had an estimated lift-to-drag ratio (L/D) of 27.David Noland, \\"Steve Fossett and Burt Rutan's Ultimate Solo: Behind the Scenes\\", Popular Mechanics, Feb. 2005 (web version ). The canard and wing airfoils were custom-designed, and the aircraft was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics.Lednicer, David, \\"A VSAERO Analysis of Several Canard Configured Aircraft\\", SAE paper 881485, presented at the SAE Aerospace Technology Conference and Exposition, Anaheim, California, October 1988. Vortex generators were added to the canard to reduce sensitivity to surface contamination.Bragg, M. B. and Gregorek, G. M., \\"An Experimental Study of a High Performance Canard Airfoil with Boundary Layer Trip and Vortex Generators\\", AIAA Paper No. 86-0781-CP, The 14th Aerodynamic Testing Conference Publication, March 1986. Voyager had front and rear propellers, powered by separate engines. It was originally flown on June 22, 1984, powered by Lycoming O-235 engines with fixed-pitch propellers. In November 1985, the aircraft was rolled out, fitted with world-flight engines, an air-cooled Teledyne Continental O-240 in the forward location and a liquid- cooled Teledyne Continental IOL-200 in the aft location. Both were fitted with wooden, variable-pitch electrically actuated MT-Propellers. The plan was for the rear engine to be operated throughout the flight. The front engine was intended to provide additional power for takeoff and the initial part of the flight under heavy load. On July 15, 1986, Dick Rutan and Yeager completed a test flight off the coast of California, in which they flew for 111 hours and 44 minutes, traveling in twenty circuits between San Luis Obispo and Stewarts Point, California, breaking the previous record held since 28 May 1931 by a Bellanca CH-300 fitted with a Packard DR-980 diesel engine, piloted by Walter Edwin Lees and Frederic Brossy which had set a record by staying aloft for 84 hours and 32 minutes without being refueled. The first attempt at the Voyager test flight had been marred by the failure of a propeller pitch-change motor and an emergency landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base. On a test flight on September 29, 1986, the airplane had to make an emergency landing due to a propeller blade departing the aircraft. As a result, the decision was made to switch to aluminium Hartzell hydraulically actuated propellers. In a crash program, Hartzell made custom propellers for the aircraft, which were first flown on November 15, 1986.Roncz, John G., \\"Propeller Development for the Rutan Voyager\\", SAE paper 891034, presented at the SAE General Aviation Aircraft Meeting & Exposition, Wichita, Kansas, April 1989. World flight Voyager's world flight takeoff took place on the longest runway at Edwards AFB at 8:01 am local time on December 14, 1986, with 3,500 of the world's press in attendance. As the plane accelerated, the tips of the wings, which were heavily loaded with fuel, were damaged as they unexpectedly flew down and scraped against the runway, ultimately causing pieces (winglets) to break off at both ends. (The pilot had wanted to gain enough speed that the inner wings, rather than the fragile outer wings, would lift the plane; in 67 test flights, the plane had never been loaded to capacity.) The aircraft accelerated very slowly and needed approximately 14,200 feet (2.7 mi; 4.3 km) of the runway to gain enough speed to lift from the ground, the wings arching up dramatically just before take-off. The two damaged winglets remained attached to the wings by only a thin layer of carbon fiber and were removed by flying the Voyager in a slip, which introduced side-loading, tearing the winglets off completely. Some of the carbon fiber skin was pulled off in the process, exposing the blue foam core. Burt Rutan following with pilot Mike Melvill determined that Voyager was still within its performance specifications despite the damage and decided to allow the flight to continue. During the flight, the two pilots had to deal with extremely cramped quarters. To reduce stress, the two had originally intended to fly the plane in three-hour shifts, but flight handling characteristics while the plane was heavy prevented routine changeovers, and they became very fatigued. Dick Rutan reportedly stayed at the controls without relief for almost the first three days of the flight. Damaged left wingtip The plane also continuously reminded the pilots of its pitch instability and fragility. They had to maneuver around bad weather numerous times, most perilously around the Typhoon Marge.Joint Typhoon Warning Center (1987). Chapter 3: Northwest Pacific and North Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclones . Retrieved on 2007-12-19. Libya denied access to the country's airspace in response to Operation El Dorado Canyon earlier that year. There were contentious radio conversations between the Rutan brothers as Dick flew around weather and, at one time, turned around and began doubling back. As they neared California to land, a fuel pump failed and had to be replaced with its twin pumping fuel from the other side of the aircraft. In front of 55,000 spectators and a large press contingent, including 23 live feeds breaking into scheduled broadcasting across Europe and North America, the plane safely came back to earth, touching down at 8:06 a.m. at the same airfield 9 days after take-off. Rutan made three low passes over the landing field before putting Voyager down. The average speed for the flight was . There were of fuel remaining in the tanks, only about 1.5% of the fuel they had at take-off. Sanctioned by the FAI and the AOPA, the flight was the first successful aerial nonstop, non-refueled circumnavigation of the Earth that included two passes over the Equator (as opposed to shorter ostensible \\"circumnavigations\\" circling the North or South Pole). This feat has since been accomplished only one other time, by Steve Fossett in the Global Flyer (also designed by Rutan). For the feat, Yeager, the Rutans, and crew chief/builder Bruce Evans received the 1986 Collier Trophy., p. 84.

Block ciphers operate on a fixed length string of bits. The length of this bit string is the block size. Both the input (plaintext) and output (ciphertext) are the same length; the output cannot be shorter than the input this follows logically from the pigeonhole principle and the fact that the cipher must be reversibleand it is undesirable for the output to be longer than the input. Until the announcement of NIST's AES contest, the majority of block ciphers followed the example of the DES in using a block size of 64 bits (8 bytes). However the birthday paradox tells us that after accumulating a number of blocks equal to the square root of the total number possible, there will be an approximately 50% chance of two or more being the same, which would start to leak information about the message contents. Thus even when used with a proper encryption mode (e.g. CBC or OFB), only 232 √ó 8 B = 32 GB of data can be safely sent under one key. In practice a greater margin of security is desired, restricting a single key to the encryption of much less data say a few hundred megabytes. Once that seemed like a fair amount of data, but today it is easily exceeded. If the cipher mode does not properly randomise the input, the limit is even lower. Consequently, AES candidates were required to support a block length of 128 bits (16 bytes). This should be acceptable for up to 264 √ó 16 B = 256 exabytes of data, and should suffice for quite a few years to come. The winner of the AES contest, Rijndael, supports block and key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits, but in AES the block size is always 128 bits. The extra block sizes were not adopted by the AES standard. Many block ciphers, such as RC5, support a variable block size. The Luby-Rackoff construction and the Outerbridge construction can both increase the effective block size of a cipher. Joan Daemen's 3-Way and BaseKing have unusual block sizes of 96 and 192 bits, respectively.

The organisation advocates a strategy of anarcho-syndicalism as a method of abolishing capitalism and the state, and describes itself as a \\"revolutionary union\\".http://www.solfed.org.uk/solfed-industrial-strategy In 1994 it adopted its current name, having previously been the Direct Action Movement since 1979, and before that the Syndicalist Workers' Federation since 1950. Along with the Anarchist Federation it is one of the two anarchist federations active in the UK. History =Syndicalist Workers' Federation= The Syndicalist Workers' Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of the Solidarity Federation's earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain (not to be confused with the current Anarchist Federation which was founded as the Anarchist Communist Federation in 1986). Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset. The group joined the International Workers Association and during the Franco era gave particular support to the Spanish resistance and the underground CNT anarcho-syndicalist union, previously involved in the 1936 Spanish Revolution and subsequent Civil War against a right-wing military coup backed by both Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The SWF initially had some success, but when Tom Brown, a long-term and very active member was forced out of activity, it declined until by 1979 it had one lone branch in Manchester. The SWF then dissolved itself into the group founded as the Direct Action Movement. Its archives are held by the International Institute of Social History, and a selection of the SWFs publication have been digitally published on libcom.org. =Direct Action Movement= The Direct Action Movement was formed in 1979, when the one remaining SWF branch, along with other smaller anarchist groups, decided to form a new organisation of anarcho-syndicalists in Britain.http://www.katesharpleylibrary.net/x69qfd The DAM was highly involved in the Miners' Strike as well as a series of industrial disputes later in the 1980s, including the Ardbride dispute in Ardrossan, Scotland, involving a supplier to Laura Ashley, for which the DAM received international support. From 1988 in Scotland, then England and Wales, the DAM was active in opposing the Poll Tax. In the early 1990s, DAM members set up the Despatch Industry Workers Union, which successfully organised workers for a number of inner-city courier firms.http://libcom.org/library/the-couriers-are-revolting-the- despatch-industry-workers-union-1989-1992 The DAM was also involved in Anti- Fascist Action (AFA), and was committed to physically combatting British fascist and far-right groups. It often had encounters with groups such as the National Front and the British National Party. Anti-fascist activities in places such as Liverpool, Yorkshire, Bristol and Norwich were heavily influenced by local anarchists. Similarly anarchists, in particular the DAM, were the first to question the motives and tactics of the anti-fascist Searchlight magazine. In March 1994, DAM changed its name to the Solidarity Federation.  Structure  =Federalism= The Solidarity Federation organises according to the principles of anarchist federalism. The base unit of the federation is the Local, groups of members based within a specific geographical area. These local groups are autonomous, within the bounds laid out in the Solidarity Federation's constitution. These local groups come together as a confederation to form the national organisation. This most importantly manifests at the national conference, where each local presents a delegate to represent them. These local delegates do not act independently, but instead are guided by the mandate (formal instructions) their fellow members have given them. In this way, the Solidarity Federation is an attempt at a working grassroots democracy. This confederated national conference is the highest decision making body in the Solidarity Federation. Internationally, the Solidarity Federation forms the British section of International Workers Association, an international federation of anarcho- syndicalist unions and groups. With the IWA also following the principles of federalism, the Solidarity Federation plays a role in the IWA similar to that of a local in SolFed, as a group of members organised by geographical region. All SolFed members are automatically members of the IWA. =Workplace organising= Industrial Networks Solidarity Federation members who work in the same employment sector have formed Industrial Networks. Their purpose is to promote solidarity amongst workers and focus on developing and implementing a direct action strategy to fight for better pay and conditions in their industry. Organiser Training (open course) Solidarity Federation are responsible for supplying volunteer staff to run a workplace organiser training course intended to \\"give people the tools and confidence to organise in their workplaces and win grievances\\".http://www.solfed.org.uk/organiser-training This training is open to non-members and focuses on how building a 'shop committee' can form a platform by which to initiate an effective anarcho-syndicalist approach to workplace issues. In addition, training on supporting direct action casework is provided by members involved in the hospitality workers and housing campaigns. Activities =End Unpaid Work= SolFed End Unpaid Work campaign logo for 2012 In early 2012, Solidarity Federation initiated a national campaign against workfare.http://www.solfed.org.uk/campaigns/workfare The organisation describe workfare as a government initiative to implement 'schemes in which people are forced to work without wages in order to receive their benefits'.http://www.solfed.org.uk/unwaged-workers/abolish-workfare-the- solidarity-federations-guide-to-the-governments-unpaid-work Solidarity Federation further claim that workfare is 'part of a long term re-structuring of the labour market towards more temporary, lower paid jobs and with poorer conditions and fewer benefits' by 'placing significant downward pressure on the wages and conditions of those of us who work.' The campaign initially focused specifically on Holland and Barrett, a health supplement corporation making use of placements staffed by unpaid benefits claimants. On 5 July 2012, after a sustained series of pickets at Holland and Barrett stores across the UK, the company announced via social media and its website that it was pulling out of the workfare scheme, citing negative publicity.http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/workfare-goes- underground-holland-and-barrett-pull- outhttp://www.solfed.org.uk/brighton/a-domino-falls-holland-barrett-quit- workfare-after-direct-action This announcement came just days before a national 'week of action against workfare', organised jointly with Boycott Workfare, was due to begin. A Solidarity Federation spokesperson speaking to The Guardian newspaper described the victory as: > ...not just a victory for claimants, [but] a victory for all of us as > workfare undermines pay and conditions > https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/06/holland-and-barrett-jobseekers- > scheme Later targets for pickets included Poundland, with pickets taking place in several cities. = Sussex University Pop Up Union = Members of the Brighton Solidarity Federation local were heavily involved in the organisation of a pop up union at the University of Sussex in 2013. The pop up union was set up in response to plans to outsource 235 workers to private firms, which led to a large protest campaign on the Sussex campus including demonstrations and the occupation of the university conference centre. The pop up union was formed for the purpose of enabling staff to take part in legally recognised strike action, something the existing unions on campus had been unwilling to do despite strong support in indicative ballots. The pop up union required workers to pay a small notional membership fee to join, and quickly grew to be the second largest union on the university campus. It held a ballot on taking strike action in May 2013 which led to a vote to strike. However, this was annulled following legal challenge by the university. An assessment of the pop up union by SolFed members involved in its organisation, The Pop Up Union: a postmortem, was published on the Solidarity Federation website. = Hospitality Workers Campaign = In October 2013 the Brighton local launched a campaign to organise hospitality workers in the city. Spearheaded by Solidarity Federation members working in the sector, the campaign focuses on building solidarity amongst workers across the sector and taking action regarding issues including below minimum wage pay, long shifts without breaks, the lack of written or verbal contracts, unpaid overtime, unlawful deductions from wages and no holiday entitlement. Weekly drop in sessions are held for workers in the sector to bring issues and to discuss potential campaigns of action. A campaign will usually begin with a demand letter being presented to the employer, stating the grievance, what is demanded and the timescale within which these demands should be met otherwise the campaign will be escalated. Tactics for escalation include boycotts, publicity, phone and email blockades and pickets of the workplace. As much as possible the campaign seeks to involve the worker and their colleagues in the campaign and to involve workers from other disputes. The Brighton Solidarity Federation website mentions 21 previous disputes, with ¬£38,830.50 in owed wages and holiday entitlement listed as having been paid. A similar campaign was launched by hospitality workers in the Liverpool local in August 2017. = Brighton Housing Campaign = Since 2015, the Brighton local has been publicly campaigning on issues around rented housing. Similar to the hospitality workers campaign the local holds weekly drop ins to help tenants to organise around issues including agency fees, withheld deposits and poor housing conditions. It has been involved in a number of campaigns targeting landlords and estate agents who provide substandard housing or withhold money owed. One article from November 2017 mentions three successful cases from the proceeding three months. The cases led to ¬£6,510 being paid to tenants as compensation and to repairs being carried out as a result of the campaign. = Bristol Care Workers Network = In June 2017 Bristol local founded the Bristol Care Workers Network. This is a network of health and social care workers seeking to organise for better rights, pay and terms for workers in the sector. Whilst not formally part of the Solidarity Federation it retains close links to the organisation.

The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves. The game was first sold under the Connect Four trademark by Milton Bradley in February 1974. Gameplay Gameplay of Connect Four A gameplay example (right), shows the first player starting Connect Four by dropping one of their yellow discs into the center column of an empty game board. The two players then alternate turns dropping one of their discs at a time into an unfilled column, until the second player, with red discs, achieves a diagonal four in a row, and wins the game. If the board fills up before either player achieves four in a row, then the game is a draw. Mathematical solution Connect Four is a two-player game with perfect information for both sides. This term describes games where one player at a time plays, players have all the information about moves that have taken place and all moves that can take place, for a given game state. Connect Four also belongs to the classification of an adversarial, zero-sum game, since a player's advantage is an opponent's disadvantage. One measure of complexity of the Connect Four game is the number of possible games board positions. For classic Connect Four played on 6 high, 7 wide grid, there are 4,531,985,219,092 positionsNumber of legal 7 X 6 Connect-Four positions after n plies, Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences for all game boards populated with 0 to 42 pieces. The game was first solved by James Dow Allen (October 1, 1988), and independently by Victor Allis (October 16, 1988). Allis describes a knowledge-based approach,Allis, Victor, A Knowledge-based Approach of Connect-Four, Vrije Universiteit, October 1988 with nine strategies, as a solution for Connect Four. Allen also describes winning strategies Allen, James D., Expert Play in Connect-Four, 1990 in his analysis of the game. At the time of the initial solutions for Connect Four, brute-force analysis was not deemed feasible given the game's complexity and the computer technology available at the time. Connect Four has since been solved with brute-force methods, beginning with John Tromp's work in compiling an 8-ply databaseTromp, John, Connect-4 Data Set, February 4, 1995 (February 4, 1995). The artificial intelligence algorithms able to strongly solve Connect Four are minimax or negamax, with optimizations that include alpha- beta pruning, move ordering, and transposition tables. The code for solving Connect Four with these methods is also the basis for the FhourstonesTromp, John, The Fhourstones Benchmark, 1992 integer performance benchmark. The solved conclusion for Connect Four is first player win. With perfect play, the first player can force a win, on or before the 41st moveasun.net, Four in a Row Solver, August 30, 2013 (ply) by starting in the middle column. The game is a theoretical draw when the first player starts in the columns adjacent to the center. For the edges of the game board, column 1 and 2 on left (or column 7 and 6 on right), the exact move-value score for first player start is loss on the 40th move, and loss on the 42nd move, respectively. In other words, by starting with the four outer columns, the first player allows the second player to force a win. Rule variations There are many variations of Connect Four with differing game board sizes, game pieces, and/or gameplay rules. Many variations are popular with game theory and artificial intelligence research, rather than with physical game boards and gameplay by persons. The most commonly used Connect Four board size is 7 columns √ó 6 rows. Size variations include 5√ó4, 6√ó5, 8√ó7, 9√ó7, 10√ó7, 8√ó8, Infinite Connect-Four, and Cylinder-Infinite Connect-Four. A travel version of the Milton Bradley game. Several versions of Hasbro's Connect Four physical gameboard make it easy to remove game pieces from the bottom one at a time. Along with traditional gameplay, this feature allows for variations of the game. Some earlier game versions also included specially marked discs, and cardboard column extenders, for additional variations to the game. =PopOut= PopOut starts the same as traditional gameplay, with an empty board and players alternating turns placing their own colored discs into the board. During each turn, a player can either add another disc from the top or, if one has any discs of his or her own color on the bottom row, remove (or \\"pop out\\") a disc of one's own color from the bottom. Popping a disc out from the bottom drops every disc above it down one space, changing their relationship with the rest of the board and changing the possibilities for a connection. The first player to connect four of their discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. =Pop 10= Before play begins, Pop 10 is set up differently from the traditional game. Taking turns, each player places one of their own color discs into the slots filling up only the bottom row, then moving on to the next row until it is filled, and so forth until all rows have been filled. Gameplay works by players taking turns removing a disc of one's own color through the bottom of the board. If the disc that was removed was part of a four-disc connection at the time of its removal, the player sets it aside out of play and immediately takes another turn. If it was not part of a \\"connect four\\", then it must be placed back on the board through a slot at the top into any open space in an alternate column (whenever possible) and the turn ends, switching to the other player. The first player to set aside ten discs of his or her color wins the game. =5-in-a-Row= The 5-in-a-Row variation for Connect Four is a game played on a 6 high, 9 wide, grid. Hasbro adds two additional board columns, already filled with player pieces in an alternating pattern, to the left and right sides of their standard 6 by 7 game board. The game plays similarly to the original Connect Four, except players must now get five pieces in a row to win. Notice this is still a 42-ply game since the two new columns added to the game represent twelve game pieces already played, before the start of a game. =Power Up= In this variation of Connect Four, players begin a game with one or more specially marked, \\"Power Checkers\\" game pieces, which each player may choose to play once per game. When playing a piece marked with an anvil icon, for example, the player may immediately pop out all pieces below it, leaving the anvil piece at the bottom row of the game board. Other marked game pieces include one with a wall icon, allowing a player to play a second consecutive non winning turn with an unmarked piece; a \\"√ó2\\" icon, allowing for an unrestricted second turn with an unmarked piece; and a bomb icon, allowing a player to immediately pop out an opponent's piece. Other versions Hasbro also produces various sizes of Giant Connect Four, suitable for outdoor use. The largest is built from weather-resistant wood, and measures 120 cm in both width and height. Connect Four was released for the Microvision video game console in 1979, developed by Robert Hoffberg. It was also released for the Texas Instruments 99/4 computer the same year. With the proliferation of mobile devices, Connect Four has regained popularity as a game that can be played quickly and against another person over an Internet connection. In 2007, Milton Bradley published Connect 4 Stackers. Instead of the usual grid, the game features a board to place colored discs on. Just like standard Connect 4, the object of the game is to try get 4 in a row of a specific color of discs. In 2008, another board variation Hasbro published as a physical game is Connect 4x4. This game features a two-layer vertical grid with colored discs for four players, plus blocking discs. The object of the game is also to get 4 in a row for a specific color of discs. A SpongeBob SquarePants version of the game was released in 2009 for the show's 10th anniversary. The rules are the same as the normal version, only the chips have the faces of SpongeBob and Patrick on them. It was re-released in 2014, but with Patrick being replaced with Plankton. In 2013, Bay Tek Games created a Connect 4 ticket redemption arcade game under license from Hasbro. There are Standard and Deluxe versions of the game. Two players move and drop the checkers using buttons. If only one player is playing, the player plays against the computer. Both the player that wins and the player that loses get tickets. The player that wins gets to play a bonus round where a checker is moving and the player needs to press the button at the right time to get the ticket jackpot. In 2015 Winning Moves published Connect 4 Twist & Turn. This game variant features a game tower instead of the flat game grid. The tower has 5 rings that twist independently. Gameplay is similar to standard Connect 4 where players try to get 4 in a row of their own colored discs. However, with Twist & Turn, players have the choice to twist a ring after they have played a piece. It adds a subtle layer of strategy to the gameplay. In 2018, Bay Tek Games released their second Connect 4 arcade game, Connect 4 Hoops. Players throw basketballs into basketball hoops, and they show up as checkers on the video screen. The game can be played by 2 players, or by 1 player against the computer. Both the player that wins and the player that loses get tickets. In 2018, Hasbro released Connect 4 Shots. This version requires the players to bounce coloured balls into the grid until one player achieves four in a row.

Written for the Universal Improvement of Mankind. was the first major work written by Jonathan Swift, arguably his most difficult satire and perhaps his most masterly. The Tale is a prose parody divided into sections each delving into the morals and ethics of the English. Composed between 1694 and 1697, it was eventually published in 1704. A satire on the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches and English Dissenters, it was famously attacked for its profanity and irreligion, starting with William Wotton, who wrote that the Tale had made a game of \\"God and Religion, Truth and Moral Honesty, Learning and Industry\\" to show \\"at the bottom [the author's] contemptible Opinion of every Thing which is called Christianity.\\"Wotton, William. Observations on A Tale of a Tub (1705). The work continued to be regarded as an attack on religion well into the nineteenth century.Clark, John R. \\"The Decorum of Madness\\". Form and Frenzy in Swift's Tale of a Tub. By Clark. New York City:Cornell UP, 1970. Warren Montag The unthinkable Swift p. 113 quoting William Wotton: The Tale was enormously popular, presenting both a satire of religious excess and a parody of contemporary writing in literature, politics, theology, Biblical exegesis, and medicine through its comically excessive front matter and series of digressions throughout. The overarching parody is of enthusiasm, pride, and credulity. At the time it was written, politics and religion were still closely linked in England, and the religious and political aspects of the satire can often hardly be separated. \\"The work made Swift notorious, and was widely misunderstood, especially by Queen Anne herself who mistook its purpose for profanity.\\"Ousby, I. et al. (1993). The Cambridge guide to literature in English. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. It \\"effectively disbarred its author from proper preferment\\" in the Church of England, but is considered one of Swift's best allegories, even by himself. The tale =Overview= A Tale of a Tub comprises the tale itself, an allegory of the Reformation in the story of brothers Peter, Martin, and Jack as they attempt to make their way in the world, along with various digressions interspersed throughout. Each brother represents one of the primary branches of Christianity in the West. This part of the book is a pun on \\"tub\\", which Alexander Pope says was a common term for a Dissenter's pulpit, and a reference to Swift's own position as a clergyman. Peter (named for Saint Peter) stands in for the Roman Catholic Church.Ross, Woolley 1999, p. x Jack (named for John Calvin, but whom Swift also connects to John of Leiden) represents the various dissenting Protestant churches such as Baptists, Presbyterians, Quakers, Congregationalists and Anabaptists. The third brother, middle born and middle standing, is Martin (named for Martin Luther), whom Swift uses to represent the 'via media' of the Church of England. The brothers have inherited three wonderfully satisfactory coats (representing religious practice) by their father (representing God), and they have his will (representing the Bible) to guide them. Although the will says that the brothers are forbidden from making any changes to their coats, they do nearly nothing but alter their coats from the start. In as much as the will represents the Bible and the coat represents the practice of Christianity, the allegory of the narrative is supposed to be an apology for the Anglican church's refusal to alter its practice in accordance with Puritan demands and its continued resistance to ally with the Roman church.For further details on the religious context of A Tale of a Tub, see John Farrell, \\"Swift and the Satiric Absolute\\", Paranoia and Modernity: Cervantes to Rousseau New York: Cornell UP (2006). From its opening (once past the prolegomena, which comprises the first three sections), the book alternates between Digression and Tale. However, the digressions overwhelm the narrative, both in their length and in the forcefulness and imaginativeness of writing. Furthermore, after Chapter X (the commonly anthologised \\"Digression on Madness\\"), the labels for the sections are incorrect. Sections then called \\"Tale\\" are Digressions, and those called \\"Digression\\" are also Digressions.For one description of the structure of A Tale of a Tub, see Irvn Ehrenpreis, Swift: The Man, his Works, and the Age: Mr Swift and his Contemporaries, Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1962): 185‚Äì203. A Tale of a Tub is an enormous parody with a number of smaller parodies within it. Many critics have followed Swift's biographer Irvin Ehrenpreis in arguing that there is no single, consistent narrator in the work.Ehrenpreis, Mr Swift and his Contemporaries, 185‚Äì225. One difficulty with this position, however, is that if there is no single character posing as the author, then it is at least clear that nearly all of the \\"personae\\" employed by Swift for the parodies are so much alike that they function as a single identity. In general, whether a modern reader would view the book as consisting of dozens of impersonations or a single one, Swift writes the Tale through the pose of a Modern or New Man. See the abridged discussion of the \\"Ancients and Moderns\\", below, for more on the nature of the \\"modern man\\" in Swift's day.For a more detailed discussion of how different genres figure into Swift's portrayal of the debate between the Ancients and the Moderns, see Leon Guilhamet, Satire and the Transformation of Genre, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press (1987): 125‚Äì39. Swift's explanation for the title of the book is that the Ship of State was threatened by a whale (specifically, the Leviathan of Thomas Hobbes) and the new political societies (the Rota Club is mentioned). His book is intended to be a tub that the sailors of state (the nobles and ministers) might toss over the side to divert the attention of the beast (those who questioned the government and its right to rule). Hobbes was highly controversial in the Restoration, but Swift's invocation of Hobbes might well be ironic. The narrative of the brothers is a faulty allegory, and Swift's narrator is either a madman or a fool. The book is not one that could occupy the Leviathan, or preserve the Ship of State, so Swift may be intensifying the dangers of Hobbes's critique rather than allaying them to provoke a more rational response.For one reading of Swift's use of Hobbes, see Farrell, \\"Swift and the Satiric Absolute\\". The digressions individually frustrate readers who expect a clear purpose. Each digression has its own topic, and each is an essay on its particular sidelight. In his biography of Swift, Ehrenpreis argued that each digression is an impersonation of a different contemporary author. This is the \\"persona theory,\\" which holds that the Tale is not one parody, but rather a series of parodies, arising out of chamber performance in the Temple household. Prior to Ehrenpreis, some critics had argued that the narrator of the Tale is a character, just as the narrator of a novel would be. Given the evidence of A. C. Elias about the acrimony of Swift's departure from the Temple household, evidence from Swift's Journal to Stella about how uninvolved in the Temple household Swift had been, and the number of repeated observations about himself by the Tale's author, it seems reasonable to propose that the digressions reflect a single type of man, if not a particular character.A commonplace in academic discussion. See Elias, A. C., Swift at Moor Park. U Penn Press, 1982. See also McKeon, Michael. The Origins of the English Novel 1600‚Äì1740. Johns Hopkins UP, 1987. On p. 195, McKeon refers to the knowing paradox of the satire of overreading and literalism thus: \\"The Restoration and the early eighteenth-century reaction against religious 'enthusiasm' [in Tale] represents a counterrevolution, generated by the Calvinist revolution itself, which repudiates what are taken to be its excesses even as it shares with that revolution certain Protestant premises concerning the doctrinaire absolutism of papist methods for distinguishing the vicious from the virtuous, the damned from the saved.\\" In any case, the digressions are each readerly tests; each tests whether or not the reader is intelligent and sceptical enough to detect nonsense. Some, such as the discussion of ears or of wisdom being like a nut, a cream sherry, a cackling hen, etc., are outlandish and require a militantly aware and thoughtful reader. Each is a trick, and together they train the reader to sniff out bunk and to reject the unacceptable. =Cultural setting= During the Restoration the print revolution began to change every aspect of British society. It became possible for anyone to spend a small amount of money and have his or her opinions published as a broadsheet, and to gain access to the latest discoveries in science, literature, and political theory, as books became less expensive and digests and \\"indexes\\" of the sciences grew more numerous. The difficulty lay in discerning truth from falsehood, credible claims from impossible one.For a brief survey of the print revolution in the context of British intellectual history, see Roy Porter, \\"Print culture\\", The Creation of the Modern World: The Untold Story of the British Enlightenment, New York: W. W. Norton and Co. (2000) and for a brief survey of the print revolution in the context of British artistic and literary history, see John Brewer \\"Authors, Publishers and the Making of Literary Culture\\" and \\"Readers and the Reading Public\\" in The Pleasures of the Imagination: English Culture in the Eighteenth Century, Chicago: University of Chicago Press (1997). Swift writes A Tale of a Tub in the guise of a narrator who is excited and gullible about what the new world has to offer, and feels that he is quite the equal or superior of any author who ever lived because he, unlike them, possesses 'technology' and newer opinions. Swift seemingly asks the question of what a person with no discernment but with a thirst for knowledge would be like, and the answer is the narrator of Tale of a Tub. Swift was annoyed by people so eager to possess the newest knowledge that they failed to pose sceptical questions. If he was not a particular fan of the aristocracy, he was a sincere opponent of democracy, which was often viewed then as the sort of \\"mob rule\\" that led to the worst abuses of the English Interregnum. Swift's satire was intended to provide a genuine service by painting the portrait of conspiracy minded and injudicious writers. At that time in England, politics, religion and education were unified in a way that they are not now. The monarch was the head of the state church. Each school (secondary and university) had a political tradition. Officially, there was no such thing as \\"Whig and Tory\\" at the time, but the labels are useful and were certainly employed by writers themselves. The two major parties were associated with religious and economic groups. The implications of this unification of politics, class, and religion are important. Although it is somewhat extreme and simplistic to put it this way, failing to be for the Church was failing to be for the monarch; having an interest in physics and trade was to be associated with dissenting religion and the Whig Party. When Swift attacks the lovers of all things modern, he is thereby attacking the new world of trade, of dissenting religious believers, and, to some degree, an emergent portion of the Whig Party.For a detailed look at the relationship between politics and religion during this period, see J. C. D. Clark's English Society 1660‚Äì1832: Religion, ideology and politics during the ancient regime, 2nd ed., Cambridge: Cambridge University Press (2000), particularly \\"From Restoration to Reconciliation, 1660‚Äì1760\\". On google books =Authorial background= Born of English parents in Ireland, Jonathan Swift was working as Sir William Temple's secretary at the time he composed A Tale of a Tub (1694‚Äì1697).For a broad introduction to Swift's life and the role of A Tale of a Tub in it, see Claude Rawson, \\"Biographical Introduction\\", The Character of Swift's Satire: A Revised Focus. Ed. Claude Rawson. Newark: University of Delaware Press (1983): 15‚Äì17; for a detailed explanation of the possible dates of composition, see Guthkelch and Smith, xliii‚Äìxlvii. The publication of the work coincided with Swift's striking out on his own, having despaired of getting a good \\"living\\" from Temple or Temple's influence. There is speculation about what caused the rift between Swift and his employer, but, as A. C. Elias persuasively argues, it seems that the final straw came with Swift's work on Temple's Letters. Swift had been engaged to translate Temple's French correspondence, but Temple, or someone close to Temple, edited the French text to make Temple seem both prescient and more fluent. Consequently, the letters and the translations Swift provided did not gibe, and, since Swift could not accuse Temple of falsifying his letters, and because the public would never believe that the retired state minister had lied, Swift came across as incompetent. Jonathan Swift Even though Swift published the \\"Tale\\" as he left Temple's service, it was conceived earlier, and the book is a salvo in one of Temple's battles. Swift's general polemic concerns an argument (the \\"Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns\\") that had been over for nearly ten years by the time the book was published. The \\"Quarrel of the Ancients and Moderns\\" was a French academic debate of the early 1690s, occasioned by Fontenelle arguing that modern scholarship had allowed modern man to surpass the ancients in knowledge. Temple argued against this position in his \\"On Ancient and Modern Learning\\" (where he provided the first English formulation of the commonplace that modern critics see more only because they are dwarves standing on the shoulders of giants), and Temple's somewhat naive essay prompted a small flurry of responses. Among others, two men who took the side opposing Temple were Richard Bentley (classicist and editor) and William Wotton (critic). The entire discussion in England was over by 1696, and yet it seems to have fired Swift's imagination. Swift saw in the opposing camps of Ancients and Moderns a shorthand of two general ways of looking at the world (see the historical background, below, for some of the senses in which \\"new men\\" and \\"ancients\\" might be understood). The Tale of a Tub attacks all who praise modernity over classical learning. Temple had done as much, but Swift, unlike Temple, has no praise for the classical world, either. There is no normative value in Rome, no lost English glen, no hearth ember to be invoked against the hubris of modern scientism. Some critics have seen in Swift's reluctance to praise mankind in any age proof of his misanthropy, and others have detected in it an overarching hatred of pride.Ehrenpreis writes \\"[i]t is correct to read every part of the Tale as an adaptation of one attitude: that wilful rejection of the Established Church, limited monarchy, classical literary standards, and rational judgment is an act of pride, and leads to corruptions in government, religion, and learning.\\" (Swift and his Contemporaries, 202) At the same time, the Tale revived the Quarrel of Ancients and Moderns at least enough to prompt Wotton to come out with a new edition of his pamphlet attacking Temple, and he appended to it an essay against the author of A Tale of a Tub. Swift was able to cut pieces from Wotton's \\"Answer\\" to include in the fifth edition of the Tale as \\"Notes\\" at the bottom of the page. Swift's satire also gave something of a framework for other satirists in the Scriblerian circle, and Modern vs. Ancient is picked up as one distinction between political and cultural forces.For more information on the complex relationship between Swift, Temple, and Swift's satirical style, see John Traugott, \\"A Tale of a Tub\\", The Character of Swift's Satire: A Revised Focus, Ed. Claude Rawson, Newark: University of Delaware Press (1983), 90‚Äì100; A. C. Elias, Jr. Swift at Moor Park: Problems in Biography and Criticism. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press (1982): 155‚Äì59, 173‚Äì86. If Swift hoped that the Tale of a Tub would win him a living, he would have been disappointed. Swift himself believed that the book cost him any chance of high position within the church. It is most likely, though, that Swift was not seeking a clerical position with the Tale. Instead, it was probably meant to establish him as a literary and political figure and to strike out a set of positions that would win the notice of influential men. This it did. As a consequence of this work, and his activity in Church causes, Swift became a familiar of Robert Harley, future Earl of Oxford, and Henry St. John, the future Viscount Bolingbroke. When the Tories gained the government in 1710, Swift was rewarded for his work. By 1713‚Äì14, however, the Tory government had fallen, and Swift was made Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin‚Äîan appointment he considered an exile. =Nature of the satire= Title page of the fifth edition, 1710, with the added Notes and Apology for the &c.; Upon publication the public realised both that there was an allegory in the story of the brothers and that there were particular political references in the Digressions. A number of \\"Keys\\" appeared soon thereafter, analogous to contemporary services like CliffsNotes or Spark Notes. \\"Keys\\" offered the reader a commentary on the Tale and explanations of its references. Edmund Curll rushed out a Key to the work, and William Wotton offered up an \\"Answer\\" to the author of the work. Swift's targets included indexers, note-makers, and, above all, people who saw \\"dark matter\\" in books. Attacking criticism generally, he appears delighted that one of his enemies, William Wotton, offered to explain the Tale in an \\"answer\\" to the book and that one of the men he had explicitly attacked, Curll, offered to explain the book to the public. In the fifth edition of the book in 1710, Swift provided an apparatus to the work that incorporated Wotton's explanations and Swift's narrator's notes. The notes appear to occasionally provide genuine information and just as often to mislead, and William Wotton's name, a defender of the Moderns, was appended to a number of notes. This allows Swift to make the commentary part of the satire itself, as well as to elevate his narrator to the level of self-critic. The Tale's satire is most consistent in attacking misreading of all sorts. Both in the narrative sections and the digressions, the single human flaw that underlies all the follies Swift attacks is over-figurative and over-literal reading, both of the Bible and of poetry and political prose. The narrator is seeking hidden knowledge, mechanical operations of things spiritual, spiritual qualities to things physical, and alternate readings of everything. Within the \\"tale\\" sections of the book, Peter, Martin, and Jack fall into bad company (becoming the official religion of the Roman empire) and begin altering their coats (faith) by adding ornaments. They then begin relying on Peter to be the arbitrator of the will. He begins to rule by authority (he remembered the handyman saying that he once heard the father say that it was acceptable to don more ornaments), until such a time that Jack rebels against the rule of Peter. Jack begins to read the will (the Bible) overly literally. He rips the coat to shreds to restore the original state of the garment which represents the \\"primitive Christianity\\" sought by dissenters. He begins to rely only upon \\"inner illumination\\" for guidance and thus walks around with his eyes closed, after swallowing candle snuffs. Eventually, Peter and Jack begin to resemble one another, and only Martin is left with a coat that is at all like the original. An important factor in the reception of Swift's work is that the narrator of the work is an extremist in every direction. Consequently, he can no more construct a sound allegory than he can finish his digressions without losing control (eventually confessing that he is insane).For one reading of the \\"Digression on Madness\\", see Ehrenpreis, Swift and his Contemporaries, 216‚Äì25. For a Church of England reader, the allegory of the brothers provides small comfort. Martin has a corrupted faith, one full of holes and still with ornaments on it. His only virtue is that he avoids the excesses of his brothers, but the original faith is lost to him. Readers of the Tale have picked up on this unsatisfactory resolution to both \\"parts\\" of the book, and A Tale of a Tub has often been offered up as evidence of Swift's misanthropy.For one explanation of how the parody works in this way, see, Traugott, \\"A Tale of a Tub\\", particularly 109‚Äì18. As has recently been argued by Michael McKeon, Swift might best be described as a severe sceptic, rather than a Whig, Tory, empiricist, or religious writer. He supported the Classics in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns, and he supported the established church and the aristocracy, because he felt the alternatives were worse. He argued elsewhere that there is nothing inherently virtuous about a noble birth, but its advantages of wealth and education made the aristocrat a better ruler than the equally virtuous but unprivileged commoner. A Tale of a Tub is a perfect example of Swift's devastating intellect at work. By its end, little seems worth believing in. Formally, the satire in the Tale is historically novel for several reasons. First, Swift more or less invented prose parody. In the \\"Apology for the &c.;\\" (added in 1710), Swift explains that his work is, in several places, a \\"parody,\\" which is where he imitates the style of persons he wishes to expose. What is interesting is that the word \\"parody\\" had not been used for prose before, and the definition he offers is arguably a parody of John Dryden defining \\"parody\\" in the Discourse of Satire (the Preface to Dryden's translations of Juvenal's and Persius' satires). Prior to Swift, parodies were imitations designed to bring mirth, but not primarily in the form of mockery. Dryden imitated the Aeneid in \\"MacFlecknoe\\" to describe the apotheosis of a dull poet, but the imitation made fun of the poet, not Virgil. Swift's satire offers no resolutions. While he ridicules any number of foolish habits, he never offers the reader a positive set of values to embrace. While this type of satire became more common as people imitated Swift, later, Swift is quite unusual in offering the readers no way out. He does not persuade to any position, but he does persuade readers from an assortment of positions. This is one of the qualities that has made the Tale Swift's least-read major work. =Historical background= In the historical background to the period of 1696‚Äì1705, the most important political events might be the Restoration of Charles II in 1660, the Test Act, and the English Settlement or Glorious Revolution of 1688‚Äì1689. Politically, the English had suffered a Civil War that had culminated with the beheading of the king, years of the Interregnum under the Puritan, Oliver Cromwell, and then Parliament inviting the king back to rule in 1660. Upon Charles II's death, his brother, James II of England took the throne. However, when James, a Roman Catholic, married a Roman Catholic as his second wife, the English parliament invited William of Orange to rule in his stead, forcing James to flee the country under military threat. Parliament decided on the way in which all future English monarchs would be chosen. This method would always favour Protestantism over blood line.For a short history of the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, see Mark Kishlansky, A Monarchy Transformed: Britain 1603‚Äì1714, New York: Penguin (1996). Woodcut from the Tale demonstrating the three stages of human endeavour: the gallows, the theatre, and the pulpit For politically aware Englishmen, Parliament had essentially elected a king. Although officially he was supreme, there could be no doubt that the Commons had picked the king and could pick another instead. Although there was now a law demanding that all swear allegiance to the monarch as head of the church, it became less and less clear why the nation was to be so intolerant. Religious conflict at the time was primarily between the Church of England and the dissenting churches. The threat posed by the dissenters was keenly felt by Establishment clerics like Jonathan Swift. It was common enough for Puritans and other dissenters to disrupt church services, to accuse political leaders of being the anti-Christ, and to move the people toward violent schism, riots, and peculiar behaviour including attempts to set up miniature theocracies. Protestant dissenters had led the English Civil War. The pressure of dissenters was felt on all levels of British politics and could be seen in the change of the British economy. The Industrial Revolution was beginning in the period between the writing and publication of A Tale of a Tub, though no one at the time would have known this. What Englishmen did know, however, was that what they called \\"trade\\" was on the rise. Merchants, importers/exporters, and \\"stock jobbers\\" were growing very wealthy. It was becoming more common to find members of the aristocracy with less money than members of the trading class. Those on the rise in the middle class professions were perceived as being more likely to be dissenters than members of the other classes were, and such institutions as the stock exchange and Lloyd's of London were founded by Puritan traders. Members of these classes were also widely ridiculed as attempting to pretend to learning and manners that they had no right to. Further, these \\"new men\\" were not, by and large, the product of the universities nor the traditional secondary schools. Consequently, these now wealthy individuals were not conversant in Latin, were not enamored of the classics, and were not inclined to put much value on these things. Between 1688 and 1705, England was politically unstable. The accession of Queen Anne led to a feeling of vulnerability among Establishment figures. Anne was rumoured to be immoderately stupid and was supposedly governed by her friend, Sarah Churchill, wife of the Duke of Marlborough. Although Swift was a Whig for much of this period, he was allied most nearly with the Ancients camp (which is to say Establishment, Church of England, aristocracy, traditional education), and he was politically active in the service of the Church. He claims, both in \\"The Apology for the &c.;\\" and in a reference in Book I of Gulliver's Travels, to have written the Tale to defend the crown from the troubles of the monsters besetting it. These monsters were numerous. At this time, political clubs and societies were proliferating. The print revolution had meant that people were gathering under dozens of banners, and political and religious sentiments previously unspoken were now rallying supporters. As the general dissenting position became the monied position, and as Parliament increasingly held power, historically novel degrees of freedom had brought an historically tenuous equipoise of change and stability. Publication history The Tale was originally published in 1704 by John Nutt. Swift had used Benjamin Tooke previously when publishing for Sir William Temple. He would use Tooke for both the fifth edition of the Tale (1710) and later works. Tooke's successor, Benjamin Motte, published Swift's Gulliver's Travels. This difference in printer is only one of the things that led to debate over authorship of the work. The first, second, and third editions of the Tale appeared in 1704; the fifth edition came out in 1710. In \\"The Apology for the &c.;\\", Swift indicates that he originally gave his publisher a preliminary copy of the work, while he kept a blotted copy at his own hand and lent other copies including one to Thomas Swift, Jonathan's \\"parson cousin\\". As a consequence, the first edition appeared with many errors. The second edition was a resetting of the type. The third edition was a reprint of the second, with corrections, and the fourth edition contained corrections of the third. The first substantially new edition of the work is the fifth edition of 1710. This is largely the text modern editors will use. It was in this edition that the Notes and the \\"Apology for the &c.;\\" (\\"&c.;\\" was Swift's shorthand for Tale of a Tub: Nutt was supposed to expand the abbreviation out to the book's title but did not do so; the mistake was left) were added, which many contemporary readers and authors found a heating up of an already savage satire.For a detailed publication history, see A. C. Guthkelch and D. Nichol Smith, \\"Introduction\\", A Tale of a Tub. 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press (1958), xi‚Äìxiv, xix‚Äìxxviii. Authorship debate Although today very little of this debate remains, questions of the authorship of the Tale occupied many notable critics both in the 18th and 19th centuries. Famously, Samuel Johnson claimed that A Tale of a Tub was a work of true genius (in contrast to Gulliver's Travels where once one imagines \\"big people and little people\\" the rest is easy) and too good to be Jonathan Swift's. In the 19th century, many critics who saw misanthropy and madness in Jonathan Swift's later work wished to reject the Tale as his. In a way, a critic's view on who wrote the Tale reflected that critic's politics. Swift was such a powerful champion of Tory, or anti-Whig, causes that fans of the Tale were eager to attribute the book to another author from nearly the day of its publication. The work appeared anonymously in 1704. It was Swift's habit to publish anonymously throughout his career, partially as a way of protecting his career, and partially his person.Swift's publisher for the \\"Drapier Letters\\" was thrown in jail, and other authors had found themselves beaten by thugs hired by their satirical targets. As a struggling churchman, Swift needed the support of nobles to gain a living. Additionally, nobles were still responsible for Church affairs in the House of Lords, so his political effectiveness in church affairs depended upon the lords. Swift needed to be at some distance from the sometimes bawdy and scatological work that he wrote. The Tale was immediately popular and controversial. Consequently, there were rumours of various people as the author of the work‚ÄîJonathan Swift then being not largely known except for his work in the House of Lords for the passage of the First Fruits and Fifths bill for tithing. Some people thought that William Temple wrote it. Francis Atterbury said people at Oxford thought it had been written by Edmund Smith and John Philips, though he thought it was by Jonathan Swift. Some people thought it belonged to Lord Somers. However, Jonathan Swift had a cousin, also in the church, named Thomas Swift. Thomas and Jonathan were in correspondence during the time of the composition of the Tale, and Thomas Swift later claimed to have written the work. Jonathan responded by saying that Thomas had no hand in anything but the smallest of passages, and he would welcome hearing Thomas 'explain' the work, if he had written it. The controversy over authorship is aggravated by the choice of publisher. Not only did Swift use Tooke after the publication of the Tale, he had used Tooke before its publication as well, so the appearance of the work in John Nutt's shop was atypical. Stylistically and in sentiment, the Tale is undeniably Swift's. Most important in this regard is the narrative pose and the creation of narrative parody.Previously, parody had referred only to poetic compositions. The dramatic pretense of writing as a character is in keeping with Jonathan Swift's lifelong practice. Furthermore, Thomas Swift has left few literary remains. Thomas Swift's authorship is examined in the summary of A. C. Guthkelch and D. Nichol Smith's A Tale of a Tub (1920 and 1958), where they say, \\"all the evidence for Thomas Swift's participation in the Tale... [is] nothing but rumour and [Edmund] Curll's Key.\\"Guthkelch and Smith, xviii. Indeed, in 1710 Swift had the fifth edition republished by Tooke, and he explained in a letter how the rumour had been started. He said that, when the publication initially took place, Swift was abroad in Ireland and \\"that little Parson-cousin of mine\\" \\"affected to talk suspiciously, as if he had some share in it.\\"Qtd. in Guthkelch and Smith, xviii. In other words, anonymity conspired with Thomas Swift's desire for fame to create the confusion. Afterward, only critical preference seems to account for anyone holding Thomas Swift the author. Robert Hendrickson notes in his book British Literary Anecdotes that \\"Swift was always partial to his strikingly original The Tale of a Tub (1704). On reading the work again in later years, he exclaimed 'Good God! What a genius I had when I wrote that book!'\\"Swift's statement is also quoted in Guthkelch and Smith, xix.

As the group's lead guitarist and secondary vocalist, Coxon is featured on all eight of Blur's studio albums (although 2003's Think Tank only features his playing on one track, due to his temporary departure from the band during recording sessions for the album). He has also led a solo career since 1998. As well as being a musician, Coxon is a visual artist: he designed the cover art for all his solo albums as well as Blur's 13 (1999). Coxon plays several instruments and records his albums with little assistance from session musicians. Q magazine critic Adrian Deevoy has written: \\"Coxon is an astonishing musician.

Early life Coxon was born in Rinteln, West Germany where his father, Bob Coxon, was stationed as a clarinet player and band leader in the British Army. As a child, he moved first to Spondon, in Derby, a period during which he became a fan of Derby County. He then moved to Colchester, Essex, in South East England, where he grew up and met fellow Blur member Damon Albarn at The Stanway School, then known as Stanway Comprehensive, at the age of 11. He appeared on the popular BBC children's show Blue Peter twice. Music career =Blur = Coxon studied Fine Arts at Goldsmiths College, London, for two years, where early on he met bassist Alex James. In his time there he mixed with upcoming talents such as Damien Hirst, Michael Landy, Sam Taylor-Wood, and Abigail Lane, some of the future leading lights of the Britart movement. He quit college due to the increasing success of his band at the time, Seymour, which later changed its name to Blur because the recording company, Food Records, thought Seymour was too 'student-ish'. They presented a list to the band of preferred names which included \\"The Shining Path\\" and \\"Blur\\". As well as providing all guitars, backing vocals, and occasional drums, Coxon's lo-fi and alternative musical style and tastes influenced the band's less commercial music in the late 1990s. He sang lead vocals on songs including \\"Red Necks\\", \\"You're So Great\\" from the album Blur, and \\"Coffee & TV\\", as well as a section of the chorus of \\"Tender\\", the bridge of \\"Lonesome Street\\" and a section of \\"Thought I Was a Spaceman\\" on The Magic Whip. During the 1995 period of the media-dubbed 'Battle of Britpop', Coxon became increasingly weary and suspicious of the music industry. His behaviour was occasionally awkward, such as refusing to appear in the video for Blur song \\"Country House\\" unless he could dress as a milkman and take no part in any action with which he felt uncomfortable. In November 2001 Coxon was admitted to the Priory Hospital for 28 days to be treated for alcoholism. During this time, Blur began the recording sessions that would produce the material for their next album, Think Tank. In February 2002, Coxon rejoined the band in the studio for the rest of the recording of Think Tank but after five days was asked by then manager Chris Morrison not to go back into the studio as the other members of the band had reported that the session was not going too well with him present. Coxon took this as a sign and left the band. As he stated in an interview in 2006, \\"I had a breakthrough, I think my life just became calmer, I gave up drinking. My priorities changed as I had a young daughter. The group didn't want me to record for the Think Tank album, so I took it as a sign to leave\\". His last contribution to Blur was a song called \\"Battery in Your Leg\\", the closing song on Blur's 2003 album Think Tank, before leaving the line-up. Damon Albarn later revealed that the song \\"Sweet Song\\" was written after he had been looking at a photograph of Coxon. After Damon Albarn's revealing that he and Coxon had rebuilt their relationship, on 9 December 2008, Blur announced that the whole band would reunite for a show at Hyde Park on 3 July 2009. More dates were announced and the band played festival dates at Glastonbury, T in the Park and Oxegen 2009 as well as headlining shows in Manchester, Newcastle, Wolverhampton, Goldsmiths College and the East Anglian Railway Museum in Colchester. Blur also played one show in Lyon, France. On 17 April 2010, the band released their first single since 2003, \\"Fool's Day\\", for the Record Store Day event as a 7\\" limited to 1000 copies. The band released the single as a free download on their official website the next day. More recently Blur announced via the NME website that they would reunite every so often and record more singles, preferably on 7 inch. However, Damon also stated that an album was not on its way as they were all too busy with their own individual projects. On 19 February 2015, Coxon and the band announced on social media that they would be releasing their eighth studio album on 27 April, titled The Magic Whip, Blur's first album in 12 years and first in 16 years in their original lineup.\\"Blur - Finally, we can confirm that we will be releasing an album,...\\". Facebook. 19 February 2015. Retrieved on 19 February 2015. =Solo work = Coxon had already released three solo albums while a member of Blur before his 2002 departure. His first, released on his own Transcopic label was The Sky Is Too High in 1998, a ramshackle mixture of English folk music and 1960s-style garage rock, influenced by Billy Childish. This was followed by the more extreme The Golden D in 2000 and the thoughtful Dylan-Drakesque Crow Sit on Blood Tree (2001). After going solo full-time, he released The Kiss of Morning in 2002. The album proved to be his most accessible to date and was promoted with the single \\"Escape Song\\" which proved to be an interesting hybrid of Syd Barrett's \\"Octopus\\" and progressive rock trail-blazers The Nice. In 2004, Coxon released his fifth solo album Happiness in Magazines, produced by ex-Blur and The Smiths producer Stephen Street. This proved to be his most successful album to date, and he received the NME Award for Best Solo Artist in 2005. In March 2006 he released his sixth solo album, called Love Travels at Illegal Speeds, again produced by Stephen Street. It marked Coxon's first album away from his now-defunct indie label 'Transcopic'. The LP was preceded by the singles \\"Standing on My Own Again\\" on 27 February and \\"You & I\\". Coxon embarked on a tour of the UK, starting at Newcastle University. He was also involved in a single supporting the England national football team at the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The song was a re-working of the Sham 69 hit \\"Hurry Up Harry\\", and was released as \\"Sham 69 and The Special Assembly\\" (as well as Coxon and Sham 69, Virgin Radio DJ Christian O'Connell, who had run a competition on his show to find a band to record a song in support of the team, was involved in the recording of the song). \\"Hurry Up England\\" entered the UK Singles Chart at No. 10. In October 2006, Coxon released a double live album Burnt to Bitz: At the Astoria immediately after his sold-out London Astoria show. The album features 27 songs, with at least one song from each of his albums. In July 2007 Coxon released a single with Paul Weller, called \\"This Old Town\\". The single peaked at No. 39 in the UK Singles Chart. Coxon's seventh 15-track studio album titled The Spinning Top, produced again by Stephen Street, was released on 11 May 2009. Coxon stated that the LP, which is primarily acoustic, followed a narrative ‚Äì the story of a man from birth to death. \\"The album is mainly an acoustic journey although there is, of course, some explosive electric guitar action,\\" he explained. \\"There are some guests too! Robyn Hitchcock supplies some counter-attack guitar, Jas Singh plays dilruba and jori with his friends Gurjit Sembhi on taus and Jaskase Singh on esraj. Danny Thompson plays the legendary Victoria, Graham Fox gives plenty of swing on the drums and sizzle cymbals and Louis Vause tinkles the ivories.\\" Pre-release response had been positive, with Monday Field of Frank Booth Review dubbing the album \\"a staggering artistic achievement, and Coxon's best solo release to date.\\" His eighth solo album A+E was released in April 2012. Coxon wrote and recorded the score for the 2017 Channel 4 / Netflix television series The End of the F***ing World; it was his first original score. The soundtrack was released in January 2018. In September of the same year, Coxon embarked on a solo tour in North America that featured some of the songs from his score. =Transcopic and other contributions= Coxon's independent label, Transcopic, was co- managed with his friend, and then business partner, Jamie Davis. Davis now runs Independent label Ark Recordings. Coxon illustrated and designed all of his own album art, and collaborated with his friend Nick Craske creating abstract digital work for the release of The Spinning Top; they also filmed two music videos, \\"Sorrow's Army\\" and \\"'In The Morning\\". Coxon also continued painting a series of personal work, most of which remained unseen until 2004, when he exhibited at the ICA in London. Coxon has also been involved in remixing other peoples tracks, including Idlewild and Lowgold both of which were released as b-sides and the latter remix was later re-released on the bands anthology release Keep Music Miserable. In September 2006, Coxon revealed a musical soundscape, \\"english shoes squeek\\", created especially for \\"Verheaven\\" an exhibition at London's Riflemaker Gallery of the work of artist Julie Verhoeven. Coxon appeared on John McCusker's Under One Sky, providing the song \\"All Has Gone\\". In 2009, Coxon was involved in the creation of the Pete Doherty solo album Grace/Wastelands. Doherty had entered a period of sobriety, during which he holed up with Coxon to work on his debut solo album, Grace/Wasteland, (released 24 March 2009) a diverse collection of 12 songs that bounce between reggae and Doherty's standard post-punk. Coxon played on all but one track on the album. Coxon at the 2005 Leeds Festival Coxon has also produced albums by Mower and Assembly Line People Programme from his Transcopic label. In 2013, Graham Coxon was involved in a musical project where artists re-recorded the classic Beatles album Please Please Me.BlurBalls \\"Graham Coxon covers Beatles Song 2013\\", BlurBalls, London, 13 February 2013.

The Blur guitarist recorded the song \\"Baby It's You\\" live as part of a 10-hour recording session hosted by BBC Radio 2 to mark the 50th anniversary of a challenge set by recording company EMI to The Beatles to record a whole studio album in one session. Instruments and equipment Coxon has primarily used Fender Telecasters throughout his career, particularly a '52 reissue and a customised 1968 model with a Gibson PAF humbucker in the neck position, the latter was reissued by Fender as the Graham Coxon signature model although with some minor changes. Since the Blur reunion in 2009 he almost exclusively used a vintage Telecaster Deluxe. During the Leisure era Coxon also used Gibson Les Pauls and a Fender Jaguar, whilst on some later songs, such as No Distance Left to Run and This Is a Low, Coxon uses a Gibson ES-335. He has occasionally used a heavily modified Fender Musicmaster which can be seen in the Coffee & TV and Beetlebum videos. Coxon plays all the instruments featured in his solo work, and has used a variety of guitars, notably Gibson SGs, and a Burns London Sonic. He has been recently seen playing a Telecaster Custom. Graham recently received a custom made guitar from Gray Guitars - it is a Telecaster-type instrument and features a semi-acoustic body and P90 style pickups. Coxon's playing makes significant use of effects pedals such as distortion, delay (a significant example being \\"Essex Dogs\\") and flange (as heard in the pre-chorus of Girls & Boys). He uses a custom made Mike Hill pedalboard which over the years has included: Akai Headrush E2, Boss BF-2 Flanger, Boss CS-3 Compressor/Sustainer, Boss DD-3 Digital Delay, Boss DM-2 Analogue Delay, Boss OD-3, Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor, Boss PN-2 Tremolo/Pan, Boss RV-5 Digital Reverb, Boss TR-2 Tremolo, Boss TU-2 Tuner, Boss VB-2 Vibrato, DOD Punkifier, Electro-Harmonix HOG, Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail, Line 6 FM4 Filter Modeller, ProCo RAT, Shin- Ei FY-2 Companion Fuzz, T-Rex Mudhoney Distortion. For amplification, he uses two Marshall 1959 SLP heads going in to individual 1968 4x12 cabinets. A detailed gear diagram of Graham Coxon's 1993 Blur guitar rig is well- documented. Other artistic endeavours Coxon is a visual artist and designs all his album sleeves. He has also designed album sleeves for other artists. In July 2006, he wrote and had published a foreword for a new edition of Herman Hesse's Narcissus and Goldmund novel. His work also featured on the cover of English folk singer Kate Rusby's album The Girl Who Couldn't Fly. Personal life Graham divides his time between London and Los Angeles and is married to long term partner, vocalist, poet and multimedia artist, Essy Syed. They have two daughters between them, Pepper B√§k Troy Coxon, and their youngest, Dorelia Talys Bee Coxon.

History Kronecker originally introduced the term arithmetization of analysis, by which he meant its constructivization in the context of the natural numbers (see quotation at bottom of page). The meaning of the term later shifted to signify the set-theoretic construction of the real line. Its main proponent was Weierstrass, who argued the geometric foundations of calculus were not solid enough for rigorous work. Research program The highlights of this research program are: * the various (but equivalent) constructions of the real numbers by Dedekind and Cantor resulting in the modern axiomatic definition of the real number field; * the epsilon-delta definition of limit; and * the na√Øve set-theoretic definition of function. Legacy An important spinoff of the arithmetization of analysis is set theory. Naive set theory was created by Cantor and others after arithmetization was completed as a way to study the singularities of functions appearing in calculus. The arithmetization of analysis had several important consequences: * the widely held belief in the banishment of infinitesimals from mathematics until the creation of non- standard analysis by Abraham Robinson in the 1960s, whereas in reality the work on non-Archimedean systems continued unabated, as documented by P. Ehrlich; * the shift of the emphasis from geometric to algebraic reasoning: this has had important consequences in the way mathematics is taught today; * it made possible the development of modern measure theory by Lebesgue and the rudiments of functional analysis by Hilbert; * it motivated the currently prevalent philosophical position that all of mathematics should be derivable from logic and set theory, ultimately leading to Hilbert's program, G√∂del's theorems and non-standard analysis.

Location and intent The Finnish plan was to encircle the Soviet division by two pincer-attacks over the frozen lakes Hirvasj√§rvi and Tolvaj√§rvi. The northern attack over Hirvasj√§rvi was to begin at 08:00 and the second would start when the first had brought results. This was later changed and both attacks were to begin at 08:00. The Soviet main effort was to make a front assault with two regiments 609th and 364th over the Tolvaj√§rvi lake onto the Finnish positions of the 16th regiment near Tolvaj√§rvi village, while the Soviet 718th regiment was to make a flanking maneuver from the north to the Finnish rear across thick wooded areas. There was a thick fog over a single narrow unimproved rural muddy road towards Tolvaj√§rvi that was winding amongst some dozens of small lakes. Just before the battle a big snow storm brought some of snow. Due to thick fog, aviation did not take part in the battle. Due to mud, many tanks got stuck and also did not actively participate in the battle and were lost during withdrawal. Composition * Finnish side (4,000): ** Talvela Group of the 4th Corps (16th Infantry Regiment) ** Rjasjanen detachment (4 separate battalions and one artillery battalion of the 6th Artillery Regiment) Finnish side consisted of 7 infantry battalions and 30 pieces of artillery. The Finnish 16th Infantry Regiment was composed out of workers of Tampere city and headed by the chief of police of Tampere. * Soviet side (20,000): ** 139th Rifle Division of the 8th Army (718th, 609th, 364th Rifle regiments) Soviet side consisted of 9 infantry battalions, 60 pieces of artillery, one scout battalion, one signal battalion, one sapper battalion, 30 tanks, and 376 planes. Battle The northern group consisting of two battalions soon met Soviet resistance. In fact, they met the Soviet 718th Rifle Regiment of the 139th Rifle Division, which was preparing to make its own attack on the Finnish flank. By noon, the Finnish troops withdrew to their own lines. Although this attack did not fulfill its objectives, it prevented the 718th from attacking the Finnish flank, and also from sending reinforcements to the south. Destroyed Soviet armoured car is inspected by Finnish officers. SA-kuvat While the second battalion of the Finnish 16th (infantry) Regiment (II/JR 16) was preparing to attack along the road, it was interrupted by an attack from the Soviet 609th Regiment. The Finns were still able to attack after they got some artillery support. The Finnish attack continued towards a hotel located on a thin isthmus between the two lakes. Pajari decided to commit his reserves in a pincer attack at the Soviet troops around the hotel. In the end, the hotel was captured and in it were found a dead Soviet regimental commander and all the regiment's papers. The Finns withdrew over the lakes for the night. In the morning, Colonel Talvela demanded a new attack and the Soviet 139th Rifle Division was pushed back and later (20‚Äì22 December) destroyed around √Ñgl√§j√§rvi (now Yaglyayarvi in Russia) (some east from Tolvaj√§rvi). Contact was also made with the Soviet 75th Rifle Division, which had been sent as reinforcements. Aftermath Finnish losses were over 100 dead and 250 wounded. The Soviet losses are thought to be over 5000 dead and a lot of equipment: the guns of two artillery batteries, AT- guns, some twenty tanks (amongst others T-26s) and 60 machine guns. The battle was an important offensive victory for the Finns and was very important for the morale of the whole Finnish Army. No major battles were fought in this region after the successful Finnish counter-attack. Only a few shots were fired occasionally. The Finns held the line to the end of the Winter War. Two commanders from Finnish side were promoted. Paavo Talvela was promoted from colonel to Major General on 18 December 1939. Aaro Pajari was promoted to Colonel on 18 December 1939. General Belyaev was dismissed from commanding on 16 December 1939, but preserved his rank. In June 1940 after re-attestation he was granted the rank of Major General.

In the United States, the classic rock format features rock music ranging generally from the mid-1960s to the 1980s, primarily focusing on commercially successful blues rock and hard rock popularized in the 1970s AOR format.Pareles, Jon (June 18, 1986). \\"Oldies on Rise in Album-Rock Radio\\". The New York Times. Retrieved April 19, 2019. The radio format became increasingly popular with the baby boomer demographic by the end of the 1990s. Although classic rock has mostly appealed to adult listeners, music associated with this format received more exposure with younger generations of listeners with the presence of the Internet and digital downloading.Kids are listening to their parents - Their parents' music, that is USA Today March 30, 2004 Some classic rock stations also play a limited number of current releases which are stylistically consistent with the station's sound, or by heritage acts that are still active and producing new music.\\"New York Radio Guide: Radio Format Guide\\", NYRadioGuide.com, 2009-01-12, webpage: NYRadio-formats. Conceptually, classic rock has been analyzed by academics as an effort by critics, media, and music establishments to canonize rock music and commodify 1960s Western culture for audiences living in a post-baby boomer economy. The music predominantly selected for the format has been identified as commercially successful songs by white male acts from the Anglosphere, expressing values of Romanticism, self-aggrandizement, and politically undemanding ideologies. History WWWM 105.7 logo in 1980. The classic rock format evolved from AOR radio stations that were attempting to appeal to an older audience by including familiar songs of the past with current hits.Hill, Douglas. \\"AOR Nears Crucial Crossroads: Demographics, Ad Pressures My Force Fragmentation\\" Billboard May 22, 1982: 1 In 1980, AOR radio station M105 in Cleveland began billing itself as \\"Cleveland's Classic Rock\\", playing a mix of rock music from the mid-1960s to the present.Scott, Jane. \\"The Happening\\" The Plain Dealer June 13, 1980: Friday 30 Similarly, WMET called itself \\"Chicago's Classic Rock\\" in 1981. In 1982, radio consultant Lee Abrams developed the \\"Timeless Rock\\" format which combined contemporary AOR with rock hits from the 1960s and 1970s.\\"Timeless Rock FM Format Is Taking Shape\\", Billboard November 6, 1982: 1 KRBE, an AM station in Houston, was an early classic rock radio station. In 1983 program director Paul Christy designed a format which played only early album rock, from the 1960s and early 1970s, without current music or any titles from the pop or dance side of Top 40.Kojan, Harvey. \\"KRBE: Classic Pioneer\\" Radio & Records July 13, 1990: 47 Another AM station airing classic rock, beginning in 1983, was KRQX in Dallas- Fort Worth. KRQX was co-owned with an album rock station, 97.9 KZEW. Management saw the benefit in the FM station appealing to younger rock fans and the AM station appealing a bit older. The ratings of both stations could be added together to appeal to advertisers. Classic rock soon became the widely used descriptor for the format and became the commonly used term among the general public for early album rock music. In the mid-1980s, the format's widespread proliferation came on the heels of Jacobs Media's (Fred Jacobs) success at WCXR, in Washington, D.C., and Edinborough Rand's (Gary Guthrie) success at WZLX in Boston. Between Guthrie and Jacobs, they converted more than 40 major market radio stations to their individual brand of classic rock over the next several years.Freeman, Kim. \\"Classic Rock Thrives In 18 Months\\" Billboard October 25, 1986: 10 Billboard magazine's Kim Freeman posits that \\"while classic rock's origins can be traced back earlier, 1986 is generally cited as the year of its birth\\".Kim Freeman. \\"Labels Fight Losing Battle vs. Classic Rock\\".

Programming Typically, classic rock stations play rock songs from the mid-1960s through the 1980s. Classic rock stations have historically been hesitant to add 1990s rock such as alternative rock and grunge to their playlists, due in part to the drastic difference in style, but (mirroring a similar trend in classic country, where a similar 1990-era divide also exists) a small number of classic rock stations began adding 1990s music in the early 2010s. Most recently there has been a \\"newer classic rock\\" under the slogan of the next generation of classic rock. Stations such as WLLZ in Detroit, WBOS in Boston and WXZX in Columbus play music focusing more on harder edge classic rock from the 1980s to the 2000s.WLLZ, Detroit‚Äôs Wheels, rocks the airwaves againArts & Entertainmenttheoaklandpress.com105.7 switches from sports to classic rock - The Columbis DispatchWBOS/Boston Flips From Alternative To 'Rock 92.9, The 'Next Generation Of Classic Rock'There has been a recent revival in the older fashions of classic rock in the early 2000s. Back in the prime of classic rock radio during the 1970s and 1980s, when it was mainstream, and radio was the main form of accessing the music, classic rock soared in to every individual's ear. Classic rock will not overtake the current style of hip-hop/pop, but teenagers specifically are set to introduce the contents of classic rock into their rotation of music. The peak of classic rock in the 1980s had its downfall in the 1990s and has risen back to streaming platforms and internet sources, which is why it is engaging this teenage audience once again. Some of the bands that dominated classic rock radio in the past included, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, and Hendrix.The songs of the Rolling Stones, particularly from the 1970s, have become staples of classic rock radio. \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" (1965), \\"Under My Thumb\\" (1966), \\"Paint It, Black\\" (1966), and \\"Miss You\\" (1978) are among their most popular selections, with Complex calling the latter \\"an eternal mainstay on classic-rock radio\\". For today‚Äôs young adults and teens interested in classic rock, will see these bands as icons, but bands like Pearl Jam have a controversial act with older fans that would not consider that in the genre of classic rock. Despite this, fans turn to other music besides what is mainstream music today. Now shifting toward the present these are making a comeback to easier access through the process of streaming music. Nowadays music is constantly new, where a lot of the songs come and go. Because of this, teens specifically have veered away from their current popular music, and have shifted back toward an older style.  Analysis and criticism  Classic-rock radio programmers largely play \\"tried and proven\\" hit songs from the past based on their \\"high listener recognition and identification\\", says media academic Roy Shuker, who also identifies white male rock acts from the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper-era through the end of the 1970s as the focus of their playlists. As Catherine Strong observes, classic rock songs are generally performed by white male acts from either the United States or the United Kingdom, \\"have a four-four time, very rarely exceed the time limit of four minutes, were composed by the musicians themselves, are sung in English, played by a 'classical' rock formation (drums, bass, guitar, keyboard instruments) and were released on a major label after 1964.\\" The format's origins are traced by music scholar Jon Stratton to the emergence of a classic-rock canon. This canon arose in part from music journalism and superlative lists ranking certain albums and songs that are consequently reinforced to the collective and public memory. Robert Christgau says the classic-rock concept transmogrified rock music into a \\"myth of rock as art- that-stands-the-test-of-time\\". He also believes it was inevitable that certain rock artists would be canonized by critics, major media, and music establishment entities such as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Confirming this assessment in 2018, Steven Hyden recalls how the appearance of classic rock as a timeless music lent it a distinction from the \\"inherently nihilistic\\" pop he had first listened to on the radio as a teenager in the early 1990s. \\"[I]t seemed to have been around forever,\\" he writes of the classic rock format. \\"It was there long before I was born, and I was sure it was still going to be around after I was gone.\\" Politically, the mindset underlying classic rock is regarded by Christgau as regressive. He says the music in this format abandoned ironic sensibilities in favor of unintellectual, conventional aesthetics rooted in Victorian era Romanticism, while downplaying the more radical aspects of 1960s counterculture, such as politics, race, African- American music, and pop in the art sense. \\"Though classic rock draws its inspiration and most of its heroes from the '60s, it is, of course, a construction of the '70s,\\" he writes in 1991 for Details magazine. \\"It was invented by prepunk/predisco radio programmers who knew that before they could totally commodify '60s culture they'd have to rework it‚Äîthat is, selectively distort it till it threatened no one ... In the official rock pantheon the Doors and Led Zeppelin are Great Artists while Chuck Berry and Little Richard are Primitive Forefathers and James Brown and Sly Stone are Something Else.\\" Regarding the relationship of economics to the rise of classic rock, Christgau points to the compromised socioeconomic security and diminishing collective consciousness of a new generation of listeners in the 1970s, who succeeded rock's early years during baby-boomer economic prosperity in the United States: \\"Not for nothing did classic rock crown the Doors' mystagogic middlebrow escapism and Led Zep's chest-thumping megalomaniac grandeur. Rhetorical self-aggrandizement that made no demands on everyday life was exactly what the times called for.\\" Shuker attributes the rise of classic-rock radio in part to \\"the consumer power of the aging post-war 'baby boomers' and the appeal of this group to radio advertisers\\". In his opinion, classic rock also produced a rock music ideology and discussion of the music that was \\"heavily gendered\\", celebrating \\"a male homosocial paradigm of musicianship\\" that \\"continued to dominate subsequent discourse, not just around rock music, but of popular music more generally.\\" See also * Active rock * Adult album alternative * Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies * List of music radio formats * Mainstream rock * Music radio * Rockism and poptimism References 1950s in music 1960s in music 1970s in music 1980s in music 1990s in music 2000s in music 2010s in music Radio formats Rock radio formats ","title":"Classic rock"},{"id":"294096","text":"Stocks, unlike the pillory or pranger, restrain only the feet. Stocks are restraining devices that were used as a form of corporal punishment and public humiliation. Form and application The stocks, pillory, and pranger each consist of large wooden boards with hinges; however, the stocks are distinguished by restraining one's feet. The stocks consist of placing boards around the ankles and wrists, whereas, with the pillory, the boards are fixed to a pole and placed around the arms and neck, forcing the punished to stand. Some consider the stocks an example of torture and cruel and unusual punishment. Victims may be insulted, kicked, tickled, spat on, or subjected to other inhumane acts. In the Bible, the treatment of Paul and Silas, disciples of Jesus, was detailed in the Acts of the Apostles: \\"Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.\\"Bible, Acts 16:24. This most likely occurred around the year 57. The Old Testament's book of Job also describes the stocks, referring to God: :He puts my feet in the stocks, he watches all my paths.Job 13:27. Biblical scholars are unable to agree on when Job lived. But, it is most likely that he lived somewhere between 2350 and 1400 B.C. The stocks were employed by civil and military authorities from medieval to early modern times including Colonial America. Public punishment in the stocks was a common occurrence from around 1500 until at least 1748.Earle, Alice Morse. \\"Curious Punishments of Bygone Days,\\" (1896), available in digitized form through the Gutenberg project. The stocks were especially popular among the early American Puritans, who frequently employed the stocks for punishing the \\"lower class\\".Cox, James A., \\"Colonial Crimes and Punishments\\" , CW Journal, Spring 2003. Retrieved 2011-11-09. In the American colonies, the stocks were also used, not only for punishment, but as a means of restraining individuals awaiting trial. The offender would be exposed to whatever treatment those who passed by could imagine. This could include tickling of the feet. As noted by the New York Times in an article dated November 13, 1887, \\"Gone, too, are the parish stocks, in which offenders against public morality formerly sat imprisoned, with their legs held fast beneath a heavy wooden yoke, while sundry small but fiendish boys improved the occasion by deliberately pulling off their shoes and tickling the soles of their defenseless feet.\\"David Ker's New York Times article, \\"England in Old Times\\" (page 11 of New York Times, November 13, 1887) Village stocks in Bramhall, England. England's Statute of Labourers 1351 prescribed the use of the stocks for \\"unruly artisans\\" and required that every town and village erect a set of stocks. Sources indicate that the stocks were used in England for over 500 years and have never been formally abolished. Finger pillories often went by the name of \\"finger stocks\\". Public stocks were typically positioned in the most public place available, as public humiliation was a critical aspect of such punishment. Typically, a person condemned to the stocks was subjected to a variety of abuses, ranging from having refuse thrown at them, tickling to paddling, whipping of the unprotected feet (bastinado). Their last recorded use in the United Kingdom was in 1872 at either Adpar, Newcastle Emlyn, west WalesJohn May, Reference Wales (1994) or Newbury, Berkshire, England (11 June).Unknown, Sheffield Daily Telegraph (Friday 14 June 1872) In Toronto, Ontario, Canada, court records from 1811 required the building of a set of stocks for punishment. The Spanish conquistadores introduced stocks as a popular form of punishment and humiliation against those who impeded the consolidation of their settlements in the new world. They were still used in the 19th century in Latin America to punish indigenous miners in many countries for rebelling against their bosses.  Modern use  = United States = American courts normally punish offenders by sentencing them to incarceration in jail or prison or to probation, which may include community service. In United States v. Gementera, (2004) the defendant was convicted of mail theft and sentenced, among other measures, to stand in front of a post office for eight hours wearing a sandwich board that read: \\"I stole mail. This is my punishment.\\" The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld this sentence, finding that the district court did not impose it solely for the purpose of humiliation, but also to serve the criminal-justice goals of deterrence and rehabilitation. The Ninth Circuit further found that the alternative sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and unusual punishment because it was \\"within the limits of civilized standards\\" and was not coupled with a lengthy prison sentence. In 1989 the Arkansas town of Dermott passed a curfew law punishable by up to thirty days in jail for the offender and up to two days in the stocks for the offender's parents. The city almost immediately remitted the punishment because, among other things, the city did not have a set of stocks and had allocated no funds to build one. =United Kingdom= The British town of Thame made international headlines in 2016 when it took up a proposal to build stocks in the town. Introduced by Councillor David Bretherton, the stocks would be used for hire and for charitable events. As noted by Bretherton, \\"Perhaps for charity we could do something like that, get people in the stocks and have others donate money for the time they last while having their feet tickled.‚Äù Bretherton noted that the stocks were still legal in England. It is not believed that the stocks would be used for actual punishment purposes. Currently, further study of the topic is ongoing. = Colombia = In Colombia in 2012, married thirty-four-year-old Alfreda Blanco Basilio and her eighteen-year-old lover Luis Martinez were placed in stocks by the Sampues tribe in Colombia due to Basilio's adultery. Basilio spent 72 hours barefoot in the stocks for her offense.Brian Andrews on NTN24 and RCN, \\"Couple having an affair put in stocks by Indian tribe in Columbia\\" The Stocks at Belstone in Dartmoor, a Grade II listed monument.

Afterwards Talvela was promoted to the rank of major, and was at the time the youngest major in Finland. In accordance with his nationalistic views, Talvela temporarily resigned from the Finnish Army to act as a leading figurehead for the Kinship Wars of the 1920s. He served as the Commander in Chief of the 1919 Aunus expedition. In 1923, Talvela graduated from the Coastal Artillery School's Battery Commander Course in Llandudno, Wales. He graduated from the Finnish Academy for General Staff in the year of 1926. In 1929, Talvela once more resigned from the military, this time as a political gesture and in order to focus on his business career, whereupon he became deputy director of Suomi- Filmi from 1929 until 1932.

His daring victory at the Battle of Tolvaj√§rvi buoyed Finnish defenders on all fronts of the conflict. For this success he was promoted to Major General in December 1939, the first promotion to general's rank during the war. In February of 1940, a few weeks before the end of the war, Talvela took the command of the Finnish III Army Corps in the Karelian Isthmus. When the war initially ended on 13 March 1940, Talvela returned to civilian life. However, once the Finnish-German relations warmed during the Interim Peace, Talvela was granted near-absolute rights in setting up large foreign shipments and trade workings through Petsamo, which at the time was Finland's only port on the Arctic Ocean. At Mannerheim's request, he often traveled abroad, especially to Germany, seeking support for Finland. During the early stages of the Continuation War, Talvela commanded the Finnish IV Corps in Karelia, a campaign in which the IV Corp decisively defeated the Soviet 23rd Army at the Battle of Porlampi and thus became the first formation to reach their objectives, for which he was honoured with Finland's highest military honour, becoming the Second Knight of the Mannerheim Cross. In January 1942 Talvela was promoted to Lieutenant General until February 1944, when Talvela was the Finnish representative at the German High Command. Once back in Finland, Talvela commanded first the Finnish II Corps in Northern Karelia until June 1944, when he took over the command of the Aunus Group in Eastern Karelia. In July 1944 Talvela was sent back to Germany, where he remained until Finland made peace with the Soviet Union in early September 1944. When he was about to depart for Finland, Himmler reportedly asked Talvela to become the head of a pro-German faction in Finland. Talvela refused out of hand. After the war Talvela spent some years in South America as a representative of Finnish paper industry, until returning to Finland. He also held numerous senior business positions during his post-war life. On 6 December 1966 he was promoted to General of Infantry under retirement.  Behaviour  Talvela was a very able and aggressive commander in offense, but he was less well suited to defensive warfare. He was prone to vanity and temper tantrums and his stubbornness made Talvela a very difficult subordinate. He performed best when given independent commands.

The key length is also 96 bits. The figure 96 arises from the use of three 32 bit words in the algorithm, from which also is derived the cipher's name. When 3-Way was invented, 96-bit keys and blocks were quite strong, but more recent ciphers have a 128-bit block, and few now have keys shorter than 128 bits. 3-Way is an 11-round substitution‚Äìpermutation network. 3-Way is designed to be very efficient in a wide range of platforms from 8-bit processors to specialized hardware, and has some elegant mathematical features which enable nearly all the decryption to be done in exactly the same circuits as did the encryption. 3-Way, just as its counterpart BaseKing, is vulnerable to related key cryptanalysis.

It was used as a safety valve for a hydraulic power network and could reach a height of about . In 1891, its aesthetic value was recognised and it was moved to its present location to celebrate the Federal Gymnastics Festival and the 600th anniversary of the Swiss Confederation, when it was operated for the first time. Its maximum height was about 90 metres (295 feet). The present Jet d'Eau was installed in 1951 in a partially submerged pumping station to pump lake water instead of city water.

She appears in the Saga of Erik the Red and the Saga of the Greenlanders, known collectively as the Vinland sagas. She and her husband √ûorfinnur Karlsefni, led an expedition to Vinland where their son Snorri √ûorfinnsson was born, believed to be the first European birth in the Americas outside of Greenland. In Iceland, Gudrid is known by her byname v√≠√∞f√∂rla (lit. wide-fared or far-travelled). Biography As recorded in The Saga of Eirik the Red, Gudrid was the daughter of a chieftain by the name of Thorbjorn of Laugarbrekka. As the story goes, a young man by the name of Einar asked for her hand in marriage, but because his father was a slave, Gudrid‚Äôs father refused to give her hand in marriage. Gudrid and her father promptly left Iceland and voyaged to Greenland to accompany Eirik the Red. Thirty others went with them on the journey, but the group experienced complications due to poor weather, which slowed their progress during the summer. After this setback, illness plagued the group and half of the company died. Despite these failures, Gudrid and her father landed safely in Greenland in the winter. Although it is not mentioned in The Saga of Eirik the Red, according to the Saga of the Greenlanders, at the time Gudrid was married to a Norwegian merchant named Thorir. According to this account, Leif Eirikson rescued Gudrid and fifteen men from a skerry, brought them safely to Brattahl√≠√∞, and invited Thorir and Gudrid to stay there with him. That winter, Thorir died of illness. In Eirik the Red‚Äôs Saga, Gudrid exemplifies the transition from the pagan Norse religion to Christianity. One winter, Gudrid, her father Thorbjorn, and his companions feast at the home of Thorkel, who is visited by a seeress named Thorbjorg. Thorbjorg arrives at Thorkel‚Äôs home, intending to carry out several magic rites, specifically ward songs, for which she needs the women present to help chant. Gudrid is the only woman present who knows the songs, having been taught them by her foster- mother Halldis, but she tells Thorbjorg that ‚ÄúThese are the sort of actions in which I intend to take no part, because I am a Christian woman‚Äù. With minimal effort, however, Thorbjorg and Thorkel convince Gudrid that taking part in the chants will help the people present, and not damage her status as a Christian woman. Gudrid performs the songs with admirable skill. According to both sagas, Gudrid then married Thorstein Eiriksson, Leif Eiriksson's younger brother and Eirik the Red's son. According to the Saga of the Greenlanders, Gudrid then accompanied her husband on his quest to Vinland, with the hope that he could retrieve the body of his brother Thorvald. The two spent the winter in Lysufjord with a man by the name of Thorstein the Black and his wife Grimhild, but illness soon struck the group and both Grimhild and Gudrid‚Äôs husband Thorstein died. According to this account, Thorstein temporarily rises from his dead bed to tell Gudrid that she will be married to an Icelander and that they will have a long life together with many descendants. He stated that she would leave Greenland to go to Norway and then Iceland, and after a pilgrimage south, she would return to Iceland, where a church would be built near her farm. According to the Saga of Eirik the Red, Thorstein makes the voyage to Vinland by himself, and it is only upon his return that the two marry. According to the Saga, ‚ÄúThorstein had a farm and livestock in the western settlement at a place called Lysufjord‚Äù and another man by the name of Thorstein (whose wife in this version is named Sigrid) owned a half-share on this farm. The couple moved to the farm and, like in the Saga of the Greenlanders, Thorstein died and told Gudrid of her future, although in this version he focuses more on the importance of Christianity, asking Gudrid to ‚Äúdonate their money to the poor.‚Äù After his death, Gudrid moved back to Brattahl√≠√∞, where she married a merchant named Thorfinn Karlsefni, who is described in the Saga of Eirik the Red as being ‚Äúa man of good family and good means‚Äù and ‚Äúa merchant of good repute‚Äù. According to The Saga of the Greenlanders, after their marriage, and at Gudrid‚Äôs urging, the two led an attempt to settle V√≠nland with sixty men, five women, and a cargo of various livestock (while it is implied in The Saga of Eirik the Red that she accompanies him, Gudrid is never actually mentioned in the account of the journey). While in V√≠nland, the couple had a son whom they named Snorri Thorfinnsson, who is the first European reported to be born in the Western Hemisphere. There is speculation about the birth date of Snorri with birth years such as 1005, 1009, and 1012 being postulated, but all sources agree that he was born between 1005 and 1013. According to the Vinland sagas, when Snorri was 3 years old, the family left Vinland because of hostilities with indigenous peoples (called Skr√¶lingar by the settlers, meaning \\"barbarians\\"). The family returned to the Glaumb√¶r farm in Seyluhreppur, Iceland.Glaumb√¶r (Historical Places in Northwest Iceland) According to The Saga of Eirik the Red, the couple had another son named Thorbjorn. Although it is only mentioned in The Saga of the Greenlanders, Thorfin died, leaving Gudrid to live as a widow. Christianisation of Iceland during this period meant that religious conversions were common.Christianisation of Iceland (√Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies) Gudrid converted to Christianity and, when Snorri married, went on a pilgrimage to Rome. While some have discussed the possibility that Gudrid spoke with the Pope on her journey, there is no proof of it. While she was away, Snorri built a church near the estate, fulfilling the prediction that Thorstein had made. When she came back from Rome, she became a nun and lived in the church as a hermit. Genealogy Her son Snorri Thorfinnsson had two children; a daughter named Hallfrid, and a son named Thorgeir. Hallfrid was the mother of Thorlak Runolfsson, bishop of Sk√°lholt in the south of Iceland. Thorgeir was the father of Yngvild, the mother of the first Bishop Brand. One of the descendants of her son Thorbjorn, Bjorn Gilsson, was also a bishop of H√≥lar. Below is the genealogy of descendants of Snorri, as given in the close of each saga, Gr≈ìnlendinga saga ch. 9 and Eir√≠ks saga ch. 14.The saga texts obviously do not bother to reiterate the patronymic form in nominative case at every instance.

Memorials There is a statue created by the sculptor √Åsmundur Sveinsson in 1938 for the 1939 New York World's Fair of Gudrid on display at Glaumb√¶r, in Iceland. Other copies of this statue are on display in Laugarbrekka in the Sn√¶fellsnes peninsula on Iceland and in Ottawa, Canada. The statue depicts her on a boat, carrying her son Snorri on her shoulder.

Cockburn was brought up by British parents in Ireland but had lived and worked in the United States since 1972. Together with Jeffrey St. Clair, he edited the political newsletter CounterPunch. Cockburn also wrote the \\"Beat the Devil\\" column for The Nation as well as one for The Week in London, syndicated by Creators Syndicate. Background Alexander Cockburn was born on June 6, 1941, in Scotland and grew up in Youghal, County Cork, Ireland. He was the eldest son of the former Communist author and journalist, Claud Cockburn, by his third wife, Patricia Byron, n√©e Arbuthnot (who also wrote an autobiography, Figure of Eight). His ancestral family included Sir George Cockburn, 10th Baronet, who was responsible for the burning of Washington in the War of 1812. His two younger brothers, Andrew Cockburn and Patrick Cockburn, are also journalists. His half-sister, the barrister and mystery writer Sarah Caudwell, died in 2000. In addition, journalists Laura Flanders and Stephanie Flanders are his half-nieces, daughters of his half-sister Claudia Cockburn and her husband Michael Flanders. Actress Olivia Wilde is his niece, daughter of his brother Andrew Cockburn. Cockburn grew up between his family home in Ireland and Glenalmond College, an independent boys' boarding school, in Perthshire, Scotland, where his brothers Patrick and Andrew were also educated. It was at Glenalmond that he recalls being bullied for being Irish because Ireland was neutral during WWII. It was partly this experience which led Cockburn to choose Irish citizenship over British citizenship. He went on to study English at Keble College, University of Oxford. Career =UK= It was at Oxford and the circles he mixed in thereafter that Cockburn became good friends with Robin Blackburn, as well as other left-wing writers like Tariq Ali, Tom Nairn, and Perry Anderson. Cockburn graduated in 1963 and worked in London as a journalist associated with the New Left Review. Alexander helped in the early re-shaping of New Left Review, joining the editorial committee and becoming managing editor in 1966, while he held a job as an assistant editor at the Times Literary Supplement and moved to the New Statesman in 1967. His early published work was as a co-editor to his friend Robin Blackburn, together they first worked on The Incompatibles: Trade Union Militancy and the Consensus (1967). In Blackburn's words the first project \\"brought together trade-union organizers, leftwing journalists including Paul Foot, Marxist economists and two liberals‚ÄîMichael Frayn and Philip Toynbee‚Äîwho mocked the demonization of union activists by Labour as well as Conservative pundits.\\" Looking back, Blackburn writes: \\"Sales were reasonable, not amazing; but the book did register a syndicalist militancy that was to upset three British governments, those of Wilson, Heath and Callaghan.\\" The second jointly edited collection was Student Power: Problems, Diagnosis, Action (1969), which compiled contributions from such figures as Herbert Marcuse, Perry Anderson, and Tom Nairn. It sold 75,000 copies. On 30 October 1968, Cockburn published a letter to The Times defending British socialists, who were marching against the Vietnam War, against the newspaper's criticism.David Widgery, The Left in Britain, 1956-68, Harmondsworth : Penguin, 1976. (p. 387-88). =USA= Alexander Cockburn moved to the United States in 1972 and once there set himself up as a journalist. He would become close friends with Noam Chomsky, Edward Said, Israel Shahak, Andrew Kopkind, and Saul Landau, among others. Cockburn wrote for many publications, including The New York Review of Books, Esquire, and Harper's. From 1973 to 1983 he was a writer with The Village Voice, originating its longstanding \\"Press Clips\\" column. In his time there, he interviewed Rupert Murdoch after a struggle over the ownership of The Voice culminated in Murdoch buying the paper.Adam Curtis BBC Blog; Rupert Murdoch A Portrait of Satan. 30 January 2011.http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/adamcurtis/2011/01/rupert_murdoch_- _a_portrait_of.html James Ridgeway later noted \\"Murdoch, when he owned the Voice, was said to gag on some of Alex's pointed epithets, but he never did anything about it. He actually had us both to lunch and offered us a column.\\"Ridgeway, James; Remembering Alexander Cockburn  23 July 2012  https://www.motherjones.com/media/2012/07/ridgeway-alexander-cockburn Cockburn went on to write Idle Passion: Chess and the Dance of Death (1975) as a class history of chess, and a lot of \\"bogus Freudian stuff\\", as he would later put it, in a critical evaluation of the claims made for chess.C-SPAN, In Depth with Alexander Cockburn. 1 April 2007  http://www.c-span.org/video/?196500-1/Cockbu In the late 1970s, Cockburn and Ridgeway wrote Political Ecology in which they went through numerous areas of US domestic policy, whether it was housing or agriculture, critically examining each topic, making proposals to adjust policy. Cockburn was later suspended, as The Voice stated, for \\"accepting a $10,000 grant from an Arab studies organization in 1982\\". His defenders charge that his criticism of Israeli government policies was behind the firing. In 1984, Cockburn found a regular position at The Nation with a column called \\"Beat the Devil\\" after the title of the novel written by his father. He went on to write columns for the New York Press, the Los Angeles Times, and the New Statesman. Cockburn was also a regular contributor to the Anderson Valley Advertiser and later The Week. He was not afraid to write for newspapers which took a conservative editorial standpoint, such as The Wall Street Journal for which Cockburn wrote for ten years, even becoming a columnist for Chronicles in 2009. As an author of around twenty books, Cockburn produced work covering an array of different areas and with many fellow writers. In 1987, he completed what would be the first of a series of books composed of columns, diary entries, letters, and essays dating from 1976. It was called Corruptions of Empire (1988) and its cover featured a portrayal of Admiral George Cockburn torching the White House with slaves escaping.C-SPAN, Journalism in U.S. and How Americans Receive World News. 17 December 1987  http://www.c-span.org/video/?241-1/USan To follow up, Cockburn published The Golden Age Is In Us: Journeys and Encounters (1995) in much the same mode, combining diary entries with columns, essays, and letters, even including hate mail. The last collection in this series was A Colossal Wreck: A Road Trip Through Political Scandal, Corruption, and American Culture (2013), which was published posthumously, having completed it shortly before his death.https://www.versobooks.com/books/1711-a-colossal- wreck Cockburn was a permanent resident of the United States from 1973 as an Irish citizen. He became a US citizen in 2009. He lived in New York City for many years, before moving to Petrolia in Humboldt County in northern California in 1992.Daisy Cockburn: Painting in My Father's Garden Retrieved 2016-11-25. =CounterPunch= In 1993 Ken Silverstein set out to establish a newsletter upon moving to Washington from Brazil, and Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair were soon on board. The aim was a newsletter capable of \\"muckraking with a radical attitude\\" drawing on inspiration from Edward Abbey, Peter Maurin, and Ammon Hennacy, as well as the left-wing populist newsletter Appeal to Reason. The end result was CounterPunch. It was first a printed newsletter until 1998 when Cockburn and St. Clair took CounterPunch online. By that time, Silverstein had moved on, leaving Cockburn and St. Clair to co-edit the newsletter from 1996 until Cockburn's death in 2012. The newsletter drew in contributions from individuals such as: Robert Fisk, Edward Said, Tim Wise, Ralph Nader, John Pilger, Tariq Ali, Uri Avnery, Norman Finkelstein, Noam Chomsky, Ward Churchill, Gail Dines, Diana Johnstone, Noel Ignatiev, Saul Landau, Vijay Prashad, Cynthia McKinney, Doug Henwood, Israel Shamir, Jonathan Cook, and Fidel Castro. Importantly the site has never sought to avoid publishing articles from writers of right-wing, libertarian, and populist perspectives. Key examples are Paul Craig Roberts, Dean Baker, and William Lind. By 2007 CounterPunch had become one of the biggest websites on the English-speaking Left with \\"around 3 million unique hits a month\\" according to Cockburn. Personal life and death In December 1968, Cockburn married writer Emma Tennant; they had one daughter, Daisy Alice Cockburn, in February 1969. Cockburn and Tennant divorced in 1973. Cockburn died on 21 July 2012, in Bad Salzhausen, Germany, age 71, after suffering from cancer for two years.Nichols, John. \\"Alexander Cockburn and the Radical Power of the Word\\". The Nation, July 21, 2012. His death was a shock to many of his readers as his deterioration was a closely guarded secret of his friends and colleagues. Not long after, Jeffrey St. Clair wrote on CounterPunch: \\"He didn't want the disease to define him. He didn't want his friends and readers to shower him with sympathy. He didn't want to blog his own death as Christopher Hitchens had done. Alex wanted to keep living his life right to the end. He wanted to live on his terms.

At times acerbic, Cockburn could also be gently and humorously ironic, once declaring Gerald Ford America's greatest president for \\"doing the least damage\\" and praising the Lewinsky scandal's entertainment value. In the same vein, he has also expressed his admiration for the beauty of both Tipper Gore and Laura Bush. His nudge-nudge, wink-wink brand of humor was demonstrated in his response to a question asking for a comparison between George W. Bush and Napoleon. He replied that he wasn't sure about Bush as Napoleon, \\"though surely Josephine's heart beats beneath Laura's delicious bosom\\".The extreme sport of insult, Reported by John Leo, 22 December 2003, in US News and World Report online =Anti-war positions= In a January 1980, Village Voice column, Cockburn criticized the US media's coverage of the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, and described Afghanistan as \\"An unspeakable country filled with unspeakable people, sheepshaggers and smugglers. ...

The Harper's piece concluded \\"A pair of binoculars could have told the officers of the Vincennes what was flying overhead. But binoculars don't cost half a billion dollars. The more complex the weaponry, the deeper the pork barrel and the more swollen the bottom line.\\"Silverstein, K; A \\"Brilliant Life: Remembering Alexander Cockburn\\", Harper's Magazine, 25 July 2012, http://harpers.org/blog/2012/07/a-brilliant-life-remembering-alexander- cockburn/Cockburn, A; Silverstein, K; \\"The System That Brought Down Flight 655\\", Harper's Magazine, September 1988, http://harpers.org/archive/1988/09/the-system-that-brought-down-flight-655/ Cockburn denounced the economic and political sanctions imposed on the Iraqi government by the United Nations, but Cockburn was more aggressive than most in his criticisms of American and British actions during the 12 years between the formal resolution of the Persian Gulf War and the 2003 invasion. In a column published in 2000, Cockburn averred that the economic embargo imposed upon Iraq was \\"demonically designed to prompt gnawing, endless suffering throughout Iraq's social economy\\". In the same column, Cockburn concluded that every major Republican or Democratic nominee running in the 2000 presidential election was supportive of Iraq sanctions, and was therefore complicit in mass murder.Cockburn, Alexander, The Free Press ‚Äì Independent News Media, 2/2000. At times, Cockburn displayed prescience in his writing. On September 12, 2001, he wrote \\"The targets abroad will be all the usual suspects: rogue states (most of which, like the Taliban or Saddam Hussein, started off as creatures of US intelligence). The target at home will be the Bill of Rights.\\"Cockburn, Alexander; A Colossal Wreck: A Road trip Through Political Scandal, Corruption and American Culture  2013, p. 201‚Äì202. Cockburn went on to join the opposition to the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq by American, British and other national military forces (the self-described \\"Coalition of the Willing\\"). He forged alliances with libertarians and others concerned by the USA Patriot Act. In the wake of the capture of Saddam Hussein, Cockburn penned a column entitled \\"How to kill Saddam\\", in which he argued that the ensuing trial of Hussein would be a sham, conducted by a \\"kangaroo court\\", and that Hussein's conviction and ultimate execution were foregone conclusions. =Conspiracy theories= Alexander Cockburn was an opponent of conspiracism, particularly in regard to the 9/11 conspiracy theories, interpreted its rise as a sign of the decline of the American Left.Cockburn, A; \\"The 9/11 Conspiracists and the Decline of the American Left\\", CounterPunch, 28 November 2006, http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/11/28/the-9-11-conspiracists-and-the- decline-of-the-anmerican-left/ At CounterPunch Cockburn and St. Clair ran articles by Manual Garcia, a physicist, on the events of September 11, 2001, challenging the conspiracy theories that have been circling since the attacks.Cockburn, A; St. Clair, J; \\"Debunking the Myths of 9/11\\", 28 November 2006, http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/11/28/debunking-the-myths-of-9-11/ In an interview with Tao Ruspoli, Cockburn said, \\"No doubt about it, since I got here in the early 70s things have gone downhill. The Left is in terrible shape. What's the leading obsession of the Left right now? This whole, I think, mad idea that Bush and Cheney organised the attack on the World Trade Towers. I think it's absolutely insane. I think [Bush and Cheney] are capable of monstrous evil, I just think the theories they have ‚Äì of no plane hitting the Pentagon ‚Äì is nutty. It's like flying saucers.\\"Tao Ruspoli interviews Alexander Cockburn, Part 2, 2006, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XY6L6FIFVI He noted that his friend Chuck Spinney had a friend on the plane who was later identified by his dental records because his teeth were found inside the Pentagon. Cockburn writes in standard incisive wit \\"This doesn't faze the conspiracists. They're immune to any reality check. Spinney \\"worked for the government.\\" They switched the dental records. The Boeing 757 was flown to Nebraska for a rendezvous with President Bush, who shot the passengers, burned the bodies on the tarmac and gave Spinney's friend's teeth to Dick Cheney to drop through a hole in his trousers amid the debris in the Pentagon.\\" Earlier, Cockburn had been moved to present rebuttals to the JFK assassination conspiracy theories by the Oliver Stone film JFK when it came out in 1991. He wrote in 1993 that \\"In all the assassinology I've read or seen, Oswald is always unpersuasive. In JFK Oliver Stone hadn't the slightest idea how to portray him, which pointed up the weakness of his artistic insight and the preposterous premises on which it was based.\\"Cockburn, A; The Golden Age Is In Us: Journeys and Encounters, Verso Books, 1995, p. 352‚Äì353. He interpreted the assassination as an attempt by Lee Harvey Oswald, whom he deemed a leftist, to \\"take the pressure off Fidel Castro\\", and to that end it was successful at the level of the propaganda of the deed, Cockburn claims, because President Johnson later \\"suspended the CIA assassination bids\\" against Castro. He reiterated this view at a conference in 2010.Coalition for Justice, Peace, and the Environmental Conference, 9 April 2010, Although an opponent of the 9/11 Truth movement and the JFK assassination theories, when it comes to the possibility of prior knowledge of an attack on Pearl Harbor Cockburn maintained that \\"there is strong evidence that FDR did have knowledge that a Japanese naval force in the north Pacific was going to launch an attack on Pearl Harbor. It's quite possible Roosevelt thought it would be a relatively mild assault and thought it would be the final green light to get the US into the war.\\" =Free speech= In his writing Cockburn was a consistent exponent of free speech. On the campaign trail of 2004 Cockburn wrote \\"Free speech counts most when it's most risky. If you used the word 'Palestinian' in any public place when I first arrived in New York in the early 1970s you risked being punched in the face.\\"Cockburn, A; \\"The Free Speech Movement and Howard Stern\\"  16-18 2004  CounterPunch  http://www.counterpunch.org/2004/10/16/the-free-speech-movement-and-howard- stern/ When it came to 'political correctness' in the early 1990s Cockburn was critical, though he often stressed that the term had its origins as an in-joke on the Left in the 70s. He took a critical stance on hate speech legislation and wrote in 2009: \\"America is well on its way to making it illegal to say anything nasty about gays, Jews, blacks and women. 'Hate speech,' far short of any direct incitement to violence, is on the edge of being criminalized, with the First Amendment gone the way of the dodo.\\"Cockburn, A; \\"The Hate Crimes Bill: How Not to Remember Matthew Shepard\\"  June 26‚Äì28, 2010  http://www.counterpunch.org/2009/06/26/the-hate-crimes-bill-how-not-to- remember-matthew-shepard/ =Gun rights= In 1995, Cockburn wrote approvingly of a right-wing Patriot rally against gun control in Macomb County, Michigan.Cockburn, Alexander. \\"Who's Left? Who's Right?\\" The Nation Magazine, 12 June 1995. Cockburn claimed left-wingers should make common cause with the Patriot activists, saying \\"these young workers should be getting decent radical analysis and some respectful attention\\". Later in the article, Cockburn also accused left-wing journalists of exaggerating the threat the militia movement posed to American society: \\"There's a post-Oklahoma City cottage industry in left/prog journalism, featuring the whole of redneck or working-class America as part of some vast Neo-Nazi or KKK network, thus giving an agreeable 'frisson' to the genteel reader\\".Walsh, David, Prostration before reaction, World Socialist Web Site, 2 September 1998, Retrieved 12 January 2014Biehl, Janet, \\"Militia Fever:The Fallacy of \\"Neither Left nor Right\\" . Green Perspectives, A Social Ecology Publication, Number 37, April 1996 \\"when Bill Clinton was targeting the alleged danger posed by the militia movement in the 1990s, Cockburn defended them, likened them to the Zapatistas, and described one militia rally he attended as \\"amiable\\"\\"... Raimondo, Justin, \\"Alexander Cockburn, RIP 23 July 2012 Antiwar.com. Retrieved 12 January 2014. At a promotional event for his book 5 Days That Shook the World: Seattle and Beyond (2000) Cockburn was asked what his position on the Second Amendment was and responded \\"a native Mexican turkey wandered onto my property in Humboldt County, unaware that the California Fish and Game regulations permitted a window of vulnerability for the aforementioned wild turkey. I then proceeded to my 12-gauge and brought that turkey down, thirteen and a half pounds, plucked it, drew it, and ate it, with my loved ones as they say.\\"C-SPAN  Book Discussion: Five Days That Shook The World  30 November 2000  http://www.c-span.org/video/?161120-1/FiveD He was subsequently asked if he was opposed to all forms of gun control to which he quipped \\"I think people shouldn't carry Howitzers.\\" In the aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre of 2007, Cockburn wrote \\"There have been the usual howls from the anti-gun lobby, but it's all hot air. America is not about to dump the Second Amendment giving people the right to bear arms.\\" He advocated instead to arm hall-monitors and appropriately screen teachers and cited the instance of the shooting at the Appalachian School of Law in which the shooter was disarmed by students after killing three faculty members.Cockburn, A; \\"Lessons to be learned from the Virginia Tech shooting\\"  The Week  19 April 2007  http://www.theweek.co.uk/americas/43432/lessons-be-learned-virginia-tech- shooting#ixzz2sH5OcMmW =Green issues= By the late 1980s, Cockburn had turned his attention to the deforestation of the Amazon basin and the response to it by the conservation movement at the time. Alongside Susanna Hecht, Cockburn wrote The Fate of the Forest: Developers, Destroyers and Defenders of the Amazon (1989) in which they criticised environmentalists for disregarding indigenous rights, highlighting the Yanomami people in particular, and challenged the European belief that the Amazon was \\"virgin forest\\". Cockburn and Hecht estimated that there may have been as many as 12 million people living in the Amazon basin when Europeans first arrived in 1500.Cockburn, A; Hecht, S; The Fate of the Forest  The New York Times  18 February 1990  https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/18/books/l-the-fate-of-the-forest-496590.html In the third chapter of the book Cockburn and Hecht covered the greenhouse question as reproduced below: > Combustion of petroleum products in the First World provides most of the > carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxides and chlorofluorocarbons going into > the atmosphere, but Third World energy use and deforestation contribute to > the ever-increasing amounts. One index of the changing situation is the > rising curve of complaints from satellite photo-analysts that they are > unable to get decent dry-season shots of the Amazon anymore, because of the > great clouds of smoke and particulates hanging over large parts of the > forest.

He believed the phenomenon has not been proven to be caused by humans.Is Global Warming a Sin? In 2008, Cockburn wrote A Short History of Fear in which he went after the subject of anthropogenic global warming and later writing in Spiked that \\"you can account for the current warming by a number of well-known factors - to do with the elliptical course of the Earth in its relationship to the sun, the axis of the Earth in the current period, and possibly the influence of solar flares.\\"Cockburn, A; \\"I am an intellectual blasphemer\\"Sp!ked25 January 2008http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/4357#.UvDpgvl_vxo He cited the statements of Martin Hertzberg that rising CO2 levels are a symptom, not a cause, of global warming, which Hertzberg asserts is the result of natural, predictable changes in the Earth's elliptic orbit. Hertzberg is a semi-retired explosives expert who does not claim to be a climatologist.Martin Hertzberg, Ph D The arguments given by Hertzberg and Cockburn are the famous Milankovitch cycles. Cockburn was also critical of the \\"greenhouse\\" explanation for warming by positing that it is incongruous with the laws of physics, specifically the second law of thermodynamics.Anthropogenic Global Warming is a Farce 24 December 2009 He cited the research of Gerhard Gerlich and Ralf Tscheuschner's Falsification of the Atmospheric CO2 Greenhouse Effects Within the Frame of Physics.This approved non-technical summary by Hans Schreuder ,24 June 2008 Yet Cockburn remained steadfast on other environmental concerns, such as conservation of the Great Lakes and stopping the agricultural run-off of pesticides into the lakes.Ruspoli, Tao;\\"Alexander Cockburn dumps on nuke- loving greens and man-made global warming\\"13 April 2011https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n92YenWfz0Y He was highly critical of the catalytic converter out of concern for the environmental impact, claiming \\"In the combustion process this sulfur is rendered into sulfur dioxide, which, as it crosses the platinum in the catalytic converter, becomes sulfur trioxide, which, with the addition of water (another consequence of gasoline combustion), becomes sulfuric acid.\\"Cockburn, A;\\"A Kind, Clean Word for the Clunker\\"Los Angeles Times15 March 1992 http://articles.latimes.com/1992-03-15/opinion/op-6552_1_catalytic-converter Cockburn was also critical of the originator of the Green Revolution concept. In an article in The Nation on Al Gore's 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, Cockburn made the following statement on Norman Borlaug's 1971 Nobel Prize: \\"Line up some of the more notorious Nobel Peace Prize recipients, such as Kissinger, and if you had to identify the biggest killer of all it was probably Norman Borlaug, one of the architects of the Green Revolution, which unleashed displacement, malnutrition, and death across the Third World.\\" Cockburn had criticized Borlaug previously on this issue.The Real Al Gore =Immigration= When asked about his standpoint on illegal immigration in 2007 Alexander Cockburn said \\"It is fundamentally wrong for a country, such as the United States, to have a lot of its economy posited on labour, demanding labour, which they then cause to be 'illegal',\\" and went on to claim that \\"Californian agriculture would collapse without 'illegal' immigrant labour. 'Illegal' in the words of the state.\\"C-SPAN, In Depth with Alexander Cockburn, 1 April 2007, http://www.c-span.org/video/?196500-1/Cockbu He criticised neoliberal reforms like free trade, \\"which destroy Mexican agriculture\\" through dumping American and Canadian corn in Mexico; as well as the denial of land reform citing examples such as Honduras and Guatemala. He elaborated \\"Gradually you make it impossible in the Southern countries for a peasantry to survive and make a go of it,\\" and concluded that this process has left people in Mexico, Central and South America little choice except to find work in the United States. Never shy to draw upon right-wing sources, in April and March 2010, Cockburn wrote articles on Hispanic crime statistics, drawing on the work of Ron Unz, publisher of The American Conservative, arguing that \\"Hispanic crimes rates are at least the same as whites and‚Äîgiven the unknown number of illegal Hispanic immigrants in the country‚Äîcould be considerably lower.\\" In CounterPunch Alexander went on to argue, on the basis of these statistics, and the US Census, that the estimates of 25 million Hispanic unreported illegal immigrants would mean that the true crime rates will be 35% lower than Unz estimates.Cockburn, A; \\"The Bogus Hispanic Crime Wave\\", CounterPunch, 5‚Äì7 March 2010, http://www.counterpunch.org/2010/03/05/the-bogus-hispanic-crime- wave/ He writes \\"Almost beyond the shadow of a doubt, white crime rates nationwide are significantly higher than Hispanic ones.\\" He went on to criticise Lou Dobbs for \\"scaremongering\\" on the subject of illegal immigration. In 2011, Cockburn wrote in favour of a substantial increase in the minimum wage, continued his opposition to anti-immigrant hysteria, envisioning a high-wage economic model as the alternative. While at the same time Cockburn writes sympathetically of proposals by Ron Unz to institute a tax-free cash payment of $5,000 to $10,000 to immigrants looking to return to their country of birth. He writes \\"Unz does us all a favor by raising important questions about the role of the reserve army of the unemployed or of migrants in sustaining the current low-wage capitalist economy. He poses an escape from the low-wage vortex, which is also all to the good.\\"Cockburn, A; \\"The Republicans, Immigration and the Minimum Wage\\", CounterPunch, September 30‚Äì2 October 2011, http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/09/30/goodbye-%E2%80%9Cpeak- oil%E2%80%9D-hello-glut/ In May 2012, Cockburn wrote of Marine Le Pen, leader of the French National Front, that she is a \\"nationalist politician, quite reasonably exploiting the intense social discontent in France amid the imposition of the bankers' austerity programs\\".Cockburn, Alexander; \\"Who are the real fascists: Marine Le Pen ‚Äì or the United States?\\" The Week, 3 May 2012 This was interpreted by some as a defence of the National Front. Cockburn went on to state that \\"Marine Le Pen certainly has made some unsavoury comments about immigrants and Islamisation. But she has gone to the heart of the matter, asserting that monetary union cannot be fudged, that it is incompatible with the French nation-state.\\" He went on to claim that Le Pen won 18% of the vote by campaigning to pull France out of the euro and, with reference to a poll finding only 3% of French voters consider immigration the main issue, that the National Front cannot owe its popularity to the issue. Rather, Cockburn stressed, \\"The number-one issue is employment.\\" =Israel and anti-Semitism= Cockburn wrote a great deal on the use of anti-Semitism accusations in modern politics, particularly by the state of Israel and its supporters, and co-edited a book on the subject, The Politics of Anti- Semitism. Cockburn was accused of anti-Semitism, which he always denied. He considered it an example of the use of that accusation to intimidate criticism of Israel and avert attention from Israel's policies. One of those making anti-Semitism charges against Cockburn was Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz. In November 2005, Dershowitz wrote to the National Catholic Reporter that Cockburn's CounterPunch website was anti-Semitic. This was in response to a review of Norman Finkelstein's book Beyond Chutzpah by CounterPunch contributor, Israeli academic Neve Gordon. Cockburn had previously accused Dershowitz, in 2003, of plagiarism, and, in October 2005, of supporting torture. Cockburn and Dershowitz each denied the other's charges. Dershowitz also claimed that Cockburn was one of three writers (along with Finkelstein and Noam Chomsky) engaged in an attempt to discredit him, which Cockburn also denied.The Hazards of Making The Case for Israel, Alan Dershowitz, JBooks.Com Promotional Interview, Retrieved 29 April 2006 A 2002 article on anti-Semitic remarks by Reverend Billy Graham reprinted elsewhere, discussed the furor over recently released tape-recorded conversations between Graham and President Richard Nixon. Cockburn contrasted that response to the response to revelations in 1989 that Graham had advocated destroying Vietnam's irrigation infrastructure, which by Nixon's estimate would kill a million civilians if the Paris peace talks failed. The latter revelations, in Cockburn's view, received little press coverage, while the anti-Semitic remarks caused a media firestorm. Cockburn wrote that Graham's anti-Semitic comments were \\"consonant with the standard conversational bill of fare at 75 percent of the country clubs in America, not to mention many a Baptist soiree? But they (Nixon, Graham, and White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman) didn't say they wanted to kill a million Jews. That's what Graham said about the Vietnamese and no one raised a bleat.\\" His critics quoted the final passage, reproduced below, to accuse Cockburn of spreading anti-Semitic conspiracy theories: > Certainly, there are a number of stories sloshing around the news now that > have raised discussions of Israel and of the posture of American Jews to an > acrid level. The purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government > scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and > with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around > the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in > America at the time of 9/11. On various accounts, they were trailing Mohamed > Atta and his associates, knew what was going to happen but did nothing about > it, or were simply spying on US facilities. In regards to the same passage, Suzanne Fields goes on to note \\"When asked if the stories were true, Mr Cockburn delicately demurs. 'I don't think I said they were true,' he told The New Republic. 'I don't know there's enough exterior evidence to determine whether they are true or not.'\\" Another of his critics was Franklin Foer of The New Republic, who first noted Cockburn's response: > To be fair, Cockburn doesn't exactly endorse these theories. Rather, by > noting that all of these Jewish conspiracy stories are \\"sloshing around the > news,\\" Cockburn seems merely to be pointing out that, hey, anti-Semitic > ideas are still out there today‚Äîso why the shock that [Billy Graham] > endorsed them 30 years ago? Indeed, when I reached Cockburn to ask him about > these conspiracies, he insisted he was just reporting what was already in > circulation.Foer, Franklin; Relativity Theory, The New Republic, April 2002. > https://www.newrepublic.com/article/relativity-theory In the same article, Foer notes that Cockburn pointed out in the 1980s that Joseph Sobran \\"had a history of publishing boorish books on the Jews\\" and that he later criticized Lech Walesa for indulging in crude stereotypes of Jews. In September 1995 Cockburn had also accused Franjo Tuƒëman of anti-Semitism while covering the expulsion of 150,000 Serbs from Krajina writing that \\"President Franjo Tudjman bellowed coarsely from his 'freedom train' that the refugees fled so fast that they didn't have time to take 'their dirty hard currency and their dirty underwear' ‚Äì language somewhat similar in timbre to Tudjman's diatribes against the Jews in his professorial writings.\\"Cockburn, Alexander; A Colossal Wreck, 2013 p. 30 In his ironically entitled essay \\"My Life as an \\"Anti-Semite\\", from pages 21‚Äì22 of The Politics of Anti-Semitism (2003), Cockburn wrote, \\"Over the past 20 years, I've learned there's a quick way of figuring out just how badly Israel is behaving. You see a brisk uptick in the number of articles here accusing the left of anti-Semitism.\\" He went on to add: \\"Back in the 1970s when muteness on the topic of how Israel was treating Palestinians was near-total in the United States, I'd get the anti-Semite slur hurled at me once in a while for writing about such no-no stuff as Begin's fascist roots in Betar, or the torture of Palestinians by Israel's security forces. I minded then, as I mind now, but overuse has drained the term of much clout.\\" In 2007, during a C-SPAN interview, a caller commented accusingly that \\"Anti-Semitism is thought of as a right-wing phenomenon traditionally. However, you left-wingers, using Israel's struggle for survival as an excuse, are the anti-Semites of the last quarter of the 20th Century and you're on your way in the 21st Century.\\"C-SPANIn Depth1 April 2007http://www.c-span.org/video/?196500-1/Cockbu Cockburn responded, \\"I think Israel is secure. I don't think it's struggling for survival... It's protected by the United States. I don't see any threat to Israel's survival; it's ludicrous to say so. I do see a threat to the survival of Palestinians, who are living on ‚Äì what? ‚Äì a dollar a day in Gaza.\\"C-SPAN, In Depth, 1 April 2007, http://www.c-span.org/video/?196500-1/Cockbu =Occupy Wall Street= With the emergence of the Occupy movement in 2011, Cockburn expressed support. \\"Its strength lies in the simplicity and truth of its basic message: the few are rich, the many are poor. In terms of its pretensions, the capitalist system has failed.\\" He elaborated: \\"right now most people love OWS. The Financial Times ran an editorial in favour of it. But in the end, to reform finance capital you have to offend people and institutions, including the Financial Times.\\" In spite of these doubts, Alexander Cockburn appeared at the nearest occupation to him in Eureka, California, in January 2012. There he gave a speech on Martin Luther King, Jr. as it was an event celebrating King's memory: > So there's no real choice this year, but what the Occupy movement has done > has taken us back to the era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said > 'This is unacceptable!' We cannot have a situation where everything is owned > by the 1% in the same way that Martin Luther King said in the Riverside > Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence > in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. > So the memory of Martin Luther King ‚Äì it's about dreams, but it's also about > the courage to draw a line right there and say 'We cannot go on crossing > this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the > world'. And there today America is on that line. And people know that what > we got to ‚Äì these years after Martin Luther King was murdered ‚Äì is > completely unacceptable, and it's his example that will inspire us as we go > forward into this year. In July 2012, shortly before his death, Cockburn noted \\"Questions of organization were obliterated by the strength of the basic message ‚Äì we are 99 per cent, they are one per cent. It was probably the most successful slogan since 'peace, land, bread'.\\" Though he ultimately felt his earlier cynicism had been confirmed, he stated \\"Before the fall came there were heroic actions, people battered senseless by the police. These were brave people trying to hold their ground.\\" =Same-sex marriage= In May 2012, Cockburn stated \\"I think gay marriage is an incredibly boring subject; though, I do like to hear right-wingers say that it will bring the whole edifice of Western civilization crashing down. It's hard, these days, to find such messages of good cheer.\\"Cockburn, A; \\"Gay Marriage and the Shackles of Matrimony\\"  Creators  18 May 2012  http://www.creators.com/opinion/alexander-cockburn/gay-marriage- and-the-shackles-of-matrimony.html Cockburn took an anti-assimilationist position on same-sex marriage, asking \\"Why would an institution which is basically taking church principles, you know, and applying them to a state license to get marriage be regarded as 'progressive'?\\" He felt it was inconsistent with a radical position, which sees the state as \\"intrusive on human freedoms\\"; though he did support equality at the level of civil partnerships, he didn't see why this should be limited to monogamous relationships. =Scientology= Cockburn criticized the German government for passing restrictive laws against the Church of Scientology, invoking several comparisons with Nazi Germany. Although he stated that Scientology deserved scrutiny, he also maintained that the demonization of any particular unpopular group ‚Äì even one officials consider a \\"cult\\" ‚Äì presented a far more imminent danger than the activities of Scientologists, or the organization they belong to.About Scientologists Take Offensive In Reich Land Statement From The Church Of Scientology He expressed concern over the designation of \\"cult\\" status given the Waco Siege of 1993 and how it may have contributed to the demonisation of groups. He later said in 2007 that \\"There is more evil in one second of the history of the Roman Catholic Church than there is in the entire lifetime of Scientology\\". Relationship with Hitchens Given that Alexander Cockburn was perceived as a British leftist (even though he was an Irish citizen) living in the US, he was often compared to Christopher Hitchens who had been a Trotskyist in Britain. The two of them were close friends in the 1980s as Hitchens had just arrived and Cockburn had been in the country for a decade already and was well situated to give Hitchens advice. They would meet regularly in Greenwich Village. Robin Blackburn remarked \\"Alexander sort of invented Christopher. He showed him what could be done.\\" Along with Ben Sonnenberg, Cockburn became co-godfather to Christopher's son Alexander Meleagrou-Hitchens.Cockburn, A; The Golden Age Is in Us: Journeys and Encounters, 1995, p. 112. Reciprocally, Christopher Hitchens was godfather to Henry Cockburn, the son of Patrick Cockburn and Alexander Cockburn's nephew. Nevertheless, there were ideological differences which opened up between them early on. Cockburn would later note that Hitchens \\"wrote some really awful stuff in the early 90s about how indigenous peoples‚ÄîIndians in the Americas‚Äîwere inevitably going to be rolled over by the wheels of Progress and should not be mourned.\\" Later Alexander Cockburn criticized Hitchens for the affidavit he swore out against Sidney Blumenthal, in the Clinton impeachment trial, to the effect that \\"[Hitchens] and his wife, Carol Blue, had lunch with White House aide Sidney Blumenthal last March 19 and that Blumenthal had described Monica Lewinsky as a stalker\\". Effectively this left Blumenthal open to perjury charges and the additional costs that the legal proceedings would entail. It left a rift between Blumenthal and Hitchens. The major break was over the 'War on Terrorism' beginning in 2001 when Hitchens launched an attack on Noam Chomsky for the position he took in the aftermath of 9/11. Not long after Cockburn lambasted Hitchens in a speech at an anti-war rally: > Now there's a weird thing going on. Partly proposed by a colleague of mine > writing in The Nation, Christopher Hitchens. He is saying, somehow he seems > to be saying, it is wrong to look at history, it is wrong to look at the > history of the past century.

He stated that the review was determined by the 25th anniversary of the book's original publication and not by the state of Said's health. On Cindy Sheehan, Hitchens backtracked: \\"On consideration, I would take back the word 'LaRouchie', which I applied not to her but to the words she said she didn't utter (but did).\\" Cockburn comments, \\"Six hundred and twenty-nine words into a seven hundred and eighty-two-word letter Hitchens addresses the very first point I raised, slipping us the news that he takes it back.\\" In an April 2009 interview with C-SPAN's Brian Lamb, Hitchens intimated that his friendship with Cockburn was still intact despite their disagreements. This was later supported by Patrick Cockburn at a Frontline Club event to promote A Colossal Wreck, in October 2013, where he claimed that Cockburn and Hitchens spoke over the phone and may have been in the same hospital at one point. According to Hitchens, he had recently attended a Cockburn family wedding in which Alexander officiated, and that he and Cockburn used to see each other more frequently when they had both lived on the same coast of the United States. In the same interview, Lamb and Hitchens discussed Cockburn's scathing remarks about Hitchens' criticisms of Said and Sheehan. Hitchens felt the intervening years had justified his criticisms of Sheehan, and expressed that \\"it's beneath Alexander to be defending someone as cheap and demagogic as her\\". In the case of Hitchens' criticisms of Said on his death bed, Hitchens replied, \\"It's actually rather silly of Alexander to say that...he's often written counter-obituaries of people who have been overpraised and has chosen precisely the moment when there's a lot of sentimental garbage being published to say, 'come on, this guy wasn't so great!'\\" Following Hitchens' death in 2011, Cockburn wrote an obituary of him for CounterPunch in which he heavily criticized the positions Hitchens had taken over the years. At one point writing \\"I guess the lowest of a number of low points was when [Hitchens] went to the White House to give a cheerleading speech on the eve of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.\\" In April 2012, there was a memorial for Christopher Hitchens and Cockburn penned a satirical playlet in which Hitchens goes to heaven where he is met by Henry Kissinger, Mother Teresa, Pope Pius V and John Paul II. The playlet was later incorporated into A Colossal Wreck.

The 12-string guitar is a steel-string guitar with 12 strings in six courses, which produces a thicker, more ringing tone than a standard six-string guitar. Typically, the strings of the lower four courses are tuned in octaves, with those of the upper two courses tuned in unison. The gap between the strings within each dual-string course is narrow, and the strings of each course are fretted and plucked as a single unit. The neck is wider, to accommodate the extra strings, and is similar to the width of a classical guitar neck. The sound, particularly on acoustic instruments, is fuller and more harmonically resonant than six-string instruments. Structurally, 12-string guitars, especially those built before 1970 (see below), differ from six-string guitars in these ways: #The headstock is elongated to accommodate 12 tuning machines. #The added tension of the six additional strings necessitates stronger reinforcement of the neck. #The body is also reinforced, and built with a stronger structure, to withstand the higher tension. #The fretting scale is generally shorter to reduce the overall string tension. Twelve-string guitars are made in both acoustic and electric forms. However, the acoustic type is more common. \\"Chorus\\" effect The double ranks of strings of the 12-string guitar produce a shimmering effect, because even the strings tuned in unison can never vibrate with precise simultaneity‚Äîthat is, they vibrate out of phase. The result to the ear is a sound that seems to \\"shimmer\\", which some describe as resembling strings that are slightly detuned. The interference between the out-of-phase vibrations produces a phenomenon known as a beat that results in a periodic rise and fall of intensity that is, in music, often considered pleasing to the ear. Pete Seeger described the distinctive sound of the 12-string guitar as \\"the clanging of bells.\\" Origin and history The origin of the modern 12-string guitar is not certain, but the most likely ancestors using courses of doubled strings are some Mexican instruments such as the guitarra s√©ptima, the guitarra quinta huapanguera, and the bajo sexto.See, Derek; \\"1930s Stella 12-String\\" At the end of the 19th century, the archtop mandolin was one of the first instruments with courses of doubled strings designed in the United States. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, 12-strings were regarded as \\"novelty\\" instruments. The 12-string guitar did not become a major part of blues and folk music till the 1920s and the 1930s, when their \\"larger than life\\" sound made them ideal as solo accompaniment for vocalists, especially Lead Belly and Blind Willie McTell. The 12-string guitar has since occupied roles in certain varieties of folk, rock, jazz, and popular music. Lead Belly's proteg√©, Fred Gerlach, brought the instrument into the folk music world. Initially, it was primarily used for accompaniment, owing to the greater difficulty of picking or executing string \\"bends\\" on its double-strung courses. In the later 20th century, however, a number of players devoted themselves to producing solo performances on the 12-string guitar.The guitarists who so devoted themselves included Leo Kottke, Peter Lang, John McLaughlin, Larry Coryell, and Ralph Towner, among others. The Delta Blues guitar virtuosa Robert Lockwood Jr was presented a handcrafted acoustic 12 string guitar made by an outstanding Japanese luthier in the end of the sixties, and this became the instrument of choice for Mr Lockwood thereafter. =Electric 12-string guitars= A reissue of the 1964 Rickenbacker 360 12 String guitar. Electric 12-strings became a staple in pop and rock music in the 1960s. Early use of the instrument was pioneered by the guitarists of The Wrecking Crew; in 1963, Carol Kaye used a converted Guild six-string on The Crystals' hit \\"Then He Kissed Me,\\" and on Jackie DeShannon's song \\"When You Walk in the Room,\\" Glen Campbell played a well-known guitar figure, composed by DeShannon, on an electric twelve. One of the first mass-produced electric 12-strings was the Bellzouki. Introduced by Danelectro in 1961, from a design by session guitarist Vinnie Bell, it was initially considered a cross between an electric guitar and a bouzouki rather than an electric version on the traditional 12-string guitar. In the UK in 1963, JMI briefly produced the Vox Bouzouki, later produced in Italy as The Vox Tempest XII, which was used by Vic Flick on the Peter and Gordon hit single A World Without Love in 1964. In late 1963, Burns developed the Double Six, supplying a prototype to Hank Marvin of The Shadows, who used it on a number of songs for the soundtrack of the 1964 Cliff Richard movie Wonderful Life; the Double Six was also used on The Searchers' cover version of De Shannon's \\"When You Walk in the Room.\\" Monkees guitarist Michael Nesmith plays his signature model Gretsch Model 6076 The electric 12-string gained prominence with the introduction in 1964 of the Rickenbacker 360, made famous through George Harrison's use of it on The Beatles' album A Hard Day's Night and many subsequent recordings. In 1965, inspired by Harrison, Roger McGuinn made the Rickenbacker 12-string central to The Byrds' folk rock sound, further popularising the instrument. By the mid- Sixties, most major guitar manufacturers were producing competing instruments, including the Fender Electric XII (used by Roy Wood of The Move), and the Vox Phantom XII (used by Tony Hicks of The Hollies). Gretsch, Guild, and Gibson also produced electric 12-string models from the mid-Sixties and following decades, with Gretsch promoting theirs by supplying number of custom made 12-strings for The Monkees guitarist Michael Nesmith, for use on The Monkees TV series. Jimmy Page onstage in Chicago with Led Zeppelin, using the Gibson EDS-1275 double neck guitar. Standard electric 12-strings became less popular with the end of the American folk rock scene in the late sixties; Fender and Gibson ceased production of the Electric XII and ES-335 12-string variant respectively, in 1969. However, from the 1970s, some progressive rock, hard rock, and jazz fusion guitarists, most notably Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, John McLaughlin of The Mahavishnu Orchestra and Alex Lifeson of Rush used double-necked guitars such as the Gibson EDS-1275, with six-string and 12-string necks, for live appearances, allowing easy transition between different sounds mid-song.Simmons, Michael. \\"12-String Power.\\" Acoustic Guitar. November 1997, p. 51 The post punk era of the late 70s and early 80s saw a resurgence of electric 12 string guitar use among sixties-influenced alternative rock, pop, and indie guitarists. Players such as Johnny Marr of The Smiths, Dave Gregory of XTC, Susanna Hoffs of The Bangles, Marty Willson- Piper of The Church, Peter Buck of R.E.M., and Tom Petty and Mike Campbell of the Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers often chose 12 strings (particularly Rickenbackers) for many songs. Design The strings are placed in courses of two strings each that are usually played together. The two strings in each of the lower four courses are normally tuned an octave apart, while each pair of strings in the top two courses are tuned in unison. The strings are generally arranged such that the higher string of each pair is struck first on a downward strum. However, Rickenbacker usually reverses this arrangement on its electric 12-string guitars. The tuning of the second string in the third course (G) varies. Some players use a unison string, while most prefer the distinctive high-pitched, bell-like quality an octave string makes in this position. Another common variant is to tune the octave string in the sixth (lowest) course two octaves above the lower string, rather than one. Some players, either in search of distinctive tone or for ease of playing, remove some doubled strings. For example, removing the higher octave from the three bass courses simplifies playing running bass lines, but keeps the extra treble strings for the full strums. Some manufacturers have produced 9-string instruments based on this setup, in which either the lower three courses are undoubled, or the upper three courses are undoubled. The extra tension placed on the instrument by the doubled strings is high, and because of this additional stress on their necks and soundboards, 12-string guitars long had a reputation for warping after a few years of use. (This is less of a problem in modern instruments, built after 1970.) Until the invention of the truss rod in 1921, 12-string guitars were frequently tuned lower than the traditional EADGBE to reduce the stresses on the instrument. Lead Belly often used a low-C tuning, but in some recordings, his tunings can be recognized as low-B and A tunings.See Julius Lester/Pete Seeger The 12-String Guitar as Played by Leadbelly, Oak Publications, New York, 1965, p. 6. Some 12-string guitars have nontraditional structural supports to prevent or postpone warping, at the expense of appearance and tone. To additionally reduce string tension, 12-string guitars built prior to 1970 typically had shorter necks and scale lengths than six-string guitars, which made frets more closely spaced. Their bridges, especially in acoustic guitars, had a larger reinforcement plate for the same reason. Advances in materials, design, and construction in such guitars made after 1970 have eliminated most of these accommodations. Contemporary 12 string guitars are commonly built to the same dimensions and scale as their six-string counterparts.In his book Steel-String Guitar Construction, artist and luthier Irving Sloane devoted a chapter to the 12-string guitar that did not mention the subsequent advances. Tuning Dave Mustaine of Megadeth playing a Dean twin neck. Note the machine heads for the 12 string secondary strings on the edge of the body. The most common tuning, considered standard today, is , moving from lowest (sixth) course to highest (first) course. Lead Belly and some other players have doubled the lowest course two octaves above instead of one, producing a third string in unison with the top course. Some performers use open tunings and other non-standard guitar tunings on 12-string guitars. Some performers have experimented with tuning the two strings within a course to intervals other than octaves or unisons: jazz guitarists such as Ralph Towner (of Oregon), Larry Coryell, and Philip Catherine have tuned the bass courses of their 12-string guitars to the upper fifths and trebles to the lower fourths instead of octaves and unisons;Whitehill; Alternate Tunings for Guitar; p. 8 Michael Gulezian tuned strings in the top two courses to whole-tone intervals (and possibly some of the other strings an octave lower) to achieve a very rich, complex sound.Whitehill, Dave; Alternate Tunings for Guitar: A Comprehensive Guide for Over 300 Tunings; p. 12. The greater number of strings offers almost endless possibilities. =Nashville tuning= Nashville Tuning refers to a way of simulating a 12-string guitar sound, using two six-string guitars playing in unison. This is achieved by replacing the lower four courses on one six-string with the higher octave strings for those four courses from a 12-string set, and tuning these four strings an octave higher than normal tuning for those courses on a six-string. Double-tracking this guitar with the standard-tuned six-string is commonly used in recording studios to achieve a \\"cleaner\\" 12-string effect. Playing The 12-string guitar's greater number of strings and higher cumulative string tension complicates playing, in both hands. Fretting chords requires greater force, and the width of the neck and the added string tension combine to make soloing and string-bending challenging. The gap between the dual-string courses is usually narrower than that between the single-string courses of a conventional six-string guitar, so more precision is required with the pick or fingertip when not simply strumming chords. Consequently, the instrument is most commonly used for accompaniment, though several players have taken the time to develop the 12-string guitar as a solo instrument. Flat-picking solos are more frequently seen with electric players, whereas a few acoustic players, such as Leo Kottke, have adapted fingerstyle techniques to the instrument; players such as Ralph Towner have applied classical playing techniques.

Its seeds are used as a spice (ground or whole); it imparts a pungent, black-pepper-like flavor with hints of citrus. It is commonly known as grains of paradise, melegueta pepper, alligator pepper, Guinea grains, ossame, or fom wisa. The term Guinea pepper has also been used, but is most often applied to Xylopia aethiopica (grains of Selim). It is native to West Africa, which is sometimes named the Pepper Coast (or Grain Coast) because of this commodity. It is also an important cash crop in the Basketo district (Basketo special woreda) of southern Ethiopia.\\"Southern Nations Nationalities and People‚Äôs Region (SNNPR) Livelihood Profiles: Regional Overview\\" , FEWS Net (January 2005), p. 27 (accessed 18 May 2009) Characteristics Aframomum melegueta is an herbaceous perennial plant native to swampy habitats along the West African coast. Its trumpet-shaped, purple flowers develop into pods long, containing numerous small, reddish- brown seeds. The pungent, peppery taste of the seeds is caused by aromatic ketones, such as (6)-paradol (systematic name: 1-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-decan-3-one). Essential oils, which are the dominating flavor components in the closely related cardamom,Grains of paradise are listed among the varieties of caradmom in the 25th ed. of the Dispensatory of the United States of America (1955) p. 257, as Paul E. Beichner notes in \\"The Grain of Paradise\\", Speculum, vol. 36, no. 2 (April 1961), p. 303. Beichner suggests the miraculous \\"\\" of Chaucer's \\"The Prioress's Tale\\" was grains of paradise. occur only in traces. The stem at times can be short, and usually shows signs of scars and dropped leaves. The leaves average in length and in width, with a well-structured vascular system. The flowers of the herbaceous plant are aromatic, with an orange-colored lip and rich pinkish-orange upper part. The fruits contain numerous, small, golden red-brown seeds. Uses A. melegueta pods at a market in S√£o Jo√£o dos Angolares, S√£o Tom√© Island. Melegueta pepper is commonly used in the cuisines of West and North Africa, from where it has been traditionally transported by camel caravan routes through the Sahara desert and distributed to Sicily and the rest of Italy. Mentioned by Pliny as \\"African pepper\\" but subsequently forgotten in Europe, they were renamed \\"grains of paradise\\" and became a popular substitute for black pepper in Europe in the 14th and 15th centuries.Several medieval recipes are republished in Two Fifteenth-century Cookery-Books, Thomas Austin (ed,) Early English Texts Society, vol. 91 (1888) (cited in passing by Beichner 1961), under the names , , , and simply .Daniel F. Austin, \\"Florida ethnobotany\\", p. 170, CRC Press, 2004, \\"Its popularity may have been due to the brilliant name thought up for it by some advertising genius born before his times\\" observes Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, Anthea Bell (tr.), The History of Food, revised ed., 2009, p. 446. The M√©nagier de Paris recommends it for improving wine that \\"smells stale\\". Through the Middle Ages and into the early modern period, the theory of the four humors governed theories about nourishment on the part of doctors, herbalists, and druggists. In this context, John Russell characterized grains of paradise in The Boke of Nurture as \\"hot and moist\\".Noted, with other examples of fiery and watery grains of paradise, by Beichner 1961, p. 304, note 8; cardamom, with which it was often confused, as Cardamomum maius and Cardamomum minus, was reported by Dioscurides as hot and dry in its qualities, as recorded in the late 13th- century Herbal of Rufinus (Beichner, p. 305f). In 1469, King Afonso V of Portugal granted the monopoly of trade in the Gulf of Guinea to Lisbon merchant Fern√£o Gomes. The included the exclusivity in trade of Aframomum melegueta, then called malagueta pepper. The grant came at the cost of 100,000 annually and agreement to explore of the coast of Africa per year for five years; this gives some indication of the European value of the spice. After Christopher Columbus reached the New World in 1492 and brought the first samples of the chili pepper (Capsicum frutescens) back with him to Europe, the name , and Spanish and Portuguese spelling, was then applied to the new chili \\"pepper\\" because its piquancy was reminiscent of grains of paradise. Malagueta, thanks to its low price, remained popular in Europe even after the Portuguese opened the direct maritime route to the Spice Islands around 1500. This namesake, the malagueta chili, remains popular in Brazil, the Caribbean, Portugal, and Mozambique. The importance of the A. melegueta spice is shown by the designation of the area from the St. John River (near present-day Buchanan) to Harper in Liberia as the Grain Coast or Pepper Coast in honor of the availability of grains of paradise.Laurie's Sailing Directory for the Ethiopic or Southern Atlantic Ocean to the Rio de la Plata, Cape Horn, and the Cape of Good Hope etc., including the Islands between the two coasts; 4th ed., 1855 Later, the craze for the spice waned, and its uses were reduced to a flavoring for sausages and beer. In the 18th century, its importation to Great Britain collapsed after a parliamentary act of George III forbade its use in alcoholic beverages.Kup, Peter; A History of Sierra Leone, 1400‚Äì1787 (Cambridge University) In 1855, England imported about per year legally (duty paid). By the 1880, the 9th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica reported: \\"Grains of paradise are to some extent used in veterinary practice, but for the most part illegally to give a fictitious strength to malt liquors, gin, and cordials\\". The presence of the seeds in the diets of lowland gorillas in the wild seems to have some sort of beneficial effect on their cardiovascular health. They also eat the leaves, and use them for bedding material. The absence of the seeds in the diets of captive lowland gorillas may contribute to their occasionally poor cardiovascular health in zoos.Dybas, Cheryl Lyn; Raskin, Ilya (photographer), \\"Out of Africa: A Tale of Gorillas, Heart Disease ... and a Swamp Plant\\" , BioScience, vol. 57 (May 2007) pp. 392‚Äì397. Today the condiment is sometimes used in gourmet cuisine as a replacement for pepper, and to give unique flavor in some craft beers, gins, and Norwegian . Grains of paradise are starting to enjoy a slight resurgence in popularity in North America due to their use by some well-known chefs. Alton Brown is a fan of the condiment, and he uses it in okra stew and his apple-pie recipe on an episode of the TV cooking show Good Eats.Brown, Alton, \\"Apple of My Pie\\", Good Eats, season 11, episode 15. Grains of paradise are also used by people on certain diets, such as a raw food diet, because they are considered less irritating to digestion than black pepper. Folk medicine and ritual uses In West African folk medicine, grains of paradise are valued for their warming and digestive properties, and among the Efik people in Nigeria have been used for divination and ordeals determining guilt. A. melegueta has been introduced to the Caribbean and Latin America, where it is used in religious (voodoo) rites.

The second book, Scripting with ObjectsKak, A. \\"Scripting with Objects: A Comparative Presentation of Object-Oriented Scripting with Perl and Python\\" John Wiley and Sons (2008) does the same with Perl and Python. The last book of the trilogy is Designing with Objects.Kak, A. \\"Designing with Objects: Object-Oriented Design Patterns Explained with Stories from Harry Potter\\" John Wiley and Sons (2015) Regarding the teaching of programming languages in universities, Kak is critical of programs that start the students off with relatively easier-to-learn languages like Java.https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/TeachingProgramming.pdf https://engineering.purdue.edu/kak/EnsenandoProgramacion.pdf Over the years, Kak has also contributed to several open-source projects.http://search.cpan.org/~avikak/ The software modules developed through these projects are widely used for data analytics and computer security.

It is owned by MGM Growth Properties and operated by MGM Resorts International. History Yonkers Raceway, considered a city landmark, was opened in 1899 by William H. Clark's Empire City Trotting Club. Clark died in 1900 and, with much litigation by his heirs over its proposed sale, the track remained closed for most of the next seven years except for special events. One such event occurred in 1902 when Barney Oldfield set a one-mile (1.6 km) record in an automobile at Empire City Race Track. Driving the Ford '999', he covered the distance in 55.54 seconds. The facility was purchased by New York grocery store magnate James Butler, who reopened it for Thoroughbred horse racing in 1907. Among the notable thoroughbreds who raced at Empire City, in 1936 Seabiscuit won the Scarsdale Handicap. After Butler's death in 1934, the track continued to host \\"the flats\\" until 1942 when it was converted back to being a harness track. Some of its feature races were taken over by other New York area racetracks. =Historic Thoroughbred flat races= *Empire City Handicap (1900‚Äì1953) *Yonkers Handicap (1907-1946) *Whirl Stakes (1908‚Äì1930) *Empire City Derby (1917‚Äì1933) *Scarsdale Handicap (1918‚Äì1947) *Butler Handicap (1935‚Äì1953) *Empire City Gold Cup (1947‚Äì1953) In 1950, William H. Cane, for whom the Cane Pace is named, headed a syndicate formed as the Algam Corporation which acquired Empire City and converted it to Yonkers Raceway. Its popularity having greatly declined since the 1960s (when crowds would occasionally reach 50,000), the entire property, according to some, had become an eyesore due to its owners leaving it in a state of disrepair. In 1972, the Rooney family acquired Yonkers Raceway. It underwent some cosmetic changes in the late 1990s. It was used as a flea market, and hosted the annual Westchester County Fair, sponsored by the county's Parks Department. In 1996, the finish line was relocated to the end of the stretch, increasing the length of the stretch from to the current . The following year, the grandstand was demolished. There was consideration on selling the site to the National Football League Jets that would have included a stadium; however, the plan was shelved after the environmental impact statement showed there would be significant traffic from elsewhere in the metropolitan area, and there was not enough political support for it. In 2015, Yonkers Raceway applied for permission from the New York State Gaming Commission to relocate its finish line back by approximately 100 feet. This proposal was endorsed by the New York division of the Standardbred Owners Association. As of 2018, the new finish line has been in use for a considerable period of time. In January 2018, Yonkers eliminated the \\"passing lane\\" in the stretch that allowed horses to be in the second spot on the inside in the stretch to move inside one spot and come up in the inside. In January 2019, MGM Resorts International bought the racetrack and casino from the Rooney family for $850 million in cash and stock. MGM then immediately sold the land and buildings to its REIT, MGM Growth Properties, for $625 million, leasing back the property and structures for $50 million per year. Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway Empire City Casino with expansion Yonkers Raceway had a $225-million renovation designed by EwingCole to put in more than 7,500 slot machines. The first phase opened on October 11, 2006, with 1,870 machines. Despite a \\"soft opening\\", with no major advertising or promotional campaigns, Yonkers netted $3.8 million in revenue in its first week, outpacing its nearest competitor, Saratoga Casino and Raceway, by two- thirds. The second phase of the project, which opened on December 28, 2006, added of space to bring the total number of slot machines to 4,000. On March 12, 2007, the third phase opened to bring the slot machine total to 5,300. Because the facility falls under state lottery laws, the minimum age to play the slot machines at Empire City is 18, unlike the other area casinos, where it is 21. In a report released in 2012, Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway was the state's \\"most successful casino and racing venue\\". Through 2011, the facility provided more than 3,000 jobs and contributed $262 million in \\"economic output\\". In January 2013, Empire City Casino completed a new $50 million expansion designed by Studio V Architecture that added 66,000 square feet to the casino. The expansion featured a porte-cochere sculptural entrance; the largest window in the Northeast, a 300-foot-long and 27-foot- high depiction of the New York City skyline made entirely of nails; a new gaming floor with nearly 700 slot machines; and two new restaurants. If enhanced casino gaming is approved in New York State, and a full gaming license is secured by Empire City Casino, it intends to invest more than $310 million to build a 400-room hotel, 5,000-seat multi-use arena, and a 2,500-space parking garage and more. It is estimated that this would ‚Äúgive a $572 million jolt to the local economy and create 2,979 jobs.‚Äù As of 2015, the casino hosts blackjack, craps, roulette, and baccarat tables in addition to the slot machines. The games are fully automated. The casino has hosted an annual Ice Bucket Challenge event each year since 2014, reaching the fifth year running in 2018. Restaurants Dan Rooney's Caf√© & Bar *Dan Rooney's Caf√© & Bar: The first restaurant to open in Empire City Casino's $50 million expansion is an Irish Pub styled after the original Dan Rooney‚Äôs Caf√© & Bar which was established in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s by the Rooney family. The train car dining room hosts 35 flat-screen televisions and nightly dueling pianos. ‚ÄúTwo-time Michelin star winner and local New Yorker, Chef Christopher Lee‚Äù created the pub's menu which contains a burger that won the Greenwich Food & Wine Festival Burger Battle in 2012. *Pinch: The second restaurant in Empire City Casino's expansion, Pinch, was created by Ducasse Studio, the consulting service of the ‚ÄúFrench chef and culinary impresario‚Äù, Alain Ducasse. The name, Pinch, is ‚Äúa playful take on pintxo (pronounced PEEN-cho), a type of Basque tapa, as well as a hint that the menu mixes a bit of this and a bit of that.‚Äù Pinch seats 250 people and has an international menu. *Alley 810: A Craft cocktail lounge, opening in 2013, that will have two bowling lanes. *Nonno's Trattoria: A staple of Empire City, Nonno's Trattoria is a classic Italian Restaurant. :Empire Terrace: A restaurant the overlooks the racetrack, allowing gamblers to dine while watching live races. Feature stakes races =History= Racers on Yonkers Racetrack Yonkers used to be the site of the Cane Pace, one of the legs of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers. It is now the host track for another leg, the Messenger Stakes. Yonkers is also home to the Yonkers Trot, one of the legs of the Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters. Due to the renovations at Yonkers, the Messenger and Yonkers Trot were moved to different racetracks for the 2004 and 2005 editions. The Messenger was moved to Harrington Raceway in Delaware in both years, and the Yonkers Trot was moved to Hawthorne Race Course in Stickney, IL in 2004, and Freehold Raceway in New Jersey in 2005. Yonkers Raceway ran the Yonkers Trot and the Messenger on November 25, 2006, becoming the first harness track in America to host two Triple Crown races on the same day. Glidemaster, by virtue of winning the $728,000 Yonkers Trot, became the eighth horse to clinch the Trotting Triple Crown; the trotter would go on to be named 2006 Harness Horse of the Year. Yonkers Raceway is also home to the Art Rooney Pace for three-year-olds. However, continued delays in the reopening of the track forced the 2006 edition of the race to be moved to Monticello Raceway. The final of the 2007 Art Rooney Pace, run on June 2, 2007, was the richest race in Yonkers history, with a $1 million purse. It was won by Southwind Lynx, driven by Tim Tetrick, with a late outside run in 1:52 3/5. The current track record for a trotting race horse is 1:54 3/5 set by Shutter Boy on October 30, 2009, with the trainer John McDermott and driver Yannick Gingras; this was not a stakes race. =Notable stakes races= * George Morton Levy Memorial Pacing Series * Blue Chip Matchmaker * Art Rooney Pace * Lawrence B.

Ciutat Vella (, meaning in English \\"Old City\\") is a district of Barcelona, numbered District 1. The name means \\"old city\\" in Catalan and refers to the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. Ciutat Vella is nestled between the Mediterranean Sea and the neighborhood called l'Eixample (\\"the Extension\\"). It is considered the centre of the city; the Pla√ßa Catalunya is one of the most popular meeting points in all of Catalonia. There are four administrative neighborhoods (some of them include former or traditional neighborhoods): *La Barceloneta *El G√≤tic *El Raval *Sant Pere, Santa Caterina i la Ribera: **Sant Pere **Santa Caterina **La Ribera Les Rambles Running down the center of the Ciutat Vella (dividing the Raval and Barri G√≤tic) are the boulevards Les Rambles, popularly known as La Rambla (in singular) since they are continuous, like a single street. Les Rambles stretches from Pla√ßa Catalunya to the Mediterranean Sea and, since the 1990s, now extends out over the sea into one of Barcelona's newest centers of entertainment, Marem√†gnum. Each of Les Rambles has its own specialty. La Rambla de les Flors (The Flowers Rambla) is devoted to flower stands, another Rambla to animal vendors (selling mainly birds), and the lowest Rambla hosts temporary art fairs. El Mercat de Sant Josep (more commonly known as La Boqueria) and Gran Teatre del Liceu (Barcelona's Opera House) are both located here. Les Rambles are among the most frequently travelled streets by pedestrians in Barcelona. At the bottom, there is the Museu Mar√≠tim (naval museum), which chronicles the history of life on the Mediterranean, including a full-scale model of a galley. The museum is housed in the medieval Drassanes (shipyards), where the ships that made Catalonia a great sea power in the Mediterranean were built. Raval This portion of the city is often referred to as el Barri Xin√®s, or Chinatown. It acquired this name not due to there being residents of Chinese origin, but because it was how a Chinese city was imagined to be. Due to its previous reputation as a dangerous neighborhood, the local government has invested there, including the creation of a walkway to the sea, the Rambla del Raval and building development, including the new Filmoteca de Catalunya. It has become one of the most dynamic areas of the city. Many smaller ethnic restaurants may be found in Raval and fashionable restaurants and caf√©s have been opening up. The Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona (Contemporary Art Museum of Barcelona) is in this neighborhood. Barri G√≤tic On the other side of Les Rambles, is '. This neighborhood houses the Cathedral of Barcelona, the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, and lAjuntament de Barcelona (Barcelona city hall). Tourists visit this neighborhood to see ' (a Spanish-style plaza) and to shop in one of the tourist shops along '. The Museu Picasso can be found in the area known as el Born, within the Barri G√≥tic, in addition to the historic restaurant Els Quatre Gats (The Four Cats), which was a popular hang-out for artists, including Pablo Picasso. To the north of the Gothic Quarter lie the Jardins de Fonser√© i Mestre which contain modernist buildings housing zoological and geological collections. The adjacent ' includes both the ' (Catalan Parliament) and the (zoo) whose most famous resident was an albino gorilla, Floquet de Neu (\\"Snowflake\\"), who died in 2003 of skin cancer.

It lies in the Kashmir Valley on the banks of the Jhelum River, a tributary of the Indus, and Dal and Anchar lakes. The city is known for its natural environment, gardens, waterfronts and houseboats. It is also known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts like Kashmir shawls and also dried fruits. It is the northernmost city of India with over one million people.  Origin of name  Currently, the name is commonly misconstrued as coming from Sanskrit ≈õrƒ´ (\\"auspicious, wealthy, venerable\\") and nagara (\\"city\\"), which would make it the \\"Auspicious City\\". However, the earliest records, such as Kalhana's Rajatarangini, the name siri-nagara is mentioned, which corresponds to the Sanskrit s≈´rya-nagar, meaning \\"City of the Sun\\".M. Monier Monier‚ÄìWilliams, \\"≈örƒ´nagar\\", in: The Great Sanskrit‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1899 This is further corroborated by the records of the Chinese Tang Dynasty which use the name sri-nagar as well as by the modern pronunciation which has retained the original sound /s/. History = Ancient period = The Burzahom archaeological site 10 km from Srinagar has revealed the presence of neolithic and megalithic cultures. According to Kalhana's 12th century text Rajatarangini, a king named Pravarasena II established a new capital named Pravarapura (also known as Pravarasena-pura). Based on topographical details, Pravarapura appears to be same as the modern city of Srinagar. Aurel Stein dates the king to 6th century. Pravarasena, supposed founder of Srinagar. Circa 6th-early 7th century CE Kalhana mentions that a king named Ashoka (Gonandiya) had earlier established a town called Srinagari. Kalhana describes this town in hyperbolic terms, stating that it had \\"9,600,000 houses resplendent with wealth\\". According to Kalhana, this Ashoka reigned before 1182 BCE and was a member of the dynasty founded by Godhara. Kalhana states that this king adopted the doctrine of Jina, constructed stupas and Shiva temples, and appeased Bhutesha (Shiva) to obtain his son Jalauka. Multiple scholars identify Kalhana's Ashoka with the 3rd century Buddhist Mauryan emperor Ashoka despite these discrepancies. Although \\"Jina\\" is a term generally associated with Jainism, some ancient sources use it to refer to the Buddha. Romila Thapar equates Jalauka to Kunala, stating that \\"Jalauka\\" is an erroneous spelling caused by a typographical error in Brahmi script. Ashoka's Srinagari is generally identified with Pandrethan (near present-day Srinagar), although there is an alternative identification with a place on the banks of the Lidder River. According to Kalhana, Pravarasena II resided at Puranadhishthana (\\"old town\\") before the establishment of Pravarapura; the name Pandrethan is believed to be derived from that word. Accordining to V. A. Smith, the original name of the \\"old town\\" (Srinagari) was transferred to the new town. =Srinagar in 14th to 19th centuries= Coin of Maharaja Gulab Singh, minted in Srinagar, dated 1849 Srinagar and Environ map 1911 The independent Hindu and Buddhist rule of Srinagar lasted until the 14th century when the Kashmir valley, including the city, came under the control of the first of several Muslim rulers, including the Mughals. It was also the capital during the reign of Yusuf Shah Chak. Kashmir came under Mughal rule, when it was conquered by the third Mughal badshah (emperor) Akbar in 1586 CE. Akbar established Mughal rule in Srinagar and Kashmir valley. Kashmir was added to Kabul Subah in 1586, until Shah Jahan made it into a separate Kashmir Subah (imperial top-level province) with seat in Srinagar. With the disintegration of the Mughal empire after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, infiltration in the valley of the Afghan tribes from Afghanistan and Hindu Dogras from the Jammu region increased, and the Afghan Durrani Empire and Dogras ruled the city for several decades. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler from the Punjab region annexed a major part of the Kashmir Valley, including Srinagar, to his kingdom in the year 1814 and the city came under the influence of the Sikhs. In 1846, the Treaty of Lahore was signed between the Sikh rulers and the British in Lahore. The treaty inter alia provided British de facto suzerainty over the Kashmir Valley and Maharaja Gulab Singh, a Hindu Dogra from the Jammu region became a semi-independent ruler of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Srinagar became part of his kingdom and remained until 1947 as one of several princely states in British India. The Maharajas choose Sher Garhi Palace as their main Srinagar residence. =Post independence= Srinagar city and its vicinity in 1959 After India and Pakistan's independence from Britain, villagers around the city of Poonch began an armed protest at the continued rule of Maharaja Hari Singh on 17 August 1947. In view of the Poonch uprising, certain Pashtun tribes such as the Mehsuds and Afridis from the mountainous region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan, with the backing of the Pakistani government, entered the Kashmir valley to capture it on 22 October 1947.The Story of Kashmir Affairs ‚Äì A Peep into the Past The Maharaja, who had refused to accede to either India or Pakistan in hopes of securing his own independent state, signed the Instrument of Accession to India in exchange for refuge on 26 October 1947, as Pakistani- backed tribesmen approached the outskirts of Srinagar. The accession was accepted by India the next day. The government of India immediately airlifted Indian Army troops to Srinagar, who engaged the tribesmen and prevented them from reaching the city. In 1989, Srinagar became the focus of the insurgency against Indian rule. The area continues to be a highly politicised hotbed of separatist activity with frequent spontaneous protests and strikes (\\"bandhs\\" in local parlance). On 19 January 1990, the Gawakadal massacre of at least 50 unarmed protestors by Indian forces, and up to 280 by some estimates from eyewitness accounts, set the stage for bomb blasts, shootouts, and curfews that characterised Srinagar throughout the early and mid-1990s.Dalrymple, William. Kashmir: The Scarred and the Beautiful . \\"The New York Review of Books.\\" 1 May 2008. Further massacres in the spring of 1990 in which 51 allegedly unarmed protesters were allegedly killed by Indian security forces in Zakura and Tengpora heightened anti-Indian sentiments in Srinagar. As a result, bunkers and checkpoints are found throughout the city, although their numbers have come down in the past few years as militancy has declined. However, frequent protests still occur against Indian rule, such as the 22 August 2008 rally in which hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri civilians protested against Indian rule in Srinagar. Similar protests took place every summer for the next 4 years. In 2010 alone 120 protesters, many of whom were stone pelters and arsonists, were killed by police and CRPF. Large scale protests were seen following the execution of Afzal Guru in February 2013. In 2016, after the death of militant leader Burhan Wani, there were mass protests in the valley and about 87 protesters were killed by Indian Army, CRPF and police in the 2016 Kashmir unrest. The city also saw increased violence against minorities, particularly the Hindu Kashmiri Pandits, starting from mid-1980s and resulting in their ultimate exodus. Posters were pasted to walls of houses of Pandits, telling them to leave or die, temples were destroyed and houses burnt; but a very small minority of pandits still remains in the city. In 2015 protests in Srinagar from local Kashmiri pandits were held in order to express demands from the government related to their official status, temples, and the ability a temple in Pakistani-administered Kashmir. After revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and the subsequent devolution of the state into a union territory in August 2019, a lockdown was imposed in Kashmir, including in Srinagar. This lockdown has been ongoing for over a year. Thousands, including two former chief ministers, were arrested during this lockdown. Geography Map of Kashmir showing various geographic regions The city is located on both the sides of the Jhelum River, which is called Vyath in Kashmir. The river passes through the city and meanders through the valley, moving onward and deepening in the Wular Lake. The city is known for its nine old bridges, connecting the two parts of the city. There are a number of lakes and swamps in and around the city. These include the Dal, the Nigeen, the Anchar, Khushal Sar, Gil Sar and Hokersar. Hokersar is a wetland situated near Srinagar. Thousands of migratory birds come to Hokersar from Siberia and other regions in the winter season. Migratory birds from Siberia and Central Asia use wetlands in Kashmir as their transitory camps between September and October and again around spring. These wetlands play a vital role in sustaining a large population of wintering, staging and breeding birds. Hokersar is north of Srinagar, and is a world class wetland spread over including lake and marshy area. It is the most accessible and well-known of Kashmir's wetlands which include Hygam, Shalibug and Mirgund. A record number of migratory birds have visited Hokersar in recent years. Birds found in Hokersar are migratory ducks and geese which include brahminy duck, tufted duck, gadwall, garganey, greylag goose, mallard, common merganser, northern pintail, common pochard, ferruginous pochard, red-crested pochard, ruddy shelduck, northern shoveller, common teal, and Eurasian wigeon. Climate Srinagar has a humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cfa). The valley is surrounded by the Himalayas on all sides. Winters are cool, with daytime temperature averaging to , and drops below freezing point at night. Moderate to heavy snowfall occurs in winter and the highway connecting Srinagar with the rest of India faces frequent blockades due to icy roads and avalanches. Summers are warm with a July daytime average of . The average annual rainfall is around . Spring is the wettest season while autumn is the driest. The highest temperature reliably recorded is and the lowest is . Economy Mar Canal in Srinagar In November 2011, the City Mayors Foundationan advocacy think tankannounced that Srinagar was the 92nd fastest growing urban areas in the world in terms of economic growth, based on actual data from 2006 onwards and projections to 2020. =Tourism= Srinagar is one of several places that have been called the \\"Venice of the East\\". Lakes around the city include Dal Lakenoted for its houseboats and Nigeen Lake. Apart from Dal Lake and Nigeen Lake, Wular Lake and Manasbal Lake both lie to the north of Srinagar. Wular Lake is one of the largest fresh water lakes in Asia. Srinagar has some Mughal gardens, forming a part of those laid by the Mughal emperors across the Indian subcontinent. Those of Srinagar and its close vicinity include Chashma Shahi (the royal fountains); Pari Mahal (the palace of the fairies); Nishat Bagh (the garden of spring); Shalimar Bagh; the Naseem Bagh. Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Botanical Garden is a botanical garden in the city, set up in 1969. The Indian government has included these gardens under \\"Mughal Gardens of Jammu and Kashmir\\" in the tentative list for sites to be included in world Heritage sites. The Sher Garhi Palace houses administrative buildings from the state government. Another palace of the Maharajas, the Gulab Bhavan, has now become the Lalit Grand Palace hotel. The Shankaracharya Temple which lies on a hill top in the middle of the city, besides the Kheer Bhawani Temple are important Hindu temples in the city.

Officials estimate that 100,000 stray dogs roam the streets of the city, which has a human population of just under 900,000. In a survey conducted by an NGO, it was found that some residents welcomed this program, saying the city was overrun by dogs, while critics contended that more humane methods should be used to deal with the animals. The situation has become alarming with local news reports coming up at frequent intervals highlighting people, especially children being mauled by street dogs. Demographics As of 2011 census Srinagar urban agglomeration had 1,273,312 population. Both the city and the urban agglomeration has average literacy rate of approximately 70%. The child population of both the city and the urban agglomeration is approximately 12% of the total population. Males constituted 53.0% and females 47% of the population. The sex ratio in the city area is 888 females per 1000 males, whereas in the urban agglomeration it is 880 per 1,000.

The railway track also connects to Banihal across the Pir Panjal mountains through a newly constructed 11 km long Banihal tunnel, and subsequently to the Indian railway network after a few years. It takes approximately 9 minutes and 30 seconds for a train to cross the tunnel. It is the longest rail tunnel in India. This railway system, proposed in 2001, is not expected to connect the Indian railway network until 2017 at the earliest, with a cost overrun of 55 billion INR. The train also runs during heavy snow. There are proposals to develop a metro system in the city. The feasibility report for the Srinagar Metro is planned to be carried out by Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. =Cable car= In December 2013, the 594m cable car allowing people to travel to the shrine of the Sufi saint Hamza Makhdoom on Hari Parbat was unveiled. The project is run by the Jammu and Kashmir Cable Car Corporation (JKCCC), and has been envisioned for 25 years. An investment of 300 million INR was made, and it is the second cable car in Kashmir after the Gulmarg Gondola. =Boat= Whilst popular since the 7th century, water transport is now mainly confined to Dal Lake, where shikaras (wooden boats) are used for local transport and tourism. There are efforts to revive transportation on the River Jhelum. Culture Like the territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Srinagar too has a distinctive blend of cultural heritage. Holy places in and around the city depict the historical cultural and religious diversity of the city as well as the Kashmir valley. =Places of worship= There are many religious holy places in Srinagar. They include: * Hazratbal Shrine, only domed mosque in the city. * Jama Masjid, Srinagar, one of the oldest mosques in Kashmir * Khanqah-e-Moula, first Islamic centre in Kashmir * Aali Masjid, in Eidgah Locality * Hari Parbat hill hosts shrine of Sharika Mata temple * Zeashta Devi Shrine a holy shrine for Kashmiri Hindus * Shankaracharya temple * Kheer Bhawani Temple * Gurdwara Chatti Patshahi, located on Hari Parbat * Pathar Masjid * All Saints Church, Srinagar * Holy Family Catholic Church (Srinagar) Additional structures include the Dastgeer Sahib shrine, Mazar-e-Shuhada, Roza Bal shrine, Khanqah of Shah Hamadan, Pathar Masjid (\\"The Stone Mosque\\"), Hamza Makhdoom shrine, tomb of the mother of Zain-ul-abidin, tomb of Pir Haji Muhammad, Akhun Mulla Shah Mosque, cemetery of Baha-ud-din Sahib, tomb and Madin Sahib Mosque at Zadibal. The Sheikh Bagh Cemetery is a Christian cemetery located in Srinagar that dates from the British colonial era. The oldest grave in the cemetery is that of a British colonel from the 9th Lancers of 1850 and the cemetery is valued for the variety of persons buried there which provides an insight into the perils faced by British colonisers in India.

Emily Tubman was instrumental in the manumission of enslaved African Americans and paying for their transportation to Liberia for \\"repatriation.\\" Initially, she had great difficulty freeing her slaves in ante-bellum Georgia. Despite appeals to the Georgia State Legislature and financial donations to the University of Georgia, her efforts to manumit numerous slaves were disapproved. Since the Nat Turner Slave Rebellion in 1831, the state legislature had greatly restricted manumissions, requiring a legislative act for each, and posting of expensive bonds by the owner to guarantee the free black would leave the state within a short period of time. Tubman sought the help of her friend and mentor, Henry Clay of Kentucky, president of the American Colonization Society. This organization, made up of both abolitionists and slaveholders, had proposed colonization in Africa as a solution for freedmen, rather than allowing them to remain in the United States. Their presence was considered to unsettle slaves in the South, and in both the North and South, lower-class whites resented competing with them for jobs. Clay assured her that sending her former slaves to Liberia would be a safe and suitable option.

Elective office Having joined the True Whig Party (TWP), the dominant party of Liberia since 1878, Tubman began his career in politics.

He resigned from the Senate in 1931 to defend Liberia before the League of Nations amid allegations that his country was using slave labor. Tubman was reelected to the national legislature in 1934; he resigned in 1937 after being appointed by President Edwin Barclay as associate justice of the Supreme Court of Liberia, where he served until 1943. An official biography speculates that Barclay appointed Tubman to the Liberian Supreme Court to remove him as a competitor for the presidency. President of Liberia In December 1942, Liberia had to elect a successor to President Edwin Barclay. Six candidates ran for office; the two favorites were Tubman and Foreign Minister Clarence L. Simpson. Tubman was elected president on May 4, 1943, at the age of 48, and was inaugurated January 3, 1944. While the United States, its ally, began to base military operations in the country after it entered World War II, Liberia did not declare war on Germany and Japan until January 27, 1944.Hecking, Hans-Peter. \\"La situation des droits de l'homme au Lib√©ria : un r√™ve de libert√©.\\" p.6. www.missio-hilft.de. \\"The Situation of Human Rights in Liberia: A Dream of Freedom.\\" Google Translate.

Between 1944 and 1970, the value of foreign investments, mainly from the United States, increased by 200%. From 1950 to 1960, Liberia experienced an average annual growth of 11.5%. With the expansion of the economy, Tubman gained revenues for the government to construct and modernize infrastructure: the streets of Monrovia were paved, a public sanitation system was installed, hospitals were built, and a literacy program was launched in 1948.Rapport de l'Unesco sur l'alphab√©tisation (1965-1967) p.28 www.unesdoc.unesco.org.(french) Retrieved November 20, 2013.\\"Literacy, 1965-1967\\", United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 1968, p. 28 During Tubman's administration, several thousand kilometers of roads were built, as was a railway line to connect the iron mines to the coast for transport of this commodity for export. During this period, he transformed the Port of Monrovia into a free port to encourage trade. By early 1960, Liberia began to enjoy its first era of prosperity, thanks in part to Tubman's policies and implementation of development. It was during this time that Tubman became regarded as a pro- Western, stabilizing influence in West Africa, at a period when other countries were achieving independence‚Äîoften amid violence. During the 1960s, Tubman was courted by many Western politicians, notably U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson. In the past, the bulk of Liberia‚Äôs production depended on rubber. But with the modernization of the state‚Äôs infrastructure at the hands of Tubman, Liberia started to use its other national resources. Several Americo- Liberian nationalities, German, and Swedish companies became involved in the exploitation of iron mines‚Äîmaking Liberia the first source of iron in Africa, and the fourth worldwide. Tubman wanted to diversify the economy, rather than basing it on rubber and iron resources, which made up 90% of the country‚Äôs exports. He encouraged the development of coffee plantations, palm oil, sugar cane, and especially rice cultivation in 1966 (with the help of Taiwan). In his personal life, Tubman courted Amy Ashwood Garvey, and had a long-term relationship with her.Amy Ashwood Garvey, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography =Authoritarian regime= After a gunman attempted to assassinate Tubman in 1955, he brutally repressed the political opposition. This so-called assassination attempt was widely believed to have been staged by Tubman in order to go after his political enemies, including the Coleman family. His administration was considered increasingly authoritarian. The nation's constitution did not have term limits, and Tubman did not volunteer to leave office. He controlled the dominant political party and had created a wide network of obligations through patronage appointments. Legacy Tubman is best known for his policies of National Unification and the economic Open Door. He tried to reconcile the interests of the native tribes with those of the Americo-Liberian elite, and increased foreign investment in Liberia to stimulate economic growth. During the 1950s, Liberia had the second-highest rate of economic growth in the world. By the time of his death in 1971, Liberia had the largest mercantile fleet in the world, the world's largest rubber industry, was the third-largest exporter of iron ore in the world, and had attracted more than US$1 billion in foreign investment.

Rockefeller was a son of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. As an entrepreneur in Arkansas, he financed many local projects, including a number of new medical clinics in poorer areas, before being elected state governor in 1966, as the first Republican governor of Arkansas since Reconstruction. Despite accusations of lacking insight into the concerns of low-income voters, Rockefeller was re-elected in 1968, and went on to complete the controversial integration of Arkansas schools. Early life Winthrop Rockefeller was born in New York, to philanthropists John Davison Rockefeller Jr. (1874‚Äì1960) and Abigail Greene \\"Abby\\" Aldrich (1874‚Äì1948). He had one elder sister named Abby, three elder brothers John III, Nelson, and Laurance, and a younger brother named David. Nelson served as Governor of New York and Vice President of the United States under Gerald Ford. Winthrop attended Yale University (1931‚Äì34) but was ejected as a result of misbehavior before earning his degree. Prior to attending Yale, he graduated from the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor, Connecticut. In early 1941, he enlisted in the Army. As a soldier of the 77th Infantry Division, he fought in World War II, advancing from Private to Lieutenant Colonel. He earned a Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Clusters and a Purple Heart for his actions aboard the troopship USS Henrico, after a kamikaze attack during the invasion of Okinawa. His image appears in the Infantry Officer Hall of Fame at Fort Benning, Georgia. Political career =Move to Arkansas= Rockefeller moved to central Arkansas in 1953 and established Winrock Enterprises and Winrock Farms atop Petit Jean Mountain near Morrilton in Conway County. In 1954, Republican Pratt C. Remmel polled 37 percent of the vote in the gubernatorial general election against Democrat Orval Faubus. It was a good showing for a Republican candidate in Arkansas, compared to previous races in the 1940s and early 1950s. Twelve years later, Rockefeller would build upon Remmel's race and win the governorship for the Republican Party. In 1955, Faubus appointed Rockefeller chairman of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission (AIDC). Rockefeller initiated a number of philanthropies and projects. He financed the building of a model school at Morrilton and led efforts to establish a Fine Arts Center in the capital city of Little Rock. He also financed the construction of medical clinics in some of the state's poorest counties, in addition to making annual gifts to the state's colleges and universities. These philanthropic activities continue to this day through the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation. =First campaigns= In 1960, Rockefeller did not seek the governorship but instead raised funds for the Republican nominee, Henry M. Britt, a conservative lawyer from Hot Springs, the seat of Garland County. Britt lost in every county and barely polled 30 percent of the statewide vote in his loss to Faubus. In 1961, Rockefeller was named Arkansas Republican national committeeman, having succeeded Wallace Townsend, a lawyer in Little Rock who had held the position since 1928. In 1962, Rockefeller supported Willis Ricketts, another in a long line of failed Republican candidates who sought to topple Faubus. He also supported a slate of Republican legislative candidates. Soon, he quarreled with state Republican party chairman William L. Spicer of Fort Smith over the direction of the party. Spicer favored a stronger conservative approach compared to Rockefeller's moderate-to-liberal outlook. Rockefeller resigned his position with the AIDC and conducted his first campaign for governor in 1964 against Faubus. His campaign was ultimately unsuccessful, but Rockefeller energized and reformed the tiny Republican Party to set the stage for the future. In 1964, Osro Cobb, a Republican former state chairman who had also served as United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas, refused to endorse Rockefeller but openly endorsed Faubus, who subsequently gave Cobb a temporary appointment to the Arkansas Supreme Court. In his memoirs, Cobb recalls that Rockefeller > had used ruthless tactics to convert the fine Republican state organization > into a one-man Rockefeller machine, loyal not to party but to Rockefeller > personally. In rapid succession, Mr. Rockefeller captiously took over most > of the functions of the state chairman and in a matter of months succeeded > in taking over and exercising absolute right of dictation as to each and > every important party function at the state level.

Certainly the > fact that he is the Republican nominee has not been included. The evidence > simply is unanswerable that Mr. Rockefeller is working for his own personal > interest to the exclusion of all other considerations, which leaves the > Republican Party in Arkansas hanging precariously at the whims of one > individual ... .Osro Cobb, Osro Cobb of Arkansas:Memoirs of Significance, > Carol Griffee, ed. (Little Rock, Arkansas: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), > pp. 140‚Äì141. =Election of 1966= When Rockefeller made his second run in the 1966 election, only 11 percent of Arkansans considered themselves Republicans. But Arkansans had tired of Faubus after six terms as governor and as head of the Democratic \\"machine\\". Democrats themselves seemed to be more interested in the reforms that Rockefeller offered in his campaign than \\"winning another one for the party\\". An odd coalition of Republicans and Democratic reform voters catapulted Rockefeller into the governor's office, as he defeated a segregationist Democratic former Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, James D. Johnson of Conway in Faulkner County, who preferred the appellation \\"Justice Jim\\".Coincidentally, Rockefeller resided in Conway County and Johnson had relocated to Conway in Faulkner County. Former state Republican chairman Osro Cobb reversed himself in 1966 and endorsed Rockefeller. He explains: > Arkansas Republicans were eager to work with Winthrop Rockefeller on another > race for governor if he could be led to run as a true Republican to help > build the party in the state.

His > service contributed greatly to the enormous benefits of two-party government > in Arkansas.Cobb, pp. 143‚Äì144 In a surprise, Maurice L. Britt, a decorated World War II veteran and former professional football player, the Republican nominee for lieutenant governor, was narrowly elected to the second-ranking post over the Democrat James Pilkington of Hope, Arkansas. Other Rockefeller running-mates, such as former Democratic State Representative Jerry Thomasson of Arkadelphia, who sought the office of attorney general in 1966 and 1968, and Leona Troxell of Rose Bud in White County, who ran for state treasurer in 1968, were defeated. Only three Republicans won election to the 100-member Arkansas House of Representatives at the time of Rockefeller's first victory: George E. Nowotny, of Fort Smith, Danny Patrick of Madison County, and Jim Sheets of Siloam Springs in Benton County. Another Republican representative, Marshall Chrisman of Ozark in Franklin County, served in the state House from 1969 to 1970. Two Republicans ran for U.S. Representative on the Rockefeller ticket in 1966. John Paul Hammerschmidt, the outgoing party chairman, won in the northwestern Third District. Lynn Lowe, a Texarkana farmer, who later served as party chairman from 1974‚Äì1980, lost in the southern Fourth District race to the Democrat David Pryor. At the time Winthrop became governor, his brother Nelson Rockefeller had been the governor of New York since 1959, and remained so throughout Winthrop's four years in office. They are often erroneously cited as the first two brothers to be governors at the same time, but they were actually the third case; the previous instances were Levi and Enoch Lincoln from 1827 to 1829, and John and William Bigler from 1852 to 1855. More recently, George W. and Jeb Bush were both governors from 1999 to 2000. At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Winthrop Rockefeller received backing from members of the Arkansas delegation as a \\"favorite son\\" presidential candidate. He received all of his state's 18 votes; his brother Nelson, then concluding a major presidential bid against Richard M. Nixon, received 277. This was the only time in the 20th century that the names of two brothers were placed into nomination at the same time. =Governor of Arkansas= The Rockefeller administration enthusiastically embarked on a series of reforms but faced a hostile Democratic legislature. Rockefeller endured a number of personal attacks and a concerted whispering campaign regarding his personal life. Scholars Diane Blair and Jay L. Barth continue: \\"As long as Rockefeller led the Arkansas Republicans, the party had a progressive, reformist cast, and those whom Rockefeller had brought into the party continued to dominate party offices and shape presidential preferences until 1980,\\"Diane Divers Blair (1938-2000) and Jay L. Barth (born 1939), Arkansas Government and Politics, 2nd ed. (Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, 2005), p. 71. when the nomination and election of Ronald Reagan of California as president and Frank D. White as governor moved power within the state GOP \\"sharply to the right.\\"Blair and Barth, Arkansas Politics and Government, p. 71. Ultimately the growth of the Republican Party was slower in Arkansas than in the other southern states in the post-segregation era. Blair and Barth attribute sluggish GOP development to \\"tradition, [which] is important to rural people. They are looking for ways to stay with the Democratic Party; they have to be run off.\\"Blair and Barth, p. 340. According to his biographer, Cathy Kunzinger Urwin, Rockefeller's \\"good-government\\" reform proposals included: revision of the Arkansas State Constitution, governmental administrative reorganization, election law reform (a \\"little Hatch Act\\" to prohibit state employees from engaging in political activities on the job), teacher tenure, taxpayer-funded kindergarten under Amendment 53, adult and continuing education programs, rehabilitation and vocational training in the corrections system, and the recurring attempts at industrial recruitment.Cathy Kunzinger Urwin, Agenda for Reform : Winthrop Rockefeller as Governor of Arkansas, 1967-71 (Fayetteville: University of Arkansas Press, 1991), p. 110. One of Rockefeller's most publicized \\"good-government\\" reforms was the ending of illegal gambling in the resort city of Hot Springs. He also made headway in streamlining state government and secured passage of a state minimum-wage law.Urwin, p. 112. Urwin determined that Rockefeller's negatives created public perceptions of \\"his personal flaws, rather than his accomplishments or lack of them, as governor.\\"Urwin, p. 110 Considered a weak administrator, he depended too heavily on staff, so improperly managed that the employees often failed to answer mail. He was habitually tardy to meetings. A special legislative session in May 1968 was particularly disastrous.Urwin, pp. 110‚Äì111 An Oliver Quayle poll in 1968 declared that Rockefeller seemed \\"strange, alien, and foreign\\" to many voters. The poll maintained that many thought Rockefeller sought too much power, that he drank too much, and that he spent too little time in his office. A majority said that the wealthy Rockefeller, despite his interest in \\"good government,\\" could not understand the problems of common people on restricted incomes or those in the middle class with limited investment opportunities.Randy Sanders, Mighty Peculiar Elections: The News South Gubernatorial Campaigns of 1970 and the Changing Politics of Race (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2002), p. 41 Rockefeller had a particular interest in the reform of the Arkansas prison system. Soon after his election he had received a shocking report from the Arkansas State Police on the brutal conditions within the prison system. He decried the \\"lack of righteous indignation\\" about the situation and created a new Department of Corrections. He appointed a new warden, academic Tom Murton, the first professional penologist that the state had ever retained in that capacity. However, he fired Murton less than a year later, when Murton's aggressive attempts to expose decades of corruption in the system subjected Arkansas to nationwide contempt. Rockefeller also focused on the state's lackluster educational system and proposed funding increases for new buildings and teacher salaries when the legislature allowed. In 1967, Rockefeller named an FBI agent, Lynn A. Davis, to head the state police with orders to halt illegal gambling in Hot Springs. After sensational raids against the mobsters, Davis was forced out as police director 128 days later when the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that he did not meet the strict 10-year residency requirement for the appointment. Democratic lawmakers refused to change the rule to allow Davis to serve. The Hot Springs raids were the No. 1 news story in Arkansas in 1967 as determined by the Associated Press.The New York Times, January 9, 28, 1968John L. Ward, The Arkansas Rockefeller, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1978, pp. 104‚Äì105. Rockefeller won re-election in November 1968, having defeated Marion H. Crank, a state legislator from Foreman in Little River County, who had won the Democratic nomination in a heated fight with Virginia Morris Johnson, wife of Jim Johnson and the first woman ever to seek the office of governor of Arkansas. Newly reelected, Rockefeller proposed tax increases to fund additional reforms and his second term began on January 14, 1969. Rockefeller and the legislature dueled with competing public- relations campaigns and Rockefeller's plan ultimately collapsed in the face of public indifference. With Rockefeller's reelection, the Republicans won a rare seat in the Arkansas State Senate with the election of Jim R. Caldwell of Rogers in northwestern Arkansas.After his political career ended in 1979, Caldwell, a Church of Christ minister, moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Throughout the Rockefeller administration, the state Republican Party chairman was the attorney Odell Pollard of Searcy in White County, who once said that he and Rockefeller agreed on everything. Much of Rockefeller's second term was spent in conflict with the opposition legislature. In 1969, he told the lawmakers that his reelection the previous November had meant that a slim majority of voters had approved of tax increases. He proposed to spend half of the new revenues sought on education, 12 percent on health and welfare, 10 percent on local government, and the remainder on state employee salaries and streamlined services. \\"There are no frills in what I am proposing ... . no luxuries ... . no monuments to me as an individual ... . I implore every member of the General Assembly as I have myself: Listen to the voice of the people ... . not to the selfish interests.\\"Irwin, p. 117 Ernest Dumas, then with the since defunct Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock noted that the Rockefeller revenue package was essentially dead-on-arrival in both houses of the legislature though parts of the program were enacted piecemeal in the subsequent administration of the Democrat Dale Bumpers. Dumas describes Rockefeller as the \\"most liberal governor in Arkansas history\\" in light of his attempts to increase taxes to augment the size and scope of state government as well as steadfast support for civil rights and opposition to capital punishment.Statement of Ernest Dumas, December 2011 During this term Rockefeller quietly and successfully completed the integration of Arkansas schools that had been such a political bombshell only a few years before. He established the Council on Human Relations despite opposition from the legislature. Draft boards in the state boasted the highest level of racial integration of any U.S. state by the time that Rockefeller left office. In 1970, it was disclosed that Rockefeller had maintained a list of militants for use by law enforcement to prevent potential disorders on Arkansas college and university campuses. The list drew opposition from some of his opponents, including an unsuccessful Democratic primary hopeful, state House Speaker Hayes McClerkin of Texarkana. McClerkin argued that the list may have contained the names of those who merely disagreed with Rockefeller politically.John L. Ward, The Arkansas Rockefeller (Baton Rouge, Louisiana: Louisiana State University Press, 1978), pp. 167‚Äì168, 175; Arkansas Democrat, January 3, 8, 1970. In 1970, the Arkansas GOP under Rockefeller hired its first paid executive director, Neal Sox Johnson of Nashville in Howard County. Johnson left the position in 1973 to take a high position with the former Farmers Home Administration in Washington, D.C., and was replaced by Ken Coon,Arkansas Outlook, Arkansas Republican Party newsletter, February 1973. who carried the party's gubernatorial banner in 1974 against David Pryor. =Electoral defeat= In the 1970 campaign, Rockefeller expected to face Orval Faubus, who led the old-guard Democrats, but the previously unknown Dale Bumpers of Charleston in Franklin County rose to the top of the Democratic heap by promising reforms. Bumpers' charisma and \\"fresh face\\" were too much for an incumbent Republican to overcome. Rockefeller lost his third-term bid, but he had inadvertently propelled the Democrats to reform their own party. Maurice Britt managed the 1970 campaign, and he was replaced on the Republican ticket for lieutenant governor by Sterling R. Cockrill of Little Rock, the former Democratic House Speaker in Rockefeller's first term. Cockrill switched parties in the spring of 1970 to make the race; he was defeated by the Democrat Bob C. Riley but finished 35,000 votes ahead of Rockefeller.Arkansas Secretary of State, General election returns, November 3, 1970 Reflecting on his defeat, Rockefeller said: > It has been said by some that I asked for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me > ‚Äì what quality of leadership would ask too little? What sort of leadership > would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long > has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration > would have been in not struggling for something better. Today, I am not > ashamed ... . The most meaningful measurement of progress is that certain > things are no longer acceptable to us as a people.The Arkansas Outlook, > January 1971 With the 1970 elections, the Republicans were reduced to a single member of each legislative chamber, Preston Bynum of Siloam Springs in the House and Jim Caldwell in the Senate. Danny Patrick, elected with Rockefeller in 1966 and 1968, went down to defeat in Madison and Carroll counties at the hands of Stephen A. Smith, who at twenty-one became Arkansas' youngest-ever state legislator, a designation that Patrick himself had taken only four years earlier. As a dramatic last act, Governor Rockefeller, a longtime death penalty opponent, commuted the sentences of every prisoner on Arkansas's Death Row and urged the governors of other states to do likewise. Thirty-three years later, in January 2003, Illinois' lame duck governor, George Ryan, would do the same, granting blanket commutations to the 167 inmates then sentenced to death in the state. Before he left office, Rockefeller appointed a young public administrator, Jerry Climer, to the vacant post of Pulaski County clerk. Two years later, Climer ran for secretary of state. He later founded two Washington, D.C.-based \\"think tanks.\\" and left office on January 12, 1971. In 1972, Rockefeller persuaded Len E. Blaylock of Perry County, his former welfare commissioner known for expertise in government administration to be the Republican gubernatorial nominee. Blaylock lost to Bumpers by an even greater margin than had Rockefeller in 1970. Rockefeller that year also supported the unsuccessful candidacy of Wayne H. Babbitt, a North Little Rock veterinarian who became the only Republican ever to challenge the reelection of U.S. Senator John L. McClellan. Rockefeller hired as a $300-a-month secretary Judy Petty, who went on to serve two terms in the state legislature and to carry the Republican standard twice in races for Congress. Personal life On February 14, 1948, Winthrop married actress Jievute \\"Bobo\\" Paulekiute (September 6, 1916 ‚Äì May 19, 2008). She was previously married to Boston Brahmin socialite John Sears Jr. The wedding took place in Florida, and at the reception, a choir sang Negro spirituals.\\"The Bride Wore Pink\\", Time magazine, 23 February 1948 On September 17, 1948, she gave birth to their son, Winthrop Paul \\"Win\\" Rockefeller. The couple separated in 1950 and divorced in 1954. Bobo got custody of Win.\\"Take It Or Leave It\\", Time magazine, June 23, 1952 On June 11, 1956, Rockefeller wed the Seattle-born socialite Jeanette Edris (1918‚Äì1997).Lubbock Avalanche-Journal via newspaperarchive.com 17 September 2011 She had two children, Bruce and Ann Bartley, from a previous marriage. Winthrop and Jeanette had no children together and divorced shortly after he left the governorship in 1971.\\"The Life of Winthrop Rockefeller\\" wrfoundation.org 17 September 2011 As the state's First Lady, Jeanette Rockefeller took a special interest in mental health issues. In September 1972, Rockefeller was diagnosed with inoperable pancreatic cancer and endured a devastating round of chemotherapy. When he returned to Arkansas the populace was shocked at his gaunt and haggard appearance. Winthrop Rockefeller died February 22, 1973, in Palm Springs, California, at the age of sixty. His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Winrock Farms in Morrilton, Arkansas. Legacy The legacy of Winthrop Rockefeller lives on in the form of numerous charities, scholarships, and the activities of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation and the Winthrop Rockefeller Charitable Trust, including Winrock International, an international nonprofit organization based in Little Rock, Arkansas whose mission is to empower disadvantaged people, increase economic opportunity, and sustain natural resources.\\"Winrock International\\", The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History & Culture. Retrieved on 29 February 2016. The Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation provides funding for projects across Arkansas to encourage economic development, education, and racial and social justice. In 1964, he founded Museum of Automobiles on Petit Jean Mountain, which after his death in 1973 was given to the Arkansas State Parks system; a non-profit organization was formed to run the museum; in March 2007, the Charitable Trust pledged $100,000 for its ongoing operations if the museum raised an equal amount by the end of that year. Rockefeller's political legacy lives on in both the Republican and Democratic parties of Arkansas, both of which were forced to reform as a result of his presence on the state scene. Rockefeller was the subject of the December 2, 1966, cover of Time magazine. Winthrop Rockefeller's son and only child, Win, served as Arkansas lieutenant governor, having won a special election in 1996 to succeed Mike Huckabee. Winthrop Paul Rockefeller then won two full four-year terms in 1998 and 2002. Like his father, Win Paul Rockefeller's political career was cut short by a devastating cancer. The Winrock Shopping Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is named for Rockefeller. He developed the center in a relationship with the University of New Mexico. During his tenure as chairman of Colonial Williamsburg, Winthrop was a frequent visitor at the foundation's Carter's Grove Plantation eight miles away in James City County, Virginia. He is credited with helping develop a plan with Gussie Busch in the early 1970s to turn a portion of the large tract of undeveloped land between the two points into the massive Anheuser-Busch (AB) investment there, which included building a large brewery, the Busch Gardens Williamsburg theme park, the Kingsmill planned resort community, and McLaws Circle, an office park. AB and related entities from that development plan now are the source of the area's largest employment base, surpassing both Colonial Williamsburg and the local military bases.

In the Plays and Players Yearbook for 1993 he was reckoned to be the third most performed playwright in the UK behind William Shakespeare and Alan Ayckbourn. Godber has been creative director of the Theatre Royal Wakefield since 2011. Biography John Godber, born on 18 May 1956 in Upton, West Riding of Yorkshire, trained as a teacher of drama at Bretton Hall College, which is affiliated to the University of Leeds, and became artistic director of Hull Truck Theatre Company in 1984. Before venturing into plays, he was head of drama at Minsthorpe High School, the school he had attended as a student, and then wrote for the TV series Brookside and Grange Hill. While he was at Minsthorpe he taught future actors Adrian Hood (Preston Front, Up 'n' Under film) and Chris Walker (Doctors, Coronation Street). A 1993 survey for Plays and Players magazine cited Godber as the third most performed playwright in the UK, after Shakespeare and Alan Ayckbourn. In 2005 he won two BAFTAs for Odd Squad, written and directed on location in Hull and screened by BBC children's television. His plays are performed across the world, Bouncers (1977) being the most popular. In 2004 he became a visiting professor of Popular Theatre at Liverpool Hope University. He has also been professor of drama at Hull University. In 2011 John Godber became creative director at Theatre Royal Wakefield and set up The John Godber Company as its resident company. Godber's earlier style utilises an interest in German Expressionism, an economic and physical style inspired by this and the inspiration of Bretton Hall Head of School (Drama) John Hodgson. His later and more naturalistic style reflects his growth as a member of the middle classes and an Ayckbournesque world of drama. He says that the \\"new Godber\\" is perhaps a writer like Tim Firth. Godber is married to the writer and actress Jane Thornton, also known as Jane Clifford and Jane Godber. Godber's name has been given to the John Godber Centre in Hucknall. The theatre facility at New College Pontefract, a college near his birthplace, is also named the John Godber Theatre. It opened in 2012.

Willard became the national president of Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) in 1879 and remained president until her death in 1898. Her influence continued in the next decades, as the Eighteenth (Prohibition) and Nineteenth (Women Suffrage) Amendments to the United States Constitution were adopted. Willard developed the slogan \\"Do Everything\\" for the WCTU, encouraging members to engage in a broad array of social reforms through lobbying, petitioning, preaching, publishing, and education. During her lifetime, Willard succeeded in raising the age of consent in many states, as well as passing labor reforms including the eight-hour work day. Her vision also encompassed prison reform, scientific temperance instruction, Christian socialism, and the global expansion of women's rights. Early life and education Frances Willard Willard was born in 1839 to Josiah Flint Willard and Mary Thompson Hill Willard in Churchville, near Rochester, New York. She was named after English novelist Frances (Fanny) Burney, the American poet Frances Osgood, and her sister, Elizabeth Caroline, who had died the previous year. She had two other siblings: her older brother, Oliver, and her younger sister, Mary. Her father was a farmer, naturalist, and legislator. Her mother was a schoolteacher. In 1841 the family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, where, at Oberlin College Josiah Willard studied for the ministry, and Mary Hill Willard took classes. They moved to Janesville, Wisconsin in 1846 for Josiah Willard's health. In Wisconsin, the family, formerly Congregationalists, became Methodists. Frances and her sister Mary attended Milwaukee Normal Institute, where their mother's sister taught. In 1858, the Willard family moved to Evanston, Illinois, and Josiah Willard became a banker. Frances and Mary attended the North Western Female College (no affiliation with Northwestern University) and their brother Oliver attended the Garrett Biblical Institute. Teaching career After graduating from North Western Female College, Willard held various teaching positions throughout the country. She worked at the Pittsburgh Female College, and, as preceptress at the Genesee Wesleyan Seminary in New York (later Syracuse University). She was appointed president of the newly founded Evanston College for Ladies in 1871. When the Evanston College for Ladies became the Woman's College of Northwestern University in 1873, Willard was named the first Dean of Women at the university. However, that position was to be short-lived with her resignation in 1874 after confrontations with the University President, Charles Henry Fowler, over her governance of the Woman's College. Willard had previously been engaged to Fowler and had broken off the engagement. Activist (WCTU and suffrage) Frances Willard learning to ride a bicycle After her resignation, Willard focused her energies on a new career: the women's temperance movement. In 1874, Willard participated in the founding convention of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) where she was elected the first Corresponding Secretary. In 1876, she became head of the WCTU Publications Department, focusing on publishing and building a national audience for the WCTU's weekly newspaper, The Union Signal. In 1885 Willard joined with Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, Mary Ellen West, Frances Conant and 43 others to found the Illinois Woman's Press Association. In 1879, she sought and successfully obtained presidency of the National WCTU. Once elected, she held the post until her death. Her tireless efforts for the temperance cause included a 50-day speaking tour in 1874, an average of 30,000 miles of travel a year, and an average of 400 lectures a year for a 10-year period, mostly with the assistance of her personal secretary, Anna Adams Gordon. Meanwhile, Willard sought to expand WCTU membership in the South, and met Varina Davis, the wife of former Confederate President Jefferson Davis, who was secretary of the local chapter of the Women's Christian Association in Memphis (where one daughter lived). Willard had tried and failed to convince Lucy Hayes (wife of President Rutherford B. Hayes) to assist the temperance cause, but writer Sallie F. Chapin, a former Confederate sympathizer who had published a temperance novel, supported Willard and was a friend of the Davises. In 1887, Davis invited Willard to her home to discuss the future of her unmarried daughter Winnie Davis, but both Davis women declined to become public supporters, in part because Jefferson Davis opposed legal prohibition. In 1887, Texas held a referendum on temperance, in part because former Confederate postmaster John Reagan supported temperance laws. When newspapers published a photograph of Willard handing Jefferson Davis a temperance button to give to his wife, Jefferson Davis publicly came out against the referendum (as contrary to states' rights) and it lost. Although Varina Davis and Willard would continue to correspond over the next decade (as Varina moved to New York after her husband's death, and Willard spent most of her last decade abroad); another temperance referendum would not occur for two decades.Joan Cashin, First Lady of the Confederacy: Varina Davis' Civil War (Harvard University Press 2006) pp. 241-44. 252-253 As president of the WCTU, Willard also argued for female suffrage, based on \\"Home Protection,\\" which she described as \\"the movement ‚Ä¶ the object of which is to secure for all women above the age of twenty-one years the ballot as one means for the protection of their homes from the devastation caused by the legalized traffic in strong drink.\\"Willard, Frances Elizabeth. Home protection manual. New York: Published at \\"The Independent\\" office, 1879. The \\"devastation\\" referred to violent acts against women committed by intoxicated men, which was common both in and outside the home. Willard argued that it was too easy for men to get away with their crimes without women's suffrage. The \\"Home Protection\\" argument was used to garner the support of the \\"average woman,\\" who was told to be suspicious of female suffragists by the patriarchal press, religious authorities, and society as a whole.Frances Willard, \\"Speech At Queen's Hall, London,\\" June 9, 1894, in Citizen and Home Guard, July 23, 1894, WCTU series, roll 41, frame 27. Reprinted as \\"The Average Woman,\\" in Slagell, \\"Good Woman Speaking Well,\\" 619-625. The desire for home protection gave the average woman a socially appropriate avenue to seek enfranchisement. Willard insisted that women must forgo the notions that they were the \\"weaker\\" sex and that they must embrace their natural dependence on men. She encouraged women to join the movement to improve society: \\"Politics is the place for woman.\\" The goal of the suffrage movement for Willard was to construct an \\"ideal of womanhood\\" that allowed women to fulfill their potential as the companions and counselors of men, as opposed to the \\"incumbrance and toy of man.\\" Willard's suffrage argument also hinged on her feminist interpretation of Scripture. She claimed that natural and divine laws called for equality in the American household, with the mother and father sharing leadership. She expanded this notion of the home, arguing that men and women should lead side by side in matters of education, church, and government, just as \\"God sets male and female side by side throughout his realm of law.\\" Willard's work took to an international scale in 1883 with the circulation of the Polyglot Petition against the international drug trade. She also joined May Wright Sewall at the International Council of Women meeting in Washington, DC, laying the permanent foundation for the National Council of Women of the United States. She became the organization's first president in 1888 and continued in that post until 1890. Willard also founded the World WCTU in 1888 and became its president in 1893. She collaborated closely with Lady Isabel Somerset, president of the British Women's Temperance Association, whom she visited several times in the United Kingdom. After 1893, Willard was influenced by the British Fabian Society and became a committed Christian socialist.

The Frances Willard House was opened as a museum in 1900 when it also became the headquarters for the WCTU. In 1965 it was elevated to the status of National Historic Landmark. In 1911 the Willard Hall and Willard Guest House in Wakefield Street, Adelaide, South Australia were opened by the South Australian branch of the WCTU. Memorials and portrayals The famous painting, American Woman and her Political Peers, commissioned by Henrietta Briggs-Wall for the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, features Frances Willard at the center, surrounded by a convict, American Indian, lunatic, and an idiot. The image succinctly portrayed one argument for female enfranchisement: without the right to vote, the educated, respectable woman was equated with the other outcasts of society to whom the franchise was denied. After her death, Willard was the first woman included among America's greatest leaders in Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol. Her statue was designed by Helen Farnsworth Mears and was unveiled in 1905. The Frances Elizabeth Willard relief by Lorado Taft and commissioned by the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union in 1929 is in the Indiana Statehouse, Indianapolis, Indiana. The plaque commemorates the fiftieth anniversary of Willard's election as president of the WCTU on October 31, 1879: \\"In honor of one who made the world wider for women and more homelike for humanity Frances Elizabeth Willard Intrepid Pathfinder and beloved leader of the National and World's Woman's Christian Temperance Union.\\" The Frances Willard House Museum and Archives is located in Evanston, Illinois.Frances Willard House Museum and Archives Website Retrieved 2016-02-22. A dormitory at Northwestern University, Willard Residential College, opened in 1938 as a female dormitory and became the university's first undergraduate co-ed housing in 1970. The Frances E. Willard School in Philadelphia was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The Frances Willard Schoolhouse in Janesville, Wisconsin was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Willard Middle School, established in Berkeley, California in 1916, was named in her honor. Willard Park, also in Berkeley and adjacent to the middle school, was dedicated to Frances Willard in 1982. Frances Willard Avenue in Chico, California is named in her honor. She was a guest of John and Annie Bidwell, the town founders and fellow leaders in the prohibitionist movement. The avenue is adjacent to the Bidwell Mansion. The Frances E. Willard Temperance Hospital operated under that name from 1929 to 1936 in Chicago. It is now Loretto Hospital. Willard appears as one of two main female protagonists in the young adult novel Bicycle Madness by Jane Kurtz. FEW Spirits, a distillery located in Evanston, Illinois, uses Willard's initials as its name. In 2000, Willard was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.

She formed the strongest friendships with co-workers. It is difficult to redefine Willard's 19th-century life in terms of the culture and norms of later centuries, but some scholars describe her inclinations and actions as aligned with same-sex emotional alliance (what historian Judith M. Bennett calls \\"lesbian-like\\").Bennett, Judith M.: '\\"Lesbian-Like\\" and the Social History of Lesbianisms' Journal of the History of Sexuality Vol. 9, No. 1/2 (Jan. - Apr., 2000), pp. 1-24 Controversy over civil rights issues In the 1890s, Willard came into conflict with progressive African-American journalist and anti-lynching crusader Ida B. Wells. While trying to expose the evils of alcohol, Willard and other temperance reformers often depicted one of the evils as its effect to incite purported black criminality, thus implying that this was one of the serious problems requiring an urgent cure. The rift first surfaced during Wells' speaking tour of Britain in 1893, where Willard was also touring and was already a popular reformist speaker. Wells openly questioned Willard's silence on lynching in the United States and accused Willard of having pandered to the racist myth that white women were in constant danger of rape from drunken black males to avoid endangering WCTU efforts in the South. She recounted a time when Willard had visited the South and blamed the failure of the temperance movement there on the population: \\"The colored race multiplies like the locusts of Egypt,\\" and \\"the grog shop is its center of power.... The safety of women, of childhood, of the home is menaced in a thousand localities.\\" Willard repeatedly denied Wells' accusations and wrote that \\"the attitude of the society [WCTU] toward the barbarity of lynching has been more pronounced than that of any other association in the United States,\\"\\"About Southern Lynchings,\\" Baltimore Herald, 20 October 1895 (Temperance and Prohibition Papers microfilm (1977), section III, reel 42, scrapbook 70, frame 153). and she maintained that her primary focus was upon empowering and protecting women, including the many African-American members of the WCTU. While it is true that neither Willard nor the WCTU had ever spoken out directly against lynching, the WCTU actively recruited black women and included them in its membership. After their acrimonious exchange, Willard explicitly stated her opposition to lynching and successfully urged the WCTU to pass a resolution against lynching. She, however, continued to use the rhetoric that Wells alleged incited lynching. In her pamphlets Southern Horrors and The Red Record, Wells linked rhetoric portraying white women as symbols of innocence and purity that black men could not resist, as facilitating lynchings. Wells also believed that Willard condoned segregation by permitting the practice within WCTU's southern chapters. Under Willard's presidency, the national WCTU maintained a policy of \\"states rights\\" which allowed southern charters to be more conservative than their northern counterparts regarding questions of race and the role of women in politics.

In her public life, she was a strong proponent of the arts and higher education and of the feminist cause. Her early life was spent moving among the various royal residences in the company of her family. When her father, the prince consort, died on 14 December 1861, the court went into a long period of mourning, to which with time Louise became unsympathetic. Louise was an able sculptor and artist, and several of her sculptures remain today. She was also a supporter of the feminist movement, corresponding with Josephine Butler, and visiting Elizabeth Garrett. Before her marriage, from 1866 to 1871, Louise served as an unofficial secretary to her mother, the Queen. The question of Louise's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s. Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested, but Victoria did not want her to marry a foreign prince, and therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the British aristocracy. Despite opposition from members of the royal family, Louise fell in love with John, Marquess of Lorne, the heir of the Duke of Argyll. Victoria consented to the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. After a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the queen's constraints on their activities. In 1878, Lorne was appointed Governor General of Canada, a post he held 1878‚Äì1884. Louise was viceregal consort, starting a lasting interest in Canada. Her names were used to name many features in Canada. Following Victoria's death in 1901, Louise entered the social circle established by her elder brother, the new king, Edward VII. Louise's marriage survived thanks to long periods of separation; the couple reconciled in 1911 and she was devastated by her husband's death in 1914. After the end of the First World War in 1918, at the age of 70, she began to retire from public life, undertaking few public duties outside Kensington Palace, where she died at the age of 91. Early life Louise was born on 18 March 1848 at Buckingham Palace, London. She was the fourth daughter and sixth child of the reigning British monarch, Queen Victoria, and her husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Her birth coincided with revolutions which swept across Europe, prompting the queen to remark that Louise would turn out to be \\"something peculiar\\". The queen's labour with Louise was the first to be aided with chloroform. Queen Victoria painted a portrait of Princess Louise after an original by Franz Xaver Winterhalter Albert and Victoria chose the names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was invariably known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg- Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, for whom the Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, one of the few children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly got up in the middle of the service and knelt at the queen's feet, much to the queen's horror. Like her siblings, Louise was brought up with the strict programme of education devised by her father, Prince Albert, and his friend and confidant, Baron Stockmar. The young children were taught practical tasks, such as cooking, farming, household tasks and carpentry. From her early years, Louise was a talented and intelligent child, and her artistic talents were quickly recognised. On his visit to Osborne House in 1863, Hallam Tennyson, the son of the poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson, remarked that Louise could \\"draw beautifully\\". Because of her royal rank, an artistic career was not considered. However, the queen first allowed her to attend art school under the tutelage of the sculptor Mary Thornycroft, and later (1863) allowed her to study at the National Art Training School, now The Royal College of Art. South Kensington. Louise also became an able dancer, and Victoria wrote, after a dance, that Louise \\"danced the sword dance with more verve and accuracy than any of her sisters\\". Her wit and intelligence made her a favourite with her father, with her inquisitive nature earning her the nickname \\"Little Miss Why\\" from other members of the royal family. Secretary Princess Louise in the 1860s Louise's father, Prince Albert, died at Windsor on 14 December 1861. The queen was devastated, and ordered her household to move from Windsor to Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The atmosphere of the royal court became gloomy and morbid in the wake of the prince's death, and entertainments became dry and dull. Louise quickly became dissatisfied with her mother's prolonged mourning. For her seventeenth birthday in 1865, Louise requested the ballroom to be opened for a debutante dance, the like of which had not been performed since Prince Albert's death. Her request was refused, and her boredom with the mundane routine of travelling between the different royal residences at set times irritated her mother, who considered Louise to be indiscreet and argumentative. The queen comforted herself by rigidly continuing with Prince Albert's plans for their children. Princess Alice was married to Prince Louis, the future Grand Duke of Hesse, at Osborne on 1 June 1862. In 1863, Edward, the Prince of Wales, married Princess Alexandra of Denmark. The queen made it a tradition that the eldest unmarried daughter would become her unofficial secretary, a position which Louise filled in 1866, despite the queen's concern that she was indiscreet. Louise, however, proved to be good at the job: Victoria wrote shortly afterwards: \\"She is (and who would some years ago have thought it?) a clever dear girl with a fine strong character, unselfish and affectionate.\\"Quoted by . However, when Louise fell in love with her brother Leopold's tutor, the Reverend Robinson Duckworth (14 years her senior), between 1866 and 1870, the queen reacted by dismissing Duckworth in 1870. He later became Canon of Westminster Abbey. Louise was bored at court, and by fulfilling her duties, which were little more than minor secretarial tasks, such as writing letters on the queen's behalf; dealing with political correspondence; and providing the queen with company, she had more responsibilities. She also undertook her share of public and philanthropic duties, for example inaugurating the new North Eastern Hospital for Children in 1867 and launching the ship HMS Druid in 1869. Marriage =Suitors= As a daughter of the queen, Louise was a desirable bride; more so as she is regarded as the queen's most beautiful daughter by both contemporary and modern biographers. However, she was accused by the press, without substantiation, of romantic affairs. This, coupled with her liberalism and feminism, prompted the queen to find her a husband. The choice had to suit Victoria as well as Louise, and the queen insisted that her daughter's husband should live near her, a promise which had also been extracted from the husband of Helena, Louise's sister. Various suitors were proposed by the leading royal houses of Europe: Princess Alexandra proposed her brother, the Crown Prince of Denmark, but the queen was strongly opposed to another Danish marriage that could antagonise Prussia at a time of diplomatic tension over the Schleswig- Holstein question. Victoria, Louise's eldest sister, proposed the tall and rich Prince Albert of Prussia, but Queen Victoria disapproved of another Prussian marriage that would have been unpopular in England. Prince Albert was also reluctant to settle in England as required. William, Prince of Orange, was also considered a suitor, but because of his extravagant lifestyle in Paris, where he lived openly with a lover, the queen quickly vetoed the idea. Louise and Lorne's engagement photo (W & D Downey, 1870) Louise viewed marriage to any prince as undesirable, and announced that she wished to marry John Campbell, Marquess of Lorne, heir to the Dukedom of Argyll. No marriage between a daughter of a monarch and a British subject had been given official recognition since 1515, when Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, married King Henry VIII's sister Mary. Louise's brother, the prince of Wales, was strongly opposed to a marriage with a non-mediatized noble. Furthermore, Lorne's father, George Campbell, was an ardent supporter of William Ewart Gladstone, and the Prince of Wales was worried that he would drag the royal family into political disputes. Nevertheless, the opposition was crushed by the queen, who wrote to the Prince of Wales in 1869: The queen averred that Louise's marriage to a subject would bring \\"new blood\\" into the family, while all European princes were related to each other. She was convinced that this would strengthen the royal family morally and physically.Paraphrased from =Engagement and wedding= Princess Louise in her wedding dress Louise became engaged to the Marquess of Lorne on 3 October 1870 while they were visiting Balmoral. Lorne was invited to Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and accompanied Louise, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Hatherley and Queen Victoria's lady-in-waiting Lady Ely on a drive. Later that day, Louise returned and announced to the queen that Lorne had \\"spoken of his devotion\\" to Louise, and she accepted his proposal in the knowledge of the queen's approval. The queen later gave Lady Ely a bracelet to mark the occasion. The Queen found it difficult to let go of her daughter, confiding in her journal that she \\"felt painfully the thought of losing her\\". The new breach in royal tradition caused surprise, especially in Germany, and Queen Victoria wrote to the Queen of Prussia that princes of small impoverished German houses were \\"very unpopular\\" in Britain and that Lord Lorne, a \\"person of distinction at home\\" with \\"an independent fortune\\" was \\"really no lower in rank than minor German Royalty\\".Quoted in Victoria settled an annuity on Louise shortly before her marriage. The ceremony was conducted at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd outside was so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control. Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the queen kissed Louise, and Lorne ‚Äì now a member of the royal family, but still a subject ‚Äì kissed the queen's hand. The couple then journeyed to Claremont in Surrey for the honeymoon, but the presence of attendants on the journey, and at meal times, made it impossible for them to talk privately. The short four-day visit did not pass without an interruption from the queen, who was curious about her daughter's thoughts on married life. Among their wedding gifts was a maplewood desk from Queen Victoria, now at Inveraray Castle. Marchioness of Lorne Following her marriage, Louise continued her charitable and artistic interests. In 1871, the Ladies Work Society was founded in South Audley Street, promoting the making and sale of needlework and embroidery for poverty relief: Louise became its president, and designed some of their products. Viceregal consort of Canada In 1878, British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli chose Lorne to be Canada's Governor General, and he was duly appointed by Queen Victoria. Louise thus became his viceregal consort. As viceregal consort, she used her position to support the arts and higher education and the cause of female equality, although she said \\"the subject of Domestic Economy lies at the root of the ‚Äì highest life of every true woman.\\" But her stay in Canada was unhappy as a result of homesickness, dislike of Ottawa and a bad sleighing accident. =Inauspicious arrival= Princess Louise in Canada On 15 November 1878, the couple left Liverpool and arrived in Canada for the inauguration at Halifax on 25 November. Louise became the first royal to take up residence in Rideau Hall, officially the queen's royal residence in Ottawa. However, the hall was far from the splendour of British royal residences, and, as each viceregal couple decorated the hall with their own furnishings, and thus took them when they departed, the Lornes found the palace sparse in d√©cor upon their arrival. Louise put her artistic talents to work and hung many of her watercolour and oil paintings around the hall, also installing her sculpted works. Though the news that a daughter of the queen would be viceregal consort of Canada first saw a \\"thrill of joy burst upon the Dominion\\", it being felt that the princess would be a strong link between Canadians and their sovereign, the arrival of the new governor general and his wife was not initially welcomed by the Canadian press, which complained about the imposition of royalty on the country's hitherto un-regal society. Relations with the press further deteriorated when Lorne's private secretary, Francis de Winton, threw four journalists off the royal train. Although the Lornes had no knowledge of de Winton's action, it was assumed by the press that they did, and they earned an early reputation for haughtiness. Louise was horrified by the negative press, and when she heard about reports of \\"a nation of flunkies\\" at the viceregal court, taking lessons in \\"the backward walk,\\" Louise declared that she \\"wouldn't care if they came in blanket coats!\\"Quoted in (A reference to the ubiquitous capote, a coat made of blanket-cloth, both durable and warm. The cultural significance of the blanket coat in genteel society, with reference to several early Governors-General and their wives, can be found in \\"'Very Picturesque and Very Canadian': The Blanket Coat and Anglo-Canadian Identity in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century\\" by Eileen Stack of the McCord Museum of Canadian History.) Eventually the worries of a rigid court at Rideau Hall and the \\"feeble undercurrent of criticism\\" turned out to be unfounded as the royal couple proved to be more relaxed than their predecessors. =Canadian entertainments= The Marquess of Lorne, accompanied by Princess Louise, opening the Canadian Parliament in 1879 Louise's first few months in Canada were tinged with sadness as her favourite sister, the Grand Duchess of Hesse and by Rhine, died on 14 December 1878. Although homesick over that first Christmas, Louise soon grew accustomed to the winter climate. Sleighing and skating were two of her favourite pastimes. In Canada, as the monarch's direct representative, Lorne always took precedence over his wife, so that at the Opening of the Parliament of Canada on 13 February 1879, Louise was ranked no differently from others in attendance. She had to remain standing with the MPs, until Lorne asked them to be seated. In order for Lorne to meet every Canadian member of Parliament, he held bi-weekly dinners for 50 people. However, some of the Canadian ladies responded negatively to the British party. One of her ladies-in-waiting reported that some had an \\"'I'm as good as you' sort of manner when one begins a conversation.\\" Court entertainments were open; anyone who could afford the clothing to attend functions was simply asked to sign the visitor's book. Louise's first state ball was given on 19 February 1879, and she made a good impression on her guests when she ordered the silk cordon, separating the viceregal party from the guests, be removed. However, the ball was marred by various mishaps, including a drunken bandsman nearly starting a fire by pulling a curtain over a gas lamp. The open house practice was criticised by guests who complained about the low social status of other guests. One attendee was horrified to find the attendee's grocer dancing in the same set. Louise and Lorne founded the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, and enjoyed visiting Quebec (where they made their summer home), and Toronto. Louise served as patroness of the Ladies' Educational Association, of the Woman's Protective Immigration Society, of the Society of Decorative Arts and of the Art Association, all of Montreal. One of her works as a sculptor is the statue of her Royal mother Queen Victoria, which now stands in front of the Royal Victoria College, Montreal, now the Strathcona Music Building of McGill University. Lorne's father, The Duke of Argyll, arrived with two of his daughters in June, and in the presence of the family, Louise caught a salmon. The women's success at fishing prompted the Duke to remark that fishing in Canada required no skill. =Sleigh accident and Bermuda visit= The arrival of Princess Louise in Hamilton, Bermuda (29 January 1883) Louise, Lorne, and two attendants, were hurt in a sleigh accident on 14 February 1880. The winter was particularly severe, and the carriage in which they were traveling overturned, throwing the coachman and footman from the sleigh. The horses then panicked, and dragged the overturned carriage over more than of ground. Louise was knocked unconscious when she hit her head on the iron bar supporting the roof, and Lorne was trapped underneath her, expecting \\"the sides of the carriage to give way at any moment\\".Quoted in . citing the World of 2 March 1880 Eventually, as they overtook the sleigh ahead, the horses calmed, and the occupant of that sleigh, Princess Louise's aide-de-camp, ordered an empty carriage to convey the injured party back to Rideau Hall. The doctors who attended Louise reported she was severely concussed and in shock, and that \\"it was a wonder her skull was not fractured\\". Louise's ear had been injured when her earring caught on the side of the sleigh, tearing her ear lobe in two. The press played down the story on instructions from Lorne's private secretary, an act that was described by contemporaries as \\"stupid and ill advised\\". For example, one New Zealand newspaper reported, \\"Excepting immediately after the blow, the princess was perfectly sensible during the whole time...\\" Knowledge of Louise's true condition might have elicited sympathy from the Canadian people. As it was, one Member of Parliament wrote: \\"Except the cut in the lower part of the ear I think there was no injury done worth mentioning.\\" Therefore, when Louise cancelled her immediate engagements, people thought she was malingering. News of the accident was also played down in Britain, and in letters home to the anxious Queen Victoria. She played a major role in the development of the nascent tourism industry of the colony of Bermuda, 770 miles south-east of Nova Scotia. In 1883, because of her fragile health, she spent the winter in Bermuda (arriving on the 29 January 1883 from Charleston, South Carolina, aboard , popularising a trend for wealthy North Americans to escape to Bermuda's relatively mild climate during the winter months. Her visit brought such attention to Bermuda that a palatial hotel, which opened in 1885, intended to cater to these new visitors, was named after her; the Princess Hotel was built on the shore of Hamilton Harbour, in the parish of Pembroke (the Princess herself having occupied Inglewood, the home of JH Timingham, in Paget Parish, during her visit). =Continued interest in Canada= After returning to Britain in 1883, Louise continued to take an interest in Canada. During the North-West Rebellion of 1885 she sent a certain Dr. Boyd medical supplies and a large fund of money for distribution. Her express instructions were that assistance was to be rendered to friend and foe indiscriminately. To fulfill her wishes, Boyd accompanied the Militia Medical Staff under Dr. Thomas Roddick to the sites of the Battle of Fish Creek and the Battle of Batoche to help give medical treatment to the wounded, including the M√©tis opposition. In 1905, the province of Alberta was named after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta. In the province, there is Lake Louise, and Mount Alberta is named in her honour. Victoria's last years =Family conflict= Princesses Louise and Beatrice riding with their mother Louise returned to Britain, from Quebec, with her husband on 27 October 1883, and landed at Liverpool. Queen Victoria had prepared apartments at Kensington Palace, and the couple took up official residence there. Louise retained those apartments until her death there 56 years later. Louise resumed public duties in Britain, for example, opening St George's Gardens, Bloomsbury on 1 July 1884. Lorne resumed his political career, campaigning unsuccessfully for the Hampstead seat in 1885. In 1896, he won the South Manchester seat, entering parliament as a Liberal. Louise, unlike Lorne and his father, was in favour of Irish Home Rule, and disappointed when he defected from Gladstonian Liberalism to the Liberal Unionists. Relations between Louise and Lorne were strained, and, despite the queen's attempts to keep them under one roof, they often went their separate ways. Even when he accompanied Louise, he was not always received with favour at court, and the prince of Wales did not take to him. Out of all the royal family, Lorne was the only one to be identified closely with a political party, having been a Gladstonian liberal in the House of Commons. Louise's relationship with the two sisters closest to the queen, Beatrice and Helena, was strained at best. Beatrice had married the tall and handsome Prince Henry of Battenberg in a love match in 1885, and they had four children. Louise, who had a jealous nature, had grown accustomed to treating Beatrice with pity on account of the queen's constant need for her. Beatrice's biographer, Matthew Dennison, claims that in contrast to Beatrice, Louise remained strikingly good looking throughout her forties. Louise and her husband were no longer close, and rumours spread about Lorne's alleged homosexuality. Thus, Beatrice was enjoying a satisfying sexual relationship with her popular husband, which Louise was not. Louise may have considered Prince Henry a more appropriate husband for herself. Certainly, following Prince Henry's death in 1896, Louise wrote that: \\"he [Henry] was almost the greatest friend I had‚ÄîI, too, miss him more than I can say\\". In addition, Louise attempted to champion her late brother-in-law by announcing that she was his confidante and that Beatrice, a mere cipher, meant nothing to him. =Rumours regarding Louise= Further rumours spread that Louise was having an affair with Arthur Bigge, later Lord Stamfordham, the queen's assistant private secretary. Beatrice mentioned the rumours to the queen's physician, calling it a \\"scandal\\", and Prince Henry claimed to have seen Bigge drinking to Louise's health at dinner. Louise denied the rumour, claiming that it was started by Beatrice and Helena to undermine her position at court. However, on Henry's death, relations between the sisters sporadically improved, and it was Louise, rather than the queen, who was the first to arrive at Cimiez to be with the widowed Beatrice. Nevertheless, Louise's jealousy did not evaporate completely. James Reid, the queen's physician, wrote to his wife a few years later: \\"Louise is as usual much down on her sisters. Hope she won't stay long or she will do mischief!\\" Rumours of affairs did not surround only Bigge. In 1890, the sculptor Joseph Edgar Boehm died in Louise's presence at his studio in London, leading to rumours that the two were having an affair. Boehm's assistant, Alfred Gilbert, who played a central role in comforting Louise after Boehm's death, and supervised the destruction of Boehm's private papers, was rapidly promoted as a royal sculptor. Louise was also romantically linked to fellow artist Edwin Lutyens; her equerry, Colonel William Probert; and an unnamed music master. However, Jehanne Wake, Louise's biographer, argues that there is no substantial evidence to suggest that Louise had sexual relationships with anyone other than her husband. During Victoria's last years, Louise carried out a range of public duties, such as opening public buildings, laying foundation stones, and officiating at special programmes. Louise, like her eldest sister Victoria, was more liberally minded, and supported the suffragist movement, completely contrary to the queen's views. Louise privately visited Elizabeth Garrett, the first British woman openly to qualify as a physician. Queen Victoria deplored the idea of women joining professions, especially medicine, and described the training of female physicians as a \\"repulsive subject\\". =Louise as unconventional royal= Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll c. 1900 by William James Topley Louise was determined to be seen as an ordinary person and not as a member of the court. When travelling abroad, she often used the alias \\"Mrs Campbell\\". Louise was known for her charity towards servants. On one occasion, the butler approached her and requested permission to dismiss the second footman, who was late getting out of bed. When she advised that the footman be given an alarm clock, the butler informed her that he already had one. She then went so far as to suggest a bed that would throw him out at a specified time, but she was told this was not feasible. Finally, she suggested that he might be ill, and when checked, he was found to be suffering from tuberculosis. The footman was therefore sent to New Zealand to recover. On another occasion, when she visited Bermuda, she was invited to a reception and chose to walk rather than be driven. She became thirsty along the way and stopped at a house, where she asked a black woman named Mrs McCarthy for a glass of water. Owing to the scarcity of water, the woman had to go some distance to obtain it, but was reluctant because she had to finish her ironing. When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again. When the woman said that she would have thought so, but was admittedly unsure, Louise replied: \\"Well take a good look at me now, so you can be sure to know me tomorrow at St. Georges.\\" The princess clung to her privacy, and enjoyed not being recognised. Louise and her sisters had another disagreement after the death of the queen's close friend, Jane Spencer, Baroness Churchill. Determined not to put her mother through more misery, Louise wanted the news to be broken to the queen gradually. When this was not done, Louise voiced her sharp criticism of Helena and Beatrice. One month later, on 22 January 1901, Queen Victoria died at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. In her will, the queen bequeathed Kent House, on the Osborne Estate, to Louise as a country residence, and gave Osborne Cottage to Louise's youngest sister, Beatrice. Louise and Beatrice were now neighbours both at Kensington Palace and Osborne. Later life =Edwardian period= Portrait by Philip de L√°szl√≥, 1915 Upon Queen Victoria's death, Louise entered the social circle of her brother, the new King Edward VII, with whom she had much in common, including smoking. She had an obsession with physical fitness, and if she was sneered at for this, she would retort by saying: \\"Never mind, I'll outlive you all.\\"Quoted in Meanwhile, Louise's husband, 9th Duke of Argyll since 1900, took his seat in the House of Lords. The Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, offered him the office of Governor-General of Australia that year, but the offer was declined. Louise continued her sculpture, and in 1902, designed a memorial to the colonial soldiers who died in the Boer War. In the same year, she began a nude study on a married woman suggested by the English painter Sir William Blake Richmond. Louise spent much of her time at Kent House, and she frequently visited Scotland with her husband. Financial pressures did not disappear when Lorne became Duke, and Louise avoided inviting the King to Inveraray, Argyll's ancestral home, because the couple were economising. When Queen Victoria had visited the house before Lorne became Duke of Argyll, there were seventy servants and seventy-four dogs. By the time of Edward VII's accession, there were four servants and two dogs. Princess Louise in later life The Duke of Argyll's health continued to deteriorate. He became increasingly senile, and Louise nursed him devotedly from 1911. In these years Louise and her husband were closer than they had been before. In spring 1914 Louise stayed at Kensington Palace while her husband remained on the Isle of Wight. He developed bronchial problems followed by double pneumonia. Louise was summoned on 28 April 1914, and he died on 2 May. Following his death, Louise had a nervous breakdown and suffered from intense loneliness, writing to a friend shortly afterwards: \\"My loneliness without the Duke is quite terrible. I wonder what he does now!\\"Quoted in =Last years= Louise spent her last years at Kensington Palace, occupying rooms next to her sister Princess Beatrice. She made occasional public appearances with the royal family, such as at the Cenotaph at Whitehall on 11 November 1925. However, her health deteriorated. In 1935, she greeted her nephew, King George V, and his wife, Queen Mary, at Kensington Town Hall during their Silver Jubilee celebrations, and was made an Honorary Freeman of the Borough of Kensington. Her last public appearance occurred in 1937, at the Home Arts and Industries Exhibition. Between these occasions, her great nephew, King Edward VIII, abdicated on 11 December 1936. In December 1936, Louise wrote to the British prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, sympathising with him about the crisis. Princess Louise's grave (centre) at the Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore Following the accession of Edward's brother King George VI, she became too ill to move around, and was confined to Kensington Palace, affectionately called the \\"Auntie Palace\\" by Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She developed neuritis in her arm, inflammation of the nerves between the ribs, fainting fits, and sciatica. Louise occupied herself by drafting prayers, one of which was sent to Neville Chamberlain, reading \\"Guide our Ministers of State and all who are in authority over us ... \\" Death Louise died at Kensington Palace on the morning of 3 December 1939 at the age of 91, wearing the wedding veil she had worn almost 70 years earlier. Following a simple funeral, owing to the war, her remains were cremated at Golders Green Crematorium on 8 December. Her ashes were quietly placed in the Royal Crypt at St. George's Chapel on 12 December, with many members of the Royal and Argyll families present. Her ashes were moved to the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore near Windsor, on 13 March 1940. Louise's will stated that if she died in Scotland she should be buried at the Campbell mausoleum in Kilmun next to her husband; if in England, at Frogmore near her parents. Her coffin was borne by eight NCOs of her own regiment, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.The Glasgow Herald, 13 December 1939, p. 9 Her estate was probated as ¬£239,260, 18 shillings and sixpence, with her debts including 15 shillings for cigarettes.BBC 24 December 2018 Legacy statue of Queen Victoria at Kensington Palace Louise bestowed her name on four Canadian regiments: The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's) in Hamilton, Ontario; the Princess Louise Dragoon Guards in Ottawa, Ontario (inactive since 1965); the 8th Canadian Hussars (Princess Louise's) in Moncton, New Brunswick; and the Princess Louise Fusiliers in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Queen Elizabeth II later recalled that Louise and her sister Beatrice would talk until they stunned their audience with their output of words. The province of Alberta in Canada is named after her. Although the name \\"Louise\\" was originally planned, the princess wished to honour her dead father, so the last of her given names was chosen. Lake Louise in Alberta is also named after her, as is Mount Alberta. Although her time in Canada was not always happy, she liked the Canadian people and retained close links with her Canadian regiments. Back at home, she gained a reputation for paying unscheduled visits to hospitals, especially during her later years. Her relationship with her family was generally close. Although at times she bickered with the queen, and her sisters Helena and Beatrice, the relations did not remain strained for long. She retained a lifelong correspondence with her brother, Prince Arthur, and was one of King Edward VII's favourite sisters. Of all her siblings, she was closest to Prince Leopold, later Duke of Albany, and she was devastated by his death in 1884. Among the younger generations of the family, Louise's favourite relatives were the Duke and Duchess of Kent, her grandnephew and his wife. At the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937, Louise lent the Duchess the train that she designed and wore for the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra in 1902. A war hospital in Erskine, Scotland, is named after Louise. It took her name as she was the first patron of the unit. It was originally called Princess Louise Scottish Hospital for Limbless Sailors and Soldiers. The name changed over the years to Erskine Hospital and then just Erskine. The charity is close to its centenary year and has grown to become the biggest ex-service establishment in the country. = Art practice = Louise had artistic training from childhood, first with Susan Durant from 1864, then Mary Thornycroft from 1867, and further lessons with Edgar Boehm. She also then attended National Art Training School, or NATS, which marks the first time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was no training from the nude model, as there was for male art students. Louise held an account with the London artists‚Äô colourman Charles Roberson & Co. from April 1872 until February 1931, buying materials for oil and watercolour painting including numerous sketchbooks. Louise was the most artistically talented of Queen Victoria's daughters. As well as being an able actress, pianist and dancer, she was a prolific artist and sculptor. When Louise sculpted a statue of the queen, portraying her in Coronation robes, the press claimed that her tutor, Sir Edgar Boehm, was the true creator of the work. The claim was denied by Louise's friends, who asserted her effort and independence. The work was intended to be exhibited in 1887, but production was delayed until 1893. A memorial to her brother-in-law, Prince Henry of Battenberg, and a memorial to the Colonial soldiers who fell during the Boer War, reside at Whippingham Church on the Isle of Wight, and another statue of Queen Victoria remains at McGill University in Montreal, as well as the statue of Queen Victoria on the north side of Lichfield Cathedral.

He has had 23 novels published, and his short fiction has appeared in Analog Science Fiction and Fact, Amazing Stories, On Spec, Nature, and many anthologies. Sawyer has won the Nebula Award (1995), the Hugo Award (2003), and the John W. Campbell Memorial Award (2006). Sawyer was born in Ottawa, Ontario, and is now a resident of Mississauga.  Fiction  = Style and themes = Sawyer's work frequently explores the intersection between science and religion, with rationalism frequently winning out over mysticism (see especially Far-Seer, The Terminal Experiment, Calculating God, and the three volumes of the Neanderthal Parallax [Hominids, Humans, and Hybrids], plus the short story \\"The Abdication of Pope Mary III,\\" originally published in Nature, July 6, 2000). Sawyer often explores the notion of copied or uploaded human consciousness, mind uploading, most fully in his novel Mindscan, but also in Flashforward, Golden Fleece, The Terminal Experiment, \\"Identity Theft\\", \\"Biding Time\\", and \\"Shed Skin\\". His interest in consciousness studies is also apparent in Wake, which deals with the spontaneous emergence of consciousness in the infrastructure of the World Wide Web. His interest in quantum physics, and especially quantum computing, inform the short stories \\"You See But You Do Not Observe\\" (a Sherlock Holmes pastiche) and \\"Iterations,\\" and the novels Factoring Humanity and Hominids. SETI, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, plays a role in the plots of Golden Fleece, Factoring Humanity, Mindscan, Rollback, the novelette \\"Ineluctable,\\" and the short stories \\"You See But You Do Not Observe\\" and \\"Flashes.\\" Sawyer gives cosmology a thorough workout in his far-future Starplex. Real-life science institutions are often used as settings by Sawyer, including TRIUMF in End of an Era, CERN in Flashforward, the Royal Ontario Museum in Calculating God, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Hominids and its sequels, and the Arecibo Observatory in Rollback. Sawyer contributed a story called \\"The Hand You're Dealt\\" to the Libertarian SF anthology Free Space, and another called \\"The Right's Tough\\" to the Libertarian SF anthology Visions of Liberty. Sawyer's prose has been described by Orson Scott Card as near Isaac Asimovian in its clarity.  SF/mystery crossovers  Sawyer has won both Canada's top SF award (the Prix Aurora Award) and its top mystery-fiction award (the Arthur Ellis Award) for his 1993 short story \\"Just Like Old Times.\\" Illegal Alien is a courtroom drama with an extraterrestrial defendant; Hominids puts one Neanderthal on trial by his peers for the apparent murder of another Neanderthal; Mindscan has the rights of uploaded consciousnesses explored in a Michigan probate court; and Golden Fleece, Fossil Hunter, The Terminal Experiment, Frameshift, and Flashforward are all, in part, murder mysteries. Of Sawyer's shorter SF works, the novella \\"Identity Theft\\" and the short stories \\"Biding Time,\\" \\"Flashes,\\" \\"Iterations,\\" \\"Shed Skin,\\" \\"The Stanley Cup Caper,\\" \\"You See But You Do Not Observe,\\" \\"The Hand You're Dealt,\\" and the aforementioned \\"Just Like Old Times\\" are all also crime or mystery fiction.  Editing and scholarly work  In addition to his own writing, Sawyer edits the Robert J. Sawyer Books science-fiction imprint for Red Deer Press, part of Canadian publisher Fitzhenry & Whiteside; contributes to The New York Review of Science Fiction; is The Canadian Encyclopedia's authority on science fiction; and is a judge for L. Ron Hubbard's Writers of the Future contest. Sawyer continues to use a customized version of WordStar for DOS to write his novels.  Film and television  In May 2009, ABC ordered 13 episodes of hour-long dramatic TV series FlashForward for the 2009‚Äì2010 season, based on Sawyer's similarly titled novel, after successful production in February and March 2009 of a pilot episode scripted by David S. Goyer and Brannon Braga, directed by Goyer, and starring Joseph Fiennes and Sonya Walger. After some adjustments, the first season was set to consist of 22 episodes. Sawyer is story consultant on each episode of the series and wrote the 19th episode, titled \\"Course Correction\\". Sawyer wrote the original series bible for Charlie Jade, an hour- long science-fiction TV series that first aired in 2005‚Äì2006, and he did conceptual work in 2003 for reviving Robotech. He has also written and narrated documentaries about science fiction for CBC Radio's Ideas series, and he hosted the 17-part weekly half-hour documentary series Supernatural Investigator for Canada's Vision TV, which premiered January 27, 2009. He provided analysis of the British science fiction series Doctor Who for the CBC's online documentary The Planet of the Doctor, frequently comments on science fiction movies for TVOntario's Saturday Night at the Movies, and co- edited an essay collection in honor of the fortieth anniversary of Star Trek with David Gerrold, titled Boarding the Enterprise.  Teaching and public speaking  Sawyer has taught science-fiction writing at the University of Toronto, Ryerson University, Humber College, and the Banff Centre. In 2000, he served as Writer-in-Residence at the Richmond Hill, Ontario, Public Library. In 2003, he was Writer-in-Residence at the Toronto Public Library's Merril Collection of Science Fiction, Speculation and Fantasy (the first person to hold this post since Judith Merril herself in 1987). In 2006, he was Writer- in-Residence at the Odyssey Writing Workshop. Also in 2006, he was the Edna Staebler Writer-in-Residence at the Kitchener Public Library in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, following on the Region of Waterloo's choice of Sawyer's Hominids as the \\"One Book, One Community\\" title that all 490,000 residents were encouraged to read in 2005. In 2007 he was the Berton House Writer-in- Residence at Berton House in Dawson City. In 2009, he was the first-ever Writer-in-Residence at the Canadian Light Source, Canada's national synchrotron facility in Saskatoon. Sawyer is a frequent keynote speaker about technology topics, and has served as a consultant to Canada's Federal Department of Justice on the shape that future genetics laws should take.  Influence and recognition  Robert J. Sawyer on Bookbits radio. = Canadian = Sawyer has long been an advocate of Canadian science fiction. He lobbied hard for the creation of the Canadian Region of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America . The Canadian Region was established in 1992, and Sawyer served for three years on SFWA's Board of Directors as the first Canadian Regional Director (1992‚Äì1995). He also edited the newsletter of the Canadian Region, called Alouette in honor of Canada's first satellite; the newsletter was nominated for a Prix Aurora Award for best fanzine. Sawyer was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Letters from Laurentian University in 2007 and an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Winnipeg in 2014.\\"Five exceptional people to be honoured at Spring Convocation\\" (8 May 2014). NewsCentre, University of Winnipeg. Retrieved 20 May 2014. = International translations = In addition to his popularity at home, Sawyer's work is well received internationally. All of his novels have been issued by New York publishing houses and translated editions have appeared in Bulgarian, Chinese, Czech, Dutch, French, Hungarian, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, and Spanish. = Professional associations = In 1998, Sawyer was elected president of SFWA on a platform that promised a referendum on various contentious issues, including periodic membership requalification and the creation of a Nebula Award for best script; he won, defeating the next-closest candidate, past-SFWA-president Norman Spinrad, by a 3:2 margin. However, Sawyer's actual time in office was marked by considerable opposition to membership requalification and negative reaction to his dismissing, with the majority support of the Board of Directors, one paid SFWA worker and one volunteer. He resigned after completing half of his one-year term, and was automatically succeeded by then-incumbent vice-president Paul Levinson. Prior to resigning, Sawyer's promised referendum was held, resulting in significant changes to SFWA's bylaws and procedures, most notably allowing appropriate non-North American sales to count as membership credentials, allowing appropriate electronic sales to count as membership credentials, and creating a Nebula Award for best script. Sawyer has been active in other writers' organizations, including the Crime Writers of Canada, the Horror Writers Association, and the Writers' Union of Canada (for which he has served on the membership committee), and he is a member of scriptwriting unions Writers Guild of America and Writers Guild of Canada. = Major awards = * 1991 Prix Aurora Award for Best Long Work in English, for Golden Fleece * 1992 Homer Award for Best Novel, for Far-Seer * 1993 Arthur Ellis Award for Best Short Story, for \\"Just Like Old Times\\" * 1993 Homer Award for Best Novel, for Fossil Hunter * 1995 Le Grand Prix de l'Imaginaire for Best Foreign Short Story, \\"You See But You Do Not Observe\\" * 1995 Nebula Award for Best Novel, for The Terminal Experiment * 1995 Prix Aurora Award for Best Long Work in English, for The Terminal Experiment * 1996 Seiun Award for Best Foreign Novel, for End of an Era * 1996 Prix Aurora Award for Best Long Work in English, for Starplex * 1997 Science Fiction Chronicle Reader Award for Best Short Story, for \\"The Hand You're Dealt\\" * 1999 Prix Aurora Award for Best Long Work in English, for Flashforward * 2000 Seiun Award for Best Foreign Novel, for Frameshift * 2001 Hugo Award nominee in the Best Novel category for Calculating God * 2002 Seiun Award for Best Foreign Novel, for Illegal Alien * 2003 Hugo Award for Best Novel, for Hominids * 2005 Analog Analytical Laboratory Award for Best Short Story, for \\"Shed Skin\\" * 2005 Prix Aurora Award for Best Work in English (Other) for Relativity * 2006 John W.

He was born in Melilla and settled in France in 1955. Regarding his nationality, Arrabal describes himself as \\"desterrado\\", or \\"half-expatriate, half-exiled\\". Arrabal has directed seven full-length feature films and has published over 100 plays; 14 novels; 800 poetry collections, chapbooks, and artists' books; several essays; and his notorious \\"Letter to General Franco\\" during the dictator's lifetime. His complete plays have been published, in multiple languages, in a two-volume edition totaling over two thousand pages. The New York Times theatre critic Mel Gussow has called Arrabal the last survivor among the \\"three avatars of modernism\\". In 1962, Arrabal co-founded the Panic Movement with Alejandro Jodorowsky and Roland Topor, inspired by the god Pan. He was elected Transcendent Satrap of the Coll√®ge de Pataphysique in 1990. Forty other Transcendent Satraps have been elected over the past half-century, including Marcel Duchamp, Eug√®ne Ionesco, Man Ray, Boris Vian, Dario Fo, Umberto Eco, and Jean Baudrillard. Arrabal spent three years as a member of Andr√© Breton's surrealist group and was a friend of Andy Warhol and Tristan Tzara. Writer and critic Javier Villan wrote of Arrabal:  Childhood (1932‚Äì1946)  Arrabal (Ter√°n is his second family name) was born to Carmen Ter√°n Gonz√°lez and painter Fernando Arrabal Ruiz. On July 17, 1936, when insurrections within the military were staged against the constitutional government of the Second Spanish Republic, launching the Spanish Civil War, Arrabal's father remained faithful to the Republic and was sentenced to death for mutiny. His sentence was later commuted to 30 years‚Äô imprisonment. He was transferred between prisons, from Santi Espiritu in Melilla to Monte Hacho in Ceuta, where he attempted suicide, as well as Ciudad Rodrigo and Burgos. On December 4, 1941, he was sent to the Burgos Hospital due to apparent mental disorder. Later research has found that he likely feigned mental order in order to be transferred to a lower security prison. On December 29, 1941, he escaped from the hospital in his pajamas, despite three feet of snow covering the countryside. Despite extensive research, he was never seen again. About his father, Arrabal has written: ‚ÄúWithout trying to compare what is incomparable, when I confront these twilight episodes (and quite often without any logical connection), I often think of that scapegoat, my father. The day on which the Uncivil War began, he was locked up by his 'compassionate companions' in the flag room of the Melilla military barracks. He was meant to think carefully, since he risked a death sentence for mutiny if he did not join them in their insurrection (alzamiento). After an hour, Lieutenant Fernando Arrabal summoned his ex-comrades ‚Äì already! ‚Äì to inform them that he had pondered long enough. Today, because of this precedent, must I serve as witness, example, or symbol, as he did, of the most fundamental occurrences? I, who am a mere exile. If I am taken away from my beloved numerics, everything around me leads to over- the-counter confusion and disorder. I have no wish to be a scapegoat like my father, I only ask to die while still living, whenever Pan so wishes.‚Äù In 1936, Arrabal's mother returned to Ciudad Rodrigo with her young son, Fernando, and found a job at Burgos, then-capitol of the Nationalists and headquarters of General Franco's government. Fernando was enrolled in a local Catholic school from 1937 until 1940, when the Civil War ended and he moved with his mother to Madrid. Arrabal was awarded the national prize for gifted children in 1941. He continued his studies at Las Escuelas P√≠as de San Ant√≥n, a church school whose alumni have also included Victor Hugo and Jacinto Benavente y Mart√≠nez. Arrabal later studied at another distinguished Madrid school, Colegio Padres Escolapios De Getafe. He was an avid reader and was eager to experience life.  Youth and young adulthood (1946‚Äì1956)  In 1947, when his mother ordered him to attend preparatory classes for entrance to the Academia General Militar, Arrabal protested by playing hooky. She subsequently sent him to Tolosa (Gipuzkoa), where he studied business at the Escuela Te√≥rico-Pr√°ctica de la Industria y el Comercio del Papel, in 1949. By 1950, he had begun writing several plays, which remain unpublished. In 1951, Arrabal began working in the paper industry at La Papelera Espa√±ola. He moved to Valencia and passed his bachillerato, the first non-compulsory educational option in Spain for admission to university. He later moved to Madrid and began Legal Studies. During these years, he frequented the cultural institution Ateneo de Madrid and heard poets from the Postismo school. He was also finishing his early play Picnic, then titled The Soldiers, and writing El triciclo, at first titled Men with a Tricycle. In 1954, Arrabal hitchhiked to Paris to attend a performance of Bertolt Brecht‚Äôs Mother Courage and Her Children given by the touring Berliner Ensemble. Later that year, in Madrid, he met Luce Moreau, who became his wife. In 1955, he was awarded a three-month scholarship to study in Paris, during which time he lived at the Colegio de Espa√±a at the Cit√© Universitaire. While in Paris he suffered a serious relapse of tuberculosis. He considered this disease to be a \\"lucky mishap\\" that allowed him to move permanently to his \\"veritable homeland, that of Kundera and Vives, Saint Ignatius of Loyola and Picasso: exile.\\"  Politics  Arrabal had been known for being anti-Francoist and anti-monarchist and interested in anarchist trends in cultural production.Javier Vill√°n, El Mundo May 18, 2010, Lo de Arrabal es algo muy serio. Arrabal had a complicated relationship with Communism. He had ties with the Communist Party of Spain during his exile, but a rupture seems to have occurred in 1977 due to a conflict with his play The Architect and the Emperor of Assyria being performed in Barcelona with artists reputed to have Communist Party ties.  Awards and recognition  Arrabal was among the more controversial writers of his time, and his work has been recognized internationally. Awards include the Grand Prize for Theatre of the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise, the Premio Mariano de Cavia for journalism, the Nabokov Prize for novels, the Espasa Prize for essays, and the World Theater Prize. In 2001, he was nominated for the Premio Cervantes by Nobel Prize in Literature winner Camilo Jos√© Cela and Jos√© Hierro. He was reportedly a finalist for the Nobel Prize in 2005 due to the solicitation of several institutions and individuals. On July 14, 2005, he was named to France's L√©gion d'honneur. In 2007, he was awarded a doctorate of letters Honoris Causa by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in Greece.

Arrabal wrote of the opera, \\"Faustbal is a woman who, in the third millennium, is the reincarnation of Alfred Jarry's Doctor Faustroll, a new doctor Faust who asks God and Lucifer for words and prayers so that love and charity might be unified. Nothing can satisfy the hurricane of her scientific curiosity, nor calm the storms of her desires. A genius, very beautiful, and enriched by her transports and transfigurations, she vows a torrid love for her Amazon. She leaps between galaxies while the war to end all civilization rages, and moves through space at supersonic speed. Confronting her, Margarito, supreme leader of the armed forces, dons the armor of brutal, electronic repression. He is madly in love with Faustbal under the sky's cupola. He tries to possess her through the torrent of his tower, employing the services of Mephistopheles himself. Jes√∫s L√≥pez Cobos, music director of the Teatro Real de Madrid, will conduct the world premiere, which will be sung by sopranos Ana Ibarra and Mar√≠a Rodr√≠guez. The mezzo-soprano Cecilia Diaz will sing the role of the Amazon, while tenors Gerhard Siegel and Eduardo Santamar√≠a will be the two Margaritos, bass Stefano Palatchi will perform the role of God, and baritones Tomas Tomasson and Lauri Vasar will be Mephistopheles.‚Äù Four other operas with Arrabal's librettos have been staged, and the author describes them as \\"always having been as complex, yet suffering from as few complexes, as did Faustbal.\\" They are: *Apokaliptica, music by Milko Kelemen. *L‚Äôop√©ra de la Bastille, music by Marcel Landowski *Picknick im Felde, music by Constantinos Stylianou *Guernica, music by Ostfiend Busing In October 1985, Arrabal made his debut as an opera stage director at the Op√©ra Royal de Belgique, where he directed Manuel de Falla‚Äôs La vida breve and Enrique Granados‚Äô Goyescas. \\"Of course,\\" Arrabal commented, \\"under my direction the onstage chorus was nude, or to be more precise, panically covered with clay.‚Äù In 1994, Chamber Made produced the opera of Arrabal'sThe Two Executioners, with libretto by Douglas Horton and music by David Chesworth. The opera ran for two seasons in Melbourne, 1994 and 1996 at the Malthouse Theatre. Australia's The Independent Monthly wrote, \\"Easily the most impressive and memorable piece of music theatre in 1994.\\" = Novels = *Baal Babylone, 1959 (New York: Grove Press, 1960; Berlin: Luchterhand Literaturverlag, 1960; Milan: Lerici, 1960; Amsterdam: De Bezige Bij, 1972) *L'enterrement de la sardine (Julliard, 1961; The Burial of the Sardine, London: Calder and Boyars, 1966; El entierro de la sardina, Barcelona: Destino, 1984) *F√™tes et rites de la confusion (Madrid, Barcelona: Alfaguara, 1966; Riten und Feste der Konfusion, Stuttgart: Joseph Melzer, 1969) *La Tour prends garde (Paris: Grasset, 1983; La torre herida por el rayo, Barcelona: Destino, 1983; Destino libro, 1984; C√≠rculo de Lectores, 1984; A Torre ferida pelo Raio, Lisboa: Inquirito, 1982; Hohe T√ºrme trifft der Blitz, Colonia: Kiepenheuer & Witsch, 1986; The Tower Struck by Lightning, New York: Viking, 1988) *La Reverdie (Paris: Christian Bourgois, 1985) *La vierge rouge (Paris: Acropole, 1986; La virgen roja, Barcelona: Seix Barral, 1987; A Virgen Vermelha, Lisboa: Dom Quixote, 1987; A Virgen Vermelha, Botafogo: Nova Frontera, 1988; Die rote Jungfrau, G√∂ttingen: Steidl, 1990; The Red Virgin, New York, London: Penguin Books, 1993) *La fille de King-Kong (Paris: Acropole, 1988; La hija de King Kong, Barcelona: Seix Barral, 1988) *L' extravagante croisade d'un castrat amoureux (Paris: Ramsay, 1989; La extravagante cruzada de un castrado enamorado, Barcelona: Seix Barral, 1990) *La tueuse du jardin d'hiver (Paris: √âcriture, 1994) *Le funambule de Dieu (Paris: √âcriture, 1998) *Port√© disparu (Paris: Plon, 2000) *Champagne pour tous (Paris: Stock, 2002) *Como un para√≠so de locos (2008) = Artists' books = Arrabal has made over 700 artists' books in collaboration with Salvador Dal√≠, Ren√© Magritte, Roland Topor, Julius Baltazar, Antonio Saura, Olivier O.

It begins its course near Ver√≠n, Galicia, Spain, and flows to Portugal in the provinces of Tr√°s-os-Montes and Douro Litoral. The T√¢mega as it passes through Chaves The T√¢mega River is a tributary of the Douro River. From Ver√≠n, it flows south to Portuguese city of Chaves; then it flows through a fertile valley called the Veiga. Below Chaves the river narrows to pass through mountains and valleys. Owing to low water level and frequent small dams it is not navigable, passing through the cities of Amarante and Marco de Canaveses, flowing in the Douro River, near Entre-os-Rios: in fact Entre-os- Rios means between the rivers. The T√¢mega is more important historically than economically. It has always served as an invasion route for foreign armies intent on reaching the richer southern lands of Portugal. The valley around Chaves has especially seen its share of battles and invading armies. Like many rivers, the T√¢mega suffers from pollution and the ravages of sand and gravel extraction companies. The quality of the water has deteriorated greatly. Another problem is the periodic occurrence of flooding. Since the completion of the Torr√£o dam in 1988 less than 1 kilometre above the Douro river and the town of Entre-os-Rios in the municipality of Marco de Canaveses, the T√¢mega has been recovering slowly from the effects of pollution. Sand extraction activities have been prohibited and many upstream cities installed modern sewage treatment plants. A new dam is planned between the city of Amarante and the town of Mondim de Basto. Besides producing electricity, the project will have feature a flood control system that will divert the waterflow towards the smaller Olo River. Transport The T√¢mega line, which closed in 2009, was a narrow gauge railway line which closely followed the river.

Globes serve purposes similar to some maps, but unlike maps, do not distort the surface that they portray except to scale it down. A model globe of Earth is called a terrestrial globe. A model globe of the celestial sphere is called a celestial globe. A globe shows details of its subject. A terrestrial globe shows landmasses and water bodies. It might show nations and major cities and the network of latitude and longitude lines. Some have raised relief to show mountains and other large landforms. A celestial globe shows notable stars, and may also show positions of other prominent astronomical objects. Typically, it will also divide the celestial sphere into constellations. The word globe comes from the Latin word globus, meaning \\"sphere\\". Globes have a long history. The first known mention of a globe is from Strabo, describing the Globe of Crates from about 150 BC. The oldest surviving terrestrial globe is the Erdapfel, wrought by Martin Behaim in 1492. The oldest surviving celestial globe sits atop the Farnese Atlas, carved in the 2nd century Roman Empire. Terrestrial and planetary Flat maps are created using a map projection that inevitably introduces an increasing amount of distortion the larger the area that the map shows. A globe is the only representation of the Earth that does not distort either the shape or the size of large features ‚Äì land masses, bodies of water, etc. The Earth's circumference is quite close to 40 million metres.The Earth‚Äôs circumference is 40 million m because the metre was originally defined to be one 10-millionth of the distance between the poles and the equator.Arc length#Arcs of great circles on the Earth Many globes are made with a circumference of one metre, so they are models of the Earth at a scale of 1:40 million. In imperial units, many globes are made with a diameter of one foot (about 30 cm), yielding a circumference of 3.14 feet (about 96 cm) and a scale of 1:42 million. Globes are also made in many other sizes. Some globes have surface texture showing topography or bathymetry. In these, elevations and depressions are purposely exaggerated, as they otherwise would be hardly visible. For example, one manufacturer produces a three dimensional raised relief globe with a diameter (equivalent to a 200 cm circumference, or approximately a scale of 1:20 million) showing the highest mountains as over tall, which is about 57 times higher than the correct scale of Mount Everest.MapScaping p√• Twitter: \\"3D topographic globe at Stanford's Branner Library.\\"The GEO One 25\\" Extreme Raised Relief Classroom Floor Globe Most modern globes are also imprinted with parallels and meridians, so that one can tell the approximate coordinates of a specific place. Globes may also show the boundaries of countries and their names. Many terrestrial globes have one celestial feature marked on them: a diagram called the analemma, which shows the apparent motion of the Sun in the sky during a year. Globes generally show north at the top, but many globes allow the axis to be swiveled so that southern portions can be viewed conveniently. This capability also permits exploring the Earth from different orientations to help counter the north-up bias caused by conventional map presentation. Celestial Coronelli for Louis XIV c.1683 Celestial globes show the apparent positions of the stars in the sky. They omit the Sun, Moon and planets because the positions of these bodies vary relative to those of the stars, but the ecliptic, along which the Sun moves, is indicated. History Germanisches National Museum, Nuremberg (2006) The sphericity of the Earth was established by Greek astronomy in the 3rd century BC, and the earliest terrestrial globe appeared from that period. The earliest known example is the one constructed by Crates of Mallus in Cilicia (now √áukurova in modern-day Turkey), in the mid-2nd century BC. No terrestrial globes from Antiquity or the Middle Ages have survived. An example of a surviving celestial globe is part of a Hellenistic sculpture, called the Farnese Atlas, surviving in a 2nd-century AD Roman copy in the Naples Archaeological Museum, Italy.Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 2003. Early terrestrial globes depicting the entirety of the Old World were constructed in the Islamic world.Medieval Islamic Civilization By Josef W. Meri, Jere L Bacharach, pages 138‚Äì139 According to David Woodward, one such example was the terrestrial globe introduced to Beijing by the Persian astronomer, Jamal ad- Din, in 1267. The earliest extant terrestrial globe was made in 1492 by Martin Behaim (1459‚Äì1537) with help from the painter Georg Glockendon. Behaim was a German mapmaker, navigator, and merchant. Working in Nuremberg, Germany, he called his globe the \\"N√ºrnberg Terrestrial Globe.\\" It is now known as the Erdapfel. Before constructing the globe, Behaim had traveled extensively. He sojourned in Lisbon from 1480, developing commercial interests and mingling with explorers and scientists. He began to construct his globe after his return to N√ºrnberg in 1490. Another early globe, the Hunt‚ÄìLenox Globe, ca. 1510, is thought to be the source of the phrase Hic Sunt Dracones, or ‚ÄúHere be dragons‚Äù. A similar grapefruit-sized globe made from two halves of an ostrich egg was found in 2012 and is believed to date from 1504. It may be the oldest globe to show the New World. Stefaan Missine, who analyzed the globe for the Washington Map Society journal Portolan, said it was ‚Äúpart of an important European collection for decades.‚Äù After a year of research in which he consulted many experts, Missine concluded the Hunt‚ÄìLenox Globe was a copper cast of the egg globe. A facsimile globe showing America was made by Martin Waldseemueller in 1507. Another \\"remarkably modern-looking\\" terrestrial globe of the Earth was constructed by Taqi al-Din at the Constantinople Observatory of Taqi ad-Din during the 1570s. The world's first seamless celestial globe was built by Mughal scientists under the patronage of Jahangir. Globus IMP, electro-mechanical devices including five-inch globes have been used in Soviet and Russian spacecraft from 1961 to 2002 as navigation instruments. In 2001, the TMA version of the Soyuz spacecraft replaced this instrument with a digital map. In the 1800s small pocket globes (less than 3 inches) were status symbols for gentlemen and educational toys for rich children. Manufacture Traditionally, globes were manufactured by gluing a printed paper map onto a sphere, often made from wood. The most common type has long, thin gores (strips) of paper that narrow to a point at the poles, small disks cover over the inevitable irregularities at these points. The more gores there are, the less stretching and crumpling is required to make the paper map fit the sphere. This method of globe making was illustrated in 1802 in an engraving in The English Encyclopedia by George Kearsley . Modern globes are often made from thermoplastic. Flat, plastic disks are printed with a distorted map of one of the Earth's Hemispheres. This is placed in a machine which molds the disk into a hemispherical shape. The hemisphere is united with its opposite counterpart to form a complete globe. Usually a globe is mounted so that its rotation axis is 23.5¬∞ (0.41 rad) from vertical, which is the angle the Earth's rotation axis deviates from perpendicular to the plane of its orbit. This mounting makes it easy to visualize how seasons change.

Two editions existed during Hitler's lifetime, created during the mid-1930s on his orders. (The second edition changed the name of Abyssinia to Italian East Africa). These globes were ‚Äúenormous‚Äù and very costly. According to the New York Times, \\"the real Columbus globe was nearly the size of a Volkswagen and, at the time, more expensive.\\" Several still exist, including three in Berlin: one at a geographical institute, one at the M√§rkisches Museum, and another at the Deutsches Historisches Museum. The latter has a Soviet bullet hole through Germany. One of the two in public collections in Munich has an American bullet hole through Germany. There are several in private hands inside and out of Germany.

Eric Drexler, is a \\"proposed device able to guide chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision\\". A molecular assembler is a kind of molecular machine. Some biological molecules such as ribosomes fit this definition. This is because they receive instructions from messenger RNA and then assemble specific sequences of amino acids to construct protein molecules. However, the term \\"molecular assembler\\" usually refers to theoretical human-made devices. A ribosome is a biological machine. Beginning in 2007, the British Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council has funded development of ribosome-like molecular assemblers. Clearly, molecular assemblers are possible in this limited sense. A technology roadmap project, led by the Battelle Memorial Institute and hosted by several U.S. National Laboratories has explored a range of atomically precise fabrication technologies, including both early- generation and longer-term prospects for programmable molecular assembly; the report was released in December, 2007. In 2008 the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council provided funding of 1.5 million pounds over six years for research working towards mechanized mechanosynthesis, in partnership with the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, amongst others. Likewise, the term \\"molecular assembler\\" has been used in science fiction and popular culture to refer to a wide range of fantastic atom-manipulating nanomachines, many of which may be physically impossible in reality. Much of the controversy regarding \\"molecular assemblers\\" results from the confusion in the use of the name for both technical concepts and popular fantasies. In 1992, Drexler introduced the related but better-understood term \\"molecular manufacturing\\", which he defined as the programmed \\"chemical synthesis of complex structures by mechanically positioning reactive molecules, not by manipulating individual atoms\\". This article mostly discusses \\"molecular assemblers\\" in the popular sense. These include hypothetical machines that manipulate individual atoms and machines with organism-like self-replicating abilities, mobility, ability to consume food, and so forth. These are quite different from devices that merely (as defined above) \\"guide chemical reactions by positioning reactive molecules with atomic precision\\". Because synthetic molecular assemblers have never been constructed and because of the confusion regarding the meaning of the term, there has been much controversy as to whether \\"molecular assemblers\\" are possible or simply science fiction. Confusion and controversy also stem from their classification as nanotechnology, which is an active area of laboratory research which has already been applied to the production of real products; however, there had been, until recently, no research efforts into the actual construction of \\"molecular assemblers\\". Nonetheless, a 2013 paper by David Leigh's group, published in the journal Science, details a new method of synthesizing a peptide in a sequence-specific manner by using an artificial molecular machine that is guided by a molecular strand. This functions in the same way as a ribosome building proteins by assembling amino acids according to a messenger RNA blueprint. The structure of the machine is based on a rotaxane, which is a molecular ring sliding along a molecular axle. The ring carries a thiolate group which removes amino acids in sequence from the axle, transferring them to a peptide assembly site. In 2018, the same group published a more advanced version of this concept in which the molecular ring shuttles along a polymeric track to assemble an oligopeptide that can fold into a Œ±-helix that can perform the enantioselective epoxidation of a chalcone derivative (in a way reminiscent to the ribosome assembling an enzyme). In another paper published in Science in March 2015, chemists at the University of Illinois report a platform that automates the synthesis of 14 classes of small molecules, with thousands of compatible building blocks. In 2017 David Leigh's group reported a molecular robot that could be programmed to construct any one of four different stereoisomers of a molecular product by using a nanomechanical robotic arm to move a molecular substrate between different reactive sites of an artificial molecular machine. An accompanying News and Views article, titled ‚ÄòA molecular assembler‚Äô, outlined the operation of the molecular robot as effectively a prototypical molecular assembler. Nanofactories A nanofactory is a proposed system in which nanomachines (resembling molecular assemblers, or industrial robot arms) would combine reactive molecules via mechanosynthesis to build larger atomically precise parts. These, in turn, would be assembled by positioning mechanisms of assorted sizes to build macroscopic (visible) but still atomically-precise products. A typical nanofactory would fit in a desktop box, in the vision of K. Eric Drexler published in Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing and Computation (1992), a notable work of \\"exploratory engineering\\". During the 1990s, others have extended the nanofactory concept, including an analysis of nanofactory convergent assembly by Ralph Merkle, a systems design of a replicating nanofactory architecture by J. Storrs Hall, Forrest Bishop's \\"Universal Assembler\\", the patented exponential assembly process by Zyvex, and a top-level systems design for a 'primitive nanofactory' by Chris Phoenix (Director of Research at the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology). All of these nanofactory designs (and more) are summarized in Chapter 4 of Kinematic Self-Replicating Machines (2004) by Robert Freitas and Ralph Merkle. The Nanofactory Collaboration, founded by Freitas and Merkle in 2000, is a focused ongoing effort involving 23 researchers from 10 organizations and 4 countries that is developing a practical research agenda specifically aimed at positionally-controlled diamond mechanosynthesis and diamondoid nanofactory development. In 2005, a computer-animated short film of the nanofactory concept was produced by John Burch, in collaboration with Drexler. Such visions have been the subject of much debate, on several intellectual levels. No one has discovered an insurmountable problem with the underlying theories and no one has proved that the theories can be translated into practice. However, the debate continues, with some of it being summarized in the molecular nanotechnology article. If nanofactories could be built, severe disruption to the world economy would be one of many possible negative impacts, though it could be argued that this disruption would have little negative effect if everyone had such nanofactories. Great benefits also would be anticipated. Various works of science fiction have explored these and similar concepts. The potential for such devices was part of the mandate of a major UK study led by mechanical engineering professor Dame Ann Dowling. Self-replication \\"Molecular assemblers\\" have been confused with self- replicating machines. To produce a practical quantity of a desired product, the nanoscale size of a typical science fiction universal molecular assembler requires an extremely large number of such devices. However, a single such theoretical molecular assembler might be programmed to self-replicate, constructing many copies of itself. This would allow an exponential rate of production. Then after sufficient quantities of the molecular assemblers were available, they would then be re-programmed for production of the desired product. However, if self-replication of molecular assemblers were not restrained then it might lead to competition with naturally occurring organisms. This has been called ecophagy or the grey goo problem. One method to building molecular assemblers is to mimic evolutionary processes employed by biological systems. Biological evolution proceeds by random variation combined with culling of the less-successful variants and reproduction of the more-successful variants. Production of complex molecular assemblers might be evolved from simpler systems since \\"A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. . . . A complex system designed from scratch never works and can not be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a system that works.\\" Gall, John, (1986) Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail, 2nd ed. Ann Arbor, MI : The General Systemantics Press. However, most published safety guidelines include \\"recommendations against developing ... replicator designs which permit surviving mutation or undergoing evolution\\". Most assembler designs keep the \\"source code\\" external to the physical assembler. At each step of a manufacturing process, that step is read from an ordinary computer file and \\"broadcast\\" to all the assemblers. If any assembler gets out of range of that computer, or when the link between that computer and the assemblers is broken, or when that computer is unplugged, the assemblers stop replicating. Such a \\"broadcast architecture\\" is one of the safety features recommended by the \\"Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology\\", and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous practical methods by which replicators can be safely controlled by good design. Drexler and Smalley debate One of the most outspoken critics of some concepts of \\"molecular assemblers\\" was Professor Richard Smalley (1943‚Äì2005) who won the Nobel prize for his contributions to the field of nanotechnology. Smalley believed that such assemblers were not physically possible and introduced scientific objections to them. His two principal technical objections were termed the \\"fat fingers problem\\" and the \\"sticky fingers problem\\". He believed these would exclude the possibility of \\"molecular assemblers\\" that worked by precision picking and placing of individual atoms. Drexler and coworkers responded to these two issues in a 2001 publication. Smalley also believed that Drexler's speculations about apocalyptic dangers of self-replicating machines that have been equated with \\"molecular assemblers\\" would threaten the public support for development of nanotechnology. To address the debate between Drexler and Smalley regarding molecular assemblers Chemical & Engineering News published a point- counterpoint consisting of an exchange of letters that addressed the issues. Regulation Speculation on the power of systems that have been called \\"molecular assemblers\\" has sparked a wider political discussion on the implication of nanotechnology. This is in part due to the fact that nanotechnology is a very broad term and could include \\"molecular assemblers\\". Discussion of the possible implications of fantastic molecular assemblers has prompted calls for regulation of current and future nanotechnology. There are very real concerns with the potential health and ecological impact of nanotechnology that is being integrated in manufactured products. Greenpeace for instance commissioned a report concerning nanotechnology in which they express concern into the toxicity of nanomaterials that have been introduced in the environment.Future Technologies, Today‚Äôs Choices Nanotechnology, Artificial Intelligence and Robotics; A technical, political and institutional map of emerging technologies. A report for the Greenpeace Environmental Trust However, it makes only passing references to \\"assembler\\" technology. The UK Royal Society and Royal Academy of Engineering also commissioned a report entitled \\"Nanoscience and nanotechnologies: opportunities and uncertainties\\" regarding the larger social and ecological implications on nanotechnology. This report does not discuss the threat posed by potential so-called \\"molecular assemblers\\". Formal scientific review In 2006, U.S. National Academy of Sciences released the report of a study of molecular manufacturing as part of a longer report, A Matter of Size: Triennial Review of the National Nanotechnology Initiative The study committee reviewed the technical content of Nanosystems, and in its conclusion states that no current theoretical analysis can be considered definitive regarding several questions of potential system performance, and that optimal paths for implementing high-performance systems cannot be predicted with confidence. It recommends experimental research to advance knowledge in this area: :\\"Although theoretical calculations can be made today, the eventually attainable range of chemical reaction cycles, error rates, speed of operation, and thermodynamic efficiencies of such bottom-up manufacturing systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Thus, the eventually attainable perfection and complexity of manufactured products, while they can be calculated in theory, cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, the optimum research paths that might lead to systems which greatly exceed the thermodynamic efficiencies and other capabilities of biological systems cannot be reliably predicted at this time. Research funding that is based on the ability of investigators to produce experimental demonstrations that link to abstract models and guide long-term vision is most appropriate to achieve this goal.\\" Grey goo One potential scenario that has been envisioned is out-of-control self-replicating molecular assemblers in the form of grey goo which consumes carbon to continue its replication. If unchecked such mechanical replication could potentially consume whole ecoregions or the whole Earth (ecophagy), or it could simply outcompete natural lifeforms for necessary resources such as carbon, ATP, or UV light (which some nanomotor examples run on). However, the ecophagy and 'grey goo' scenarios, like synthetic molecular assemblers, are based upon still-hypothetical technologies that have not yet been demonstrated experimentally.

Aileen Stanley, born Maude Elsie Aileen Muggeridge (March 21, 1893 ‚Äì March 24, 1982), was one of the most popular American singers of the early 1920s. Early life Born in Chicago, Illinois, Stanley was the youngest of four children of English parents Robert S. and Maria (n√©e Capewell) Muggeridge who had immigrated from England in 1887. Her sister Elsie Muggeridge, died of typhoid in August 1892, passing it on to their father who died of the disease seven months before Aileen's birth. Her widowed mother resided in Chicago along with her surviving siblings, brothers Stanley and Robert Jr. Performances and recordings From childhood, she sang and danced in vaudeville with her older brother Stanley as Stanley and Aileen, with the encouragement of their widowed mother. After her brother left the act, Aileen started performing solo, forming her stage name by reversing the name of the old family billing. Stanley performed in vaudeville and cabarets. In 1920 she was a hit in New York City in the revue show Silks And Satins and made the first of her numerous recordings the same year. The majority of her records in the '20s were for the Victor Talking Machine Company, but she also recorded with other labels with recording studios in the New York City area, including Edison, Pathe, Okeh, Brunswick, Vocalion, Gennett and others. On some of her early recordings she was accompanied by Rosario Bourdon's Orchestra. Many of her records sold well at the time. According to Joel Whitman, her most successful early recordings included \\"My Mammy\\" (1921), \\"Sweet Indiana Home\\" (1922), both written by Walter Donaldson; she also recorded other Walter Donaldson songs including \\"My Little Bimbo Down on a Bamboo Isle\\" (1920), \\"Dixie Highway\\" (1922), \\"Carolina in the Morning\\" (1922), \\"Back Where The Daffodils Grow\\" (1924), and \\"Don't be angry with me\\" (1926).http://adp.library.ucsb.edu/index.php/talent/detail/29868/Stanley_Aileen_vocalist_soprano_vocal Between 1922 and 1924, and again in the late '20s, Victor Records produced a popular series of records pairing Stanley with singer Billy Murray. One of Stanley's 1925 Victor recordings, \\"When My Sugar Walks Down the Street\\", in which she shared the vocal with newcomer Gene Austin, helped launch Austin's illustrious career.Shilkret, Nathaniel, ed. Niel Shell and Barbara Shilkret, Nathaniel Shilkret: Sixty Years in the Music Business, Scarecrow Press, Lanham, Maryland, 2005, pp. 73--74. She recorded J. Russel Robinson and Con Conrad's 1920 jazz standard \\"Singin' the Blues\\", released as Victor 18703. She recorded the Paul Whiteman and Fred Rose composition \\"Flamin' Mamie\\" on October 5, 1925, and released it as Victor 19828-A accompanied on ukulele by Billy \\"Uke\\" Carpenter who provided \\"jazz effects\\". Stanley also recorded for Black Swan Records, a label purportedly devoted only to African-American artists, under the pseudonyms Mamie Jones and Georgia Gorham. Her handling of blues material was similar to that of some of the northern black vaudeville singers of the time. Her stage appearances billed her as \\"The Phonograph Girl\\" and \\"The Girl With The Personality.\\" In later life she was overheard to say that the song \\"I'll Get By\\" was written for her. Later life Stanley was said to have invested heavily in the stock market and was one of the many who lost most of their life's savings in the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Around 1931 Stanley moved to London, where she made more records for HMV from 1934 through 1937, and once confided \\"strictly entre nous\\" that she unwittingly ended her own romance when she introduced Wallis Simpson to Edward, Prince of Wales, at the home of Thelma, Lady Furness. In her later years she worked as a singing teacher and vocal coach. She died in 1982 in Los Angeles, California, aged 89, and was buried (under the name Aileen Stanley Muggeridge) at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale.

Van Dyke was a subsidiary of Grey Gull Records of Boston, Massachusetts and releases duplicated material found on the parent label. Despite claims of quality found on the label, the record was cheaply manufactured, and marketed to record dealers as a budget record with a high profit margin for the dealer. Accordingly the playing surface is noisy, and the recordings are often over- modulated. Other than jazz by Clarence Williams and Cliff Jackson, most Van Dyke records were dance band numbers by Grey Gull's house band,, which included Mike Mosiello, Andy Sannella, and Charles Magnante. The text on the label of Van Dyke 78 discs proclaimed \\"Each Record a Masterpiece\\". An unusual feature of the Van Dyke label was that the four-digit matrix number was split between two lines on the left side. Initially the Van Dyke catalog number mirrored the Grey Gull catalog number, with an added \\"7\\" or \\"8\\" appended to the beginning. By its second year of existence the couplings no longer matched the parent company, and there was no relation between Van Dyke's numbering (now divided into several separate numbering blocks) and Grey Gull's. Nonetheless, all material continued to originate from Grey Gull. There was some effort made to obscure the origins of Van Dyke. When Grey Gull ceased operations in 1930, Van Dyke records also were no longer produced. However, substantial quantities of the product were exported to England over the next few years, by an unknown distributor.

The shrine does not contain the emperor's grave, which is located at Fushimi-momoyama, south of Kyoto. History Meiji under construction in 1920 After the emperor's death in 1912, the Japanese Diet passed a resolution to commemorate his role in the Meiji Restoration. An iris garden in an area of Tokyo where Emperor Meiji and Empress Sh≈çken had been known to visit was chosen as the building's location. Construction began in 1915 under It≈ç Ch≈´ta, and the shrine was built in the traditional nagare-zukuri style, using primarily Japanese cypress and copper. The building of the shrine was a national project, mobilizing youth groups and other civic associations from throughout Japan, who contributed labor and funding. The main timbers came from Kiso in Nagano, and Alishan in Taiwan, then a Japanese territory, with materials being utilized from every Japanese prefecture, including Karafuto, Korea, Kwantung, and Taiwan. It was estimated that the cost of the construction was ¬•5,219,00 in 1920 (approximately US$26 million today), about a quarter of the actual cost due to the donated materials and labor. It was formally dedicated on November 3, 1920, completed in 1921, and its grounds officially finished by 1926. The interior volume of the shrine complex when originally built was 650 tsubo. Until 1946, the Meiji Shrine was officially designated one of the Kanpei-taisha (), meaning that it stood in the first rank of government supported shrines.Ponsonby-Fane, Richard. (1959). The Imperial House of Japan, p. 126. The original building was destroyed during the Tokyo air raids of World War II. The present iteration of the shrine was funded through a public fund raising effort and completed in October 1958. Meiji Shrine has been visited by numerous foreign politicians, including United States President George W. Bush, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. On the eve of new year, Japanese usually visit a Shinto shrine to prepare for the worship - Hatsum≈çde (ÂàùË©£) of the new year. Meiji Shrine is the most popular location in Japan for hatsum≈çde. Shrine complex An aerial photograph of Meiji Shrine and Yoyogi Park (1989) Meiji Shrine is located in a forest that covers an area of . This area is covered by an evergreen forest that consists of 120,000 trees of 365 different species, which were donated by people from all parts of Japan when the shrine was established. The forest is visited by many as a recreation and relaxation area in the center of Tokyo. The entrance to the shrine complex leads through the Jingu Bashi bridge. Meiji Shrine is adjacent to Yoyogi Park which together is a large forested area. The entrances open at sunrise and close at sunset. The shrine itself is composed of two major areas: =Naien= The Naien is the inner precinct, which is centered on the shrine buildings and includes a treasure museum that houses articles of the Emperor and Empress. The treasure museum is built in the Azekurazukuri style. =Gaien= The Gaien is the outer precinct, which includes the Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery that houses a collection of 80 large murals illustrative of the events in the lives of the Emperor and his consort. It also includes a variety of sports facilities, including the national stadiums (Meiji Jingu Gaien Stadium, National Stadium, and the newer National Stadium), and the Meiji Memorial Hall (Meiji Kinenkan), which was originally used for governmental meetings, including discussions surrounding the drafting of the Meiji Constitution in the late 19th century. Today it is used for Shinto weddings as well as meeting rooms rent and restaurants services.

DC superheroes such as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Green Lantern, Aquaman, and Booster Gold are from this universe, and it also contains well-known supervillains such as Lex Luthor, the Joker, Brainiac, Gorilla Grodd, Sinestro, Deathstroke, Cheetah, and Darkseid. In context, the term \\"DC Universe\\" usually refers to the main DC continuity. The term \\"DC Multiverse\\" refers to the collection of all continuities within DC Comics publications. Within the Multiverse, the main DC Universe has gone by many names, but in recent years has been referred to by \\"Prime Earth\\" (not to be confused with \\"Earth Prime\\") or \\"Earth 0\\". The main DC Universe, as well as the alternate realities related to it, began as the first shared universe in comic books and were quickly adapted to other media such as film serials or radio dramas. In subsequent decades, the continuity between all of these media became increasingly complex with certain storylines and events designed to simplify or streamline the more confusing aspects of characters' histories. History =Golden Age= The fact that DC Comics characters coexisted in the same world was first established in All Star Comics #3 (1940) where several superheroes (who starred in separate stories in the series up to that point) met each other in a group dubbed the Justice Society of America. Subsequently, the Justice Society was reintroduced as the Justice League of America, which was founded with Major League Baseball's National League and American League as inspiration for the name. The comic book that introduced the Justice League was titled The Brave and the Bold. However, the majority of National/DC's publications continued to be written with little regard of maintaining continuity with each other for the first few decades. =Silver Age= Over the course of its publishing history, DC has introduced different versions of its characters, sometimes presenting them as if the earlier version had never existed, among them the Flash, Green Lantern, and Hawkman, in the late 1950s, with similar powers but different names and personal histories. Similarly, they had characters such as Batman whose early adventures set in the 1940s could not easily be reconciled with stories featuring a still-youthful man in the 1970s. To explain this, they introduced the idea of the Multiverse in Flash #123 (1961) where the Silver Age Flash met his Golden Age counterpart. In addition to allowing the conflicting stories to \\"co-exist\\", it allowed the differing versions of characters to meet, and even team up to combat cross-universe threats. The writers gave designations such as \\"Earth-One\\", \\"Earth-Two\\", and so forth, to certain universes, designations which at times were also used by the characters themselves. Earth-One was the primary world of this publication era. =Crisis on Infinite Earths= Over the years, as the number of titles published increased and the volume of past stories accumulated, it became increasingly difficult to maintain internal consistency. In the face of diminishing sales, maintaining the status quo of their most popular characters became attractive. Weldon, Glen (2016). The Caped Crusade: Batman and the Rise of Nerd Culture. Simon & Schuster. . Retrieved 10 September 2017. Although retcons were used as a way to explain apparent inconsistencies in stories written, editors at DC came to consider the varied continuity of multiple Earths too difficult to keep track of, and feared that it was an obstacle to accessibility for new readers. To address this, they published the cross-universe miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985, which merged universes and characters, reducing the Multiverse to a single unnamed universe with a single history.Crisis (1986) #11 However, not all the books rebooted post-Crisis. For example, the Legion of Superheroes book acted as if the Pre-Crisis Earth-1 history was still their past, a point driven home in the Cosmic Boy miniseries. It also removed the mechanism DC had been using to deal with continuity glitches or storylines that a later writer wanted to ignore (which is how Earths B and E came into existence) resulting in a convoluted explanation for characters like Hawkman. The Zero Hour limited series (1994) gave them an opportunity to revise timelines and rewrite the DC Universe history. However this failed right out of the gate as the writers had Waverider state all alternate histories had been wiped and yet have the Armageddon 2001 saga in the timeline which required multiple timelines to work. As a result, almost once per decade since the 1980s, the DC Universe experiences a major crisis that allows any number of changes from new versions of characters to appear as a whole reboot of the universe, restarting nominally all the characters into a new and modernized version of their lives. Meanwhile, DC has published occasional stories called Elseworlds, which often presented alternate versions of its characters. One told the story of Bruce Wayne as a Green Lantern. In another tale, Superman: Speeding Bullets, the rocket ship that brought the infant Superman to Earth was discovered by the Wayne family of Gotham City rather than the Kents. In 1999, The Kingdom reintroduced a variant of the old Multiverse concept called Hypertime which essentially allows for alternate versions of characters and worlds again. The entire process was possibly inspired by Alan Moore's meta-comic, Supreme: Story of the Year (1997). The Convergence (2015) crossover officially retconned the events of Crisis after heroes in that series went back in time to prevent the collapse of the Multiverse.Vaneta Rogers (27 May 2015)\\"MAJOR SPOILERS: DC's CONVERGENCE Concludes, Undoes [Redacted\\" Newsarama] However, Brainiac states \\"Each world has evolved but they all still exist\\".Convergence #8 It has been confirmed that all previous worlds and timelines now exist, and that there are even multiple Multiverses now in existence, such as the Pre- Crisis infinite Multiverse, the collapsed Earth, and the Pre-New 52 52 worlds Multiverse. =Infinite Crisis= The Infinite Crisis event (2005‚Äì2006) remade the DC Universe yet again, with new changes. The limited series 52 (2006‚Äì2007) established that a new multiverse now existed, with Earth-0 as the primary Earth. =The New 52= The 2011 reboot of the DC Universe coincided with DC's publishing event The New 52, during which the publisher cancelled its ongoing titles and relaunched 52 new books, including a number of new books, set within a revised continuity. This follows the conclusion of the Flashpoint crossover storyline, which provided a jumping-off point for the existing continuity. A number of in-universe changes are intended to make characters more modern and accessible, though the scope of the changes varies from character to character. Some like Batman have their histories left largely intact, though compressed, while others were given wildly different histories and looks. DC stopped putting 'The New 52' logo on its publications in the summer of 2015, coinciding with the Convergence anniversary crossover event which celebrated the history of the DC Multiverse and its various incarnations. =DC Rebirth= In February 2016, DC announced its DC Rebirth initiative, a line-wide relaunch of its titles, to begin in June 2016. Beginning with an 80-page one-shot which was released on May 25, 2016, DC Rebirth also sees Action Comics and Detective Comics return to their previous numbering (#957 and #934 respectively), all books releasing at , multiple books shifting to a twice-monthly release schedule, a number of existing titles relaunching with new #1s, and the release of several new titles. DC has used the Green Lantern: Rebirth and The Flash: Rebirth miniseries as examples of the basis for the initiative, which has been described as a rebirth of the DC Universe. The DC Rebirth initiative will reintroduce concepts from pre- Flashpoint continuity, such as legacy, that have been lost with The New 52 and build \\"on everything that's been published since Action Comics #1 up thru The New 52.\\" =DC Universe= In October 2017, DC revealed that they would be discontinuing the Rebirth branding and logo from their titles in December 2017, releasing everything under a single umbrella title as the DC Universe. Coincided with the release of the New Age of Heroes imprint, DiDio explained, \\"We want to make it clear that this is all the DC Universe... Rebirth pretty much the DCU now; while we're taking Rebirth off the books, we'll be following the direction that Rebirth established.\\" Titles also received new trade dress, with those \\"that tie in clearly to our larger DC Universe\\" having a \\"DCU logo on them\\" in addition to corner boxes with icons of the characters to help identify the family of titles; titles outside the DCU, such as Injustice: Gods Among Us and DC Bombshells would simply have the DC logo on them. DiDio also added that the Young Animal imprint would continue as a separate line of titles. Description A \\"class photo\\" of DC Universe characters, circa 1986. In this group shot, each character is drawn by either his or her original artist or an artist closely associated with the character. The basic concept of the DC Universe is that it is just like the real world, but with superheroes and supervillains existing in it. However, there are other corollary differences resulting from the justifications implied by that main concept. Many fictional countries, such as Qurac, Vlatava, and Zandia, exist in it. Though stories are often set in the United States of America, they are as often as not set in fictional cities, such as Gotham City or Metropolis. These cities are effectively archetypes of cities, with Gotham City embodying more of the negative aspects of life in a large city, and Metropolis reflecting more of the positive aspects. Sentient alien species (such as Kryptonians and Thanagarians) and even functioning interstellar societies are generally known to exist, and the arrival of alien spacecraft is not uncommon. Technologies which are only theoretical in the real world, such as artificial intelligence or are outright impossible according to modern science, such as faster-than-light travel, are functional and reproducible, though they are often portrayed as highly experimental and difficult to achieve. Demonstrable magic exists and can be learned. The general history of the fictional world is similar to the real one (for instance, there was a Roman Empire, and World War II and 9/11 both occurred), but many fantastic additions exist, such as the known existence of Atlantis. In recent years, stories have increasingly described events which bring the DC Universe farther away from reality, such as World War III occurring, Lex Luthor being elected as President of the United States in 2000, and entire cities and countries being destroyed. There are other minor variations, such as the Earth being slightly larger than ours (to accommodate the extra countries), and the planet Saturn having 18 moons rather than 19 because Superman destroyed one. =New Earth= \\"New Earth\\" is the Earth-like home planet to the main storybook characters of the DC Universe - the one with Smallville where Superman grows up, and Gotham City where Bruce Wayne avenges his parents by becoming Batman.Jeff Sellars Light Shining in a Dark Place: Discovering Theology through Film 2012 \\"New Earth is the home planet to the main storybook characters of the DC Universe.Tim Leong Super Graphic: A Visual Guide to the Comic Book Universe - 2013 \\"So, the DC Comics world you're most familiar with‚Äîthe one where Superman grows up in Smallville and Bruce Wayne decides to avenge his parents by becoming Batman‚Äî(a.k.a. New Earth) is actually a part of a larger ‚Äúmultiverse‚Äù . This New Earth is part of a larger DC Universe and DC Multiverse. Originally created from the First Crisis, it was allegedly erased from existence because of the Flashpoint‚ÄìConvergence effect, being replaced by \\"Prime Earth\\". By the end of the storyline Superman Reborn, the timelines of New Earth and Prime Earth have realigned into one single reality.Superman #18-19, Action Comics #975-976 =Superheroes= Many of the superhumans on Earth owe their powers to the \\"metagene\\", a genetic feature of unknown origin, which causes some people to develop superpowers when exposed to dangerous substances and forces. Others owe their powers to magic, genetic manipulation (or mutation) or bionics (see below). A large power gap resides between most superheroes and civilians. Still others owe their powers to not being human at all (see races, below). There are also superheroes and supervillains who possess no superhuman powers at all (for example Batman, Robin, Green Arrow or Speedy), but rival their effectiveness with specialized equipment or \\"to the absolute limit of human potential\\" training in special skills, such as martial arts. The humans first began using costumed identities to fight or commit crime during the 1930s. The first superheroes included characters like the Crimson Avenger and The Sandman. In November 1940, the first superhero team, the Justice Society of America, was formed. During World War II, all of America's heroes were banded together as the All-Star Squadron to protect the United States from the Axis powers. However, due to a magical spell cast by Adolf Hitler (using the Spear of Destiny and the Holy Grail) the most powerful heroes were unable to enter Axis-held territories, leaving the war to be fought mainly by normal humans such as Sgt. Rock. After the war, under pressure from the paranoid Committee on Un-American Activities, the JSA disbanded. While many types of heroes were active afterwards (mainly non-costumed, such as the Challengers of the Unknown or Detective Chimp), it was not until Superman's public debut that a new generation of costumed heroes became active. Soon after, the Justice League of America was formed, and they have remained Earth's preeminent superhero team; most DC heroes (such as the Teen Titans) have either belonged to the League at some point, or have connections to it. As a general rule, being a superhero does not require powers anywhere near omnipotence. Furthermore, even major heroes and cosmic entities have distinct vulnerabilities, such as: Superman's weaknesses to magic, kryptonite, and red sunlight; Green Lantern's initial problems with wood or the color yellow (which have since been largely overcome); or Batman's lack of superhuman powers, which he supplements with keen intellect, constant training, and specialized technology. Superheroes are generally accepted or even praised‚ÄîSuperman and the Flash actually having museums dedicated to them‚Äîby the general public, though some individuals have decided that \\"the metahumans\\" must be dealt with less passively. Thus, an organization called \\"the Dome\\" was formed to help superheroes who needed to fight crime across international borders; the superhero group called the Global Guardians were their main agents. However the Dome eventually lost out, as its United Nations backing went to the more famous Justice League. In general, DC Comics has led a parody of its own teams and organizations after the Watchmen storyline and the Batman run from a dark humor style which began during the 1980s and ended in the early 90s. Superhero teams such as the Doom Patrol and Justice League International led the writers to have a more subtle approach of semiotic dark humor with its own version of over-powered egos dominating personalities. The American government has had a more wary approach, however. Back during World War II they started \\"Project M\\" to create experimental soldiers to fight in the war, such as the Creature Commandos. Most of these experiments remain a secret to the public. Currently, the government deals with metahumans and similar beings through its Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO), and more recently A.R.G.U.S.. Covertly, they use an organization of costumed (but non-superhuman) agents known as \\"Checkmate\\". The government also formed Task Force X (known as the \\"Suicide Squad\\") for \\"black ops\\". Most members have been captured supervillains (and thus expendable), and were strongly \\"encouraged\\" to join (often with offerings of clemency if they survived their extremely dangerous missions). Outcast personalities are often relegated to the world of DCU supervillainry. They are then usually well versed in heists, kidnappings and robberies. Villains with meek powers contrive schemes of extraordinary complexity, yet‚Äîbecause of their simple talents‚Äîthey only call the attention of powerless superheroes like Batman, or lesser superheroes like Booster Gold. When caught, any prison sufficient to contain these villains is suitable. More powerful villains strive to contest for greater goals like world domination and/or universal acclaim (from the public and their villainous peers). Usually more powerful enemies are imprisoned in maximum-level facilities‚Äîsuch as Belle Reve Penitentiary (which also was secretly Task Force X's headquarters) and even alternate dimensions or outer space‚Äîbecause they cannot simply be killed by a bullet, electricity, or poison. Supervillains sometimes also form their own groups, but these tend to be short-lived because most villains simply do not trust each other. Most such teams are formed by a charismatic and/or fearsome criminal mastermind for specific purposes; an example is the Secret Society of Super Villains of which there have been several versions. Most villain teams are usually small, having been formed of individuals who know each other personally, such as the Central City Rogues, or have some other reason to work together (mercenary groups like the H.I.V.E., fanatical cults such as Kobra, etc.). =Advanced technology= Technology more advanced than that which currently exists in real life is available - but it is usually very expensive, and usually only rich or powerful individuals and organizations (or the scientific geniuses who create them) have access to them. S.T.A.R. Labs is an independent research outfit that often develops these devices, while Lexcorp is the main company selling them. The government also runs the secret Project Cadmus (located in the mountains near Metropolis) to develop clones and genetic manipulation without the public's knowledge. Technology can also come from outer space or different timelines. Apokolips weaponry is often sold in Metropolis to the criminal organization known as Intergang. Robots and similar creations, including cyborgs, can have superior intelligence when they are created as sentient beings. The Manhunters, the Metal Men, Red Tornado, Robotman, Hourman, and Metallo are but a few examples. These 'beings' are most often created by individuals who possess vast intellects, like scientists Professor T.O. Morrow (maker of the Red Tornado), Dr. Will Magnus (who constructed the Metal Men) and Professor Ivo (who fabricated Amazo and other advanced androids using a form of Nano-technology developed by Lexcorp). Brainiac also emulates this technology as well as technology from other worlds. Similarly, some characters use technology to enhance their armor or modify cybernetic functions, for example Steel, Cyborg and the Cyborg Superman. =Hidden races= There are a few intelligent races living on Earth that the public at large did not know about until recent times. Among these are the Amazons of Themyscira and Bana-Mighdall and the last survivors of Atlantis, who changed themselves into water-breathing forms, including the human-like Poseidonians and the mermaid-like Tritonians. Other species, such as Warworlders, were brief test subjects of Project Cadmus who fled to the Underworld below Metropolis. There is also a tribe of highly intelligent, telepathic gorillas living in Gorilla City, an invisible city hidden in Africa; this is the home of Gorilla Grodd. Certain creatures created such as angelic beings, timeline driven entities, experimental deformities and dimension creatures are not considered hidden races because it is simply not included. However, it is only because most monsters play a less substantial role in the DC Universe. The plot-lines of Dinosaur Island and Skartaris are but a few examples of the experiments the DC universe contrives, yet its role in DC comics are played down when in comparison to other companies, therefore they are included as being a race from Earth. An easternized influence is more evident in most Marvel Comics literature, while DC Comics are exaggerated, under-influenced or sustained into the belief of comical parodies; e.g. the story-line of the alien, Monstergirl, and her affluent life-style as a teenage recluse who turns into a monster or the purpose of Asmodel, an angelic inter- dimensional being from a conceptual Heaven who comes to Earth. Therefore, these particular races are not considered hidden but alien and extra- dimensional (see the following sections below for reference). =Aliens= There are many intelligent extraterrestrial races as well. Curiously, a large number of them are humanoid, even human-like, in form (such as Kryptonians, who outwardly appear identical to Earth-born humans); some can even interbreed with Terrans. Some of these races have natural superpowers, but they are usually the same for all individuals of the same race, unlike Earth's metahumans. This was explained by the fact that in Earth's distant past Martians experimented on humanity, severely culling the metahuman potential; this means that a species that was meant to have a wide range of powers, like Tamaranians or Kryptonians, ended up \\"just...human\\". However, there are also plenty of nonhumanoid races. The DC Universe has had many natural and cosmic disasters happen to their alien civilizations. The Martians were destroyed by war, the Kryptonians by a dying planet that exploded, and the Czarnians by a plague. Even the Almeracian Empire was victim to impending destruction by Imperiex. Order is kept around the galaxy by the Guardians of the Universe and their agents, the Green Lantern Corps. Rival peacekeeping organizations include the Darkstars (created by the Guardians' rivals, the Controllers) and the interplanetary mercenary organization L.E.G.I.O.N.. Criminal organizations include the Manhunters, the Spider Guild and the Dark Circle. Most aliens are from different planets, who have a source of origin near the Solar System and in the Milky Way Galaxy, although, unlike the Marvel Universe, alien colonies are common within the solar system. The Dominators are an imperialistic race of terrorist aliens who control most of the unknown cosmos in order to extract genetic resources from planets. The caste is also collectively known as the Dominion. Other aliens in the outlying galaxies control armadas like the Khunds, Gordanians, Thanagarians, Spider Guild and, most recently, the Reach. Even though the majority of the DC Universe is policed by the Green Lantern Corps, and later the United Planets, most rogue races strive to conquer the known universe. One oddity is the Vegan star system. Due to an arrangement with the Psions, the Guardians did not intervene in that system, allowing a cruel empire called \\"the Citadel\\" to govern there, until it was overthrown by the Omega Men. =Cosmic entities= The Presence is the God of the DC Universe; he created all reality. He is also among the most powerful beings in Creation. There are several lesser beings in the DC universe that possess god- like powers, through energy manipulation, magic ability, or technological advancement. Magic and the supernatural are often depicted as being real in the DC Universe, though some skeptics, such as Mister Terrific, maintain that there are scientific explanations to all such events. The narration of the mystic and harsh dark reality is more common in DC's Vertigo Comics because its stories lurk outside of superhero fantasy; the Vertigo series have beings that relate better to civilian life, although both universes are subject to fantastical realms and unworldly dimensions. Magic is too powerful in the physical world, where harnessing magic can distort and even destroy reality if not properly controlled (e.g., if a Lord of Order succumbs to certain events, so will a Lord of Chaos). There are several types of cosmic entities, such as: * Gods: The first beings calling themselves 'gods' first appeared billions of years ago on another planet, but they destroyed themselves in a terrible war. This unleashed the \\"Godwave\\", a wave of cosmic energy from the Source. This gave birth to other gods across the universe, including Earth's. From the planet's remains the worlds of Apokolips and New Genesis were formed, inhabited by beings that call themselves the \\"New Gods\\". The Source Wall is an archetype of Buddha on the edge of the known galaxy. Certain speedsters believe in enlightenment in order to become part of the Speed Force (see below). Kismet is an immortal god and the embodiment of reality. She was matched with Marvel's Eternity in JLA/Avengers. In mortal form she was a member of the Lords of Order. Depending on the characters, other diverse religious deities from ancient cultures are common. Heroes such as Aztek and Black Condor, or villains like Black Adam, have found knowledge of their native roots in origin. * Death represents different characters in the DC Universe. One personification of death is the Black Flash, who can represent Death as an internal figure for the speedsters in the DC Universe. Another is Death (see below), who resides at the very end of time. The Black Racer appears as Death in the afterlife. There also is Nekron, lord of the Land of the Unliving, who is the embodiment of Death as the ultimate opponent. Death is also one of the Endless, and is the ultimate personification of Death in the DCU. * The Lords of Chaos and Order: These two groups of magical beings have been fighting against each other since the beginning of time and they often empower others (with \\"Order Magic\\" or \\"Chaos Magic\\") in exchange for their acting as their agents. Many magical heroes and villains have been manipulated by them. The Lords of Chaos and Order were killed by the Spectre in Day Of Vengeance: Infinite Crisis Special #1. * Elementals: The Earth itself has a living spirit called \\"Maya\\" who, for millennia, has been creating champions, one for each of the mystical elements, to protect itself, using human beings as their hosts. The Swamp Thing, Firestorm, Naiad and the Red Tornado were some of them. * Homo magi: a species of humanity with the natural ability to use magic, this race almost disappeared after too much crossbreeding with normal humans (it is from them that people in the DC Universe inherited the ability to use magic). The last pure-blooded ones decided to retire to a magical invisible city centuries ago and are now known as \\"the Hidden Ones\\". Zatanna knows many of the race's secrets, and Traci Thirteen is currently investigating magical and occult phenomena for the Croatoan Society‚Äîboth women had Homo magi mothers. * The Endless: Physical manifestations of eternal and universal phenomena that affect the human condition (Destiny, Death, Dream, Destruction, Despair, Desire and Delirium), principally recounted in the Modern Age Sandman series. * Emotional Manifestations: Like the Endless, these beings were created from the emotional energy generated by sentient beings. Each of the seven emotional manifestations of the DCU is represented by a different color (rage - red; greed - orange; fear - yellow; will - green; hope - blue; compassion - indigo; love - violet) and being. The various power-ring based corps of the DCU, most notably the Green Lantern Corps and Sinestro Corps, utilize the energies of these beings. * Wizards and Sorcerers: Various sorcerers lurk in the DCU. Dr. Fate, Circe, the wizard Shazam, Mordru and Felix Faust are written as characters who use sorcery to both create and destroy. Dimensions, rituals and spiritual realms are sources for magic power as seen in Ras al Ghul's Lazarus Pit, Doctor Occult's use of the astral plane and the transformations of Captain Marvel. * Demons: Demonic entities vary from Etrigan the Demon to Blaze, Satanus and Neron. Demonic entities are abundant and come from Hell although some, like Eclipso the vengeance demon (also referred to as the Prince of Darkness), reside on the Moon. Demonic entities from Wonder Woman comics are directly linked to Greek mythology such as Hades and Ares. In the Vertigo comics, characters like John Constantine oppose demons influenced by Christian mythology. Most demons are not, however, directly linked to demonology. * The Monitors were incredibly powerful cosmic beings. Originally, a Monitor and an Anti-Monitor were byproducts of the event that created the Multiverse. As archenemies, they fought for billions of years, before enlisting the help of warriors and causing the Crisis, during which both were killed. After the Multiverse was reborn, the origins of the Monitors was revised. In the Post-Crisis continuity, the Monitors were a vast civilization tasked with protecting and guiding the various worlds of the Multiverse. They were also vampires and had to resist the urge to feed on the universes that they were born to protect. =Other dimensions= The DC Universe is composed of a number of different dimensional planes, most notably parallel Earths (see Multiverse), but the latter were eliminated when reality was altered by the Anti-Monitor (although stories featuring parallel Earths have continued to crop up with various rationalizations in the following years). Other types of dimensions still exist, however, including the Antimatter Universe of Qward, the Pax dimension, the Fifth Dimension and the Bleed. Prison dimensions, such as the Phantom Zone, are meant to house superpowered criminals who are too powerful for any conventional means of containment. Dimensions make up many universes, of which some are created and destroyed with help from supernatural forces and elements from which power is drawn. As well, certain dimensions function as crossover opportunities for heroes from different comic book companies to interact, either from competing companies, or from companies absorbed by competitors. The most notable example of the first kind of crossover has been between DC Comics and Marvel Comics, and the latter with Wildstorm Comics. An example of the latter kind of crossover would be DC's acquisition of Fawcett Comics, Quality Comics, and Charlton Comics and the absorption into the DC continuity of the original Captain Marvel, Plastic Man and Captain Atom. In this way, heroes originally published by different companies are now part of the same fictional universe, and interactions between such characters are no longer considered intercompany crossovers. Additionally, the Marvel Comics Universe is also said to exist in the DC Universe as one of the many alternative universes. The reverse may also be said with respect to the Marvel Universe. This is one method of explaining the various crossover stories co-published by the two companies. Heaven and Hell Heaven and Hell exist in the DC Universe but may not exist in the same continuum. Versions vary from the Vertigo and DC Universe series with writers of the Vertigo Universe depicting them in relation to religion and mythology while the writers in the DCU have a tendency to narrate fantasy. Speed Force The Speed Force is an extradimensional energy source which provides the speedsters of the DC Universe with their powers. Accessing the Speed Force makes it possible to run at incredible speeds, even faster than light, and even to jump in and out of the timestream, thereby travelling - albeit with a limited degree of control - through time. The Speed Force also acts as a kind of Valhalla for deceased speedsters. The Flash: Rebirth reveals that Barry Allen is a living generator of the Speed Force ever since the accident that transformed him into the Flash. The timestream It is possible to travel in time in this universe by several means, including moving faster than the speed of light. The Legion of Super-Heroes from 1,000 years into the future in particular have access to time-travel technology (although the threeboot Legion lacks time travel technology) while Rip Hunter is the present day authority of the technology. Originally, it was impossible to change the past, or to exist in two places at the same time (a time traveler appearing in an era where they already existed would become an ineffectual, invisible phantom while there). However that was all changed after the Anti- Monitor tried to change history at the beginning of time during the Crisis on Infinite Earths.

Many species of animals possessing dorsal fins are not particularly closely related to each other, though through convergent evolution they have independently evolved external superficial fish-like body plans ideal for their marine environments, including most numerously fishes, but also mammals such as cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises), and even extinct ancient marine reptiles such as various known species of ichthyosaurs. Most species have only one dorsal fin, but some have two or three. Wildlife biologists often use the distinctive nicks and wear patterns which develop on the dorsal fins of large cetaceans to identify individuals in the field. The bony or cartilaginous bones that support the base of the dorsal fin in fish are called pterygiophores. Functions The main purpose of the dorsal fin is to stabilize the animal against rolling and to assist in sudden turns. Some species have further adapted their dorsal fins to other uses. The sunfish uses the dorsal fin (and the anal fin) for propulsion. In anglerfish, the anterior of the dorsal fin is modified into a biological equivalent to a fishing pole and a lure known as illicium or esca. Many catfish can lock the leading ray of the dorsal fin in an extended position to discourage predation or to wedge themselves into a crevice. Some animals have developed dorsal fins with protective functions, such as spines or venom. For example, both the spiny dogfish and the Port Jackson shark have spines in their dorsal fins which are capable of secreting venom. File:Carassius wild golden fish 2013 G1.jpgMost fish, like this Prussian carp, have one dorsal fin File:Parts of a shark.svgSharks typically have two dorsal fins File:Thunnus albacares.pngThe yellowfin tuna also has two dorsal fins File:Haddock fins.tiffHaddocks have three dorsal fins Billfish have prominent dorsal fins. Like tuna, mackerel and other scombroids, billfish streamline themselves by retracting their dorsal fins into a groove in their body when they swim. The shape, size, position and colour of the dorsal fin varies with the type of billfish, and can be a simple way to identify a billfish species. For example, the white marlin has a dorsal fin with a curved front edge and is covered with black spots. The huge dorsal fin, or sail, of the sailfish is kept retracted most of the time. Sailfish raise them if they want to herd a school of small fish, and also after periods of high activity, presumably to cool down.Aquatic Life of the World pp. 332‚Äì333, Marshall Cavendish Corporation, 2000. .Dement J Species Spotlight: Atlantic Sailfish (Istiophorus albicans) littoralsociety.org.

In development of the embryo in teleost fish, the dorsal fin arises from sections of the skin that form a caudal fin fold. The larval development and formation of the skeleton that support the median fins in adults result in pterygiophores. The skeletal elements of the pterygiophore includes basals and radials. The basals are located at the base of the dorsal fin, and are closest to the body. The radials extend outward from the body to support the rest of the fin. These elements serve as attachment sites for epaxial muscles. The muscles contract and pull against the basals of the pterygiophores along one side of the body, which helps the fish move through water by providing greater stability. In these types of fish, the fins are made of 2 main components. The first component is the dermal fin rays known as lepidotrichia, and the endoskeletal base with associated muscles for movement is the second.

Examples include position and momentum. In systems governed by classical mechanics, it is a real-valued \\"function\\" on the set of all possible system states. In quantum physics, it is an operator, or gauge, where the property of the quantum state can be determined by some sequence of operations. For example, these operations might involve submitting the system to various electromagnetic fields and eventually reading a value. Physically meaningful observables must also satisfy transformation laws which relate observations performed by different observers in different frames of reference. These transformation laws are automorphisms of the state space, that is bijective transformations which preserve certain mathematical properties of the space in question.  Quantum mechanics  In quantum physics, observables manifest as linear operators on a Hilbert space representing the state space of quantum states. The eigenvalues of observables are real numbers that correspond to possible values the dynamical variable represented by the observable can be measured as having. That is, observables in quantum mechanics assign real numbers to outcomes of particular measurements, corresponding to the eigenvalue of the operator with respect to the system's measured quantum state. As a consequence, only certain measurements can determine the value of an observable for some state of a quantum system. In classical mechanics, any measurement can be made to determine the value of an observable. The relation between the state of a quantum system and the value of an observable requires some linear algebra for its description. In the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics, states are given by non-zero vectors in a Hilbert space V. Two vectors v and w are considered to specify the same state if and only if \\\\mathbf{w} = c\\\\mathbf{v} for some non-zero c \\\\in \\\\Complex. Observables are given by self-adjoint operators on V. However, as indicated below, not every self-adjoint operator corresponds to a physically meaningful observable. For the case of a system of particles, the space V consists of functions called wave functions or state vectors. In the case of transformation laws in quantum mechanics, the requisite automorphisms are unitary (or antiunitary) linear transformations of the Hilbert space V. Under Galilean relativity or special relativity, the mathematics of frames of reference is particularly simple, considerably restricting the set of physically meaningful observables. In quantum mechanics, measurement of observables exhibits some seemingly unintuitive properties. Specifically, if a system is in a state described by a vector in a Hilbert space, the measurement process affects the state in a non- deterministic but statistically predictable way. In particular, after a measurement is applied, the state description by a single vector may be destroyed, being replaced by a statistical ensemble. The irreversible nature of measurement operations in quantum physics is sometimes referred to as the measurement problem and is described mathematically by quantum operations. By the structure of quantum operations, this description is mathematically equivalent to that offered by relative state interpretation where the original system is regarded as a subsystem of a larger system and the state of the original system is given by the partial trace of the state of the larger system. In quantum mechanics, dynamical variables A such as position, translational (linear) momentum, orbital angular momentum, spin, and total angular momentum are each associated with a Hermitian operator \\\\hat{A} that acts on the state of the quantum system. The eigenvalues of operator \\\\hat{A} correspond to the possible values that the dynamical variable can be observed as having. For example, suppose \\\\psi_{a}\\\\rangle is an eigenket (eigenvector) of the observable \\\\mathbf{A}, with eigenvalue a, and exists in a d-dimensional Hilbert space. Then :\\\\mathbf{A}\\\\psi_a\\\\rangle = a\\\\psi_a\\\\rangle. This eigenket equation says that if a measurement of the observable \\\\mathbf{A} is made while the system of interest is in the state \\\\psi_a\\\\rangle, then the observed value of that particular measurement must return the eigenvalue a with certainty. However, if the system of interest is in the general state \\\\phi\\\\rangle \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}, then the eigenvalue a is returned with probability \\\\langle \\\\psi_a\\\\phi\\\\rangle^2, by the Born rule. To be more precise, the dynamical variable/observable is a self-adjoint operator in a Hilbert space. = Operators on finite and infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces = Observables can be represented by a Hermitian matrix if the Hilbert space is finite- dimensional. In an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the observable is represented by a symmetric operator, which may not be defined everywhere. The reason for such a change is that in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the observable operator can become unbounded, which means that it no longer has a largest eigenvalue. This is not the case in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space: an operator can have no more eigenvalues than the dimension of the state it acts upon, and by the well-ordering property, any finite set of real numbers has a largest element. For example, the position of a point particle moving along a line can take any real number as its value, and the set of real numbers is uncountably infinite. Since the eigenvalue of an observable represents a possible physical quantity that its corresponding dynamical variable can take, we must conclude that there is no largest eigenvalue for the position observable in this uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space.  Incompatibility of observables in quantum mechanics  A crucial difference between classical quantities and quantum mechanical observables is that the latter may not be simultaneously measurable, a property referred to as complementarity. This is mathematically expressed by non-commutativity of the corresponding operators, to the effect that the commutator :\\\\left[\\\\mathbf{A}, \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\right] := \\\\mathbf{A}\\\\mathbf{B} - \\\\mathbf{B}\\\\mathbf{A} eq \\\\mathbf{0}. This inequality expresses a dependence of measurement results on the order in which measurements of observables \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{A} and \\\\scriptstyle \\\\mathbf{B} are performed. Observables corresponding to non-commutative operators are called incompatible.

A popular landmark and the second most visited monument in Paris, the basilica stands at the summit of the butte Montmartre, the highest point in the city. Sacr√©-C≈ìur Basilica is above all a religious (Catholic) building, shown by its perpetual adoration of the Holy Eucharist since 1885, and is also seen as a double monument, political and cultural, both a national penance for the defeat of France in the 1870 Franco-Prussian War and for the socialist Paris Commune of 1871An amendment that would have specified that the undertaking \\"was not solely a protestation of the taking up of arms by the Commune, but a sign of appeasement and concord\\" was rejected.

The basilica was designed by Paul Abadie. Construction began in 1875 and was completed in 1914. The basilica was consecrated after the end of World War I in 1919. Basilica 297x297px Sacre C≈ìur, seen from the Arc de Triomphe. The inspiration for Sacr√©-C≈ìur's design originated on 4 September 1870, the day of the proclamation of the Third Republic, with a speech by Bishop Fournier attributing the defeat of French troops during the Franco-Prussian War to a divine punishment after \\"a century of moral decline\\" since the French Revolution, in the wake of the division in French society that arose in the decades following that revolution, between devout Catholics and legitimist royalists on one side,Marguerite Marie Alacoque, the evangelist for veneration of the Sacred Heart, was beatified by Pope Pius IX in 1864. and democrats, secularists, socialists, and radicals on the other. This schism in the French social order became particularly pronounced after the 1870 withdrawal of the French military garrison protecting the Vatican in Rome to the front of the Franco-Prussian War by Napoleon III, the secular uprising of the Paris Commune of 1870-1871, and the subsequent 1871 defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War. Though today the basilica is asserted to be dedicated in honor of the 58,000 who lost their lives during the war, the decree of the Assembl√©e nationale 24 July 1873, responding to a request by the archbishop of Paris and voting its construction, specifies that it is to \\"expiate the crimes of the Commune.\\" Montmartre had been the site of the Commune's first insurrection, and the Communards had executed Georges Darboy, Archbishop of Paris, who became a martyr for the resurgent Catholic Church. His successor Guibert, climbing the Butte Montmartre in October 1872, was reported to have had a vision as clouds dispersed over the panorama: \\"It is here, it is here where the martyrs are,General Claude Lecomte and General Cl√©ment-Thomas, shot by insurrectionists in the early days of the Commune, in the garden of 6, rue des Rosiers.

The project was expressed by the Church as a National Vow (V≈ìu national) and financial support came from parishes throughout France. The dedicatory inscription records the basilica as the accomplishment of a vow by Alexandre Legentil and Hubert Rohault de Fleury, ratified by Joseph-Hippolyte Guibert, Archbishop of Paris. The project took many years to complete. Construction Construction of the Sacr√©-C≈ìur, 10 March 1882. A law of public utility was passed to seize land at the summit of Montmartre for the construction of the basilica. Architect Paul Abadie designed the basilica after winning a competition over 77 other architects.The competition was commemorated in Souvenir du Concours de l‚Äô√âglise du Sacr√©-C≈ìur (Paris: J. Le Clere) 1874. With delays in assembling the property, the foundation stone was finally laid 16 June 1875. Passionate debates concerning the basilica were raised in the Conseil Municipal in 1880, where the basilica was called \\"an incessant provocation to civil war\\" and it was debated whether to rescind the law of 1873 granting property rights, an impracticable proposition. The matter reached the Chamber of Deputies in the summer of 1882, in which the basilica was defended by Archbishop Guibert while Georges Clemenceau argued that it sought to stigmatize the Revolution. The law was rescinded but the basilica was saved by a technicality, and the bill was not reintroduced in the next session. A further attempt to halt the construction was defeated in 1897, by which time the interior was substantially complete and had been open for services for six years.Harvey \\"Monument and Myth\\" 1979, pp 380‚Äì81 . Plan of the roofs; the darker the background colour, the higher the level of the roof Abadie died not long after the foundation had been laid, in 1884, and five architects continued with the work: Honor√© Daumet (1884‚Äì1886), Jean-Charles Laisn√© (1886‚Äì1891), Henri-Pierre-Marie Rauline (1891‚Äì1904), Lucien Magne (1904‚Äì1916), and Jean-Louis Hulot (1916‚Äì1924). The basilica was not completed until 1914, when war intervened; it was formally dedicated in 1919 after World War I, when its national symbolism had shifted. Construction costs, estimated at 7 million French francs and drawn entirely from private donations, were expended before any above-ground, visible structure was to be seen. A provisional chapel was consecrated 3 March 1876, and pilgrimage donations quickly became the mainstay of funding.In 1877, its first full year of operation, visiting pilgrims dropped over 240,000 francs into the collection boxes; the figure doubled the following year. (Jonas 1993:495). Donations were encouraged by the expedient of permitting donors to \\"purchase\\" individual columns or other features as small as a brick.This fund- raising technique, originated at Sacr√©-C≈ìur, became standard practice for funding cultural institutions' building projects in Europe and the Americas after World War I. It was declared by the National Assembly that the state had the ultimate responsibility for funding. Muted echoes of the basilica's \\"tortured history\\" are still heard, geographer David Harvey has noted.Harvey \\"Monument and Myth\\" 1979, P381 . In February 1971 demonstrators pursued by the police took refuge in the basilica and called upon their radical comrades to join them in occupying the church \\"built upon the bodies of communards in order to efface that red flag that had for too long floated over Paris\\" as their leaflets expressed it.

Many design elements of the basilica symbolise nationalist themes: the portico, with its three arches, is adorned by two equestrian statues of French national saints Joan of Arc (1927) and King Saint Louis IX, both executed in bronze by Hippolyte Lef√®bvre; and the nineteen-ton Savoyarde bell (one of the world's heaviest), cast in 1895 in Annecy, alludes to the annexation of Savoy in 1860. right Sacr√©-C≈ìur is built of travertine stone quarried in Ch√¢teau-Landon (Seine-et-Marne), France.

The top of the dome is open to tourists and affords a spectacular panoramic view of the city of Paris, which is mostly to the south of the basilica. The use of cameras and video recorders is forbidden inside the basilica. Pipe organ Interior of the Sacr√©-C≈ìur. The basilica is home to a large and very fine pipe organ built by Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll for a private home in Biarritz, composed of 109 ranks and 78 speaking stops spread across four 61-note manuals and the 32-note pedalboard (unusual before the start of the 20th century; the standard of the day was 56 and 30), spread across three expressive divisions (also unusual for the time, even in large organs). The organ was ahead of its time, containing multiple expressive divisions and giving the performer considerable advantages over other even larger instruments of the day. It was almost identical (tonal characteristics, layout, and casework) to the instrument in Sheffield's Albert Hall, destroyed by fire in 1937. However, when installed in Paris in 1905 by Cavaill√©-Coll's successor and son-in-law, Charles Mutin, it lost its ornate case for a much plainer one.  Bells  The belfry of the basilica of the Sacred Heart of Montmartre houses 5 bells, 4 small ones and a huge bourdon called \\"The Savoyarde\\", the biggest bell in France. It was cast on May 13, 1891 by the Paccard foundry (Dynasty of Georges, Hippolyte-Francisque and Victor (or G & F)) in Annecy-le-Vieux . This bell is the fifth largest in Europe behind the Petersglocke of Cologne (Germany), the Olympic bell of London, Maria Dolens of Rovereto (Italy), and the Pummerin of Vienna (Austria), weighs 18,835 kg, measures 3,03 m of diameter for 9.60 m of outer circumference, with a base thickness of 22 cm and a leaf of 850 kg. With its accessories, its official weight reaches 19,685 kg. It was offered by the four dioceses of Savoy and the arrival of the fardier at the Basilica of the Sacred Heart on October 16, 1895, pulled by a team of 28 horses. It rang only for major religious holidays, especially on Easter, Pentecost, Ascension, Christmas, the Assumption and All Saints' Day; it could be heard 10 km away. However, since the late 1990s, a crack has appeared. Role in Catholicism The interior of the north dome, Sacr√©-C≈ìur, Paris In response to requests from French bishops, Pope Pius IX promulgated the feast of the Sacred Heart in 1856. The basilica itself was consecrated on 16 October 1919. Since 1885 (before construction had been completed) the Blessed Sacrament (Christ's body, consecrated during the Mass) has been continually on display in a monstrance above the high altar. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament has continued uninterrupted in the basilica since 1885. Tourists and others are asked to dress appropriately when visiting the basilica and to observe silence as much as possible, so as not to disturb persons who have come from around the world to pray in this place of pilgrimage, especially since there is the exposition of the Blessed Sacrament. Photos are not allowed to be taken in the Basilica. Access The basilica is accessible by bus. Buses 30, 31, 80, and 85 can be taken to the bottom of the hill of the basilica. Line 12 of the metro can be taken to Jules Joffrin station and visitors can then change to the Montmartrobus and disembark at Place du Tertre. Line 2 or 12 of the metro can be taken to Pigalle station where visitors can change to the Montmartrobus and disembark at Norvins, or to Anvers station which gives easy access to the steps or the funicular car that lead directly to the basilica. The Abbesses (Paris Metro) station could be a good choice as well, but is not wheelchair accessible. Sacr√©-C≈ìur is open from 06:00 to 22:30 every day. The dome is accessible from 09:00 to 19:00 in the summer and to 18:00 in the winter. Copy in Martinique A much smaller version of the basilica, Sacr√©-C≈ìur de la Balata, is located north of Fort-de-France, Martinique, on N3, the main inland road. Built for the refugees driven from their homes by the eruption of Mount Pel√©e, it was dedicated in 1915.

The variety was historically a component of Rioja's red wine blend. The grape's prominence in France hit a high point in 1988 when it accounted for and was France's most widely planted grape variety. That year, in a drive to increase the overall quality of European wine and to reduce the growing wine lake phenomenon, the European Union started an aggressive vine pull scheme where vineyard owners were offered cash subsidies in exchange for pulling up their vines. Out of all the French wine varieties, Carignan was the most widely affected dropping by 2000 to 95,700 ha (236,000 acres) and being surpassed by Merlot as the most widely planted grape.J. Robinson (ed) The Oxford Companion to Wine Third Edition pg 139 Oxford University Press 2006 The popularity of Carignan was largely tied to its ability to produce very large yields in the range of 200 hl/ha (11 tons/acre). The vine does face significant viticultural hazards with significant sensitivity to several viticultural hazards including rot, powdery mildew, downy mildew, and grape worms. Carignan is a late budding and ripening grape which requires a warm climate in order to achieve full physiological ripeness. The vine also develops very thick stalk around the grape clusters which makes mechanical harvesting difficult. It has an upright growth habit and can be grown without a trellis.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 616-619 Allen Lane 2012 A white grape mutation known as Carignan blanc and a pink-berried Carignan gris also exists in Roussillon in small plantings of around and , respectively, reported in 2008. History In the mid-15th century, the Crown of Aragon stretched from Eastern Spain, across Sardinia and mainland Italy all the way to the eastern Mediterranean. It is during this time that ampelographers believe that Carignan, which likely originated in Aragon, may have been introduced to these lands. Early Italian wine writers speculated that Carignan, known as Carignano in several parts of Italy, was a Phoenician wine grape variety that was brought to the island of Sardinia by the Phoenicians in the 9th century BC. From there the grape is believed to have spread to other Phoenician colonies, including the settlement at Sulcis, eventually being brought to the Italian mainland and carried around the western Mediterranean basin by the ancient Romans. Today, ampelographers largely discount this theory due to the lack of historical documentation or evidence from DNA analysis suggesting a Phoenician or Italian origin. Instead, the evidence points more strongly to a Spanish origin of the grape. Ampelographers do believe that Carignan is likely a very old variety due to its widespread plantings and the proliferation of numerous different synonyms that give testament to the grape's long history in different wine regions. The grape likely originated in the Aragon region of northwest Spain where it possibly named after the town of Cari√±ena in the province of Zaragoza. However, in Zaragoza and other parts of Catalonia, the grape is sometimes called Sams√≥ which is also used as a synonym for the French wine grape Cinsault, adding to confusion over Carignan's history in the region. Another Spanish synonym, Mazuelo, which is used in the Rioja wine region, is believed by ampelographers and wine historians to come from the commune of Mazuela in the province of Burgos in the Castile and Le√≥n region of northwest Spain. In 2006, DNA profiling suggested a parent-offspring relationship between Carignan and the Rioja wine grape Graciano though it was not yet clear which variety is the parent and which is the offspring. However, some grape geneticist and ampelographers such as Jos√© Vouillamoz dispute the 2006 findings and believe that the DNA profiles of both grapes are too distinct to have a close parent- offspring relationship at all. It is more likely, Vouillamoz and others suggest, that Carignan and Graciano were the result of two separate spontaneous crossings of unknown Vitis vinifera parents that occurred somewhere in northeast Spain. Carignan was likely introduced to Sardinia sometime between 1323-1720 when the island was under the Spanish influence of the Crown of Aragon. Here the grape developed in isolation to form distinct clones under the synonyms Bovale di Spagna and Bovale Grande. At some point the grape reached Algeria where it became a high yielding \\"workhorse\\" variety that was widely exported to France to add color and weight to French wine blends. After the phylloxera epidemic devastated French vineyards in the mid to late 19th century, plantings of Carignan grew in popularity on the French mainland. Plantings increased even more when Algeria gained independence in 1962. The grape's prominence in France hit a high point in 1988 when it accounted for 167,000 hectares (410,000 acres) and was France's most widely planted grape variety. However, as France's wine lake problem became more of a concern, authorities within the French government and European Union started an aggressive vine pull scheme where vineyard owners were offered cash subsidies in exchange for pulling up their vines. Viticulture Carignan leaf. Carignan is a late budding and late ripening variety that is often one of the last grapes to be harvested during a vintage. The vine is very vigorous and high yielding, able to easily produce 200 hectoliters/hectare (approximately 10.4 tons/acres), if not kept in check by winter pruning or green harvesting during the growing season. The late ripening nature of the grape means that it rarely achieves full ripeness unless planted in vineyard soils in very warm climates such as the Mediterranean climates where the grape originated in or the hot Central Valley of California. Carginan's tendency to produce short shoots with clusters that grow closely to the trunk of the vine means that it is difficult variety to harvest mechanically. However, the economy of scale for blending varieties or grapes destined for lower priced box and jug wines often do not work well with the expense and labor cost of hand-harvesting. Among the viticultural hazards that Carignan is susceptible to include powdery mildew and infestation of the vine from grape worms and the European Grapevine Moth. The vine has some slight resistance to the fungal disease of botrytis bunch rot, downy mildew, and phomopsis. =Relationship and confusion with other grapes= Despite sharing several synonyms, such as Sams√≥ in Catalonia, Carignan and Cinsault (pictured) are genetically distinct. In 2003, DNA evidence confirmed that Carignan/Cari√±ena was the same variety as the Mazuelo (or Mazuela) grape of Rioja. This was followed by the discovery in 2007 that the Bovale di Spagna and Bovale Grande grapes of Sardinia were also identical to Carignan. DNA profiling was also able to distinguish Carignan as a distinct variety from other varieties known as Bovale (including Graciano which is known on Sardinia as Bovale Sardo and Bovale Cagnulari) as well as the Valencia wine grape Bobal which is sometimes field blended in the Cari√±ena (DO) with Carignan. Other varieties that are sometimes confused with Carignan but have been conclusively proven by DNA analysis to be distinct include the Sardinian wine grape Nieddera that is related to the Pascale di Cagliari grape which also grown on the island and sometimes confused with Carignan, Cinsault which shares the synonym Sams√≥ in Catalonia with Carignan, the Italian wine grape Tintilia del Molise that is grown in the Lazio and Molise wine regions of central Italy and the Spanish wine grape Parraleta that is grown in the Somontano DO of Aragon. Grapes that are also unrelated to Carignan but share synonyms include Carignan Boushet (a Petit Bouschet and Morrastel cross),Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Carignan Bouschet Accessed: July 16th, 2013 Bobal (a Spanish wine grape that is also known as Carignan d'Espagne),Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Bobal Accessed: July 16th, 2013 Aubun (a French wine grape that is also known as Carignan de Bedoin, Carignan de Bedouin, and Carignan de Gigondas),Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Aubun Accessed: July 16th, 2013 Alicante Bouschet (French teinturier grape that is also known as Carignan jaune),Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Alicante Bouschet Accessed: July 16th, 2013 and Grenache (which is also known as Carignan rouge, Carignane rosso, and Carignane rousee).Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Garnacha Tinta Accessed: July 16th, 2013 Over the years Carignan has been crossed with several varieties to create new wine grapes including with Cabernet Sauvignon to give Ruby Cabernet and with the Portuguese wine grape Souz√£o to produce Argaman. =Carignan blanc and gris= Carignan blanc and Carignan gris can be found to a limited extent in the French wine region of Roussillon along the Spanish border. Like Pinot noir and Grenache, Carignan has mutated to produce white-berried and pink-berried color mutations known as Carignan blanc and Carignan gris, respectively. Carignan blanc is a white mutation of the Carignan grape found primarily in the Roussillon region.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 101 Abbeville Press 2003 First discovered in the early 20th century, there were of the grape planted in France in the 1960s but by 2009 that figure had dropped to . In Spain, Carignan blanc (known as Cari√±ena blanca throughout most of the country, Sams√≥ blanco in Catalonia, and Carinyena blanc in the Empord√† (DO)) is even more rarely found with only planted throughout the country in 2008. Here the grape is mostly used for blending with Macabeo, with a very few varietal examples produced. Like Carignan noir, both Carignan blanc and Carignan gris are late budding and late ripening varieties that are highly susceptible to powdery mildew. According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Carignan blanc tends to produce full-bodied white wines that can have high acid and alcohol levels with very little aromatics. While the wines tend to be \\"shy\\" in the nose, Robinson notes that the palate can be \\"luscious\\" with light, citrus notes. Winemaking In winemaking, the grape is often used as a deep coloring component in blends, rather than being made in a varietal form with some exceptions. Carignan can be a difficult variety for winemakers to work due to its naturally high acidity, tannins, and astringency which requires a lot of skill to produce a wine of finesse and elegance. Some winemakers have experimented with carbonic maceration and adding small amounts of Cinsault and Grenache with some positive results. Syrah and Grenache are considered its best blending partners being capable of yielding a softer wine with rustic fruit and perfume. In California, Ridge Vineyards has found some success with a varietal wine made from Carignan vines that were planted in the 1880s. Wine regions Carignan is found around the globe with the vast majority of plantings in France, followed by Spain and Italy where it is a permitted grape variety in several appellation d'origine contr√¥l√©e (AOC), denominaci√≥n de origen (DO) and Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) regions. Elsewhere in Europe and the Middle East, plantings of the grape can be found in Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, Turkey, and Israel. In Africa, plantings of Carignan are also found in the north African wine-producing countries of Morocco and Tunisia as well as in South Africa. In the New World, Carignan is planted in several American Viticultural Areas (AVA)s of the United States, particularly in California and Washington State. Elsewhere in North America, plantings of the grape can be found in Mexico. In South America, Carignan is planted in Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay. In recent years, plantings of the grape have slowly increased in China as well as Australia. =France= French departments where Carignan is grown. Carignan is most widely found in southern France, particularly in the Languedoc wine regions of Aude, Gard, and H√©rault where it is often made as Vin ordinaire and in some Vin de pays wines. In the late 1990s, there were over of the grape planted in the Aude and H√©rault departments alone but by 2009 the total plantings of Carignan throughout France had dropped to . While plantings of the grape in France were more than 9 times higher than the next major Carignan producing country (Spain), this drop in plantings is indicative of the global trend of decline in \\"workhorse varieties\\" like Carignan in favor of what the European Union designates as \\"improving varieties\\" such as Grenache, Mourvedre, and Syrah. Plantings of Carignan are mostly limited to the warm Mediterranean climates of southern France due to the grape's inability to sufficiently ripen much further north in the continental climate of central France or in the damp maritime climate of Southwest France. Other departments with significant plantings of Carignan include the Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales, Var, and Vaucluse. =Spain= Old bushvine plantings of Carignan can be found in the Priorat region (vineyard pictured) of Catalonia In 2004, Spain had around 7,000 ha (17,300 acres) of Carignan planted. By 2008 that number has dropped to around , and to in 2015. The grape (traditionally called Cari√±ena, but now officially called Mazuelo, but also spelled Mazuela) has seen plantings sharply decline in its ancestral home of Aragon where it was once a secondary component of wine from the denominaci√≥n de origen protegida (DOP) of Cari√±ena region after Grenache.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 143-145 Mitchell Beazley 1986 In 2009, Aragon has just dedicated to the grape. The grape has found an increasing prominence in the Catalan wine region of Priorat, where it is the main variety in the schistous vineyard soils of the northern half of the appellation. Around the villages of Poboleda and Porrera in the province of Tarragona are bushvines of the grape that are more than 100 years old that are used to make varietal wines. The grape is also found in the DOPs of Costers del Segre, Montsant, Pened√®s, Tarragona, and Terra Alta. In Catalan the grape is called Sams√≥ or Carinyena, though it is not related to Cinsault which is also known as Sams√≥ in Catalonia. Outside of Catalonia, Mazuelo is mostly a secondary blending variety used to add acidity to the Tempranillo-based wines of Rioja though a few producers, such as Marqu√©s de Murrieta, do make varietal examples of the grape. In 2008, there were of the grape in Rioja. In 2009, there were and of Carignan planted in the nearby wine regions of Castile-La Mancha and Navarra respectively. =Other Old World regions= More than 97% of Italian Carignan plantings are found in Sardinia (vineyard pictured) where the grape is also known as Bovale Grande. In 2012, more than 97% of Italy's of Carignan plantings were in Sardinia with a few scattered plantings throughout Lazio, particularly the Cerveteri DOC, where it is often used in ros√© winemaking. The Carignano del Sulcis Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) features a Carignan-based rosso from the Sardinian islands of Sant'Antioco and San Pietro. Here the grape is known as Bovale Grande and is also featured in the DOC wines of Campidano di Terralba and Mandrolisai. The grape is still popular in North Africa in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia. Carignan also played an important role in the early development of the Israeli wine industry. Though it is not as prominent today, it is still the country's third most widely planted red grape variety after Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot with in 2009. Other Old World wine producing countries with significant Carignan plantings include Croatia with in 2009, Cyprus with , Malta with and Turkey with in 2010. Chinese winemakers have also experimented with growing Carignan in some of their warmer wine regions. =United States= For many years Carignan was the third most widely planted grape in California where it was a major component in the production of many varieties of jug wines. At one point in California's wine history, Carignane (as it is known there) was the third most widely planted grape variety but has since dropped considerably in production. The majority of the vines were planted in the Central Valley and used to make inexpensive box and jug wines. In the 1970s and 1980s, Californian Carignane was one of the leading \\"home winemaking\\" grapes in production. In 2010, there were of the grape planted in the state with American Viticultural Areas in Contra Costa, Mendocino, and Sonoma counties seeing a slight increase in interest while plantings the Central Valley have declined. Outside of California, plantings of the grape can be found in Washington State as well as in Missouri and Texas.Appellation American \\"Carignan\\", Accessed: August 14th, 2013 =Other New World regions= In Mexico, plantings of Carignan are found in the states of Aguascalientes, Sonora, and Zacatecas. In Chile, old vines of plantings of Carignan are grown without irrigation in the Maule region which accounted for the majority of the country's plantings of the grape in 2008. In Argentina there was just of the grape while Uruguay had planted in 2009. In Australia the grape was often confused with the Bonvedro vine, which is similarly prone to diseases, but in recent years Australian winemakers have been able to identify true Carignan. Most Australian plantings of Carignan are found in South Australia where the grape is primarily used for blending. In South Africa, there were of the grape planted in 2012 with the majority found on the shale vineyard soils of the Paardeberg region in Swartland. Synonyms Carignan. The grape is known under a variety of synonyms through the world. In Spanish it is known as Cari√±ena (particularly in Aragon), with Cari√±ano (also in Aragon), Mazuelo, Tinto Mazuelo, Crujillon (in Aragon) and Sams√≥ (in Catalonia) also being used in Spain. The recent use of Sams√≥ has been controversial because this seems to be an error, as there is a different grape called Sams√≥, which is France's Cinsault but this change was implemented due to name Cari√±ena (in Catalan the grape is still generally called, 'Carinyena') being claimed by the DO body in Aragon. In California it is spelled with an extra vowel on the end as Carignane. In Italy it is known as Gragnano while in Sardinia it is known as Bovale Grande and Carignano. In Portugal it is known as Pinot Evara even though it has no relation to the Pinot family of grapes. Other French synonyms include Carignan noir, Bois Dur, Catalan, Roussillonen, Monestel, and Plant de L√©denon.

The title has been created four times in English history, and the name refers to Warwick Castle and the town of Warwick. Overview The first creation came in 1088, and the title was held by the Beaumont and later by the Beauchamp families. The 14th Earl was created Duke of Warwick in 1445, a title which became extinct on his early death the following year. The best-known Earl of this creation was the 16th Earl jure uxoris, Richard Neville, who was involved in the deposition of two kings, a fact which later earned him the epithet of \\"Warwick the Kingmaker\\". This creation became extinct on the death of the 17th Earl in 1499. The title was revived in 1547 for the powerful statesman John Dudley, 1st Viscount Lisle, who was later made Duke of Northumberland. The earldom was passed on during his lifetime to his eldest son, John, but both father and son were attainted in 1554. The title was recreated or restored in 1561 in favour of Ambrose Dudley, younger son of the Duke of Northumberland. However, Ambrose was childless and the earldom became extinct on his death in 1590. It was created for a third time in 1618 for Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich, in spite of the fact that the Rich family was not in possession of Warwick Castle. From 1673, the Earls also held the title of Earl of Holland. All of the titles became extinct on the death of the 8th Earl in 1759. The earldom was revived the same year in favour of Francis Greville, 1st Earl Brooke. The Greville family was in possession of Warwick Castle, and the title and castle were thereby re-united for the first time in over a century. The 1759 creation is extant and currently held by Guy Greville, 9th Earl of Warwick. However, Warwick Castle was sold by the family in 1978, and they currently live in Australia. 1088 creation Bear and Ragged Staff ancient heraldic motif used by the Earls of Warwick Rolls of Arms, incl. Collins' Roll, c. 1296For a discussion of the origin of these arms see G. E. Cokayne. The Complete Peerage, n.s., Vol. XII, Part 1, Appendix J, \\"The Warenne Group of Chequered Shields\\", pp.26-9 Arms of Beauchamp: Gules, a fesse between six cross crosslets or Arms of Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick The medieval earldom created in 1088 was held to be heritable via a female line of descent, and thus was held by members of several different families. It was traditionally associated in its feudal form with possession of Warwick Castle. The ancient heraldic device of the Earls of Warwick, the Bear and Ragged Staff, is believed to derive from two legendary Earls, Arthal and Morvidus. Arthal is thought to mean \\"bear\\", while Morvidus was to have slain a giant \\"with a young ash tree torn up by the roots.\\"Stephen Turnbull: The Book of the Medieval Knight, Arms and Armour, 1995, , p. 160 Alternatively the emblem of a bear (Latin ursus) is believed to refer to Urse d'AbetotMason \\"Legends of the Beauchamps' Ancestors\\" Journal of Medieval History pp. 34‚Äì35 (c. 1040 ‚Äì 1108), 1st feudal baron of SalwarpeSanders, I.J. English Baronies: A Study of their Origin and Descent 1086-1327, Oxford, 1960, pp.75-6, Barony of Salwarpe in Worcestershire, a Norman who followed King William the Conqueror to England, and served as Sheriff of Worcestershire. His heir was his son-in-law Walter de Beauchamp (died 1130/3), whose descendant was William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick (c.1238-1298). The first Earl of Warwick was Henry de Beaumont (d.1119), younger son of Roger de Beaumont (d. circa 1094), who fought at the Battle of Hastings with William the Conqueror, by his wife Adeline de Meulan (c. 1014/20-1081), daughter and heiress of Waleran III, Count of Meulan. Henry's elder brother was Robert de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Leicester, Count of Meulan. The family name of \\"Beaumont\\" was Latinised to de Bello Monte (\\"from the beautiful mountain\\"); the Warwick branch of the family was also known as de Newburgh, Latinised to de Novo Burgo (\\"from the new borough/town\\"). Henry changed his name to \\"de Newburgh\\", after the Castle de Neubourg, his home in Normandy,Hutchins, John, The History and Antiquities of the County of Dorset, Vols. 1‚Äì4, 1815 an ancient Beaumont possession. Henry became Constable of Warwick Castle in 1068 and Earl of Warwick in 1088 as reward for his support for the king during the Rebellion of 1088. The title passed through several generations of the Beaumont family until 1242 when Thomas de Beaumont, 6th Earl of Warwick died without male issue. The earldom then went to his sister, Margaret de Beaumont, 7th Countess of Warwick and her successive husbands jure uxoris, and on her death to her cousin William Mauduit, 8th Earl of Warwick. When he died also without a male heir, the title passed to his sister, Isabel de Mauduit, and her husband Lord William de Beauchamp (d.1268), and thence to her son William de Beauchamp, 9th Earl of Warwick. During this period the Earldom and the Beauchamps were elevated to the highest levels until Henry de Beauchamp, 1st Duke of Warwick, 14th Earl of Warwick, was created Duke of Warwick with precedence over all except the Duke of Norfolk. This precedence was disputed however and with Henry's death in 1445, also without male issue, the dukedom was extinguished. The earldom went to his infant daughter, and on her death aged 5 a few years later passed to Henry's sister Anne de Beauchamp, 16th Countess of Warwick and her husband Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, who \\"succeeded in right of his wife\\" but was subsequently \\"confirmed\\" in that title on 23 July 1449 which confirmation he thereafter resigned and was definitively created Earl of Warwick by letters patent dated 2 March 1450, with his wife being similarly created Countess of Warwick.G. E. Cokayne. The Complete Peerage, n.s., XII, Part 2, p.385 He is known to history as \\"Warwick the Kingmaker\\" and died without male issue in 1471, aged 42, when the Earldom fell into abeyance between his two daughters. After Richard Neville's death the title was passed through his eldest daughter Isabel Neville to her husband George Plantagenet, 1st Duke of Clarence, younger brother of Kings Edward IV and Richard III, who on 25 March 1472 by letters patent was created Earl of Warwick (and Earl of Salisbury).Alison Weir, Britain's Royal Family: A Complete Genealogy (London, U.K.: The Bodley Head, 1999), page 136. Although he was so created, The Complete Peerage nevertheless terms him the 17th Earl of Warwick,G. E. Cokayne. The Complete Peerage, n.s., XII, Part 2, p.394 which suggests perhaps that the creation was considered a mere formality and confirmation of his inheritance. He was attainted and executed in 1478 whereupon his titles became forfeited. His Earldom was forfeited and thus not able to be inherited by his son Edward Plantagenet, who did however manage to inherit it from his maternal grandmother Anne de Beauchamp (d.1492), wife of \\"Warwick the Kingmaker\\", who had been created Countess of Warwick by letters patent in 1450, at the same time her husband was created Earl of Warwick. He thus became Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick, but on his beheading for treason in 1499 the title became forfeited. 1547 creation Arms of Dudley: Or, a lion rampant double-queued vert The title was next conferred upon the powerful statesman and soldier John Dudley, 1st Viscount Lisle. He had already been created Viscount Lisle in right of his deceased mother, Elizabeth Grey, in 1543, and was made Earl of Warwick in the Peerage of England in 1547. In 1551 he was further honoured when he was created Duke of Northumberland. In January 1553 Parliament passed the earldom to his eldest son John, the second Earl. He died young in 1554, and having been attainted along with his father in August 1553, the title became extinct until it was revived in 1561 for his younger brother Ambrose, the third Earl. He served as Master-General of the Ordnance and Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. On his death in 1590 the earldom became extinct. 1618 creation Arms of Rich: Gules, a chevron between three crosses boton√©e or The title was re-created when Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich, was made Earl of Warwick in 1618. This was despite the fact that the Rich family were not in possession of Warwick Castle (this was in the hands of the Greville family; see the 1759 creation below). His second son the Honourable Henry Rich was created Baron Kensington in 1623 and Earl of Holland in 1624. Lord Warwick was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Maldon in the House of Commons and served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex. His eldest son, the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Essex. He died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He represented Sandwich and Essex in Parliament. On his death the line of the second Earl of Warwick failed and the titles were inherited by his first cousin Robert Rich, 2nd Earl Holland, who became the fifth Earl of Warwick as well. He was the son of the aforementioned Henry Rich, 1st Earl of Holland, younger son of the first Earl of Warwick (see the Earl of Holland for earlier history of this branch of the family). This line of the family failed on the early death of his grandson, the seventh Earl, in 1721. The late Earl was succeeded by his second cousin Edward Rich, the eighth Earl. He was the grandson of the Hon. Cope Rich, younger son of the first Earl of Holland. On his death in 1759 all the titles became extinct. Lady Mary Rich, daughter of the first Earl of Holland, married Sir John Campbell, 5th Baronet, who was created Earl of Breadalbane and Holland in 1681. Also, Lady Elizabeth Rich, only daughter and heiress of the fifth Earl of Warwick and second Earl of Holland, married Francis Edwardes. Their son William Edwardes succeeded to parts of the Rich estates and was created Baron Kensington in the Peerage of Ireland in 1776, a revival of the barony attached to the earldom of Holland. Charles Rich, son of the Honourable Sir Edward Rich, younger son of the second Baron Rich, was created a baronet in 1676 (see Rich baronets). 1759 creation pellets all within a bordure engrailed of the second The title was again created in 1759 when Francis Greville, 8th Baron Brooke was made Earl of Warwick in the Peerage of Great Britain. In 1746 he had been created Earl Brooke, of Warwick Castle in the County of Warwick, in the Peerage of Great Britain. The earldom and Warwick Castle were thereby re-united for the first time in over a century. In 1767 the Earl petitioned the House of Lords for permission to use just the more prestigious title and style of \\"Earl of Warwick\\" only, with the precedence of 1746. Such permission was never granted but the Earls nevertheless ceased to use the Brooke earldom in style, and have always been known (except in the House of Lords) simply as The Earl of Warwick. The first Earl was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Warwick in Parliament and served as a Lord of Trade and as Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. His eldest son from his second marriage, the third Earl, sat as Member of Parliament for Warwick and held minor office in the second administration of Sir Robert Peel. He was also Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He represented Warwickshire South in the House of Commons.

It is a French-American interspecific hybrid grape variety used for making wine. Its parentage is uncertain. The hybrid was produced by Joannes Seyve who often used Seibel hybrids produced in the 1860s. The grape has only been available since 1963; it has a good resistance to fungal disease, and is one of the parents of the new disease resistant variety, Regent, which is increasing in popularity among German grape growers. Chambourcin is considered a very productive grape with crop yields reported ranging from 11.1 tons per hectare to 17.3 tons per hectare in a study performed by Ohio State University. Chambourcin wine Chambourcin wine from the Lower Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, Australia. The grape produces a deep-colored and aromatic wine. It can be made into a dry style or one with a moderate residual sugar level. Chambourcin is a teinturier, a grape whose juice is pink or red rather than clear like most red vitis vinifera cultivars. The red juice fermented over the red skins can produce a very strongly flavoured wine. Most red wines are served at room temperature to bring out the flavour but some Chambourcin wines have such a strong flavour that it is recommended that they be served chilled.BBQ Red Wine - http://www.sailfishcove.co.nz/product/bbq-red/ =Wine regions= Chambourcin has been planted widely in the mid-Atlantic region of North America, particularly in such states as New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania.

Reign As Arnold of L√ºbeck reports in his Chronica Slavorum, he was present at the meeting of Henry the Lion with Kilij-Arslan during the former's pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1172. When they met near Tarsus, the sultan embraced and kissed the German duke, reminding him that they were blood cousins ('amplexans et deosculans eum, dicens, eum consanguineum suum esse'). When the duke asked for details of this relationship, Kilij Arslan informed him that 'a noble lady from the land of Germans married a king of Russia who had a daughter by her; this daughter's daughter arrived to our land, and I descend from her.' In 1159, Kilij Arslan attacked Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus as he marched past Iconium (Konya, capital of R√ºm), as Manuel returned from negotiating with Nur ad-Din Zengi in Syria. In 1161 Manuel's nephew John Contostephanus defeated Kilij Arslan, and the sultan travelled to Constantinople in a show of submission. In 1173, Kilij Arslan, now at peace with the Byzantines, allied with Nur ad-Din against Mosul. Tomb of Kilij Arslan II in the courtyard of Al√¢eddin Mosque, Konya The peace treaty with the Byzantines lasted until 1175, when Kilij Arslan refused to hand over to Manuel the territory conquered from the Danishmends, although both sides had for some time been building up their fortifications and armies in preparation for a renewed war. Kilij Arslan tried to negotiate, but Manuel invaded the sultanate in 1176, intending to capture Iconium itself. Kilij Arslan was able to defeat Emperor Manuel I Komnenos's army at the Battle of Myriokephalon, the Sultan forced the emperor to negotiate a fragile peace. In 1179, Kilij Arslan captured and held to ransom Henry I, the renowned count of Champagne, who was returning overland from a visit to Jerusalem. The ransom was paid by the Byzantine Emperor and Henry was released, but died soon afterwards. In 1180, the sultan took advantage of the instability in the Byzantine Empire after Manuel's death to secure most of the southern coast of Anatolia, and sent his vizier Ikhtiyar al-Din to conclude an alliance with Saladin, Nur ad-Din's successor, that same year. Then in 1182, he succeeded in capturing the city of Cotyaeum from the Byzantines. In 1185, he made peace with Emperor Isaac II Angelus, but the next year he transferred power to his eleven sons, who immediately fought each other for control. Despite Kilij Arslan's alliance with Saladin, he promised the armies of the Third Crusade, led by Frederick Barbarossa to freely pass through his territories; however, his sons who were local chieftains disagreed and fought against the Crusaders at the Battle of Philomelion and Battle of Iconium. Following the Crusaders departure, his eldest son Qutb al-Din who led the Turks in the latter battle then fled afterwards, came back to control Konya; hence, Kilij Arslan II escaped and took refuge in Kayseri. Later on, Qutb al- Din declared himself to be the new Sultan, but his father and his brother Kaykhusraw I drove him out of Konya in 1192, then chased him to Aksaray, and besieged the city. Kilij Arslan II died during the siege of Aksaray in 1192, aged 77, after promising Kaykhusraw I the succession. Then he was buried in the Al√¢eddin Kosku in Konya. Kaykhusraw I's brothers continued to fight for control of the other parts of the sultanate. Children In 1186, Kilij Arslan II decided to divided the Sultanate among his 11 sons as follows: # Qutb al-Din (Sivas, Aksaray) # Rukn al-Din (Tokat and its surroundings) # Nur al-Din (Kayseri and its surroundings) # Muqsed al-Din (Elbistan) # Muiz al-Din (Malatya) # Muhyiddin Mesut (Ankara, Cankiri, Kastamonu and Eski≈üehir) # Kaykhusraw I (Uluborlu, Kutahya) # Naser al-Din (Niksar, Koyulhisar) # Nizam al-Din (Amasya) # Arslanshah (Niƒüde) # Sancarshah (Ereƒüli and its south) Notes References Sources  1192 deaths Sultans of Rum Muslims of the Third Crusade Year of birth unknown Seljuq dynasty ","title":"Kilij Arslan II"},{"id":"294284","text":"Joseph Norman Alessi (born September 20, 1959) is an American classical trombonist who is currently the principal trombonist of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and a soloist, teacher/clinician and recording artist. Life Joseph Norman Alessi was born in Detroit, Michigan and attended high school in San Rafael, California. His father, also named Joseph Alessi, was a professional trumpet player, and his mother, Maria (n√©e Leone) sang in the Metropolitan Opera chorus. His younger brother Ralph Alessi is a jazz trumpeter. Displaying notable talent himself from an early age, Alessi graduated early from high school at age 16 and successfully auditioned to join the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra. During this time he appeared as a soloist with the San Francisco Symphony. In 1976-77, following a previously unsuccessful audition, Alessi gained entry to the Curtis Institute of Music (in Philadelphia), where he studied until 1980.Joseph Alessi - Classical Archives Career During his third year at Curtis, Alessi joined the Philadelphia Orchestra as interim Second Trombone; he later won the job permanently and performed with the orchestra for four seasons. Following one season as Principal Trombone at the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, Alessi joined the New York Philharmonic as Principal Trombone in the Spring of 1985. Alessi made his solo debut with the New York Philharmonic in 1990 when he performed the Fantasy for Trombone by Paul Creston. In 1992, he performed with the New York Philharmonic in the world premiere of the Trombone Concerto by Christopher Rouse, which later received the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Music. Alessi has since developed an increasingly active solo career, performing throughout the United States and internationally. His discography consists of over 14 full-length albums, in addition to guest appearances on albums by other artists. Recordings of the Rouse Concerto have been released by the New York Philharmonic and the Colorado Symphony, both featuring Alessi as soloist. His 1999 recording of Star-Child, by George Crumb, was voted Best Classical Contemporary Composition at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. Alessi joined the faculty of the Juilliard School in 1986, shortly after joining the New York Philharmonic. The Juilliard trombone studio has since furthered its international reputation as one of the finest trombone college programs, and the Juilliard Trombone Choir has regularly performed with Alessi on his recording projects. Since 1999 Alessi has conducted the Alessi Seminar; a biennial trombone workshop that attracts trombonists from around the world to spend time with him in lessons, masterclasses, and recitals.Trombone Master Class with Joseph Alessi of the New York Philharmonic  Goldstar Several of his past students now occupy senior positions in major orchestras throughout the world. Joseph Alessi and Swedish trombone virtuoso Christian Lindberg are widely regarded as the finest players of the instrument today, arguably the finest in history. In recognition of Alessi's immense contributions to the trombone community, he was awarded the 2002 ITA Award, the most prestigious award offered by the International Trombone Association. Playing style Joseph Alessi's playing is often noted for refined musicianship, a particularly rich sound quality and complete technical control. The music he chooses to play is mainly romantic and modern (but mainly tonal) music, while also developing his jazz playing.

It is an organophosphorus compound, specifically a phosphonate, which acts by inhibiting the plant enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase. It is used to kill weeds, especially annual broadleaf weeds and grasses that compete with crops. It was discovered to be an herbicide by Monsanto chemist John E. Franz in 1970. Monsanto brought it to market for agricultural use in 1974 under the trade name Roundup. Monsanto's last commercially relevant United States patent expired in 2000. Farmers quickly adopted glyphosate for agricultural weed control, especially after Monsanto introduced glyphosate-resistant Roundup Ready crops, enabling farmers to kill weeds without killing their crops. In 2007, glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the United States' agricultural sector and the second-most used (after 2,4-D) in home and garden, government and industry, and commercial applications.United States EPA 2007 Pesticide Market Estimates Agriculture, Home and Garden From the late 1970s to 2016, there was a 100-fold increase in the frequency and volume of application of glyphosate-based herbicides (GBHs) worldwide, with further increases expected in the future. This was partly in response to the global emergence and spread of glyphosate-resistant weeds, requiring greater application to maintain effectiveness. The development of glyphosate resistance in weed species is emerging as a costly problem. Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage, and minimally through roots, and transported to growing points. It inhibits a plant enzyme involved in the synthesis of three aromatic amino acids: tyrosine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. It is therefore effective only on actively growing plants and is not effective as a pre-emergence herbicide. An increasing number of crops have been genetically engineered to be tolerant of glyphosate (e.g. Roundup Ready soybean, the first Roundup Ready crop, also created by Monsanto), which allows farmers to use glyphosate as a post- emergence herbicide against weeds. While glyphosate and formulations such as Roundup have been approved by regulatory bodies worldwide, concerns about their effects on humans and the environment persist, and have grown as the global usage of glyphosate increases. A number of regulatory and scholarly reviews have evaluated the relative toxicity of glyphosate as an herbicide. The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment toxicology review in 2013 found that \\"the available data is contradictory and far from being convincing\\" with regard to correlations between exposure to glyphosate formulations and risk of various cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). A meta-analysis published in 2014 identified an increased risk of NHL in workers exposed to glyphosate formulations. In March 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate as \\"probably carcinogenic in humans\\" (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. In contrast, the European Food Safety Authority concluded in November 2015 that \\"the substance is unlikely to be genotoxic (i.e. damaging to DNA) or to pose a carcinogenic threat to humans\\", later clarifying that while carcinogenic glyphosate-containing formulations may exist, studies \\"that look solely at the active substance glyphosate do not show this effect.\\" The WHO and FAO Joint committee on pesticide residues issued a report in 2016 stating the use of glyphosate formulations does not necessarily constitute a health risk, and giving admissible daily maximum intake limits (one milligram/kg of body weight per day) for chronic toxicity. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) classified glyphosate as causing serious eye damage and toxic to aquatic life, but did not find evidence implicating it as a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs. Discovery Glyphosate was first synthesized in 1950 by Swiss chemist Henry Martin, who worked for the Swiss company Cilag. The work was never published. Stauffer Chemical patented the agent as a chemical chelator in 1964 as it binds and removes minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese, copper, and zinc. Somewhat later, glyphosate was independently discovered in the United States at Monsanto in 1970. Monsanto chemists had synthesized about 100 derivatives of aminomethylphosphonic acid as potential water-softening agents. Two were found to have weak herbicidal activity, and John E. Franz, a chemist at Monsanto, was asked to try to make analogs with stronger herbicidal activity. Glyphosate was the third analog he made. Franz received the National Medal of Technology of the United States in 1987 and the Perkin Medal for Applied Chemistry in 1990 for his discoveries. Monsanto developed and patented the use of glyphosate to kill weeds in the early 1970s and first brought it to market in 1974, under the Roundup brandname. While its initial patent expired in 1991, Monsanto retained exclusive rights in the United States until its patent on the isopropylamine salt expired in September 2000. In 2008, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) scientist Stephen O. Duke and Stephen B. Powles ‚Äì an Australian weed expert ‚Äì described glyphosate as a \\"virtually ideal\\" herbicide. In 2010 Powles stated: \\"glyphosate is a one in a 100-year discovery that is as important for reliable global food production as penicillin is for battling disease.\\" As of April 2017, the Canadian government stated that glyphosate was \\"the most widely used herbicide in Canada\\", at which date the product labels were revised to ensure a limit of 20% POEA by weight. Chemistry Ionic states of glyphosate Glyphosate is an aminophosphonic analogue of the natural amino acid glycine and, like all amino acids, exists in different ionic states depending on pH. Both the phosphonic acid and carboxylic acid moieties can be ionised and the amine group can be protonated and the substance exists as a series of zwitterions. Glyphosate is soluble in water to 12 g/l at room temperature. The original synthetic approach to glyphosate involved the reaction of phosphorus trichloride with formaldehyde followed by hydrolysis to yield a phosphonate. Glycine is then reacted with this phosphonate to yield glyphosate, and its name is taken as a contraction of the compounds used in this synthesis, namely glycine and a phosphonate. :PCl3 \\\\+ H2CO ‚Üí Cl2P(=O)‚àíCH2Cl :Cl2P(=O)‚àíCH2Cl + 2 H2O ‚Üí (HO)2P(=O)‚àíCH2Cl + 2 HCl :(HO)2P(=O)‚àíCH2Cl + H2N‚àíCH2‚àíCOOH ‚Üí (HO)2P(=O)‚àíCH2‚àíNH‚àíCH2‚àíCOOH + HCl The main deactivation path for glyphosate is hydrolysis to aminomethylphosphonic acid. =Synthesis= Two main approaches are used to synthesize glyphosate industrially. The first is to react iminodiacetic acid with phosphorous acid and hydrochloric acid (sometimes formed in situ by addition of phosphorus trichloride) via a modified Mannich reaction. Oxidation then leads to the desired glyphosate product. Iminodiacetic acid is usually prepared on-site by various methods depending on reagent availability. :Iminodiacetic acid approach to glyphosate synthesis The second involves hydrophosphonylation, using dimethyl phosphite in a one-pot synthesis. Glycine and paraformaldehyde are reacted in a suitable organic solvent (typically triethylamine and methanol) to produce bishydroxymethylglycine, (HOCH2)2NCH2COOH. Dimethyl phosphite is then introduced, which leads to a substitution reaction of the hydroxyl of one of the two hydroxymethyl groups. Work-up with hydrochloric acid and heat cleaves the remaining hydroxymethyl group from the nitrogen atom and hydrolyzes both phosphate ester linkages. :Glyphosate synthesis from dimethyl phosphite This synthetic approach is responsible for a substantial portion of the production of glyphosate in China, with considerable work having gone into recycling the triethylamine and methanol. Progress has also been made in attempting to eliminate the need for triethylamine altogether. =Impurities= Technical grade glyphosate is a white powder which, according to FAO specification, should contain not less than 95% glyphosate. Formaldehyde, classified as a known human carcinogen, and N-nitrosoglyphosate, have been identified as toxicologically relevant impurities. The FAO specification limits the formaldehyde concentration to a maximum of 1.3 g/kg glyphosate. N-Nitrosoglyphosate, \\"belonging to a group of impurities of particular concern as they can be activated to genotoxic carcinogens\\", should not exceed 1 ppm. Formulations Monsanto's Roundup is the earliest formulation of glyphosate. Glyphosate is marketed in the United States and worldwide by many agrochemical companies, in different solution strengths and with various adjuvants, under dozens of tradenames.Farm Chemicals International Glyphosate entry in Crop Protection Database As of 2010, more than 750 glyphosate products were on the market.National Pesticide Information Center. Last updated September 2010 Glyphosate General Fact Sheet In 2012, about half of the total global consumption of glyphosate by volume was for agricultural crops, with forestry comprising another important market.monsanto.ca: \\"Vision Silviculture Herbicide\\", 03-FEB-2011 Asia and the Pacific was the largest and fastest growing regional market. As of 2014, Chinese manufacturers collectively are the world's largest producers of glyphosate and its precursorsChina Research & Intelligence, June 5, 2013. Research Report on Global and China Glyphosate Industry, 2013‚Äì2017 and account for about 30% of global exports. Key manufacturers include Anhui Huaxing Chemical Industry Company, BASF, Bayer CropScience (which also acquired the maker of glyphosate, Monsanto), Dow AgroSciences, DuPont, Jiangsu Good Harvest-Weien Agrochemical Company, Nantong Jiangshan Agrochemical & Chemicals Co., Nufarm, SinoHarvest, Syngenta, and Zhejiang Xinan Chemical Industrial Group Company. Glyphosate is an acid molecule, so it is formulated as a salt for packaging and handling. Various salt formulations include isopropylamine, diammonium, monoammonium, or potassium as the counterion. The active ingredient of the Monsanto herbicides is the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate. Another important ingredient in some formulations is the surfactant polyethoxylated tallow amine. Some brands include more than one salt. Some companies report their product as acid equivalent (ae) of glyphosate acid, or some report it as active ingredient (ai) of glyphosate plus the salt, and others report both. To compare performance of different formulations, knowledge of how the products were formulated is needed. Given that different salts have different weights, the acid equivalent is a more accurate method of expressing and comparing concentrations. Adjuvant loading refers to the amount of adjuvant already added to the glyphosate product. Fully loaded products contain all the necessary adjuvants, including surfactant; some contain no adjuvant system, while other products contain only a limited amount of adjuvant (minimal or partial loading) and additional surfactants must be added to the spray tank before application. Products are supplied most commonly in formulations of 120, 240, 360, 480, and 680 g/l of active ingredient. The most common formulation in agriculture is 360 g/l, either alone or with added cationic surfactants.Alberta Agriculture and Rural Development. April 26, 2006. Quick Guide to Glyphosate Products ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions For 360 g/l formulations, European regulations allow applications of up to 12 l/ha for control of perennial weeds such as couch grass. More commonly, rates of 3 l/ha are practiced for control of annual weeds between crops. Mode of action Glyphosate interferes with the shikimate pathway, which produces the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan in plants and microorganisms ‚Äì but does not exist in the genome of mammals, including humans. It blocks this pathway by inhibiting the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), which catalyzes the reaction of shikimate-3-phosphate (S3P) and phosphoenolpyruvate to form 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP). Glyphosate is absorbed through foliage and minimally through roots, meaning that it is only effective on actively growing plants and cannot prevent seeds from germinating. After application, glyphosate is readily transported around the plant to growing roots and leaves and this systemic activity is important for its effectiveness. Inhibiting the enzyme causes shikimate to accumulate in plant tissues and diverts energy and resources away from other processes, eventually killing the plant. While growth stops within hours of application, it takes several days for the leaves to begin turning yellow. upright=3 Under normal circumstances, EPSP is dephosphorylated to chorismate, an essential precursor for the amino acids mentioned above.Purdue University, Department of Horticulture and Landscape Architecture, Metabolic Plant Physiology Lecture notes, Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, The shikimate pathway ‚Äì synthesis of chorismate. These amino acids are used in protein synthesis and to produce secondary metabolites such as folates, ubiquinones, and naphthoquinone. X-ray crystallographic studies of glyphosate and EPSPS show that glyphosate functions by occupying the binding site of the phosphoenolpyruvate, mimicking an intermediate state of the ternary enzyme‚Äìsubstrate complex.Glyphosate bound to proteins in the Protein Data Bank Glyphosate inhibits the EPSPS enzymes of different species of plants and microbes at different rates. Uses Estimated use of glyphosate in the US in 2013 and estimated total use from 1992‚Äì2013 Glyphosate is effective in killing a wide variety of plants, including grasses and broadleaf and woody plants. By volume, it is one of the most widely used herbicides. In 2007, glyphosate was the most used herbicide in the United States agricultural sector, with 180 to 185 million pounds () applied, the second-most used in home and garden with 5 to 8 million pounds () and government applied 13 to 15 million pounds () in industry and commerce. It is commonly used for agriculture, horticulture, viticulture, and silviculture purposes, as well as garden maintenance (including home use). It has a relatively small effect on some clover species and morning glory. Glyphosate used as an alternative to mowing in an apple orchard in Ciardes, Italy Glyphosate and related herbicides are often used in invasive species eradication and habitat restoration, especially to enhance native plant establishment in prairie ecosystems. The controlled application is usually combined with a selective herbicide and traditional methods of weed eradication such as mulching to achieve an optimal effect. In many cities, glyphosate is sprayed along the sidewalks and streets, as well as crevices in between pavement where weeds often grow. However, up to 24% of glyphosate applied to hard surfaces can be run off by water. Glyphosate contamination of surface water is attributed to urban and agricultural use. Glyphosate is used to clear railroad tracks and get rid of unwanted aquatic vegetation. Since 1994, glyphosate has been used in aerial spraying in Colombia in coca eradication programs; Colombia announced in May 2015 that by October, it would cease using glyphosate in these programs due to concerns about human toxicity of the chemical.BBC. May 10, 2015. Colombia to ban coca spraying herbicide glyphosate Glyphosate is also used for crop desiccation (siccation) to increase harvest yield and uniformity. Glyphosate itself is not a chemical desiccant; rather glyphosate application just before harvest kills the crop plants so that the food crop dries from environmental conditions (\\"dry-down\\") more quickly and evenly. Because glyphosate is systemic, excess residue levels can persist in plants due to incorrect application and this may render the crop unfit for sale. When applied appropriately, it can promote useful effects. In sugarcane, for example, glyphosate application increases sucrose concentration before harvest. In grain crops (wheat, barley, oats), uniformly dried crops do not have to be windrowed (swathed and dried) prior to harvest, but can easily be straight-cut and harvested. This saves the farmer time and money, which is important in northern regions where the growing season is short, and it enhances grain storage when the grain has a lower and more uniform moisture content. =Genetically modified crops= Some micro- organisms have a version of 5-enolpyruvoyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthetase (EPSPS) resistant to glyphosate inhibition. A version of the enzyme that was both resistant to glyphosate and that was still efficient enough to drive adequate plant growth was identified by Monsanto scientists after much trial and error in an Agrobacterium strain called CP4, which was found surviving in a waste-fed column at a glyphosate production facility. This CP4 EPSPS gene was cloned and transfected into soybeans. In 1996, genetically modified soybeans were made commercially available. Current glyphosate-resistant crops include soy, maize (corn), canola, alfalfa, sugar beets, and cotton, with wheat still under development. In 2015, 89% of corn, 94% of soybeans, and 89% of cotton produced in the United States were from strains that were genetically modified to be herbicide-tolerant. Environmental fate Glyphosate strongly sorbs onto soil minerals, and, exception made of colloid- facilitated transport, its soluble residues are expected to be poorly mobile in the free porewater of soils. The spatial extent of ground and surface water pollution is therefore considered to be relatively limited. Glyphosate is readily degraded by soil microbes to aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA, which like glyphosate strongly adsorbs to soil solids and is thus unlikely to leach to groundwater). Though both glyphosate and AMPA are commonly detected in water bodies, a portion of the AMPA detected may actually be the result of degradation of detergents rather than from glyphosate. Glyphosate does have the potential to contaminate surface waters due to its aquatic use patterns and through erosion, as it adsorbs to colloidal soil particles suspended in runoff. Detection in surface waters (particularly downstream from agricultural uses) has been reported as both broad and frequent by USGS researchers, although other similar research found equal frequencies of detection in urban- dominated small streams. Rain events can trigger dissolved glyphosate loss in transport-prone soils. The mechanism of glyphosate sorption to soil is similar to that of phosphate fertilizers, the presence of which can reduce glyphosate sorption. Phosphate fertilizers are subject to release from sediments into water bodies under anaerobic conditions, and similar release can also occur with glyphosate, though significant impact of glyphosate release from sediments has not been established. Limited leaching can occur after high rainfall after application. If glyphosate reaches surface water, it is not broken down readily by water or sunlight. The half-life of glyphosate in soil ranges between 2 and 197 days; a typical field half-life of 47 days has been suggested. Soil and climate conditions affect glyphosate's persistence in soil. The median half-life of glyphosate in water varies from a few to 91 days. At a site in Texas, half-life was as little as three days. A site in Iowa had a half-life of 141.9 days. The glyphosate metabolite AMPA has been found in Swedish forest soils up to two years after a glyphosate application. In this case, the persistence of AMPA was attributed to the soil being frozen for most of the year. Glyphosate adsorption to soil, and later release from soil, varies depending on the kind of soil. Glyphosate is generally less persistent in water than in soil, with 12- to 60-day persistence observed in Canadian ponds, although persistence of over a year has been recorded in the sediments of American ponds. The half-life of glyphosate in water is between 12 days and 10 weeks. =Residues in food products= According to the National Pesticide Information Center fact sheet, glyphosate is not included in compounds tested for by the Food and Drug Administration's Pesticide Residue Monitoring Program, nor in the United States Department of Agriculture's Pesticide Data Program. However, a field test showed that lettuce, carrots, and barley contained glyphosate residues up to one year after the soil was treated with 3.71 lb of glyphosate per acre (4.15 kg per hectare). The U.S. has determined the acceptable daily intake of glyphosate at 1.75 milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight per day (mg/kg/bw/day) while the European Union has set it at 0.5. Pesticide residue controls carried out by EU Member States in 2016 analysed 6,761 samples of food products for glyphosate residues. 3.6% of the samples contained quantifiable glyphosate residue levels with 19 samples (0.28%) exceeding the European maximum residue levels (MRLs), which included six samples of honey and other apicultural products (MRL = 0.05 mg/kg) and eleven samples of buckwheat and other pseudo‚Äêcereals (MRL = 0.1 mg/kg). Glyphosate residues below the European MRLs were most frequently found in dry lentils, linseeds, soya beans, dry peas, tea, buckwheat, barley, wheat and rye. Toxicity Glyphosate is the active ingredient in herbicide formulations containing it. However, in addition to glyphosate salts, commercial formulations of glyphosate contain additives (known as adjuvants) such as surfactants, which vary in nature and concentration. Surfactants such as polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) are added to glyphosate to enable it to wet the leaves and penetrate the cuticle of the plants. =Glyphosate alone= Humans The acute oral toxicity for mammals is low, but death has been reported after deliberate overdose of concentrated formulations. The surfactants in glyphosate formulations can increase the relative acute toxicity of the formulation. In a 2017 risk assessment, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) wrote: \\"There is very limited information on skin irritation in humans. Where skin irritation has been reported, it is unclear whether it is related to glyphosate or co-formulants in glyphosate-containing herbicide formulations.\\" The ECHA concluded that available human data was insufficient to support classification for skin corrosion or irritation. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate. Cancer The consensus among national pesticide regulatory agencies and scientific organizations is that labeled uses of glyphosate have demonstrated no evidence of human carcinogenicity. The Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR), the European Commission, the Canadian Pest Management Regulatory Agency, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority and the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment have concluded that there is no evidence that glyphosate poses a carcinogenic or genotoxic risk to humans. The EPA has classified glyphosate as \\"not likely to be carcinogenic to humans.\\" One international scientific organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, classified glyphosate in Group 2A, \\"probably carcinogenic to humans\\" in 2015. There is weak evidence human cancer risk might increase as a result of occupational exposure to large amounts of glyphosate, such as agricultural work, but no good evidence of such a risk from home use, such as in domestic gardening. According to a systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2016, when weak statistical associations with cancer have been found, such observations have been attributed to bias and confounding in correlational studies due to workers often being exposed to other known carcinogens. The review reported that studies that show an effect between glyphosate use and non-Hodgkin lymphoma have been criticized for not assessing these factors, underlying quality of studies being reviewed, or whether the relationship is causal rather than only correlational. Writing for the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental advocacy group, Jennifer Sass criticized the influence exerted by Monsanto on research about glyphosate safety, and noted that the review was funded by Monsanto. A meta-analysis published in 2019 looked at whether there was an association between an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans and high cumulative exposures to glyphosate-based herbicides. The analysis used the most recent update of the Agricultural Health Study cohort published in 2018 and five case-control studies published in 2019. The research found a \\"compelling link\\" between exposures to glyphosate-based herbicides and increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Other mammals Amongst mammals, glyphosate is considered to have \\"low to very low toxicity\\". The LD50 of glyphosate is 5,000 mg/kg for rats, 10,000 mg/kg in mice and 3,530 mg/kg in goats. The acute dermal LD50 in rabbits is greater than 2,000 mg/kg. Indications of glyphosate toxicity in animals typically appear within 30 to 120 minutes following ingestion of a large enough dose, and include initial excitability and tachycardia, ataxia, depression, and bradycardia, although severe toxicity can develop into collapse and convulsions. A review of unpublished short-term rabbit-feeding studies reported severe toxicity effects at 150 mg/kg/day and \\"no observed adverse effect level\\" doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg/kg/day. Glyphosate can have carcinogenic effects in nonhuman mammals. These include the induction of positive trends in the incidence of renal tubule carcinoma and haemangiosarcoma in male mice, and increased pancreatic islet-cell adenoma in male rats. In reproductive toxicity studies performed in rats and rabbits, no adverse maternal or offspring effects were seen at doses below 175‚Äì293 mg/kg/day. Glyphosate-based herbicides may cause life-threatening arrhythmias in mammals. Evidence also shows that such herbicides cause direct electrophysiological changes in the cardiovascular systems of rats and rabbits. Aquatic fauna In many freshwater invertebrates, glyphosate has a 48-hour LC50 ranging from 55 to 780 ppm. The 96-hour LC50 is 281 ppm for grass shrimp (Palaemonetas vulgaris) and 934 ppm for fiddler crabs (Uca pagilator). These values make glyphosate \\"slightly toxic to practically non- toxic\\". Antimicrobial activity The antimicrobial activity of glyphosate has been described in the microbiology literature since its discovery in 1970 and the description of glyphosate's mechanism of action in 1972. Efficacy was described for numerous bacteria and fungi.Abraham William Wildwood. Glyphosate formulations and their use for inhibition of 5-enolpyrovylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase, US Patent 7, 771, 736 B2; 2010 Glyphosate can control the growth of apicomplexan parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium falciparum (malaria), and Cryptosporidium parvum, and has been considered an antimicrobial agent in mammals. Inhibition can occur with some Rhizobium species important for soybean nitrogen fixation, especially under moisture stress. Soil biota Degradation pathway of glyphosate in the ground When glyphosate comes into contact with the soil, it can be bound to soil particles, thereby slowing its degradation. Glyphosate and its degradation product, aminomethylphosphonic acid are considered to be much more benign toxicologically and environmentally than most of the herbicides replaced by glyphosate. A 2016 meta-analysis concluded that at typical application rates glyphosate had no effect on soil microbial biomass or respiration. A 2016 review noted that contrasting effects of glyphosate on earthworms have been found in different experiments with some species unaffected, but others losing weight or avoiding treated soil. Further research is required to determine the impact of glyphosate on earthworms in complex ecosystems. Endocrine disruption In 2007, the EPA selected glyphosate for further screening through its Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP). Selection for this program is based on a compound's prevalence of use and does not imply particular suspicion of endocrine activity. On June 29, 2015, the EPA released Weight of Evidence Conclusion of the EDSP Tier 1 screening for glyphosate, recommending that glyphosate not be considered for Tier 2 testing. The Weight of Evidence conclusion stated \\"...there was no convincing evidence of potential interaction with the estrogen, androgen or thyroid pathways.\\" A review of the evidence by the European Food Safety Authority published in September 2017 showed conclusions similar to those of the EPA report. Effect on plant health Some studies have found causal relationships between glyphosate and increased or decreased disease resistance. Exposure to glyphosate has been shown to change the species composition of endophytic bacteria in plant hosts, which is highly variable. =Glyphosate-based formulations= Glyphosate-based formulations may contain a number of adjuvants, the identities of which may be proprietary. Surfactants are used in herbicide formulations as wetting agents, to maximize coverage and aid penetration of the herbicide(s) through plant leaves. As agricultural spray adjuvants, surfactants may be pre-mixed into commercial formulations or they may be purchased separately and mixed on-site. Polyethoxylated tallow amine (POEA) is a surfactant used in the original Roundup formulation and was commonly used in 2015. Different versions of Roundup have included different percentages of POEA. A 1997 US government report said that Roundup is 15% POEA while Roundup Pro is 14.5%. Since POEA is more toxic to fish and amphibians than glyphosate alone, POEA is not allowed in aquatic formulations.Gary L. Diamond and Patrick R. Durkin February 6, 1997, under contract from the United States Department of Agriculture. Effects of Surfactants on the Toxicity of Glyphosate, with Specific Reference to RODEO A 2000 review of the ecotoxicological data on Roundup shows at least 58 studies exist on the effects of Roundup on a range of organisms. This review concluded that \\"...for terrestrial uses of Roundup minimal acute and chronic risk was predicted for potentially exposed non-target organisms\\". Human Acute toxicity and chronic toxicity are dose-related. Skin exposure to ready-to-use concentrated glyphosate formulations can cause irritation, and photocontact dermatitis has been occasionally reported. These effects are probably due to the preservative benzisothiazolin-3-one. Severe skin burns are very rare. Inhalation is a minor route of exposure, but spray mist may cause oral or nasal discomfort, an unpleasant taste in the mouth, or tingling and irritation in the throat. Eye exposure may lead to mild conjunctivitis. Superficial corneal injury is possible if irrigation is delayed or inadequate. Death has been reported after deliberate overdose. Ingestion of Roundup ranging from 85 to 200 ml (of 41% solution) has resulted in death within hours of ingestion, although it has also been ingested in quantities as large as 500 ml with only mild or moderate symptoms. Adult consumption of more than 85 ml of concentrated product can lead to corrosive esophageal burns and kidney or liver damage. More severe cases cause \\"respiratory distress, impaired consciousness, pulmonary edema, infiltration on chest X-ray, shock, arrhythmias, renal failure requiring haemodialysis, metabolic acidosis, and hyperkalaemia\\" and death is often preceded by bradycardia and ventricular arrhythmias. While the surfactants in formulations generally do not increase the toxicity of glyphosate itself, it is likely that they contribute to its acute toxicity. A 2000 review concluded that \\"under present and expected conditions of new use, there is no potential for Roundup herbicide to pose a health risk to humans\\". A 2012 meta-analysis of epidemiological studies (seven cohort studies and fourteen case-control studies) of exposure to glyphosate formulations found no correlation with any kind of cancer. The 2013 systematic review by the German Institute for Risk Assessment of epidemiological studies of workers who use pesticides, exposed to glyphosate formulations found no significant risk, stating that \\"the available data are contradictory and far from being convincing\\". However, a 2014 meta-analysis of the same studies found a correlation between occupational exposure to glyphosate formulations and increased risk of B cell lymphoma, the most common kind of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Workers exposed to glyphosate were about twice as likely to get B cell lymphoma. A 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis found no causal relationship between glyphosate exposure and risk of any type of lymphohematopoietic cancer including non-Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma. The same review noted that the positive associations found may be due to bias and confounding. The Natural Resources Defense Council has criticized that review, noting that it was funded by Monsanto. A 2015 systematic review of 10 observational studies found that except for an excess of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder among children born to glyphosate appliers, there was no evidence that glyphosate exposure among pregnant mothers caused adverse developmental outcomes in their children. Noting the limited size and scope of the review articles available, the authors noted that \\"these negative findings cannot be taken as definitive evidence that GLY, at current levels of occupational and environmental exposures, brings no risk for human development and reproduction.\\" Aquatic fauna Glyphosate products for aquatic use generally do not use surfactants, and aquatic formulations do not use POEA due to aquatic organism toxicity. Due to the presence of POEA, such glyphosate formulations only allowed for terrestrial use are more toxic for amphibians and fish than glyphosate alone. The half-life of POEA (21‚Äì42 days) is longer than that for glyphosate (7‚Äì14 days) in aquatic environments. Aquatic organism exposure risk to terrestrial formulations with POEA is limited to drift or temporary water pockets where concentrations would be much lower than label rates. Some researchers have suggested the toxicity effects of pesticides on amphibians may be different from those of other aquatic fauna because of their lifestyle; amphibians may be more susceptible to the toxic effects of pesticides because they often prefer to breed in shallow, lentic, or ephemeral pools. These habitats do not necessarily constitute formal water-bodies and can contain higher concentrations of pesticide compared to larger water- bodies. Studies in a variety of amphibians have shown the toxicity of GBFs containing POEA to amphibian larvae. These effects include interference with gill morphology and mortality from either the loss of osmotic stability or asphyxiation. At sub-lethal concentrations, exposure to POEA or glyphosate/POEA formulations have been associated with delayed development, accelerated development, reduced size at metamorphosis, developmental malformations of the tail, mouth, eye and head, histological indications of intersex and symptoms of oxidative stress. Glyphosate-based formulations can cause oxidative stress in bullfrog tadpoles. A 2003 study of various formulations of glyphosate found, \\"[the] risk assessments based on estimated and measured concentrations of glyphosate that would result from its use for the control of undesirable plants in wetlands and over-water situations showed that the risk to aquatic organisms is negligible or small at application rates less than 4 kg/ha and only slightly greater at application rates of 8 kg/ha.\\" A 2013 meta-analysis reviewed the available data related to potential impacts of glyphosate-based herbicides on amphibians. According to the authors, the use of glyphosate-based pesticides cannot be considered the major cause of amphibian decline, the bulk of which occurred prior to the widespread use of glyphosate or in pristine tropical areas with minimal glyphosate exposure. The authors recommended further study of species- and development-stage chronic toxicity, of environmental glyphosate levels, and ongoing analysis of data relevant to determining what if any role glyphosate might be playing in worldwide amphibian decline, and suggest including amphibians in standardized test batteries. Genetic damage Several studies have not found mutagenic effects,ToxNet. Glyposate. National Library of Medicine. so glyphosate has not been listed in the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the International Agency for Research on Cancer databases. Various other studies suggest glyphosate may be mutagenic. The IARC monograph noted that glyphosate-based formulations can cause DNA strand breaks in various taxa of animals in vitro. =Government and organization positions= European Food Safety Authority A 2013 systematic review by the German Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) examined more than 1000 epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. It found that \\"no classification and labelling for carcinogenicity is warranted\\" and did not recommend a carcinogen classification of either 1A or 1B. It provided the review to EFSA in January 2014 which published it in December 2014.Renewal Assessment Report: Glyphosate. Volume 1. Report and Proposed Decision. December 18, 2013. German Institute for Risk Assessment, page 65. Downloaded from http://dar.efsa.europa.eu/dar-web/provision (registration required) In November 2015, EFSA published its conclusion in the Renewal Assessment Report (RAR), stating it was \\"unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans\\". The EU was largely informed by this report when it made its decision on the use of glyphosate in November 2017. EFSA's decision and the BfR report were criticized in an open letter published by 96 scientists in November 2015 saying that the BfR report failed to adhere to accepted scientific principles of open and transparent procedures. The BfR report included unpublished data, lacked authorship, omitted references, and did not disclose conflict-of- interest information. In April 2016, Dr. Vytenis Andriukaitis, European Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, wrote an open letter to the Chair of the Board of the Glyphosate Task at Monsanto Europe asking to publish the full studies provided to the EFSA. In September 2017, The Guardian reported that sections of the Renewal Assessment Report prepared by the BfR and used by Efsa were copy-pasted from a study done by Monsanto. Some sections of copy contained small changes such as using British spelling rather than American forms but others were copied word for word, including most of the peer- reviewed papers that were used in the report. The Guardian reported that a \\"Monsanto spokesperson said that Efsa allowed renewal reports to be written this way because of the large volume of toxicological studies submitted.\\" US Environmental Protection Agency In a 1993 review, the EPA, considered glyphosate to be noncarcinogenic and relatively low in dermal and oral acute toxicity. The EPA considered a \\"worst case\\" dietary risk model of an individual eating a lifetime of food derived entirely from glyphosate- sprayed fields with residues at their maximum levels. This model indicated that no adverse health effects would be expected under such conditions. In 2015, the EPA initiated a review of glyphosate's toxicity and in 2016 reported that glyphosate is likely not carcinogenic. In May 2019, CNN reported that the agency had reaffirmed its position that, when used according to instructions, glyphosate is not carcinogenic. Noting company emails between Monsanto and EPA executives released in 2015 which appear to suggest that an EPA official offered to kill an agency glyphosate review, CNN cited \\"concerns about whether Monsanto has had undue influence over regulators.\\" International Agency for Research on Cancer In March 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an intergovernmental agency forming part of the World Health Organization of the United Nations, published a summary of their forthcoming monograph on glyphosate, and classified glyphosate as \\"probably carcinogenic in humans\\" (category 2A) based on epidemiological studies, animal studies, and in vitro studies. It noted that there was \\"limited evidence\\" of carcinogenicity in humans for non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The IARC classifies substances for their carcinogenic potential, and \\"a few positive findings can be enough to declare a hazard, even if there are negative studies, as well.\\" Unlike the BfR, it does not conduct a risk assessment, weighing benefits against risk. The BfR responded that IARC reviewed only a selection of what they had reviewed earlier, and argued that other studies, including a cohort study called Agricultural Health Study, do not support the classification. The IARC report did not include unpublished studies, including one completed by the IARC panel leader. The agency's international protocol dictates that only published studies be used in classifications of carcinogenicity, since national regulatory agencies including the EPA have allowed agrochemical corporations to conduct their own unpublished research, which may be biased in support of their profit motives. = Monsanto response and campaign = Monsanto called the IARC report biased and said it wanted the report to be retracted. In 2017, internal documents from Monsanto were made public by lawyers pursuing litigation against the company, who used the term \\"Monsanto papers\\" to describe the documents. This term was later used also by Leemon McHenry and others. The documents indicated Monsanto had planned a public relations effort to discredit the IARC report, and had engaged Henry Miller to write a 2015 opinion piece in Forbes Magazine challenging the report. Miller did not reveal the connection to Forbes, and according to the New York Times, when Monsanto asked him if he was interested in writing such an article, he replied \\"I would be if I could start from a high-quality draft\\" provided by the company. Once this became public, Forbes removed his blog from their site. Two journalists from Le Monde won the 2018 European Press Prize for a series of articles on the documents, also titled Monsanto Papers. Their reporting described, among other things, Monsanto's lawyers' letters demanding that IARC scientists turn over documents relating to Monograph 112, which contained the IARC finding that glyphosate was a \\"probable carcinogen\\"; several of the scientists condemned these letters as intimidating. = Reviews of the EFSA and IARC reports = A 2017 review done by personnel from EFSA and BfR argued that the differences between the IARC's and EFSA's conclusions regarding glyphosate and cancer were due to differences in their evaluation of the available evidence. The review concluded that \\"Two complementary exposure assessments ... suggests that actual exposure levels are below\\" the reference values identified by the EFSA \\"and do not represent a public concern.\\" In contrast, a 2016 analysis concluded that in the EFSA's Renewal Assessment Report, \\"almost no weight is given to studies from the published literature and there is an over-reliance on non-publicly available industry-provided studies using a limited set of assays that define the minimum data necessary for the marketing of a pesticide\\", arguing that the IARC's evaluation of probably carcinogenic to humans \\"accurately reflects the results of published scientific literature on glyphosate\\". In October 2017, an article in The Times revealed that Christopher Portier, a scientist advising the IARC in the assessment of glyphosate and advocate for its classification as possibly carcinogenic, had received consulting contracts with two law firm associations representing alleged glyphosate cancer victims that included a payment of US$160,000 to Portier. The IARC final report was also found to have changed compared to an interim report, through the removal of text saying certain studies had found glyphosate was not carcinogenic in that study's context, and through strengthening a conclusion of \\"limited evidence of animal carcinogenicity,\\" to \\"sufficient evidence of animal carcinogenicity\\". California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment In March 2015, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) announced plans to have glyphosate listed as a known carcinogen based on the IARC assessment. In 2016, Monsanto started a case against OEHHA and its acting director, Lauren Zeise, but lost the suit in March 2017. Glyphosate was listed as \\"known to the State of California to cause cancer\\" in 2017. In February 2018, as part of an ongoing case, an injunction was issued prohibiting California from enforcing carcinogenicity labeling requirements for glyphosate until the case was resolved. The injunction stated that arguments by California \\"[do] not change the fact that the overwhelming majority of agencies that that have examined glyphosate have determined it is not a cancer risk.\\". In August 2019, the EPA also said it no longer allow labels claiming glyphosate is a carcinogen, as those claims would \\"not meet the labeling requirements of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act\\" and misinform the public. European Chemicals Agency On March 15, 2017 the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) announced recommendations proceeding from a risk assessment of glyphosate performed by ECHA's Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC). Their recommendations maintained the current classification of glyphosate as a substance causing serious eye damage and as a substance toxic to aquatic life. However, the RAC did not find evidence implicating glyphosate to be a carcinogen, a mutagen, toxic to reproduction, nor toxic to specific organs. Effects of use =Emergence of resistant weeds= In the 1990s, no glyphosate-resistant weeds were known to exist. By 2014, glyphosate- resistant weeds dominated herbicide-resistance research. At that time, 23 glyphosate-resistant species were found in 18 countries. \\"Resistance evolves after a weed population has been subjected to intense selection pressure in the form of repeated use of a single herbicide.\\" According to Ian Heap, a weed specialist, who completed his PhD on resistance to multiple herbicides in annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum) in 1988 ‚Äì the first case of an herbicide- resistant weed in Australia ‚Äì by 2014 the Lolium rigidum was the \\"world‚Äôs worst herbicide-resistant weed with instances in \\"12 countries, 11 sites of action, 9 cropping regimens\\" and affecting over 2 million hectares. Annual ryegrass was known to be resistant to herbicides since 1982. The first documented case of glyphosate-resistant L. rigidum was reported in Australia in 1996 near Orange, New South Wales.Glyphosate Resistance in Crops and Weeds: History, Development, and Management. Editor, Vijay K. Nandula. John Wiley & Sons, 2010 In 2006, farmers associations were reporting 107 biotypes of weeds within 63 weed species with herbicide resistance. In 2009, Canada identified its first resistant weed, giant ragweed, and at that time 15 weed species had been confirmed as resistant to glyphosate. from link, select Glyphosate from dropdown As of 2010, in the United States of soil were afflicted by herbicide- resistant weeds, or about 5% of the 170 million acres planted with corn, soybeans, and cotton, the crops most affected, in 22 states. In 2012, Charles Benbrook reported that the Weed Science Society of America listed 22 herbicide-resistant in the U.S., with over infested by GR weeds and that Dow AgroSciences had carried out a survey and reported a figure of around . The International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds database lists species that are resistant to glyphosate. In response to resistant weeds, farmers are hand- weeding, using tractors to turn over soil between crops, and using other herbicides in addition to glyphosate. Monsanto scientists have found that some resistant weeds have as many as 160 extra copies of a gene called EPSPS, the enzyme glyphosate disrupts. Palmer amaranth Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri) In 2004, a glyphosate-resistant variation of Palmer amaranth was found in the U.S. state of Georgia and confirmed by a 2005 study. In 2005, resistance was also found in North Carolina. The species can quickly become resistant to multiple herbicides and has developed multiple mechanisms for glyphosate resistance due to selection pressure. The glyphosate-resistant weed variant is now widespread in the southeastern United States. Cases have also been reported in Texas and Virginia. Conyza species Horseweed (Conyza canadensis) Conyza bonariensis (also known as hairy fleabane and buva) and Conyza canadensis (known as horseweed or marestail) are other weed species that have lately developed glyphosate resistance. A 2008 study on the current situation of glyphosate resistance in South America concluded \\"resistance evolution followed intense glyphosate use\\" and the use of glyphosate-resistant soybean crops is a factor encouraging increases in glyphosate use. In the 2015 growing season, glyphosate-resistant marestail proved to be especially problematic to control in Nebraska production fields. Ryegrass Ryegrass (Lolium perenne) Glyphosate-resistant ryegrass (Lolium) has occurred in most of the Australian agricultural areas and other areas of the world. All cases of evolution of resistance to glyphosate in Australia were characterized by intensive use of the herbicide while no other effective weed control practices were used. Studies indicate the resistant ryegrass does not compete well against nonresistant plants and their numbers decrease when not grown under conditions of glyphosate application. Johnson grass Glyphosate-resistant Johnson grass (Sorghum halepense) has been found in Argentina as well as Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. =Monarch butterfly populations= Use of 2-4 D and other herbicides like glyphosate to clear milkweed along roads and fields may have contributed to a decline in monarch butterfly populations in the Midwestern United States. Along with deforestation and adverse weather conditions, the decrease in milkweed contributed to an 81% decline in monarchs. The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed a suit against the EPA in 2015, in which it argued that the agency ignored warnings about the potentially dangerous impacts of glyphosate usage on monarchs. Legal status Glyphosate was first approved for use in the 1970s, and as of 2010 was labelled for use in 130 countries. In 2017 Vandenberg et al. cited a 100-fold increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicides from 1974 to 2014, the possibility that herbicide mixtures likely have effects that are not predicted by studying glyphosate alone, and reliance of current safety assessments on studies done over 30 years ago. They recommended that current safety standards be updated, writing that the current standards \\"may fail to protect public health or the environment.\\" =European Union= In April 2014, the legislature of the Netherlands passed legislation prohibiting sale of glyphosate to individuals for use at home; commercial sales were not affected.Staff, Sustainable Pulse. Apr 4 2014 Dutch Parliament Bans Glyphosate Herbicides for Non-Commercial Use In June 2015, the French Ecology Minister asked nurseries and garden centers to halt over-the-counter sales of glyphosate in the form of Monsanto's Roundup. This was a nonbinding request and all sales of glyphosate remain legal in France until 2022, when it was planned to ban the substance for home gardening. However, more recently the French parliament decided to not to impose a definitive date for such a ban. French parliament does not vote for a date to terminate glyphosate: Rejet √† l‚ÄôAssembl√©e de l‚Äôinscription dans la loi de la date de sortie du glyphosate In January 2019, \\"the sale, distribution, and use of Roundup 360 [wa]s banned\\" in France. Exemptions for many farmers were later implemented, and a curb of its use by 80% for 2021 is projected. A vote on the relicensing of glyphosate in the EU stalled in March 2016. Member states France, Sweden, and the Netherlands objected to the renewal. A vote to reauthorize on a temporary basis failed in June 2016 but at the last-minute the license was extended for 18 months until the end of 2017. On 27 November 2017, a majority of eighteen EU member states voted in favor of permitting the use of herbicide glyphosate for five more years. A qualified majority of sixteen states representing 65% of EU citizens was required. 'EU votes for five more years usage of herbicide glyphosate'. NRC Handelsblad , 28 November 2017. The German Minister of Agriculture, Christian Schmidt, unexpectedly voted in favor while the German coalition government was internally divided on the issue which usually results in Germany abstaining.'Talks CDU-SPD under pressure because of herbicide' . NRC Handelsblad, 28 November 2017. In December 2018, attempts were made to reopen the decision to license the weed- killer. These were condemned by Conservative MEPs, who said the proposal was politically motivated and flew in the face of scientific evidence. In March 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ordered the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to release all carcinogenicity and toxicity pesticide industry studies on glyphosate to the general public.‚ÄòEuropean Court of Justice orders public release of industry glyphosate studies‚Äô, 7 March 2019. In March 2019, the Austrian state of Carinthia outlawed the private use of glyphosate in residential areas while the commercial application of the herbicide is still permitted for farmers. The use of glyphosate by public authorities and road maintenance crews was already halted a number of years prior to the current ban by local authorities.\\"K√§rnten verbietet ab 28.

Legal cases =Lawsuits claiming liability for cancer= In June 2018, Dewayne Johnson, a 46-year-old former California school groundskeeper who is dying of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, took Monsanto (which had been acquired by Bayer earlier that month) to trial in San Francisco County superior court, alleging that it has spent decades hiding the cancer-causing dangers of its Roundup herbicides. The judge ordered that jurors be allowed to consider both scientific evidence related to the cause of Johnson's cancer and allegations that Monsanto suppressed evidence of the risks, with possible punitive damages. In August 2018, the jury awarded Johnson US$289 million in damages. Monsanto said they would appeal, saying they were confident that glyphosate does not cause cancer when used appropriately. In November 2018, the award was reduced to $78 million on appeal. In August 2018, the potential for additional cases was estimated at up to 4,000. Bayer announced in April 2019 that over 13,000 lawsuits related to Roundup had been launched in the US. In March 2019, a man was awarded $80 million in a lawsuit claiming Roundup was a substantial factor in his cancer, resulting in Costco stores discontinuing sales. In July 2019, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria reduced the settlement to $26 million. Chhabria stated that a punitive award was appropriate because the evidence \\"easily supported a conclusion that Monsanto was more concerned with tamping down safety inquiries and manipulating public opinion than it was with ensuring its product is safe.\\" Chhabria stated that there is evidence is on both sides concerning whether glyphosate causes cancer and that the behavior of Monsanto showed \\"a lack of concern about the risk that its product might be carcinogenic.\\" On 13 May 2019 a jury in California ordered Bayer to pay a couple $2 billion in damages after finding that the company had failed to adequately inform consumers of the possible carcinogenicity of Roundup. On July 26, 2019, an Alameda County judge cut the settlement to $86.7 million, stating that the judgement by the jury exceeded legal precedent. Using litigation discovery emails it was later revealed that in 2015 when Monsanto was discussing papers they wanted to see published to counter the expected IARC glyphosate results they wrote in an email, \\"An option would be to add Greim and Kier or Kirkland to have their names on the publication, but we would be keeping the cost down by us doing the writing and they would just edit & sign their names so to speak. Recall that is how we handled Williams Kroes & Munro, 2000.\\" In June 2020 Bayer, which acquired Monsanto in 2018, agreed to a $10 billion settlement as a result of a number of class-action lawsuits alleging that Roundup had caused cancer. =Advertising controversies= The New York Times reported that in 1996, \\"Dennis C. Vacco, the Attorney General of New York, ordered the company Monsanto to pull ads that said Roundup was \\"safer than table salt\\" and \\"practically nontoxic\\" to mammals, birds and fish. The company withdrew the spots, but also said that the phrase in question was permissible under E.P.A. guidelines.\\" In 2001, French environmental and consumer rights campaigners brought a case against Monsanto for misleading the public about the environmental impact of its herbicide Roundup, on the basis that glyphosate, Roundup's main component, is classed as \\"dangerous for the environment\\" and \\"toxic for aquatic organisms\\" by the European Union. Monsanto's advertising for Roundup had presented it as biodegradable and as leaving the soil clean after use. In 2007, Monsanto was convicted of false advertising and was fined 15,000 euros. Monsanto's French distributor Scotts France was also fined 15,000 euros. Both defendants were ordered to pay damages of 5,000 euros to the Brittany Water and Rivers Association and 3,000 euros to the Consommation Logement Cadre de vie, one of the two main general consumer associations in France.\\"Monsanto fined in France for 'false' herbicide ads\\".

BBC News (October 15, 2009). In 2016, a lawsuit was filed against Quaker Oats in the Federal district courts of both New York and California after trace amounts of glyphosate were found in oatmeal. The lawsuit alleged that the claim of \\"100% natural\\" was false advertising. That same year General Mills dropped the label \\"Made with 100% Natural Whole Grain Oats\\" from their Nature Valley granola bars after a lawsuit was filed that claimed the oats contained trace amounts of glyphosate. =Trade dumping allegations= United States companies have cited trade issues with glyphosate being dumped into the western world market areas by Chinese companies and a formal dispute was filed in 2010.

On 22 July 1403, the day after the Battle of Shrewsbury, he was made a Knight of the Garter. In the summer of 1404, he rode into what is today Monmouthshire at the head of an English force. Warwick engaged Welsh forces at the Battle of Mynydd Cwmdu, near Tretower Castle a few miles northwest of Crickhowell, nearly capturing Owain Glyndwr himself, taking Owain's banner, and forcing the Welsh to flee. The Welsh were chased down the valley of the River Usk where they regrouped and turned the tables on the pursuing English force, attempting an ambush.

Soldier of the King In 1410, he was appointed a member of the royal council, and two years later he was fighting in command at Calais. Up to this time Warwick's career had been that of the typical knight-errant, but in 1413 he was Lord High Steward at the Prince's coronation as Henry V of England, and became a trusted counsellor to the king. The following year he helped put down the Lollard uprising, and then went to Normandy as Captain of Calais, and represented England at the coronation of Sigismund as King of Germany and the Council of Constance.John Ashdown-Hill, \\"Eleanor The Secret Queen\\", Page 24 The History Press, 2009 Warwick spent much of the next decade fighting the French in the Hundred Years' War. He took a prominent part in the campaigns of 1417‚Äì18. Then he joined the king before Rouen, and in October 1418 had charge of the negotiations with the dauphin Louis and with the duke of Burgundy. Next year he was again the chief English spokesman in the conference at Meulan, and afterwards was Henry's representative in arranging the Treaty of Troyes. He held high command at sieges of French towns between 1420 and 1422. In 1419, he was created Count of Aumale, as part of the King's policy of giving out Norman titles to his nobles. He was appointed Master of the Horse. Responsibilities Henry V's will gave Warwick the responsibility for the education of the infant Henry VI of England. This duty required him to travel back and forth between England and Normandy many times, and during these travels he acted as superintendent of the trial of Joan of Arc. In 1437, when the king's minority ended, the Royal Council deemed his duty complete. Despite his age (then 55), he loyally accepted an appointment as lieutenant of France and Normandy. Arriving in Normandy on 8 November, he ruled with vigour and remained in France for the remaining two years of his life. Marriages and children Warwick first married Elizabeth de Berkeley (c. 138628 December 1422), before 5 October 1397, the daughter of Thomas de Berkeley, 5th Baron Berkeley and Margaret de Lisle, 3rd Baroness de Lisle. Together they had 3 daughters: * Lady Margaret de Beauchamp (1404‚Äì1468), who married John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and whose great-great-grandson, John Dudley, was created Earl of Warwick and subsequently, Duke of Northumberland. * Lady Eleanor de Beauchamp, (1407‚Äì1467) who first married Thomas de Ros, 8th Baron de Ros, and then married Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset. * Lady Elizabeth de Beauchamp (1417‚Äì1480), who first married George Neville, 1st Baron Latimer, and then married Thomas VI Wake of Blisworth (1435‚Äì1476). Warwick then married Lady Isabel le Despenser (26 July 14001439), the daughter of Thomas le Despenser, 1st Earl of Gloucester and Constance of York. With Isabel, who was also the widow of his first cousin, Richard de Beauchamp, 1st Earl of Worcester, his children were: * Henry de Beauchamp (born March 1425), who succeeded his father as Earl of Warwick, and later became Duke of Warwick. * Lady Anne de Beauchamp (born September 1426), who succeeded as the 16th Countess of Warwick in her own right, after the death of her niece.

Most of his property was entailed, but with a portion of the rest the will established a substantial trust. After his debts were paid, the trust endowed the Collegiate Church of St Mary in Warwick, and called for the construction of a new chapel there. It also enlarged the endowment of the chantries at Elmley Castle and Guy's Cliffe, and gave a gift to Tewkesbury Abbey. Beauchamp died in Rouen, Normandy, two years later, on 30 April 1439. After the completion of the chapel, his body was in 1475 transferred there, where his magnificent gilt- bronze monumental effigy may still be seen.

Phase space was the original object of study in symplectic geometry. Symplectic geometry is a branch of differential geometry and differential topology that studies symplectic manifolds; that is, differentiable manifolds equipped with a closed, nondegenerate 2-form. Symplectic geometry has its origins in the Hamiltonian formulation of classical mechanics where the phase space of certain classical systems takes on the structure of a symplectic manifold. Introduction A symplectic geometry is defined on a smooth even-dimensional space that is a differentiable manifold. On this space is defined a geometric object, the symplectic form, that allows for the measurement of sizes of two- dimensional objects in the space. The symplectic form in symplectic geometry plays a role analogous to that of the metric tensor in Riemannian geometry. Where the metric tensor measures lengths and angles, the symplectic form measures oriented areas. Symplectic geometry arose from the study of classical mechanics and an example of a symplectic structure is the motion of an object in one dimension. To specify the trajectory of the object, one requires both the position q and the momentum p, which form a point (p,q) in the Euclidean plane ‚Ñù2. In this case, the symplectic form is :\\\\omega = dp \\\\wedge dq and is an area form that measures the area A of a region S in the plane through integration: :A = \\\\int_S \\\\omega. The area is important because as conservative dynamical systems evolve in time, this area is invariant. Higher dimensional symplectic geometries are defined analogously. A 2n-dimensional symplectic geometry is formed of pairs of directions : ((x_1,x_2), (x_3,x_4),\\\\ldots(x_{2n-1},x_{2n})) in a 2n-dimensional manifold along with a symplectic form :\\\\omega = dx_1 \\\\wedge dx_2 + dx_3 \\\\wedge dx_4 + \\\\cdots + dx_{2n-1} \\\\wedge dx_{2n}. This symplectic form yields the size of a 2n-dimensional region V in the space as the sum of the areas of the projections of V onto each of the planes formed by the pairs of directions :A = \\\\int_V \\\\omega = \\\\int_V dx_1 \\\\wedge dx_2 + \\\\int_V dx_3 \\\\wedge dx_4 + \\\\cdots + \\\\int_V dx_{2n-1} \\\\wedge dx_{2n}. Comparison with Riemannian geometry Symplectic geometry has a number of similarities with and differences from Riemannian geometry, which is the study of differentiable manifolds equipped with nondegenerate, symmetric 2-tensors (called metric tensors). Unlike in the Riemannian case, symplectic manifolds have no local invariants such as curvature. This is a consequence of Darboux's theorem which states that a neighborhood of any point of a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold is isomorphic to the standard symplectic structure on an open set of ‚Ñù2n. Another difference with Riemannian geometry is that not every differentiable manifold need admit a symplectic form; there are certain topological restrictions. For example, every symplectic manifold is even-dimensional and orientable. Additionally, if M is a closed symplectic manifold, then the 2nd de Rham cohomology group H2(M) is nontrivial; this implies, for example, that the only n-sphere that admits a symplectic form is the 2-sphere. A parallel that one can draw between the two subjects is the analogy between geodesics in Riemannian geometry and pseudoholomorphic curves in symplectic geometry: Geodesics are curves of shortest length (locally), while pseudoholomorphic curves are surfaces of minimal area. Both concepts play a fundamental role in their respective disciplines. Examples and structures Every K√§hler manifold is also a symplectic manifold. Well into the 1970s, symplectic experts were unsure whether any compact non-K√§hler symplectic manifolds existed, but since then many examples have been constructed (the first was due to William Thurston); in particular, Robert Gompf has shown that every finitely presented group occurs as the fundamental group of some symplectic 4-manifold, in marked contrast with the K√§hler case. Most symplectic manifolds, one can say, are not K√§hler; and so do not have an integrable complex structure compatible with the symplectic form. Mikhail Gromov, however, made the important observation that symplectic manifolds do admit an abundance of compatible almost complex structures, so that they satisfy all the axioms for a K√§hler manifold except the requirement that the transition maps be holomorphic. Gromov used the existence of almost complex structures on symplectic manifolds to develop a theory of pseudoholomorphic curves, which has led to a number of advancements in symplectic topology, including a class of symplectic invariants now known as Gromov‚ÄìWitten invariants. These invariants also play a key role in string theory. Name Symplectic geometry is also called symplectic topology although the latter is really a subfield concerned with important global questions in symplectic geometry. The term \\"symplectic\\", introduced by , is a calque of \\"complex\\"; previously, the \\"symplectic group\\" had been called the \\"line complex group\\". \\"Complex\\" comes from the Latin com-plexus, meaning \\"braided together\\" (co- + plexus), while symplectic comes from the corresponding Greek sym-plektikos (œÉœÖŒºœÄŒªŒµŒ∫œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ); in both cases the stem comes from the Indo-European root *plek-.The Symplectization of Science, Mark J.

As a youth, he learned to play the trumpet, and subsequently began to learn the trombone at age 16. He originally borrowed a trombone to join his friends' Dixieland jazz group, inspired by records of Jack Teagarden. He attended the Royal Swedish Academy of Music, where his teachers included Sven- Erik Eriksson. By age 18, he had obtained a professional position in the Royal Swedish Opera Orchestra. At age 20, he left his orchestral career behind to study to become a full-time soloist. He studied with John Iveson at the Royal College of Music (1979‚Äì1980) and with Ralph Sauer and Roger Bobo in Los Angeles (1983). =Professional career= In 1981, Lindberg won the Nordic Soloists' Biennale competition. His concert debut was in 1984 with the Trombone Concerto by Henri Tomasi. That same year, he signed a 3-CD recording contract with BIS Records. His first solo recording was \\"The Virtuoso Trombone\\". Lindberg has recorded over 60 albums, for BIS and several other labels. His musical collaborators in Sweden have included pianist Roland P√∂ntinen and composer Jan Sandstr√∂m. Lindberg is noted for his performances of contemporary music, as well as expanding the repertoire of concerti for trombone. In 2006, he estimated that over the prior 25 years, composers wrote 82 works for him. On September 7, 2017, Lindberg gave his 100th trombone concerto premiere. Lindberg was the soloist in the premiere of Sandstr√∂m's Motorbike Concerto. In addition to the Sandstr√∂m, his repertoire includes Luciano Berio's Sequenza V, Fredrik H√∂gberg's The Ballad of Kit Bones and Su ba do be. Lindberg began to compose in the 1990s at the encouragement of Sandstr√∂m. Lindberg's first-performed work was Arabenne for trombone and strings, recorded in 1997. Other compositions have included Mandrake in the Corner, Chick 'a' bone Checkout, from 2006 and written for Charles Vernon of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Kundraan (2008). In 2000, Lindberg made his conducting debut with the Northern Sinfonia in the UK. He has regularly conducted the Nordic Chamber Orchestra (chief conductor, 2005‚Äì2010) and the Swedish Wind Ensemble (2005‚Äì2012). He was principal conductor of the Arctic Philharmonic Orchestra, and was contracted to the orchestra until 2018. Since 2016, Lindberg is conductor and music director at the Israel Netanya Kibbutz Orchestra. In 2011 Lindberg and the Norrk√∂ping Symphony Orchestra initiated the Allan Pettersson Project, the purpose of which is to record and issue all of Pettersson‚Äôs symphonies on CD. =Personal life= Lindberg lives in Stockholm with his wife and four children.

The game takes place in the Dungeons & Dragons Forgotten Realms campaign setting and the region of Icewind Dale, and utilises the 2nd edition ruleset. The story follows a different set of events than those of R. A. Salvatore's The Icewind Dale Trilogy novels: in the game, an adventuring party becomes enlisted as a caravan guard while in Icewind Dale, in the wake of strange events, and eventually discover a plot that threatens the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale and beyond. Icewind Dale received positive reviews, being praised for its musical score and gameplay. It was a commercial success, with sales above 400,000 units worldwide by early 2001. An expansion, Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter, was released in 2001, and a sequel, Icewind Dale II, followed in 2002. A remake by Overhaul Games, entitled Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, was published for several platforms in 2014. Gameplay Icewind Dales gameplay operates on a similar basis to that of Baldur's Gate, in that it incorporates a modified version of the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition ruleset, with the rules' intricacies automatically computed; the game keeps track of statistics and controls dice rolling.Icewind Dale game manual. It uses a similar user interface though with cosmetic changes, and focuses mainly on combat, often against large groups of enemies, with dialogue driving the main story. The player is able to order a character(s) to engage in movement, dialogue, combat, or other actions such as pickpocketing within each game location. Combat has a real-time as opposed to a turn-based system, though with the option of pausing at any time so the player can give the party orders which are carried out when the game is resumed. Along with the same inventory system and paper-doll mechanics, the game's story is divided into chapters, with a journal system archiving quests and notable entries on specific story- related information from non-player characters. Players begin the game by creating an adventuring party of up to six characters, either by creating new characters or importing those from a previous game. Each new character created requires the player to provide them with their name, gender, race, class, and alignment, and then determine their ability scores and weapon proficiencies. The class of a character affects what alignments are available to them, what weapons and combat styles they can use, and how proficient they can be in them. Characters designated as thieves require the player to allocate points to the various thieving skills, and spellcasters need a few 1st level spells selected for their spellbook and then one memorised for use at the start of the game. Once a party is created, characters earn experience points in the game through completing quests and defeating enemies, and level up upon earning enough. Leveling up will automatically increase a character's hit points, grants spellcasters access to more spell slots including higher levels of magic, sometimes allows additional weapon proficiencies, and allows thieves to improve their thieving abilities. Plot In the town of Easthaven, a party of adventurers are met in the tavern by the town's leader, Hrothgar (voiced by Jim Cummings), who invites them to join him on an expedition to investigate the town of Kuldahar, after reports of strange happenings there. On the road to Kuldahar, the expedition is ambushed by frost giants, who cause an avalanche that blocks the path back to Easthaven. With only the adventurers surviving, they continue to Kuldahar and meet with Arundel (Jim Cummings), the village's archdruid, who explains that a mysterious evil force has been kidnapping villagers, causing abnormal weather patterns, provoking monsters, and reducing the magical warmth provided by the giant tree that towers over the village. Asking for their help to discover the source of the evil, the adventurers begin by searching the Vale of Shadows, an area containing Kuldahar's crypts, due to rumours of undead creature sightings. They encounter a cursed barbarian spirit named Kresselack (Tony Jay) who tells them that the threat lies elsewhere. Reporting this back to the druid, Arundel instructs the group to retrieve an ancient scrying item called the Heartstone Gem, so that he may discover the source of the evil more quickly. After finding the gem was stolen from its original resting place within a temple, the party travel to the caverns of Dragon's Eye, finding a number of the missing villagers being held there by lizard men. They eventually find the gem being used by a powerful Marilith named Yxunomei (Tara Strong). After killing Yxunomei and retrieving the gem, the party return to find Kuldahar under attack by Orogs, and Arundel mortally wounded by a shapeshifter disguised as the archdruid, who taunts them before vanishing. The true Arundel advises the party to take the Heartstone to Larrel (Michael Bell) at the fortress of the Severed Hand, the only one capable of using it now, before dying from his wounds. Arriving at the fortress, the party discover that Larrel is insane, and complete a task to help him regain his sanity. Using the gem, Larrel discovers the source of the evil to reside in the former dwarven city of Dorn's Deep. Fighting their way through the city, the group eventually come across the source of the evil ‚Äì a priest named Brother Poquelin (John Kassir). Poquelin reveals himself to be a demon who was exiled from his home realm by his superiors, and that both he and Yxunomei maintained a vendetta against each other that was getting out of control. Predicting she would follow him to the material plane, the demon sought a base of operation in the region to form a military force that could crush her. While doing so, he stumbled upon the ancient artifact Crenshinibon, which he claims had been \\"calling\\" to him. Poquelin immediately used its power to help him amass an army to conquer the lands of Icewind Dale, until Yxunomei's activities around Kuldahar led to the formation of Hrothgar's expedition. Seeking to stop it, the demon had his frost giant minions crush the expedition, but did not count on the adventurers' survival being a problem until they recovered the Heartstone Gem, forcing him to eliminate Arundel. Despite the party having found someone else to use it, Poquelin had managed to build up his forces, which he soon sent to Easthaven. After a brief battle with Poquelin, the party finds itself transported back to Easthaven, which is now in ruins. After freeing the surviving villagers, the local cleric of Tempus, Everard, informs the party that Poquelin is going after Jerrod's Stone, a mystical object housed under the town's temple, which acts as a seal on a portal to the Nine Hells of Baator. Originally opened during a major historic battle between the combined might of the barbarian tribes and an army of a powerful mage, it was sealed shut by the sacrifice of the shaman Jerrod who led the barbarians in the conflict. Gaining entry into the demon's crystal tower that enveloped the temple, the group discover that Poquelin's true intention was to reopen the portal contained within the Stone, allowing him to conquer the North with an army of demons at his command. Although he successfully achieves this, Everard, having shunned the tale of Jerrod's sacrifice until finally understanding what he did, throws himself into the portal and seals it off at the cost of his life. The party then fights Poquelin in his true form as the devil Belhifet, and manage to defeat him, banishing him to the Nine Hells and escaping the tower as it collapses. In time, Easthaven eventually recovers, and the town is reconstructed. In a twist ending, it is revealed that the game's narrator (David Ogden Stiers), was really Belhifet, who spent a mandatory century of imprisonment at the hands of the adventurers that is now close to end, and that he will soon walk the Prime Material once more to seek his revenge. (see Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear) Development Icewind Dale is based on the BioWare Infinity Engine, featuring pre-rendered backgrounds and sprite-based characters displayed with an isometric camera perspective. This engine was used to power Black Isle Studios' previous games Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate, and others. Release Icewind Dale was released on June 29, 2000 for Windows by Interplay Entertainment, and on March 26, 2002 for Mac OS and OS X by MacPlay. An expansion, Icewind Dale: Heart of Winter, was released in 2001. The game and its expansion were re-released in two budget packages in 2002, entitled Icewind Dale: The Collection and Icewind Dale: Complete. They were re-released again in 2002 alongside Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment in Black Isle Compilation. A collector's edition called Icewind Dale: The Ultimate Collection, which included the sequel Icewind Dale II and its expansion, was released in 2003. All four games were released again in Black Isle Compilation ‚Äì Part Two in 2004, in Ultimate Dungeons & Dragons in 2006, and in Atari's Rollenspiele: Deluxe Edition in 2007. Icewind Dale was again re-released on October 6, 2010, complete with expansion packs on GOG.com. Reception =Sales= In the United States, Icewind Dale debuted at #4 on PC Data's weekly computer game sales rankings for June 25‚ÄìJuly 1, 2000, following the title's release on the 30th. Domestic sales for the period totaled 39,285 copies, which drew revenues of $1.71 million. Mark Asher of CNET Gamecenter called this performance a \\"mild surprise\\" and noted that the game was \\"doing well\\". It was the country's 16th-best-selling computer title for the month of June. After retaining position 4 in its second week, it dropped to sixth place in its third week. James Fudge of Computer Games Magazine wrote that Icewind Dale was among the titles that \\"dominated the retail charts in the U.S. for the month of July.\\" The game remained in PC Data's weekly top 10 until the week ending August 5. Later that month, Interplay's Brian Fargo noted that Icewind Dale was \\"selling beyond our forecasts and in number one position[s] in certain European territories\\". It was the United States' sixth-highest computer game seller of July and 16th-highest of August, moving 21,923 units and earning $1.05 million during the latter month alone. According to Chart- Track, Icewind Dale was the United Kingdom's best-selling computer game for its debut week, breaking Diablo IIs three-week streak in the region. It dropped to third place the following week, before falling to seventh. Discussing Icewind Dales chart performance, a writer for PC Zone mentioned being \\"a little surprised at seeing Diablo II capitulate so easily, especially to Icewind Dale, despite the success of Baldur's Gate.\\" Icewind Dale was the United Kingdom's third-best-selling computer title in August, placing above Diablo II for the month. According to PC Gamer US, it also achieved \\"high sales\\" in Germany, where it debuted in 17th place on the computer game sales charts in July. After peaking at #5 the following month, it claimed places 16 and 29 in September and October before exiting Germany's top 30. By early 2001, Icewind Dale had sold more than 350,000 units worldwide, including 45,000 units in Germany. Sales rose above 400,000 units by April. In the United States alone, it sold 145,564 copies and earned $6.8 million by the end of 2000, according to PC Data. Its lifetime sales there climbed to 270,000 copies ($9.5 million) by 2006; as of that year, the Icewind Dale franchise together had sold 580,000 units in the region. In August 2006, Edge ranked the original Icewind Dale as the United States' 74th-best-selling computer game, and best-selling Icewind Dale title, released since January 2000. =Critical reviews= Icewind Dale was well received by critics, scoring 86% from GameRankings and 87/100 from Metacritic. GameSpot Greg Kasavin gave the game 8.6/10, opining it is \\"well suited for fans of Black Isle Studios' previous games, fans of classic hack-and-slash AD&D; computer games, and anyone looking for an action-packed role-playing game with a lot of depth.\\" IGN scored it 8.8/10 and GameZone gave it 9.5/10. According to GameSpy's Allen Rausch, \\"Icewind Dale was a fun dungeon romp that can hold its head up high, even if it can't match its big brothers.\\" The game's music score by Jeremy Soule received widespread critical acclaim. Chris Chan of the New Straits Times said the game was one of the best he ever played, and went on to positively compare it with Diablo II. The strongest criticism was that the gameplay was too uniform and was mostly combat-focused, with little interaction or investigation. Bob Low of the Daily Record noted technical issues such as poor pathfinding and occasional crashes. PC Zone criticized its similarities to previous Infinity Engine games. IGN ranked Icewind Dale No. 6 on their list of \\"The Top 11 Dungeons & Dragons Games of All Time\\" in 2014. Ian Williams of Paste rated the game #3 on his list of \\"The 10 Greatest Dungeons and Dragons Videogames\\" in 2015. Computer Gaming World, GameSpot, The Electric Playground and CNET Gamecenter nominated Icewind Dale as the top computer role-playing game of 2000, but it lost all four awards to Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn. The former publication's editors wrote that Icewind Dale \\"hearkened back to the old days\\" and was \\"dangerously close to being the most purely fun RPG that we've played in a long time.\\" Kevin Rice reviewed the PC version of the game for Next Generation, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"A huge, engrossing game with the most action in the Forgotten Realms series, Icewind Dale earns its place on the hard drive of any self-respecting RPG fan.\\" Remake A remake of Icewind Dale was developed by Beamdog's Overhaul Games and published by Atari for Windows, OS X, Linux, Android, and iOS in 2014.

Accessed 21 November 2018.) was an English nobleman. He was the son of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick, and Isabel le Despenser. In 1434, Henry married Cecily Neville, the eldest daughter of Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, and Alice Montagu, Countess of Salisbury. He became 14th Earl of Warwick on his father's death in 1439. His boyhood friendship with King Henry VI and his father's military services placed him high in the King's favour, and he was loaded with titles. In 1444, he was made premier Earl of the realm, and on 14 April 1445, was created Duke of Warwick, and around the same time, granted the Forest of Feckenham. See p169 As Duke of Warwick, he was preceded only by the Duke of Norfolk. This precedence was disputed by the Duke of Buckingham, whom it displaced. However, the issue was rendered moot by his death in June, at which time the dukedom expired for lack of heirs-male. He is said to have been crowned King of the Isle of Wight in 1444William Camden, Britain, or, a Chorographicall Description of the most flourishing Kingdomes, England, Scotland, and Ireland (London, 1610) by Henry VI, to place his playmate on a more equal standing with him, but this story is considered unhistorical.Dictionary of National Biography (New York: Macmillan, 1985) vol. 4, p. 28 On his death, the earldom was inherited by his two-year-old daughter, Anne (14433 June 1449Hicks, Michael (1998).

In the end, his full sister Anne (who was married to Richard Neville, eldest son of Richard Neville, Earl of Salisbury, and brother to Beauchamp's widow) was declared the heir, due to the English common law principle that \\"possession by the brother makes the sister the heir\\", which denies relatives of the half-blood from inheriting when full-blood relatives are available to inherit. The three half-sisters from their father's first marriage contested this decision, but to no avail.

The executive order led to the end of segregation in the services during the Korean War (1950‚Äì1953). Before Executive Order 9981 The Chicago Defender announces Executive Order 9981. Black Americans in the military worked under different rules that delayed their entry into combat. They had to wait four years before they could begin combat training while a white American would begin training within months of being qualified. The Air Corps was deliberately delaying the training of African Americans even though it needed more manpower (Survey and Recommendations). The Women's Army Corps (WAC) reenlistment program was open to black women, but overseas assignments were not. In a 1945 survey conducted among 250 white officers and sergeants who had a colored platoon assigned to their company the following results were found: 77% of both officers and sergeants said they had become more favorable towards black soldiers after having a black platoon assigned to their company (no cases were found where someone said their attitude towards them had turned less favorable), 84% of officers and 81% of sergeants thought the black soldiers had performed very well in combat, only 5% of officers and 4% of sergeants thought that black infantry soldiers were not as good as white infantry soldiers, and 73% of officers and 60% of sergeants thought that black soldiers and white soldiers got along together very well. According to this particular survey there are no reasonable grounds for racial segregation in the armed forces.  Attempts to end discrimination  In 1947, civil rights activist A. Philip Randolph, along with colleague Grant Reynolds, renewed efforts to end discrimination in the military, forming the Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service and Training, later renamed the League for Non- Violent Civil Disobedience Against Military Segregation.Susan M. Glisson, The Human Tradition in the Civil Rights Movement (Rowman & Littlefield, 2006), 91 Truman's Order expanded on Executive Order 8802 by establishing equality of treatment and opportunity in the military for people of all races, religions, or national origins. The order: > It is hereby declared to be the policy of the President that there shall be > equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the armed services > without regard to race, color, religion or national origin. This policy > shall be put into effect as rapidly as possible, having due regard to the > time required to effectuate any necessary changes without impairing > efficiency or morale. The order also established a committee to investigate and make recommendations to the civilian leadership of the military to implement the policy. The order eliminated Montford Point as a segregated Marine boot camp. It became a satellite facility of Camp Lejeune. Most of the actual enforcement of the order was accomplished by President Dwight D. Eisenhower's administration (1953‚Äì1961), including the desegregation of military schools, hospitals, and bases. The last of the all-black units in the United States military was abolished in September 1954. Kenneth Claiborne Royall, Secretary of the Army since 1947, was forced into retirement in April 1949 for continuing to refuse to desegregate the army nearly a year after President Truman's Order.Robert B. Edgerton, Hidden Heroism: Black Soldiers in America's Wars, (Barnes & Noble 2009), 165 Fifteen years after Truman's order, on July 26, 1963, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara issued Directive 5120.36 encouraging military commanders to employ their financial resources against facilities used by soldiers or their families that discriminated based upon sex or race. In contravention to Truman's executive order, the United States complied with a non-public request from the Icelandic government not to station black soldiers on the US base in Keflav√≠k, Iceland. The United States complied with the Icelandic request until the 1970s and 1980s when black soldiers began to be stationed in Iceland. References Further reading * Alan L.

His works often involve intertwining narratives and take a surreal multidisciplinary approach to sound, theatrics and writing, and have been continuously performed by various interpreters during and after his life, including Automatic Writing (1979) and Perfect Lives (1984). Life and career Ashley was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan. He studied at the University of Michigan with Ross Lee Finney. Later, he studied at the Manhattan School of Music, and then became a musician in the US Army. After moving back to Michigan, Ashley worked at the University of Michigan's Speech Research Laboratories. Although he was not officially a student in the acoustic research program there, he was offered the chance to obtain a doctorate, but turned it down to pursue his music. From 1961 to 1969, he organised the ONCE Festival in Ann Arbor with Roger Reynolds, Gordon Mumma, and other local composers and artists. He was a co-founder of the ONCE Group, as well as a member of the Sonic Arts Union, which also included David Behrman, Alvin Lucier, and Gordon Mumma. In 1969 he became director of the San Francisco Tape Music Center. In the 1970s he directed the Mills College Center for Contemporary Music. His notable students include Maggi Payne. The majority of Ashley's recordings have been released by Lovely Music, which was founded by Performing Artservices, the not-for-profit management organization which represents Ashley and other artists. Since he first came to prominence, Ashley was indelibly linked to the performance of his pieces, particularly through the use of his voice in such works as Automatic Writing and Perfect Lives. Starting in the 1980s, he formed a band that lasted for decades consisting of himself, Sam Ashley, Joan LaBarbara, Thomas Buckner, and Jacqueline Humbert as vocalists and Tom Hamilton on electronics. Ashley also collaborated with various artists in terms of reading text. He was featured, alongside Kunga Rinpoche, on Eliane Radigue's 1987 piece Mila's Journey Inspired by a Dream. On December 9, 1992, Ashley publicly read William Gibson's electronic poem Agrippa (A Book of the Dead), on its premiere at The Kitchen in Chelsea, Manhattan. His reading, known as \\"The Transmission\\", was recorded and simultaneously transmitted to several other cities only once. In the final years of his life, Ashley‚Äôs work was newly taken up by other performers. Notable interpreters of Ashley's work have included the electronic duo Matmos, who‚Äôve repeatedly performed their arrangements of episodes from Perfect Lives, Object Collection, who premiered a stage version of Automatic Writing in 2011, Varispeed (band), who‚Äôve presented various site-specific, day-long arrangements of Perfect Lives since 2011, Trystero (band), who perform Perfect Lives in their memorized marathon arrangement\\", and Alex Waterman, who spearheaded a new Spanish-language version of Perfect Lives entitled Vidas Perfectas, performing the piece around the world and producing a new video realization as well. In 2002 he received the Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award. In 2011, Ashley‚Äôs 1967 opera That Morning Thing was restaged as part of the Performa Biennial with direction from Fast Forward. In 2014, shortly after his death, the Whitney Biennial presented three of Ashley's operas - Vidas Perfectas, The Trial..., both directed by Alex Waterman, and Crash, the opera he finished only three months before he died. \\"Crash\\" was remounted a year later at Roulette with the same cast: Gelsey Bell, Brian McCorkle, Paul Pinto, Dave Ruder, and Aliza Simons from the music collective Varispeed, as well as Amirtha Kidambi, with projected photos by Philip Makanna. He had one son, Sam, from his first marriage to Mary Tsaltas. In 1979, he married his second wife, Mimi Johnson.

It served as the venue for semiweekly multimedia performances from 1957 to 1964; its creators asked Gordon Mumma and Ashley to produce live electronic music for the productions. The performances included music produced by things such as the \\"rubbing together of stones\\" and steel rings thrown along wires. During their cooperation in Space Theater, Ashley created the Cooperative Studio for Electronic Music in 1958 with Mumma, whom he had originally met in his graduate composition seminars. The studio consisted of little more than spare rooms in each of their houses, where they kept their equipment. Ashley and Mumma were \\"serious tinkers in electronics,\\" working before synthesizers and electronic musical instruments were commercially available. They invented and built much of their own equipment with materials from Radio Shack. They were two of the earliest composers to work in live generation of music with amplified small sounds. The success of Space Theater led to the creation of the ONCE festival, a contemporary performing arts event that served as a forum for experimental art and music. Ashley was the director. Other musician participants included Roger Reynolds, George Cacioppo, Bruce Wise, and Donald Scarvada. Other collaborating artists were Harold Borkin and Joseph Wehrer, architects; George Manupelli, filmmaker; and Mary Ashley and Milton Cohen, painter-sculptors. There were six ONCE festivals between 1961 and 1965. They were considered \\"far-out\\" and controversial, and experienced both support and antagonism from the surrounding community in Ann Arbor. The festivals invited European and jazz composers to participate, and were a major influence on contemporary music of the time. Trilogy: Atalanta, Perfect Lives, and Now Eleanor's Idea The operas of Perfect Lives, Atalanta, and Now Eleanor's Idea comprise a trilogy that maintains a pulse of 72 beats per minute throughout (except for the opera Foreign Experiences within the Now Eleanor's Idea tetralogy, which is set to a quarter note=90). The third episode of Perfect Lives (\\"The Bank\\") contains the focal event of this trilogy. The event itself is hard to describe; after a variety of strange events transpire at the bank, i.e. a fight between dogs that speak Spanish and a bucket of water strategically thrown on the bank manager, it is realized that the bank \\"has no money in the bank,\\" a consequence of the art/crime action taken by the elopers Gwyn and Ed. In describing these curious events, Ashley introduces all of the bank tellers (\\"Introducing Susie. Susie works at the bank. That's her job. Mostly she helps people count their money. She likes it.\\"), who each have visions, each representing one of the trilogy's operas.Perfect Lives libretto, pg 160 Kate sees the security camera footage from the bank, which contains elements of Episodes 2 through 4 of Perfect Lives.

Linda, Susie, and Jennifer see visions of the three suitors of Atalanta, Willard Reynolds, Bud Powell, and Max Ernst, who have accidentally appeared in a spaceship at the moment of the bank incident. Eleanor's vision is conceptually of the four operas that bear her name, although Linda's vision introduces its four characters (Linda, Eleanor, Don, and Junior Jr.) as a foursome. The first section of the opera \\"Now Eleanor's Idea\\", entitled Improvement, features a retelling of these events. =Now Eleanor's Idea tetralogy= Now Eleanor's Idea is an opera tetralogy, part of the larger trilogy described above, based on the idea of heading westward in America, eventually arriving at the Pacific Ocean.Foreign Experiences liner notes Each opera is centered around one of the characters briefly introduced in Episode 3 of Perfect Lives. According to Kyle Gann, the order of the tetrology is (1) Improvement (representing Linda, one of the bank tellers), (2) el/Aficionado (representing Don Jr, i.e. \\"D, the Captain of the Football Team\\"), (3) Foreign Experiences (representing Junior Jr., Don and Linda's Son), and (4) Now Eleanor's Idea (representing Now Eleanor (another teller). According to Gann, the overall four-part structure of the cycle mirrors the four-movement symphonic form. These works are subtle in their narrative links to one another. The flow from Perfect Lives leads to Now Eleanor's Idea (the opera, not the tetralogy), focusing on Eleanor and her journey from Midwestern-small- town bank teller to television news reporter to prophet for the Southwestern Hispanic low rider car culture. Don's story is chronicled in Foreign Experiences. Don has moved to California with his family and becomes a professor. Unsatisfied with his existence, Don embarks on a mystical quest. Improvement (Don Leaves Linda) focuses on Linda‚Äîhere a metaphor for the Jews forced out of Spain in 1492‚Äîwho is abandoned by her husband Don at a highway rest stop. Linda meets many characters in her travels, including a tap dancer who is a stand-in for Giordano Bruno, and settles into a cosmopolitan existence with her son, Junior Jr. In a dream that echoes the uncertain journey of his father, Junior, Jr.'s opera, el/Aficionado, is a post-mortem on a mysteriously botched exercise in espionage. Ashley says that each of these scenarios is in reality the simultaneous dream of the protagonist, happening at the focal moment of Perfect Lives.Perfect Lives libretto, pg. 178 Ashley, along with Sam Ashley, Thomas Buckner, Jacqueline Humbert, and Joan LaBarbara, performed the complete tetralogy in 1994 in Avignon and at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Recordings of the operas have been released gradually, first with Improvement in 1992, followed by el/Aficionado in 1994, Foreign Experiences in 2006, and Now Eleanor's Idea in 2007. =Additional allegory= Ashley has ascribed various meanings to the individual elements of the trilogy. One layer of meaning is the journey, presumably of European- Americans, westward across America. Atalanta represents those in the new world who are acutely aware of their tradition in the old world. This is represented in the lengthy stories on great figures of the past (the \\"Anecdotes\\", etc.). Perfect Lives represents life in the Midwest, which Ashley was interested in \\"because it was flat\\".Perfect Lives libretto, pg 187 The stories have gotten shorter and are now just quaint colloquialisms and idioms (think of the string of phrases punctuated by \\"AND\\" in Episode 4). Now Eleanor's Idea is about the journey beyond the familiar to the West Coast, presumably the end of the world, i.e. a certain civilization was established when European adventurers found themselves in California and figured they would likely never make it home. Rather than anecdotes and sayings, the story telling unit in these operas is much smaller, and hence the language is more abstract.Perfect Lives libretto, pg 152-3 Ashley says in the liner notes to Atalanta that the three works represent \\"architecture, agriculture, and genealogy\\", respectively. Ashley has also described the Now Eleanor's Idea tetralogy as cataloging four American varieties of religion: Judaism in Improvement, Pentecostal Evangelism in Foreign Experiences, \\"corporate mysticism\\" in el/Aficionado, and Roman Catholicism as derived from Spain in Now Eleanor's Idea.http://www.lovely.com, Foreign Experiences entry  Automatic Writing  \\"Automatic Writing\\" is a piece that took five years to complete and was released by Lovely Music Ltd. in 1979. Ashley used his own involuntary speech that results from what he says is his Tourette syndrome as one of the voices in the music. This was considered a very different way of composing and producing music. Ashley stated that he wondered since Tourette's had to do with \\"sound-making and because the manifestation of the syndrome seemed so much like a primitive form of composing whether the syndrome was connected in some way to his obvious tendencies as a composer\\". Ashley was intrigued by his involuntary speech, and the idea of composing music that was unconscious. Seeing that the speech that resulted from having Tourette's could not be controlled, it was a different aspect from producing music that is deliberate and conscious, and music that is performed is considered \\"doubly deliberate\\" according to Ashley. Although there seemed to be a connection between the involuntary speech, and music, the connection was different due to it being unconscious versus conscious. Ashley's first attempts at recording his involuntary speech were not successful, because he found that he ended up performing the speech instead of it being natural and unconscious. \\"The performances were largely imitations of involuntary speech with only a few moments here and there of loss control\\". However, he was later able to set up a recording studio at Mills College one summer when the campus was mostly deserted, and record 48 minutes of involuntary speech. This was the first of four \\"characters\\" that Ashley had envisioned of telling a story in what he viewed as an opera. The other three characters were a French voice translation of the speech, Moog synthesizer articulations, and background organ harmonies. \\"The piece was Ashley's first extended attempt to find a new form of musical storytelling using the English language. It was opera in the Robert Ashley way\\". =Use of electronics= In the dialogue for Automatic Writing, the words themselves were not necessarily the primary source of meaning‚Äîespecially not after the kind of audio manipulation Ashley used to modify them. Some of the dialogue became totally incomprehensible. Ashley appreciated the use of voice and words for more than their explicit denotation, believing their rhythm and inflection could convey meaning without being able to understand the actual phonemes. Ashley engineered the first version of the piece using live electronics and reactive computer circuitry. He recorded his vocal part himself, with the mic barely an inch from his mouth and the recording level just shy of feedback. He then added \\"subtle and eerie modulations\\" to the recording, modifying his voice to the point that much of what he read could not be understood. The piece included four vocal parts that changed over the life of the piece, but in the final recording, the pieces included Ashley's monologue, a synthesized version, a French translation of the monologue, and a part produced by a Polymoog synthesizer.  The Immortality Songs  While still completing his \\"grand trilogy\\" of Perfect Lives, Atalanta, and Now Eleanor's Idea, in 1987 Ashley commenced work on The Immortality Songs, a series that would occupy him for the rest of his life ‚Äì and a project that he undertook aware that he \\"might not live to finish\\" it. Following his continual interest in forms of speech, the immortality songs are all invested in ranting as a form of uncontrolled speech. Ashley commenced this series by writing a list of forty nine titles for projects (not only operas), the rhythm of the title often influencing the rhythm of the subsequent project or opera (most especially within Your Money My Life Goodbye [1998]) Several of these projects include: Yellow Man with Heart with wings (opera, originally from 1979, remixed in 1990 to become the first of The Immortality Songs), Regards to Natalie Wood (Poem, 1990), Outcome Inevitable (Orchestral, 1991), Love is a good example (Lecture to be sung, 1991), When Famous Last Words Fail You (Lecture to be sung, 1997), Dust (Opera, 1998), Your Money My Life Goodbye (Opera, 1998)Yes, but is it edible? (Lecture to be sung, 1999), Celestial Excursions (opera, 2003), Practical Anarchism (Lecture to be sung, 2003), Hidden Similarities (Adapted from a section of Concrete, opera, 2005), and Concrete (opera, 2006). The sections of Concrete itself contain some of the titles from his list. Films *1976 - Music With Roots in the Aether: Opera for Television. Tape 7: Robert Ashley.

In 1998, she was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Computer Game Developers Association. In 2007, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences chose Bunten as the 10th inductee into its Hall of Fame.  Early life  Bunten was born in St. Louis, Missouri and moved to Little Rock, Arkansas as a junior in high school. She was the oldest of six siblings. While growing up in Little Rock, Bunten's family didn't always have enough money to make ends meet, so Bunten took a job at a pharmacy. She also held a leadership role with the Boy Scouts. According to Bunten, one of her fondest childhood memories involved playing games with her family. She was quoted saying, ‚ÄúWhen I was a kid, the only times my family spent together that weren‚Äôt totally dysfunctional were when we were playing games. Consequently, I believe games are a wonderful way to socialize.‚Äù While attending the University of Arkansas, she opened up her own bike shop called Highroller Cyclerie. Bunten acquired a degree in industrial engineering in 1974 and started programming text-based video games as a hobby. After she graduated from college, she was employed by the National Science Foundation, where she created urban models before starting a job at a video game company.  Career  In 1978, Bunten sold a real-time auction game for the Apple II titled Wheeler Dealers to a Canadian software company, Speakeasy Software. This early multiplayer game required a custom controller, raising its price to USD$35 in an era of $15 games sold in plastic bags. It sold only 50 copies.Interview with Berry from Halcyon Days After producing three titles for SSI, Bunten, who by then had founded a software company called Ozark Softscape, caught the attention of Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins. M.U.L.E. was Bunten's first game for EA, originally published for the Atari 8-bit family because the Atari 800 had four controller ports. Bunten later ported it to the Commodore 64. While its sales - 30,000 units - were not high, the game developed a cult following and was widely pirated. The game setting was inspired by the novel Time Enough for Love by Robert A. Heinlein. Along with the success of M.U.L.E., Berry also had close ties with the games Robot Rascals, Heart of Africa, and Cartels & Cutthroat$. Throughout her career, she was involved in the creation of 12 games, 10 of which revolved around multiplayer compatibility. The only two which didn't have a multiplayer focus were Seven Cities of Gold and Heart of Africa. Bunten wanted to follow up M.U.L.E. with a game that would have been similar to the later game Civilization, but after fellow Ozark Softscape partners balked at the idea, Bunten followed with The Seven Cities of Gold, which proved popular because of its simplicity. By the time the continent data were stored in the computer's memory, there was little left for fancy graphics or complex gameplay - the game had only five resources. It was a hit, selling more than 150,000 copies. The follow-up game, Heart of Africa, appeared in 1985 and was followed by Robot Rascals, a combination computer/card game that had no single-player mode and sold only 9,000 copies, and 1988's Modem Wars, one of the early games played by two players over a dial-up modem. Modem Wars was ahead of its time, as few people in the late 1980s had modems in their homes. Bunten departed EA for MicroProse. Allegedly, Trip Hawkins, CEO of EA, did not feel that pushing production of games onto a cartridge based system was a good idea. The shift was important to Bunten, as computer games had previously been distributed on floppy discs, and a changeover to a cartridge system would allow games to be played on Nintendo systems. This was a significant factor in her decision to leave. She then developed a computer version of the board game Axis and Allies, which became 1990's Command HQ, a modem/network grand strategy wargame. Bunten's second and last game for MicroProse was 1992's Global Conquest, a 4-player network/modem war game. It was the first 4-player network game from a major publisher. Bunten was a strong advocate of multi-player online games, observing that, \\"No one ever said on their deathbed, 'Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone with my computer.'\\" by Danielle Bunten Berry. Originally from Berry's personal site, archived by Anticlockwise.com A port of M.U.L.E. to the Mega Drive/Genesis was cancelled after Bunten refused to put guns and bombs in the game, feeling it would alter the game too much from its original concept.\\"In Memoriam: Danielle Berry\\" by Ernest Adams from Gamasutra.com In 1997, Bunten shifted focus to multiplayer games over the Internet with Warsport, a remake of Modem Wars that debuted on the MPlayer.com game network. Less than a year after the release of Warsport, Bunten was diagnosed with lung cancer presumably related to years of heavy smoking.\\"The tragic genius of M.U.L.E.\\" from Salon.com She died on July 3, 1998. At the time, she was working on the design of an Internet version of M.U.L.E..  M.U.L.E  The game's primary premise consisted of players playing with and against one another to establish total control over a planet. The name of the game stands for Multiple Use Labor Element. The game was originally made for the Atari 400 and Atari 800 but was later developed to be compatible with the Commodore 64, NES, and IBM pcjr. The game has a maximum of four players. Players are given different options and choices, and are allowed to create their colony the way they see fit. This can be done by changing races and giving respective colonies different advantages that will impact the way the game is played and determined later on down the line. Ultimately there are two ways in which players can win the game. The first way is by having the most amount of money out of all four players, and the second way is by being able to survive the colony itself. The game focuses heavily on going out and retrieving resources that can be used to benefit their character. Items such as food, energy, and crystite are some of a number of in-game items that players are able to retrieve and use to better themselves. In order for a player to be able to access these items, they will first have to have access to a M.U.L.E. The acquisition of these items has a direct reflection on what the player will be allowed to do. For example, if a player doesn't have enough food, they will have less time during their turn.  The Seven Cities of Gold  The Seven Cities of Gold was originally intended to be another multiplayer game. It was originally a single player format, focused heavily on having the players travel around the map and collect items to help them strengthen their colony. Once they felt as though they had a solid colony, the players could battle each other to see who could overtake who. After much consideration, Ozark Software came to the conclusion that this would not be doable. Instead, they went with a formula that had the game focus solely on developing a colony.  Ozark Softscape  Ozark Softscape was a computer game development team consisting initially of Danielle Bunten, her brother Bill Bunten, Jim Rushing, and Alan Watson. Ozark was run out of Bunten's basement. The company was based out of Little Rock, Arkansas and had profound success with a few of their early titles. Ozark Softscape had a publishing deal with Electronic Arts for several of its groundbreaking games. In the early 1990s, Ozark Softscape left its partnership with Electronic Arts over a dispute to port some games to cartridge format for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It began a partnership with MicroProse to produce two more titles: Command HQ and Global Conquest. A dispute occurred over creating a follow-up to M.U.L.E. with Sega in 1993, and the company dissolved. The employees of Ozark Softscape moved to different areas of the software industry.  Personal life  Bunten was married three times. Bunten had three children, one daughter and two sons. After a third divorce, Bunten, who had until then been living as male, transitioned to living as a woman. Bunten underwent sex reassignment surgery in November 1992 and afterward kept a lower profile in the games industry. Bunten later regretted having surgery, finding that for her, the drawbacks of surgical transition outweighed the benefits, and wishing she had considered alternative approaches. by Danielle Bunten Berry from Anticlockwise.com She joked that the surgery was to improve the video game industry's male/female ratio and aesthetics, but advised others considering a sex change not to proceed unless there was no alternative and warned them of the cost, saying \\"Being my 'real self' could have included having a penis and including more femininity in whatever forms made sense. I didn't know that until too late and now I have to make the best of the life I've stumbled into. I just wish I would have tried more options before I jumped off the precipice.\\" After her gender change in fall 1992, Bunten stayed out of the video game spotlight, mostly keeping to herself. She felt as though that after becoming a woman she wasn't as good at video game development as she had previously been, stating ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm a little more than three years into my new life role as Ms. Danielle Berry, and her career looks to be somewhat different from old Mr. Dan Bunten‚Äôs. For one thing, I‚Äôm not as good a programmer as he was.\\" On July 3, 1998, Berry died of lung cancer.

On May 7, 1998, less than two months before her death, Berry was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Computer Game Developers Association. In 2000, Will Wright dedicated his blockbuster hit The Sims to Bunten's memory. In 2007, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences chose Bunten to be inducted into its Hall of Fame. Sid Meier, the mastermind behind the video game series Civilization, inducted her at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas. Bunten was a true pioneer for the video game industry, especially its multiplayer aspect of it. She is regarded by many as one of the best designers to ever grace the video game industry. Her success has even led people to make the claim that the work she did with games like M.U.L.E and Seven Cities of Gold was the inspiration behind highly successful modern multiplayer games like World of Warcraft. Bunten was known as someone who was very easy to talk to. If someone recognized her in public, she would be more than delighted to have a conversation with them.

In mathematical physics, where symmetry is of central importance, these operations are mostly called antisymmetric operations, and are extended in an associative setting to cover more than two arguments. Swapping the position of two arguments of an antisymmetric operation yields a result, which is the inverse of the result with unswapped arguments. The notion inverse refers to a group structure on the operation's codomain, possibly with another operation, such as addition. Subtraction is an anticommutative operation because -(a - b) = b - a. For example, 2 - 10 = -(10 - 2) = -8. A prominent example of an anticommutative operation is the Lie bracket.  Definition  If A, B are two abelian groups, a bilinear map f : A^2 \\\\to B is anticommutative if for all x, y \\\\in A we have :f(x, y) = - f(y, x). More generally, a multilinear map g : A^n \\\\to B is anticommutative if for all x_1, \\\\dots x_n \\\\in A we have :g(x_1,x_2, \\\\dots x_n) = \\\\text{sgn}(\\\\sigma) g(x_{\\\\sigma(1)},x_{\\\\sigma(2)},\\\\dots x_{\\\\sigma(n)}) where \\\\text{sgn}(\\\\sigma) is the sign of the permutation \\\\sigma.  Properties  If the abelian group B has no 2-torsion, implying that if x = -x then x = 0, then any anticommutative bilinear map f : A^2 \\\\to B satisfies :f(x, x) = 0. More generally, by transposing two elements, any anticommutative multilinear map g : A^n \\\\to B satisfies :g(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots x_n) = 0 if any of the x_i are equal; such a map is said to be alternating. Conversely, using multilinearity, any alternating map is anticommutative. In the binary case this works as follows: if f : A^2 \\\\to B is alternating then by bilinearity we have :f(x+y, x+y) = f(x, x) + f(x, y) + f(y, x) + f(y, y) = f(x, y) + f(y, x) = 0 and the proof in the multilinear case is the same but in only two of the inputs.

By contrast, for operations with the associative property, any order of evaluation gives the same result (parentheses in a multiple product are not needed). The identity is named after the German mathematician Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi. The cross product a\\\\times b and the Lie bracket operation [a,b] both satisfy the Jacobi identity. In analytical mechanics, the Jacobi identity is satisfied by the Poisson brackets. In quantum mechanics, it is satisfied by operator commutators on a Hilbert space and, equivalently, in the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics by the Moyal bracket.  Definition  Consider a set A with two binary operations + and √ó , with an additive identity 0. This satisfies the Jacobi identity if: :x \\\\times (y \\\\times z) \\\\ +\\\\ z \\\\times (x \\\\times y) \\\\ +\\\\ y \\\\times (z \\\\times x)\\\\ =\\\\ 0 \\\\quad \\\\forall\\\\ {x,y,z}\\\\in A. The left side is the sum of all even permutations of : that is, we leave the parentheses fixed and interchange letters an even number of times. Commutator bracket form The simplest example of a Lie algebra is constructed from the (associative) ring of n\\\\times n matrices, which may be thought of as infinitesimal motions of an n-dimensional vector space. The √ó operation is the commutator, which measures the failure of commutativity in matrix multiplication; instead of X\\\\times Y, one uses the Lie bracket notation: :[X,Y]=XY-YX. In this notation, the Jacobi identity is: This is easily checked by a computation. More generally, suppose A is an associative algebra and V is a subspace of A which is closed under the bracket operation: [X,Y]=XY-YX belongs to V for all X,Y\\\\in V. Then the Jacobi identity continues to hold on V. Example 3.3 Thus, if a binary operation [X,Y] satisfies the Jacobi identity, we may say that it behaves as if it were given by XY-YX in some associative algebra, even if it is not actually defined that way. Using the antisymmetry property [X,Y]=-[Y,X], the Jacobi identity can be rewritten as a modification of the associative property: :X, Y], Z] = [X, [Y, Z - [Y, [X, Z ~. Considering [X,Z] as the action of the infinitesimal motion X on Z, this can be stated as: There is also a plethora of graded Jacobi identities involving anticommutators \\\\\\\\{X,Y\\\\\\\\}, such as: : [\\\\\\\\{X,Y\\\\\\\\},Z]+ [\\\\\\\\{Y,Z\\\\\\\\},X]+[\\\\\\\\{Z,X\\\\\\\\},Y] =0,\\\\qquad [\\\\\\\\{X,Y\\\\\\\\},Z]+ \\\\\\\\{[Z,Y],X\\\\\\\\}+\\\\\\\\{[Z, X],Y\\\\\\\\} =0. Adjoint form The majority of common examples of the Jacobi identity come from the bracket multiplication [x,y] on Lie algebras and Lie rings. The Jacobi identity is written as: : [x,[y,z + [z,[x,y + [y,[z,x = 0. Because the bracket multiplication is antisymmetric, the Jacobi identity admits two equivalent reformulations. Defining the adjoint operator \\\\operatorname{ad}_x: y \\\\mapsto [x,y], the identity becomes: :\\\\operatorname{ad}_x[y,z]=[\\\\operatorname{ad}_xy,z]+[y,\\\\operatorname{ad}_xz]. Thus, the Jacobi identity for Lie algebras states that the action of any element on the algebra is a derivation. This form of the Jacobi identity is also used to define the notion of Leibniz algebra. Another rearrangement shows that the Jacobi identity is equivalent to the following identity between the operators of the adjoint representation: :\\\\operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]}=[\\\\operatorname{ad}_x,\\\\operatorname{ad}_y]. Here the bracket on the left side is the operation of the original algebra, the bracket on the right is the commutator of the composition of operators, and the identity states that the \\\\mathrm{ad} map sending each element to its adjoint action is a Lie algebra homomorphism.  Related identities  The Hall‚ÄìWitt identity is the analogous identity for the commutator operation in a group. The following identitity follows from anticommutativity and Jacobi identity and holds in arbitrary Lie algebra: : [x,[y,[z,w ] + [y,[x,[w,z ] + [z,[w,[x,y ] + [w,[z,[y,x ] = 0.

The term has usually referred to a type of pictorial signature of a Jinn or other entity. In modern usage, especially in the context of chaos magic, sigil refers to a symbolic representation of the practitioner's desired outcome. History 72 seals from the Lesser Key of Solomon The term sigil derives from the Latin sigillum, meaning \\"seal\\".Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn & Slate, Joe H. The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment In medieval ceremonial magic, the term sigil was commonly used to refer to occult signs which represented various angels and demons which the magician might summon.Weschcke, Carl Llewellyn & Slate, Joe H. The Llewellyn Complete Book of Psychic Empowerment The magical training books called grimoires often listed pages of such sigils. A particularly well- known list is in The Lesser Key of Solomon, in which the sigils of the 72 princes of the hierarchy of hell are given for the magician's use. Such sigils were considered to be the equivalent of the true name of the spirit and thus granted the magician a measure of control over the beings.Lemegeton Clavicula Salomonis: The Lesser Key of Solomon, Detailing the Ceremonial Art of Commanding Spirits Both Good and Evil; ed. Joseph H. Peterson; Weiser Books, Maine; 2001. p.xi-xvii An excerpt from Sefer Raziel HaMalakh featuring various magical sigils (or ◊°◊í◊ï◊ú◊ï◊™, segulot, in Hebrew). A common method of creating the sigils of certain spirits was to use kameas (magic squares) ‚Äî the names of the spirits were converted to numbers, which were then located on the magic square. The locations were then connected by lines, forming an abstract figure. The use of symbols for magical or cultic purposes has been widespread since at least the Neolithic era. Some examples from other cultures include the yantra from Hindu tantra, historical runic magic among the Germanic peoples, or the use of veves in Voudon. Austin Osman Spare The artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare developed his own unique method of creating and using sigils, which has had a huge effect on modern occultism. Essentially, Spare turned the Medieval practice of using sigils to evoke entities on its head, arguing that such supernatural beings were simply complexes in the unconscious, and could be actively created through the process of sigilization.Spare, Austin Osman. The Book of PleasureBaker, Phil. Austin Osman Spare Spare's technique became a cornerstone of chaos magic.Morrison, Grant. Pop Magic! It also influenced the artist Brion Gysin, who experimented with combining Spare's sigil method with the traditional form of magic squares: > Calligraphic magick squares were one of the techniques most commonly applied > by Gysin. He would reduce a name or an idea to a \\"glyph\\" and then write > across the paper from right to left, turn the paper and do the same again, > and so on, turning the paper around and around to create a multi-dimensional > grid... The same techniques and consciously driven functional intention also > permeated his paintings. In a very real sense, everything he created was an > act of sorcery.P-Orridge, Genesis. Magick Squares and Future Beats Chaos magic A modern personal sigil. In chaos magic, following Spare, sigils are most commonly created by writing out the intention, then condensing the letters of the statement down to form a sort of monogram. The chaos magician then uses the gnostic state to \\"launch\\" or \\"charge\\" the sigil ‚Äì essentially bypassing the conscious mind to implant the desire in the unconscious.Sherwin, Ray. The Book of ResultsMorrison, Grant. Pop Magic! To quote Ray Sherwin: > The magician acknowledges a desire, he lists the appropriate symbols and > arranges them into an easily visualised glyph. Using any of the gnostic > techniques he reifies the sigil and then, by force of will, hurls it into > his subconscious from where the sigil can begin to work unencumbered by > desire.Sherwin, Ray. The Book of Results After charging the sigil, it is considered necessary to repress all memory of it: in the words of Spare, there should be \\"a deliberate striving to forget it\\".Spare, Austin Osman. The Book of Pleasure In modern chaos magic, when a complex of thoughts, desires and intentions gains such a level of sophistication that it appears to operate autonomously from the magician's consciousness, as if it were an independent being, then such a complex is referred to as a servitor.Hine, Phil. Prime ChaosMarik. Servitors When such a being becomes large enough that it exists independently of any one individual, as a form of \\"group mind\\", then it is referred to as an egregore.Rysen, Fenwick The Fluid ContinuumEmerson, Gabriel. Egregore Definition Compilation Later chaos magicians have expanded on the basic sigilization technique. Grant Morrison coined the term hypersigil to refer to an extended work of art with magical meaning and willpower, created using adapted processes of sigilization. His comic book series The Invisibles was intended as such a hypersigil.Morrison, Grant. Pop Magic! Morrison has also argued that modern corporate logos like \\"the McDonald's Golden Arches, the Nike swoosh and the Virgin autograph\\" are a form of viral sigil: > Corporate sigils are super-breeders. They attack unbranded imaginative > space. They invade Red Square, they infest the cranky streets of Tibet, they > etch themselves into hairstyles. They breed across clothing, turning people > into advertising hoardings... The logo or brand, like any sigil, is a > condensation, a compressed, symbolic summoning up of the world of desire > which the corporation intends to represent... Walt Disney died long ago but > his sigil, that familiar, cartoonish signature, persists, carrying its own > vast weight of meanings, associations, nostalgia and significance.Morrison, > Grant. Pop Magic! A shoal of sigils Gordon White developed the technique of shoaling, which involves launching a group of sigils for a set of related aims. For example, instead of sigilizing for \\"money\\", sigilizing for a pay rise, new business clients, a promotion, influential new contacts, budget reallocation for your department, etc., all of which help \\"shift the probability\\" towards the overall aim.White, Gordon Sigils RebootWhite, Gordon.

P-Orridge was also a founding member of Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth occult group, and fronted the experimental band Psychic TV. Born in Manchester as Neil Andrew Megson, P-Orridge developed an early interest in art, occultism, and the avant-garde while at Solihull School. After dropping out of studies at the University of Hull, Megson moved into a counter-cultural commune in London and adopted Genesis P-Orridge as their nom-de-guerre. On returning to Hull, P-Orridge founded COUM Transmissions with Cosey Fanni Tutti, and in 1973 they relocated to London. COUM's confrontational performance work, dealing with such subjects as sex work, pornography, serial killers, and occultism, represented a concerted attempt to challenge societal norms and attracted the attention of the national press. COUM's 1976 Prostitution show at London's Institute of Contemporary Arts was particularly vilified by tabloids, gaining them the moniker of the \\"wreckers of civilisation.\\" P-Orridge's band, Throbbing Gristle, grew out of COUM, and were active from 1975 to 1981 as pioneers in the industrial music genre. In 1981, P-Orridge co-founded Psychic TV, an experimental band that from 1988 onward came under the increasing influence of acid house. In 1981, P-Orridge co- founded Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth, an informal occult order influenced by chaos magic and experimental music. P-Orridge was often seen as the group's leader, but rejected that position, and left the group in 1991. Amid the Satanic ritual abuse hysteria, a 1992 Channel 4 documentary accused P-Orridge of sexually abusing children, resulting in a police investigation. P-Orridge was subsequently cleared and Channel 4 retracted their allegation. As a result of the incident, P-Orridge left the United Kingdom for the United States and settled in New York City. There, P-Orridge married Jacqueline Breyer, later known as Lady Jaye, in 1995, and together they embarked on the Pandrogeny Project, an attempt to unite as a \\"pandrogyne\\", or single entity, through the use of surgical body modification to physically resemble one another. P-Orridge continued with this project of body modification after Lady Jaye's 2007 death. Although involved in reunions of both Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV in the 2000s, P-Orridge retired from music to focus on other artistic mediums in 2009. P-Orridge was credited on over 200 releases. P-Orridge was cited as an icon within the avant-garde art scene, accrued a cult following, and has been given the moniker of the \\"Godparent of Industrial Music\\". P-Orridge preferred gender-neutral pronouns when being described. Early life =1950‚Äì1964: childhood= Genesis P-Orridge was born Neil Andrew Megson on 22 February 1950 in Victoria Park, Manchester, to Ronald and Muriel Megson. Ronald was a travelling salesman who had worked in repertory theatre and who played the drums in local jazz and dance bands. Muriel was from Salford and had first met Ronald after he returned to England after being injured with the British Army at the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940. As a child, P-Orridge had a good relationship with their parents, who did not interfere with their artistic interests. Due to Ronald's job, the family moved to Essex, where P-Orridge attended Staples Road Infant School in Loughton, and for a time lived in a caravan near to Epping Forest while the family house was being completed. The family then moved from Essex to Cheshire, where P-Orridge attended Gatley Primary School. Passing the 11-plus exam, P-Orridge won a scholarship to attend Stockport Grammar School, doing so between 1961 and 1964. =1964‚Äì1968: Solihull School and Worm= After their father gained employment as the Midlands area manager of a cleaning and maintenance business, P-Orridge was sent to the privately run Solihull School in Warwickshire between 1964 and 1968; a period they would refer to as \\"basically four years of being mentally and physically tortured\\", but also a time when they developed an interest in art, occultism and the avant-garde. At age fifteen, P-Orridge became a fan of \\"The Hundred Headless Woman,\\" a book that contained surrealist collages by various artists, including Max Ernst. The book became an early source of inspiration, and it was at that time that they took on the name \\"P-Orridge.\\" Unpopular with other pupils, P-Orridge was bullied at the school, finding comfort in the art department at lunch-time and in the evenings. They befriended Ian \\"Spydeee\\" Evetts, Barry \\"Little Baz\\" Hermon and Paul Wolfson, three fellow pupils who shared their interest in art, literature, and poetry. They regularly discussed books and music, developing an interest in the writings of Aleister Crowley, William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg and the music of Frank Zappa, the Fugs and the Velvet Underground. P-Orridge became interested in occultism, and has also asserted that their grandmother was a medium. In 1967, P-Orridge founded their first collective, Worm, with school friends Pingle Wad (Peter Winstanley), Spydeee Gasmantell (Ian Evetts) and P-Orridge's girlfriend Jane Ray, which was influenced by AMM Music and John Cage's 1961 book Silence: Lectures and Writings. In 1966, Megson, Evetts, Hermon, Wolfson, and Winstanley began production of an underground magazine, entitled Conscience.Conscience zine http://www.darkmash.co.uk Forbidden from selling it on school grounds, they sold copies outside the school gates. Included in Conscience were various articles criticising the school's administration, leading to proposed changes regarding such issues as school uniforms and prefects (known as benchers) privileges. That same year, influenced by newspaper accounts of \\"Swinging London\\", P-Orridge organised the first happening at the school, doing so under the auspices of organising a school dance. P-Orridge despised their studies at Solihull School (pictured). Brought up in the Anglican denomination of Christianity, P-Orridge became secretary of the school sixth form's Christian Discussion Circle, in this position inviting members of other ideological positions ‚Äì including a Marxist from the British Communist Party ‚Äì to speak to the group. Aged 18, P-Orridge began helping to run the local Sunday school classes, but came to reject organised Christianity. Afflicted with asthma throughout childhood, P-Orridge had to take cortisone and prednisone steroids to control the attacks. The latter of these drugs caused their adrenal glands to atrophy as a side-effect, and so the doctor advised P-Orridge to stop taking them. As a result, aged 17, P-Orridge suffered from a serious blackout; while in hospital recovering they decided to devote their life to art and writing. With Hermon and Wolfson, P-Orridge founded a group called the Knights of the Pentecostal Flame. The Knights undertook a happening on 1 June 1968 which they titled Beautiful Litter. Taking place in Mell Square, Solihull, it involved the three students handing out cards to passersby that had a series of words written onto them; \\"fleece\\", \\"rainbow\\", \\"silken\\", \\"white\\", \\"flower\\" and \\"dewdrops\\". Ensuring that the local Solihull News was informed of the event, P-Orridge told reporters that the Knights wanted to ignite \\"an artistic revolution in Solihull, by making people aware of the life around them, its essential beauty and tranquillity.\\" In mid-1968, Worm recorded their first and only album, entitled Early Worm, in P-Orridge's parents' attic in Solihull. It was pressed onto vinyl in November at Deroy Sound Services in Manchester, but only one copy was ever produced. A second album, Catching the Bird, was recorded but never pressed. = 1968‚Äì1969: Hull University and Transmedia Explorations= In September 1968, P-Orridge began studying for a degree in Social Administration and Philosophy at the University of Hull. Hull was chosen in an attempt to study at \\"the most ordinary non-elitist, working- class, red brick university\\", but P-Orridge disliked the course and unsuccessfully tried to transfer to study English. With a group of friends, P-Orridge founded a 'free-form' student magazine entitled Worm which waived all editorial control, publishing everything placed into the magazine's pigeonhole, including instructions on how to build a molotov cocktail. Three issues were published between 1968 and 1970 before the Hull Student's Union banned the publication, considering it legally obscene and fearing prosecution. Developing a keen interest in poetry, P-Orridge won the 1969 Hull University Needler Poetry Competition, judged by Compton lecturer Richard Murphy and the poet Philip Larkin, who was then librarian at the university. P-Orridge became involved in radical student politics through their friendship with Tom Fawthrop, a member of the Radical Student Alliance who had led a student occupation of the university's administrative buildings as a part of the worldwide student protests of 1968. In 1969, P-Orridge attempted to reconstruct the occupation for a film, in the hopes that it would itself become a genuine protest occupation, but this venture failed due to a lack of participants. In 1969, P-Orridge dropped out of university and moved to London, and joined the Transmedia Explorations commune, who were then living in a large run-down house in Islington Park Street. The group, initiated by the artist David Medalla and initially named the Exploding Galaxy, had been at the forefront of the London hippy scene since 1967, but had partially disbanded after a series of police raids and a damaging court case. Moving into their commune, P-Orridge was particularly influenced by one of the founding members of the group, Gerald Fitzgerald, a kinetic artist, and would recognise Fitzgerald's formative influence in P-Orridge's later work. The commune members adhered to a strict regime with the intention of deconditioning its members out of their routines and conventional behaviour; they were forbidden from sleeping in the same place on consecutive nights, food was cooked at irregular times of the day and all clothing was kept in a communal chest, with its members wearing something different on each day. P-Orridge stayed there for three months, until late October 1969. They left after becoming angered that the commune's leaders were given more rights than the other members and believing that the group ignored the counter-cultural use of music, something they took a great interest in. Julie Wilson later stated that although P-Orridge's time at the Transmedia Explorations commune had been brief, \\"the experiences he had there proved to be seminal\\" to their artistic development. COUM Transmissions =1969‚Äì1970: Founding COUM Transmissions= Leaving London, P-Orridge hitch-hiked across Britain before settling down in the Megson family's new home in Shrewsbury. Here, they volunteered as an office clerk in Ronald Megson's new business. On one family trip to Wales, P-Orridge was sitting in the back of the car, then \\"became disembodied and heard voices and saw the COUM symbol and heard the words 'COUM Transmissions. Returning home that evening, P-Orridge filled three notebooks with artistic thoughts and ideas, influenced by the time spent at Transmedia Explorations. In November 1969, P-Orridge returned to Hull to meet up with friend John Shappero, who partnered with P-Orridge to turn COUM Transmissions into an avant-garde artistic and musical troupe. They initially debated as to how to define \\"COUM\\", later deciding that like the name \\"dada\\" it should remain open to interpretation. P-Orridge designed a logo for the group, consisting of a semi-erect penis formed out of the word COUM with a drip of semen coming out of the end, while the motto \\"Your Local Dirty Banned\\" (a pun on \\"band\\") was emblazoned underneath. Another logo designed by P-Orridge consisted of a hand-drawn seal accompanied by the statement \\"COUM guarantee disappointment\\"; from their early foundation, the group made use of wordplay in their artworks and adverts. COUM's earliest public events were impromptu musical gigs performed at various pubs around Hull; titles for these events included Thee Fabulous Mutations, Space Between the Violins, Dead Violins and Degradation, and Clockwork Hot Spoiled Acid Test. The latter combined the names of Anthony Burgess' dystopian science-fiction novel A Clockwork Orange (1962) with Tom Wolfe's The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test (1968), a work of literary journalism devoted to the Merry Pranksters, a US communal counter- cultural group who advocated the use of psychedelic drugs. COUM's music was anarchic and improvised, making use of such instruments as broken violins, prepared pianos, guitars, bongos and talking drums. As time went on, they added further theatrics to their performances, in one instance making the audience crawl through a polythene tunnel to enter the venue. In December 1969, P-Orridge and Shapiro moved out of their flat and into a former fruit warehouse in Hull's docking area, overlooking the Humber. Named the Ho-Ho Funhouse by P-Orridge, the warehouse became the communal home to an assortment of counter-cultural figures, including artists, musicians, fashion designers and underground magazine producers. At Christmas 1969, a woman named Christine Carol Newby moved into the Funhouse after being thrown out of her home by her father. Having earlier befriended them at an acid test party, Newby became P-Orridge's roommate at the Funhouse, first taking the name Cosmosis, but latterly adopting the stage name Cosey Fanni Tutti after the title of Amadeus Mozart's 1790 opera Cos√¨ fan tutte. Joining COUM, Tutti initially helped in building props and designing costumes, and was there when the group began including performance art and more theatrical happenings in its music events; Evetts, aka Spydeee Gasmantell, after being expelled from Solihull School joined COUM. The three of them lived in a derelict Georgian warehouse in Prince Street, Hull. An example performance involved the group turning up to play a gig but intentionally not bringing any instruments, something P-Orridge considered \\"much more theatrical, farcical and light-hearted\\" than their earlier performances. = 1971‚Äì1973: Activities in Hull= On 5 January 1971, P-Orridge underwent a legal name change to Genesis P-Orridge by deed poll, combining the adopted nickname Genesis with an altered spelling of porridge, the foodstuff which they had lived off as a student. The new name was intentionally un-glamorous, and they hoped that it would trigger a personal \\"genius factor\\". In February, COUM caught the attention of The Yorkshire Post, which featured an article on them that led to further media attention from national newspapers. They also featured in an article in Torch, the publication of the University of Hull's student union, entitled \\"God Sucks Mary's Hairy Nipple\\"; the article's author, Haydn Robb (nowadays known as Haydn Nobb), subsequently joined COUM, as did maths lecturer Tim Poston. In April 1971, COUM broadcast their first live radio session, for the On Cue programme for Radio Humberside. Following up the press attention they received, they performed further happenings, including their first street action, Absolute Everywhere, which brought problems with the police. After performing another set, Riot Control, at Hull's Gondola Club, the premises was raided by police and closed soon after; most local clubs blamed COUM and unofficially banned them. COUM drew up a petition to gain support for the group, attaining a booking at the local Brickhouse; their first performance in which the audience applauded and called for an encore. The petition had contained their phallic logo, and the police charged P-Orridge and Robb with publishing an obscene advert, although the charges were later dropped. As they gained coverage in the music press, interest in the band grew, and they supported Hawkwind at St. George's Hall in Bradford in October 1971, where they performed a piece called Edna and the Great Surfers, where they led the crowd in shouting \\"Off, Off, Off\\". The following month, the band attracted the interest of music journalist John Peel, who publicly remarked that \\"[s]ome might say that Coum were madmen but constant exposure to mankind forces me to believe that we need more madmen like them.\\" Gaining an Experimental Arts Grant from the publicly funded Yorkshire Arts Association, COUM described themselves as performance artists, being inspired by the Dadaists and emphasising the amateur quality of their work. They entered the National Rock/Folk Contest at Hull's New Grange Club with a set titled This Machine Kills Music, and organised events for Hull City Council's celebrations to mark the UK's entry into the European Economic Community in 1973. They had also worked on solo projects, generating controversy in the local press over a conceptual artwork the artist entered at a local exhibition. Taking an increasing interest in infantilism, P-Orridge founded the fictitious L'ecole de l'art infantile and co-organised the \\"Baby's Coumpetition\\" at Oxford University's 1973 May Festival, also producing material as the fictitious Ministry of Antisocial Insecurity, a parody of the Ministry of Social Security. Meanwhile, P-Orridge created the character of Alien Brain, and in July 1972, performed as the character at an event entitled the World Premiere of the Alien Brain, at Hull Arts Centre. COUM also began publishing books; in 1972, they brought out the first volume of The Million and One Names of COUM, part of a proposed project to release 1001 slogans (such as \\"A thousand and one ways to COUM\\" and \\"COUM are Fab and Kinky\\"), while in 1973 P-Orridge published Copyright Breeches, which explored an ongoing personal fascination with the copyright symbol and its implications for art and society. =1973‚Äì1975: London and growing fame= Following continual police harassment, P-Orridge and Tutti relocated to London, moving into a squat and obtaining a basement studio in Hackney which they named the \\"Death Factory\\". After a brief correspondence, P-Orridge met American novelist and poet William S. Burroughs.Metzger, Richard (31 December 2009). Genesis Breyer P-Orridge: Thee Psychick Bible.

The Disinformation Company, 2003: 103‚Äì118 1973 saw COUM take part in the Fluxshoe retrospective that toured Britain exhibiting the work of the Fluxus artists; it was organised by David Mayor, who befriended P-Orridge. At that year's Edinburgh Festival, P-Orridge undertook a Marcel Duchamp-inspired performance art piece, Art Vandals, at the Richard Demarco Gallery, engaging guests in unconventional conversation, and spilling their food and drink on the floor. Exhibiting alongside the Viennese Actionists, P-Orridge came under increasing influence from these Austrian performance artists, adopting their emphasis on using shock tactics to combat conventional morality. P-Orrdige's first film, Wundatrek Tours, was released in September 1973, and documented a day out to Brighton. Throughout the year the artist sent personally designed postcards to mail-art shows across the world. In January 1974, COUM returned their attention to music, collaborating with the Canadian artist Clive Robertson to produce Marcel Duchamp's Next Work, which they premiered at an arts festival in the Zwarte Zaal in Ghent, Belgium. COUM's next major work was Couming of Age, performed in March 1974 at the Oval House in Kennington, South London. After the show, they were approached by an audience member, Peter Christopherson, who shared many of their interests; P-Orridge and Tutti nicknamed him \\"Sleazy\\" because of the former's particular interest in the sexual aspects of COUM's work. Christopherson began to aid them using their skills as a photographer and graphic designer, and would first perform with them in their March 1975 work Couming of Youth. In May 1974, COUM issued a manifesto published on an A3 double-sided sheet titled Decoumpositions and Events. In April 1974, the Arts Council of Great Britain gave COUM the first half of a ¬£1,500 grant. The money stabilised the group, which now included P-Orridge and Tutti as directors, John Gunni Busck as technical director, and Lelli Maull as musical director. During that year, they made use of various artist-run venues in London, most notably the Art Meeting Place (AMP) in Covent Garden, where they regularly performed during 1974. A number of these works entailed P-Orridge and Tutti exploring the gender balance, including concepts of gender confusion. In one performance at the AWB, which was titled Filth, P-Orridge and Tutti performed sexual acts using a double-ended dildo. COUM were frustrated with the restrictions imposed on them by the Arts Council as a prerequisite for receiving funding; rather than performing at Council- accredited venues, they wanted to perform more spontaneously. In August 1974 they carried out a spontaneous unauthorised piece of performance art in Brook Green, Hammersmith; during the performance, police arrived and put a stop to the event, deeming it obscene. In September 1974, COUM were invited to attend the Stadfest in Rottweil, West Germany, and they proceeded with a travel grant from the British Council. There, they published two performance art actions in the street, earning them praise from Bridget Riley and Ernst Jandl, both of whom were present. The acclaim that COUM received at Rottweil established the group's reputation as \\"one of the most innovative performance art groups then on the London art scene\\", convincing the Arts Council and British Council to take them more seriously and offer them greater support. In February 1975, P-Orridge gained their first full-time job, working as an assistant editor at St. James' Press, in which they helped to compile the Contemporary Artists reference book. The work meant that they had less time to devote to COUM but gained a wide range of contacts in the art world. During that year, COUM embarked on a series of five performance pieces which it termed Omissions; these were performed across Europe. In March 1975, COUM performed Couming of Youth at the Melkweg in Amsterdam. Adopting a more violent stance than their previous work - in this reflecting an influence from the Viennese Actionists - the performance involved self-mutilation, Cosey inserting lighted candles into her vagina, P-Orridge being crucified and whipped, and P-Orridge and Cosey having sexual intercourse. At Southampton's Nuffield Festival in July 1975, COUM performed Studio of Lust, where P-Orridge publicly masturbated and all of the members undressed and adopted sexual poses. =1975-1976: Establishing Throbbing Gristle and the Prostitution show= COUM were introduced to Chris Carter in 1975 through their mutual friend John Lacey. Lacey believed that Carter would be interested in COUM as a result of his particular interest in the experimental use of light and sound. Together, Carter, Christopherson, Cosey and P-Orridge founded a musical band, Throbbing Gristle, on 3 September 1975; they had deliberately chosen that date for it was the 36th anniversary of the United Kingdom joining the Second World War. The term \\"throbbing gristle\\" was deliberately chosen for it was a Yorkshire slang term for an erect penis. Throbbing Gristle, or TG as it was widely known, was aimed at a wider audience than COUM, thereby aiming to work within popular culture rather than the elite realm of the art scene. COUM and TG were largely treated as distinct entities; the music press ignored COUM and saw TG as experimental art rock, while the arts press ignored TG, viewing COUM as performance artists. Despite their intention of operating within the realms of popular culture, TG never had chart success, and remained a cult band; their audience was far larger than COUM. COUM continued to operate alongside TG, and in October 1975 they performed Jusqu√† la balle crystal at the Ninth Paris Biennale at the Mus√©e d'art modern. The prestige of being invited to such an event led to the Arts Council awarding them a grant for ¬£1,600, although only the first half of this was ever paid out. COUM's mail art had taken on an increasingly pornographic dimension, and in November 1975 the police charged P-Orridge with distributing obscene material via in the postal system under the 1953 Post Office Act; this trial was set for February 1976. They were prosecuted in 1975 for making collages combining postcards of Queen Elizabeth with soft-core porn, but the jail term and fines were suspended on condition they did not continue.House D.

Prostitutes, punks, and people in costumes were among those hired to mingle with the gallery audience. The show caused debate in Parliament about the public funding of such events. In the House of Commons, Scottish Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Fairbairn demanded an explanation from Arts Minister Harold Lever and proclaimed P-Orridge and Tutti as \\"wreckers of civilisation\\".Williams, Sheldon. \\"Genesis P-Orridge\\". pp. 770‚Äì772 in Naylor, Colin & Genesis P-Orridge (editors). Contemporary Artists. Macmillan Press/St Martin's Press, 1977. Fleet Street was not slow to pick up the story. The reviews were cut up, framed, and put on display for the remainder of the exhibition. This was also reported in newspapers, so cut-ups about the cut-ups were also put on display. COUM was found so offensive that it lost its government grant, and went on to become the private company Industrial Records. Toward the end of COUM, performances would often consist of only P-Orridge, Cosey and Sleazy, the core group who went on to form Throbbing Gristle. Throbbing Gristle Throbbing Gristle was formed in late 1975 as a four-piece band, consisting of P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Peter \\"Sleazy\\" Christopherson and Chris Carter. The name \\"Throbbing Gristle\\" was adopted after a Northern English slang term for an erect penis. P-Orridge's involvement in Throbbing Gristle led to the artist being regularly cited as the \\"Godfather of Industrial Music\\", or in some later sources, \\"godparent\\". The first Throbbing Gristle performance was held at the Air Gallery in London in July 1976. At that point, Throbbing Gristle's headquarters was located at 10 Martello Street, Hackney, East London, the address of an artist collective. P-Orridge and Tutti's living and work space was the postal address of Industrial Records (IR). Throbbing Gristle released \\"Discipline\\" in 1980.S. Alexander Reed, Assimilate: A Critical History of Industrial Music (2013, ) TG came to be identified as the founders of industrial music, although at the same time the academic Drew Daniel asserted that as a result of its eclecticism, their music resists clear analysis. Throbbing Gristle's best- selling single was \\"Zyklon B Zombie\\" (1978), the title being a reference to the Zyklon B poison gas used at Auschwitz extermination camp. With their album 20 Jazz Funk Greats they attempted to move away from their industrial sound, and produced songs in a variety of different musical genres. P-Orridge received a number of threatening phone calls, proceeding to record them and use them as a backing track for the TG song \\"Death Threats\\". The final IR release was called Nothing Here Now But the Recordings, a best-of album taken from the archives of William S. Burroughs, who provided P-Orridge and Christopherson with access to his reel-to-reel tape archive. The final Throbbing Gristle live event, Mission of Dead Souls, occurred in May 1981 at the Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco. Shortly after the San Francisco event, P-Orridge and Paula Brooking were married. During this period, P-Orridge befriended an English musician named David Bunting; P-Orridge already knew another man named David, so coined the moniker David Tibet, which Bunting adopted as a stage name. Through an introduction provided by Burroughs, P-Orridge met Brion Gysin in Paris, probably in 1980, coming to be deeply influenced by Gysin's cut-up method; P-Orridge understood this to be a revolutionary method of escaping current patterns of thought and developing something new. Psychic TV and Thee Temple Ov Psychic Youth Genesis P-Orridge posing in Japan Following the break-up of Throbbing Gristle, in 1981 P-Orridge founded a band with Peter Christopherson and Alex Fergusson that they named Psychic TV. Involved in video art, they also performed psychedelic, punk, electronic and experimental music. The decision to name the band \\"Psychic TV\\" stemmed from P-Orridge's belief that while mainstream television was a form of mass indoctrination and mind control, it could be used as an \\"esoterrorist\\" form of magick to combat the establishment's control. Historian Dave Evans described Psychic TV as \\"a band dedicated to musical eclecticism and magical experiment, their performances being in part ritual (ab)use of sound samples, the creation of 'auditory magical sigils' and the destruction of consensus language in order to find meaning\\". The band's first song, \\"Just Drifting\\", was based on a poem by P-Orridge.P-Orridge, Genesis, Douglas Rushkoff (foreword), and Carl Abrahamsson (introduction). Painful but Fabulous: The Life and Art of Genesis P-Orridge. Soft Skull Press, 2002. For their first album, Force the Hand of Chance (1982), P-Orridge used a kangling, or Tibetan trumpet made out of a human thigh-bone; the instrument had been introduced to P-Orridge by David Tibet, and attracted attention to their music. P-Orridge had become acquainted with Anton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan and ideologue of LaVeyan Satanism, with LaVey making an appearance on the Psychic TV song \\"Joy\\", in which he recites the Lord's Prayer backwards. From 1988, the band came under the increasing influence of the acid house genre of dance music, and were responsible for helping the popularisation of acid house music in Europe. Psychic TV made its debut in 1982 at an event organised by P-Orridge, David Dawson, and Roger Ely, called The Final Academy. It was a 4-day multimedia celebratory rally held in Manchester and at the Ritzy Cinema in Brixton, South London. It brought performers and audience together with literature, performance, film and music. PTV, Cabaret Voltaire, 23 Skidoo, Z'EV, John Giorno, William S. Burroughs, Brion Gysin, Terry Wilson, Jeff Nuttall, and the Last Few Days participated to honour the cut-up techniques and theories of William S. Burroughs, Ian Sommerville, Antony Balch and Gysin. Video projection and early sampling were used here, as well as whispered utterances by P-Orridge reprocessed as a soundtrack to Gysin's Dreammachine by the Hafler Trio. In the mid-1980s, Psychic TV aimed to release a live album on the 23rd of each month for 23 months in recognition of the 23 enigma. The group didn't reach its goal but still managed fourteen albums in eighteen months, thus earning them an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. Following the culmination of Psychic TV but before embarking on Thee Majesty, P-Orridge and several Psychic TV musicians formed Splinter Test, a name adopted from one of P-Orridge's essays on sampling. In 1981, P-Orridge also founded a loosely organised network of occultists named Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth (TOPY), with the aid of John Balance, Tibet, and a number of members of the Process Church of the Final Judgement, a group which had exerted an influence on P-Orridge's occult thought. TOPY was conceived not as an occult order of teaching, but a forum to facilitate discussions on occult ideas by like-minded people, and from its beginnings was understood by its founders to be a successor to the late 19th and early 20th century Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), especially as the latter had been run under Crowley's leadership. Evans described TOPY as \\"a 'fusion' organisation, creating a crossover of punk/experimental music with chaos magical thinking and practice\\", making particular use of the sigilisation practices of occult artist Austin Osman Spare. Journalist Gavin Baddeley described TOPY as \\"perhaps the most influential new occult order of the 1980s\\". P-Orridge had never wanted to be seen as the leader of an occult order, although many of those involved in TOPY were frustrated that outsiders regularly described P-Orridge as the group's leader. Accordingly, P-Orridge separated from TOPY in 1991, although it continued as a fan community after the departure. Having been encouraged by Christian groups involved in propagating the moral panic about alleged Satanic ritual abuse, the Channel 4 1992 documentary show Dispatches claimed to have discovered videotapes depicting P-Orridge sexually abusing children in a ritual setting. Police from the Obscene Publications Squad subsequently raided P-Orridge's home, and confiscated several tonnes of art work. At the time, P-Orridge was in Thailand undertaking famine relief work; fearing arrest and loss of child custody upon return to the UK, P-Orridge stayed out of the country for several years, settling in the United States. P-Orridge believed that the negative press and police attention were the result of a vendetta conceived by a right-wing fundamentalist Christian group. It was subsequently revealed that the footage obtained did not depict child abuse. Instead, it was a video artwork titled First Transmissions that had been made in the early 1980s, partially funded by Channel 4 themselves; the footage depicted sex-magic rites between adults, bloodletting performances, and scenes of the filmmaker Derek Jarman reading passages from the work of Geoffrey Chaucer. Embarrassed by these revelations, Channel 4 retracted their initial accusations. In 2016, the film director Jacqueline Castel began work on the feature-length documentary titled A Message from the Temple, about Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth and P-Orridge. Later life =1993‚Äì2009: The Pandrogeny Project= When Genesis was 45 years old, they met their second wife-to-be, Lady Jaye (n√©e Jacqueline Breyer) in a BDSM dungeon in New York City. Lady Jaye, 26 years old at the time, worked as a nurse during the daytime, providing care for children with terminal illnesses and disabilities. In the evenings, Lady Jaye worked as a dominatrix at the dungeon, and Genesis was a visiting customer. As Genesis explained, > ..this girl walked by with a beautiful Brian Jones blonde bob and all '60s > clothes. And she was walking backwards and forwards with a cigarette in her > hand, talking to somebody. And as she carried on walking back and forth, she > gradually started to throw off those clothes and change into a really > amazing leather fetish outfit. My goodness, who is that? She's so beautiful. > We found ourselves saying out loud, dear universe, if we can be with that > person for the rest of our life, that's all we want. According to the story told by Genesis, Lady Jaye had been warned against interacting with Genesis by another dominatrix, but she ignored the warnings. The night they met, the two visited Paddles, an underground BDSM club in Manhattan. The two became a couple from that point forward. In January 1993, Genesis and Lady Jaye moved to Ridgewood, Queens, in New York City. Here, they embarked on the \\"Pandrogeny Project\\"; influenced by the cut-up technique, the duo underwent body modification to resemble one another, thus coming to identify themselves as a single pandrogynous being named \\"Breyer P-Orridge\\". In doing so, the pair spent $200,000 on surgical alteration, receiving breast implants, cheek and chin implants, lip plumping, eye and nose jobs, tattooing, and hormone therapy, while also adopting gender neutral and alternating pronouns. With this project, P-Orridge's intent was to express a belief that the self is pure consciousness trapped within the DNA-governed body. The couple adopted the term \\"pandrogyne\\" because ‚Äì in their words ‚Äì \\"we wanted a word without any history or any connections with things ‚Äì a word with its own story and its own information\\". They also stated that: During this era, a book was published of Breyer P-Orridge's writings, poems, and observations, called Ooh, You Are Awful ... But I Like You!. In the mid-1990s, Breyer P-Orridge collaborated with different people in music, including Pigface, Skinny Puppy, and Download. Breyer P-Orridge also performed with Nik Turner and other former members of Hawkwind. PTV3 live in Germany 2004: Alice Genese, G. P-Orridge, Markus Persson In June 1998, Breyer P-Orridge won a $1.5 million lawsuit against producer Rick Rubin and his American Recordings label for injuries sustained while trying to escape a fire at Rubin's home in April 1995. According to Breyer P-Orridge's attorney, David D. Stein, Breyer P-Orridge was staying at Rubin's home, as a guest of Love and Rockets, when the fire broke out. Breyer P-Orridge tried to escape the house by crawling through a second- storey window and fell onto concrete stairs. Between them, Breyer P-Orridge suffered a broken wrist, broken ribs, and a pulmonary embolism, as well as a shattered left elbow that, according to Stein, prevented P-Orridge from playing bass or keyboards. They remained in hospital for a total of ten days. The jury found that the liability for the fire rested with Rubin and American Recordings, and awarded Breyer P-Orridge US$1,572,000 in compensation. In 1999, Breyer P-Orridge performed with the briefly reunited late-1980s version of Psychic TV for an event at London's Royal Festival Hall, called Time's Up. The MC for the event, via pre-recorded video, was Quentin Crisp, it was recorded and released as a DVD. Time's Up is also the title of the first CD by Thee Majesty, Breyer P-Orridge's spoken-word project with \\"noise\\" guitarist, Bryin Dall. In December 2003, Breyer P-Orridge, using the alias Djinn, unveiled PTV3, a new act drawing upon the early \\"Hyperdelic\\" work of Psychic TV with media theorist Douglas Rushkoff among its members. On 16 May 2004 all four former members of Throbbing Gristle performed at the London Astoria for the first time in 23 years. Breyer P-Orridge appeared in the 1998 film and 2000 book versions of Modulations, as well as appearing in the 1999 film Better Living Through Circuitry, the 2004 film DiG!, Bruce LaBruce's 2004 film The Raspberry Reich, the 2006 documentary Monks: The Transatlantic Feedback, in Nik Sheehan's 2007 feature documentary on the Dreamachine entitled FLicKeR, the 2010 documentary William S. Burroughs: A Man Within,Holden, S., \\"Naked Lusts and Natural Painkillers: Portrait of a Literary Outlaw\\", The New York Times, November 16, 2010. and the 2011 film The Ballad of Genesis and Lady Jaye.Jeannette Catsoulis, \\"The Things They Did for Love (and Attention)\\". The New York Times, March 8, 2012. In January 2006, the new PTV album was announced on P-Orridge's website. Hell Is Invisible... Heaven Is Her/e was recorded in NYC and features Nick Zinner (Yeah Yeah Yeahs) and Gibby Haynes (Butthole Surfers) guesting on some tracks. To inaugurate the release of Hell Is Invisible ... Heaven Is Her/e, PTV3 hosted a five night residency in September 2006 at Galapagos Art Space in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York. Mr. Alien Brain Vs. the Skinwalkers was released on Sweet Nothing Records on 8 December 2008. Genesis P-Orridge in 2007 On 9 October 2007, Lady Jaye Breyer P-Orridge died. The cause of death was heart arrhythmia, a heart condition that was possibly related to stomach cancer. Psychic TV cancelled its North American tour dates in the aftermath of Lady Jaye's death. A memorial was held at the Participant Inc. Gallery in New York City on 8 March 2008 . As of January 2013, P-Orridge's official website said: Thus, P-Orridge continued the Pandrogyne Project, having further surgical operations to alter their body and using \\"we\\" when in reference to themselves; to a reporter P-Orridge admitted that without Lady Jaye: From this point, P-Orridge began referring to themselves in the plural in order to keep Breyer's memory alive. =2009‚Äì2020: Retirement and death= In September 2009, a retrospective of P-Orridge's collages, entitled \\"30 Years of Being Cut Up\\", opened at Invisible-Exports. On 4 November 2009 it was announced that P-Orridge would retire from touring in any and all bands (including Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV) to concentrate on art, writing and music. In June 2010, P-Orridge sold the Ridgewood property, holding a garage sale in the basement of a local art gallery to sell off a range of personal items, in addition to an array of dildos. This accomplished, P-Orridge moved to a one-bedroom apartment in New York's Lower East Side, and continued producing art in this home. P-Orridge returned to touring with Psychic TV in 2016 with the release of their album Alienist. The tour lasted from mid-September to early December, with concerts in Greece, Israel, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom and the United States. In August 2015, P-Orridge gained publicity for an interview critical of Caitlyn Jenner's self-description as a \\"spokesperson\\" for the transgender community, stating that Jenner was \\"clueless\\" and did not know what life was like for the majority of transgender people around the world. In mid-2016, P-Orridge's artwork was the subject of an exhibition, \\"Try to Altar Everything\\", at the Rubin Museum of Art in New York City. The exhibition contained paintings, sculptures, and installations inspired by the Hindu mythology that P-Orridge had encountered in Kathmandu. In June 2016, P-Orridge featured as a model in a campaign by the designer Marc Jacobs, who described P-Orridge as \\"a sort of come-to-life definition of realness and authenticity\\". P-Orridge was diagnosed with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia in October 2017, and died in New York City on 14 March 2020, aged 70. Work Influenced by concepts from both Western esotericism and contemporary Paganism, P-Orridge's work is designed to confront the audience with ways of thinking alien to the mainstream values of Western society. The religious studies scholar Christopher Partridge characterised P-Orridge's work as being a \\"confluence of pornography, violence, death, degradation, the confrontation of taboo subjects, noise and Paganism\\", deliberately courting controversy and expressing an anti- establishment stance. Partridge suggested that this intent to shock emerged both out of a serious attempt to highlight the mechanisms of social control in Western society and also out of \\"a juvenile delight gained from extreme behaviour and the offence caused\\". P-Orridge's work was particularly influenced by the early 20th-century English artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare, who shared their disdain for mainstream morality and fascination with sexuality and the human body. P-Orridge adopted Spare's views on sigils, coming to see their own work as a form of sigil magic. Spare's sigilisation process entailed writing down one's desires, before crossing out any letters that are repeated and then combining the remaining letters into an abstract design, or sigil; the magician must then focus on that sigil and mentally absorb it, and ‚Äì according to Spare's claims ‚Äì psychic energies operating on the subconscious ensure that the original desire is manifested in reality. P-Orridge adopted this theory, believing that their work operates according to its principles. A further element of P-Orridge's work is their common use of idiosyncratic grammar and spelling, such as \\"Thee\\" in place of \\"the\\", \\"ov\\" in place of \\"of\\" and (especially in early writings) \\"butter\\" in place of \\"but\\". The purpose of this is to challenge thought and established ways of reading. Personal life P-Orridge had two daughters, Caresse and Genesse, with former wife Paula P-Orridge (born Paula Brooking). An interview with Genesis and Paula P-Orridge appeared in the book RE/Search: Modern Primitives in 1989, and the Icelandic publication Eintak in 1994. On a religious or spiritual level, Christopher Partridge described P-Orridge as representing \\"a particularly interesting, influential and subversive example of contemporary paganism.\\" Asserting that their \\"industrial paganism\\" was different from most forms of contemporary paganism, Partridge described it as \\"confrontational, subversive, experimental and, to a large extent, dystopian\\", with it serving as \\"an ideological tool\\" with which to analyse society \\"from its underbelly; an immersion in the dark side; the subversion of Christian hegemony, conservative politics and what nowadays might be described as neoliberalism\\". P-Orridge was devoted to the deity Eshu Eleggu√°, an entity from the Afro- Caribbean syncretic religion of Santer√≠a. P-Orridge also stated disbelief in the literal existence of gods, deeming such entities to instead be \\"early attempts at psychology, trying to understand the light and dark side of human nature\\". P-Orridge vociferously criticised contemporary Christianity, describing it as \\"an incredibly sick social pseudo-religion\\", and arguing that it was based upon the tenet of \\"Be good now, agree, or else we will punish you forever and ever when you're dead. And we may punish you while you're alive ...\\" P-Orridge maintained that such an attitude was established in Christianity by St. Paul and the early Roman Catholic Church, and that it differed from the \\"ecstatic mysticism of the original Christianity, the Gnostic Christianity\\". In her memoir, Art Sex Music, bandmate and former significant other Cosey Fanni Tutti claimed P-Orridge had been abusive during their relationship. P-Orridge denied the allegations. Reception and legacy According to New York magazine, P-Orridge became \\"an icon of the London avant- garde\\" in 1976. Writing for The New Yorker in 2016, the reporter Hermione Hoby described P-Orridge as a \\"cult figure\\" considered to be \\"a treasure of the avant-garde by global art institutions\\". The quote that P-Orridge attributed to their mentor, \\"I feel your pain, I feel your shame, but you're not to blame\\", was used as the catchphrase for the Shirley Ghostman psychic clairvoyant character by comedian Marc Wootton. P-Orridge's ironic cult of TOPY has been criticized as being a front for abuses of power and developing an actual cult of personality. Musician Trent Reznor cites P-Orridge as a major inspiration behind his work.

It is normally reserved in the tabernacle. The Blessed Sacrament, also Most Blessed Sacrament, is a devotional name used in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, as well as in Anglicanism, Lutheranism, Methodism, and the Old Catholic Church, as well as in some of the Eastern Catholic Churches, to refer to the body and blood of Christ in the form of consecrated sacramental bread and wine at a celebration of the Eucharist. In the Byzantine Rite, the terms Holy Gifts and Divine Mysteries are used to refer to the consecrated elements. Christians in these traditions believe in the Real Presence of Jesus Christ in the Eucharistic elements of the bread and wine and some of them, therefore, practice Eucharistic reservation and adoration. This belief is based on interpretations of both scripture and sacred tradition. The Catholic understanding has been defined by numerous ecumenical councils, including the Fourth Lateran Council and the Council of Trent, which is quoted in the Catechism of the Catholic Church (which explains the meaning of transubstantiation). The largest Portuguese feast in the world is held in New Bedford, Massachusetts in honor of the Blessed Sacrament attracting over 100,000 visitors each year. Catholic Church The Blessed Sacrament exposed on the main altar of Sta. Cruz Church, Manila Perpetual adoration at the National Expiatory Temple of San Felipe de Jesus, Mexico City The Blessed Sacrament may be received by Catholics who have undergone First Holy Communion as part of the Liturgy of the Eucharist during Mass. Catholics believe that the soul of the person receiving the Eucharist must be in a \\"state of grace\\" (i.e., not be in a state of mortal sin) at the time of reception; to receive the Eucharist in a state of mortal sin is to commit sacrilege. The Blessed Sacrament can also be exposed (displayed) on an altar in a monstrance. Rites involving the exposure of the Blessed Sacrament include Benediction and eucharistic adoration. According to Catholic theology, the host, after the Rite of Consecration, is no longer bread, but Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Christ, who is transubstantiated it. Catholics believe that Jesus is the sacrificial Lamb of God prefigured in the Old Testament Passover. Unless the flesh of that Passover sacrificial lamb was consumed, the members of the household would not be saved from death. As the Passover was the Old Covenant, so the Eucharist became the New Covenant. (Matt 26:26-28), (Mark 14:22-24), (Luke 22: 19-20), and (John 6:48-58) Anglicanism Reception of the Blessed Sacrament in the Anglican Communion and other Anglican jurisdictions varies by province. Formerly, Confirmation was generally required as a precondition to reception, but many provinces now allow all the baptised to partake as long as they are in good standing with the Church and have previously received First Communion. Devotions to the Blessed Sacrament vary. Individuals will genuflect or bow in the presence of the Blessed Sacrament, which may be reserved in a tabernacle or aumbry on, behind, or near the altar. Its presence is usually indicated by a lamp suspended over or placed near the tabernacle or aumbry. Except among Anglo-Catholics, the use of a monstrance is rare. This is in keeping with the Article XXV of the Thirty-Nine Articles that \\"the Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about, but that we should duly use Them.\\" Nonetheless, many parishes do have services of devotions to the Blessed Sacrament, in which a ciborium is removed from the tabernacle or aumbry and hymns, prayers, psalms, and sentences of devotion are sung or read. In some parishes, when the Blessed Sacrament is moved from the tabernacle (from a high altar to a chapel altar, for instance), sanctus bells are rung and all who are present kneel. Lutheranism In most Lutheran churches, a person must have had catechetical training prior to a First Communion (or have received Confirmation in the Lutheran Church) to receive the Eucharist. Recently, more liberal churches allow all who are baptized to receive it. Similar to the Anglican teaching, Methodism A right The Doctrines and Discipline of the Methodist Church specifies, on days during which Holy Communion is celebrated, that \\"Upon entering the church let the communicants bow in prayer and in the spirit of prayer and meditation approach the Blessed Sacrament.\\" With respect to Methodist Eucharistic theology, the Catechism for the use of the people called Methodists states that, \\"[in the Eucharist] Jesus Christ is present with his worshipping people and gives himself to them as their Lord and Saviour\\". Methodist theology of this sacrament is reflected in a Eucharistic hymn written by one of the fathers of the movement, Charles Wesley: :We need not now go up to Heaven, :To bring the long sought Saviour down; :Thou art to all already given, :Thou dost e‚Äôen now Thy banquet crown: :To every faithful soul appear, :And show Thy real presence here! Methodists practice an Open Table, in which all baptised Christians are invited to receive Holy Communion.

A period of unusually cold weather, combined with an anticyclone and windless conditions, collected airborne pollutants‚Äîmostly arising from the use of coal‚Äîto form a thick layer of smog over the city. It lasted from Friday 5 December to Tuesday 9 December 1952, then dispersed quickly when the weather changed. It caused major disruption by reducing visibility and even penetrating indoor areas, far more severely than previous smog events, called \\"pea-soupers\\". Government medical reports in the following weeks estimated that up to 8 December, 12,000 people had died as a direct result of the smog and 100,000 more were made ill by the smog's effects on the human respiratory tract. More recent research suggests that the total number of fatalities may have been considerably greater, one paper suggesting about 6,000 more died in the following months as a result of the event. London has suffered since the 13th century from poor air quality and this worsened in the 1600s.Graunt, John, 1620‚Äì1674; Petty, William, Sir, 1623‚Äì1687 (1662), Natural and political observations mentioned in a following index, and made upon the bills of mortality [microform] / by John Graunt ... ; with reference to the government, religion, trade, growth, ayre, diseases, and the several changes of the said city, Printed by Tho. Roycroft for John Martin, James Allestry, and Tho. Dicas The Great Smog is thought to be the worst air pollution event in the history of the United Kingdom,McKie, Robin & Townsend, Mark. Great Smog is history, but foul air still kills (The Observer, 24 November 2002). and the most significant for its effects on environmental research, government regulation, and public awareness of the relationship between air quality and health. It led to several changes in practices and regulations, including the Clean Air Act 1956. Background =Sources of pollution= Battersea Power Station in 1938 A period of unusually cold weather preceding and during the Great Smog led Londoners to burn much more coal than usual to keep themselves warm. While better-quality \\"hard\\" coals (such as anthracite) tended to be exported to pay off World War II debts, post-war domestic coal tended to be of a relatively low-grade, sulphurous variety (similar to lignite) which increased the amount of sulphur dioxide in the smoke. There were also numerous coal-fired power stations in the Greater London area, including Fulham, Battersea, Bankside, Greenwich and Kingston upon Thames, all of which added to the pollution. According to the UK's Met Office, the following pollutants were emitted each day during the smoggy period: 1,000 tonnes of smoke particles, 140 tonnes of hydrochloric acid, 14 tonnes of fluorine compounds and 370 tonnes of sulphur dioxide which may have been converted to 800 tonnes of sulphuric acid. Research suggests that additional pollution-prevention systems fitted at Battersea may have worsened the air quality. Flue-gas washing reduced the temperature of the flue-gases; so they did not rise but instead slumped to a ground level, causing a local nuisance. Additionally, there was pollution and smoke from vehicle exhaust, particularly from steam locomotives and diesel-fuelled buses which had replaced the recently abandoned electric tram system. Other industrial and commercial sources also contributed to the air pollution. =Weather= On 4 December 1952, an anticyclone settled over a windless London, causing a temperature inversion with cold, stagnant air trapped under a layer (or \\"lid\\") of warm air. The resultant fog, mixed with smoke from home and industrial chimneys, particulates such as those from motor vehicle exhausts, and other pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, formed a persistent smog, which blanketed the capital the following day. The presence of tarry particles of soot gave the smog its yellow-black colour, hence the nickname \\"pea-souper\\". The absence of significant wind prevented its dispersal and allowed an unprecedented accumulation of pollutants. Effects =Effect on London= Although London was accustomed to heavy fogs, this one was denser and longer-lasting than any previous fog.Greater London Authority. 50 Years On: The struggle for air quality in London since the great smog of December 1952. Visibility was reduced to a few metres (\\"It's like you were blind\\") making driving difficult or impossible. Public transport ceased, apart from the London Underground, and the ambulance service stopped, forcing users to transport themselves to the hospital. The smog was so dense that it even seeped indoors, resulting in cancellation or abandonment of concerts and film screenings as visibility decreased in large enclosed spaces, and stages and screens became harder to see from the seats. Outdoor sports events were also cancelled. In the inner London suburbs and away from town centres, there was no disturbance by moving traffic to thin out the dense fog in the back streets. As a result, visibility could be down to a metre or so in the daytime. Walking out of doors became a matter of shuffling one's feet to feel for potential obstacles such as road curbs. This was made even worse at night since each back street lamp at the time was fitted with an incandescent light bulb, which gave no penetrating light onto the pavement for pedestrians to see their feet or even the lamp post. Fog-penetrating fluorescent lamps did not become widely available until later in the 1950s. \\"Smog masks\\" were worn by those who were able to purchase them from chemists. =Health effects= There was no panic, as London was infamous for its fog. In the weeks that ensued, however, statistics compiled by medical services found that the fog had killed 4,000 people. Most of the victims were very young or elderly, or had pre- existing respiratory problems. In February 1953, Marcus Lipton suggested in the House of Commons that the fog had caused 6,000 deaths and that 25,000 more people had claimed sickness benefits in London during that period. Mortality remained elevated for months after the fog. A preliminary report, never finalised, blamed those deaths on an influenza epidemic. Emerging evidence revealed that only a fraction of the deaths could be from influenza.Davis DL. 2002. When Smoke Ran Like Water. New York:Basic Books. Most of the deaths were caused by respiratory tract infections, from hypoxia and as a result of mechanical obstruction of the air passages by pus arising from lung infections caused by the smog.Peters, Annette; D√∂ring, Angela; Wichmann, H-Erich; Koenig, Wolfgang (1997) 'Increased plasma viscosity during an air pollution episode: a link to mortality?' The Lancet, 1997, Vol. 349 (9065), pp. 1582‚Äì87Bell ML, Davis D. 2001. Reassessment of the lethal London fog of 1952: novel indicators of acute and chronic consequences of acute exposure to air pollution. Environ Health Perspect 109(suppl 3):389‚Äì94. The lung infections were mainly bronchopneumonia or acute purulent bronchitis superimposed upon chronic bronchitis.Camps, Francis E (Ed.) (1976). Gradwohl's Legal Medicine (Bristol: John Wright & Sons Ltd, 3rd ed.) . p. 236. Research published in 2004 suggests that the number of fatalities was considerably greater than contemporary estimates, at about 12,000. =Environmental impact= Environmental legislation since 1952, such as the City of London (Various Powers) Act 1954 and the Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968, led to a reduction in air pollution. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead which produces minimal smoke. Central heating (using gas, electricity, oil or permitted solid fuel) was rare in most dwellings at that time, not finding favor until the late 1960s onwards. Despite improvements, insufficient progress had been made to prevent one further smog event approximately ten years later, in early December 1962. Cause Atmospheric scientists at Texas A&M; University investigating the haze of polluted air in Beijing realized that their research led to a possible cause for the London event in 1952. \\"By examining conditions in China and experimenting in a lab, the scientists suggest that a combination of weather patterns and chemistry could have caused London fog to turn into a haze of concentrated sulphuric acid.\\"  Representation  The Great Smog is the central event of the episode 4 of The Crown. The representation of the air-pollution seems quite accurate, even if the political importance and the chaos in the hospitals seem to have been greatly exaggerated. The Great Smog is the setting of the Doctor Who audio play The Creeping Death.

He was married to Aim√©e, a former teacher in Chicago. He was born in Toronto, Canada West to a Methodist family but several years later his family moved to Wingham, Ontario. Jackson later attended the University of Toronto for 3 years; however, due to his fathers bankruptcy, he was unable to complete his last year. In 1881 he moved to Prince Albert, Saskatchewan (then part of the Northwest Territories), where he soon began to sympathize with the M√©tis and their struggle against the Canadian government, though he was not a M√©tis himself. Jackson became personal secretary to Louis Riel when Riel returned to Canada in 1884, and the two organized a M√©tis militia and made plans for a provisional government. Open fighting broke out between the disgruntled Metis and police forces/armed civilian volunteers on March 18 at Duck Lake. That same day (18 March 1885), Jackson was baptised Catholic by Father Fourmond. Riel stood as godfather for the ceremony and gave him the name \\"Honor√© Joseph Jaxon\\". The next day Riel declared the establishment of a provisional government (see Exovedate). However, Jackson's mental health was affected by the religious event, and by the turmoil and excitement of open rebellion, and within days, Riel imprisoned Jackson, perhaps thinking he had gone insane but also fearing that his eccentric religious ideas and his support for Henry George's radical philosophical ideas against private ownership of land may cause discord within his (Riel's) followers.Beal and Macleod, Prairie Fire, p. 132-33; Donatien Fremont, The Secretaries of Riel (1985), p. 103-106 Later during the rebellion, Riel released Jackson. He was captured when Canadian government troops overcame the last Metis resistance in the Battle of Batoche ending on May 12, 1885. He was tried for treason, but found not guilty by reason of insanity and sent to an insane asylum in Lower Fort Garry, near Winnipeg, Manitoba. He escaped the asylum on November 2 and fled to the United States. Once there, he changed his name to Honor√© Jaxon and joined the labour union movement in Chicago, Illinois and was active in socialist circles as well. He also decided to lie about his identity and told others he was a M√©tis. In 1894 he was part of Coxey's Army, which marched to Washington, DC to demand an eight-hour workday. In 1897 he converted to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and oriented his concerns to Canada. He returned to Canada briefly between 1907-1909, spending some of the time interviewing former participants of the Rebellion and addressing labour/socialist meetings. He returned to the United States, eventually moving to New York City. He collected books, newspapers, and pamphlets relating to the M√©tis people in an attempt to establish in their honour a museum in New York. However, years went by and he slipped into poverty and extreme old age. He was evicted from his apartment on December 12, 1951, and his collection (considered unimportant by the city) was sold as waste paper.Smith 2007, p. iii. He died a month later.

An airlock is a device which permits the passage of people and objects between a pressure vessel and its surroundings while minimizing the change of pressure in the vessel and loss of air from it. The lock consists of a small chamber with two airtight doors in series which do not open simultaneously. An airlock may be used for passage between environments of different gases rather than different pressures, to minimize or prevent the gases from mixing. An airlock may also be used underwater to allow passage between an air environment in a pressure vessel and the water environment outside, in which case the airlock can contain air or water. This is called a floodable airlock or an underwater airlock, and is used to prevent water from entering a submersible vessel or an underwater habitat. Use Before opening either door, the air pressure of the airlock‚Äîthe space between the doors‚Äîis equalized with that of the environment beyond the next door to open. This is analogous to a waterway lock: a section of waterway with two watertight gates, in which the water level is varied to match the water level on either side. A gradual pressure transition minimizes air temperature fluctuations (see Boyle's law), which helps reduce fogging and condensation, decreases stresses on air seals, and allows safe verification of pressure suit and space suit operation. Where a person who is not in a pressure suit moves between environments of greatly different pressures, an airlock changes the pressure slowly to help with internal air cavity equalization and to prevent decompression sickness. This is critical in scuba diving, and a diver may have to wait in an airlock for some hours, in accordance with decompression tables. Applications US Navy submarine diving lock out, 2007. Airlocks are used in *aviation, certain airplanes are equipped with airlocks for skydiving, and/or emergency exits. * spacecraft and space stations, to maintain the habitable environment when persons are exiting or entering the craft. * hyperbaric chambers, to allow entry and exit while maintaining the pressure difference with the surroundings. * submarines, diving chambers, and underwater habitats to permit divers to exit and enter. * torpedo tubes and escape trunks in submarines are airlocks. * cleanrooms, protected environments in which dust, dirt particles, harmful chemicals, and other contaminants are excluded partially by maintaining the room at a higher pressure than the surroundings. * hazardous environments, such as nuclear reactors and some biochemical laboratories, in which dust, particles, and/or biological agents are prevented from leaking out by maintaining the room at a lower pressure than the surroundings. * pressurized domes such as the USF Sun Dome where pressure loss would cause collapse of the structure. * electron microscopes, where the interior is near vacuum so air does not affect the electron path. * parachute airlocks, where airfoil collapse due to depressurization can result in dangerous loss of altitude. * fermentation vessels, where a fermentation lock allows fermentation gases to escape while keeping air out, such as in breweries or wine-makers. Similar mechanisms * In cold climates, two doors arranged in an airlock configuration are common in building entrances. While not airtight, the double doors minimize the loss of heated air from the building. A similar arrangement is common in hot climates, where it is used to keep interior spaces cool. Revolving doors may be used for the same purpose. * Some jewelry stores and banks have airlock-like doors to slow the escape of thieves. * Butterfly farms and aviaries usually have an airlock-like entrance to prevent the exit of inhabitants and entrance of predatory species. * Planetariums may have \\"light-locks\\" to minimize outside light, protecting visitors' sensitive dark adaptation. These pairs of doors also reduce outside sound. Airlocks in fiction A four-door airlock (with three interior chambers) was proposed by science fiction writer H. Beam Piper in his novel Uller Uprising. The atmosphere inside the fictional structure was human-breathable, while the outside atmosphere was highly toxic. Only one door of the airlock opened at a time, and the middle chamber of the three would always contain a vacuum to minimize traces of the exterior atmosphere reaching the habitat. In the 1979 spy film Moonraker, James Bond dispatches the villain Hugo Drax aboard his own space station by first shooting him in the chest with a cyanide dart, then pushing him out an airlock into space (\\"Take a giant leap for mankind.\\"). In the 2014 science-fiction film Interstellar, airlocks are featured several times, beginning with the initial journey into space. In the film's climax, Dr. Mann attempts to maroon Cooper and Brand by stealing their spacecraft, the Endurance. When Mann tries docking his own ship onto the Endurance, he does so imperfectly. Despite this, he decides to board the Endurance from his own spacecraft regardless of the circumstances. In the midst of an arrogant monologue, he opens the airlock door. Due to the pressure change caused by the vacuum of space, the airlock explodes, killing Mann and critically damaging the Endurance. As a result of this, Cooper and Brand are forced to pursue the damaged Endurance in their own ship, as it is their only chance of survival. Due to the explosion, the circular ship is spinning out of control toward the stratosphere of a nearby planet. In a last ditch effort to save the mission, Cooper attempts to match the RPM of the Endurance with that of his own spacecraft. Due to the intense g-forces being subjected to Cooper and Brand, they must rely on their versatile AI known as TARS to accurately dock the ship with the Endurance while spinning. In the 2015 science-fiction film The Martian, airlocks are used in the Hab, a habitat and base of operations on Mars, as well as on space-faring vessels. Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded on Mars improvises a farm in the Hab where he is living. Subsequently, the failure of an airlock and the depressurization of the environment kills the potato crops he was growing. Additionally, the crew of the Hermes vessel tasked with rescuing Watney deliberately breached an airlock to produce reverse thrust, in order to slow their vessel down enough to intercept Watney's capsule. In Star Trek, Star Wars and some other works of fiction, conventional airlocks may be replaced by forcefields which hold in air while allowing solid matter like spacecraft to pass through. Airlocks of this type usually have pressure doors as a backup. Airlocks are commonly used in science fiction as a form of execution, often referred to as \\"spacing\\" or \\"airlocking\\". Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, The Expanse and the Honorverse make frequent use of or reference to it. Airlocking is also used as a means of expelling an antagonist or some object into space. In the film Alien the Xenomorph XX121 or Internecivus raptus is ejected from the Nostromo's lifeboat when Ripley opens its airlock. In an episode of the television series Space: 1999, \\"The End of Eternity\\", the alien Balor is swept out of Moonbase Alpha when Commander Koenig lures him to an airlock which unexpectedly opens. In the episode \\"Eyes\\" of the TV series Space: Above and Beyond an enemy bomb is jettisoned out of a USMC shuttlecraft just before exploding. Airlocks are also used in the following video games: * BioShock video game series for entrance and exit into water environments. * Dead Space video game series * Doom 3 * Red Faction * Spacestation Pheta See also * Fermentation lock * Revolving door * Sally port * Suitport References External links Spacecraft components Types of gates Cleanroom technology ","title":"Airlock"},{"id":"294388","text":"Africa * Egypt **President - Gamal Abdel Nasser, President of Egypt (1954-1970)Gamal Abdel Nasser was President of the United Arab Republic 1958-1961. **Prime Minister - Gamal Abdel Nasser, Prime Minister of Egypt (1954-1962)Gamal Abdel Nasser was Prime Minister of the United Arab Republic 1958-1961. * Ethiopia **Monarch - Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia (1930-1974)In exile between 1936 and 1941. ** Prime Minister - **# Makonnen Endelkachew, Prime Minister of Ethiopia (1942-1957) **# Abebe Aregai, Prime Minister of Ethiopia (1957-1960) * Ghana **Gold Coast gained independence on 6 March 1957 **Monarch - Elizabeth II, Queen of Ghana (1957-1960) ** Governor- General - **# Sir Charles Noble Arden-Clarke, Governor of the Gold Coast (1949-1957), Governor-General of Ghana (1957) **# William Hare, Earl of Listowel, Governor-General of Ghana (1957-1960) ** Prime Minister - Kwame Nkrumah, Prime Minister of Ghana (1952-1960) * Liberia **President - William Tubman, President of Liberia (1944-1971) * Libya ** Monarch - Idris, King of Libya (1951-1969) ** Prime Minister - **# Mustafa Ben Halim, Prime Minister of Libya (1954-1957) **# Abdul Majid Kubar, Prime Minister of Libya (1957-1960) * Morocco ** Monarch - Mohammed V, King of MoroccoThe monarch's title changed from Sultan to King on 14 August 1957.

Fran√ßois Baschet was a sculptor and Bernard Baschet an engineer. The Baschet Brothers invented the inflatable guitar, the aluminum piano and many other experimental musical instruments. They created an \\"Baschet Educational Instrumentarium\\" for exposing young people to musical concepts. Baschet bass cristal The Baschet's research started in the 1950s artistic turmoil, soon turning the two brothers into the pioneers of sound sculpture, in addition to making them highly requested by musicians, composers, experimental directors. The quest for new sounds led the Baschet brothers to combine new materials of the time, usually through folding metal sheets into geometric shapes. Their sculptures range from small folded sheet metal of a few centimeters up to structures several meters high with loud, impressive and complex sounds. Their exhibitions were shown in prestigious museums throughout the world ‚Äì the United States, Japan, Germany ‚Äì as well as in small villages in France, always with the aim of making art accessible to all. The work of the Baschet brothers of making sound art accessible to all continues through the official association, established in 1982: the Baschet Sound Structures Association (originally \\"Structures sonores et p√©dagogie\\", it changed its name in 2012). The association has the support of the Baschet family and has an exclusive licence for creating some of the Baschet reproductible works. Works =Instruments= The Cristal baschet is a type of musical instrument designed by the Baschet brothers in the 1950s, the Cristal Baschet is played with wet fingers on glass rods. Its continuous, enchanting sounds have inspired many artists and composers. The current Cristal Baschet models produce a variety of sounds and can also be used in percussion. They can be fitted with numerous resonators including \\"moustaches\\" and different types of diffusers: cones and metal sheets. The Rotating Whistler (‚ÄúLe Sifflant Tournant‚Äù, created in 1962, produces the sharpest and longest sounds of all the Baschet Sound Structures. Turning the keyboard produces an unusual sound effect which does not need an amplifier cone. Created in 1967, the Polytonal Percussion (‚ÄúLa Percussion Polytimbre‚Äù) includes large, straight rods that create deep, resonant sounds. The keyboard is organized with different percussive devices and cones diffuse the sound. The Voice Leaf (‚ÄúLa T√¥le √† Voix‚Äù) was created in 1965 to mimic the Indian Tanpura, the metal sheets serve as resonators which transform the human voice when vibrated. =Public monuments= The Baschet brothers also created several public monuments such as clocks, fountains, bell towers and chimes ‚Äì some ephemeral, some still in existence. One of the first fountains created was made for the World's Fair, in San Antonio Texas in 1968. They made others in the early 1970s, including in Cologne, New York, Mexico City, London and Barcelona. Subsequently, they worked on bell towers and clocks. The Baschet \\"signal sonore\\"(or school bell) of the Blaise Pascal school is in the process of being restored in Saint-Michel-sur-Orge ‚Äì the town where Bernard Baschet's studio has been since 1970. Article in Le Parisien newspaper. Retrieved 20 April 2017] =The Baschet Educational Instrumentarium= Invented in the 1980s, the Baschet Educational Instrumentarium consists of 14 sound structures which make a \\"sound palette\\" of around 100 different tones. Its purpose is to initiate children, adults and people with disabilities in collective musical discovery through games and experimentation, and without any previous musical knowledge. Based on the large, original Baschet sound structures, the Baschet Educational Instrumentarium creates a broad spectrum of sounds, including those not in the classical European repertoire, as well as some which resemble electroacoustic sounds. Education in sound culture is stimulated through listening to sounds, to oneself and to others. The experience of sound is not only through listening, it is also through hands-on learning and musical improvisation. This Instrumentarium is also used in concert by musicians. There are approximately 500 Baschet Educational Instrumentariums in existence, in France and around the world. Career Fran√ßois had wanted to be an artist, but his father warned him against pursuing the unstable life of an artist. He decided to study business in college, but felt no passion for it. After World War II, which had interrupted his education, he decided to travel around the world. He brought with him on his trip a guitar to help him earn a living, but wanting something more portable he invented an inflatable guitar using a balloon and a collapsible wood neck. He continued to perform with this guitar upon his return to Paris. Soon he and his brother, who had studied engineering, began collaborating on sculptural musical instruments. Beginning in 1952, the Baschets started research into all existing musical instruments and put this knowledge to work in creating dozens of structures sonores (i.e., 'sonorous sculptures'). Their visually striking instruments were crafted out of steel and aluminum and amplified by large curved conical sheets of metal, and are most often easy to play and accessible to people with any level of experience. One example of this is the Hemisfair Musical Fountain, which consists of an array of posts at the top of which are groups of conical sound diffusers, and above them circles of metal prongs. These are played by jets of water aimed by observers. In 1954, the brothers met Jacques and Yvonne Lasry. Jacques was a pianist and composer and Yvonne was an organist. The four formed an association which they called \\"Lasry-Baschet Sound Structures.\\" They held their first concerts in 1955. The group was successful and in 1960 were asked by Jean Cocteau to provide music for his film, Le Testament d'Orph√©e. The group toured, appearing on television shows including The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1966 they were invited to hold an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art and director Alfred Barr purchased a sculpture for the museum's collection. Their tune Man√®ge was also used as theme for the Granada TV program Picture Box, which ran in the United Kingdom from 1966 to 1990. In the 1960s the Lasrys emigrated to Israel. In 1977 Bernard met Michel Deneuve, a musician, who joined them, starting a new association, and assisted in creating instruments. Deneuve was especially dedicated to working on their instrument called the \\"Cristal\\".‚ôô‚ôôBaschet website Discography * \\"Crystal\\", Michel Deneuve, the double album for sixty years of the birth of the Crystal. 2014 * \\"Voyage autour du Cristal\\", Michel Deneuve, Rue Stendhal Distribution, new edition, 2013 * \\"Danse de Dunes\\", Michel Deneuve, Rue Stendhal Distribution, new edition, 2013 * Les Sculptures Sonores ‚Äì The First Fifty Years, FMR Records, CD, 1999 * 4 Espaces Sonores, with Bernard Baschet, Michel Deneuve and Alain Dumont, 1982 * \\"Seize Nouvelles D'Ailleurs\\" (LP), Michel Deneuve, Sysmo Records, 1983 * \\"L'Art Du Cristal\\" (LP), Michel Deneuve, Arion, 1984 * Structures for Sound, Museum of Modern Art, 10\\" vinyl, 1965 Bibliography * Frauensohn, Dani√®le and Deneuve, Michel.

Distinguishing features Code Co-op is a distributed revision control system of the replicated type. It uses peer-to-peer architecture to share projects among developers and to control changes to files. Instead of using a centralized database (the repository), it replicates its own database on each computer involved in the project. The replicas are synchronized by the exchange of (differential) scripts. The exchange of scripts may proceed using different transports, including e-mail (support for SMTP and POP3, integration with MAPI clients, Gmail) and LAN.

It debuted at the 7th Workshop on System Configuration Management in May 1997. The development of Code Co-op started in 1996, when Reliable Software, the distributed software company that makes it, was established. Reliable Software needed a collaboration tool that would work between the United States and Poland. The only dependable and affordable means of communication between the two countries was e-mail, hence the idea of using e-mail for the exchange of diffs. Of course, with such slow transport, using a centralized repository was infeasible. Each user of Code Co-op had to have a full replica of the repository, including the history of changes. The problem was reduced to that of designing a distributed database that uses slow and unreliable transport for synchronization (later, faster LAN transport was also added). It also followed that the synchronization between multiple sites must use some kind of peer-to-peer protocol. In 2018, the C++ source code for Code Co-op was released under the MIT License. Theoretical foundations Code Co-op is an example of a distributed database. Local repositories are considered the replicas of this virtual database.

His compositions include \\"Take the 'A' Train\\", \\"Chelsea Bridge\\", \\"A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing\\", and \\"Lush Life\\". Early life Strayhorn was born in Dayton, Ohio. His family soon moved to the Homewood section of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. However, his mother's family was from Hillsborough, North Carolina, and she sent him there to protect him from his father's drunken sprees. Strayhorn spent many months of his childhood at his grandparents' house in Hillsborough. In an interview, Strayhorn said that his grandmother was his primary influence during the first ten years of his life. He first became interested in music while living with her, playing hymns on her piano, and playing records on her Victrola record player.Sanford, Mary P. \\"Strayhorn, William (Billy) Thomas\\". Dictionary of North Carolina Biography, Vol. 5, 1994, p. 460. Return to Pittsburgh and meeting Ellington Strayhorn returned to Pittsburgh, and attended Westinghouse High School, later attended by Erroll Garner and Ahmad Jamal. In Pittsburgh, he began his musical career, studying classical music for a time at the Pittsburgh Music Institute, writing a high school musical, forming a musical trio that played daily on a local radio station, and, while still in his teens, composing (with lyrics) the songs \\"Life Is Lonely\\" (later renamed \\"Lush Life\\"), \\"My Little Brown Book\\", and \\"Something to Live For\\". While still in grade school, he worked odd jobs to earn enough money to buy his first piano, and took lessons from Charlotte Enty Catlin. While in high school, he played in the school band, and studied under Carl McVicker, who had also instructed jazz pianists Erroll Garner and Mary Lou Williams. By age 19, he was writing for a professional musical, Fantastic Rhythm. Though classical music was Strayhorn's first love, his ambition to become a classical composer was shot down by the harsh reality of a black man trying to make it in the classical world, which at that time was almost completely white. Strayhorn was then introduced to the music of pianists like Art Tatum and Teddy Wilson at age 19. The artistic influence of these musicians guided him into the realm of jazz where he remained for the rest of his life. His first jazz exposure was in a combo called the Mad Hatters that played around Pittsburgh. Strayhorn's fellow students, guitarist Bill Esch and drummer Mickey Scrima, also influenced his move towards jazz, and he began writing arrangements for Buddy Malone's Pittsburgh dance band after 1937.Hajdu, pp. 21‚Äì44. He met Duke Ellington in December 1938, after an Ellington performance in Pittsburgh (he had first seen Ellington play in Pittsburgh in 1933). Here he first told, and then showed the band leader how he would have arranged one of Duke's own pieces. Ellington was impressed enough to invite other band members to hear Strayhorn. At the end of the visit, he arranged for Strayhorn to meet him when the band returned to New York. Strayhorn worked for Ellington for the next quarter century as an arranger, composer, occasional pianist and collaborator until his early death from cancer. As Ellington described him, \\"Billy Strayhorn was my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine.\\"Ellington, p. 156. Working with Ellington Photo by Carl Van Vechten (August 14, 1958) Strayhorn's relationship with Ellington was always difficult to pin down: Strayhorn was a gifted composer and arranger who seemed to flourish in Duke's shadow. Ellington was arguably a father figure and the band was affectionately protective of the diminutive, mild-mannered, unselfish Strayhorn, nicknamed by the band \\"Strays\\", \\"Weely\\", and \\"Swee' Pea\\". Ellington may have taken advantage of him,Teachout, pp. 272, 273. but not in the mercenary way in which others had taken advantage of Ellington; instead, he used Strayhorn to complete his thoughts and introduce new musical ideas,Sometimes it worked the other way, and Strayhorn influenced Ellington, who then might complete Strayhorn's thoughts. Teachout, pp. 196‚Äì99. while giving him the freedom to write on his own and enjoy at least some of the credit he deserved. Though Duke Ellington took credit for much of Strayhorn's work, he did not maliciously drown out his partner. Ellington would make jokes onstage like, \\"Strayhorn does a lot of the work but I get to take the bows!\\" On the other hand, Ellington did not oppose his publicists' frequently crediting him without any mention of Strayhorn, and, despite the latter's attempts to hide his dissatisfaction, \\"Strayhorn revealed\\", at least to his friends, \\"a deepening well of unease about his lack of public recognition as Ellington's prominence grew.\\"Hajdu, pp. 171‚Äì72. Strayhorn composed the band's best known theme, \\"Take the 'A' Train\\", and a number of other pieces that became part of the band's repertoire. In some cases Strayhorn received attribution for his work such as \\"Lotus Blossom\\", \\"Chelsea Bridge\\", and \\"Rain Check\\", while others, such as \\"Day Dream\\" and \\"Something to Live For\\", were listed as collaborations with Ellington or, in the case of \\"Satin Doll\\" and \\"Sugar Hill Penthouse\\", were credited to Ellington alone. Strayhorn also arranged many of Ellington's band-within-band recordings and provided harmonic clarity, taste, and polish to Duke's compositions. On the other hand, Ellington gave Strayhorn full credit as his collaborator on later, larger works such as Such Sweet Thunder, A Drum Is a Woman, The Perfume Suite and The Far East Suite, where Strayhorn and Ellington worked closely together. Strayhorn also often sat in on the piano with the Ellington Orchestra, both live and in the studio. Detroit Free Press music critic Mark Stryker concludes that the work of Strayhorn and Ellington in the score of the 1959 Hollywood film Anatomy of a Murder is \\"indispensable, [although] ... too sketchy to rank in the top echelon among Ellington-Strayhorn masterpiece suites like Such Sweet Thunder and The Far East Suite, but its most inspired moments are their equal.\\" Film historians have recognized the soundtrack \\"as a landmark‚Äîthe first significant Hollywood film music by African Americans comprising non- diegetic music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band.\\" The score \\"avoided the cultural stereotypes that previously characterized jazz scores and rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the New Wave cinema of the ‚Äô60s.\\"Cooke, Mervyn, History of Film Music (Cambridge University Press, 2008). Cited in In 1960 the two collaborated on the album The Nutcracker Suite, recorded for the Columbia label and featuring jazz interpretations of \\"The Nutcracker\\" by Tchaikovsky, arranged by the two.A Duke Ellington Panorama accessed May 27, 2010 The original album cover is notable for the inclusion of Strayhorn's name and picture along with Ellington's on the front. Personal life Shortly before going on his second European tour with his orchestra, from March to May 1939, Ellington announced to his sister Ruth and son Mercer Ellington that Strayhorn \\"is staying with us.\\"Nicholson, p. 201. Through Mercer, Strayhorn met his first partner, African-American musician Aaron Bridgers, with whom Strayhorn lived until Bridgers moved to Paris in 1947.Hajdu, p. 65; Van de Leur, p. 118. Strayhorn was openly gay.Hajdu, p. xii. He participated in many civil rights causes. As a committed friend to Martin Luther King Jr., he arranged and conducted \\"King Fit the Battle of Alabama'\\" for the Ellington Orchestra in 1963 for the historical revue (and album) My People, dedicated to King. Strayhorn's strong character left an impression on many people who met him. He had a major influence on the career of Lena Horne, who wanted to marry Strayhorn and considered him to have been the love of her life.Hajdu, pp. 94‚Äì96. Strayhorn used his classical background to improve Horne's singing technique. They eventually recorded songs together. In the 1950s, Strayhorn left his musical partner Duke Ellington for a few years to pursue a solo career of his own. He released a few solo albums and revues for the Copasetics (a New York show-business society), and took on theater productions with his friend Luther Henderson. Illness and death In 1964, Strayhorn was diagnosed with esophageal cancer, the disease that took his life in 1967. Strayhorn finally succumbed in the early morning on May 31, 1967, in the company of his partner, Bill Grove, not in Lena Horne's arms as has often been falsely reported. By her own account, she was touring in Europe when she received the news of Strayhorn's death.Hajdu, p. 254. His ashes were scattered in the Hudson River by a gathering of his closest friends.Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 45470-45471). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition While in the hospital, he had submitted his final composition to Ellington. \\"Blood Count\\" was used as the third track to Ellington's memorial album for Strayhorn, ‚Ä¶And His Mother Called Him Bill, which was recorded several months after Strayhorn's death. The last track of the album is a spontaneous solo version of \\"Lotus Blossom\\" performed by Ellington, who sat at the piano and played for his friend while the band (who can be heard in the background) were packing up after the formal end of the recording session.Hajdu, pp. 260‚Äì61. Legacy Strayhorn's arrangements had a tremendous impact on the Ellington band. Ellington always wrote for the personnel he had at the time, showcasing both the personalities and sound of soloists such as Johnny Hodges, Harry Carney, Ben Webster, Lawrence Brown and Jimmy Blanton, and drawing on the contrasts between players or sections to create a new sound for his band. Strayhorn brought a more linear, classically schooled ear to Ellington's works, setting down in permanent form the sound and structures that Ellington sought. A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker highlighting Strayhorn's accomplishments was placed at Westinghouse High School in Pittsburgh, from which he graduated. In North Carolina, a state historical marker honoring Strayhorn is located in downtown Hillsborough, near his \\"boyhood home\\". The former Regent Theatre in Pittsburgh's East Liberty neighborhood was renamed the Kelly Strayhorn Theater in honor of Strayhorn and fellow Pittsburgher Gene Kelly in 2000. It is a community-based performing arts theater. In 2015 Strayhorn was inducted into the Legacy Walk. In his autobiography and in a spoken word passage in his Second Sacred Concert, Duke Ellington listed what he considered Strayhorn's \\"four major moral freedoms\\": \\"freedom from hate, unconditionally; freedom from self-pity (even through all the pain and bad news); freedom from fear of possibly doing something that might possibly help another more than it might himself and freedom from the kind of pride that might make a man think that he was better than his brother or his neighbor.\\" Discography For albums where Strayhorn arranged or performed with the Duke Ellington Orchestra see Duke Ellington discography * Great Times! with Duke Ellington (Mercer, 1950) * Billy Strayhorn !!!Live!!!

There were three different models introduced over time, which were popular mostly among Apple II and Macintosh owners. Original ImageWriter The first ImageWriter is a serial-based dot matrix printer introduced by Apple Computer in late 1983. The printer was essentially a re- packaged 9-pin dot matrix printer from C. Itoh Electronics (model C. Itoh 8510, with a modified ROM and pinout), released the same year. It was introduced as a replacement for the earlier parallel-based Apple Dot Matrix Printer/DMP (also a C. Itoh model) and, while primarily intended for the Apple II, worked across Apple's entire computer product line. The ImageWriter could produce images as well as text, up to a resolution of 144 DPI and a speed of about 120 CPS (characters per second). In text mode, the printer was logic- seeking, meaning it would print with the head moving in both directions while it would print only in one direction for graphics and Near Letter Quality. The ImageWriter was also supported by the original Macintosh computer, the Macintosh 128K. Apple wanted a graphical printer for the Mac, and had introduced the ImageWriter primarily to support the new machine. This permitted it to produce WYSIWYG output from the screen of the computer, which was an important aspect for promoting the concept of the GUI and, later, desktop publishing. The ImageWriter could be supported by Microsoft Windows- based PC's by using the included C. Itoh 8510 compatible driver. The ImageWriter was succeeded by the ImageWriter II in late 1985. A wider version of the ImageWriter, sold as ImageWriter 15\\", was introduced in January 1984. It allowed printing to 12\\" wide as well as to 15\\" wide paper. This version of ImageWriter remained in production for more than a year after the ImageWriter II was introduced. Production was eventually discontinued in January 1987.ImageWriter (15\\"): Technical Specifications =Accessories= In 1984 Thunderware introduced the ThunderScan, an optical scanner that was installed in place of the ImageWriter ribbon cartridge. With support for the Apple II and the Mac, the ThunderScan provided low cost grayscale scanning with moderate resolution and speed. ImageWriter II The ImageWriter II is a serial based dot matrix printer that was manufactured by Apple Computer, which supported its entire computer product line when it was released in September 1985. It had several optional add-ons available, including: a plug-in network card, buffer memory card, and motorized sheet feeder. It also supported color printing with an appropriate ribbon. Compute! reported in 1989 that many believed that the ImageWriter II was inferior to its predecessor. The magazine stated that the first ImageWriter was sturdier, handled paper better, and had better print in most cases. = Features = The ImageWriter II, like its predecessor, used a 9-pin C. Itoh mechanism. However, the ImageWriter II was significantly faster in draft mode, where it could print 250 characters per second. Color images and text could be produced by using a color ribbon, and eight colors were supported by the original version of QuickDraw on the Macintosh despite running on a monochrome platform. On the Apple II, complex full-color graphics could be printed. Used with the appropriate software, the ImageWriter II could produce color images with potentially hundreds of simulated colors through dithering. The ImageWriter II offered three ASCII text-quality modes: *NLQ (near-letter-quality) at 45 CPS, a feature for very high text quality on the Apple II platform or for improved draft printing quality on the Macintosh platform. *Standard (Correspondence) mode at 180 CPS, providing average-quality text. *Draft mode at 250 CPS, the fastest output but at the lowest quality level. In addition to having the same ASCII and European-language characters found in the original ImageWriter, the ImageWriter II added 32 MouseText characters. The ImageWriter II was designed in accordance with Apple's Snow White design language. In 1986 it received the I.D. Design Review and Silver Industrial Design Excellence Awards,Vintage Mac Club's ImageWriter II page making it the first desktop printer to receive such approbation. = Add-on accessories = The printer had an expansion socket under the front cover which could accommodate either Apple's AppleTalk network card or 32K memory buffer card, but not both at the same time. Sequential Systems produced a 2-in-1 solution card that combined both features into one card, as well as larger memory buffer cards up to 1 MB. With an optional AppleTalk networking card installed, it was a low-cost alternative to the vastly more expensive LaserWriter. Another third-party innovation was an add- on peripheral called the ThunderScan, which allowed the printer to work as a low-cost optical scanner (in which the scanner mechanism temporarily replaced the ink ribbon cartridge). The ImageWriter II also supported an optional motorized sheet feeder that could feed cut-sheet paper. = Revisions = * The original Imagewriter II (1985) closely followed Apple's Snow white design introduced with the Apple IIc,History of computer design: Apple IIc and was one of the few peripherals that matched its creamy off-white color scheme known at Apple as Fog. This model is recognizable for being white in color and not having the product name on the front cover. There were many ROM revisions produced for this and later ImageWriter IIs, made visible through a self-test (pressing the form feed button while turning the ImageWriter on, then releasing both buttons simultaneously; the printer would then print the ROM version as well as dipswitch settings). The printer came with a small built-in 2K RAM memory buffer, with option to expand. * The second ImageWriter II (1986) changed to the standard warm-grey Apple \\"Platinum\\" color. This model is not only recognizable for being light grey in color, but for having the product name printed beside the rainbow Apple logo. It was introduced at roughly the same time as the Apple IIGS in late 1986, to match its then-new Platinum color scheme which was later adopted by all other computers at Apple. * The third revision, the ImageWriter II/L (1990) as it was known internally, offered some slight design improvements. The internal power source changed to a switching power supply, reducing the overall weight of the printer by 10 pounds. As a result of the change, power and serial interface ports were moved from the legs to either ends of the tractor-feed housing. This model also increased the built-in buffer memory to 24K RAM, eliminating the need for the memory-expansion option. The expansion socket was still present for supporting an optional AppleTalk network card. The ImageWriter II was compatible with Microsoft Windows-based computers using the operating systems' included C-Itoh 8510 driver, while color support was available through third-party drivers. The only requirement was an available serial port and appropriate interface cable. Despite the introduction of the inkjet StyleWriter in 1991, the ImageWriter II kept selling. It continued in production until late 1996, making it the longest-running Apple product in history. =In popular culture= On the 2000 album A Spectrum of Infinite Scale, surf-rock band Man or Astro-man? included the song \\"A Simple Text File\\". The song is a recording of the sound of an ImageWriter II printing a carefully crafted file. An ImageWriter can also be seen the music video for Marilyn Manson's \\"The Dope Show.\\"  ImageWriter LQ  ImageWriter LQ (Letter Quality) is a 27-pin dot matrix printer introduced in 1987 by Apple Computer, Inc.. The print quality was comparable to competing 24-pin dot-matrix printers, and offered graphics at 320 √ó 216 DPI. Unlike the ImageWriter II, the LQ was unreliable and noisy. Its printhead had a tendency to overheat with large multi-page prints and melt the glue holding the crystal that supported the pins. Like the earlier ImageWriter II, the LQ can be networked on an AppleTalk network with the addition of a card. This, as well as guaranteed compatibility with both Apple II and Macintosh computers, made it popular in schools.

Penrose would go on to win the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics \\"for the discovery that black hole formation is a robust prediction of the general theory of relativity,\\" which he shared with Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez. Singularity A singularity in solutions of the Einstein field equations is one of two things: # a situation where matter is forced to be compressed to a point (a space-like singularity) # a situation where certain light rays come from a region with infinite curvature (a time-like singularity) Space-like singularities are a feature of non-rotating uncharged black holes as described by the Schwarzschild metric, while time-like singularities are those that occur in charged or rotating black hole exact solutions. Both of them have the property of geodesic incompleteness, in which either some light-path or some particle- path cannot be extended beyond a certain proper time or affine parameter (affine parameter being the null analog of proper time). The Penrose theorem guarantees that some sort of geodesic incompleteness occurs inside any black hole whenever matter satisfies reasonable energy conditions. The energy condition required for the black-hole singularity theorem is weak: it says that light rays are always focused together by gravity, never drawn apart, and this holds whenever the energy of matter is non-negative. Hawking's singularity theorem is for the whole universe, and works backwards in time: it guarantees that the (classical) Big Bang has infinite density. This theorem is more restricted and only holds when matter obeys a stronger energy condition, called the dominant energy condition, in which the energy is larger than the pressure. All ordinary matter, with the exception of a vacuum expectation value of a scalar field, obeys this condition. During inflation, the universe violates the dominant energy condition, and it was initially argued (e.g. by Starobinsky) that inflationary cosmologies could avoid the initial big-bang singularity. However, it has since been shown that inflationary cosmologies are still past-incomplete, and thus require physics other than inflation to describe the past boundary of the inflating region of spacetime. It is still an open question whether (classical) general relativity predicts time-like singularities in the interior of realistic charged or rotating black holes, or whether these are artefacts of high-symmetry solutions and turn into spacelike singularities when perturbations are added.  Interpretation and significance  In general relativity, a singularity is a place that objects or light rays can reach in a finite time where the curvature becomes infinite, or space-time stops being a manifold. Singularities can be found in all the black-hole spacetimes, the Schwarzschild metric, the Reissner‚ÄìNordstr√∂m metric, the Kerr metric and the Kerr‚ÄìNewman metric, and in all cosmological solutions that do not have a scalar field energy or a cosmological constant. One cannot predict what might come \\"out\\" of a big-bang singularity in our past, or what happens to an observer that falls \\"in\\" to a black-hole singularity in the future, so they require a modification of physical law. Before Penrose, it was conceivable that singularities only form in contrived situations. For example, in the collapse of a star to form a black hole, if the star is spinning and thus possesses some angular momentum, maybe the centrifugal force partly counteracts gravity and keeps a singularity from forming. The singularity theorems prove that this cannot happen, and that a singularity will always form once an event horizon forms. In the collapsing star example, since all matter and energy is a source of gravitational attraction in general relativity, the additional angular momentum only pulls the star together more strongly as it contracts: the part outside the event horizon eventually settles down to a Kerr black hole (see No-hair theorem). The part inside the event horizon necessarily has a singularity somewhere. The proof is somewhat constructiveit shows that the singularity can be found by following light-rays from a surface just inside the horizon. But the proof does not say what type of singularity occurs, spacelike, timelike, orbifold, jump discontinuity in the metric. It only guarantees that if one follows the time-like geodesics into the future, it is impossible for the boundary of the region they form to be generated by the null geodesics from the surface. This means that the boundary must either come from nowhere or the whole future ends at some finite extension. An interesting \\"philosophical\\" feature of general relativity is revealed by the singularity theorems. Because general relativity predicts the inevitable occurrence of singularities, the theory is not complete without a specification for what happens to matter that hits the singularity. One can extend general relativity to a unified field theory, such as the Einstein‚ÄìMaxwell‚ÄìDirac system, where no such singularities occur.  Elements of the theorems  In mathematics, there is a deep connection between the curvature of a manifold and its topology. The Bonnet‚ÄìMyers theorem states that a complete Riemannian manifold that has Ricci curvature everywhere greater than a certain positive constant must be compact. The condition of positive Ricci curvature is most conveniently stated in the following way: for every geodesic there is a nearby initially parallel geodesic that will bend toward it when extended, and the two will intersect at some finite length. When two nearby parallel geodesics intersect, the extension of either one is no longer the shortest path between the endpoints. The reason is that two parallel geodesic paths necessarily collide after an extension of equal length, and if one path is followed to the intersection then the other, you are connecting the endpoints by a non-geodesic path of equal length. This means that for a geodesic to be a shortest length path, it must never intersect neighboring parallel geodesics. Starting with a small sphere and sending out parallel geodesics from the boundary, assuming that the manifold has a Ricci curvature bounded below by a positive constant, none of the geodesics are shortest paths after a while, since they all collide with a neighbor. This means that after a certain amount of extension, all potentially new points have been reached. If all points in a connected manifold are at a finite geodesic distance from a small sphere, the manifold must be compact. Roger Penrose argued analogously in relativity. If null geodesics, the paths of light rays, are followed into the future, points in the future of the region are generated. If a point is on the boundary of the boundaries of the region, it can only be reached by going at the speed of light, no slower, so null geodesics include the entire boundary of proper future of a region. When the null geodesics intersect, they are no longer on the boundary of the future, they are in the interior of the future. So, if all the null geodesics collide, there is no boundary to the future. In relativity, the Ricci curvature, which determines the collision properties of geodesics, is determined by the energy tensor, and its projection on light rays is equal to the null-projection of the energy‚Äìmomentum tensor and is always non-negative. This implies that the volume of a congruence of parallel null geodesics once it starts decreasing, will reach zero in a finite time. Once the volume is zero, there is a collapse in some direction, so every geodesic intersects some neighbor. Penrose concluded that whenever there is a cube where all the outgoing (and ingoing) light rays are initially converging, the boundary of the future of that region will end after a finite extension, because all the null geodesics will converge. This isn't significant, because the outgoing light rays for any sphere inside the horizon of a black hole solution are all converging, so the boundary of the future of this region is either compact or comes from nowhere. The future of the interior either ends after a finite extension, or has a boundary that is eventually generated by new light rays that cannot be traced back to the original sphere.  Nature of a singularity  The singularity theorems use the notion of geodesic incompleteness as a stand-in for the presence of infinite curvatures. Geodesic incompleteness is the notion that there are geodesics, paths of observers through spacetime, that can only be extended for a finite time as measured by an observer traveling along one. Presumably, at the end of the geodesic the observer has fallen into a singularity or encountered some other pathology at which the laws of general relativity break down. = Assumptions of the theorems = Typically a singularity theorem has three ingredients: # An energy condition on the matter, # A condition on the global structure of spacetime, # Gravity is strong enough (somewhere) to trap a region. There are various possibilities for each ingredient, and each leads to different singularity theorems. = Tools employed = A key tool used in the formulation and proof of the singularity theorems is the Raychaudhuri equation, which describes the divergence \\\\theta of a congruence (family) of geodesics. The divergence of a congruence is defined as the derivative of the log of the determinant of the congruence volume. The Raychaudhuri equation is :\\\\dot{\\\\theta} = - \\\\sigma_{ab}\\\\sigma^{ab} - \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\theta^2 - {E[\\\\vec{X}]^a}_a where \\\\sigma_{ab} is the shear tensor of the congruence and {E[\\\\vec{X}]^a}_{a} = R_{mn} \\\\, X^m \\\\, X^n is also known as the Raychaudhuri scalar (see the congruence page for details). The key point is that {E[\\\\vec{X}]^a}_a will be non-negative provided that the Einstein field equations hold and * the null energy condition holds and the geodesic congruence is null, or * the strong energy condition holds and the geodesic congruence is timelike. When these hold, the divergence becomes infinite at some finite value of the affine parameter. Thus all geodesics leaving a point will eventually reconverge after a finite time, provided the appropriate energy condition holds, a result also known as the focusing theorem. This is relevant for singularities thanks to the following argument: # Suppose we have a spacetime that is globally hyperbolic, and two points p and q that can be connected by a timelike or null curve. Then there exists a geodesic of maximal length connecting p and q. Call this geodesic \\\\gamma. # The geodesic \\\\gamma can be varied to a longer curve if another geodesic from p intersects \\\\gamma at another point, called a conjugate point. # From the focusing theorem, we know that all geodesics from p have conjugate points at finite values of the affine parameter. In particular, this is true for the geodesic of maximal length. But this is a contradictionone can therefore conclude that the spacetime is geodesically incomplete. In general relativity, there are several versions of the Penrose‚ÄìHawking singularity theorem. Most versions state, roughly, that if there is a trapped null surface and the energy density is nonnegative, then there exist geodesics of finite length that cannot be extended. These theorems, strictly speaking, prove that there is at least one non-spacelike geodesic that is only finitely extendible into the past but there are cases in which the conditions of these theorems obtain in such a way that all past-directed spacetime paths terminate at a singularity. = Versions = There are many versions. Here is the null version: : Assume # The null energy condition holds. # We have a noncompact connected Cauchy surface. # We have a closed trapped null surface \\\\mathcal{T}. : Then, we either have null geodesic incompleteness, or closed timelike curves. :: Sketch of proof: Proof by contradiction. The boundary of the future of \\\\mathcal{T}, \\\\dot{J}(\\\\mathcal{T}) is generated by null geodesic segments originating from \\\\mathcal{T} with tangent vectors orthogonal to it. Being a trapped null surface, by the null Raychaudhuri equation, both families of null rays emanating from \\\\mathcal{T} will encounter caustics. (A caustic by itself is unproblematic. For instance, the boundary of the future of two spacelike separated points is the union of two future light cones with the interior parts of the intersection removed. Caustics occur where the light cones intersect, but no singularity lies there.) The null geodesics generating \\\\dot{J}(\\\\mathcal{T}) have to terminate, however, i.e. reach their future endpoints at or before the caustics. Otherwise, we can take two null geodesic segmentschanging at the causticand then deform them slightly to get a timelike curve connecting a point on the boundary to a point on \\\\mathcal{T}, a contradiction. But as \\\\mathcal{T} is compact, given a continuous affine parameterization of the geodesic generators, there exists a lower bound to the absolute value of the expansion parameter. So, we know caustics will develop for every generator before a uniform bound in the affine parameter has elapsed. As a result, \\\\dot{J}(\\\\mathcal{T}) has to be compact. Either we have closed timelike curves, or we can construct a congruence by timelike curves, and every single one of them has to intersect the noncompact Cauchy surface exactly once. Consider all such timelike curves passing through \\\\dot{J}(\\\\mathcal{T}) and look at their image on the Cauchy surface. Being a continuous map, the image also has to be compact. Being a timelike congruence, the timelike curves can't intersect, and so, the map is injective. If the Cauchy surface were noncompact, then the image has a boundary. We're assuming spacetime comes in one connected piece. But \\\\dot{J}(\\\\mathcal{T}) is compact and boundariless because the boundary of a boundary is empty. A continuous injective map can't create a boundary, giving us our contradiction. :: Loopholes: If closed timelike curves exist, then timelike curves don't have to intersect the partial Cauchy surface. If the Cauchy surface were compact, i.e. space is compact, the null geodesic generators of the boundary can intersect everywhere because they can intersect on the other side of space. Other versions of the theorem involving the weak or strong energy condition also exist. =Modified gravity= In modified gravity, the Einstein field equations do not hold and so these singularities do not necessarily arise. For example, in Infinite Derivative Gravity, it is possible for {E[\\\\vec{X}]^a}_a to be negative even if the Null Energy Condition holds.  Notes   References  * The classic reference. .

In 1977, Mack won the Pulitzer Prize for his book A Prince of Our Disorder on T.E. Lawrence. As the head of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, Mack's clinical expertise was in child psychology, adolescent psychology, and the psychology of religion. He was also known as a leading researcher on the psychology of teenage suicide and drug addiction, and he later became a researcher in the psychology of alien abduction experiences.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dz-7DPOb_g Early life, education and military service Mack was born in New York City, to an academic, German Jewish family.John E Mack Telegraph Obituary, 30 Sep 2004 His father, the historian Edward Clarence Mack (1904‚Äì1973), was a professor at CUNY, while his mother Eleanor Liebmann Mack (1905‚Äì1930) died while John was an infant. After his mother died, his father remarried the economist Ruth P. Mack, through which he had a half-sister, Mary Lee Ingbar, a pioneer of computer analysis who became a professor at Dartmouth College and University of Massachusetts Medical School.Mary Lee Ingbar, pioneer in field of health economics, dies at 83 The Harvard Gazette, October 15, 2009 Growing up, his father would read the Bible to John and his sister, but as a work of culture or literature. Mack graduated from the Horace Mann-Lincoln School in 1947 and Phi Beta Kappa from Oberlin in 1951, and received his medical doctorate degree cum laude from Harvard Medical School in 1955. Mack subsequently interned at the Massachusetts General Hospital and trained as a psychiatrist at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center. In 1959, Mack joined the United States Air Force, serving as a medic in Japan, where he rose to the rank of captain. In 1961 he returned from military service in Japan, continuing at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center and Boston Psychoanalytic Society and Institute receiving certification in child and adult psychoanalysis and psychotherapy. From 1964 Mack returned to Harvard Medical School, becoming a full professor at Harvard in 1972. In 1977, he became the Head of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, which position he occupied until his death in 2004. Mack published over 150 scientific articles and eleven books in his career. As department head at Harvard Medical School, he worked primarily in the field of child and adolescent psychology. He worked on treating suicidal patients, and published research on heroin addiction.Heroin Use as an Attempt To Cope: Clinical Observations, EDWARD J. KHANTZIAN , JOHN E. MACK , and ALAN F. SCHATZBERG, The American Journal of Psychiatry, Volume 131 Issue 2 The dominant theme of his life's work at Harvard had been the exploration of how one's perceptions of the world affect one's relationships. He addressed this issue of \\"world view\\" on the individual level in his early clinical explorations of dreams, nightmares and teen suicide, and in A Prince of Our Disorder, his biographical study of the life of British officer T. E. Lawrence, for which he received the Pulitzer Prize for Biography in 1977.Mack 1976  Activism during the Cold War  In the 1980s, Mack interviewed many international political figures as part of his research into the root causes of the Cold War, including former United States President Jimmy Carter and the \\"father of the hydrogen bomb\\", Edward Teller. Mack, together with luminaries such as Carl Sagan and other Physicians for Social Responsibility (the United States affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War) promoted the elimination of nuclear weapons and an end to the simmering conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Emboldened by the organization's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, Mack, Sagan, and 700 other academics walked upon the grounds of the Nevada Test Site in the summer of 1986, setting a civil disobedience record for that nuclear weapons testing facility. The psychology of alien abduction phenomena In the early 1990s, Mack commenced a decade-plus psychological study of 200 men and women who reported recurrent alien encounter experiences. Such encounters had seen some limited attention from academic figures, R. Leo Sprinkle perhaps being the earliest, in the 1960s. Mack, however, remains probably the most esteemed academic to have studied the subject. He initially suspected that such persons were suffering from mental illness, but when no obvious pathologies were present in the persons he interviewed, his interest was piqued. Following encouragement from longtime friend Thomas Kuhn, who predicted that the subject might be controversial, but urged Mack to collect data and ignore prevailing materialist, dualist and \\"either/or\\" analysis, Mack began concerted study and interviews. Many of those he interviewed reported that their encounters had affected the way they regarded the world, including producing a heightened sense of spirituality and environmental concern. Mack was somewhat more guarded in his investigations and interpretations of the abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that \\"On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go.\\"Matheson 1998, p. 251. In a 1994 interview, Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed \\"inclined to take these [abduction] reports at face value\\". Mack replied by saying \\"Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't have a way to account for them.\\" In a 1996 interview with PBS he stated ...It's both literally, physically happening to a degree; and it's also some kind of psychological, spiritual experience occurring and originating perhaps in another dimension. The BBC quoted Mack as saying, \\"I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [But] I would say there is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is but it seems to me that it invites a deeper, further inquiry.\\" Mack noted that there was a worldwide history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of this larger tradition of visionary encounters. His interest in the spiritual or transformational aspects of people's alien encounters, and his suggestion that the experience of alien contact itself may be more transcendent than physical in nature‚Äîyet nonetheless real‚Äîset him apart from many of his contemporaries, such as Budd Hopkins, who advocated the physical reality of aliens. His later research broadened into the general consideration of the merits of an expanded notion of reality, one which allows for experiences that may not fit the Western materialist paradigm, yet deeply affect people's lives. His second (and final) book on the alien encounter experience, Passport to the Cosmos: Human Transformation and Alien Encounters (1999), was as much a philosophical treatise connecting the themes of spirituality and modern world-views as it was the culmination of his work with the \\"experiencers\\" of alien encounters, to whom the book is dedicated. Investigation by Harvard for his work on \\"alien abduction\\" cases In May 1994, the Dean of Harvard Medical School, Daniel C. Tosteson, appointed a committee of peers to confidentially review Mack's clinical care and clinical investigation of the people who had shared their alien encounters with him (some of their cases were written of in Mack's 1994 book Abduction). Angela Hind wrote, \\"It was the first time in Harvard's history that a tenured professor was subjected to such an investigation.\\" The committee chairman was Arnold \\"Budd\\" Relman, M.D., a Professor of Medicine and of Social Medicine at Harvard Medical School who served as editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. According to Daniel P. Sheehan, one of Mack's attorneys, the committee's draft report suggested that \\"To communicate, in any way whatsoever, to a person who has reported a ‚Äòclose encounter‚Äô with an extraterrestrial life form that this experience might well have been real ... is professionally irresponsible.‚Äù Upon the public revelation of the existence of the committee (inadvertently revealed during the solicitation of witnesses for Mack's defense, ten months into the process), questions arose from the academic community (including Harvard Professor of Law Alan Dershowitz) regarding the validity of an investigation of a tenured professor who was not suspected of ethics violations or professional misconduct. Concluding the fourteen-month investigation, Harvard then issued a statement stating that the Dean had \\"reaffirmed Dr. Mack's academic freedom to study what he wishes and to state his opinions without impediment,\\" concluding \\"Dr. Mack remains a member in good standing of the Harvard Faculty of Medicine.\\" (Mack was censured in the committee's report for what they believed were methodological errors, but Dean Tosteson took no action based on the committee's assessment.) He had received legal help from Roderick MacLeish and Daniel Sheehandanielpsheehan.com (of the Pentagon Papers case), and the support of Laurance Rockefeller, who also funded Mack's non-profit organization for four consecutive years at $250,000 per year. Death On Monday, September 27, 2004 while in London to lecture at a T. E. Lawrence Society-sponsored conference, Mack was killed by a drunken driver heading west on Totteridge Lane. He was walking home alone, after a dinner with friends, when he was struck at 11:25 p.m. near the junction of Totteridge Lane and Longland Drive. He lost consciousness at the scene of the accident and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. The driver, Raymond Czechowski, an IT manager, was arrested at the scene, and later entered a plea of guilty by careless driving while under the influence of alcohol. Mack's family requested leniency for the suspect Czechowski in a letter to the Wood Green Crown Court. \\"Although this was a tragic event for our family,\\" the letter reads, \\"we feel [the accused's] behavior was neither malicious nor intentional, and we have no ill will toward him since we learned of the circumstances of the collision.\\" The driver, Ray Czechowski served 6 months and was disqualified from driving for 3 years.

Lewis, ed., The Anglican Library.Van Eerde, Katherine S. \\"Robert Waldegrave: The Printer as Agent and Link Between Sixteenth-Century England and Scotland‚Äù in Renaissance Quarterly 34 (1981), 40‚Äì78 was the name used by the anonymous author or authors of the seven Marprelate tracts that circulated illegally in England in the years 1588 and 1589. Their principal focus was an attack on the episcopacy of the Anglican Church. Background In 1583, the appointment of John Whitgift as Archbishop of Canterbury had signalled the beginning of a drive against the Presbyterian movement in the church, and an era of censorship began. In 1586, by an edict of the Star Chamber, the archbishop was empowered to license and control all of the printing apparatus in the country. Identity and authorship The true identity of \\"Martin\\" was for a long time the subject of speculation. For many years, the main candidate was John Penry, a Welsh preacher and author of several impassioned polemics against the state of the church. Renaissance historian John Dover Wilson posited, in his 1912 book Martin Marprelate and Shakespeare's Fluellen,Dover Wilson, John, Martin Marprelate and Shakespeare's Fluellen, Alexander Moring Limited, 1912. the Welsh soldier Roger Williams was the author of the first three tracts signed \\"Martin Prelate\\", with Penry authoring the subsequent tracts signed \\"Martin Junior\\" and the Warwickshire squire and Member of Parliament Job Throckmorton the author of those signed \\"Martin Senior\\". In 1981 Leland Carlson argued for the authorship of Job Throckmorton.Carlson, Leland H., Martin Marprelate, Gentleman: Master Job Throckmorton Laid Open In His Colours (San Marino: Huntington Library, 1981) Kathryn M. Longley and Patrick Collinson suggested George Carleton. Henry M Dexter argued for Henry Barrow. Recent scholarship, the most authoritative and exhaustive being Joseph Black's The Martin Marprelate Tracts: A Modernized and Annotated Edition, has established that Throkmorton was the main author, assisted by Penry. The tracts had to be printed in secrecy, and some sort of organisation was involved to handle their production and distribution. Penry was definitely involved in the printing, and the press was frequently relocated to different parts of the country to avoid the authorities. Penry himself denied any involvement in the actual authorship. Official reaction The government was concerned enough at the virulence of the attacks on the ecclesiastical hierarchy to respond in kind, hiring professional writers such as Thomas Nashe, Robert Greene and John Lyly to write counter-tracts. The tracts are invectives against the episcopacy and sometimes described the bishops as representing the Antichrist. The most prolific and effective of the anti-Martinists went by the colourful sobriquet, \\"the renowned Cavaliero Pasquill,\\". Pasquill was traditionally believed to have been Thomas Nashe, however R. B. McKerrow, the editor of Nashe's complete works refutes this: \\"further study led me to suspect ‚Äì indeed, to feel almost certain ‚Äì that Nashe had nothing to do with them (anti-Marprelates texts).\\"R. B. McKerrow, ed., The Works of Thomas Nashe, 5 vols. 1904‚Äì10, repr. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1958. 5:50 Francis Bacon also involved himself in the pamphleteering, writing An Advertisement Touching the Controversies of the Church of England in 1589, a piece which did not leave the bishops free from criticism. Some scholars, notably Arul Kumuran, have argued Robert Greene's later works were influenced by the Marprelate pamphlets,Writing Robert Greene: Essays on England's First Notorious Professional Writer, by Edward Gieskes and Kirk Melnikoff, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 28 April 2013, p.207 though Greene is noted as an anti- Martinist author.The Life of William Shakespeare: A Critical Biography by Lois Potter, John Wiley & Sons, 7 May 2012, p.73 Later influence and interpretation Some of the Marprelate pamphlets were reprinted in the seventeenth century, and an extensive scholarship has commented on their historical and literary significance. The anti-Martinist literature, including the Pasquill pamphlets, by contrast, has suffered from relative neglect by scholars of early modern England. During the English civil war, Leveller pamphleteer Richard Overton embraced Marprelate's legacy by publishing several tracts as \\"Martin Marpriest\\", purportedly Martin Marprelate's son. The Marprelate tracts are important documents in the history of English satire: critics from C. S. Lewis to John Carey have recognised their originality. In particular, the pamphlets show concern with the status of the text, wittily pastiching conventions such as the colophon and marginalia.

Early life and education Cephas Washburn was born on July 25, 1793 in Rutland, Vermont. His parents were Josiah W. and Phebe (nee'Cushman) Washburn.Everett, Dianna. \\"Washburn, Cephas (1793-1860).\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed January 10, 2019. His father was a farmer, and Cephas seemed destined to follow in that occupation. However, he suffered a broken leg while working, and decided to take up teaching as a career. While raising enough money to pursue higher education, he taught school in Groton, Massachusetts during 1814 and 1815. While teaching, he became a member of the Congregationalist church and decided to become a missionary to the Indians.Stewart-Abernathy, Leslie C. \\"Cephas Washburn (1793‚Äì1860).\\" Encyclopedia of Arkansas. 2009. Accessed February 11, 2019. He graduated from the University of Vermont and the Andover Theological Seminary. After graduating from the University of Vermont, he was ordained as a Congregational minister. The Royalton Congregational Association in Randolph licensed Washburn to preach in January 1818. On October 6, 1818, he married Abigail F. Woodward of Randolph, Vermont. Career After the Washburns were married, Cephas was ordained in 1818 in Waitsfield, Vermont by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) to serve as a missionary to the Eastern Cherokee Indians, who then lived primarily lived in the U.S. State of Georgia. He was assigned to the Cherokee. He remained in Georgia for about one year. Then the ABCFM sent him to Arkansas as the missionary to Cherokees who had already begun moving west. These people would thereafter be called \\"Western Cherokees\\" He served as a missionary to the Cherokee Indians at Brainerd Mission, Tennessee, for a short while. He migrated with them westward, arriving in Arkansas in 1819. This was a group that removed relatively early from the Southeast, rather than waiting for forced removal after the US Congress passed the Indian Removal Act of 1830. Most Cherokee were removed across the Mississippi River to a designated part of Indian Territory (present Eastern Oklahoma)in 1838. The party that travelled to Russellville included not only Cephas Washburn and his wife, but also his brother in law, Reverend Alfred Finney, as well as several others who would support the educational facility. Washburn founded Dwight Presbyterian Mission near Russellville in 1821 to serve the newly arrived Cherokee. Dwight was the first American mission to the Indians west of the Mississippi River. The mission was later moved to It was named for Rev. Timothy Dwight, president of Yale College and a corporate member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. The Dwight Mission (later called \\"Old Dwight Mission\\") in Arkansas was supplanted by another mission with the same name in Indian Territory, near what is now Sallisaw, Oklahoma. The latter became known as \\"New Dwight Mission\\". Washburn served as the primary Indian missionary in the Arkansas region until he resigned in 1850. From 1850 to 1856 he served as minister for the First Presbyterian Church in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Later life, death and burial Cephas Washburn died at Little Rock, Arkansas on March 17, 1860 of pneumonia, while traveling to Helena, Arkansas for an evangelical meeting. He is buried at the historic Mount Holly Cemetery in downtown Little Rock. Family Washburn's son Edward Payson Washburn was the artist who painted the well-known Arkansas Traveller painting. It received wide distribution and recognition when printed as a Currier & Ives lithograph. The painting was inspired by the humorous song \\"Arkansas Traveller\\" by Colonel Sanford 'Sandy' Faulkner.

He is particularly noted for his appearances in 21 of Akira Kurosawa's 30 films (more than any other actor), including as a lead actor in Drunken Angel (1948), Rashomon (1950), Ikiru (1952) and Seven Samurai (1954).Takashi Shimura on JMDB Early life Shimura was born in Ikuno, Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan. His birth-name was Shimazaki Sh≈çji (Â≥∂Â¥éÊç∑Áàæ). His forebears were members of the samurai class: in 1868 his grandfather took part in the Battle of Toba‚ÄìFushimi during the Boshin War. Shimura entered Ikuno Primary School in 1911 and Kobe First Middle School in 1917. He missed two years of schooling because of a mild case of tuberculosis, and subsequently moved to the prefectural middle school in Nobeoka, Miyazaki Prefecture, where his father had been transferred by his employer, Mitsubishi Mining. At Nobeoka Middle School, he excelled in English and became active on the literary society's magazine, to which he contributed poetry. He also became a star of the rowing club. In 1923, he entered Kansai University, but after his father's retirement the family could no longer afford the fees for a full-time course and he switched to the part- time evening course in English literature, supporting himself by working at the Osaka municipal waterworks. Among the teachers in the English Literature Department were the playwright Toyo-oka Sa-ichir≈ç (Ë±äÂ≤°‰Ωê‰∏ÄÈÉé) and the Shakespeare scholar Tsubouchi Shik≈ç (Âù™ÂÜÖÂ£´Ë°å). These two inspired in Shimura an enthusiasm for drama. He joined the University's Theatre Studies Society and in 1928 formed an amateur theatrical group, the Shichigatsu-za (‰∏ÉÊúàÂ∫ß) with Toyo-oka as director. He began to miss work because of the time he spent on theatrical activities and eventually lost his job. He then left university to try to earn a living in the theatre. The Shichigatsu-za turned professional and began to tour, but got into financial difficulties and folded.Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). ‚Äî Kodansha Ltd, 1999. ‚Äî . Career After the failure of the Shichigatsu-za, Shimura went back to Osaka, where he began to get roles in radio plays. In 1930 he joined the Kindaiza (Ëøë‰ª£Â∫ß) theatre company and became a fully professional actor. He toured China and Japan with the Kindaiza, but in 1932 he left the company and returned again to Osaka, where he appeared with the Shinseigeki (Êñ∞Â£∞Âäá) and Shinsenza (Êñ∞ÈÅ∏Â∫ß) troupes. Talking pictures were just then coming in and Shimura realised they would provide opportunities for stage-trained actors. In 1932 he joined the Kyoto studios of the film production company Shink≈ç Kinema. He made his film debut in the 1934 silent Ren'ai-gai itch≈çme (ÊÅãÊÑõË°ó‰∏Ä‰∏ÅÁõÆ: Number One, Love Street). The first film in which he had a speaking part was the 1935 Ch≈´ji uridasu (Âø†Ê¨°Â£≤Âá∫„Åô), directed by Mansaku Itami. His first substantial film role was as a detective in Mizoguchi Kenji's 1936 Osaka Elegy (Naniwa erejii; Êµ™ËèØÊÇ≤Ê≠å).Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). ‚Äî Kodansha Ltd, 1999. ‚Äî . Shimura as a terminally ill bureaucrat in Kurosawa's Ikiru The film which established his reputation as a first-rate actor was Itami Mansaku's 1936 Akanishi Kakita (Ëµ§Ë•øË†£Â§™: Capricious Young Man). In 1937 he moved to Nikkatsu film corporation's Kyoto studios, and between then and 1942 appeared in nearly 100 films. His most notable role in these years was that of Keishir≈ç in the long-running series Umon Torimono-ch≈ç (Âè≥ÈñÄÊçïÁâ©Â∏ñ), starring Kanj≈´r≈ç Arashi. He also demonstrated his considerable ability as a singer in the 1939 \\"cine-operetta\\", Singing Lovebirds. During this time the political regime in Japan was growing ever more oppressive, and Shimura was arrested by the Special Higher Police (Tokubetsu K≈çt≈ç Keisatsu, known as Tokk≈ç) and held for about three weeks because of his earlier association with left-wing theatre groups. He was eventually released on the recognisance of his wife Masako and fellow-actor Ry≈´nosuke Tsukigata. He is said to have made use of this experience later when playing a Tokk≈ç official in Akira Kurosawa's 1946 No Regrets for Our Youth. When Nikkatsu and Daiei merged in 1942, Shimura moved to the K≈ça Eiga studios and then in 1943 to T≈çh≈ç.Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). ‚Äî Kodansha Ltd, 1999. ‚Äî . A few weeks before the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, Shimura's elder brother was killed in Southeast Asia. In 1943, Shimura appeared as the old jujutsu teacher Murai Hansuke, a character based in the historical Hansuke Nakamura, in Kurosawa's debut movie, Sanshiro Sugata.Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). ‚Äî Kodansha Ltd, 1999. ‚Äî . Along with Toshir≈ç Mifune, Shimura is the actor most closely associated with Kurosawa: he eventually appeared in 21 of Kurosawa's 30 films. In fact, Kurosawa's cinematic collaboration with Shimura, from Sanshiro Sugata in 1943 to Kagemusha in 1980, started earlier and lasted longer than his work with Mifune (1948‚Äì65). Shimura's performances for Kurosawa included the doctor in Drunken Angel (1948), the veteran detective in Stray Dog (1949), the flawed lawyer in Scandal (1950), the woodcutter in Rashomon (1950), the mortally ill bureaucrat in Ikiru (1952), and the lead samurai Kambei in Seven Samurai (1954). Kurosawa wrote the part in Kagemusha specifically for Shimura, but the scenes were cut from the Western release, so many in the West did not know that he had been in the film. The DVD release of the film by The Criterion Collection restored Shimura's footage. Shimura appeared in a number of T≈çh≈ç kaiju (giant monster) and tokusatsu (special effects) films, many of which were directed by Kurosawa's good friend and colleague Ishir≈ç Honda. Shimura's roles included Professor Kyohei Yamane in the original Godzilla (1954), a character he briefly reprised in Godzilla Raids Again (1955). Death Shimura died on February 11, 1982 in Tokyo, Japan, from emphysema at the age of 76.Shimura Takashi // Encyclopedia of Japan (CD-ROM). ‚Äî Kodansha Ltd, 1999. ‚Äî .

Timothy Dwight, president of Yale College and a corporate member of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.Dianna Everett, \\"Dwight Mission,\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, Accessed February 21, 2015. By 1824, Dwight Mission was a self-contained small town on the frontier. According to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture, there were at least 24 buildings, including residences for missionaries, students, staff, and visitors; support buildings that included a combination library, post office and pharmacy; a dining hall with kitchen; a storehouse; a blacksmith shop; lathe and carpenter shop; a stable and a barn. A new treaty between the Cherokees and the United States in 1828 required the Arkansas Cherokees to move to Indian Territory. Therefore, the mission was reestablished in its present-day location, in May 1829, on Sallisaw Creek, near the city of Marble City, Oklahoma. The school opened May 1, 1830. Initially, the facility had a double log house (a building combining school and living quarters) and several log houses to house the staff. Eventually, there would be twenty-one houses, a dining hall, a barn and a number of outbuildings. The mission had more than a dozen staff members and eighty students at the peak of its activity. Its primary mission was to provide an education to Cherokee children and expose them to the Christian religion. Samuel Worcester served at the mission in 1835, after having worked with the Cherokee as a missionary in Georgia before removal. He created the type for the Cherokee syllabary for their first newspaper, the Cherokee Phoenix. In 1837, the first Cherokee language printing press in the then Indian Territory (now Oklahomahttp://digital.library.okstate.edu/chronicles/v013/v013p251.html) was moved from Union Mission to Dwight Mission. In 1839, the majority of the Cherokee nation was removed to the area from the Southeast on the Trail of Tears.See historic marker on the grounds of Dwight Mission thumb alt=A 3 and a half story building sided with wooden shingles. There is a porch with white pillars at the front of the building. During the American Civil War, many of the mission's buildings were burned down in warfare between pro-Confederate and pro-Union forces. The last religious service was in November 1862. Then it was abandoned. Afterwards, the property was taken over by private owners. By 1884, only two of the original buildings remained. The Cherokee National Council decided to reopen the school in 1886. The Presbyterian Women's Board of Home Missions supplied funds to do this, and a large building was constructed to serve as a boarding school for Cherokee girls. After 1895, it became a day school, then resumed the boarding school concept in 1900, this time for boys and girls. On January 12, 1918, a fire burned the Dwight Mission School dormitory, destroying the dormitory and killing thirteen students. The students were named as: George Wickett (Cherokee), Nighthawk Mclemore (Cherokee), Phillip Correll (Cherokee), Rufus Young (Cherokee), J. P. Chandler, Jr (Cherokee), Kenneth Crutchfield (Cherokee), Delbert Barnes (Cherokee), Wilson Beaver (Creek), George Tiger (Creek), Robert Daniels (Creek), Solomon Bruner (Creek), Newton Goins (Choctaw), and Gilbert Grants (Omaha). The boys, who were aged 9 to 17, were trapped on a screened porch. Their bodies were returned to their hometowns, and a memorial for them was erected in the Dwight Mission Cemetery. By 1944, the facility was called Dwight Indian Training School. It was then operated by Board of National Missions of the Presbyterian Church USA, and served seventy-one students, mostly Cherokee and Choctaw. The school was closed in 1948. In the fall of 1950, a number of Presbyterian laymen felt that the Synod of Oklahoma should acquire the property and preserve it because of its long association with the Presbyterian Church. They formed Dwight Mission, Inc. and purchased the property on May 6, 1951 for $35,000. Dwight Mission, Inc. and the Synod of Oklahoma managed the daily programs for the next 30 years. Dwight Mission today operates as a Presbyterian camp, retreat, and conference center between Marble City and Sallisaw Oklahoma. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

In other words, type A is a subtype of type B when A's specification implies B's specification. That is, any object (or class) that satisfies A's specification also satisfies B's specification, because B's specification is weaker. The is-a relationship is to be contrasted with the has-a (has_a or has a) relationship between types (classes); confusing the relations has-a and is-a is a common error when designing a model (e.g., a computer program) of the real-world relationship between an object and its subordinate. The is-a relationship may also be contrasted with the instance-of relationship between objects (instances) and types (classes): see \\"type-token distinction\\" and \\"type-token relations.\\"Type‚Äìtoken relations To summarize the relations, there are: * hyperonym‚Äìhyponym (supertype‚Äìsubtype) relations between types (classes) defining a taxonomic hierarchy, where ** for a subsumption relation: a hyponym (subtype, subclass) has a type-of (is-a) relationship with its hyperonym (supertype, superclass); * holonym‚Äìmeronym (whole/entity/container-part/constituent/member) relations between types (classes) defining a possessive hierarchy, where ** for an aggregation (i.e. without ownership) relation: *** a holonym (whole) has a has-a relationship with its meronym (part), ** for a composition (i.e. with ownership) relation: *** a meronym (constituent) has a part-of relationship with its holonym (entity), ** for a containmentSee also Containment (computer programming). relation: *** a meronym (member) has a member-of relationship with its holonym (container); * concept-object (type-token) relations between types (classes) and objects (instances), where ** a token (object) has an instance-of relationship with its type (class). Examples of subtyping Subtyping enables a given type to be substituted for another type or abstraction. Subtyping is said to establish an is-a relationship between the subtype and some existing abstraction, either implicitly or explicitly, depending on language support. The relationship can be expressed explicitly via inheritance in languages that support inheritance as a subtyping mechanism. =C++= The following C++ code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes B and A, where B is both a subclass and a subtype of A, and can be used as an A wherever a B is specified (via a reference, a pointer or the object itself). class A { public: void DoSomethingALike() const {} }; class B : public A { public: void DoSomethingBLike() const {} }; void UseAnA(A const& some_A) { some_A.DoSomethingALike(); } void SomeFunc() { B b; UseAnA(b); // b can be substituted for an A. } =Python= The following python code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes and , where is both a subclass and a subtype of , and can be used as an wherever a is required. class A: def do_something_a_like(self): pass class B(A): def do_something_b_like(self): pass def use_an_a(some_a): some_a.do_something_a_like() def some_func(): b = B() use_an_a(b) # b can be substituted for an A. The following example, is a \\"regular\\" type, and is a metatype. While as distributed all types have the same metatype (, which is also its own metatype), this is not a requirement. The type of classic classes, known as , can also be considered a distinct metatype. >>> a = 0 >>> type(a) >>> type(type(a)) >>> type(type(type(a))) >>> type(type(type(type(a)))) =Java= In Java, is-a relation between the type parameters of one class or interface and the type parameters of another are determined by the extends and implements clauses. Using the Collections classes, ArrayList implements List, and List extends Collection. So ArrayList is a subtype of List, which is a subtype of Collection. The subtyping relationship is preserved between the types automatically. When defining an interface, PayloadList, that associates an optional value of generic type P with each element, its declaration might look like: interface PayloadList extends List { void setPayload(int index, P val); ... } The following parameterizations of PayloadList are subtypes of List: PayloadList PayloadList PayloadList Liskov substitution principle Liskov substitution principle explains a property, \\"If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T,\\". Following example shows a violation of LSP. void DrawShape(const Shape& s) { if (typeid(s)  typeid(Square)) DrawSquare(static_cast(s)); else if (typeid(s)  typeid(Circle)) DrawCircle(static_cast(s)); } Obviously, the DrawShape function is badly formatted. It has to know about every derivative classes of Shape class. Also, it should be changed whenever new subclass of Shape are created. In object-oriented design, many view the structure of this as anathema. Here is a more subtle example of violation of LSP: class Rectangle { public: void SetWidth(double w) { itsWidth = w; } void SetHeight(double h) { itsHeight = h; } double GetHeight() const { return itsHeight; } double GetWidth() const { return itsWidth; } private: double itsWidth; double itsHeight; }; This works well but when it comes to Square class, which inherits Rectangle class, it violates LSP even though the is-a relationship holds between Rectangle and Square. Because square is rectangular. The following example overrides two functions, Setwidth and SetHeight, to fix the problem. But fixing the code implies that the design is faulty. public class Square : Rectangle { public: virtual void SetWidth(double w); virtual void SetHeight(double h); }; void Square::SetWidth(double w) { Rectangle::SetWidth(w); Rectangle::SetHeight(w); } void Square::SetHeight(double h) { Rectangle::SetHeight(h); Rectangle::SetWidth(h); } The following example, function g just works for Rectangle class but not for Square, and so the open-closed principle has been violated. void g(Rectangle& r) { r.SetWidth(5); r.SetHeight(4); assert(r.GetWidth() * r.GetHeight())  20); } See also * Inheritance (object-oriented programming) * Liskov substitution principle (in object- oriented programming) * Subsumption * Is-a ** Hypernymy (and supertype) ** Hyponymy (and subtype) * Has-a ** Holonymy ** Meronymy Notes References * Ronald J.

He served as Vice President of Liberia under President Charles Taylor and became the 23rd President of Liberia on 11 August 2003, following Taylor's resignation. He served as President for two months, until 14 October 2003, when a United Nations-backed transitional government, headed by Gyude Bryant, was sworn in. Career Blah was born in Toweh Town, Liberia, a Gio-speaking hamlet in north-eastern Nimba County, close to the border with the Ivory Coast. He joined with Taylor because of a shared hatred of President Samuel Doe, who had killed Blah's wife along with hundreds of others in an ethnic- related massacre. He trained with Taylor in a Libyan guerrilla camp and served with him as a general during Liberia's civil war in the 1990s. He held the post of ambassador to Libya and Tunisia after Taylor was elected in 1997. In July 2000 Blah was appointed as Vice President after the death of Enoch Dogolea who was rumoured to have been poisoned. Blah was known as a quiet and unassuming man, driving his own jeep around town rather than using a motorcade and driver, and wearing flowing African robes instead of the normal olive green military uniform. He was constantly annoyed by the presence of bodyguards following him around. In June 2003, Taylor had left the country for peace talks in Ghana, and while there he was indicted by the war crimes tribunal in Sierra Leone. Blah was urged by the United States to take power from Taylor during his absence, but Blah made no such attempt. After Taylor's return, Blah was held under house arrest for ten days, but was subsequently absolved and reinstated as Vice President. When Taylor resigned in August of that year, Blah briefly succeeded him as president. He was condemned by Liberian rebel groups for his close ties to Taylor; they charged that he would simply continue Taylor's practices. Blah responded by calling the rebels \\"brothers\\" and saying \\"Let bygones be bygones. If there is power, we can share it.\\" He invited the rebels to negotiate in his own house. On 7 April 2008, Blah said that he had been sent a subpoena to testify at Taylor's trial before the Special Court for Sierra Leone in The Hague. He said that he would testify and \\"speak the truth\\",\\"Former Liberian vice-president says he will testify in Taylor trial\\" , AFP, 7 April 2008. and he testified on 14 May 2008, describing child soldiers and the relationship between Taylor and Foday Sankoh.\\"Charles Taylor's former deputy testifies\\" , Reuters (Mail & Guardian Online), 14 May 2008. On February 1, 2009, Blah was accused of taking part in the murder of RUF commander Sam Bockarie, by a witness narrative to the commissioners of Liberia‚Äôs Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). The witness, a senior commander of the defunct Anti-Terrorist Unit (ATU) of exiled President Charles Taylor, claimed Vice president Blah was part of the conspiracy and participated in the killing of Bockarie in the town of Tiaplay in Nimba County. Blah died early on 1 April 2013, two weeks and three days before his 66th birthday, at the John F. Kennedy Hospital in Monrovia. Personal life Originally trained as a mechanic, Blah was fluent in German, French and Arabic. He had many children by his wife Nettie, and many grandchildren.

In her later years she married count Philippe Antoine d'Ornano, an influential Napoleonic officer. Early life Residence in Walewice Maria was born into a wealthy noble family in Kiernozia, to Count Mathieu (Mateusz) ≈ÅƒÖczy≈Ñski, a landowner and starosta of Gosty≈Ñ; and Eva Zaborowska, whose family was wealthy. Maria had six siblings: Benedykt Jozef, Hieronim, Teodor, Honorata, Katarzyna and Urszula-Teresa.Adam Mauersberg, Maria Walewska, Ateneum, Warsaw 1938 She grew up in her ancestral home, Kiernozia, where she also received her education. Nicholas Chopin, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin's father, was one of her tutors. In 1794 Mathieu participated (and was mortally wounded) in the Battle of Maciejowice, a year before the final partition of Poland, when the ≈ÅƒÖczy≈Ñski lands were incorporated into Russia, leaving behind a widow, seven children (five of them surviving into adulthood), and a dwindling livelihood. In 1805 she married Athenasius count Colonna-Walewski, starosta of Warka district and a once- chamberlain to the last Polish king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski. Walewski was a wealthy landowner, but was four times older than his young bride. Maria and Athenasius had one son, Antoni Rudolf Bazyli Colonna-Walewski, although it is believed by some historians that he was an illegitimate child, conceived shortly before Maria's marriage.The troubles with Lady Walewska, Marian Brandys, Iskry, Warsaw, 1971. Affair with Napoleon Marie Walewska Maria met Napoleon for the first time in 1806 in B≈Çonie, or in Jab≈Çonna.The exact location still provokes disputes among historians. Frederic Masson published extracts from Walewska's personal diaries in which she claimed to have met Bonaparte in B≈Çonie. However, Marian Brandys suggested that it is more likely that the encounter in fact took place in Jab≈Çonna, as Napoleon's arrival to B≈Çonie was not anticipated, and Walewska insisted in her memoir that she set out from Walewice expecting to meet the French emperor. According to Maria's own memoirs, she spoke briefly with the French emperor, but the meeting was inconclusive. However, Napoleon remembered her for her extraordinary beauty and requested to see her in Warsaw, intending to start an affair with her. They met again at a ball hosted by count Stanislaw Potocki in his Warsaw residence. Although Maria was initially reluctant to become Napoleon's mistress, she was convinced to do so by the Emperor's aide, General G√©raud Duroc (Grand Marshal of the Palace) and a number of Polish aristocrats, who hoped that she could influence the emperor to support Poland in its struggle to regain independence from Prussia, the Habsburg Empire and the Russian Empire. In her memoirs, Maria maintained that she forced herself to get involved with Napoleon for purely patriotic reasons: > \\"The sacrifice was complete. It was all about harvesting fruit now, > achieving this one single equivalence [convincing Napoleon to support Polish > independence movement], which could excuse my debased position. This was the > thought that possessed me. Ruling over my will it did not allow me to fall > under the weight of my bad consciousness and sadness.\\"Frederic Masson \\"Marie > Walewska\\", E. Guillaume, Paris 1897. The affair was initially kept secret, even though unofficially it was one of the most widely commented news in Warsaw's higher circles. Walewska visited Napoleon, residing in the capital's Royal Castle, only at nights and would secretly leave the building each morning. The relationship progressed when Napoleon moved to his field headquarters in Finckenstein Palace in East Prussia (now Kamieniec Suski, Poland): Maria followed him there and they moved into neighbouring apartments. As Maria was extraordinarily pious for her times, they still maintained apparent secrecy: she refused to leave the part of the building in which they lived, fearing being seen by officers surrounding Napoleon, many of whom were her acquaintances or relatives.Marian Kukiel, The fairytale life of Maria Walewska, Warsaw 1939 In 1809 Maria followed Napoleon during his journey to Vienna, where she lived in a house near Sch√∂nbrunn Palace, Napoleon's residence. During her sojourn in Vienna she became pregnant and returned to Walewice in order to give birth to her second son, Alexandre Joseph. Although Alexandre was unquestionably a product of Maria's affair with the Emperor, he was officially recognised by the old count Athenasius as his son and thus bore the name of the counts of Colonna- Walewski. In 1810 Napoleon returned to Paris, where he was soon joined by Maria. She settled in a palatial residence in the Rue de Montmorency and was given a large rent of 120 000 francs and a permission to enter all of the imperial museums, but her previous relationship with Napoleon ended. The Emperor planned to divorce Josephine and instead marry Marie Louise, daughter of the Austrian Emperor, and maintaining an affair with another woman seemed inappropriate. Her and her son's future were nevertheless assured by the grant of large land estates in the Kingdom of Naples. Later years Philippe Antoine d'Ornano In 1812 Maria divorced count Colonna-Walewski. To facilitate it, her brother, Benedykt Jozef, admitted to forcing the marriage upon her. It remains unclear whether this was the truth, as in her memoirs Maria stated that her mother influenced her choice to marry Athenasius, possibly due to an illegitimate pregnancy. As a settlement, she and her oldest son received half of count Walewski's estates, which even though heavily indebted, represented considerable wealth. In 1816 Maria married her longtime admirer and lover, Philippe Antoine d'Ornano, count d'Ornano. They settled in Liege, as d'Ornano did not want to return to Paris due to his pro-Napoleonic allegiances. In 1817 Maria gave birth to count d'Ornano's son, Rudolph Augustus, and she died in Paris shortly afterwards due to a prolonged kidney illness. Before her death, she completed her memoirs, which were addressed to her husband. Upon request from her Polish relatives her body was exhumed from P√®re Lachaise Cemetery in Paris and moved to her family crypt in Kiernozia. Descendants Maria Walewska left three sons: * Her son from the first marriage, count Antoni Colonna-Walewski, settled in Poland and little is known about his life. * Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski (4 May 1810 ‚Äì 27 October 1868), her son from her relationship with Napoleon I became an important figure in the 19th century French politics: he was an influential diplomat and a cabinet minister. He maintained his whole life that his father was Count Colonna- Walewski. * Her third son, Rodolphe d'Ornano, was also an influential figure in the French society; his descendants created the well-known fragrance and cosmetics brand Sisley. Marie Walewska also had a niece, named Barth, who lived in Bergen, Norway. The Walewska family thus has descendants in Norway living today. Legacy Maria's eventful life immediately attracted attention of a number of Polish and French historians. As her memoirs remained unpublished until the late 19th century, she was a subject of much speculation. The first scholar to write a complete account of her life was a French biographer Frederic Masson, who was allowed by d'Ornano family to use her memoirs. In the 1930s her adventures were once again described by her descendant, Antoine Philippe Rodolphe, 4th count d'Ornano in a book entitled 'Marie Walewska, \\"l'ƒópouse polonaise de Napolƒóon\\"'. It was a belletristic biography that until the mid-20th century was considered as a key source on Walewska, as Antoine d'Ornano claimed that it was based on never published documents remaining in the archives of La Branchoire, the family castle. Count d'Ornano's account presented Maria as a devout patriot and an influential political figure. His book claimed that she was involved in taking major political decisions related to the development of Duchy of Warsaw and engaged herself in disputes with figures such as J√≥zef Poniatowski or Joachim Lelewel. These allegations immediately spurred controversy among Polish historians, who noticed that both the described events and the dates quoted by d'Ornano seemed unlikely. Biographer Marian Brandys attempted to deal with some of these doubts in his book \\"The troubles with Lady Walewska\\" and he went as far as questioning the very existence of documents from La Branchoire. His main argument was that the facts presented in the book were unrealistic in light of broader historical knowledge about Napoleonic campaigns and the politics of the Duchy of Warsaw. He also noted the numerous discrepancies between the French and English editions of the book. D'Ornano's book had an equally profound effect on the historian circles in France. In 1950s Jean Savant, a renowned historian and writer, wrote a book about Walewska in which he attempted to recreate a scientific biography of Maria Walewska. Before publishing the book, he printed certain extracts from it in Elle, a popular woman's magazine, which resulted in a famous lawsuit from count d'Ornano and his descendants. The dispute revolved around copyright issues: Savant allowed the publication of extracts from his work, which included alleged excerpts from Maria's own accounts, taken from d'Ornano's book. However, he failed to appropriately reference them. Antoine d'Ornano sued him for illegally appropriating contents taken from \\"Marie Walewska, \\"l'ƒópouse polonaise de Napolƒóon\\"\\", and when Antoine died, his descendants claimed that the aforementioned extracts were not historical source materials, as Savant claimed, but merely an invention of the author. The legal battle continued for a few years, and it was put to an end by Cour de Cassation which decided that Savant acted legally. The d'Ornano family never allowed any historian to come into contact with the alleged Walewska archives. During the lawsuit they maintained that in fact, the documents never existed. However, Savant in his next book \\"l'Affaire Walewska\\" attempted to prove the contrary.Jean Savant, M√©moire en d√©fense pour Jean Savant, dans l'\\"Affaire Marie Walewska\\", proc√®s Ornano-Jean Savant. Marie Walewska in popular culture Walewska was the subject of the 1914 Polish film Countess Walewska, directed by Aleksander Hertz. Her story is told in a 1937 film Conquest, also known as Marie Walewska. Greta Garbo plays Marie Walewska to Charles Boyer's Napoleon. Boyer and art director Cedric Gibbons were both nominated for Academy Awards for the film. The character also appeared in A Soldier's Farewell, an episode of the BBC comedy Dad's Army. She was played by Alexandra Lara in the 2002 Napol√©on miniseries. In 2017, the Family Coppola released a vodka named after Walewska.

Hobab is also the name of Jethro's son in . =Moses marries Zipporah= While the Israelites/Hebrews were captives in Egypt, Moses killed an Egyptian who was striking a Hebrew, for which offense Pharaoh sought to kill Moses. Moses therefore fled from Egypt and arrived in Midian. One day while he sat by a well, Reuel's daughters came to water their father's flocks. Other shepherds arrived and drove the girls away so they could water their own flocks first. Moses defended the girls and watered their flocks. Upon their return home their father asked them, \\"How is it that you have come home so early today?\\" The girls answered, \\"An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds; he even drew water for us and watered the flock.\\" \\"Where is he then?\\" Reuel asked them. \\"Why did you leave the man? Invite him for supper to break bread.\\" Reuel then gave Moses Zipporah as his wife (). =Incident at the Inn= After God commanded Moses to return to Egypt to free the Israelites, Moses took his wife and sons and started his journey. On the road, they stayed in an inn, where God came to kill Moses. Zipporah quickly circumcised her son with a sharp stone and touched Moses' feet with the foreskin, saying \\"Surely you are a husband of blood to me!\\" God then left Moses alone (). The details of the passage are unclear and subject to debate. =The Exodus= Miriam and Aaron complain against Moses, engraving from 1908 After Moses succeeded in taking the Israelites out of Egypt, and won a battle against Amalek, Reuel came to the Hebrew camp in the wilderness of Sinai, bringing with him Zipporah and their two sons, Gershom and Eliezer. The Bible does not say when Zipporah and her sons rejoined Reuel/Jethro, only that after he heard of what God did for the Israelites, he brought Moses' family to him. The most common translation is that Moses sent her away, but another grammatically permissible translation is that she sent things or persons, perhaps the announcement of the victory over Amalek.See e.g. Ibn Ezra on Exodus 18:2 - ◊ï◊®◊≥ ◊ô◊©◊ï◊¢◊î ◊ê◊û◊®: ◊©◊©◊ú◊ï◊ó◊ô◊î ◊î◊ï◊ê ◊ì◊ï◊®◊ï◊ü ◊ï◊û◊†◊ó◊î, ◊õ◊û◊ï: ◊©◊ú◊ï◊ó◊ô◊ù ◊ú◊ë◊™◊ï (◊û◊ú◊õ◊ô◊ù ◊ê ◊ò◊≥:◊ò◊¥◊ñ). ◊ï◊î◊ò◊¢◊ù: ◊ê◊ó◊® ◊©◊ô◊í◊®◊î ◊ì◊®◊ï◊†◊î ◊ï◊ñ◊î ◊ß◊®◊ï◊ë ◊ê◊ú◊ô.

Jacob Jordaens, c. 1650 Moses' wife is referred to as a Cushite in . Interpretations differ on whether this Cushite wife was one and the same as Zipporah, or another woman, and whether he was married to them simultaneously (which would make him a polygamist) or successively.Brent MacDonald, Who was Moses' wife? A Midianite, a Cushite, or both?, 2015 at NotJustAnotherBook.com, accessed 13 August 2018Dr. Elad Filler, Moses and the Kushite Woman: Classic Interpretations and Philo's Allegory, at TheTorah.com: A Historical and Contextual Approach, accessed 13 August 2018Shlomo Skinner, The Mystery of the Cushite Woman, at Thinking Torah, accessed 13 August 2018 In the story Aaron and Miriam harshly criticize Moses' marriage to a Cushite or Kushite woman after he returned to Egypt to set the children of Israel free. Cushites were of the ancestry of either Kush (a.k.a. Nubia) in northeast Africa, or Arabians. The sons of Ham, mentioned within the Book of Genesis, have been identified with nations in Africa (Ethiopia, Egypt, Libya), the Levant (Canaan), and Arabia. The Midianites themselves were later on depicted at times in non-Biblical sources as dark-skinned and called Kushim, a Hebrew word used for dark-skinned Africans.David M. Goldenberg. The curse of Ham: race and slavery in early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, chapter 8. p. 124.Isra√´l Shahak. Jewish history, Jewish religion: the weight of three thousand years. p. 25 One interpretation is that the wife is Zipporah and that she was referred to as a Cushite though she was a Midianite, because of her beauty. The Samaritan Pentateuch text refers to Moses' wife Zipporah as \\"Kaashet\\" (which translates to \\"the beautiful woman\\"), rather than \\"Cushit\\" (\\"black woman\\" or \\"Cushite woman\\"). Therefore, the Samaritan sages came to the understanding that Moses married only one wife, and once he became absolutely devoted to his prophetic mission he never got married again.Tsedaka, Benyamim, and Sharon Sullivan, eds. The Israelite Samaritan Version of the Torah: First English Translation Compared with the Masoretic Version. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013. =Family tree= In Druze religion In the Druze religion, Jethro is revered as the spiritual founder, chief prophet, and ancestor of all Druze. Moses was allowed to wed Zipporah, the daughter of Jethro, after helping save his daughters and their flock from competing herdsmen. It has been expressed by prominent Druze such as Amal Nasser el-Din and Salman Tarif, who was a prominent Druze shaykh, that this makes the Druze related to the Jews through marriage. This view has been used to represent an element of the special relationship between Israeli Jews and Druze. In fiction Zipporah is often included in Exodus-related drama. Examples include the films The Ten Commandments (1956), The Prince of Egypt (1998) and Exodus: Gods and Kings (2014). She is the main character in Marek Halter's novel Zipporah, Wife of Moses (2005).

It is formed by the Parliament of Catalonia, the Presidency of the Generalitat de Catalunya, and the Executive Council of Catalonia (also very often referred to as \\"Govern\\", which means Government, but can not take decisions alone) Its origins are in the 13th century when permanent councils were created to rule administration of the Courts of the different territories and Kingdoms that formed the Crown of Aragon which gave birth to the General Council of the Principality of Catalonia (1359), the General Council of the Kingdom of Aragon (1362) and the General Council of the Kingdom of Valencia (1412). Its headquarters are at the Palau de la Generalitat, in the city of Barcelona. History The Generalitat of Catalonia finds its origins in the Catalan Courts, as during the reign of James I the Conqueror (1208-1276) they reunited and were convoked by the king, as representatives of the social statements of the time. Under the reign of Peter the Great (1276-1285), the Catalan Courts gained institutional status, after the king obliged himself to celebrate an annual \\"General Court\\". The Catalan Courts exercised as Council and had legislative functions through its three branches: the ecclesiastical (clergy), the military (nobility) and the popular (villages and towns submitted to direct rule of the king). This union of powers was named \\"Lo General de Cathalunya\\" Is in 1289 when the first step into becoming an institution happens during the Courts celebrated in the castle of Monts√≥ (situated in the Kingdom of Aragon, ruled by Count of Barcelona, since the year 1151 AD when Count Ramon Berenguer IV married Princess Petronilla of AragonPetronilla of Aragon). A commission was then designed as \\"Diputaci√≥ del General\\" (General Deputation), as to temporarily collect the \\"services\\" or tributes that the \\"branches\\" granted the king on his demand. This tax was popularly known as \\"Drets Generals\\" (General Rights) or \\"generalitats\\" (generalities), finding its counterpart in the French \\"G√©n√©ralit√©s\\", which were also founded as taxing districts. = Medieval origins = Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya, Barcelona, seat of the Government and the Presidency of Catalonia Old emblem of the Generalitat. Catalonia's political past as a territorially differentiated community with its own representative and separated institutions, with respect to the sovereign power of the combined Catalan counties (988-1164), the Crown of Aragon (1164-1516), the Monarchy of Spain (1516-1808),(1812-1814) French Empire and of the Spanish constitutional state (since 1814), can be divided into four stages, separated by three great ruptures in the legal/public order. The Pau i Treva de D√©u (\\"Peace and Truce of God\\") was a social movement born in the eleventh century promoted by the Church, united with the peasantry as the response to the violence perpetrated by feudal nobles. The hometowns, then, delimited a space protected of feudal violence. However, to ensure a coexistence climate, it was necessary to go further, establishing an authority that prohibited the practice of any type of violent act anywhere in the territory. This was the objective of the assemblies of Peace and Truce of God, the first of which, in the Catalan counties, took place in Toluges (Roussillon), in 1027, under the presidency of Abbot Oliba, on behalf of Bishop Berenguer d'Elna, absent from the diocese because he was on a pilgrimage. The origin of the Catalan Courts can be considered from the Peace of Truce of God. The Generalitat of Catalonia stems from the medieval institution which ruled, in the name of the King of the Crown of Aragon, some aspects of the administration of the Principality of Catalonia. The Catalan Courts were the main institution of the Principality during its existence as a political entity and approved the Catalan constitutions. The first constitutions were that of the Courts of 1283. The medieval precedent of the Generalitat, the Diputaci√≥ del General de Catalunya (\\"Deputation of the General of Catalonia\\", where \\"General\\" means the political community of the Catalans and not the military rank) was a permanent council of deputies established by the Courts in order to recapt the new \\"tax of the General\\" in 1359, and gained an important political power during the next centuries, assuming tasks of prosecutor. It was chosen by the legislators in 1931 because they felt it was appropriate for invoking as a legitimising base for contemporary self-government. =First abolition= Catalan institutions which depended on the Generalitat were abolished in what is currently known in Catalonia as Northern Catalonia, one year after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees in the 17th century, which transferred the territory from Spanish to French sovereignty. Then, by the early 18th century, as the \\"Nueva Planta Decrees\\" were passed in Spain after the Catalan defeat in the War of the Spanish Succession, the institution was abolished in the Spanish territory as well. =First restoration= The Generalitat was restored in the Catalonia under Spanish administration in 1931 during the events of the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic when Francesc Maci√†, leader of the Republican Left of Catalonia, declared the Catalan Republic on 14 April but later reached an agreement with the Spanish ministers, in which the Catalan Republic was renamed Generalitat of Catalonia (Catalan: Generalitat de Catalunya) and given its modern political and representative function as the autonomous government of Catalonia within the Spanish Republic.Carr, Raymond. Modern Spain: 1975-1980. Oxford University Press, 1980, p.xvi. The restored Generalitat was ruled by a statute of autonomy approved by the Spanish Cortes and included a parliament, a presidency, a government and a court of appeal. It was presided by Francesc Maci√† (1931-1933) and Llu√≠s Companys (1933-1940). After the right wing coalition won the Spanish elections in 1934, the leftist leaders of the Generalitat of Catalonia rebelled in October of that year against the Spanish authorities, and it was temporarily suspended from 1934 to 1936. =Second abolition= Bank note from the Generalitat de Catalunya, 1936 In 1939, as the Spanish Civil War finished with the defeat of the Republican side, the Generalitat of Catalonia as an institution was abolished and remained so during the Francoist dictatorship until 1975. The president of the Generalitat at the time, Llu√≠s Companys, was tortured and executed in October 1940 for the crime of 'military rebellion'. Nonetheless, the Generalitat maintained its official existence in exile, led by presidents Josep Irla (1940-1954) and Josep Tarradellas (1954-1980). =Second restoration= The succession of presidents of the Generalitat was maintained in exile from 1939 to 1977, when Josep Tarradellas returned to Catalonia and was recognized as the legitimate president by the Spanish government. Tarradellas, when he returned to Catalonia, made his often quoted remark \\"Ciutadans de Catalunya: ja s√≥c aqu√≠\\" (\\"Citizens of Catalonia: I am back!\\"), reassuming the autonomous powers of Catalonia, one of the historic nationalities of present-day Spain. After this, the powers given to the autonomous Catalan government according to the Spanish Constitution of 1978 were transferred and the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia (Estatut d'Autonomia) was passed after being approved both by referendum in Catalonia and by the Spanish parliament.  Recent history  = Governance since 2006 = Artur Mas held the office of President of the Generalitat from December 2010 until his resignation in January 2016, leading a minority government dependent on pacts with other parties including the Socialists' Party of Catalonia following the 2010 election and the 2015 election. Jos√© Montilla, leader of the Socialist Party, had been the president of the Generalitat until November 2010, he was backed up by a tripartite coalition of left-wing and Catalan nationalist political parties. His party actually won fewer seats in parliament than the main opposition party, Convergence and Union, in the 2006 election, but as he gathered more support from MPs from other parties in the parliament, he was able to repeat the same coalition government that his predecessor (Pasqual Maragall) had formed in order to send CiU to the opposition for the first time after 23 years of Jordi Pujol's government. On 18 June 2006, a reformed version was approved of the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia and went into effect in August. In its inception, the reform was promoted by both the leftist parties in the government and by the main opposition party (CiU), which were united in pushing for increased devolution of powers from the Spanish government level, enhanced fiscal autonomy and finances, and explicit recognition of Catalonia's national identity; however the details of its final redaction were harshly fought and the subject became a controversial issue in the Catalan politics, with ERC, themselves members of the Tripartite, finally opposing it. In 2010, the Spanish Constitutional Court reduced the Statute voted in a referendum, eliminating or reinterpreting more than 200 articles, due to a signature collection promoted by then the Spanish opposition leader, Mariano Rajoy. Tis is considered one of the main reasons for the independence boom that happened from 2010 with 8% support to 2018 with 52.4% Support. Former president Artur Mas (mentioned above) was recently charged by the Spanish government for civil disobedience, after he organised and staged a referendum on independence in 2014. = Current status = The most recent President of the Generalitat of Catalonia was Carles Puigdemont, member of the Catalan European Democratic Party, successor formation to the defunct Convergence and Union alliance. He was suspended from office on 27 October 2017, by the Spanish government.Real Decreto 942/2017, de 27 de octubre, por el que se dispone, en virtud de las medidas autorizadas con fecha 27 de octubre de 2017 por el Pleno del Senado respecto de la Generalitat de Catalu√±a en aplicaci√≥n del art√≠culo 155 de la Constituci√≥n, el cese del M.H.

Boletin Oficial del Estado n√∫m. 261, de 28 de octubre de 2017, p√°ginas 103562 a 103563 After a number of attempts to invest a new president, Quim Torra became president on the 17th of May 2018, with Together for Catalonia and Republican Left of Catalonia voting in favour of him. Autonomous system of government The autonomous government consists of the Executive Council, the President and the Parliament. Some people wrongly apply this name only to the executive council (the cabinet of the autonomous government); however, Generalitat de Catalunya is the system of Catalan autonomous government as a whole. The region has gradually achieved a greater degree of autonomy since 1979. After Navarre and the Basque Country regions, Catalonia has the greatest level of self-government in Spain. When it is fully instated, the Generalitat holds exclusive and wide jurisdiction in various matters of culture, environment, communications, transportation, commerce, public safety and local governments. In many aspects relating to education, health and justice, the region shares jurisdiction with the Spanish government. One of the examples of Catalonia's degree of autonomy is its own police force, the Mossos d'Esquadra (\\"Troopers\\"), which has taken over most of the police functions in Catalonia which used to be served by the Civil Guard (Guardia Civil) and the Spanish National Police Corps. With few exceptions, most of the justice system is administered by national judicial institutions. The legal system is uniform throughout the Spanish state, with the exception of some parts of civil law ‚Äì especially family, inheritance, and real estate law ‚Äì that have traditionally been ruled by so-called foral law. The fields of civil law that are subject to autonomous legislation have been codified in the Civil Code of Catalonia (Codi civil de Catalunya) consisting of six books that have successively entered into force since 2003. Another institution stemming from the Catalan autonomy statute, but independent from the Generalitat in its check and balance functions, is the S√≠ndic de Greuges (ombudsman) to address problems that may arise between private citizens or organizations and the Generalitat or local governments. = Legislature = Parliament of Catalonia, located in Ciutadella park, Barcelona The Parliament of Catalonia (in Catalan: Parlament de Catalunya) is the legislative body of the Generalitat and represents the citizens of Catalonia. It is elected every four years by universal suffrage, and it has powers to legislate in different matters such as education, health, culture, internal institutional and territorial organization, election and control of the president of the Generalitat and the Government, budget and others, according with the Statute of Autonomy. The last Catalan election was held on 21 December 2017, and its current president is Roger Torrent, incumbent since January 2018. = Presidency = The president of the Generalitat of Catalonia (in Catalan: president de la Generalitat de Catalunya) is the highest representative of Catalonia, and is also responsible of leading the government's action. Since the restoration of the Generalitat on the return of democracy in Spain, the presidents of Catalonia have been Josep Tarradellas (1977‚Äì1980, president in exile since 1954), Jordi Pujol (1980‚Äì2003), Pasqual Maragall (2003‚Äì2006), Jos√© Montilla (2006‚Äì2010), Artur Mas (2010‚Äì2016), Carles Puigdemont (2016-2017) and, after the imposition of direct rule from Madrid, Quim Torra (2018‚Äì). = Executive = Executive Council of Catalonia (2018‚Äì). Quim Torra, President of the Generalitat, is located at the centre The Executive Council (in Catalan: Consell Executiu) or Government (Govern), is the body responsible of the government of the Generalitat, it holds executive and regulatory power. It comprises the president of the Generalitat, the First Minister (or the Vice President) and the Ministers (consellers). Its seat is the Palau de la Generalitat, in Barcelona. International presence As an autonomous community of Spain, Catalonia is not recognized as a sovereign state by any sovereign state. However, as Catalonia has progressively gained a greater degree of self-government in recent years, the Catalan Government has established nearly bilateral relationships with foreign bodies. For the most part, these relationships are with the governments of other powerful subnational entities such as Quebechttp://www.mdeie.gouv.qc.ca/index.php?id=4201 or California. In addition, like most Spanish autonomous communities, Catalonia has permanent delegations before international organizations, such as the European Union.http://www.copca.cat/infoglueDeliverLive/ViewPage.action?siteNodeId=247&languageId;=1&contentId;=-1 More recently, Catalonia has embarked upon an expansion process of its international representation by opening a number of delegations worldwide. As of 2017, these exceeded 40. Most of these offices are located in major world cities like London, New York City, Los Angeles, Paris, Tokyo and others. Each office has specific duties assigned by their ministry or department agency. Generally, the functions of these are the representation of specific interests of the Government of Catalonia, trade and foreign investment, Catalan culture and language support, tourist promotion and international cooperation activities. There are no specific Catalan political institutions in Northern Catalonia, other than the French d√©partement of Pyr√©n√©es-Orientales. However, since 5 September 2003, there has been a Casa de la Generalitat in Perpignan, which aims to promote the Catalan culture and facilitate exchanges between each side of the Franco‚ÄìSpanish border.

Originally \\"van Dijck\\", with the \\"IJ\\" digraph, in Dutch. Anthony is the English for the Dutch Anthonis or Antoon, though Anthonie, Antonio or Anthonio was also used; in French he is often Antoine, in Italian Anthonio or Antonio. In English a capitalised \\"Van\\" in Van Dyck was more usual until recent decades (used by Waterhouse for example), and \\"Dyke\\" was often used during his lifetime and later (and is usual for the beard style). 22 March 1599 ‚Äì 9 December 1641) was a Flemish Baroque artist who became the leading court painter in England after success in the Southern Netherlands and Italy. The seventh child of Frans van Dyck, a wealthy Antwerp silk merchant, Anthony painted from an early age. He was successful as an independent painter in his late teens, and became a master in the Antwerp guild in 1618. By this time he was working in the studio of the leading northern painter of the day, Peter Paul Rubens, who became a major influence on his work. Van Dyck worked in London for some months in 1621, then returned to Flanders for a brief time, before travelling to Italy, where he stayed until 1627, mostly in Genoa. In the late 1620s he completed his greatly admired Iconography series of portrait etchings, mostly of other artists. He spent five years in Flanders after his return from Italy, and from 1630 was court painter for the archduchess Isabella, Habsburg Governor of Flanders. In 1632 he returned to London to be the main court painter, at the request of Charles I of England. With the exception of Holbein, van Dyck and his contemporary Diego Vel√°zquez were the first painters of pre-eminent talent to work mainly as court portraitists, revolutionising the genre. He is best known for his portraits of the aristocracy, most notably Charles I, and his family and associates. Van Dyck became the dominant influence on English portrait-painting for the next 150 years. He also painted mythological and biblical subjects, including altarpieces, displayed outstanding facility as a draughtsman, and was an important innovator in watercolour and etching. His superb brushwork, apparently rather quickly painted, can usually be distinguished from the large areas painted by his many assistants. His portrait style changed considerably between the different countries he worked in, culminating in the relaxed elegance of his last English period. His influence extends into the modern period. The Van Dyke beard is named after him. During his lifetime, Charles I granted him a knighthood, and he was buried in St Paul's Cathedral, an indication of his standing at the time of his death. Life and work Self-portrait, 1613‚Äì14 =Education= Antoon van Dyck (his Flemish name) was born to prosperous parents in Antwerp. His father was Frans van Dyck, a silk merchant, and his mother was Maria Cupers, daughter of Dirk Cupers and Catharina Conincx. He was baptised on 23 March 1599 (as Anthonio).Antwerp, S.A.A., Parochieregisters, Doopakten, 30/03/1592 - 26/06/1606, fol. 147, 23-03-1599 Anthonio Van Dijck, retrieved by the Jordaens Van Dyck Panel Paintings Project (www.jordaensvandyck.org) on 06/04/2017. His talent was evident very early, and he was studying painting with Hendrick van Balen by 1609, and became an independent painter around 1615, setting up a workshop with his even younger friend Jan Brueghel the Younger.Brown, p. 15. By the age of fifteen he was already a highly accomplished artist, as his Self-portrait, 1613‚Äì14, shows.Vlieghe, Hans. Flemish Art and Architecture, 1585‚Äì1700, Yale University Press, 2004, p. 124. He was admitted to the Antwerp painters' Guild of Saint Luke as a free master by February 1618.Martin, Gregory. The Flemish School, 1600-1900, National Gallery Catalogues, p. 26, 1970, National Gallery, London, Within a few years he was to be the chief assistant to the dominant master of Antwerp, and the whole of Northern Europe, Peter Paul Rubens, who made much use of sub-contracted artists as well as his own large workshop. His influence on the young artist was immense. Rubens referred to the nineteen-year-old van Dyck as \\"the best of my pupils\\".Brown, p. 17. The origins and exact nature of their relationship are unclear. It has been speculated that van Dyck was a pupil of Rubens from about 1613, as even his early work shows little trace of van Balen's style, but there is no clear evidence for this.Ellis Waterhouse, Painting in Britain, 1530-1790, 4th Edn, 1978, pp. 70-77, Penguin Books (now Yale History of Art series) At the same time the dominance of Rubens in the relatively small and declining city of Antwerp probably explains why, despite his periodic returns to the city, van Dyck spent most of his career abroad. In 1620, in Rubens's contract for the major commission for the ceiling of the Carolus Borromeuskerk, the Jesuit church at Antwerp (lost to fire in 1718), van Dyck is specified as one of the \\"discipelen\\" who was to execute the paintings to Rubens' designs.Martin, op and page cit. Unlike van Dyck, Rubens worked for most of the courts of Europe, but avoided exclusive attachment to any of them. =Italy= Genoan hauteur from the Lomellini family, 1623 In 1620, at the instigation of George Villiers, Marquess of Buckingham, van Dyck went to England for the first time where he worked for King James I of England, receiving ¬£100. It was in London in the collection of the Earl of Arundel that he first saw the work of Titian, whose use of colour and subtle modeling of form would prove transformational, offering a new stylistic language that would enrich the compositional lessons learned from Rubens.Brown, page 19. He returned to Flanders after about four months, and then left in late 1621 for Italy, where he remained for six years. There he studied the Italian masters while starting a successful career as a portraitist. He was already presenting himself as a figure of consequence, annoying the rather bohemian Northern artist's colony in Rome, says Giovan Pietro Bellori, by appearing with \\"the pomp of Zeuxis ... his behaviour was that of a nobleman rather than an ordinary person, and he shone in rich garments. Since he was accustomed in the circle of Rubens to noblemen, and being naturally of elevated mind, and anxious to make himself distinguished, he therefore wore‚Äîas well as silks‚Äîa hat with feathers and brooches, gold chains across his chest, and was accompanied by servants.\\"Levey, Michael, Painting at Court, Weidenfeld & Nicolson, London, 1971, pp. 124-5 Anthony van Dyck, by Peter Paul Rubens (1627‚Äì28) He was mostly based in Genoa, although he also travelled extensively to other cities, and stayed for some time in Palermo in Sicily, where he was quarantined during the 1624 plague, one of the worst in Sicily's history. There he produced an important series of paintings of the city's plague saint Saint Rosalia. His depictions of a young woman with flowing blonde hair wearing a Franciscan cowl and reaching down toward the city of Palermo in its peril, became the standard iconography of the saint from that time onward and was extremely influential for Italian Baroque painters, from Luca Giordano to Pietro Novelli. Versions include those in Madrid, Houston, London, New York and Palermo, as well as Saint Rosalia Interceding for the City of Palermo in Puerto Rico, and Coronation of Saint Rosalia in Vienna. Van Dyck's series of St Rosalia paintings have been studied by Gauvin Alexander Bailey and Xavier F. Salomon, both of whom curated or co-curated exhibitions devoted to the theme of Italian art and the plague.https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/29/arts/design/desperately-painting- the- plague.htmlhttps://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA284449813&sid;=googleScholar&v;=2.1‚Å¢=r&linkaccess;=abs&issn;=00036536&p;=AONE&sw;=whttps://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/about/exhibitions- archive/exhibitions-archive-by-date/2012-van-dyck-in-sicily/ Recently the New York Times published an article about the Metropolitan Museum of Art's painting of Saint Rosalia by Van Dyck in the context of the Covid-19 virus.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/arts/design/van-dyck-metropolitan- museum-virus.html For the Genoese aristocracy, then in a final flush of prosperity, he developed a full-length portrait style, drawing on Veronese and Titian as well as Rubens' style from his own period in Genoa, where extremely tall but graceful figures look down on the viewer with great hauteur. In 1627, he went back to Antwerp where he remained for five years, painting more affable portraits which still made his Flemish patrons look as stylish as possible. A life-size group portrait of twenty-four City Councillors of Brussels he painted for the council-chamber was destroyed in 1695. He was evidently very charming to his patrons, and, like Rubens, well able to mix in aristocratic and court circles, which added to his ability to obtain commissions. By 1630, he was described as the court painter of the Habsburg Governor of Flanders, the Archduchess Isabella. In this period he also produced many religious works, including large altarpieces, and began his printmaking. =London= Lord John Stuart and his Brother, Lord Bernard Stuart, c. 1638, exemplifies the more intimate, but still elegant style he developed in England King Charles I was the most passionate collector of art among the Stuart kings, and saw painting as a way of promoting his elevated view of the monarchy. In 1628, he bought the fabulous collection that the Duke of Mantua was forced to sell, and he had been trying since his accession in 1625 to bring leading foreign painters to England. In 1626, he was able to persuade Orazio Gentileschi to settle in England, later to be joined by his daughter Artemisia and some of his sons. Rubens was an especial target, who eventually in 1630 came on a diplomatic mission, which included painting, and he later sent Charles more paintings from Antwerp. Rubens was very well- treated during his nine-month visit, during which he was knighted. Charles's court portraitist, Daniel Mytens, was a somewhat pedestrian Dutchman. Charles was very short, less than tall, and presented challenges to a portrait artist. Van Dyck remained in touch with the English court and helped King Charles's agents in their search for pictures. He sent some of his own works, including a self portrait (1623) with Endymion Porter, one of Charles's agents, his Rinaldo and Armida (1629), and a religious picture for the Queen. He had also painted Charles's sister, Queen Elizabeth of Bohemia, at The Hague in 1632. In April of that year, van Dyck returned to London and was taken under the wing of the court immediately, being knighted in July and at the same time receiving a pension of ¬£200 a year, in the grant of which he was described as principalle Paynter in ordinary to their majesties. He was well paid for his paintings in addition to this, at least in theory, as King Charles did not actually pay over his pension for five years, and reduced the price of many paintings. He was provided with a house on the River Thames at Blackfriars, then just outside the City, thus avoiding the monopoly of the Worshipful Company of Painter-Stainers. A suite of rooms in Eltham Palace, no longer used by the royal family, was also put at his disposal as a country retreat. His Blackfriars studio was frequently visited by the King and Queen (later a special causeway was built to ease their access), who hardly sat for another painter while van Dyck lived. Charles I at the Hunt, c. 1635, Louvre He was an immediate success in England, where he painting large numbers of portraits of the King and Queen Henrietta Maria, as well as their children. Many portraits were done in several versions, to be sent as diplomatic gifts or given to supporters of the increasingly embattled king. Altogether van Dyck has been estimated to have painted forty portraits of King Charles himself, as well as about thirty of the Queen, nine of the Earl of Strafford, and multiple ones of other courtiers.Gaunt, William, English Court Painting He painted many of the court, and also himself and his mistress, Margaret Lemon. In England he developed a version of his style which combined a relaxed elegance and ease with an understated authority in his subjects which was to dominate English portrait-painting to the end of the 18th century. Many of these portraits have a lush landscape background. His portraits of Charles on horseback updated the grandeur of Titian's Emperor Charles V, but even more effective and original is his portrait of Charles dismounted in the Louvre: \\"Charles is given a totally natural look of instinctive sovereignty, in a deliberately informal setting where he strolls so negligently that he seems at first glance nature's gentleman rather than England's King\\".Levey p. 128 Although his portraits have created the classic idea of \\"Cavalier\\" style and dress, in fact a majority of his most important patrons in the nobility, such as Lord Wharton and the Earls of Bedford, Northumberland and Pembroke, took the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil War that broke out soon after his death. Christ carrying the Cross The King in Council by letters patent granted van Dyck denizenship in 1638, and he married Mary Ruthven, with whom he had one daughter. Mary was the daughter of Patrick Ruthven, who, although the title was forfeited, styled himself Lord Ruthven.Cokayne, G. E., et al, The Complete Peerage, vol.iv, London, 1916, p. 385n She was a Lady-in-waiting to the Queen in 1639‚Äì40; this may have been instigated by the King in an attempt to keep him in England. He had spent most of 1634 in Antwerp, returning the following year, and in 1640‚Äì41, as the Civil War loomed, spent several months in Flanders and France. In 1640 he accompanied prince John Casimir of Poland after he was freed from French imprisonment. A letter dated 13 August 1641, from Lady Roxburghe in England to a correspondent in The Hague, reported that van Dyck was recuperating from a long illness.Michael Jaff√©. \\"Dyck, Anthony van\\". Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. In November, van Dyck's condition worsened, and he returned to England from Paris, where he had gone to paint Cardinal Richelieu. He died in London on 9 December 1641. There was a memorial to him within the Old St Paul's Cathedral.\\"Memorials of St Paul's Cathedral\\" Sinclair, W. p99: London; Chapman & Hall, Ltd; 1909 Portraits and other works Samson and Delilah, c. 1630, a history painting in the manner of Rubens. The use of saturated colours reveals van Dyck's study of Titian Henrietta Maria and the dwarf, Sir Jeffrey Hudson, 1633 In the 17th century, demand for portraits was stronger than for other types of work. Van Dyck tried to persuade Charles to commission large-scale series on the history of the Order of the Garter for the Banqueting House, Whitehall, for which Rubens had earlier completed the large ceiling paintings (sending them from Antwerp). A sketch for one wall remains, but by 1638 Charles was too short of money to proceed. This was a problem Vel√°zquez did not have, but equally van Dyck's daily life was not encumbered by trivial court duties as faced by Vel√°zquez. In his visits to Paris in his last years, van Dyck attempted to obtain the commission to paint the Grande Gallerie of the Louvre without success.Levey, op cit p. 136 A list of history paintings produced by van Dyck in England survives. It was compiled by van Dyck's biographer Bellori, based on information from Sir Kenelm Digby. None of these works appear to remain, except the Eros and Psyche done for the King (below). But many other works, rather more religious than mythological, do survive, and though they are very fine, they do not reach the heights of Vel√°zquez's history paintings. Earlier ones remain very much within the style of Rubens, although some of his Sicilian works are individualistic. Van Dyck's portraits flattered more than Vel√°zquez's. When Sophia, later Electoress of Hanover, first met Queen Henrietta Maria, in exile in Holland in 1641, she wrote: \\"Van Dyck's handsome portraits had given me so fine an idea of the beauty of all English ladies, that I was surprised to find that the Queen, who looked so fine in painting, was a small woman raised up on her chair, with long skinny arms and teeth like defence works projecting from her mouth...\\" The Cheeke Sisters, a late double portrait Some critics have blamed van Dyck for diverting a nascent, tougher English portrait tradition‚Äîof painters such as William Dobson, Robert Walker and Isaac Fuller‚Äîinto what certainly became elegant blandness in the hands of many of van Dyck's successors, like Lely or Kneller. The conventional view has always been more favourable: \\"When Van Dyck came hither he brought Face- Painting to us; ever since which time ... England has excel'd all the World in that great Branch of the Art\\" (Jonathan Richardson: An Essay on the Theory of Painting, 1715, 41). Thomas Gainsborough is reported to have said on his deathbed \\"We are all going to heaven, and Van Dyck is of the Company.\\" A fairly small number of landscape pen and wash drawings or watercolours made in England played an important part in introducing the Flemish watercolour landscape tradition to England. Some are studies, which reappear in the background of paintings, but many are signed and dated and were probably regarded as finished works to be given as presents. Several of the most detailed are of Rye, a port for ships to the Continent, suggesting that van Dyck did them casually whilst waiting for wind or tide to improve.Royalton- Kisch, Martin. The Light of Nature, Landscape Drawings and Watercolours by Van Dyck and his Contemporaries, British Museum Press, 1999, Printmaking Probably during his period in Antwerp after his return from Italy, van Dyck began his Iconography, which became a very large series of prints with half- length portraits of eminent contemporaries. He produced drawings, and for eighteen of the portraits he himself etched the heads and main outlines of the figure, for an engraver to work up: \\"Portrait etching had scarcely had an existence before his time, and in his work it suddenly appears at the highest point ever reached in the art\\".Arthur M. Hind, A History of Engraving and Etching, p. 165, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1923 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 Pieter Brueghel the Younger from the Iconography; etching by van Dyck He left most of the printmaking to specialists, who engraved after his drawings. His etched plates appear not to have been published until after his death, and early states are very rare.Becker, D. P., in KL Spangeberg (ed), Six Centuries of Master Prints, Cincinnati Art Museum, 1993, no. 72, Most of his plates were printed after only his work had been done. Some exist in further states after engraving had been added, sometimes obscuring his etching. He continued to add to the series until at least his departure for England, and presumably added Inigo Jones whilst in London. The series was a great success, but was his only venture into printmaking; portraiture probably paid better, and he was constantly in demand. At his death there were eighty plates by others, of which fifty-two were of artists, as well as his own eighteen. The plates were bought by a publisher; with the plates reworked periodically as they wore out they continued to be printed for centuries, and the series added to, so that it reached over two hundred portraits by the late 18th century. In 1851, the plates were bought by the Calcographie du Louvre. The Iconography was highly influential as a commercial model for reproductive printmaking; now forgotten series of portrait prints were enormously popular until the advent of photography: \\"the importance of this series was enormous, and it provided a repertory of images that were plundered by portrait painters throughout Europe over the next couple of centuries\\". Van Dyck's brilliant etching style, which depended on open lines and dots, was in marked contrast to that of the other great portraitist in prints of the period, Rembrandt, and had little influence until the 19th century, when it had a great influence on artists such as Whistler in the last major phase of portrait etching. Hyatt Mayor wrote: Studio Van Dyck's success led him to maintain a large workshop in London, which became \\"virtually a production line for portraits\\". According to a visitor he usually only made a drawing on paper, which was then enlarged onto canvas by an assistant; he then painted the head himself. The costume in which the client wished to be painted was left at the studio and often with the unfinished canvas sent out to artists specialised in rendering such clothing. In his last years these studio collaborations accounted for some decline in the quality of work.Brown, pp. 84-6. In addition many copies untouched by him, or virtually so, were produced by the workshop, as well as by professional copyists and later painters. The number of paintings ascribed to him had by the 19th century become huge, as with Rembrandt, Titian and others. However, most of his assistants and copyists could not approach the refinement of his manner, so compared to many masters consensus among art historians on attributions to him is usually relatively easy to reach, and museum labelling is now mostly updated (country house attributions may be more dubious in some cases). The relatively few names of his assistants that are known are Dutch or Flemish. He probably preferred to use trained Flemings, as no equivalent English training existed in this period. Van Dyck's enormous influence on English art does not come from a tradition handed down through his pupils; in fact it is not possible to document a connection to his studio for any English painter of any significance. Dutchman Adriaen Hanneman (1604‚Äì1671) returned to his native The Hague in 1638 to become the leading portraitist there.Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals, Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p. 138 QB, 2007, Flemish painter Pieter Thijs studied in van Dyck's workshop as one of van Dyck's last pupils. He became a very successful portrait and history painter in his native Antwerp.Hans Vlieghe, \\"Thijs, Pieter.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 22 August 2019 Charles I in Three Positions (1635-36), a triple portrait of Charles I, was sent to Rome for Bernini to model a bust on Legacy Much later, the styles worn by his models provided the names of the Van Dyke beard for the sharply pointed and trimmed goatees popular for men in his day, and the van Dyke collar, \\"a wide collar across the shoulders edged copiously with lace\\". During the reign of George III, a generic \\"Cavalier\\" fancy-dress costume called a Van Dyke was popular; Gainsborough's The Blue Boy is wearing such a Van Dyke outfit. In 1774 Derby porcelain advertised a figure, after a portrait by Johann Zoffany, of \\"the King in a Vandyck dress\\".The painting, Royal Collection; Honey, W.B., Old English Porcelain, p, 147, 1977 (3rd edn.), Faber and Faber, A confusing number of different pigments used in painting have been called \\"Vandyke brown\\" (mostly in English-language sources).

When van Dyck was knighted in 1632, he anglicized his name to Vandyke. Collections The British Royal Collection, which still contains many of his paintings, has a total of twenty-six paintings.Royal Collection Paintings by Van Dyck The National Gallery, London (fourteen works), The Museo del Prado (Spain) (twenty-five Works, such as: Self-portrait with Endymion Porter, The Metal Serpent, Christ Crowned with Thorns, The taking of Christ, Portrait of Mary Ruthven, the painter's Wife), The Louvre in Paris (eighteen works), The Alte Pinakothek in Munich, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. and the Frick Collection have examples of his portrait style. Wilton House still holds the works he did for one of his main patrons, the Earl of Pembroke, including his largest work, a huge family group portrait with ten main figures. Spanish museums own a rich presence of this artist in addition to The Prado's ensemble; The Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum preserves the Portrait of Jacques Le Roy, property of The Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection but also on display at the Museum there's a Crucified Christ, and The Bilbao Fine Arts Museum houses a great Lamentation before the dead Christ. In 2008, Patrimonio Nacional of Spain recovered a Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian and returned it to The Escorial Monastery, two centuries after its removal and, subsequently, The Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando has revealed as its own a long- stored painting, added to another, The Virgin with the Child with the repentant sinners, in addition the institution has an original sketch. In addition, in December 2017, a Virgin with Child, which is kept in The Museum Cerralbo and was previously considered the work of Mateo Cerezo, was revealed as the painter's original after an exhaustive study and restoration project. Finally, The Museum of Fine Arts of Valencia owns an Equestrian Portrait of Don Francisco de Moncada (currently undergoing restoration, April 2020).

School zones generally have a reduced speed limit during certain hours. Fines Fines for speeding in school zones may be enhanced. For example, many authorities double speeding fines in school zones. In New South Wales, Australia there are increases in fines that apply in school zones, during school zone times. The most common offences that occur in a school zone also attract demerit points. This includes most parking offences, such as parking on a footpath or nature strip, double parking, disobeying a no stopping or no parking sign and stopping in a bus zone. In the United Kingdom the fine for stopping next to a school is ¬£30. When active An Australian school zone sign, covered during school holidays, to denote the use of normal speeds School zone speed limits are often, but not always, only applicable during posted weekday hours near the beginning and ending of school when children are likely to cross roads. In some jurisdictions, the school zone speed limit is effective at all times when school is in session, plus additional time before and after the school day. Flashing amber lights often indicate when the school zone is effective. When a school zone also has a large playground facility, it may double as a playground zone and the speed limit could be in effect longer -- or even continuous. In California, school zones are generally in effect only \\"when children are outside or crossing the street\\",California Drivers Handbook (section \\"Around Children\\") and usually have a speed limit of 25 mph, or 40 km/h. School zone signs are sometimes amended with the notice \\"When children are present\\" (like shown on the photo), which emphasizes its definition in the drivers' handbook. School zones may also sometimes be in effect during school holidays, due to holiday programs that use school premises. In some locations, however, school zone signs will be locked up during school holidays so that motorists can drive to the normal speed limit.

Completed in 1914, the 38-story, tower is the oldest skyscraper in the city and was among the tallest skyscrapers outside New York City at the time of its completion. It was the tallest building west of the Mississippi River until the completion of the Kansas City Power & Light Building in 1931. It remained the tallest building on the U.S. West Coast for nearly half a century, until the Space Needle overtook it in 1962. The tower is named after its builder, the firearm and typewriter magnate Lyman Cornelius Smith. It was designated as a Seattle landmark in 1984.https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Neighborhoods/HistoricPreservation/Landmarks/RelatedDocuments/DesRptSmithTower.pdf History Smith Tower construction, February 1913 During a trip to Seattle in 1909, Smith planned to build a 14-story building in Seattle. His son, Burns Lyman Smith, convinced him to build instead a much taller skyscraper to steal the crown from rival city Tacoma's National Realty Building as the tallest west of the Mississippi River. Construction began in 1911. Although Smith did not live to see it, the building was completed in 1914 to a height of from curbside to the top of the pyramid, with a pinnacle height of . Smith Tower opened to the public on July 4, 1914. Over 4,000 Seattleites rode to the 35th floor on opening day. The Chinese Room, whose name was retired following the 2016 renovation, derived from the carved teak ceiling and blackwood furniture that adorned the room on opening. The room was furnished by the last Empress of China, Cixi. Furnishings include the famous Wishing Chair. The chair incorporates a carved dragon and a phoenix, which, when combined, portends marriage. According to folklore, any wishful unmarried person who sits in it would be married within a year. The legend came true for Smith's daughter, who married in the Chinese Room itself. Ivar Haglund of Ivar's restaurant fame bought the tower for $1.8 million in 1976. The Samis Foundation acquired the tower in 1996. In 2006, the building was purchased by Walton Street Capital. The building has been renovated twice, in 1986 and in 1999. In recent years high-tech companies have been occupants of Smith Tower, which sports fiber- optic wiring. The burst of the dot-com bubble hurt Smith Tower by raising its vacancy rate to 26.1 percent, twice Seattle's commercial vacancy rate, as of December 21, 2001. The Walt Disney Internet Group, for example, at the time reduced its seven floors to four. By 2007, the occupancy rate had rebounded to about 90 percent, with new occupants such as Microsoft Live Labs. Following the announced departure of the building's two largest occupants that included Disney, which moved to the Fourth and Madison Building, Walton Street Capital filed an unsuccessful application to convert the building into condominiums. Completed Smith Tower in 1914 Another view of Smith Tower looking north on 2nd Avenue, 1914 In 2011 CBRE Group reported that they had purchased a 2006 $42.5 million mortgage in default on the Smith Tower. The loan was taken out by current owner Walton Street. When CBRE stepped in, the building was 70 percent vacant, its rent income was not covering its operating expenses, and its value was assessed by the county to be less than half of its 2006 mortgage. Smith Tower was sold to CBRE at a public foreclosure auction on March 23, 2012. In the spring of 2012 Smith Tower experienced a brief revitalization in the form of new companies moving into some of its empty floors including Portent, Inc., an internet marketing company, marketing consultant Aukema & Associates, graphic-design firm Push Design, and Rialto Communications, a marketing and public-relations company. In January 2015, Seattle-based real estate investment and operating company Unico Properties bought Smith Tower for $73.7 million. Later that year, the new owners stopped the visitor tour and began remodeling the public areas, including the Chinese Room, which had been closed since 2014. A new speakeasy-themed restaurant, with Prohibition era-inspired food and drink was built on the Observatory floor, in the same space as the Chinese Room, which was permanently closed. Parts of the Chinese Room decor and furniture, such as the Wishing Chair and carved teak ceilings, were used in this new restaurant. A revised Smith Tower self-guided visitor tour, with new exhibits, resumed on August 25, 2016, along with the opening of the Observation floor bar, open to tour ticket holders at a cost of $19.14 ‚Äî the number is a reference to the date of the building. A discount is offered with a WA state drivers licence. Access to the bar without paying for the tour requires a cover charge of about half that price. A new retail store on the ground floor was also opened following the renovation. The building was sold to Goldman Sachs in October 2018 as part of a $750 million package of Unico properties in Seattle and Denver. Description View looking north from the observation deck, August 2007 Smith Tower is an example of neoclassical architecture. Its outer skin is granite on the first and second floors, and terracotta on the rest. The exterior has been washed only once, in 1976, because it remains remarkably clean without regular washing. The building was one of the last on the West Coast to employ elevator operators. The Otis Elevator Company provided the elevators, which have brass surfaces. The original doors were latticed scissor gates, so a rider could see into each hallway and through the glass walls in front of each office. The elevators were automated and modernized beginning in 2017, for faster service time and seismic safety, with new glass doors still allowing riders a view into the hallways and lobbies. After the restoration in the early 1990s, workers removed the water tank in the top of the tower. The resulting space along with a former maintenance man's apartment became a three-story penthouse, the only residence in the building. It was occupied in 2010 by artist/investor Petra Franklin, husband David Lahaie, and their two daughters. The tower includes a fallout shelter that can be seen from the entrance hall. The building is crowned by an glass dome illuminated by blue light, except during December when it is changed to green. In 2012, Death Cab for Cutie frontman Benjamin Gibbard paid tribute to the Smith Tower in the song \\"Teardrop Windows.\\" References External links * 1914 establishments in Washington (state) Landmarks in Seattle Office buildings completed in 1914 Pioneer Square, Seattle Residential skyscrapers in Seattle Skyscraper office buildings in Seattle ","title":"Smith Tower"},{"id":"294473","text":"Witchblade is a comic book series published by Top Cow Productions, an imprint of Image Comics, which ran from November 1995 to October 2015.

The plantation, a forced-labor farm worked by enslaved black people, was owned by Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States, from 1804 until his death at the Hermitage in 1845. Jackson only lived at the property occasionally until he retired from public life in 1837. It is a National Historic Landmark. Mansion and grounds =Architecture= The Hermitage is built in a secluded meadow that was chosen as a house site by Rachel Jackson, wife of Andrew Jackson. From 1804 to 1821, Jackson and his wife lived in a log cabin, enslaving black people who lived in two other log structures. Together, the complex formed the First Hermitage, with the structures known as the West, East, and Southeast cabins. Jackson commissioned construction of a more refined house, and the original mansion was a two-story, Federal-style building built with bricks manufactured onsite by skilled enslaved people. Construction took place between 1819 and 1821. The house had four rooms on the ground floor and four rooms on the second level, each with a fireplace and chimney. The large central hallways opened in warm weather from front to back to form a breezeway. A simple portico was added later. In 1831, while Jackson was residing in the White House, he had the mansion remodeled under the direction of architect David Morrison. The new structure included flanking one-story wings, a one-story entrance portico with 10 columns, and a small rear portico that gave the house a Classical appearance. Side view of the house In 1834, a chimney fire seriously damaged the house, with the exception of the dining room wing. This led to Jackson having the current 13-room, Greek Revival structure built on the same foundation as the former house. It was completed two years later. The architects for the house were Joseph Reiff and William C. Hume, who also built Tulip Grove across the road. The mansion has a rectangular layout, about from east to west and from north to south. The south front is the location of the main entrance and includes a central block with a five-bay, two-story structure with a portico supported by six modified Corinthian style, wooden columns with a simple entablature resting on the capitals. Within the portico is a second-story balcony with simple square balusters. One-story wings with single fenestrations flank the mansion and extend beyond it to the front of the portico, enclosing it on three sides. While the southern fa√ßade gives the appearance of a flat roof, the three other elevations show that the tin-covered roof is pitched. The front fa√ßade was painted a light tan, and a sand coating was added to the columns and trim to simulate the appearance of stone. A near replica of the front portico is found on the north end of the house, although it features Doric-style columns and is capped with a pediment. =Interior= The layout of the main block of the house consists of four large rooms separated by a center hall. The entry hall with plank flooring painted dark is decorated with block-printed wallpaper by Joseph Dufour et Cie of Paris, depicting scenes from Telemachus' visit to the island of Calypso. At the far end of the hall is the elliptical cantilevered staircase with mahogany handrail that leads to the second level. To the left of the hall are the front and back parlors, featuring crystal chandeliers and Italian marble mantels. Leading from the front parlor is the dining room in the east wing. Decorated with a high-gloss paint to reflect as much light as possible, the fireplace features a rustic mantelpiece called the \\"Eighth of January\\". It was carved by a veteran of the Battle of New Orleans, who worked on the mantelpiece on each anniversary of the battle until he finished on January 8, 1839. Jackson installed the piece on the next anniversary a year later on January 8, 1840. Adjacent to the dining room is a pantry and storage room that leads to an open passageway to the kitchen. This was built separate from the house to reduce the risk of fire to the main house as well as eliminate the noise, heat, and odors of cooking. To the right of the entrance hall, accessible via a side hall, are two bedrooms that were occupied by President Jackson and his son, Andrew Jackson, Jr. A spacious library and office used by Jackson and others to manage the plantation are located in the west wing. On the second level are four bedrooms used by family members and guests, including Sam Houston, and Presidents James K. Polk and Martin Van Buren. =Grounds= The site today covers , which includes the original tract of Jackson's plantation. It is overseen and managed by The Andrew Jackson Foundation, formerly called the Ladies' Hermitage Association. The mansion is approached by a cedar-lined, wide, guitar-shaped carriage drive designed by Ralph E. W. Earl. The design made it easier to maneuver carriages in the narrow space. To the east of the house was a formal garden designed by Philadelphia-based gardener William Frost in 1819. Laid out in the English four-square kitchen garden style, it consists of four quadrants and a circular center bed contained by unusually long, beveled bricks and pebbled pathways. Originally, the garden was primarily used to produce food for the mansion and secondarily as an ornamental pleasure garden. It is surrounded by a white picket fence. On the north perimeter stands a brick privy that served as a status symbol as well as a garden feature. After Rachel Jackson died in 1828, Jackson had her buried in the garden she loved. When he had the house remodeled in 1831, Jackson also had a Classicizing \\"temple & monument\\" constructed for Rachel's grave. Craftsmen completed the domed limestone tomb with a copper roof in 1832. Alfred's Cabin Behind the mansion, the property includes a smokehouse that date to the early 19th century. The large brick smokehouse at the rear of the kitchen was built in 1831 and cured of pork a year. Nearby is a cabin known as Uncle Alfred's Cabin. Alfred Jackson was born at the Hermitage around 1812. He worked there as a freedman after Emancipation and stayed on as caretaker following the purchase of the estate in 1889 by the Ladies' Hermitage Association. Jackson died in 1901 and was buried near the tomb of the President and Mrs. Jackson. Two other cabins were built from materials of the First Hermitage. After Jackson built the main house, the two- story log structure he had lived in for 15 years was disassembled, and the materials were used to build two one-story buildings used as quarters. From 1988 to 2005, teams conducted extensive archaeological work at the plantation. Their work revealed the location of an ice house behind the smokehouse and hundreds of thousands of artifacts. A brick triplex of cabins that was likely used by domestics and artisans was discovered near the mansion yard. Remains of three dug-in-ground pits suggest there were at least two log houses and four brick duplexes. The cotton gin and press were located in one of the cotton fields just beyond the First Hermitage. History The plantation that Jackson named Hermitage was located from the Cumberland and Stones Rivers after Native Americans had been pushed out of the region. The land was originally settled in 1780 by Robert Hays, who was the grand uncle John Coffee Hays pedigree at RootsWeb; J. H. Garner Genealogy Database, last updated March 2015. Retrieved February 16, 2016. of Texas Ranger John Coffee Hays and Confederate General Harry Thompson Hays. Hays sold the farm to Jackson in 1804. = Cotton plantation = Jackson and his wife moved into the existing two-story log blockhouse, built to resist Indian attacks. He added a lean-to on the back of the cabin and to the rear erected a group of log outbuildings, including cabins, store rooms, and a smokehouse. This complex is known historically as the First Hermitage. This scale of operation ranked him as a major planter in middle Tennessee. In 1818‚Äì19, prior to his appointment as provisional Governor of the Florida Territory, Jackson built a brick house to replace the log structure he had lived in after purchasing the plantation. He also added six brick structures, containing a total of 13 dwelling units for the people he enslaved. These included a three-unit building known as the Triplex, built behind the mansion. A two-unit duplex known as the South Cabin was built at the First Hermitage. Four brick duplexes were built at the Field Quarter and were known as Cabins 1, 2, 3, and 4. At least one Field Cabin was still standing as late as the 1920s. Elected President in 1828, Jackson enlarged the Hermitage during his first term. After an 1834 fire destroyed much of the interior of the house, he rebuilt and refurnished it. At the end of his second term in 1837, Jackson retired to the Hermitage, where he died in 1845. Andrew Jackson was buried in the garden next to his wife. Throughout his life, Jackson expanded the plantation to an operation of , with used for cotton, the commodity crop, and the remainder for food production and breeding and training racehorses. Jackson's adopted son, Andrew Jackson, Jr., inherited the estate. Due to debt and bad investments, Jackson Jr. began selling off portions of the estate. In 1856, he sold the remaining , the mansion, and the outbuildings to the State of Tennessee, with a provision that the Jackson family could remain in residence as caretakers of the estate. The state intended to turn over the property to the federal government for use as a southern branch of the United States Military Academy, but the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 disrupted this plan. = Civil War and afterwards = The tomb of Andrew and Rachel Jackson is located in the Hermitage garden. On May 5, 1863, units of the Union Army from Indiana approached the Hermitage. Pvt. Joseph C. Taylor wrote an account in his diary: = Museum = Andrew Jackson's grandson, Andrew Jackson III, and his family were the last to occupy the Hermitage. The family moved out in 1893, and it ceased being a family residence. The Hermitage was opened to the public by the Ladies' Hermitage Association, who had been deeded the property by the state of Tennessee for use as a museum of both Jackson's life and the antebellum South in general. The Association restored the mansion to its appearance in 1837. Over time, the organization bought back all the land that had been sold, taking ownership of the last parcel that restored the plantation boundaries in 2003. The Hermitage, 1998 tornado damage The Hermitage escaped disaster during the 1998 Nashville tornado outbreak. An F-3 tornado crossed the property at about 4 p.m. on April 16, 1998, missing the house and grave site but toppling 1,000 trees on the estate, many that were reportedly planted by Jackson himself nearly 200 years earlier. The trees once hid the house from passers-by on U.S. Route 70, but their loss left the mansion in plain sight. Using wood from the fallen trees, Gibson Guitar Corporation produced 200 limited-edition \\"Old Hickory\\" guitars. The first guitar produced was presented to the Smithsonian, although , it was not on display. The mansion is the most accurately preserved early presidential home in the country. Each year, the home receives more than a quarter million visitors, making it the fourth-most-visited presidential residence in the country (after the White House, Mount Vernon, and Monticello). The property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960. = Confederate Soldiers Home Cemetery = Veterans at the Confederate Soldiers Home, circa 1908 Part of the Hermitage estate that passed in to public hands became the site of the state-funded Confederate Soldiers Home, a residential facility that housed poor and disabled Confederate veterans beginning in 1892. More than 480 veterans who died there were buried in an onsite cemetery, each marked with a white, military-style gravestone and arrayed in circles around a monumental stone. Legacy The city in Davidson County where the Hermitage is located is known as Hermitage, Tennessee. A hotel named the Hermitage Hotel, located in downtown Nashville, opened in 1910 and is still operating. Many celebrities and U.S. presidents have spent time there. In popular culture *The plantation is prominently featured in one of the opening scenes of F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel, The Last Tycoon (1941), when the narrator, Celia, visits it with two other characters. *The Hermitage was one of the filming locations and settings for the 1955 Disney film Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier.

She was a prophetess and first appears in the Book of Exodus. The Torah refers to her as \\"Miriam the Prophetess\\" and the Talmud names her as one of the seven major female prophets of Israel. Scripture describes her alongside of Moses and Aaron as delivering the Jews from exile in Egypt: \\"For I brought you up out of the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, and I sent before you Moses, Aaron, and Miriam\\". According to the Midrash, just as Moses led the men out of Egypt and taught them Torah, so too Miriam led the women and taught them Torah.  Biblical narrative  Miriam was the daughter of Amram, the leader of the Israelites in ancient Egypt, and of Jochebed; she was the sister of Aaron and Moses.Numbers 26:59 The narrative of Moses' infancy in the Torah describes an unnamed sister of Moses observing him being placed in the Nile (Ex 2:4); she is traditionally identified as Miriam. In the biblical narrative of The Exodus, Miriam is described as a \\"prophetess\\" when she leads the Israelites in the Song of the Sea after Pharaoh's army is destroyed at the Sea of Reeds. The Torah describes Miriam and Aaron as criticizing Moses‚Äô \\"Cushite\\" wife in Numbers 12. Regarding the death of Miriam, the Torah states, \\"The entire congregation of the children of Israel arrived at the desert of Tzin in the first month, and the people settled in Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.\\" Interpretations and elaborations =Cushite wife=  Midrashic explanation  Miriam watching over her infant brother Moses The Midrash explains the entire story as follows: It became known to Miriam and Aaron that Moses had separated from intimacy with his wife Tzipora. They disapproved of this separation because they considered her to be outstandingly righteous, much as a dark-skinned person stands out among light-skinned people - hence the reference to Tzipora as a ‚ÄúCushite‚Äù. This usage of the word Cushite is non-pejorative and is often used in Jewish sources as a term for someone unique and outstanding. In fact, King Saul and even the Jewish People are referred to by the term ‚ÄúCushite‚Äù. Their complaint, therefore, was not about the union between Moses and Tzipora, but about their separation. The only justification they could find for Moses‚Äô celibacy was in order to maintain his prophetic state. This explains their claim that God spoke not only to Moses but also to them, yet they had not separated from their spouses. But God rebuked them by calling them all out ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù, causing Miriam and Aaron a great burning sensation since they lacked immersion in a mikva after marital relations. God thus demonstrated to them Moses‚Äô unique level of prophecy for which he had to be prepared at all times, thereby justifying his separation from Tzipora. Afterwards, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs wrath flared against them.‚Äù Rabbi Louis Ginzberg wrote the anger of God to them. Afterward, Miriam is left with bodily tzara‚Äôat, which according to Jewish sources is a divine punishment for slander.Shabbat 97a; Rambam, Tzara'at 15:10. This was because she, not Aaron, was the one who initiated the complaint against Moses. Despite Miriam's intent to help Tzipora, she should have judged Moses favorably and approached Moses on Tzipora's behalf privately. Aaron asks Moses to intercede for Miriam, Moses prays to God to heal her, and God concedes after requiring a quarantine of seven days. Both Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses, but only Miriam contracted tzara'at. It has been suggested that since according to the Hebrew Bible anyone with tzara‚Äôat was tamei (), Aaron was spared this punishment in order not to interrupt his duties as High Priest. However, noting the wording of the verse, ‚ÄúGod‚Äôs wrath flared against them [i.e. both Aaron and Miriam]‚Äù, the Talmud appears to conclude that Aaron was also smitten with tzara‚Äôat initially, but was then immediately cured.  Alternative explanations  Miriam's Song, by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (1860). It has been suggested that Josephus and Irenaeus (who merely cites Josephus) identify the Cushite woman as Tharbis, ‚Äúthe daughter of the king of the Ethiopians‚Äù. However, while Josephus does describe a legend (which is not written in the Torah) wherein Moses marries this princess during a military campaign he leads in Ethiopia, according to Josephus this marriage occurs while Moses is still a royal prince of Egypt long before he re-discovers his oppressed Jewish brethren. After which time, upon fleeing as a solitary fugitive from Egypt, the only marriage of Moses that the Torah records is with Tzipora the daughter of Yitro the Midianite. In fact, Josephus himself later records Moses‚Äô marriage to Tzipora as separate and subsequent to his earlier marriage to Tharbis. Furthermore, according to the conclusion of the Tharbis legend, Moses fashioned a miraculous ring which caused her to forget her love for him, and he then returned to Egypt alone.Raleigh, Sir Walter. The History of the World: Section IV, ‚ÄòOf Moses Flying out of Egypt‚Äô, 1829 edition. Therefore, even according to Josephus, Moses‚Äô first marriage to Tharbis as military leader of Egypt terminated long before his later marriage to Tzipora as fugitive from Egypt, such that the Cushite wife of Moses mentioned in the Torah after the Exodus appears to be Tzipora, as explained above. Richard E. Friedman writes that since Cush is generally understood to mean ‚ÄúEthiopia‚Äù, it is possible that the ‚ÄúCushite woman‚Äù is not Tzipora. But he adds that since there is a place called Cushan which is a region of Midian, and Moses‚Äô wife Tzipora has already been identified as a Midianite, it is possible that the term ‚ÄúCushite‚Äù relates to Tzipora's being from Cushan. However, Friedman's primary interest is not in the identity of the Cushite woman, but rather in the outcome of this story which establishes Moses‚Äô superiority over Aaron as an example of his claim that rival priesthoods created or publicized tales in order to legitimize their respective claims to privilege and power. He describes the Aaronid priesthood in the Kingdom of Judah, which claimed descent from Aaron and which controlled the Temple in Jerusalem, as opposed to a priesthood which claimed allegiance to Moses and was based at Shiloh in the Kingdom of Israel. Using interpretations from the documentary hypothesis, he notes that this story, which he calls ‚ÄúSnow-White Miriam‚Äù, was authored by the Elohist who he claims was from, or supported, the Shiloh priesthood, and thus promoted this tale to assert Moses‚Äô superiority over Aaron and thereby belittle the Aaronid priesthood in Judah. However, the identity of the Cushite woman referred to in this story is tangential to Friedman and his opinion remains inconclusive. = The Well of Miriam = Miriam's death is described in Numbers 20:1 and in the next verse, the Israelites are described as complaining of the lack of water at Kadesh. The text reads, \\"Miriam died there, and was buried there. And there was no water for the congregation.\\" In Jewish folk-religious tradition this abrupt transition between her passing and the lack of water was explained by postulating a \\"well of Miriam\\" that dried up when she died. Further elaboration identified the rock that Moses struck to bring forth water in Exodus 17:5-6 with this well, and it was said that the rock travelled with the people until Miriam's death. The Talmud says, ‚ÄúThree great leaders led Israel: Moses, Aaron and Miriam. In their merit they received three great gifts: the Well [Miriam], the Clouds of Glory [Aaron] and the Manna [Moses].‚Äù When Miriam died, the well was removed as is evidenced by the fact that immediately after the verse ‚ÄúAnd Miriam died‚Äù, There was no water for the community. Rashi says that this well was the same rock from which Moses brought forth water after Miriam's death. The Midrash states that when they encamped, the leader of each Tribe took his staff to the well and drew a line in the sand toward his Tribe's encampment. The waters of the well were drawn after the mark and thus supplied water for each of the Tribes.  Symbolism in modern practice  Miriam is a popular figure among some Jewish feminists. Thus, in addition to the traditional cup of wine that is set for the Prophet Elijah, some feminist- inspired Seders set a cup of water for Miriam which is sometimes also accompanied by a ritual in her honor.Miriam‚Äôs Cup: Miriam‚Äôs Cup rituals for the family Passover seder. Miriamscup.com. Retrieved on 18 October 2011. Miriam's Cup originated in the 1980s in a Boston Rosh Chodesh group; it was invented by Stephanie Loo, who filled it with what she referred to as mayim chayim (living waters) and used it in a feminist ceremony of guided meditation. Miriam's cup is linked to the midrash of Miriam's Well, described as \\"a rabbinic legend that tells of a miraculous well that accompanied the Israelites during their forty years in the desert at the Exodus from Egypt\\". Some Modern Orthodox Jews have revived an ancient customRav Sherira Gaon on the Seder night, cited by R‚Äô Elazar of Worms (c. 1176 ‚Äì 1238) in (from Dr. Yael Levine). of adding a piece of fish to the Seder plate in honor of Miriam who is associated with water, based on the teaching in the Talmud that God gave manna (on the ground) in the merit of Moses, clouds of glory (in the sky) in the merit of Aaron and a well (of water) in the merit of Miriam. Accordingly, the lamb (earth), egg (air) and fish (water) in the Seder symbolize the three prophets Moses, Aaron and Miriam, respectively, whom God chose to redeem the Jews from Egypt. Similarly, the lamb, egg and fish also allude to the three mythical creatures in Jewish tradition - the land beast Behemoth, the bird Ziz, and the sea-creature Leviathan,Gen. 1:21, see Rashi; Is. 27:1; Baba Batra 74b. Dr. Yael Levine cites R‚Äô Chaim Palaggi (1788-1869), who also mentions placing fish on the Seder table and reciting, ‚ÄúMay it be Your will that You merit us to eat from the banquet of Leviathan‚Äù. respectively. According to the Midrash, the Leviathan and Behemoth, as well as the Ziz, are to be served at the Seudat Techiyat HaMetim (the feast for the righteous following the Resurrection of the Dead), to which the Passover Seder alludes, insofar as it commemorates the past Redemption together with the Cup of Elijah's heralding the future, Final Redemption.Dr. Yael Levine. Where is Miriam on the Seder plate?. Quranic account There is no mention of Moses' sister's name specifically. She is just referred to as \\"his sister\\" or \\"Moses's sister.\\" In the Qur‚Äôan, as in the Hebrew Bible, Miriam obeys her mother's request to follow the baby Moses as he floats down the river in a basket, their mother having set him afloat so he would not be killed by Pharaoh's servants and soldiers (). Later on, Asiya, wife of Pharaoh, finds Moses at the river and adopts him as her own, but Moses refuses to be suckled by her. Miriam asks Pharaoh's wife and her handmaidens to have his own mother act as nursemaid to Moses, the mother's identity not being known to Pharaoh's wife ().

Any authority can claim ETJ over any external territory they wish. However, for the claim to be effective in the external territory (except by the exercise of force), it must be agreed either with the legal authority in the external territory, or with a legal authority that covers both territories. When unqualified, ETJ usually refers to such an agreed jurisdiction, or it will be called something like \\"claimed ETJ\\". The phrase may also refer to a country's laws extending beyond its boundaries in the sense that they may authorise the courts of that country to enforce their jurisdiction against parties appearing before them in with respect to acts they allegedly engaged in outside that country. This does not depend on the co-operation of other countries, since the affected people are within the relevant country (or at least, in a case involving a person being tried in absentia, the case is being heard by a court of that country). For example, many countries have laws which give their criminal courts jurisdiction to try prosecutions for piracy, sexual offences against children, computer crimes and/or terrorism committed outside their national boundaries. Sometimes such laws only apply to nationals of that country, and sometimes they may apply to anyone. Cases of exercised jurisdiction =Diplomatic missions= Diplomatic immunity of foreign embassies and consulates in host countries is governed by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. =Military forces= Status of forces agreements and visiting forces agreements are in effect in many countries that allow visiting forces to exercise jurisdiction over members of their forces that are stationed in the host country. =Criminal law= Criminal jurisdiction can be of an extraterritorial nature where: * a nation asserts it either generally or in specific cases under its domestic law, * a supranational authority (such as the United Nations Security Council) has created an international court to deal with a specific case (e.g. war crimes in a certain country), or * an international court has been created under a treaty to deal with a stated area of jurisdiction. Criminal codes in certain countries assert jurisdiction over crimes committed outside the country: * in France, the Code p√©nal asserts general jurisdiction over crimes by, or against, the country's citizens, no matter where they may have occurred; this is also the case with regard to those who became French citizens after the act. Double criminality is required except in the cases of felonies (crimes) which carry custodial sentences of ten years or more. * in Japan, the Penal Code specifies certain cases and applicable lists of crimes over which jurisdiction will be asserted. Many countries have implemented laws which allow their nationals to be prosecuted by their courts for crimes such as war crimes and genocide even when the crime is committed extraterritorially. In addition, the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court has been incorporated into domestic law in many countries to provide for the International Criminal Court to exercise jurisdiction within their borders. =Sanctions against foreign countries= Economic sanctions against other countries may be instituted under either domestic law or under the authority of the United Nations Security Council, and their severity can include measures against foreign persons operating outside the country in question. In 2017, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and European Union President Jean-Claude Juncker criticized the draft of new U.S. sanctions against Russia targeting the EU‚ÄìRussia energy projects.\\"Germany's Angela Merkel slams planned US sanctions on Russia\\". Deutsche Welle. 16 June 2017.Europe 'stands ready to act' if US sanctions on Russia affect its oil and gas supplies The Independent, 26 July 2017. France‚Äôs foreign ministry described the new U.S. sanctions as illegal under international law due to their extra-territorial reach. =Competition law= Extraterritorial jurisdiction plays a significant role in regulation of transnational anti-competitive practices. In the US, extraterritorial impacts in this field first arose from Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States,The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, et al. v. The United States, 221 U.S. 1; 31 S. Ct. 502; 55 L. Ed. 619; 1911 U.S. LEXIS 1725 where Imperial Oil in Canada was ordered to be divested from Standard Oil. Current practice dates from United States v. Alcoa,United States v. Aluminium Company of America (Alcoa) 148 F.2d 416 (2d Cir. 1945) where the effects doctrineA. Parrish, 'The Effects Test: Extraterritoriality's Fifth Business' (2008) 61 Vand. L. Rev. 1455 was introduced, allowing for jurisdiction over foreign offenders and foreign conduct, so long as the economic effects of the anticompetitive conduct are experienced on the domestic market.JP Griffin, Extraterritoriality in U.S. and EU Antitrust Enforcement (1999) 67 Antitrust L.J. 159 The effects doctrine has been gradually developed in the U.S. and then in various forms accepted in other jurisdictions. In the EU it is known as the implementation test.D Geradin, M Reysen, and D Henry, Extraterritoriality, Comity and Cooperation in EC Competition Law (2008) Extraterritorial jurisdiction in the area of antitrust faces various limitations, such as the problem of accessing foreign-based evidence,B Sweeney, 'Combating Foreign Anti-competitive Conduct: What Role for Extraterritorialism?'

M Martyniszyn, Avoidance Techniques: State Related Defences in International Antitrust Cases (2011) Application in specific countries =Commonwealth of Nations= The ability of parliaments of Commonwealth countries to legislate extraterritorially was confirmed by s. 3 of the Statute of Westminster 1931. In Australia, extraterritorial jurisdiction of the state parliaments was authorized by s.2 of the Australia Act 1986. =Canada= The Criminal Code asserts jurisdiction over the following offences outside Canada: :* on a Canadian aircraft in flight, or on any other flight which terminates in Canada, for any indictable offence :* on any aircraft or in any airport in the world, for endangering such facilities :* by a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or stateless person resident in Canada, for offences relating to cultural property protected by the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict :* against or on board a Canadian ship on the high seas or a fixed platform attached to the continental shelf of Canada, or by or against a Canadian citizen on any ship or fixed platform, or by any person who is found in Canada after such offence :* on a Canadian ship or aircraft, relating to ::* hostage taking, ::* offences against internationally protected persons or United Nations personnel, or ::* terrorism financing :* on the International Space Station :* involving nuclear material :* involving terrorism :* terrorist activity against Canadian citizens or Canadian government missions, or intended to compel the Canadian government, or any provincial government, to do or not do a particular act :* relating to sexual offences against children =Hong Kong= Article 38 of the Hong Kong national security law, passed in Jun 2020, asserts that the law applies to all citizens - regardless of nationality - both inside and outside Hong Kong. Crimes covered under the national security law include: :* advocating, planning, or supporting secession or changes in Hong Kong or the People's Republic of China sovereignty. :* subverting the People's Republic of China government and system, including related participation, organizing, planning, and financially supporting these activities :* substantially interfering or obstructing the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong government functions :* acts of terrorism, defined as including damaging transportation equipment, causing traffic obstructions, or otherwise substantially interfering with the public's health and safety :* colluding with foreign forces to harm national security, defined as including causing substantial obstruction to the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong government policies, controlling elections, seeking foreign sanctions, or inciting hate against the Chinese and Hong Kong governments Whether this assertion has legal merit remains to be seen. =Ireland= = United Kingdom = Under Section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, British citizens can be prosecuted for sexual offences committed against children abroad. Section 72 was used to convict paedophile Richard Huckle on 71 counts of serious sexual offences against children in Malaysia. Huckle was sentenced to 22 life sentences. While no official tally is kept, seven people are believed to have been convicted under Section 72. The Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 asserted extraterritorial jurisdiction to close the loophole whereby girls could be taken outside the UK to undergo FGM procedures. The Nuclear Explosions (Prohibition and Inspections) Act 1998 in Section 2https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/7/section/2 prohibits United Kingdom nationals, Scottish partnerships or bodies incorporated under the law of any part of the United Kingdom from knowingly causing a nuclear explosion in the United Kingdom \\"or elsewhere\\". =United States= Municipal and state law In the U.S., many states have laws or even constitutional provisions which permit cities to make certain decisions about the land beyond the town's incorporated limits. :* Examples of states which allow cities to claim ETJ with respect to zoning or other matters, either generally or prior to annexation, are: ::* Alaska ::* Arkansas ::* Nebraska, ::* North Carolina, and ::* Texas :* In California, county Local Agency Formation Commissions determine spheres of influence that cities may exercise over areas outside their boundaries. Federal law The U.S. Criminal Code asserts the following items to fall within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States, much of which is extraterritorial in nature: (subject to the provisions of any treaty or international agreement) # The high seas and any other waters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of the United States and out of the jurisdiction of any particular state, including any vessels owned by US persons that are travelling on themas clarified under s. 901, : ‚ÄúThe Congress declares that all the territorial sea of the United States, as defined by Presidential Proclamation 5928 of December 27, 1988, for purposes of Federal criminal jurisdiction is part of the United States, subject to its sovereignty, and is within the special maritime and territorial jurisdiction of the United States for the purposes of title 18, United States Code.‚Äù # Any US vessel travelling on the Great Lakes, connecting waters or the Saint Lawrence River (where that river forms part of the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border) # Any lands reserved or acquired for the use of the United States, and under the exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction thereof # Any island claimed under the Guano Islands Act # Any US aircraft flying over waters in the same manner as US vessels # Any US spacecraft when in flight # Any place outside the jurisdiction of any nation with respect to an offense by or against a national of the United StatesThis element was added in response to the case of United States v. Escamilla, a murder case on an iceberg in international waters. # Any foreign vessel during a voyage having a scheduled departure from or arrival in the United States with respect to an offense committed by or against a national of the United States # Offenses committed by or against a national of the United States in diplomatic missions, consulates, military and other missions, together with related residences, outside the US # International Parental Kidnapping Crime Act In order to deal with the issue of private military contractors and private security contractors being used by U.S. Government agencies overseas, the Military Extraterritorial Jurisdiction Act was passed by Congress to subject them to a similar manner of jurisdiction. Certain federal property has the status of federal enclave, restricting the application of state laws,18 U.S.C. ¬ß7(3). See United States Department of Justice Criminal Resource Manual ¬ß 1630 but that has been partially rectified by the Assimilative Crimes Act. Similarly, state jurisdiction is restricted on Native American tribal lands. Generally, the U.S. founding fathers and early courts believed that American laws could not have jurisdiction over sovereign countries. In a 1909 Supreme Court case, Justice Oliver Wendel Holmes introduced what came to be known as the \\"presumption against extraterritoriality,\\" making explicit this judicial preference that U.S. laws not be applied to other countries. American thought about extraterritoriality has changed over the years, however. For example, the Alien Tort Statute of 1789 allows foreign citizens in the United States to bring cases before federal courts against foreign defendants for violations of the \\"law of nations\\" in foreign countries. Although this statute was ignored for many years, U.S. courts since the 1980s have interpreted it to allow foreigners to seek justice in cases of human-rights violations in foreign lands, such as in Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain. In Morrison v. National Australia Bank, 2010, the Supreme Court held that in interpreting a statute, the \\"presumption against extraterritoriality\\" is absolute unless the text of the statute explicitly says otherwise.Morrison v. National Australia Bank syllabus Economic law Economic sanctions with extraterritorial impact have been instituted under: :* the Trading with the Enemy Act (as in the case of the embargo against Cuba) :* the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (in governing the re-export of subject goods and technologies after initial export from the US) :* the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (especially in the case of sanctions against Iran) :* the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act Unlike most nations, the United States also attempts extraterritorial application of U.S. personal tax laws. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act is an extension of this concept, which focuses on enforcement.

The market prices can indicate what the crowd thinks the probability of the event is. A prediction market contract trades between 0 and 100%. It is a binary option that will expire at the price of 0 or 100%. Prediction markets can be thought of as belonging to the more general concept of crowdsourcing which is specially designed to aggregate information on particular topics of interest. The main purposes of prediction markets are eliciting aggregating beliefs over an unknown future outcome. Traders with different beliefs trade on contracts whose payoffs are related to the unknown future outcome and the market prices of the contracts are considered as the aggregated belief. History Before the era of scientific polling, early forms of prediction markets often existed in the form of political betting. One such political bet dates back to 1503, in which people bet on who would be the papal successor. Even then, it was already considered \\"an old practice\\". According to Paul Rhode and Koleman Strumpf, who has researched the history of prediction markets, there are records of election betting in Wall Street dating back to 1884. Rhode and Strumpf estimates that average betting turnover per US presidential election is equivalent to over 50 percent of the campaign spend. Economic theory for the ideas behind prediction markets can be credited to Friedrich Hayek in his 1945 article \\"The Use of Knowledge in Society\\" and Ludwig von Mises in his \\"Economic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth\\". Modern economists agree that Mises' argument combined with Hayek's elaboration of it, is correct.\\"Biography of Ludwig Edler von Mises (1881‚Äì1973)\\", The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics Prediction markets are championed in James Surowiecki's 2004 book The Wisdom of Crowds, Cass Sunstein's 2006 Infotopia, and Douglas Hubbard's How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business.Douglas Hubbard \\"How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business\\" John Wiley & Sons, 2007 The research literature is collected together in the peer-reviewed The Journal of Prediction Markets, edited by Leighton Vaughan Williams and published by the University of Buckingham Press. =Milestones in development of modern electronic prediction markets= * One of the first modern electronic prediction markets is the University of Iowa's Iowa Electronic Markets, introduced during the 1988 US presidential election. * Around 1990 at Project Xanadu, Robin Hanson used the first known corporate prediction market. Employees used it in order to bet on, for example, the cold fusion controversy. * HedgeStreet, designated in 1991 as a market and regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, enables Internet traders to speculate on economic events. *The Hollywood Stock Exchange, a virtual market game established in 1996 and now a division of Cantor Fitzgerald, LP, in which players buy and sell prediction shares of movies, actors, directors, and film- related options, correctly predicted 32 of 2006's 39 big-category Oscar nominees and 7 out of 8 top category winners. * In 2001, Intrade.com launched a prediction market trading platform from Ireland allowing real money trading between members on contracts related to a number of different categories including business issues, current events, financial topics, and more. Intrade ceased trading in 2013. * In July 2003, the U.S. Department of Defense publicized a Policy Analysis Market on their website, and speculated that additional topics for markets might include terrorist attacks. A critical backlash quickly denounced the program as a \\"terrorism futures market\\" and the Pentagon hastily canceled the program. * In 2005, scientific monthly journal Nature stated how major pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company used prediction markets to help predict which development drugs might have the best chance of advancing through clinical trials, by using internal markets to forecast outcomes of drug research and development efforts. * Also in 2005, Google Inc announced that it has been using prediction markets to forecast product launch dates, new office openings, and many other things of strategic importance. Other companies such as HP and Microsoft also conduct private markets for statistical forecasts. * In October 2007, companies from the United States, Ireland, Austria, Germany, and Denmark formed the Prediction Market Industry Association, tasked with promoting awareness, education, and validation for prediction markets. The current status of the association appears to be defunct. * In July 2018, the first decentralized prediction market Augur was launched on the Ethereum blockchain. Accuracy The ability of the prediction market to aggregate information and make accurate predictions is based on the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that assets prices are fully reflecting all available information. For instance, existing share prices always include all the relevant related information for the stock market to make accurate predictions. James Surowiecki raises three necessary conditions for collective wisdom: diversity of information, independence of decision, and decentralization of organization. In the case of predictive market, each participant normally has diversified information from others and makes their decision independently. The market itself has a character of decentralization compared to expertise decisions. Because of these reasons, predictive market is generally a valuable source to capture collective wisdom and make accurate predictions. Prediction markets have an advantage over other forms of forecasts due to the following characteristics. Firstly, they can efficiently aggregate a plethora of information, beliefs, and data. Next, they obtain truthful and relevant information through financial and other forms of incentives. Prediction markets can incorporate new information quickly and are difficult to manipulate. The accuracy of the prediction market in different conditions has been studied and supported by numerous researchers. * Steven Gjerstad (Purdue), in his paper \\"Risk Aversion, Beliefs, and Prediction Market Equilibrium\\",Steven Gjerstad. \\"\\"Risk Aversion, Beliefs, and Prediction Market Equilibrium\\"\\"(PDF). Econ.arizona.edu. Archived from the original (PDF) on 12 April 2014. Retrieved 20 August 2016. has shown that prediction market prices are very close to the mean belief of market participants if the agents are risk averse and the distribution of beliefs is spread out (as with a normal distribution, for example). * Justin Wolfers (Wharton) and Eric Zitzewitz (Dartmouth) have obtained similar results to Gjerstad's conclusions in their paper \\"Interpreting Prediction Market Prices as Probabilities\\".Justin Wolfers; Eric Zitzewitz. \\"\\"Interpreting Prediction Market Prices as Probabilities\\"\\" (PDF). Bpp.wharton.upenn.edu. Archived from the original (PDF)on 12 November 2012. Retrieved 20 August 2016. In practice, the prices of binary prediction markets have proven to be closely related to actual frequencies of events in the real world. * Douglas Hubbard has also conducted a sample of over 400 retired claims which showed that the probability of an event is close to its market price but, more importantly, significantly closer than the average single subjective estimate. However, he also shows that this benefit is partly offset if individuals first undergo calibrated probability assessment training so that they are good at assessing odds subjectively. The key benefit of the market, Hubbard claims, is that it mostly adjusts for uncalibrated estimates and, at the same time, incentivizes market participants to seek further information. * Lionel Page and Robert Clemen have looked at the quality of predictions for events taking place some time in the future. They found that predictions are very good when the event predicted is close in time. For events which take place further in time (e.g. elections in more than a year), prices are biased towards 50%. This bias comes from the traders' \\"time preferences\\" (their preferences not to lock their funds for a long time in assets). Due to the accuracy of the prediction market, it has been applied to different industries to make important decisions. Some examples include: * Prediction market can be utilized to improve forecast and has a potential application to test lab-based information theories based on its feature of information aggregation. Researchers have applied prediction markets to assess unobservable information in Google's IPO valuation ahead of time. * In healthcare, predictive markets can help forecast the spread of infectious disease. In a pilot study, a statewide influenza in Iowa was predicted by these markets 2‚Äì4 weeks in advance with clinical data volunteered from participating health care workers. * Some corporations have harnessed internal predictive markets for decisions and forecasts. In these cases, employees can use virtual currency to bet on what they think will happen for this company in the future. The most accurate guesser will win a money prize as payoff. For example, Best Buy once experimented on using the predictive market to predict whether a Shanghai store can be open on time. The virtual dollar drop in the market successfully forecasted the lateness of the business and prevented the company from extra money loss. Although prediction markets are often fairly accurate and successful, there are many times the market fails in making the right prediction or making one at all. Based mostly on an idea in 1945 by Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek, prediction markets are \\"mechanisms for collecting vast amounts of information held by individuals and synthesizing it into a useful data point\\".Mann, Adam. \\"Market Forecasts.\\" Nature 538 (2017): 308‚Äì10. Web. 3 February 2017. One way the prediction market gathers information is through James Surowiecki's phrase, \\"The Wisdom of Crowds\\", in which a group of people with a sufficiently broad range of opinions can collectively be cleverer than any individual. However, this information gathering technique can also lead to the failure of the prediction market. Oftentimes, the people in these crowds are skewed in their independent judgements due to peer pressure, panic, bias, and other breakdowns developed out of a lack of diversity of opinion. One of the main constraints and limits of the wisdom of crowds is that some prediction questions require specialized knowledge that majority of people do not have. Due to this lack of knowledge, the crowd's answers can sometimes be very wrong.O'Grady, Cathleen. \\"Crowds Are Wise Enough to Know When Other People Will Get It Wrong.\\" Ars Technica. Conde Nast, 28 January 2017. Web. 3 February 2017. The second market mechanism is the idea of the marginal-trader hypothesis. According to this theory, \\"there will always be individuals seeking out places where the crowd is wrong\\". These individuals, in a way, put the prediction market back on track when the crowd fails and values could be skewed. In early 2017, researchers at MIT developed the \\"surprisingly popular\\" algorithm to help improve answer accuracy from large crowds. The method is built off the idea of taking confidence into account when evaluating the accuracy of an answer. The method asks people two things for each question: What they think the right answer is, and what they think popular opinion will be. The variation between the two aggregate responses indicates the correct answer.Dizikes, Peter. \\"Better Wisdom from Crowds.\\" MIT News. MIT News Office, 25 January 2017. Web. 3 February 2017. The effects of manipulation and biases are also internal challenges prediction markets need to deal with, i.e. liquidity or other factors not intended to be measured are taken into account as risk factors by the market participants, distorting the market probabilities. Prediction markets may also be subject to speculative bubbles. For example, in the year 2000 IEM presidential futures markets, seeming \\"inaccuracy\\" comes from buying that occurred on or after Election Day, 11/7/00, but, by then, the trend was clear. There can also be direct attempts to manipulate such markets. In the Tradesports 2004 presidential markets there was an apparent manipulation effort. An anonymous trader sold short so many Bush 2004 presidential futures contracts that the price was driven to zero, implying a zero percent chance that Bush would win. The only rational purpose of such a trade would be an attempt to manipulate the market in a strategy called a \\"bear raid\\". If this was a deliberate manipulation effort it failed, however, as the price of the contract rebounded rapidly to its previous level. As more press attention is paid to prediction markets, it is likely that more groups will be motivated to manipulate them. However, in practice, such attempts at manipulation have always proven to be very short lived. In their paper entitled \\"Information Aggregation and Manipulation in an Experimental Market\\" (2005), Hanson, Oprea and Porter (George Mason U), show how attempts at market manipulation can in fact end up increasing the accuracy of the market because they provide that much more profit incentive to bet against the manipulator. Using real-money prediction market contracts as a form of insurance can also affect the price of the contract. For example, if the election of a leader is perceived as negatively impacting the economy, traders may buy shares of that leader being elected, as a hedge. These prediction market inaccuracies were especially prevalent during Brexit and the 2016 US Presidential Elections. On Thursday, 23 June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union. Even until the moment votes were counted, prediction markets leaned heavily on the side of staying in the EU and failed to predict the outcomes of the vote. According to Michael Traugott, a former president of the American Association for Public Opinion Research, the reason for the failure of the prediction markets is due to the influence of manipulation and bias shadowed by mass opinion and public opinion. Clouded by the similar mindset of users in prediction markets, they created a paradoxical environment where they began self-reinforcing their initial beliefs (in this case, that the UK would vote to remain in the EU). Here, we can observe how crippling bias and lack of diversity of opinion can be in the success of a prediction market. Similarly, during the 2016 US Presidential Elections, prediction markets failed to predict the outcome, throwing the world into mass shock. Like the Brexit case, information traders were caught in an infinite loop of self-reinforcement once initial odds were measured, leading traders to \\"use the current prediction odds as an anchor\\" and seemingly discounting incoming prediction odds completely. Traders essentially treated the market odds as correct probabilities and did not update enough using outside information, causing the prediction markets to be too stable to accurately represent current circumstances. Koleman Strumpf, a University of Kansas professor of business economics, also suggests that a bias effect took place during the US Elections; the crowd was unwilling to believe in an outcome with Donald Trump winning and caused the prediction markets to turn into \\"an echo chamber\\", where the same information circulated and ultimately lead to a stagnant market. However, when compared to results from polls, prediction markets are generally more accurate by 74%. Other issues =Legality= Because online gambling is outlawed in the United States through federal laws and many state laws as well, most prediction markets that target US users operate with \\"play money\\" rather than \\"real money\\": they are free to play (no purchase necessary) and usually offer prizes to the best traders as incentives to participate. Notable exceptions are the Iowa Electronic Markets, which is operated by the University of Iowa under the cover of a no-action letter from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and PredictIt, which is operated by Victoria University of Wellington under cover of a similar no-action letter. =Controversial incentives= Some kinds of prediction markets may create controversial incentives. For example, a market predicting the death of a world leader might be quite useful for those whose activities are strongly related to this leader's policies, but it also might turn into an assassination market.a scenario described by Jim Bell in 1997. The incentives involved in practical markets are so low, however, that this is extremely unlikely. Applications of prediction markets There are a number of commercial and academic prediction markets operating publicly. =Public prediction markets= * The Iowa Electronic Markets is an academic market examining elections where positions are limited to $500. * PredictIt is a prediction market for political and financial events. * SciCast was a combinatorial prediction market focusing on science and technology forecasting. *iPredict was a prediction market in New Zealand. Specific types of prediction markets =Combinatorial prediction markets= A combinatorial prediction market is a type of prediction market where participants can make bets on combinations of outcomes. The advantage of making bets on combinations of outcomes is that, in theory, conditional information can be better incorporated into the market price. One difficulty of combinatorial prediction markets is that the number of possible combinatorial trades scales exponentially with the number of normal trades. For example, a market with merely 100 binary contracts would have 2^100 possible combinations of contracts. These exponentially large data structures can be too large for a computer to keep track of, so there have been efforts to develop algorithms and rules to make the data more tractable.

He saw labor movements not as narrow special interest groups but as instruments to advance social justice and human rights in democratic societies. He leveraged the UAW's resources and influence to advocate for workers' rights, civil rights, women's rights, universal health care, public education, affordable housing, environmental stewardship and nuclear nonproliferation around the world. He believed in Swedish-style social democracy and societal change through nonviolent civil disobedience. He survived two attempted assassinations, including one at home where he was struck by a 12-gauge shotgun blast fired through his kitchen window. He was the fourth and longest serving president of the UAW, serving from 1946 until his untimely death in 1970. As the leader of five million autoworkers including retirees and their families, Reuther was influential inside the Democratic Party. During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt frequently consulted Reuther, referring to him as \\"my young red-headed engineer.\\" He was considered by John F. Kennedy for Vice President in 1960. Following the Bay of Pigs in 1961, JFK sent Reuther to Cuba to negotiate a prisoner exchange with Fidel Castro. He was instrumental in spearheading the creation of the Peace Corps and in marshaling support for the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Medicare and Medicaid, and the Fair Housing Act. He met weekly in 1964 and 1965 with President Lyndon B. Johnson at the White House to discuss policies and legislation for the Great Society and War on Poverty. The Republican Party was wary of Reuther, leading presidential candidate Richard Nixon to say about John F. Kennedy during the 1960 election, \\"I can think of nothing so detrimental to this nation than for any President to owe his election to, and therefore be a captive of, a political boss like Walter Reuther.\\" Conservative politician Barry Goldwater declared that \\"[Reuther] was more dangerous to our country than Sputnik or anything Soviet Russia might do.\\" In 1955, Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. wrote, ‚ÄúWalter P. Reuther, the extraordinarily able and intelligent leader of the UAW, may well become in another decade the most powerful man in American politics.‚Äù A powerful ally of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights movement, Reuther marched with King in Detroit, Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Jackson. When King and others including children were jailed in Birmingham, Alabama, and King authored his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, Reuther arranged $160,000 for the protestors' release. He also helped organize and finance the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, delivering remarks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial shortly before King gave his historic \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech on the National Mall. An early supporter of Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers, he asked Robert F. Kennedy to visit and support Chavez. He served on the board of directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and was one of the founders of Americans for Democratic Action. A lifetime environmentalist, Reuther played a critical role in funding and organizing the first Earth Day on April 22, 1970. According to Denis Hayes, the principal national organizer of the first Earth Day, \\"Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!\\" Reuther was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1995 by President Bill Clinton, who remarked at the ceremony, \\"Walter Reuther was an American visionary so far ahead of his times that although he died a quarter of a century ago, our Nation has yet to catch up to his dreams.\\" Reuther was recognized by Time Magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of the 20th century. Murray Kempton, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, wrote, \\"Walter Reuther is the only man I have ever met who could reminisce about the future.\\" A. H. Raskin, labor editor of The New York Times, wrote, \\"If the speed of a man's mind could be measured in the same way as the speed of his legs, Walter Reuther would be an Olympic champion.\\" George Romney, Governor of Michigan, once said, \\"Walter Reuther is the most dangerous man in Detroit because no one is more skillful in bringing about the revolution without seeming to disrupt the existing forms of society.\\"  Early life and education  left Reuther was born on September 1, 1907, in Wheeling, West Virginia, to Anna (n√©e Stocker) and Valentine Reuther, who were German-Americans.http://www.biography.com/people/walter- reuther-21402271 His father Valentine was a horse-drawn beer wagon driver and Socialist union organizer who at age 11 had emigrated from Germany. Walter was one of five children, oldest to youngest: Ted, Walter, Roy, Victor, Christine. Valentine would facilitate debates every Sunday for his sons, training them to think on their feet about social issues of the day such as yellow journalism, child labor, women's suffrage, and civil rights. Reuther later recalled, \\"At my father's knee we learned the philosophy of trade unionism. We got the struggles, the hopes and the aspirations of working people every day.\\" As a child, he and Victor accompanied their father on a visit to a jail to meet Eugene V. Debs, who was being incarcerated for his pacifism during World War I. The Reuthers were frugal and learned not to waste. To save money, Walter's mother Anna would make underwear for her sons out of used flour sacks. When Valentine was partially blinded by an exploding bottle, Walter began doing odd jobs to bring in family income at the age of nine. He later dropped out of high school during his junior year and worked in a local factory to help support the family. He learned firsthand about inadequate worker safety when a 400 pound die that he and three other men were lifting fell and severed his big toe. From an early age, the Reuther boys received lessons on racism. One day they saw local boys throwing rocks at black people being transported north through their hometown in open railways cars. Their father gave them a stern warning to never treat another human being like that. The Reuther boys never forgot that lesson, spending the rest of their lives fighting for racial and economic equality for all people. = Left home for Detroit = alt= In 1927, at the age of 19, Reuther left Wheeling for Detroit and argued himself into an expert tool and die maker job at Ford Motor Company that required 25 years experience. The foreman was baffled that at his young age he could read blueprints and dies, becoming one of the highest paid mechanics in the factory. He finished high school while working at Ford and enrolled at Detroit City College, which is today known as Wayne State University. In 1932, he was fired for organizing a rally for Norman Thomas who was running for President of the United States as the nominee for the Socialist Party of America. His official Ford employment record states that he quit voluntarily, but Reuther himself maintained that he was fired for his increasingly visible socialist activities. Regardless, Walter and Victor decided it was the perfect time to fulfill their childhood dream and travel the world. = European trip = When Henry Ford retired the Model T in 1927, he sold the production mechanisms to Russia, and American workers who knew how to operate the equipment were needed. Walter and Victor were promised work teaching Russian workers how to run the machines and assembly line. With that employment assurance, the brothers embarked on a three-year adventure, first bicycling through Europe, then working in the auto plant in Gorky, Russia where the unheated factories were often 30‚Äì40 degrees Fahrenheit below zero. He frequently wrote letters to the Moscow Daily News criticizing the many inefficiencies associated with how the communists operated the plants. After almost two years in Russia, the brothers travelled through Turkey, Iran, India, and China. After crossing the China Sea, they finished their Far East tour by bicycling throughout Japan. Finally, after being gone from home for almost three years, they found work for passage on the steamship President Harding to San Francisco and hurried back to Detroit where their brother Roy was already deeply involved with organizing autoworkers. Walter later stated the world tour taught him that \\"all people long for the same basic human goals of a job with some degree of security, greater opportunity for their children, and of course, freedom. We felt we could make a contribution by helping American workers build strong and democratic labor unions. That's why we went into the labor movement.\\" =Political affiliation= The Reuther brothers' busts at the Walter and May Reuther UAW Family Education Center in northern Michigan. From left to right, Roy Reuther, Walter Reuther, and Victor Reuther.Before joining the Democratic Party, Reuther was a member of the Socialist Party of America. And, although Reuther always denied it, people including J. Edgar Hoover, have suspected that at one time he was a member of the Communist Party. On this subject, Reuther said in 1938, \\"I am not and never have been a member of the Communist Party nor a supporter of its policies nor subject to its control or influence in any way.\\" Nevertheless, people have suspected that he may have paid dues to the Communist Party for some months in 1935-36 and one source listed him as attending a Communist Party planning meeting as late as February 1939.Victor G. Devinatz, \\"Reassessing the Historical UAW: Walter Reuther's Affiliation with the Communist Party and Something of Its Meaning: A Document of Party Involvement, 1939.\\" Labour/Le Travail 49 (2002): 223-245. online and also online at JSTOR Devinatz says that he must have left the Party later in 1939. Reuther did cooperate with the Communists in the mid 1930s; this was the period of the Popular Front, and the Communist Party agreed with him on internal issues of the UAW; but his associations were with anti-Stalinist Socialists.Nelson Lichtenstein states, \\" Reuther worked very closely with the Communists during this period, but he did not actually join the party.\\" in Lichtenstein \\"Reuther the Red?\\" Labour/Le Travail 51 (2003) pp 165=69 at p 165. Reuther remained active in the Socialist Party and in 1937 failed in his attempt to be elected to the Detroit City Council when the AFL and blacks opposed his CIO ticket. However, impressed by the efforts by President Franklin D. Roosevelt to tackle inequality, he eventually joined the Democratic Party.  United Automobile Workers  = First victory against automobile companies = Sound car for West Side Local 174 used by Walter Reuther to organize UAW members Upon returning from Europe to Detroit, Reuther hitchhiked to South Bend, Indiana to attend the second annual convention as a delegate of the fledgling UAW. Upon his return he became president of newly formed Local 174 on Detroit's west side and with brother Victor, led the first successful strike against the automotive giants at Kelsey Hayes, which supplied brake drums and wheels to Ford Motor Company. The main complaint was the speed-up of the assembly line was intolerable. Workers were losing limbs and even their own lives trying in vain to keep up with the ever-increasing speed of the assembly line. It was December 1936 when the workers pulled a surprise strike and sat down in the plant refusing to leave until management negotiated with their representative, Walter Reuther. When management tried to enter the plant to remove the machinery, thousands of sympathizers swarmed the sidewalks and blocked the doorways. Ford needed those brake drums and wheels badly and after 10 days of striking the sides settled. The first major UAW victory to unionize the auto factories was won. Upon Reuther's insistence, women won equal pay for equal work: 75 cents an hour. The speed-up of the assembly line was slowed down and the company could not fire a worker for joining the union. UAW Local 174's membership expanded from 200 before the strike to 35,000 within the next year. = General Motors = alt= In 1936, General Motors (GM) was the largest corporation in the world and held many plants in Flint, Michigan, about 60 miles north of Detroit. Reuther's brother, Roy, was already in Flint drawing up strategy plans and organizing workers to shut down the automaker until it would recognize the rights of the workers to unionize. The strike began on New Year's Eve, December 31, 1936 when the workers sat down in the plants and refused to leave. General Motors retaliated by turning off the heat in the plant. In solidarity with the Flint strikers, Reuther led a strike at Detroit's Fleetwood Plant, where bodies were made for GM's luxury vehicle, the Cadillac. Support strikes were also called in Oakland, California, Pontiac, Michigan and St. Louis, Missouri. Autoworkers around the nation engaged in action in support of the Flint sit-down strikers. Back in Flint, the police tried to force the workers out of the plant in what became known as the \\"Battle of Bulls Run.\\" Over a hundred policemen attacked the pickets with tear gas and bullets, sending thirteen workers to the hospital with gunshot wounds. Victor manned the sound car and encouraged the workers to fight back, which they did by sling-shotting door hinges from the factory roof and turning fire hoses on the police in the 16-degree Fahrenheit winter night. Victor and Genora Johnson, a leader of the Women's Brigade, took turns in the sound car exhorting the workers to stand their ground. Michigan Governor, Frank Murphy, called in 2,000 members of the National Guard, not to force the workers out of the plants, but to keep the peace. After a brilliant move, the workers were able to gain control of the only plant in the country that made Chevrolet engines. Finally, 44 days later, General Motors was forced to recognize the worker's right to unionize and signed its first collective bargaining agreement with the fledgling UAW. The Flint Sit-Down Strike has become known as the Lexington and Valley Forge of American industrial unionism. Roy recalled, \\"When the boys came out of the plants, I never saw a night like that and perhaps will never see it again. I liken it to a country experiencing independence, families reunited for the first time since the strike began, kids hanging onto daddy with tears of joy and happiness. It was a sea of humanity in which fears were no longer on the minds of the workers.\\" In 1950, Reuther negotiated and signed with Charlie Wilson, chief executive officer of General Motors, the Treaty of Detroit, an historic five-year labor contract that, in exchange for a commitment not to strike, gave rank-and-file workers better wages, health care, and pensions. At the time, Fortune Magazine wrote that the Treaty of Detroit ‚Äúmade the worker to an amazing degree a middle class member of a middle class society.‚Äù = Chrysler = Chrysler was next on the list of the young UAW. In March 1937, 60,000 Chrysler workers went on strike. When police started roughing up pickets and strikers, over 150,000 citizens gathered at Detroit's downtown Cadillac Square where Reuther and others led them in protest. After a four-week strike, Chrysler followed General Motors‚Äô lead and negotiated its first collective bargaining agreement with the UAW. = Ford Motor Company = Henry Ford had stated that he would never allow his workers to unionize. His main enforcer was Harry Bennett, who led a 3,000 man Security Department for Ford Motor Company, whose mandate was to intimidate, beat, and fire any worker who showed signs of favoring unionization. In 1932, when workers marched out of the giant Ford River Rouge Complex in protest to the speed-up of the assembly lines, they were attacked by Bennett's armed men and 5 workers were shot dead and hundreds suffered injuries. Battle of the Overpass, May 26, 1937, Walter Reuther fifth from left, Richard Frankensteen sixth from left Barely a month after the Chrysler signing, Reuther got permission from the City of Dearborn to pass out handbills titled, \\"Unionism, not Fordism\\" on public property at Gate Four of the giant Ford River Rouge Complex. As he and three other UAW leaders climbed the stairs to the bridge, they were attacked by Bennett's \\"enforcers\\" who severely beat them. Reuther was instantly surrounded by at least a dozen men, knocked to the ground, kicked and punched in the head and body, picked up 4 feet parallel to the ground then slammed to the concrete repeatedly, then thrown and kicked down 3 flights of stairs. The pummeling continued as 4 or 5 men beat him in and out of parked cars, until a streetcar arrived with union women to pass out leaflets and the thugs turned their attention to viciously attack them. Press photographers were attacked as well and their camera's confiscated but one camera was inconspicuously thrown into a convertible and the next day, the \\"Battle of the Overpass,\\" was national news. The beatings taken by the union organizers in the long run hurt Henry Ford more, as national sentiment turned against him. Time magazine published the photographs with descriptions of how the union men and women were mercilessly beaten by Henry Ford's paid thugs. Ford retaliated against Time, Life, and Fortune magazines by withdrawing all advertising. It took four more years, but finally, in 1941, Henry Ford signed his first agreement with the UAW. Shortly after, Henry Ford told Walter Reuther: \\"It was one of the most sensible things Harry Bennett ever did when he got the UAW into this plant.\\" Reuther inquired, \\"What do you mean?\\" Ford replied, \\"Well, you've been fighting General Motors and the Wall Street crowd. Now you're in here and we've given you a union shop and more than you got out of them. That puts you on our side, doesn't it? We can fight General Motors and Wall Street together, eh?\\" In the 1950s, Reuther and Henry Ford II, CEO of Ford, toured a state-of-the-art engine plant in Cleveland. As they walked about the plant, Ford gestured to the cutting-edge, automated machines, saying, \\"Walter, how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues?\\" Without missing a beat, Reuther famously replied: \\"Henry, how are you going to get them to buy your cars?\\" = \\"500 Planes a Day\\" = In 1940, in the midst of World War II, the United States was producing fighter planes to help the allies in their war against Hitler's aggression. The production was slow, inadequate, and threatening the security of the Allies. The US planned to construct new manufacturing plants specifically to produce more planes. That plan, however, would have taken two years to begin producing planes. The Allies did not have that time to spare. In response, Reuther proposed \\"to transform the entire unused capacity of the auto industry into one huge plane production unit capable of turning out 500 Planes a Day.\\" After getting the support of workers, he publicly announced the \\"Reuther Plan: 500 Planes a Day,\\" shortly before Christmas, 1940. He said, during a national radio address on December 28, 1940: > In London they are huddled in the subways praying for aid from America. In > America we are huddled over blueprints praying that Hitler will be obliging > enough to postpone an \\"all out\\" attack on England for another two years > until new plants finally begin to turn out engines and aircraft. We believe > that without disturbing present aircraft plant production schedules we can > supplement them by turning out 500 planes a day of a single standard > fighting model by the use of idle automotive capacity. . . . England's > battles, it used to be said, were won on the playing fields of Eton. > America's can be won on the assembly lines of Detroit. Give England planes > and there will be no need to give her men. A week after receiving the plan, on December 30, 1940, President Roosevelt wrote William S. Knudsen, chairman of the War Production Board, \\"It is well worthwhile to give a good deal of attention to this (Reuther) program.\\" Three days later on January 2, 1941, Reuther met with President Roosevelt at the White House to discuss the possibility of implementing his plan for 500 Planes a Day. Reuther with President Dwight Eisenhower and other labor leaders at AFL-CIO building dedication, June 4, 1956 General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler all opposed the Reuther Plan because they wanted the government to build new plane and tank factories that could be sold to them at giveaway prices after the war. They also disliked that labor had the audacity to stick their nose into production, which they felt was management's exclusive domain. Alfred P. Sloan, chairman of General Motors, scoffed at the idea, stating, \\"only about 10 to 15% of the machinery and equipment in an automobile factory can be utilized for the production of special defense material.\\" After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, many of Reuther's proposals were implemented. Detroit's automobile plants produced planes and tanks in mass volume and became known as the center of the Arsenal of Democracy, which gave the Allies a decisive advantage to win the war. By 1943, Chrysler President, K. T. Keller, reported that his company had converted 89% of its machine tools to wartime production, leading Washington Post publisher, Phil Graham, to state that meant Reuther was 89% right. At the war's end, Fortune magazine wrote: \\"Reuther was right on track. Compared with many industrialists that sat back and hugged profits and the aimless agencies of Washington, the red-headed labor leader exhibited atomic spirit of action. He never let up.\\" In 1953, President Eisenhower wrote in a letter to Reuther, \\"When I last addressed a CIO Convention, I came to thank you for your magnificent performance in World War II in supplying the planes and tanks and ships and arms. You did your job, and you did it well.\\" = Elected UAW president = After the war ended in 1945, Reuther proved he would be a different type of labor leader when he led a strike challenging GM to increase workers wages by 30% without increasing the price of their new cars. Worker pay had been restricted during World War II and Reuther sought to get them a raise but not at the cost of increased inflation. Historically, when workers won a pay increase, the company would pass on the expense to their consumers. GM refused the pay increase and after a 113-day strike, the sides settled on an eighteen and a half cent hourly raise. Reuther's bold collective bargaining leadership in this strike catapulted him into the union's top position.Walter Reuther meeting with Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India, in October 1949.On March 27, 1946, Reuther won the election and became the president of the UAW in a very close race, defeating incumbent UAW president R. J. Thomas by a mere 124 votes, out of almost 9,000 cast. The new UAW president pledged his vision of \\"a labor movement whose philosophy is to fight for the welfare of the public at large.\\" One of his first acts as president was to fight to integrate the American Bowling League, which had previously excluded black bowlers. He was a new kind of leader who viewed the labor movement as \\"an instrument for social change.\\"  Salary  Although presidents of much smaller unions were making 3 or 4 times his salary, Reuther purposely kept his salary low to stay in touch, and show solidarity, with UAW members he represented. He never made an annual salary of more than $31,000. Author David Halberstam writes: \\"His life was not about material things. The constant success of the union was reward enough.\\" = Expelling Communism from organized labor = Eleanor Roosevelt, Walter Reuther, Milton Eisenhower and the Cuban prisoner exchange delegation in Washington, D.C. The following 18 months after Reuther's election win, bitter battles erupted inside the UAW as Communist-backers of R. J. Thomas had a two- thirds majority on the UAW's Executive Board. One observer noted, \\"The Commies threw everything but their hammer and sickle at Walter.\\" In November 1947, at the next UAW national convention, this time Reuther won the election overwhelmingly, severely weakening the Communist's hold on the union's leadership. Life magazine reported that Reuther's victory was \\"the biggest setback of all time for the Communists in the American Labor Movement.\\" = President of Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) = Reuther became president of the CIO in 1952 until its merger with the AFL in 1955, and continued as head of the UAW until his death, which left the AFL-CIO in 1968. As president of the CIO, Reuther sought to remove officers from Communist- dominated unions within the CIO, leading Hubert Humphrey to write,\\", Communist infiltration of the CIO was a direct threat to the survival of all of our country's democratic institutions. The CIO's victory over the Communist party was a significant victory for our nation.\\" In response, Trud, a Soviet newspaper, called Reuther a \\"traitor and strikebreaker\\" and a favorite of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Republican Party called Reuther \\"the most dangerous man in America and a Communist.\\" Despite removing Communists from the labor movement, J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, never stopped labeling Reuther a Communist for working in Russia and having early associations with Communists and Socialists. During World War II, J. Edgar Hoover considered subjecting Reuther, and his brothers Victor and Roy, to custodial detention. In 1959, at the request of the United States Department of State, Reuther met with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to discuss, among other things, capitalism versus communism, organized labor, and US-Russia relations. The meeting happened in San Francisco at the Mark Hopkins Hotel and was front-page international news. Later when Khrushchev met with President Kennedy at the Vienna Summit in 1961, he told Kennedy, \\"We hung the likes of Reuther in Russia in 1917.\\" = Collective bargaining = Walter Reuther with President Truman in the Oval Office, 1952 As president of the UAW, Reuther negotiated contracts that included unprecedented standard-of- living increases for automobile workers. Such increases include annual raises based on productivity advances, cost-of-living increases, supplementary unemployment benefits, early-retirement options, and health and welfare benefits. He employed a strategy called \\"pattern bargaining\\" against the Big Three automobile manufacturers, General Motors, Ford Motor Company, and Chrysler. He would first target a company that seemed most likely to accept his bargaining objective. If that target company refused offer concessions, Reuther would threaten a strike to halt production at its plants only while allowing production operations at its competitors' plants to go uninterrupted. As a result, the target company would accept Reuther's demands to prevent its competitors from absorbing its sales and market share. Once he secured the initial agreement, he would use it as a pattern against the other automobile companies, threatening to strike if they too did not match the same terms to which the initial target company agreed. Reuther employed pattern bargaining to leverage competition among automobile manufacturers, maximize the influence of labor, and reduce the frequency of costly strikes.  Ideas, activism, and political stances  = Peace Corps = In 1950, Reuther proposed, in an article titled, \\"A Proposal for a Total Peace Offensive,\\" that the United States establish a voluntary agency for young Americans to be sent around the world to fulfill humanitarian and development objectives. Subsequently, throughout the 1950s, Reuther gave speeches to the following effect: > I have been saying for a long time that I believe the more young Americans > who are trained to join with other young people in the world to be sent > abroad with slide rule, textbook, and medical kit to help people help > themselves with the tools of peace, the fewer young people will need to be > sent with guns and weapons of war. In August 1960, following the 1960 Democratic National Convention, Walter Reuther visited John F. Kennedy at the Kennedy compound in Hyannisport to discuss Kennedy's platform and staffing of a future administration. It was there that Reuther got Kennedy to commit to creating the executive agency that would become the Peace Corps. Under Reuther's leadership, the United Auto Workers had earlier that summer put together a policy platform that included a \\"youth peace corps\\" to be sent to developing nations. Subsequently, at the urging of Reuther, John F. Kennedy announced the idea for such an organization on October 14, 1960, at a late-night campaign speech at the University of Michigan. = Civil rights activism = Civil rights leaders with Vice President Johnson and Attorney General Robert Kennedy at the White House on June 22, 1963. Leaders of the March on Washington posing in front of the statue of Abraham Lincoln on August 28, 1963Leaders of the March on Washington on August 28, 1963Reuther was a strong supporter of the Civil Rights Movement. He marched with King in Selma, Birmingham, Montgomery, and Jackson and when King and others were jailed in Birmingham, Alabama, and King authored his famous Letter from Birmingham Jail, Reuther arranged $160,000 for the protestors' release. He also helped organize and finance the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, delivering remarks from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial shortly before King gave his historic \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. He served on the board of directors for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Under his leadership, the UAW donated $75,000 in 1954 to help underwrite the NAACP's efforts‚Äîled by Thurgood Marshall‚Äîbefore the Supreme Court in the landmark case of Brown v. Board of Education. According to King, Reuther sent letters to all of his local unions in 1957, requesting members to attend and provide financial support to the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in Washington, D.C. On the 25th anniversary of the UAW, King wrote a letter to Reuther, congratulating him on his successes and observing: > More than anyone else in America, you stand out as the shining symbol of > democratic trade unionism. Through trials, efforts and your unswerving > devotion to humanitarian causes, you have made life more meaningful for > millions of working people. Through moments of difficulty and strong > obstacles, you have stood firm for what you believe, knowing that in the > long run 'Truth crushed to earth will rise again.' As I have heard you say, > the true measure of a man is where he stands in moments of challenge and > controversy, when the only consolation he gains is the quiet whisper of an > inner voice saying there are things so eternally true and significant that > they are worth dying for, if necessary. You have demonstrated over the years > that you can stand up in moments of challenge and controversy. One day all > of America will be proud of your achievements, and will record your work as > one of the glowing epics of our heritage. In the early 1930s, Reuther first challenged racism as a student at what is now Wayne State University. When a local hotel, which had agreed with the college to let students use its swimming pool, refused to let blacks swim, he organized a picket line. The protest surrounded the block. As a result, the hotel closed its pool to all students. In a 2013 interview with The New York Times, President Barack Obama said, > \\"When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it > wasn‚Äôt just folks who believed in racial equality; it was people who > believed in working folks having a fair shot. It was Walter Reuther and the > UAW coming down here because they understood that if there are some workers > who are not getting a fair deal then ultimately that‚Äôs going to undercut > their ability to get a fair deal.\\"  Walk to Freedom, 1963  The Walk to Freedom was a mass march during the Civil Rights Movement on June 23, 1963 in Detroit, Michigan. The purpose of the demonstration was to protest racism, segregation, and the brutality inflicted upon civil rights activists in the South as well as the discrimination facing African-Americans in the North such as inequality in hiring, wages, education, and housing. In some ways, it was considered a dress rehearsal for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, which was scheduled for two months later. An estimated 125,000 people attended and it was the largest civil rights demonstration in the nation's history up to that date. Reuther mobilized support for the protest and donated office space at the UAW's headquarters Solidarity House for Martin Luther King, Jr. to organize the event. Along with others, including King, Reuther marched down Woodward Avenue and delivered remarks afterwards at Cobo Hall. It was there that King delivered his first version of his \\"I Have a Dream,\\" speech, having penned it, at least partially, inside his office at Solidarity House.  March on Washington, 1963  271x271pxThe March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom was held in Washington, D.C. on Wednesday, August 28, 1963. The protest sought to advocate for the civil and economic rights of African Americans. Along with the Big Six and three white religious leaders, Reuther helped organize the march. Originally, the march was planned to take place outside of the Capitol Building. Reuther, however, persuaded the other organizers to move the march to the Lincoln Memorial. He believed the Lincoln Memorial would be less threatening to Congress and the occasion would be more appropriate underneath the gaze of Abraham Lincoln's statue. The committee, notably Rustin, agreed to move the site on the condition that Reuther pay for a $19,000 sound system so that everyone on the National Mall could hear the speakers and musicians. Reuther and the UAW financed bus transportation for 5,000 of its rank-and-file members, providing the largest single contingent from any organization. The UAW also paid for and brought thousands of signs for marchers to carry. Among other things, the signs read: \\"There Is No Halfway House on the Road to Freedom,\\" \\"Equal Rights and Jobs NOW,\\" \\"UAW Supports Freedom March,\\" \\"in Freedom we are Born, in Freedom we must Live,\\" and \\"Before we'll be a Slave, we'll be Buried in our Grave.\\" Reuther was the most prominent white organizer scheduled to speak. In his remarks, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he urged Americans to pressure their politicians to act to address racial injustices. He said: > American democracy is on trial in the eyes of the world‚Ä¶ We cannot > successfully preach democracy in the world unless we first practice > democracy at home. American democracy will lack the moral credentials and be > both unequal to and unworthy of leading the forces of freedom against the > forces of tyranny unless we take bold, affirmative, adequate steps to bridge > the moral gap between American democracy's noble promises and its ugly > practices in the field of civil rights. According to Irving Bluestone, who was standing near the platform while Reuther delivered his remarks, he overheard two black women talking. One asked, \\"Who is that white man?\\" The other replied, \\"Don't you know him? That's the white Martin Luther King.\\" After the march, the civil rights leaders met with President Kennedy at the White House to discuss civil rights legislation. During the meeting, Reuther described to Kennedy how he was framing the civil rights issue to business leaders in Detroit, saying, \\"Look, you can't escape the problem. And there are two ways of resolving it; either by reason or riots.\\" Reuther continued, \\"Now the civil war that this is gonna trigger is not gonna be fought at Gettysburg. It's gonna to be fought in your backyard, in your plant, where your kids are growing up.\\" Kennedy and Johnson with organizers of the \\"March on Washington\\" at the White House on August 28, 1963  Selma voting rights movement and \\"Bloody Sunday,\\" 1965  On March 9, 1965, two days after Bloody Sunday, where civil rights marchers were beaten by state police at the Edmond Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, Reuther sent a telegram to President Johnson, reading in part: > Americans of all religious faiths, of all political persuasions, and from > every section of our Nation are deeply shocked and outraged at the tragic > events in Selma Ala., and they look to the Federal Government as the only > possible source to protect and guarantee the exercise of constitutional > rights, which is being denied and destroyed by the Dallas County law > enforcement agents and the Alabama State troops under the direction of > Governor George Wallace. Under these circumstances, Mr President, I join in > urging you to take immediate and appropriate steps including the use of > Federal marshals and troops if necessary, so that the full exercise of > constitutional rights including free assembly and free speech be fully > protected. Sunday's spectacle of tear gas and night sticks, whips, and > electric cattle prods used against defenseless citizens demonstrating to > secure their constitutional right to register and vote as American citizens > was an outrage against all decency. This shameful brutality by law enforcing > agents makes a mockery of Americans‚Äô concepts of justice and provides > effective ammunition to Communist propaganda and our enemies around the > world who would weaken and destroy us. Following the death of Unitarian Universalist minister James Reeb, a memorial service was held at the Brown's Chapel AME Church on March 15. Among those who addressed the packed congregation were Reuther, King, and some clergymen. A picture of King, Reuther, Greek Orthodox Archbishop Iakovos and others in Selma for Jeeb's memorial service appeared on the cover of Life magazine on March 26, 1965. After the memorial service, upon getting permission from the courts, the leaders and attendees marched from the church to the Dallas County Courthouse in Selma.  Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers, 1965  In December 1965, Reuther visited Cesar Chavez and the striking grape growers in Delano, California. Two months earlier, Reuther's brother and colleague, Roy, had visited the striking farmworkers. Upon returning from his visit, Roy urged Walter to support Chavez. At that time, Chavez's struggle for workers' rights was little known to the American public, but Reuther's visit garnered national media attention, making it difficult for the growers to ignore the striking grape pickers. During the trip, Reuther marched with Chavez and his fellow strikers, carrying picket signs reading \\"Huelga.\\" Reuther also spoke to packed union hall, declaring, \\"This is not your strike, this is our strike!\\" He pledged that the UAW would provide $7,500 per month to the United Farm Workers' strike fund for the duration of the strike. Upon returning to Detroit, Reuther contacted Senator Robert F. Kennedy, who was on the Senate Labor Committee, requesting that Kennedy visit Chavez in Delano to learn about and support the farmworkers. Kennedy obliged, ultimately becoming the most visible supporter of the farmworkers' movement. Reuther visited Chavez many times, including once during Chavez's hunger strike. During that visit, Reuther made a $50,000 donation to Chavez's struggle to which Chavez said, \\"Walter, you have given me great confidence.\\" Reuther replied, \\"You will prevail for your cause is just.\\" In honor of the Reuther brothers' early and sustained support, the United Farm Workers named a building at their Delano headquarters the \\"Roy Reuther Administration Building.\\"  March Against Fear, 1966  Following the shooting of civil rights activist James Meredith, the first African-American to attend the segregated University of Mississippi, Reuther and his wife May traveled from Chicago to Jackson, Mississippi to march with King and his wife Coretta, among other civil rights activists. Reuther brought 10 buses full of union supporters.  Memphis sanitation strike, 1968  On April 8, four days after King's assassination, Reuther marched with Coretta Scott King and others in Memphis, Tennessee, in support of a peaceful resolution of the city's sanitation strike. In addition, Reuther donated $50,000 from the UAW to the striking sanitation workers, which was the largest financial contribution by any outside source. = Environmentalism = Reuther sought to build an environmental movement made up of all classes of society to address social, ecological, aesthetic, and resource-conservation issues. In 1965, the UAW organized a \\"United Action for Clean Water Conference\\" in Detroit, where Reuther called for the \\"beginning of a massive mobilization of citizens . . . of a popular crusade not only for clean water, but also for cleaning up the atmosphere, the highways, the junkyards and the slums and for creating a total living environment worthy of free men.\\" In 1967, three years before the first Earth Day, Reuther established the Department of Conservation and Resource Development, later headed by Olga Madar, to combat pollution, including automobile emissions. In 1968, speaking at the annual conference of the Water Pollution Control Federation, Reuther stated: \\"If we continue to destroy our living environment by polluting our streams and poisoning our air . . . We may be the first civilization in the history of man that will have suffocated and been strangled in the waste of its material affluence‚Äîcompounded by social indifference and social neglect.\\" At the annual UAW convention in 1970 in Atlantic City, Reuther said: \\"Because industry has for so long polluted the environment of the plants in which we work and has now created an environmental crisis of catastrophic proportions in the communities in which we live, the UAW will insist on discussing the implications of this crisis at the bargaining table.\\"  Earth Day  Reuther made the first donation to support the first Earth Day in 1970 in the amount of $2,000. Under his leadership, the UAW also funded telephone capabilities for organizers to communicate and coordinate with each other from across the United States. The UAW also financed, printed, and mailed all of the literature and other materials for the first Earth Day and mobilized its membership to participate in the public demonstrations across the country. According to Denis Hayes, the chief national coordinator of the first Earth Day, ‚ÄúThe UAW was by far the largest contributor to the first Earth Day\\" and \\"Without the UAW, the first Earth Day would have likely flopped!‚Äù Hayes further said, ‚ÄúWalter‚Äôs presence at our first press conference utterly changed the dynamics of the coverage‚Äîwe had instant credibility.‚Äù Following Reuther's death less than one month after the first Earth Day, the organizers of Environmental Action, the key group that organized the first Earth Day, dedicated a book containing a collection of speeches from Earth Day to Reuther, saying ‚ÄúWe would like to pay tribute to Walter Reuther, a friend and ally in the movement for peace, justice, and a livable environment. We admired his courage and his foresight, and we are deeply grateful for the help he gave us.‚Äù = Filibuster = In 1957, during a speech before the annual convention of the NAACP, Reuther coined the United States Senate \\"the graveyard of civil rights legislation,\\" and called for the abolishment of the body's filibuster.  Assassination attempts  In 1938, gunmen barged into Reuther's apartment in an attempt to kidnap and murder the labor leader. The criminals were thwarted by a small group of Reuther friends and relatives. Nobody was injured. leftOn April 20, 1948, Reuther barely survived a double-barrel shotgun blast that ripped through his kitchen window as he was preparing a late evening snack. As the gunshot went off at 9:48 p.m. E.S.T.,United Press, ‚ÄúReuther Shot in Detroit Home - Auto Union Official Victim of Ambush,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday April 21, 1948, Volume LIV, Number 201, page 2. Reuther happened to turn toward his wife, and was hit in his right arm instead of the chest and heart.Pietrusza, David, 1948: Harry Truman's Improbable Victory and the Year That Transformed America, Union Square Press, 2011, p. 153 Four slugs of the type used to kill large game had shattered his right arm into 150 pieces of bone. Another slug pierced his back and exited out his stomach. The assailant ‚Äúfled in a bright red four-door Ford sedan, police said.‚ÄùUnited Press, ‚ÄúUnknown Assailant Wounds Reuther, Auto Union Head - Labor Leader Hit in Arm, Shoulder by Shotgun Blast Through Kitchen Window,‚Äù The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Wednesday April 21, 1948, Volume LIV, Number 201, page 1. Reuther, who did not lose consciousness, cursed his attacker as he was initially being treated by his next-door-neighbor, a doctor, as he lay on the kitchen floor. ‚Äú‚ÄòThose dirty sons of bitches!‚Äô Reuther cried. ‚ÄòThey have to shoot a man in the back. They won‚Äôt come out in the open and fight.‚Äô‚Äù As doctors fought to save his life, he became infected with malaria and hepatitis from blood transfusions. Through months of therapy, he regained partial use of his right arm, but for the rest of his life had to train himself to write and shake with his left hand. When Attorney General, Tom Clark, requested J. Edgar Hoover to get the FBI to investigate the shooting, Hoover refused, stating, \\"I'm not going to send in the FBI every time some nigger woman gets raped.\\" The shooting was never solved. Thirteen months after the attack, Reuther's brother Victor was almost killed by a similar shooting from a double-barrel shotgun. The blast traveled through his living room window and hit him in the face, throat, and chest. Victor's right eye had been shot out and had to be removed. Victor said, \\"The attack on me was a way of serving notice to Walter. 'We didn't get you yet, but we're still around.'\\" The shooting of Victor was also never solved. In the wake of both shootings, Eleanor Roosevelt wrote: \\"It seems unthinkable that the police have never been able to discover who shot Walter Reuther and because of that, in all probability, the same person perhaps has felt he could get away with shooting another brother. . . . [W]e have a right to protect men who are working in the interests of their fellow men.\\"  Death  Walter and May Reuther eternal flame at the UAW Black Lake Conference Center in northern Michigan. On May 9, 1970, Walter Reuther, his wife May, architect Oscar Stonorov, Reuther's bodyguard William Wolfman, the pilot and co-pilot were killed when their chartered Learjet 23 crashed in flames at 9:33 p.m. Eastern Time. The plane, arriving from Detroit in rain and fog, was on final approach to Pellston Regional Airport in Pellston, Michigan, near the UAW's recreational and educational facility at Black Lake, Michigan.planecrashinfo.com Famous People Who Died in Aviation Accidents: 1970s The National Transportation Safety Board discovered that the plane's altimeter was missing parts, some incorrect parts were installed, and one of its parts had been installed upside down, leading some to speculate that Reuther may have been murdered.See Michael Parenti, \\"The Wonderful Life and Strange Death of Walter Reuther,\\" Dirty Truths (City Lights Books, 1996), page 201. Reuther had been subjected earlier to two attempted assassinations. Historian Michael Parenti wrote, ‚ÄúReuther‚Äôs demise appears as part of a truncation of liberal and radical leadership that included the deaths of four national figures: President John Kennedy, Malcom X, Martin Luther King, and Senator Robert Kennedy.‚Äù = Funeral = Reuther's funeral was held on May 15, 1970, at Ford Auditorium in Detroit, Michigan. An estimated 3,400 people were in attendance. Among others, Coretta Scott King eulogized: > Walter Reuther was to black people, the most widely known and respected > white labor leader in the nation. He was there when the storm clouds were > thick. We remember him in Montgomery. He was in Birmingham. He marched with > us in Selma, and Jackson, Mississippi and in Washington. ... Only yesterday, > there he was again in Charleston, South Carolina, the leader of a million > and a half workers giving personal support to a strike of only 400 black > women. ... He was a big man, so of course he had enemies and detractors. He > had the courage to be with the minority when it was right. He was a simple > man in his personal life, a rare quality in these flamboyant times ... but > if his ways were simple, his ideas were grand. He aroused the imagination of > millions. ... He was fighting the fight of the whole world.  Personal life  Walter and May Reuther were married on March 13, 1936, after meeting on a streetcar in Detroit only six weeks earlier. They had two daughters, Linda born in 1942 and Elisabeth in 1947. Reuther led a simple, austere lifestyle. He neither smoked nor drank alcohol because he felt it sapped a person's vitality. For his daily lunch in his office he had the same menu: a sandwich and a cup of tea. He was an early riser. Author William Manchester wrote that Reuther's associates saw him as a ‚Äútrue ascetic.‚Äù To relax he liked to hike, fish and play tennis. His favorite music was German Lieder, Classical, Negro Spirituals and Union Songs. Although sometimes perceived as rigid with no sense of humor, Walter‚Äôs colleague and friend Irving Bluestone said: ‚ÄúThat wasn't true at all. He was a very easy person to work with and be with. He had a good sense of humor and could laugh at himself. And occasionally, when he was excited enough, he would use profanity just like anyone else coming out of the shop.‚Äù Reuther enjoyed being and working outdoors in nature. Whether building a fish ladder for the trout underneath their bridge or planting a Japanese Garden for May that she could view outside their bedroom window, he enjoyed and relaxed by working on outdoor projects on his Paint Creek property, located outside Rochester, Michigan. He and his daughter Lisa planted an arboretum, including over 50 types of trees, at their Paint Creek home. He was an expert woodworker and built much of the furniture for their home with his own hands. After the assassination attempt in 1948, which shattered his arm in 150 pieces, he rehabilitated his arm by squeezing a hard rubber ball and pushing out the walls to build their Paint Creek home from what had been a one-room cottage. He remarked, ‚ÄúI got a good house and a good hand, all for the same money.‚Äù May was Walter's sounding board and close advisor throughout his public life. May was a teacher and involved in organizing a teachers‚Äô union. Early on she was making $60 a week of which she gave most to help organize auto workers into the fledgling UAW. She soon gave up her teaching career to become Walter's full-time secretary, earning $15 per week. She was active in many charities and programs to uplift the community. May marched side-by-side with Walter in the civil rights struggles in Selma and elsewhere. She hosted Eleanor Roosevelt at their Paint Creek home. She also served as president of the PTA at their daughter's school. After the assassination attempt on Walter's life in 1948, May decided to spend most of her time at home trying to give their two daughters as normal a life as possible; although, the family had bodyguards and attack dogs living with them the rest of their lives.Walter Reuther statue located at the Walter and May Reuther UAW Family Education Center in Black Lake, Michigan.

She is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Lutheran, and Eastern Orthodox churches. She is one of eight women (including Saint Mary) explicitly commemorated by Roman Catholics in the Canon of the Mass. Her traditional feast day, known in Europe as Saint Lucia's Day, is observed by Western Christians on 13 December. Lucia of Syracuse was honored in the Middle Ages and remained a well-known saint in early modern England.Findlay, Allison. Women in Shakespeare: A Dictionary 2010 p. 234 \\"(b) The play's setting in Ephesus and its links to Syracuse suggest that, in addition to its associations with light, Luciana's name might invoke memories of St Lucia of Syracuse, who remained a well-known saint in early modern England...\\" Sources The oldest record of her story comes from the fifth-century Acts of the Martyrs. The single fact upon which various accounts agree is that a disappointed suitor accused Lucy of being a Christian, and she was executed in Syracuse, Sicily, in the year 304 during the Diocletianic Persecution. Her veneration spread to Rome, and by the sixth century to the whole Church. The oldest archaeological evidence comes from the Greek inscriptions from the Catacombs of St. John in Syracuse. Jacobus de Voragine's Legenda Aurea was the most widely read version of the Lucy legend in the Middle Ages. In medieval accounts, Saint Lucy's eyes were gouged out prior to her execution. Life All the details of her life are the conventional ones associated with female martyrs of the early fourth century. John Henry Blunt views her story as a Christian romance similar to the Acts of other virgin martyrs.Blunt, John Henry Blunt. The Annotated Book of Common Prayer, London, 1885:176 According to the traditional story, Lucy was born of rich and noble parents about the year 283. Her father was of Roman origin, but died when she was five years old, leaving Lucy and her mother without a protective guardian. Her mother's name Eutychia seems to indicate that she came from a Greek background. Like many of the early martyrs, Lucy had consecrated her virginity to God, and she hoped to distribute her dowry to the poor. However, Eutychia, not knowing of Lucy's promise, and suffering from a bleeding disorder, feared for Lucy's future. She arranged Lucy's marriage to a young man of a wealthy pagan family. Eutychia and Lucy at the Tomb of Saint Agatha, by Jacobello del Fiore Saint Agatha had been martyred 52 years before during the Decian persecution. Her shrine at Catania, less than 50 miles from Syracuse, attracted a number of pilgrims; many miracles were reported to have happened through her intercession. Eutychia was persuaded to make a pilgrimage to Catania, in hopes of a cure. While there, St. Agatha came to Lucy in a dream and told her that because of her faith her mother would be cured and that Lucy would be the glory of Syracuse, as she was of Catania. With her mother cured, Lucy took the opportunity to persuade her mother to allow her to distribute a great part of her riches among the poor. Eutychia suggested that the sums would make a good bequest, but Lucy countered, \\"...whatever you give away at death for the Lord's sake you give because you cannot take it with you. Give now to the true Savior, while you are healthy, whatever you intended to give away at your death.\\" News that the patrimony and jewels were being distributed came to Lucy's betrothed, who denounced her to Paschasius, the Governor of Syracuse. Paschasius ordered her to burn a sacrifice to the emperor's image. When she refused, Paschasius sentenced her to be defiled in a brothel. The Christian tradition states that when the guards came to take her away, they could not move her even when they hitched her to a team of oxen. Bundles of wood were then heaped about her and set on fire, but would not burn. Finally, she met her death by the sword thrust into her throat. Lucy Before the Judge, by Lorenzo Lotto, 1523‚Äì32 Absent in the early narratives and traditions, at least until the fifteenth century, is the story of Lucia tortured by eye-gouging. According to later accounts, before she died she foretold the punishment of Paschasius and the speedy end of the persecution, adding that Diocletian would reign no more, and Maximian would meet his end. This so angered Paschasius that he ordered the guards to remove her eyes. Another version has Lucy taking her own eyes out in order to discourage a persistent suitor who admired them. This is one of the reasons that Lucy is the patron saint of those with eye illnesses. When her body was prepared for burial in the family mausoleum it was discovered that her eyes had been miraculously restored. Veneration By the sixth century, her story was sufficiently widespread that she appears in the Sacramentary of Pope Gregory I. She is also commemorated in the ancient Roman Martyrology. St. Aldhelm (English, died in 709) and later the Venerable Bede (English, died in 735) attest that her popularity had already spread to England, where her festival was kept in England until the Protestant Reformation, as a holy day of the second rank in which no work but tillage or the like was allowed. Sigebert of Gembloux wrote a mid-eleventh century passio, to support a local cult of Lucy at Metz.Sigibert von Gembloux, Acta Sanctae Luciae. Ed. Tino Licht. (Editiones Heidelbergenses, vol. 34.) Heidelberg: Winter, 2007. The General Roman Calendar formerly had a commemoration of Saints Lucy and Geminianus on 16 September. This was removed in 1969, as a duplication of the feast of her dies natalis on 13 December and because the Geminianus in question, mentioned in the Passio of Saint Lucy, seems to be a fictitious figure,Calendarium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 1969), p. 139 unrelated to the Geminianus whose feast is on 31 January. =Relics= Saint Lucy by Domenico Beccafumi, 1521, a High Renaissance recasting of a Gothic iconic image (Pinacoteca Nazionale, Siena) Sigebert (1030‚Äì1112), a monk of Gembloux, in his sermo de Sancta Lucia, chronicled that her body lay undisturbed in Sicily for 400 years, before Faroald II, Duke of Spoleto, captured the island and transferred the body to Corfinium in the Abruzzo, Italy. From there it was removed by the Emperor Otho I in 972 to Metz and deposited in the church of St. Vincent. It was from this shrine that an arm of the saint was taken to the monastery of Luitburg in the Diocese of Speyer ‚Äì an incident celebrated by Sigebert in verse. The subsequent history of the relics is not clear. According to Umberto Benigni, Stephen II (768) sent the relics of St. Lucy to Constantinople for safety against the Saracen incursions. On their capture of Constantinople in 1204, the French found some relics attributed to Saint Lucy in the city, and Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice, secured them for the monastery of St. George at Venice. In 1513 the Venetians presented to Louis XII of France the saint's head, which he deposited in the cathedral church of Bourges. Another account, however, states that the head was brought to Bourges from Rome, where it had been transferred during the time when the relics rested in Corfinium. The remainder of the relics remain in Venice: they were transferred to the church of San Geremia when the church of Santa Lucia was demolished in 1861 to make way for the new railway terminus. A century later, on 7 November 1981, thieves stole all her bones, except her head. Police recovered them five weeks later, on her feast day. Other parts of the corpse have found their way to Rome, Naples, Verona, Lisbon, Milan, as well as Germany, France and Sweden. Patronage Lucy's Latin name Lucia shares a root (luc-) with the Latin word for light, lux. A number of traditions incorporate symbolic meaning of St. Lucy as the bearer of light in the darkness of winter, her feast day being 13 December. Because some versions of her story relate that her eyes were removed, either by herself or by her persecutors, she is the patron saint of the blind. She is also the patron saint of authors, cutlers, glaziers, laborers, martyrs, peasants, saddlers, salesmen, stained glass workers, and of Perugia, Italy. She is invoked against hemorraghes, dysentery, diseases of the eye, and throat infections. St. Lucy is the patroness of Syracuse in Sicily, Italy. At the Piazza Duomo in Syracuse, the church of Santa Lucia alla Badia houses the painting \\"Burial of St. Lucy (Caravaggio)\\". She is also the patron saint of the coastal town of Ol√≥n, Ecuador, which celebrates with a week-long festival culminating on the feast day 13 December. The Caribbean island of Saint Lucia, one of the Windward Islands in the Lesser Antilles, is named after her. Iconography Saint Lucy, by Francesco del Cossa (c. 1430 ‚Äì c. 1477) The emblem of eyes on a cup or plate apparently reflects popular devotion to her as protector of sight, because of her name, Lucia (from the Latin word \\"lux\\" which means \\"light\\").Paul, Tessa. The Illustrated World Encyclopedia of Saints.Butler, Alban. Lives of the Saints In paintings St. Lucy is frequently shown holding her eyes on a golden plate. Lucy was represented in Gothic art holding a dish with two eyes on it. She also holds the palm branch, symbol of martyrdom and victory over evil. Other symbolic images include a lamp, dagger, or two oxen. In literature =Dante= Lucia appears in Dante's Inferno Canto II as the messenger sent to Beatrice from \\"The blessed Dame\\" (the Virgin Mary), to rouse Beatrice to send Virgil to Dante's aid. Henry Fanshawe Tozer identifies Lucia as representing \\"illuminative grace\\". According to Robert Pogue Harrison and Rachel Jacoff, Lucia's appearance in this intermediary role is to reinforce the scene in which Virgil tries to fortify Dante's courage to begin the journey through the inferno. In the Purgatorio IX:52‚Äì63, Lucy carries the sleeping Dante to the entrance to purgatory. Then in Paradiso XXXII Dante places her opposite Adam within the Mystic Rose in Canto XXXII of the Paradiso. Lucy may also be seen as a figure of Illuminating Grace or Mercy or even Justice.See David H. Higgins' commentary in Dante, The Divine Comedy, trans. C.H. Sisson. NY: Oxford University Press, 1993. . P. 506. =Donne= Her feast day was commonly described as the shortest day of the year, as it is in John Donne's poem, \\"A Nocturnal upon St. Lucie's Day, being the shortest day\\" (1627). The poem begins with: \\"'Tis the year's midnight, and it is the day's\\".Pinsky, Robert. \\"Struggling Against the Dark\\", Slate, 11 December 2012 Lucia is also the protagonist of a Swedish novel: \\"Ett ljus i m√∂rkret\\" (\\"A light in the darkness\\") by Agneta Sj√∂din. Popular celebration Saint Lucia procession in Sweden. Popular devotional image. Lucy's feast is on 13 December, in Advent. Her feast once coincided with the Winter Solstice, the shortest day of the year, before calendar reforms, so her feast day has become a festival of light. This is particularly seen in Scandinavian countries, with their long dark winters. There, a young girl dressed in a white dress and a red sash (as the symbol of martyrdom) carries palms and wears a crown or wreath of candles on her head. In Denmark, Norway and Sweden, girls dressed as Lucy carry rolls and cookies in procession as songs are sung. It is said that to vividly celebrate St. Lucy's Day will help one live the long winter days with enough light.Swedish Lucia For Dummies. Swedish Institute, 2012. A special devotion to St. Lucy is practiced in the Italian regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige, in the North of the country, and Sicily and Calabria, in the South, as well as in the Croatian coastal region of Dalmatia. The feast is a Catholic-celebrated holiday with roots that can be traced to Sicily. On the 13th of every December it is celebrated with large traditional feasts of home-made pasta and various other Italian dishes, with a special dessert of wheat in hot chocolate milk. The large grains of soft wheat are representative of her eyes and are a treat only to be indulged in once a year. In the north of Italy Saint Lucy brings gift to kids between 12 and 13 December. Traditionally a bouquet of hay is put outside of the house for Lucy's Donkey and food in the house for Lucy to refresh them after the long night bringing gifts to every kid. In small towns, a parade with Saint Lucy is held the evening of the 12th when she goes through the main streets of the town munching sweets and candy from her cart, always together with her donkey. A Hungarian custom is to plant wheat in a small pot on St. Lucy's feast. By Christmas green sprouts appear, signs of life coming from death. The wheat is then carried to the manger scene as the symbol of Christ in the Eucharist. In the Philippines, villagers from Barangay Sta. Lucia in Magarao, Camarines Sur, hold a novena to St. Lucy nine days before her feast. A procession of the saint's image is held every morning at the poblacion or village centre during the nine days leading up to St. Lucy's Day, attracting devotees from other parts of the Bicol Region. Hymns to the saint, known as the Gozos, as well as the Spanish version of the Ave Maria are chanted during the dawn procession, which is followed by a Mass. The feast day is also commemorated in Barangay Sucad inApalit Apalit Pampanga after the traditional nine-day novena, where a whole day celebration is observed through Eucharistic Masses, festivals and the procession of the religious sculpture of Sta. Lucia in the evening before the evening Mass.

Rather than let them feel discouraged, the Buddha taught the Sravaka and Pratyekabuddha paths for rest and recuperation. After finding rest in states of meditative absorption, they are encouraged and awakened by the Buddha's body, speech, and mind to reach final Nirvana. Inspired by the Buddha, they then cultivate Bodhicitta and practice the Bodhisattva path.Khenpo Konchog Gyaltsen Rinpoche, \\"Jewel Ornament of Liberation.\\" 1998, pp. 51-53 In the JƒÅtakas Pratyekabuddhas (e.g. Darƒ´mukha J.378, Sonaka J.529) appear as teachers of Buddhist doctrine in pre-Buddhist times in several of the Jataka tales.

Upscale restaurants are not expected to offer it, but street vendors and smaller restaurants will make their first daily sales of it before they run out. Cojinova itself (considered a medium quality fish) is caught for its fish meal, not for its roe, which is considered a chance product. Sea urchin roe is considered a delicacy and it is used (at customer request) to add strength to ceviche. United States Photograph of men harvesting and fertilizing salmon eggs from a female at a hatchery in Alaska by John Nathan Cobb (early 20th century) In the United States, several kinds of roe are produced: salmon from the Pacific coast, shad and herring species such as the American shad and alewife, mullet, paddlefish, American bowfin, and some species of sturgeon. Shad, pike, and other roe sometimes are pan-fried with bacon. Spot prawn roe (hard to find) is also a delicacy from the North Pacific. Flounder roe, pan-fried and served with grits is popular on the Southeastern coast. =Asia= Bangladesh  Hilsha fish curry is a popular dish in the cuisine of Bangladesh Roe from the ilish fish is considered a delicacy in Bangladesh. The roe is usually deep-fried, although other preparations such as mashed roe where the roe crushed along with oil, onion and pepper, or curry of roe can also be found. China In many regions in China, crab and urchin roes are eaten as a delicacy. Crab roe are often used as topping in dishes such as \\"crab roe tofu\\" (ËüπÁ≤âË±ÜËÖê). Nanxiang Steamed Bun Restaurant serves \\"crab roe xiaolongbao\\" as their special. Shrimp roes are also eaten in certain places, especially around the downstream of Yangtze River, such as Wuhu, as toppings for noodle soup. India and Pakistan Fried roe dish with vegetables Among the tribal populace of eastern India, roe that has been deeply roasted over an open fire is a delicacy. In this region, the roe of rohu is also considered a delicacy and is eaten fried or as a stuffing within a fried pointed gourd to make potoler dolma. All along the Konkan coast and Northern Kerala, the roe of sardines, black mackerel and several other fish is considered a delicacy. The roe can be eaten fried (after being coated with red chilli paste) and also as a thick curry (gashi). In Goa, roe is first steamed or poached, then coated with salt and chilli powder and then shallow fried or roasted on a tawa (flat pan). In the state of Kerala, roe is deep fried in coconut oil, and is considered a delicacy. A common method of quick preparation is to wrap the roe in wet banana leaves and cook it over charcoal embers. In Odisha and West Bengal, roe of several fresh-water fish, including hilsa, are eaten, the roe being cooked separately or along with the fish, the latter method being preferred for all but large fishes. Roe, either light or deep-fried are also eaten as snacks or appetizers before a major meal. All along the Indus River and Specially South Pakistan Sindh, the roe of Palla, Palla and several other fish is considered a delicacy. The roe can be eaten fried (after being coated with red chilli paste) and also as a thick curry (Salan/Curry). coated with salt and chilli powder and then shallow fried or roasted on a tawa (flat pan). Iran In the Caspian provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran, several types of roe are used. Called ashpal or ashbal, roe is consumed grilled, cured, salted, or mixed with other ingredients. If salted or cured, it is consumed as a condiment. If used fresh, it is usually grilled, steamed, or mixed with eggs and fried to form a custard-like dish called \\"Ashpal Kuku\\". Besides the much sought-after caviar, roe from kutum (also known as Caspian white fish or Rutilus frisii kutum), Caspian roach (called \\"kuli\\" in Gileki), bream (called \\"kulmeh\\" in Gileki), and Caspian salmon are highly prized. Roe from carp is less common and barbel roe is also occasionally used. Israel Several sections of the Israeli cuisine include roe. In Modern Hebrew, roe is commonly referred to by its Russian name \\"ikra\\" (◊ê◊ô◊ß◊®◊î). When necessary, the color is also mentioned: white or pink, as appropriate. Israeli \\"white ikra\\" is commonly made of carp or herring eggs, while \\"red ikra\\" is made of flathead mullet eggs or, in rarer cases, salmon eggs. The term \\"caviar\\" is separate, and denotes only sturgeon eggs. Ikra is served as a starter dish, to be eaten with pita or similar breads, particularly in Arab restaurants. It can also be purchased in stores, in standard-sized plastic packages. In home cooking it is similarly served as a starter dish. In Judaism, roe from kosher fish‚Äîfish with fins and scales‚Äîis considered kosher. Like fish in general, it is considered pareve. Roe is considered kosher only if the fish from which it's harvested is kosher as well. This means that sturgeon roe is not considered kosher from an Orthodox Jewish perspective. For most Orthodox Jewish consumers who keep kosher, roe or caviar must be processed under kosher supervision as well. The only exception to this rule is red roe, thanks to a widely accepted responsa by the Bais Yosef. Japan Salmon roe at the Shiogama seafood market in Japan Ikuradon, a bowl of rice topped with salmon roe Uncooked noodle made from shrimp roe A variety of roe types are used in Japanese cuisine, including the following which are used raw in sushi: * Ikura () - Salmon roe. Large reddish- orange individual spheres. It is a loan word from the Russian, \\"–∏–∫—Ä–∞\\" (soft- shelled eggs, in this context caviar) * Sujiko () - Also salmon roe. The difference is that sujiko is still inside its sac when it is prepared. It also has a different color; sujiko is red to dark-red while ikura is lighter in color, sometimes almost orange. Sujiko is also sweeter in taste. * Masago ()- Capelin roe, similar to Tobiko, but smaller. * Kazunoko () - Herring roe, yellow or pinkish, having a firm, rubbery texture and appearance, usually pickled. The roe is in a single cohesive mass and so looks like a piece of fish. * Mentaiko () - Alaska pollock roe, spiced with powdered red pepper and surrounded by a thin, elastic membrane. Mentaiko is usually pink to dark red. * Tarako () - Salted Alaska pollock roe, sometimes grilled. * Tobiko () - Flying fish roe, very crunchy, reddish orange in color. Sea urchin roe * Uni () - Sea urchin roe, soft and melting. Color ranges from orange to pale yellow. Humans consume the reproductive organs (\\"roe\\") either raw or briefly cooked. Sea urchin roe is a popular food in Japan, and it is called \\"uni\\" in Japanese sushi cuisine. Apart from domestic consumption, a number of other countries export the sea urchin to Japan in order to meet its demand throughout the country. Traditionally considered an aphrodisiac, sea urchin roe has been found to contain the cannabinoid anandamide. *Karasumi () - is a specialty of Nagasaki and along with salt-pickled sea urchin roe and Konowata one of the three chinmi of Japan. It is made by desalinating salt pickled mullet roe and sun drying it. * Ebiko - Shrimp roe, sometimes translated as \\"Shrimp Flakes\\"; the eggs are smaller and generally a darker orange than Tobiko. There is a variant of Ebiko made from Capelin roe.‚ÄúTobiko‚Äù & ‚ÄúEbiko‚Äù Korea All kinds of fish roe are widely eaten in Korean cuisine, including the popular sea urchin, salmon, herring, flying fish, cod, among others. Myeongran jeot (Î™ÖÎûÄÏ†ì) refers to the jeotgal (salted fermented seafood) made with pollock roe seasoned with chili pepper powders. It is commonly consumed as banchan, small dish accompanied with cooked rice or ingredient for altang (ÏïåÌÉï), a kind of jjigae (Korean stew). Albap is a bibimbap made with roe. Lebanon Sea urchin roe, or toutia ÿ™Ÿàÿ™Ÿäÿ© as it is known locally, is eaten directly from the sea urchin shell fresh using a small spoon. Some people add a twist of lemon juice to the roe and eat it in Lebanese flat bread. Malaysia Particularly in Sarawak, Malaysia, Toli Shad fish roe is a popular delicacy among locals and tourists. The roe is usually found in the street market in Sarawak's capital city of Kuching. The roe can be sold for up to US$19 per 100 grams and is considered expensive among locals, but the price can reach up to US$30 in other states of Malaysia. The roe is usually salted before sale but fresh roe is also available. The salted roe is usually pan fried or steamed and eaten with steamed rice. The fish itself is also usually salted and served along with the roe. =New Zealand= The Maori people and other New Zealanders eat sea urchin roe, called \\"kina\\".2\\\\. Sea urchins - Starfish, sea urchins and other echinoderms - Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand Kina is sold in fish shops, supermarkets, and alongside the road. Most commercial kina is imported from the Chatham Islands. =Europe= All around the Mediterranean, botargo is an esteemed specialty made of the cured roe pouch of flathead mullet, tuna, or swordfish; it is called bottarga (Italian), poutargue or boutargue (French), botarga (Spanish), batarekh (Arabic) or avgotaraho (Greek Œ±œÖŒ≥ŒøœÑŒ¨œÅŒ±œáŒø). Denmark The most commonly eaten roe in Denmark is cod roe, usually sold canned with added water, starch, oil, salt, and tomato puree and then boiled and preserved. It is served sliced, either as is or slightly roasted in a pan, on top of rye bread, sometimes topped with remoulade and/or lemon. An everyday food item on many Danish lunch tables. Lumpfish (stenbider) roe is another roe used in Danish cuisine. It is considered somewhat of a luxury item and is primarily used as a condiment on top of halved or sliced hard-boiled eggs, on top of mounds of shrimp, or in combination with other fish or seafood. France Sea urchin roe (oursin in French) is eaten directly from the sea and in restaurants, where it is served both by itself and in seafood platters, usually spooned from the shell of the animal. Crab, shrimp and prawn roe still attached to those animals is also considered a delicacy. Finland Common whitefish and especially vendace from the fresh water lakes in Finland are renowned for the excellent delicate taste of the roe. Roe is served as topping of toast or on blini with onion and smetana. Greece Taramasalata, salad made with taram√° Taram√° is salted and cured carp or cod roe used to make taramosal√°ta, a Greek meze consisting of taram√° mixed with lemon juice, bread crumbs, onions, and olive oil; it is eaten as a dip. Avgotaraho (Œ±œÖŒ≥ŒøœÑŒ¨œÅŒ±œáŒø) or botargo is the prepared roe of the flathead mullet. Italy Bottarga is primarily the salted and dried roe pouch of the Atlantic bluefin tuna; it can also be prepared with the dried roe pouch of the flathead mullet, even if it is considered of low quality and less tasty. It is used minced for dressing pasta or sliced with olive oil and lemon (Fishermen style). The coastal town of Alghero, Sardinia, is also known for its \\"bogamar√¨\\" specialty (fresh sea urchin roe). Netherlands In the Netherlands fried roe of herring is eaten. Norway Norwegian caviar is most commonly made from cod, but caviar made from lumpsucker or capelin roe is also available. During winter season, when skrei, winter cod is available, roe is cooked in its sack and served with cod liver and poached cod. This traditional dish is particularly popular in coastal Norway and is called m√∏lje. In some areas it is also common to fry the roe from freshly caught fish, to be eaten on bread or with potatoes and flatbread. Portugal Codfish roe and sardine roe are sold in olive oil. The fresh roe of hake (pescada) is also consumed (a popular way of eating it is boiled with vegetables, and simply seasoned with olive oil and a dash of vinegar). In the South of Portugal, the \\"ouri√ßo do mar\\" (sea urchin) is highly appreciated. In the Sines area (Alentejo), a layer of dried pine needles is placed on the ground and, on top of it, a layer of sea urchins. This layer is topped with a second layer of dried pine needles. The pile is set on fire. The roe is removed from the cooked sea urchins and eaten. Sea urchin is not consumed in May, June, July, and August. Romania Romanian roe salad decorated with black olives Fish roe is very popular in Romania as a starter (like salatƒÉ de icre) or sometimes served for breakfast on toasted bread. The most common roe is that of the European carp; pike, herring, cod are also popular. Fried soft roe is also a popular dish. Sturgeon roe is a delicacy normally served at functions.  Russia and ex-USSR countries  Open sandwich (butterbrot) with pollock roe In Russian, all types of fish roe are called ikra (–∏–∫—Ä–∞), and there is no linguistic distinction between the English words \\"roe\\" and \\"caviar.\\" Sturgeon roe, called chyornaya ikra (—á—ë—Ä–Ω–∞—è –∏–∫—Ä–∞, \\"black caviar\\") is most prized. It is followed in prestige by salmon roe called krasnaya ikra (–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–∞—è –∏–∫—Ä–∞, \\"red caviar\\"), which is less expensive, but still considered a delicacy. Both types of roe are usually served lightly salted on buttered wheat bread, or as an accompaniment for blini, or used as an ingredient in various haute cuisine and festive dishes. More common roes, such as cod, Alaska pollock, and herring are everyday dishes. Salted cod or pollock roe on buttered bread is common breakfast fare and herring roe is often eaten smoked or fried. The roe of freshwater fish is also popular but the commercial availability is lower. Soft roe of various fishes is also widely consumed, mostly fried, and is a popular cantina-style dish. Roe found in dried vobla fish is considered delicious by some; though dried vobla roe is not produced separately as a stand-alone dish, roe-carrying vobla is prized. Spain Cod and hake roe is commonly consumed throughout Spain in many different forms: saut√©ed, grilled, fried, marinated, pickled, boiled, with mayonnaise, or in salad. Tuna and ling dry brined roe is traditional in Andalusia and the Mediterranean coasts since antiquity. In all of the Spanish coastal regions, sea urchin roe is considered a delicacy and consumed raw. Roe from the Mediterranean grey mullet, Mugil cephalus, is a sustainable roe resembling sturgeon roe that is marketed from Spain to countries around the world.Mujjo‚Äôl Caviar, mujjolcaviar.com, about-us, accessed January 1, 2020 Sweden Sm√∂rg√•skaviar as a condiment on a cottage cheese sandwich Smoked and salted cod roe paste known as sm√∂rg√•skaviar is commonly served as sandwich topping in Sweden. Lightly salted roe of the vendace is called L√∂jrom in Swedish. It is naturally orange in colour. The most sought after type is Kalix L√∂jrom from Kalix in the northern Baltic sea. Most L√∂jrom consumed in Sweden is however imported frozen from North America. Stenbitsrom, the roe of lumpfish is naturally a bleak unappetizing gray, but is coloured black (to emulate black caviar) or orange (to emulate L√∂jrom). Stenbitsrom sells in much larger volume than L√∂jrom, but it has two drawbacks: it tastes of little more than its salt and artificial additives, and the colour additives tend to bleed into other parts of the food served with it (such as a boiled egg), or to discolour porcelain dishes. There is also a trend to use more Laxrom (salmon roe), which is a natural orange colour, with a large diameter. United Kingdom Though not popular, herring roe is sold within many British supermarkets. Battered cod roe can also be bought from many fish and chip shops. Various tinned roes are on sale in supermarkets e.g. soft cod roes, pressed cod roes and herring roes.

Madeo, Kenneth E. Anderson, Betty R. Jackson (1992), Concepts of Taxation, Dryden Press: Fort Worth, TX \\"Regressive\\" describes a distribution effect on income or expenditure, referring to the way the rate progresses from high to low, so that the average tax rate exceeds the marginal tax rate.Hyman, David M. (1990) Public Finance: A Contemporary Application of Theory to Policy, 3rd, Dryden Press: Chicago, ILJames, Simon (1998) A Dictionary of Taxation, Edgar Elgar Publishing Limited: Northampton, MA In terms of individual income and wealth, a regressive tax imposes a greater burden (relative to resources) on the poor than on the rich: there is an inverse relationship between the tax rate and the taxpayer's ability to pay, as measured by assets, consumption, or income. These taxes tend to reduce the tax burden of the people with a higher ability to pay, as they shift the relative burden increasingly to those with a lower ability to pay. The regressivity of a particular tax can also factor the propensity of the taxpayers to engage in the taxed activity relative to their resources (the demographics of the tax base). In other words, if the activity being taxed is more likely to be carried out by the poor and less likely to be carried out by the rich, the tax may be considered regressive. To measure the effect, the income elasticity of the good being taxed as well as the income effect on consumption must be considered. The measure can be applied to individual taxes or to a tax system as a whole; a year, multi-year, or lifetime. The opposite of a regressive tax is a progressive tax, in which the average tax rate increases as the amount subject to taxation risesWebster (4b): increasing in rate as the base increases (a progressive tax)American Heritage (6). Increasing in rate as the taxable amount increases.Britannica Concise Encyclopedia: Tax levied at a rate that increases as the quantity subject to taxation increases.Princeton University WordNet: (n) progressive tax (any tax with a rate that increases as the amount subject to taxation increases) In between is a flat or proportional tax, where the tax rate is fixed as the amount subject to taxation increases. Examples * Poll taxes * Lump-sum tax * A tax with a cap, above which no taxes are paid. * So-called \\"sin taxes\\" (pigovian taxes) have also been criticized for being regressive, as they are often consumed more (or at least at a greater proportion) by the lower classes. Such taxes are often imposed at a flat rate so they will make up a greater proportion of the final price of cheaper brands, compared to the higher-quality products generally consumed by the wealthy. For example, \\"people in the bottom income quintile spend a 78% larger share of their income on alcohol taxes than people in the top quintile.\\" Tobacco in particular is highly regressive, with the bottom quintile of income paying an effective rate 583% higher than that of the top quintile. * An allowance reduction in an income tax system allows for an individual's personal allowance to be withdrawn, making a higher marginal tax for a limited band before returning to the underlying rate. In the UK, there is an effective 60% band at ¬£100,000, which returns to 40% at ¬£120,000. * Non-uniform excise taxation based on everyday essentials like food (fat tax, salt tax), transport (fuel tax, fare hikes for public transport), energy (carbon tax) and housing (council tax, window tax) is frequently regressive on income. The income elasticity of demand of food, for example, is usually less than 1 (inelastic) (see Engel's law) and therefore as a household's income rises, the tax collected on the food remains almost the same. Therefore, as a proportion of available expenditure, the relative tax burden falls more heavily on households with lower incomes. Some governments offer rebates to households with lower incomes, ostensibly in an effort to mitigate the regressive nature of these taxes. ** A related concept exists where production and importation of essential goods are strictly controlled, such as milk, eggs, cheese and poultry under Canada's supply management system, the result being that the products will sell for a higher price than they would under a free market system. The difference in price is often criticized for being a \\"regressive tax\\" even though such products are generally not taxed directly. * Payroll taxes, such as FICA and Unemployment Insurance in the United States, and consumption taxes such as Value Added Tax and sales taxes are regressive in that they both raise prices of purchased goods. Lower-income earners save and invest less money, so pay a larger proportion of their income toward these taxes, directly for sales tax and as the price increase required to make revenue covering payrolls for payroll taxes.

It originated from the merger of two workers' rights organizations, the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) led by organizer Larry Itliong, and the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) led by C√©sar Ch√°vez and Dolores Huerta. They became allied and transformed from workers' rights organizations into a union as a result of a series of strikes in 1965, when the mostly Filipino farmworkers of the AWOC in Delano, California initiated a grape strike, and the NFWA went on strike in support. As a result of the commonality in goals and methods, the NFWA and the AWOC formed the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee on August 22, 1966. This organization was accepted into the AFL-CIO in 1972 and changed its name to the United Farm Workers Union. History = Founding of the UFW = Dolores Huerta grew up in Stockton, California, in the San Joaquin Valley, an area filled with farms. In the early 1950s, she completed a degree at Delta Community College, part of the University of the Pacific. She briefly worked as an elementary school teacher. Huerta saw that her students, many of them children of farm workers, were living in poverty without enough food to eat or other basic necessities. To help, she became one of the founders of the Stockton chapter of the Community Service Organization (CSO). The CSO worked to improve social and economic conditions for farm workers and to fight discrimination. By 1959, C√©sar Ch√°vez had already established professional relationships with local community organizations that aimed to empower the working class population by encouraging them to become more politically active. In 1952, Ch√°vez met Fred Ross, who was a community organizer working on behalf of the Community Service Organization. This group was affiliated with the Industrial Areas Foundation, headed by Saul Alinsky. To further her cause, Huerta created the Agricultural Workers Association (AWA) in 1960. Through the AWA, she lobbied politicians on many issues, including allowing migrant workers without U.S. citizenship to receive public assistance and pensions and creating Spanish-language voting ballots and driver's tests. In 1962, she co-founded a workers' union alongside community activists such as Larry Itliong and C√©sar Ch√°vez, which was later known as the United Farm Workers (UFW). The UFW was created through the emergence of the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) which was mainly composed of Filipino migrant workers and the National Farm Workers Association (NFWA) which was mainly composed of Mexican migrant workers. Larry Itliong was a Filipino American labor organizer who fore-fronted the grape strike in Coachella Valley that spearheaded the Delano Grape Strike of 1965. He became assistant director of the UFW. Ch√°vez was the dynamic leader and speaker and Huerta was a skilled organizer and tough negotiator. Huerta was instrumental in the union's many successes, including the strikes against California grape growers in the 1960s and 1970s. During Ch√°vez's participation in the Community Service Organization, Fred Ross trained C√©sar Ch√°vez in the grassroots, door- to-door, house meeting tactic of organization, a tactic crucial to the UFW's recruiting methods. The house meeting tactic successfully established a broad base of local Community Service Organization chapters during Ross's era, and Ch√°vez used this technique to extend the UFW's reach as well as to find up and coming organizers. During the 1950s, C√©sar Ch√°vez and Fred Ross developed twenty-two new Community Service Organization chapters in the Mexican American neighborhoods of San Jose. In 1959, Ch√°vez claimed the rank of executive director in the Community Service Organization. During this time, Ch√°vez observed and adopted the notion of having the community become more politically involved to bring about social changes that the community sought. This was a vital tactic in Ch√°vez's future struggles in fighting for immigrant rights.Levy, Jacques E. Cesar Chavez: Autobiography of La Causa. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1975. Print. C√©sar Ch√°vez's ultimate goal in his participation with the Community Service Organization and the Industrial Areas Foundation was to eventually organize a union for the farm workers. Saul Alinsky did not share Ch√°vez's sympathy for the farm workers struggle, claiming that organizing farm workers, \\"was like fighting on a constantly disintegrating bed of sand.\\" (Alinsky, 1967) In March 1962, at the Community Service Organization convention, Ch√°vez proposed a pilot project for organizing farm workers, which the organization's members rejected. Ch√°vez responded by resigning from the organization to create the farm workers union that later became known as the National Farm Workers Association. UFW Flag By 1965, the National Farm Workers Association had acquired twelve hundred members through Ch√°vez's person-to-person recruitment efforts, which he had learned from Fred Ross just a decade earlier. Out of those twelve hundred, only about two hundred paid dues. Also in 1962, Richard Chavez, the brother of C√©sar Ch√°vez, designed the black Aztec eagle insignia that became the symbol of the NFW and the UFW. C√©sar Ch√°vez chose the red and black colors used by the organization. Although still in its infant stages, the organization lent its support to a strike by workers in the rose industry in 1965. This initial protest by the young organization resulted in a failed attempt to strike against the rose industry. That same year the farm workers who worked in the Delano fields of California wanted to strike against the growers in response to the grower's refusal to raise wages from $1.20 to $1.40 an hour, and they sought out Ch√°vez and the National Farm Workers Association for support. The Delano agricultural workers were mostly Filipino workers affiliated with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, a charter of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. The unification of these two organizations, in an attempt to boycott table grapes grown in the Delano fields, resulted in the creation of the United Farm Workers of America. The AFL-CIO chartered the United Farm Workers, officially combining the AWOC and the NFWA, in August 1966. = Historic complications in organizing farm workers prior to UFW formation = In the early history of American agriculture, farm workers experienced many failed attempts to organize agricultural laborers. In 1903, Japanese and Mexican farm workers attempted to come together to fight for better wages and better working conditions. This attempt to organize agricultural laborers was ignored and disbanded when organizations, such as the American Federation of Labor, neglected to support their efforts, often withholding assistance on the basis of race.Shaw, Randy. Beyond the Fields: Cesar Chavez, the UFW, and the Struggle for Justice in the 21st Century. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008. Print. In 1913, the Industrial Workers of the World organized a rally of two thousand farm workers at a large ranch in a rural area of Northern California. This resulted in an attack by National Guardsmen against participants. As a result of the violence, the two lead organizers for the Industrial Workers of the World were arrested, convicted of murder, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Some believe the two people arrested were wrongly convicted. In the later 1910s and the 1920s in the United States, further attempts to organize farm laborers were undertaken by spontaneous local efforts, and some by communist unions. These attempts also failed because, at that time, the law did not require employers to negotiate with workers. Employers at the time could legally fire employees for union activity. In 1936, the National Labor Relations Act took effect. This legislation provided most American workers the right to join unions and bargain collectively. Agricultural workers were exempt from the protection of this law. Some believe that this labor category was excluded as a result of a political tactic to gain the support of Southern politicians in the passing of this law. In 1941, the United States Government and the Mexican Government enacted the Bracero Program. Initially, the two governments established this joint project to address Second World War labor shortages by allowing \\"guest workers\\" from Mexico to work in the American agricultural industry until the end of the crop harvest. Thousands of Mexican Nationals came north to work in American fields, and growers used the opportunity to undercut domestic wages. They also used the Braceros to break strikes by resident farm workers. This government extended the program until 1964. =Community organizing and divisions of labor in the UFW= Many Mexican women in California who joined the UFW in the 1960s had been previously involved in community-based activism in the 1950s through the Community Service Organization for Latino civil rights. The racial discrimination and economic disadvantages they faced from a young age made it necessary to form networks of support like the CSO to empower Latinos in America with voter registration drives, citizenship classes, lawsuits and legislative campaigns, and political protests against police brutality and immigration policies. While male activists held leadership roles and more authority, the women activists participated in volunteering and teaching valuable skills to individuals of the Latino community. By the 1960s, Huerta and others began to shift their attention to the labor exploitation of Latino farm workers in California and began to strike, demonstrate, and organize to fight for a myriad of issues that Mexican laborers faced. While many of the male leaders of the movement had the role of being dynamic, powerful speakers that inspired others to join the movement, the women devoted their efforts to negotiating better working contracts with companies, organizing boycotts, rallying for changes in immigration policies, registering Latinos to vote with Spanish language ballots, and increasing pressure on legislation to improve labor relations. Among the women who engaged in activism for labor rights, traditional and non traditional patterns of activism existed. Mexican-American women like Dolores Huerta used their education and resources arrange programs at the grassroots level, sustaining and leading members it into the labor movement. As the sister-in-law of C√©sar Ch√°vez, Huerta co-founded the National Farmworkers Association, which became the United Farm Workers. She had great influence over the direction that it took, breaking stereotypes of the Mexican woman in the 1960s. However, it was most common for Chicana activists and female labor union members to be involved in administrative tasks for the early stages of UFW. Women like Helen Ch√°vez were important in responsibilities such as credit union bookkeeping and behind the scenes advising. Still, both women along with other Chicana activists participated in picketing with their families in the face of police intimidation and racial abuse. Keeping track of union services and membership were traditionally responsibilities given to female organizers and it was integral to the institutional survival of the UFW, but it has gone much less recognized throughout history due to the male led strikes receiving majority public attention. = Texas strike = In May 1966, California farm worker activist, Eugene Nelson, traveled to Texas to rally support for the Schenley Farms boycott. While in Houston, AFL-CIO state representatives suggested that he visit Rio Grande City on the Texas-Mexico border in the lower Rio Grande Valley. Seeing the possibilities for organizing workers in the impoverished region, he quickly set about recruiting volunteers for the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee (UFWOC) as both strikers and assistants. Other UFWOC activists joined Nelson in Rio Grande City, including Gilbert Padilla, Antonio Orendain, and Bill Chandler. At the time, some melon workers lacked access to fresh water while working in the fields, some lacked sanitary facilities for human waste, and some were present in the fields as crop dusters dropped pesticides on the crops. On June 1, Nelson led workers to strike demanding $1.25 as a minimum hourly wage, protesting La Casita Farms and others packing sheds. The activists also protested the hiring of \\"scab\\" labor, mostly those with green card visas from Mexico, who were allowed to cross the border as day workers. In the dispute, reports and allegations of vandalism to equipment, produce, and public property caused Starr County officials, along with the support of the growers, to call for additional law enforcement, which arrived in the form of the Texas Rangers. Both county officials and rangers arrested protestors for secondary picketing, standing within 50 feet of one another, a practice illegal at the time. Allegations of brutality and questions of jurisdictional limits created national headlines in what came to be known as La Huelga. On July 4, members of UFWOC, strikers, and members of the clergy set out on a march to Austin to demand the $1.25 minimum wage and other improvements for farm workers. Press coverage intensified as the marchers made their way north in the summer heat. Politicians, members of the AFL-CIO, and the Texas Council of Churches accompanied the protestors. Gov. John Connally, who had refused to meet them in Austin, traveled to New Braunfels with then House Speaker Ben Barnes and Attorney General Waggoner Carr to intercept the march and inform strikers that their efforts would have no effect. Protestors arrived in Austin in time for a Labor Day rally, but no changes in law resulted. Strikes and arrests continued in Rio Grande City through 1966 into 1967. Violence increased as the spring melon crop ripened and time neared for the May harvest. In June, when beatings of two UFWOC supporters by Texas rangers surfaced, tempers flared. At the end of June as the harvest was ending, members of the Senate Subcommittee on Migratory Labor, including Senators Harrison Williams and Edward Kennedy, arrived in the lower Rio Grande Valley to hold hearings in Rio Grande City and Edinburg, Texas. The senators took their findings back to Washington as a report on pending legislation. Subsequently, the rangers left the area and the picketing ended. On September 20, Hurricane Beulah's devastations ruined the farming industry in the Valley for the following year. One major outcome of the strikes came in the form of a 1974 Supreme Court victory in Medrano v. Allee, limiting jurisdiction of Texas Rangers in labor disputes. Farm workers continued to organize through the 1970s on a smaller scale, under new leadership in San Juan, Texas, independent of C√©sar Ch√°vez. = Texas campaign = By mid-1971 the Texas campaign was well underway. In Sept. 1971, Thomas John Wakely, recent discharge from the United States Air Force joined the San Antonio office of the Texas campaign. His pay was room and board, $5.00 a week plus all of the menudo he could eat. The menudo was provided to the UFOC staff by the families of migrant workers working the Texas fields. TJ worked for UFOC for about 2 years and his responsibilities included organizing the Grape Boycott in San Antonio. His primary target was the H-E-B grocery store chain. In addition, he attempted to organize Hispanic farm workers working the farmers market in San Antonio ‚Äî an institution at that time controlled by the corporate farms. Among his many organizing activities included an early 1972 episode where he and several other UFOC staff members who were attempting to organize warehouse workers in San Antonio were fired upon by security agents of the corporate farm owners. In mid-1973 the San Antonio office of the UFOC was taken over by the Brown Berets. This radicalization of the San Antonio UFOC office led to the eventual collapse of the San Antonio UFOC organizing campaign. = 1970s = In 1970, Chavez decided to move the union's headquarters from Delano to La Paz, California into a former sanatorium in the Tehachapi Mountains. Whereas Chavez thought this change would help create \\"a national union of the poor ... serving the needs of all who suffer,\\" other union members objected to this distancing of the leadership away from the farmworkers. The union was poised to launch its next major campaign in the lettuce fields in 1970 when a deal between the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the growers nearly destroyed it. Initially the Teamsters signed contracts with lettuce growers in the Salinas Valley, who wanted to avoid recognizing the UFW. Then in 1973, when the three-year UFW grape contracts expired, the grape growers signed contracts giving the Teamsters the right to represent the workers who had been members of the UFW. The UFW responded with strikes, lawsuits and boycotts, including secondary boycotts in the retail grocery industry. The union struggled to regain the members it had lost in the lettuce fields; it never fully recovered its strength in grapes, due in some part to incompetent management of the hiring halls it had established that seemed to favor some workers over others. The battles in the fields became violent, with a number of UFW members killed on the picket line. The violence led the state in 1975 to enact the California Agricultural Labor Relations Act, creating an administrative agency, the ALRB, that oversaw secret ballot elections and resolved charges of unfair labor practices, like failing to bargain in good faith, or discrimination against activists. The UFW won the majority of secret ballot elections in which it participated. In the late 1970s, the leadership of the UFW was wracked by a series of conflicts, as differences emerged between Chavez and some of his former colleagues. In 1977, the Teamsters signed an agreement with the UFW promising to end their efforts to represent farm workers. = 1980s = In the 1980s, the membership of the UFW shrank, as did its national prominence. After taking office in the 1980s, California Governor George Deukmejian stopped enforcement of the state's farm labor laws, resulting in farm workers losing their UFW contracts, being fired, and blacklisted. Due to internal squabbles, most of the union's original leadership left or were forced out, except for Chavez and Huerta. By 1986, the union had been reduced to 75 contracts and had stopped organizing. In the 1980s, the UFW joined with the AFL-CIO and other organizations for the national Wrath of Grapes campaign, re-instituting the grape boycott. In the early 1980s, Tomas Villanueva, a well-known organizer who had a reputation for his activism for farm workers, agreed to help the UFW when they were in need of a leader for their march in Washington state. Villanueva joined Cesar Chavez in organizing the boycotts and strikes that occurred in Washington state. On September 21, 1986, Villanueva became the first president of the Washington state UFW. He was a great leader for the UFW activists in Washington since he led many strikes and influenced people to join the United Farm Workers movement. People who were against the movement started threatening leaders of the group such as Villanueva, but he continued organizing rallies. Even though there was some success in Washington state, the overall UFW membership started decreasing towards the end of the 1980s. Additionally, there was a major scare over pesticides in California at the time; watermelons would make the farm workers and consumers very ill. The UFW was outraged to hear about the use of illegal pesticides, and Chavez decided to fast for 36 days to protest the dangers pesticides had on farm workers and their community. This influenced the legislature in California to create more food testing programs, resulting in pesticide-free produce, and to encourage organic farming. = Recent developments = In July 2008 the farm worker Ramiro Carrillo Rodriguez, 48, died of a heat stroke. According to United Farm Workers, he was the \\"13th farm worker heat death since CA Governor Schwarzenegger took office\\" in 2003. In 2006 California's first permanent heat regulations were enactedNew Regulations Help Protect Workers From Heat , but these regulations were not strictly enforced, the union contended. Auturo \\"Artie\\" Rodriguez, former President of the UFW In 2013, farm workers working at a Fresno facility, for California's largest peach producer, voted to de- certify the United Farm Workers. News of this decertification was released to the public in 2018. C√©sar Ch√°vez is a film released in March 2014, directed by Diego Luna about the life of the Mexican-American labor leader who co-founded the United Farm Workers. The film stars Michael Pe√±a as Ch√°vez. Co-producer John Malkovich also co-stars in the role of an owner of a large industrial grape farm who leads the sometimes violent opposition to Ch√°vez's organizing efforts. The United Farm Workers of America‚Äôs work is dedicated to helping farm workers have the proper conditions in the work field and stand with them in the fight for equality. One of the issues that the UFW is constantly fighting for is the ongoing abuse that dairy workers at Darigold farms are facing. Darigold farms workers are known to have dealt with issues such as sexual harassment and wage theft. The UFW has taken an active role in a particular case called the ‚ÄúDarigold Dozen‚Äù. The Darigold Dozen are 12 dairy farm workers from Washington who filed a lawsuit against the dairy farm they are employed by for wage theft. The UFW held a 5 day Fast on September 20th, 2018 outside the Darigold headquarters to protest the poor work condition and treatments the Darigold farmers face and to bring attention to the Darigold Dozen. On May 8th, 2019 the employers of the Darigold Dozen dropped their countersuit against their former employees and dropped a lawsuit that they had filed against the UFW. The UFW continues to raise awareness on the treatment of Darigold farm workers and speaks out against Starbucks who buy their milk from the Darigold company. On the UFW website, they have flyers and videos about the conditions dairy farmers face, which they encourage people to share with others. Lastly, they have also emailed the CEO of Starbucks asking him to cut ties with Darigold company. Geography The grape strike officially began in Delano in September 1965. In December, union representatives traveled from California to New York, Washington, D.C., Pittsburgh, Detroit, and other large cities to encourage a boycott of grapes grown at ranches without UFW contracts. In the summer of 1966, unions and religious groups from Seattle and Portland endorsed the boycott. Supporters formed a boycott committee in Vancouver, prompting an outpouring of support from Canadians that continued throughout the following years. In 1967, UFW supporters in Oregon began picketing stores in Eugene, Salem, and Portland. After melon workers went on strike in Texas, growers held the first union representation elections in the region, and the UFW became the first union to ever sign a contract with a grower in Texas. National support for the UFW continued to grow in 1968, and hundreds of UFW members and supporters were arrested. Picketing continued throughout the country, including in Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, and Florida. The mayors of New York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Buffalo, Detroit, and other cities pledged their support, and many of them altered their cities‚Äô grape purchases to support the boycott. In 1969, support for farm workers increased throughout North America. The grape boycott spread into the South as civil rights groups pressured grocery stores in Atlanta, Miami, New Orleans, Nashville, and Louisville to remove non-union grapes. Student groups in New York protested the Department of Defense and accused them of deliberately purchasing boycotted grapes. On May 10, UFW supporters picketed Safeway stores throughout the U.S. and Canada in celebration of International Grape Boycott Day. Cesar Chavez also went on a speaking tour along the East Coast to ask for support from labor groups, religious groups, and universities. Mapping UFW Strikes, Boycotts, and Farm Worker Actions 1965-1975 shows over 1,000 farm worker strikes, boycotts, protests, and other actions as collected by El Macriado, Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Seattle Times, etc. Between 1965 and 1975 the United Farm Workers activism throughout the United States saw a tremendous increase, starting with just 7 states such as California, New York, Washington D.C., Mississippi, Arizona, Illinois, and Texas. This movement and fight for change have expanded to a total of 42 states in the span of 10 years. Other organizations that followed in the United Farm Workers fight to empower and seek justice for farm workers are Farm Labor Organizing Committee (FLOC) \\\\- 1967,Treeplanters & Farmworkers United of the Northwest (PCUN) - 1985, and Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW)\\\\- 1993 =Immigration= The UFW during Chavez's tenure was committed to restricting immigration. With the introduction of new laws restricting immigration like the Alien Contract Labor Act of 1885, Chavez and other like- minded individuals fought the influx of people that could hurt their cause. Chavez and Dolores Huerta, co-founder and president of the UFW, fought the Bracero Program that existed from 1942 to 1964. Their opposition stemmed from their belief that the program undermined U.S. workers and exploited the migrant workers. Since the Bracero Program ensured a constant supply of cheap immigrant labor for growers, immigrants could not protest any infringement of their rights, lest they be fired and replaced. Their efforts contributed to Congress ending the Bracero Program in 1964. In 1973, the UFW was one of the first labor unions to oppose proposed employer sanctions that would have prohibited hiring illegal immigrants. On a few occasions, concerns that illegal immigrant labor would undermine UFW strike campaigns led to controversial events, The UFW describes these as anti-strikebreaking events, but some have also interpreted them as anti-immigrant. In 1969, Chavez and members of the UFW marched through the Imperial and Coachella Valleys to the border of Mexico to protest growers' use of illegal immigrants as strikebreakers. In its early years, the UFW and Chavez went so far as to report illegal immigrants who served as strikebreaking replacement workers (as well as those who refused to unionize) to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.Farmworker Collective Bargaining, 1979: Hearings Before the Committee on Labor Human Resources Hearings held in Salinas, Calif., April 26, 27, and Washington, D.C., May 24, 1979 In 1973, the United Farm Workers set up a \\"wet line\\" along the United States-Mexico border to prevent Mexican immigrants from entering the United States illegally and potentially undermining the UFW's unionization efforts.\\"PBS Airs Ch√°vez Documentary\\", University of California at Davis ‚Äì Rural Migration News. During one such event, in which Chavez was not involved, some UFW members, under the guidance of Chavez's cousin Manuel, physically attacked the strikebreakers after peaceful attempts to persuade them not to cross the border failed. In 1979, Chavez used a forum of a U.S. Senate committee hearing to denounce the federal immigration service, which he said the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service purportedly refused to arrest illegal Mexican immigrants who Chavez claims are being used to break the union's strike.  Roles  The United Farm Workers, a working class movement, had received substantial support from the middle class, causing problems of power and control within the union. The UFW gave no structural power to farm workers, as there were no locals elected as staff. The survival of the staff wasn't linked directly to membership, since they made more money from outside sources than union dues. Today, the UFW only consists of five thousand members who work in very similar low conditions as they did 40 years ago. UFW includes undocumented farmworkers as well. The role of Cesar Chavez, the founder of UFW, was to frame his campaigns in terms of consumer safety and involving social justice, bringing benefits to the farmworker unions. One of UFW's, along with Cesar Chavez's, important aspects that has been overlooked is building coalitions. The United Farm Workers allows farmworkers to help improve their working conditions and wages. The UFW embraces nonviolence in its attempt to cultivate members on political and social issues. The union publicly adopted the principles of non-violence championed by Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. On July 22, 2005, the UFW announced that it was joining the Change to Win Federation, a coalition of labor unions functioning as an alternative to the AFL-CIO. On January 13, 2006, the union officially disaffiliated from the AFL-CIO. In contrast to other Change to Win-affiliated unions, the AFL-CIO neglected to offer the right of affiliation to regional bodies to the UFW.

Normal deformation is approximately 1.3:1:1. Only some nuclei can exist in superdeformed states. The first superdeformed states to be observed were the fission isomers, low-spin states of elements in the actinide and lanthanide series. The strong force decays much faster than the Coulomb force, which becomes stronger when nucleons are greater than 2.5 femtometers apart. For this reason, these elements undergo spontaneous fission. In the late 1980s, high-spin superdeformed rotational bands were observed in other regions of the periodic table. Specific elements include ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold, and mercury. The existence of superdeformed states occurs because of a combination of macroscopic and microscopic factors, which together lower their energies, and make them stable minima of energy as a function of deformation. Macroscopically, the nucleus can be described by the liquid drop model. The liquid drop's energy as a function of deformation is at a minimum for zero deformation, due to the surface tension term. However, the curve may become soft with respect to high deformations because of the Coulomb repulsion (especially for the fission isomers, which have high Z) and also, in the case of high-spin states, because of the increased moment of inertia. Modulating this macroscopic behavior, the microscopic shell correction creates certain superdeformed magic numbers that are analogous to the spherical magic numbers. For nuclei near these magic numbers, the shell correction creates a second minimum in the energy as a function of deformation. Even more deformed states (3:1) are called hyperdeformed.

In 1989, his sophomore album, Life Is...Too Short, drew wide notice, and he remained prominent into the 1990s. Early life Shaw was born and grew up in South Central Los Angeles, California. In the early 1980s, Shaw and his family moved to Oakland, California. He was a drummer in the band at Fremont High School in Oakland. Career In the mid-1980s, Shaw along with a high school friend Freddy B, produced custom songs (called \\"special requests\\") locally on cassette for people in Oakland and the Bay Area. In 1985, Too Short started his solo career and released his debut album, Don't Stop Rappin' on Oakland record label 75 Girls Records And Tapes which, along with four 12\\" releases, featured raw, simple drum beats from a LinnDrum drum machine. This was also one of the first hip hop records to use the word \\"bitch\\" - a word which became one of the rapper's trademarks and was the focus of subsequent raps such as \\"Ain't Nothin' but a Word to Me\\". In the early 1990s his self-produced beats came from mostly a TR-808 and from mid-to-late 2000s, a TR-909 was used. In 1985, Too Short and Freddie B. formed the label Dangerous Music to regionally distribute his music, and with others formed rap group the Dangerous Crew.Bush, John. [ Too Short - Biography]. AllMusic. Retrieved Sept. 16, 2007. Dangerous Music became Short Records, and then Up All Nite Records. With his 1989 release, Life Is...Too Short, he began using replayed established funk riffs (rather than samples) with his beats. Subsequent work was primarily collaborative, including work with Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Scarface, and Pimp C. One of his notable collaborations during this period was on the track \\"The World Is Filled...\\" on the classic Notorious B.I.G. album Life After Death; he comes in on the third verse after Diddy and Biggie. Being featured on the album introduced him to a wider audience as well, due to his typical style contrasting greatly with the Mafioso theme of the album. He also appeared on TWDY's hit single \\"Player's Holiday\\" from their 1999 debut album Derty Werk[ TWDY - \\"Player's Holiday\\"], AllMusic. as well as the Priority Records compilation Nuthin but a Gangsta Party.Wilson, MacKenzie.

MTV: June 29, 1999. Too Short relocated to Atlanta in 1994, but he did not begin working with a more diverse variety of Southern artists until 2000, when he collaborated with Lil Jon. With the 1999 release of Can't Stay Away, Too Short came out of retirement, continuing his sexually explicit, relaxed style of rap. New albums released 2000-2003 were You Nasty (2000), Chase the Cat (2001), What's My Favorite Word? (2002), and Married to the Game (2003). These albums all charted fairly well, as they all were in the top 71 of the Billboard 200, but they didn't do quite as well as Too Short's earlier 1990s releases as none of them reached the top 10.[ Too Short > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums] In 2004, his earlier 1990 single \\"The Ghetto\\" appeared on popular video game Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, playing on West Coast hip hop radio station Radio Los Santos. Given that this was an incredibly popular game at the time, the featuring was acclaimed as a success for Too $hort, both in publicity and in the fame generated by the song. For his next album, Blow the Whistle (2006), Too Short now took advantage of the new hyphy rap music that was emerging out of his original home base in Oakland. This saw somewhat of a resurgence for Too Short as it peaked at #14 on the Billboard 200, much better than each of his previous three releases. However, his subsequent releases, such as 2007's Get Off the Stage, have not been as successful. On October 7, 2008 Too Short was honored by VH1 at the fifth annual \\"Hip-Hop Honors\\" along with Cypress Hill, De La Soul, Slick Rick and Naughty By Nature. In 2009, Too Short recorded for Daz Dillinger, Lil Jon, Soopafly, Scarface and B-Legit. In 2011, the rapper was featured on Wiz Khalifa's song \\"On My Level\\". He also collaborated in Snoop Dogg's 2011 album, Doggumentary in the song \\"Take U Home\\" and on the 50 Cent song \\"First Date\\". In 2012 Too Short along with E-40 released two collaboration albums on the same day titled History: Mob Music and History: Function Music. Both charted in the top 100 on the Billboard 200 albums chart. Too Short has said the best verse he has ever recorded is a verse for a song on Dr. Dre's Detox called \\"Man's Best Friend (Pussy)\\". In 2013, it was announced he would collaborate with Lady Gaga on a song \\"Jewels n' Drugs\\" for her upcoming album Artpop. Also featured on the song are T.I. and Twista. In 2013, Too Short was featured on the song The Compliments by the Lonely Island on the wack album. In 2015, Too Short was featured on actor Tavion Tate Guice also known as Tavion Millioune's song \\"Oakland Brookfield Dance\\". In 2016, Too Short was featured on the song \\"Cochino\\" by Korean American rapper Dumbfoundead. The song is the seventh track off of Dumbfoundead's fifth studio album We Might Die. After 30 years of his career, Too Short released his 20th and final album The Pimp Tape on November 9, 2018. Up All Nite Records Too Short runs his own record label‚ÄîUp All Nite Records.

Patty Hearst, Suzanne Somers, Joan Rivers, Traci Lords, and Brigid Berlin make cameo appearances in the film. The film was released theatrically in the United States on April 13, 1994 to mixed to positive reviews from critics, but was a box office bomb, grossing nearly $8 million from a $13 million budget. The film is widely regarded as a cult classic. Plot Beverly Sutphin appears to be a typical suburban housewife living with her dentist husband, Eugene, and their teenage children, Misty and Chip, in the suburbs of Baltimore. However, she is secretly a serial killer, murdering people over the most trivial of perceived slights, including mere faux pas. During breakfast, Detectives Pike and Gracey arrive to question the family about the vulgar harassment of their neighbor, Dottie Hinkle. After the police and her family leave, Beverly disguises her voice to make obscene phone calls to Dottie, revealed in a flashback to be retaliation for Dottie previously stealing a parking space from Beverly. Later that day, Mr. Stubbins, Chip's math teacher, becomes Beverly's first known murder victim after he criticizes Chip's interests and questions the boy's mental health and family life, as well as berating her parenting. Beverly runs Mr. Stubbins over with her car, and is witnessed by Luann Hodges, a young woman smoking marijuana nearby. The next day, Misty is upset when Carl Pageant stands her up for a date. Beverly spots Carl with another girl at a swap meet and murders him in the bathroom with a fireplace poker. Eugene discovers that Beverly has hidden a collection of serial killer memorabilia beneath their mattress. That evening at dinner, Chip comments that his friend Scotty thinks that she is the killer. Beverly immediately leaves in her car, prompting the family to rush to Scotty's house for fear that Beverly plans to kill him; however, Beverly has actually gone to kill Eugene's patient Ralph Sterner and his wife, Betty, for calling Eugene away to treat her husband's chronic toothache on a Saturday they were supposed to spend birdwatching, and for eating chicken that reminds her of the starlings. She stabs Betty with scissors borrowed from the Sutphins' neighbor Rosemary, and pushes an air conditioner from a second-story window onto Ralph, standing on the walkway below. Meanwhile, the rest of the family and the police arrive at Scotty's house, only to find him in his room masturbating to an old porn video. That Sunday, police follow the Sutphins to church and a news report names Beverly as the suspect in the Sterners' murders. The service ends in pandemonium when the sound of Beverly sneezing causes everyone to panic and flee the church. Police detectives confirm that Beverly's fingerprints match those at the Sterner crime scene and attempt to arrest her, but she escapes. She hides at the video rental store where Chip works, but a customer, Mrs. Jensen, argues with Chip over paying a fee for failing to rewind a videotape and calls him a \\"son of a psycho\\". Beverly follows Mrs. Jensen home and bludgeons her to death with a leg of lamb while she sings along to \\"Tomorrow\\" on her rented copy of Annie. Scotty witnesses the attack through a window, Beverly sees him, and a car chase ensues. Catching him at a local club, Hammerjack's, Beverly sets Scotty aflame onstage in front of a deranged crowd during the set of an all-female band called Camel Lips. The Sutphin family arrive, as do the police, and Beverly is arrested. Beverly's trial becomes a national sensation. The media dub her \\"Serial Mom\\", Chip hires an agent to manage the family's media appearances and Misty sells merchandise outside the courthouse. During opening arguments, Beverly's lawyer claims that she is not guilty by reason of insanity, but she fires him and proposes to represent herself, citing various law books she has read, to her prosecutor's dismay. The judge reluctantly agrees and the trial begins. Beverly proves to be extremely skilled and formidable in defending herself, systematically discrediting nearly every witness against her by using trick questioning to incite Dottie to contempt of court by repeated obscenities; finding a transsexual-themed magazine in Gracey's trash, invoking that judging a person by what they choose to read proves nothing; badgering Rosemary into admitting she doesn't recycle; and fanning her legs repeatedly at pervert Marvin Pickles, witness to Carl's murder, whose resulting over-arousal causes him to commit perjury. The only witness she does not actively discredit is Luann Hodges, but Hodges is unable to provide credible testimony anyway, due to being under the influence of marijuana. During Pike's crucial testimony, the entire courtroom (including the judge and jury) is distracted by the arrival of Suzanne Somers, who plans to portray Beverly as the heroine of a television film. Beverly is acquitted of all charges, stunning her family, who vow to \\"never get on her nerves\\". Throughout the trial, Beverly has been displeased that a juror (Patty Hearst) is wearing white shoes after Labor Day. Beverly follows her to a payphone and fatally strikes her in the head with the receiver. Somers then angers Beverly into an outburst by trying to pose for a picture that will show Beverly's \\"bad side\\", just as the juror's body is discovered. The film ends with a close-up of Beverly's wicked smile and a caption stating that Beverly \\"refused to cooperate\\" with the making of the film.

Films by Waters' creative influences, including Doris Wishman, Otto Preminger, William Castle and Herschell Gordon Lewis, are seen playing on television sets throughout the film. The audio for Ted Bundy in one of Beverly's correspondences with the jailed killer is the voice of Waters. Release The film was screened out of competition at the 1994 Cannes Film Festival. =Critical reception= The film received mixed to positive reviews from critics, and currently holds a 63% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 48 reviews. Roger Ebert awarded it an average two stars (out of a possible four) finding some of Waters' satire effective but feeling that Kathleen Turner's decision to portray her character's mental illness with realism instead of in a campy fashion, while brave, made the character difficult to laugh at, writing, \\"Watch Serial Mom closely and you'll realize that something is miscalculated at a fundamental level. Turner's character is helpless and unwitting in a way that makes us feel almost sorry for her‚Äîand that undermines the humor. She isn't funny crazy, she's sick crazy.\\" However, other critics were more enthusiastic about the film and Turner's performance; Cosmopolitan stated in its review that \\"Turner has never been so over the top hilarious!\\", and Scene magazine called the film \\"Hysterically funny!\\". Critics lauded Waters' style and savage satire of the US's obsession with true crime, such as when Beverly's daughter, Misty, is seen selling T-shirts outside the courthouse where her mother's fate will be decided. =Box office= The film opened on April 13, 1994 and grossed $2,040,450 in its opening weekend, ranking #11.

Several of his works have been adapted as theatrical and television movies. Biography Tony Hillerman was born in Sacred Heart, Oklahoma to August Alfred Hillerman, a farmer and shopkeeper, and his wife, Lucy Grove. He was the youngest of their three children, and the second son. His paternal grandparents were born in Germany, and his maternal grandparents were born in England. He grew up in Pottawatomie County, Oklahoma, attending elementary and high school with Potawatomie children. He was a decorated combat veteran of World War II, serving from August 1943 to October 1945. He served as a mortar-man in the 103rd Infantry Division. He earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart. He attended the University of Oklahoma after the war, meeting Marie Unzner, a student in microbiology. The couple wed and have one biological child and five adopted children. From 1948‚Äì62, he worked as a journalist, moving to Santa Fe, New Mexico in 1952. In 1966, he moved his family to Albuquerque, where he earned a master's degree from the University of New Mexico. It was during his time as a writer for the Borger News-Herald in Borger, Texas that he became acquainted with the sheriff of Hutchinson County, the man upon whom he would pattern the main character in his Joe Leaphorn novels. He taught journalism from 1966 to 1987 at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, and also began writing novels. He lived there with his wife Marie until his death in 2008. At the time of his death, they had been married 60 years and had ten grandchildren. A consistently bestselling author, he was ranked as New Mexico's 22nd wealthiest man in 1996. He wrote 18 books in his Navajo series. He wrote more than 30 books total, among them a memoir and books about the Southwest, its beauty and its history. His literary honors were awarded for his Navajo books. Hillerman's books have been translated into eight languages, among them Danish and Japanese. Hillerman's writing is noted for the cultural details he provides about his subjects: Hopi, Zuni, European-American, federal agents, and especially Navajo Tribal Police. His works in nonfiction and in fiction reflect his appreciation of the natural wonders of the American Southwest and his appreciation of its people, particularly the Navajo. His mystery novels are set in the Four Corners area of New Mexico and Arizona, sometimes reaching into Colorado and Utah, with occasional forays to the big cities of Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and New York City. The protagonists are Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee of the Navajo tribal police. Lt. Leaphorn was introduced in Hillerman's first novel, The Blessing Way (1970). Sgt. Jim Chee was introduced in the fourth novel, People of Darkness. The two first work together in the seventh novel, Skinwalkers, considered his breakout novel, with a distinct increase in sales with the two police officers working together. Hillerman repeatedly acknowledged his debt to an earlier series of mystery novels written by the British-born Australian author Arthur W. Upfield and set among tribal aborigines in remote desert regions of tropical and subtropical Australia. The Upfield novels began to be published in 1928 and featured a half-European, half-aboriginal Australian hero, Detective-inspector Napoleon (Bony) Bonaparte. Bony worked with deep understanding of tribal traditions. The character was based on the achievements of an aborigine known as Tracker Leon, whom Upfield had met during his years in the Australian bush. Hillerman discussed his debt to Upfield in many interviews and in his introduction to the posthumous 1984 reprint of Upfield's A Royal Abduction. In the introduction, he described the appeal of the descriptions in Upfield's crime novels. It was descriptions both of the harsh outback areas and of \\"the people who somehow survived upon them\\" that lured him. \\"When my own Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal Police unravels a mystery because he understands the ways of his people, when he reads the signs in the sandy bottom of a reservation arroyo, he is walking in the tracks Bony made 50 years ago.\\" He also mentioned Eric Ambler, Graham Greene and Raymond Chandler as authors who influenced him as he wrote the Leaphorn and Chee novels. Tony Hillerman died on October 26, 2008, of pulmonary failure in Albuquerque at the age of 83. Recognition beyond the US In an interview published in Le Monde, Hillerman said his Navajo name means \\"He who is afraid of his horse.\\" His novels were popular in France. Hillerman credits that popularity both to French curiosity about other cultures and to his translator, Pierre Bondil. Legacy and honors The Tony Hillerman Library in Albuquerque, named in his honor. Hillerman is considered one of New Mexico's foremost novelists. In Albuquerque, the Tony Hillerman Library was dedicated in 2008, and the Tony Hillerman Middle School (part of Volcano Vista High School) opened in 2009. Dance Hall of the Dead, published in 1973 earned Hillerman the Grand Prix de Litt√©rature Polici√®re in 1987, a French international literary honor. Hillerman was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Literature (Litt.D.) from the University of New Mexico in 1990. He was awarded the Owen Wister Award in 2008 for \\"Outstanding Contributions to the American West.\\" Awards Hillerman was a decorated combat veteran of World War II; he earned the Silver Star, the Bronze Star, and a Purple Heart as a mortarman in the 103rd Infantry Division. He won and was nominated for numerous awards for his writing and his work with other writers. His first nomination came in 1972, with his novel The Fly on the Wall being nominated for an Edgar Award in the \\"Best Mystery Novel\\" category. Two years later his novel Dance Hall of the Dead, second book in the Leaphorn-Chee series, won the 1974 Edgar Award for Best Novel. He was again nominated for the \\"Best Mystery Novel\\" Edgar Award in 1979 for Listening Woman and lastly in 1989 for A Thief of Time. Hillerman's non-fictional work Talking Mysteries was nominated in 1992 for the Edgar Award in the \\"Best Critical or Biographical\\" category. In 1987, Hillerman received the Grand Prix de Litt√©rature Polici√®re for Dance Hall of the Dead. In 1991, Hillerman received the MWA's Grand Master Award. Hillerman received the Nero Award for Coyote Waits and the Navajo Tribe's Special Friends of the Dineh Award. Hillerman has also been successful at the annual Anthony Awards. His novel Skinwalkers won the 1988 Anthony Award for \\"Best Novel\\" and in the following year A Thief of Time was nominated for the 1989 Anthony Award in the same category. His next nomination was for his Talking Mysteries non-fictional work which was nominated at the 1992 Anthony Awards. His novel Sacred Clowns received a \\"Best Novel\\" nomination at the 1994 Anthony Awards; and the following year his short-story collection The Mysterious West won the 1995 Anthony Award in the \\"Best Anthology/Short Story Collection\\" category. His last win came at the 2002 Anthony Awards at which he won the \\"Best Non-fiction/Critical Work\\" award for his memoir Seldom Disappointed. Two of the Navajo Police novels won The Spur award, given by the Western Writers of America annually. Skinwalkers won the award in 1987 for Western Novel, and The Shape Shifter won in 2007 for Best Western Short Novel. Seldom Disappointed: A Memoir won the Agatha Award in 2001. Hillerman's novels were recognized at the Macavity Awards. A Thief of Time won the \\"Best Novel\\" award in 1989 and Talking Mysteries won the \\"Best Critical/Biographical\\" award in 1992. Seldom Disappointed also received a nomination in the \\"Best Biographical/Critical Mystery Work\\" category in 2002. He received the Parris Award in 1995 by Southwest Writer's Workshop for his outstanding service to other writers. In 2002, Hillerman received the Agatha Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement, given by Malice Domestic for mystery novels in the spirit of Agatha Christie.

The gate was donated by Jane K. Sather, a benefactor of the university, in memory of her late husband Peder Sather, a trustee of the College of California, which later became the University of California. It is California Historical Landmark No. 946 and No. 82004649 in the National Register of Historic Places.  History  Sather Gate with its metalwork removed in November 2008 Grey granite campana urn with oak and laurel leaves victor ludorum carving c1908 on the Sather Gate at UC Berkeley Designed by John Galen Howard and built by Giovanni \\"John\\" Meneghetti in the Classical Revival Beaux-Arts style, Sather Gate was completed in 1910. Atop the gate are eight panels of bas-relief figures: four nude men representing the disciplines of law, letters, medicine, and mining, and four nude women representing the disciplines of agriculture, architecture, art, and electricity. They were sculpted by Professor Earl Cummings. From 1910-77 the panels were removed due to differences with Jane Sather. By 1979 they were all reinstalled. Originally, the gate served as the terminus of Telegraph Avenue, and marked the University's south entrance. (The circle in front of the gate served as a turning point for the trolleys coming from Oakland.) The University later expanded further south of Strawberry Creek, and the gate is now well separated from Berkeley's city streets by Sproul Plaza. Sather Gate has undergone restoration beginning in October 2008 that focused on its bronze and steel metal work, which had deteriorated over time. During its restoration it remained open to pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Restoration of Sather Gate was completed in April 2009. Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates, Inc., coordinated the restoration of Sather Gate; a 2010 Design Award recipient from the California Preservation Foundation. = Free Speech Movement = Sather Gate is part of the historic Sproul Plaza, a major center for student activity that housed many protests throughout the Free Speech Movement. The gate is a notable subject of one of the most recognizable and iconic photographs of the movement, a shot of students carrying the Free Speech banner walking through it in Fall of 1964.

Glomerulonephritis is often implied when using the term \\"nephritis\\" without qualification. * Interstitial nephritis (or tubulo-interstitial nephritis) is inflammation of the spaces between renal tubules. Causes Nephritis is often caused by infections, and toxins, but is most commonly caused by autoimmune disorders that affect the major organs like kidneys. * Pyelonephritis is inflammation that results from a urinary tract infection that reaches the renal pelvis of the kidney. * Lupus nephritis is inflammation of the kidney caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a disease of the immune system. * Athletic nephritis is nephritis resulting from strenuous exercise. Bloody urine after strenuous exercise may also result from march hemoglobinuria, which is caused by trauma to red blood cells, causing their rupture, which leads to the release of hemoglobin into the urine. Mechanism Renin‚Äìangiotensin system Nephritis can produce glomerular injury, by disturbing the glomerular structure with inflammatory cell proliferation. This can lead to reduced glomerular blood flow, leading to reduced urine output (oliguria) and retention of waste products (uremia). As a result, red blood cells may leak out of damaged glomeruli, causing blood to appear in the urine (hematuria). Low renal blood flow activates the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system (RAAS), causing fluid retention and mild hypertension. As the kidneys inflame, they begin to excrete needed protein from the affected individual's body into the urine stream. This condition is called proteinuria. Loss of necessary protein due to nephritis can result in several life-threatening symptoms. The most serious complication of nephritis can occur if there is significant loss of the proteins that keep blood from clotting excessively. Loss of these proteins can result in blood clots, causing sudden stroke. Diagnosis The diagnosis depends on the cause of the nephritis, in the case of lupus nephritis, blood tests, X-rays and an ultrasound can help ascertain if the individual has the condition. Treatment Disease burden of nephritis/nephrosis worldwide in 2004. Treatment (or management) of nephritis depends on what has provoked the inflammation of the kidney(s).

Worldwide the highest rates of nephritis are 50-55% for African or Asian descent, then Hispanic at 43% and Caucasian at 17%.

They are among the most basal living spiders, belonging to the suborder Mesothelae. In Japan, the Kimura spider (Heptathela kimurai) is well known. Biology Burrow of Heptathela kimurai Liphistiidae are tube-dwelling spiders that construct rudimentary trap-doors. They spend most of their time here and are rarely seen above ground. The medium to large spiders range from eight to twenty-three millimeters long. They are characterized by their downward pointing, daggerlike chelicerae, and the segmented series of plates on the upper surface of the abdomen. The carapace is mostly flat, though it can be slightly elevated near the head. The eyes are distinctly clustered together on a single nodule. Anterior median eyes are small, but posterior median eyes are large and round. The lateral eyes are long and kidney-shaped. The distal leg segments have strong spines and three claws. Chelicerae are vertically attached to the cephalothorax. In the past, they were frequently believed to lack venom, but in 2010 it was shown that at least Liphistius species have venom glands. They are active at night and live for many years. Although most species live in burrows, cave- dwelling species also fasten their retreats to the cave walls. Both burrows and retreats are sealed with woven doors. Trapdoor nests are generally built in shady areas with moss or sparse vegetation. Some make silk trip-lines radiating away from the burrow entrance. Adult males sometimes wander in search for females, but females rarely leave their burrows. The respiratory system consists only of book lungs, which could help explain why they are relatively inactive. Systematics Although they have downward pointing chelicerae like the Mygalomorphae, there is no close relationship between the two. It is thought that the common ancestor of all spiders was orthognath and that in the Opisthothelae, comprising Mygalomorphae (mostly tarantulas) and Araneomorphae (all other spiders), only the Araneomorphae changed their alignment of chelicerae, while the mygalomorphs retained this symplesiomorphic feature. Ryuthela sasakii =Phylogeny= Molecular phylogenetic studies have repeatedly shown that the family is monophyletic, at least as regards extant (living) species. The relationship between the genera is shown in the following cladogram: In 1923, Kyukichi Kishida suggested dividing the family into two subfamilies, Liphistiinae and Heptathelinae, corresponding to the genera Liphistius and Heptathela. More genera have since been added to the family, but the subfamily division has been upheld by modern phylogenetic studies. Liphistius, the sole genus in the subfamily Liphistiinae, is found only in Southeast Asia (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia and Sumatra). The Heptathelinae are found further north: five genera in northern Vietnam and China and two genera in Japan and offshore islands (Okinawa, Ryukyu Islands). =Genera= , the World Spider Catalog accepts the following genera: *Ganthela Xu & Kuntner, 2015 ‚Äî China *Heptathela Kishida, 1923 ‚Äî Japan *Liphistius Schi√∂dte, 1849 ‚Äî Asia *Qiongthela Xu & Kuntner, 2015 ‚Äî Vietnam, China *Ryuthela Haupt, 1983 ‚Äî Japan *Sinothela Haupt, 2003 ‚Äî China *Songthela Ono, 2000 ‚Äî China, Vietnam *Vinathela Ono, 2000 ‚Äî Vietnam, China One genus of fossil spiders, Cretaceothele Wunderlich, 2015, was originally placed in this family, but it was subsequently transferred to the separate family Cretaceothelidae. =Threatened Malaysian species= Three of the Liphistius species known to exist in Malaysia are endemic to only one or two caves. The most well known is Liphistius batuensis, which is found in Batu Caves. Other species found in Malaysia include Liphistius malayanus, Liphistius murphyorum and Liphistius desultor. The Malaysian trapdoor spiders are protected by local law, though continuous threats come from loss of habitat and collection by exotic pet traders. It is believed that these species are endemic and once an isolated habitat is destroyed, the species may go extinct. Fossil record While some Carboniferous fossil spiders have been assigned to Mesothelae, the only fossil to be explicitly placed in the family Liphistiidae is Cretaceothele lata Wunderlich, 2015 from the Cretaceous Burmese amber of Myanmar. The fossil genus was diagnosed as having an eye-field wider than that in living species. It was later placed in its own, monotypic family.

The region includes settlements located on the shore of Lake Scutari, some 7 km north of the city of Shkod√´r. This ethnographic region is inhabited by Serb-Montenegrins, Podgori√ßani (Slavic Muslims) and Albanians; it used to be mainly inhabited by Serb-Montenegrins. A small Serbo-Montenegrin community migrated and established itself in Vraka during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The majority of the Serbo-Montenegrin community came to Vraka, Albania from Montenegro during the interwar Zogist period following 1926 and later from 1938 until 1948. By the year 2010 most of the Orthodox families returned to Montenegro and Serbia. Today (2019) there are only few families living there (less than five).

More recently, Montenegrins and Serbs began migrating to Vraka in the late 17th century. According to Jovan Erdeljanoviƒá, in his book Stara Crna Gora, all descendants of Jovan Martinoviƒá, who has been mentioned since 1687, have emigrated to Vraka. From confirmed documents, one of the first families to inhabit the area of Vraka was in 1705 were the ƒêurƒçeviƒái from the village of Momƒçe in Kuƒçi. A certain Jerko ƒêurƒçeviƒá was the only one from his clan in Vraka to convert to Islam. His descendants later became known as the Jerkoviƒái, who are found in the village of ≈†toj, near Ulcinj. According to Edith Durham the people of Vraka had fled from Bosnia and Montenegro, because of blood feud. =Modern history= Woman from Vrak√´. Following the Great Eastern Crisis, from 1878 onward a small Muslim Montenegrin speaking community living in the region exists and are known as Podgori√ßani, due to their origins from Podgorica in Montenegro. pp. 394‚Äì395. \\"As noted above, the vernacular mobility term ‚ÄòPodgori√ßani‚Äô (literally meaning ‚Äòpeople that came from Podgori√ßa‚Äô, the present-day capital of Montenegro) refers to the progeny of Balkan Muslims, who migrated to Shkodra in four historical periods and in highest numbers after the Congress of Berlin 1878. Like the Ulqinak, the Podgori√ßani thus personify the mass forced displacement of the Muslim population from the Balkans and the ‚Äòunmixing of peoples‚Äô (see e.g. Brubaker 1996, 153) at the time of the retreat of the Ottoman Empire, which has only recently sparked renewed scholarly interest (e.g. Blumi 2013; Chatty 2013).\\" p. 142. \\"Migration to Shkodra was mostly from the villages to the south-east of the city and from the cities of Podgorica and Ulcinj in Montenegro. This was connected to the independence of Montenegro from the Ottoman Empire in the year 1878 and the acquisition of additional territories, e.g. Ulcinj in 1881 (Ippen, 1907, p. 3).\\" In 1909, the Eparchy of Ra≈°ka‚ÄìPrizren had 15 protopresbyteriates, the last of which was Skadar, where the parish of Vraka contained 119 households (villages Novi Boriƒç, Stari Boriƒç, Grilj, Ra≈°, Kule, Omara, Turajlije, Kamenica) with a church in Novi Boriƒç dedicated to Assumption of the Holy Virgin, parish under Petar Mrekoviƒá. In 1918, beside the Serbian Orthodox in Scutari, there were communities in different neighbouring villages such as Vraka, Vramenica, Derigniat, etc., as well as several thousands of Slavic Muslims of Montenegrin and Bosnia-Herzegovina origin. In 1920, the following villages had Serbian majority or plurality: Brch, Basits, Vraka, Sterbets, Kadrum. Farming was the chief occupation of the villages. Vraka is known for having been the place where poet Millosh Gjergj Nikolla became teacher on 23 April 1933, and it was in this period that he started to write prose sketches and verses. The village of Vraka was at the time entirely inhabited by Serb- Montenegrins. The Serb school in Vrake was destroyed in 1934. A period of immigration existed between 1925 and 1934. This wave marked the migration of many Serb-Montenegrin families to Montenegro, Serbia proper and Kosovo, leaving their homes in Vraka behind. For example, Rrash-Kullaj was inhabited by Serbs‚ÄìMontenegrins until World War II when the whole population emigrated to Yugoslavia. As part of a campaign of state promoted atheism, Albanian communist leader Enver Hoxha destroyed Serbian cemeteries and two Serb churches. In 1990 most of the minority community of Vraka went to Montenegro. As the border opened up, many members of the community left between March- December 1991 for Montenegro and Vraka, Bori√ß and other nearby areas became severely depopulated. During that time with economic problems and tensions arising in areas of the former Yugoslavia, it made some 600 of them return home to Albania. \\"Vraka to the north of the city of Shkodra and near the border with Montenegro. There are no accurate data about this ethnic minority in the population census of 1989. It was considered that it consisted of about 2,000 people. Almost all of them left for Montenegro in 1990. Economic difficulties and the tensions created in the former Yugoslavia urged about 600 of them to return to their homes in Albania. In 1992, the Moraƒça-Rozafa Association was established. During the Yugoslav Wars, there were incidents of violence against the Serb-Montenegrin minority in places like Bori√ß i Vog√´l and Bori√ß i Madh, where the Albanian government tried to forcibly take land from them. There were reports that the Albanian government also attempted to forcibly resettle Serb-Montenegrins and Podgori√ßani from Bori√ß i Vog√´l, Bori√ß i Madh, Vraka and other places. In March 1992, as part of state policy by Serbia and Montenegro to increase the numbers of Serbs in Kosovo, nearly 3,000 people from the Serb minority in Albania emigrated to the region after accepting a government offer for employment and housing in the area. p. 65. \\"Shkod√´r... Elle comprenait six √† sept cents personnes dans la ville, dont cinq √† six cents ¬´Serbo-Montenegrins¬ª... Le village de Vrak√´, situ√© √† une heure - une heure et demie de march au nord de Shkod√´r, comptait sept √† huit cent orthodoxes slavophones. D'apr√®s le consul fran√ßais, les habitants de ce village souhaitaient etre rattach√©s au Mont√©n√©gro, ce qui √©tait imposible √©tant donn√© l'√©loignement de la frontier.[15]... [15] Un si√®cle plus tard, leurs descendants ont fini par √©migrer en Yougoslavie apr√®s la chute de r√©gime communiste et ont √©t√© installes‚Ä¶ au Kosovo.\\" Another wave came back due to the Kosovo War. In the early twenty first century, the community lives largely on trade with Montenegro and communal relations with Albanian inhabitants are regarded as good by many of its members. Demographics The region serves as the centre of the Serb-Montenegrin minority in Albania (as listed in the census). The estimations of the total number of Serb-Montenegrins in the area vary from 1,000 to over 2,000. The community has retained their language, culture and religion. The minority association of the community, the \\"Moraƒça- Rozafa\\", represents the interests of this minority in Shkod√´r. During the early 2010s linguists Klaus Steinke and Xhelal Ylli seeking to corroborate villages cited in past literature as being Slavic speaking carried out fieldwork in settlements of the area. Of the Shkod√´r area exists seven villages with a Slavophone population that speak a Montenegrin dialect. * Bori√ß i Madh - one third of the population is compact and composed of Muslim Podgori√ßani. * Bori√ß i Vog√´l - inhabited by 15 families and the Slavophone families are the only compact group of the Orthodox in Vraka. * Gril - the village officially has 1,090 inhabitants or 195 families, while the number of Orthodox Montenegrin families there varies between 2, 3 - 10. An Albanian school exists in Gril, along with a newly built Orthodox church that is without a priest. According to Slavophone locals the Orthodox population moved to Darragjat due to blood feuds related with Montenegro and relocated themselves to the Vraka area such as Gril between 1935-1936. Some Orthodox Montenegrins from the village moved to Montenegro in the 1990s with some thereafter returning to Gril. * Omaraj - in the village only two Orthodox Montenegrin families remain. * Kamic√´ - the village is almost deserted, with five or six minority Orthodox Montenegrin families left, alongside the few Albanian families. * Shtoj i Ri - the village has a compact population of 17 Muslim Podgori√ßani families. * Shtoj i Vjet√´r - the village has a compact population of 30 Muslim Podgori√ßani families. p. 20. \\"Au√üer in Bori√ßi i Madh und auch in Shtoj, wo die Slavophonen eine kompakte Gruppe innerhalb des jeweiligen Ortes bilden, sind sie in anderen Dorfern zahlenm√§√üig bedeutunglos geworden.\\"; p. 103. \\"Bori√ßi i Madh - Boriƒá Veli.

Die- ins are actions that have been used by a variety of protest groups on topics such as animal rights, anti-war, against traffic violence,History of Cycling in the Netherlands human rights, AIDS, gun control, and environmental issues. Often, protestors occupy an area for a short time instead of being forced to leave by the police. In the simplest form of a die-in, protesters simply lie down on the ground and pretend to be dead, sometimes covering themselves with signs or banners. The point of a die-in is to disrupt the flow of people on a street or sidewalk to grab the attention of passersby. In more complex forms, fake blood or blood-stained bandages are sometimes used, as well as simulated death throes and writhing from the protesters in an attempt to make the deaths appear more realistic. In other cases, protesters have surrounded the \\"bodies\\" in chalk outlines reminiscent of the troped outlines around murder victims. This has been done as an attempt to symbolize that the organization being protested against has \\"murdered\\" people. Sometimes, part of the protesting group makes speeches about what is being protested while the rest of the group lies on the ground.  Examples  On 22 April 2006, thousands of protesters lay in the Francisco de Miranda avenue in Caracas, Venezuela, to protest against crime and insecurity during Hugo Ch√°vez's government in a protest by Movimiento Estudiantil called \\"Acu√©state por la vida\\" (Lie Down for Life).

Following the independence of most of the territories from the United Kingdom, the term Commonwealth Caribbean is now used. In 1912, the British government divided their territories into different colonies: The Bahamas, Barbados, British Guiana, British Honduras, Jamaica (with its dependencies the Turks and Caicos Islands and the Cayman Islands), Trinidad and Tobago, the Windward Islands, and the Leeward Islands. Between 1958 and 1962, all of the island territories except the British Virgin Islands and the Bahamas were organised into the West Indies Federation. It was hoped that the Federation would become independent as a single nation, but it had limited powers and faced many practical problems. Consequently, the West Indies Federation was dissolved in 1962. The territories are now fully independent sovereign states, except for five - Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Montserrat, and the Turks and Caicos Islands - which remain British Overseas Territories, as does Bermuda. All remain within the Commonwealth of Nations. They also established the Caribbean Community, and many of the nations have joined various international bodies, such as the Organization of American States, the Association of Caribbean States, the World Trade Organization, the United Nations, and the Caribbean Development Bank among others. The remaining British Overseas Territories in the region Territories The territories that were originally part of the British West Indies are (date of independence, where applicable, in brackets): * The Bahamas (1973) * Barbados (1966) * Belize (formerly British Honduras) (1981) * Bermuda (British overseas territory) * British Leeward Islands ** Anguilla (British overseas territory) ** Antigua and Barbuda (1981) ** British Virgin Islands (British overseas territory) ** Dominica (1978) ** Montserrat (British overseas territory) ** Saint Kitts and Nevis (1983) * British Windward Islands ** Grenada (1974) ** Saint Lucia (1979) ** Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (1979) * Cayman Islands (British overseas territory) * Guyana (formerly British Guiana) (1966) * Jamaica (formerly Colony of Jamaica) (1962) * Trinidad and Tobago (1962) * Turks and Caicos Islands (British overseas territory) History =Leeward Islands= A linen market in Dominica in the 1770s Sir William Stapleton established the first federation in the British West Indies in 1674. He set up a General Assembly of the Leeward Islands in St. Kitts. Stapleton's Federation was active between 1674 and 1685, during his term as governor, and the General Assembly met regularly until 1711. By the 18th century, each island had kept its own Assembly and made its own laws. The islands continued to share one Governor and one Attorney-General. Although unpopular, Stapleton's Federation was never really dissolved but simply replaced by other arrangements. Planting the sugar cane, Antigua, 1823 Between 1816 and 1833, the Leewards were divided into two groups: St. Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla and Antigua-Barbuda- Montserrat, each with its own Governor. In 1833 all the Leeward Islands were brought together, and Dominica was added, remaining as part of the group until 1940. In 1869, Governor Benjamin Pine was assigned to organise a federation of Antigua-Barbuda, Dominica, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands. St. Kitts and Nevis opposed sharing their government funds with Antigua and Montserrat, which were bankrupt. Governor Pine told the Colonial Office that the scheme had failed due to \\"local prejudice and self- interest\\". His only achievement was to give the Leewards a single Governor. All laws and ordinances, however, had to be approved by each island council. In 1871 the British government passed the Leeward Islands Act, by which all the islands were under one Governor and one set of laws. The Federal Colony was composed of all islands organised under Governor Pine's previous attempt. Each island was called a \\"Presidency\\" under its own Administrator or Commissioner. Like earlier groupings, this federation was unpopular but it continued until 1956, when it was redefined as the Territory of the Leeward Islands. In 1958 the Federation of the West Indies was organised, of which the Leeward Islands became a part. =Windward Islands= In 1833 the Windward Islands became a formal union called the Windward Islands Colony. In 1838, Trinidad (acquired in 1802) and St. Lucia (acquired in 1814) were brought into the Windward Islands Colony, but were not given their own assemblies (having previously been Crown Colonies). In 1840 Trinidad left the Colony. Barbados wished to retain its separate identity and ancient institutions, and the other colonies did not want to associate with it. The individual islands resisted British attempts at closer union. Barbados in particular fought to retain its own Assembly and left the union in 1884. Power for the union was then transferred to Grenada as overseer of the bloc. From 1885 to 1958, the Windward Islands Colony included Grenada and the Grenadines, St. Vincent and St. Lucia during the entire period. Tobago left in 1889, forming a union with Trinidad. Dominica joined the Windward Islands Colony in 1940, after having been transferred from the Leewards, and remained in the Colony until 1958. After 1885 the Windward Islands Colony was under one Governor-General in Grenada, and each island had its own Lieutenant-Governor and its own assembly (as before). Attempts to create a Federal Colony, as in the Leewards, were always resisted. The Windward Islands Colony broke up in 1958 when each island chose to join the new Federation of the West Indies as a separate unit. =Jamaica and dependencies= Rose Hall plantation, Jamaica c. 1820 Harbour Street, Kingston, Jamaica, c. 1820 The Cayman Islands and Turks and Caicos Islands were grouped under Jamaica out of convenience and sometimes for historical and/or geographical reasons. British Honduras (later Belize) was surrounded by hostile Spanish colonies and needed the protection afforded by the Jamaican Army and Navy. In addition, British Honduras had been founded by loggers. It increased in population partly by the settlement of Englishmen migrating from Jamaica in the late 17th and early 18th centuries (settlers also immigrated directly from England; others were born in the colony.) From 1742, British Honduras was a dependency directly under the Governor of Jamaica. In 1749 the Governors of Jamaica appointed Administrators for British Honduras. In 1862 British Honduras became a Crown Colony; it was placed under the Governor of Jamaica with its own Lieutenant-Governor. In 1884 it finally broke all administrative ties with Jamaica and wanted self governance, as did Cayman Islands and the Turks and Caicos Islands. =West Indies Federation= The West Indies Federation was a short-lived federation that existed from 3 January 1958 to 31 May 1962. It consisted of several Caribbean colonies of the United Kingdom. The Federation's purpose was to create a political unit that would become independent from Britain as a single state, similar to the Federation of Australia or Canadian Confederation. However, the Federation collapsed due to internal political conflicts over how it would be governed before that could develop. = West Indies Associated States = In 1967, following the termination of the West Indies Federation, a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association form of government along with the United Kingdom called the West Indies Associated States. The arrangement was created through the British House of Commons passing the Associated Statehood Act (1967). As part of the arrangement more sovereignty was granted to the bloc of West Indies countries with the United Kingdom maintaining responsibility for defence and external affairs only.Antigua Termination of Association Order, UK Parliamentary Hansard debate of the bill Sport =Cricket= Cricket has traditionally been the main sport in the British West Indies (though others sports such as football have challenged its dominance since the 1990s). Most of the countries and territories listed above field a combined cricket team called the West Indies, which is one of the ten elite international teams that play at Test match level. The West Indies hosted the 2007 Cricket World Cup of ODI Cricket and the 2010 ICC World Twenty20.

From the late 12th century onwards, Turko-Mongol Muslim empires began to establish themselves throughout the subcontinent including the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, who adopted local culture and intermarried with natives. Various other Muslim kingdoms, which ruled most of South Asia during the mid-14th to late 18th centuries, including the Bahmani Sultanate, Deccan Sultanates, and Gujarat Sultanate were native in origin. Sharia was used as the primary basis for the legal system in the Delhi Sultanate, most notably during the rule of Firuz Shah Tughlaq and Alauddin Khilji, who repelled the Mongol invasions of India. While rulers such as Akbar adopted a secular legal system and enforced religious neutrality. Muslim rule in India saw a major shift in the cultural, linguistic, and religious makeup of the subcontinent. Persian and Arabic vocabulary began to enter local languages, giving way to modern Punjabi, Bengali, and Gujarati, while creating new languages including Urdu and Deccani, used as official languages under Muslim dynasties, and Hindi. This period also saw the birth of Hindustani music, Qawwali and the further development of dance forms such as Kathak. Religions such as Sikhism and Din-e-Ilahi were born out of a fusion of Hindu and Muslim religious traditions as well. The height of Islamic rule was marked during the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb, during which the Fatawa Alamgiri was compiled, which briefly served as the legal system of Mughal India. Additional Islamic policies were re-introduced in South India by Mysore's de-facto King Tipu Sultan. The eventual end of the period of Muslim rule of modern India is mainly marked with the beginning of British rule, although its aspects persisted in Hyderabad State, Junagadh State, Jammu and Kashmit State and other minor princely states until the mid of the 20th century. Today's modern Bangladesh, Maldives and Pakistan remain the only Muslim majority nations in the Indian subcontinent. Early Muslim dominion Local Muslim revert kings existed in places such as Gujarat as early as in the 7th century. Remarkable Islamic rules in India prior to the advent of the Mamluk dynasty (Delhi) include those of Umayyad Caliphate's Muhammad bin Qasim, Ghaznavids and Ghurids. Delhi Sultanate Delhi Sultanate during Tughlaq era During the last quarter of the 12th century, Muhammad of Ghor invaded the Indo-Gangetic plain, conquering in succession Ghazni, Multan, Sindh, Lahore, and Delhi. Qutb-ud-din Aybak, one of his generals proclaimed himself Sultan of Delhi. In Bengal and Bihar, the reign of general Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji was established, where the missionaries of the Islamic faith accomplished their biggest success in terms of dawah and number of converts to Islam. In the 13th century, Shamsuddƒ´n Iltutmish (1211‚Äì1236), established a Turkic kingdom in Delhi, which enabled future sultans to push in every direction; within the next 100 years, the Delhi Sultanate extended its way east to Bengal and south to the Deccan, while the sultanate itself experienced repeated threats from the northwest and internal revolts from displeased, independent-minded nobles. The sultanate was in constant flux as five dynasties, all of either Turkic or Afghan origin, rose and fell: the Slave dynasty (1206‚Äì90), Khalji dynasty (1290‚Äì1320), Tughlaq dynasty (1320‚Äì1413), Sayyid dynasty (1414‚Äì51), and Lodi dynasty (1451‚Äì1526). The Khalji dynasty, under 'AlƒÅ'uddƒ´n (1296‚Äì1316), succeeded in bringing the northern half of South India under its control for a time before the conquered areas broke away within the next decade. Power in Delhi was often gained by violence‚Äînineteen of the thirty-five sultans were assassinated‚Äîand was legitimized by reward for tribal loyalty. Factional rivalries and court intrigues were as numerous as they were treacherous; territories controlled by the sultan expanded and shrank depending on his personality and fortunes. Both the Qur'an and sharia (Islamic law) provided the basis for enforcing Islamic administration over the independent Hindu rulers, but the sultanate made only fitful progress in the beginning when many campaigns were undertaken for plunder and temporary reduction of fortresses. The effective rule of a sultan depended largely on his ability to control the strategic places that dominated the military highways and trade routes, extract the annual land tax, and maintain personal authority over military and provincial governors. Sultan 'Ala ud-Din made an attempt to reassess, systematize, and unify land revenues and urban taxes and to institute a highly centralized system of administration over his realm, but his efforts were abortive. Although agriculture in North India improved as a result of new canal construction and irrigation methods, including what came to be known as the Persian wheel, prolonged political instability and parasitic methods of tax collection brutalized the peasantry. Yet trade and a market economy, encouraged by the free-spending habits of the aristocracy, acquired new impetus both in and overseas. Experts in metalwork, stonework, and textile manufacture responded to the new patronage with enthusiasm. In this period Persian language and many Persian cultural aspects became dominant in the centers of power in Meric'a, as the rulers of the Delhi Sultanate (who, though being Turkish or Afghan, had been thoroughly Persianized since the era of the Ghaznavids) patronized aspects of the foreign culture and language from their seat of power in India. Bengal Sultanate Ruins of the Adina Mosque, once the largest mosque in the Indian subcontinent, in Pandua, the first capital of the Bengal Sultanate. In 1339, the Bengal region became independent from the Delhi Sultanate and consisted of numerous Islamic city-states. The Bengal Sultanate was formed in 1352 after Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah, ruler of Satgaon, defeated Alauddin Ali Shah of Lakhnauti and Ikhtiyaruddin Ghazi Shah of Sonargaon; ultimately unifying Bengal into one single independent Sultanate. At its greatest extent, the Bengal Sultanate's realm and protectorates stretched from Jaunpur in the west, Tripura and Arakan in the east, Kamrup and Kamata in the north and Puri in the south. Although a Sunni Muslim monarchy ruled by Turco-Persians, Bengali Muslims, Habshis, and Arabs, they still employed many non-Muslims in the administration and promoted a form of religious pluralism.\\"He founded the Bengali Husayn Shahi dynasty, which ruled from 1493 to 1538, and was known to be tolerant to Hindus, employing many on them in his service and promoting a form of religious pluralism\\" It was known as one of the major trading nations of the medieval world, attracting immigrants and traders from different parts of the world. Bengali ships and merchants traded across the region, including in Malacca, China, Africa, Europe and the Maldives through maritime links and overland trade routes. Contemporary European and Chinese visitors described Bengal as the \\"richest country to trade with\\" due to the abundance of goods in Bengal. In 1500, the royal capital of Gaur was the fifth-most populous city in the world with 200,000 residents. Persian was used as a diplomatic and commercial language. Arabic was the liturgical language of the clergy, and the Bengali language became a court language. Bengali was patronised by the Sultans and saved it from being corrupted by the Brahmins wishing to Sanskritise it. Sultan Ghiyathuddin Azam Shah sponsored the construction of madrasas in Makkah and Madinah. The schools became known as the Ghiyasia Banjalia Madrasas. Taqi al-Din al-Fasi, a contemporary Arab scholar, was a teacher at the madrasa in Makkah. The madrasa in Madinah was built at a place called Husn al-Atiq near the Prophet's Mosque. Several other Bengali Sultans also sponsored madrasas in the Hejaz. The Karrani dynasty was the last ruling dynasty of the sultanate. The Mughals became determined to bring an end to Bengali imperialism. Mughal rule formally began with the Battle of Rajmahal in 1576, when the last Sultan Daud Khan Karrani was defeated by the forces of Emperor Akbar, and the establishment of the Bengal Subah. The eastern deltaic Bhati region remained outside of Mughal control until being absorbed in the early 17th century. The delta was controlled by a confederation of aristocrats of the Sultanate, who became known as the Baro-Bhuiyans. The Mughal government eventually suppressed the remnants of the Sultanate and brought all of Bengal under full Mughal control. Southern dynasties The sultans' failure to hold securely the Deccan and South India resulted in the rise of competing for Southern dynasties: the Muslim Bahmani Sultanate (1347‚Äì1527) and the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire (1336‚Äì1565). Zafar Khan, a former provincial governor under the Tughluqs, revolted against his Turkic overlord and proclaimed himself sultan, taking the title Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah in 1347. The Bahmani Sultanate, located in the northern Deccan, lasted for almost two centuries, until it fragmented into five smaller states, known as the Deccan sultanates (Bijapur, Golconda, Ahmednagar, Berar, and Bidar) in 1527. The Bahmani Sultanate adopted the patterns established by the Delhi overlords in tax collection and administration, but its downfall was caused in large measure by the competition and hatred between Deccani (domiciled Muslim immigrants and local converts) and paradesi (foreigners or officials in temporary service). The Bahmani Sultanate initiated a process of cultural synthesis visible in Hyderabad where cultural flowering is still expressed in vigorous schools of Deccani architecture and painting. Founded in 1336, the Vijayanagara Empire (named for its capital Vijayanagara (Vijayanagar), \\"City of Victory,\\" in present-day Karnataka) expanded rapidly toward Madurai in the south and Goa in the west and exerted intermittent control over the east coast and the extreme southwest. Vijayanagara rulers closely followed Chola precedents, especially in collecting agricultural and trade revenues, in giving encouragement to commercial guilds, and in honoring temples with lavish endowments. Added revenue needed for waging war against the Bahmani sultans was raised by introducing a set of taxes on commercial enterprises, professions, and industries. Political rivalry between the Bahmani and the Vijayanagara rulers involved control over the Krishna-Tungabhadra river basin, which shifted hands depending on whose military was superior at any given time. The Vijayanagar rulers' capacity for gaining victory over their enemies was contingent on ensuring a constant supply of horses‚Äîinitially through Arab traders but later through the Portuguese‚Äîand maintaining internal roads and communication networks. Merchant guilds enjoyed a wide sphere of operation and were able to offset the power of landlords and Brahmans in court politics. Commerce and shipping eventually passed largely into the hands of foreigners, and special facilities and tax concessions were provided for them by the ruler. The city of Vijayanagara itself contained numerous temples with rich ornamentation, especially the gateways, and a cluster of shrines for the deities. Most prominent among the temples was the one dedicated to Virupaksha, a manifestation of Shiva, the patron-deity of the Vijayanagar rulers. Temples continued to be the nuclei of diverse cultural and intellectual activities, but these activities were based more on tradition than on contemporary political realities. When the rulers of the five Deccan sultanates combined their forces and attacked Vijayanagara in 1565, the empire crumbled at the Battle of Talikot. Most Muslim rulers in south India were Shia muslims. Mughal era The Taj Mahal, built by Shah Jahan. The Mughal Empire ruled most of the Indian subcontinent between 1526 and 1707. The empire was founded by the Turco-Mongol leader Babur in 1526, when he defeated Ibrahim Lodi, the last Pashtun ruler of the Delhi Sultanate at the First Battle of Panipat. The word \\"Mughal\\" is the Persian version of Mongol. Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, Aurangzeb are known as the six great Mughal Emperors. Hyderabad Nizam Nizam, a shortened version of Nizam-ul-Mulk, meaning Administrator of the Realm, was the title of the native sovereigns of Hyderabad state, India, since 1719, belonging to the Asaf Jah dynasty. The dynasty was founded by Mir Qamar-ud-Din Siddiqi, a viceroy of the Deccan under the Mughal emperors from 1713 to 1721 who intermittently ruled under the title Asaf Jah in 1924. After Aurangzeb's death in 1707, the Mughal Empire crumbled, and the viceroy in Hyderabad, the young Asaf Jah, declared himself independent. Other Islamic rulers Nawab of Awadh ruled parts of current day Uttar Pradesh. Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan briefly held power in Mysore kingdom. Many princely states other than Hyderabad had Muslim rulers. See also * The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians.

The period begins after the decline of the Maurya Empire and the corresponding rise of the Satavahana dynasty, starting with Simuka, from 230 BCE. The \\"Middle\\" period lasted for about 1,500 years and ended in the 13th century, with the rise of the Delhi Sultanate, founded in 1206, and the end of the Later Cholas (Rajendra Chola III, who died in 1279 CE). This period encompasses two eras: Classical India, from the Maurya Empire up until the end of the Gupta Empire in the 6th century CE, and early Medieval India from the 6th century onwards. It also encompasses the era of classical Hinduism, which is dated from 200 BCE to 1100 CE. From 1 CE until 1000 CE, India's economy is estimated to have been the largest in the world, having between one-third and one-quarter of the world's wealth. It is followed by the late Medieval period in the 13th century. The Northwest During the 2nd century BCE, the Maurya Empire became a collage of regional powers with overlapping boundaries. The whole northwest attracted a series of invaders between 200 BCE and 300 CE. The Puranas speak of many of these tribes as foreigners and impure barbarians (Mlecchas). First the Satavahana dynasty and then the Gupta Empire, both successor states to the Maurya Empire, attempt to contain the expansions of the successive before eventually crumbling internally due to the pressure exerted by these wars. The invading tribes were influenced by Buddhism which continued to flourish under the patronage of both invaders and the Satavahanas and Guptas and provides a cultural bridge between the two cultures. Over time, the invaders became \\"Indianized\\" as they influenced society and philosophy across the Gangetic plains and were conversely influenced by it. This period is marked by both intellectual and artistic achievements inspired by cultural diffusion and syncretism as the new kingdoms straddle the Silk Road. =The Indo-Scythian Sakas= The Indo- Scythians are a branch of the Sakas who migrated from southern Siberia into Bactria, Sogdia, Arachosia, Gandhara, Kashmir, Punjab, and into parts of Western and Central India, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Rajasthan, from the middle of the 2nd century BCE to the 4th century CE. The first Saka king in India was Maues or Moga who established Saka power in Gandhara and gradually extended supremacy over north-western India. Indo-Scythian rule in India ended with the last of the Western Satraps, Rudrasimha III, in 395 CE. The invasion of India by Scythian tribes from Central Asia, often referred to as the \\"Indo-Scythian invasion\\", played a significant part in the history of India as well as nearby countries. In fact, the Indo-Scythian war is just one chapter in the events triggered by the nomadic flight of Central Asians from conflict with Chinese tribes which had lasting effects on Bactria, Kabul, Parthia and India as well as far off Rome in the west. The Scythian groups that invaded India and set up various kingdoms, included, besides the Sakas,Cunningham, (1888) p. 33. other allied tribes, such as the Medes,Cunningham (1888), p. 33. Scythians,Barstow (1928), reprint 1985, pp. 105-135, 63, 155, 152, 145. Massagetae, Getae,Latif (1984), p. 56. Parama Kamboja Kingdom, Avars, Bahlikas, Rishikas and Parada Kingdom. =The Indo-Greeks= Silver coin of the founder of the Indo-Greek Kingdom, Demetrius (r. c. 205‚Äì171 BC). The Indo-Greek Kingdom covered various parts of the Northwestern South Asia during the last two centuries BCE, and was ruled by more than 30 Hellenistic kings, often in conflict with each other. The kingdom was founded when Demetrius I of Bactria invaded the Hindu Kush early in the 2nd century BCE. The Greeks in India were eventually divided from the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom centered in Bactria (now the border between Afghanistan and Uzbekistan). The expression \\"Indo-Greek Kingdom\\" loosely describes a number of various dynastic polities. There were numerous cities, such as TaxilaMortimer Wheeler Flames over Persepolis (London, 1968). Pp. 112 ff. It is unclear whether the Hellenistic street plan found by John Marshall's excavations dates from the Indo-Greeks or from the Kushans, who would have encountered it in Bactria; Tarn (1951, pp. 137, 179) ascribes the initial move of Taxila to the hill of Sirkap to Demetrius I, but sees this as \\"not a Greek city but an Indian one\\"; not a polis or with a Hippodamian plan. Pakistan's Punjab, or Pushkalavati and Sagala.\\"Menander had his capital in Sagala\\" Bopearachchi, \\"Monnaies\\", p.83. McEvilley supports Tarn on both points, citing Woodcock: \\"Menander was a Bactrian Greek king of the Euthydemid dynasty. His capital (was) at Sagala (Sialkot) in the Punjab, \\"in the country of the Yonakas (Greeks)\\".\\" McEvilley, p.377. However, \\"Even if Sagala proves to be Sialkot, it does not seem to be Menander's capital for the Milindapanha states that Menander came down to Sagala to meet Nagasena, just as the Ganges flows to the sea.\\" These cities would house a number of dynasties in their times, and based on Ptolemy's Geography and the nomenclature of later kings, a certain Theophila in the south was also probably a satrapal or royal seat at some point. Euthydemus I was, according to Polybius11.34 a Magnesian Greek. His son, Demetrius, founder of the Indo-Greek kingdom, was therefore of Greek descent from his father at minimum. A marriage treaty was arranged for Demetrius with a daughter of Antiochus III the Great, who had partial Persian descent.Polybius 11.34 The ethnicity of later Indo-Greek rulers is less clear.\\"Notes on Hellenism in Bactria and India\\". W. W. Tarn. Journal of Hellenic Studies, Vol. 22 (1902), pages 268‚Äì293 For example, Artemidoros Aniketos (80 BCE) may have been of Indo-Scythian descent. Intermarriage also occurred, as exemplified by Alexander the Great, who married Roxana of Bactria, or Seleucus I Nicator, who married Apama of Sogdia. During the two centuries of their rule, the Indo-Greek kings combined the Greek and Indian languages and symbols, as seen on their coins, and blended Greek, Hindu and Buddhist religious practices, as seen in the archaeological remains of their cities and in the indications of their support of Buddhism, pointing to a rich fusion of Indian and Hellenistic influences.\\"A vast hoard of coins, with a mixture of Greek profiles and Indian symbols, along with interesting sculptures and some monumental remains from Taxila, Sirkap and Sirsukh, point to a rich fusion of Indian and Hellenistic influences\\", India, the Ancient Past, Burjor Avari, p.130 The diffusion of Indo-Greek culture had consequences which are still felt today, particularly through the influence of Greco- Buddhist art. The Indo-Greeks ultimately disappeared as a political entity around 10 CE following the invasions of the Indo-Scythians, although pockets of Greek populations probably remained for several centuries longer under the subsequent rule of the Indo-Parthians and Kushan Empire.\\"When the Greeks of Bactria and India lost their kingdom they were not all killed, nor did they return to Greece. They merged with the people of the area and worked for the new masters; contributing considerably to the culture and civilization in southern and central Asia.\\" Narain, \\"The Indo-Greeks\\" 2003, p. 278. =The Yavanas= The Yavana or Yona people, literally \\"Ionian\\" and meaning \\"Western foreigner\\", were described as living beyond Gandhara. Yavanas, Sakas, the Pahlavas and Hunas were sometimes described as mlecchas, \\"barbarians\\". Kambojas and the inhabitants of Madra, the Kekeya Kingdom, the Indus River region and Gandhara were sometimes also classified as mlecchas. This name was used to indicate their cultural differences with the culture of the Kuru Kingdom and Panchala. =The Indo-Parthians= The Indo-Parthian Kingdom was founded by Gondophares around 20 BCE. The kingdom lasted only briefly until its conquest by the Kushan Empire in the late 1st century CE and was a loose framework where many smaller dynasts maintained their independence. =The Pahlavas= The Pahlavas are a people mentioned in ancient Indian texts like the Manusm·πõti, various Puranas, the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Brhatsamhita. In some texts the Pahlavas are synonymous with the Pallava dynasty of South India. While the Vayu Purana distinguishes between Pahlava and Pahnava, the Vamana Purana and Matsya Purana refer to both as Pallava. The Brahmanda Purana and Markendeya Purana refer to both as Pahlava or Pallava. The Bhishama Parava of the Mahabharata does not distinguish between the Pahlavas and Pallavas. The Pahlavas are said to be same as the Parasikas, a Saka group. According to P. Carnegy,See: Notes on the Races, Tribes, and Castes inhabiting the Province of Oudh, Lucknow, Oudh Government Press 1868, p 4; The Geographical Data in Early Puranas, a Critical Studies, 1972, p 135, Dr M. R. Singh; Sacred Books of the East, XXV, Intr. p cxv, Rapson, Coins of Ancient India, p 37, n.2. the Pahlava are probably those people who spoke Paluvi or Pehlvi, the Parthian language. Buhler similarly suggests Pahlava is an Indic form of Parthava meaning \\"Parthian\\".The Geographical Data in Early Puranas, a Critical Studies, 1972, p 135, M. R. Singh; Sacred Books of the East, XXV, Intr. p cxv; Rapson, Coins of Ancient India, p 37, n.2. In a 4th- century BCE, the Vartika of KƒÅtyƒÅyana mentions the Sakah-Parthavah, demonstrating an awareness of these Saka-Parthians, probably by way of commerce.Agarwala (1954), p. 444. =The Western Satraps= The Western Satraps (35-405 CE) were Saka rulers of the western and central part of India (Saurashtra and Malwa: modern Gujarat, southern Sindh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh states). Their state, or at least part of it, was called \\"Ariaca\\" according to the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. They were successors to the Indo-Scythians and were contemporaneous with the Kushan Empire, which ruled the northern part of the Indian subcontinent and were possibly their overlords, and the Satavahana dynasty of Andhra who ruled in Central India. They are called \\"Western\\" in contrast to the \\"Northern\\" Indo-Scythian satraps who ruled in the area of Mathura, such as Rajuvula, and his successors under the Kushans, the \\"Great Satrap\\" Kharapallana and the \\"Satrap\\" Vanaspara.Kharapallana and Vanaspara are known from an inscription discovered in Sarnath, and dated to the 3rd year of Kanishka, in which they were paying allegiance to the Kushanas. Source: \\"A Catalogue of the Indian Coins in the British Museum. Andhras etc...\\" Rapson, p ciii Although they called themselves \\"Satraps\\" on their coins, leading to their modern designation of \\"Western Satraps\\", Ptolemy's Geography still called them \\"Indo-Scythians\\".Ptolemy, Geographia, Chap 7 Altogether, there were 27 independent Western Satrap rulers during a period of about 350 years. =The Kushans= Kushan Empire The Kushan Empire (c. 1st‚Äì3rd centuries) originally formed in Bactria on either side of the middle course of the Amu Darya in what is now northern Afghanistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan; during the 1st century CE, they expanded their territory to include the Punjab and much of the Ganges basin, conquering a number of kingdoms across the northern part of the Indian subcontinent in the process.Hill (2009), pp. 29, 31.Hill (2004) The Kushans conquered the central section of the main Silk Road and, therefore, had control of the overland trade between India, and China to the east, and the Roman Empire and Persia to the west. Emperor Kanishka was a great patron of Buddhism; however, as Kushans expanded southward toward the Indian subcontinent the deities of their later coinage came to reflect its new Hindu majority. =The Indo-Sasanians= The rise of new Persian power, the Sasanian Empire, saw them exert their influence into the Indus region and conquer lands from the Kushan Empire, setting up the Indo-Sasanians around 240 CE. They were to maintain their influence in the region until they were overthrown by the Rashidun Caliphate. Afterwards, they were displaced in 410 CE by the invasions of the Hephthalite Empire. =The Hephthalite Hunas= Billon drachma of the Huna King Napki Malka (Afghanistan or Gandhara, c. 475‚Äì576). The Hephthalite Empire was another Central Asian nomadic group to invade. They are also linked to the Yuezhi who had founded the Kushan Empire. From their capital in Bamyan (present-day Afghanistan) they extended their rule across the Indus and North India, thereby causing the collapse of the Gupta Empire. They were eventually defeated by the Sasanian Empire allied with Turkic peoples. =The Ror= The Ror dynasty was a power from the Indian subcontinent that ruled modern-day Sindh and northwest India from 450 BC.http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaSindh.htm The Rors ruled from Rori. =The Rais= The Rai dynasty of Sindh were patrons of Buddhism even though they also established a huge temple of Shiva in Sukkur close to their capital, Aror. =The Gandharan Kambojas= The Gandhara Satrapy became an independent kingdom based from Afghanistan and vied with the Tang dynasty, Tibetan Empire, the Islamic Caliphate and Turkic tribes for domination in the region. =The Karkotas= Extent of the Karkota Empire during the reign of Lalitaditya Muktapida (8th century), according to Kalhana's Rajatarangini. Note that Kalhana highly exaggerated the conquests of Lalitaditya. The Karkota Empire was established around 625 CE. During the eighth century they consolidated their rule over Kashmir. The most illustrious ruler of the dynasty was Lalitaditya Muktapida. According to Kalhana's Rajatarangini, he defeated the Tibetans and Yashovarman of Kanyakubja, and subsequently conquered eastern kingdoms of Magadha, Kamarupa, Gauda, and Ka·∏∑inga. Kalhana also states that he extended his influence of Malwa and Gujarat and defeated Arabs at Sindh. According to historians, Kalhana highly exaggerated the conquests of Lalitaditya. =The Kabul Shahis= The Kabul Shahi dynasties ruled portions of the Kabul valley and Gandhara from the decline of the Kushan Empire in the 3rd century to the early 9th century.Shahi Family. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. 2006. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 16 October 2006 . The kingdom was known as the Kabul Shahan or Ratbelshahan from 565 CE-670 CE, when the capitals were located in Kapisa and Kabul, and later Udabhandapura, also known as Hund,Sehrai, Fidaullah (1979). Hund: The Forgotten City of Gandhara, p. 2. Peshawar Museum Publications New Series, Peshawar. for its new capital. In ancient time, the title Shahi appears to be a quite popular royal title in Afghanistan and the northwestern areas of the Indian subcontinent. Variants were used much more priorly in the Near East,Darius used titles like \\"Kshayathiya, Kshayathiya Kshayathiyanam\\" etc. but as well later on by the Sakas, Kushans Hunas, Bactrians, by the rulers of Kapisa/Kabul and Gilgit.The Shahi Afghanistan and Punjab, 1973, pp 1, 45-46, 48, 80, Dr D.

In Persian form, the title appears as Kshathiya, Kshathiya Kshathiyanam, Shao of the Kushanas and the Ssaha of Mihirakula (Huna chief).Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1954, pp 112 ff; The Shahis of Afghanistan and Punjab, 1973, p 46, Dr D. B. Pandey; The √öakas in India and Their Impact on Indian Life and Culture, 1976, p 80, Vishwa Mitra Mohan - Indo-Scythians. The Kushanas are stated to have adopted the title Shah-in-shahi (\\"Shaonano shao\\") in imitation of Achaemenid practice.India, A History, 2001, p 203, John Keay. The Shahis are generally split up into two eras‚Äîthe Buddhist Shahis and the Hindu Shahis, with the change-over thought to have occurred sometime around 870 CE. The Gangetic Plains and Deccan Following the demise of the Mauryan Empire, the Satavahanas rose as the successor state to check and contend with the influx of the Central Asian tribes from the Northwest. The Satavahanas straddling the Deccan plateau also provided a link for transmission of Buddhism and contact between the Northern Gangetic plains and the Southern regions even as the Upanishads were gaining ground. Eventually weakened both by contention with the northwestern invaders and internal strife they broke up and gave rise to several nations around Deccan and central India regions even as the Gupta Empire arose in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and ushered in a \\"Golden Age\\" and rebirth of empire as decentralized local administrative model and the spread of Indian culture until collapse under the Huna invasions. After the fall of Gupta Empire the Gangetic region broke up into several states temporarily reunited under Harsha then giving rise to the Rajput dynasties. In the Deccan, the Chalukyas arose forming a formidable nation marking the migration of the centers of cultural and military power long held in the Indo-Gangetic Plain to the new nations forming in the southern regions of India. =The Satavahana Empire= The SƒÅtavƒÅhana dynasty began as feudatories to the Maurya Empire but declared independence with its decline. They were the first Indic rulers to issue coins struck with their rulers embossed and are known for their patronage of Buddhism, resulting in Buddhist monuments from the Ellora Caves to Amaravathi village, Guntur district. They formed a cultural bridge and played a vital role in trade and the transfer of ideas and culture to and from the Gangetic plains to the southern tip of India. The SƒÅtavƒÅhanas had to compete with the Shunga Empire and then the Kanva dynastys of Magadha to establish their rule. Later they had to contend in protecting their domain from the incursions of Sakas, Yonas and the Pahlavas. In particular their struggles with the Western Satraps weakened them and the empire split into smaller states. =The Mahameghavahana dynasty= The Mahameghavahanas (c. 250s BCE-400s CE) was an ancient ruling dynasty of Ka·∏∑inga after the decline of the Mauryan Empire. The third ruler of the dynasty, KhƒÅrabƒì·∏∑a, conquered much of India in a series of campaigns at the beginning of the common era.Agrawal, Sadananda (2000): ≈örƒ´ KhƒÅravela, Sri Digambar Jain Samaj, Cuttack, Odisha Ka·∏∑ingan military might was reinstated by KhƒÅrabƒì·∏∑a: under KhƒÅrabƒì·∏∑a's generalship, the Ka·∏∑inga state had a formidable maritime reach with trade routes linking it to the then-Simhala (Sri Lanka), Burma (Myanmar), Siam (Thailand), Vietnam, Kamboja (Cambodia), Borneo, Bali, Samudra (Sumatra) and Jabadwipa (Java). KhƒÅrabƒì·∏∑a led many successful campaigns against the states of Magadha, Anga, the Satavahanas and the South Indian regions ruled by the Pandyan dynasty (modern Andhra Pradesh) and expanded Ka·∏∑inga as far as the Ganges and the Kaveri. The Kharavelan state had a formidable maritime empire with trading routes linking it to Sri Lanka, Burma, Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Borneo, Bali, Sumatra and Java. Colonists from Ka·∏∑inga settled in Sri Lanka, Burma, as well as the Maldives and Maritime Southeast Asia. Even today Indians are referred to as Keling in Malaysia because of this.Keling_English Version . Visvacomplex.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-12. Although religiously tolerant, KhƒÅrabƒì·∏∑a patronised Jainism, and was responsible for the propagation of Jainism in the Indian subcontinent but his importance is neglected in many accounts of Indian history. The main source of information about KhƒÅrabe·∏∑a is his famous seventeen line rock-cut HƒÅtigumphƒÅ inscription in the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves near Bhubaneswar, Odisha. According to the Hathigumpha inscription, he attacked Rajagriha in Magadha, thus inducing the Indo-Greek king Demetrius I of Bactria to retreat to Mathura.Shashi Kant (2000): The Hathigumpha Inscription of Kharavela and the Bhabru Edict of Ashoka, D K Printworld Pvt.

Kusuman, Page no 153 =The Guptas= Gupta King Kumara Gupta I (414‚Äì455). The Classical Age refers to the period when much of the Indian Subcontinent was reunited under the Gupta Empire (ca. 320 CE‚Äì550 CE).India - Historical Setting - The Classical Age - Gupta and Harsha This period is called the Golden Age of India and was marked by extensive achievements in science, technology, engineering, art, dialectic, literature, logic, mathematics, astronomy, religion and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Hindu culture.The Age of the Guptas and After The decimal numeral system, including the concept of zero, was invented in India during this period. The peace and prosperity created under Guptas leadership enabled the pursuit of scientific and artistic endeavors in India.Gupta dynasty (Indian dynasty) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia The high points of this cultural creativity is seen in Gupta architecture, sculpture and painting.Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia The Gupta period produced scholars such as Kalidasa, Aryabhata, Varahamihira, Vishnu Sharma, and Vatsyayana who made advances in a variety of academic fields.The Gupta Empire of India  Chandragupta I  Samudragupta Science and political administration advanced during the Gupta era. Trade ties made the region an important cultural center and set the region up as a base that would influence nearby kingdoms and regions in Burma, Sri Lanka, and both maritime and mainland Southeast Asia. The Guptas performed Vedic sacrifices to legitimize their rule, but they also patronized Buddhism, which continued to provide an alternative to Brahmanical orthodoxy. The military exploits of the first three rulers - Chandragupta I (ca. 319‚Äì335), Samudragupta (ca. 335‚Äì376), and Chandragupta II (ca. 376‚Äì415) ‚Äîbrought much of India under their leadership.Trade  The Story of India - Photo Gallery  PBS They successfully resisted the North-Western Kingdoms until the arrival of the Hunas who established themselves in Afghanistan by the first half of the 5th century, with their capital at Bamiyan. Nevertheless, much of the Deccan and southern India were largely unaffected by this state of flux in the north. =The Vakatakas= The rock-cut Buddhist viharas and chaityas of Ajanta Caves, built under the patronage of the Vakataka rulers. The Vakataka Empire was the contemporaries of the Gupta Empire and the successor state of the Satavahanas they formed the southern boundaries of the north and ruled over today's modern-day states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra during the 3rd and 5th centuries. The rock-cut Buddhist viharas and chaityas of Ajanta Caves (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), built under the patronage of the Vakataka rulers. They were eventually overrun by the Chalukyas. =The Harsha Vardhana= After the collapse of the Gupta Empire, the gangetic plains fractured into numerous small nations. Harsha of Kannauj was able to briefly bind them together under his rulership as the Empire of Harsha. Only a defeat at the hands of the Chalukyas (Pulakeshin II) prevented him from expanding his reign south of the Narmada River. This unity did not last long beyond his reign and his empire fractured soon after his death in 647 AD. =The Gurjaras= From 550 to 1018 AD, the Gurjaras played a great part in history of Northern India nearly for 500 years.The Gurjaras of Rajputana and Kannauj, Vincent A. Smith, The Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland, (Jan., 1909), pp. 53-75 Present day Rajasthan was under the rule of Gurjars for centuries with capital at Bhilmal (Bhinmal or Srimal), situated nearly 50 miles to the north west of Mount Abu. The Gurjars of Bhilmal conquered Kannuaj on the Ganges at the beginning of the 9th century and transferred their capital to Kannuaj and founded an empire which at its peak was bounded on the east by Bihar, on the west by the lost river, the Hakra, and the Arabian Sea, on the North By the Himalaya and Sutlaj, and on the South by the Jumna and Narmada. The region round Broach, which was offshoot of this kingdom, was also ruled by the Gurjaras of Nandipuri. =The Vishnukundinas= The Vishnukundina Empire was an Indian dynasty that ruled over the Deccan, Odisha and parts of South India during the 5th and 6th centuries carving land out from the Vakataka Empire. The Vishnukundin reign came to an end with the conquest of the eastern Deccan by the Chalukya, Pulakeshin II. Pulakeshin appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy to rule over the conquered lands. Eventually Vishnuvardhana declared his independence and started the Eastern Chalukya dynasty. =The Maitrakas= The Maitraka Empire ruled Gujarat in western India from the c. 475 to 767 CE. The founder of the dynasty, Senapati (general) Bhatarka, was a military governor of Saurashtra peninsula under Gupta Empire, who had established himself as the independent ruler of Gujarat approximately in the last quarter of the 5th century. The first two Maitraka rulers Bhatarka and Dharasena I used only the title of Senapati (general). The third ruler Dronasimha declared himself as the Maharaja.Roychaudhuri, H.C. (1972). Political History of Ancient India, University of Calcutta, Calcutta, pp.553-4 King Guhasena stopped using the term Paramabhattaraka Padanudhyata along his name like his predecessors, which denotes the cessation of displaying of the nominal allegiance to the Gupta overlords. He was succeeded by his son Dharasena II, who used the title of Mahadhiraja. His son, the next ruler Siladitya I, Dharmaditya was described by Hiuen Tsang as a \\"monarch of great administrative ability and of rare kindness and compassion\\". Siladitya I was succeeded by his younger brother Kharagraha I.Mahajan V.D. (1960, reprint 2007). Ancient India, S. Chand & Company, New Delhi, , pp.594-6 Virdi copperplate grant (616 CE) of Kharagraha I proves that his territories included Ujjain. =The Gurjara Pratiharas= The Gurjara Pratihara Empire (Hindi: ‡§ó‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ú‡§∞ ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§ø‡§π‡§æ‡§∞) formed an Indian dynasty that ruled much of Northern India from the 6th to the 11th centuries. At its peak of prosperity and power (c. 836‚Äì910 CE), it rivaled the Gupta Empire in the extent of its territory.Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty definition of Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty in the Free Online Encyclopedia Pointing out the importance of the Gurjara Pratihara empire in the history of India Dr. R. C. Majumdar has observed, \\"the Gurjara Pratihara Empire which continued in full glory for nearly a century, was the last great empire in Northern India before the Muslim conquest.\\" This honour is accorded to the empire of Harsha by many historians of repute but without any real justification, for the Pratihara empire was probably larger, certainly not less in extent rivalled the Gupta Empire and brought political unity and its attendant blessings upon a large part of Northern India. But its chief credit lies in its succecessful resistance to the foreign invasions from the west, from the days of Junaid. This was frankly recognised by the Arab writers themselves. Historians of India, since the days of Eliphinstone, has wondered at slow progress of Muslim invaders in India compared to their rapid advance in other parts of the world. Arguments of doubtful validity have often been put forward to explain this unique phenomenon. Now there can be little doubt that it was the power of the Gurjara Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Muslims beyond the confines of Sindh, their first conquest for nearly three hundred years. In the light of later events this might be regarded as the \\"chief contribution of the Gurjara Pratiharas to the history of India\\". =The Rajputs= The Rajput were a Hindu clan who rose to power across a region stretching from the gangaetic plains to the Afghan mountains, and refer to the various dynasties of the many kingdoms in the region in the wake of the collapse of the Sassanid Empire and Gupta Empire and marks the transition of Buddhist ruling dynasties to Hindu ruling dynasties. Katoch Dynasty The Katoch were a Hindu Rajput clan of the Chandravanshi lineage; with recent research suggests that Katoch may be one of the oldest royal dynasties in the world.Dharam Prakash Gupta, \\"Seminar on Katoch dynasty trail\\". Himachal Plus. On line. The Chauhans Statue of Prithvi Raj Chauhan at Ajmer The Chauhan dynasty flourished from the 8th to 12th centuries CE. It was one of the three main Rajput dynasties of that era, the others being Pratiharas and Paramaras. Chauhan dynasties established themselves in several places in North India and in the state of Gujarat in Western India. They were also prominent at Sirohi in the southwest of Rajputana, and at Bundi and Kota in the east. Inscriptions also associate them with Sambhar, the salt lake area in the Amber (later Jaipur) district (the Sakhambari branch remained near lake Sambhar and married into the ruling Gurjara‚ÄìPratihara, who then ruled an empire in Northern India). Chauhans adopted a political policy that saw them indulge largely in campaigns against the Chalukyas and the invading Muslim hordes. In the 11th century, they founded the city of Ajayameru (Ajmer) in the southern part of their kingdom, and in the 12th century, the Chauhans captured Dhilika (the ancient name of Delhi) from the Tomaras and annexed some of their territory along the Yamuna River. The Chauhan Kingdom became the leading state in Northern India under King Prithviraj III (1165‚Äì1192 CE), also known as Prithvi Raj Chauhan or Rai Pithora. Prithviraj III has become famous in folk tales and historical literature as the Chauhan king of Delhi who resisted and repelled the invasion by Mohammed of Ghor at the First Battle of Tarain in 1191. Armies from other Rajput kingdoms, including Mewar, assisted him. The Chauhan kingdom collapsed after Prithviraj and his armies faced defeatMedieval India: From Sultanat to the Mughals (1206-1526) - I By Satish ChandraA History of India by August Friedrich Rudolf Hoernle, Herbert Alick Stark from Mohammed of Ghor in 1192 at the Second Battle of Tarain. The Kachwaha The Kachwaha originated as tributaries of the preceding powers of the region. Some scholars point out that it was only following the downfall, in the 8th-10th century, of Kannauj (the regional seat-of-power, following the break-up of Harsha's empire), that the Kacchapaghata state emerged as a principal power in the Chambal valley of present-day Madhya Pradesh.Stella Snead - Guardian Lion The Paramaras The Paramara dynasty was an early medieval Indian dynasty who ruled over Malwa region in central India. This dynasty was founded by Upendra in c. 800 CE. The most significant ruler of this dynasty was Bhoja I who was a philosopher king and polymath. The seat of the Paramara kingdom was Dhara Nagari (the present day Dhar city in Madhya Pradesh state). Chalukyas Modhera Sun Temple built by the Chaulukyas. The Chaulukyas (also called Solankis) in vernacular literature) were Hindu. In Gujarat, Anhilwara (modern Siddhpur Patan) served as their capital. Gujarat was a major center of Indian Ocean trade, and Anhilwara was one of the largest cities in India, with population estimated at 100,000 in the year 1000. The Chaulukyas were patrons of the great seaside temple of Shiva at Somnath Patan in Kathiawar; Bhima Dev helped rebuild the temple after it was sacked by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1026. His son, Karna, conquered the Bhil king Ashapall or Ashaval, and after his victory established a city named Karnavati on the banks of the Sabarmati River, at the site of modern Ahmedabad. Tomaras of Delhi During 9th-12th century, the Tomaras of Delhi ruled parts of the present-day Delhi and Haryana. Much of the information about this dynasty comes from bardic legends of little historical value, and therefore, the reconstruction of their history is difficult. According to the bardic tradition, the dynasty's founder Anangapal Tuar (that is Anangapala I Tomara) founded Delhi in 736 CE. However, the authenticity of this claim is doubtful. The bardic legends also state that the last Tomara king (also named Anangapal) passed on the throne of Delhi to his maternal grandson Prithviraj Chauhan. This claim is also inaccurate: historical evidence shows that Prithviraj inherited Delhi from his father Someshvara. According to the Bijolia inscription of Someshvara, his brother Vigraharaja IV had captured Dhillika (Delhi) and Ashika (Hansi); he probably defeated a Tomara ruler. Gahadavala dynasty Gahadavala dynasty ruled parts of the present-day Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, during 11th and 12th centuries. Their capital was located at Varanasi in the Gangetic plains. =Khayaravala dynasty= The Khayaravala dynasty,ruled parts of the present- day Indian states of Bihar and Jharkhand, during 11th and 12th centuries. Their capital was located at Khayaragarh in Shahabad district. Pratapdhavala and Shri Pratapa were king of the dynasty according to inscription of Rohtas.Rohtasgarh Fort =The Pratihars= Pratihars ruled from Mandore, near present-day Jodhpur, they held the title of Rana before being defeated by Guhilots of Chittore. =The Palas= Buddha and Bodhisattvas, 11th century, Pala Empire Pala Empire was a Buddhist dynasty that ruled from the north- eastern region of the Indian subcontinent. The name Pala (Modern pal) means protector and was used as an ending to the names of all Pala monarchs. The Palas were followers of the Mahayana and Tantric schools of Buddhism. Gopala was the first ruler from the dynasty. He came to power in 750 CE in Gaur by a democratic election. This event is recognized as one of the first democratic elections in South Asia since the time of the MahƒÅ Janapadas. He reigned from 750-770 CE and consolidated his position by extending his control over all of Bengal. The Buddhist dynasty lasted for four centuries (750-1120 CE) and ushered in a period of stability and prosperity in Bengal. They created many temples and works of art as well as supported the Universities of Nalanda and Vikramashila. Somapura Mahavihara built by Dharmapala is the greatest Buddhist Vihara in the Indian Subcontinent. The empire reached its peak under Dharmapala and Devapala. Dharmapala extended the empire into the northern parts of the Indian Subcontinent. This triggered once again the power struggle for the control of the subcontinent. Devapala, successor of Dharmapala, expanded the empire to cover much of South Asia and beyond. His empire stretched from Assam and Utkala in the east, Kamboja (modern-day Afghanistan) in the north-west and Deccan in the south. According to Pala copperplate inscription Devapala exterminated the Utkalas, conquered the Pragjyotisha (Assam), shattered the pride of the Huna, and humbled the lords of Pratiharas, Gurjara and the Dravidas. The death of Devapala ended the period of ascendancy of the Pala Empire and several independent dynasties and kingdoms emerged during this time. However, Mahipala I rejuvenated the reign of the Palas. He recovered control over all of Bengal and expanded the empire. He survived the invasions of Rajendra Chola and the Chalukyas. After Mahipala I the Pala dynasty again saw its decline until Ramapala, the last great ruler of the dynasty, managed to retrieve the position of the dynasty to some extent. He crushed the Varendra rebellion and extended his empire farther to Kamarupa, Odisha and Northern India. The Pala Empire can be considered as the golden era of Bengal. Palas were responsible for the introduction of Mahayana Buddhism in Tibet, Bhutan and Myanmar. The Palas had extensive trade as well as influence in south-east Asia. This can be seen in the sculptures and architectural style of the Sailendra Empire (present-day Malaya, Java, Sumatra). =The Candras= The Candra Dynasty who ruled over eastern Bengal and were contemporaries of the Palas. =The Eastern Gangas= Konark Sun Temple at Konark, Odisha, built by King Narasimhadeva I (1236‚Äì1264 AD) also a World Heritage site. The Eastern Ganga dynasty rulers reigned over Ka·∏∑inga which consisted of the parts of the modern-day Indian states of Odisha, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh from the 11th century to the early 15th century.Ganga Dynasty www.britannica.com. Their capital was known by the name Kalinganagar, which is the modern Srimukhalingam in Srikakulam District of Andhra Pradesh bordering Odisha. Today they are most remembered as the builders of the Konark Sun Temple a World Heritage site at Konark, Odisha. It was built by King Narasimhadeva I (1238‚Äì1264 CE). During their reign (1078-1434 CE) a new style of temple architecture came into being, commonly called as Indo-Aryan architecture. This dynasty was founded by King Anantavarma Chodaganga Deva (1078‚Äì1147 CE). He was a religious person and a patron of art and literature. He is credited for having built the famous Jagannath Temple of Puri in Odisha. King Anantavarman Chodagangadeva was succeeded by a long line of illustrious rulers such as Narasimhadeva I (1238‚Äì1264 CE). The rulers of Eastern Ganga dynasty not only defended their kingdom from the constant attacks of the Muslim rulers from both northern and southern India but were perhaps one of the few empires to have successfully invaded and defeated their Muslim adversaries. The Eastern Ganga King Narasimha Deva I invaded the Muslim kingdom of Bengal and handed a heavy defeat to the Sultan. This ensured that Sultanate never encroached upon the domains of the Ganga Emperors for nearly a century. His military exploits still survive today as folklore in Odisha. This kingdom prospered through trade and commerce and the wealth was mostly used in the construction of temples. The rule of the dynasty came to end under the reign of King Bhanudeva IV (1414‚Äì1434 CE), in the early 15th century. =The Senas= The Palas were followed by the Sena dynasty who brought Bengal under one ruler during the 12th century. Vijay Sen the second ruler of this dynasty defeated the last Pala emperor Madanapala and established his reign. Ballal Sena introduced Kulƒ´na System in Bengal and made Nabadwip the capital. The fourth king of this dynasty Lakshman Sen expanded the empire beyond Bengal to Bihar, Assam, northern Odisha and probably to Varanasi. Lakshman was later defeated by the Muslims and fled to eastern Bengal where he ruled few more years. The Sena dynasty brought a revival of Hinduism and cultivated Sanskrit literature in India. =The Varmans= The Varman Dynasty (not to be confused with the Varman dynasty of Kamarupa) ruled over eastern Bengal and were contemporaries of the Senas. The Northeast =Kamarupa= The KƒÅmar≈´pa, also called Pragjyotisha, was one of the historical kingdoms of Assam alongside Davaka,Suresh Kant Sharma, Usha Sharma - 2005,\\"Discovery of North-East India: Geography, History, Culture, ... - Volume 3\\", Page 248, Davaka (Nowgong) and Kamarupa as separate and submissive friendly kingdoms. that existed from 350 to 1140 CE. Ruled by three dynasties from their capitals in present-day Guwahati, North Guwahati and Tezpur, it at its height covered the entire Brahmaputra Valley, North Bengal, Bhutan and parts of Bangladesh, and at times portions of West Bengal and Bihar. The Varmans The Varman dynasty (350-650 CE), the first historical rulers of Kamarupa; was established by Pushyavarman, a contemporary of Samudragupta.Arun Bhattacharjee (1993), Assam in Indian Independence, Page 143 While Pushyavarman was the contemporary of the Gupta Emperor Samudra Gupta, Bhaskaravarman was the contemporary of Harshavardhana of Kanauj.\\"Three thousand years after these mythical ancestors (Naraka, Bhagadatta and Vajradatta) there occurred Pushyavarman as the first historical king, after whom we have an uninterrupted line of rulers up to Bhaskarvarman.\\" This dynasty became vassals of the Gupta Empire, but as the power of the Guptas waned, Mahendravarman (470-494 CE) performed two horse sacrifices and threw off the imperial yoke.\\"According to him (D C Sircar) Narayanavarma, the father of Bhutivarman, was the first Kamarupa king to perform horse-sacrifices and thus for the first time since the days of Pusyavarman freedom from the Gupta political supremacy was declared by Narayanavarma. But a careful study or even a casual perusal of the seal attached to the Dubi C.P. and of the nalanda seals should show that it is Sri Mahendra, the father of Narayanavarma himself, who is described as the performer of two horse-sacrifices.\\" The first of the three Kamarupa dynasties, the Varmans were followed by the Mlechchha and then the Pala dynasties. The Mlechchhas The Mlechchha dynasty succeeded the Varman dynasty and ruled to the end of the 10th century. They ruled from their capital in the vicinity of the Harrupeshwara (Tezpur). The rulers were aboriginals, with lineage from Narakasura. According to historical records, there were ten rulers in this dynasty. The Mlechchha dynasty in Kamarupa was followed by the Pala kings. Kamarupa-Palas, Madan Kamdev The Palas The Pala dynasty of Kamarupa succeeded the Mlechchha dynasty, ruled from its capital at Durjaya (North Gauhati). Dynasty reigned till the end of the 12th century. Brahma Pala (900-920 CE), was founder Pala dynasty (900‚Äì1100 CE) of Kamarupa. Dynasty ruled from its capital Durjaya, modern-day North Guwahati. The greatest of the Pala kings, Dharma Pala had his capital at Kamarupa Nagara, now identified with North Guwahati. Ratna Pala was another notable sovereign of this line. Records of his land-grants have been found at Bargaon and Sualkuchi, while a similar relic of Indra Pala, has been discovered at Guwahati. Pala dynasty come to end with Jaya Pala (1075-1100 CE). =The Twipra= The Twipra Kingdom ruled ancient Tripura. Kingdom was established around the confluence of the Brahmaputra river with the Meghna and Surma rivers in today's Central Bangladesh area. The capital was called Khorongma and was along the Meghna river in the Sylhet Division of present-day Bangladesh. The Deccan plateau and South In the first half of the millennium the South saw various small kingdoms rise and fall mostly independent to the turmoil in the Gangetic plains and the spread of the Buddhism and Jainism to the southern tip of India. During the second half of the millennium after the fall of the Gupta Empire, a gradual shift of the balance of both military and cultural power occurs from the northern states to the rise of large southern states. From the mid-seventh to the mid-13th centuries, regionalism was the dominant theme of political and dynastic history of the Indian subcontinent. Three features commonly characterize the sociopolitical realities of this period. * First, the spread of Brahmanical religions was a two-way process of Sanskritization of local cults and localization of Brahmanical social order. * Second was the ascendancy of the Brahman priestly and landowning groups that later dominated regional institutions and political developments. * Third, because of the seesawing of numerous dynasties that had a remarkable ability to survive perennial military attacks, regional kingdoms faced frequent defeats but seldom total annihilation. Peninsular India was involved in an 8th-century tripartite power struggle among the Chalukyas (556‚Äì757 CE), the Pallavas (300‚Äì888 CE) of Kanchipuram, and the Pandyas. The Chalukya rulers were overthrown by their subordinates, the Rashtrakutas (753-973 CE). Although both the Pallava and Pandya kingdoms were enemies, the real struggle for political domination was between the Pallava and Chalukya realms. The emergence of the Rashtrakutas heralded a new era in the history of South India. The idiom of a Pan-Indian empire had moved to south. South Indian kingdoms had hitherto ruled areas only up to and south of the Narmada River. It was the Rashtrakutas who first forged north to the Gangetic plains and successfully contested their might against the Palas of Bengal and the Rajput Prathiharas of Gujarat. Despite interregional conflicts, local autonomy was preserved to a far greater degree in the south where it had prevailed for centuries. The absence of a highly centralized government was associated with a corresponding local autonomy in the administration of villages and districts. Extensive and well-documented overland and maritime trade flourished with the Arabs on the west coast and with Southeast Asia. Trade facilitated cultural diffusion in Southeast Asia, where local elites selectively but willingly adopted Indian art, architecture, literature, and social customs. The interdynastic rivalry and seasonal raids into each other's territory notwithstanding, the rulers in the Deccan and South India patronized all three religions - Buddhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. The religions vied with each other for royal favor, expressed in land grants but more importantly in the creation of monumental temples, which remain architectural wonders. The cave temples of Elephanta Island (near Mumbai or Bombay, as it was known formerly), Ajanta, and Ellora (in Maharashtra), and structural temples of Pattadakal, Aihole, Badami in Karnataka and Mahaballipuram and Kanchipuram in Tamil Nadu are enduring legacies of otherwise warring regional rulers. By the mid-7th century, Buddhism and Jainism began to decline as sectarian Hindu devotional cults of Shiva and Vishnu vigorously competed for popular support. Although Sanskrit was the language of learning and theology in South India, as it was in the north, the growth of the bhakti (devotional) movements enhanced the crystallization of vernacular literature in Dravidian languages: Kannada and Tamil; they often borrowed themes and vocabulary from Sanskrit but preserved much local cultural lore. Examples of Tamil literature include two major poems, Cilappatikaram (The Jewelled Anklet) and Manimekalai (The Jewelled Belt); the body of devotional literature of Shaivism and Vaishnavism‚ÄîHindu devotional movements; and the reworking of the Ramayana by Kamban in the 12th century. A nationwide cultural synthesis had taken place with a minimum of common characteristics in the various regions of South Asia, but the process of cultural infusion and assimilation would continue to shape and influence India's history through the centuries. =The Sangam Era Kingdoms= Farther south were three ancient Tamil states ‚Äî Chera (on the west), Chola (on the east), and Pandya (in the south). They were involved in internecine warfare seeking regional supremacy. They are mentioned in Greek and Ashokan sources as important Indian kingdoms beyond the Mauryan Empire. A corpus of ancient Tamil literature, known as Sangam (academy) works, provides much useful information about life in these kingdoms in the era 300 BCE to 200 CE. Tamil social order was based on different ecoregions rather than on the Aryan varna paradigm, although the Brahmans had a high status at a very early stage. Segments of society were characterized by matriarchy and matrilineal succession‚Äîwhich survived well into the 19th century‚Äîcross-cousin marriage, and strong regional identity. Tribal chieftains emerged as \\"kings\\" just as people moved from pastoralism toward agriculture sustained by irrigation based on rivers by small-scale water tanks (as man-made ponds are called in India) and wells, as well as maritime trade with Rome and Southeast Asia. Discoveries of Roman gold coins in various sites attest to extensive South Indian links with the outside world. As with Pataliputra in the northeast and Taxila in the northwest (in modern Pakistan), the city of Madurai, the capital of the Pandyan Kingdom (in modern Tamil Nadu), was the center of intellectual and literary activity. Poets and bards assembled there under royal patronage at successive concourses to composed anthologies of poems and expositions on Tamil grammar. By the end of the 1st century BCE, South Asia was crisscrossed by overland trade routes, which facilitated the movements of Buddhist and Jain missionaries and other travelers and opened the area to a synthesis of many cultures. =The Cheras= From early pre-historic times, Tamil Nadu was the home of the four Tamil states of the Chera, Chola, Pandya and Pallavas. The oldest extant literature, dated between 300 BCE and 600 CE mentions the exploits of the kings and the princes, and of the poets who extolled them. Cherans, who spoke Tamil language ruled from the capital of Karur in the west and traded extensively with West Asian kingdoms. An unknown dynasty called Kalabhras invaded and displaced the three Tamil kingdoms between the 4th and the 7th centuries. This is referred to as the Dark Age in Tamil history. They were eventually expelled by the Pallavas and the Pandyas. =The Kalabhras= Little of their origins or the time during which they ruled is known beyond that they ruled over the entirety of the southern tip of India during the 3rd to the 6th century, overcoming the Sangam era kingdoms. The appear to be patrons of Jainism and Buddhism as the only source of information on them is the scattered mentions in the many Buddhist and Jain literature of the time. They were contemporaries of the Kadambas and the Western Ganga Dynasty. They were overcome by the rise of the Pallavas and the resurgence of the Pandyan Kingdom. =The Kadambas= Kadamba tower at Doddagaddavalli The Kadamba Dynasty () (345‚Äì525 CE) was an ancient royal family of Karnataka that ruled from Banavasi in present-day Uttara Kannada district. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the Chalukya and the Rashtrakuta empires for over five hundred years during which time they branched into Goa and Hanagal. At the peak of their power under King Kakushtavarma, they ruled large parts of Karnataka. During the pre-Kadamba era the ruling families that controlled Karnataka, the Mauryas, Satavahanas and Chutus were not natives of the region and the nucleus of power resided outside present day Karnataka. The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use Kannada, the language of the soil at an administrative level. In the history of Karnataka, this era serves as a broad based historical starting point in the study of the development of region as an enduring geo-political entity and Kannada as an important regional language. The dynasty was founded by Mayurasharma in 345 which at times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions, an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers. One of his successors, Kakusthavarma was a powerful ruler and even the kings of imperial Gupta Dynasty of northern India cultivated marital relationships with his family, giving a fair indication of the sovereign nature of their kingdom. Tiring of the endless battles and bloodshed, one of the later descendants, King Shivakoti adopted Jainism. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the Western Ganga Dynasty of Talakad and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. =The Western Gangas= Statue of Bahubali as Gommateshvara built by the Western Ganga is one of the largest monolithic statues in the world. The Western Ganga Dynasty (350‚Äì1000 CE) () was an important ruling dynasty of ancient Karnataka in India. They are known as Western Gangas to distinguish them from the Eastern Gangas, who in later centuries ruled over modern Odisha. The general belief is the Western Gangas began their rule during a time when multiple native clans asserted their freedom due to the weakening of the Pallava dynasty of South India, a geo- political event sometimes attributed to the southern conquests of Samudragupta. The Western Ganga sovereignty lasted from about 350 to 550 CE, initially ruling from Kolar and later moving their capital to Talakad on the banks of the Kaveri in modern Mysore district. After the rise of the imperial Chalukya dynasty of Badami, the Gangas accepted Chalukya overlordship and fought for the cause of their overlords against the Pallavas of Kanchipuram. The Chalukyas were replaced by the Rashtrakutas of Manyakheta in 753 CE as the dominant power in the Deccan. After a century of struggle for autonomy, the Western Gangas finally accepted Rashtrakuta overlordship and successfully fought alongside them against their foes, the Chola dynasty of Tanjavur. In the late 10th century, north of Tungabhadra river, the Rashtrakutas were replaced by the emerging Western Chalukya Empire and the Chola Dynasty saw renewed power south of the Kaveri. The defeat of the Western Gangas by Cholas around 1000 resulted in the end of Ganga influence over the region. Though territorially a small kingdom, the Western Ganga contribution to polity, culture and literature of the modern south Karnataka region is considered important. The Western Ganga kings showed benevolent tolerance to all faiths but are most famous for their patronage towards Jainism resulting in the construction of monuments in places such as Shravanabelagola and Kambadahalli. The kings of this dynasty encouraged the fine arts due to which literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flourished. Chavundaraya's writing, Chavundaraya Purana of 978 CE, is an important work in Kannada prose. Many classics were written on subjects ranging from religious topics to elephant management. =The Badami Chalukyas= The Chalukya Empire, natives of the Aihole and Badami region in Karnataka, were at first a feudatory of the Kadambas.N. Laxminarayana Rao and S. C. Nandinath in Kamath 2001, p57Keay (2000), p168 Jayasimha and Ranaraga, ancestors of Pulakeshin I, were administrative officers in the Badami province under the Kadambas (Fleet in Kanarese Dynasties, p343), (Moraes 1931, p51)Thapar (2003), p328Quote:\\"They belonged to the Karnataka country and their mother tongue was Kannada\\" (Sen 1999, p360); Kamath (2001), p58, They encouraged the use of Kannada in addition to the Sanskrit language in their administration.Considerable number of their records are in Kannada (Kamath 2001, p67)7th century Chalukya inscriptions call Kannada the natural language (Thapar 2003, p345) In the middle of the 6th century the Chalukyas came into their own when Pulakeshin I made the hill fortress in Badami his center of power.Sen (1999), p360 During the rule of Pulakeshin II a south Indian empire sent expeditions to the north past the Tapti River and Narmada River for the first time and successfully defied Harshavardhana, the King of Northern India (Uttarapatheswara). The Aihole inscription of Pulakeshin II, written in classical Sanskrit language and old Kannada script dated 634,In this composition, the poet deems himself an equal to Sanskrit scholars of lore like Bharavi and Kalidasa (Sastri 1955, p312Kamath (2001), p59 proclaims his victories against the Kingdoms of Kadambas, Western Gangas, Alupas of South Canara, Mauryas of Puri, Kingdom of Kosala, Malwa, Lata and Gurjaras of southern Rajasthan. The inscription describes how King Harsha of Kannauj lost his Harsha (joyful disposition) on seeing a large number of his war elephants die in battle against Pulakeshin II.Keay (2000), p169Sen (1999), pp361‚Äì362Kamath (2001), pp59‚Äì60Some of these kingdoms may have submitted out of fear of Harshavardhana of Kannauj (Majumdar in Kamat 2001, p59)The rulers of Kosala were the Panduvamshis of South Kosala (Sircar in Kamath 2001, pp59) Badami Cave Temples No 3. (Vishnu) These victories earned him the title Dakshinapatha Prithviswamy (lord of the south). Pulakeshin II continued his conquests in the east where he conquered all kingdoms in his way and reached the Bay of Bengal in present-day Odisha. A Chalukya viceroyalty was set up in Gujarat and Vengi (coastal Andhra) and princes from the Badami family were dispatched to rule them. Having subdued the Pallavas of Kanchipuram, he accepted tributes from the Pandyas of Madurai, Chola dynasty and Cheras of the Kerala region. Pulakeshin II thus became the master of India, south of the Narmada River.Keay (2000), p170 Pulakeshin II is widely regarded as one of the great kings in Indian history.Kamath (2001), pp58Ramesh 1984, p76 Hiuen-Tsiang, a Chinese traveller visited the court of Pulakeshin II at this time and Persian emperor Khosrau II exchanged ambassadors.From the notes of Arab traveller Tabari (Kamath 2001, p60) However, the continuous wars with Pallavas took a turn for the worse in 642 when the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I avenged his father's defeat, conquered and plundered the capital of Pulakeshin II who may have died in battle.Sen (1999), p362 A century later, Chalukya Vikramaditya II marched victoriously into Kanchipuram, the Pallava capital and occupied it on three occasions, the third time under the leadership of his son and crown prince Kirtivarman II. He thus avenged the earlier humiliation of the Chalukyas by the Pallavas and engraved a Kannada inscription on the victory pillar at the Kailasanatha Temple.Thapar (2003), p331, p345Sastri (1955) p140Ramesh (1984), pp159‚Äì160Sen (1999), p364 He later overran the other traditional kingdoms of Tamil country, the Pandyas, Cholas and Keralas in addition to subduing a Kalabhra ruler.Ramesh (1984), p159 The Kappe Arabhatta record from this period (700) in tripadi (three line) metre is considered the earliest available record in Kannada poetics. The most enduring legacy of the Chalukya dynasty is the architecture and art that they left behind.Hardy (1995), p65‚Äì66 More than one hundred and fifty monuments attributed to them, built between 450 and 700, have survived in the Malaprabha basin in Karnataka.Over 125 temples exist in Aihole alone, The constructions are centred in a relatively small area within the Chalukyan heartland. The structural temples at Pattadakal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, the cave temples of Badami, the temples at Mahakuta and early experiments in temple building at Aihole are their most celebrated monuments. Two of the famous paintings at Ajanta cave no. 1, \\"The Temptation of the Buddha\\" and \\"The Persian Embassy\\" are also credited to them. The Badami Chalukya introduced in the western Deccan a glorious chapter alike in heroism in battle and cultural magnificence in peace (K.V. Sounderrajan in Kamath 2001, p68 Further, they influenced the architecture in far off places like Gujarat and Vengi as evidenced in the Nava Brahma temples at Alampur.Kamath (2001), p68 =The Pallavas= Shore Temple in Mamallapuram built by the Pallavas. (c. eighth century CE) The 7th century Tamil Nadu saw the rise of the Pallavas under Mahendravarman I and his son Mamalla Narasimhavarman I. The Pallavas were not a recognised political power before the 2nd century.K.A.N. Sastri, A History of South India pp 91‚Äì92 It has been widely accepted by scholars that they were originally executive officers under the Satavahana Empire.Durga Prasad, History of the Andhras up to 1565 A. D., pp 68 After the fall of the Satavahanas, they began to get control over parts of Andhra and the Tamil country. Later they had marital ties with the Vishnukundina who ruled over the Deccan. It was around 550 AD under King Simhavishnu that the Pallavas emerged into prominence. They subjugated the Cholas and reigned as far south as the Kaveri River. Pallavas ruled a large portion of South India with Kanchipuram as their capital. Dravidian architecture reached its peak during the Pallava rule. Narasimhavarman II built the Shore Temple which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Many sources describe Bodhidharma, the founder of the Zen school of Buddhism in China, as a prince of the Pallava dynasty.Kamil V. Zvelebil (1987). \\"The Sound of the One Hand\\", Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 107, No. 1, p. 125-126. =The Eastern Chalukyas= Eastern Chalukyas were a South Indian dynasty whose kingdom was located in the present day Andhra Pradesh. Their capital was Vengi and their dynasty lasted for around 500 years from the 7th century until c. 1130 CE when the Vengi kingdom merged with the Chola empire. The Vengi kingdom was continued to be ruled by Eastern Chalukyan kings under the protection of the Chola empire until 1189 CE, when the kingdom succumbed to the Hoysalas and the Yadavas. They had their capital originally at Vengi now (Pedavegi, Chinavegi and Denduluru) near Eluru of the West Godavari district end later changed to Rajamahendravaram (Rajamundry). Eastern Chalukyas were closely related to the Chalukyas of Vatapi (Badami). Throughout their history they were the cause of many wars between the more powerful Cholas and Western Chalukyas over the control of the strategic Vengi country. The five centuries of the Eastern Chalukya rule of Vengi saw not only the consolidation of this region into a unified whole, but also saw the efflorescence of Telugu culture, literature, poetry and art during the later half of their rule. It can be said to be the golden period of Andhra history. =The Pandyas= Pallavas were replaced by the Pandyas in the 8th century. Their capital Madurai was in the deep south away from the coast. They had extensive trade links with the Southeast Asian maritime empires of Srivijaya and their successors. As well as contacts, even diplomatic, reaching as far as the Roman Empire. During the 13th century of the Christian era Marco Polo mentioned it as the richest empire in existence. Temples like Meenakshi Amman Temple at Madurai and Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli are the best examples of Pandyan Temple architecture.'Advanced History of India', K.A. Nilakanta Sastri (1970)p. 181-182, Allied Publishers Pvt. Ltd., New Delhihttp://www.whatsindia.org The Pandyas excelled in both trade as well as literature and they controlled the pearl fisheries along the South Indian coast, between Sri Lanka and India, which produced some of the finest pearls in the known ancient world. =The Rashtrakutas= Rashtrakuta Empire in 800 CE, 915 CE. Kailash Temple in Ellora Caves In the middle of the 8th century the Chalukya rule was ended by their feudatory, the Rashtrakuta family rulers of Berar (in present-day Amravati district of Maharashtra). Sensing an opportunity during a weak period in the Chalukya rule, Dantidurga trounced the great Chalukyan \\"Karnatabala\\" (power of Karnata).From the Rashtrakuta inscriptions (Kamath 2001, p57, p64)The Samangadh copper plate grant (753) confirms that feudatory Dantidurga defeated the Chalukyas and humbled their great Karnatik army (referring to the army of the Badami Chalukyas) (Reu 1933, p54) Having overthrown the Chalukyas, the Rashtrakutas made Manyakheta their capital (modern Malkhed in Gulbarga district).A capital which could put to shame even the capital of gods-From Karda plates (Altekar 1934, p47)A capital city built to excel that of Indra (Sastri, 1955, p4, p132, p146) Although the origins of the early Rashtrakuta ruling families in central India and the Deccan in the 6th and 7th centuries is controversial, during the eighth through the 10th centuries they emphasised the importance of the Kannada language in conjunction with Sanskrit in their administration. Rashtrakuta inscriptions are in Kannada and Sanskrit only. They encouraged literature in both languages and thus literature flowered under their rule.Altekar (1934), pp411‚Äì413Chopra (2003), p87, part1; Literature in Kannada and Sanskrit flowered during the Rashtrakuta rule (Kamath 2001, p73, pp 88‚Äì89)Even royalty of the empire took part in poetic and literary activities (Thapar 2003, p334)Reu (1933), pp37‚Äì38 The Rashtrakutas quickly became the most powerful Deccan empire, making their initial successful forays into the doab region of Ganges River and Jamuna River during the rule of Dhruva Dharavarsha.Chopra (2003), p89, part1; His victories were a \\"digvijaya\\" gaining only fame and booty in that region (Altekar in Kamath 2001, p75) The rule of his son Govinda III signaled a new era with Rashtrakuta victories against the Pala Dynasty of Bengal and Gurjara Pratihara of north western India resulting in the capture of Kannauj. The Rashtrakutas held Kannauj intermittently during a period of a tripartite struggle for the resources of the rich Gangetic plains.Chopra (2003), p90, part1 Because of Govinda III's victories, historians have compared him to Alexander the Great and Pandava Arjuna of the Hindu epic Mahabharata.Keay (2000), p199) The Sanjan inscription states the horses of Govinda III drank the icy water of the Himalayan stream and his war elephants tasted the sacred waters of the Ganges River.Kamath 2001, p76 Amoghavarsha I, eulogised by contemporary Arab traveller Sulaiman as one among the four great emperors of the world, succeeded Govinda III to the throne and ruled during an important cultural period that produced landmark writings in Kannada and Sanskrit.Kavirajamarga in Kannada and Prashnottara Ratnamalika in Sanskrit (Reu 1933, p38)Kamath (2001), p90 The benevolent development of Jain religion was a hallmark of his rule. Because of his religious temperament, his interest in the arts and literature and his peace-loving nature,Chopra (2003), p91, part1 he has been compared to emperor Ashoka.Panchamukhi in Kamath (2001), p80 The rule of Indra III in the 10th century enhanced the Rashtrakuta position as an imperial power as they conquered and held Kannauj again.Chopra (2003), p92, part1; Altekar in Kamath 2001, p81 Krishna III followed Indra III to the throne in 939. A patron of Kannada literature and a powerful warrior, his reign marked the submission of the Paramara of Ujjain in the north and Cholas in the south.Chopra (2003), p92‚Äì93, part1 An Arabic writing Silsilatuttavarikh (851) called the Rashtrakutas one among the four principle empires of the world.Reu (1933), p39 Kitab-ul-Masalik-ul-Mumalik (912) called them the \\"greatest kings of India\\" and there were many other contemporaneous books written in their praise.Murujul Zahab by Al Masudi (944), Kitabul Akalim by Al Istakhri (951), Ashkal-ul-Bilad by Ibn Haukal (976) (Reu 1933, p41‚Äì42) The Rashtrakuta empire at its peak spread from Cape Comorin in the south to Kannauj in the north and from Banaras in the east to Broach (Bharuch) in the west.From the Sanjan inscriptions, While the Rashtrakutas built many fine monuments in the Deccan, the most extensive and sumptuous of their work is the monolithic Kailasanatha temple at Ellora, the temple being a splendid achievement.Keay (2000), p200 In Karnataka their most famous temples are the Kashivishvanatha temple and the Jain Narayana temple at Pattadakal. All of the monuments are designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. =The Western Chalukyas= In the late 10th century, the Western Chalukyas, also known as the Kalyani Chalukyas or 'Later' Chalukyas rose to power by overthrowing the Rashtrakutas under whom they had been serving as feudatories. Manyakheta was their capital early on before they moved it to Kalyani (modern Basavakalyan). Whether the kings of this empire belonged to the same family line as their namesakes, the Badami Chalukyas is still debated.Chopra (2003), p137, part1Fleet, Bhandarkar and Altekar and Gopal B.R. in (Kamath 2001, p100) Whatever the Western Chalukya origins, Kannada remained their language of administration and the Kannada and Sanskrit literature of their time was prolific.Narasimhacharya (1988), p68, p17‚Äì21Sen (1999), p. 393Sastri (1955), pp356‚Äì358; Kamath (2001), p114More inscriptions in Kannada are attributed to the Chalukya King Vikramaditya VI than to any other king prior to the 12th century, Tailapa II, a feudatory ruler from Tardavadi (modern Bijapur district), re-established the Chalukya rule by defeating the Rashtrakutas during the reign of Karka II. He timed his rebellion to coincide with the confusion caused by the invading Paramara of Central India to the Rashtrakutas capital in 973.From the 957 and 965 records (Kamath 2001, p101)Sastri 1955, p162Tailapa II was helped in this campaign by the Kadambas of Hanagal (Moraes 1931, pp 93‚Äì94) This era produced prolonged warfare with the Chola dynasty of Tamilakam for control of the resources of the Godavari River‚ÄìKrishna River doab region in Vengi. Someshvara I, a brave Chalukyan king, successfully curtailed the growth of the Chola Empire to the south of the Tungabhadra River region despite suffering some defeatsGanguli in Kamath 2001, p103Sastri (1955), p167‚Äì168 while maintaining control over his feudatories in the Konkan, Gujarat, Malwa and Ka·∏∑inga regions.Kamath (2001), p104 For approximately 100 years, beginning in the early 11th century, the Cholas occupied large areas of South Karnataka region (Gangavadi).Sastri (1955), p164, p174; The Cholas occupied Gangavadi from 1004‚Äì1114 (Kamath 2001, p118) Western Chalukya art. In 1076 CE, the ascent of the most famous king of this Chalukya family, Vikramaditya VI, changed the balance of power in favour of the Chalukyas.Chopra (2003), p139, part1 His fifty-year reign was an important period in Karnataka's history and is referred to as the \\"Chalukya Vikrama era\\".Thapar, 2003, pp 468‚Äì469 His victories over the Cholas in the late 11th and early 12th centuries put an end to the Chola influence in the Vengi region permanently. Some of the well known contemporaneous feudatory families of the Deccan under Chalukya control were the Hoysalas, the Seuna Yadavas of Devagiri, the Kakatiya dynasty and the Southern Kalachuri.Chopra (2003), p139, part 1 At their peak, the Western Chalukyas ruled a vast empire stretching from the Narmada River in the north to the Kaveri River in the south. Vikramaditya VI is considered one of the most influential kings of Indian history.Poet Bilhana in his Sanskrit work wrote \\"Rama Rajya\\" regarding his rule, poet Vijnaneshwara called him \\"A king like none other\\" (Kamath 2001, p106)Sastri (1955), p6 Important architectural works were created by these Chalukyas, especially in the Tungabhadra river valley, that served as a conceptual link between the building idioms of the early Badami Chalukyas and the later Hoysalas.Sastri (1955), pp 427‚Äì428; Quote:\\"Their creations have the pride of place in Indian art tradition\\" (Kamath 2001, p115)Quote:\\"Of the city of Kalyana, situated in the north of Karnataka nothing is left, but a fabulous revival in temple building during the 11th century in central Karnataka testifies to the wealth during Kalyan Chalukya rule\\"(Foekema (1996), p14) With the weakening of the Chalukyas in the decades following the death of Vikramaditya VI in 1126, the feudatories of the Chalukyas gained their independence. The Kalachuris of Karnataka, whose ancestors were immigrants into the southern deccan from central India, had ruled as a feudatory from Mangalavada (modern Mangalavedhe in Maharashtra).Kamath (2001), p107 Bijjala II, the most powerful ruler of this dynasty, was a commander (mahamandaleswar) during the reign of Chalukya Vikramaditya VI.From the 1142 and 1147 records, Kamath (2001), p108 Seizing an opportune moment in the waning power of the Chalukyas, Bijjala II declared independence in 1157 and annexed their capital Kalyani.Chopra (2003), p139, part1; From the Chikkalagi records (Kamath 2001, p108) His rule was cut short by his assassination in 1167 and the ensuing civil war caused by his sons fighting over the throne ended the dynasty as the last Chalukya scion regained control of Kalyani. This victory however, was short-lived as the Chalukyas were eventually driven out by the Seuna Yadavas.Chopra (2003), p140, part1; Kamath (2001) p109 =The Yadavas= The Seuna, Sevuna or Yadava dynasty (Marathi: ‡§¶‡•á‡§µ‡§ó‡§ø‡§∞‡•Ä‡§ö‡•á ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§¶‡§µ, ) (c. 850‚Äì1334 CE) was an Indian dynasty, which at its peak ruled a kingdom stretching from the Tungabhadra to the Narmada rivers, including present-day Maharashtra, north Karnataka and parts of Madhya Pradesh, from its capital at Devagiri (present- day Daulatabad in Maharashtra). The Yadavas initially ruled as feudatories of the Western Chalukyas. Around the middle of the 12th century, they declared independence and established rule that reached its peak under Singhana II. The foundations of Marathi culture was laid by the Yadavas and the peculiarities of Maharashtra's social life developed during their rule. =The Kakatiyas= The Kakatiya dynasty was a South Indian dynasty that ruled parts of what is now Telangana, India from 1083 to 1323 CE. They were one of the great Telugu kingdoms that lasted for centuries. =The Kalachuris= Sangamanatha temple at Kudalasangama, North Karnataka Kalachuri is the name used by two kingdoms who had a succession of dynasties from the 10th-12th centuries, one ruling over areas in Central India (west Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan) and were called Chedi or Haihaya (Heyheya) (northern branch) and the other southern Kalachuri who ruled over parts of Karnataka. They are disparately placed in time and space. Apart from the dynastic name and perhaps a belief in common ancestry, there is little in known sources to connect them. The earliest known Kalachuri family (550‚Äì620 CE) ruled over northern Maharashtra, Malwa and western Deccan. Their capital was Mahismati situated in the Narmada river valley. There were three prominent members; Krishnaraja, Shankaragana and Buddharaja. They distributed coins and epigraphs around this area.Students' Britannica India By Dale Hoiberg, Indu Ramchandani. Kalachuris of Kalyani or the southern Kalachuris (1130‚Äì1184 CE) at their peak ruled parts of the Deccan extending over regions of present-day North Karnataka and parts of Maharashtra. This dynasty rose to power in the Deccan between 1156 and 1181 CE. They traced their origins to Krishna who was the conqueror of Kalinjar and Dahala in Madhya Pradesh. It is said that Bijjala a viceroy of this dynasty established the authority over Karnataka. He wrested power from the Chalukya king Taila III. Bijjala was succeeded by his sons Someshwara and Sangama but after 1181 CE, the Chalukyas gradually retrieved the territory. Their rule was a short and turbulent and yet very important from the socio-religious movement point of view; a new sect called the Lingayat or Virashaiva sect was founded during these times. A unique and purely native form of Kannada literature-poetry called the Vachanas was also born during this time. The writers of Vachanas were called Vachanakaras (poets). Many other important works like Virupaksha Pandita's Chennabasavapurana, Dharani Pandita's Bijjalarayacharite and Chandrasagara Varni's Bijjalarayapurana were also written. Kalachuris of Tripuri (Chedi) ruled in central India with its base at the ancient city of Tripuri (Tewar); it originated in the 8th century, expanded significantly in the 11th century, and declined in the 12th‚Äì13th centuries. =The Hoysalas= Belur. The Hoysalas had become a powerful force even during their rule from Belur in the 11th century as a feudatory of the Chalukyas (in the south Karnataka region).Sen (1999), p498 In the early 12th century they successfully fought the Cholas in the south, convincingly defeating them in the battle of Talakad and moved their capital to nearby Halebidu.Sen (1999), p499Vishnuvardhana made many military conquests later to be further expanded by his successors into one of the most powerful empires of South India‚ÄîWilliam Coelho. He was the true maker of the Hoysala kingdom‚ÄîB.S.K. Iyengar in Kamath (2001), p124‚Äì126 Historians refer to the founders of the dynasty as natives of Malnad Karnataka, based on the numerous inscriptions calling them Maleparolganda or \\"Lord of the Male (hills) chiefs\\" (Malepas).B.L. Rice in Kamath (2001), p123Keay (2000), p251Thapar (2003), p367Kamath (2001), p123Natives of south Karnataka (Chopra, 2003, p150 Part1) With the waning of the Western Chalukya power, the Hoysalas declared their independence in the late 12th century. During this period of Hoysala control, distinctive Kannada literary metres such as Ragale (blank verse), Sangatya (meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), Shatpadi (seven line) etc. became widely accepted.Shiva Prakash in Ayyappapanicker (1997), pp164, 203; Rice E. P. (1921), p59Kamath (2001), pp132‚Äì134Sastri (1955), p359, p361 The Hoysalas expanded the Vesara architecture stemming from the Chalukyas,Sastri (1955), p427 culminating in the Hoysala architectural articulation and style as exemplified in the construction of the Chennakesava Temple at Belur and the Hoysaleswara temple at Halebidu.Sen (1999), pp500‚Äì501 Both these temples were built in commemoration of the victories of the Hoysala Vishnuvardhana against the Cholas in 1116.Foekema (1996), p14Kamath (2001), p124 Veera Ballala II, the most effective of the Hoysala rulers, defeated the aggressive Pandya when they invaded the Chola kingdom and assumed the titles \\"Establisher of the Chola Kingdom\\" (Cholarajyapratishtacharya), \\"Emperor of the south\\" (Dakshina Chakravarthi) and \\"Hoysala emperor\\" (Hoysala Chakravarthi).The most outstanding of the Hoysala kings according to Barrett and William Coelho in Kamath (2001), p126 The Hoysalas extended their foothold in areas known today as Tamil Nadu around 1225, making the city of Kannanur Kuppam near Srirangam a provincial capital. This gave them control over South Indian politics that began a period of Hoysala hegemony in the southern Deccan.B.S.K. Iyengar in Kamath (2001), p126Keay (2000), p252 In the early 13th century, with the Hoysala power remaining unchallenged, the first of the Muslim incursions into South India began. After over two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the Hoysala ruler at the time, Veera Ballala III, died in the battle of Madurai in 1343.Sen (1999), p500 This resulted in the merger of the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by Harihara I, founder of the Vijayanagara Empire, located in the Tungabhadra region in present-day Karnataka. The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with Vijayanagara as its capital.Two theories exist about the origin of Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I. One states that they were Kannadiga commanders of the Hoysala army and another that they were Telugu speakers and commanders of the earlier Kakatiya Kingdom (Kamath 2001, pp 159‚Äì160) =The Cholas= Chola Empire under Rajendra Chola c. 1030 CE By the 9th century, under Rajaraja Chola and his son Rajendra Chola, the Cholas rose as a notable power in south Asia. The Chola Empire stretched as far as Bengal. At its peak, the empire spanned almost 3,600,000 km2 (1,389,968 sq mi). Rajaraja Chola conquered all of peninsular South India and parts of the Sri Lanka. Rajendra Chola's navies went even further, occupying coasts from Burma (now Myanmar) to Vietnam, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Lakshadweep, Sumatra, Java, Malaya in South East Asia and Pegu islands. He defeated Mahipala, the king of the Bengal, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital and named it Gangaikonda Cholapuram. The Cholas excelled in building magnificent temples. Brihadeshwara Temple in Thanjavur is a classical example of the magnificent architecture of the Chola kingdom. Brihadshwara temple is an UNESCO Heritage Site under \\"Great Living Chola Temples.\\"Great Living Chola Temples. Another example is the Chidambaram Temple in the heart of the temple town of Chidambaram.

Garrison, formerly known as Janet Garrison,He is addressed by this name after his sex-change operation from \\"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\\" up until \\"Eek, A Penis!\\" is a fictional character and the secondary main antagonist in the American animated television series South Park. He is voiced by Trey Parker and first appeared on television on August 13, 1997 in South Parks pilot episode \\"Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\\". Mr. Garrison was depicted primarily as a teacher until his dismissal, and then mounted a campaign that resulted in his election as President of the United States. Garrison is particularly cynical, especially in comparison with the rest of South Park's adults, and he is one of the few characters to ever break the fourth wall on the show. For the first eight seasons of the series, the character was known as Mr. Garrison. He underwent a sex change in the season 9 premiere \\"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\\". The character was thereafter known to the other characters as Janet Garrison or Mrs. Garrison, despite being unmarried. In the season 12 episode \\"Eek, a Penis!\\", he undergoes yet another sex change operation, returning to being a man. Mr. Garrison was in part inspired by a kindergarten teacher who taught Trey Parker, and who used a puppet named Mr. Hat as a teaching resource. Mr. Garrison was also inspired by a British literature professor Parker had at the University of Colorado; Parker said the voice he uses for the character is a dead-accurate impression of him. Parker said he believes Mr. Garrison has become one of the most complex characters on South Park, particularly due to his ever-growing relationship with Mr. Hat and his sexuality and gender issues; Parker said of Mr. Garrison, \\"He's the soap opera element to the whole series. [He] has a real story going on.\\" Character history Garrison as he appeared from seasons 1‚Äì8, 12‚Äì19.President Garrison grew up in Arkansas,Established in the episode \\"The Brown Noise\\". speaks with a Southern accent, and claims to have a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Denver Community College (as seen in the episode \\"The Entity\\"). President Garrison is sexually confused. During the entirety of the show he has had heterosexual and same-sex relationships, both as a man and as a woman. Across the series he displays myriad conflicting and ambiguous sexual identities, which he clings to exclusively for long periods of time. This may have some relation to the multiple personality disorder, which Herbert manifested in earlier seasons through Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig. Garrison also revealed racist tendencies in many episodes. In the episode \\"Chef Goes Nanners\\", Mr. Hat, his puppet, was a member of the local Ku Klux Klan, which Mr. Garrison resented and insisted to Chef that he wanted nothing to do with. However, in the later episode \\"Here Comes the Neighborhood\\", he tries to get rid of the \\"richers\\" (who were all black) using Klan techniques, such as wearing their robes or burning crosses. Although throughout the episode both Mr. Garrison and the rest of the townsfolk make no reference to the \\"richers\\" being black (seemingly oblivious to the fact), in his last line of the episode that his intentions were at least in part racist (\\"at least we got rid of all those damn ni.....\\" [transition to credits]). In the season one episode \\"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig\\" he quotes: \\"Genetic engineering erases all of God's mistakes, like German people\\". In the season 1 episode \\"Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo\\" and the season 7 episode \\"It's Christmas in Canada\\", he suggests that the town get rid of all the Mexicans, but Mayor McDaniels repeatedly declines to do so. Exactly why he wishes to do this has not yet been explained. These are two examples of the many instances throughout the show's history where Mr Garrison has expressed contempt for the Mexicans, though in the episode \\"D-Yikes\\", Garrison relies on Mexicans to help him in a plan to thwart Persian Nightclub owners. Despite the fact that he seems to portray racist manners, he sometimes will inform his student Eric Cartman of when the nine-year-old is doing something intolerant or offensive (as seen in \\"The Snuke\\"). For the first three seasons, Mr. Garrison was the third-grade teacher at South Park Elementary School. He was portrayed as a closeted homosexual and was ashamed and afraid to be open about it as a result of this. He pretended to have extremely negative views on homosexuality in earlier episodes, not unlike his racism (as seen in \\"Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride\\"). Garrison constantly held a puppet known as \\"Mr. Hat\\", which he used as a sort of second, more aggressive personality, as well as for emoting his internal conflicts. It was suggested that Mr. Hat (and subsequently Mr. Twig) were manners through which Mr. Garrison could express his repressed gay feelings. Though Garrison emphatically denied he was gay and tried to completely keep it a secret, he acknowledged that Mr. Hat and Mr. Twig had homosexual fantasies. He first announced he was gay in the season four episode \\"4th Grade\\". It has been established that Garrison has had heterosexual relationships, as with Liane Cartman, with whom most of the town has had sex at some point. Possible same sex relationships include Stephen Stotch in \\"Butters' Very Own Episode\\", and he sought a tryst with Eric Cartman in \\"Cartman Joins NAMBLA\\", in which Garrison solicited sex from a minor in an online chat room, and after meeting him near the South Park docks for sex (only then discovering then that it was Cartman, his own student), he was charged with soliciting and subsequently told by the school to take time off from his job. In his sabbatical, Garrison wrote a romance novel that he intended to be purely heterosexual in nature; titled In the Valley of Penises, it contained 6,083 instances of the word \\"penis\\". Along with his other works, it sold well until he learned that it won the Gay Pulitzer Prize and was deemed to be \\"the best work of homoerotic literature since Huckleberry Finn\\". At some point after the release of his book and it winning the Gay Pulitzer Prize, Garrison had a nervous breakdown and fled South Park to become a hermit, where he eventually came to terms with his gay tendencies. At this point, he openly embraced his homosexuality, and informed everyone of this fact. He even went so far as to cheerfully proclaim himself a \\"fag\\" repeatedly to anyone he encountered. He was re-hired by South Park Elementary, but as the kindergarten teacher, as his old job was then held by Ms. Choksondik. By the end of the sixth season, in the episode \\"The Death Camp of Tolerance\\", he was promoted to the fourth grade after the death of Ms. Choksondik. This was a move on the principal's part to avoid any semblance of sexual-orientation discrimination against him. However, when Garrison found that he could sue the school for substantial compensation if he were discriminated against, he attempted to be so offensive he would be fired. To that end, he abandoned his puppet counterpart in favor of a human assistant, \\"Mr. Slave\\", his personal BDSM slave and lover. He then proceeded to perform several sexually explicit homosexual acts in front of his students, including putting the class gerbil into Mr. Slave's rectum. His plan, however, did not succeed, and he was instead praised for being \\"courageous\\". It has been implied he has scatophilic tendencies in \\"Proper Condom Use\\" when the majority of sexual acts he taught to the kindergarten class involved feces or defecation. In the same episode, Chef refers to Mr. Garrison as a \\"complete pervert.\\" His changing sexual identities are a continual source of problems. Despite having declared himself gay, Garrison continued to be ashamed of it as part of his continual emotional and psychological problems. In the season three finale, \\"World Wide Recorder Concert\\", he also was in despair over the fact that his father had not sexually assaulted him as a boy, believing that he did not love his son. Garrison's father considered having sex with his son in order to save his life, but he instead had recording artist Kenny G, whom Mr. Garrison thought was his father, sexually assault him. In \\"An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig\\" as well as \\"Jakovasaurs\\", it was implied that Mr. Garrison has practiced bestiality with Cartman's pig and a pigeon, respectively. As a teacher, Mr. Garrison is almost completely inept, regularly teaching bizarre and pointless lessons, such as showing Barnaby Jones videos to the class for eight days, asking the class \\"why Chubby Checker left The Beatles in 1972\\" or teaching the students how to tell the difference between a prostitute and a police officer. On the other hand, he will occasionally teach the children advanced subjects such as theories on evolution, Stalin and Communism. He also failed to punish Cartman for making jokes about breast cancer in \\"Breast Cancer Show Ever\\", and only punished him when he defecated on his desk. Despite his cynical nature he appears to genuinely enjoy his job, falling into a depression when he is fired or is suspended from teaching. He also carries a gun and badge with him in class at all times, despite being told the teachers do not carry guns. =Mrs. Garrison= In the ninth-season premiere, \\"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\\", Garrison, unhappy with being a gay man, decides to try living as a trans woman. Following a vaginoplasty, Mr. Garrison becomes Mrs. Garrison, despite never having been established as having been married. In the episode \\"D-Yikes!\\" it is revealed that she had adopted the first name \\"Janet\\". Despite also receiving breast implants, she continues to have male-pattern baldness and a masculine voice. She often asserts her femininity, though in a somewhat unfeminine manner, including male-bashing and open proclamations of sexuality. After the sex change, she would state \\"I'm not gay, I'm a woman!\\" The gender transition leads to the end of her relationship with Mr. Slave, who had not been consulted before the operation and declines Mrs. Garrison's sexual overtures because of her current gender expression. Mrs. Garrison also realizes that there have been no menstrual periods after the operation, leading her to believe that she is pregnant. While attempting to have an abortion, Mrs. Garrison is told that a vaginoplasty does not result in the ability to have periods, pregnancies, or abortions, because sexual reassignment surgery does not include the creation of reproductive organs. She goes to go talk with Dr. Biber and demands her genitals back, but he says that he made her scrotum into a dorsal fin for Gerald and implanted her testicles into Kyle. She finally accepts her new situation after Kyle causes her testicles to explode during a basketball game, when they were used as kneecap implants that Kyle put too much stress on. Like many veteran characters, Garrison has appeared with less frequency following \\"Mr. Garrison's Fancy New Vagina\\", but was given an important role. In the episode \\"Follow That Egg!\\", she attempts to prevent legislation granting gay citizens the right to marry after discovering that her ex-lover, Mr. Slave, is planning to marry Big Gay Al. In the episode \\"Go God Go\\", Mrs. Garrison was ordered by the school district to teach evolution to her class. Due to her personal aversion to the concept of evolution, she deliberately presents the theory in an extremely skewed light, and is subsequently replaced by another teacher, Richard Dawkins. Although Mrs. Garrison continues to inject snide and insulting remarks into Dawkins' lecture, Dawkins becomes drawn to Mrs. Garrison's masculine boldness and directness. He does not find out about Mrs. Garrison's gender history until later. They start to date and are even shown having sexual intercourse. Dawkins converts Mrs. Garrison to atheism, and they subsequently decide to eradicate all religion from the world. However, due to Mrs. Garrison's influence, there is also the belief that mere logic will not work, but one must be \\"a dick\\" about it, leading to wars about the answer to \\"The Great Question\\". During that same episode Cartman cryogenically freezes himself so he can skip the wait to purchase a Nintendo Wii in the future. When he finally wakes he discovers that he actually slept for 500 years, and that the entire world now embraces atheism. In the following episode, \\"Go God Go XII\\", Cartman calls Mrs. Garrison's home from the future. Dawkins answers the phone while he and Mrs. Garrison are in the middle of having sex, and in the course of asking to talk to Mrs. Garrison, Cartman reveals that Garrison previously lived as a man. Repulsed, Dawkins runs from Mrs. Garrison's home and ends the relationship. Mrs. Garrison then returns to her own religion. It is revealed that Mrs. Garrison was the motivation that convinced Dawkins to teach atheism to the world, and now that they had broken up, the future changed again. In the episode \\"D-Yikes\\", Mrs. Garrison starts to have lesbian relationships. After being dumped by an unnamed boyfriend, Garrison goes to the local \\"Curves\\" gym in a huff, cursing men for the entire time. It is there that she meets Allison, a lesbian who is quickly attracted to Garrison's \\"strong-woman\\" attitude. Garrison, unaware of Allison's sexual orientation or growing affection, unwittingly joins her at a lesbian bar. When Garrison discovers the truth, she is initially shocked and repulsed, but quickly becomes attracted to Allison and begins a sexual relationship with her. By the end of the episode, Garrison has had sexual relationships with at least two women (including one who attempted to take over the lesbian bar earlier in the episode) and now openly identifies as lesbian. =Second sex change= In the episode \\"Eek, a Penis!\\", Mrs. Garrison becomes tired of living as a woman and wants to start living as a man again. After seeing a news report on TV about using genetic engineering to grow human body parts on mice, she pays all of her money to the laboratory to grow a penis on a mouse. The mouse escapes when she opens its cage and throughout the episode Mrs. Garrison looks around various places. But the penis eventually comes to her and Mrs. Garrison completes the procedure. Upon returning to the school, he then proclaims that the key difference to anyone being male or female is whether they can get pregnant or not. He even claims that whoever cannot make babies is a male, including infertile women. When a man tells Garrison about his wife's ovarian cancer, Garrison dismissively tells him \\"your wife's a dude, faggot\\" and that he should get tested for AIDS, indicating a return to his previous homophobic behavior. In the following episode, \\"Over Logging\\", Garrison can be seen smoking a pipe and parading around in a red smoking jacket, √† la Hugh Hefner, and this could indicate an attitude of \\"straightness\\". Also, in the episode \\"About Last Night...\\", he is shown to be a John McCain supporter, playing on the tendency of LGBT Americans to be more politically progressive than politically conservative. He also does not appear with the South Park gay people in \\"The F Word\\". In \\"200\\", he at first assists Stan, Kyle and Cartman in angering Tom Cruise, but also later is consulted by Cartman regarding the events of \\"Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut\\", after Mitch Connor tells Cartman that the allegations Ms. Cartman was intersex and Cartman's father are a lie ‚Äì while Garrison tries to steer Cartman away, Cartman convinces him to bring out Mr. Hat, and Mr. Hat confesses the declaration of Ms. Cartman being his father (and intersex) was fake and that Eric Cartman's real father was in the room. The episode ends with an abrupt cliffhanger while Garrison is about to reveal the identity of Cartman's father. After his return to the male gender, Mr. Garrison's behavior was shown to be less eccentric than before, with significantly fewer acts of deviant sexual behavior, outrageous outbursts, racism, or psychotic episodes. =Presidential campaign and presidency= In the Season 19 episode \\"Where My Country Gone?\\" however, following Principal Victoria being dismissed by the school, Garrison becomes frustrated with the recent immigration of Canadians to the town and begins to verbally bash them and declare they should leave their country, and is fired from his teaching job. He begins a political campaign to get rid of all the Canadians by \\"fucking them all to death,\\" and by building a wall, in a parody of the Donald Trump presidential campaign. After discovering Canada has already built such a wall, Garrison travels to Canada and rapes the Canadian president (a caricature of Donald Trump) to death. Feeling he has proven that his policies work, he decides to go to Washington, D.C. to run for president, with Caitlyn Jenner as his running mate, and is absent from subsequent episodes. The episode \\"Sponsored Content\\" features Garrison and Jenner being approached by Principal Victoria and being convinced by her to return to South Park for the remainder of the season. Trey Parker and Matt Stone had expected the Donald Trump presidential campaign to end before the eventual election. They worried that a direct portrayal of Trump would be \\"dated\\" if the campaign ended quickly, and felt it would be more appropriate to use one of their characters in his role, having already decided Garrison would come into conflict with the new principal. During Season 20, Garrison has received the nomination of the Republican Party and continues his campaign, still representing Donald Trump. Garrison realizes that he will be incapable of actually performing his duties as the president if he were to be elected, and tries repeatedly to sabotage his own campaign, even outright telling his audience to vote for Hillary Clinton instead of him. While his attempts are initially unsuccessful, he eventually manages to tank his poll numbers by making some inflammatory comments about women, a reference to a controversial audio recording of Trump leaking. As he attempts to tell his supporters that the election is rigged against him (also a reference to statements made by Trump), they realize that he had never intended to actually make it as far as he did and chase after him. Seeking refuge in a support group run by Randy Marsh, Randy tells Garrison that the reason people want him to be president is because J. J. Abrams has brainwashed people into liking his new Star Wars film using the Member Berries, linking the nostalgic themes of the Garrison campaign to the film's rehash of older material. After failing to destroy the Member Berries, Garrison makes a speech urging Americans to vote for Hillary Clinton in protest of the new Star Wars film. Despite Trey Parker and Matt Stone's expectations while producing the season Garrison is elected president anyway and brainwashed by Caitlyn Jenner, who has become brainwashed by the Member Berries herself. Upon becoming president-elect of the United States, he undergoes a transformation that gives him a toupee (solidifying the Trump comparison) and uses his newfound power to force people with whom he has had altercations (such as the new school principal and a grocery store employee who refused to allow him to double bag his groceries) to perform fellatio on him. Garrison plays a role in the season's conclusion by helping to defeat the season's other antagonists, but remains in power, flanked by member berries. Parker and Stone had expected Hillary Clinton to be victorious in the election, and described themselves as waiting for the election to end to focus on other storylines, intending for Garrison to return to teaching, humbled by his experiences. Garrison was intended to play a role in resolving the conflict between the male and female students in his classroom that had developed over the course of the season, taking responsibility for causing their behavior. Parker and Stone were, however, forced to rewrite the season's final episodes to accommodate Garrison (and Trump) being elected as president, and felt that they could not resolve some of the season's storylines in a satisfying way as a result. In Season 21, though stating how he can handle societal psychology despite being informed his approval ratings are very low as depicted in the episode \\"Doubling Down\\", a desperate Garrison ends up running back to South Park after launching a nuclear weapons at Toronto that killed a million Canadians in the end of \\"Super Hard PCness\\". Garrison was absent in Season 22 with the exception of a scene in the season finale, \\"Bike Parade\\" where he was in handcuffs. President Garrison reappears in the Season 24 South Park episode \\"The Pandemic Special\\" as an antagonist who wants the virus to continue killing people, because it's also killing Mexicans. At the end of the episode, the pangolin needed to create a cure for the virus-- and the doctor holding it-- are burned to death by Garrison with a flamethrower. =Name history= Mr. Garrison was commonly known as \\"Mr. Garrison\\" without a first name until the episode \\"The Entity\\", where it was revealed as \\"Herbert Garrison\\". However, in the episode \\"Cherokee Hair Tampons\\", when he wrote his book The Valley of the Penises, his name on the cover read as \\"Ethan Garrison\\", though this may simply be a pen name. As of season 21, he is generally not referred to by name at all, with characters only referring to him as \\"The President\\". Puppet personas =Mr. Hat= Mr. Hat (left) and Mr. Twig. Mr. Hat initially appeared to be simply a puppet used by Mr. Garrison as a teaching aid. However, it was soon apparent that Mr. Hat was able to perform activities that would not have been possible if he were merely a puppet. It is not entirely clear how much autonomy Mr. Hat and Mr. Garrison have from each other. In the episode \\"Chef Aid\\", Mr. Hat is able to drive a car through a prison wall to rescue Mr. Garrison and Chef, to which Chef remarks, \\"How the hell did he reach the gas pedal?\\". Further evidence of Hat's autonomy includes that Mr. Hat has been able to move his eyes and blink towards Mr. Garrison and Brett Favre, and that in \\"Worldwide Recorder Concert\\", where Mr. Hat beats up Mr. Mackey, but also in the South Park video game, where Mr. Hat owns and runs a robot factory by himself, or in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, when Satan picks up Mr. Hat as a companion to replace Saddam Hussein. Satan speaks Mr. Hat's lines in a voice very similar to Mr. Garrison's. Mr. Hat is also a racist, as seen in \\"Chef Goes Nanners\\", where he is a member of the South Park branch of the Ku Klux Klan. Mr. Hat argues with Mr. Garrison and seemingly disappears to attend a meeting without him. Mr. Hat also appears to be somewhat psychotic. In \\"Weight Gain 4000\\", furious at Kathie Lee Gifford for a talent show he and Mr. Garrison had lost years ago, Mr. Hat convinces Mr. Garrison to kill her, which he attempts to do. Again, whether this indicates that Mr. Hat is independent or if Mr. Garrison's own psychosis is simply projected to his puppet is impossible to say. In a fictional crossover psychotherapy session with Dr. Katz (from another Comedy Central series) in \\"Summer Sucks\\", Katz suggests that Mr. Hat was a personification of Mr. Garrison's \\"gay side\\". Garrison rejected this, and Katz was never able to counterpoint because he was killed shortly afterward by a gigantic novelty firework. Despite this suggestion, Mr. Garrison retained use of Mr. Hat even after coming out as gay, during the period when both were seen to be teaching kindergarten. Mr. Hat is permanently abandoned in favor of Mr. Slave once Mr. Garrison begins teaching fourth grade. Mr. Hat was not seen again until the climax of the episode \\"200\\", when Eric Cartman demands to speak with him, at which point Mr. Garrison produces Mr. Hat from a dresser drawer, and despite his initial reluctance, Garrison again seems to illustrate an inability to control Mr. Hat, and again addresses him separately. At the conclusion of the storyline, Mr. Hat is again discarded, and only appears again in the game South Park: The Stick of Truth, where he can be discovered inside Mr. Garrison's former boyfriend Mr. Slave's anus, and adds the player as a friend on social media. Parker and Stone have said that the removal of Mr. Hat was symbolic of the show abandoning its original style as a surreal comedy in favor of its current format of satirizing real-life issues and events. =Mr. Twig= Mr. Garrison temporarily replaced Mr. Hat with Mr. Twig (starting in the episode \\"Summer Sucks\\"), who consisted of a twig wearing a purple shirt with a pink triangle symbol. His voice was identical to Mr. Hat's until his final scene in \\"Chef Aid\\", where he spoke with a French accent. Mr. Twig was not well received by the children in Garrison's third grade class, who repeatedly called for the return of Mr. Hat and suggesting Mr. Twig would be better used as a coat rack, to which Garrison took much offense. Eventually, Mr. Hat returns in \\"Chef Aid\\", heralding the fact by some psychopathic attacks on Mr. Twig. Though Garrison constantly assured himself that Mr. Twig was a better choice than Mr. Hat, he came to terms with his attachment to Mr. Hat at the end of the episode upon being broken out of jail by him. Garrison got back with Mr. Hat after Mr. Twig advised him to follow his heart.

They are largely preserved in the Chinese Buddhist canon, the Tibetan Buddhist canon, and in extant Sanskrit manuscripts. Several hundred MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras survive in Sanskrit, or in Chinese and Tibetan translations. They are also sometimes called \\"Vaipulya\\" (extensive) s≈´tras by earlier sources.Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 66‚Äì74, doi:10.1111/j.1749-8171.2009.00193.x The Buddhist scholar Asa·πÖga classified the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras as part of the Bodhisattvapi·π≠aka, a collection of texts meant for bodhisattvas.Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching. 2001. pp. 199‚Äì200 Modern Buddhist studies scholars generally hold that these s≈´tras first began to appear between the 1st century BCE and the 1st century CE.Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism (2004): p. 293Akira, Hirakawa (translated and edited by Paul Groner) (1993). A History of Indian Buddhism. Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass: p. 252 They continued being composed, compiled and edited until the decline of Buddhism in India. Some of them may have also been composed outside of India, such as in Central Asia and in East Asia.Williams (2008), p. 85. MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhists typically consider several major MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras to have been taught by Gautama Buddha, committed to memory and recited by his disciples, in particular Ananda. However, other MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras are presented as being taught by other figures, such as bodhisattvas like Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ and Avalokite≈õvara. There are various reasons that Indian MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhists gave to explain the fact that they only appeared at a later time. One such reason was that they had been hidden away in the land of the NƒÅgas (snake deities, dragons) until the proper time for their dissemination arrived. The MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras were not accepted by all Buddhists in India, and the various Indian Buddhist schools disagreed on their status as \\"word of the Buddha\\".Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 68. They are generally not accepted as Buddha word by the modern Theravada school.Hay, Jeff (2009). \\"World Religions\\" p. 189. Greenhaven Publishing LLC.  History and background  =Origins and early history= The origins of the MahƒÅyƒÅna and their s≈´tras are not completely understood. Modern scholars have proposed numerous theories about the origins of MahƒÅyƒÅna and the MahƒÅyƒÅna texts. Some of the main theories are the following:Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism I: Recent Scholarship, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 55‚Äì65, doi:10.1111/j.1749-8171.2009.00193.xWilliams (2008), pp. 21-25, 30. * The lay origins theory, first proposed by Jean Przyluski and then defended by √âtienne Lamotte and Akira Hirakawa, states that laypersons were particularly important in the development of MahƒÅyƒÅna and its texts. This is partly based on some texts like the Vimalakirti S≈´tra, which praise lay figures at the expense of monastics. This theory is no longer widely accepted.\\"One of the most frequent assertions about the Mahayana is that it was a lay-influenced, or even lay- inspired and dominated, movement that arose in response to the increasingly closed, cold, and scholastic character of monastic Buddhism. This, however, now appears to be wrong on all counts...much of its [Hinayana's] program being in fact intended and designed to allow laymen and women and donors the opportunity and means to make religious merit.\\" Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism (2004): p. 494 * The theory which held that MahƒÅyƒÅna developed within the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika tradition. Drewes notes that there is actually little evidence that MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika schools had a special connection to the production of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts, and it seems MahƒÅyƒÅna arose as a pan-Buddhist phenomenon. * The \\"forest hypothesis\\", which states that MahƒÅyƒÅna arose mainly among hardcore wilderness ascetics (aranyavasins) who were attempting to imitate the Buddha. This has been defended by Paul Harrison and Jan Nattier. This theory is based on certain sutras like the Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra and the MahƒÅyƒÅna RƒÅ·π£·π≠rapƒÅlapa·πõiprcchƒÅ which promote ascetic practice in the wilderness as a superior and elite path. These texts criticize monks who live in cities and denigrate the forest life.Williams (2008), pp. 33-34. However, Drewes notes that only a few early MahƒÅyƒÅna texts advocate or promote this practice, and other S≈´tras outright discourage forest dwelling or say it is unnecessary. * The cult of the book theory, defended by Gregory Schopen, states that MahƒÅyƒÅna arose among a number of loosely connected book worshiping groups of monastics, who studied, memorized, copied and revered particular MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras. Schopen also argued that these groups mostly rejected stupa worship. According to David Drewes, none of these theories have been satisfactorily proven and they lack sufficient evidence. Drewes writes that the most likely origin of MahƒÅyƒÅna is that it was \\"primarily a textual movement, focused on the revelation, preaching, and dissemination of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, that developed within, and never really departed from, traditional Buddhist social and institutional structures.\\"Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 66‚Äì74, The figures of this movement probably saw themselves as bodhisattvas entrusted with teaching and preserving the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras.Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 66‚Äì74, doi:10.1111/j.1749-8171.2009.00193.x Scholars like Joseph Walser have also noted how MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras are heterogenous and seem to have been composed in different communities with varying ideas. Walser writes that \\"MahƒÅyƒÅna was probably never unitary, but differed from region to region.\\".Walser (2012), p. 24. Likewise, Hajime Nakamura states: > Unlike the various recensions of the Hƒ´nayƒÅna canon, which were virtually > closed by the early centuries of the common era and which shared, at least > ideally, a common structure . . . the MahƒÅyƒÅna scriptures were composed in a > variety of disparate social and religious environments over the course of > several centuries, diverge widely from each other in content and outlook, > and were in many cases meant to stand as individual works representing (it > has been conjectured) rivals to the entire Hƒ´nayƒÅna corpus. There is also no evidence that MahƒÅyƒÅna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, but rather that it existed within the early Buddhist schools as a certain set of ideals, texts and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. MahƒÅyƒÅnists also never had a separate Vinaya (monastic rule) from the early Buddhist schools.Williams, Paul (2008) Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations: p. 4-5 The Chinese monk Yijing who visited India in the seventh century, writes about how MahƒÅyƒÅna monastics and non-MahƒÅyƒÅna monastics lived together under the same Vinaya. The only difference among them was that MahƒÅyƒÅna monks venerated the bodhisattvas and read the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras.Williams, Paul (2008) Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations: p. 5 Some scholars like Richard Gombrich think that MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras only arose after the practice of writing down religious texts became widespread in India and thus that they were always written documents. However, James Apple and David Drewes have drawn attention to these oral features of the early MahƒÅyƒÅna texts, which were not written documents but orally preserved teachings. Drewes writes, that MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras > advocate mnemic ‚ÅÑ oral ‚ÅÑ aural practices more frequently than they do > written ones, make reference to people who have memorized or are in the > process of memorizing them, and consistently attach higher prestige to > mnemic‚ÅÑoral practices than to ones involving written texts. Study of > differences in various versions of sutras translated into Chinese has > directly shown that these texts were often transmitted orally. MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras were committed to memory and recited by important learned monks called \\"Dharma reciters\\" (dharmabhƒÅ·πáakas), who were viewed as the substitute for the actual speaking presence of the Buddha. Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of MahƒÅyƒÅna comes from early Chinese translations of MahƒÅyƒÅna texts. These MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings were first propagated into China by Lokak·π£ema, the first translator of MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras into Chinese during the second century.\\"The most important evidence ‚Äî in fact the only evidence ‚Äî for situating the emergence of the Mahayana around the beginning of the common era was not Indian evidence at all, but came from China. Already by the last quarter of the 2nd century CE, there was a small, seemingly idiosyncratic collection of substantial Mahayana sutras translated into what Erik Z√ºrcher calls 'broken Chinese' by an Indoscythian, whose Indian name has been reconstructed as Lokaksema.\\" Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism (2004): p. 492 The MahƒÅyƒÅna movement remained quite small until the fifth century, with very few manuscripts having been found before then (the exceptions are from Bamiyan). According to Joseph Walser, the fifth and sixth centuries saw a great increase in their production.Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, p. 29. By this time, Chinese pilgrims, such as Faxian, Yijing, and Xuanzang were traveling to India, and their writings describe monasteries which they label 'MahƒÅyƒÅna' as well as monasteries where both MahƒÅyƒÅna monks and non- MahƒÅyƒÅna monks lived together.Walser, Joseph, Nagarjuna in Context: Mahayana Buddhism and Early Indian Culture, Columbia University Press, 2005, pp. 40‚Äì41. =Modern scholarly views on dating= Dating the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras is quite difficult; and many can only be dated firmly to when they were translated into another language. Andrew Skilton summarizes a common prevailing view of the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras among modern Buddhist studies scholars as follows: A. K. Warder notes that the MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras are highly unlikely to have come from the teachings of the historical Buddha, since the language and style of every extant MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tra is comparable more to later Indian texts than to texts that could have circulated in the Buddha's putative lifetime.Indian Buddhism, A.K. Warder, 3rd edition, page 4-5 Warder also notes that the Tibetan historian TƒÅranƒÅtha (1575‚Äì1634) proclaimed that after the Buddha taught the sutras, they disappeared from the human world and circulated only in the world of the nagas. In Warder's view, ‚Äúthis is as good as an admission that no such texts existed until the 2nd century A.D.‚Äù Paul Williams writes that while MahƒÅyƒÅna tradition believes that the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras were taught by the Buddha, \\"source-critical and historical awareness has made it impossible for the modern scholar to accept this traditional account.\\"Williams (2008), p. 39. However, Williams further writes that > Nevertheless, it is not always absurd to suggest that a MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tra or > teaching may contain elements of a tradition which goes back to the Buddha > himself, which was played down or just possibly excluded from the canonical > formulations of the early schools. We have seen that even at the First > Council there is evidence of disagreement as regards the details of the > Buddha‚Äôs teaching. John W. Pettit writes that \\"MahƒÅyƒÅna has not got a strong historical claim for representing the explicit teachings of the historical Buddha\\". However, he also argues that basic MahƒÅyƒÅna concepts such as \\"the bodhisattva ethic, emptiness (sunyata), and the recognition of a distinction between buddhahood and arhatship as spiritual ideals,\\" can be seen in the PƒÅli Canon. According to Pettit, this suggests that MahƒÅyƒÅna is \\"not simply an accretion of fabricated doctrines\\" but \\"has a strong connection with the teachings of Buddha himself\\". = Beliefs of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhists = A painting by Nicholas Roerich (1925) depicting NƒÅgƒÅrjuna in the realm of the Nagas, where the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ was said to have been hidden. MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras are generally regarded by MahƒÅyƒÅnists as being more profound than the ≈õrƒÅvaka texts as well as generating more spiritual merit and benefit. Thus, they are seen as superior and more virtuous to non-MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras.Hamar, Imre. Reflecting Mirrors: Perspectives on Huayan Buddhism. 2007. p. 94Hookham, Dr. Shenpen, trans. (1998). The Shrimaladevi Sutra. Oxford: Longchen Foundation: p. 27 The study of MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras is central to East Asian Buddhism, where they are widely read and studied. In Tibetan Buddhism meanwhile, there is a greater emphasis on the study of MahƒÅyƒÅna ≈õƒÅstras (philosophical treatises), which are seen as more systematic ways of studying the content found in the s≈´tras.Williams (2008), p. 129. The MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras were not recognized as being Buddha word (buddhavacana) by various groups of Indian Buddhists and there was lively debate over their authenticity throughout the Buddhist world. Buddhist communities such as the MahƒÅsƒÅ·πÉghika school and the Theravada tradition of Sri Lanka became divided into groups which accepted or did not accept these texts.Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra. 2008. p. 68. TheravƒÅda commentaries of the Mahavihara sub-school mention these texts (which they call Vedalla/Vetulla) as not being the Buddha word and being counterfeit scriptures.Werner et al (2013). The Bodhisattva Ideal: Essays on the Emergence of Mahayana. pp. 89, 93. Buddhist Publication Society. Various MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras warn against the charge that they are not word of the Buddha and defend their authenticity in different ways.Werner et al (2013). The Bodhisattva Ideal: Essays on the Emergence of Mahayana. pp. 89-90, 211-212, 227. Buddhist Publication Society. Some MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras like as the Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha often criticize early Buddhist figures, such as Sariputra for lacking knowledge and goodness, and thus, these elders or ≈õrƒÅvaka are seen as not intelligent enough to receive the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings.Werner et al (2013). The Bodhisattva Ideal: Essays on the Emergence of Mahayana. p. 231. Buddhist Publication Society. The reason these accounts give for the historically late disclosure of the MahƒÅyƒÅna teachings is that most people were initially unable to understand the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras at the time of the Buddha (500 BCE) and suitable recipients for these teachings had not yet arisen.\\"Though the Buddha had taught [the Mahayana sutras] they were not in circulation in the world of men at all for many centuries, there being no competent teachers and no intelligent enough students: the sutras were however preserved in the Dragon World and other non-human circles, and when in the 2nd century AD adequate teachers suddenly appeared in India in large numbers the texts were fetched and circulated. ... However, it is clear that the historical tradition here recorded belongs to North India and for the most part to Nalanda (in Magadha).\\" AK Warder, Indian Buddhism, 3rd edition, 1999 Some traditional accounts of the transmission of the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ s≈´tras claim that they were originally stored or hidden in the realm of the nƒÅgas (serpent-like supernatural beings). Later, these s≈´tras were retrieved by NƒÅgƒÅrjuna. Other MahƒÅyƒÅna sources state that they were preached or preserved by bodhisattvas like Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ or Buddhas like VajradhƒÅra. Another MahƒÅyƒÅna explanation for the later appearance of the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras in the historical record is the idea that they are the revelations of certain Buddhas and bodhisattvas, transmitted through visions and meditative experiences to a select few individuals.Werner et al (2013). The Bodhisattva Ideal: Essays on the Emergence of Mahayana. pp. 89-90, 211-212, 227. Buddhist Publication Society. The practice of visualization of Buddhas (in texts like the SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha) has been seen by some scholars as a possible explanation for the source of certain MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras which were seen as revelations from Buddha in other heavenly worlds. Williams also notes that there are other MahƒÅyƒÅna texts which speak of s≈´tras being revealed or entrusted to forest dwelling monks by devas (deities). Paul Harrison notes that the idea that devas may preach the Buddha word is also present in non-MahƒÅyƒÅna texts.Williams, (2008), p. 40. Paul Harrison has also noted the importance of dream revelations in certain textss such as the Arya-svapna-nirdesa which lists and interprets 108 dream signs.Williams, (2008), pp. 40‚Äì41. According to Venerable Hsuan Hua, there are five types of beings who may speak \\"Buddha word\\": a buddha, a disciple of a buddha, a deva, a ·πõ·π£i (a sage), or an emanation of one of these beings; however, they must first receive certification from a Buddha that its contents are true Dharma.Hsuan Hua. The Buddha speaks of Amitabha Sutra: A General Explanation. 2003. p. 2 A different MahƒÅyƒÅna justification for the authenticity of the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras is that they are in accord with the truth, with the Buddha's Dharma and they lead to awakening. This is based on the idea that \\"Whatever is well spoken [subhasita], all that is the word of the Buddha [buddhabhasita].\\"Williams, (2008), p. 41. For example, Shantideva (8th century) states: > Through four factors is an inspired utterance [pratibhana] the word of the > Buddhas. What four? (i)...the inspired utterance is connected with truth, > not untruth; (ii) it is connected with the Dharma, not that which is not the > Dharma; (iii) it brings about the renunciation of moral taints [klesa] not > their increase; and (iv) it shows the laudable qualities of nirvana, not > those of the cycle of rebirth [samsara]. Williams writes that similar ideas can be found in the Pali Canon, though it is interpreted in a more open ended way in the MahƒÅyƒÅna in order to include a larger set of teachings that were seen as spiritually useful.Williams, (2008), p. 42. The modern Japanese Zen Buddhist scholar D. T. Suzuki similarly argued that while the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras may not have been directly taught by the historical Buddha, the \\"spirit and central ideas\\" of MahƒÅyƒÅna \\"are those of its founder\\". Thus, Suzuki admits (and celebrates) how the MahƒÅyƒÅna evolved and adapted itself to suit the times by developing new teachings and texts, while at the same time maintaining the core \\"spirit\\" of the Buddha.Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki (1907). Outlines of Maha≈∑√¢na Buddhism, pp. 13-16.  Teachings  A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra depicting Shadakshari Lokesvara, early 12th century, Opaque watercolor on palm leaf. = New ideas = The teachings as contained in the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras as a whole have been described as a loosely bound bundle of many teachings, which was able to contain the various contradictions.\\"It has become increasingly clear that Mahayana Buddhism was never one thing, but rather, it seems, a loosely bound bundle of many, and ‚Äî like Walt Whitman ‚Äî was large and could contain, in both senses of the term, contradictions, or at least antipodal elements.\\", Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism (2004): 492 Because of these contradictory elements, there are \\"very few things that can be said with certainty about MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism\\".Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism (2004): 492\\"But apart from the fact that it can be said with some certainty that the Buddhism embedded in China, Korea, Tibet, and Japan is Mahayana Buddhism, it is no longer clear what else can be said with certainty about Mahayana Buddhism itself, and especially about its earlier, and presumably formative, period in India.\\", Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism (2004): 492 Central to the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras is the ideal of the Bodhisattva path, something which is not unique to them however as such a path is also taught in non-Mahayana texts which also required prediction of future Buddhahood in the presence of a living Buddha.Drewes, David, Mahayana Sutras, forthcoming in Blackwell Companion to South and Southeast Asian Buddhism, Updated 2016 What is unique to MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras is the idea that the term bodhisattva is applicable to any person from the moment they intend to become a Buddha (i.e. the arising of bodhicitta) and without the requirement of a living Buddha. They also claim that any person who accepts and uses MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras either had already received or will soon receive such a prediction from a Buddha, establishing their position as an irreversible bodhisattva. Some MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras promote it as a universal path for everyone, while others like the Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ see it as something for a small elite of hardcore ascetics.Williams, Paul, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, 2008, pp. 29, 36, 43. While some MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras like the Vimalakirti s≈´tra and the White Lotus s≈´tra criticize arhats and sravakas (referring to non-MahƒÅyƒÅnists) as lacking wisdom, and reject their path as a lower vehicle, i.e. 'hƒ´nayƒÅna' (the 'inferior way'), earlier MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras do not do this.Conze, Edward, The Perfection of Wisdom in eight thousand lines and its verse summary As noted by David Drewes \\"early MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras often present their teachings as useful not only to people who wish to become Buddhas, but to those who wish to attain arhatship or pratyekabuddhahood as well. The old idea that the MahƒÅyƒÅna began with the rejection of the arhat ideal in favor of that of the bodhisattva is thus clearly incorrect.\\"Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 66‚Äì74, doi:10.1111/j.1749-8171.2009.00193.x Paul Williams also writes that earlier MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras like the Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra and the Ajitasena sutra do not present any antagonism towards the hearers or the ideal of arhatship like later sutras. According to David Drewes, MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras contain several elements besides the promotion of the bodhisattva ideal, including \\"expanded cosmologies and mythical histories, ideas of purelands and great, ‚Äòcelestial‚Äô Buddhas and bodhisattvas, descriptions of powerful new religious practices, new ideas on the nature of the Buddha, and a range of new philosophical perspectives.\\"Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 66‚Äì74, Several MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras depict Buddhas or Bodhisattvas not found in earlier texts, such as the Buddhas Amitabha, Akshobhya and Vairocana, and the bodhisattvas Maitreya, Ma√±jusri, Ksitigarbha, and Avalokiteshvara. An important feature of MahƒÅyƒÅna is the way that it understands the nature of Buddhahood. MahƒÅyƒÅna texts see Buddhas (and to a lesser extent, certain bodhisattvas as well) as transcendental or supramundane (lokuttara) beings, who live for eons constantly helping others through their activity.Williams, Paul, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, 2008, p. 21. According to Paul Williams, in MahƒÅyƒÅna, a Buddha is often seen as \\"a spiritual king, relating to and caring for the world\\", rather than simply a teacher who after his death \\"has completely ‚Äògone beyond‚Äô the world and its cares\\".Williams, Paul, Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations, Routledge, 2008, p. 27. Buddha Sakyamuni's life and death on earth is then usually understood docetically, as a \\"mere appearance\\", his death was an unreal show (which was done in order to teach others), while in reality he continues to live in a transcendent realm in order to help all beings. = Practices = Chanting the Buddhist Scriptures, by Taiwanese painter Li Mei-shu MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, especially those of the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ genre, teach the importance of the practice of the six perfections (pƒÅramitƒÅ) as part of the path to Buddhahood, and special attention is given to the perfection of wisdom (praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ) which is seen as primary.Williams (2008), pp. 50-51. The importance of developing bodhicitta, which refers to a mind that is aimed at full awakening (i.e. Buddhahood) is also stressed. Another central practice advocated by the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras is focused around \\"the acquisition of merit, the universal currency of the Buddhist world, a vast quantity of which was believed to be necessary for the attainment of Buddhahood\\". According to David Drewes, MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras include new religious practices that are supposed to make Buddhahood easy to achieve. Some of the most widely taught practices taught in MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras include:Drewes, David, Early Indian Mahayana Buddhism II: New Perspectives, Religion Compass 4/2 (2010): 66‚Äì74, doi:10.1111/j.1749-8171.2009.00193.x * hearing the names of certain Buddhas or bodhisattvas, or reciting their name * maintaining Buddhist precepts, * listening to, memorizing, reciting, preaching, worshiping and copying MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras, * rejoicing (anumodana) in the collected meritorious actions of all previous Buddhas and other beings. Another innovative \\"shortcut\\" to Buddhahood in MahƒÅyƒÅna sutras are what are often called Pure Land practices. These involve the invocation of Buddhas such as Amitabha and Aksobhya, who are said to have created \\"Buddha fields\\" or \\"pure lands\\" especially so that those beings who wish to be reborn there can easily and quickly become Buddhas. Reciting the MahƒÅyƒÅna s≈´tras and also simply the names of these Buddhas can allow one to be reborn in these places.  MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tra Collections  Some Buddhist Schools in India had collections of MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras which were part of their scriptural canon, sometimes in their own textual collection referred to as Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka. Jan Nattier notes that the Ugraparip·πõcchƒÅ S≈´tra mentions a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka (as part of a four part canon that also includes the Sutra Pi·π≠aka, the Vinaya Pi·π≠aka, and the Abhidharma Pi·π≠aka). According to Nattier, schools which maintained a Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka include the Dharmaguptaka and perhaps the Bahu≈õrutƒ´ya (or whoever authored the Tattvasiddhi-≈öƒÅstra).Nattier (2003), p. 46. Some sutras translated by Lokaksema (c. 147-189 CE) also mention a \\"Bodhisattva Pi·π≠aka\\".Kusumita Priscilla Pedersen (1976). The \\"dhyƒÅna\\" Chapter of the \\"Bodhisattvapi·π≠aka-s≈´tra\\" p. 25. Columbia University. In the 4th century MahƒÅyƒÅna abhidharma work Abhidharmasamuccaya, Asa·πÖga refers to the collection which contains the ƒÅgamas as the ≈örƒÅvakapi·π≠aka, and associates it with the ≈õrƒÅvakas and pratyekabuddhas.Boin-Webb, Sara (tr). Rahula, Walpola (tr). Asanga. Abhidharma Samuccaya: The Compendium of Higher Teaching. 2001. pp. 199-200 Asa·πÖga classifies the MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras as belonging to the Bodhisattvapi·π≠aka, which is designated as the collection of teachings for bodhisattvas. The MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras survive predominantly in \\"Buddhist Chinese\\" (f√≥ji√†o h√†ny«î ‰ΩõÊïôÊº¢Ë™û, a variety of written ancient Chinese) and Classical Tibetan translations. The source texts were probably in Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit or various Prakrit languages such as Gandhari. The main collections are found in the Tibetan Kangyur and the Chinese Tripi·π≠aka. There are also numerous Sankrit manuscripts of individual texts from various finds like Dunhuang, and Sanskrit collections from Nepal. Many parallel translations of certain S≈´tras exist. A handful of them, such as the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ sutras like the Heart Sutra and the Diamond Sutra, are considered fundamental by most modern MahƒÅyƒÅna traditions. = The earliest group of MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras translated into Chinese = Some scholars have traditionally considered the earliest MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras to include the very first versions of the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ series, along with texts concerning Akshobhya, which were probably composed in the 1st century BCE in the south of India.\\"The south (of India) was then vigorously creative in producing Mahayana sutras\\" ‚Äì Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). Indian Buddhism: p. 335. According to A.K. Warder, some scholars think that the earliest MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras were mainly composed in the south of India, and later the activity of writing additional scriptures was continued in the north.\\"The sudden appearance of large numbers of (Mahayana) teachers and texts (in North India in the second century AD) would seem to require some previous preparation and development, and this we can look for in the South.\\" - Warder, A.K. (3rd edn. 1999). Indian Buddhism: p. 335. Some of the earliest MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras were translated by the Kushan monk Lokak·π£ema, who came to China from the kingdom of GandhƒÅra. His first translations to Chinese were made in the Eastern Han capital of Luoyang between 178 and 189 CE. The editors of the Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka attribute twelve texts to Lokak·π£ema. These attributions have been studied in detail by Erik Z√ºrcher, Paul Harrison and Jan Nattier, and some have been called into question. Z√ºrcher considers it reasonably certain that Lokak·π£ema translated the following:Nattier 2008: 76-7 * T224. ÈÅìË°åËà¨Ëã•Á∂ì.

Harrison is doubtful about T626, and considers that T418 is the product of revision and does not date from Lokak·π£ema's time. Conversely, Harrison considers that T624 Druma-kinnara-rƒÅja-parip·πõcchƒÅ-s≈´tra (‰ºÖÁúüÈôÄÁæÖÊâÄÂïèÂ¶Ç‰æÜ‰∏âÊòßÁ∂ì) ought to be considered genuine. = The S≈´trasamuccaya = The S≈´trasamuccaya is a compendium of s≈´tra quotations which survives in Tibetan and Chinese translation.

It consists of eighty-five volumes. The MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras are contained in various sections of the canon: * Praj√±apƒÅramitƒÅ Section * Saddharma Pu·πá·∏çarƒ´ka Section * Avata·πÉsaka Section * Ratnak≈´·π≠a Section * MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa Section * MahƒÅsannipƒÅta Section * Sutra Collection Section = In the Tibetan Canon = In the Tibetan Buddhist Canon, MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tra translations are found in the Kangyur (Wylie: bka'-'gyur). They are traditionally divided into four divisions: * Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ (sher phyin), 23 S≈´tras. * BuddhƒÅvata·πÉsaka (phal chen), a single long text which is actually a composite work. * Ratnak≈´ta (dkon brtsegs), 49 S≈´tras. * General S≈´tra collection (mdo sde), 266 s≈´tras, varied in length, subject, interlocutors and origins. Most are MahƒÅyƒÅna works, but a few are non-MahƒÅyƒÅna texts.  Key MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras  =Proto-Mahayana sutras= The Ajitasena S≈´tra has been called \\"Proto-MahƒÅyƒÅna\\" by Paul Williams. While it promotes Buddhahood for all, the text lacks the usual antagonism towards the ≈õravakas and arhats, as is typical of later MahƒÅyƒÅna texts like the Vimalakƒ´rti-nirde≈õa S≈´tra. It also lacks any self-awareness of itself as being part of \\"MahƒÅyƒÅna.\\" It promotes giving to monks like any non-MahƒÅyƒÅna text, but also includes the depiction of a prince who has visions of many Buddhafields (including Sukhavati and Abhirati) on becoming an arhat.Williams (2008), pp. 27-30, 46. The Salistamba S≈´tra (rice stalk or rice sapling s≈´tra) has been considered as one of the first Mahayana sutras.Reat, N. Ross. The ≈öƒÅlistamba s≈´tra : Tibetan original, Sanskrit reconstruction, English translation, critical notes (including Pali parallels, Chinese version, and ancient Tibetan fragments). Delhi : Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, 1993, p. 1. According to N. Ross Reat, this sutra has many parallels with the material in the Pali suttas (especially the Mahatanha- sahkhaya sutta, M1:256-71), and could date as far back as 200 BCE.Reat, 1993, p. 3-4. It is possible that this sutra represents a period of Buddhist literature before MahƒÅyƒÅna doctrine had diverged significantly from the doctrines of the early Buddhist texts.Potter, Karl H. Abhidharma Buddhism to 150 A.D. page 32. = Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tras = Heart S≈´tra in the Siddha·πÉ script. Biblioth√®que nationale de France Some of the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tras are considered to be some of the earliest MahƒÅyƒÅna S≈´tras. Various Western scholars generally hold that the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra is one of the earliest of these texts (c. 1st century BCE). The VajracchedikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra is also seen by scholars like Schopen and numerous Japanese scholars as being very early.M√§ll, Linnart. Studies in the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ and other essays. 2005. p. 96Williams, Paul. MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism: the Doctrinal Foundations. London, UK: Routledge. ISBN 0-415-02537-0. p.42 Paul Williams also notes that in Lewis Lancaster's analysis of the earliest Chinese versions of the A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrikƒÅ Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tra \\"a number of key Mahayana concepts are missing from the earliest versions although present in later versions. The world of the earliest A·π£·π≠asƒÅhasrika is reasonably close to that of the pre-Mahayana traditions.\\"Williams (2008), p 29. The main topics of these S≈´tras are the path of the bodhisattva, the six transcendent virtues and, in particular, transcendent wisdom (praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ) the most important of these. The bodhisattva \\"mahasattva\\" (great being) is a being who is training towards full Buddhahood for the benefit of all.Williams (2008), p. 55. \\"Transcendent Wisdom\\" (also: the \\"Perfection of Wisdom\\") meanwhile, means the ability to see reality as it truly is, a deep and liberating spiritual knowledge that is the source of all virtues. Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ is thus \\"a state of consciousness which understands emptiness (shunyata), the absence of ‚Äòself‚Äô or intrinsic nature even in dharmas.\\"Williams (2008), p 50. Since all phenomna (even Nirvana) lack any essence, unchanging core or independence, they are merely conceptual constructs and as such, they are like magical illusions (maya).Williams (2008), pp. 52-53. Many of these sutras are known by the number of lines, or ≈õlokas, that they contain, such as the Pa√±cavi·πÉ≈õatisƒÅhasrikƒÅ (25,000 line) PP S≈´tra, the A·π£·π≠ada≈õasƒÅhasrikƒÅ (18,000 lines), and the ≈öatasƒÅhasrikƒÅ (100,000 lines) etc. = The Lotus S≈´tra = The floating jeweled stupa; illustrated Lotus Sutra, Japan 1257. The Saddharma-pundarƒ´ka-s≈´tra (True Dharma White Lotus S≈´tra) is a very influential S≈´tra, especially in East Asian Buddhism, where it is considered the supreme S≈´tra by many East Asian Buddhists (especially in the Tiantai and Nichiren schools).Williams (2008), p. 149. Probably written down between 100 BCE -150 CE, the Lotus S≈´tra states that the three yƒÅnas (≈õrƒÅvakayƒÅna, pratyekabuddhayƒÅna and bodhisattvayƒÅna) are not real paths leading to different goals, there is in fact only one path (ekayƒÅna), with one goal - Buddhahood.Williams (2008), pp. 150-153. The sutra predicts that all those who hear the Dharma will eventually achieve this goal. The earlier teachings are said to be skilful means to teach beings according to their capacities. The sutra is notable for the idea that a Buddha is not inaccessible after his parinirvƒÅ·πáa since a Buddha's life-span is incaculably long. Instead of passing into a totally transcendent state, a Buddha remains to help all sentient beings in countless ways, like a great spiritual father that has been around for eons and will continue to teach for many more eons to come.Williams (2008), pp. 156-157. In some East Asian traditions, the Lotus S≈´tra has been compiled together with two other sutras which serve as a prologue and epilogue, respectively the Innumerable Meanings Sutra and the Samantabhadra Meditation Sutra. This composite sutra is often called the Threefold Lotus S≈´tra or Three-Part Dharma Flower Sutra. = S≈´tras devoted to particular figures = Vietnamese Mahayana SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha S≈´tra A large number of S≈´tras focus on the nature, teachings and virtues of a particular Buddha or bodhisattva. Some of them also include teachings on how to enter the \\"buddha- field\\" (buddhak·π£etra, a.k.a. pure land) of a particular Buddha. These S≈´tras include: * S≈´tras which focus on AmitƒÅbha Buddha and his buddha-field of Sukhavati, mainly the Long SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha, AmitƒÅyurdhyƒÅna and the Short SukhƒÅvatƒ´vy≈´ha. These texts are very influential in East Asia, particularly in Pure Land Buddhism, which focuses on the salvific power of faith in AmitƒÅbha's power to transport all beings to his pure land. In addition to these, many other texts also feature AmitƒÅbha Buddha, and a total of 290 such works have been identified in the Taish≈ç Tripi·π≠aka. * The Ak·π£obhya-tathƒÅgata-syavy≈´ha S≈´tra, which focuses on the Buddha Ak·π£obhya and his pure land of Abhirati, and is one of the oldest \\"Pure land\\" texts.Strauch, Ingo (2008). The Bajaur collection: A new collection of Kharo·π£·π≠hƒ´ manuscripts ‚Äì A preliminary catalogue and survey * S≈´tras which focus on the bodhisattva Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ and his teachings, such as the Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´-buddhak·π£etra-gu·πáavy≈´ha (Array of Ma√±jushri‚Äôs Buddhaland).Williams (2008), p. 227. * The K·π£itigarbhas≈´tra, which focuses on the bodhisattva K·π£itigarbha. * S≈´tras which focus on the bodhisattva ƒÄkƒÅ≈õagarbha. * S≈´tras which focus on Maitreya, like the Maitreyavyakarana (Maitreya Prophecy).Williams (2008), p. 218. * The Bhai·π£ajya-guru-vai·∏ç≈´rya- prabhƒÅ-rƒÅja S≈´tra, which focuses on Bhai·π£ajyaguru, a healing Buddha also known as the \\"Medicine Buddha\\". Some sutras, like the Bhadra-kalpika Sutra, give a list of numerous Buddhas. = Meditation focused S≈´tras = Amongst the earliest MahƒÅyƒÅna texts, the SamƒÅdhi S≈´tras are a collection of sutras that focus on the attainment of profound states of consciousness reached in meditation, perhaps suggesting that meditation played an important role in early MahƒÅyƒÅna. These include the Pratyutpanna-s≈´tra, SamƒÅdhirƒÅja-s≈´tra, and the ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama-samƒÅdhi-s≈´tra. There are also some meditation focused texts called DhyƒÅna S≈´tras (Á¶™Áµå) translated by Chinese translators like Kumarajiva. Some of these S≈´tras contain MahƒÅyƒÅna meditation teachings. There is also another genre of MahƒÅyƒÅna meditation texts called Visualization Sutras (Chinese: ËßÄÁ∂ì, guan jing).Soper, Alexander Coburn. Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China. Artibus Asiae Supplementum 19. Ascona, Switzerland: Artibus Asiae, 1959. = YogƒÅcƒÅra S≈´tras = These sutras primarily teach the doctrine of vij√±apti-mƒÅtra (ideas-only, impressions-only etc.), associated with the YogƒÅcƒÅra school, which states that we are only ever aware of mental images or impressions which manifest themselves as external objects, but are not actually external to the mind.Siderits, Mark, Buddhism as philosophy, 2017, p. 149. There are many modern interpretations of this doctrine, some which are idealistic, and some which reject the idealist interpretations in favor of phenomenology or representationalism. The ƒÄrya-sa·πÉdhi-nirmocana-S≈´tra (Noble s≈´tra of the Explanation of the Profound Secrets, c. 2nd century CE) is the earliest surviving sutra in this class, and its the main text. It divides the teachings of the Buddha into three types, which it calls the \\"three turnings of the wheel of Dharma.\\"Williams (2008), p. 85. To the first turning, it ascribes the ƒÄgamas of the ≈õravakas, to the second turning the lower MahƒÅyƒÅna sutras including the Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ sutras, and finally sutras like itself are deemed to comprise the third turning. Moreover, the first two turnings are considered to be provisional (neyƒÅrtha) in this system of classification, while the third group is said to present the final truth without a need for further explication (nƒ´tƒÅrtha).Williams (2008), p. 86. The well-known La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra, composed sometime around the 4th century CE, is sometimes included in this group, although it is somewhat syncretic in nature, combining YogƒÅcƒÅra doctrines with those of the tathƒÅgatagarbha texts. The La·πÖkƒÅvatƒÅra S≈´tra was influential in Chan Buddhism. = The Vimalakirtinirde≈õa = Vimalakƒ´rti Debates Manjusri, Dunhuang Mogao Caves In the Vimalakirtinirde≈õa, composed some time between the first and second century CE, the bodhisattva Vimalakƒ´rti appears as a layman to teach the Dharma. This is seen by some as a strong assertion of the value of lay practice. The sutra teaches, among other subjects, the meaning of non-dualism, the doctrine of the true body of the Buddha, the characteristically MahƒÅyƒÅna claim that the appearances of the world are mere illusions, and the superiority of the MahƒÅyƒÅna over other paths. It places in the mouth of the lay practitioner Vimalakƒ´rti a teaching addressed to both arhats and bodhisattvas, regarding the doctrine of ≈õ≈´nyatƒÅ. In most versions, the discourse of the text culminates with a wordless teaching of silence. This sutra has been very popular in China and Japan. = TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tras = These texts teach the doctrine of TathƒÅgatagarbha, (TathƒÅgata-embryo, TathƒÅgata-womb, TathƒÅgata- matrix, also known as \\"Buddha-nature\\"). According to Williams, this doctrine states that all beings \\"have a TathƒÅgata [i.e. a Buddha] within them, in seed or embryo, that sentient beings are the wombs or matrices of the TathƒÅgata, or that they have a TathƒÅgata as their essence, core, or essential inner nature.\\"Williams (2008), p. 104. Possibly the earliest of these is the TathƒÅgatagarbha S≈´tra. Other texts in this genre include the ≈örƒ´mƒÅlƒÅ S≈´tra, the A·πÖgulimƒÅlƒ´ya S≈´tra, the Anunatva-Apurnatva-Nirdesa and the MahƒÅyƒÅna MahƒÅparinirvƒÅ·πáa S≈´tra (not to be confused with the PƒÅli Mahaparinibbana Sutta and its parallels). = S≈´tra Compilations = Goryeo BuddhƒÅvata·πÉsaka manuscript, 14th century. There are also S≈´tras which are actually collections of other sutras that circulate as one \\"sutra\\". Two of these are the MahƒÅratnak≈´·π≠a S≈´tra (The Heap of Jewels S≈´tra) which contains 49 individual S≈´tras, and the MahƒÅsamnipƒÅta-s≈´tra (S≈´tra of the Great Assembly) which is a collection of 17 shorter S≈´tras. Another influential S≈´tra compilation is the BuddhƒÅvata·πÉsaka S≈´tra (The Buddha Wreath S≈´tra), a large composite text consisting of several S≈´tras, some of which circulated separately as independent S≈´tras.Williams (2008), pp. 132-133. These include the Da≈õabh≈´mika S≈´tra and the Ga·πá·∏çavy≈´ha S≈´tra. The BuddhƒÅvata·πÉsaka probably reached its current form by about the 4th century CE and this compilation may have happened in Central Asia.Gimello, Robert M. (2005) [1987]. \\"Huayan\\". In Jones, Lindsay (ed.). Encyclopedia of Religion. 6 (2nd ed.). Detroit: Macmillan. pp. 4145‚Äì4149. ISBN 978-0-02-865733-2. Williams notes that the sutra includes both the mind-only and the emptiness doctrine, but does so mainly from the perspective of highly advanced beings who have spiritually realized these teachings through deep meditative absoprtion, and thus have all sorts of magical powers which they use to help others.Williams (2008), pp. 133-134. The BuddhƒÅvata·πÉsaka is therefore a text that depicts various mystical visionary scenes, with countless world systems and countless Buddhas and bodhisattvas who travel freely throughout this multiverse helping all beings out of compassion. One of the most important Buddhas in this text is MahƒÅvairocana (\\"Great Iluminator\\"), who fills the entire cosmos with his light, his omniscient awareness and his magical emanations (one of which was Shakyamuni Buddha).Williams (2008), pp. 134-135. In China, the BuddhƒÅvata·πÉsaka became the central text for the Huayen (Jp. Kegon) school of Buddhism, which later went on to influence Chinese Chan Buddhism and Pure Land Buddhism.Williams (2008), p. 140. = Discipline S≈´tras = These focus on principles that guide the behaviour of bodhisattvas, and include the KƒÅshyapa-parivarta, the Bodhisattva-prƒÅtimok·π£a Sutra, and the BrahmajƒÅla Sutra. For monastics, the Bequeathed Teachings Sutra is a necessary manual that guides them through the life of cultivation. = Confession S≈´tras = The Triskandha S≈´tra and the Golden Light Sutra (Suvar·πáaprabhƒÅsa-s≈´tra) focus on the practice of confession of faults. The Golden Light Sutra became especially influential in Japan, where its chapter on the universal sovereign was used by Japanese emperors to legitimise their rule and it provided a model for a well-run state. =Esoteric S≈´tras= apotropaic MahƒÅpratisarƒÅdhƒÅra·πáƒ´, in Sanskrit and Siddha·πÉ script, Later Tang, 927 CE. Esoteric S≈´tras comprise an important category of works that are related to esoteric Buddhist practices. Many of these are often devoted to a particular mantra or dhƒÅra·πáƒ´, or simply contain passages which teach these magical spells or chants. One of them, the Atanatiya Sutra, is also included in the Mikkyo (esoteric) division of the standard modern collected edition of Sino-Japanese Buddhist literature.Skilling, Mahasutras, Volume II, Parts I & II, 1997, Pali Text Society, Lancaster Well-known esoteric S≈´tras include: * U·π£·πáƒ´·π£a Vijaya DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ S≈´tra * Nƒ´laka·πá·π≠ha DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ * Cundƒ´ DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ S≈´tra * Eleven-Faced Avalokitesvara Heart Dharani S≈´tra * MahƒÅpratisarƒÅ-mahƒÅvidyƒÅrƒÅj√±ƒ´ * The ≈ö≈´ra·πÖgama S≈´tra, which teaches the \\"SitƒÅtapatra U·π£·πáƒ´·π£a DhƒÅra·πáƒ´\\" (Ch.

Some Praj√±aparamita texts also include tantric and esoteric elements such as mantras. At least some editions of the Tibetan canon include the Heart Sutra in the tantra division.Conze, The Prajnaparamita Literature, Mouton, the Hague, 1960, p. 72; Rgyud is Tibetan for tantra = Apocryphal S≈´tras = There are various S≈´tras that were considered as being translations from Indian sources but that modern scholars have now shown were most likely composed in East Asia or Central Asia.

(2005) Buddhism and Science: Breaking New Ground (review) Buddhist-Christian Studies - Volume 25, 2005, pp. 176-180 While downplaying Buddhism's theological attributes, they assert that Buddhism contains philosophic and psychological teachings that share commonalities with modern scientific and philosophic thought, or they assert that modern Western thinkers were variously influenced by Buddhist concepts. An example of such a claim would be that Buddhism encourages the impartial investigation of Nature (an activity referred to as Dhamma-Vicaya in the Pali Canon) ‚Äî the principal object of study being oneself. Some popular conceptions of Buddhism connect it to modern theories of evolution, quantum theory, and cosmology, though most scientists see a separation between the religious and metaphysical statements of Buddhism and the methodology of science.Donald S. Lopez Jr., Buddhism and Science: A Guide for the Perplexed, (University of Chicago Press 2008) Buddhism has been described by some as rational and non-dogmatic, and there is evidence that this has been the case from the earliest period of its history, though some have suggested this aspect is given greater emphasis in modern times and is a minority reinterpretation of the tradition.Snodgrass, Judith. (2007) Defining Modern Buddhism: Mr. and Mrs. Rhys Davids and the PƒÅli Text Society Comparative Studies of South Asia, Africa and the Middle East - Volume 27, Number 1, 2007, pp. 186-202 Historically, Buddhism encompasses so many types of beliefs and practices that most non-sectarian observers think it futile to try to assert any single coherent scriptural or philosophical description. There are many examples throughout the Buddhist world of dogmatism, clericalism and the belief in the supernatural. Nor, with the exception of Tibetan Buddhism, have all but a few schools of Buddhism been open to scientific discoveries. Buddhism is a varied tradition and aspects include fundamentalism, devotional traditions,Safire, William (2007) The New York Times Guide to Essential Knowledge p.718 and supplication to local spirits.Deegalle, Mahinda (2006) Popularizing Buddhism: Preaching as Performance in Sri Lanka p.131 Nevertheless, certain commonalities have been cited between scientific investigation and Buddhist thought. Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, in a speech at the meeting of the Society for Neuroscience,\\"Talking Up Enlightenment.\\" Christina Reed Scientific American, 6 February 2006 listed a \\"suspicion of absolutes\\" and a reliance on causality and empiricism as common philosophical principles shared between Buddhism and science.\\"The Neuroscience of Meditation.\\" November 12, 2005 speech given by the Dalai Lama Buddhism and psychology During the 1970s, several experimental studies suggested that Buddhist meditation could produce insights into a wide range of psychological states. Interest in the use of meditation as a means of providing insight into mind-states has recently been revived, following the increased availability of such brain-scanning technologies as fMRI and SPECT. Such studies are enthusiastically encouraged by the present Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, who has long expressed an interest in exploring the connection between Buddhism and science and regularly attends the Mind and Life Institute Conferences. In 1974 the Kagyu Buddhist teacher Ch√∂gyam Trungpa predicted that \\"Buddhism will come to the West as psychology\\". This view was apparently regarded with considerable skepticism at the time, but Buddhist concepts have indeed made most in-roads in the psychological sciences. Some modern scientific theories, such as Rogerian psychology, show strong parallels with Buddhist thought. Some of the most interesting work on the relationship between Buddhism and science is being done in the area of comparison between Yogacara theories regarding the store consciousness and modern evolutionary biology, especially DNA. This is because the Yogacara theory of karmic seeds works well in explaining the nature/nurture problem.Waldron, William S. (1995).

It runs from the Fosse Way at Bourton on the Water in Gloucestershire () to Templeborough in South Yorkshire (). It passes through Alcester, Studley, Redditch, Metchley Fort, Birmingham, Sutton Coldfield, Lichfield, Burton upon Trent and Derby. Names upright Four Roman roads having the King's protection are named in the Laws of Edward the Confessor: Watling Street, Ermine Street, the Fosse Way and Hikenild or Icknield Street.Leges Edwardi Regis, David Wilkin, p190 Hikenild Strete is generally supposed to be connected with the country of the Iceni. Various forms of the name (the earliest in Anglo-Saxon charters are Icenhilde Weg or Icenilde Weg) designate other roads from the borders of Norfolk through Cambridgeshire, Bucks, Berks, Hants and Wilts into Dorset. These locations, however, would identify the route as Icknield Way an Iron Age trackway running from Norfolk to Dorset. What is today referred to as the Icknield Street road acquired the name Ryknild Street during the 12th century, when it was named by Ranulf Higdon, a monk of Chester writing in 1344 in his Polychronicon. Higdon gives the name as Rikenild Strete, which, he says, tends from the south-west to the north, and begins at St. David's in Wales and continues across England to the mouth of the Tyne, passing Worcester, Droitwich, Birmingham, Lichfield, Derby, and Chesterfield. It has borne that name, or Rigning, Reenald or Rignall, from early times. In three of the four MSS of Higdon the name is given as Rikenilde or Rikenyldes, and in the fourth (which is said to be one of the earliest), Hikenil Street. Trevisa's English translation (1387) calls it Rykeneldes Strete.Roman Roads in Britain, Thomas Codrington, SPCK, London, 1903. Harverfield, writing in the Victoria County History of WarwickshireVictoria County History of Warwickshire Vol I, p. 239, 1904 doubted whether the road had any real and original right to either name, preferring Ryknild as no less correct (or no more incorrect), and being able to distinguish it from Icknield Street in Oxfordshire and Berkshire.Highways and Byways in Shakespeare's Country, Hutton 1914 It is now called Icknield or Ryknild Street to distinguish it from the older Icknield Way. In the 19th century it is also referred to in antiquarian literature with the spelling of Rykneld Street. A preserved section of the Roman road can be seen at Sutton Park, now in the City of Birmingham.Sutton Park , Birmingham Roman Roads Project, University of Birmingham, Accessed 29 December 2008 Route George William Collen's book Britannia Saxonica (1833) concisely outlines the route, drawing on Leland's Itinerary: \\"... stated to have led from St. David's to Tynemouth. Its exact course [through Wales] is little known: it may, however, be traced from Gloucester to Norton; thence to a little east of Tewkesbury; thence to Ashchurch, Bekford, Aston-under-hill, to the west of Sedgebarrow in Worcestershire; thence to Hinton, a little east of Evesham, South Littleton, to Bitford in Warwickshire, through Wicksford to Alcester; thence near Coughton, Studley, and Ipsley; enters Worcestershire again near Beoley, passes near Egbaston in that county, and a little west of Birmingham crosses the [River] Tame at Woodford Bridge into Staffordshire; runs through Sutton Park and by Shenston, cuts the WAETLINGA-STRAETE (Watling Street) about a mile from Wall and Lichfield; thence to Streetley, crosses the [River] Trent at Whichnor; then taking Branston in its way, leaving Burton-upon Trent half-a- mile to the east, passes through Stretton, enters Derbyshire over Monk's Bridge near Egginton. The direction of this road cannot be traced further, although its course is said to have been through Derby, Chesterfield, York, and so to Tynemouth.\\"Britannia Saxonica (1833), pages 9-10. Today's route Much of the Midlands route of the Icknield Street is used by modern roads, most notably the A38 from Lichfield to Derby; and many sections retain the name \\"Icknield Street\\", but not always accurately as in Hockley, Birmingham and in Redditch, Worcestershire where there is also a road called Icknield Street Drive' which stands near the course of the Roman road. \\"Ryknild Street\\" is still in use in Lichfield and \\"Ryknild Road\\" in Derby. =Bourton-on-the- Water to Bidford-on-Avon= Condicote Lane, north of Bourton-on-the-Water. The road appears to have joined the Fosse Way near Bourton-on‚Äëthe‚ÄëWater. Starting about two miles north of there, and two miles west of Stow-on-the-Wold, a lane (Condicott Lane) runs northwards in a straight line to Condicote and then Hinchwick. This lane appears to indicate the course of Icknield Street. It leads towards high ground, about on Bourton Down. It is not clear how the ascent of from Hinchwick to the Down was made, but on the Down a lane northwards from Springhill takes nearly the same line for to near the Evesham road , from which a parish boundary over Saintbury Hill seems to mark the course down the north side. On the west side of Weston Park, a line seems to be taken up lying between high ground , to the south, and Alcester, to the north. A road in this line, passing on the west of Weston-sub‚ÄëEdge, leads on to a highway with a parish boundary along it called Riknild or Icknield Street, which is crossed by the railway at Honeybourne Station. It continues northward under the name of Buckle Street to Staple Hill, one mile south of Bidford-on-Avon. This is probably the oldest version of the name being the modern form of a name Bucgan or Buggilde Street which appears in documents earlier than the Norman Conquest. As the road approaches Bidford there is a slight turn, and the modern road heads for the crossing point of the medieval bridge whereas the Roman ford is upstream of here and the road name preserved in a small road named Icknield Street on the northern bank. Evidence of a Roman causeway here confirms this as the Roman crossing point.\\"Warwickshire Time Trail\\" The Archaeology of Bidford on Avon Accessed 19 February 2011 =Bidford-on-Avon to Birmingham= Near Beoley in Worcestershire From Bidford following the named Icknield Street the line of the road ten follows Waterloo Street through Bidford and then across country as the B4085. At Wixford by the Three Horse Shoes Inn the modern road turns west whilst the line of the road continues north in a hollow way to Saint Milburga's church where it becomes a track running along the ridge to the east of Ragley Hall heading towards Alcester. At Alcester the original crossing point has been lost due to changes in the course of the river and the development of the town but the line is recovered north of the town on the modern A435. Passing Coughton Court the road bears the local name of Headon or Haydon Way and proceeds through Studley and to one mile beyond, where the modern road turns off to the north-eastward. Heading north much of the route is lost, since Codrington wrote, in the development of Redditch, however Icknield Street Drive, Battens Drive approximates the route until a small road through the residential area of Churchill marked Ryknield Street on the modern 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey map, exactly in a line with Haydon Way, is reached. This line appears to point from Alcester to high ground about , one mile east of Rowney Green, and north of Beoley. Now the B4497 the road heads north through Beoley crossing under the M42 motorway just south of Alcott Farm. It retains the name Icknield Street, climbing the high ground of Swans Hill between the Coach and Horses Public House at Weatheroak and the Peacock Inn at the junction with Lea End Lane. Here, a hedge line and footpath run directly up the hill while the modern road deviates slightly to the east to accommodate the incline before rejoining the original route and continuing north until it enters the suburbs of Birmingham at Kings Norton adjacent to the Romano British settlement of Longdales Road.Birmingham University Excavations at Longdales Road, Kings Norton 2006 Accessed 27 May 2011 It then follows the course of Walkers Heath Road over the traffic roundabout at Parsons Hill, to Broadmeadow Lane, Lifford Lane, Pershore Road and Hazelwell Street, finally disappearing into residential developments at Stirchley by the swimming baths. =Across Birmingham= Birmingham's Middle Ring Road. The 7 miles from Stirchley in the south of Birmingham to Perry Bridge at Holford in the north is a serious problem. It has long vexed Birmingham antiquaries and is perhaps insoluble. HuttonHistory of Birmingham, William Hutton, 1781, p. 142 gave the course as \\"onwards by Stirchley Street, crossing the Bromsgrove road at Selly Oak, leaving Harborne a mile to the west, by the observatory in Lady Wood Lane, crossing the Dudley Road at Sandpits, and along Worstone Lane, passing five furlongs north of the Navigation Bridge in Great Charles Street, Birmingham. He saw the section of the road where the inhabitants attempted to pull it up for the sake of the materials, 20 yards wide, and one yard deep, filled up with stone cemented with coarse mortar,\\" and he says that \\"the course was discoverable by its barren track through uncultivated meadows.\\" Icknield Street or Icknield Port Road are not old names and cannot be traced in the city prior to 1825 and may have been introduced as a result of Hutton's theory. Birmingham and its suburbs now cover the old road. The line of Hazelwell Street sets the course of the road towards the next established point of the route at Metchley Fort in the grounds of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital. The fort was established about 48 AD by the Roman army as a base camp for its conquest of the Birmingham areaVictor Skipp, The History of Greater Birmingham - down to 1830, 1980. and part of a network of forts across the Midlands linked by roads.Birmingham's Roman Fort Main Findings It stood by Birmingham's earliest known road junction at the point where Icknield Street was met by Roman roads coming in from Droitwich and Penkridge. From here the road runs north to another fort at Wall, Roman Etocetum near Lichfield. The Perry Bridge of 1711 stands at its crossing of the River Tame in Perry Barr. However, Walker cast doubts on this orthodox view of the road's course in this areaWalker, B, 1936 The Rycknield Street in the Neighbourhood of Birmingham Trans Birmingham & Warwickshire Archaeol Soc 60, 42-55 and resistivity surveys undertaken on sites either side of the crossing in 1992, showed that, although the line of the road is clearly indicated on old maps and aerial photographs, the site has been considerably altered this century by, among other things, the embankment of the M6. The one place where the road might have been detected proved inaccessible without considerable clearance of dense undergrowth (remnants of a hedge-line following the road?) and a 20-metre grid on adjacent open ground proved negative. The second site was on wasteland immediately south of the river. Here, the \\"Walker\\" road-line only shaved the top comer of this before disappearing under a modern industrial development (plot-holders in allotments to the south did not recall any finds during building work, nor were they able to identify any \\"hard\\" areas on their land, where the \\"Walker\\" line might be expected to continue). A series of complete and partial 20-metre grids laid down the fence line between the industrial estate and the wasteland and then right across the open area yielded nothing which could relate to the \\"Walker\\" line but did produce some low resistance features running parallel with the site's east boundary.Holford , Birmingham Roman Roads Project, University of Birmingham, Accessed 27 May 2011\\"West Midlands Archaeology\\" issue 40, 1997, page 102 =Birmingham to Lichfield= Knowle Lane near Knowle Farm. From Perry Bridge the road heads North, Coddrington describes the route as following a county boundary for a quarter of a mile and then a road, now the B4138, Kingstanding Road, until it enters Sutton Park close to the old Royal Oak Inn, now the Toby Carvery and Lodge. The course is preserved as it crosses the Western edge of the park, where the ridge appears very plainly, of a rounded profile, eight or nine yards wide over all, and three to four feet high in the middle. It has been described as presenting one of the best examples of a Roman road, wide with a ditch on each side. It has little claim to be so considered, and the ditches where they occur appear to be connected with modern drainage. To the north of the park, about half-a‚Äëmile through the private residential estate Little Aston Park where it is named Roman Road, a short length of road north of Little Aston, Forge Lane, and another length to the west of Shenstone, mark the course of the road in a straight line from Streetley Hill to high ground , on the north-east of Wall. From near Birmingham to Wall (Letocetum) for nine miles the road is not perceptibly out of a straight line, which may very well have been set out from intermediate points at Streetley Hill, and the high ground , south of the old Royal Oak Inn. Icknield Street would appear to have crossed Watling Street on the east of Letocetum at the point where Ashcroft Lane crosses the A5. There is then a considerable change of direction to the north-east, and a straight course for nine miles to near Barton-under-Needwood. The alignment was sighted from Knowle Farm, as there is a slight bend at this point. Knowle Lane then follows the course of the old road leading into Cricket Lane, Quarry Hills Lane and on to a preservation of the name as Ryknild Street. This in turn leads to Austin Cote Lane, which crosses the Brittania Enterprise Park onto the Old Burton Road, joining the A38 at Streethay. =Lichfield to Derby= A38 between Burton and Derby. The old road is still used, save a few local diversions, from the crossing with the main Birmingham-Lichfield road (A 38(T), to Littleover on the outskirts of Derby and here the highway is very straight and well raised, by two to three feet in places, a fine example of a Roman road still in use. William Stukeley wrote that \\"part of Rigning Way north from Wall was very fair with a high straight bank\\" and that \\"upon the hill south of Littleover, Rigning is under the eye as far as Etocetum, and the hills beyond it.\\"William Stukeley, Iterinarium Boreale, 1776 At Littleover the road turns to the east as the modern A5250, but named Rykneld Street and later Pastures Hill where a section of road has been examined adjacent to Derby High School and Pineview Gardens, 4 km south west of Derventio, the Roman fort at Little Chester. The buried remains of the Roman road are not visible above ground but include drainage features and construction pits flanked by shallow boundary ditches. Plough scars cutting the Roman road surface indicate that in the post-Roman period the site was used for arable land whilst in the 18th century, it formed part of the Birmingham to Derby turnpike but it is also possible that by this time, the main road had been diverted onto its present course at Pastures Hill. Archaeological excavation in 2003 by the Birmingham University Field Archaeology Unit identified the presence of a Bronze Age cremation cemetery in the area between the road and Pastures Hill. A Bronze Age cremation urn was recovered as well as evidence for Iron Age occupation indicating the area may have served as a long lived ritual landscape, including Bronze Age to Roman activity in the Roman road's alignment. It has been suggested that the Bronze Age cremations could have been laid out along the line of a Bronze Age trackway which continued to use into, or was returned to use, during the Roman period. The section of Rykneld Street and the remains of Bronze Age cemetery at Littleover are lawned over and is an island in a development of new houses. The course appears to have been on the west side of Derby passing close to a Roman fort, occupied in 50 AD, at Strutts Park (some finds of pottery from the excavations of the fort are in the collection of Derby Museum). Swan doubts that Ryknild Street went to Strutts Park, which was replaced around 80 AD by the fort at Chester Green on the other side of the River Derwent, the construction of Ryknild Street being contemporary with that of the later fort.Vivien G. Swan, The Pottery Kilns of Roman Britain, London: Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, 1984 Stukeley traced the track of the wall at Chester Green all round enclosing an area, according to his plan, 120 paces from east to west, and 100 paces from north to south, the foundation of the bridge he said could be felt with a staff.William Stukeley, Itinerarium Curiosum, p54, Pl. 86. and Bishop Bennet in 1817 said that the piers of the bridge could be felt in a dry summer. =Derby to Chesterfield= Moor Road near Breadsall. From Little Chester to the countryside north of Derby, the route has not been determined. It is certain that a road left Derventio to the east which led to Sawley on the River Trent, Icknield Street branching from this to the North East. The course is well marked beyond Breadsall, one and a half miles from Little Chester, but the intervening length has not yet been ascertained, however, there is a Ryknield Hill in Denby, which may be part of the route.

IBM announced the System/38 in 1978. The System/38 has 48-bit addressing, which was unique for the time, and a novel integrated database system. It was oriented toward a multi-user system environment. At the time, the typical system handled from a dozen to several dozen terminals. History The System/38 was introduced on October 24, 1978 and delivered in 1980. Developed under the code-name \\"Pacific\\", it was made commercially available in August 1979. The system offered a number of innovative features, and was the brainchild of Frank Soltis and Glenn Henry. It had been developed over eight years by IBM's laboratory in Rochester, Minnesota. The president of IBM's General Systems Division (GSD) said at the time: \\"The System/38 is the largest program we've ever introduced in GSD and it is one of the top three or four largest programs ever introduced in IBM.\\" The System/38 was nearly called the System/380, and the AS/400 was nearly called the System/40. The system was designed as a follow-on for the System/3, but it is not compatible with those computers. The predecessors to the System/38 include the System/3 (1969), System/32 (1975), and System/34 (1977). In 1983 the System/36 was released as a low-end business computer for users who found the System/38 too expensive for their needs. The System/38 was succeeded by the AS/400 midrange computer family in 1988. The AS/400 was designed for OS/400 (today's IBM i). Later, the AS/400 line switched from its earlier System/38-like processors to PowerPC- based processors. It subsequently merged with the IBM RS/6000 family, designed to run AIX, into a single family of server computers‚Äìthe IBM Power Systems, capable of running either IBM i, AIX, or Linux. Hardware characteristics Two hard disks The IBM 5381 System Unit contains processor, main memory, disk storage, a diskette magazine drive, and a system console with keyboard and a display. 5381 was available in Model 100 and Model 200. The IBM 5382 System Unit is physically identical to 5381, but with more powerful processors, more memory, and more disk storage. 5382 was available in Models 300, 400, 500, 600, and 700. In hindsight, the System/38's architecture was probably too demanding of the hardware of the era. When first launched, it struggled under the overhead of the software and operating system, which consumed almost 60 MB on disk, a vast sum at the time, leading some wags to suggest that the pre- announce code name for the series, PACIFIC, was actually an acronym meaning \\"Performance Ain't Critical If Function Is Complete.\\" =Processing unit= The system includes a central processing unit with 512K, 768K, 1024K, 1280K, or 1536K bytes of main storage, It includes a memory management unit supporting demand paging, used by the system software to implement a single- level store architecture. =System console keyboard/display= IBM System/38 console The System/38 console incorporates a keyboard and a display screen with 16 lines of 64 characters, inconsistent with the locally attached 5250 terminals, which are either 12x40 or 24x80, depending on model. The keyboard is available to the system operator to enter Control Language commands. =Diskette magazine drive= The diskette magazine drive is standard on all models. Control Program Facility The operating system of the System/38 is called CPF, for \\"Control Program Facility\\". CPF is not related to SSP, the operating system of the IBM System/34 and System/36. CPF objects are files, programs, message queues, user profiles, and libraries. The System/38 also has the distinction of being the first commercially available IBM Midrange computer to have a database management system (DBMS) integrated into the operating system. The operational control language of the System/38 is called CL, for \\"Control Language\\". CL programs, similar in concept to shell scripts, can be compiled and executed natively. The System/38 was designed with security built in as part of its architecture. Each object or library can have access controlled on a user-by-user basis. This has been continued and expanded throughout the AS/400 and iSeries computer lines. Technology independence The System/38 and its descendants are the only commercial computers ever to use a machine interface architecture to isolate the application software and most of the operating system from hardware dependencies, including such details as address size and register size. Compilers for System/38 and its successors generate code in a high-level instruction set (originally called MI for \\"Machine Interface\\", and renamed TIMI for \\"Technology Independent Machine Interface\\" for AS/400). MI/TIMI is a virtual instruction set; it is not the instruction set of the underlying CPU. Unlike some other virtual-machine architectures in which the virtual instructions are interpreted at runtime (see P-code machine), MI/TIMI instructions are never interpreted. They constitute an intermediate compile time step and are translated into the processor's instruction set as the final compilation step. The MI/TIMI instructions are stored within the final program object, in addition to the executable machine instructions. If a program is moved from a processor with one native instruction set to a processor with another native instruction set, the MI/TIMI instructions will be re-translated into the native instruction set of the new machine before the program is executed for the first time on the new machine. As a result, it is possible for a program originally developed on a System/38 to run on current IBM i hardware without ever being recompiled. This capability allowed the AS/400 to migrate from CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) to RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) in the 1990s. If the MI/TIMI instructions existed in a compiled program, a relatively simple re-translation created a new program native to the new hardware. Distributed Data Management In 1986, System/38 announced support for Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM). Such a middleware in the context of a distributed system is the software layer that lies between the operating system and applications. Distributed Data Management Architecture defines an environment for sharing data. This enables System/38 programs to create, manage, and access record-oriented files on remote System/36, System/38, and IBM mainframe systems running CICS. It also allows programs on remote System/36 and System/38 computers to create, manage, and access files of a System/38. Programming languages Languages supported on the System/38 included RPG III, COBOL, BASIC, and PL/I. Software Decades later, the same software, originally dismissed by some critics as a momentary aberration, runs better than ever on many thousands of modern iSeries and IBM/i systems within commercial and government enterprises of all types and sizes. Successor system The System/38 was superseded by the AS/400 (which also supported System/36 data & programs, to a fairly large extent, with some exceptions). The AS/400 is primarily a re-marketing of the System/38, with some updates to the operating system, including the luxurious non-trivial expansion of source and object names from 8 to a new 10 characters maximum. S/38 programs with 'observability' intact, that is source code embedded within the compiled binary executive at the expense of larger compiled object sizes, can still run on the AS/400 and successor systems as the restore option incorporates a recompile for the then back-version source. However, most proprietary vendor application libraries of objects were compiled without such 'observability' and require original vendor replacement and consequent expense when upgrading to an AS/400. Pricing at the time was tiered, the same exact software, but priced based upon the model, its speed and capacity, of the system to be installed upon. Sales IBM sold an estimated 20,000 System/38s within the first five years of availability, according to articles published in industry magazines NEWS 34/38 and Midrange Computing. Although billed as a minicomputer, the S/38 was much more expensive than IBM's established best-selling System/34, and its replacement, the System/36. Of equal importance was the difficulty of upgrading from, say, a System/34 to a S/38. Although the machines have some similarities, such as twinax peripherals and RPG programming languages, in reality they are very different. IBM tacitly acknowledged this by bringing out the System/36 ‚Äì an upgraded System/34 ‚Äì after the launch of the S/38. In the marketplace, IBM thus found itself with three overlapping, but incompatible, ranges. The System/34/36, the System/38 and the mainframe /360 architecture (that the System/38 was originally designed to replace). Digital Equipment Corporation, at that time one of IBM's main competitors, was able to exploit this by offering a wide range of products based on a single architecture. IBM's counter to this, the 9370 or 'baby mainframe', was a commercial failure.

The conflict, near the conclusion of the New Zealand wars, was a revival of hostilities of the Second Taranaki War as Riwha Tƒ´tokowaru, chief of the NgƒÅti Ruanui's Ngaruahine hapu (sub-tribe), responded to the continued surveying and settlement of confiscated land with well-planned and effective attacks on settlers and government troops in an effort to block the occupation of MƒÅori land. The war, coinciding with a violent raid on a European settlement on the East Coast by fugitive guerrilla fighter Te Kooti, shattered what European colonists regarded as a new era of peace and prosperity, creating fears of a \\"general uprising of hostile MƒÅoris\\",David Morris, Speaker of the House of Representatives, March 1869, as cited by Belich. but once Tƒ´tokowaru was defeated and the East Coast threat minimised, the alienation of MƒÅori land, as well as the political subjugation of MƒÅori, continued at an even more rapid pace.Ranginui Walker, Ka Whawhai Tonu Matou -- Struggle Without End, chapter 8. Penguin Books, 1990. Tƒ´tokowaru, who had fought in the Second Taranaki War, was a most skilful West Coast MƒÅori warrior. He also assumed the roles of a priest and prophet of the extremist Hauhau movement of the Pai MƒÅrire religion, reviving ancient rites of cannibalism and propitiation of MƒÅori gods with the human heart torn from the first slain in a battle.James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 20, 1922 at New Zealand Electronic Text Centre Although Tƒ´tokowaru's forces were numerically small and initially outnumbered in battle 12 to one by government troops, the ferocity of their attacks provoked fear among settlers and prompted the resignation and desertion of many militia volunteers, ultimately leading to the withdrawal of most government military forces from South Taranaki and giving Tƒ´tokowaru control of almost all the territory between New Plymouth and Wanganui. Tƒ´tokowaru provided the strategy and leadership that had been missing among tribes that had fought in the Second Taranaki War. His forces never lost a battle during their intensive campaign, but abandoned their resistance after being pursued into their headquarters in the swamps of Ngaere by Colonel George Stoddart Whitmore, commander of the colonial forces, on 24 March 1869, although Tƒ´tokowaru himself managed to escape.James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 29, 1922 at New Zealand Electronic Text Centre Tƒ´tokowaru's apparent invincibility created a security crisis in 1868, with the government fearing attacks on Wanganui and Manawatu. Yet according to historian James Belich, his achievements were gradually watered down to the point where his name was erased from the most widely read New Zealand histories. Belich concluded: \\"As a result, the military crisis of which he was the principal architect - perhaps the greatest threat to European dominance in the history of New Zealand - has all but disappeared from the received version.\\" Cause and background of the war The immediate cause of the war was the confiscation of vast areas of MƒÅori land in Taranaki by the Government under the powers of the punitive New Zealand Settlements Act 1863. Surveying and settling of the confiscated land had begun in 1865 and MƒÅori, weakened and intimidated by the bush-scouring campaigns of Major Thomas McDonnell and Major-General Trevor Chute in 1865‚Äì66, had accepted the loss of their land. Tƒ´tokowaru declared 1867 to be a year of peace and reconciliation and travelled among local tribes urging them to accept that the war was over. By mid-1868 colonists assumed the New Zealand wars were over and they were about to enter a long-awaited period of rapid progress. But as settlers continued to move into the confiscated areas in early 1868, taking possession of greater areas of farmland, tribes faced the option of fighting to retain their cultivable land or starving. Tƒ´tokowaru, in response, began to mount campaigns of non-violent resistance to halt further incursions by white settlers. Members of his hapu removed survey equipment and destroyed fences and huts, then began harassing South Taranaki settlers with minor thefts of stock and property to persuade them to leave. On 9 June 1868,Cowan, in the cited reference, gives the date of 19 June. NgƒÅti Ruanui warriors escalated their campaign, shooting and tomahawking three settlers felling and sawing timber on the east side of the Waingongoro River, between Hawera and Manaia. Soon after, a member of the Armed Constabulary, the colonial regular army, was shot and mutilated by tomahawk near the Waihi Redoubt (at present-day Normanby). The upper part of his body was taken by Hauhau warriors to Te Ngutu o Te Manu, a village 16 km north of Hawera, where it was cooked and eaten. Tƒ´tokowaru issued a letter threatening that other pƒÅkehƒÅ intruders on the land would also be killed and eaten, warning: \\"I have begun to eat the flesh of the white man . . . My throat is continually open for the eating of human flesh by day and night.\\" The 9 June killings signalled a resumption of war and McDonnell was recalled from Wanganui. He gained approval from the Defence Minister, Colonel Theodore Haultain, to enlist 400 men, including 100 Wanganui MƒÅori, for three months' service. The companies were hastily drilled for the campaign and the garrison at Waihi reinforced by Rifle Volunteers from Wellington. Engagements =Turuturu-Mokai Redoubt= Major Thomas McDonnellTƒ´tokowaru's first major clash with the colonial forces occurred on 12 July 1868 and, in a portent of things to come, it proved disastrous for his enemy. In a move Belich claims was designed to provoke McDonnell and lure him to a battle at a place of Tƒ´tokowaru's choosing, 60 warriors from the Ngaruahine hapu, along with Imperial Army deserter Charles Kane, launched a pre-dawn raid on the dilapidated Turuturu-Mokai Redoubt, 2.5 km north of Hawera and 5 km from the main army camp at Waihi Redoubt, killing 10 and wounding six of the 25 Armed Constabulary garrisoned there. Tƒ´tokowaru remained at Te Ngutu o Te Manu during the battle. The redoubt was small, about 20 metres square, built on low ground and was protected by crumbling parapets only 1.5 metres high and a trench 1.8m deep.James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 21, 1922 The hearts of two of the Constabulary soldiers were cut from their bodies by MƒÅori warriors, prompting McDonnell to make the dramatic gesture of kissing the blade of his sword and vowing, \\"I shall have revenge for this.\\" =Te Ngutu o Te Manu= The Battle of Te Ngutu o Te Manu, Taranaki, 1868, by J. McDonald.On 21 August McDonnell crossed the flooded Waingongoro River with a column of 350 men to retaliate against Tƒ´tokowaru. His force comprised three divisions of Armed Constabulary, Wellington Rangers, Wellington Rifles, Taranaki Volunteer Militia, Patea Yeomanry Cavalry and a number of unenlisted volunteers. McDonnell marched through dense rata forest to reach Te Ngutu o Te Manu, which he had last visited in May and was surprised to find a new palisade in front of the village. He split his force into two sections to storm the palisade from the front and circle it from the left to enter near the rear. The raid was a modest success, with his troops capturing weapons and ammunition and burning part of the village, most of whose inhabitants were out hunting for food. McDonnell's troops were forced to retreat under heavy fire as MƒÅori returned, regrouped in the bush and pursued them to the Waingongoro River. McDonnell's casualties were four men killed and eight wounded.James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 22, 1922 Less than three weeks later, on 7 September 1868, McDonnell returned to the NgƒÅti Ruanui heartland, this time determined to skirt Te Ngutu o Te Manu and first strike at another village to the east, Ruaruru, before returning to Te Ngutu. The plan went awry when his column of 360 men became disoriented in the forest, missing Ruaruru and approaching Te Ngutu from the north. Shots fired at the occupants of outlying huts warned Tƒ´tokowaru of the direction of McDonnell's approach, giving the chief time to organise his defence. He remained in the pƒÅ with 20 men and sent the remaining 40, in small groups, to hidden rifle pits in bush surrounding a clearing that led to the palisade, and possibly other positions within the clearing itself. McDonnell's force, attempting to storm the palisade, came under immediate and very heavy fire from front, right and rear, with troops \\"being knocked over like ninepins\\" by unseen marksmen. Again the heart of the first soldier killed was cut from his body as a Hauhau war rite.James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 23, 1922 McDonnell hesitated, torn between advancing with further losses or retreating, watching as the inexperienced volunteer recruits from the Wellington Rangers and Rifles either bunched together and froze or panicked and fled. McDonnell then gave the order to retreat, with casualties carried out first and McDonnell following with 80 men. Major Gustavus von Tempsky, near the palisade, was shot dead while awaiting orders, and four other officers - two captains and two lieutenants - were also killed. Tƒ´tokowaru's small attacking force was quickly reinforced by warriors from neighboring villages and McDonnell's retreat to Waihi came under relentless fire from MƒÅori who followed them almost to the Waingongoro, inflicting further casualties. The expedition left 24 Europeans killed and 26 wounded. Te Ngutu o Te Manu was a shattering defeat for the Europeans, on a similar magnitude to the Battle of Puketakuere during the First Taranaki War. Contemporary writers described the loss as \\"the most serious and complete defeat ever experienced by the colonial forces\\" and \\"the most disastrous affair that ever took place in New Zealand\\". Von Tempsky's death came as a shock to his military followers and to his wider audience of admirers throughout New Zealand. In the minds of the PƒÅkeha public, von Tempsky was a dashing hero of the New Zealand wars, whose fearlessness and ability to survive near-misses gave him an aura of invincibility. One newspaper correspondent wrote: \\"Unless something is done and done quickly we had all better clear out.\\" The aftermath of the defeat was even more disastrous as it led to a disintegration of the Government forces. Hundreds deserted or refused to re-enlist for further service. Many kupapa (so-called \\"friendly\\" MƒÅori) returned home and Von Tempsky's Forest Rangers mutinied. The Government was forced to abandon its Waihi and Manawapou camps, as well as the Kakaramea redoubtJames Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 26, 1922 and withdraw to Patea, which prompted colonists to leave their farms and redoubts and retreat to the safety of Wanganui. The abandoned colonist sites were quickly occupied by Ngaruahine warriors. =Moturoa= In September 1868 Tƒ´tokowaru, who had until then been fighting only with his own hapu, gained the support of the Pakakohe, Tangahoe and Ngarauru hapu, more than doubling his strength to between 150 and 200. In early October his force marched south and built a pƒÅ at Otoia, just northeast of Patea and busied themselves with repairing weapons, gathering food and ammunition and planting crops. Further raids were carried out on settlers between Patea and the Waitotara River in a bid to bait the Government to fight them at their pƒÅ, without success. Col. George Stoddart WhitmoreMcDonnell resigned as commander and was replaced in September by Colonel George S. Whitmore, who had carried out the first operations against Te Kooti on the East Coast. In early November Whitmore moved his field headquarters to Wairoa (modern-day Waverley) after learning Tƒ´tokowaru had moved south of him and established a camp at Moturoa, about 5 km inland of Wairoa, from where it was feared he would attack the rich farming area of Waitotara. On 6 November Whitmore's force was boosted by the arrival of 100 men of a newly raised company of the Armed Constabulary, No.6 Division, commanded by Captain J. M. Roberts, who had fought at Te Ngutu. At midnight that night an attacking column of 550, including 300 Wanganui kupapa, picked their way from Wairoa toward Moturoa. Two hundred of the kupapa refused to enter the bush and the remaining force arrived at the pƒÅ before daylight. Map of the Battle of Moturoa, 1868.The MƒÅori camp had been established just four days earlier, in hilly, bush-covered country below the high wooded tableland of Okutuku, a village that had been raided in January 1866 as part of a \\"bush-scouring\\" campaign by Major-General Trevor Chute during the earlier hostilities. About 100 metres of 3.6m-high loose palisading had been hastily erected in a concave shape, blocking the path to the pƒÅ, while other defensive works included a long trench 2m wide and 2m deep behind the palisade, as well as hidden rifle pits and three taumaihi, 6m-high towers built of packed soil and ferns. While men in the trenches could fire through a gap beneath the palings of the palisade, others on an earth bank behind the trenches could fire through gaps in the palings, while a third line of fire could be effected from the taumaihi. Tƒ´tokowaru had placed his men on high alert and in the misty dawn, sentries caught sight of Whitmore's advance guard moving through the bush. The Moturoa defenders were silently roused and took their firing positions without being seen by the attacking force. Whitmore ordered No.1 Division of the Armed Constabulary and a contingent of Wanganui kupapa under Major Kepa Te Rangihiwinui to move around to the right of the pƒÅ to attack the flank while the main body assaulted the front, supported by the newly arrived No.6 Division. Entry from the left was prevented by a steep and thickly forested gully at the western end of the palisade. The signal for the assault was given and Hunter rushed for the palisades with a storming party of 50 Armed Constabulary. Tƒ´tokowaru's men waited until Hunter's men were within 10 or 12 metres before opening fire. One survivor said: \\"I never saw the like of that sheet of fire. Men went down all round me.\\" Within minutes a dozen men were lying dead or wounded on the open ground. Kepa could not reach his assault point on the right flank and returned to help Hunter, who moments later suffered a fatal wound. Whitmore then sounded the bugle to retire, prompting many Moturoa defenders to run from the shelter of the stockade and trenches in pursuit. On the west, or left, flank a small detachment of No.2 Division was left to engage with MƒÅori outside the pƒÅ and was the last group to retreat, coming under heavy fire not only from the pursuers but also from kupapa who believed they were the enemy, so far were they behind the main force. The Moturoa force followed Whitmore's troops all the way to Wairoa, firing on the redoubt before retreating. Whitmore's casualties were recorded as 19 killed or missing and 20 wounded, with the heart of one soldier cut from his body and another later cooked and eaten. Only one of Tƒ´tokowaru's force was killed in the encounter. The battle was regarded as the worst reverse suffered by government troops on the West Coast, surpassing even the Te Ngutu disaster. Colonel W.E. Gudgeon, who described it as \\"the most desperate engagement fought in the MƒÅori War\\", claimed: \\"Whitmore's return did not give nearly our casualties. I made it at the time 52 out of fewer than 200 actually engaged.\\" Whitmore offered his resignation to the Defence Minister, but was given government support and retained. Historian James Cowan described the Moturoa expedition as \\"Whitmore's one great blunder\\", but strong criticisms of Whitmore's strategy were rejected by Belich, who said the commander's one mistake was to underestimate the Moturoa deceptively strong defences. Although he claimed Whitmore had greatly exaggerated the strength of his enemy - reporting Tƒ´tokowaru had as many as 600 warriors at Moturoa - he concluded: \\"Whitmore was simply unfortunate enough to be a good general matched against an excellent one.\\" =Tauranga-Ika= Tauranga-ika PƒÅ, 1869.In the wake of the Moturoa defeat, Whitmore moved his base further south to Nukumaru, forming an entrenched camp ready to defend Wanganui's outlying settlements with a force of 350. Tƒ´tokowaru responded by following him, establishing an elaborate fortification for his 400 warriors at the MƒÅori village of Tauranga-ika close to the Europeans' military base and just 29 km, or a day's march, from Wanganui. The new pƒÅ was sited alongside a road running from Kai-Iwi to the Waitotora River and provided a commanding view to the coast, with impenetrable bush behind it. From his new base he launched a night-long assault on the Weraroa Redoubt, overlooking the Waitotara River. Whitmore promptly abandoned Weraroa, moving its 50 Wanganui militia to join him at Nukumaru. As tensions continued to rise on the West Coast, the country learned of the massacre by fugitive East Coast guerrilla fighter Te Kooti of 50 men, women and children at Poverty Bay on 9/10 November. Defence Minister Haultain immediately ordered Whitmore to withdraw his entire force another 11 km to build a defensive line on the south side of the Kai-Iwi River and transfer some of his force to the East Coast to eradicate Te Kooti's threat. Whitmore convinced Haultain that it would be easier to concentrate first on defeating Te Kooti before returning with a stronger, more disciplined force to successfully act against Tƒ´tokowaru. He sailed from Wanganui for Poverty Bay on 2 December with 212 Armed Constabulary, leaving Wanganui's defence in the hands of about 620 Imperial troops, Armed Constabulary and militia and volunteers. Whitmore remained away from the West Coast for five weeks, during which time the colonial forces at Wanganui swelled to almost 2000 men. Cross-section of firing positions at Tauranga-ika PƒÅ, 1869.Tƒ´tokowaru used those five weeks to demonstrate his hold on the Wanganui hinterland, burning farms and abandoned military posts and driving off stock, but also laboring over the fortifications at Tauranga-ika until it became one of the most formidable modern pƒÅ ever built. The pƒÅ had been built in a diamond shape, 135 metres long on each side, complete with trenches, rifle pits, parapets and a double line of stockade.\\"Titokowaru's Tauranga-ika -pa\\", NZ History website The palisade, attached to 30 cm-thick posts, reached 5m above the ground, with a gap at its base to allow defenders in the trenches to fire beneath it. Inside the pƒÅ were trenches, covered walkways and shellproof underground shelters roofed with strong timbers, packed earth and galvanised roofing iron. At one corner was a 10m-high taumaihi,James Cowan, The New Zealand Wars: A History of the Maori Campaigns and the Pioneering Period: Vol II, Chapter 29, 1922 providing a third level of fire. Inspecting it later, Whitmore said, \\"No troops in the world could have hewn their way through a double row of strong palisades, backed by rifle pits and flanked by two-storey erections, such as are constructed in this fortification, defended by excellent shots and desperate men.\\"Whitmore's Report, 3 February 1869, as cited by Belich. Whitmore returned to Wanganui on 18 January 1869 and immediately began preparing for a major offensive against Tƒ´tokowaru. A week later he set off with 800 Armed Constabulary and Wanganui and Kai-Iwi Mounted Corps, as well as 200 kupapa under Major Kepa, clinging to the coast to avoid the danger of bush ambushes. On 1 February he was at Nukumaru and the force dug itself in 100m away from the stockade. Two Armstrong guns were brought up on 2 February and used to shell the pƒÅ, causing little damage and no casualties. Two Coehorn mortars were used to fire on the pƒÅ the next day in preparation for a possible assault, when a reconnaissance mission by some Armed Constabulary discovered the pƒÅ was empty, its inhabitants - men, women and children - having slipped out through the rear during the night. Tƒ´tokowaru's army immediately began to disperse, with entire hapu splitting from his force. No clear evidence exists why his forces would abandon a fortress so apparently unassailable, or why the chief's support from Taranaki MƒÅori quickly evaporated, though Kimble Bent, who was sheltering with Tƒ´tokowaru's hapu after deserting from the 57th Regiment, told Cowan 50 years later the chief had lost his mana tapu, or sacred power, after committing adultery with the wife of another chief. Whitmore professed no regret that Tauranga-ika had been taken without resistance: \\"My object was to gain possession of the district and if I could do this without loss and without putting too heavy a strain on my raw troops they would be encouraged.\\" Whitmore began pursuing Tƒ´tokowaru, with soldiers offered rewards of ¬£10 for the head of a chief and ¬£5 for the head of any others of his half-starved forces. Straggling warriors were shot and prisoners were decapitated as European troops and k≈´papa competed in the race for blood money, collecting sacks of human heads. Whitmore suffered several casualties from a rearguard defence near the Waitotara River, but caught up with them on 13 March at Otautu, north of Patea, when six colonial soldiers were killed and 12 wounded in an attempted assault on the MƒÅori camp. Eleven days later a group of Tƒ´tokowaru's followers, by now starving and subsisting on foraged food including fungus and grubs, surrendered in a swamp hideout at Ngaere, near modern-day Eltham, while their chief evaded soldiers and settled at Kawau Pa in the Upper Waitara Valley.An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, edited by A. H. McLintock, 1966 The Government abandoned attempts to pursue him further and apart from mopping-up actions to capture his former allies in South Taranaki, the war had come to an end. Although Tƒ´tokowaru had fought the entire war without direct assistance from the MƒÅori King Movement, it is possible the Kingites had attempted to intervene in February 1869 with a raid on the Pukearuhe Redoubt in Taranaki's far north - in which a woman, three children, a missionary and three military settlers were killed - and again in March when a force of Kingite warriors massed at Mokau, reportedly preparing to invade Taranaki. The raid, if planned, did not eventuate and the intervention plans, if they existed, came too late to assist Tƒ´tokowaru.

He was educated at Marist College Ashgrove in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. Early political career Chan first became actively involved in politics in the 1960s. He was elected to represent the Namatanai district of New Ireland province in the pre- independence House of Assembly in 1968 and was re-elected in 1972, 1977, 1982, 1987 and 1992. He was Deputy Prime Minister four times (1976, 1985, 1986, 1992-1994), and Minister of Finance three times (1972‚Äì1977, 1985-1986 and 1992‚Äì1994). He also held the portfolios of Primary Industry (1977‚Äì78) and External Affairs and Trade (1994). Chan became leader of the People's Progress Party in 1970. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1981, and appointed a Privy Counsellor the next year. Prime minister Chan first became prime minister on 11 March 1980, succeeding the country's first prime minister, Michael Somare. He served as prime minister until 2 August 1982, when Somare regained the position. He succeeded Prime Minister Paias Wingti in August 1994 and took office on the dual platform of national security and appropriate economic management. In 1997, the Chan government's multimillion-dollar contract with Sandline International, a mercenary organization, to counter separatist guerrilla warfare on Bougainville caused the Sandline affair, with immense public protests and a 10-day mutiny by the underpaid national army. On 25 March 1997, during an inquiry that started on 21 March that caused five ministers to resign, the Parliament defeated a motion calling on Chan to resign (59-38). However, the next day, Chan and two ministers chose to step down, and John Giheno, a member of Chan‚Äôs party, became acting prime minister a day later. He regained the position on 2 June 1997, shortly before the national elections. Chan was defeated in the national election in June 1997 and was succeeded as prime minister by Bill Skate on 22 July 1997. He remained out of Parliament until winning the New Ireland Provincial seat in the June‚ÄìJuly 2007 election. Later career During the \\"horse trading\\" phase of negotiations following the 2007 election, he was nominated for the position of prime minister, with the backing of Mekere Morauta and Bart Philemon, as an alternative to the large National Alliance grouping which appeared likely to again be led by Somare.

for the 1984 election The Puerto Rican Renewal Party -- or Partido Renovaci√≥n Puertorrique√±a (PRP) in Spanish -- was a short-lived Puerto Rican political party founded on August 28, 1983 in Ponce, Puerto RicoEl Nuevo Dia, August 29, 1983, p.1-2; \\"El Mundo\\", August 29, 1983, p.1; \\"The San Juan Star\\", August 29, 1983, p.1; Nolla-Acosta, Juan Jose \\"Historia de las Elecciones Celebradas en Puerto Rico, 1960-1992\\" The party was disbanded in 1987.http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi- bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&Search;_Arg=Nolla+Acosta&Search;_Code=GKEY%5E*&CNT;=100&hist;=1&type;=quick The party's main leader was then-mayor of San Juan Hern√°n Padilla, a pro- statehood leader and founder of the Partido Nuevo Progresista, PNP. History =Prelude= The PRP traces its origins to the 1980 election in Puerto Rico, when the pro-statehood party (in favor of making Puerto Rico the 51st state of the United States), barely retained the governorship and the Resident Commissioner position, while losing control of the Puerto Rico Senate and the Puerto Rico House of representatives, as well as a majority of the island's 78 municipalities. After what many statehood supporters perceived as a defeat in the 1980 election, a movement started to get the New Progressive Party to nominate a new candidate for the 1984 election. Dr. Hern√°n Padilla's name was the favorite to substitute governor Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ at the top of the NPP's ticket in 1984. However, Governor Romero saw the threat from Padilla and at a party assembly held in Ponce on November 14, 1982, he asked the assembled delegates if there was anyone who dared to challenge him (Romero) for the gubernatorial nomination. He did so three times, looking straight at Padilla, who was sitting at the podium. See \\"El Nuevo Dia,\\" \\"El Mundo,\\" \\"The San Juan Star,\\" \\"El Reportero,\\" and \\"El Vocero\\" (the main newspapers in Puerto Rico at the time), November 15, 1982. Padilla did not answer immediately but some time later announced that he would seek the NPP nomination for governor for the 1984 election. The escalating feud between Padilla and Romero-Barcelo for the NPP nomination can be followed through the newspapers of the time. =Founding= After numerous controversies between Padilla and Romero on how and when to conduct primaries to settle the dispute, and convinced that a fair primary was not possible, Padilla and his followers created the Puerto Rican Renewal Party. Some of the pro-statehood leaders who followed Padilla were: * √Ångel Viera-Mart√≠nez (at-large representative in the Puerto Rico House of Representatives and vice president of the NPP, who ran for Resident Commissioner in 1984); * Luis Batista-Salas (vice-mayor of San Juan, ran for San Juan mayor in 1984); * √Ångel Rivera-Salas (interagency coordinator) * Danny L√≥pez Soto (State Senator from the Carolina District, ran for an at-large seat in the Puerto Rico Senate) * Luis Gonzalo-de Jes√∫s * H√©ctor Mart√≠nez-Col√≥n Although most PRP leaders supported statehood for Puerto Rico, they decided that their new party would seek to include people who supported other status options. The Puerto Rican Renewal Party was formally founded on August 28, 1983 in Ponce, Puerto Rico, just a few meters from where the NPP assembly of Nov. 14, 1982 had taken place. The lack of resources to run an effective campaign and the decision not to become a pro-statehood party doomed the PRP's effort (this is an opinion based on personal observations at the time, there are other reasons that could arguably be determined as causes for the election result). Despite the fact that Padilla was widely respected by the voters, in the end he received just over 4.05% of the vote, below the 5% threshold to keep the party registered. The gubernatorial vote in 1984 was: Rafael Hern√°ndez Col√≥n PDP (PPD) 822,709 (47.754%) Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ NPP (PNP) 768,959 (44.634%) Hern√°n Padilla PRP (PRP) 69,807 ( 4.051%) Fernando Martin PIP (PIP) 61,312 ( 3.558%) (Source: State Elections Commission of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Comision Estatal de Elecciones del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico); Estadisticas de las Elecciones de 1984 (Statistics of the 1984 election [in Spanish]) The Puerto Rican Renewal Party attempted to register again for the 1988 election but the effort failed for lack of support, and Padilla returned to the NPP in the Summer of 1988.

After the 1984 election, Padilla moved to Maryland with his family, and served in several hospitals there, reaching high positions in the medical field. He currently lives in the state of Florida.

It is one of two border crossings between Kyrgyzstan and China, the other being Irkeshtam, some 165 km (103 mi) to the southwest. The scenic Lake of Chatyr-Kul lies near the pass on the Kyrgyz side. The road to Naryn and then to Balykshy and Bishkek--stretching for some --is narrow and in winter often impassable due to heavy snowfall and frequent avalanches. On the Chinese side, the Torugart Port of Entry (ÂêêÂ∞îÂ∞ïÁâπÂè£Â≤∏), where travelers must clear for customs, is located about from the pass itself in Ulugqat County of the Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture. Distances from the pass to major cities are: to Ulugqat, to Kashgar, to Artux and some to Urumqi. History The pass was used since antiquity. During the Han dynasty it was under the jurisdiction of a micro-state called Juandu (). During the Tang dynasty, the region came under Tang control as part of Anxi Protectorate The pass is open to all nationalities but clearance requires careful arrangement of transportation. A China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway going through Torugard Pass has been in the works that would connect Kashgar and the Ferghana Valley since 2012. However, the Kyrgyz section of the rail has been stalled due to financial and technical issues.

He is known for his satirical lyrics. Uggla was born in Stockholm. He was the lead singer of the hard rock band JUSO (later renamed Alexander Lucas) before going solo in the early 1970s. Their influences were Black Sabbath, The Groundhogs and Alice Cooper, among others. Uggla's first two glam- and art rock-inspired albums Om Bobbo Viking and Livets teaterÀà didn't sell well, the first only about 500 copies in Sweden and Livets teater even less. But his departure from glam rock with the punk and hard rock inspired Va ska man ta livet av sig f√∂r n√§r man √§nd√• inte f√•r h√∂ra snacket efter√•t gained him much popularity and the album sold about 150 000 copies. In the 1970s, several music magazines gave Magnus the name \\"The Swedish Ian Hunter\\". In 1979, he was one of the members in Magnus Uggla Band. Povel Ramel awarded him the Karamelodiktstipendiet in 1991. Uggla's solo influences includes Karl Gerhard, David Bowie, The Clash, Marc Bolan, Wendy Carlos and Mott the Hoople. In an interview with Aftonbladet, Uggla said that The Clash \\"was a really good band\\" and also created the song \\"Du ska va' glad\\" after he saw them perform at Gr√∂na Lund.  Personal life  Uggla is married to Louise Uggla since 1990, with whom he has one son and a daughter together with. He also has a daughter from an earlier relationship. Uggla is diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). He decided to do a psychiatric assessment for ADHD as an adult after one of his children had been diagnosed. In popular culture *Uggla participated in the fourth semi-final of Melodifestivalen 2007 with the song \\"F√∂r kung och fosterland\\", competing for the opportunity to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest in Helsinki, Finland. On February 24, 2007, Uggla performed his song, and advanced to the Second Chance round the following Saturday, where he lost to Sonja Ald√©n in the last round of voting. Earlier that week, he had received complaints about the lyrics of the song which contain a line that could be interpreted as degrading to Polish people, but the Swedish Chancellor of Justice decided not to try this as a violation of the hate speech act. *Plastic Bertrand has recorded a French version of Uggla's song \\"Vittring\\". It's called \\"Rock'n'Roll je te hais\\" and is found on Bertrand's LP L'Album.

Musketeers were an important part of early modern armies, particularly in Europe, as they normally comprised the majority of their infantry. The musketeer was a precursor to the rifleman. Muskets were replaced by rifles in most western armies during the mid-1850s. The traditional designation of \\"musketeer\\" for an infantry private survived in the Imperial German Army until World War I. Asia Mughal infantryman. =China= Musketeers in China from the Ming dynasty. The hand cannon was invented in China in the 12th century and was in widespread use there in the 13th century. It spread westward across Asia during the 14th century. Arquebusiers and musketeers were utilized in the armies of the Ming (1368‚Äì1644)Chase 2003, p. 141. and Qing dynasties (1644‚Äì1911). Zhao Shizhen's book of 1598 AD, the Shenqipu, contains illustrations of Ottoman Turkish and European musketeers together with detailed diagrams of their muskets.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 447‚Äì454. There was also an illustration and description of how the Chinese had adopted the Ottoman kneeling position when firing, while favoring the use of European-made muskets.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 449‚Äì452. The Chinese also built the first repeating fire-arm: several barrels behind a small wooden shield. The musketeer would turn these barrels lighting each barrel with a slow match one by one. These weapons were most effective when fired from walls or high positions. Needham considered this weapon to be a \\"primitive machine-gun\\". =India= Muskets became an integral part of Indian warfare in the 1600s. They were used as an effective defense against war elephants. The Mughals, Marathas, Rajputs and Sikhs made use of musketeers, firing from cover, to ambush opposing infantry, cavalry and elephants. Many Indian gunsmiths existed during the 17th and 18th centuries, creating matchlock muskets for the Mughal infantry plus some combination weapons. Europe =Spain= A tercio musketeer c. 1650 In the Spanish army, the tercio or the Spanish square was a mixed infantry formation that theoretically could number up to 3,000 pikemen, swordsmen and musketeers; although, on the battlefield, it was usually much smaller. It was effective in its era, capitalizing on the close-quarter impact of the pike combined with the long-range projectile capabilities of the musket. It resembled a loosely formed phalanx in function, but was far more flexible and deadly. The musketeers of the tercios were developed from the earlier arquebusier manned coronel√≠as, who had established their reputation by defeating the French and capturing their king at the Battle of Pavia in 1525. =France= Uniforms of Musketeers of the Guard, 1660‚Äì1814 The Musketeers of the Guard were a junior unit, initially of roughly company strength, of the military branch of the Royal Household or Maison du Roi. They were created in 1622 when Louis XIII furnished a company of light cavalry (the \\"carabiniers\\", created by Louis' father Henry IV) with muskets. Musketeers fought in battle both on foot as infantry and on horseback as dragoons. At the Battle of Fontenoy in 1745 the King's Musketeers served as regular cavalry, charging British infantry with drawn swords. As one of the junior units in the Royal Guard, the Musketeers were not closely linked to the royal family. Traditional bodyguard duties were in fact performed by the Garde du Corps and the Cent- suisses. Because of its later establishment, the Musketeers were open to the lower classes of French nobility or younger sons from noble families whose oldest sons served in the more prestigious Garde du Corps and Chevau-legers (Light Horse). The Musketeers, many of them still teenagers, soon gained a reputation for unruly behaviour and fighting spirit. Their high esprit de corps gained royal favor for the Musketeers and they were frequently seen at court and in Paris. Shortly after their creation, Cardinal Richelieu created a bodyguard unit for himself. So as not to offend the King with a perceived sense of self-importance, Richelieu did not name them Garde du Corps like the King's personal guards but rather Musketeers after the Kings' junior guard cavalry. This was the start of a bitter rivalry between the two corps of Musketeers. At the cardinal's death in 1642, the company passed to his successor Cardinal Mazarin. At Mazarin's death in 1661, the cardinal's Musketeers passed to Louis XIV to the disgust of both the King's Musketeers and the Cardinal's Musketeers. The Musketeers were subsequently reorganized as a guard cavalry regiment of two companies. The King's Musketeers became the first company, popularly known as \\"Grey Musketeers\\" (mousquetaires gris), while the Cardinal's Musketeers became the second company, known as \\"Black Musketeers\\" (mousquetaires noirs) for riding grey and black horses, respectively. From their establishment, the Musketeers wore blue cloak-like cassocks, lined with red and edged with silver embroidery. From 1688, the cassocks were replaced by smaller soubrevestes or sleeveless coats in the same colours. In the early decades of the corps, the musketeers had worn civilian dress under their cassocks, according to personal taste and means, but in 1677 a scarlet uniform was adopted. D'Artagnan's monument in Paris In terms of recruitment, the Musketeers were among the most sought after of the military companies of the Ancien R√©gime. This was due to the lower entrance requirements. The senior guard units were in effect closed to all but the most senior and wealthy of French nobles, so for the majority of French nobles (many of whom lived in genteel poverty), service in the Musketeers was the only way to join a mounted unit in the Royal Household and perhaps catch the King's eye. However, enlistment did require both letters of recommendation and evidence that a recruit had the family means to support the costs of service. These included the provision of horses, swords, clothing, a servant and equipment. Only the musket, the sleeveless soubreveste and the distinctive blue cassock were provided by the monarch. In 1776, the Musketeers were disbanded by Louis XVI, for budgetary reasons. Following the first Bourbon Restoration, the Musketeers were reestablished on 6 July 1814 along with the other military units of the former Royal Household. These expensive and aristocratic regiments proved ineffective when Napoleon returned from Elba, mostly dispersing though some accompanied Louis XVIII into brief exile. Following the second restoration of the Monarchy, the Musketeers were finally disbanded on 31 December 1815. Decades later, starting in 1844, this group was the subject of the now-famous serial publication The Three Musketeers, in the magazine Le Si√®cle between March and July 1844. The author, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re, based his work on the book M√©moires de Monsieur d'Artagnan, capitaine lieutenant de la premi√®re compagnie des Mousquetaires du Roi (Memoirs of Mister d'Artagnan, lieutenant captain of the first company of the King's Musketeers) by Gatien de Courtilz de Sandras (Cologne, 1700). =Sweden= Thanks to the reforms of Gustav II Adolf, the Swedish Army brought to maturity the new style of fighting that made Sweden into a great power in the 17th century. This style of fighting became the new standard throughout Europe and its colonies in the latter stages of musket dominated warfare. Manuals based on Gustav's own revolutionised the training and tactics of western armies. =Britain= A heraldic supporter: a musketeer of the Honourable Artillery Company, in sand, 19th century The iconic \\"Redcoat\\" of the British Empire was the staple unit in the British armies that created the largest empire in history. The British infantryman was equipped with the .75 calibre Land Pattern Musket, or Brown Bess. He was well trained by the standards of the time, training with live ammunition. A fully trained redcoat could fire four times a minute. This, combined with the technique of firing by companies (a method wherein blocks of men fired smaller volleys in succession, creating a wave of fire down the front of the regiment), made it possible for the British musketeer to win pitched battles against superior numbers. The term \\"musketeer\\" was rarely used in the titles of regiments. Examples include the 106th Regiment of Foot (Black Musqueteers), the 110th Regiment of Foot (Queen's Royal Musqueteers) and the 112th Regiment of Foot (King's Royal Musqueteers), all raised and disbanded in the 1760s. The musket was withdrawn from service with the British Army in 1854, replaced by the muzzle-loading Mini√© rifle, which had an accurate range of over three times that of the Brown Bess which it replaced.R. M. Barnes, page 95 A History of the Regiments & Uniforms of the British Army, Sphere Books 1972 Eurasia =Ottoman Empire= An illustration of Janissaries. The famous Janissary corps of the Ottoman army were using matchlock muskets as early as the 1440s. The Ottoman Empire, centering on Turkey and extending into Balkans, Arabia and North Africa used muskets to conquer Constantinople (modern Istanbul) and were one of the earliest users of muskets in a military conflict. It also utilized large cannons, most notoriously the Great Turkish Bombard. They are also probably the first to use muskets aboard ships. =Russia= Streltsy () were the units of Russian guardsmen (sl. strelets, —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–µ—Ü. literally \\"shooter\\"; often translated as \\"musketeer\\", but more properly \\"harquebuses\\") from the 16th to the early 18th centuries, armed with firearms and halberds. They are also collectively known as Strelets Troops (–°—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–µ—Ü–∫–æ–µ –í–æ–π—Å–∫–æ). Streltsy in 1674 The first streltsy units were created by Ivan the Terrible sometime between 1545 and 1550 and armed with the arquebus. They first saw combat at the Siege of Kazan in 1552. Military service in this unit became lifelong and hereditary. The bearded strelsty were organized into regiments, each with a long coat (kaftans) and pointed cloth hat of a distinctive colour. By 1680, there were 20 regiments of Moscow streltsy totaling 20,048 men and comprising about 12 per cent of the total army (along with cossacks, militia and an increasing number of regular soldiers). In addition, there were significant numbers of frontier and garrison streltsy serving outside Moscow, although these were less formally drilled and equipped. The Muscovite government was chronically short of cash so that the streltsy were often not paid well. While \\"entitled\\" to something like four rubles a year in the 1550s, they were often allowed to farm or trade in order to supplement their incomes. Textiles for clothing and foodstuffs were sometimes issued as part of their pay. A commander of one hundred musketeers (sotnik) received up to 20 roubles a year and a regimental head (streletski golova) between 30 and 60. In the late 17th century, the Streltsy of Moscow began to actively participate in a struggle for power between different government groups, supporting dissidents and showing hostility towards any foreign innovations. After the fall of Sophia Alekseyevna in 1689, the government of Peter the Great engaged in a process of gradual limitation of the streltsy's military and political influence. In order to counter their power, Peter began to raise a new regular army, still armed with muskets but disciplined, uniformed and organised along West European lines. In spite of these measures, the streltsy revolted yet again while Peter was on his Great Embassy in Europe. The four regiments involved were disbanded and 1,200 of the mutineers were executed. The remainder were exiled, had their property confiscated and were banned from future military employment. The entire corps was technically abolished in 1689; however, after having suffered a defeat at Narva in 1700, the government retained some streltsy units in service. Gradually, the streltsy were incorporated into the regular army. At the same time, the Tsarist government started to disband the Municipal Streltsy. Liquidation of the last streltsy units (by then social rather than military groups) was finally completed by 1728. The Preobrazhensky and Semenovsky regiments of the Imperial Guard replaced the streltsy as the political and military force closest to the tsar.

A member of the prominent Biddle family of Philadelphia, Nicholas Biddle worked for prominent officials such as John Armstrong Jr. and James Monroe in his youth. After returning to Philadelphia, he won election to the state legislature. While serving in the legislature, he successfully lobbied Congress and President Monroe for the creation of a new central bank, which became known as the Second Bank of the United States. In 1822, Monroe appointed Biddle as the third president of the bank. Biddle would continue to serve as the bank's president for several years, during which time he exercised power over the nation's money supply and interest rates, seeking to prevent economic crises. At the request of Henry Clay and other Whigs, Biddle asked Democratic President Andrew Jackson to renew the bank's federal charter in 1832. Jackson, who held a deep hostility to many banks, declined to renew the charter, beginning a political debate known as the Bank War. When Jackson transferred the federal government's deposits to several state banks, Biddle raised interest rates, causing a mild economic recession. The federal charter expired in 1836, but the bank was re-chartered by Pennsylvania. Biddle continued to serve as president of the bank until 1839. Ancestry and early life Nicholas Biddle was born in Philadelphia, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on January 8, 1786 into a prominent family. Ancestors of the Biddle family immigrated to Pennsylvania when the proprietor, William Penn (of the Religious Society of Friends, or \\"Quakers\\") visited,Lawmaking and Legislators in Pennsylvania, vol. 3, p. 338 and fought in the pre-Revolutionary colonial struggles. His father, Charles, was prominent in his devotion to the cause of American independence and served as Vice-President of the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania, alongside Council President, the famous Benjamin Franklin (1705/06‚Äì1790). His paternal uncle and namesake Nicholas Biddle (1750‚Äì1778), whose residence was also in Philadelphia, was an early colonial and American Revolutionary War naval hero, who died during the rebellion. Another uncle, Edward Biddle, was also a member of the First Continental Congress of 1774.Lawmaking and Legislators in Pennsylvania, vol. 3, pp. 337‚Äì351 Young Nicholas's preparatory education was received at an academy in Philadelphia, where his progress was so rapid that he entered the class of 1799 in the University of Pennsylvania (formerly the \\"Academy\\", then the \\"College of Philadelphia\\" until 1791), and would have taken his degree at the age of thirteen had it not been deemed wise to keep him longer at his books. He was accordingly sent to Princeton (then the ‚ÄúCollege of New Jersey‚Äù), entered the sophomore class, and was graduated in 1801 as valedictorian, dividing the first honor of the class with his only rival. His younger brother Thomas Biddle, a hero of the War of 1812 who died in a duel, should not be confused with his cousin by the same name, who became a leading exchange broker in Philadelphia. Biddle was offered an official position before he had even finished his law studies. As secretary to John Armstrong Jr. (a Revolutionary War officer, delegate to the Continental Congress, later a U.S. Senator, United States minister to France, and Secretary of War under fourth President James Madison during the War of 1812), he went abroad in 1804 and was in Paris in the new French Empire at the time of Napoleon Bonaparte's coronation. Afterward he participated in an audit related to the \\"Louisiana Purchase\\" by the United States of the territory west of the Mississippi River, acquiring his first experience in financial affairs. Biddle traveled extensively through Europe, returning to England to serve as secretary for James Monroe, then United States minister to the Court of St. James's (Kingdom of Great Britain). At Cambridge University, Biddle took part in a conversation with Cambridge professors involving comparison between modern Greek dialect and that of Homer; the incident captured Monroe's attention. In 1807, Biddle returned home to Philadelphia. He practiced law and wrote, contributing papers to different publications on various subjects, but chiefly in the fine arts. He became associate editor of a magazine called Port-Folio, which was published from 1806‚Äì23. When editor Joseph Dennie died in 1812, Biddle took over the magazine and lived on 7th Street, near Spruce Street. =Lewis and Clark= Biddle also prepared western explorers Lewis and Clark's report for publication of their exploratory expedition up the Missouri River through the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase from France (previously recently owned for generations by Spain), across the Rocky Mountains and the Oregon Country of the Pacific Northwest to the mouth of the Columbia River on the far Pacific coast, and he encouraged third President Thomas Jefferson to write an introductory memoir of his former aide and private secretary, Captain Meriwether Lewis, (1774‚Äì1809). However, Biddle's name does not appear in the work, as he was elected to serve on the Pennsylvania state legislature (1810‚Äì1811) and was compelled to turn over the project to Paul Allen, (1775‚Äì1826), who then further supervised its publication. With the consent of all parties, Allen was then recognized as the editor. =Pennsylvania General Assembly= Biddle served as a Federalist member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in 1810, and then in the Pennsylvania State Senate for the 1st district from 1813 to 1815.American National Biography-Nicholas Biddle He originated a bill favoring popular education almost a quarter of a century in advance of the times. Though the bill was initially defeated, it resurfaced repeatedly in different forms until, in 1836, the Pennsylvania \\"common-school\\" system was inaugurated as an indirect result of his efforts. Seventh President Andrew Jackson slays the many-headed monster that symbolizes the revived second Bank of the United States. Nicholas Biddle is in the middle, in the top hat. The Bank of the United States =Early years= After Biddle moved to the Pennsylvania State Senate, he lobbied for the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States. It was on this subject that he made his first speech, which attracted general attention at the time, and was warmly commended by Chief-Justice Marshall and other leaders of public opinion. The Bank had been revived and reorganized from the earlier First Bank of the United States, established in 1791 under the administration of first President George Washington, and after a chartered term of 20 years, expired in 1811 on the eve of the monetary pressures of the coming War of 1812 era. After economic hardships and problems financing the Government and its war measures during the War of 1812 to 1815, and a period of dormancy, a newly revived and reorganized Second Bank of the United States was rechartered in 1816 under fifth President James Monroe, who appointed Biddle as a Federal Government director and representative. When the Bank's president, Langdon Cheves, resigned in 1822, Biddle became its president. During his association with the Bank, President Monroe, under authority from Congress, directed him to prepare a \\"Commercial Digest\\" of the laws and trade regulations of the world and the various nations. For many years after, this Digest was regarded as an authority on the subject. In late 1818, $4 million of interest payments on the bonds previously sold in 1803 to pay for the \\"Louisiana Purchase\\" was due, in either gold or silver, to European investors. The U.S. Government had to get its hands on additional amounts of specie, i.e., silver or gold. As the Government's fiscal agent, the Bank was required to make this payment on behalf of the Government. The Bank was forced to demand that the private commercial banks that had been lent money in the form of \\"fiat\\" paper must now repay in specie, which was then sent to Europe to pay the government's creditors. This rather sudden contraction of the country's monetary base after three currency and rampant speculation based on debt led to the financial Panic of 1819. Meanwhile, in Tennessee, General and future Presidential candidate, Andrew Jackson was hard-pressed to pay his debts during this period. He developed a lifelong hostility to all banks that were not completely backed by gold or silver deposits. This meant, above all, hostility to the new Second Bank of the United States.. As Bank president, Biddle occasionally engaged in the newly developing national techniques of \\"central banking\\" ‚Äì controlling the nation's money supply, regulating interest rates, lending to state banks, and acting as the U.S. Government's fiscal agent. When state banks became excessive in their lending practices, Biddle's Bank acted as a restraint. In a few instances, he even rescued state banks to prevent the risk of \\"contagion\\" spreading. He was also important in the 1833 establishment of Girard College, an early free private school for poor orphaned boys in Philadelphia, under the provisions of the will of his friend and former legal client, Stephen Girard (1750‚Äì1831), one of the wealthiest men in America. Girard had been the original promoter of the revival and reorganization of the Second Bank and its largest investor.A. B. Hepburn, A History of Currency in the United States (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1903; reprinted, August M. Kelly Publishers, 1967) p. 95 On August 26, 1831, Biddle's brother, Thomas, a War of 1812 veteran, was killed in a duel on \\"Bloody Island\\" on the Mississippi River at St. Louis, Missouri with U.S. Representative (Congressman) Spencer Pettis. Thomas had taken offense to Pettis' criticizing Nicholas at the bank. After an exchange of letters to the editor of a newspaper, Biddle accosted an ill Pettis in his hotel room. After Pettis recovered, he then challenged Thomas to a duel, and both were killed when they exchanged shots from five feet apart.Crack of the Pistol: Dueling in 19th Century Missouri ‚Äì sos.mo.gov ‚Äì Retrieved March 5, 2008 =Bank War= The Bank War began when seventh President Andrew Jackson began criticizing the Bank early in his first term. Biddle, at the urging of Henry Clay and other Bank supporters, upped the ante when he applied for the Bank's re-charter in January 1832. This was four years before the charter was scheduled to expire at the end of two decades, and the hope was to force Jackson into making an unpopular decision that might cost him during an election year. But, once challenged, President Jackson decided to veto the bill anyway. Jackson, well known for his stubborn personality and steadfast leadership, still harbored ill-will toward Henry Clay of Kentucky from the earlier \\"Corrupt Bargain\\" accusation following the Presidential Election of 1824 which made him Secretary of State when appointed by the administration of the winner, sixth President John Quincy Adams. At Biddle's direction, the Bank poured thousands of dollars into a campaign to defeat Jackson in the 1832 election. Biddle was told that this would only give credence to Jackson's theory that the Bank interfered in the American political process, but chose to dismiss the warning. Ultimately, Clay's strategy failed, and in November he lost to Jackson, who was reelected to a second term. In early 1833, Jackson, despite opposition from some members of his cabinet, decided to withdraw the Government's funds from the Bank. The incumbent Secretary of the Treasury, Louis McLane, a member of Jackson's Cabinet, professed moderate support for the Bank. He therefore refused to withdraw the Federal funds directed by the President and would not resign, so Jackson then transferred him to the State Department. McLane's successor, William J. Duane, was also opposed to the Bank, but would not carry out Jackson's orders either. After waiting four months, President Jackson summarily dismissed Duane, replacing him with Attorney General Roger B. Taney as a recess appointment when Congress was out of session. In September 1833, Taney helped transfer the public deposits from the Bank to seven state-chartered banks. Faced with the loss of the Federal deposits, Biddle decided to raise interest rates and deliberately induce a recession. A mild financial panic ensued from late 1833 to mid-1834. Intended to force Jackson into a compromise, the move backfired, increasing anti-Bank sentiment. Meanwhile, Biddle and other Bank supporters attempted to renew the Bank's charter through the Congress on numerous occasions. All their attempts failed under the threat of a Jackson presidential veto. =Demise of the bank= Finally, after the requisite twenty-year term, the Bank's charter expired in April 1836, but the institution was issued a new charter under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania, and continued operations for several more years.Jeffrey Sklansky, Sovereign of the Market: The Money Question in Early America. University of Chicago Press, 2017, pp.164-5 As the Bank wound up its operations in the next five years, state-chartered banks in the West and South relaxed their lending standards, maintaining unsafe reserve ratios and contributing to the Panic of 1837. In 1839 Biddle resigned from his post as bank president, having made some unprofitable cotton trades, and in 1841, amidst the post-Panic recession, the Bank finally failed.The Rise and Fall of Nicholas Biddle. www.minneapolisfed.org Biddle was arrested and charged with fraud.

Dark fibre originally referred to the potential network capacity of telecommunication infrastructure. Dark fibre may be leased from a network service provider. Motivations Much of the cost of installing cables is in the civil engineering work required. This includes planning and routing, obtaining permissions, creating ducts and channels for the cables, and finally installation and connection. This work usually accounts for most of the cost of developing fibre networks. For example, in Amsterdam's citywide installation of a fibre network, roughly 80% of the costs involved were labour, with only 10% being fibre. It therefore makes sense to plan for, and install, significantly more fibre than is needed for current demand, to provide for future expansion and provide for network redundancy in case any of the cables fail. Many fibre-optic cable owners such as railroads and power utilities have always included additional fibres with the intention to lease these to other carriers. During the dot-com bubble, a large number of telephone companies built optical-fibre networks, each with the business plan of cornering the market in telecommunications by providing a network with sufficient capacity to take all existing and forecast traffic for the entire region served. This was based on the assumption that telecoms traffic, particularly data traffic, would continue to grow exponentially for the foreseeable future. The advent of wavelength-division multiplexing reduced the demand for fibre by increasing the capacity of a single fibre by a factor of as much as 100. According to Gerry Butters, the former head of Lucent's Optical Networking Group at Bell Labs, the amount of data that could be carried by an optical fibre was doubling every nine months at the time. This progress in the ability to carry data over fibre reduced the need for more fibres. As a result, the wholesale price for data communications collapsed and a number of these companies filed for bankruptcy protection as a result. Global Crossing and Worldcom are two high-profile examples in the United States. Similar to the Railway Mania, the misfortune of one market sector became the good fortune of another, and this overcapacity created a new telecommunications sector. Market For many years incumbent local exchange carriers would not sell dark fibre to end users, because they believed selling access to this core asset would cannibalize their other, more lucrative services. Incumbent carriers in the United States were required to sell dark fibre to competitive local exchange carriers as unbundled network elements (UNE), but they have successfully lobbied to reduce these provisions for existing fibre, and eliminated it completely for new fibre placed for fibre to the premises (FTTP) deployments. Fibre swaps between competitive carriers are quite common. This increases the reach of their networks in places where their competitor has a presence, in exchange for the provision of fibre capacity in places where that competitor has no presence. This is a practice known in the industry as \\"coopetition\\". Meanwhile, other companies arose specializing as dark fibre providers. Dark fibre became more available when there was enormous overcapacity after the telecoms boom years of the late 1990s through 2001. The market for dark fibre tightened up with the return of capital investment to light up existing fibre, and with mergers and acquisitions resulting in a consolidation of dark fibre providers. Networks Dark fibre can be used to create a privately operated optical fibre network that is run directly by its operator over dark fibre leased or purchased from another supplier. This is opposed to purchasing bandwidth or leased line capacity on an existing network. Dark fibre networks may be used for private networking, or as Internet access or Internet infrastructure networking. Dark fibre networks may be point-to-point, or use star, self-healing ring, or mesh topologies. Because both ends of the link are controlled by the same organization, dark fibre networks can operate using the latest optical protocols using wavelength division multiplexing to add capacity where needed, and to provide an upgrade path between technologies. Many dark fibre metropolitan area networks use cheap Gigabit Ethernet equipment over CWDM, rather than expensive SONET ring systems. They offer very high price-performance for network users who require high performance, such as Google, which has dark network capacities for video and search data, or wish to operate their own network for security or other commercial reasons. However, dark fibre networks are generally only available in high-population-density areas where fibre has already been laid, as the civil engineering costs of installing fibre to new locations is often prohibitive. For these reasons, dark fibre networks are typically run between data centres and other places with existing fibre infrastructure. Variations Managed dark fibre is a form of wavelength-division multiplexed access to otherwise dark fibre where a pilot signal is beamed into the fibre by the fibre provider for management purposes using a transponder tuned to an assigned wavelength. Virtual dark fibre using wavelength multiplexing allows a service provider to offer individual wavelengths. Other wavelengths on the same fibre are leased to other customers or used for other purposes. This is typically done using coarse wavelength division multiplexing CWDM because the wider 20 nm spacing of the wavebands makes these systems much less susceptible to interference.

The game gained significant notoriety due to its goal being to rape a Native American woman. The titular player character is based on famous American Civil War commander General George Armstrong Custer, who is most well known for his major defeat at the Battle of Little Bighorn. Following the North American video game crash of 1983, Mystique was unable to stay in business. As a result, many of Mystique's intellectual properties, including Custer's Revenge, were sold off to the adult video game company Playaround. Under the ownership of Playaround, Custer's Revenge was re-branded as Westward Ho and given slight modifications to its original gameplay. These alterations included simple aesthetic changes such as the darkening in color of the Native American woman's skin tone. Playaround also made a version of Custer's Revenge named General Retreat. The game received negative reviews.  Gameplay  Custer's Revenge gameplay screenshot In the game, the player controls the character of Custer, depicted as a man wearing nothing but a cavalry hat, boots and a bandana, sporting a visible erection. Custer has to overcome arrow attacks to reach the other side of the screen. His goal is to rape a Native American woman tied to a pole. In General Retreat, it is the woman who has to overcome various obstacles to have sex with Custer. Instead of arrows, cannonballs are fired at the woman.  Controversy  Custer's Revenge quickly gained notoriety upon its release. Sold in a sealed package labeled \\"NOT FOR SALE TO MINORS\\" and selling for $49.95 (), it acknowledged that children might nonetheless see the game. The game's literature stated \\"if the kids catch you and should ask, tell them Custer and the maiden are just dancing.\\" The makers elected to preview the game for women's and Native American groups, an act which some thought was a publicity stunt. Women's rights groups criticized the game, stating that it was a simulation of rape; the back of the packaging states \\"she's not about to take it lying down, by George! Help is on the way. By God! He's coming.\\" Other groups such as Women Against Pornography, Native American spokespersons, and critics of the video game industry in general protested about the game. Activists tried pressuring legislators to outlaw the game, which Oklahoma City, Oklahoma did. Multiple Industries pursued an $11 million lawsuit against Suffolk County, New York and legislator Philip Nolan \\"because of a resolution authorizing the county executive to take action to halt sales and distribution\\" of the game. Nevertheless, the focused media attention caused the game to sell approximately 80,000 copies, twice as many copies as Mystique's other adult-only games, Bachelor Party and Beat 'Em & Eat 'Em. Atari received numerous complaints about the game however, and responded by trying to sue the game's makers. Stuart Kesten, President of American Multiple Industries (Mystique), stated \\"our object is not to arouse, our object is to entertain [...] When people play our games, we want them smiling, we want them laughing.\\" The game's designer, Joel Miller, said Custer was \\"seducing\\" the maiden and that she was a \\"willing participant.\\" Ultimately, the game was withdrawn from circulation. Legacy In 1988, computer gaming magazine Ahoy! called Custer's Revenge \\"an [affront] to common decency\\", in contrast to more modern and 'tasteful' adult games. Electronic Gaming Monthlys Seanbaby placed it as number 9 in his \\"20 worst games of all time\\" feature. In 2008, the University of Calgary professor Tom Keenan cited \\"the hideous Custer's Revenge game\\", 26 years after its release, in an op-ed piece about current video game violence issues for the Calgary Herald. That same year, the game was credited by Australian PC Magazine as being one of the worst games ever made, while Games.net ranked Custer's victim as fifth on the list of top ten \\"disturbingly sexual\\" game characters.

Biography Biddle was born and died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was the son of Nicholas Biddle, president of the Second Bank of the United States, and nephew of Congressman Richard Biddle. Charles Biddle graduated from Princeton in 1837, where he studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1840. Biddle during the Mexican-American War Biddle served in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, serving as captain and company commander in the Regiment of Voltigeurs and Foot Riflemen. He was brevetted to the rank of major for gallantry in the Battle of Chapultepec. At the close of the war, he returned to Philadelphia to practice law. In May 1861, following the outbreak of the American Civil War and President Abraham Lincoln's call to arms, he was appointed a lieutenant colonel in the Pennsylvania Reserves, rising in May to the rank of colonel in command of the 42nd Pennsylvania Volunteers Infantry (13th Reserves), also known as the 1st Pennsylvania Rifles. In October of that year he was elected to the Thirty-seventh United States Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Edward J. Morris. He was tendered a commission as a brigadier general, but declined it, and then resigned from the army in February 1862. After the war, he became one of the proprietors and editor-in-chief of the Philadelphia Age, and retained that position for the remainder of his life. His literary work was confined mainly to editorial contributions to the columns of this journal. His only separate publication was The Case of Major Andr√©, a carefully prepared essay read before the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, which vindicated the action of George Washington. The immediate occasion was a passage in Lord Mahon's History of England that denounced the execution of Andr√© as the greatest blot upon Washington's record. By an authority so high as the London Critic, this essay was subsequently pronounced a fair refutation of Lord Mahon's charge.

In the 1980s he led the \\"Can't Pay, Won't Pay\\" campaign in opposition to the Poll Tax. It was widely known that he often disagreed politically with Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP through the 1990s, and he was at one stage viewed as belonging to the SNP Fundamentalist camp, being perceived to be allied to figures such as Jim Sillars and Alex Neil within the party.  Member of the Scottish Parliament (1999‚Äì2016)  After MacAskill became on MSP in 1999 upon the establishment of the Scottish Parliament as a regional list member for the Lothians he moderated his political position, seeing the development of the Scottish Parliament as the most achievable route for Scotland to become an independent nation state. In this respect he was regarded as having adopted a gradualist approach to Scottish independence in place of his previous fundamentalist position. He was one of former SNP leader John Swinney's closest supporters. In 1999 MacAskill was detained in London before the Euro 2000 second leg play-off match between Scotland and England on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. As he was not charged with any crime the incident did not affect his position within the SNP and he won re-election at the 2003 election. In 2004, after John Swinney stood down as SNP party leader, Kenny MacAskill backed the joint leadership ticket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. He had initially intended to stand for deputy leader himself on a joint ticket with Nicola Sturgeon, who would have sought the leadership. He gave way when Salmond reconsidered his earlier decision not to seek re-election to the leadership. Upon their election as leader and deputy leader respectively MacAskill was selected to be the SNP's deputy leader in the Scottish Parliament, making him the shadow Deputy First Minister. MacAskill authored a book, 'Building a Nation ‚Äì Post Devolution Nationalism in Scotland', which was launched at the SNP's 2004 annual conference in Inverness. He has since edited another book 'Agenda for a New Scotland ‚Äì Visions of Scotland 2020' and has co-authored 'Global Scots ‚Äì Voices From Afar' with former First Minister Henry McLeish. = Cabinet Secretary for Justice (2007‚Äì2014) = For the 2007 Scottish Parliament election MacAskill was top of the SNP's party list for the Lothians region. He stood in the Edinburgh East and Musselburgh constituency, winning that seat from the Scottish Labour Party with a 13.3% swing to give a majority of 1,382. This was the first time the SNP had ever won a parliamentary seat in Edinburgh. After the SNP's victory at the 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, MacAskill became the Cabinet Secretary for Justice. One of MacAskill's first acts as a cabinet secretary was to lift the ban on alcohol sales at international rugby union games held at Murrayfield Stadium.Murrayfield toasts lifting of drinks ban, The Times 9 June 2007 MacAskill also said that the 2007 terror attack on Glasgow Airport was not committed by 'home-grown' terrorists in that the suspects were not \\"born or bred\\" in Scotland but had merely lived in the country for a \\"period of time\\". MacAskill won election to a redrawn constituency of Edinburgh Eastern in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election. Despite notionally facing a deficit of 550 votes, MacAskill won by over 2000 votes. Pan Am Flight 103 On 19 August 2009, MacAskill rejected an application by Libya to transfer to their custody Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, convicted of the Pan Am Flight 103 bomb that killed 270 people, acknowledging that \\"the American families and Government had an expectation or were led to believe that there would be no prisoner transfer.\\"UK Cabinet Office, Cabinet Secretary's Review of Papers Relating to the Release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi 11 ¬∂ 31 (7 February 2011) available at www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/sites/default/files/resources/20110207-megrahi- review-report.pdf MacAskill authorised al-Megrahi's release on compassionate grounds. Megrahi had served 8¬Ω years of a life sentence, but had developed terminal prostate cancer. The Justice Secretary has discretionary authority to order such a release, and MacAskill took sole responsibility for the decision. Megrahi died on 20 May 2012. In the United States, where 180 of the 270 victims came from, the decision met with broad hostility. Political figures including President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke out against it, and families of the victims expressed indignation over the decision. FBI director Robert Mueller, who had been a lead investigator in the 1988 bombing, wrote a highly critical open letter to MacAskill. Former Labour First Minister Henry McLeish was critical of Mueller's attack on the decision. In Britain, reaction was divided. Scottish Labour leader Iain Gray, former First Minister Jack McConnell, and former Scottish Office minister Brian Wilson criticised the decision,https://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iCpNccRWlg_qME4nocYStu9vB_pQ while Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, former Labour MP Tam Dalyell and former British ambassador to Libya Richard Dalton publicly supported it., BBC News. Ian Galloway and Mario Conti, representatives of the Church of Scotland and the Roman Catholic Church respectively, also spoke in favour of the release.FBI chief's attack 'out of order' ‚Äì Conti, BBC News, 24 August 2009. John Mosey, a priest who lost a daughter on Pan Am Flight 103, expressed his disappointment that halting Megrahi's appeal before it went to court meant that the public would never hear \\"this important evidence ‚Äî the six separate grounds for appeal that the SCCRC felt were important enough to put forward, that could show that there‚Äôs been a miscarriage of justice.\\" Saif al-Islam Gaddafi reiterated his belief in Megrahi's innocence commenting that the Justice Secretary had \\"made the right decision\\" and that history would prove this to be the case. A letter in support of MacAskill's decision was sent to the Scottish Government on behalf of former South African President Nelson Mandela. The Scottish Parliament was recalled from its summer break, for the third time since its creation, to receive a statement from and question MacAskill. The opposition parties in the Scottish Parliament passed amendments criticising the decision and the way it was made, but no motions of confidence in MacAskill or the Scottish Government were tabled.SNP defeated over bomber release, BBC News, 2 September 2009. After MacAskill won re-election to the Scottish Parliament in 2011, a Scottish National Party supporter said that the decision had been mentioned by very few voters during the election campaign.  Member of Parliament (since 2019)  MacAskill was chosen as the SNP candidate for East Lothian at the 2019 UK general election. He was subsequently elected, overturning a 3,083 majority and defeating Labour's Martin Whitfield. In April 2020, MacAskill called for the office of Lord Advocate to be split - similarly to the English and Welsh system of Attorney General for England and Wales and Director of Public Prosecutions - in response of the trial of former First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond, to avoid potential conflicts of interest.

It lies in Lower Silesian Voivodeship (in 1975‚Äì1998 it was in the former Jelenia G√≥ra Voivodeship). It is the seat of Zgorzelec County and of Gmina Zgorzelec (although it is not part of the territory of the latter, as the town is an urban gmina in its own right). Zgorzelec is located on the Lusatian Neisse river, on the post-1945 Polish-German Neisse border adjoining the German town of G√∂rlitz, of which it constituted the eastern part up to 1945. History Up until 1945, the modern-day towns of Zgorzelec and G√∂rlitz were a single entity; their history up to that point is shared. The date of the town's foundation is unknown. =Middle Ages to 19th C= Zgorzelec/G√∂rlitz was first mentioned in a document from the King of Germany, and later Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV in 1071 as a small Sorbian village named Goreliz in the region of Upper Lusatia. Since 965, the village was part of the Margraviate of Meissen, a frontier march of the Holy Roman Empire. It was conquered by Polish Duke, and future King, Boles≈Çaw I the Brave in 1002, and remained part of Poland during the reign of the first Polish kings Boles≈Çaw I the Brave and Mieszko II Lambert until 1031, when the region fell again to the Margraviate of Meissen. In 1075, the region came under the rule of the Duchy of Bohemia. In the 13th century the village gradually turned into a town. It became rich due to its location on the Via Regia, an ancient and medieval trade road. In 1319 it became part of the Piast-ruled Duchy of Jawor, and later on, became part of Bohemia again. In the following centuries, from 1346, it was a wealthy member of the Six-City League of Upper Lusatia, consisting of the six Lusatian cities Bautzen, G√∂rlitz, Kamenz, Lauban, L√∂bau and Zittau. The town of Gorlice in southern Poland was founded during the reign of Casimir the Great in 1354 by ethnic German colonists from G√∂rlitz, in the last phases of eastward settlement by Germans (in this case by Walddeutsche). The Tricycle Mill in the 1920s In the 15th century, the city came under Hungarian rule, but eventually returned to Bohemia. After suffering for years in the Thirty Years' War, the region of Upper Lusatia (including G√∂rlitz) passed to Saxony (1635), whose Electors were also Kings of Poland from 1697. One of the two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the city at that time. In 1815, after the Napoleonic Wars, the Congress of Vienna awarded G√∂rlitz to the Kingdom of Prussia and subsequently the city became part of the German Empire in 1871. The city was a part of the Prussian province of Silesia from 1815 to 1919. =20th century= After the abolition of the Kingdom of Prussia in the aftermath of World War I, G√∂rlitz became a part of the newly established Province of Lower Silesia in the Free State of Prussia. During World War II a German prisoner-of-war camp, Stalag VIII-A was located in present-day territory of Zgorzelec. The French composer Olivier Messiaen was one of its inmates. The Treaty of Zgorzelec, between Poland and East Germany, was signed in the city's community center in 1950. The establishment of the Oder-Neisse line as the Polish-East German border divided G√∂rlitz (lying on the Neisse) between the two countries. The German part retained the name G√∂rlitz, while the Polish part became Zgorzelec. The German and Sorbian population was expelled from Zgorzelec. New Polish and Greek settlers arrived in the town. Reconstructed Postal Square, seen from the river Starting in 1948, some 10,000 Greek Refugees of the Greek Civil War, mainly communist partisans, were allowed into Poland and settled mainly in Zgorzelec. There were Greek schools, a Greek retirement home and even a factory reserved for Greek employees. The majority of those refugees later returned to Greece, but a part remains to this day (see Greeks in Poland). The Greek community of Zgorzelec was instrumental in the building of The Orthodox church of Ss Constantine and Helen in 2002. Since 1999, an annual international Greek Song Festival has been held in Zgorzelec. Miejski Dom Kultury is one of the cultural and community centers of Zgorzelec =Recent history= Since the fall of communism in 1989, Zgorzelec and G√∂rlitz have developed a close political relationship. Two of the numerous bridges over the Neisse river that had been blown up by retreating German forces in World War II have been rebuilt, reconnecting the two towns with one bus line. There is also common urban management and annual common sessions of both town councils. In 2006 the towns jointly applied to be the European Capital of Culture in 2010. It was hoped that the jury would be convinced by the concept of Polish- German cooperation, but the award fell to Essen, with G√∂rlitz/Zgorzelec in second place.

He was originally a Confucian scholar of high reputation, but converted to Buddhism at the age of 21 upon the death of a close friend. He wandered among the Korean mountain monasteries, until he had the fortune of becoming the disciple of the last Korean national teacher, Muhak. Gihwa's writings showed a distinctive mixture between iconoclastic and subitist Seon language, and a strong appreciation for the scriptural tradition. Thus, he took up from Jinul the tradition of unification of Seon and Gyo Buddhism. Among his writings, there are four works in particular that made a deep impact on the subsequent Seon tradition in Korea. These are: # A commentary on the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment, the Weongak gyeong hae seorui. # A redaction and subcommentary to five famous earlier commentaries on the Diamond Sutra, the Geumgang banyabaramilgyeong ogahae seorui. # A subcommentary and redaction of the Collection of Yongjia, the Yonggajip gwaju seorui # The Hyeonjeong non As a result of his fourth major work, the Hyeonjeong non, Gihwa distinguished himself as the primary Buddhist respondent to the rising Neo-Confucian polemic of his period, as he responded with vigor to the Neo-Confucian criticisms of Buddhism. Gihwa died while residing at Jeongsusa, at the southern tip of Ganghwado, where his tomb can still be visited. Gihwa's commentary on the Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment was translated by A.

The earliest records are in Chinese, and it is believed to be of Chinese origin. Divided into twelve chapters as a series of discussions on meditation practice, this text deals with issues such as the meaning and origin of ignorance, sudden and gradual enlightenment, original Buddhahood, etc. these themes were also elucidated in the Awakening of Faith. It was intended to resolve questions regarding doctrine and meditation for the earliest practitioners of the Chan school. The most important commentary is the 9th- century Great Exegesis on the Sutra of Complete Enlightenment (ÂúìË¶∫Á∂ìÂ§ßÁñèÈàî Dajuejing Dashuchao) by Zongmi. Titles Its full Chinese title: (, ). Its reconstructed title in Sanskrit is MahƒÅvaipulya p≈´r·πáabuddha-s≈´tra prasannƒÅrtha-s≈´tra.  History  Its translation into Chinese is traditionally attributed to BuddhatrƒÅta, an Indian or Kashmiri monk otherwise unattested in history, who translated the work from Sanskrit in 693 in the White Horse Temple of Luoyang.ÔºàÊó•Êú¨Ôºâ„Ää‰ΩõÊõ∏Ëß£Ë™™Â§ßËæ≠ÂÖ∏„ÄãÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÂç∑ p.281Ôºå Some scholars, however, believe it to be Chinese in origin and written in the late 7th or early 8th century CE. It is considered a creative reformulation that assembles the teaching from the Shurangama Sutra and Awakening of Faith, which are also texts whose origin has been scrutinized. Summary The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment is arranged in twelve chapters, plus a short introductory section. The introductory section describes the scene of the sermon and lists the major participants. The location is a state of deep meditative concentration (samadhi) and the participants are the Buddha and one hundred thousand great bodhisattvas, among whom twelve eminent bodhisattvas act as spokesmen. Each one of the twelve gets up one by one and asks the Buddha a set of questions about doctrine, practice and enlightenment. The structure of the sutra is such that the most \\"essential\\" and suddenistic discussions occur in the earlier chapters and the more \\"functional\\" and gradualistic dialogues occur later. This kind of structure reflects a motif associated with the doctrine of the Huayan school, which affirms that the Buddha delivered the abstruse Avatamsaka Sutra (ËèØÂö¥Á∂ì ‚ÄòHuayan Scripture‚Äô) as his first sermon, in an effort to directly awaken those whose \\"roots of virtue\\" were well-matured. The terminology that Zongmi and Gihwa use to describe these advanced practitioners is that they possess the capacity for the teaching of \\"sudden enlightenment\\"; a direct awakening to the non-duality of reality, which necessarily precludes gradualist, \\"goal-oriented\\" practice. In the first two chapters (the chapters of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´ and Samantabhadra), the Buddha holds very strictly to the sudden position, denying the possibility of enlightenment through gradual practice. In the third chapter he begins to allow for a bit of a gradual view, and the next several chapters become mixtures of the two. The final few chapters offer a fully gradualist perspective. Gihwa's primary means of categorization of the chapters is according to the \\"three capacities\\" of practitioners: superior, middling and inferior. According to Gihwa, the first three chapters are aimed at those of superior capacity, the next seven for those of middling capacity and the final two for those of inferior capacity. However, this method of categorization does not necessarily mean that the later chapters become gradually easier to read and understand. In fact some of the most difficult discussions come in the later chapters. Most notable in this regard is the discussion of the \\"four traces\\" of Self, Person, Sentient Being and Life in Chapter Nine. Since the distinction between each of these four is extremely subtle, and the wording of the text itself is not that clear, this turns out to be one of the most difficult chapters to digest.

As well as being a generic term, 'Divemaster' is the title of the first professional rating of many training agencies, such as PADI, SSI, SDI, NASE, except NAUI, which rates a NAUI Divemaster under a NAUI Instructor but above a NAUI Assistant Instructor. The divemaster certification is generally equivalent to the requirements of ISO 24801-3 Dive Leader. The BSAC recognizes several agencies' divemaster certificates as equivalent to BSAC Dive Leader, but not to BSAC Advanced Diver. The converse may not be true. The certification is a prerequisite for training as an instructor in recreational diving with the professional agencies except NAUI, where it is an optional step, because of the different position of the NAUI Divemaster in the NAUI hierarchy. Role Scuba diving education levels as used by ISO, PADI, CMAS, SSI and NAUI The role of a divemaster may vary, but will generally include the following roles: * Organizing, conducting and supervising recreational diving activities (but not training), both shore and boat based. * Assisting instructors in conducting training programs and activities for certified divers. * Generally supervising non-training related diving activities by planning, organizing and directing dives. **assessing the hazards of a dive site and informing the divers of the hazards, **briefing divers on the layout and points of interest of a dive site, **suggesting routes for a dive at a specific site for autonomous divers, **checking divers into and out of the water from a boat or shore entry point, **leading a group of divers in the water as a tour guide. * Within the limits of some agencies, divemasters may: ** act as instructional assistants to instructors. ** supervise participants in experience programs for uncertified divers. ** teach and certify skin divers and snorkellers. ** conduct scuba review programs for certified divers. Responsibility and legal position The legal duty of care of a divemaster to a client varies according to the legislation of the country, where it is often poorly defined. The use of waivers and/or assumption of risk forms that are intended to minimize legal accountability of divemasters is a common practice, but the validity of such waivers will vary with the legislation. Equivalence of certification The following certifications are recognised as meeting or exceeding the requirements of EN/ISO 24801-3:2014: *ACUC Divemaster *ANDI Divemaster *BSAC Dive Leader *CMAS 3-star Diver *DMT NASE Divemaster *IANTD Divemaster *NASDS Dive Supervisor *NAUI Divemaster *PADI Divemaster *PSAI Divemaster *SAA Dive Leader(?), Dive Supervisor *SDI Divemaster *SNSI Divemaster *SSI Dive Guide Equivalence in other fields of diving =Technical diving= In technical diving, divers are assumed to be competent and responsible for their own safety or the safety of the team of which they are members to the extent that is agreed by that team. It is not unusual for a technical team or expedition group to appoint one of their number as a team leader or surface dive marshall, but the surface marshall is often more of an administrative position, who will check divers into and out of the water, and the dive team leader is more the navigator, or the person in front of the group than someone making safety decisions for other divers. Most technical divers follow the principle that any diver may call an end to a dive at any time for any reason, and that the team will comply, following the previously agreed termination procedure. NAUI has a Technical Support Leader course that is designed to train NAUI Divemasters and Assistant Instructors who are also technical divers in this role. =Professional diving= Professional divers generally work in teams which have one or more divers in the water and a supervisor on the surface, with one or more assistants for handling lifelines, umbilicals, communications, gas panels and other support equipment, and a who is responsible for assisting or rescuing the in-water divers in an emergency. In these circumstances the supervisor has a high and legally defined level of responsibility for the safety of the dive team and anyone else on site. Employment opportunities and conditions Divemasters have the ability to work in holiday destinations in many parts of the world. They may work in diving resorts, private yachts, cruise ships and dive centres ‚Äì anywhere where there is a demand for organised recreational diving. Many divemasters also work in retail dive facilities and assist the instructor with training and supervision.  Training  During Divemaster training, candidates learn dive leadership skills through classroom, independent study and practical training exercises. Some Divemaster programs require an internship program too. They complete water skills and stamina exercises, training exercises that improve their ability to organize and solve problems and help others to improve their abilities. Candidates put this knowledge into action through a structured internship or a series of practical training exercises, including the candidate assisting in actual diving programs with real diving students. Divers can develop to divemaster level through two different methods. Either through progressing along the recreational levels of diving, or through divemaster internships that fast-track the candidate to divemaster level by having them become involved in the training facility where they are training. Divemaster internships are offered by many different dive shops under their respective organizations( PADI, NAUI, SSI, etc.)The internship program allows the divemaster candidate to not only complete the minimum learning requirements, but to also \\"intern\\" and practice what has been learned. =Prerequisites for training= The whole PADI training system. PADI and SDI Divemaster candidates must have reached the following minimum requirements prior to their divemaster training: * Advanced Open Water Diver certification (or qualifying certification from another training organization) * Rescue Diver certification (or qualifying certification from another training organization) * First Aid & CPR training (preferably with automated external defibrillator (AED) training) * 40 logged dives * Submit a medical statement signed by a physician within the last 12 months. NASE requires divemaster candidates to also have demonstrated competency in physics, physiology, skills and environment, dive planning and equipment prior to entering a program. PADI Divemaster candidates must have completed 60 logged dives prior to certification.  NAUI  Divemaster is a NAUI leadership-level certification between Assistant Instructor and Instructor, in contrast to agencies such as PADI that rate divemaster as the lowest level of leadership qualification. A NAUI Divemaster may organize and conduct dives for certified divers and is qualified to assist active-status NAUI Instructors on diver training courses. NAUI provides a core of leadership-level skills and knowledge in the NAUI Master Scuba Diver and NAUI Scuba Rescue Diver courses, which are necessary prerequisites for all NAUI leadership programs. Divemaster candidates who offer equivalent certification must still pass the NAUI Master Scuba Diver written examination. Divemaster candidates must either hold a NAUI Assistant Instructor qualification, or have a minimum of 60 logged open water dives demonstrating varied environment, depth and activities, as well as waterskills equal to those expected of an Assistant Instructor. Holding a NAUI Divemaster certificate is one of three ways in which the diver certification requirements for a NAUI Instructor Training Course may be met.

Asian cuisine includes several major regional cuisines: Central Asian, East Asian, North Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, and West Asian. A cuisine is a characteristic style of cooking practices and traditions,\\"Cuisine.\\" Thefreedictionary.com. Accessed June 2011. usually associated with a specific culture. Asia, being the largest and most populous continent, is home to many cultures, many of which have their own characteristic cuisine. Ingredients common to many cultures in the East and Southeast regions of the continent include rice, ginger, garlic, sesame seeds, chilies, dried onions, soy, and tofu. Stir frying, steaming, and deep frying are common cooking methods. While rice is common to most Asian cuisines, different varieties are popular in the various regions. Basmati rice is popular in the Indian subcontinent, Jasmine rice is often found across Southeast Asia, while long-grain rice is popular in China and short-grain in Japan and Korea. Curry is a common dish in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia. Curry dishes have their origins in the Indian subcontinent. With present-day Northern India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan mainly using a yogurt base, while those in present-day Southern India, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia generally use coconut milk as their foundation.  Central Asian cuisine  Central Asia (orthographic projection).svgLocation of Central Asia. Most Central Asian nations have similar cuisines to each other as well as their neighbors, taking many features of the neighboring cuisines of Western and Eastern Asia, particularly Mongolia. A dish known as \\"plov\\", or \\"osh\\", for example, is a widespread variation of pilaf. However, many of the same countries use horse meat and mutton as the most common meats, similar to beef. This is owing to Mongolian cuisine. In Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, the cuisine has evolved to meet the needs of a nomad lifestyle. Kumis is a widespread drink among Turkic peoples, especially in Central Asia. Central Asia is also noted for being the birthplace of yogurt. Like kumis, it is widespread among Turkic peoples.  East Asian cuisine  East Asia (orthographic projection).svgLocation of East Asia. East Asian cuisine includes Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Singaporean, Taiwanese and Tibetan food. Considering this is the most populated region of the world, it has many regional cuisines (especially in China). Examples of staple foods include rice, noodles, mung beans, soybeans, seafood (Japan has the highest per capita consumption of seafood), mutton (Mongolia), bok choy (Chinese cabbage), and tea. Cuisines in this region are similar to Southeast Asian cuisine due to cultural and ethnic mixing.  North Asian cuisine North Asia (orthographic projection).svgLocation of Northern Asia. North Asian cuisine is often synonymous with Russian cuisine, due to all of Northern Asia being a part of the Russian Federation. However, some cultures or areas of Siberia have in- depth cuisine, such as the Yakuts (or Sakha) and Yamal cuisine. Buryats also have their own cuisine, although it is very similar to that of the related Mongolians. Pelmeni, originally a Permic or Ugric dish, has entered into mainstream Russian cuisine as a well-known dish, but it can still be considered part of the Yamal cuisine for its area of origin. Some speculate them to be a simplified version of the Chinese wonton. In Siberia, pelmeni is frozen outdoors to preserve the meat inside throughout the long winter. In Yamal, other types of drying and preservation are common. Key ingredients in most northern Siberian cuisine include fish and cowberries, sometimes known as lingonberries in Europe and North America. Yakuts, like many other Turkic- speaking peoples, traditionally enjoy kumis as a common drink.  South Asian cuisine  South Asia (orthographic projection) without national boundaries.svgLocation of South Asia. South Asian cuisine includes the cuisines from the Indian subcontinent. Foods in this area of the world are flavoured with various types of chili, black pepper, cloves, and other strong herbs and spices and often with flavoured butter and ghee. Turmeric and cumin are often used to make curries. Common meats include lamb, goat, fish, and chicken. Beef is less common than in Western cuisines because cattle have a special place in Hinduism. Prohibitions against beef extend to the meat of cows, and yaks to some extent. Pork is considered a taboo food item by all Muslims and is avoided by some Hindus.  Southeast Asian cuisine  Southeast Asia (orthographic projection).svgLocation of Southeast Asia. Southeast Asian cuisine includes a strong emphasis on lightly prepared dishes with a strong aromatic component that features such flavors as citrus and herbs such as lime, coriander/cilantro and basil. Ingredients in the region are similar with the ones in East Asian cuisines, using fish sauces for sauce and the inclusion of ingredients such as galangal, tamarind and lemongrass. Cooking methods also include a balance of stir-frying, boiling and steaming.  West Asian cuisine  Western Asia (orthographic projection).svgLocation of Western Asia. West Asian cuisine significantly overlaps with the Middle Eastern cuisine and the inclusion of the Caucasus. West Asian cuisine is the cuisine of the various countries and peoples of West Asia. The cuisine of the region is diverse while having a degree of homogeneity.\\"The Middle East: Background.\\" , Globalgourmet.com . Accessed January 2007. Some commonly used ingredients include olives and olive oil, pitas, honey, sesame seeds, dates, sumac, chickpeas, mint and parsley. Some popular dishes include kibbeh and shawarma. Cereals constitute the basis of West Asian diet, both historically and today. Wheat and rice are the major and preferred sources of staple foods. Barley is also widely used in the region and maize has become common in some areas as well. Bread is a universal staple, eaten in one form or another by all classes and groups practically at every meal. Butter and clarified butter (also known as samna/smen) are, traditionally, the preferred medium of cooking. Olive oil is prevalent in the Mediterranean coastal areas. Christians use it during Lent, when meat and dairy products are excluded, and Jews use it in place of animal fats such as butter to avoid mixing meat and dairy products. Lamb and mutton have always been the favored meats of West Asia. Pork is prohibited in both Islam and Judaism, and as such is rarely eaten in the region. Prominent among the meat preparations are grilled meats, or kebabs. Meat and vegetable stews, served with rice, bulgur, or bread, are another form of meat preparation in the region. Vegetables and pulses are the predominant staples of the great majority of the people in the West Asia. They are boiled, stewed, grilled, stuffed, and cooked with meat and rice. Among the green leafy vegetables, many varieties of cabbage, spinach, and chard are widely used. Root and bulb vegetables, such as onions and garlic, as well as carrots, turnips, and beets are equally common.

It was formed by the fusion of the Trotskyist Communist Left of Spain (Izquierda Comunista de Espa√±a, ICE) and the Workers and Peasants' Bloc (BOC, affiliated with the Right Opposition) against the will of Leon Trotsky, with whom the former broke. The writer George Orwell served with the party's militia and witnessed the Stalinist repression of the movement, which would help form his anti-authoritarian ideas in later life. Formation In 1935, POUM was formed as a communist opposition to the Stalinist form of Communism promoted by the Soviet Union, by the revolutionaries Andreu Nin and Joaqu√≠n Maur√≠n. Nin was heavily influenced by the thinking of Leon Trotsky, particularly his Permanent Revolution thesis. It resulted from the merging of the Communist Party's Left Opposition (the Trotskyist Communist Left of Spain) and the Right Opposition (the Workers and Peasants' Bloc). This alliance was against the wishes of Trotsky, with whom the Communist Left of Spain broke. Position A c. 1936 POUM poster appeals to workers: \\"Obreros ¬°A la victoria!\\" (\\"Workers: to Victory!\\"). The party grew larger than the official Communist Party of Spain (PCE) both nationally and in the communist hotbeds of Catalonia and the Valencian Country, where the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia (PSUC) represented the PCE. The POUM was highly critical of the Popular Front strategy advocated by Joseph Stalin and the Comintern; nevertheless, it participated in the Spanish Popular Front initiated by Manuel Aza√±a, leader of Acci√≥n Republicana. The POUM attempted to implement some of its radical policies as part of the Popular Front government, but they were resisted by the more centrist factions. George Orwell, who fought alongside the POUM in the civil war, reports that its membership was roughly 10,000 in July 1936, 70,000 in December 1936, and 40,000 in June 1937, although he notes that the numbers are from POUM sources and are probably exaggerated. Conflict with the PCE and PSUC The POUM's independent communist position, including opposition to Stalin, caused huge ruptures with the PCE, which remained fiercely loyal to the Comintern. Moreover, these divisions, which included accusations of Trotskyism (and even Fascism) by the Communists, resulted in actual fighting between their supporters; most notably, in 1937, a primarily Communist coalition of government forces attacked the POUM during the Barcelona May Days. While the larger CNT initially supported the POUM, its more militant members‚Äîsuch as Juan Garc√≠a Oliver and the Friends of Durruti‚Äîwere pushed towards conciliation by the moderate leadership. This left the POUM, along with the purely Trotskyist Seccion Bolshevik-Leninista, isolated, and both organizations were driven underground. Nin was detained and presumably tortured to death by NKVD agents in Alcal√° de Henares, and his party consistently labeled as provocateur in Stalinist propaganda. International links The POUM was a member of the \\"London Bureau\\" of socialist and centrist Marxist parties that rejected both the reformism of the Second International and the pro-Moscow orientation of the Third International. Other members included the Independent Labour Party in Britain, the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (PSOP) in France, and Poale Zion. Its youth wing was affiliated to the International Bureau of Revolutionary Youth Organizations, through which it recruited the ILP Contingent in the Civil War. Foreign supporters of POUM during the Civil War included Lois Orr. Transition era During the Spanish transition to democracy, the POUM was legalized in 1977. This led to a split in the party, with one faction opposing formal legalization, calling for a boycott of the 1977 general election and demanding the immediate restoration of the republic. The legalized party participated in the election as part of the Front for Workers' Unity (FUT), a coalition of parties and organisations to the left of the PCE which won 0.22% of the nationwide vote. The election result led to a crisis for the POUM as well as for most parties to the left of the PCE, from which it was not able to recover.Pelai Pag√®s, El POUM durant la transici√≥ democr√†tica (1974‚Äì1981). Retrieved 15 January 2016 The POUM continued to exist as a small party with an office in Barcelona and a monthly newspaper, La Batalla, calling for cooperation among the various far-left parties, but an attempted merger with Communist Action and the Collective for Marxist Unification failed during a \\"Unification Congress\\" in 1978. After this setback, the POUM decided not to participate in the 1979 elections. POUM branches in several cities became part of local coalitions and unification attempts with various far-left groups. In 1980, the POUM made its last electoral efforts, supporting Herri Batasuna in the Basque country and participating in the Left Bloc for National Liberation (BEAN - Unitat Popular) coalition in the Catalan parliamentary election, but the party was disintegrating. La Batalla ceased publication in May 1980, marking the end of the POUM as an organized party, though it was never officially dissolved. As a last remnant, the Valencia branch remained active until 1981. Former members of the POUM formed the Fundaci√≥n Andreu Nin (Andreu Nin Foundation) to preserve the heritage of their party and ideological current. Cultural references British author George Orwell fought alongside members of the Independent Labour Party as part of POUM militias; he recounted the experience in his book Homage to Catalonia. Likewise, the film Land and Freedom, directed by Ken Loach, tells of a group of POUM soldiers fighting in the war from the perspective of a British member of the British Communist Party. In particular, the film deals with his disillusionment with the Soviet Union's policies in the war. The POUM is briefly mentioned in Joe Haldeman's science fiction novel The Forever War as a militia where \\"(y)ou obeyed an order only after it had been explained in detail; you could refuse if it didn't make sense.\\" Victor Serge dedicates Midnight in the Century to Andreu Nin and other slain leaders of the POUM. Discussion of POUM in Hemingway's For Whom The Bell Tolls (Collier edition, p. 247). Ian Fleming's From Russia with Love (Signet edition, p. 50) states that Rosa Klebb infiltrated the POUM and may have murdered Andr√©s Nin P√©rez.

The Times, Monday, 21 April 1952; pg. 9; Issue 52291 In September 1965, BMC took control of its major supplier of bodies, Pressed Steel, acquiring Jaguar's body supplier in the process. In September 1966, BMC merged with Jaguar Cars.\\"Jaguar Group of companies is to merge with The British Motor Corporation Ltd., as the first step towards the sitting up of a joint holding company to be called British Motor (Holdings) Limited.\\" Joint merger statement, 11 July 1966 issued at the press conference at the Great Eastern Hotel, London In December 1966, BMC changed its name to British Motor Holdings Limited (BMH).British Motor Takes That New Label The Times, Thursday, 15 December 1966; pg. 17; Issue 56815 BMH merged, in May 1968, with Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, which made trucks and buses and owned Standard-Triumph International Limited, BMH becoming the major part of British Leyland Motor Corporation. Organisation A BMC share certificate A BMC ambulance A 1963 Austin Mini Super-Deluxe The Mini was BMC's all-time best seller. A 1965 Riley 4/72 BMC was the largest British car company of its day, with (in 1952) 39% of British output, producing a wide range of cars under brand names including Austin, Morris, MG, Austin-Healey, Riley, and Wolseley, as well as commercial vehicles and agricultural tractors. The first chairman was Lord Nuffield (William Morris), but he was replaced at the end of 1952 by Austin's Leonard Lord, who continued in that role until his 65th birthday in 1961, but handing over, in theory at least, the managing director responsibilities to his deputy George Harriman in 1956. BMC's headquarters were at the Austin Longbridge plant, near Birmingham and Austin was the dominant partner in the group mainly because of the chairman. The use of Morris engine designs was dropped within three years and all new car designs were coded ADO from \\"Amalgamated Drawing Office\\". The Longbridge plant was up to date, having been thoroughly modernised in 1951, and compared very favourably with Nuffield's 16 different and often old- fashioned factories scattered over the Midlands. Austin's management systems, however, especially cost control and marketing, were not as good as Nuffield's and as the market changed from a shortage of cars to competition, this was to tell. The biggest-selling car, the Mini, was famously analysed by Ford Motor Company, which concluded that BMC must have been losing ¬£30 on every one sold. The result was that although volumes held up well throughout the BMC era, market share fell as did profitability and hence investment in new models, triggering the 1966 merger with Jaguar Cars to form British Motor Holdings (BMH), and the government-sponsored merger of BMH with Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968. At the time of the mergers, a well established dealership network was in place for each of the marques. Among the car-buying British public was a tendency of loyalty to a particular marque and marques appealed to different market segments. This meant that marques competed against each other in some areas, though some marques had a larger range than others. The Riley and Wolseley models were selling in very small numbers. Styling was also getting distinctly old-fashioned and this caused Leonard Lord, in an unusual move for him, to call upon the services of an external stylist. BMC Farina In 1958, BMC hired Battista Farina to redesign its entire car line. This resulted in the creation of three \\"Farina\\" saloons, each of which was badge- engineered to fit the various BMC car lines. The compact Farina model bowed in 1958 with the Austin A40 Farina. This is considered by many to be the first mass-produced hatchback car: a small estate version was produced with a horizontally split tailgate, its size and configuration would today be considered that of a small hatchback. A Mark II A40 Farina appeared in 1961 and was produced through 1967. These small cars used the A-Series engine. The mid-sized Farinas were launched in 1958 with the Wolseley 15/60. Other members of the group included the Riley 4/68, Austin A55 Cambridge Mk. II, MG Magnette Mk. III, and Morris Oxford V. Later, the design was licensed in Argentina and produced as the Siam Di Tella 1500, Traveller station wagon and Argenta pick- up. The mid-size cars used the B-Series straight-4 engine. Most of these cars lasted until 1961, though the Di Tellas remained until 1966. They were replaced with a new Farina body style and most were renamed. These were the Austin A60 Cambridge, MG Magnette Mk. IV, Morris Oxford VI, Riley 4/72, and Wolseley 16/60 and in 1964 the Siam Magnette 1622 alongside the Siam Di Tella in Argentina. These mostly remained in production until 1968, with no rear- wheel drive replacement produced. Farina also designed a large car. Launched in 1959 as the Austin A99 Westminster, Vanden Plas Princess 3-Litre, and Wolseley 6/99, it used the large C-Series straight-6 engine. The large Farinas were updated in 1961 as the Austin A110 Westminster, Vanden Plas Princess 3-Litre Mk. II, and Wolseley 6/110. These remained in production until 1968.

Hence, cars that had more than one marque name (e.g. Morris Mini Minor and Austin Mini) would have the same ADO number. Given the often complex badge-engineering that BMC undertook, it is common amongst enthusiasts to use the ADO number when referring to vehicles which were a single design (for example, saying 'The ADO15 entered production in 1959'- this encompasses the fact that when launched, the ADO15 was marketed as the Morris Mini Minor and, later, the Austin Seven‚Äîsoon replaced with Austin Mini). The ADO numbering system did continue for some time after the creation of British Leyland - notable models being the Austin Allegro (ADO67) and the prototype version of the Austin Metro (ADO88). Commercial vehicles Most BMC-era commercial vehicles were sold as Morris, but there were sometimes Austin equivalents. Radiator badges on the larger vehicles were often BMC. =Car-based light vans= A Morris Cowley MCV Van *Morris Z-series ¬º-ton (Morris Eight Series E) 1940‚Äì53 *Morris ¬º-ton O-Type (Morris Minor-based van) 1953‚Äì71 *Morris Cowley MCV (Morris Cowley#Morris Cowley MCV (1950‚Äì1956) van) 1950‚Äì56 *Austin A30 van 1954‚Äì56 *Austin A35 van 1956‚Äì68 *Austin A35 pick-up 1956‚Äì57 *Morris ¬Ω-ton (Morris Cowley#¬Ω-ton series III Series III van) 1956‚Äì62 *Austin A55 van 1958‚Äì62 *Austin A55 pick-up (Australian built) 1958‚Äì62 *Mini van 1960‚Äì82 *Mini pick-up 1961‚Äì82 *Austin A40 Farina van (export only) 1961‚Äì67 *Austin 1800 Utility (Australia built) 1967‚Äì74 =Light vans= A 1957 Morris JB Van *Austin K8 1948‚Äì1954 *Morris J-type 1949‚Äì1960 *Morris LD 1952‚Äì1968 *Morris J2 1956‚Äì1967 *Morris 250 JU 1967‚Äì *Austin/Morris J4 1960‚Äì1974 =Taxi cabs and hire cars= *Austin FX3 Taxi 1949‚Äì58 *Austin FL1 Hire Car 1949-58 *Austin FX4 Taxi 1958-82 *Austin FL2 Hire Car 1958-82 =Light lorries= *Morris LC4 1952‚Äì54 *Morris LC5 1954‚Äì60 *Morris FV-series (Series I) 1948‚Äì54 *Morris FV- series (Series II) 1954‚Äì55 *Morris FE-series (Series III) 1955‚Äì59 *Morris FG 1960‚Äì68 *Morris FM 1961‚Äì68 *Morris WE 1955‚Äì64 *Morris WF 1964‚Äì81 *Morris FF 1958‚Äì61 *Morris FH 1961‚Äì64 *Morris FJ 1964‚Äì68 *BMC VA 1958‚Äì76 BMC agricultural vehicles With the merger of the Nuffield and Austin interests, the Nuffield Organisation's tractor range, the Nuffield Universal, was incorporated into BMC. BMC abroad In the 1950s and the 1960s, BMC set up 21 plants overseas, some as subsidiaries, and some as joint ventures, to assemble its vehicles. One was British Motor Corporation (Australia) which was established in 1953 at the Nuffield Australia site on the one-time Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney.The Macquarie Dictionary of Motoring, 1986, page 62 This facility went from a marshalling area for fully imported Morris cars (Austins were up until then being assembled in Melbourne from an earlier Austin Motors establishment), to a facility for making CKD cars, to the total local fabrication and construction of vehicles, engines, and mechanicals. Denmark was a particularly strong market for BMC products in Europe. In the postwar period, the Danish government closely regulated exports and imports to maintain the country's balance of trade. High-value imports such as cars were heavily taxed. Britain bought large amounts of agricultural and meat produce from Denmark, and in response, British cars were subject to a much lower import tax than cars from other countries, making BMC products very popular in the country until the 1970s, when these regulations were relaxed. From 1963 to 1975, a company was established in Spain to produce BMC cars under licence, its name was: 'AUTHI' -'Automoviles de Turismo Hispano-Ingleses' -'Spanish- English Tourism Automobiles'. The factory was in Pamplona, Navarra, Spain, and when the production of Austin and Mini cars was discontinued, Sociedad Espa√±ola de Autom√≥viles de Turismo (SEAT), owned by the state and some banks and industrial investors, purchased the factory. After the takeover of SEAT by Volkswagen, SEAT made an 'internal' resale of the Pamplona factory, formerly Authi, to Volkswagen, which soon started producing there the 'Polo'. Government takes over The Wilson Labour government (1964‚Äì1970) came to power at a time when British manufacturing industry was in decline and decided that the remedy was to promote more mergers, particularly in the motor industry. Chrysler was already buying into the Rootes Group, Leyland Motors had acquired Standard Triumph in 1961 (and would buy Rover in 1967) and had become a major automotive force. BMC was suffering a dramatic drop in its share of the home market. Tony Benn, appointed Minister of Technology in July 1966, brought pressure to bear on the industry. =British Motor Holdings Limited= In mid-1965 BMC offered to buy its major supplier Pressed Steel and took control in September with 27,000 employees.B.M.C.-Pressed Steel's Defensive Merger The Times, 23 July 1965; pg. 17; Issue 56381B.M.C. Gets 89 p.c. Of Pressed Steel The Times, 10 September 1965; pg. 15; Issue 56423 Twelve months later, BMC merged with Jaguar Cars adding a further 7,000 employees.\\"...after lengthy and cordial discussions with Sir George Harriman, we have mutually agreed to a merger of our two organisations\\" Letter to suppliers by Sir William Lyons, July 1966 On 14 December 1966 BMC shareholders approved the change of its name to British Motor Holdings (BMH) and it took effect from that date. =British Leyland= Little more than 12 months later in January 1968, under pressure from the Labour British Government and Minister of Technology Tony Benn, a further wave of mergers occurred in the British car industry. BMH merged with the Leyland Motor Corporation (LMC) to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC).¬£410m British Leyland group to storm the world market The Times, Thursday 18 January 1968; pg. 17; Issue 57152 BMC Ltd (which contained most of the operations of the former British Motor Corporation) remained a subsidiary company of BLMC after the merger, although its name was changed to \\"Austin-Morris Ltd\\" shortly after, and the BMC name subsequently disappeared from public view. Within the new conglomerate, the various marques were grouped together into two main divisions, based largely on the original BMC and LMC businesses; with the former mass market BMC marques becoming part of the Austin-Morris division of BLMC, whilst LMC stablemates Rover and Triumph became part of the Specialist Division, of which Jaguar was also officially part. This basic structure remained in place right up until the creation of the Austin Rover Group in the early 1980s, by which time BLMC had been nationalised and renamed British Leyland Limited.Government takes over the restyled Leyland, British Leyland today joins the ranks of nationalized industries The Times, Monday 11 August 1975; pg. 13; Issue 59471 (later just BL plc), although by this time both Jaguar and Land Rover had been placed in their own independent subsidiaries which were separate from the old BMC/LMC divisions. Post mortem Following the merger with Leyland, a review of company records undertaken with the support of the new board, author Graham Turner stated that at the time of the merger, 16 versions of the Mini were being produced, yielding an average profit of just ¬£16 per car, while every Morris Minor sold lost the group ¬£9 and every Austin Westminster sold lost ¬£17. This helps to explain why the Westminster and Minor were among the early casualties of the merger, as well as the introduction of the Mini Clubman, capable of being built for less, but sold for more than a standard Mini thanks to simplified (\\"modernised\\") front panels. Even the UK's best seller, the Austin/Morris 1100, had to be subjected to an emergency cost-reduction programme which removed about ¬£10 from the cost of each car, applying changes that included the omission of lead sealing from body joints (¬£2.40 per car), removing provision for optional reversing lamps (¬£0.10) and \\"changes in body finish\\" (¬£0.75). Rebuilding the Cowley plant to include \\"new automated body building facilities\\" saved ¬£2.00 in transport costs per car for bodies that no longer needed to be transported from the corporation's Swindon plant and in the longer term further transport costs were saved by concentrating assembly of the model at a single plant, rather than splitting it between plants at Cowley and Longbridge. Because of the high proportion of auto-production costs represented by fixed costs that needed to be allocated over a planned production volume, and the use in the 1960s of investment appraisal criteria that were ill-suited to accounting for volume fluctuations and the rapidly changing value of the UK currency in the 1960s, the precise figures quoted may be open to challenge, but the new management's diagnosis that BMC's profitability was insufficient to fund support and new model investment to cover its disparate range of brands and models was hard to refute. Throughout the 1960s, the failure of the United Kingdom to join the European Economic Community meant that the company could not exploit the lucrative European markets due to high import tariffs, whereas BMC's key rivals Ford and General Motors both had German subsidiaries producing and selling within the bloc, and were therefore immune from those import tariffs. Life after death In 2002, BMC (Turkey), a Turkish commercial vehicle builder, originally set up by the British Motor Corporation to build its designs under licence in the 1950s, began exporting its vehicles to Britain. This allowed the return of the BMC brand to British roads for the first time in over 40 years.

It was formed as a result of a merger of several small republican parties, including notably Diego Martinez Barrio's Radical Democratic Party founded in May 1934 by a split from Alejandro Lerroux's Radical Party in protest at the latter's alliance with the right-wing CEDA. Integrated in the Popular Front ahead of the 1936 election, the party won 38 seats becoming the fourth largest party. It formed a governing coalition with Manuel Aza√±a's Republican Left. Though it participated in all republican governments during the Spanish Civil War, it played a minor role starting under Largo Caballero's government. In exile in Mexico, it was the main support of the Republican government-in-exile until it was dissolved in 1959 to found the Spanish Democratic Republican Action along with the Republican Left.

Simple devices such as blindfolds or hoods and earmuffs can cut off sight and hearing, while more complex devices can also cut off the sense of smell, touch, taste, thermoception (heat-sense), and the 'feeling' of gravity. Sensory deprivation has been used in various alternative medicines and in psychological experiments (e.g. with an isolation tank). Short-term sessions of sensory deprivation are described as relaxing and conducive to meditation; however, extended or forced sensory deprivation can result in extreme anxiety, hallucinations, bizarre thoughts, temporary senselessness, and depression.Stuart Grassian Psychiatric effects of solitary confinement(PDF) This article is a redacted, non-institution- and non-inmate- specific version of a declaration submitted in September 1993 in Madrid v.

In this case a constant uniform stimulus is used instead of attempting to remove the stimuli; this leads to effects which have similarities to sensory deprivation. Sensory deprivation techniques were developed by some of the armed forces within NATO, as a means of interrogating prisoners within international treaty obligations. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the use of the five techniques by British security forces in Northern Ireland amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment. Restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST) There are many different numbers of basic methods of restricted environmental stimulation, including therapy (REST), chamber REST, and flotation REST. =Chamber REST= In chamber REST, the subject lies on a bed in a completely dark and sound- reducing (on average, 80 dB) room for up to 24 hours. Their movement is restricted by the experimental instructions, but not by any mechanical restraints. Food, drink, and toilet facilities are provided in the room and are at the discretion of the tester, who can communicate with the participants using an open intercom. Subjects are allowed to leave the room before the 24 hours are complete; however, fewer than 10% actually do because they find the chamber so relaxing. Chamber REST affects psychological functioning (thinking, perception, memory, motivation, and mood) and psychophysiological processes. =Flotation REST= Flotation tank with flip top lid opened In flotation REST, the room contains a tank or pool. The flotation medium consists of a skin-temperature solution of water and Epsom salts at a specific gravity that allows for the patient to float supine without worry of safety. In fact, to turn over while in the solution requires \\"major deliberate effort.\\" Fewer than 5% of the subjects tested leave before the session duration ends, which is usually around an hour for flotation REST. For the first 40 minutes, it is reportedly possible to experience itching in various parts of the body (a phenomenon also reported to be common during the early stages of meditation). The last 20 minutes often end with a transition from beta or alpha brain waves to theta, which typically occur briefly before sleep and again at waking. In a float tank, the theta state can last for several minutes without the subject losing consciousness. Some use the extended theta state as a tool for enhanced creativity and problem solving. Spas sometimes provide commercial float tanks for use in relaxation. Flotation therapy has been academically studied in the US and in Sweden with published results showing reductions of both pain and stress. The relaxed state also involves lowered blood pressure, lowered levels of cortisol, and maximal blood flow. Apart from physiological effects, REST seems to have positive effects on well-being and performance.Dirk van Dierendonck & Jan te Nijenhuis - Flotation restricted environmental stimulation therapy (REST) as a stress- management tool: A meta-analysis =Chamber versus flotation REST= Several differences exist between flotation and chamber REST. For example, with the presence of a medium in flotation REST, the subject has reduced tactile stimulation while experiencing weightlessness. The addition of Epsom salts to attain the desired specific gravity may have a therapeutic effect on hypertonic muscles. Since one of the main results of chamber REST is a state of relaxation, the effects of chamber REST on arousal are less clear-cut, which can be attributed to the nature of the solution. Also, due to the inherent immobilization that is experienced in flotation REST (by not being able to roll over), which can become uncomfortable after several hours, the subject is unable to experience the session durations of chamber REST. This may not allow the subject to experience the changes in attitudes and thinking that are associated with chamber REST. Additionally, the research questions asked between each technique are different. Chamber REST questions stemmed from research that began in the 1950s and explored a variety of questions about the need for stimulation, nature of arousal and its relationship with external stimulation. Practitioners in this area have explored its utility in the treatment of major psychiatric dysfunctions such as substance abuse. On the contrary, flotation REST was seen as more of a recreational tool as it was tested more for its use with stress-related disorders, pain reduction and insomnia. Numerous studies have debated which method is a more effective treatment process, however, only one has explored this statistically. Nineteen subjects, all of whom used chamber or flotation REST to induce relaxation or treat smoking, obesity, alcohol intake, or chronic pain were analyzed. The statistic of interest, d, is a measure of the size of the treatment effect. For reference, d=0.5 is considered a moderate effect and d=0.8 a large effect. The 19 subjects who underwent chamber REST had d=0.53 and six flotation REST subjects showed d=0.33. Additionally, when examining subjects undergoing REST treatment and REST in conjunction with another treatment method, there was little difference.. However, Flotation REST has the advantage of a lower duration required (45 minutes as opposed to 24 hours). Other uses The use of REST has been explored in aiding in the cessation of smoking. In studies ranging between 12 months and five years, 25% of REST patients achieved long-term abstinence. REST, when combined with other effective smoking cessation methods (for example: behavior modification) resulted in long-term abstinence of 50%. Also, when combined with weekly support groups, REST resulted in 80% of patients achieving long-term abstinence. Comparatively, the use of a nicotine patch alone has a success rate of 5%. Alcoholism has also been the target of research associated with REST. In conjunction with anti-alcohol educational messages, patients who underwent two hours of REST treatment reduced alcohol consumption by 56% in the first two weeks after treatment. The reduction in consumption was maintained during follow-ups conducted three and six months after the first treatment. It is, however, possible that this is caused by the placebo effect. In addition, REST has been tested to determine its effect on users of other drugs. A University of Arizona study used chamber REST as a complement to traditional outpatient substance abuse treatment and found that four years later, 43% of the patients were still sober and drug-free. Eight months later, no one in the control group remained clean. =Psychedelic effects= Studies have been conducted to test the effect of sensory deprivation on the brain. One study took 19 volunteers, all of whom tested in the lower and upper 20th percentiles on a questionnaire which measures the tendency of healthy people to see things not really there, and placed them in a pitch-black, soundproof booth for 15 minutes, after which they completed another test that measures psychosis-like experiences, originally used to study recreational drug users. Five subjects reported seeing hallucinations of faces; six reported seeing shapes/faces not actually there; four noted a heightened sense of smell, and two reported sensing a \\"presence of evil\\" in the room. People who scored lower on the first test experienced fewer perceptual distortions; however, they still reported seeing a variety of hallucinations. Many studies have been conducted to understand the main causes of the hallucinations, and considerable evidence has been accumulated indicating that long periods of isolation aren't directly related to the level of experienced hallucinations. Marvin Zuckerman & Nathan Cohen (1964). Sources of Reports of Visual Auditory Sensations in perceptual-isolation experiments. Schizophrenics appear to tend to experience fewer hallucinations while in REST as compared to non-psychotic individuals. A possible explanation for this could be that non-psychotic individuals are normally exposed to a greater degree of sensory stimulation in everyday life, and in REST, the brain attempts to re-create a similar level of stimulation, producing the hallucinatory events.From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis According to a 2009 study published in the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, the hallucinations are caused by the brain misidentifying the source of what it is currently experiencing, a phenomenon called faulty source monitoring. A study conducted on individuals who underwent REST while under the effects of Phencyclidine (PCP) showed a lower incidence of hallucination in comparison to participants who did not take PCP. The effects of PCP also appeared to be reduced while undergoing REST. The effects PCP has on reducing occurrences of hallucinatory events provides a potential insight into the mechanisms behind these events.From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis =Interrogation= Sensory deprivation has been used to disorientate subjects during interrogation, brainwashing, and torture. In particular, the five techniques of wall-standing; hooding; subjection to noise; deprivation of sleep; deprivation of food and drink were used by the security forces in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s. After the Parker Report of 1972, these techniques were formally abandoned by the United Kingdom as aids to the interrogation of paramilitary suspects. The Irish government on behalf of the men who had been subject to the five methods took a case to the European Commission of Human Rights (Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1976 Y.B. Eur. Conv. on Hum. Rts. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights)). The Commission stated that it \\"considered the combined use of the five methods to amount to torture.\\"Security Detainees/Enemy Combatants: U.S. Law Prohibits Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Footnote 16David Weissbrodt materials on torture and other ill-treatment: 3. European Court of Human Rights (doc) html: Ireland v. United Kingdom, 1976 Y.B. European Convention on Human Rights. 512, 748, 788-94 (European Commission of Human Rights) This consideration was overturned on appeal, when in 1978 the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) examined the United Nations' definition of torture. The court subsequently ruled that the five techniques \\"did not occasion suffering of the particular intensity and cruelty implied by the word torture,\\" however they did amount \\"to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment,\\" which is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 3.Ireland v. the United Kingdom (1978), paragraph 167 In their judgmentIreland v. the United Kingdom (1978), paragraph 96 the court states that: :These methods, sometimes termed \\"disorientation\\" or \\"sensory deprivation\\" techniques, were not used in any cases other than the fourteen so indicated above. It emerges from the Commission's establishment of the facts that the techniques consisted of:'' ::* wall-standing: forcing the detainees to remain for periods of some hours in a stress position, described by those who underwent it as being \\"spreadeagled against the wall, with their fingers put high above the head against the wall, the legs spread apart and the feet back, causing them to stand on their toes with the weight of the body mainly on the fingers\\"; ::* hooding: putting a black or navy colored bag over the detainees' heads and, at least initially, keeping it there all the time except during interrogation; ::* subjection to noise: pending their interrogations, holding the detainees in a room where there was a continuous loud and hissing noise; ::* deprivation of sleep: pending their interrogations, depriving the detainees of sleep ::* deprivation of food and drink: subjecting the detainees to a reduced diet during their stay at the center and pending interrogation > See also *Isolation to facilitate abuse *Sensory overload *Apophenia > *Enhanced interrogation techniques *Human experimentation in the United > States *Ganzfeld effect *Ganzfeld experiment *Johnny Got His Gun *Prisoner's > cinema *Dark retreat *THX 1138 *John C.

He was the author of many influential books about beer and whisky. He was a regular contributor to a number of British broadsheets, particularly The Independent and The Observer.The Daily Telegraph (London), 1 September 2007, Obituary of Michael Jackson Writer who tirelessly examined and championed beer and later became an equal authority on malt whisky, p29 Jackson's books have sold over three million copies worldwide and have been translated into eighteen different languages. He is credited with helping to start a renaissance of interest in beer and breweries worldwide in the 1970s, particularly in the United States. He is also widely credited with popularising the idea of beer styles. His influential television series The Beer Hunter was shown in fifteen different countries. He was as well-versed in malt whisky as he was in beer, and his book Michael Jackson's Malt Whisky Companion (1989) is the best-selling book on the subject in the world. At the time of his death Jackson had been suffering from Parkinson's disease for at least a decade. He did not declare his illness until his symptoms caused some to think he was drunk. Life Jackson was born in Wetherby, West Riding of Yorkshire. His father had Anglicised his Lithuanian Jewish surname Jakowitz to Jackson. The family moved to Leeds after the war. He went to King James's Grammar School, Almondbury and became a journalist, particularly being associated with Edinburgh, where he first encountered whisky. On his return to London he briefly edited the advertising trade journal Campaign. Michael Jackson became known in beer circles in 1977 when his book The World Guide To Beer was first published. This was later translated into more than ten languages and is still considered to be one of the most fundamental books on the subject.Article by Jeff Evans in Brewery History The modern theory of beer style is largely derived from this book, in which Jackson categorised a variety of beers from around the world in local style groups suggested by local customs and names. His work had a special influence on the popularisation of the brewing culture in North America, and in 1989 he hosted a television series entitled The Beer Hunter, which was shown on Channel 4 in the UK and the Discovery Channel. It involved several episodes in which Jackson would visit a different country. Episodes featured beer barrels being lined with pitch or iron foundry workers drinking 'light' beer while they worked in hot conditions to quench thirst, practices which he knew were likely to be ended soon. Jackson considered beer as a component of culture and described beers in their cultural context. Although he travelled around the world and discovered different beer cultures, he was especially fond of the Belgian beers. He was appointed to an honorary officer of the Ridderschap van de Roerstok in 1997 for his important contribution to the international success of the Belgian beers. This honour had previously only been given to brewers. In 1998, Jackson brought forth his own line of beer glassware. Shortly after, Jackson also helped create and worked with the only beer club he ever endorsed, Michael Jackson's Rare Beer Club. Michael Jackson's beer glassware (from left to right): summer glass, tasting glass, snifter, session glass Jackson was also an important reviewer of whiskies. In his book The Malt Whisky Companion, he reviewed a large number of whiskies and gave them marks from 0‚Äì100, considering only those with a score above seventy-five worth purchasing. In many ways, his work in the world of whisky exceeded his significance as a beer writer. He was arguably the most important writer on whisky since the Victorian commentator Alfred Barnard and certainly the most significant and influential modern whisky writer. This was recognised by the award of \\"Master of the Quaich\\" and the prodigious sale of his whisky books and sell-out attendances at his tastings. He had a large influence on the development of single malt whisky globally. Apart from his work as a journalist and a critic, he was also a fan of Rugby league.Obituary, Yorkshire Post It was revealed in December 2006 that Jackson had been suffering for at least a decade from Parkinson's disease.

Fried eggs are traditionally eaten for breakfast in many countries but may also be served at other times of the day.  Regional adaptations and specialities  = Austria, Germany, and Switzerland = Vegeta spice in Croatia Two eggs with blue cheese on a plate Fried eggs (', singular ') are a crucial part of such traditional German dishes as ' (the egg is fried on one side with an unbroken yolk, and served \\"sunny side up\\" atop an open ham sandwich) or ' / ' / Fernfahrerschnitzel (\\"trucker's schnitzel\\") ‚Äì a similarly prepared fried egg served on a '. Fried eggs over (or side-by-side with) pan-fried potatoes is another common dish, sometimes served with spinach as a third component of the meal. Some German cooks break the yolk and distribute it across the surface of the white during the frying. All of the above are typically lunch, rather than breakfast, dishes, although eggs themselves (like boiled or scrambled eggs) are a common part of a German breakfast. = Cambodia and Vietnam = In Cambodia, fried egg is often served on top a common dish called loklak. It is made of a ring of spinach, onion finely shaven, and tomato with either a portion of venison or beef with gravy, topped with a fried egg, either duck or chicken egg. In Vietnam, a fried egg served over white rice, topped with a dab of oyster or hoisin sauce, is also popular in east Asia. Fried eggs are also sometimes used in a Vietnamese breakfast roll. = Czech Republic = Fried egg prepared sunny side up is known as \\"volsk√© oko\\" or \\"buliƒç√≠ oko\\" (bull's eye) in Czech cuisine and they are served either alone as part of breakfast, or for lunch with side of spinach and boiled potatoes. = Egypt = In Egypt, fried eggs are a common breakfast food. They are fried in fat such as vegetable oil, butter or ghee and served either plain or with other foodstuffs such as tomatoes, cheese, sausage or minced meat with onions and spices; they may also be served with ful medames (slow-cooked fava beans). = India = In India, fried eggs are commonly served alone or as an accompaniment to bread. It may also occasionally be served with dosa, paratha, or roti. During or after the frying stage, they are sometimes sprinkled lightly with condiments such as black pepper, chili powder, green chili, and salt. A fried egg is commonly referred to as a \\"poached egg\\" in Indian English. In central and northern India's English-speaking middle classes and mid-level restaurants, \\"single-fried\\" refers to sunny side up (also known as a \\"bullseye\\") and \\"double-fried\\" to over hard. Street food parlance uses \\"half-fry\\" as a base term with \\"half fry bina palti\\" (un-flipped) meaning sunny side up and \\"half fry palti maarke\\" or \\"alti palti\\" (flipped) meaning over easy/medium/hard where the customer oversees the flip and says when. = Indonesia = Mi Goreng noodle served with fried egg and vegetables. In Indonesia, fried eggs are served either as telur ceplok or telur mata sapi (Indonesian for \\"bull's eye egg\\") which refer to sunny side up eggs, as telur dadar (omelette) or as telur orak-arik (scrambled eggs). The fried eggs are either setengah matang which is half cooked with still runny yolk or matang which is well done. When speaking English, an Indonesian waiter may ask if you want the egg fried \\"one side\\" or \\"two sides\\". Fried eggs, especially as bull's eye egg, is a popular toppings for Indonesian fried rice (nasi goreng) and fried noodle (mie goreng), either freshly prepared noodle or cooked from instant noodle Indomie Mi goreng. A simple dish of fried sunny side up egg, served on top of steamed rice drizzled with kecap manis sweet soy sauce, is a favourite dish among Indonesian children. Other than served with rice, fried eggs might be served with bread as sandwich for breakfast. Seasoning include salt and pepper, sweet soy sauce, sometimes hot and spicy sambal chili paste. = Ireland and the United Kingdom = full English breakfast includes bacon, fried egg, black pudding, grilled tomatoes, fried mushrooms, hash browns (not traditional), baked beans, and sausages. Fried eggs can be served on toast, or in a sandwich, with bacon, sausages, and a variety of condiments. Eggs are often part of the full breakfast commonly eaten in Britain and Ireland. Fried eggs are often served with ham or gammon steak as a popular pub meal. The egg is cooked on a high heat and hot fat, oil or water may be splashed onto the top of the egg to baste it and cook the white. They are usually cooked without turning over. Sometimes the egg is turned to ensure the white is thoroughly cooked (\\"over easy\\", though this is more an American phrase), but the egg is almost always served with the yolk runny. = Latin America, Portugal, and Spain = In Portugal and Brazil, a runny egg placed over a steak with a side dish of rice and black beans is called a ', literally \\"horse-riding steak\\". A similar dish, with the name ' in Spanish, is also common in Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay (called churrasco); fried potatoes and salad replace the beans and rice. In Chile and Peru, a fried egg is included in ', ', ', and several other dishes. In Ecuador, llapingachos include a sunny side up egg served over pan-seared cheesy mashed potatoes and fried sausage. In northern Mexico, ' (riding eggs) are served with refried beans and fried potatoes (or french fries). Another common method of serving eggs in Mexico is ', which blends fried eggs with diced tomato, onion and green chili pepper; the amount of pepper added is often to order. There are several other egg dishes in Mexico which combine different ingredients: Huevos motule√±os (in Yucat√°n), ' (mixed with refried beans), and ' (sunny side up eggs served over a corn tortilla, covered with spicy salsa). Also, in some parts of Mexico, fried eggs are served with a fresh tomato, onions, and cilantro salsa. Red chili is optional, as is a blended sauce. In Spain fried eggs (huevos fritos) are a common dish. They are eaten alone, with meat, or with sausages. In this country, a fried egg served with boiled rice covered in tomato sauce is called arroz a la cubana in Spanish and the same dish is served in parts of Latin America, Italy (so- called occhio di bue, transl: ox's eye), the Philippines, and Portugal as well. Poet Nazƒ±m Hikmet says, in an interview, that he stayed with a Spanish friend for a month and ate fried eggs almost every day.

It is a common lunch dish served in many cafes, canteens, and lunch rooms in the Netherlands. ' literally means \\"out-thrower\\", and it is also a Dutch word for a \\"bouncer\\". = Nigeria = What is known as \\"scrambled eggs\\" in the U.S. and U.K. is called \\"fried eggs\\" in Nigeria, while what is known as \\"fried eggs\\" in the U.S. and U.K. would be known as \\"half-fried eggs\\" in Nigeria. The mai shai stalls cook scrambled eggs to the point of being heavily crisp. = Philippines = Spam with rice and eggs is a common meal in the Philippines In the Philippines, fried eggs are often cooked like a sunny-side egg but the yolk is half cooked - referred to as malasado (from the Spanish, meaning undercooked) - by sprinkling it with salt and oil while being fried, giving it a distinctive pink-colored membrane.

Fried rice is also popularly accompanied with a fried egg, such as with khao phat Amerikan and khao phat (standard Thai-style fried rice). Another popular way of eating fried eggs in Thailand is to use it as the main ingredient of the Thai salad called yam khai dao. = United States = Ham and eggs served with fried eggs prepared \\"sunny side up\\" Americans use different terms to describe the degree and method to which fried eggs are cooked, including: ; over easy or over light : Cooked on both sides; the yolk is runny and the egg white is fully cooked. ; over medium : Cooked on both sides; the yolk is cooked through but soft and near liquid at the center. The egg white is thoroughly cooked. ; over hard or over well : Cooked on both sides all the way through, with the yolk intact. ; sunny side up : Cooked on one side only, until the egg white is set, but the yolk remains liquid. This is often known simply as eggs up. Gently splashing the hot cooking oil or fat over the sunny side uncooked white (i.e., basting) may be done to thoroughly cook the white. Covering the frying pan with a lid during cooking (optionally adding a cover and half-teaspoon of water just before finishing) allows for a less \\"runny\\" egg, and is an alternative method to flipping for cooking an egg over easy (this is occasionally called sunny side down or basted). Sunny side up eggs are also commonly referred to as dippy eggs or dip eggs by Pennsylvania Dutch people living in central Pennsylvania, in parts of Ohio, and in Pittsburgh mainly due to the practice of dipping toast into the yolk while eating. This term is also occasionally used in Canada. They are also sometimes called moon eggs by those residing in eastern Maryland.  Egg in the basket  Eggs in the basket This dish is usually made by cutting a circle or other shape out of a slice of bread, often using a drinking glass or biscuit cutter. The bread is fried until brown on one side and then flipped, and an egg is broken into the center and seasoned, usually with salt and pepper, and sometimes herbs. The pan is then covered, and the egg is cooked until the white is just set. The cutout center of the bread is often fried as well, and served alongside or on top of the finished egg.

In 1937, Nin and the rest of the POUM leadership was arrested by the Moscow-oriented government of the Second Spanish Republic on trumped up charges of collaborating with Francisco Franco's Nationalists and tortured to death by Soviet NKVD agents.https://libcom.org/history/how-nkvd-framed-poum On 17 June 2013, 76 years after his death, the Parliament of Catalonia officially paid homage to him and his work on politics with special emphasis to his work as the first Justice Minister of Catalonia. Early life Born in El Vendrell, Tarragona, to a poor family (his father was a shoemaker and his mother was a peasant), Nin moved to Barcelona shortly before World War I; he taught briefly in a secular anarchist school, but soon became a journalist and activist. In 1917, he joined the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE). Nin became a leader of the Spanish workers' movement, and was among the founders of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE). He consequently worked for the Comintern and Red International of Labour Unions (RILU or Profintern) in the Soviet Union. While in Russia, he was won over to the Left Opposition which confronted Joseph Stalin's ascending faction within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. He briefly worked as secretary to Leon Trotsky while in Russia. It was during this time he also began translating several Trotsky works into Spanish and Catalan. Returning to Spain, Nin was instrumental in forming the Communist Left of Spain (ICE), the self-designated Trotskyist group affiliated to the International Left Opposition (ILO). However, the ICE was a small group and largely isolated. Nin had a number of disagreements with Trotsky in this period, specifically when Trotsky advised the ICE leader that entry into the Socialist Youth of Spain would augment the forces at their disposal, while Nin advocated forming a united party with the Workers and Peasants Bloc (BOC), a group coming out of the communist movement but seen as being on its right wing. POUM Eventually Nin broke with Trotsky and the ILO on this question, and the merger went ahead. Together with Joaqu√≠n Maur√≠n, he formed the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) in 1935, as a communist alternative to the Comintern-aligned PCE. After the region of Catalonia saw its regional government, the Generalitat, reinstated by the Spanish Republic in the opening phase of the Spanish Civil War, Nin joined the devolved government headed by Llu√≠s Companys, as regional minister of Justice. However, as Spain's communists gained sway in the Republican government, they moved to purge ex-communists and those independent of Moscow from the government, which would include POUM. Following a threat from Soviet consul Vladimir Antonov- Ovseenko to withhold Soviet aid, Companys sacked Nin from his cabinet on 16 December 1936, concluding a controversial tenure. =Arrest and disappearance= Plaque to Nin on the public library on La Rambla, Barcelona Following the violent May Days of Barcelona, on 16 June 1937, the government, under PCE pressure, declared POUM illegal. On the orders of Alexander Orlov, Nin and most of the POUM leadership were arrested and sent to a camp at Alcal√° de Henares, near Madrid. Nin was tortured for several days under the supervision of the NKVD. Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez Tom√°s, then a member of the Communist Party, and Minister of Education in the Popular Front government, later wrote: He was finally executed on 20 June 1937. Another account suggests German members of the (PCE-run) International Brigades killed Nin in a fake Nazi \\"liberation,\\" but others have suggested he was taken to the Soviet Union for execution. Regardless, Nin's fate was kept secret by those involved, resulting in a POUM campaign asking Juan Negr√≠n's new government: Gobierno Negr√≠n: ¬ød√≥nde est√° Nin? (\\"To the government of Negr√≠n: where is Nin?\\"). One of the first to raise the issue in public was Federica Montseny, Minister for Health. In reply, the PCE proclaimed: En Salamanca o en Berl√≠n (\\"Either in Salamanca or Berlin\\"), elaborating the slander campaign alleging that Nin was a fascist. (Franco's headquarters were in Salamanca; Berlin was the capital of Nazi Germany).

Retrieved 21 January 2016. ECFA website Franklin Graham drew scrutiny in 2009 for drawing a full- time salary from Samaritan's Purse, while simultaneously receiving a full-time salary from Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA). This was called into question after his 2008 compensation from both organizations totaled $1.2 million. (Most of this was the result of a new IRS rule that required him to re-report deferred retirement contributions that had already been reported over the previous three years.) Some experts on non-profit organisations have questioned whether one person can perform two full-time jobs leading organizations that employ hundreds and spend hundreds of millions around the world. In response to the questions about his compensation, Graham decided to give up his salary from BGEA, stating his calling to the ministry \\"was never based on compensation.\\" He also had contributions to his retirement plans suspended until the economy bounced back. However, Graham was again criticized in 2015 when it was revealed he had again taken up his salary from BGEA, and that his annual compensation was significantly higher than that of the CEO's of similar but much larger non-profit organisations Political activism and controversies Warsaw (June 14, 2014) = 2011 end times speculation = In a March 2011 interview with Newsmax, Graham said the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan \\"may be\\" the second coming and Armageddon. = Support of the Iraq War = Graham, a supporter of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, came under criticism for comments he made about Islam in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks when he referred to Islam as \\"a very evil and wicked religion.\\" Further criticism came on April 18, 2003, when he preached at a Good Friday service at the Pentagon. Graham has made controversial remarks against Islam saying \\"True Islam cannot be practiced in this country,\\" to CNN's Campbell Brown in December 2009. \\"You can't beat your wife. You cannot murder your children if you think they've committed adultery or something like that, which they do practice in these other countries.\\"CNN: Graham disinvited from prayer event over Islam comments. April 23, 2010. On April 22, 2010 after objections from the Military Religious Freedom Foundation and the Muslim group Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations (CAIR), the Pentagon rescinded his invitation from the Christian conservative National Day of Prayer Task Force to speak at a Pentagon National Day of Prayer event. In the August 30, 2010, issue of Time magazine, \\"Does America Hate Islam?\\", Graham reportedly said that Islam \\"is a religion of hatred. It's a religion of war.\\" Building the cultural center near Ground Zero, he says, means Muslims \\"will claim now that the World Trade Center property ... is Islamic land.\\" On Iraq, Graham says he is, \\"poised and ready\\" to send representatives of the charity he runs to Iraq as soon as possible. While the purpose is humanitarian aid, Graham also admits, \\"I believe as we work, God will always give us opportunities to tell others about his Son. ... We are there to reach out to love them and to save them, and as a Christian, I do this in the name of Jesus Christ.\\" = Barack Obama (2009‚Äì2017) = On August 19, 2010, when asked by CNN correspondent John King if he had doubts that President Barack Obama is a Christian, Graham stated, \\"I think the president's problem is that he was born a Muslim; his father was a Muslim. The seed of Islam is passed through the father like the seed of Judaism is passed through the mother. He was born a Muslim, his father gave him an Islamic name.\\" Graham continued, \\"Now it's obvious that the president has renounced the prophet Mohammed, and he has renounced Islam, and he has accepted Jesus Christ. That's what he says he has done. I cannot say that he hasn't. So I just have to believe that the president is what he has said.\\" In a March 2011 interview with the conservative Internet publication Newsmax, Graham claimed that Obama had \\"allowed the Muslim Brotherhood to become part of the U.S. government and influence administration decisions,\\" asserting that:Corn, David (March 22, 2011) Franklin Graham's New Obama-Muslim Conspiracy Theory, Mother Jones > The Muslim Brotherhood is very strong and active in our country.

And many of these > people we've brought in, I'm afraid, are under the Muslim Brotherhood. In an open letter response, Graham apologized to President Obama, saying, \\"I regret any comments I have ever made which may have cast any doubt on the personal faith of our president, Mr. Obama. The president has said he is a Christian and I accept that.\\" In the open letter closing Graham stated, \\"In this election season and challenging economic time I am praying for our country and for those who lead it‚Äîfor we are commanded in Scripture to do so.\\" Graham has commented on Hinduism as well, saying, \\"no elephant with 100 arms can do anything for me.

In September 2010, Graham stated on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour that building churches and synagogues is forbidden in most countries in the Islamic world. = Donald Trump (2017‚Äìpresent) = In April 2011, Graham told ABC's This Week program that Donald Trump, who had recently declared an interest in the Republican nomination for the 2012 U.S. presidential race, was his preferred candidate. During an MSNBC Morning Joe interview on February 21, 2012, Graham said that Rick Santorum was most closely aligned to Christian values in his words and deeds and that Senator Santorum was certainly a Christian at heart. On President Obama, Graham said that he is \\"a fine man\\" but could not know whether the president was a Christian in his heart. Asked about Mitt Romney, Graham said that most Protestants do not view Mormonism as a Christian faith. On February 28, 2012, Graham responded to a one-page letter sent by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) as an: \\"Open Letter from Leaders of Faith Regarding Statements by Franklin Graham.\\" In the introduction to the one-page letter the fourteen signatories stated: \\"we are greatly troubled by recent attempts by some religious leaders to use faith as a political weapon. We were disturbed and disappointed by statements made by Rev. Franklin Graham during an interview on MSNBC that questioned whether President Obama is a Christian.\\" In closing, the open- letter stated: \\"We call on Rev. Graham and all Christian leaders to exemplify this essential teaching of Jesus and refrain from using Christianity as a weapon of political division.\\" In June 2016, Graham told a crowd, \\"I have zero hope for the Democratic Party; I have no hope for the Republican Party. I am running a campaign to put God back in the political process.\\"In St. Paul, evangelist Franklin Graham holds 'no hope' for either party Nevertheless, in November 2016, Graham told The Washington Post that God had played a role in Donald Trump's election as U.S. president, saying: \\"I could sense going across the country that God was going to do something this year. And I believe that at this election, God showed up.\\" The same newspaper noted that the day after Trump's victory, Graham had posted a comment on Facebook in which he wrote, \\"Did God show up? [‚Ä¶] In watching the news after the election, the secular media kept asking 'How did this happen?' 'What went wrong?' 'How did we miss this?' Some are in shock. Political pundits are stunned. Many thought the Trump/Pence ticket didn't have a chance. None of them understand the God- factor.\\" At the Inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2017, Graham chose to read a passage from Paul's First Epistle to Timothy, chapter 2, which calls for prayers for all people, including \\"kings and for all those in authority, that we may live peacefully quiet lives in all godliness and holiness.\\" Since the election, Graham has \\"become known, above all, as the most vociferous evangelical ally\\" of Trump. He has strongly opposed the impeachment process, calling it an \\"unjust inquisition.\\" In a November 21, 2019, interview with Eric Metaxas, Graham suggested opposition to Trump was the work of a \\"demonic power.\\" In December, when Christianity Today magazine, founded by Graham's father Billy, published an editorial calling Trump \\"profoundly immoral\\" and supporting his removal from office, Graham responded by saying his father had voted for Trump and saw him as the \\"man for this hour in history for our nation\\" and that the magazine was \\"representing the elitist liberal wing of evangelicalism\\". = Support for conversion therapy = Graham spoke against a bill proposing to ban conversion therapy, referring to homosexuality as \\"an abomination.\\" He also compared conversion therapy to Conversion to Christianity. = North Carolina Amendment 1 = Graham supported North Carolina Amendment 1, which was passed by a voter referendum on May 8, 2012, prohibiting same-sex marriage and all domestic partnerships.WXII12.com: Franklin Graham backing N.C. marriage amendment. April 28, 2012. Graham responded to Obama's May 9, 2012, statement of support for same-sex marriage, saying, \\"President Obama has, in my view, shaken his fist at the same God who created and defined marriage. It grieves me that our president would now affirm same-sex marriage, though I believe it grieves God even more.\\"Billy Graham Evangelistic Organization: Franklin Graham Response to the President's Support of Same-Sex Marriage. May 10, 2012. In December 2017, several British MPs urged the Home Secretary to consider refusing UK entry to Graham from speaking at an event due to take place in Blackpool in September 2018. As Graham represents the evangelical community, critics argued that those who want to ban Graham which means that individuals who have different opinions of LGBT rights would be banned in the UK. Gordon Marsden, a Labour openly gay MP suggested that Graham's comments may have contravened British laws on hate speech. As of February 2018, a petition against Graham being granted a visa had gathered more than 7,500 signatures. The pastor of Liberty Church in Blackpool, who organised the petition, said: \\"As a Christian and as a leader of a church that particularly welcomes LGBT people, I'm horrified that other local churches are inviting someone with this record of hate speech.\\" The pastor said that Graham's visit had triggered an \\"enormous amount of protest from Christians in the north-west\\" of England, and his presence would be \\"extremely destructive in the area\\". = Buttigieg tweets = After South Bend, Indiana mayor Pete Buttigieg became the first openly gay man to announce a run for the 2020 Democratic nomination for President against President Donald Trump, Graham attacked Buttigieg for his homosexuality and marriage to another gay man in April 2019, tweeting \\"Mayor Buttigieg says he's a gay Christian. As a Christian I believe the Bible which defines homosexuality as sin, something to be repentant of, not something to be flaunted, praised or politicized. The Bible says marriage is between a man & a woman‚Äînot two men, not two women.\\" The tweet was one of three in a thread. The tweet was met with a strong negative response against Graham, much of which condemned Graham as a hypocrite for selective criticism of a Democratic candidate's perceived wrongdoings while remaining silent on those of the incumbent Republican. MSNBC host Joe Scarborough denounced Graham on his Morning Joe program, saying, \\"Just shut up Franklin Graham! You are a disgrace! You are a disgrace for normalizing Donald Trump's behavior.\\" The Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin rebuked Graham as a \\"hypocritical bigot\\" who \\"has rationalized Trump's infidelity and racism, ignored his lies, cheered his inhumane immigration policy and behaved as a political hack rather than a religious leader,\\" also writing \\"Buttigieg gets the benefit of being attacked by a right-winger whom progressives revile, gets to underscore a message of generational change and acceptance and gets to demonstrate what a class act he is. The other candidates must be wondering why some GOP hatemonger doesn't attack them.\\" Opinion pieces in the National Review, The Charlotte Observer, and The Arizona Republic were also critical of Graham's comments. =Praise of Vladimir Putin= Graham defended Russian President Vladimir Putin's \\"gay propaganda\\" law and has praised his leadership for \\"protecting children from any homosexual agenda or propaganda.\\" =Duke University prayer call= On January 14, 2015, Duke University canceled plans to have an amplified Muslim call to prayer played each Friday from the top of its chapel bell tower. Media outlets, including Fox News and CBS, credit Graham for organizing a campaign that garnered more than 70,000 \\"Likes\\" on Facebook, calling on the university to cancel the call to prayer and lobbying alumni to boycott the school if they did not.\\"CBS This Morning Blames Cancellation of Muslim Prayer Event at Duke on Franklin Graham\\" Media Research Center, January 15, 2015. = UK tour 2020 = All venues booked for Franklin Graham's planned eight-city 2020 UK tour cancelled his booking after protests by LGBTQ+ activists, petitions and requests from local councils. Many said statements Graham had made were incompatible with their values, and that his appearance would be divisive, could be disruptive or lead to a breach of the peace. His organisation said it would seek other venues.

Historically, the Kingdom of Portugal and the Kingdom of England, and later the modern Portuguese Republic and United Kingdom, have never waged war against each other nor have they participated in wars on opposite sides as independent states since the signing of the Treaty of Windsor. While Portugal was subsumed under the Iberian Union, rebellious Portuguese factions and government in exile sought refuge and help in England. England spearheaded the Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604) on the side of the deposed Portuguese royal house. The alliance has served both countries throughout their respective military histories, influencing the participation of the United Kingdom in the Peninsular War, the UK's major land contribution to the Napoleonic Wars and the establishment of an Anglo-American base in Portugal. Portugal aided England (and later the UK) in times of need, for example, in the First World War. Today, Portugal and the United Kingdom are both part of NATO, a larger intergovernmental military alliance between several North American and European states that accounts for over 70% of total global military spending. Middle Ages John of Gaunt being entertained by John I of Portugal. English aid to the House of Aviz (which ruled Portugal from 1385 to 1580) set the stage for Portuguese cooperation with England that would become a cornerstone of Portugal's foreign policy for more than five hundred years. However, English aid to Portugal went back much further to the 1147 Siege of Lisbon, when English and other northern European crusaders ‚Äì en route to the Holy Land to participate in the Second Crusade ‚Äì stopped and helped Portuguese King Afonso Henriques to conquer the city from the Moors. In May 1386, the Treaty of Windsor sealed the alliance ‚Äì first started in 1294, renewed in the Anglo-Portuguese Treaty of 1373 and confirmed at the Battle of Aljubarrota (1385) ‚Äì with a pact of perpetual friendship between the two countries. The most important part of the treaty stated that: In July 1386, John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, son of the late king Edward III of England and father of the future King Henry IV of England, landed in Galicia with an expeditionary force to press his claim to the Crown of Castile with Portuguese aid. He failed to win the support of the Castilian nobility and returned to England with a cash compensation from the rival claimant. John of Gaunt left behind his daughter, Philippa of Lancaster, to marry King John I of Portugal (February 1387) in order to seal the Anglo- Portuguese alliance. By this marriage, John I became the father of a generation of princes called by the poet Lu√≠s de Cam√µes the \\"Illustrious Generation\\", which led Portugal into its golden age, during the period of the Discoveries. Philippa brought to the court the Anglo-Norman tradition of an aristocratic upbringing and gave her children good educations. Her personal qualities were of the highest standard, and she reformed the court and imposed rigid standards of moral behaviour. On the other hand, the more tolerant Portuguese aristocracy saw her methods as too traditional or outdated. Philippa provided royal patronage for English commercial interests that sought to meet the Portuguese desire for cod and cloth in return for wine, cork, salt, and oil shipped through the English warehouses at Porto. Her eldest son, Duarte, authored moral works and became king in 1433; Pedro, who travelled widely and had an interest in history, became regent (1439-1448) after Duarte died of the plague in 1438; Ferdinand the Saint Prince (1402-1443), who became a crusader, participated in the attack on Tangiers in 1437; and Henrique ‚Äì also known as Prince Henry the Navigator (1394-1460) ‚Äì became the master of the Order of Christ and the instigator and organiser of Portugal's early voyages of discovery. Disruption and renewal The Iberian Union (1580‚Äì1640), a 60-year dynastic union between Portugal and Spain, interrupted the alliance. The struggle of Elizabeth I of England against Philip II of Spain in the sixteenth century meant that Portugal and England were on opposite sides of the Anglo-Spanish War (1585‚Äì1604) and the Dutch‚ÄìPortuguese War. Portuguese foreign policy became tied to Spanish hostility to England. However in 1640 England supported the Portuguese House of Braganza to take power in Portugal replacing the House of Habsburg, putting an end to a 60-year dynastic union between Portugal and Spain. England's support for Portugal during their Restoration War was confirmation of the renewal of the alliance. This was solidified further after the English Restoration and the marriage of Catherine of Braganza and Charles II of England. Portugal ceded Tangier and Bombay as part of the dowry. England in addition to military support on the ground would protect Portuguese shipments in the Mediterranean and the coasts of Lisbon and Porto. Following the defeat of Spain in the war, England mediated the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668 which saw the independence of Portugal and the recognition of Pedro II as King. The English alliance was decisive in the consolidation of the independence of Portugal, and in Pedro's leadership. In return Portugal compromised to transfer to the English the majority of the places recovered from the Dutch, to share in half the commerce of cinnamon and to install English families with the same privileges of the Portuguese families in Goa, Cochin, Diu, Bahia, Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro. 17th to 19th centuries Allegory of George III of the United Kingdom and John VI of Portugal, by Joaquim Carneiro da Silva (1810). It is accompanied by a poem: \\"Immortal trophies George's throne surround: Here Envy crush'd, and there Ambition bound Braganza's line by Gratitude combin'd Clears fast to Brunswick's ever closely twin'd.\\" The alliance was reconfirmed after the breakup of the Iberian Union, primarily due to both countries' respective rivalries with Spain, the Netherlands, and France, both in Europe and overseas. During this time, important episodes in the alliance were: * The War of Spanish Succession, when Portugal together with the Duchy of Savoy initially sided with France, but after the Battle of Blenheim reunited with its ally. * The Seven Years' War, when Spain invaded Portugal in 1762, Britain intervened as Portugal's ally. Although faced with vastly superior numbers, the Portuguese and British forces together with Portuguese guerrillas defeated the Spanish and French forces, which suffered huge losses despite three invasion attempts overall. * The Napoleonic Wars, when Portugal, isolated in a Europe wholly dominated by Napoleon, continued to trade with the United Kingdom despite French restrictions and was finally invaded, but with British help finally regained total sovereignty and independence. The Portuguese royal family at the time (including Prince John, at the time acting as regent for his mother, the aged and mentally impaired Queen Maria I) took refuge in its then vice-royalty of Brazil, under escort by the British fleet. * The Portuguese civil war, when the United Kingdom gave important support to the Liberal faction. * The 1890 British Ultimatum was considered by Portuguese historians and politicians at that time to be the most outrageous and infamous action of the British against their oldest ally. The 1890 ultimatum was said to be one of the main causes for the Republican Revolution, which ended the monarchy in Portugal 20 years later. 20th century During the 20th century, the treaty was invoked several times: =First World War= * After German incursions in Portuguese East Africa (today Mozambique), Portuguese troops fought on the Western Front alongside Allied soldiers during the First World War. =Second World War= * Upon the declaration of war in September 1939, the Portuguese Government announced on 1 September that the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance remained intact, but since the British did not seek Portuguese assistance, Portugal would remain neutral. In an aide-m√©moire of 5 September 1939, the British Government confirmed the understanding. British strategists regarded Portuguese non-belligerency as \\"essential to keep Spain from entering the war on the side of the Axis.\\" * Britain recognised the important role of the anti-democratic and authoritarian prime minister Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Salazar on May 15, 1940, when Douglas Veale, Registrar of the University of Oxford, informed Salazar that the University's Hebdomadal Council had \\"unanimously decided at its meeting last Monday, to invite you [Salazar] to accept the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Civil Law\\". * July 1940: Salazar's decision to stick with the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance allowed the Portuguese island of Madeira to help the Allies: that month, around 2,500 Gibraltar evacuees were shipped to Madeira. * September 1940: Winston Churchill wrote to Salazar, congratulating him on his ability to keep Portugal out of the war, asserting that \\"as so often before during the many centuries of the Anglo- Portuguese alliance, British and Portuguese interests are identical on this vital question\\". * Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood, the British Ambassador in Madrid from 1940 to 1944, recognised Salazar's crucial role in keeping Iberia neutral during the war. Lord Templewood asserted that in his thirty years of political life he had met most of the leading statesmen of Europe and that he placed Salazar very high on the list of those who impressed him. He stated that Salazar \\"being a man of one idea ‚Äì the good of his country ‚Äì he was convinced that the slightest step from the narrow path of neutrality would endanger the work of national regeneration to which he had devoted the whole of his public life\\". He also affirmed that \\"Salazar detested Hitler\\", that the Portuguese r√©gime differed fundamentally from Nazism and Fascism, and that Salazar never left a doubt in his mind that he desired a Nazi defeat. * During the Second World War, Salazar steered Portugal down a middle path, but nevertheless provided aid to the Allies. The British Ambassador in Lisbon, Ronald Campbell, saw Salazar as fundamentally loyal to the Alliance and stated that \\"he [Salazar] would answer the call if it were made on grounds of dire necessity\\". When, in August 1943, the British requested base facilities in the Azores and invoked the alliance that had existed for over 600 years between Portugal and Great Britain,Winston Churchill, 12 October 1943 Statement in the House of Commons Salazar responded favourably and virtually at once: Portugal granted naval bases on Portuguese territory to Britain, in keeping with the traditional Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, letting them use the Azorean ports of Horta (on the island of Faial) and Ponta Delgada (on the island of S√£o Miguel), and the airfields of Lajes Field (on Terceira Island) and Santana Field (on S√£o Miguel Island).Kay, p.123 * In November 1943, the British Ambassador in Lisbon, Sir Ronald Campbell, wrote (paraphrasing Salazar) that \\"strict neutrality was the price the allies paid for strategic benefits accruing from Portugal's neutrality and that if her neutrality instead of being strict had been more benevolent in our favour Spain would inevitably have thrown herself body and soul into the arms of Germany. If this had happened the Peninsula would have been occupied and then North Africa, with the result that the whole course of the war would have been altered to the advantage of the Axis.\\"Leite, \\"Document 2: Telegram From Sir Ronald Campbell * From November 1943, when the British gained the use of the Azores, to June 1945, 8,689 U.S. aircraft departed from Lajes base in the Azores, including 1,200 B-17 and B-24 bomber aircraft which were ferried across the Atlantic. Cargo aircraft carried vital personnel and equipment to North Africa, to the United Kingdom and ‚Äì after the Allies gained a foothold in Western Europe ‚Äì to Orly Field near Paris. Flights returning from Europe carried wounded servicemen. Medical personnel at Lajes, Azores, handled approximately 30,000 air evacuations en route to the United States for medical care and rehabilitation. By using Lajes Field, it was possible to reduce flying time between the United States and North Africa from 70 hours to 40. This considerable reduction in flying hours enabled aircraft to make almost twice as many crossings per month between the United States and North Africa and clearly demonstrated the geographic value of the Azores during the war. =Postwar= * The establishment of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) took place in 1960 following the establishment of the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1957. Portugal and the UK were two of the seven founding members of EFTA. In 1973 the UK left EFTA to join the EEC. Portugal did the same in 1986. * During the 1982 Falklands War, the facilities of the Azores were again offered to the Royal Navy. Modern times Today, as both countries are members of NATO, their relations are largely coordinated through those institutions, rather than by the bilateral treaty.

Its origins date back to 1919 when Roy W. Allen set up a roadside drink stand to offer a new thick and creamy drink, root beer, at a parade honoring returning World War I veterans in Lodi, California. Allen's employee Frank Wright partnered with him in 1922 and they founded their first restaurant in Sacramento, California, in 1923. The company name was taken respectively from the initials of their last names‚ÄîAllen and Wright. The company became famous in the United States for its \\"frosty mugs,\\" where the mugs would be kept in the freezer and eventually get filled with A&W; Root Beer before they were served to customers. Evolving into a franchise in 1926, the company today has locations throughout much of the world with each serving a typical fast-food menu of hamburgers, French fries, and hot dogs. A number of outlets serve as drive-in restaurants that have carhops. Previously owned by Yum! Brands, the chain was sold in December 2011 to a consortium of A&W; franchisees through A Great American Brand, LLC. A&W; restaurants in Canada have been part of a separate and unaffiliated chain since 1972. History An American A&W; restaurant in Page, Arizona On June 20, 1919, Roy W. Allen opened his first root beer stand in Lodi, California. Four years later, A&W; began when Allen and Frank Wright opened their drive-in restaurant in Sacramento, California, combining both of their initials for the name, and selling the root beer from Allen's stand. Curbside service was provided by tray boys and tray girls. In 1924, Allen purchased Frank Wright's stake in the business. In 1925, Allen began franchising the root beer, while the franchisee added the other menu items and operated at their discretion. This may have arguably been the first successful food-franchising operation. Allen sold the company in 1950 and retired. A 1950s A&W; Burger Family display in Hillsboro, Oregon In the expansion years of the 1950s and 1960s, franchisees were signing 20- or 25-year contracts under the older model. The chain expanded into Canada in 1956, opening restaurants in Winnipeg and Montreal. By 1960, A&W; had 2,000 restaurants. In 1963, the chain opened its first store on Okinawa. In the following years, the chain branched into other foreign markets, including the Philippines and Malaysia. Dale Mulder opened up a Lansing, Michigan, A&W; franchise in 1961. Mulder added to his menu in 1963 the bacon cheeseburger after a customer made repeated orders for bacon to be added to his cheeseburger. Thus A&W; is credited with inventing the bacon cheeseburger. In 1963, the company was sold again, followed by another sale in 1967 to United Fruit Co. conglomerate. AMK Corporation purchased United Fruit in 1970. Then AMK formed United Brands Company to hold A&W.; In 1971, A&W; Beverages Inc.‚Äîa beverage subsidiary‚Äîbegan supplying bottled A&W; products to grocery stores. The bottled products would become available nationally. In 1972, A&W;'s Canadian division was sold to Unilever. In the 1970s, A&W; had more stores than McDonald's, with a peak in 1974 of 2,400 units. Oshkosh, Wisconsin, franchise manager Jim Brajdic said: \\"Problems back then, including a lawsuit, franchisee discontent and inconsistencies in the operation, caused the chain to flounder and branches to close.\\" A&W; moved to a modern style franchise agreement which introduced royalty payments and new standards. However, as their 20- or 25-year original agreements expired, many franchisees refused the revised terms. A&W; in the 1980s began offering the Third Pounder to compete with McDonald's Quarter Pounder. The Third beat the Quarter in taste test and was less expensive. All of this was cited in the marketing of the burger. Possibly customers assumed that the Third Pounder had less meat than the Quarter Pounder, thus refusing to buy it. In 1982, A. Alfred Taubman purchased A&W; and placed under Taubman Investment Co. Taubman only purchased the restaurant company and not A&W; Beverages. The chain dropped to fewer than 500 locations in the mid-1980s. A freeze on issuing franchises was put in place. A new format concept, A&W; Great Food Restaurants, was developed. Ten corporate- owned locations were opened to test the concept, which was a sit-down, upscale, family-theme restaurant with a large salad bar and homemade ice cream. In 1987, the company was headquartered in Livonia, Michigan and Mulder became CEO and president. The freeze was lifted and a push occurred in 1986 that added 60 franchise units. In 1989, A&W; made an agreement with Minnesota- based Carousel Snack Bars to convert that chain's 200 stores (mostly kiosks in shopping malls) to A&W; Hot Dogs & More. Some A&W; Hot Dogs & More are still operating. In 1995, Taubman sold A&W; to Sidney Feltenstein. A&W; merged with Long John Silver's to form Yorkshire Global Restaurants based in Lexington, Kentucky. Yorkshire in 2000 agreed to test multi-branded locations with Tricon Global Restaurants. By March 2002, the Yorkshire-Tricon multi-branding test consisted of 83 KFC/A&Ws;, six KFC/Long John Silver's and three Taco Bell/Long John Silver's and was considered successful by the companies. In the late 2000s, A&W; added franchises with a nostalgic look and modern technology. They have a carhop design with drive-thrus and some have picnic tables. =Yum! Brands subsidiary= A co-branded A&W; and Long John Silver's in Gillette, Wyoming In March 2002, Tricon Global announced the acquisition of Yorkshire and name change to Yum! Brands. A&W; opened its first outlet in Bangladesh on 15 December 2010. There are currently two outlets; one in Dhanmondi and another in Gulshan. Most A&W; stores that opened in the U.S. during Yum!'s ownership were co-branded with another of Yum!'s chains‚ÄîLong John Silver's, Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, or KFC. =A Great American Brand subsidiary= In January 2011, Yum! Brands announced its intention to sell A&W; along with Long John Silver's. Citing poor sales for both divisions, Yum! planned to focus on international expansion for its remaining brands, with particular emphasis on growth in China. In September 2011, Yum! announced that it would sell the chain to A Great American Brand, a consortium of various A&W; franchisees in the United States and overseas. The sale was finalized on December 19, 2011, under the leadership of returning CEO Kevin M. Bazner. In early 2013, A&W; introduced its first new product in several years: a six-ounce version of its soft-serve blended dessert treat. Mini Polar Swirls were the first product to be launched on Vine. The following summer, 250 of A&W;'s restaurants began hand-breading their chicken tenders, moving towards higher-quality menu items and expanding their chicken category. In April 2014, the Hand-Breaded Chicken Tender Texas Toast Sandwich was added to the menu as a limited time offering, along with a campaign to create the world's longest branded hashtag. In June 2014, A&W; launched two new flavors of its Polar Swirl dessert treat: Sour Patch Kids and Nutter Butter. In October 2013, A&W; opened its first new concept restaurant, A&W; Burgers Chicken Floats. The new concept focuses on fresh made-to-order food and heavily emphasizes customer service. The menu features burgers made with fresh beef and a choice of toppings, hand-breaded chicken tenders, all beef hot dogs and several sides. In April 2019, A&W; returned to Singapore after a 16-year absence. In June 2019, A&W; became the first franchise restaurant chain to turn 100. There are nearly 1,000 A&W; Restaurants worldwide with approximately 600 in the U.S. Mascots The roadside sign in front of the Middlebury, Vermont, location In the 1960s, a character named Chubby Chicken appeared on all Chubby burgers. In 1963, A&W; introduced four choices of hamburgers and their corresponding Burger Family members: Papa Burger, Mama Burger, Teen Burger, and Baby Burger. Each burger had a wrapper featuring a cartoon image of the corresponding character. Rooty, the Great American Root Bear, originated in Canada in 1974 as a counter to the competition to Ronald McDonald of McDonald's and first appeared in the United States in 1976. However, the character's introduction was almost aborted when marketing received focus group research results that reported a poor reaction to him . In reaction, the Marketing Director, acting on instinct about the appeal of the character, ordered the researcher to return to Toronto with the cover story that he never presented that report. The researcher complied and Rooty was presented to the franchisees as is. As such, Rooty proved a popular marketing success. Throughout the 1970s, '80s, and '90s, Rooty was the face of A&W;, both the bottled drinks and the restaurant chain, on television and print advertising. His presence all but disappeared in the late 1990s, but in 2011, under new ownership, Rooty has come out of retirement. He has since been featured in print ads, on A&W;'s website, as the voice of their official Twitter account, and in a variety of YouTube and Vine videos. In 2013, Rooty became the first mascot to have an official LinkedIn profile, which was quickly shut down as Rooty was not considered \\"real\\" by the authorities at Linkedin. In 1998, the characters from the comic strip \\"Blondie\\", including Blondie and Dagwood Bumstead, were licensed for use at A&W; franchisees as part of an \\"All American Food\\" campaign.

There are several varieties of grills, with most falling into one of three categories: gas-fueled, charcoal, or electric. There is debate over which method yields superior results. History in the Americas Grilling has existed in the Americas since pre-Colonial times. The Arawak people of South America roasted meat on a wooden structure called a barbacoa in Spanish. For centuries, the term barbacoa referred to the wooden structure and not the act of grilling, but it was eventually modified to \\"barbecue\\". It was also applied to the pit-style cooking techniques now frequently used in the southeastern United States. Barbecue was originally used to slow-cook hogs; however, different ways of preparing food led to regional variations. Over time, other foods were cooked in a similar fashion, with hamburgers and hot dogs being recent additions. The LazyMan Model AP, the world's first portable gas grill. Taken during the summer of 1954. Edward G. Kingsford invented the modern charcoal briquette. Kingsford was a relative of Henry Ford who assigned him the task of establishing a Ford auto parts plant and sawmill in northern Michigan, a challenge that Kingsford embraced. The local community grew and was named Kingsford in his honor. Kingsford noticed that Ford's Model T production lines were generating a large amount of wood scraps that were being discarded. He suggested to Ford that a charcoal manufacturing facility be established next to the assembly line to process and sell charcoal under the Ford name at Ford dealerships. Several years after Kingsford's death, the chemical company was sold to local businessmen and renamed the Kingsford Chemical Company. George Stephen created the iconic hemispherical grill design, jokingly called \\"Sputnik\\" by Stephen's neighbors. Stephen, a welder, worked for Weber Brothers Metal Works, a metal fabrication shop primarily concerned with welding steel spheres together to make buoys. Stephen was tired of the wind blowing ash onto his food when he grilled so he took the lower half of a buoy, welded three steel legs onto it, and fabricated a shallower hemisphere for use as a lid. He took the results home and following some initial success, started the Weber-Stephen Products Company. The gas grill was invented in the late 1930s by Don McGlaughlin, owner of the Chicago Combustion Corporation, known today as LazyMan. McGlaughlin invented the first built-in grill from the successful gas broiler called BROILBURGER. These first Lazy-Man grills were marketed as \\"open-fire charcoal-type gas broilers\\" which featured \\"permanent coals\\", otherwise known as lava rock.Popular Mechanics, June 1957, page 97. In the 1950s, most residential households did not have a barbecue, so the term broiler was used for marketing purposes to commercial establishments. The gas open-broiler design was adapted into the first portable gas grill in 1954 by Chicago Combustion Corporation as the Model AP. McGlaughlin's portable design was the first to feature the use of the 20-lb propane cylinders, which previously were exclusively used by plumbers as a fuel source.  Electric grill  Electric grill in use. With an electric grill, the heating comes from an electric heating element. Neither coal nor briquettes is needed. Gas grills A single-burner propane gas grill that conforms to the cart grill design common among gas grills. Gas- fueled grills typically use propane or butane (liquified petroleum gas) or natural gas as their fuel source, with the gas flame either cooking food directly or heating grilling elements which in turn radiate the heat necessary to cook food. Gas grills are available in sizes ranging from small, single steak grills up to large, industrial sized restaurant grills which are able to cook enough meat to feed a hundred or more people. Some gas grills can be switched between using liquified petroleum gas and natural gas fuel, although this requires physically changing key components including burners and regulator valves. The majority of gas grills follow the cart grill design concept: the grill unit itself is attached to a wheeled frame that holds the fuel tank. The wheeled frame may also support side tables, storage compartments, and other features. A recent trend in gas grills is for manufacturers to add an infrared radiant burner to the back of the grill enclosure. This radiant burner provides an even heat across the burner and is intended for use with a horizontal rotisserie. A meat item (whole chicken, beef roast, pork loin roast) is placed on a metal skewer that is rotated by an electric motor. Smaller cuts of meat can be grilled in this manner using a round metal basket that slips over the metal skewer. Another type of gas grill gaining popularity is called a flattop grill. According to Hearth and Home magazine, flattop grills \\"on which food cooks on a griddlelike surface and is not exposed to an open flame at all\\" is an emerging trend in the outdoor grilling market. A small metal \\"smoker box\\" containing wood chips may be used on a gas grill to give a smoky flavor to the grilled foods. Barbecue purists would argue that to get a true smoky flavor (and smoke ring) the user has to cook low and slow, indirectly and using wood or charcoal; gas grills are difficult to maintain at the low temperatures required (~225-250 ¬∞F), especially for extended periods. Infrared grills An ignited Infrared grill burner, only seeing the visible light spectrum. Infrared grills work by igniting a gas fuel to heat a ceramic tile, causing it to emit infrared radiation by which the food is cooked. The thermal radiation is generated when heat from the movement of charged particles within atoms is converted to electromagnetic radiation in the infrared heat frequency range. Infrared grills allow users to more easily adjust cooking temperature than charcoal grills, and are usually able to reach higher temperatures than standard gas grills, making them popular for searing items quickly. Charcoal grills Charcoal grills use either charcoal briquettes or natural lump charcoal as their fuel source. When burned, the charcoal will transform into embers radiating the heat necessary to cook food. There is contention among grilling enthusiasts on what type of charcoal is best for grilling. Users of charcoal briquettes emphasize the uniformity in size, burn rate, heat creation, and quality exemplified by briquettes. Users of all-natural lump charcoal emphasize its subtle smoky aromas, high heat production, and the lack of binders and fillers often present in briquettes. There are many different charcoal grill configurations. Grills can be square, round, or rectangular, some have lids while others do not, and they may or may not have a venting system for heat control. The majority of charcoal grills, however, fall into the following categories: =Brazier= A brazier grill loaded with fresh charcoal briquettes. The simplest and most inexpensive of charcoal grills, the brazier grill is made of wire and sheet metal and composed of a cooking grid placed over a charcoal pan. Usually the grill is supported by legs attached to the charcoal pan. The brazier grill does not have a lid or venting system. Heat is adjusted by moving the cooking grid up or down over the charcoal pan. Even after George Stephen invented the kettle grill in the early 1950s, the brazier grill remained a dominant charcoal grill type for a number of years. Brazier grills are available at most discount department stores during the summer. =Pellet grill= Pellet grills are fueled by compressed hardwood pellets (sawdust compressed with vegetable oil or water at approx. 10k psi) that are loaded into a hopper and fed into a fire box at the bottom of the grill via an electric powered auger that is controlled by a thermostat. The pellets are lit by an electric ignitor rod that starts the pellets burning and they turn into coals in the firebox once they burn down. Most pellet grills are a barrel shape with a square hopper box at the end or side. The advantage of a pellet grill is its temperature versatility. It can be set on a \\"smoke\\" mode where it burns at for slow smoking. It can also be set at to slow cook or barbecue meats (like brisket, ribs and hams) or cranked up to a temperature of for what would be considered low temperature grilling. Some high-end pellet grills can reach up to for searing. It is one of the few grills that is actually a smoker, a barbecue and a grill. The best pellet grills can hold steady temperatures for more than ten hours. Many use solid diffuser plates between the firebox and grill to provide even temperature distributions. Most pellet grills burn 1/2 to 1 pound of pellets per hour at , depending on the \\"hardness\\" of the wood, ambient temperature and how often the lid is opened. Most hoppers hold 10 to 20 pounds of wood pellets. Pellets in a wide variety of woods including:hickory, oak, maple, apple, alder, mesquite, and grapevine, etc., and can be used, or mixed, for desired smoke flavoring. Pellet technology is widely used in home heating in certain parts of North America. Softer woods including pine are often used for home heating. Pellets for home heating are not cooking grade and should not be used in pellet grills. =Square charcoal= The square charcoal grill is a hybrid of the brazier and the kettle grill. It has a shallow pan like the brazier and normally a simple method of adjusting the heat, if any. However, it has a lid like a kettle grill and basic adjustable vents. The square charcoal grille is, as expected, priced between the brazier and kettle grill, with the most basic models priced around the same as the most expensive braziers and the most expensive models competing with basic kettle grills. These grills are available at discount stores and have largely displaced most larger braziers. Square charcoal grills almost exclusively have four legs with two wheels on the back so the grill can be tilted back using the handles for the lid to roll the grill. More expensive examples have baskets and shelves mounted on the grill. =Shichirin (hibachi)= Various Japanese traditional shichirin (Tokyo Egota), made from diatomite The traditional Japanese hibachi is a heating device and not usually used for cooking. In English, however, \\"hibachi\\" often refers to small cooking grills typically made of aluminum or cast iron, with the latter generally being of a higher quality. Owing to their small size, hibachi grills are popular as a form of portable barbecue. They resemble traditional, Japanese, charcoal-heated cooking utensils called shichirin. Alternatively, \\"hibachi- style\\" is often used in the U.S. as a term for Japanese teppanyaki cooking, in which gas-heated hotplates are integrated into tables around which many people (often multiple parties) can sit and eat at once. The chef performs the cooking in front of the diners, typically with theatrical flair‚Äîsuch as lighting a volcano-shaped stack of raw onion hoops on fire. In its most common form, the hibachi is an inexpensive grill made of either sheet steel or cast iron and composed of a charcoal pan and two small, independent cooking grids. Like the brazier grill, heat is adjusted by moving the cooking grids up and down. Also like the brazier grill, the hibachi does not have a lid. Some hibachi designs have venting systems for heat control. The hibachi is a good grill choice for those who do not have much space for a larger grill, or those who wish to take their grill traveling. Binch≈ç-tan is most suitable for fuel of shichirin. =Kettle= Two charcoal kettle grills, a small tabletop model, and a freestanding model. The kettle grill is considered the classic American grill design. The original and often-copied Weber kettle grill was invented in 1951 by George Stephen. It has remained one of the most commercially successful charcoal grill designs to date. Smaller and more portable versions exist, such as the Weber Smokey Joe. The kettle grill is composed of a lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, lower chamber, venting system, and legs. Some models include an ash catcher pan and wheels. The lower chamber that holds the charcoal is shaped like a kettle, giving the grill its name. The key to the kettle grill's cooking abilities is its shape. The kettle design distributes heat more evenly. When the lid is placed on the grill, it prevents flare-ups from dripping grease, and allows heat to circulate around the food as it cooks. It also holds in flavor-enhancing smoke produced by the dripping grease or from smoking wood added to the charcoal fire. The Weber kettle grill has bottom vents that also dispatch ash into a pan below the bowl. Most kettle grills can be adapted for indirect cooking. The kettle design allows the griller to configure the grill for indirect cooking (or barbecuing) as well. For indirect cooking, charcoal is piled on one or both sides of the lower chamber and a water pan is placed in the empty space to one side or between the charcoal. Food is then placed over the water pan for cooking. The venting system consists of one or more vents in the bottom of the lower chamber and one or more vents in the top of the lid. Normally, the lower vent(s) are to be left open until cooking is complete, and the vent(s) in the lid are adjusted to control airflow. Restricted airflow means lower cooking temperature and slower burning of charcoal. =Cart= The charcoal cart grill is quite similar in appearance to a typical gas grill. The cart grill can be rectangular or kettle in design, has a hinged lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, and is mounted to a cart with wheels and side tables. Most cart grills have a way to adjust heat, either through moving the cooking surface up, the charcoal pan down, through venting, or a combination of the three. Cart grills often have an ash collection drawer for easy removal of ashes while cooking. Their rectangular design makes them usable for indirect cooking as well. Charcoal cart grills, with all their features, can make charcoal grilling nearly as convenient as gas grilling. Cart grills can also be quite expensive. =Barrel= In its most primitive form, the barrel grill is nothing more than a steel barrel sliced in half lengthwise. Hinges are attached so the top half forms the lid and the bottom half forms the charcoal chamber. Vents are cut into the top and bottom for airflow control. A chimney is normally attached to the lid. Charcoal grids and cooking grids are installed in the bottom half of the grill, and legs are attached. Like kettle grills, barrel grills work well for grilling as well as true barbecuing. For barbecuing, lit charcoal is piled at one end of the barrel and food to be cooked is placed at the other. With the lid closed, heat can then be controlled with vents. Fancier designs available at stores may have other features, but the same basic design does not change. =Ceramic cooker= The ceramic cooker design has been around for roughly 3,000 years. The shichirin, a Japanese grill traditionally of ceramic construction, has existed in its current form since the Edo period however more recent designs have been influenced by the mushikamado now more commonly referred to as a kamado. The ceramic cooker is more versatile than the kettle grill as the ceramic chamber retains heat and moisture more efficiently. Ceramic cookers are equally adept at grilling, smoking, and barbecuing foods. =Tandoor oven= A tandoor is used for cooking certain types of Irani, Indian and Pakistani food, such as tandoori chicken and naan. In a tandoor, the wood fire is kept in the bottom of the oven and the food to be cooked is put on long skewers and inserted into the oven from an opening on the top so the meat items are above the coals of the fire. This method of cooking involves both grilling and oven cooking as the meat item to be cooked sees both high direct infrared heat and the heat of the air in the oven. Tandoor ovens often operate at temperatures above and cook the meat items very quickly. =Portable charcoal= Portable charcoal grills are small but convenient for traveling, picnicking, and camping. This one is loaded with lump charcoal. The legs fold up and lock onto the lid so it can be carried by the lid handle. The portable charcoal grill normally falls into either the brazier or kettle grill category. Some are rectangular in shape. A portable charcoal grill is usually quite compact and has features that make it easier to transport, making it a popular grill for tailgating. Often the legs fold up and lock into place so the grill will fit into a car trunk more easily. Most portable charcoal grills have venting, legs, and lids, though some models do not have lids (making them, technically, braziers.) There are also grills designed without venting to prevent ash fallout for use in locations which ash may damage ground surfaces. Some portable grills are designed to replicate the function of a larger more traditional grill/brazier and may include spit roasting as well as a hood and additional grill areas under the hood area.  Portable Backpack Grills  These type of grills are super lightweight and portable so they can be fold down and worn inside a regular backpack. Usually, the backpack is provided with the grill. They are the variations of portable charcoal grills. Hybrids A hybrid grill is a grill used for outdoor cooking with charcoal and natural gas or liquid propane and can cook in the same manner as a traditional outdoor gas grill. The manufacturers claim that it combines the convenience of an outdoor gas grill with the flavor and cooking techniques of a charcoal and wood grill. In addition to providing the cooking heat, the gas burners in a hybrid grill can be used to quickly start a charcoal/wood fire or to extend the length of a charcoal/wood cooking session. Some of the newer hybrid stoves cater more towards the emergency preparedness/survivalist market with the ability to use propane, charcoal or wood. Generally, they have a propane burner that can be removed and charcoal or wood substituted as the fuel source. Many have features similar to the portable charcoal grill with a volcano shaped cooking chamber for efficiency, the ability to be folded or collapsed for a smaller footprint and a carrying case for easy portability. Commercial grills A commercial barbecue typically has a larger cooking capacity than traditional household grills, as well as featuring a variety of accessories for added versatility. End users of commercial barbecue grills include for-profit operations such as restaurants, caterers, food vendors and grilling operations at food fairs, golf tournaments and other charity events, as well as competition cookers. The category lends itself to originality, and many commercial barbecue grills feature designs unique to their respective manufacturer. Model Mobile-SLPX Commercial Barbecue Grill Commercial barbecue grills can be stationary or transportable. An example of a stationary grill is a built-in pit grill, for indoor or outdoor use. Construction materials include bricks, mortar, concrete, tile and cast iron. Most commercial barbecue grills, however, are mobile, allowing the operator to take the grill wherever the job is. Transportable commercial barbecue grills can be units with removable legs, grills that fold, and grills mounted entirely on trailers. Trailer mounted commercial barbecue grills run the gamut from basic grill cook tops to pit barbecue grills and smokers, to specialized roasting units that cook whole pigs, chicken, ribs, corn and other vegetables. Parts Many gas grill components can be replaced with new parts, adding to the useful life of the grill. Though charcoal grills can sometimes require new cooking grids and charcoal grates, gas grills are much more complex, and require additional components such as burners, valves, and heat shields. =Burners= A gas grill burner is the central source of heat for cooking food. Gas grill burners are typically constructed of: stainless steel, aluminized steel, or cast iron, occasionally porcelain-coated. Burners are hollow with gas inlet holes and outlet 'ports'. For each inlet there is a separate control on the control panel of the grill. The most common type of gas grill burners are called 'H' burners and resemble the capital letter 'H' turned on its side. Another popular shape is oval. There are also 'Figure 8', 'Bowtie' and 'Bar' burners. Other grills have a separate burner for each control. These burners can be referred to as 'Pipe', 'Tube', or 'Rail' burners. They are mostly straight since they are only required to heat one portion of the grill. Gas is mixed with air in venturi tubes or simply 'venturis'. Venturis can be permanently attached to the burner or removable. At the other end of the venturi is the gas valve, which is connected to the control knob on the front of the grill. A metal screen covers the fresh air intake of each venturi to keep spiders from clogging the tube with their nests. =Cooking grate= Cooking grates, also known as cooking grids, are the surface on which the food is cooked in a grill. They are typically made of: *Stainless steel - usually the most expensive and longest-lasting option, may carry a lifetime warranty *Porcelain-coated cast iron - the next best option after stainless steel, usually thick and good for searing meat *Porcelain-coated steel - will typically last as long as porcelain-coated cast iron, but not as good for searing *Cast iron - more commonly used for charcoal grills, cast iron must be coated with cooking oil between uses to protect it from rusting *Chrome-plated steel - usually the least expensive and shortest- lasting material Cooking grates used over gas or charcoal barbecues will allow fat and oil to drop between the grill bars. This can cause the fat or oil to ignite in a 'flare-up', the flames from which can blacken or burn the food on the grate. In an attempt to combat this problem, some barbecues are fitted with plates, baffles or other means to deflect the dripping flammable fluids away from the burners. =Rock grate= Rock grates are placed directly above the burner and are designed to hold lava rock or ceramic briquettes. These materials serve a dual purpose - they protect the burner from drippings which can accelerate the deterioration of the burner, and they disperse the heat from the burner more evenly throughout the grill. =Heat shield= Heat shields are also known as burner shields, heat plates, heat tents, radiation shields, or heat angles. They serve the same purpose as a rock grate and rock, protecting the burner from corrosive meat drippings and dispersing heat. They are more common in newer grills. Heat shields are lighter, easier to replace and harbor less bacteria than rocks. Like lava rock or ceramic briquettes, heat shields also vaporize the meat drippings and 'infuse' the meat with more flavor. =Valves= Valves can wear out or become rusted and too difficult to operate requiring replacement. A valve is unlike a burner, a replacement valve usually must be an exact match to the original in order to fit properly. As a consequence, many grills are disposed of when valves fail due to a lack of available replacements. If a valve seems to be moving properly, but no gas is getting to the burner, the most common cause for this is debris in the venturi. This impediment can be cleared by using a long flexible object. =Cover= A barbecue cover is a textile product specially designed to fit over a grill so as to protect it from outdoor elements such as sun, wind, rain and snow, and outdoor contaminants such as dust, pollution, and bird droppings. Barbecue covers are commonly made with a vinyl outer shell and a heat-resistant inner lining, as well as adjustable straps to secure the cover in windy conditions. The cover may have a polyester surface, often with polyurethane coating on the outer surface, with polyvinyl chloride liner. Indoor grills While indoor live-fire cooking can be dangerous without heavy-duty ventilation, it is possible to simulate some of the effects of a live-fire grill with indoor equipment. Among the simplest designs is a steel or cast iron griddle, often featuring raised ridges to produce sear marks and allow fat to run off, which is placed on top of an oven hob. An ordinary frying pan can also be used.

The organization's president is Franklin Graham, son of Christian evangelist Billy Graham. The name of the organization is derived from the New Testament Parable of the Good Samaritan. Their international headquarters are in Boone, North Carolina. The organization has been criticized for requiring recipients of aid to participate in religious activities, for Graham's controversial statements, and for his compensation; in 2020 it became an honorary citizen of Cremona Lotta al coronavirus, Cremona d√† la cittadinanza a medici e infermieri americani ilgiorno.it.  History  Samaritan's Purse was founded in 1970 by Baptist pastor Robert Pierce (Bob), the founder of World Vision International, in Boone, North Carolina. Paul Battersby, Ravi Roy, W.

Lamport, Encyclopedia of Christianity in the United States, Volume 5, Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 2015 Franklin Graham met Pierce in 1973, and they made several trips together to visit relief projects and missionary partners in Asia and elsewhere. Graham became president of Samaritan's Purse in 1979 following Pierce's death in 1978. Robert Wuthnow, Boundless Faith: The Global Outreach of American Churches, University of California Press, USA, 2009, p. 136 In 2020, Samaritan's Purse has offices in Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Hong Kong, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and the organization provides assistance in more than 100 countries. According to NBC News and Gothamist, volunteers are required to adhere to a statement of faith, agreeing to a definition of marriage as \\"exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female\\" and acknowledging that \\"[God] will banish the unrighteous to everlasting punishment in hell.\\"  Programs  Samaritan's Purse includes several ongoing ministries.

A booklet of bible stories is often distributed alongside the shoebox gifts which are given to children based on need alone, regardless of their faith. These boxes are then distributed overseas by volunteers. , over 124 million boxes have been delivered. The program uses \\"follow-up\\" evangelism with pamphlets of bible stories that are given to families that receive the boxes, and an organizer for Operation Christmas Child says his goal every day is to \\"expand [God's] kingdom through Operation Christmas Child.\\" The follow-up evangelism program of Operation Christmas Child is called \\"The Greatest Journey\\". It is a 12-week discipleship program for children who receive shoebox gifts. Operation Christmas Child in the US has over 9,000 year round volunteers and over 100,000 short term volunteers. =Emergency aid= One of Samaritan's Purse planes used for the emergency transport of basic necessities and aid workers in Birmingham, England, 2019 The organisation's medical mission in Liberia, West Africa, was one of only two medical NGOs active in Liberia during the beginning of the 2014 Ebola outbreak. Samaritan's Purse and SIM USA both have been actively engaged in treating the recent outbreak of Ebola hemorrhagic fever in Liberia. On August 1, 2014, the organisation announced that it was evacuating 60 nonessential personnel from Liberia. Dr. Kent Brantly, a Texas- based doctor working for the organisation, was the first U.S. Citizen to contract the Ebola virus in Liberia while treating the disease. He arrived in the United States on Saturday, August 2, and was treated and subsequently released after nearly three weeks in a special isolation unit of Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia. The organization recorded their mission in Liberia in the documentary Facing Darkness. Samaritan's Purse has a fleet of 21 planes and 2 helicopters for the emergency transport of basic necessities and aid workers. David Cenciotti, Rare Samaritan‚Äôs Purse DC-8 Cargo Aircraft Airlifts An Emergency Field Hospital to Italy For COVID-19 Pandemic, theaviationist.com, USA, March 18, 2020  Financials  In the fiscal year ending December 2012, Samaritan's Purse generated over $376 million. Of that amount, 89.3 percent goes directly to projects; 4.3 percent is used for administrative support; and 6.2 percent is spent on fundraising. The organization has received a 4 star rating (out of 4 stars) from the monitoring organization Charity Navigator. The \\"Consolidated Statement of Activities\\" section of the organization's 2014 accountant's report lists the total revenue as $520.4 million.  Controversy  In March 2001, The New York Times reported that Samaritan's Purse had \\"blurred the line between church and state\\" in the way it had distributed publicly funded aid to victims of the El Salvador earthquake. Residents from several villages stated they first had to sit through a half-hour prayer meeting before receiving assistance. In a statement, USAID said Samaritan's Purse had not violated federal guidelines, but emphasized the need for the organization to \\"maintain adequate and sufficient separation\\" between prayer sessions and publicly-funded activities. In 2003, Islamic leaders criticized Samaritan's Purse within the United Kingdom after its president, Franklin Graham, stated that Islam is a \\"very evil and wicked religion\\", leading to opposition campaigns by the Islamic leaders. Samaritan's Purse responded to accusations of being anti-Islamic by highlighting their long history of non-denominational co-operation and charity work in Baghdad without attempting to preach or proselytize. The Operation Christmas Child project has been criticized in several countries, most notably in the UK, but also in Ireland, India and Canada. In the United States, Ibrahim Hooper of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, has stated that such religion-and-relief groups are \\"using their position of power to try to persuade people to leave their faith.\\" In 2003, The British supermarket chain Co-op and South Wales Fire Service both suspended their support for the project after numerous complaints about its religious connections. Samaritan's Purse responded by stating that Christian literature was only handed out where it was deemed appropriate. Franklin Graham drew scrutiny in 2009 for drawing a full-time salary from Samaritan's Purse, while at the same time receiving a full-time salary from Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA). This was called into question after his 2008 compensation from both organizations totaled $1.2 million. (Most of this was the result of a new IRS rule that required him to re-report deferred retirement contributions that had already been reported over the previous three years.) Some experts on non-profits have questioned whether one person can perform two full-time jobs leading organizations that employ hundreds and spend hundreds of millions around the world. In response to the questions about his compensation, Graham decided to give up his salary from BGEA, stating his calling to the ministry \\"was never based on compensation.\\" He also had contributions to his retirement plans suspended until the economy bounced back. However, Graham was again criticized in 2015 when it was revealed he had again taken up his salary from BGEA, and that his annual compensation was significantly higher than that of the CEO's of similar but much larger non-profit organisations In 2010, Flavia Wagner and two Sudanese men were kidnapped while working for Samaritan's Purse in Sudan. The two men were released promptly, but Wagner was held for three months. Upon her return to the US, Wagner sued Samaritan's Purse and their security contractor, Clayton Consultants, a hostage negotiation consultancy owned by Triple Canopy, accusing the organization \\"of failing to train its security personnel adequately and of willfully ignoring warning signs that abductions were a threat to foreigners.\\" The organization settled out of court in March 2012. In August 2013, Thankyou Group announced that it will no longer support Samaritan's Purse because it is not a signatory to the code of conduct run by the Australian Council for International Development, which bans aid as a vehicle for promoting religion or political groups. In October 2014, Samaritan's Purse threatened legal action in the UK against the posters of online comments on the discussion forum Mumsnet. The resultant letters prompted one of the busiest discussions on the site's \\"Am I being Unreasonable\\" forum.  Response to the COVID-19 outbreak  = Italy = On March 17, 2020, Samaritan's Purse dispatched over 60 disaster response specialists, 20 tons of medical equipment and a field hospital to Cremona, Italy which started operations on March 20, 2020. = Alaska = Samaritans' Purse airlifted 8 tons of medical supplies to Alaska on April 7, 2020 to help provide supplies to remote communities. = New York = In cooperation with New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital, Samaritan's Purse constructed a 14 tent, 68-bed field hospital in Central Park on March 29, 2020 to increase Mount Sinai's surge capacity. Through April, over 190 people were treated there. By early May, all patients had been discharged, and there were plans to dismantle the tents.  Criticism  Before the field hospital opened, journalists, politicians and LGBTQ activists raised concerns that it was only recruiting Christian medical staff and that it would provide inadequate and discriminatory care. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio stated that the presence of Samaritan's Purse was \\"very troubling,\\" while New York State Senator Brad Hoylman told NBC News that he considered it \\"a shame that the federal government has left us in the position of having to accept charity from such bigots\\". Franklin Graham later responded to Hoylman's request for public reassurance by stating: \\"We do not make distinctions about an individual's religion, race, sexual orientation, or economic status. We certainly do not discriminate, and we have a decades-long track record that confirms just that.\\" New York City's Commission on Human Rights closed an investigation into the hospital after finding no evidence it had discriminated against patients. The group‚Äôs departure was hailed as a victory by LGBTQ rights activists. Volunteers are required to adhere to a statement of faith, agreeing to a definition of marriage as \\"exclusively the union of one genetic male and one genetic female\\" and acknowledging that \\"[God] will banish the unrighteous to everlasting punishment in hell.\\" Joint plans between Mount Sinai Hospital, Samaritan's Purse and the Episcopal Diocese of New York to convert the Cathedral of St. John the Divine into a 200-bed hospital were shelved on April 9, 2020. Although this decision was attributed at least in part to the assessment that virus-related hospitalizations had already plateaued, Bishop Andrew M.L. Dietsche of the Episcopal Diocese of New York later said that Graham's \\"exclusionary\\" and \\"narrow\\" attitude about Christianity was central to the decision. Specifically, the Samaritan's Purse requires its employees and volunteers to oppose gay marriage, which, in Dietsche's words, was incompatible with the work the New York Diocese had done \\"around the full inclusion of gay and lesbian people.\\"  References   External links  * Christian charities based in the United States Christian organizations established in the 20th century Humanitarian aid organizations International charities Charities based in North Carolina Christian organizations established in 1970 Boone, North Carolina 1970 establishments in the United States Evangelical Christian humanitarian organizations ","title":"Samaritan's Purse"},{"id":"294826","title":"Mike Leavitt"},{"id":"294827","text":"Legal positivism is a school of thought of analytical jurisprudence developed largely by legal philosophers during the 18th and 19th centuries, such as Jeremy Bentham and John Austin. While Bentham and Austin developed legal positivist theory, empiricism provided the theoretical basis for such developments to occur. The most prominent legal positivist writer in English has been H. L. A. Hart, who, in 1958, found common usages of \\"positivism\\" as applied to law to include the contentions that: * laws are commands of human beings; * there is not any necessary relation between law and morality, that is, between law as it is and as it ought to be; * analysis (or study of the meaning) of legal concepts is worthwhile and is to be distinguished from history or sociology of law, as well as from criticism or appraisal of law, for example with regard to its moral value or to its social aims or functions; * a legal system is a closed, logical system in which correct decisions can be deduced from predetermined legal rules without reference to social considerations; * moral judgments, unlike statements of fact, cannot be established or defended by rational argument, evidence, or proof (\\"noncognitivism\\" in ethics).H. L. A. Hart, \\"Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals\\" (1958) 71 Harvard Law Review 593, 601‚Äì602. Historically, legal positivism is in opposition to natural law's theories of jurisprudence, with particular disagreement surrounding the natural lawyer's claim that there is a necessary connection between law and morality.  Etymology  The term positivism is derived from Latin ponere, positum, meaning \\"to put\\". \\"Positive law\\" is that which is man-made, i.e., defined formally. Legal validity and the sources of law In the positivist opinion, the source of a law is the establishment of that law by some legal authority which is recognised socially. The merits of a law are a separate issue: it may be a 'bad law' by some standard, but if it was added to the system by a legitimate authority, it is still a law. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy summarises the distinction between merit and source like so: \\"The fact that a policy would be just, wise, efficient, or prudent is never sufficient reason for thinking that it is actually the law, and the fact that it is unjust, unwise, inefficient or imprudent is never sufficient reason for doubting it. According to positivism, law is a matter of what has been posited (ordered, decided, practiced, tolerated, etc.); as we might say in a more modern idiom, positivism is the view that law is a social construction.\\"Green, Leslie, \\"Legal Positivism\\" in The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Legal positivism does not claim that the laws so identified should be obeyed, or that necessarily there is value in having clear, identifiable rules (although some positivists may also make these claims). Indeed, the laws of a legal system may be quite unjust, and the state may be quite illegitimate; as a result, there may be no obligation to obey them. Moreover, the fact that a law has been identified by a court as valid does not provide any guidance as to whether the court should apply it in a particular case. As John Gardner has said, legal positivism is \\"normatively inert\\"; it is a theory of law, not a theory of legal practice, adjudication, or political obligation. Legal positivists believe that intellectual clarity is best achieved by leaving these questions for separate investigation. Legal positivism and legal realism Legal positivism is distinct from legal realism. The differences are both analytically and normatively important. Both systems consider that law is a human construct. Unlike the American legal realists, positivists believe that in many instances, the law provides reasonably determinate guidance to its subjects and to judges, at least in trial courts. Niklas Luhmann asserts \\"We can reduce ... positive law to a formula, that law is not only posited (that is, selected) through decision, but also is valid by the power of decision (thus contingent and changeable).\\"Luhmann, 1987 However, positivists do not assert that law is made valid by anyone's decision. In Hart's opinion, the validity of law is a matter of the customary and collective practices of the courts. As for the moral validity of law, both positivists and realists maintain that this is a matter of moral principles. \\"The power of decision\\" has no essential role in either, since individual decision rarely suffices to create a social practice of recognition, and it would be implausible to suppose that moral principles are made so by anyone's decision. History = Antecedents of legal positivism = The main antecedent of legal positivism is Empiricism, the thinkers of which range back as far as Sextus Empiricus, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, George Berkeley, David Hume, and Auguste Comte. The main idea of empiricism is the claim that all knowledge of fact must be validated by sense experience or be inferred from propositions derived unambiguously from sense data. Further, empiricism is in opposition to metaphysics; for instance, Hume rejected metaphysics as mere speculation beyond what can be learnt from sense experience. The teachings of the empiricists preceded systemization of a positivist method for problems of comprehension and analysis, which was later represented by legal positivism. Logical positivists such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer suggested another important tenet of legal positivism: namely, that propositions and the use of words must be examined in order to understand reality. A sentence has literal significance if, and only if, it expresses something which is either tautologous or empirically verifiable. = Legal positivism = Methodology With the empiricist and logical positivist theoretical influences borne in mind, the essence of legal positivism as a descriptive investigation of particular legal orders is revealed, which, as Peter Curzon wrote, \\"utilises in its investigations the inductive method (i.e., proceeding from observation of particular facts to generalisations concerning all such facts)\\". During these investigations, matters of ethics, social policies and morality are eschewed; as Julius Stone wrote, it is concerned primarily with \\"an analysis of legal terms, and an enquiry into the logical interrelations of legal propositions\\". Further, law and its authority is considered as source-based; i.e., the validity of a legal norm depends not on the moral value attached thereto, but from the sources determined by a social community's rules and conventions. The source-based conception of law is reminiscent of the logical positivist Rudolf Carnap, who starkly rejected metaphysics on the basis that it attempts to interpret the nature of reality beyond the physical and experiential. Thomas Hobbes and Leviathan Thomas Hobbes, in his seminal work Leviathan, postulated the first detailed notion of law based on the notion of sovereign power. As Hampton writes, \\"law is understood [by Hobbes] to depend on the sovereign's will. No matter what a law's content, no matter how unjust it seems, if it has been commanded by the sovereign, then and only then is it law.\\" There is, however, debate surrounding Hobbes's status as a legal positivist. Jeremy Bentham The English jurist and philosopher Jeremy Bentham is arguably the greatest historical British legal positivist. In An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, Bentham developed a theory of law as the expressed will of a sovereign. Bentham made a distinction between the following types of people: * Expositors ‚Äì those who explained what the law in practice was; * Censors ‚Äì those who criticised the law in practice and compared it to their notions of what it ought to be. The philosophy of law, considered strictly, was to explain the real laws of the expositors, rather than the criticisms of the censors. Bentham was also noted for terming natural law \\"nonsense upon stilts\\". John Austin's command theory John Austin. John Austin partly emulated Bentham by writing The Province of jurisprudence Determined. However, Austin differed from Bentham in a number of ways, for example, by endorsing the common law. Differences aside, Austin embraced Hobbes's and Bentham's conception of law as a sovereign command, whose authority is recognised by most members of a society; the authority of which is enforced by the use of sanctions, but which is not bound by any human superior. The criterion for validity of a legal rule in such a society is that it has the warrant of the sovereign and will be enforced by the sovereign power and its agents. The three main tenets of Austin's command theory are: * laws are commands issued by the uncommanded commander, i.e. the sovereign; * such commands are enforced by sanctions; * a sovereign is one who is obeyed by the majority. Austin considered law to be commands from a sovereign that are enforced by a threat of sanction. In determining 'a sovereign', Austin recognised it is one whom society obeys habitually. This sovereign can be a single person or a collective sovereign such as Parliament, with a number of individuals, with each having various authoritative powers. Austin's theory is also somewhat brief in his explanations of Constitutions, International Law, non-sanctioned rules, or law that gives rights. Insofar as non-sanctioned rules and laws that allow persons to do things, such as contract law, Austin said that failure to obey the rules does result in sanctions; however, such sanctions are in the form of \\"the sanction of nullity\\". Hans Kelsen and Germanic positivism Bust of Hans Kelsen in the Arkadenhof, University of Vienna. The British legal positivism hitherto mentioned was founded on empiricism; by contrast, Germanic legal positivism was founded on the transcendental idealism of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Whereas British legal positivists regard law as distinct from morals, their Germanic counterparts regard law as separate from both fact and morals. The most famous proponent of Germanic legal positivism is Hans Kelsen, whose thesis of legal positivism is explained by Suri Ratnapala, who writes: From this framework, Kelsen opined that the regression of validated norms cannot go on infinitely and must arrive at a first cause, which he called a Grundnorm (basic norm). The legal system is therefore a system of legal norms connected to each other by their common origin, like the branches and leaves of a tree. For Kelsen, \\"sovereignty\\" was an arbitrary concept: \\"We can derive from the concept of sovereignty nothing else other than what we have purposely put into its definition.\\" Kelsen attracted disciples among scholars of public law worldwide. These disciples developed \\"schools\\" of thought to extend his theories, such as the Vienna School in Austria and the Brno School in Czechoslovakia. In English-speaking countries, H. L. A. Hart and Joseph Raz are perhaps the best-known authors who were influenced by Kelsen, though both schools differed from Kelsen's theories in several respects. H. L. A. Hart H. L. A. Hart. Hart liked Austin's theory of a sovereign, but claimed that Austin's command theory failed in several important respects. Among the ideas developed in Hart's book The Concept of Law (1961) are: * a critique of Austin's theory that a law is a command of the sovereign enforced by a threat of punishment; * a distinction between internal and external consideration of law and rules, influenced by Max Weber's distinction between legal and sociological perspectives on law; * a distinction between primary and secondary legal rules, such that a primary rule, such as a criminal law, governs conduct, and secondary rules provide methods by which primary rules are recognized, changed or judicially applied. Hart identifies three types of secondary rule: ** a rule of recognition, a rule by which any member of society may check to discover what the primary rules of the society are; ** a rule of change, by which existing primary rules might be created, altered or abolished; ** a rule of adjudication, by which the society might determine when a rule has been violated and prescribe a remedy; * a late reply (1994 edition) to Ronald Dworkin, who criticized legal positivism in general and especially Hart's account of law in Taking Rights Seriously (1977), A Matter of Principle (1985) and Law's Empire (1986). Joseph Raz A pupil of Hart, Joseph Raz has been important in continuing Hart's arguments of legal positivism since Hart's death. This has included editing in 1994 a second edition of Hart's The Concept of Law, with an additional section including Hart's responses to other philosophers' criticisms of his work.; superseded by 3rd edition 2012, edited by Leslie Green. Raz has also argued, contrary to Hart, that the validity of a law can never depend on its morality. However, Raz has come to accept that law may depend upon morality in certain circumstances. Legal positivism in Germany has been famously rejected by Gustav Radbruch in 1946 where prosecution of Nazi supporters faced a challenge of assessing actions that were legally compliant with Nazi Germany law. Radbruch argued that when \\"discrepancy between the positive law and justice reaches a level so unbearable\\", it effectively becomes \\"erroneous law\\" and must not be followed unconditionally.

Early life Daniel and Abigail Shays' Pelham, MA farmhouse, Daniel Shays was born in Hopkinton, Massachusetts sometime between April and August, 1747, the son of Irish immigrants Patrick Shays and Margaret Dempsey. Daniel was the second of six; his siblings were Margaret, James, Roger, Phebe, Mary, and Polly.Elmer S. Small (November 1934). The Family of Daniel Shays, from Descendants of Daniel Shays He spent his early years as a landless farm laborer. In 1772, he married Abigail Gilbert, and they settled in Brookfield, Massachusetts where they had 6 children.\\"Massachusetts Births and Christenings, 1639‚Äì1915,\\" database, FamilySearch : 4 December 2014), Daniel Shayes in entry for Daniel Shayes, 31 Jan 1773; citing, Shutesbury, Franklin, Massachusetts, 2:179B4K1; FHL microfilm 886,455 Revolutionary War Shays was accepted to the militia, during the American Revolution he rose to the rank of captain in the 5th Massachusetts Regiment of the Continental Army by 1777. He was involved in the Boston campaign and fought at the Battle of Bunker Hill.Richards, pf u. 95 He also fought in the Battle of Lexington and the Battle of Saratoga. He was wounded during the war and resigned from the military unpaid in 1780. Upon returning home, he was summoned to court for unpaid debts, which he could not pay because he had not been paid in full for his military service.Zinn, pp. 71‚Äì72Massachusetts Solder and Sailors in the war of the Revolution Vol XIV p.76 summary of Shays service record In 1780, General Lafayette presented him with an ornamental sword in honor of his military service. He later sold it for a few dollars to help pay off his debts, which was frowned upon by his peers. Shays' Rebellion Contemporary engraving depicting Daniel Shays (left) and Job Shattuck, another rebel leader; the artist intentionally rendered them in an unflattering way =Debt and tax burdens= After returning from the war, Daniel Shays was alarmed to discover that many of his fellow veterans and farmers were in the same financial situation as he. At commoners' meetings veterans asserted that they were treated unfairly upon release, and that businessmen were trying to squeeze money out of smallholders in order to pay their own debts to European war investors. Many Massachusetts rural communities first tried to petition the legislature in Boston,Zinn, pp. 91‚Äì93 but the legislature was dominated by eastern merchant interests and did not respond substantively to those petitions. The petitions and proposals often included a request to issue paper currency. Such inflationary issues would depreciate the currency, making it possible to meet obligations made at high values with lower-valued paper. The merchants, among them James Bowdoin, were opposed to these proposals because they were generally lenders who stood to lose. These proposals were repeatedly rejected.Szatmary, pp. 38‚Äì42, 45 Governor John Hancock, accused by some of anticipating trouble, abruptly resigned in early 1785. When Bowdoin (a loser to Hancock in earlier elections) was elected governor that year, matters became more severe. Bowdoin stepped up civil actions to collect back taxes, and the legislature exacerbated the situation by levying an additional property tax to raise funds for the state's portion of foreign debt payments.Richards, pp. 87‚Äì88 Even comparatively conservative commentators like John Adams observed that these levies were \\"heavier than the People could bear\\".Richards, p. 88 =Protests against the courts= Protests in rural Massachusetts turned into direct action in August 1786 after the state legislature adjourned without considering the many petitions that had been sent to Boston.Richards, pp. 6‚Äì9Szatmary, p. 38 On August 29, a well-organized force of protestors, Shays among them, marched on Northampton and successfully prevented the county court from sitting.Morse, p. 208 The leaders of this and later forces proclaimed that they were seeking relief from the burdensome judicial processes that were depriving the people of their land and possessions. They called themselves Regulators, a reference to the Regulator movement of North Carolina that sought to reform corrupt practices in the late 1760s.Szatmary, p. 56 On September 2 Governor Bowdoin issued a proclamation denouncing such mob action, but took no military measures in response beyond planning militia response to future actions.Szatmary, pp. 79‚Äì80 When the court in Worcester was shut down by similar action on September 5, the county militia (composed mainly of men sympathetic to the protestors) refused to turn out, much to Bowdoin's amazement.Szatmary, p. 80 Shays, who had participated in the Northampton action, began to take a more active leadership role in the uprising in November. On September 19, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts indicted eleven leaders of the rebellion as \\"disorderly, riotous, and seditious persons.\\"Zinn, p. 93 When the supreme judicial court was next scheduled to meet in Springfield on September 26, Shays in Hampshire County and Luke Day in what is now Hampden County (but was then part of Hampshire County) organized an attempt to shut it down. They were anticipated by William Shepard, the local militia commander, who began gathering government- supporting militia the Saturday before the court was to sit. By the time the court was ready to open, Shepard had 300 men protecting the Springfield courthouse. Shays and Day were able to recruit a similar number, but chose only to demonstrate, exercising their troops outside Shepard's lines, rather than attempt to seize the building.Holland, pp. 245‚Äì47 The judges first postponed the hearings, and then adjourned on the 28th without hearing any cases. Shepard withdrew his force, which had grown to some 800 men (to the Regulators' 1,200), to the federal armory, which was then only rumored to be the target of seizure by the activists.Holland, p. 247 =Plan to seize the Springfield Arsenal= On November 28 a posse of some 300 men rode to Groton to arrest Job Shattuck and other protest leaders in the area. Shattuck was chased down and arrested on the 30th, and was wounded by a sword slash in the process.Szatmary, pp. 92‚Äì93 This action and the arrest of other protest leaders in the eastern parts of the state radicalized those in the west, and they began to organize an overthrow of the state government. \\"The seeds of war are now sown\\", wrote one correspondent in Shrewsbury,Szatmary, p. 94 and by mid-January rebel leaders spoke of smashing the \\"tyrannical government of Massachusetts.\\"Szatmary, p. 97 While government forces organized in the east, Shays, Day, and other rebel leaders in the west organized their forces, establishing regional regimental organizations that were run by democratically elected committees. Their first major target was the federal armory in Springfield.Szatmary, pp. 98‚Äì99 General Shepard had, however, pursuant to orders from Governor Bowdoin, taken possession of the armory and used its arsenal to arm a force of some 1,200 militia.Richards, pp. 27‚Äì28Holland, p. 261 =Attack and collapse= The insurgents were organized into three major groups, and intended to surround and simultaneously attack the armory. Shays led one group east of Springfield near Palmer, Luke Day had a second force across the Connecticut River in West Springfield, and the third force, under Eli Parsons, was to the north at Chicopee.Richards, p. 28 The rebels had planned their assault for January 25, but Luke Day changed this at the last minute, sending Shays a message indicating he would not be ready to attack until the 26th.Szatmary, p. 101 Day's message was intercepted by Shepard's men, so the militia of Shays and Parsons, some 1,500 men, approached the armory on the 25th not knowing they would have no support from the west.Richards, p. 29 The Springfield Armory (building pictured is from the 19th century) was the first major target of the rebellion. When Shays and his forces neared the armory, they found Shepard's militia waiting for them. Shepard first ordered warning shots fired over the approaching Shaysites' heads, and then ordered two cannons to fire grape shot at Shays' men. Four Shaysites were killed and twenty wounded. There was no musket fire from either side, and the rebel advance collapsed.Szatmary, p. 102 Most of the rebel force fled north, eventually regrouping at Amherst. On the opposite side of the river, Day's forces also fled north, also eventually reaching Amherst.Szatmary, p. 103 General Benjamin Lincoln had mustered 3,000 men at Worcester to deal with the rebels. When he heard of the Springfield incident, they immediately began marching west. Shays led the rebel force generally north and east to avoid Lincoln, eventually establishing a camp at Petersham. Along the way they raided the shops of local merchants for supplies, taking some of them hostage. Lincoln pursued them, reaching Pelham, some from Petersham, on February 2.Szatmary, pp. 103‚Äì04 On the night of February 3‚Äì4, he led his militia on a forced march to Petersham through a bitter snowstorm. Arriving early in the morning, they surprised the rebel camp so thoroughly that they scattered \\"without time to call in their out parties or even their guards.\\"Szatmary, p. 105 Although Lincoln claimed to capture 150 men, none of them were officers, leading historian Leonard Richards to suspect the veracity of the report. Shays and some of the other leaders escaped north into New Hampshire and Vermont.Richards, pp. 31, 120 Some four thousand people signed confessions acknowledging participation in the events of the rebellion (in exchange for amnesty); several hundred participants were eventually indicted on charges relating to the rebellion. Most of these were pardoned under a general amnesty that only excluded a few ringleaders. Eighteen men, including Shays, were convicted and sentenced to death. Most of these either had their convictions overturned on appeal, were pardoned, or had their sentences commuted. Two of the condemned men, John Bly and Charles Rose, were hanged on December 6, 1787.Richards, pp. 38‚Äì41 Shays was pardoned in 1788 and he returned to Massachusetts from hiding in the Vermont woods.Zinn, p. 95 He was, however, vilified by the Boston press, who painted him as an archetypal anarchist opposed to the government.Richards, p. 117 Later life Shays was later granted a pension by the federal government for the five years he served in the Continental Army without pay. Shays lived the last few years of his life in poverty, a heavy drinker. He supported himself on his pension and by working a small parcel of land. Shays died at age 78 in Sparta, New York and was buried at the Union Cemetery in Scottsburg. Rededicated grave marker The original gravestone for Shays contained an error; by dropping the \\"s\\", Shays was incorrectly spelled as \\"Shay\\". In 2016, Philip R. Shays, of Clarence Center, New York, a descendant of Daniel Shays, led an effort to correct the error. Because the original stone did not contain enough space to add a letter, a new marker was created.\\"Gravestone Rededication: Heroic rebel, formative figure in U.S. history, to gets his ‚ÄòS‚Äô\\" The new gravestone was dedicated in a ceremony on August 12.

They transformed and popularized Irish folk music, touring and recording to great acclaim. Subsequently, Johnny Moynihan, Paul Brady, Matt Molloy (flute), Bill Whelan (keyboards), Nollaig Casey (fiddle) and, briefly, Noel Hill (concertina) and Tony Linnane (fiddle) were also temporary members. Planxty broke up twice, first in December 1975 and again in April 1983. The original quartet reunited in October 2003 and their final performance was on 31 January 2005. History =Formation and first run (1972‚Äì1975)= Christy Moore and D√≥nal Lunny had been friends since school days in Newbridge, County Kildare, Lunny having taught Moore how to play both guitar and bodhr√°n. Before the formation of Planxty, Lunny had been playing in a duet with Andy Irvine after the latter's return from Eastern Europe and they had also launched their own folk club, downstairs at Slattery's, called The Mugs Gig. Liam O'Flynn was playing in public and on the radio, and was well respected in traditional folk circles. All members were familiar with one another‚Äôs work to varying degrees, but were first brought together during the summer of 1971 to record Moore's second solo album, Prosperous, at his sister's house, in the village of the same name. In January 1972, the four joined forces to form Planxty, recording their first single, \\"Three Drunken Maidens\\"/\\"S√≠-Bheag, S√≠-Mh√≥r\\", in Trend Studios on 18 January 1972. The band performed on RT√â's The Late, Late Show the following Saturday, 22 January 1972, and played their first show on 6 March 1972, a 30-minute set at The Mugs Gig on a bill that included balladeer Paddy Reilly. They then assumed a weekly residency at The Mugs Gig, began rehearsing, and started playing live around Ireland. The group's first major performance‚Äìopening for Donovan at the Hangar in Galway, at Easter 1972‚Äìwas a huge success. Neither the audience nor the band knew what to expect, and both were pleasantly surprised. Irvine, unable to see the audience through the glare of the stage lights, was worried that the crowd might be on the verge of rioting. It took him several minutes to realize that what he was hearing was the expression of their enthusiasm. A rough quality recording of the song \\"Raggle Taggle Gypsy\\" from this concert was included on the 2004 retrospective, Christy Moore ‚Äì The Box Set: 1964‚Äì2004, complete with the audience's reaction. Planxty‚Äôs first single, \\"Three Drunken Maidens\\", was released by their manager Des Kelly‚Äôs label, Ruby Records, reaching no. 7 in the Irish charts. The next single, a re-recording of \\"The Cliffs of Dooneen\\", previously recorded for the Prosperous album, made it to no. 3. Two full albums followed: Planxty, recorded at Command Studios in London during September 1972, and The Well Below the Valley, recorded at the Escape Studios in Kent, from 18 June 1973. The group‚Äôs increasing popularity led to heavy touring throughout Ireland, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and northern Europe. Tired of constant touring and wishing to explore other musical avenues, Lunny left Planxty at the start of September 1973, playing his last gig with the band at the Edinburgh Festival. He would eventually end up a member of The Bothy Band. Johnny Moynihan, who had played with Irvine in Sweeney's Men, joined at this point, playing mandolin, bouzouki, fiddle, tin whistle and singing. This line-up, with contributions from Lunny, would record Planxty‚Äôs third album, Cold Blow and the Rainy Night in Sarm Studios, Whitechapel in London during August 1974. Next to leave, shortly after the making of this album, was Moore, who had a desire to return to his solo career and perform from a larger repertoire of songs. The split was amicable, and while Paul Brady was recruited to fill the gap in September 1974, Moore stayed on with him in the band until October. After his departure, the Irvine/Moynihan/Brady/O‚ÄôFlynn line-up toured extensively, but released no recordings before playing their final show in Brussels on 5 December 1975. Retrieved on 25 April 2015. =Reunion and second run (1978‚Äì1983)= After the break-up, Moynihan retreated into obscurity, continuing to perform occasionally, but rarely recording. Irvine and Brady toured together as a duo and, in August 1976, recorded an album at the Rockfield Studios, Andy Irvine/Paul Brady, produced by Lunny who also plays on most tracks, and with Kevin Burke on fiddle. For a while, Irvine continued to tour with Brady in Ireland and in the UK, and also with Mick Hanly, predominantly in Europe. In 1978, Brady released a solo album (Welcome Here Kind Stranger) including Irvine, Tommy Peoples and Lunny, who also produced it. The original four members of Planxty, however, continued to encounter each other socially, on the stage, and in the studio. This eventually led to a reunion encouraged by music promoter Kevin Flynn, who would become their manager. They were joined this time by Matt Molloy, who had been a member of The Bothy Band with Lunny and was also a close friend of O'Flynn's. Starting rehearsals at Molloy‚Äôs home on Tuesday, 19 September 1978, this line-up would go on a mammoth European tour the following year, from 15 April to 11 June 1979, during which the band played forty-seven concerts in fifty-eight days, in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, France and Ireland. From 18 to 30 June 1979, Planxty recorded their fourth album, After the Break, at the Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin, produced by Lunny and released on the Tara Records label. Molloy would leave the group to join The Chieftains shortly after the album was recorded, and remains with them to this day. In between the Planxty activity, Irvine squeezed in tours in Europe with Lunny, Mick Hanly and Gerry O'Beirne. He also recorded his first solo album, Rainy Sundays... Windy Dreams, at Windmill Lane Studios in late 1979, produced by Lunny and released on Tara Records in 1980. On 28 February 1980, Planxty headlined the Sense of Ireland concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London. When they returned to Ireland, they recorded two programmes for RT√â at the Pavilion Theatre in D√∫n Laoghaire, then started rehearsals at Kilkea Castle in Castledermot, County Kildare with two musicians from County Clare: concertina player Noel Hill and fiddler Tony Linnane. The six-member line-up of Moore, Irvine, Lunny, O‚ÄôFlynn, Hill and Linnane were joined by Molloy and keyboardist Bill Whelan, to record the band's fifth album, The Woman I Loved So Well, at Windmill Lane Studios over two periods: 23‚Äì29 April and 16‚Äì19 May. The album was wrapped up with a reception at Windmill Lane Studios on 9 June 1980. The band began touring as a four-piece during the summer of 1980, playing a tour of Italian castles in July and returning to The Boys of Ballisodare festival on 9 August, joined by Whelan and a young Cork fiddler, Nollaig Casey. Shows around this time would feature the four-piece band for the first set, with Whelan and Casey joining in for the second set. This line-up played a week of shows at the Olympia Theatre in Dublin on 18‚Äì23 August 1980, taped for a potential live album, which eventually emerged in 1987 as the unlicensed release The Best of Planxty Live. This line-up, augmented by a full orchestra and rhythm section, would also record \\"Timedance\\" in 1981 as part of the Eurovision Song Contest; \\"Timedance\\" was the genesis for what Whelan would later develop into Riverdance. The six- piece Planxty continued to tour, but began to drift apart. O‚ÄôFlynn took on a project with Shaun Davey, The Brendan Voyage. Moore & Lunny, eager to experiment with a rhythm section and a different, more political, song set, formed Moving Hearts. Lunny also kept busy producing albums by other artists. The original four-piece line-up played their last show together on 24 August 1982, at the National Stadium in Dublin. Nevertheless, the band (with Whelan and Casey still on board) recorded one final album at Windmill Lane Studios for the WEA label in late October and early November 1982, Words & Music, which also featured contributions from fiddler James Kelly and Moving Hearts bass guitarist Eoghan O‚ÄôNeill. The divided attention of two bands proved too much and, in early 1983, Lunny and Moore left to concentrate on Moving Hearts. Irvine, O‚ÄôFlynn and Whelan decided to continue as Planxty, retaining fiddler James Kelly and also recruiting Arty McGlynn of County Tyrone on guitar, plus Galway‚Äôs Dolores Keane on vocals and a plethora of traditional instruments. Irvine would later dub this line-up \\"Planxty-Too-Far\\", as the personnel and musical focus, now more dominated by Whelan, was far removed from the original Planxty. A tour of Ireland in spring of 1983, including the National Stadium in Dublin on 27 April, would be the end of the group. In the words of Andy Irvine: Although Moore, Irvine, Lunny and O'Flynn would continue to meet from time to time and perform occasionally in various combinations during professional engagements--and even play together as a foursome in the privacy of Moore's house at least once--rumours of putative reunions circulated for over two decades. =No Disco Documentary (2002‚Äì2003)= In late 2002, broadcaster and journalist Leagues O'Toole was working as presenter and researcher for the RT√â television show No Disco and persuaded the programme editor, Rory Cobbe, to develop a one-off documentary about Planxty. O'Toole proceeded with interviewing Moore, Irvine and O'Flynn but Lunny, who was living in Japan, was unavailable. After also shooting links at key landmarks from the Planxty history, the programme aired on 3 March 2003, receiving a phenomenal response from the public and some very positive feedback from the Planxty members themselves. In a final comment about the constant speculation of the original line-up regrouping, Moore had stated, on camera: \\"There's nobody longs for it more than myself and the other three guys. Definitely the time is right. Let's go for it\\". =\\"The Third Coming\\" (2003‚Äì2005)= On Tuesday, 7 October 2003, O'Toole received a postcard from Moore reading: \\"There might be something of interest happening on Saturday. I'll be in touch\\". It turned out that Paddy Doherty, owner of the Royal Spa Hotel in Lisdoonvarna (and co-founder of the Lisdoonvarna Festival), had arranged for the band's use of the hotel's old dining room for rehearsals, which led to a one-off concert there in front of 200 people on 11 October 2003. Moore, on stage, credited the No Disco documentary with inspiring the reunion. Pleased with the results and the experience of playing together again, the original Planxty quartet agreed to the longed-for reunion (dubbed \\"The Third Coming\\") and would perform together again, on and off, for a period of just over a year. First, they played a series of concerts at the Gl√≥r Theatre in Ennis, County Clare (on 23 & 24 January 2004) and at Vicar Street in Dublin (on 30 & 31 January and on 4 & 5, 11 & 12 February 2004), which were recorded and from which selected material was released on the CD Live 2004 and its associated DVD. In late 2004 and early 2005, another round of concerts took place at the following venues: * Radisson SAS Hotel in Galway (6, 7 and 8 October 2004); * Point Theatre in Dublin (28, 29 and 30 December 2004, plus extra dates on 3, 4 and 5 January 2005); * Waterfront Hall in Belfast (19, 20 and 21 January 2005); * Barbican Centre in London (29, 30 and 31 January 2005). Planxty remained a four-piece throughout this period, with Moore occasionally playing keyboards. Since then, there has been no further activity; Moore has said he would not participate in another reunion, but gave his blessing to the others for their future use of the Planxty name. =The Humours of Planxty (2006)= Leagues O'Toole documented the history and development of the group in the biography The Humours of Planxty, which was published by Hodder Headline in 2006. =LAPD (2012‚Äì2013)= Friday, 20 January 2012Reviews from 'ticketmaster' website.

Etymology \\"Planxty\\" was a word used by people who named works by harper Turlough O'Carolan after his death, and is believed to denote a tribute to a particular person: \\"Planxty Irwin,\\" for example, would be in honor of Colonel John Irwin of Sligo. \\"Planxty\\" is thought to be a corruption of the Irish word and popular toast \\"sl√°inte\\", meaning \\"good health.\\" Another possible explanation is that it is derived from the Latin planctus, a medieval lament. Regardless of its origin, the moniker, which replaced the provisional \\"CLAD\\" (Christy ‚Äì Liam ‚Äì Andy ‚Äì D√≥nal), turned out to be a good fit, as O'Carolan's music would play an important part in the band's repertoire. (see \\"Influences\\", below). Influences A formative influence on Planxty, and in particular on Moore, was the singing of Irish Traveller John \\"Jacko\\" Reilly who hailed from Boyle, Co. Roscommon. It was from Reilly that Moore learned \\"Raggle Taggle Gypsy\\", which was recorded for the first Planxty album, in addition to \\"The Well Below the Valley,\\" which appeared on The Well Below the Valley. Moore later dipped into Reilly's songbook again for an updated version of the lengthy ballad \\"Lord Baker,\\" which was featured on Planxty's 1983 album Words & Music. (\\"Baker\\" appears to be a mondegreen for the \\"Beichan\\" of earlier versions.) Reilly died in 1969 at the age of 44, shortly after being found beneath his coats in the top room of his dwelling in Boyle by Tom Munnelly, who had originally collected his songs for archiving. The music of Turlough O'Carolan appeared on a number of Planxty albums (including the B-side of their very first single), played by O'Flynn on the pipes. Much of this music first came to the attention of the band through the work of seminal Irish composer Se√°n √ì Riada and his group Ceolt√≥ir√≠ Chualann.

Huntington, are \\"stable, valued, recurring patterns of behavior\\".Huntington, p. 9 Further, institutions can refer to mechanisms which govern the behavior of a set of individuals within a given community; moreover, institutions are identified with a social purpose, transcending individuals and intentions by mediating the rules that govern living behavior. According to Geoffrey M. Hodgson, it is misleading to say that an institution is a form of behavior. Instead, Hodgson states that institutions are \\"integrated systems of rules that structure social interactions\\".Hodgson (2015 p. 501), Journal of Institutional Economics (2015), 11: 3, 497‚Äì505. The term \\"institution\\" commonly applies to both informal institutions such as customs, or behavior patterns important to a society, and to particular formal institutions created by entities such as the government and public services. Primary or meta-institutions are institutions such as the family that are broad enough to encompass other institutions. Institutions are a principal object of study in social sciences such as political science, anthropology, economics, and sociology (the latter described by √âmile Durkheim as the \\"science of institutions, their genesis and their functioning\\").Durkheim, √âmile [1895] The Rules of Sociological Method 8th edition, trans. Sarah A. Solovay and John M. Mueller, ed. George E. G. Catlin (1938, 1964 edition), p. 45 Institutions are also a central concern for law, the formal mechanism for political rule-making and enforcement. Definition People may deliberately create individual, formal organizations commonly identified as \\"institutions\\"‚Äîbut the development and function of institutions in society in general may be regarded as an instance of emergence. That is, institutions arise, develop and function in a pattern of social self-organization beyond conscious intentions of the individuals involved. As mechanisms of social interaction, institutions manifest in both formal organizations, such as the U.S. Congress, or the Roman Catholic Church, and, also, in informal social order and organization, reflecting human psychology, culture, habits and customs, and encompassing subjective experience of meaningful enactments. Formal institutions are explicitly set forth by a relevant authority and informal institutions are generally unwritten societal rules, norms, and traditions. Primary or meta-institutions are institutions that encompass many the other institutions, both formal and informal (e.g. the family, government, the economy, education, and religion. ) Most important institutions, considered abstractly, have both objective and subjective aspects: examples include money and marriage. The institution of money encompasses many formal organizations, including banks and government treasury departments and stock exchanges, which may be termed, \\"institutions\\", as well as subjective experiences, which guide people in their pursuit of personal well-being. Powerful institutions are able to imbue a paper currency with certain value, and to induce millions into production and trade in pursuit of economic ends abstractly denominated in that currency's units. The subjective experience of money is so pervasive and persuasive that economists talk of the \\"money illusion\\" and try to disabuse their students of it, in preparation for learning economic analysis.  Examples  Examples of institutions include: * Family: The family is the center of the child's life. The family teaches children cultural values and attitudes about themselves and others ‚Äì see sociology of the family. Children learn continuously from their environment. Children also become aware of class at a very early age and assign different values to each class accordingly.Macionis, John J., and Linda M. Gerber. Sociology. Toronto: Pearson Canada, 2011. p. 116. * Religion: Some religion is like an ethnic or cultural category, making it less likely for the individuals to break from religious affiliations and be more socialized in this setting. Parental religious participation is the most influential part of religious socialization‚Äîmore so than religious peers or religious beliefs. See sociology of religion and civil religion. * Peer groups: A peer group is a social group whose members have interests, social positions and age in common. This is where children can escape supervision and learn to form relationships on their own. The influence of the peer group typically peaks during adolescence however peer groups generally only affect short term interests unlike the family which has long term influence.Macionis, John J., and Linda M. Gerber. Sociology. Toronto: Pearson Canada, 2011. p. 113. * Economic systems: Economic systems dictate \\"acceptable alternatives for consumption\\", \\"social values of consumption alternatives\\", the \\"establishment of dominant values\\", and \\"the nature of involvement in consumption\\". * Legal systems: Children are pressured from both parents and peers to conform and obey certain laws or norms of the group/community. Parents‚Äô attitudes toward legal systems influence children's views as to what is legally acceptable. For example, children whose parents are continually in jail are more accepting of incarceration. See jurisprudence, philosophy of law, sociology of law. * Penal systems: The penal systems acts upon prisoners and the guards. Prison is a separate environment from that of normal society; prisoners and guards form their own communities and create their own social norms. Guards serve as \\"social control agents\\" who discipline and provide security. From the view of the prisoners, the communities can be oppressive and domineering, causing feelings of defiance and contempt towards the guards. Because of the change in societies, prisoners experience loneliness, a lack of emotional relationships, a decrease in identity and \\"lack of security and autonomy\\". Both the inmates and the guards feel tense, fearful, and defensive, which creates an uneasy atmosphere within the community. See sociology of punishment. * Language: People learn to socialize differently depending on the specific language and culture in which they live.Ochs, Elinor. 1988. Culture and language development: Language acquisition and language socialization in a Samoan village. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Ochs, Elinor, and Bambi Schieffelin. 1984.

New York: Cambridge University. Schieffelin, Bambi B. 1990. The Give and Take of Everyday Life: Language Socialization of Kaluli Children. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. A specific example of this is code switching. This is where immigrant children learn to behave in accordance with the languages used in their lives: separate languages at home and in peer groups (mainly in educational settings). Depending on the language and situation at any given time, people will socialize differently. See linguistics, sociolinguistics, sociology of language. * Mass media: The mass media are the means for delivering impersonal communications directed to a vast audience. The term media comes from Latin meaning, \\"middle\\", suggesting that the media's function is to connect people. The media can teach norms and values by way of representing symbolic reward and punishment for different kinds of behavior.McQuail (2005): McQuail‚Äôs Mass Communication Theory: Fifth Edition, London: Sage. 494 Mass media has enormous effects on our attitudes and behavior, notably in regards to aggression.Macionis, John J., and Linda M.

However, these institutions may be considered private or autonomous, whilst organised religion and family life certainly pre-date the advent of the nation state. The Neo-Marxist thought of Antonio Gramsci, for instance, distinguishes between institutions of political society (police, the army, legal system, etc.), which dominate directly and coercively‚Äîand civil society (the family, education system, etc.). Informal institutions Informal institutions have been largely overlooked in the comparative politics, but in many countries it is the informal institutions and rules that govern the political landscape. To understand the political behaviour in a country it is important to look at how that behaviour is enabled or constrained by informal institutions, and how this affects how formal institutions are run. For example, if there are high levels of extrajudicial killings in a country, it might be that while it is prohibited by the state the police are actually enabled to carry out such killings and informally encouraged to prop up an inefficient formal state police institution. An informal institution tends to have socially shared rules, which are unwritten and yet are often known by all inhabitants of a certain country, as such they are often referred to as being an inherent part of the culture of a given country. Informal practices are often referred to as \\"cultural\\", for example clientelism or corruption is sometimes stated as a part of the political culture in a certain place, but an informal institution itself is not cultural, it may be shaped by culture or behaviour of a given political landscape, but they should be looked at in the same way as formal institutions to understand their role in a given country. Informal institutions might be particularly used to pursue a political agenda, or a course of action that might not be publicly popular, or even legal, and can be seen as an effective way of making up for lack of efficiency in a formal institution. For example, in countries where formal institutions are particularly inefficient, an informal institution may be the most cost effective way of actually carrying out a given task, and this ensures that there is little pressure on the formal institutions to become more efficient. The relationship between formal and informal institutions is often closely aligned and informal institutions step in to prop up inefficient institutions. However, because they do not have a centre, which directs and coordinates their actions, changing informal institutions is a slow and lengthy process.Helmke, G.Levitsky, S. It is as such important to look at any given country and note the presence of informal institutions when looking at the political landscape, and note that they are not necessarily a rejection of the state, but an integral part of it and broadening the scope of the role of the state in a given country. Social science perspectives While institutions tend to appear to people in society as part of the natural, unchanging landscape of their lives, study of institutions by the social sciences tends to reveal the nature of institutions as social constructions, artifacts of a particular time, culture and society, produced by collective human choice, though not directly by individual intention. Sociology traditionally analyzed social institutions in terms of interlocking social roles and expectations. Social institutions created and were composed of groups of roles, or expected behaviors. The social function of the institution was executed by the fulfillment of roles. Basic biological requirements, for reproduction and care of the young, are served by the institutions of marriage and family, for example, by creating, elaborating and prescribing the behaviors expected for husband/father, wife/mother, child, etc. The relationship of the institutions to human nature is a foundational question for the social sciences. Institutions can be seen as \\"naturally\\" arising from, and conforming to, human nature‚Äîa fundamentally conservative view‚Äîor institutions can be seen as artificial, almost accidental, and in need of architectural redesign, informed by expert social analysis, to better serve human needs‚Äîa fundamentally progressive view. Adam Smith anchored his economics in the supposed human \\"propensity to truck, barter and exchange\\". Modern feminists have criticized traditional marriage and other institutions as element of an oppressive and obsolete patriarchy. The Marxist view‚Äîwhich sees human nature as historically 'evolving' towards voluntary social cooperation, shared by some anarchists‚Äîis that supra-individual institutions such as the market and the state are incompatible with the individual liberty of a truly free society. Economics, in recent years, has used game theory to study institutions from two perspectives. Firstly, how do institutions survive and evolve? In this perspective, institutions arise from Nash equilibria of games. For example, whenever people pass each other in a corridor or thoroughfare, there is a need for customs, which avoid collisions. Such a custom might call for each party to keep to their own right (or left‚Äîsuch a choice is arbitrary, it is only necessary that the choice be uniform and consistent). Such customs may be supposed to be the origin of rules, such as the rule, adopted in many countries, which requires driving automobiles on the right side of the road. Secondly, how do institutions affect behaviour? In this perspective, the focus is on behaviour arising from a given set of institutional rules. In these models, institutions determine the rules (i.e. strategy sets and utility functions) of games, rather than arise as equilibria out of games. Douglass North argues, the very emergence of an institution reflects behavioral adaptations through his application of increasing returns. Over time institutions develop rules that incentivize certain behaviors over others because they present less risk or induce lower cost, and establish path dependent outcomes. For example, the Cournot duopoly model is based on an institution involving an auctioneer who sells all goods at the market-clearing price. While it is always possible to analyze behaviour with the institutions- as-equilibria approach instead, it is much more complicated. In political science, the effect of institutions on behavior has also been considered from a meme perspective, like game theory borrowed from biology. A \\"memetic institutionalism\\" has been proposed, suggesting that institutions provide selection environments for political action, whereby differentiated retention arises and thereby a Darwinian evolution of institutions over time. Public choice theory, another branch of economics with a close relationship to political science, considers how government policy choices are made, and seeks to determine what the policy outputs are likely to be, given a particular political decision-making process and context. Credibility thesis purports that institutions emerge from intentional institution-building but never in the originally intended form. Instead, institutional development is endogenous and spontaneously ordered and institutional persistence can be explained by their credibility, which is provided by the function that particular institutions serve. In history, a distinction between eras or periods, implies a major and fundamental change in the system of institutions governing a society. Political and military events are judged to be of historical significance to the extent that they are associated with changes in institutions. In European history, particular significance is attached to the long transition from the feudal institutions of the Middle Ages to the modern institutions, which govern contemporary life. =Theories of institutional change= In order to understand why some institutions persist and other institutions only appear in certain contexts, it is important to understand what drives institutional change. Acemoglu, Johnson and Robinson assert that institutional change is endogenous. They posit a framework for institutional change that is rooted in the distribution of resources across society and preexisting political institutions. These two factors determine de jure and de facto political power, respectively, which in turn defines this period's economic institutions and next period's political institutions. Finally, the current economic institutions determine next period's distribution of resources and the cycle repeats.Acemoglu, Daron, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson. \\"Institutions as a fundamental cause of long-run growth.\\" Handbook of Economic Growth 1 (2005): 385‚Äì472. Douglass North attributes institutional change to the work of \\"political entrepreneurs\\", who see personal opportunities to be derived from a changed institutional framework. These entrepreneurs weigh the expected costs of altering the institutional framework against the benefits they can derive from the change.North, D. C. (1992). Transaction costs, Institutions, and Economic Performance (pp. 13‚Äì15). San Francisco, CA: ICS Press. North describes institutional change as a process that is extremely incremental, and that works through both formal and informal institutions. Lipscy argues that patterns of institutional change vary according to underlying characteristics of issue areas, such as network effects. Carmine Guerriero provides a theory of the design of formal and informal institutions---like market design, legal traditions, property rights, a culture of cooperation and inclusive political institutions---based on the unifying idea that institutions help solve inefficiencies in the exchange of assets and input and in the investment in innovation. In the case of a culture of cooperation and inclusive political institutions, Guerriero builds on the institutional revolution that shook Europe during the Middle Ages to develop a model highlighting two ideas. First, the profitable enough joint investment pushes the elite to introduce more inclusive political institutions to convince the citizens that a sufficient part of its return will be shared via public spending and so, they should cooperate. Second, the citizens accumulate culture to share consumption risk and to commit to cooperating in investment at its intermediate values threatening democracy. Consistent with these predictions, in a panel of 90 European regions spanning the period 1000‚Äì1600, reforms towards tighter constraints on the elite's power were driven by factors curbing the observability of farming investments and raising the value of long-distance trade, i.e., terrain ruggedness and direct access to the coast. Moreover, the activity of the Cistercians and Franciscans, who dictated charity-based norms of cooperation in exchange for guidance on how to share consumption risk, intensified with the climate volatility and with the severity of shocks to the investment value, i.e., changes in the trading routes. In a 2020 study, Johannes Gerschewski created a two-by-two typology of institutional change depending on the sources of change (exogenous or endogenous) and the time horizon of change (short or long). In another 2020 study, Erik Voeten created a two-by-two typology of institutional design depending on whether actors have full agency or are bound by structures, and whether institutional designs reflect historical processes or are optimal equilibriums. Institutional persistence North argues that because of the preexisting influence that existing organizations have over the existing framework, change that is brought about is often in the interests of these organizations. This produces a phenomenon called path dependence, which states that institutional patterns are persistent and endure over time.Transaction costs, Institutions, and Economic Performance (pp. 13‚Äì15). San Francisco, CA: ICS Press. These paths are determined at critical junctures, analogous to a fork in the road, whose outcome leads to a narrowing of possible future outcomes. Once a choice is made during a critical juncture, it becomes progressively difficult to return to the initial point where the choice was made. James Mahoney studies path dependence in the context of national regime change in Central America and finds that liberal policy choices of Central American leaders in the 19th century was the critical juncture that led to the divergent levels of development that we see in these countries today.Mahoney, James. \\"Path-dependent explanations of regime change: Central America in comparative perspective.\\" Studies in Comparative International Development 36.1 (2001): 111‚Äì41. The policy choices that leaders made in the context of liberal reform policy led to a variety of self-reinforcing institutions that created divergent development outcomes for the Central American countries. Though institutions are persistent, North states that paths can change course when external forces weaken the power of an existing organization. This allows other entrepreneurs to affect change in the institutional framework. This change can also occur as a result of gridlock between political actors produced by a lack of mediating institutions and an inability to reach a bargain.North, Douglass Cecil. Transaction costs, institutions, and economic performance. San Francisco, CA: ICS Press, 1992. Artificial implementation of institutional change has been tested in political development but can have unintended consequences. North, Wallis, and Weingast divide societies into different social orders: open access orders, which about a dozen developed countries fall into today, and limited access orders, which accounts for the rest of the countries. Open access orders and limited access orders differ fundamentally in the way power and influence is distributed. As a result, open access institutions placed in limited access orders face limited success and are often coopted by the powerful elite for self-enrichment. Transition to more democratic institutions is not created simply by transplanting these institutions into new contexts, but happens when it is in the interest of the dominant coalition to widen access.North, Douglass C. Limited access orders in the developing world: A new approach to the problems of development. Vol. 4359. World Bank Publications, 2007. Natural selection Ian Lustick suggests that the social sciences, particularly those with the institution as a central concept, can benefit by applying the concept of natural selection to the study of how institutions change over time. By viewing institutions as existing within a fitness landscape, Lustick argues that the gradual improvements typical of many institutions can be seen as analogous to hill- climbing within one of these fitness landscapes. This can eventually lead to institutions becoming stuck on local maxima, such that for the institution to improve any further, it would first need to decrease its overall fitness score (e.g., adopt policies that may cause short-term harm to the institution's members). The tendency to get stuck on local maxima can explain why certain types of institutions may continue to have policies that are harmful to its members or to the institution itself, even when members and leadership are all aware of the faults of these policies. As an example, Lustick cites Amyx's analysis of the gradual rise of the Japanese economy and its seemingly sudden reversal in the so-called \\"Lost Decade\\". According to Amyx, Japanese experts were not unaware of the possible causes of Japan's economic decline. Rather, to return Japan's economy back to the path to economic prosperity, policymakers would have had to adopt policies that would first cause short- term harm to the Japanese people and government. Under this analysis, says Ian Lustick, Japan was stuck on a \\"local maxima\\", which it arrived at through gradual increases in its fitness level, set by the economic landscape of the 1970s and 80s. Without an accompanying change in institutional flexibility, Japan was unable to adapt to changing conditions, and even though experts may have known which changes the country needed, they would have been virtually powerless to enact those changes without instituting unpopular policies that would have been harmful in the short-term. The lessons from Lustick's analysis applied to Sweden's economic situation can similarly apply to the political gridlock that often characterizes politics in the United States. For example, Lustick observes that any politician who hopes to run for elected office stands very little to no chance if they enact policies that show no short-term results. Unfortunately, there is a mismatch between policies that bring about short-term benefits with minimal sacrifice, and those that bring about long- lasting change by encouraging institution-level adaptations. There are some criticisms to Lustick's application of natural selection theory to institutional change. Lustick himself notes that identifying the inability of institutions to adapt as a symptom of being stuck on a local maxima within a fitness landscape does nothing to solve the problem. At the very least, however, it might add credibility to the idea that truly beneficial change might require short-term harm to institutions and their members. David Sloan Wilson notes that Lustick needs to more carefully distinguish between two concepts: multilevel selection theory and evolution on multi-peaked landscapes. Bradley Thayer points out that the concept of a fitness landscape and local maxima only makes sense if one institution can be said to be \\"better\\" than another, and this in turn only makes sense insofar as there exists some objective measure of an institution's quality. This may be relatively simple in evaluating the economic prosperity of a society, for example, but it is difficult to see how objectively a measure can be applied to the amount of freedom of a society, or the quality of life of the individuals within. Institutionalization The term \\"institutionalization\\" is widely used in social theory to refer to the process of embedding something (for example a concept, a social role, a particular value or mode of behavior) within an organization, social system, or society as a whole. The term may also be used to refer to committing a particular individual to an institution, such as a mental institution. To this extent, \\"institutionalization\\" may carry negative connotations regarding the treatment of, and damage caused to, vulnerable human beings by the oppressive or corrupt application of inflexible systems of social, medical, or legal controls by publicly owned, private or not-for-profit organizations. The term \\"institutionalization\\" may also be used in a political sense to apply to the creation or organization of governmental institutions or particular bodies responsible for overseeing or implementing policy, for example in the welfare or development.

It is commonly considered a follow-up of Duck Stab/Buster & Glen.  Background  The album pares down the concept and structure of the average commercial pop song and reduces it to a one-minute redux. It contains a compilation of 40 such sixty- second vignettes. The album used several session musicians, including Chris Cutler, Snakefinger (who sings lead on many tracks) and Fred Frith as well as two anonymous guest vocalists, Lene Lovich (\\"Picnic Boy\\") and Andy Partridge (\\"Margaret Freeman\\"). Brian Eno is also thought to appear on the album, but this was never been conclusively confirmed until the release of the 2-CD pREServed Edition in 2019, the liner notes of which confirmed that Eno played synthesizer on \\"The Coming Of The Crow\\" as well as David Byrne's appearance on harmony vocals on \\"Suburban Bathers\\". The faces on the album cover are John Travolta and Barbra Streisand. The backside of the original LP labels listed the length as \\"1:00\\" after each of the 40 song titles. The first edition sleeve listed the tracks in the wrong order. The liner notes state that songs should be repeated three times in a row to form a \\"pop song\\". The Residents purchased 40 one-minute advertising slots on San Francisco's most popular Top-40 radio station at the time, KFRC, such that the station played each track of their album over three days. This prompted an editorial in Billboard magazine questioning whether the act was art or advertising.
