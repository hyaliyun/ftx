Career Notes  Yuri Kuznetsov reached the highlight of his career in 2001 when he won the Russian Superleague with Metallurg Magnitogorsk, playing on a line with brothers Aleksandr and Yevgeniy Koreshkov from Kazakhstan. This same year he played for the Russian national team in the 2001 IIHF World Championship. After two successful seasons with Severstal Cherepovets, he was reunited with the Koreshkov brothers in 2004–2005 at his youth club, the Sibir Novosibirsk but all three players left the club during the season without much success. His career outside of Russia included 2 seasons for the Syracuse Crunch of the AHL right after he was selected by the Vancouver Canucks in the 7th round of 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He also played for the Minnesota Moose of the IHL, the Kölner Haie of the DEL and the Milano Vipers of the French League.  Coaching career  In May 2009 PHC Krylya Sovetov announced that Yuri Kuznetsov would be assistant coach to Alexei Kasatonov, the new head coach for the 2009–2010 Vysshaya Liga season, with Vladimir Myshkin being the goaltender coach.

It comprises the same area as the administrative Kräklingbo District, established on 1January 2016. The most visible feature at Kräklingbo is the Torsburgen, a fortified plateau. In 1992, it was the site of a large wildfire.  Geography  Kräklingbo is the name of the socken as well as the district. It is also the name of the small village surrounding the medieval Kräklingbo Church, sometimes referred to as Kräklingbo kyrkby. It is situated near the central part of Gotland's east coast. , Kräklingbo Church belongs to Östergarn parish in Romaklosters pastorat, along with the churches in Östergarn, Gammelgarn, Anga and Ala. One of the asteroids in the Asteroid belt, 8682 Kräklingbo, is named after this place.  Etymology  The name Kräklingbo dates from the 15th century, and was originally the name of a farm. The first part of the name (Kräkling) probably means \\"dry hook\\" as in dry twig or fork of a bough, the second part (bo) is old Swedish for \\"settlement\\".  History  The most visible feature at Kräklingbo is the ancient fortress of Torsburgen, a fortified plateau towering above the rest of the landscape. Nearby, at Hajdeby farm, there are a number of visible Bronze Age grooves.  Events  The annual Kräklingbo Market is one of the major autumn markets on Gotland. There are five official markets held on the island in August–October: Slite, Havdhem, Kräklingbo, Klintehamn and Hemse, each usually spanning a weekend.  The great forest fire  The Gotland wildfire of 1992, sometimes called the Kräklingbo fire, started early in the morning on 9July 1992 in the forest in the southern part of Torsburgen. It is one of the largest ancient fortresses in Sweden. Although no one died in the fire, it developed into one of the largest wildfires in Sweden. The fire destroyed vegetation over an area of more than , of which was productive forest land. The fire resulted in one of the biggest rescue operations in modern times on Gotland. = Wildfire = The early summer of 1992 was unusually warm with little rain, leaving the ground extremely dry. On 9July there was a moderate gale of about 7 on the Beaufort scale, coming from the south. The fire, probably started by a burning cigarette,TV3, Larmet går–Skogsbrand på Gotland 1993. started in the southern part of Torsburgen, a couple of hundred meters north of the Arde opening. The fire spread rapidly and soon developed into a canopy fire. Due to the wind a fire storm, about two kilometers wide, formed and advanced north toward Hajdeby farm and Kräklingbo church. The fire had three fronts. Two flanks, each approximately wide, slowly spreading outwards and a wide front advancing very rapidly in the north. = Suppression = The fire at Kräklingbo. Red approximately representing the area of the fire after three hours and grey the final area. A day later, on the morning of 10July, the fire was wide and about long. On site were approximately one hundred firefighters, sixty enlisted soldiers from the P 18 regiment in Visby and some volunteers. A command centre was established at Kräklingbo fire station. Helicopter Q 90 with crew from Visby also participated in suppressing the fire. Later on another helicopter, the Q 97 with a hastily formed crew, joined the operation as did helicopter Q 91. These three helicopters logged a total of 43 hours and 45 minutes in flight during the fire. They dropped 414 tanks, about , of water. During the day the fire advanced on the three farms at Hejdeby while the rescue command prepared to evacuate all residents in the area. There was a great deal of confusion about what to do until Nisse Olofsson, a former chief at the Kräklingbo fire station, more or less took over the fire suppression at Hejdeby with the help of about 20 volunteers. They succeeded in establishing a counter fire and stopped the main blaze just from Tors farm. At this time the flames were approximately high. On the evening of 11July, firebreaks had been established around the area, but the fire continued to rage inside. On the morning of 13 July, the local radio station broadcast an announcement requesting all firefighters on vacation to report at the Visby fire station. Later it was announced that the worst stage of the fire had passed as a light rain fell on Gotland suppressing the fire. During the night the firefighters had also gone into the Torsburgen and conducted intense work to prevent the fire from spreading further within that area, but they were forced to retreat due to falling trees. About fifty firefighters now monitored the south part of Torsburgen and the fire was declared to be under control. By this time, the police had trouble keeping away curious people gathering in the area. Even families with children had gone into the fire site despite warnings on local radio to respect the cordons and the risk of falling trees. = Aftermath = The area of the fire, a few years later, as seen from Torsburgen. Suppression of the fire was the largest rescue operation on Gotland in modern times. The post–fire work continued for several years . The fire destroyed more than of land. About 740 ha of these were productive forest land in the Kräklingbo and Gammelgarn area (total value of 20 million crowns, about US$3 million) and 41 land owners were affected. Nearly all of the forest in the central and north part of Torsburgen was more or less destroyed by the fire. It was more than a month later that the Rescue Department declared the operation finished. The total cost of the rescue operation was about 18.5 million crowns (about US$2.85 million) The Swedish Armed Forces contributed with 400 military personnel, communication equipment, helicopters and vehicles.Civil-military samverkan på central nivå, p.48, Totalförsvarets forskningsinstitut, October 2003. The fire in 1992, was by no means the first on the Torsburgen. In the summer of 1741, when Carl Linnaeus visited the fortress, he noted that it was almost without trees, \\"since wildfire had not so long ago destroyed it\\". The \\"wildfire\\" he spoke of was probably the large forest fire of 1655, which raged during that summer destroying parts of Alskog, Ala, Ardre and Kräklingbo parishes.

He is perceived as one of the major Finnish social democratic politicians of the 1950s and 1960s. Sports career Before his political career Leskinen was a successful swimmer in the association of Helsinki Workers' Swimmers. He won the 200 and 400 meter breaststroke events at the 1937 Workers' Olympiad in Antwerp. Leskinen was later the Secretary General of the Finnish Workers' Sports Federation 1940-1943 and the chairman 1951–1955. Leskinen fought in the Winter and Continuation Wars. He was wounded in 1941. His military denomination was a Major. Political career Leskinen was a key member in the union of brother's in arms movement which operated among the Social Democrats after the war. The group was called 'asevelisosialistit' and it defeated the Communists in the fight for a majority in several left-wing organizations. In the 1950s the fragmented Social Democratic Party was led by Väinö Tanner as figurehead while Leskinen was considered as one of the most important leaders. He was discredited by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union because of his Western- oriented political views. Leskinen sought to offset the relations with the Soviet Union following the defeat of SDP in the 1962 parliamentary election. He also tried to increase cooperation among the Left in Finland. Leskinen led the negotiations for the founding of Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions. In 1966, Leskinen visited Moscow in an effort to re-establish relations with the Communist Party of Soviet Union. Leskinen and SDP supported Urho Kekkonen in the 1968 presidential election. Leskinen was a member of the parliament from 1945–1947 and 1947–1969. His career as minister is divided into two parts. During the 1940s and 1950s, he was in the cabinet as a right- wing representative of SDP. After the reconciliation with the Soviet Union, he was a closer associate of Urho Kekkonen. *Minister for Social Affairs 1952-1953 *Minister of the Interior 1954-1955 *Minister for Social Welfare 1958-1959 *Minister of Trade and Industry 1968-1970 *Minister of Foreign Affairs 1970-1971 Väinö Leskinen died of a heart attack on his 55th birthday while skiing near Lauttasaari in Helsinki.

He had a long period off active duty because of his wounds and during this time was promoted to generalmajor and received the German Cross in Gold. Returning to duty on 15 September 1942, Angern took command of 16th Panzer Division, operating to the north of the city of Stalingrad, supporting the divisions fighting in the city. By mid-November, the division had been reduced to and had been ordered to withdraw to the Donets. The Red Army began a counteroffensive which encircled Stalingrad, trapping several elements of the division, including Angern and his staff, in the city along with the Sixth Army. Angern remained in Stalingrad throughout the siege and was promoted to generalleutnant on 21 January 1943. The advance of the Red Army pressed the Germans into the eastern portion of the Stalingrad perimeter and in mid- January, along with some other staff officers of the division, Angern considered escaping the encirclement by passing through the frontlines wearing captured Red Army uniforms accompanied by Russian Hiwis. Nothing came of the plan and Angern committed suicide on 2 February 1943, following the conclusion of the Battle of Stalingrad.

Child abuse In January 1999, a former pupil of St Barnabas School, Ravenshoe, Australia (where Waddington had been Headmaster) contacted the Bishop of North Queensland. He reported that he has been abused by Waddington in the 1960s and wanted reassurance from the bishop that it would not be allowed to happen again. In September 2003, it was reported to the Diocese of Manchester that a boy had been abused by Waddington when he was aged 11, 12 and 13, and was a chorister at Manchester Cathedral. In April 2013, it was revealed by the press that allegations of child sexual abuse had been previously made against Waddington (in 1999 and in 2003). This had resulted in his right to officiate at services being removed by the then Archbishop of York, David Hope, Baron Hope of Thornes. However, he was not reported to the police; Hope had cited his \\"[concern] about Waddington's state of health\\" as the reason for not doing so. One of Waddington's reported victims spoke to The Times in May 2013, described how he was groomed by Waddington while he was a choir boy at Manchester Cathedral in the 1980s. The sexual abuse started when he was 13 and continued until he moved away to university. He had reported the abuse to the police in October 2012. David Hope among others was censured for failing to act when complaints were made which put other children at risk. Bishop David Walker praised the current Archbishop of York, John Sentamu for starting an enquiry. Walker also praised the courage of those who spoke out about abuse and said: See also *Anglican Church sexual abuse cases References Category:1927 births Category:People from Bognor Regis Category:People educated at Dulwich College Category:Alumni of Selwyn College, Cambridge Category:Alumni of Ely Theological College Category:Anglican deans Category:Deans of Manchester Category:2007 deaths ","title":"Robert Waddington"},{"id":"27020942","text":"David R.

Following their seizure of power, the Sandinistas ruled the country first as part of a Junta of National Reconstruction. Following the resignation of centrist members from this Junta, the FSLN took exclusive power in March 1981. Oppositional rebels, known as Contras, formed in 1981 to resist the Sandinista's Junta and received support from the American Central Intelligence Agency. The 1984 elections, described by international observers as fair and free, 1984: Sandinistas claim election victory, BBC - On This Day were boycotted by the main opposition party. The FSLN won the majority of the votes. Those who did oppose the Sandinistas won approximately a third of the seats. Despite the clear electoral victory for the Sandinistas, the Contras continued their violent attacks on both state and civilian targets, until 1989. The FSLN lost elections in 1990 to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, after revising the constitution in 1987 and after years of resisting the United States-supported Contras, but retained a minority of seats in the legislature. Nicaraguan Revolution The FSLN evolved from one of many opposition groups to a leadership role in the overthrow of the Somoza regime. By mid-April 1979, five guerrilla fronts opened under the joint command of the FSLN, including an internal front in the capital city Managua. Young guerrilla cadres and the National Guardsmen were clashing almost daily in cities throughout the country. The strategic goal of the Final Offensive was the division of the enemy's forces. Urban insurrection was the crucial element because the FSLN could never hope to achieve simple superiority in men and firepower over the National Guard. On June 4, a general strike was called by the FSLN to last until Somoza fell and an uprising was launched in Managua. On June 16, the formation of a provisional Nicaraguan government in exile, consisting of a five-member Junta of National Reconstruction, was announced and organized in Costa Rica. The members of the new junta were Daniel Ortega (FSLN), Moisés Hassan (FPN), Sergio Ramírez (the \\"Twelve\\"), Alfonso Robelo (MDN) and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the widow of La Prensa's director Pedro Joaquín Chamorro. By the end of that month, with the exception of the capital, most of Nicaragua was under FSLN control, including León and Matagalpa, the two largest cities in Nicaragua after Managua. On July 9, the provisional government in exile released a government program, in which it pledged to organize an effective democratic regime, promote political pluralism and universal suffrage, and ban ideological discrimination, except for those promoting the \\"return of Somoza's rule\\". On July 17, Somoza resigned, handed over power to Francisco Urcuyo, and fled to Miami. While initially seeking to remain in power to serve out Somoza's presidential term, Urcuyo seceded his position to the junta and fled to Guatemala two days later. On July 19, the FSLN army entered Managua, culminating the first goal of the Nicaraguan revolution. The war left approximately 50,000 dead and 150,000 Nicaraguans in exile. The five-member junta entered the Nicaraguan capital the next day and assumed power, reiterating its pledge to work for political pluralism, a mixed economic system, and a nonaligned foreign policy.Library of Congress Country Studies: Nicaragua: The Sandinista Revolution Council of National Reconstruction (1979-1980) The Sandinistas inherited a country in ruins with a debt of 1.6 billion dollars (US), an estimated 50,000 war dead, 600,000 homeless, and a devastated economic infrastructure. To begin the task of establishing a new government, they founded a Council (or ) of National Reconstruction, made up of five appointed members. Three of the appointed members belonged to FSLN, which included - Sandinista militants Daniel Ortega, Moises Hassan, and novelist Sergio Ramírez (a member of Los Doce \\"the Twelve\\"). Two opposition members, businessman Alfonso Robelo, and Violeta Barrios de Chamorro (the widow of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro), were also appointed. Only three votes were needed to pass law. The FSLN also established a Council of State, subordinate to the junta, which was composed of representative bodies. However, the Council of State only gave political parties twelve of forty-seven seats, the rest of the seats were given to Sandinista mass-organizations. Of the twelve seats reserved for political parties, only three were not allied to the FSLN. Due to the rules governing the Council of State, in 1980 both non-FSLN junta members resigned. Nevertheless, as of the 1982 State of Emergency, opposition parties were no longer given representation in the council. The preponderance of power also remained with the Sandinistas through their mass organizations, including the Sandinista Workers' Federation (), the Luisa Amanda Espinoza Nicaraguan Women's Association (), the National Union of Farmers and Ranchers (), and most importantly the Sandinista Defense Committees (CDS). The Sandinista controlled mass organizations were extremely influential over civil society and saw their power and popularity peak in the mid-1980s.  Sandinista period (1979 - 1990)  As Nicaragua's government collapsed and the National Guard commanders escaped with Somoza, the U.S. first promised and then denied them exile in Miami. The rebels advanced on the capital victoriously. On July 19, 1979 a new government was proclaimed under a provisional junta headed by 35-year-old Daniel Ortega and including Violeta Chamorro, Pedro's widow. The United Nations estimated material damage from the revolutionary war to be US$480 million. The FSLN took over a nation plagued by malnutrition, disease, and pesticide contaminations. Lake Managua was considered dead because of decades of pesticide runoff, toxic chemical pollution from lakeside factories, and untreated sewage. Soil erosion and dust storms were also a problem in Nicaragua at the time due to deforestation. To tackle these crises, the FSLN founded the Nicaraguan Institute of Natural Resources and the Environment. =Contras and State of Emergency= The first challenge to the powerful new army came from the Contras, groups of Somoza's National Guard who had fled to Honduras. The Contras were soon under the control of Nicaraguan business elites who opposed Sandinista policies to seize their assets. The Contra chain of command included some ex-National Guardsmen, including Contra founder and commander Enrique Bermúdez and others. One prominent Contra commander, however, was ex-Sandinista hero Edén Pastora, aka \\"Commadante Zero,\\" who rejected the Leninist orientation of his fellow comandantes. With the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980, relations between the United States and the Sandinista regime became an active front in the Cold War. The Reagan administration insisted on the \\"Communist threat\\" posed by the Sandinistas—reacting particularly to the support provided to the Sandinistas by Cuban president Fidel Castro, by the Sandinistas' close military relations with the Soviets and Cubans, but also furthering the Reagan administration's desire to protect U.S. interests in the region, which were threatened by the policies of the Sandinista government. The United States quickly suspended aid to Nicaragua and expanded the supply of arms and training to the Contra in neighbouring Honduras, as well as allied groups based to the south in Costa Rica. President Reagan called the Contras \\"the moral equivalent of our founding fathers.\\" In March 1982 the Sandinistas declared an official State of Emergency. They argued that this was a response to attacks by counter- revolutionary forces.Prevost, p. 153 The State of Emergency lasted six years, until January 1988, when it was lifted. Under the new \\"Law for the Maintenance of Order and Public Security\\" the \\"Tribunales Populares Anti-Somozistas\\" allowed for the indefinite holding of suspected counter-revolutionaries without trial. The State of Emergency, however, most notably affected rights and guarantees contained in the \\"Statute on Rights and Guarantees of Nicaraguans. Many civil liberties were curtailed or canceled such as the freedom to organize demonstrations, the inviolability of the home, freedom of the press, freedom of speech and, the freedom to strike. All independent news program broadcasts were suspended. In total, twenty-four programs were cancelled. In addition, Sandinista censor Nelba Cecilia Blandón issued a decree ordering all radio stations to hook up every six hours to government radio station, La Voz de La Defensa de La Patria. The rights affected also included certain procedural guarantees in the case of detention including habeas corpus. In 1982, legislation was enacted in the U.S. to prohibit further direct aid to the Contras. Reagan's officials attempted to illegally supply them out of the proceeds of arms sales to Iran and third party donations, triggering the Iran-Contra Affair of 1986-87. =1984 Election= The Sandinistas were victorious in the national election of November 4, 1984, gathering 67% of the vote. The election was certified as \\"free and fair\\" by the majority of international observers. Other observers, the Nicaraguan political opposition and the Reagan administration claimed political restrictions were placed on the opposition by the government, and that a relatively short period of greater openness was not sufficient for a free election.\\"Nicaragua Campaign Races to Chaotic Finish,\\" Christian Science Monitor, November 2, 1984 The primary opposition candidate was the U.S.-backed Arturo Cruz, who succumbed to pressure from the United States governmentSmith, Wayne S., Lies About Nicaragua, Foreign Policy (Summer 1987) not to take part in the 1984 elections; later US officials were quoted as saying, \\"the (Reagan) Administration never contemplated letting Cruz stay in the race, because then the Sandinistas could justifiably claim that the elections were legitimate...Other Administration officials vehemently denied this contention. L. Craig Johnstone, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Central America, said...'Anyone who would allege that we don't favor full participation in the election doesn't know what he's talking about.'\\" Key Aides Dispute U.S. Role in Nicaragua Vote, New York Times, October 21, 1984 Other opposition parties such as the Conservative Democratic Party and the Independent Liberal party, were both free to denounce the Sandinista government and participate in the elections.The Electoral Process in Nicaragua: Domestic and International Influences, Latin American Studies Organization Cambridge historian Christopher Andrews claimed that it was later discovered that the FSLN had, in fact, been actively suppressing right-wing opposition parties while leaving moderate parties alone, with Ortega claiming that the moderates \\"presented no danger and served as a convenient facade to the outside world\\".Andrew, Christopher et al. The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World, Basic Books, September 20, 2005. In 1993, the Library of Congress wrote \\"Foreign observers generally reported that the election was fair. Opposition groups, however, said that the FSLN domination of government organs, mass organizations groups, and much of the media created a climate of intimidation that precluded a truly open election.\\". Ortega was overwhelmingly elected President in 1984, but the long years of war had decimated Nicaragua's economy and widespread poverty ensued.  1990 election  The long war against the Contras severely weakened Nicaraguan economy, weakening the position of the Sandinistas. The elections of 1990, which had been mandated by the constitution passed in 1987, saw the Bush administration funnel $49.75 million of ‘non-lethal’ aid to the Contras, as well as $9m to the opposition UNO--equivalent to $2 billion worth of intervention by a foreign power in a US election at the time, and proportionately five times the amount George Bush had spent on his own election campaign.Christian Smith, Resisting Reagan: The US Central America Peace Movement, University of Chicago Press, 1996Noam Chomsky, Deterring Democracy, Vintage, 1992 When Violetta Chamorro visited the White House in November 1989, the US pledged to maintain the embargo against Nicaragua unless Violeta Chamorro won.Rita Beamish, ‘Bush Will Lift Trade Embargo if Nicaraguan Opposition Candidate Wins’, Associated Press, 8 November 1989 In August 1989, the month that campaigning began, the Contras redeployed 8,000 troops into Nicaragua, after a funding boost from Washington, becoming in effect the armed wing of the UNO, carrying out a violent campaign of intimidation. No fewer than 50 FSLN candidates were assassinated. The Contras also distributed thousands of UNO leaflets. Years of conflict had left 50,000 casualties and $12b of damages in a society of 3.5m people and an annual GNP of $2b. The proportionately equivalent figures for the US would have been 5 million casualties and $25 trillion lost. After the war, a survey was taken of voters: 75.6% agreed that if the Sandinistas had won, the war would never have ended. 91.8% of those who voted for the UNO agreed with this.

Biography  Kontagora was among the first intake of officers when the Nigerian Defense Academy opened in 1964. Kontagora was appointed Minister of Works and Housing in the Babangida government. In 1991 he issued regulations on pollution abatement and effluent limitations covering all industries, with heavy fines for non-compliance. However, follow-up by the government on infractors was limited. In December 1991, he announced plans to draw up guidelines by early 1992 to control oil pollution. The Sani Abacha government appointed Kontagora sole administrator of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 1995 after a major conflict at the university. He remained in charge until some time after the death of Abacha. Kontagora was appointed Administrator of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) on 22 August 1998. The brief period when Kontagora was in charge of the FCT saw a boom in construction of housing and infrastructure. Kontagora ceded a strategic plot next to the International Conference centre to the Abuja Horticultural Society to develop as a world standard park, now the Abuja International Peace Park, finally opened in 2003. In January 1999 Kontagora said that all structures had been put in place to ensure a smooth transition to democracy in May 1999. Kontagora was a candidate to represent the People's Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2003 elections for FCT Senator, but was defeated in the primaries by Isa Maina, who went on to be elected. In October 2004 Kontagora announced that he would be a candidate to contest the 2007 presidential elections on the PDP platform. He was cleared as a candidate by the PDP, but was defeated by Umaru Yar'Adua, who went on to be elected. He died in the late hours of May 29, 2013. He was 69.

Career Pisacane started his career at Genoa, where he was initially a member of the team's youth system. At the age of 14, however, he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, which seriously threatened his career, as it caused him to experience temporary paralysis in his limbs. After recovering, he was promoted to the reserve side, where he remained from 2003 to 2005. He made his professional debut during the 2005–06 season, while on loan with Ravenna. After several seasons in Serie C, he was signed by Chievo on a free transfer in 2008, but joined Lumezzane in a co-ownership deal, along with his Chievo teammates Tommaso Chiecchi and Amedeo Calliari. During the 2009–10 season, he left for Serie B side Ancona. During the 2010–11 season, he remained at Lumezzane along with Francesco Checcucci. In June 2011, Lumezzane purchased the remaining 50% registration rights for Pisacane from Chievo, while Chievo bought back Checcucci. In his sole season with Lumezzane, he refused €50,000 to defeat his own team against Ravenna, becoming a hero, along with Simone Farina, of the illegal betting war; the two players were later rewarded by being named FIFA ambassadors in 2012, while Pisacane was even invited by manager Cesare Prandelli to train with the Italy national football team later that year. In August 2011, he terminated his contract with Lumezzane. The next day, he was signed by Ternana on a one-year contract, rejoining former teammate Davide Carcuro. He won Lega Pro Prima Divisione and was the losing side of Supercoppa di Lega di Prima Divisione. On 14 June 2012, he extended his contract. On 11 July 2013, he was signed by Avellino, where he remained for two seasons. On 14 July 2015, he was signed by Cagliari. He helped the club obtain promotion to Serie A during his first season with the side, and subsequently made his Serie A debut in a 3–0 win over Atalanta, on 18 September 2016 the following season, at the age of 30; having finally achieved his childhood dream of playing in the top Italian division, he was moved to tears during the post-match interview.

It began as The Literary and Theological Institute of the Lutheran Church in the Far West in Hillsboro, Illinois, in 1847. It soon became known as the Lutheran College, and, locally, as Hillsboro College. In 1852, it relocated to Springfield and changed its name to Illinois State University. It ceased operations in 1868, but reopened as Carthage College in Carthage, Illinois, in 1870.  Hillsboro era  In 1835, the residents of Hillsboro raised funds to build a school building known as the Hillsboro Academy. John Tillson was the largest contributor, and he also guaranteed the full payment of the teachers and donated various equipment. The first classes were held in November 1837. Courses of study for both boys and girls were provided. In 1846, the academy's board of trustees petitioned the Illinois Senate to transfer its charter to the Literary and Theological Institute of the Lutheran Church in the Far West. The petition was granted in 1847 and the name was changed to Lutheran College. The academy thereby became part of the college. Although the college was an institution of the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Northern Illinois, it was still well supported by the general community, and was generally known as Hillsboro College. In an effort to raise $10,000 for an endowment, subscriptions for scholarships were sold. A subscription of $125 gave a 12-year scholarship; $200, a 25-year scholarship, and $400, a perpetual scholarship. The scholarships were also transferable. In 1852, the Lutherans moved the college to Springfield, the state capital, thinking it would have better prospects. However, the academy remained in Hillsboro, reopening as the original name, Hillsboro Academy. The academy continued to operate until January 28, 1880, at which time it passed into the control of the local public school.  Springfield era  Leading citizens in Springfield had, in 1852, proposed that the college's trustees relocate the college to their city, As incentives, they offered the college $37,000 for construction of a building and for scholarships. The trustees accepted the proposal, despite the fact that the college was debt-free and the building in Hillsboro was worth $6,000. They petitioned for, and received, a new charter as The Illinois State University that allowed the college to create departments not only of theology and of medicine and law, but also of \\"mechanical philosophy\\" and of agriculture. While the theology department was to teach Lutheran doctrine, the Lutheran leaders wanted the other departments to be conducted in a nonsectarian manner according to the principles of general Protestant Christianity. Also in 1852, the school again offered perpetual scholarships, this time for $300. Buyers could either pay the $300 outright, or could pay 6% interest each year. Abraham Lincoln used the latter method, obtaining a scholarship on October 1, 1852, to use for his son, Robert Todd Lincoln. The younger Lincoln entered the preparatory department on the college at age 11 in the fall of 1854, and became a freshman at age 13. Also among the students during the period it was in Springfield was John Hay, who was later Abraham Lincoln's private secretary. On June 28, 1860, Abraham Lincoln was elected to a one-year term as a trustee, making him perhaps the most famous individual associated with the school. By 1855, the school's financial situation had become precarious. Many of the pledges made by Springfield residents to encourage the school to relocate had not been paid; payments for the perpetual scholarships also lagged. The trustees had hoped that the Illinois legislature would distribute money from the state's Seminary and College Fund to struggling schools such as theirs, but that aid never materialized. The Rev. Francis Springer, who had been president of the college since its founding in 1847, was blamed by some for the situation. He resigned, and professor S. W. Harkey was appointed interim president. The building debt was $15,000, and another $3,000 was owed to Harkey. Adding to the financial difficulties, the number of students declined from 160 in 1854 to 114 in 1856. Despite the appointment of the Rev. W. M. Reynolds as president, conditions worsened, such that by 1858, an additional debt of $2,682 in unpaid faculty salaries had been incurred. Efforts to increase payments and donations allowed the school to continue operating although still in a precarious financial state. A proposal that the college be moved to another city caused some Springfield residents to contribute more money, but that increase was only temporary. During the 1850s, the number of German and, especially, Scandinavian Lutherans immigrating to the region increased. In turn, their enrollment in the college likewise increased. In 1858, Lars Paul Esbjorn was appointed professor of Scandinavian languages. On March 31, 1860, he abruptly resigned and advised the Scandinavian students to go home, which all but two did. Esbjorn's stated reason for his departure was that he had not been allowed to give proper religious advice and supervision to the Scandinavian students, although it is likely that growing nativistic sentiments among American-born students had resulted in making the Scandinavian students feel unwelcome. Underlying this were the religious differences that had developed within the Lutheran Synod of Northern Illinois. The Scandinavian Lutherans wanted a complete adherence to the Lutheran Confessions, while others in the synod saw those confessions as only mostly correct. A few months later, on June 10, 1860, the Scandinavian Lutherans withdrew from the Synod of Northern Illinois and formed the Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod. Later that same year, Esbjorn and others established Augustana College and Seminary in Chicago. The loss of the Scandinavian students only added to the school's problems. The outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 caused a further decrease in enrollment to less than 70 in 1862. President Reynolds resigned that year. During the war, a number of students left to enlist in the army, and discipline among the remaining students was lacking. Moreover, the development of the public school system in Illinois meant that high school students who would have attended the academy department of the school instead enrolled in their local public schools, further decreasing the income to Illinois State University.  Closure  By 1867, the situation had become dire. The doctrinal disagreements resulted in the college coming into the control of a new synod that was founded in that year, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Central Illinois, but that synod was unable to provide any support. The trustees made a proposal to Wittenberg College in Springfield, Ohio, that the two schools combine their seminaries at the Illinois location as the Lutheran Seminary of the West, but the Ohio school was not interested. All efforts having failed, Illinois State University closed in 1868. At the final meeting of the board of trustees, the college building was leased to two Presbyterians, Rev. J. W. Scott and H. C. Donnel, who opened Springfield College the next year. The property was sold in a Sheriff's Auction and Rev. William Passavant used it for an orphanage for a short period of time. In 1870, the college was reopened by several of the faculty as Carthage College in Carthage, Illinois. It remained in Carthage until 1964, when the school moved to its current campus in Kenosha, Wisconsin, which it had opened as a second campus in 1962. A group from Trinity Lutheran Church in Springfield also attempted to use the Illinois State University building for a new school, the Evangelical Lutheran Female College and Normal School, but were unsuccessful because no faculty and only a few students could be found. In August 1874, the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod bought the property for $7,474.38 and moved the 29 pre-seminary students of its practical seminary, along with one instructor, from St. Louis to the Springfield campus.

(Tom) Fleming [picture] (picture of the winning team at the State Library of Western Australia) On his return to his home town, he was awarded the Whitley Bay Town Cup and Freedom of the BoroughWhitley Bay Town Medal list Biography Drysdale was born in Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne. His family had been Blacksmiths for generations at Bowsden in the north of Northumberland, but Drysdale's father, John, moved to Heaton in the eighteen nineties to start his own Blacksmith's business. Drysdale was educated at Newcastle Royal Grammar School 1915–1920 and, after working on the quayside in Newcastle upon Tyne for a shipping firm, started his own haulage contracting firm in 1933 when he moved to live in Whitley Bay. Bowls career After a promising football career, brought to a halt by injury, Drysdale had started to play lawn bowls at the Whitley & Monkseaton Bowling Club and won many local competitions leading him to be selected to play for Northumberland. In 1953 he was successful in winning through to the last 64 of the English national singles competition who then played at Paddington in London to determine the overall winner. Sid reached the semi-final before losing to international Algy Allen after a close and exciting match watched by a very large crowd. As a result, in 1954 he was selected to play for England as a skip. After skipping his rink of four to ten international matches he remained an English international until 1965. The highlight of his time as an English international player was winning England's first gold medal, as skip of their lawn bowls four/rinks with David Bryant, Tom Fleming and Les Watson, at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in 1962, held in Perth, Western Australia. For this achievement Drysdale was awarded the Whitley Bay Town Cup and given the Freedom of the Borough. Retirement After his international appearances came to an end in 1965 Drysdale continued to play bowls for his county and club in Whitley Bay until he died suddenly on 26 February 1969. His death was reported nationally and internationally by the press and hundreds attended his funeral in Whitley Bay in support of his widow Emily, two sons (Alderman Peter Drysdale and Mr. Ian Drysdale) and other family members. Match of the Day Drysdale remains the only lawn bowler to have ever been featured on football's Match of the Day programme. This occurred on Saturday 24 November 1962 when, during the programme, Kenneth Wolstenholme congratulated him on winning England's first Gold Medal and showed a film clip of him following one of his bowls down the rink to the applause of the crowd at the bowling green in Perth, Western Australia. He went on to mention that Sid had been nicknamed \\"the crab\\" by the spectators and TV audience in Australia because of the unusual way he ran down the green behind his bowls. This was mentioned again while Sid was present at the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year event in December 1962.

ARCHIVE stands for Architecture for Health In Vulnerable Environments. ARCHIVE Global was founded by Utne Reader visionary Peter Williams in 2006. Initially started in the United States, the organization welcomed ARCHIVE UK, its first affiliate based in the United Kingdom in 2009. ARCHIVE currently has ongoing projects in Bangladesh, Cameroon, Haiti, and the UK. Projects implement design solutions in housing to combat diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Malaria, respiratory diseases, diarrheal diseases, and neglected tropical diseases. ARCHIVE Global is the winner of the 2013 Katerva Award for Urban Design, and was also named by Forbes magazine as one of the World's Best Sustainability ideas. Mission and Approach ARCHIVE Global focuses on combating diseases among the most vulnerable communities around the world through better housing design. On a preventative level, the organization advocates renovating inadequate housing for the economically disadvantaged in a bid to reduce their vulnerability to disease and ill health. It advocates a treatment-based approach by the creation of home-based care facilities for those already suffering from ill health thus making housing central to the delivery of suitable care.“Clean, warm housing is an essential input for prevention and care of diseases of poverty like HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, Diarrhea, and Malaria.”D. Kissick, et al, Housing for All: Essential for Economic, Social, and Civic Development, a 28 page manuscript prepared for the World Urban Forum III by Planning and Development Collaborative International (PADCO), 2006 ARCHIVE's approach utilizes research, construction, and training to create a sustainable model for implementing an integrated, systems approach to housing and health. It is meant to target the health challenges faced by individual households and provides them with the skills to sustain these changes in the future. ARCHIVE's building initiatives are intended to promote sustainability and involvement among communities and community members. Meetings are held with the communities to discuss the health challenges faced as well as the ways that design improvements target specific goals. Individuals are trained to evaluate the conditions of their home, as well as utilize local materials and techniques to build healthier homes. In doing so, housing and health are improved, whilst a burden is lifted off public health services. Through this model, ARCHIVE works to ensure greater productivity within households, along with skills creation, greater employment opportunities and income. Moreover, the cost of projects is offset by using community ‘sweat equity’ and existing local finance facilities. Currently ARCHIVE Global is the only organization working globally to prioritize a combined health and housing approach to improve lives while encouraging communities to invest in identifying and creating solutions. History ARCHIVE Global was founded by Peter Williams. ARCHIVE was developed from a three-year independent research project at Columbia University where Williams trained as an architect. His research reinforced the basic link between housing and health outcomes in South African communities. In 2005, Williams created a blog to encourage debate around public health policy, planning, epidemics, and architecture. This led to the formation of ARCHIVE Global in New York, in 2006 followed by ARCHIVE UK three years later. Current Projects =UK= In 2010 ARCHIVE UK launched the Happy, Healthy Households Partnership with NHS Brent, the Brent Council, the Brent Refugee and Migrant Forum and various community organizations. The purpose of the partnership is to raise awareness of the link between Tuberculosis and housing. The focus is on the London Borough of Brent, as it has the highest rate of TB of any London Borough, after Newham, with 101.12 new cases per 100,000 of population. The majority of those cases occur among minority communities. ARCHIVE UK has continued community based awareness raising workshops and events beyond the Happy, Healthy Households project and has plans to extend into Newham in the near future. =Haiti= In Haiti, ARCHIVE Global works in partnership with Housing Works and Foundation Esther Boucicault Stanislas (FEBS). FEBS is a community organization based in Saint- Marc that provides access to medicine and works to improve the quality of life for people living with HIV/AIDS. In 2010, six months after the 2010 Haiti earthquake ARCHIVE Global launched Kay e Sante nan Ayiti (Creole for Housing and Health in Haiti), a project to raise awareness of how housing can form part of a strategy to reduce the transmission of airborne diseases such as TB. As an integral part of the project, a global design competition called on architects, engineers, health specialists and the general public to pool their knowledge and submit housing designs which would mitigate disease transmission while remaining sympathetic to the local environment. An interdisciplinary panel of judges and the local community chose five winning designs for construction in an integrated community development and healthcare pilot project in the coastal port town of Saint-Marc, in western Haiti, an hour's drive () from the capital, Port-au-Prince. Construction began in 2011 on the prototype houses. The winning design, 'Breathe House' was constructed in 2012 by local community members, ARCHIVE Global and volunteers from reCOVER initiative of the University of Virginia and BGF (Building Goodness Foundation). =Cameroon= In 2011, ARCHIVE Global began work in Yaoundé on a project to reduce the prevalence of malaria in informal settlements. On World Malaria Day in March 2012 an international design competition was launched to find architectural solutions to protect against malaria. Winning designs were announced in October 2012. These designs use screened doors, windows and eaves, and adequate ventilation, sewage and drainage solutions to directly halt vector mosquitoes and reduce the incidence of malaria. Through partnerships with local organizations, ARCHIVE creates awareness regarding the important role of housing in the effective elimination of malaria in Cameroon and to involve both global and local actors in all stages of the project. The main objectives of the project include training people in home improvements for disease prevention, improving living conditions for households, improving awareness of malaria prevention, reducing malaria incidences, and developing best practice guidelines for malaria control through housing design. Final evaluation of the project will be conducted by early 2016. =Bangladesh= In 2013, ARCHIVE drafted the plans for Health From the Ground Up, a project targeted towards reducing infant and child mortality in the Bangladeshi capital of Dhaka. Deprivations in living standards (such as flooring and sanitation) contribute to nearly half of all multi-dimensional poverty experienced in Bangladesh. To overcome the burden of unhygienic and unsanitary housing conditions among those most vulnerable to infectious diseases, ARCHIVE collaborated with ADESH (Association for Development of Economic and Social Help) to establish a pilot-flooring project in 2014. The \\"Health From the Ground Up\\" initiative served to replace dirt/mud floors with concrete flooring in Bangladeshi homes and, through this intervention, target a major transmission pathway for gastrointestinal and parasitic pathogens. The project also sought to raise awareness on other basic environmental and housing interventions that can have positive impacts on health to enhance knowledge and provide participants with skills so that they may better spread these ideas throughout the community. Future Projects ARCHIVE is in the process of expanding projects to other regions of the world. Currently under way are projects addressing sanitation needs in slum dwellings in Brazil, as well as using preventative housing and design measures to decrease the transmission of Chagas disease in Bolivia. ARCHIVE also seeks to expand projects domestically, hoping to address inadequate housing for disadvantaged communities in the United States. Recognition ARCHIVE Global was named by UBS as Charity of the Year in 2012. In 2013, ARCHIVE was the winner of the Katerva Award in Urban Design.

It differs from mainstream Christianity in that it maintains that BCS is not a church but the new Kingdom of God on Earth and that its founder, Leader Olumba Olumba Obu, is the Holy Spirit personified, the God of all creation; while His first begotten Son His Holiness Olumba Olumba Obu is the returned Jesus Christ. BCS incorporates into Christian teaching ideas of Incarnation, Decarnation, reincarnation and traditional African religions. In the 1990s it was a millenarian religion. Beliefs Central belief: Love towards other men.What is Brotherhood Of the Cross and Star God: God is biospiritually interconnected with all things in nature, is male and female, and good and evil.\\"Olumba Olumba Obu and African Traditional Culture\\" by Friday M. Mbon, 1985 Jesus: Jesus did not have time to fully communicate his beliefs before crucifixion, and Obu’s role has been to explain, expand upon and add to his teaching. This is why a part of Brotherhood teaching has no counterpart in either the Old or the New Testament.\\"Brotherhood for Beginners\\" by Sister R.Goring His son, Rowland, continues to add to the teachings. BCS followers suggest that Obu’s achievements have been superior to that of Jesus. Reincarnation: Because of a belief in the transmigration of souls between humans and animals, BCS members practice vegetarianism and veganism.Some Doctrines of BCS (They are also teetotal.) Medicine: The BCS website expressly says that “BCS do not believe in medicine of any form”. Olumba Olumba Obu: In official BCS literature, it is suggested that Obu has the attributes of God, although Obu has gone on record as saying \\"I am not Jesus Christ or God.\\". BCS believes that calamity will come if the world does not worship Obu as God.A Divine Message Olumba Olumba Obu Obu was born in 1918 in Biakpan, a village in Biase Local Government Area in Cross River State, South south Nigeria.Who is Olumba Olumba Obu? There are various stories about his early life told by the Brotherhood, and how he performed miracles right from birth. He performed his first miracle when he was just 3 days old. A blind woman who went to carry him received her sight. He later grew up performing more spectacular miracles. This made people to accuse him of being possessed of evil spirit. The BCS sect was officially founded by Obu in 1956.Offiong, Essien A (1987). \\"Schism and Religious Independency in Nigeria: The Case of the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star\\". In Hackett, Rosalind I. J. New Religious Movements in Nigeria. New York: Edwin Mellen Press. pp. 179–190 The leader teaches that the sect, the \\" Brotherhood\\" which means love and unity was founded spiritually by God himself in the Garden of Eden during creation. Obu's teachings revolves around love and the BCS members are well known for going bare footed in their sparkling white robes. Encyclopedia of New Religious Movements, edited by Peter Clarke, p.81) In the year 2000, Obu crowned his Son then Rowland as the administrative and spiritual head of the sect. Rowland's name was changed to His Holiness Olumba Olumba Obu.Pastor Lovina Amangala Iburene of The Truth Ministry/The True Lovers of Christ World Charity Ministry, Lagos, reported in News Express, 22/11/2012. He has since led the sect with love as the motto. Choristers of the BCS are known for singing melodiously without drums and instruments to the delight of listeners. Olumba Olumba Obu (son) Great Leader Olumba Olumba Obu's first son, previously known as Rowland, now teaches in the place of his father. He is in charge of all activities in the sect. Members honour and respect him. His reign has brought about great development in the Kingdom like the establishment of the Starcross TV for wider evangelical coverage and schools for orphans. BCS now call him His Holiness Olumba Olumba Obu,\\"King of Kings and the Lord of Lords\\".The King of Kings Millenarianism In the 1990s BCS through their Spiritual Leader Olumba Olumba Obu said that something spectacular and unprecedented will occur in the year 2000 and that members of the fold should eschew evil, but should embrace love. He publicly declared that the 3 days darkness that was predicted by many religious leaders will not hold. This teachings of Obu was misunderstood by many. They thought that he was referring to the apocalypse. It is now understood by BCS members as having been a Spiritual statement indicating the unconditional reign and rulership of his Son Rowland Obu who took over from Obu that same year. National politics BCS is not politically inclined, but her members are involved in Nigerian politics. Their spiritual leader His Holiness Olumba Olumba Obu is renowned for making powerful declarations and predictions about Nigerian politics.BCS Press Release Many political candidates usually go to the spiritual leader for blessings. They do this amidst heavy donations to the religious sect.Akpabio: A governor on spending spree In 2015 just before the general elections, His Holiness Olumba Olumba Obu predicted during one of their services that the PDP will lose the presidential seat. It came to pass. His most recent notable prediction is the statement he made that president Muhammadu Buhari will not die while on the seat of power. He made this statement during period when the President was critically ill. By this time many Nigerians speculated that he will die while some said that he was dead already. Obu also declared that Nigeria can never be divided. In April 2019 the BCS bethel in Ghana embarked on a mediatory procession to pray for peace in the country's elections the following year. The congregation in Ghana was joined by delegates from Nigeria, Togo, Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, USA, Uganda and the UK. The march went through some principal streets in the city of Accra and ended at the Independence Square where prayers for peace were offered. International aspirations BCS has bethels (churches) in several countries other than Nigeria, and has recently formed a “Government”, sending ambassadors to different countries. The BCS also has a cable TV station, Called \\"Starcross TV\\". References .

Pre–Columbian times Reconstruction of a dalca a type of pirogue that were used in Chiloé Archipelago, by both Spaniads and Huilliches who adopted it from the Chono people In the Chiloé Archipelago a watercraft called \\"dalca\\" was of common use in Pre–Columbian times. Dalcas were made of planks and were mainly used for seafaring while wampus were used for navigating rivers and lakes. It is not known what kind of oars early Mapuches presumably used.Bengoa 2003, pp. 72–73.Bengoa 2003, p. 74. =Polynesian seafarers= In 2007, evidence appeared to have been found that suggested pre-Columbian contact between Polynesians from the western Pacific and the Mapuche people. Chicken bones found at the site El Arenal in the Arauco Peninsula, an area inhabited by Mapuche, support a pre-Columbian introduction of chicken to South America. The bones found in Chile were radiocarbon-dated to between 1304 and 1424, before the arrival of the Spanish. Chicken DNA sequences taken were matched to those of chickens in present-day American Samoa and Tonga; they did not match the DNA of European chickens. But, a later report in the same journal, assessing the same mtDNA, concluded that the Chilean chicken specimen clusters with the European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences. Thus it does not support a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In December 2007, several human skulls with Polynesian features, such as a pentagonal shape when viewed from behind, were found lying on a shelf in a museum in Concepción. These skulls turned out to have come from people of Mocha Island, an island just off the coast of Chile in the Pacific Ocean, today inhabited by Mapuche. Professor Lisa Matisoo-Smith of the University of Otago and José Miguel Ramírez Aliaga of the University of Valparaíso hope to win agreement soon with the locals of Mocha Island to begin an excavation to search for Polynesian remains on the island. Colonial Chile (1520–1810) =Spanish maritime policy= In the 16th and 17th century Spain considered the Pacific Ocean a Mare clausum – a sea closed to other naval powers. As the only known entrance from the Atlantic the Strait of Magellan was at times patrolled by fleets sent to prevent entrance of non-Spanish ships. On the western end of the Pacific Ocean the Dutch threatened the Spanish Philippines. =Shipyards in Chile= In the 18th century the shipbuilding industry in Valdivia, one of the city's main economic activities, reached its peak building numerous ships including frigates.Guarda 1973, pp. 45-47. Other shipyards of Chile included those of Concepción and Chiloé Archipelago. The Chiloé shipyards constructed he bulk of the ships in Chile until the mid-18th century. In 1794 a new shipyards was established the mouth of Maule River (present day Constitución). Despite some navigators expressing that Valdivia had better conditions than Guayaquil in Ecuador, this last port was the chief Spanish shipyard in the Pacific. Independence and republic (1810–present) During the later stages of Chile's independence war it was conceived that the country needed a navy to bring under Chilean control areas that could not be reached by land like Chiloé Archipelago and Valdivia. The newly formed Chilean navy was put under command of Lord Cochrane, who introduced British customs. The Chilean navy succeeded in capturing Valdivia and landing a Chilean-Argentine army in Peru for further fight against the royalists. Later on the Chilean navy saw action in the War of the Confederation, the Chincha Islands War, the War of the Pacific and the 1891 Chilean Civil War. The navy was also instrumental into bringing the Strait of Magellan and Easter Island under Chilean control in 1843 and 1888 respectively. During the second half of the 19th century the Chilean navy begun a series of explorations towards the Patagonian archipelagoes. These explorations where fueled by several factors including the establishment of Chilean rule in the Strait of Magellan, the increased trade with Europe and border disputes with Argentina in Patagonia. =War of the Confederation (1836–39)= =Chincha Islands War (1864–66)= =War of the Pacific (1879–1883)= The Naval Battle of Iquique of 1879 shown in the picture is remembered a public holiday each May 21 in Chile, and authorities call May the month of the sea When the War of the Pacific between Chile and the Bolivia-Peru alliance broke out the few roads and railroad lines, the disputed and nearly waterless and largely unpopulated Atacama Desert turned out to be difficult to occupy. From the beginning naval superiority was critical. Early on Chile blockaded the Peruvian port of Iquique, on April 5. Following a first naval encounter between Chile and Peru in the indecisive Battle of Chipana (April 12, 1879) the Battle of Iquique (May 21, 1879) proved one of the war's most memorable battles of the war as Huáscar engaged and sank the Esmeralda; during the battle, Chilean commander Arturo Prat was fatally shot while attempting to board the Huáscar. In the aftermath, Grau ordered the rescue of the remaining Chilean sailors. Meanwhile, the Independencia chased the schooner Covadonga until the heavier Independencia collided with a submerged rock and sank in the shallow waters near Punta Gruesa. This naval battle gave a tactical victory to Peru as it stopped the blockade of Iquique. Nevertheless, it was a Pyrrhic victory; the loss of the Independencia, one of Peru's most important ships, was a fatal blow. The Battle of Angamos, on October 8, 1879 proved decisive. In this battle, the Chilean Navy managed to capture the Huáscar after several hours of fierce battle, despite her remaining crew's attempts to scuttle her. Miguel Grau died during the fighting, but his deeds made him a Peruvian national hero. After the loss of the Huáscar, the Peruvian navy still had some successful actions, particularly during the Naval Battle of Arica (February 27, 1880) and the Second Naval Battle of Arica (March 17, 1880), but its remaining units were locked in its main port during the long Blockade of Callao. When the Peruvian capital of Lima fell after the battles of San Juan and Miraflores, the Peruvian naval officers scuttled the entire fleet to prevent its capture by the Chilean forces. =Pacific hegemony (1883–90)= In March 1885 Colombia thinned its military presence in Panama by sending troops stationed there to fight rebels in Cartagena. These favourable conditions prompted an insurgency in Panama. The United States Navy was sent there to keep order, in light of invoking its obligations according to the treaty being signed in 1846. > In response to the American intervention, Chile sent the protected cruiser Esmeralda to Panama City, arriving on April 28. The Esmeraldas captain was ordered to stop by any means an eventual annexation of Panama by the United States.William Sater, Chile and the United States: Empires in Conflict (Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1990), 52. . According to a U.S. publication in August 1885, right after the Panama events, \\"[The Esmeralda] could destroy our whole navy, ship by ship and never be touched once.\\" After navy visits to Easter Island in 1875 and 1887, Chilean navy officer Policarpo Toro managed to negotiate an incorporation of the island into Chile with native Rapanui in 1888. By occupying Easter Island, Chile joined the imperial nations. By 1900 nearly all Pacific islands were in control of Britain, France, United States, Germany, Japan, and Chile.Bernard Eccleston, Michael Dawson. 1998. The Asia-Pacific Profile. Routledge. p. 250. =Naval arms race (1890–1914)= =Naval mutiny of 1931= =1960 tsunami= On May 22, 1960 the Chilean coast from Mocha Island (38° S)and to Aysén Region (45° S) was devastated by a tsunami triggered by the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. Further north the port of Talcahuano did not suffered any mayor damages, only some flooding. Some tugboats and small sailboats stranded on Rocuant Island. The small port of Bahía Mansa had all of its new infrastructure destroyed by the tsunami that reached heights of up to 10 m.a.s.l. in that place. The boat Isabella that at was at time in the port lost its anchors. In Valdivia River and Corral Bay several vessels wrecked due to the earthquake among them Argentina, Canelos, Carlos Haverbeck, Melita and the salvaged remnants of Penco. Canelos was anchored at Corral and filling a cargo of wood and other products destined to northern Chile when the quake struck. Canelos engine was warmed up in view of this events. After hours of drifting around in Corral Bay and Valdivia River the ship wrecked and was abandoned by its crew at 18.00 PM. Two men on board of Canelos died. As of 2000 the remnants of Canelos are still visible. Santiago, another ship anchored at Corral by the time of the quake, managed to leave Corral in a bad state but wrecked off the coast of Mocha Island on May 24.

Amaki (born Lynda Faye Peek, July 8, 1949) is an African-American artist, art historian, educator, film critic and curator who recently resided in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where she was Professor of Modern and Contemporary Art at the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa from 2007 to 2012. Background Lynda Faye Peek was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the fourth of six daughters. Her father, Norman Vance Peek, was a singer with the Deep South Boys of Macon, Georgia. She was a creative child and knew from a young age that she wanted to be an artist. She met African American painter Hale Woodruff, whom she cited as an influence on her work, when she was about 10 years old and made her first sale at the age of 13. She created still lifes from yarn and burlap bags that were included in a furniture display at Rich's Department Store in Atlanta. When a customer purchased the furniture, he assumed that her work was included in the sale. Peek graduated from Georgia State University in Atlanta in 1971 with a B.A. degree in journalism and psychology. She changed her name to Amalia K. Amaki in 1978 just prior to moving to New Mexico where she obtained a B.A. degree from the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in photography and art history. Amaki earned her M.A. degree (1992) in modern European and American art and a Ph.D. (1994) in twentieth-century American art and culture from Emory University in Atlanta. Amaki has taught art history at Spelman College, Morehouse College and Atlanta College of Art in Atlanta, Georgia; Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, Georgia; and North Georgia College and State University in Dahlonega, Georgia. In 2001, she became Curator of the Paul R. Jones Collection of African American Art at the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware where she was on the faculty in the Art History and Black Studies Departments until 2007.[3] After leaving that position, she taught art, art history, and visual studies at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, Alabama until 2012. Artwork Amaki's art work explores African-American life and culture through the use of photography frequently inlaid in boxes, quilts, and fans. She embellishes these pieces with found objects, like buttons, beads, flowers, and bits of fabric. Amaki first started working with buttons as a child, when her mother gave her buttons to play with because marbles were too boyish. Her work also includes photo (cyanotype) quilts and large scale digital photographs on fabric where portraiture is used as conduits to discussions of commercial profiling, cultural branding, and methods of advancing cultural assumptions. =Collections= Amaki's works of art can be found in numerous private art collections throughout the world, and are included in the permanent collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in Houston, Texas; the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia; the Minnesota Museum of American Art in St. Paul, Minnesota; the University of Delaware in Newark, Delaware; the Albany Museum of Art in Albany, Georgia, the Hammonds House Museum in Atlanta, Georgia; the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia (MOCA-GA) in Atlanta, Georgia and the Tubman African American Museum in Macon, Georgia, among others. = Exhibitions = * \\"Amalia Amaki: Boxes, Buttons and the Blues,\\" an exhibition including 80 mixed-media works, resulted from a collaboration between the National Museum of Women in the Arts and the Spelman College Museum of Fine Art.

History The Montreal-based group Alternatives first introduced the concept of soil-less method planting in 2001. Peggy Bradley, an American developing soil-less techniques in an effort to offer low cost, ecologically sustainable and low-tech gardening solutions for poor, rural communities in places like Brazil, Morocco and India caught the attention of Alternative representatives while observing the work and efforts by the Institute for Simplified Hydroponics in Tehuacan, Mexico. After studying the method used in Mexico, Alternatives saw the benefits and possibilities for the Montreal community. The attempts to use this system in an effort to tackle food security and hunger issues on a global scale and locally was not something Alternatives could turn away from. In 2001, the Institute for Simplified Hydroponics brought their initiatives to Montreal. In 2001, Jane Rabinowicz of Santropol Roulant and Ishmael Hautecoeur of Alternatives joined forces; harvesting Roulant's local community ties and Alternative's knowledge and resources, they created what is now known as the Rooftop Garden Project.http://www.santropolroulant.org/images/Recipes%20for%20Success.doc These two young groups joined forces to create a demonstration garden of 500m2 on a rooftop located near Burnside Hall on McGill University campus and by 2006, Roulant managed to produce one third (or one tonne) of the food used for the program by growing their own produce.http://rooftopgardens.ca/?q=en/node/1759 Determined to get the entire Montreal area and beyond growing green, the Project has been relentless in creating community gardens in social-housing complexes, at schools and seniors' residences, and on rooftops, balconies and stairwells.http://www.rooftopgardens.alternatives.ca/sites/rooftopgardens.alternatives.ca/files/ready_to_grow.pdf.pdf#page=33 The Rooftop Gardens Project has dedicated countless efforts to grow produce but to also make it a community run and sustained project. By visiting schools and offering interactive programs for students from elementary to university, the Project wants to educate as many people as possible about how accessible and relatively simple it can be to grow produce. The Project encourages local businesses, building owners, educational institutions, government and borough run organizations and the Montreal citizens at large to get on board and start growing produce. The Project's desire to make gardening accessible gave them the idea to offer ready-made home grow kits so anybody who wants to can grow produce.http://communities.canada.com/montrealgazette/print.aspx?postid=335039 The Soilless-Cultivation The soil-less cultivation process uses self watering containers that are portable and adaptable for any area. The containers are constructed by recycled materials and are simple to build. In 2002, Alternatives converted a 50-gallon olive barrel into a rooftop container. Other recycled items like tires, storage bins and many other day to day items that hold water without leaking can be used. The recycled material is then lined with material such as saw dust or vermiculite to help absorb nutrients and moisture.http://network.idrc.ca/ev.php?ID=54212_201&ID2;=DO_TOPIC Organic compost from vegetables, coffee grounds and even paper is used to offer nutrients to the planted items. The containers are watered by rain, either by direct rain fall or simple irrigation systems set up using tubing leading directly into the container. The roots stay moist but need to be periodically aired out to prevent ruined crops. Produce like cucumbers, tomatoes, cherries, basil, flowers, lettuce and other leafy crops thrive in these environments and take little space to grow. Garden Organizers The initial demonstration garden is run by volunteers and staff. The Project initiative has led to autonomous gardens run by enterprises and locals, with personal gardens and collective ones. In Montreal, personal soil-less garden containers can be seen hanging from drain pipes, swirling staircases and any other area outdoors. The Project's first system, simple hydroponics has now been revamped for a more eco-friendly alternative. The new semi-hydroponic has ditched the chemical output from the simpler system and has replaced it with a self-watering system which uses compost as nutrients and soil as irrigation. This system is cleaner, inexpensive and more organic. Volunteers and Funding The initial volunteers were young adults and students, which led to high turnover rates. Since Rooftop Garden Project's initial launch in 2001, their volunteer base has become more concrete. This has facilitated its relationships with external partners. Many of Montreal's universities have come forth to help out with the projects growth by adding some of their own rooftop gardens. Concordia University in the centre of the downtown Montreal core has a recent project at its greenhouse; a great example of the many diverse factions of this burgeoning movement. McGill University, UQAM, TelUQ and the Engineers Without Borders volunteer groups have all provided funding and volunteers to the Project's vision. Santropol Roulant is itself a volunteer and donation run organization and does not have the resources to fund and expand the Project. Thus the majority of the Rooftop Garden Project is funded by Alternatives. The Project also relies heavily on donations and fundraising from the local community members and organizations like Action Comuniterre’s collective garden in the NDG borough of Montreal. To help raise funds for the Project, Comuniterre sells organic heritage seeds and plants to individuals with their own gardens and a portion of the produce grown is sold to local markets.

He was the first Bavarian fighter ace, first Bavarian ace recipient of the Pour le Merite, and first Bavarian knighted for his exploits. Biography =Early life= Max Mulzer was born on 9 July 1893 in the Kingdom of Bavaria in the German Empire. =Military service= Mulzer graduated from cadet training with the Royal Bavarian Cadet Corps on 10 July 1914, and was commissioned in the 8th Cavalry Regiment on 13 December 1914. He transferred to aviation on 20 August 1915. He was posted to FA 4 on 13 December, but soon joined Oswald Boelcke and Max Immelmann in FFA 62. Indeed, Mulzer and Immelmann often flew together, and were referred to, respectively, as \\"Bavarian Max\\" and \\"Saxon Max\\" to differentiate them. \\"Bavarian Max\\"'s first victory, on 13 March 1916, went unconfirmed, but he had three confirmed victories between 30 March and 31 May. When FA 62 shipped out for service in Russia, Mulzer transferred to KEK Nord in June 1916 and tallied three more wins during the month, with the second one occurring during the dogfight during which his friend Immelmann was killed. Mulzer had the honor of carrying Immelmann's decorations on the black velvet Ordenkissen cushion in the funeral procession. Afterwards, he then had a fleeting assignment to FFA 32, and went on to KEK 'B'. He scored twice for them, on 8 and 22 July; the eight victories were enough at that time to earn him the Blue Max. He also received the Military Order of Max Joseph and thus earned a lifetime pension and became a non-hereditary knight entitled to be addressed by the honorific \\"Ritter von\\".The Aerodrome website page on the Max Joseph Retrieved on 28 September 2020. He moved on to FA 32, and scored twice more. On 26 September, the day after Kurt Wintgens died, Mulzer had a new airplane to test fly. Apparently prompted by news of his old comrade's death, Mulzer remarked, \\"Immelmann is dead. Parschau is dead, Wintgens is dead. Now I am next in line.\\" Then he took off from the Valenciennes airfield on a test flight, side-slipped his Albatros D.I into a hard bank, lost control, and crashed to his death.

Geography Melby Overdrev Liseleje is located 7 km north of Frederiksværk, 70 km from Copenhagen, 50 km from Roskilde, 44 km from Helsingør and 27 km from Hillerød. Liseleje Plantage, a wooded area planted in the late 19th century to combat drifting sand, is located to the east of the town. It is separated from Asserbo Plantage by Melby Overdrev, an open area which was protected in 1930. The three area adjoin Tisvilde Hegn, forming one of the largest forests in Denmark. History Areas suffering from sand drift as seen on a map from the 18th century The entire area belonged to Arresødal Manor which was created by Major General Johan Frederik Classen on 1773. Classen founded the fishing village in 1784 with the aim of providing food for the workers at his gunpowder mill at Frederiksværk. It was located in the outskirts of a large area which had been covered by drifting sand. The village originally consisted of just four families who were attracted to the site by freedom of taxes. The village was named after Classen's stepdaughter Elisabeth (Lise). Liselængen, a motel opened in 1936 Unlike in many of its neighbouring fishing communities, a proper harbour was never built and commercial fishing ended in the 1960s. Tourism began to develop in the early 1930s when the first boarding houses opened and many summer houses were built. Today The ice house Liseleje still features some of the original, thatched fishermen's houses as well as many early summerhouses. Liselængen, which still offers accommodation, has been a pension (Danish:Pensionat) since 1936.

It is a four-season resort which opened as the Jack and Jill Ranch in 1937. It has been the location of the Rothbury Music Festival two times, and has hosted the Electric Forest Festival annually since 2011. Double JJ has expanded to include a golf course, an indoor water park, indoor mini golf, and an old western mock town, known as the \\"Back Forty.\\" Future plans include a brand new conference center that will break ground in 2018.  History  In 1914 George and Mary Stouch left their home in Central Germany and settled on of farmland in Western Michigan. The farm included a brick home built by the Kennedy family in 1894. The land also embraced a large, spring fed lake, Big Wildcat Lake. In 1930 daughter Roma was employed as an instructor at a private school for girls. She was the first to use the lake setting and surrounding woods at their father’s farm commercially. She presented a summer camping experience at Wildcat Lake to her students, hoping to get their parents approval. Roma would be the councilor and instruct 8 to 12 year olds in outdoor camping, crafts, swimming, drama, dancing, and sports, including horseback riding. Her project got parental approval, and her first year brought 23 girls to her camp. The camp was named “Cedar Shores” because of the hundreds of white cedar trees surrounding the lake. A stone wall at the corner of Water and Clay road stands today with an embedded bronze plaque marking the site of the first family business attempt. The deep depression of the early thirties cut short Roma’s efforts and the Cedar Shores experience faded into history. The beauty of the lake and ease of camping was well known in the community, and during the summer of 1933 the family invited local church congregations to send their children to the farm for a supervised, well counseled summer vacation. This was the Cedar Shores experience two years later, but with kids. To honor their young guests the family renamed the farm “The Jack and Jill Ranch.” Although the kids' ranch remained only two years (followed by a more grandiose camping experience) the name Jack and Jill Ranch was a success beyond imagination and the property was called by that name until the mid-1970s when the owners decided to change the name to the Double JJ Ranch Resort, and in 2009 to the Double JJ Resort. George Storm (having changed his name from Stouch to Storm) was teaching psychology at Miami University, Florida in 1934. In addition to his classes in speech, public speaking, and psychology, he was head counselor to departing senior students. He learned that they enjoyed their vacations with people their own age, rather than with the wheel chair brigade or little brother tagging along. His concept of bringing people of the same age (18 to 35) together for an outdoor vacation and camping experience was a winner. He had just the place: The Jack and Jill Ranch. In 1936 George Storm, the college professor and visionary, took control and with family help embarked on his concept. He named the new venture The Jack and Jill Colony Camp…later changed to the Jack and Jill Ranch. The Ranch grew and expanded as George bought neighbor farms and extended marketing. The resort continues its growth to this day, drawing guests from all over the world. Keeping the Western culture and heritage in place with an emphasis on treating guests to warm, friendly, family-like experience has given the resort the distinction of being the biggest western style dude ranch east of the Mississippi.Chicago Sun Times Wally Wojack, Local Historian  Rothbury Festival/ Electric Forest Festival  The Rothbury Festival (now known as the Electric Forest Festival) was held on Double JJ's property for the first time in 2008. Performers during the festival included Snoop Dogg, 311, and John Mayer.Rothbury Festival 2008 Line- Up Due to concerns over the ownership of the ranch, as well as the potential sale of the festival grounds, there was originally uncertainty on whether or not a second festival would be held in 2009.

R. James short story of the same name. It was adapted by Luke Watson and Peter Harness for BBC Four's revival of the Ghost Story for Christmas tradition. It stars Mark Letheren as Dr Fanshawe. Plot summary The film opens with historian Dr Fanshawe waiting at a railway station for a car to arrive to take him to the house of Squire Richards, where he is to catalogue and value an archaeological collection which is to be sold. He finally gives up waiting and rides his bike to Squire Richards' house. On the way, one of his bags falls off his bike. When he unpacks his luggage later, he finds his binoculars broken. Fanshawe borrows a pair from Squire Richards. During a walk through the countryside with the Squire, Fanshawe looks at a plain field through the binoculars and spots an abbey/monastery which is invisible other than through the glasses. Next to it is the infamous Gallows Hill, where a number of people were hanged in previous times. Richards explains that it was the site of an abbey that was dissolved by Henry VIII and there is nothing left of it but a few stones. That night, Fanshawe goes alone to Gallows Hill. He hears rustling in the bushes and comes to the spot where the gallows were slid into the ground. Thoroughly frightened by the fact he's being watched, Fanshawe eventually manages to stumble out of the woods and make his way back to the Squire's house. At dinner later, Richards' butler Patten, explains to Fanshawe how a previous historian, a local clockmaker called Baxter, became obsessed with the old abbey and began sneaking off at night to dig up the bones of the hanged men and, whilst repairing the binoculars, bewitched them so that they show the abbey to anyone who looks through them. Baxter, Patten continues, disappeared without a trace. That night, Fanshawe has a nightmare where he goes to the bathroom to get a drink, only to find that the water in the cup is cloudy and contaminated. Hearing the water in the bathtub stop dripping, Fanshawe turns around, only to be terrified by a shadowy figure lurking in the darkness wearing a skull mask. The next day, Fanshawe goes back to the old abbey site with the boiled bones and sketches. Looking through the binoculars at the details of the magnificent abbey, he spots a figure lurking by one of the pillars. Fanshawe hears rustling round him and is suddenly knocked unconscious by an unseen attacker. He wakes after dark, being dragged up Gallows Hill by an unseen force to the spot where the gallows stands. Richards, Patten and a search party go looking for Fanshawe and find his abandoned bike and sketches. They also spot a flock of birds gathering on top of Gallows Hill. Venturing up to investigate, they are met with the horrifying sight of Fanshawe hanging, though he subsequently recovers. The next day Patten burns all of the sketches and boiled bones in a bonfire and throws the binoculars in after them. Squire Richards accompanies Fanshawe to the railway station and then leaves. As Fanshawe sits on a bench waiting for the train, he hears a loud rustling noise in the woods behind him, implying that the ghosts of Gallows Hill will always be with him. Cast * Mark Letheren - Dr Fanshawe * Pip Torrens - Squire Richards * David Burke - Patten * Simon Linnel - Baxter Production The film was entirely filmed on location in the Thames Valley in November 2005; The Manor House in Chertsey, originally named Barrow Hills, featured as the home of Squire Richards. It was built in 1853 and was purchased by the Ministry of Supply in 1952 who used as an Officers Mess. In 2004 it was purchased by a consortium headed by Crest Nicholson PLC since when it has been used for several film and TV dramas.The Manor House - Longcross Films website It and other locations in Turville were chosen because of their proximity to London.

Following the Smoking Popes' breakup in 1998, Double Zero had released several albums of previously recorded Smoking Popes material including 1991–1998, Live, and The Party's Over. The Smoking Popes Tribute features contributions from former members of the Smoking Popes themselves: Felumlee performs a cover of \\"Don't Be Afraid\\", while Josh and Eli Caterer perform \\"Do Something\\" with their post- Smoking Popes act Duvall. Other notable contributors to the album include Bad Astronaut, Grade, and The Ataris. Critic Tim Sendra of Allmusic remarked that a Smoking Popes tribute album seemed incredulous at first, since the band released only a few albums and did not have much mainstream success, but noted that \\"the Smoking Popes were influential in a small way. Along with Weezer, they were one of the few post-Dookie bands to add more pop than punk to their mix of punk-pop and became a source of inspiration to many of the melodically inclined emo bands.\\" He also noted the oddity of the former Smoking Popes appearing on their own tribute album, saying \\"Most bands or artists being tributed tend to steer clear of the process — it seems wrong somehow to be paying tribute to yourself.

The federal government is the largest consumer of energy nationwide. As a result, the federal government has an obligation to \\"lead by example\\" by maintaining energy efficient facilities. Federal legislation such as the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Executive Order 13423, and EISA 2007. detail the requirements for reducing building energy costs, increasing energy efficiency, using renewable energy, and water conservation.  History  The event originated in 1997, under the name 'Energy'. The name was changed to GovEnergy in 2007. GovEnergy is held in a different city every year. Previous locations have included Lake Buena Vista, Florida, Rochester, New York, Long Beach, California, Chicago, Illinois, New Orleans, Louisiana, Phoenix, Arizona, Providence, Rhode Island, and Dallas, Texas.  Activities  The training sessions are organized by a series of themed categories, commonly known as tracks. Previous tracks have included building operations & maintenance (O&M;), contracting, energy security, project financing, greenhouse gases, legislation, energy management controls systems (EMCS), renewable energy, specialty buildings, sustainbility, technology, and water efficiency. The majority of the tracks feature nine sessions, and are held over the course of two and a half days. The tracks and individual sessions have been designed to meet the needs of \\"federal facility managers, federal energy coordinators, and federal procurement officials.”.

Its taxonomic status has fluctuated several times since its initial description as a subspecies. Since 1970, it has been fully synonymized with the diadem leaf-nosed bat, recognized again as a subspecies, affirmed as a full species, demoted again to subspecies, and elevated once again to full species. Its species name \\"inornatus\\" is Latin for \\"unadorned.\\" Biology and ecology It is nocturnal, foraging at night and roosting in sheltered places during the day such as caves or old mines. It is insectivorous, feeding on beetles, moths, cockroaches, and leafhoppers. Range and habitat It is endemic to the Northern Territory of Australia. Recent records of it have all been within Kakadu National Park. Conservation As of 2020, it is considered a vulnerable species by the IUCN. It meets the criteria for this classification because it is estimated that there are fewer than 1,000 mature individuals left. However, the species does occur within a protected area and its population trend is believed to be stable. In Australia, it is federally listed as \\"endangered\\" under the EPBC Act.

The Ezeritai () were a Slavic tribe that settled in the Peloponnese in southern Greece during the Middle Ages. In the early decades of the 7th century, Slavic tribes (Sclaveni) settled throughout the Balkans following the collapse of the Byzantine Empire's defense of the Danube frontier with some groups reaching as far south as the Peloponnese.. The Sclaveni often settled in small groups (i.e., families and clans) and their demographic impact in mainland Greece was both weak and diffuse.. Of these, two groups are known by name from later sources, the Ezeritai and the Melingoi, both having settled on the slopes of Mount Taygetos. Etymology The Ezeritai apparently settled in the area known as Helos (Greek for \\"swamp\\"), from which their name derives (South Slavic ezero meaning \\"lake\\").. History The Ezeritai are mentioned in the De administrando imperio of Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 945–959), who records that they paid a tribute of 300 gold nomismata. The emperor further records that they had rebelled, along with the Melingoi, during the reign of Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–945), but were defeated by the strategos Krinites Arotras and forced to pay double tribute as a consequence.

Global warming has already changed timings of spring events such as leaf unfolding, bird migration and egg-laying. The population of species could change due to the speed at which they adapt. Changes in the ranges of plant and animal species have been observed. New species may move to Scotland with the changing climate. Shifts may occur on hillsides and species that are already confined to high mountains may become extinct in Scotland. Severe effects are likely to occur on biodiversity. Species of plants and animals that can't adapt quickly enough may become extinct or be replaced by other creatures. Coastal habitats, including machairs, may disappear due to high sea levels eroding the land. Salmon spawning beds may be wiped out by flash floods causing population problems for the species. There will be new risks to animals, plants and their habitats, including non-native pests and diseases.Scotland's Climate Change Adaption Framework - Biodiversity and Ecosystem Resilience, Scottish Government.

It is centered at the end of Somerville’s downtown Main Street and is in the same building as the town’s Borough Hall. The library offers books, movies, CDs, and periodicals. It also hosts special events, such as programs and lectures for each age group, as well as providing free WiFi access.  History  When the area's first established public library started to outgrow its structure around 1900, plans were drafted to create a more permanent building for the library. However, as the town began to expand in population, the region focused on building churches, businesses, and a hospital. The idea of a larger building for the library was delayed until the Library’s Board of Trustees could raise enough funds and gather support among the town's residents. Through funds collected from the public, the Trustees purchased a property lot on Maple Ave. Their idea of the perfect building would have large windows to let in the natural light from the sun and hired George B. Post to accomplish this dream. On April 14, 1902, the Library on Maple Ave opened its doors to the public. Just like knowledge grows, the Maple Ave location had to expand in 1924 in order to hold the growing number of books it housed. About four years later, the Library had to seek another building and was moved to the corner of Bridge and High Streets. While the Board of Trustees knew this was a temporary residence, it stayed in the Schwed building until 1958. Many plans were drawn up to find a more permanent place for the Library but the funding stalled many opportunities. It was not until 1956 when the Borough Council purchased the Elks Club building, located on West End Avenue, that the library found its permanent home. After much debate over the planned building, the Board of Trustees approved the new home in 1958. The Elks Club building is located at the end of Downtown Somerville and also houses the Borough Hall offices. More than fifty years later, the Library is still located in the Elks Club Building with no plans to move it.  Services and programs  In addition to more than 50,000 books, the Somerville Public Library has many other services and programs for town residents. It holds subscriptions to more than 100 magazines and newspapers, covering a spectrum of popular to niche categories. It also has a full selection of DVD movies and music, ranging from new releases to the classics. The library has photocopiers, offers Public Notary services, and provides free WiFi internet throughout the building. They also host special events throughout the year for ages ranging from toddlers to senior citizens. They host Friday game nights for middle and high school students to interact and play video games in a safe environment and for younger children, they have story time and arts and craft hours. The library also has film showings, talent shows, book signings, concerts and community outreach activities throughout the year. For the adults, the Somerville Public Library offers classes in chess, knitting, and other leisure activities, as well as workshops on a variety of topics and an adult literacy program. Everyone can find one activity that interests them at the Somerville Public Library.  Membership  Membership, needed to borrow library items, requires a Somerset County Library System of New Jersey card, provided for free to those who own property, live, work, or attend school in one of 15 member municipalities: Bound Brook, Branchburg, Bridgewater, Green Brook, Hillsborough, Manville, Millstone, Montgomery, North Plainfield, Peapack- Gladstone, Rocky Hill, Somerville, South Bound Brook, Warren Township, and Watchung. Those who do not meet these conditions can instead purchase an annual pass to borrow library materials.  Friends of the Somerville Public Library  Founded around 25 years ago, the Friends of the Somerville Public Library is composed of people from various age groups. They work together on different projects throughout the year to raise funds and awareness for the library. The members volunteer their time to help operate the library and run library events.

Biography A self-described \\"hillbilly activist\\", Eula was born the second of seven surviving children of Lee D. and Nanny Elizabeth Riley, tenant farmers living in Joe Boner Hollow near Greasy Creek, Kentucky. At the age of nine she attended Greasy Creek Elementary School in Pike County and graduated from the eighth grade in five years.NOTE: Greasy Creek Elementary was creek closed after the 2000-01 school year . The local high school, over 20 miles away, was too far away for her to continue her education. She briefly worked in a World War II canning factory in Ontario, New York, at the age of fifteen, but was sent back to Kentucky on charges of 'inciting a labor riot' concerned with poor working conditions. Upon returning to the mountains, she moved to Floyd County where she worked as a domestic servant for wealthy families who were boarding mine, oil and drilling workers. It was there she met her first husband, McKinley, a coal miner. They married when she was seventeen and together had five children. All were born at home: one was born premature and deaf, and another died in infancy. She rose to prominence as an activist as a member of the local 979 community group and the East Kentucky Worker's Rights Organization. She created the Mud Creek Water District and served as president of the Kentucky Black Lung Association. During President Johnson's War on Poverty she joined the VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America) program and later became one of two local Appalachian Volunteers working in the area. In response to the failed War on Poverty health program in Floyd County, in 1973, she established the Mud Creek Clinic in Grethel, Kentucky. In 1977, she divorced her first husband and the next year married Oliver Hall, a retired miner. A biography of Eula Hall, entitled Mud Creek Medicine: The Life of Eula Hall and the Fight for Appalachia, was written by Kiran Bhatraju and published by Butler Books on November 15, 2013.butlerbooks.com/mudcreekmedicine Mud Creek Clinic In 1973, Hall opened the doors to The Mud Creek Clinic in Mud Creek, Kentucky, for the uninsured and the under-insured. She began with a $1,400 donation and the commitment of two local doctors who volunteered from Our Lady of the Way hospital in Martin, Kentucky. The clinic began in a rented trailer on Tinker Fork, but it soon outgrew the facility and Hall decided to move her own family into a two-bedroom mobile home and use her own house as the new location for the clinic. She converted the three bedrooms into six exam rooms and the rest of the house into waiting rooms and offices. At the time, the clinic didn't have its own pharmacy and medications had to be delivered from the local hospital after the clinic had closed. Hall would spend half the night delivering medication to patients who had been at the clinic that day. By 1977, the patient population was so great that Mud Creek Clinic was struggling to meet the needs of the community. Patients often came from as far as Tennessee, West Virginia, and Ohio to get medical care. Mud Creek Clinic then joined forces with Big Sandy Health Care, Inc. (BSHC) a local nonprofit health care organization that operated another community clinic in neighboring Magoffin County. This merger allowed Mud Creek to receive some federal funding and widen its patient care. After the merger, Hall stayed on as a patient advocate for the Mud Creek Clinic and continues to work in that capacity today. =Clinic rebuilt following arson= In 1982, Hall and the Mud Creek community suffered a great loss when the clinic burned down at the hand of a mysterious arsonist. The next morning Hall and the clinic doctor pulled a picnic table under a willow tree and treated patients who had scheduled appointments. She had the telephone company place a telephone on the tree so that patients could call the clinic. Hall then had two used trailers joined together to use as a temporary clinic. A few months after the fire, Hall received a letter from the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) stating that they would donate funds for a new facility for Mud Creek Clinic. One of the conditions of the funding was that the community would be required to provide $80,000 in matching funds. She called a public meeting and more than 400 people showed up and pledged their support. People gave money and items to be raffled off at auction, Hall organized a two-day radiothon that raised $17,000 and multiple chicken-and-dumpling dinners that earned $1,300 apiece. With Eula's leadership, the community raised $120,000 - $40,000 more than the necessary $80,000 required by the ARC. The extra money paid for new X-ray equipment for the clinic. The new clinic opened its doors in 1984 as a modern brick building. It is still the home of the clinic today. The clinic houses its own laboratory, X-ray machines, and pharmacy. The clinic has expanded to include an adjacent building that houses a dental clinic, clothing room, and a food pantry that serves more than 100 families per month. =Current operations= The Mud Creek Clinic had more than 213,000 patient encounters last year and no one is ever turned away. As social director, Hall counsels patients on disability claims and Social Security benefits, arranges financial aid for food and drugs, answers questions about food stamps and housing opportunities, and attends civic board meetings and hearings. When patients can't afford lawyers, she often represents them in court. She wins approximately four percent of her cases. Awards and recognition Hall has received numerous awards for her advocacy work, including honorary doctorates from Berea College - Berea, Kentucky; Midway College - Midway, Kentucky; Pikeville College - Pikeville, Kentucky and Trinity College - Hartford, Connecticut. She was honored at Berea College alongside the Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu. In 2004, the Appalachian Ministries Educational Resource Center presented Hall with the Annual David S. Shuller Spirit of AMERC Award. She has received personal letters from President George Bush, Senator Mitch McConnell, and Representative Hal Rogers, among other notables who have recognized the amazing work and the ongoing effort Hall has devoted to the health and well-being of eastern Kentucky. Highway 979, which runs through the Mud Creek area, was named the Eula Hall HighwayEula Hall Highway in her honor during October 2006. Big Sandy HealthcareBig Sandy Healthcare also has started two funds in tribute to Hall. The Eula Hall Patient Assistance Fund will cover healthcare costs for uninsured and indigent patients and the Eula Hall Scholarship Fund will provide financial assistance for area students pursuing careers in healthcare or social services. The clinic has been visited by former President Bill Clinton, Senator Edward Kennedy, http://appalshop.org/channel/ted-kennedy-and-eula-hall.html Reverend Jesse Jackson, and John Edwards.

History The first meeting of an Episcopal Church group in the area was on June 24, 1889, the feast day of Saint John the Baptist. Services were held in private homes while money was slowly raised to build a church named for the saint. In 1897 Frederick A. Hind donated land at 216 Oakland Avenue, at on the bluff above his resort called Depot Hill. The cross street was named Railroad Avenue at the time (after the railroad depot there) but is now Escalona Drive. The first service was held August 10, 1898. It was formally consecrated by Bishop William Ford Nichols on June 24, 1899. The church was designed as a smaller replica of an English church. By 1961 the parish began considering ideas for relocation. In 1963 the parish hall was closed after being declared unsafe by the Capitola Fire Department. Zoning issues prevent expansion at the Depot Hill site. In 1985 the leadership of the parish decided to move to a larger location. The original chapel seated only 85, and the congregation wanted capacity for 300. New site In 1989 a new site was selected on vacant land in Aptos, California near Seacliff State Beach a few miles to the south at on McGregor Drive. In 1991 the congregation purchased the land jointly with the Santa Cruz Housing Authority. Besides 39 affordable condominium units, a small neighborhood park was also planned. Warren Callister was selected as architect. After two years of applying for permits, the Santa Cruz County Planning Commission approved the plan on May 24, 2006. The new road to the development was named Canterbury Drive at their request. The new site was designed with drought-tolerant landscaping and a rainwater collection tank. The new building opened in June 2009. The old property was sold for over $2.5 million for use as a residence. The church is part of the Episcopal Diocese of El Camino Real. the Rector was Steve Ellis.

The school's mascot is a Golden Panther named \\"Henry.\\" Austin High School is located in the heart of historic Central El Paso and serves the Central community. The school was designed by Texas contractor and architect Robert E. McKee. When the local school district ran out of money during the construction, McKee donated the remainder owed. Consequently, the school's football stadium is named in McKee's honor. The R.E. McKee Construction Company built the school and used a classic Spanish architecture. The structure is surmounted by a 103-foot tower. The classrooms had marble floors and the hallways are floored with terrazzo.

The Panther is named \\"Elroy\\" after Austin High English and Creative Writing teacher and author Elroy Bode. Bode is a famed West Texas author and has published several books, including Home Country: An Elroy Bode Reader, Commonplace Mysteries, and This Favored Place: The Texas Hill Country. In 1998, Mr. Gary Mowad, a special agent for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and former Austin teacher, approached the Austin High School about donating a stuffed panther to display on campus. Elroy was hunted illegally in Colorado by a hunter who unlawfully used a spotlight in pursuit of the panther. Consequently, Elroy was seized by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and the hunter was sentenced to four years of prison time. At the conclusion of the litigation in September 2002, the Panther was transported to El Paso and donated to the school through the Austin High School Alumni Association, who then presented this spectacular animal to Austin High School. On January 7, 2004, the Panther was placed in the lobby where it can be viewed today.

The Melingoi or Milingoi () were a Slavic tribe that settled in the Peloponnese in southern Greece during the Middle Ages. In the early decades of the 7th century, Slavic tribes (Sclaveni) settled throughout the Balkans following the collapse of the Byzantine Empire's defense of the Danube frontier with some groups reaching as far south as the Peloponnese.. The Sclaveni often settled in small groups (i.e., families and clans) and their demographic impact in mainland Greece was both weak and diffuse.. Of these, two groups are known by name from later sources, the Melingoi and the Ezeritai, of whom the Melingoi settled on the western slopes of Mount Taygetos. The origin and etymology of the name Melingoi is unknown.. History Like the Ezeritai, the Melingoi are first mentioned in the De administrando imperio, a manual on statecraft written by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos (r. 945–959). The emperor records that in his time they paid a tribute of 60 gold nomismata, but that after they had revolted and been defeated, in the reign of Romanos I Lekapenos (r. 920–945), by the strategos Krinites Arotras, they had to pay 600 nomismata.. Under Byzantine rule, the Melingoi retained an autonomous existence, but adopted Christianity and became Hellenized in language and culture.. During the period of Frankish rule in the 13th–14th centuries, they were employed by both the Frankish lords of the Principality of Achaea and by the Byzantine Greeks of the Despotate of the Morea as soldiers. For instance, according to the Chronicle of the Morea, Prince William II of Villehardouin (r. 1246–1278) awarded to the \\"great droungos of the Melingoi\\" exemption from all duties except military service. The Melingoi are still attested during the 1330s in a number of founder's inscriptions attached to churches in Laconia. One of them, Constantine Spanes, from the notable Spanes family, is called \\"tzaousios of the droungos of the Melingoi\\", implying its continued existence as a separate community. N. Nicoloudis identifies the late medieval thema of Kinsterna or Giserna (from Latin cisterna, \\"cistern\\") with the area of the Melingoi in the northwestern Mani peninsula..

She wrote it as a response to her discovery of the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd (\\"rabbit hunt of the Mühlviertel region\\"), a massacre on 2 February 1945 at the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Upper Austria. In the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd, the civilian inhabitants of the Mühlviertel hunted down and killed almost 500 prisoners, including men, women and children, who escaped from Special Barracks Number 20. February Shadows tells the story of this hunt, and its repercussions, through the eyes of a young Austrian girl named Hilde. The story combines real time narrative and flashbacks: the adult Hilde recounts the story to her adult daughter, Erica. In an inner monologue, Hilde struggles with her traumatic past and scarred present. Erica's insistent questions force her mother to confront her own suppressed memories of the event. The narrative use of fragmented sentences and stream of consciousness does not conform to the rules of traditional grammar or sentence structure. These methods encourage the reader to better understand the psyche and experiences of the protagonist. The timing of the publication is significant: during the 1980s, Austria's younger generation was trying to come to grips with their country's Nazi past. The story of a February hidden in shadows—February Shadows—forces the readers, most of whom would be Austrians, to relieve the experience of that February and thus remember a past that most Austrians wanted to suppress. In this way, it is both a culturally revealing and politically charged story. Background Prisoner shot dead at Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp = The massacre = Russian prisoners of war held in a concentration camp. The 500 prisoners to escape from Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp during Mühlviertler Hasenjagd were in similar condition. The Mühlviertler Hasenjagd took place on 2 February 1945. An estimated 500 prisoners escaped from Special Barracks Number 20 of the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. The prisoners in these barracks were considered to be intellectual Soviet officers held for fear of revolt against the National Socialists of Germany. When the alarm in nearby Mühlviertel sounded, all citizens were instructed by members of the Austrian National Socialist Party (who were under the jurisdiction of the Nazi Party) to hunt down the escaped prisoners despite their age or gender. A large massacre took place in which nearly all of the prisoners were captured and murdered by either Nazi officers or the civilians themselves. There were only seventeen known survivors.Reichart p. 142 Reichart never learned of the event until her grandmother conveyed it to her as an adult. Her shock at the hidden, unspoken tragedy initially compelled her to begin research about the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd. At this time, the Austrian government had developed renewed interest in Austria's role during World War II while Reichart had begun to explore the controversy of Austria's complicity in the Nazi era atrocities. Plot Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp The story begins with Hilde, an elderly woman, awaking in the middle of the night to the sound of her telephone ringing. Upon answering she discovers that her husband, Anton, who was staying at a nursing facility for a severe illness, has died. His death triggers feelings of loneliness and abandonment along with painful memories of the death of her older brother, Hannes, who died during World War II, sending Hilde into a state of panic and despair. Each day Hilde visits Anton's grave mentally talking to him as if he is still alive. One evening, as she is returning home, Hilde discovers that a black cat seems to be following her. The cat causes her to remember two distinct experiences from her past. The first is a memory from when she was a small child and had attempted to hide a stray cat in her bedroom. Her family was very poor and could not afford a pet, but she saved her table scraps for it anyway. One day as she was coming home, her father met her drunk in the doorway. After telling her he had snapped the cat's neck, he beat her harshly with a fly swatter. This first memory seeped into the second: her daughter, Erika, begging to keep a stray cat she had found. Anton had granted her wish, but the cat ruined the neighbors' gardens and Hilde was forced to drown it in the river. The following day, Mr. Funk, a friend of her late husband, appears at her door and pressures Hilde to join the Retiree's Union. She joins because Anton had been a member of the Austrian Socialist Party and he would have approved of her socializing with other members. Hilde assures Mr. Funk that she will attend the next evening social. Mr. Funk's visit forces another memory to resurface. She remembers her daughter asking what party Anton had belonged to during the period of National Socialism; Hilde recalled him being part of the Hitler Youth. The reader also discovers that Hilde's brother, Hannes, was killed by the Nazi Party. Erika's insolence upsets Hilde greatly. Soon after, Erika calls her mother, stating that she will be coming to visit. Erika also grieves her father's death. Hilde becomes impatient with Erika, hinting at the contradictory nature of their relationship. Hilde wants to be with her daughter, yet she feels as if her daughter is a total stranger. Erika acts boldly and actively pursues her career as a writer. Hilde believes the only reason Erika wishes to come home is to get information for her book, which is true. Hilde is angry at her daughter for forcing her to relive her past experiences; her childhood was full of poverty, loneliness, and shame. Anton had been her way out of the past, and she only wants to move forward. Hilde attends the Retiree's Union social pretending to be happy. She watches the dancers on the dance floor and mourns the absence of her husband. The dancers trigger another memory from her childhood: she sees her father kicking her mother on the dance floor and she runs out to help. Soon, both Hilde and her mother are being beaten on the ground, her father will not let them comfort each other. The only person she can turn to is her brother, Hannes, who comforts her. The memory is too painful for Hilde and she leaves the social immediately. The state of Upper Austria in relation to the country. Erika arrives the next day and announces that they will take a trip to the village so she can obtain more information for her book. (The reader must assume that the village is in the Mühlviertel.) Hilde does not wish to go, yet does not want to be excluded. As they enter the village, Hilde recalls working hard in the fields to harvest the crop left behind by farmers to have enough food for their large family. She remembers the hunger pangs and how her father could not find work. She remembers Fritzi, a member of her apartment-style household, bringing eggs and bacon on Sundays from the farmers and how she had felt proud carrying the basket into the kitchen. She had wanted her mother to be more proud of her than she was of her older and prettier sister, Monika. Hilde sees the lifeless and leafless pear tree in the village. She refers to it as the \\"February Tree\\", the tree on which Hannes was hanged. She remembers a Nazi in a black uniform telling her at school that her brother was dead. She remembers running through the snow and losing one wooden shoe in an attempt to save him. She remembers discovering he truly was dead and lying in the snow, hoping for her own death. Hilde and Erika visit her old house and she recalls beatings; they then visit the pond where she is reminded of the many loads of laundry she was forced to wash with her mother. She begrudged the freedom of her brothers who were not forced to do work, her oldest sister, Renate, who lived with their grandparents, and her delicate sister, Monika, who was never asked to manage hard labor. They walk down the lane to the old school lined with apple trees; she recalls the rough feeling of cobblestones on her sore feet and the bitter taste of the small apples. She evades a certain barn on the lane and avoids looking out into the distance towards the area which was once the site of Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp. Upon returning to their hotel room, Hilde reflects on her daughter. Her inner thoughts display envy toward Erika's privilege of being educated and her ability to choose her career. Hilde reveals that she had always wanted to be a nurse, however her dreams of a nursing career were shattered the day her village was bombed during air raids. She had watched her brother Stephen die as she was swallowed by mounds of earth. The raid had made her weak and incapable of dealing with trauma later in her life. During their stay in the Mühlviertel, Erika is able to extract information about the fateful day in February that Hilde had been pushing from her memory for many years. Hilde relays that in the middle of the night she and her siblings were awakened by the sound of sirens. Her parents and the other tenants of her home were forced to stand for a roll call in which Pesendorfer, the Nazi authority in their house, told the tenants that many Russian convicts had escaped from the nearby concentration camp. He explained that it was their duty to Germany to find and kill each one of these convicts. Hilde, being a young girl, is told to stay at the house. However, she is worried about protecting her brother Hannes, who, like her other brothers, is forced to search for prisoners, and sneaks away to find him. In her search for her brother, Hilde comes across the barn near her schoolhouse. She enters it, only to find Pesendorfer, her neighbor Mrs. Emmerich, and her brother Walter all violently killing prisoners. She runs home and finds Hannes, who informs her that he has hidden a prisoner in his wardrobe and that she must remain silent about it. The next morning the villagers attend church to commemorate Candlemas. The hunters seek purification and are urged by their pastor to side with Germany and continue the search for the prisoners. At this insistence Hilde finds herself telling Hannes' secret to her mother. The story is vague about how this information is relayed to Pesendorfer, but, he finds and kills the prisoner, then takes Hannes away to beat him for his misconduct. Hilde recalls cleaning the blood from her brother's face after the beating. The following day, she finds that Hannes has been hanged for his actions. Her guilt in the causation of two deaths is evident through her narration. Back in the present, Erika is stunned by the horrific story and deeply regrets forcing her mother to relive the event. The novel closes with the image of the mother and daughter driving away from the Mühlviertel, with Hilde at the wheel and her foot on the gas pedal.Reichart, Elisabeth. February Shadows Ariadne Press, Riverside (1989) pp. 1-141 Major themes =Psychological effects of Mühlviertler Hasenjagd= February Shadows can be categorized as a psychological novel. The entire narration is told through first person stream of consciousness, and the plot builds through the unearthing of new memories as they emerge in Hilde's mind. The story is told in a mix of past and present and the narration switches fluidly back and forth between the two. The manner of the flashbacks and the inner comments Hilde makes about each informs the reader that she wishes to repress the horrific memories of 2 February 1945. Hilde constantly reminds herself to forget the past as if her survival and sanity depended on doing so.Wolf, Christa. February Shadows, \\"Afterword\\" Ariadne Press, Riverside (1989) p. 143 Guilt has a great impact on Hilde throughout her life. She feels extreme guilt about the night of the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd and remains haunted by Hannes' words throughout her adulthood. He had said, \\"'Everyone who doesn't do something against this manhunt makes himself GUILTY.'\\"Reichart, p. 128 Not only through omission does she feel regret for the massacre, but she holds herself personally responsible for the deaths of the escaped prisoner and of her favorite brother, Hannes. Her guilt plagues her throughout the novel.Michaels, Jennifer E. \\"Breaking the Silence: Elisabeth Reichart's Protest against the Denial of the Nazi past in Austria.\\" German Studies Review. Vol. 19, No. 1 (1996) pp. 9-27 JSTOR. German Studies Association. p. 17 Critic Donna Hoffmeister describes Hilde's psychology as coerced, shaped by the patriarchal fascist belief system of the time. Hoffmeister, Donna L. February Shadows. \\"Commentary\\" Ariadne Press, Riverside (1989) p. 151 She was made to feel inferior and submissive, but also encouraged to never exclude herself from a group. This personal type of fascism aided in the rally of Austrian youth to support the Nazi cause during the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd. Many years after the period of National Socialism, it was still difficult for Hilde to extricate herself from this pattern of thinking. As an adult, she still felt extreme anxiety about being excluded from groups and events.DeMeritt, Linda. \\" The Art of Confronting Taboos. \\" Department of Modern and Classical Languages of Allegheny College (2000) =Dysfunctional family life= Family, or lack thereof, remains important throughout both Hilde's childhood and adulthood. Hilde's childhood is laden with abuse and patriarchal superiority. This is represented by her father's harmful actions and her mother's unwillingness to ask her brothers to do housework.Reichart, p. 66 In the ideal fascist society the family unit mimicked the hierarchical structure of the state.DeMerritt In Hilde's case, the state was stronger and more stable than her own family unit. This is evident at the climax of the novel, when she is having an inner struggle about choosing to do what was right by Germany's standards or by Hannes' standards. In the end she chose Germany's — her family life was too weak and dysfunctional to stand up to the beliefs instilled by the state and the only morals she was aware of were state-taught.Hoffmeister, p. 149 Though her married life was much better than her childhood, there was still an aspect of inhibition in Hilde's ability to function as a normal family member. Hilde resented the constant feeling of being excluded, thinking her husband and daughter were purposefully leaving her out of conversations because she was less educated than they were.Reichart, p. 28 =The mother-daughter relationship= Throughout the story, the mother-daughter relationship between Hilde and Erika is complex. The first point of tension between the women is the generation difference. Erika comes from an educated generation that is encouraged to ask questions and find truth, while Hilde was taught to never question authority or rules. Erika is taught to be active and bold; Hilde was taught to be passive and demure. There is much misunderstanding from the differences in their ages and histories. Also, Hilde is extremely envious of Erika's education and opportunities, causing a rift between mother and daughter. Hilde dislikes the fact that Erika has used her education to become a mere writer.Michaels, pp. 16-17 Erika is very demanding towards Hilde in wanting answers; Hilde is her daughter's only tie to personal history. Erika can not discover her heritage without the aid of her mother, yet her mother wants to forget her painful past and move on to a better future. Erika seems fascinated with the past and the liberation of the female voice while Hilde is engrossed with silencing herself and moving forward.Hoffmeister, p. 153 =Use of the word \\"shadows\\"= The persistent use of the word \\"shadow\\" stems from the original text. In German, the word refers to a specific type of shadow only cast in February due to the position of the earth and sun at that time of the year. The shadows of February are more defined, as was the evil of the villagers on 2 February 1945. Hilde often uses shadows in reference to shameful or painful events, people, and memories. Shadows seem to be fitting to the nature of the novel since Hilde is always attempting to escape the shadowy pain of her past.Hoffmeister, p. 160 Using the idea of shadows, a major theme that received considerable notice by the academic public was the literal liberation of the young female voice during the Hasenjagd and, consequently, during the war. Reichart allowed the reader to see into the mind of a tormented, silenced girl, thus freeing her voice. Through Reichart's book, the Austrian readers could feel they were making a positive and progressive movement in history by becoming aware of the tragedy of the war, and accepting their place and major faults in it.Hoffmeister pp. 147-162 Style =Literary techniques= Reichart uses sentence structure similar to that of Franz Kafka. Both authors utilize fragmented and run-on sentences to create emotions in their works. February Shadows contains several non- traditional literary devices that became popular in Austrian literature in the 1980s in novels that dealt with subject matter relating to World War II, and especially Austria's participation in the war. Reichart utilizes these unconventional devices to illustrate Hilde's denial of pain and her struggle to remain emotionally stable. The use of fragmented sentences allows the reader to understand Hilde's inability and refusal to connect one idea to another as she attempts to repress memories. The truncated thoughts represented by the short and incomplete sentences display her own prohibition to remember the past coherently. Even Reichart's incorrect punctuation enhances the emotions of the story. Reichart often places periods in the middle of sentences, creating sharp and abrupt stops to ideas, as if Hilde is trying to smother her own thoughts. Reichart also ends interrogatives without question marks as if Hilde is hopelessly inquiring and does not expect to receive an answer.Hoffmeister, p. 156 The plot follows a non-sequential structure; it switches from past memories to present experiences, and often entangles the two. This meshing of memory with sensation creates confusion between past and present, in which no details are concrete. Words and phrases are repeated throughout the book, highlighting themes and recurring ideas. This redundancy generates a sense of obsession throughout the narrative, Erika's obsession to learn the truth, and Hilde's obsession to forget it. Coupled with repetition, Reichart's use of recurring words—such as alone, exclusion, and guilt—emphasize their importance to the main points and the extreme feelings Hilde feels about them.Hoffmeister, p. 156 Throughout the novel Hilde will often not refer to herself in the first person, but insists on using the third person, or she speaks without using a noun or pronoun. This relates to her self-loathing and her unwillingness to see herself honestly for fear of who she really is. Similar to the disuse of the pronoun \\"I\\", Hilde also does not allow herself to use the word \\"my\\" in reference to her parents, husband, and daughter. She inserts an impersonal \\"the\\" in its place. For example, she does not say \\"my\\" mother, but \\"the\\" mother. In the original Austrian text the use of the impersonal article was meant to show estrangement between Hilde and her family, and Reichart asked that the English translation retain the article even though it did not translate directly.Hoffmeister, p. 148 The overall effect of Reichart's literary techniques indicate Hilde's estrangement of painful memories, her obsession with guilt and self-loathing, her inability to resolve anxiety, and the inadequacy of words to capture her feelings. With these devices, Reichart allows the reader to see inside the mind of an extremely disturbed woman. For Reichart, Hilde and her siblings embody the war-time generation: Walter, who helped to hack to death the prisoners in the barn; Monika, who was too delicate and fragile to act; Hannes, who refused to kill the prisoner and tried to save him; and Hilde, who was confused and did not know to whom she could go for help. The father, a violent and bitter man, made his family suffer and was indeed complicit in their suffering; the mother, worked hard but said nothing; the distant sister, Christine, was removed from the chaos. The home was no sanctuary, not for the escaped prisoner, nor for Hilde; Pesendorf betrayed the brother—indeed, the family—and killed the prisoner. The home was as dangerous and bloody as the barn.DeMeritt =Elements of the psychological novel= Odon von Horvath became famous for bringing to light societal atrocities in the early 1900s. February Shadows can also be categorized as a novel aimed to create societal guilt. Three major elements of the writing style indicate that the book can be classified as a psychological novel. The first is the emphasis of the mind and inner thoughts rather than the plot line and movement of the story. The feelings behind all actions chosen are far more important than the actions themselves; the actions are mere secondary behaviors in response to the psychological decisions of the character. Another element is the stream of consciousness, or inner monologue style of writing. The majority of the storyline takes place in the mind of the lead character rather than externally through actions and interactions with other characters. In addition to inner monologues, memories of dialogues or even imagined dialogues with other important characters aid in plot movement. The final element is the use of a non-chronological timeline and excessive flashbacks. The effect allows the reader to follow the character thought by thought through memories, feelings, and contemplations, thus creating the illusion that the reader is inside the character's mind, rather than a third party observer, as in classical novels. \\"Psychological Novel\\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online (2010) =Similar authors= Reichart utilizes techniques in her novel that are similar to other Austrian authors from both the early 20th century and the early 1980s.Hoffmeister p. 156 Similar to Franz Kafka, Reichart employs alternating run-on and fragmented sentences to display the emotions of her character, and also creates a poignant plot by using ambiguous words which could potentially possess multiple meanings in the text.Hornek, Daniel. \\"Franz Kafka Biography\\" Franz Kafka website (1999) Like Ödön von Horváth, Reichart has the ability to uproot and publicly display difficult events through dramatized means. In the novels authored by Peter Handke, the use of extreme psychological activity drives the plot, which is also congruent with Reichart's novel.\\"Peter Handke\\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online (2010) Her use of key themes and phrases which represent innate emotional processes can also be seen in the writings of one of her famous contemporaries, Thomas Bernhard.\\"Thomas Bernhard\\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online (2010) Publication history Christa Wolf wrote an afterword for the 1985 reissued edition Februarschatten was originally written in the German language and was first printed by Verlag der Österreichischen Staatsdrückerei in Vienna in 1984. It was reissued by Aufbau Verlag in Berlin by 1985, when the afterword by Christa Wolf was added. The English version, February Shadows, translated by Donna L. Hoffmeister, was published in 1989, with a translator's commentary at the end of the book to aid English speakers' understanding of certain language and context. Ariadne Press in Riverside, California, published the English version and Georg Eisler designed the cover art.Reichart, pg 1-162 =About the afterword= The afterword of the novel was written by Christa Wolf, a famous German literary critic and writer known for such works as Der geteilte Himmel (Divided Heaven, 1963), Kindheitsmuster (Patterns of Childhood, 1976), and Was bleibt (What Remains, 1990).\\"Christa Wolf\\" FemBio Wolf gives a brief background of Reichart's discovery of the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd and her own interpretation of the story. She praises two main themes, the struggle of silence, and the liberation of the female voice through psychological writing. Wolf also notifies the reader of consistent symbolism throughout the book and its application to reality.Wolf, pp. 143-145 Reception The novel was received well by young Austrians in the 1980s. To them, the book represented a story of truth that was long hidden. At a time when Austria was starting to take on responsibility for its nonaction during World War II, February Shadows threw light on problems of the past. Reichart displayed to her own nation that ignoring and forgetting events such as the Mühlviertler Hasenjagd was unacceptable and not to be tolerated. Some older Austrians, who had lived through the war, considered February Shadows controversial and inappropriate. Much like the character Hilde, they felt the past should stay in the past, that there was a reason for Austrian silence about the events of World War II: to protect lives.Demeritt and Michaels pp. 11 Sources = Citations and notes = =Bibliography= *\\"Christa Wolf.\\" FemBio.

Background  Wang Jingchong was born in 847, during the reign of Emperor Xuānzong. At that time, his grandfather Wang Yuankui ruled Chengde Circuit in de facto independence from the imperial government, but maintained a good relationship with the imperial government and largely followed imperial orders; he also married a Tang imperial princess (Princess Shou'an, a granddaughter of Emperor Xuānzong's father Emperor Xianzong. Wang Jingchong's father Wang Shaoding was the oldest son of Wang Yuankui's, by Princess Shou'an, and served as Wang Yuankui's deputy. Wang Jingchong himself, while not the oldest among his brothers (he had at least one older brother, Wang Jingyin (), and at least one younger brother, Wang Jingyu (), was the oldest (or only) son of Wang Shaoding's wife, and therefore viewed as the eventual heir of Wang Shaoding.Old Book of Tang, vol. 142. Wang Yuankui died in 855, and Wang Shaoding succeeded him, with imperial sanction. Wang Shaoding, however, was said to mistreat his people and waste his time on feasts, leading to the soldiers plotting rebellion. Before any plot came to fruition, however, Wang Shaoding died of illness, and the soldiers supported his younger brother (and Wang Jingchong's uncle) Wang Shaoyi as his successor. Emperor Xuānzong approved the succession.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 249. During Wang Shaoyi's military governorship, Wang Jingchong served as the acting commandant of Chengde's capital Zhen Prefecture (), as well as the commander of the army. In 866, Wang Shaoyi grew ill. He summoned Wang Jingchong and stated to Wang Jingchong: Wang Shaoyi died after speaking. Emperor Xuānzong's son and successor Emperor Yizong subsequently approved the succession and made Wang Jingchong first acting military governor, and then military governor later in 866.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 250.  As military governor  = During Emperor Yizong's reign = It was said that the imperial government had a good relationship with Wang Jingchong since he was the grandson of a princess. During the rebellion of Pang Xun at Xu Prefecture (徐州, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), Wang contributed troops to the imperial cause, and after Pang's rebellion was put down, Wang was created the Baron of Taiyuan. It was said that when Princess Shou'an died, Wang observed a mourning period appropriately, and was praised by the imperial officials. After he was subsequently formally recalled to active service, he was given the honorific title of acting Sikong (司空, one of the Three Excellencies). In 870, when He Quanhao the military governor of neighboring Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) was killed in a mutiny, the Weibo soldiers supported the officer Han Junxiong to succeed He Quanhao. It was said that because Wang also submitted a petition on Han's behalf that Emperor Yizong approved of Han's takeover. Later in the year, Emperor Yizong bestowed the honorific chancellor designation of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi () on him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 252. = During Emperor Xizong's reign = In 873, Emperor Yizong died and was succeeded by his son Emperor Xizong. Emperor Xizong bestowed a number of honorific titles on military governors, and Wang received the greater honorific chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling (). In 875, Wang's honorific chancellor title was changed to Shizhong (). During this period, he was also successively created the Duke of Zhao and then the Prince of Changshan. Also during this time, his mother Lady of Qin died, but he was then formally recalled to active service. In 880, the agrarian rebel Huang Chao captured the imperial capital Chang'an, forced Emperor Yizong to flee, and established his own state of Qi as its emperor. Wang's neighbor, Wang Chucun the military governor of Yiwu Circuit (義武, headquartered in modern Baoding, Hebei), upon hearing the news of Chang'an's fall, mobilized all of Yiwu's troops and headed for Chang'an, subsequently participating in a major campaign against Huang's Qi state on Tang's behalf.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Wang Jingchong sent troops to accompany Wang Chucun on his campaign, although, unlike Wang Chucun, he did not personally attend to the campaign. However, he often sent messengers to Emperor Xizong, who had fled to Xichuan Circuit (西川, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) by this point, to greet the emperor and to submit tributes. After Huang's Qi state was destroyed, Wang Jingchong was thus given the honorific title of Taiwei (太尉, also one of the Three Excellencies, but now no longer acting). Wang Jingchong died in 883. The soldiers supported his nine-year-old son Wang Rong as his successor, and the imperial government, then in disarray, subsequently approved.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255.

It comprises the same area as the administrative Mästerby District, established on 1January 2016. When King Valdemar IV of Denmark and his troops invaded Gotland in 1361, they met the first line of resistance at the Battle of Mästerby.  Geography  Mästerby is the name of the socken as well as the district. It is also the name of the small village surrounding the medieval Mästerby Church, sometimes referred to as Mästerby kyrkby. It is situated on central Gotland. Mästerby consists of a number of farms spread over a larger area. Mästerby parish was independent until 2012. , Mästerby Church belongs to Sanda-Västergarn-Mästerby parish in Klinte pastorat, along with the churches in Sanda and Västergarn. One of the asteroids in the Asteroid belt, 10813 Mästerby, is named after the settlement.  History  Mästerby has been a settlement since prehistoric times. A great number of archeological finds have been made here along with grave fields, stone mounds and traces of houses dating from the Iron, Bronze and Viking Ages as well as from Medieval times. The finds also include a number of metal objects, jewelry and coins with the oldest coin a Roman dinar dated 160–180. The name Mästerby originates from the Old Gutnish word maister meaning \\"master\\" or \\"foremost\\". In 1270, the name was written as \\"Mestraby\\", \\"Meystbye\\" in the 14th century and \\"Mesteby\\" in 1523. The courthouse for southern Gotland was situated at Mästerby, along with a gallows and a place for corporal punishment from 1000 until the end of the 16th century. The last execution was the hanging of Anders Botelson from Gothem in 1698, for stealing from a church.  Battle of Mästerby  When Danish troops invaded Gotland in 1361, they met the first line of resistance at Fjäle mire. This resulted in the Battle of Mästerby on the 25–26 July 1361. Through battlefield archaeology and some written accounts, archeologists have pieced together a likely course of events. = The Battle = In an effort to stop the Danish soldiers from advancing, the bridge at Ajmunds was destroyed. The Danes tried to cross the stream, but this proved to be a tactical error since the banks were very steep, making it hard for the heavily armed soldiers to advance. They therefore retreated and sent out scouts to search for a better crossing, while the main body of troops rested for the night. Finally the Danes found a crossing a kilometre to the northeast at Fjäle mire, where they crossed. The Gotlandic farmers who were trying to stop the invaders had hoped that the Danish soldiers with their heavy armour and equipment would have a hard time moving about in the mire, but the summer had been hot and the mire was almost dry. The failure of the plan resulted in a massacre, about 1,500 Gotlandic farmers and other local inhabitants being killed by the Danish invaders. = Memorial = A couple of decades after the battle a memorial for the fallen Gotlanders was built at Grens farm. The memorial is in the shape of a celtic cross, on Gotland known as a \\"Branch cross\\" or a \\"Ring cross\\". Fragments of an inscription can be found on the cross. The legible text is Anno Domini MCCCLXI (Roman numerals for \\"1361\\") and finally the word Iacobi (Latin for Saint Jacob and his day in the calendar). From this it was deduced that the battle took place on the day of Jacobi, 25July 1361. At the Ajmunds bridge stands another memorial honoring the Gotlanders who died defending their freedom. The stone was raised in 1961, 600 years after the battle. = Legend = A priest in Mästerby parish, Hans Nielssön Strelow, wrote the Cronica Guthilandorium (\\"Chronicle of Gotland\\") in 1633. This is the only remaining written account mentioning the battle but written 300 years after the event. The chronicle was the only document remaining after a fire at the Mästerby vicarage in 1735. The legend written in the Chronicle states that King Valdemar Atterdag's forces landed at the Kronvall fishing village on the main island opposite Lilla Karlsö and Stora Karlsö. They were opposed by Gotlandic farmers at Fjäle mire. The fighting went on for two days between 25–26July 1361, outside Mästerby. King Valdemar erected a cross to honour the brave farmers and moved on to Visby. Historians realized that it was unlikely that King Valdemar would have honoured his fallen enemies. But the battlefield team from the Swedish National Heritage Board, archeologist Maria Lingström and the Mästerby History Society decided to investigate if there was any truth to the legend. = Battlefield archaeology = Investigation of the site, led by Lindström, has been conducted every year since 2006. Up until 2011, hundreds of finds related to the battle have been made. The distribution and nature of the finds indicate that the main battle occurred in a sandy part of the mire where Danish troops had been able to cross and advance on Mästerby. The finds from the investigations are on display at a small museum in Mästerby, run by the Mästerby Historical Society, and at the Gotland museum in Visby. The battle has been reenacted by participants from historical societies from a number of countries, in connection with the reenactment of the Battle of Visby.

Moore was born in El Paso, Texas, and was a 1946 graduate of Austin High School in El Paso. He began drawing cartoons while serving in the United States Navy during the Korean War. He attended the University of Texas at El Paso, the American Academy of Art in Chicago, and the Cartoonists and Illustrators School (renamed the School of Visual Arts in 1956) in New York, the latter funded by the G.I. Bill. Some of his instructors during that time were Tom Gill and Tarzan comic strip illustrator Burne Hogarth. Moore was the Staff Cartoonist in the Texas Navy at Corpus Christi. After his discharge, he married his wife, Ruth, and they lived on Long Island for eight years. During this time he freelanced for Archie Comics, primarily working on Archie's Joke Book, and collaborated with other Archie creators such as George Gladir, Orlando Busino, Sy Reit, and Frank Doyle. In 1961, Moore moved his family back to El Paso. There he created the Chick Call strip feature which appeared worldwide in American Armed Forces publications. He did other local freelance work and assisted Fred Lasswell on the Snuffy Smith comic strip, until 1964 when he took a full-time job as Director of PR and Advertising for Mutual Savings & Loan, run by his father. He resumed freelance cartooning in 1970, but it wasn't until the late 1980s that he returned to Archie Comics, initially as the inker for the launch of the second volume of the Jughead title. During his time at Archie, Moore also did freelance inking for Spotlight Comics on their Underdog and Mighty Mouse titles. After he retired in 1988, he taught at El Paso Community College for a number of years. Moore died in El Paso on July 20, 2015 from throat cancer at the age of 86.

The event is mainly for classic vehicles of the post war era up to cars and bikes of the 1970s. Many of the vehicles racing there are well known by the spectators from the times of their youth. The public is allowed free access to the paddock, which enables direct contact with the competitors. To enable the presenting of the respective vehicles in the correct setting, the paddock is divided in sections according to the race series and clubs taking part. The automobiles compete mainly under the regulations of the international FIA sporting code which means real racing. The motorbikes and sidecars however run in regularity trials according to the national rules of the German Motor Sports Association, the DMSB. Regularity trials are not about the fastest race times and therefore help preserve the historic material. = Last combined event for cars and motorbikes in Germany = Up to the 1970s combined meetings with cars and motorbikes were common in Germany. As a result of the increasing discussions about safety and tightening of safety regulations it became more and more difficult and expensive for organisers to arrange combined events. The Oldtimer Festival is the last big event of its kind with permission of the DMSB.

In 1984 the \\"Oldtimer Festival\\" was part of the opening meetings for the new Grand-Prix-Circuit of the Nürburgring. The event was extended to a three day event. In 1990 the DAMC 05 together with the ADMV organised during the Oldtimer Festival the one and only heat of the German Democratic Republic's championships for formula easter cars and for Trabants in the FRG. In 1995 for the first time the Historic Formula One Championship visited the Oldtimer Festival. 1995 poster. In 2008 the Oldtimer Festival took place during the summer month for the last time.

As a part of the Oldtimer Festival in 2010 the tradition and name of the renowned ADAC 1000 km of Nürburgring will be continued.

The project was borne from both a wealth of material and indecision over what musical direction to take. Spencer decided to present his songs in the familiar format of a television series/DVD box set with albums titled Episode(s) 1–6, which he believed would surmount the problem of many disparate ideas. Episode 1 The first album grouped Spencer's simpler songs that took influence from a basic rock palette using only drums, bass and guitar and elementary arrangements. In late 2005, Spencer formed a 3-piece rock band composed of drummer Avvon Chambers (who he had met in a previous band The Room Orchestra) and Stephen Black (aka Sweet Baboo), who he had met through the band JT MOuse. They self-released a single, \\"Leader of the Chain Gang\\", in May 2006, which led to the group playing the BBC's inaugural Electric Proms later that year and collaborating with the BBC's concert orchestral on new music (which would be used as rough recordings for Episode 2). In 2007 the band appeared on the compilation \\"This Town Ain't Big Enough For The 22 Of Us\\" (Twisted by Design), which also featured Los Campesinos! and Sweet Baboo. Earlier that year Spencer, Black and friends formed the label Businessman Records, with the initial limited edition release of the vinyl-only \\"A Title Sparks Would Have Used\\" single in September. The band spent the next year touring and recording, producing a free download-only single \\"A Paler Shade of Wit\\" the following September, compared favourably by The Guardian to \\"…Television covering 'Like a Virgin'\\". The self-produced debut album Episode 1 was released through Businessman Records at the end of 2008, with a national release in early 2009 along with the single \\"The Heat Was Hot\\". The song \\"The Unfilmable Life and Life of Terry Gilliam\\" from the album can be heard several times in the motion picture Colin. Episode 2 Spencer began recording Episode 2 in January 2009 with producer Charlie Francis (High Llamas, R.E.M.). The album was said to be a mix of musicals, baroque pop and minimalist composition and features a 14-piece band of multi instrumentalists including additional singers Becky Wood and Sophie Cochrane and cellist Beth Gibson (who also played as the group Barefoot Dance of the Sea), along with violinist Katy Rowe (who also performs as part of the Mavron Quartet), Dan McGinn (trumpet), Tina Hitchens (flute) – who is a co-founder of modern classical ensemble Cardiff New Music Collective – Avvon Chambers (drums) and Stephen Black (bass). The album was released in early 2010. Episode 2 has been received favourably by music journalists and critics. They have been featured as The Guardian's Band of the Day, and were cited as BBC Introducing's Tip of the Week. Spencer contributed vocals to the Hot Puppies song \\"Dear Brutus\\" on the album Blue Hands and played drums on the Sweet Baboo album Hello Wave. Episode 3 and beyond Episode 3 – A Quick Win was released in July 2012, again a collaboration with Stephen Black and Avvon Chambers, though no other musicians were involved this time around. The album was more pop oriented and synth-based than the previous two. In 2014, the album Shorthand was released, credited to Spencer Segelov. It was a commissioned work from the Chapter Arts Centre in Cardiff. Spencer is now lead singer of the band Instructions. He also serves as a musician in other bands, including Nathan Hall and the Sinister Locals.

History In the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Jesuit colleges spread across Europe, and almost all of these presented at least one play each year. The first recorded performance was in 1551, at the College Mamertino at Messina, in Sicily, but by the mid-17th centuries, several hundred plays were being performed annually. The 'Ratio studiorum' of 1599 made it mandatory for Jesuit schools to exercise their students in rhetorical self-expression through dramas, debates, and other declamation of poetry. As Jesuit drama expanded, it also evolved, becoming more elaborate. The earliest plays were performed in Latin, without any female characters or costumes. Later, performances were frequently given in the vernacular, and they became important social events in the towns where the colleges were established. By public requests the dramatic representations had often to be staged a second or third time. As Jesuit drama became more extravagant, so these productions were increasingly criticised. These criticisms focused on the cost of the plays and their exaggerated place in the curriculum of certain Jesuit colleges. These criticisms added to the already growing anti-Jesuit sentiment in the 18th century, which resulted in the banning of Jesuit drama in many areas. Performances ceased in 1773, with the suppression of the Society of Jesus, but were revived, after the restoration of the Society in 1814. Content Jesuit dramas, as well as instructing students in correct language use and oratory skills, served as a means of instruction in Roman Catholic doctrine and values, for both the students and the audience. The plays were therefore based on accounts from the Bible, or saintly legends. Most pieces of Jesuit drama contained music of some form. These musical elements were particularly elaborate in Austria and southern Germany, as well as in France where ballet was often included in Jesuit productions.

The system is designed out of a shotgun formation with four wide receivers and one running back. The formations are a variation of the run and shoot offense with two outside receivers and two inside slot receivers. The offense also uses trips formations featuring three wide receivers on one side of the field and a lone single receiver on the other side.  History  The offense owes much to the influence of BYU head coach LaVell Edwards who used the splits and several key passing concepts during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s while coaching players such as Jim McMahon, Steve Young, Robbie Bosco, and Ty Detmer. Mike Leach has made reference that he and Hal Mumme largely incorporated much of the BYU passing attack into what is now known as the air raid offense. Some of the concepts such as the shallow cross route were incorporated into such offenses as the West Coast offense during the early 1990s as well, prominently under Mike Shanahan while he was the head coach of the Denver Broncos. The offense first made its appearance when Mumme and Leach took over at Iowa Wesleyan College and Valdosta State University and had success there during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The first exposure into NCAA Division I-A (now FBS) was at the University of Kentucky starting in 1997. There, Mumme and Leach helped turn highly touted QB Tim Couch into a star and later a first overall NFL draft pick. Leach then served as offensive coordinator at the University of Oklahoma in 1999 before landing the head coaching job at Texas Tech. Shortly into the early 2000s, assistant coaches started landing head coaching jobs such as Chris Hatcher at Valdosta State, Art Briles (first at Houston then Baylor), Sonny Dykes (first at Louisiana Tech, then at California), Ruffin McNeill at East Carolina, Dana Holgorsen at West Virginia, and Kevin Sumlin (first at Houston, then Texas A&M;). Arizona Cardinals head coach Kliff Kingsbury (Mike Leach's first quarterback at Texas Tech) runs the offense as well.  Air Raid System  The Scheme is notable for its focus on passing. As many as 65–75% of the calls during a season result in a passing play. The QB has the freedom to audible to any play based on what the defense is showing him at the line of scrimmage. In at least one instance, as a result of the QB's ability to audible, as many as 90% of the run plays called in a season were chosen by audible at the line of scrimmage. An important element in this offense is the inclusion of the no huddle. The QB and the offense race up to the line of scrimmage, diagnose what the defense is showing, and then snap the ball based on the QB's play call. This not only allows a team to come back if they are many points down as seen in the 2006 Insight Bowl but it also allows them to tire out the defense, allowing for bigger runs and longer pass completions. The fast pace limits the defense's ability to substitute players and adjust their scheme. The hurried pace can cause defensive mental mistakes such as missed assignments, being out of position or too many men on the field. Another important aspect of the Air Raid offense is the split of the offensive linemen. In a conventional offense, the linemen are bunched together fairly tightly but in an Air Raid offense, linemen are often split apart about a half to a full yard from another. While in theory this allows easier blitz lanes, it forces the defensive ends and defensive tackles to run further to reach the quarterback for a sack. The quick, short passes offset any Blitz that may come. Another advantage is that by forcing the defensive line to widen, it opens up wide passing lanes for the QB to throw the ball through with less chance of having his pass knocked down or intercepted. Fundamental air raid play concepts include Mesh, Stick and Corner, All Curls, 4 Verts, and Fast Screens. These plays are designed to get the ball out of the QB's hand quickly, stretch the defense horizontally and vertically, and allow the QB to key on one defensive player who will forced to make a decision on which receiver to cover in his assigned area. While air raid plays are commonly designed to beat zone coverages, they also work well against man-to-man schemes since air raid offenses often employ receivers with more than average speed, thus giving them an advantage in man-to-man coverage. The mesh concept is the bread and butter of the air raid offense and stretches the defense vertically with an outside receiver running a deep route, typically a post route, the running back sliding out into the flat after checking for blocking assignments, and the two remaining receivers running shallow crossing routes that setup a natural pick, or coverage rub.

Cognitive planning is one of the executive functions. It encompasses the neurological processes involved in the formulation, evaluation and selection of a sequence of thoughts and actions to achieve a desired goal. Various studies utilizing a combination of neuropsychological, neuropharmacological and functional neuroimaging approaches have suggested there is a positive relationship between impaired planning ability and damage to the frontal lobe. A specific area within the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex located in the frontal lobe has been implicated as playing an intrinsic role in both cognitive planning and associated executive traits such as working memory. Disruption of the neural pathways, via various mechanisms such as traumatic brain injury, or the effects of neurodegenerative diseases between this area of the frontal cortex and the basal ganglia specifically the striatum (cortico-striatal pathway), may disrupt the processes required for normal planning function. Individuals who were born with very low birth weight (VLBW - <1500 grams) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) are at greater risk of various cognitive deficits including planning ability. \\\\- Neuropsychological tests Animation of a four disc version of the alt=A version of the Tower of Hanoi utilizing four discs. There are a variety of neuropsychological tests which can be used to measure variance of planning ability between the subject and controls. *Tower of Hanoi (TOH-R), a puzzle invented in 1883 by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas. There are variations of the puzzle - the classic version consists of three rods and usually seven to nine discs of subsequently smaller size. Planning is a key component of the problem solving skills necessary to achieve the objective, which is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following rules: **Only one disk may be moved at a time. **Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the rods and sliding it onto another rod, on top of the other disks that may already be present on that rod. **No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. \\\\- PEBL psychology software running the Tower of London test *Tower of London (TOL) is another test that was developed in 1982 (Shallice 1982) specifically to detect deficits in planning as may occur with damage to the frontal lobe. test participants with damage to the left anterior frontal lobe demonstrated planning deficits (i.e., greater number of moves required for solution). In test, participants with damage to the right anterior, and left or right posterior areas of the frontal lobes showed no impairment. The results implicating the left anterior frontal lobes involvement in solving the TOL were supported in concomitant neuroimaging studies which also showed a reduction in regional cerebral blood flow to the left pre-frontal lobe. For the number of moves, a significant negative correlation was observed for the left prefrontal area, i.e. subjects that took more time planning their moves showed greater activation in the left prefrontal area.

He and Emil Preetorius were the Nestors of the German American press in the United States. In the Revolutions of 1848 in Germany, Daenzer had made himself obnoxious to the German government with efforts to bring about German unity by force of arms. For his rebellious course, he was condemned to ten years imprisonment with a heavy fine. He escaped to Switzerland, and thence to the United States. In 1851, he drifted into St. Louis as a general writer, and was hired by Henry Boernstein as editor for the ' of which Boernstein had recently become proprietor. Daenzer edited the paper until 1857 when, due to differences of various kinds which had arisen with Boernstein, he resigned.

Wenzel sold his part in 1859, and Daenzer left the paper in 1860 due to health reasons. In 1870 [Franco-Prussian War] he collected more than one million Dollars for wounded German soldiers. In 1885 President Cleveland asked him as US-ambassador to Bern (Suisse). But he refused.

History  The Majestic Cinema was built in 1928 and run by Ernest Ralph Adams of Ripley House, King's Lynn. He worked closely with the architects John Lewis Carnell and William Dymoke White in the design and construction of the Majestic. Mr. Adams bought the contents of the Empire Theatre, Leicester Square, London (which was being demolished) and these, once restored, formed part of the interior of the Majestic. The 'Picture House' (as it was initially known) opened on May 23rd, 1928 with the silent film version of 'Ben Hur', starring Ramon Navarro. The ownership of the cinema later passed to Union and subsequently ABC Cinemas. The original ballroom was used as a venue by King George V for his Sandringham Hunt Balls. = 2001: Multiplex demolition proposal = In , a scheme to demolish the Majestic Cinema and build a Multiplex in its place was denied. The plans were submitted to the Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk by SMM Investments.

When the revived Society returned to Canada in 1842, they began to campaign for the repossession of their allegedly confiscated estates. The premier of Quebec, Honoré Mercier, proposed the Jesuit Estates Act, which offered the Roman Catholic Church a financial settlement in return for incorporating the estates into Quebec's Crown lands.S.Q. 1888, c. 13, s. 6 This measure provoked much controversy among Orangemen and Protestants, but it was not overturned. History =Settlement in Quebec= Following the Suppression of the Jesuits by Pope Clement XIV in 1773, their lands in the Province of Quebec were seized by the British Crown in 1791, at par. 44(12) but possession was not taken until 1800, after all of their priests had either died or left Canada. The lands were subsequently transferred to the Province of Lower Canada in 1831, and the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada passed legislation in 1832 providing for all income arising from the estates to be segregated from other Crown property and dedicated for educational purposes. After the Order was restored by Pope Pius VII in 1814 by virtue of the papal bull Sollicitudo omnium ecclesiarum, it was re-established in Canada in the 1840s, and in the following years it campaigned for compensation in order to establish a new Catholic university in Montreal. The province's archbishop, Elzéar-Alexandre Taschereau, instead proposed that the estates be sold off and the money divided among existing Catholic schools. Pope Leo XIII Through the mediation of Pope Leo XIII, a compromise was reached, and resulting Act in 1888 authorized a settlement which consisted of: :* a payment of $400,000 to be divided on the direction of the PopeS.Q. 1888, c. 13, s. 2 (which went to the Jesuits, Laval University, and several Roman Catholic dioceses) :* the vesting of Laprairie Common in the Society,S.Q. 1888, c. 13, s. 3 and :* a payment of $60,000 to the Protestant Committee of the Council of Public Instruction for appropriate investment by it.S.Q. 1888, c. 13, s. 4 =Move for federal disallowance= In the House of Commons of Canada in February 1889, John Augustus Barron asked Minister of Justice John Thompson if the federal government would disallow the Quebec act. After Thompson replied that there was no intention, William Edward O'Brien proposed a resolution the following month requesting such action. In the subsequent debate, tensions were escalated when Dalton McCarthy declared: The Conservative government of John A. Macdonald, together with the Liberal Party under Wilfrid Laurier, united to defeat the motion. The latter exclaimed, \\"Sir, this is not a party question; it is at most a family quarrel; it is simply a domestic disturbance in the ranks of the Conservative party.\\" John A. Macdonald In closing the debate, Macdonald declared: By 188 to 13, the motion was defeated. Impact and aftermath Dalton McCarthy The thirteen MPs that supported the resolution came to be known as either the \\"Noble Thirteen\\" or the \\"Devil's Dozen\\", and McCarthy resigned from the Conservative Party. Their subsequent efforts led to the creation of the Equal Rights Association and the McCarthyites, as well as the rise of French-language schooling conflicts in Manitoba and Ontario. In order to reduce political tensions, in 1890 the Parliament of Canada passed an Act for the incorporation of the Orange Order in Canada. This recognized the political influence that the Orangeman had attained, which greatly affected the outcome of the 1891 federal election. The campaign for the Act's disallowance was one of many religious disputes that arose in 19th-Century and early 20th-Century Canada, which included the dissolution of the clergy reserves in Upper Canada, the Guibord case in the 1870s, the Manitoba Schools Question in the 1890s, and Ontario's Regulation 17 in 1912.

Typically, purchasers of cars at BHPH dealerships have poor credit history, and loans have high interest rates. BHPH can provide options for those unable to meet credit standards elsewhere. History and background The BHPH Industry originated primarily in the early 1970s during the United States savings and loan crisis. With many similarities to the financial crisis of 2007-2010 credit was difficult to obtain, unemployment was rising & the economy was still in a transformation from a production-based economy to a service-based economy. Automobile dealers who still wanted to sell cars had to find a way to deal with the increasing price of vehicles relative to income. They had to sell these vehicles to wary consumers who were unwilling or unable to pay cash for the new purchase at the point of purchase. In many cases, when banks would not lend to the consumer, the automobile dealer would start a related finance company (RFC) and have the finance company approve the loan on the vehicle. This represented a step into the consumer finance business for automobile dealers. The advantage to the dealership of having an RFC finance was decreased risk on the sale and finance of the vehicles sold. Since both the RFC and the dealership had the same ownership, the owners could benefit from the profit on the sale of the vehicle and the profit on the loan for the vehicle. Historically, the down payment required on a BHPH loan was generally larger than the total profit on the sale of the vehicle. Therefore, if the buyer didn’t make payments, the RFC could repossess the vehicle and sell it again at the dealership. Since 2008, many outside lending institutions have entered the market and the average down payment on a BHPH loan has significantly decreased, as dealers try to maintain a share of the market.http://www.sgcaccounting.com/Resources/BHPHBenchmarks2013.pdf Many of the benefits of separating the RFC out from the BHPH dealership are based in the tax code changes of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. The Act restricted any companies that utilize inventory in their operating business from using cash accounting. Issues Due to the high upfront cost of securing inventory, automobile dealerships frequently have a problem managing their cash flow. Often, used car dealerships purchase inventory using a retail floorplan, a type of specialty line of credit, that typically requires the automobile to be paid off in full within 90 days of purchase. This means that automobile dealers use loans to finance their operations and therefore have an interest in selling vehicles as quickly as possible in order to use the proceeds to pay off the loan rather than paying off the loan out of their working capital. One difficulty that this presents to BHPH dealers is that when they sell a vehicle to a BHPH customer the RFC needs to produce the loan funds so the dealership will have the funds to pay off the line of credit on that automobile. Often a ‘cash crunch’ is a primary reason for dealerships to go out of business. Regulations in the United States Related finance companies are not regulated as strictly as banks by the Federal Reserve, rather they are regulated by the Department of Financial Institutions or Department of Commerce on a State level depending on the State. Regulations may include maximum interest rate, late fee amounts, grace periods and so forth. Some of the companies that have started as RFCs have grown large enough that they became Industrial Banks which are FDIC Insured banks owned by non-financial institutions.

Characteristics and history In the early 1990s, producers Moritz Von Oswald and Mark Ernestus formed Basic Channel, a duo credited for defining dub techno. In addition to making the presence of minimalism commonplace in the techno scene, they also incorporated delay effects that were recurrent in dub music.Baines, Josh (October 15, 2015). \\"A Bullshitter's Guide to Dub Techno\\". THUMP. Vice Media. Retrieved 21 October 2016. They then formed the label Chain Reaction; while still releasing the same type of dub-infused techno that Basic Channel created, such as the track \\"Cyan I\\" by Monolake, the label also distributed techno without dub elements, such as Continuous Mode's \\"Direct Out / Direct Drive\\". Regardless, what Thump writer Josh Baines described as a \\"thawing of ice as a sonic aesthetic\\" that was present in Basic Channel's works before Chain Reaction still remained in all recordings issued under the label. Another label, Rhythm & Sound, was started by Oswald and Ernestus, and focused strictly on dub reggae and dub techno unlike Chain Reaction. The works of Rhythm & Sound featured representations of the sound system culture of Jamaica, the country where dub was formed, as well as authentic elements of the roots of dub. According to Baines, this type of dub techno was \\"the kind of smoked out dub that's an approximate aural recreation of the effect that incredibly potent mairjuana [sic] has on the brain\\" and \\"a haunting, haunted, tripped out site of memorial exploration\\" where \\"Everything sounds half- remembered, half-there, half-real.\\" The \\"clicks and cuts movement\\" in the 1990s formed by Mille Plateaux, is labeled by Baines as also characterizing dub techno's sound; the label's releases focused on making the same type of dub techno that Basic Channel and their imprints recorded and issued, only much more melodic. The exposure of dub techno was then brought over to the United States by Rod Modell with his project Deepchord. Analysis Baines compared dub techno to ambient music, in that music of both genres acts as \\"background music\\" on purpose; it never tries to adventure into new and unique territory, because its only purpose is to be \\"placid, unquestioning\\" and \\"deeply soothing.\\" He analyzed that the best tracks in the dub techno style do what little it does amazingly, in that \\"every element in the mix is given breathing space and, accordingly, takes on a sense of the organic.\\" Dub techno in film * Kvadrat — a documentary film about the realities of DJing, extensively featuring dub techno References Category:Techno genres ","title":"Dub techno"},{"id":"27023571","text":"Moynahan is a family name with Irish origin and may refer to: ;People *Bridget Moynahan, an American model and actress *Brian Moynahan, an English writer *Bernard Thomas Moynahan Jr. (1918–1999), an American federal judge *Mike Moynahan (1856–1899), an American baseball player ;Science *13620 Moynahan, an asteroid *Moynahan syndrome, a skin condition See also *Minihan *Monaghan (disambiguation) *Monahan *Moynihan (surname) ","title":"Moynahan"},{"id":"27023576","text":"Mrinalini may refer to: * 2986 Mrinalini, minor planet * Iti Mrinalini, a 2011 Indian drama film * Mrinalini (novel), a novel by the great Bengali author Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay * Mrinalini Dutta Mahavidyapith, educational institution in Birati, West Bengal, India  People  *Mrinalini Devi (d. 1902), wife of author Rabindranath Tagore * Mrinalini Sarabhai (1918–2016), Indian classical dancer * Mrinalini Sharma, Indian model and actress * Mrinalini Sinha (born 1960), academic * Mrinalini Puranik, Indian scientist * Mrinalini Mukherjee (1949–2015), Indian painter and artist * Mrinalini Tyagi, Indian TV actress See also * Mrunalinni Patil, Indian film director and produce Category:Feminine given names ","title":"Mrinalini"},{"id":"27023579","text":"Mrkos may refer to: * Antonín Mrkos (1918, Střemchoví, Dolní Loučky - 1996), a Czech astronomer ** 143P/Kowal-Mrkos, a periodic comet ** 18D/Perrine-Mrkos, a periodic comet ** 1832 Mrkos (provisional designation 1969 PC), an outer main belt asteroid discovered in 1969 by L.

The resolution began by welcoming the efforts of the President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya and Prime Minister of Burundi Antoine Nduwayo to calm the situation in country. The Council was deeply concerned about aid provided to certain groups that was made by those responsible for the Rwandan genocide, and the violence and incitement to ethnic hatred by radio stations. It was noted that the Commission of Inquiry, established in Resolution 1012 (1995) reported that security given to it by the United Nations was insufficient. All concerned in Burundi had to make efforts to defuse the crisis and engage in dialogue. The Security Council condemned the violence against civilians, refugees and humanitarian aid personnel and the assassinations of government officials in Burundi. All concerned in Burundi had to refrain from violence or incitement to do so and attempts to overthrow the government in an unconstitutional way. Instead, serious negotiations were urged to take place. The Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was asked to report on the possible establishment of a radio station to promote reconciliation and dialogue. International co-operation was requested with regards to humanitarian assistance, and military and judicial reform in Burundi. Burundi was reminded of its responsibility to provide security for the Commission of Inquiry and for all parties to co-operate with it. The Organisation of African Unity was requested to increase the size of its observer mission in the country. Meanwhile, the Secretary-General was asked to accelerate preparations to convene a regional conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region and was further required to report to the Council by 1 May 1996 on the situation in Burundi and progress made in implementing the current resolution.

The only publicly accessible covered bridge in Florida, it has also been honored with a Florida Heritage Site Marker. Structure and design Bridge, circa 1960s It was designed by George Hodapp and constructed in early 1964 by Lewie Mullins, and George Porter, all Coral Ridge Properties employees. The 40-foot bridge has a single steel span that crosses N.W. 95th Avenue just south of Wiles Road. Its roof is composed of 25 truss rafters, cross braces and stringers and is covered with shingles. Originally painted barn red, James S. Hunt, president of Coral Ridge Properties, wanted to convey a sense of the Old South on the otherwise barren landscape. Hunt's vision for Coral Springs was of a totally planned \\"City in the Country\\" with brick colonial-style public buildings, boulevards planted with flowers and the Covered Bridge as its centerpiece. History James S. Hunt contacted the American Snuff Company in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, for chewing tobacco designs to make the bridge appear more \\"seasoned\\". The company supplied two designs plus an artist to paint the murals. The Bull of the Woods logo on the east side of the bridge was first used in 1876. The Peach Snuff logo on the west side was created in 1950 to appeal to a broader female audience. When the eye wall of Hurricane Cleo passed over Coral Springs in August 1964, the bridge was left relatively undamaged. In October 2005, Hurricane Wilma passed over the city, and again the structure sustained little damage. Over the years, the bridge and murals have been restored but are visibly abstruse as trees, (that were planted since after the opening) have grown along the sides of the road and canal. The bridge has the distinction of a Florida Heritage Site Marker in recognition of its architecture and historical significance to the state.

Cosmetotextiles are impregnated with a finish composed of solid microcapsules, each holding a specific amount of cosmetic substance meant to be released totally and instantly on the human body. Cosmetotextiles currently offered on the market claim to be moisturising, perfumed, cellulite reducing or body slimming. The release pattern of the microcapsules on cosmetotextiles is triggered by an impact, most likely friction or pressure between the body and fabric, breaking the capsules into fragments and liberating the cosmetic properties. Recent studies have started to question the nature of the microcapsules’ shells and their toxicity impact or possible allergy reactions on humans. Because shell residues and excessive irregular amounts of substance are left on the skin surface after liberation, micro-encapsulation is more and more preferred for applications that are not in direct contact with human body, while the dermotextile technology, using natural based micro-particles as cosmetic carriers instead of microcapsules, is slowly taking over the skincare field. Nevertheless, micro-encapsulation is still widely used in the smart textiles area and offers optimal results when applied to diffuse a substance in the environment like perfume or to act as a protective barrier against external elements.

Representative Charles Goodell had been appointed by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to serve the remainder of Robert F. Kennedy's senatorial term following Kennedy's assassination. Goodell attempted to win election to a full term in the Senate with the Republican and Liberal nominations, but faced opposition from Democratic nominee Richard Ottinger and Conservative nominee James L. Buckley. Buckley was able to win with a plurality of the popular vote due to the left- wing vote being split between Ottinger and Goodell. Buckley would serve in the Senate until his reelection bid was defeated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1976. Buckley's victory in the 1970 election would remain the last time a third party candidate won election to the Senate until Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman won reelection with the Connecticut for Lieberman nomination in 2006. Background It was speculated that Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, the younger brother of President John F. Kennedy and older brother of Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, would seek the Democratic nomination for New York's Senate election in 1964. Elected members of the Democratic Party supported a possible campaign by Robert Kennedy, with New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. endorsing him on August 21, 1964. On August 25, Kennedy announced that he would seek the Democratic Senatorial nomination, after establishing a residence in Glen Cove, New York. On September 1, 1964, he defeated Representative Samuel S. Stratton for the Democratic nomination at the Democratic state convention with 968 to 153 delegate votes. He also received the nomination of the Liberal Party with a majority of the delegate vote. In the general election he defeated incumbent Republican Senator Kenneth Keating. =Appointment= On March 16, 1968, Kennedy announced that he would seek the presidential nomination of the Democratic Party for the 1968 presidential election. After winning four primaries Kennedy was assassinated by Sirhan Sirhan in Los Angeles, California on June 6. Kennedy's death left a vacancy in the United States Senate that would be filled through an appointment by Governor Nelson Rockefeller. John W. Gardner, John Lindsay, Burke Marshall, C. Douglas Dillon, Charles Goodell, Ogden Reid, and Whitney Young were mentioned and speculated as possible candidates for the appointment. On August 11, a spokesman for Rockfeller stated that main choices for the appointment were Gardner, Goodell, and Reid. On September 10, Rockefeller appointed Goodell, a member of the House of Representatives from the 38th congressional district, to fill the vacancy. On July 16, 1968, Joseph A. Valenti filed a lawsuit in the Western District Court against Governor Rockefeller attempting to have a special election held during the 1968 election cycle rather than the 1970 election cycle. Randolph Phillips and George Backer filed similar lawsuits in the Southern District Court on July 17, and July 19. On January 20, 1969, the Southern District Court dismissed their cases allowing for Goodell to serve the remainder of Kennedy's term until a regular election was held in 1970. Conservative nomination James L. Buckley's campaign logo On January 28, 1970, Kevin P. McGovern announced that he would seek the Conservative Party's senatorial nomination and criticized the party's leadership for allegedly favoring state Senator John J. Marchi. On April 6, James L. Buckley, the brother of conservative author William F. Buckley Jr. and the party's former senatorial nominee in 1968, announced that he would seek the Conservative Party's nomination. The Conservative State Committee convened inside Hotel McAlpin in Manhattan, New York City, on April 7, to select the party's nominees in the general election. McGovern attempted to force a primary campaign between him and Buckley, but failed to receive the 25% of delegate votes to force a primary. Buckley received nearly ninety percent of the delegate votes and the remainder was split between McGovern and abstaining delegates. =Candidates= Declared *James L.

Marchi, member of the New York State Senate from the 23rd district =Results= Democratic nomination thumbrightResults of the Democratic primary Prior to the Democratic primary New York Democratic state chairman John J. Burns met with Representatives Richard Ottinger, Benjamin Stanley Rosenthal, Jonathan Brewster Bingham, and Otis G. Pike in Washington, D.C., in 1969, to discuss plans to prevent party infighting during the 1970 Senate Democratic primary. On July 12, Paul O'Dwyer, who had received the Democratic nomination for Senate in 1968, announced that he would seek the Democratic senatorial nomination in 1970. O'Dwyer formally announced his candidacy in New York City on December 11, and again in Albany on December 12. However, he was criticized for his refusal to support Hubert Humphrey during the 1968 presidential election. Joseph Zaretski, the Democratic Minority Leader in the state Senate, stated that O'Dwyer was the only candidate with a \\"tremendous chance of winning the Democratic designation\\" due to his statewide organization. On May 12, 1969, Ted Sorensen, who had served as White House Counsel during John F. Kennedy's presidency, stated that prior to Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, he had been asked to run for Kennedy's Senate seat. Sorensen started to campaign for the Democratic senatorial nomination in October. Representative Richard Ottinger announced on January 19, 1970, that he would be entering the Democratic senatorial primary as the \\"unity candidate\\". Ottinger formally announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on February 24. On January 29, Rosenthal announced that he would conduct a statewide tour to test support for a possible senatorial campaign. He promised that he would not cause an irresponsible or destructive primary in a letter written to the state's 300 Democratic committee members. The next day his office stated that Rosenthal was actively campaigning for the Democratic nomination. Although Rosenthal never official announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination he announced on March 4, that he would seek reelection to the House of Representatives as he was unable to find support for a possible senatorial campaign. On January 12, Representative Richard D. McCarthy stated that he was interested in running for the Democratic nomination for the senate election. On February 27, McCarthy announced that he would seek the Democratic nomination. On April 2, McCarthy dropped out of the Democratic primary to help maintain party unity, but later reentered the primary on April 19, as he felt that Upstate New York would lack representation among the Democratic nominees due to all of the other candidates being from the New York metropolitan area. On February 23, Morris B. Abram, the president of Brandeis University who had challenged Georgia's voting system in a lawsuit that resulted in the one man, one vote principle being established by the Supreme Court of the United States, announced his resignation from his position so that he could seek the Democratic nomination for senator. However, the Poughkeepsie Board of Elections ruled that Abram was ineligible to run in the Democratic primary as he registered as a member of the Democratic Party on January 26, 1970, meaning that according to New York's election laws he could only run in Democratic primaries after the 1970 general election. The only way that Abram could be granted permission participate in the Democratic primary would be if the New York State Democratic Committee gave 51% approval at its convention on April 1. On March 6, Abram asked the state committee for permission to run, but state chairman John J. Burns stated that a survey of party officials showed little support for him due to his decision to sit out the 1968 presidential election. However, Burns told Abram to conduct a statewide campaign in an attempt to gain support from state committee members. He withdrew from the primary and endorsed Ted Sorensen for the nomination on April 9. The 345 member of the Democratic state committee convened in Liberty, New York, from March 31 to April 2, to select the party's nominees. Sorensen received 62% of the delegate vote, making him the designated candidate for the primary, to O'Dwyer's 25%, and Ottinger's 12%. As Sorensen and O'Wyer were the only candidates to receive more than 25% of the delegate vote they were the only candidates given automatic access onto the primary ballot. All of the other candidates had to petition their way onto the primary ballot with over 10,000 signatures. Ottinger filed petitions with a total of 26,463 signatures and McCarthy filed petitions with a total of 17,080 signatures. On June 23, the Democratic primary was held in which Ottinger won with over 366,000 votes. O'Dwyer placed second with over 300,000 votes, and performed best within New York City. Sorensen, who was selected as the designated candidate by the state committee, placed a distant third with over 154,000 votes. McCarthy placed last in fourth with over 102,000 votes, and only placed first in his home county, Erie County, and surrounding Cattaraugus and Wyoming counties. =Candidates= Declared *Richard D. McCarthy, member of United States House of Representatives from New York's 39th congressional district *Paul O'Dwyer, former member of the New York City Council and Democratic nominee in the 1968 Senate election *Richard Ottinger, member of United States House of Representatives from New York's 25th congressional district *Ted Sorensen, 7th White House Counsel Withdrew *Benjamin Stanley Rosenthal, member of United States House of Representatives from New York's 8th congressional district Ineligible *Morris B.

Pike, member of the United States House of Representatives from New York's 1st congressional district *Howard J. Samuels, 8th Administrator of the Small Business Administration and Democratic lieutenant gubernatorial nominee in 1966 *Samuel S. Stratton, member of the United States House of Representatives from New York's 35th congressional district *Adam Walinsky, advisor to President John F. Kennedy =Results= Liberal nomination The Liberal Party's nomination was electorally important as due to New York's electoral fusion law the party could give its nomination, and a large percentage of the popular vote, to any other party nominee. In the 1968 Senate election incumbent Republican Senator Jacob Javits had defeated Paul O'Dwyer by over one million votes, with half of that total coming from the Liberal Party's ballot line. On April 4, 1970, the state committee selected Timothy W. Costello to serve as the party's placeholder senatorial candidate. The committee selected placeholder candidates for multiple positions as New York law allowed for parties to replace their nominees within five weeks of selecting them. Due to the selection of Costello, who was serving as Deputy Mayor of New York City, Leon A. Katz, a member of the New York City Council, called for Mayor John Lindsay to fire Costello. Charles Goodell was favored by officials in the Liberal Party due to criticism levied against him by members of the Republican and Conservative state committees and his opposition to the Vietnam War. Costello also endorsed Goodell before the nomination ballot. On May 11, Goodwell received the party's nomination against Paul O'Dwyer, Richard D. McCarthy, Richard Ottinger, and Ted Sorenson. Prior to the ballot voting O'Dwyer accused the Liberal Party of rigging the ballot in favor of Goodell and stated that his nomination would be a betrayal to liberal voters. =Candidates= *Charles Goodell, incumbent United States Senator and former member of United States House of Representatives from New York's 38th congressional district *Richard D. McCarthy, member of United States House of Representatives from New York's 39th congressional district *Paul O'Dwyer, former member of the New York City Council and Democratic nominee in the 1968 Senate election *Richard Ottinger, member of United States House of Representatives from New York's 25th congressional district *Ted Sorensen, 7th White House Counsel =Results= Republican nomination On March 24, 1970, Charles Goodell announced that he would seek reelection to the United States Senate. During his announcement speech in front of 250 people at the Park Central Hotel Goodell criticized Nixon's civil rights, military spending, and Vietnam policies and Nixon's nomination of G. Harrold Carswell to the Supreme Court of the United States. James L. Buckley attempted to enter the Republican senatorial primary, but was rejected by the Republican State Committee. On April 8, the 360 member Republican state committee convened to select the Republican nominees for multiple offices. Goodell faced no opposition during ballot although 49 of the 360 committee members, from Nassau, Suffolk, and Queens counties, chose to abstain rather than to vote for him. The entire 28-member Nassau County delegation abstained due to Goodell's lack of support for Nixon, but chose to not nominate another candidate as that could lead to primary challenges in the state legislator and accusations of not being \\"real\\" Republicans. Joseph Margiotta, the Nassau County Chairman, also stated that abstaining would not anger Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who supported Goodell. =Candidates= Declared *Charles Goodell, incumbent United States Senator and former member of United States House of Representatives from New York's 38th congressional district Ineligible *James L. Buckley, Conservative nominee in the 1968 Senate election and brother of William F. Buckley Jr. =Results= Other nominations =Communist= Arnold Johnson, the public relations director of the Communist Party USA, was selected to serve as the Communist Party's senatorial nominee. =Conservation= On July 15, 1970, Richard Ottinger's campaign announced that it would circulate petitions in an attempt to gain another ballot line named the Conservation Party. James L. Buckley criticized the party as an attempt to confuse voters who wished to vote for the Conservative Party. Ottinger's campaign claimed that conservation was chosen for the party's name to reflect Ottigner's support for environmental protection. In August, Ottinger filed petitions with a total of 33,561 signatures, more than the 12,000 required, to gain the additional ballot line. However, Mason Hampton, the attorney of the Nassau County Conservative Party, filed 24 objections with the board of elections over the Conservation Party and Representative James F. Hastings filed an objection to Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo over the party's name on August 24. On September 4, Lomenzo ruled that the Conservation Party's name was too similar to the Conservative Party's name and ruled the Conservation Party off of the general election ballot. Ottinger made an appeal to the New York Supreme Court, and on September 17, the state Supreme Court ruled that the Conservation Party could appear on the ballot. However, the Conservative Party made an appeal to the Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court and on October 1, the court ruled in favor of removing the Conservation Party from the general election ballot. Ottinger made an appeal to the New York Court of Appeals, but on October 7, the Court of Appeals ruled four to three to sustain the decision of the appellate court decision. =Independent Alliance= The second ballot emblem of the Independent Alliance Party On June 20, 1970, F. Clifton White, James L. Buckley's campaign manager, announced that Buckley's campaign would circulate petitions in an attempt to gain another ballot line named the Independent Alliance Party. Enough valid signatures were collected to gain the additional ballot line, but Secretary of State John P. Lomenzo ruled that the Independent Alliance's emblem, an outline of New York with Buckley's name inside, was illegal as New York's election law limited the number of times that a candidate's name could appear on a ballot line to one. Lomenzo later allowed the party onto the ballot after the emblem was changed to a shield with the letter \\"I\\" inside. Although the Independent Alliance Party received over 100,000 votes in the general election, more than the 50,000 votes required to become an official party and automatic ballot access, it did not become an official party as its only candidate was Buckley, who ran in the Senate election and not in the gubernatorial election where the 50,000 votes were required to come from. =Socialist Labor= In April 1970, the Socialist Labor Party of America selected John Emanuel, who had served as the party's nominee in the 1969 New York City mayoral election and as the party's senatorial candidate in 1968, as its senatorial nominee. =Socialist Workers= On January 22, 1970, the Socialist Workers Party selected Kipp Dawson, who was 29 years old, as its senatorial nominee. She had served as a national coordinator of the Student Mobilization Committee to End The War in Vietnam. General election Richard Ottinger bumper sticker On September 14, a debate was held between Buckley, Goodell, and Ottinger at the New York State Publishers Association dinner with a four-person panel asking questions. During the debate Goodell and Ottinger stated that the $100,000 bail for the Panther 21 was unconstitutional and supported the direct election of the president while Buckley stated that the bail was constitutional and supported the present use of the electoral college to select the president. A televised debate was held on October 11, between Buckley, Goodell, and Ottinger by WABC- TV. Goodell and Ottinger gave support to opposition to the Vietnam War and criticized the foreign policy in Latin America would lead to \\"more Vietnams\\" in Latin America. Buckley gave support to the Vietnam War and stated that leaving Vietnam would undermine the trust of other small countries in the United States. Another televised debate between the candidates was held on October 18. On October 30, Stanley Shaw, the Liberal Party leader in Queens County, Paul Siminoff and Basil Kyriakakis, the Liberal Party leader in Syracuse and Rochester, and New York City Council Minority Leader Eldon R. Clingan called for an emergency meeting of the Liberal Party's state executive committee to decided whether or not to revoke its nomination from Goodell and instead give it to Ottinger to prevent a Buckley victory through vote splitting. Buckley won the senate election, receiving 2,288,190 votes (38.75%), against Ottinger, receiving 2,171,232 votes (36.77%), and Goodell, receiving 1,434,472 votes (24.29%). Buckley ran for reelection in 1976, but was defeated by Democratic nominee Daniel Patrick Moynihan. =Nixon and Agnew= Vice-president Spiro Agnew criticized Senator Charles Goodell with the approval of President Richard Nixon On June 23, 1970, Charles Goodell stated that he would not support President Richard Nixon during the 1972 presidential election if the United States continued its military involvement in Southeast Asia. On June 24, Goodell stated that he would conduct his campaign without aid from the Nixon administration. He later rejected financial aid from the Nixon administration and the Republican National Committee even though his campaign was struggling financially. Goodell lacked support among the Republican base and leadership. On July 1, the Dutchess County Republican Party voted 55 to 21 to not support Goodell, and the Ulster County Republican Party chose to not take a position on the Senate election and told voters to choose for themselves. On July 8, the Franklin County Republican Party voted unanimously to endorse Buckley. On August 25, the Norwich Republican committee endorsed all of the Republican candidates except for Goodell, as four of the eight committee members chose to abstain. However, Goodell later stated that he was a better supporter of Nixon than Senators Barry Goldwater and Strom Thurmond, as Goodell supported Nixon in 48% of his votes compared to Goldwater's 37% support. Goodell also stated that the invasion of Cambodian would be a successful tactical campaign, but that the war would continue to drag on. Nixon declined to endorse any candidate in New York's senate election. Assistant Press Secretary Gerald Lee Warren stated that Nixon had no position in the election when the New York Times asked Warren if the White House preferred Buckley over Goodell. Goodell stated that Nixon wanted the entire Republican slate to win their elections and that the only reason he chose not to endorse Goodell was due to him asking Nixon to not do so. Buckley stated that Goodell was attempting to \\"turn any misfortune of the campaign to his advantage\\". Although Nixon declined to take a position in New York's senate election, Vice-president Spiro Agnew did. On September 30, Agnew criticized Goodell for as he had \\"left the [Republican] party\\" and joined the \\"awful liberal-radical coalition\\" to obstruct Nixon's policies. It was revealed that Nixon had approved of Agnew's criticism of Goodell before traveling to Europe. Goodell stated that if Nixon wished to remain neutral in the senate election then he should keep Agnew out of the election as well. Senate Minority Leader Hugh Scott criticized Agnew for his attacks on Goodell, and liberal Republican Senators Jacob Javits, Edward Brooke, and Mark Hatfield also criticized Agnew. Goodell offered to debate Agnew, but Agnew declined stating that he was \\"challenged to debates every day\\". On October 8, Agnew referred to Goodell as the \\"Christine Jorgensen of the Republican Party\\", comparing Goodell to the American soldier who had undergone sex reassignment surgery in the 1950s; Jorgensen later demanded an apology from Agnew as she did not want her name to be used in \\"dirty politics\\".

Shakespeare Sacrificed: Or the Offering to Avarice by James Gillray. The Father and Mother by Boardman Robinson depicting War as the offspring of Greed and Pride. Greed (or avarice) is an uncontrolled longing for increase in the acquisition or use: of material gain (be it food, money, land, or animate/inanimate possessions); or social value, such as status, or power. Greed has been identified as undesirable throughout known human history because it creates behavior-conflict between personal and social goals.  Nature of greed  The initial motivation for (or purpose of) greed and actions associated with it may be the promotion of personal or family survival. It may at the same time be an intent to deny or obstruct competitors from potential means (for basic survival and comfort) or future opportunities; therefore being insidious or tyrannical and having a negative connotation. Alternately, the purpose could be defense or counteractive response to such obstructions being threatened by others. But regardless of purpose, greed intends to create an inequity of access or distribution to community wealth. Modern economic thought frequently distinguishes greed from self-interest, even in its earliest worksCharles de Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989), p. 338Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations (New York: Modern Library, 1965), p.651, and spends considerable effort distinguishing the line between the two. By the mid-19th Century - affected by the phenomenological ideas of Hegel - economic and political thinkers began to define greed inherent to the structure of society as a negative and inhibitor to the development of societies.Thorstein Veblen, The Theory of the Leisure Class (1934 ed.), p. 36Karl Marx, The Communist Manifesto, London, 1848 Keynes wrote ‘The world is not so governed from above that private and social interest always coincide. It is not so managed here below that in practice they coincide’.Keynes, The End of Laissez-Faire, http://www.panarchy.org/keynes/laissezfaire.1926.html Both views continue to pose fundamental questions in today's economic thinking.http://piotr-evdokimov.com/greed.pdf As a secular psychological concept, greed is an inordinate desire to acquire or possess more than one needs. The degree of inordinance is related to the inability to control the reformulation of \\"wants\\" once desired \\"needs\\" are eliminated. Erich Fromm described greed as \\"a bottomless pit which exhausts the person in an endless effort to satisfy the need without ever reaching satisfaction.\\" It is typically used to criticize those who seek excessive material wealth, although it may equally be applied to the need to feel more excessively moral, social, or otherwise better than someone else. One individual consequence of greedy activity may be an inability to sustain any of the costs or burdens associated with that which has been or is being accumulated, leading to a backfire or destruction, whether of self or more generally. Other outcomes may include a degradation of social position, or exclusion from community protections. So, the level of \\"inordinance\\" of greed pertains to the amount of vanity, malice or burden associated with it.

Lucretius  The Roman poet Lucretius thought that the fear of dying and poverty were major drivers of greed, with dangerous consequences for morality and order: > And greed, again, and the blind lust of honours Which force poor wretches > past the bounds of law, And, oft allies and ministers of crime, To push > through nights and days with hugest toil To rise untrammelled to the peaks > of power— These wounds of life in no mean part are kept Festering and open > by this fright of death.Lucretius.

Epictetus  The Roman Stoic Epictetus also saw the dangerous moral consequences of greed, and so advised the greedy to instead take pride in letting go of the desire for wealth, rather than be like the man with a fever who cannot drink his fill: > Nay, what a price the rich themselves, and those who hold office, and who > live with beautiful wives, would give to despise wealth and office and the > very women whom they love and win! Do you not know what the thirst of a man > in a fever is like, how different from the thirst of a man in health?

Spinoza  Baruch Spinoza thought that the masses were concerned with money-making more than any other activity, since, he believed, it seemed to them like spending money was prerequisite for enjoying any goods and services.Baruch Spinoza. The Ethics, Book IV, Appendix, XXVIII. 'Now for providing these nourishments the strength of each individual would hardly suffice, if men did not lend one another mutual aid. But money has furnished us with a token for everything: hence it is with the notion of money, that the mind of the multitude is chiefly engrossed: nay, it can hardly conceive any kind of pleasure, which is not accompanied with the idea of money as cause.' Translated by R. H. M. Elwes. Project Gutenberg. Yet he did not consider this preoccupation to be necessarily a form of greed, and felt that the ethics of the situation were nuanced: > This result is the fault only of those, who seek money, not from poverty or > to supply their necessary wants, but because they have learned the arts of > gain, wherewith they bring themselves to great splendour. Certainly they > nourish their bodies, according to custom, but scantily, believing that they > lose as much of their wealth as they spend on the preservation of their > body. But they who know the true use of money, and who fix the measure of > wealth solely with regard to their actual needs, live content with > little.Spinoza. The Ethics, Book IV, Appendix, XXIX.  Locke  John Locke claims that unused property is wasteful and an offence against nature, because \\"as anyone can make use of to any advantage of life before it spoils; so much he may by his labour fix a property in. Whatever is beyond this, is more than his share, and belongs to others.”https://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/locke1689a.pdf, Chapter 5  Laurence Sterne  In the Laurence Sterne novel Tristram Shandy, the titular character describes his uncle's greed for knowledge about fortifications, saying that the 'desire of knowledge, like the thirst of riches, increases ever with the acquisition of it', that 'The more my uncle Toby pored over his map, the more he took a liking to it', and that 'The more my uncle Toby drank of this sweet fountain of science, the greater was the heat and impatience of his thirst'.Laurence Sterne.

Rousseau  The Swiss philosophe Jean- Jacques Rousseau compared man in the state of nature, who has no need of greed since he can find food anywhere, with man in the state of society: > for whom first necessaries have to be provided, and then superfluities; > delicacies follow next, then immense wealth, then subjects, and then slaves. > He enjoys not a moment's relaxation; and what is yet stranger, the less > natural and pressing his wants, the more headstrong are his passions, and, > still worse, the more he has it in his power to gratify them; so that after > a long course of prosperity, after having swallowed up treasures and ruined > multitudes, the hero ends up by cutting every throat till he finds himself, > at last, sole master of the world.

Kline. Goethe (Re)Collected.  Marx  Karl Marx thought that 'avarice and the desire to get rich are the ruling passions' in the heart of every burgeoning capitalist, who later develops a 'Faustian conflict' in his heart 'between the passion for accumulation, and the desire for enjoyment' of his wealth.Karl Marx. Capital, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter 24. Translated by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling. Edited by Frederick Engels. Marxists Internet Archive. He also stated that 'With the possibility of holding and storing up exchange-value in the shape of a particular commodity, arises also the greed for gold' and that 'Hard work, saving, and avarice are, therefore, [the hoarder's] three cardinal virtues, and to sell much and buy little the sum of his political economy.'Karl Marx. Capital, Volume 1, Part 1, Chapter III. 'In order that gold may be held as money, and made to form a hoard, it must be prevented from circulating, or from transforming itself into a means of enjoyment. The hoarder, therefore, makes a sacrifice of the lusts of the flesh to his gold fetish. He acts in earnest up to the Gospel of abstention. On the other hand, he can withdraw from circulation no more than what he has thrown into it in the shape of commodities. The more he produces, the more he is able to sell. Hard work, saving, and avarice are, therefore, his three cardinal virtues, and to sell much and buy little the sum of his political economy.' Marx discussed what he saw as the specific nature of the greed of capitalists thusly: > Use-values must therefore never be looked upon as the real aim of the > capitalist; neither must the profit on any single transaction. The restless > never-ending process of profit-making alone is what he aims at. This > boundless greed after riches, this passionate chase after exchange-value, is > common to the capitalist and the miser; but while the miser is merely a > capitalist gone mad, the capitalist is a rational miser. The never-ending > augmentation of exchange-value, which the miser strives after, by seeking to > save his money from circulation, is attained by the more acute capitalist, > by constantly throwing it afresh into circulation. Marx. Capital, Volume 1, > Part 2, Chapter IV.  Meher Baba  Meher Baba dictated that \\"Greed is a state of restlessness of the heart, and it consists mainly of craving for power and possessions. Possessions and power are sought for the fulfillment of desires. Man is only partially satisfied in his attempt to have the fulfillment of his desires, and this partial satisfaction fans and increases the flame of craving instead of extinguishing it. Thus greed always finds an endless field of conquest and leaves the man endlessly dissatisfied. The chief expressions of greed are related to the emotional part of man.\\"Baba, Meher (1967). Discourses. Volume II. San Francisco: Sufism Reoriented. p. 27.  Ivan Boesky  Ivan Boesky famously defended greed in an 18 May 1986 commencement address at the UC Berkeley's School of Business Administration, in which he said, \\"Greed is all right, by the way. I want you to know that. I think greed is healthy. You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself\\". This speech inspired the 1987 film Wall Street, which features the famous line spoken by Gordon Gekko: \\"Greed, for lack of a better word, is good. Greed is right, greed works. Greed clarifies, cuts through, and captures the essence of the evolutionary spirit. Greed, in all of its forms; greed for life, for money, for love, knowledge has marked the upward surge of mankind.\\"  Inspirations  Scavenging and hoarding of materials or objects, theft and robbery, especially by means of violence, trickery, or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by greed. Such misdeeds can include simony, where one profits from soliciting goods within the actual confines of a church. A well-known example of greed is the pirate Hendrick Lucifer, who fought for hours to acquire Cuban gold, becoming mortally wounded in the process. He died of his wounds hours after having transferred the booty to his ship.  Genetics  Some research suggests there is a genetic basis for greed. It is possible people who have a shorter version of the ruthlessness gene (AVPR1a) may behave more selfishly.'Ruthlessness gene' discovered See also * Contempt * Financialization * Interest * Narcissism * Genoeconomics * Seven deadly sins * American Greed * Greed, film * Greed, film * Greed (game show) * Ojukokoro (Greed), film * Greed (Jelinek novel), novel * Greed is good * Theft * Mr. Krabs * Usury  References  External links  Category:Seven deadly sins Category:Concepts in ethics ","title":"Greed"},{"id":"27024156","text":"Lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate is the lithium salt of the weakly coordinating anion (B(C6F5)4)−. Because of its weakly coordinating abilities, lithium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate makes it commercially valuable in the salt form in the catalyst composition for olefin polymerization reactions and in electrochemistry. It is a water-soluble compound. Its anion is closely related to the non-coordinating anion known as BARF. The tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borates have the advantage of operating on a one- to-one stoichiometric basis with Group IV transition metal polyolefin catalysts, unlike methylaluminoxane (MAO) which may be used in large excess. Structure and properties The anion is tetrahedral with B-C bond lengths of approximately 1.65 Angstroms. The salt has only been obtained as the etherate, and the crystallography confirms that four ether (OEt2) molecules are bound to the lithium cation, with Li-O bond lengths of approximately 1.95 Å. The [Li(OEt2)4]+ complex is tetrahedral. Preparation The salt was first produced in studies on tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron, a well known Lewis acidic compound. Combining equimolar ether solutions of pentafluorophenyllithium and tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron gives the lithium salt of tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate, which precipitates the etherate as a white solid:A.G.

It occupies the building previously used by Heathfield High School, a defunct Roman Catholic High School. The majority of students live in Cardiff, although admissions priority is given to students from Roman Catholic secondary schools in the surrounding area. These schools include Corpus Christi High School, Mary Immaculate High School and St Illtyd's Catholic High School. In 2019, controversy arose when Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council planned to close the sixth forms of Pontypridd High School, Hawthorn High School, and Cardinal Newman Roman Catholic School, Rhydyfelin, with a significant number of pupils potentially being diverted to St. David's College (particularly from Cardinal Newman). Outcries led to an appeal in the High Court, which ruled in favour of protecting places at the existing sixth forms.  Academics  Courses offered by St David's include GCSEs, BTECs, A levels and the Welsh Baccalaureate. Nearly 30 different AS and A Level courses are offered. In addition to the Level 2 and Level 3 courses offered, a Level 4 'Honours Programme' is available to students aspiring to go to prestigious universities such as Oxford and Cambridge.

Unlike the competing TZR, NSR, and RGV ranges, the KR-1 was not inspired by a Kawasaki production race bike, as they did not build or race one. Despite this, Kawasaki still conceived the KR-1 so that they could tap the incredibly competitive quarter-liter two-stroke market; the most important JDM motorcycle class in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Kawasaki was the first of the Japanese 'big four' to cease production of its road-going 250 two-stroke, when it called time on the KR-1 in 1992. They were also the only manufacturer not to eventually produce a V-twin for this class, the KR-1 retaining its parallel twin throughout its short production. It also never received a major update. The KR-1 was touted as the fastest in class,https://www.motorcyclenews.com/bike-reviews/kawasaki/kr1s/1990/ as well as the easiest to tune. It was an incredibly popular race bike, where its dicey, prone to head-shake handling and unreliability were somewhat overlooked or dealt with. Given the above, KR-1s in good condition have become exceedingly rare, the KR-1R easily the rarest of all the road-going 250cc two- strokes. Model history In 1988, Kawasaki produced a road racing replica motorcycle. The initial models were the B1, B2 series of the KR-1. In 1989, due to the sales success and updated models of competing manufacturers (RGV, NSR, TZR) the KR-1 (B series) evolved into the KR-1S and KR-1R (C, D series). The C1, C2, C3 and D1, D2 models shared the same engine (minor updates) and bodywork (different colour schemes) of the previous KR-1. The S and R models differed slightly in construction of frame, wheels, brakes, and colour schemes. The engine for all KR-1 models was a two-cylinder, reed valve induction two-stroke motor of (somewhat based on the previous Yamaha TZ/TZR configurations). The 180° firing parallel twin configuration featured a crank driven balance shaft. The power delivery was broadened with the use of the Kawasaki Integrated Powervalve System (K.I.P.S.) arrangement shared by other Kawasaki two-strokes. Total production of all models in KR-1 (B/C/D) series was less than 10,000 units worldwide. The low production numbers has increased collectibility. Worldwide markets for sales were Japan, United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa (excluded USA due to emissions restrictions). Considered to be least successful of the four Japanese 250 two- stroke race replicas (in terms of sales), the KR-1 series was notable for excellent handling, due to its light weight and steering geometry and least difficult to modify and increase the power output of the engine. Proven to be fastest of all 250 cc models (Suzuki RGV250, Yamaha TZR250, Honda NSR250R, Aprilia RS250) with a top speed of 139 mph (225 km/h) - tested by Performance Bikes Magazine and subsequently at Bonneville Speedway (World's Fastest Production 250 cc) Special models The KR-1R (D1,D2 models) was intended to compete with the more racetrack oriented 'SP' 250 two stroke models being produced by competing Japanese factories Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki. It was sold only within the Japanese domestic market and retailed for some 599,000yen (559,000yen for S model). The 'R' featured larger 35mm carburetors, a close ratio gearbox, improved internal suspension components, different wheel rims, and came only in an Ebony/Green(Black/Green) color scheme - unique to the R. Total production is estimated at around 180 units and subsequently they are extremely collectible.

Karl Gustaf von Brinkman (25 February 1764 – 25 December 1847) was a Swedish and German classicist poet, writer and diplomat. Member of the Swedish Academy 1828–1847, Seat No. 3, ennobled and elevated to Baron, chamberlain. Karl Gustaf von Brinkman was born in Nacka, Sweden and was the son of Secretary Hans Gustaf von Brinkman and Countess Beata Kristina Leijon Manor. His education was from the beginning of strictly religious orientation, as his father intended him for a missionary work. He attended from 1782 to 1785, the Seminar of the Moravian Church in Barby, Germany. He became acquainted with Friedrich Schleiermacher, who devoted his later writings on religion. In 1787 he began to study at the University of Halle, and studied philosophy and law. In 1889 he went on an educational journey that led him to Wittenberg, Jena, Weimar, Leipzig and Berlin. Through his activities in 1791 in government service, he received the confidence of King Gustav III of Sweden. He then became Secretary of Legation in Berlin in 1792 and began his diplomatic career. In Berlin, he moved in the romantic salons, met William and Alexander von Humboldt, and was assistant at Friedrich Schiller's Musen-Almanach. From 1798 until 1801 he was involved in diplomatic affairs in Paris and at this time frequented the house of Anne Louise Germaine de Staël. As ambassador in Berlin (1807), he made among other things the acquaintance of Johannes von Müller, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Friedrich von Gentz, Adam Müller, with whom he had constant exchange of ideas. He accompanied the royal family on their flight to East Prussia. From 1808 until 1810 he was ambassador in London and became a deputy chancellor in Stockholm. His diplomatic career changed abruptly when he lost the confidence of the royal court. In 1835 focused only on literature, which he published in Swedish. His extensive correspondence, which he greatly enjoyed, shows him as a witty interlocutor. In 1836, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Von Brinkman died in 1847 in Stockholm.

History The golf club was established in 1924 with the purchase of Elm Park House and its surrounding lands. It opened the following year as a 9-hole golf club with an initial membership of 254 and, in 1926, extended its facilities with the opening of tennis courts.Elm Park Golf Club Website - History In 1933, the club sold property to the Religious Sisters of Charity as a site for St. Vincent's Hospital. In 1936, Nutley House and land was leased from the Religious Sisters of Charity and a 9-hole golf course and tennis courts were opened. In 1941, a short-term lease on Elm Park land was made from the Religious Sisters of Charity, as the hospital project had been postponed. This allowed the course to be expanded to 18 holes. However, in 1956, the Elm Park land had to be returned and the club was reduced to the earlier 9-hole course. The club expanded again in 1960 with the purchase of the nearby Bloomfield property, allowing it to extend the course to 18 holes once again. Then, in 1976, the clubhouse was extended to include a dining room, function room, locker rooms, office, and shop. The final expansion of lands took place in 1994 with the purchase of lands adjoining the 11th and 12th holes. A redesign of the greens took place in 2002 by the Golf Course Architect Patrick Merrigan, with a design that puts a priority on drive placement and second shot value. This also included strategically locating bunkers around the course. Facilities The club has an 18-hole golf course, a driving range, 7 grass tennis courts, 5 all-weather tennis courts, and 2 covered tennis courts. Nature The Elm Park Stream runs through the golf course, and is used to form water features / hazards.

A product of its time, the courts adhered to a laissez faire doctrine allowing firms to form a cartel, which would now be seen as contrary to the Competition Act 1998. It is notable for Lord Bramwell's dictum that: Facts A group of ship owners formed an association to raise their profits. The association agreed to limit the number of ships sent by the association to different ports, to give a 5% rebate on freights to all shippers of stock who dealt only with members, and that agents of members would be prohibited from dealing with anyone in the association if they did not deal exclusively with people in the association. If any member wished to withdraw, they would have to give notice. Mogul Steamship Co Ltd had been excluded. When it sent ships to the loading port to pick up cargo, the association sent more ships and underbid Mogul Steamship Co Ltd. The association also threatened to dismiss agents or withdraw rebates from anyone who dealt with Mogul Steamship Co Ltd.

All countries were urged to co-operate with the Commission of Inquiry established in Resolution 1013 (1995) and with the human rights operation in Rwanda. The Council remained convinced that the United Nations continue to play a role in the country. As requested in Resolution 1029 (1995), the Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was to begin withdrawing UNAMIR from Rwanda on 9 March 1996. All remaining elements of UNAMIR would contribute to the security and protection of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. With the consent of the Rwandan government, the Secretary-General was encouraged to continue the operation of the communications system and radio station to promote national reconciliation, strengthen the judicial system, facilitate the return of refugees and restore the country's infrastructure. Finally, the Secretary-General was asked by 5 April 1996 to report on the arrangements with Rwanda were made in relation to the protection of the Rwanda Tribunal after the withdrawal of UNAMIR, and other aforementioned issues.

Werner & Werner Corp, Santa Monica CA, 1977. Design and development The SNS-7 (Sorrell Negative Stagger, Model 7) was intended to give full unlimited aerobatic performance without sacrificing the comforts of a cabin-style aircraft. The Sorrell family originated from the state of Oregon, which was the last state to ban homebuilt aircraft. Hobie Sorrell petitioned congress for experimental aircraft regulations, and his son Tim designed the Hiperbipe in a series of family designed homebuilt aircraft. The design is of mixed construction. The fuselage, tail, engine mount, landing gear mounts, interplane struts and flight controls are all built from welded 4130 steel. The wings are made from wood, with wooden stressed skin. The landing gear is sprung steel tube. The engine cowling and wheel pants are fibreglass. The whole airframe is covered in doped aircraft fabric, including the plywood-covered wings. The airfoil is a custom symmetrical design. The SNS-7 is capable of advanced aerobatics, including vertical eight point rolls and inside and outside vertical eights. The tooling and manufacturing rights were acquired by Thunderbird Aviation in 2015, who began making parts and basic kits. Operational history In April 2010 there were 22 Hiperbipes registered in the United States, two in Canada, and one in the United Kingdom.

This colourless liquid is a precursor to especially allyl alcohol, which is a useful industrial intermediate. It is the acetate ester of allyl alcohol. Preparation Allyl acetate is produced industrially by the gas phase reaction of propene in the presence of acetic acid using a palladium catalyst: :C3H6 \\\\+ CH3COOH + ½ O2 → CH2=CHCH2OCOCH3 \\\\+ H2O This method is advantageous because propene is inexpensive and \\"green.\\" Allyl alcohol is also produced primarily from allyl chloride, but production via the hydrolysis of allyl acetate route avoids the use of chlorine, and so is increasing in use. Vinyl acetate is produced similarly, using ethylene in place of propene. These reactions are examples of acetoxylation. The palladium center is then re- oxidized by the O2 present. The mechanism for the acetoxylation follows a similar pathway, with propene forming a π-allyl bond on the palladium. :Catalytic cycle for the production of Allyl Acetate. Reactions and applications Allyl acetate can be hydrolyzed to allyl alcohol: :CH2=CHCH2OCOCH3 \\\\+ H2O → CH2=CHCH2OH + CH3COOH Allyl alcohol is a precursor for some specialty polymers, mainly for drying oils. Allyl alcohol is also a precursor to synthetic glycerol. Epoxidation by hydrogen peroxide produces glycidol, which undergoes hydrolysis to glycerol. :CH2=CHCH2OH + HOOH → CH2OCHCH2OH + H2O :CH2OCHCH2OH + H2O → C3H5(OH)3 Synthetic glycerol tends to be used in cosmetics and toiletries whereas glycerol from the hydrolysis of fats is used in food. =Substitution reactions= Substitution of the acetate group in allyl acetate using hydrogen chloride yields allyl chloride. Reaction with hydrogen cyanide over copper catalyst yields allyl cyanide. :CH2=CHCH2OCOCH3 \\\\+ HCl → CH2=CHCH2Cl + CH3COOH :CH2=CHCH2OCOCH3 \\\\+ HCN → CH2=CHCH2CN + CH3COOH Allyl chloride is generally produced directly by the chlorination of propene.

It included the steepest grade of any section of the Pittsburgh light rail system, of approximately 10 percent. History The 52 Allentown route was created in 1984 by renaming what was then the 49 Arlington-Warrington, itself created in 1971 by combining portions of the 48 Arlington and 49 Beltzhoover lines. In April 2010 the 52 Allentown was rebranded the \\"Brown Line\\" by the Port Authority. Prior to being discontinued, Brown Line service was severely reduced, operating only during Monday to Friday rush hours, with bus route 44 substitute providing service at other times. The Port Authority considered ending all Brown Line service, but this would have provided only limited savings unless the tracks and overhead wires were also decommissioned. More importantly, however, the Brown Line's tracks provided an alternate route when the Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel was closed (either due to planned maintenance or a stalled vehicle), allowing Red Line or Blue Line services to continue operating, albeit behind schedule since the Allentown routing took five to eight minutes longer than via the tunnel. On March 27, 2011, the Brown Line service was withdrawn due to a system-wide 15% service cut. The line is still used occasionally by Blue and Red line trains when the Mt. Washington Transit Tunnel is closed Route The Brown Line was much shorter and ran less frequently than the Red and Blue Lines. It provided service to the Allentown neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where dense housing and the hilly terrain make automobile transportation difficult—some area streets cannot be used at all during the winter. The route began at South Hills Junction, climbing upwards to Haberman and East Warrington Avenue. It continued along Warrington in an easterly direction until turning left onto Arlington Avenue, where it followed the sharply curving street northwards, over the shoulder of Mount Washington. At the intersection of McArdle Roadway it swung onto private right-of-way to reach the Panhandle Bridge (also used by the Red and Blue Lines) to cross the Monongahela River and gain entry to downtown, stopping at First Avenue, Steel Plaza, Wood Street, and Gateway Center. The entire line operated within the city of Pittsburgh.

Shirley Dobson, whose husband is James Dobson, an evangelical conservative Christian author and the founder of the politically conservative evangelical Christian organization Focus on the Family, was Chairwoman of the NDP Task Force from 1991 to 2016. The 2019 President, that took over the role of Chairman of the NDP Task Force is Kathy Branzell. The Task Force's theme for the 2013 Annual Observance was “Pray for America” and is based on the Biblical reference in Matthew 12:21, which states, \\"In his name the nations will put their hope.\\" The headquarters of the NDP Task Force is in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Offices were located at Focus on the Family until 2009. The website of the NDP Task Force states that “its business affairs remained separate” from those of Focus on the Family, but also that “between 1990 and 1993, Focus on the Family did provide grants in support of the NDP Task Force” and that “Focus on the Family was compensated for services rendered.” Purpose and mission In 2010, The National Day of Prayer Task Force's stated mission was to \\"communicate with every individual the need for personal repentance and prayer, mobilizing the Christian community to intercede for America and its leadership in the seven centers of power: government, military, media, business, education, church and family.\\" In 2011, the stated mission and purpose of the NDP Task Force were modified. Currently, the NDP Task Force’s stated mission is “to mobilize prayer in America and to encourage personal repentance and righteousness in the culture.” The NDP Task Force’s current \\"vision\\", according to their website, is “to mobilize and encourage personal and corporate prayer, regardless of current issues and positions; preserve America’s Christian heritage and defend the religious freedoms granted by the Constitution; emphasize prayer for America and its leadership in the seven centers of power: Government, Military, Media, Business, Education, Church and Family; foster unity within the Christian Church”. History Founded in 1983, the NDP Task Force is a non-profit subsidiary of the evangelical Christian National Prayer Committee, which was founded in 1979 by Mrs. Vonette Bright, co-founder of the evangelical Christian organization Campus Crusade for Christ International. While the NDP Task Force coordinates thousands of local events throughout the nation on the National Day of Prayer, the most prominent event is the National Observance in Washington D.C. During each year of the George W. Bush Administration, events coordinated with the NDP Task Force were held in the White House. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush each held only one NDP Task Force-coordinated religious ceremony on a National Day of Prayer during their tenures. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama held informal prayer meetings but did not participate in NDP Task Force events. Controversy Critics have charged that the NDP Task Force used its political power to “hijack” the National Day of Prayer to exclude all faiths except traditional Christians, and that this violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Aseem Shukla, co-founder of the Hindu American Foundation stated, “In 2005, the Hindu American Foundation was repulsed by Shirley Dobson's National Day of Prayer Task Force, when it sought to join celebrations throughout the country. This same task force joined the likes of Focus on Family and others, that enjoyed official status and the aura of government sanction.” During the George W. Bush administration, the NDP Task Force excluded members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from active participation in National Day of Prayer events, even in the state of Utah where Mormons make up 70% of the state's population. In 2004, this led an ecumenical group of 40 faiths to boycott the Task Force-sponsored event in the Utah Valley.

The Chief, US Army Reserve (CAR), Major General William Ward became the first USARC commander. He was dual hatted as CG and CAR. In 1991, MG Ward retired and turned the command over to MG Roger Sandler, the newly appointed CAR. During the tenure of MG Sandler the five continental Armys (CONUSAS) transferred their previous command/management responsibities to the USARC, putting total command and control of the subordinate units under the USARC. MG Max Baratz, the Deputy Commander of the USARC, became the day to day manager of all USARC activities. In 1994, MG Baratz was named CAR and USARC Commander upon the retirement of MG Sandler. In 1998, MG Plewes was named CAR and Commander of the USARC, replacing MG Baratz. He became the first CAR to become a LTG in the position. It had long been argued, that with the added responsibility of Command & Control, the CAR/USARC Commander, should carry the increased rank of LTG.

Nutritional neuroscience is the scientific discipline that studies the effects various components of the diet such as minerals, vitamins, protein, carbohydrates, fats, dietary supplements, synthetic hormones, and food additives have on neurochemistry, neurobiology, behavior, and cognition. Recent research on nutritional mechanisms and their effect on the brain show they are involved in almost every facet of neurological functioning including alterations in neurogenesis, neurotrophic factors, neural pathways and neuroplasticity, throughout the life cycle. Relatively speaking, the brain consumes an immense amount of energy in comparison to the rest of the body. The human brain is approximately 2% of the human body mass and uses 20–25% of the total energy expenditure. Therefore, mechanisms involved in the transfer of energy from foods to neurons are likely to be fundamental to the control of brain function. Insufficient intake of selected vitamins, or certain metabolic disorders, affect cognitive processes by disrupting the nutrient-dependent processes within the body that are associated with the management of energy in neurons, which can subsequently affect neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and cell survival. Minerals Deficiency or excess of essential minerals (e.g. iron, zinc, copper, and magnesium) can disrupt brain development and neurophysiology to affect behavior. Furthermore, minerals have been implicated in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's dementia. =Iron= Iron is essential for several critical metabolic enzymes and a deficiency of this mineral can disrupt brain development. For, example chronic marginal iron affects dopamine metabolism and myelin fatty acid composition and behavior in mice. In rats a marginal iron deficiency that does not cause anemia disrupted axon growth in the auditory nerve affecting auditory brainstem latency without major changes in myelination. In rhesus macaques, prenatal iron deficiency disrupts emotional behavior and polymorphisms that reduce the expression of monoamine oxidase interact with gestational iron deficiency to exacerbate the response to a stressful situation leading to increased aggressiveness. Inexpensive and effective iron supplementation is an available preventative strategy recommended by the World Health Organization. However, iron supplementation can exacerbate malaria infection. Therefore, individuals receiving iron supplementation in malaria- endemic areas must be carefully monitored. =Zinc= Zinc is essential for the structure and function of thousands of proteins critical for the function of every cell. electronic-book electronic- Zinc can also serve as a neurotransmitter in the brain, thus a deficiency of this mineral can clearly disrupt development as well as neurophysiology. For example, zinc deficiency during early development impairs neurogenesis leading to memory impairments. However, zinc deficiency later in life can disrupt appetite and cause depression like behavior. However, it is important to consider copper intake relative to zinc supplementation because excess zinc can disrupt copper absorption. Deficiency Conservative estimates suggest that 25% of the world's population is at risk of zinc deficiency. Hypozincemia is usually a nutritional deficiency, but can also be associated with malabsorption, diarrhea, acrodermatitis enteropathica, chronic liver disease, chronic renal disease, sickle-cell disease, diabetes, malignancy, pyroluria, and other chronic illnesses. It can also occur after bariatric surgery, heavy metal exposure and tartrazine. Zinc deficiency is typically the result of inadequate dietary intake of zinc, disease states that promote zinc losses, or physiological states that require increased zinc. Populations that consume primarily plant based diets that are low in bioavailable zinc often have zinc deficiencies.Solomons, N.W. (2001) Dietary Sources of zinc and factors affecting its bioavailability. Food Nutr. Bull. 22: 138-154 Diseases or conditions that involve intestinal malabsorption promote zinc losses. Fecal losses of zinc caused by diarrhea are one contributing factor, often common in developing countries. Changes in intestinal tract absorbability and permeability due, in part, to viral, protozoal, and bacteria pathogens may also encourage fecal losses of zinc. Physiological states that require increased zinc include periods of growth in infants and children as well as in mothers during pregnancy. =Anorexia= Zinc deficiency may cause a decrease in appetite which can degenerate into anorexia or anorexia nervosa. Appetite disorders, in turn, cause malnutrition and, notably, inadequate zinc intake. Anorexia itself is a cause of zinc deficiency, thus leading to a vicious cycle: the worsening of anorexia worsens the zinc deficiency. A 1994 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial showed that zinc (14 mg per day) doubled the rate of body mass increase in the treatment of anorexia nervosa. =Cognitive and motor function impairment= Cognitive and motor function may also be impaired in zinc deficient children. Zinc deficiency can interfere with many organ systems especially when it occurs during a time of rapid growth and development when nutritional needs are high, such as during infancy. In animal studies, rats who were deprived of zinc during early fetal development exhibited increased emotionality, poor memory, and abnormal response to stress which interfered with performance in learning situations. Zinc deprivation in monkeys showed that zinc deficient animals were emotionally less mature, and also had cognitive deficits indicated by their difficulty in retaining previously learned problems and in learning new problems. Human observational studies show weaker results. Low maternal zinc status has been associated with less attention during the neonatal period and worse motor functioning. In some studies, supplementation has been associated with motor development in very low birth weight infants and more vigorous and functional activity in infants and toddlers. Plasma zinc level has been associated with many psychological disorders. However, the nature of this relationship remains unclear in most instances. An increasing amount of evidence suggests that zinc deficiency could play a causal role in the etiology of depression. Indeed, zinc supplementation has been reported to improve measures of depression in randomized double blind placebo controlled trials. =Copper= Copper is important for the function of many enzymes in the brain. Notably, dopamine β-mono-oxygenase is affected by copper deficiency leading to increased dopamine and decreased norepinephrine levels. Both copper deficiency and toxicity can interfere with brain development and function. Deficiency The neurodegenerative syndrome of copper deficiency has been recognized for some time in ruminant animals, in which it is commonly known as \\"swayback\\". The disease involves a nutritional deficiency in the trace element copper. Copper is ubiquitous and daily requirement is low making acquired copper deficiency very rare. Copper deficiency can manifest in parallel with vitamin B12 and other nutritional deficiencies. The most common cause of copper deficiency is a remote gastrointestinal surgery, such as gastric bypass surgery, due to malabsorption of copper, or zinc toxicity. On the other hand, Menkes disease is a genetic disorder of copper deficiency involving a wide variety of symptoms that is often fatal. =Neurological presentation= Copper deficiency can cause a wide variety of neurological problems including, myelopathy, peripheral neuropathy, and optic neuropathy. =Myelopathy= Sufferers typically present difficulty walking (gait difficulty) caused by sensory ataxia (irregular muscle coordination) due to dorsal column dysfunction or degeneration of the spinal cord (myelopathy).Jaiser, S. R., & Winston, G. P. (2008). Copper deficiency myelopathy and subacute combined degeneration of the cord: why is the phenotype so similar?\\" Journal of Neurology 255, P569. Patients with ataxic gait have problems balancing and display an unstable wide walk. They often feel tremors in their torso, causing side way jerks and lunges.Ataxic Gait Demonstration. Online Medical Video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpiEprzObIU In brain MRI, there is often an increased T2 signalling at the posterior columns of the spinal cord in patients with myelopathy caused by copper deficiency. T2 signalling is often an indicator of some kind of neurodegeneration. There are some changes in the spinal cord MRI involving the thoracic cord, the cervical cord or sometimes both. Copper deficiency myelopathy is often compared to subacute combined degeneration (SCD). Subacute combined degeneration is also a degeneration of the spinal cord, but instead vitamin B12 deficiency is the cause of the spinal degeneration. SCD also has the same high T2 signalling intensities in the posterior column as copper deficient patient in MRI imaging. =Peripheral neuropathy= Another common symptom of copper deficiency is peripheral neuropathy, which is numbness or tingling that can start in the extremities and can sometimes progress radially inward towards the torso. In an Advances in Clinical Neuroscience & Rehabilitation (ACNR) published case report, a 69-year-old patient had progressively worsened neurological symptoms.Jaiser, Stephan R. and Duddy, R. Copper Deficiency Masquerading as Subacute Combined Degeneration of the Cord and Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Advances in clinical neuroscience and rehabilitation, http://www.acnr.co.uk/JA07/ACNR_JA07_abnwinner.pdf These symptoms included diminished upper limb reflexes with abnormal lower limb reflexes, sensation to light touch and pin prick was diminished above the waist, vibration sensation was lost in the sternum, and markedly reduced proprioception or sensation about the self's orientation. Many people suffering from the neurological effects of copper deficiency complain about very similar or identical symptoms as the patient. This numbness and tingling poses danger for the elderly because it increases their risk of falling and injuring themselves. Peripheral neuropathy can become very disabling leaving some patients dependent on wheel chairs or walking canes for mobility if there is lack of correct diagnosis. Rarely can copper deficiency cause major disabling symptoms. The deficiency will have to be present for an extensive amount of time until such disabling conditions manifest. =Optic neuropathy= Some patients suffering from copper deficiency have shown signs of vision and color loss. The vision is usually lost in the peripheral views of the eye. The bilateral vision loss is usually very gradual. An optical coherence tomography (OCT) shows some nerve fiber layer loss in most patients, suggesting the vision loss and color vision loss was secondary to optic neuropathy or neurodegeneration. Toxicity Copper toxicity can occur from excessive supplement use, eating acid foods cooked in uncoated copper cookware, exposure to excess copper in drinking water, or as the result of an inherited metabolic disorder in the case of Wilson's disease. A significant portion of the toxicity of copper comes from its ability to accept and donate single electrons as it changes oxidation state. This catalyzes the production of very reactive radical ions, such as hydroxyl radical in a manner similar to Fenton chemistry. This catalytic activity of copper is used by the enzymes with which it is associated, thus is only toxic when unsequestered and unmediated. This increase in unmediated reactive radicals is generally termed oxidative stress, and is an active area of research in a variety of diseases where copper may play an important but more subtle role than in acute toxicity. Some of the effects of aging may be associated with excess copper. In addition, studies have found that people with mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, had heightened levels of copper in their systems. However, it is unknown at this stage whether the copper contributes to the mental illness, whether the body attempts to store more copper in response to the illness, or whether the high levels of copper are the result of the mental illness. =Alzheimer's disease= Elevated free copper levels exist in Alzheimer's disease. Copper and zinc are known to bind to amyloid beta proteins in Alzheimer's disease. This bound form is thought to mediate the production of reactive oxygen species in the brain. A preliminary clinical trial suggests that zinc supplementation may be able to decrease copper levels and slow degeneration in Alzheimer's disease. =Manganese= Manganese is a component of some enzymes and stimulates the development and activity of other enzymes. Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) is the principal antioxidant in mitochondria. Several enzymes activated by manganese contribute to the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and cholesterol.Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine. Manganese. Dietary reference intakes for vitamin A, vitamin K, boron, chromium, copper, iodine, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, silicon, vanadium, and zinc. Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press; 2001:394-419. (National Academy Press) Deficiency of manganese causes skeletal deformation in animals and inhibits the production of collagen in wound healing.Keen CL, Zidenberg-Cherr S. Manganese. In: Ziegler EE, Filer LJ, eds. Present Knowledge in Nutrition. 7th ed. Washington D.C.: ILSI Press; 1996:334-343. On the other hand, manganese toxicity is associated with neurological complications. Toxicity Manganese poisoning is a toxic condition resulting from chronic exposure to manganese and first identified in 1837 by James Couper. =Presentation= Chronic exposure to excessive Mn levels can lead to a variety of psychiatric and motor disturbances, termed manganism. Generally, exposure to ambient Mn air concentrations in excess of 5 mg Mn/m3 can lead to Mn-induced symptoms. In initial stages of manganism, neurological symptoms consist of reduced response speed, irritability, mood changes, and compulsive behaviors. Upon protracted exposure symptoms are more prominent and resemble those of idiopathic Parkinson's disease, as which it is often misdiagnosed, although there are particular differences in both the symptoms (nature of tremors, for example), response to drugs such as levodopa, and affected portion of the basal ganglia. Symptoms are also similar to Lou Gehrig's disease and multiple sclerosis. =Causes= Manganism has become an active issue in workplace safety as it has been the subject of numerous product liability lawsuits against manufacturers of arc welding supplies. In these lawsuits, welders have accused the manufacturers of failing to provide adequate warning that their products could cause welding fumes to contain dangerously high manganese concentrations that could lead welders to develop manganism. Companies employing welders are also being sued, for what colloquially is known as \\"welders' disease\\". However, studies fail to show any link between employment as a welder and manganism (or other neurological problems). Manganism is also documented in reports of illicit methcathinone manufacturing. This is due to manganese being a byproduct of methcathinone synthesis if potassium permanganate is used as an oxidiser. Symptoms include apathy, bradykinesia, gait disorder with postural instability, and spastic- hypokinetic dysarthria. Another street drug sometimes contaminated with manganese is the so-called \\"Bazooka\\", prepared by free-base methods from cocaine using manganese carbonate. Reports also mention such sources as contaminated drinking water, and fuel additive methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT), which on combustion becomes partially converted into manganese phosphates and sulfate that go airborne with the exhaust,Reynolds JG, Roos JW, Wong J, Deutsch SE. Manganese particulates from vehicles using MMT fuel. In 15th International Neurotoxicology Conference, Little Rock, AR, 1997. and manganese ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate (Maneb), a pesticide. =Pathological mechanisms= Manganese may affect liver function, but the threshold of acute toxicity is very high. On the other hand, more than 95% of manganese is eliminated by biliary excretion. Any existing liver damage may slow this process, increasing its concentration in blood plasma.Ballatori N. Molecular mechanisms of hepatic metal transport. In Molecular Biology and Toxicology of Metals, Zalups RK, Koropatnick J (eds). Taylor & Francis: New York, 2000; 346-381. The exact neurotoxic mechanism of manganese is uncertain but there are clues pointing at the interaction of manganese with iron, zinc, aluminum, and copper. Based on a number of studies, disturbed iron metabolism could underlie the neurotoxic action of manganese. It participates in Fenton reactions and could thus induce oxidative damage, a hypothesis corroborated by the evidence from studies of affected welders. A study of the exposed workers showed that they have significantly fewer children. This may indicate that long-term accumulation of manganese affects fertility. Pregnant animals repeatedly receiving high doses of manganese bore malformed offspring significantly more often compared to controls. Manganism mimics Schizophrenia. It is found in large quantities in paint and steelmaking. =Treatment= The current mainstay of manganism treatment is levodopa and chelation with EDTA. Both have limited and at best transient efficacy. Replenishing the deficit of dopamine with levodopa has been shown to initially improve extrapyramidal symptoms,Mena I, Court J, Fuenzalida S, Papavasiliou PS, Cotzias GC. Modification of chronic manganese poisoning. Treatment with Ldopa or 5-OH tryptophane. New Engl. J. Med. 1970; 282(1) 5-10. but the response to treatment goes down after 2 or 3 years, with worsening condition of the same patients noted even after 10 years since last exposure to manganese. Enhanced excretion of manganese prompted by chelation therapy brings its blood levels down but the symptoms remain largely unchanged, raising questions about efficacy of this form of treatment. Increased ferroportin protein expression in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells is associated with decreased intracellular Mn concentration and attenuated cytotoxicity, characterized by the reversal of Mn-reduced glutamate uptake and diminished lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage. =Locations= The Red River Delta near Hanoi has high levels of manganese or arsenic in the water. Approximately 65 percent of the region's wells contain high levels of arsenic, manganese, selenium and barium. This was also published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. =Magnesium= Magnesium is necessary for the function of many metabolic enzymes and also serves as a key regulator of calcium channels involved in neurotransmission (e.g. NMDA receptor).Nowak, L., Bregestovski, P., Ascher, P., Herbet, A., & Prochiantz, A. (1984). Magnesium gates glutamate-activated channels in mouse central neurones. Magnesium supplementation facilitates nerve regeneration after injury. Although unpolished grains contain magnesium, phytic acid in grains can inhibit its absorption. Leafy greens are an excellent source of magnesium.FDA DRI Report on Magnesium http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/DRI//DRI_Calcium/190-249.pdf Vitamins Deficiency or excess intake of many vitamins can affect the brain contributing to developmentalMcCann, J. C., & Ames, B. N. (2010). 24 Evidence Required for Causal Inferences about Effects of Micronutrient Deficiencies during Development on Brain Health. Micronutrients and Brain Health, 355. and degenerative diseases. =Vitamin A= Vitamin A is an essential nutrient for mammals which takes form in either retinol or the provitamin beta-Carotene. It helps regulation of cell division, cell function, genetic regulation, helps enhance the immune system, and is required for brain function, chemical balance, growth and development of the central nervous system and vision. Learning memory In an experiment by Chongqing Medical University pregnant rats were either plentiful in vitamin A or were of a vitamin A deficiency (VAD) due to their diet. The offspring of these rats were then tested in a water maze at 8 weeks old and it was found the VAD offspring had a harder time finishing the maze which helps show that these rats, even while having a deficiency from in utero, have more problems with learning memory. Young rats in a separate study by the same university also showed impaired long-term potentiation in the hippocampus when they were VAD which shows neuronal impairment. When the patient is VAD for too long, the effects of the damage to the hippocampus can be irreversible. Spatial memory Vitamin A affects spatial memory most of the time because the size of the nuclei in hippocampal neurons are reduced by approximately 70% when there is a deficiency which affects a person's abilities for higher cognitive function. In a study by the University of Cagliari, Italy, VAD rats had more trouble learning a Radial arm maze than rats who had normal levels of the vitamin. The healthy rats were able to correctly solve the maze within the 15-day training period and other rats that were once deficient but had vitamin A restored to normal levels were also able to solve it. Here it was found that the retinoid receptors which help transport vitamin A were of normal function. Prevention, treatment and symptoms Eating foods high in vitamin A or taking dietary supplements, retinol or retinal will prevent a deficiency. The foods highest in vitamin A are any pigmented fruits and vegetables and leafy green vegetables also provide beta-Carotene. There can be symptoms of fat loss and a reduction of any weight gain that would be considered normal for an individual, especially developmental weight gains such as in infants which would occur if the infant was deprived of vitamin A in utero and/or if it was deprived postnatal for an extensive period of time. The deficiency can also cause conditions such as blindness or night blindness, also known as nyctalopia. Night blindness is due to the inability to regenerate rhodopsin in the rods which is needed in dim light in order to see properly. A treatment of supplements of retinoic acid which is a part of vitamin A can help replenish levels and help bring learning to normal, but after 39 weeks this is ineffective even if the treatment is daily because it will not bring the retinoid hypo-signalling back to normal. Relationship with zinc Zinc is needed to maintain normal vitamin A levels in blood plasma. It also helps vitamin A become metabolized by the liver. However evidence suggests that when someone is deficient in both vitamin A and zinc, memory is more improved when just vitamin A is increased than when just zinc is increased. Of course memory has the largest improvement when both are increased. When one of these nutrients is not balanced, the other is most likely to be affected because they rely on each other for proper functioning in learning. =Thiamin (vitamin B1)= Vitamin B1, also known as thiamine, is a coenzyme essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates. This vitamin is important for the facilitation of glucose use, thus ensuring the production of energy for the brain, and normal functioning of the nervous system, muscles, and heart. Thiamine is found in all living tissues, and is uniformly distributed throughout mammalian nervous tissue, including the brain and spinal cord. Metabolism and coenzyme function of the vitamin suggest a distinctive function for thiamin within the nervous system. The brain retains its thiamine content in the face of a vitamin-deficient diet with great tenacity, as it is the last of all nervous tissues studied to become depleted. A 50% reduction of thiamine stores in rats becomes apparent after only 4 days of being put on a thiamine- deficient diet. However, polyneuritic signs do not begin to appear until about 4 or 5 weeks have passed. Similar results have been found in human subjects. Deficiencies The body has only small stores of B1; accordingly, there is risk of deficiency if the level of intake is reduced only for a few weeks. Thiamin deficiency during critical periods of early development can disrupts neurogenesis in animal models. Lack of thiamin later in life causes the disease known as beriberi. There are two forms of beriberi: \\"wet\\", and \\"dry\\". Dry beriberi is also known as cerebral beriberi. Characteristics of wet beriberi include prominent edema and cardiac involvement, whereas dry beriberi is mainly characterized by a polyneuritis. Severe thiamin deficiency can also result in acute neurodegeneration leading to peripheral neuropathy and memory loss. In industrialized nations, thiamine deficiency is a clinically significant problem in individuals with chronic alcoholism or other disorders that interfere with normal ingestion of food. Thiamine deficiency within developed nations tends to manifest as Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome. Chronic alcoholism can disrupt thiamin absorption and thiamin deficiency contributes to neurodegeneration and memory loss in alcoholics known as Wernicke's encephalopathy. Individuals with chronic alcoholism may fall short on minimum daily requirements of thiamine in part due to anorexia, erratic eating habits, lack of available food, or a combination of any of these factors. Thiamine deficiency has been reported in up to 80% of alcoholic patients due to inadequate nutritional intake, reduced absorption, and impaired utilization of thiamine. Alcohol, in combination with its metabolite acetaldehyde, interacts with thiamine utilization at the molecular level during transport, diphosphorylation, and modification processes. For this reason, chronic alcoholics may have insufficient thiamine for maintenance of normal brain function, even with seemingly adequate dietary intake. Symptoms Clinical signs of B1 deficiency include mental changes such as apathy, decrease in short-term memory, confusion, and irritability. Moderate deficiency in thiamine may reduce growth in young populations, in increase chronic illness in both young and middle-aged adults. In addition, moderate deficiency of thiamine may increase rates of depression, dementia, falls, and fractures in old age. The lingering symptoms of neuropathy associated with cerebral beriberi are known as Korsakoff's syndrome, or the chronic phase of Wernicke-Korsakoff's. Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder resulting from a deficiency in thiamine, sharing the same predominant features of cerebral beriberi, as characterized by ocular abnormalities, ataxia of gait, a global state of confusion, and neuropathy. The state of confusion associated with Wernicke's may consist of apathy, inattention, spatial disorientation, inability to concentrate, and mental sluggishness or restlessness. Clinical diagnosis of Wernicke's disease cannot be made without evidence of ocular disturbance, yet these criteria may be too rigid. Korsakoff's likely represents a variation in the clinical manifestation of Wernicke encephalophathy, as they both share similar pathological origin. Korsakoff's syndrome is often characterized by confabulation, disorientation, and profound amnesia. Characteristics of the neuropathology are varied, but generally consist of bilaterally symmetrical midline lesions of brainstem areas, including the mammillary bodies, thalamus, periaqueductal region, hypothalamus, and the cerebellar vermis. Treatment Immediate treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy involves the administration of intravenous thiamine, followed with long-term treatment and prevention of the disorder through oral thiamine supplements, alcohol abstinence, and a balanced diet. Improvements in brain functioning of chronic alcoholics may occur with abstinence-related treatment, involving the discontinuation of alcohol consumption and improved nutrition. Wernicke's encephalopathy is life- threatening if left untreated. However, a rapid reversal of symptoms may result from prompt administration of thiamine. Prevention Fortification of flour is practiced in some countries to replace the thiamine lost during processing. However, this method has been criticized for missing the target population of chronic alcoholics, who are most at risk for deficiency. Alternative solutions have suggested the fortification of alcoholic beverages with thiamine. Ingesting a diet rich in thiamine may stave off the adverse effects of deficiency. Foods providing rich sources of thiamine include unrefined grain products, ready-to-eat cereals, meat (especially pork), dairy products, peanuts, legumes, fruits and eggs. =Niacin (vitamin B3)= Vitamin B3, also known as niacin, includes both nicotinamide as well as nicotinic acid, both of which function in many biological oxidization and reduction reactions within the body. These functions include the biochemical degradation of carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Niacin is also involved in the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, which are known mediators of brain biochemistry, and in effect, of cognitive function. Sufficient niacin intake is either obtained from diet, or synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. Deficiencies Pellagra initially presents as dermatitis Severe niacin deficiency typically manifests itself as the disease pellagra. Synthesis of B3 from tryptophan involves vitamin B2 and B6, so deficiencies in either of these nutrients can lead to niacin deficiency. An excess of leucine, an essential amino acid, in the diet can also interfere with tryptophan conversion and subsequently result in a B3 deficiency. Pellagra is most common to populations within developing countries in which corn is the dietary staple. The disease has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries, yet still appears in India and parts of China and Africa. This is in part due to the bound form of niacin that unprocessed corn contains, which is not readily absorbed into the human body. The processes involved in making corn tortillas, can release the bound niacin into a more absorbable form. Pellagra is not problematic in countries which traditionally prepare their corn in this way, but is a problem in other countries where unprocessed corn is main source of caloric intake. Though pellagra predominantly occurs in developing countries, sporadic cases of pellagra may be observed within industrialized nations, primarily in chronic alcoholics and patients living with functional absorption complications. Symptoms Pellagra is classically characterized by four 4 \\"D's\\": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. Neuropsychiatric manifestations of pellagra include headache, irritability, poor concentration, anxiety, hallucinations, stupor, apathy, psychomotor unrest, photophobia, tremor, ataxia, spastic paresis, fatigue, and depression. Symptoms of fatigue and insomnia may progress to encephalopathy characterized by confusion, memory loss, and psychosis. Those afflicted with pellagra may undergo pathological alterations in the nervous system. Findings may include demylenation and degeneration of various affected parts of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. Treatment Prognosis of deficiency is excellent with treatment. Without, pellagra will gradually progress and lead to death within 4–5 years, often a result of malnutrition from prolonged diarrhea, or complications as caused by concurrent infections or neurological symptoms. Symptoms of pellagra can be cured with exogenous administration of nicotinic acid or nicotinamide. Flushing occurs in many patients treated therapeutically with nicotinic acid, and as a result, nicotinamide holds more clinical value as it is not associated with the same uncomfortable flushing. The adult dose of nicotinamide is 100 mg taken orally every 6 hours until resolution of major acute symptoms, followed with oral administration of 50 mg every 8–12 hours until skin lesions heal. For children, treatment involves oral ingestion of 10–15 mg of nicotinamide, depending on weight, every 6 hours until signs and symptoms are resolved. Severe cases require 1 gram every 3–4 hours, administered parenterally. Oral nicotinamide has been promoted as an over-the- counter drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Conversely, no clinically significant effect has been found for the drug, as nicotinamide administration has not been found to promote memory functions in patients with mild to moderate dementia of either Alzheimer's, vascular, or fronto-temporal types. This evidence suggests that nicotinamide may treat dementia as related to pellagra, but administration does not effectively treat other types of dementia. Prevention The best method of prevention is to each food rich in B3. Generally, this involves the intake of a protein-rich diet. Foods that contain high concentrations of niacin in the free form include beans and organ meat, as well as enriched grain and cereal products. While niacin is present in corn and other grains, the bioavailability of the nutrient is much less than it is in protein-rich sources. Different methods of processing corn may result in a higher degree of bioavailability of the vitamin. Though treatment with niacin does little to alter the effects of Alzheimer's dementia, niacin intake from foods is inversely associated with the disease. =Folate (vitamin B9)= Folate deficiency can disrupt neurulation and neurogenesis. Maternal folic acid intake around the time of conception prevents neural tube defects. Furthermore, folic acid intake was recently associated with incidence of autism. Enriched white flour is fortified with folic acid in the United States and many other countries. However the European Union does not have mandatory folic acid fortification. Although the protective effects of folic acid are well documented, there remains legitimate concern that fortification could lead to toxic levels in a subset of the population. For example, elevated levels of folic acid can interact with vitamin B12 deficiency to cause neurodegeneration. Furthermore, folic acid and iron can interact to exacerbate malaria. Folic acid is the most oxidized and stable form of folate, and can also be referred to as vitamin B9. It rarely occurs naturally in foods, but it is the form used in vitamin supplements as well as fortified food products. Folate coenzymes are involved in numerous conversion processes within the body, including DNA synthesis and amino acid interconversions. Folate and vitamin B12 play a vital role in the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine, which is of key importance in the maintenance and repairment of all cells, including neurons. In addition, folate has been linked to the maintenance of adequate brain levels of cofactors necessary for chemicals reactions that lead to the synthesis of serotonin and catecholamine neurotransmitters. Folate has a major, but indirect role in activities which help to direct gene expression and cell proliferation. These activities occur at a greatly increased rate during pregnancy, and depend on adequate levels of folate within blood plasma. Concentrations of blood plasma folate and homocysteine concentrations are inversely related, such that an increase in dietary folate decreases homocysteine concentration. Thus, dietary intake of folate is a major determinant of homocysteine levels within the body. Autoantibodies against folate receptor alpha have been found in up to 75% of children with autism. Deficiencies Folate deficiency most commonly arises from insufficient folate intake from the diet, but may also stem from inefficient absorption or metabolic utilization of folate, usually a result of genetic variation. The relationship between folate and B12 is so interdependent that deficiency in either vitamin can result in megaloblastic anemia, characterized by organic mental change. The process of neural tube transformation into structures that will eventually develop into the central nervous system is known as neurulation, the success of which is dependent on the presence of folate within the body. This process begins in the human approximately 21 days after conception, and is completed by 28 days. Thus, a woman may not even be aware of her pregnancy by the time the process of neurulation is complete, potentially causing severe consequences in the development of the fetus. Functional problems in the absorption and utilization of vitamins may also play a role in folate deficiencies within the elderly. Symptoms Anencephaly is the most common presentation of neural tube defects The link between levels of folate and altered mental function is not large, but is sufficient enough to suggest a causal association. Deficiency in folate can cause an elevation of homocysteine within the blood, as the clearance of homocysteine requires enzymatic action dependent on folate, and to a lesser extent, vitamins B6 and B12. Elevated homocysteine has been associated with increased risk of vascular events, as well as dementia. Differences lie in the presentation of megaloblastic anemia induced by either folate or B12 deficiency. Megaloblastic anemia related to deficiency in B12 generally results in peripheral neuropathy, whereas folate- related anemia often results in affective, or mood disorders. Neurological effects are not often associated with folate-related megaloblastic anemia, although demyelinating disorders may eventually present. In one study, mood disturbances were recorded for the majority of patients presenting with megaloblastic anemia in the absence of B12 deficiency. In addition, folate concentrations within blood plasma have been found to be lower in patients with both unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders when compared with control groups. In addition, depressive groups with low folate concentrations responded less well to standard antidepressant therapy than did those with normal levels within plasma. However, replication of these findings are less robust. The role of folic acid during pregnancy is vital to normal development of the nervous system in the fetus. A deficiency in folate levels of a pregnant woman could potentially result in neural tube disorder, a debilitating condition in which the tubes of the central nervous system do not fuse entirely. NTDs are not to be confused with spina bifida, which does not involve neural elements. Neural tube defects can present in a number of ways as a result of the improper closure at various points of the neural tube. The clinical spectrum of the disorder includes encephalocele, craniorachischisis, and anencephaly. In addition, these defects can also be classified as open, if neural tissue is exposed or covered only by membrane, or can be classified as closed, if the tissue is covered by normal skin. Intake of the vitamin has been linked to deficits in learning and memory, particularly within the elderly population. Elderly people deficient in folate may present with deficits in free recall and recognition, which suggests that levels of folate may be related to efficacy of episodic memory. Treatment Lack of adequate folate may produce a form of dementia considered to be reversible with administration of the vitamin. Indeed, there is a degree of improvement in memory associated with folate treatment. In a 3-year longitudinal study of men and women aged 50–70 years with elevated homocysteine plasma concentration, researchers found that a daily oral folic acid supplementation of 800μg resulted in an increase in folate levels and a decrease in homocysteine levels within blood plasma. In addition to these results, improvements of memory, and information-processing speed, as well as slight improvements of sensorimotor speed were observed, which suggests there is a link between homocysteine and cognitive performance. However, while the amount of cognitive improvement after treatment with folate is correlated with the severity of folate deficiency, the severity of cognitive decline is independent of the severity of folate deficiency. This suggests that the dementia observed may not be entirely related to levels of folate, as there could be additional factors that were not accounted for which might have an effect. Prevention Because neurulation may be completed before pregnancy is recognized, it is recommended that women capable of becoming pregnant take about 400μg of folic acid from fortified foods, supplements, or a combination of the two in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. These major anomalies in the nervous system can be reduced by 85% with systematic folate supplementation occurring before the onset of pregnancy. The incidence of Alzheimer's and other cognitive diseases has been loosely connected to deficiencies in folate. It is recommended for the elderly to consume folate through food, fortified or not, and supplements in order to reduce risk of developing the disease. Good sources of folate include liver, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals, beans, asparagus, spinach, broccoli, and orange juice. =Choline= Choline is an important methyl donor involved in one-carbon metabolism that also becomes incorporated into phospholipids and the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Because of its role in cellular synthesis, choline is an important nutrient during the prenatal and early postnatal development of offspring as it contributes heavily to the development of the brain. A study found that rats that were given supplements of choline in utero or in the weeks following birth had superior memories. The changes appeared to be a result of physical changes to the hippocampus, the area of the brain responsible for memory. Furthermore, choline can reduce some of the deleterious effects of folate deficiency on neurogenesis. While choline during development is important, adult levels of choline are also important. Choline has been shown to increase the synthesis and release of acetylcholine from neurons, which in turn increases memory. A double-blind study was conducted using normal college students (no neurological disorders). Results showed that twenty-five grams of phosphatidylcholine (another form of choline) created a significant improvement in explicit memory, measured by a serial learning task, however this improvement may be attributed to the improvement of slow learners. Another study found that a single ten-gram oral dose of choline, given to normal volunteers (again, without neurological disorders) significantly decreased the number of trials needed to master a serial- learning word test. This increase in memory is particularly beneficial to memory loss suffered by old age. A study conducted on rats who, like humans, suffer from an age-related loss of memory were tested on how choline affected memory. The results showed that rats who had a chronic low-choline diet showed greater memory loss then their same-age control counterparts, while rats who had choline-enriched diets showed a diminished memory loss compared to both the choline-low diet and control rat groups. Furthermore, young rats who were choline-deficient performed as poorly on memory tasks as older rats while older rats that were given choline supplements performed as well as three- month-old rats. Deficiencies and treatments Despite the wide range of foods that choline is found in, studies have shown that the mean choline intake of men, women and children are below the Adequate Intake levels. It is important to note that not enough choline is naturally produced by the body, so diet is an important factor. People who consume a large quantity of alcohol may be at an increased risk for choline deficiency. Sex and age also plays a role, with premenopausal females being less sensitive to choline deficiency than either males or postmenopausal females. This has been theorized to be a result of premenopausal women having an increased ability to synthesize choline in some form, which has been confirmed in studies on rats. In such instances of deficiency, choline supplements or (if able) dietary changes may be beneficial. Good sources of choline include liver, milk, eggs and peanuts. There is further evidence to suggest that choline supplements can be used to treat people who suffer from neurological disorders as well we memory defects. Oral doses of CDP-choline (another form of choline) given to elderly subjects with memory deficits, but without dementia, for four weeks showed improved memory in free recall tasks, but not in recognition tests. In a second study, patients with early Alzheimer-type dementia were treated with twenty-give gram doses of phosphatidylcholine every day for six months. Slightly improvements were shown in memory tests compared to the placebo control group. Other studies conducted did not find any such improvement. =Cobalamin (vitamin B12)= Also known as cobalamin, B12 is an essential vitamin necessary for normal blood formation. It is also important for the maintenance of neurological function and psychiatric health. The absorption of B12 into the body requires adequate amounts of intrinsic factor, the glycoprotein produced in the parietal cells of the stomach lining. A functioning small intestine is also necessary for the proper metabolism of the vitamin, as absorption occurs within the ileum. B12 is produced in the digestive tracts of all animals, including humans. Thus, animal-origin food is the only natural food source of vitamin B12 However, synthesis of B12 occurs in the large intestine, which is past the point of absorption that occurs within the small intestine. As such, vitamin B12 must be obtained through diet. Deficiencies Unlike other B vitamins which are not stored in the body, B12 is stored in the liver. Because of this, it may take 5–10 years before a sudden dietary B12 deficiency will become apparent in a previously healthy adult. B12 deficiency, also known as hypocobalaminemia, often results from complications involving absorption into the body. B12 deficiency is often associated with pernicious anemia, as it is the most common cause. Pernicious anemia results from an autoimmune disorder which destroys the cells that produce intrinsic factor within the stomach lining, thereby hindering B12 absorption. B12 absorption is important for the subsequent absorption of iron, thus, people with pernicious anemia often present with typical symptoms of anemia, such as pale skin, dizziness, and fatigue. Among those at highest risk for B12 deficiency are the elderly population, as 10-15% of people aged 60+ may present with some form of hypocobalaminemia. High rates of deficiency in the elderly commonly results from the decrease of functional absorption of B12, as production of intrinsic factor declines with age. However, pernicious anemia is the most common cause of B12 deficiency in North American and European populations. Those afflicted with various gastrointestinal diseases may also be at risk for deficiency as a result of malabsorption. These diseases may affect production of intrinsic factor in the stomach, or of pancreatic bile. Diseases that involve disorders of the small intestine, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease and ileitis, may also reduce B12 absorption. For example, people with celiac disease may damage the microvilli within their small intestines through the consumption of gluten, thereby inhibiting absorption of B12 as well as other nutrients. A diet low in B12, whether voluntary or not, can also cause symptoms of hypocobalaminemia. Many rich sources of B12 come from animal meats and by- products. Populations in developing countries may not have access to these foods on a consistent basis, and as a result may become deficient in B12. In addition, vegans, and to a lesser extent vegetarians, are at risk for consuming a diet low in cobalamin as they voluntarily abstain from animal sources of B12. A combination of these two scenarios may increase prevalence of cobalamin deficit. For instance, B12 deficiency is problematic in India, where the majority of the population is vegetarian and the scarcity of meat consumption is common for omnivores as well. Symptoms An assortment of neurological effects can be observed in 75-90% of individuals of any age with clinically observable B12 deficiency. Cobalamin deficiency manifestations are apparent in the abnormalities of the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, optic nerves, and cerebrum. These abnormalities involve a progressive degeneration of myelin, and may be expressed behaviourally through reports of sensory disturbances in the extremities, or motor disturbances, such as gait ataxia. Combined myelopathy and neuropathy are prevalent within a large percentage of cases. Cognitive changes may range from loss of concentration to memory loss, disorientation, and dementia. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mental symptoms are extremely variable, and include mild disorders of mood, mental slowness, and memory defect. Memory defect encompasses symptoms of confusion, severe agitation and depression, delusions and paranoid behaviour, visual and auditory hallucinations, urinary and fecal incontinence in the absence of overt spinal lesions, dysphasia, violent maniacal behaviour, and epilepsy. It has been suggested that mental symptoms could be related to a decrease in cerebral metabolism, as caused by the state of deficiency. All of these symptoms may present with or without additional mood changes. Mild to moderate cases of pernicious anemia may show symptoms of bleeding gums, headache, poor concentration, shortness of breath, and weakness. In severe cases of pernicious anemia, individuals may present with various cognitive problems such as dementia, and memory loss. It is not always easy to determine whether B12 deficiency is present, especially within older adults. Patients may present with violent behaviour or more subtle personality changes. They may also present with vague complaints, such as fatigue or memory loss, that may be attributed to normative aging processes. Cognitive symptoms may mimic behaviour in Alzheimer's and other dementias as well. Tests must be run on individuals presenting with such signs to confirm or negate cobalamin deficiency within the blood. Treatment Individuals with absorption disorders, or those who abstain from animal products should supplement their diet with B12 regularly Patients deficient in B12 despite normal absorption functionality may be treated through oral administration of at least 6 mg of the vitamin in pill form. Patients who suffer from irreversible causes of deficiency, such as pernicious anemia or old age, will need lifelong treatment with pharmacological doses of B12. Strategy for treatment is dependent on the patient's level of deficiency as well as their level of cognitive functioning. Treatment for those with severe deficiency involves 1000 mg of B12 administered intramuscularly daily for one week, weekly for one month, then monthly for the rest of the patient's life. Daily oral supplementation of B12 mega-doses may be sufficient in reliable patients, but it is imperative that the supplementation be continued on a lifelong basis as relapse may occur otherwise. The progression of neurological manifestations of cobalamin deficiency is generally gradual. As a result, early diagnosis is important or else irreversible damage may occur. Patients who become demented usually show little to no cognitive improvement with the administration of B12. A deficiency in folate may produce anemia similar to the anemia resulting from B12 deficiency. There is risk that folic acid administered to those with B12 deficiency may mask anemic symptoms without solving the issue at hand. In this case, patients would still be at risk for neurological deficits associated with B12 deficiency-related anemia, which are not associated with anemia related to folate deficiency. Prevention In addition to meeting intake requirements through food consumption, supplementation of diet with vitamin B12 is seen as a viable preventative measure for deficiency. It has been recommended for the elderly to supplement 50 mcg a day in order to prevent deficit from occurring. Animal protein products are a good source of B12, particularly organ meats such as kidney or liver. Other good sources are fish, eggs, and dairy products. It is suggested that vegans, who consume no animal meat or by-products, supplement their diet with B12. While there are foods fortified with B12 available, some may be mislabelled in an attempt to boost their nutritional claims. Products of fermentation, such as algae extracts and sea vegetables, may be labelled as sources of B12, but actually contain B12 analogues which compete for the absorption of the nutrient itself. In order to get adequate amounts of the vitamin, orally administered pills or fortified foods such as cereals and soy milk, are recommended for vegans. =Vitamin D= Vitamin D is an essential regulator of the vitamin D receptor that controls gene transcription during development. The vitamin D receptor is strongly expressed in the substantia nigra. Accordingly, vitamin D deficiency can disrupt neurogenesis leading to altered dopamine signaling and increased exploratory behavior in rats. This is considered a rodent model of the schizophrenia phenotype and vitamin D deficiency has been proposed as an explanation for the increased incidence of schizophrenia among children that were conceived during winter months. A Finnish study found that vitamin D supplement use is associated with reduced risk of schizophrenia. Lipids =Fat= Fatty acids are necessary for the synthesis of cell membranes neurotransmitters and other signaling molecules. While excessive fat intake can be harmful, deficiency of essential fatty acids can disrupt neurodevelopment and synaptic plasticity. Saturated fat Consuming large amounts of saturated fat can negatively affect the brain. Eating foods with saturated fats elevates the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in the body. Studies have shown that high levels of triglycerides strongly link with mood problems such as depression, hostility and aggression. This may occur because high triglyceride levels decrease the amount of oxygen that blood can carry to the brain. The American Heart Association recommends that people consume no more than 16g of saturated fat daily. Common sources of saturated fat are meat and dairy products. Essential fatty acids There are two kinds of essential fatty acids that people must consume (omega-3 and omega-6). Many academics recommend a balanced amount of omega-3s and omega-6s. However, some estimate that Americans consume twenty times more omega-6s than omega-3s. There is a theory that an imbalance of essential fatty acids may lead to mental disorders such as depression, hyperactivity and schizophrenia, but it still lacking evidences. An omega-3 deficient diet increases omega-6 levels in the brain disrupting endocannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens contributing to anxiety and depression-like behaviors in mice. Sources of omega-3 include flax seeds, chia seeds, walnuts, sea vegetables, green leafy vegetables, and cold water fish. Sources of omega-6 include walnuts, hazelnuts; sunflower, safflower, corn, and sesame oils. =Cholesterol= While cholesterol is essential for membranes and steroid hormones, excess cholesterol affects blood flow impairing cognitive function in vascular dementia. Carbohydrates Studies have shown that learning and memory improve after consuming carbohydrates. There are two kinds of carbohydrates people consume: simple and complex. Simple carbohydrates are often found in processed foods and release sugar into the bloodstream quickly after consumption. Complex carbohydrates are digested more slowly and therefore cause sugar to be released into the bloodstream more slowly. Good sources of complex carbohydrates are whole-grain breads, pasta, brown rice, oatmeal, and potatoes. It is recommended that people consume more complex carbohydrates because consuming complex carbohydrates will cause the level of sugar in the bloodstream to be more stable, which will cause less stress hormones to be released. Consuming simple carbohydrates may cause the levels of sugar in the bloodstream to rise and fall, which can cause mood swings. =Low carbohydrate ketogenic diets= The ketone body beta-hydroxybutyrate is a fuel source for the brain during times of fasting when blood glucose levels fall. Although the mechanism is not understood, it is well established that eating a diet low in carbohydrates can be therapeutic for children with epilepsy. This is likely a result of ketone bodies providing an alternative fuel source to glucose for neuronal function. Furthermore, a ketogenic diet can be beneficial for dementia patients. Medium-chain triglycerides can stimulate ketone synthesis and coconut oil is a rich source of medium chain triglycerides that several anecdotal reports suggest can improve cognitive function in Alzheimer's type dementia patients. Protein When protein is consumed, it is broken down into amino acids. These amino acids are used to produce many things like neurotransmitters, enzymes, hormones, and chromosomes. Proteins known as complete proteins contain all eight of the essential amino acids. Meat, cheese, eggs, and yogurt are all examples of complete proteins. Incomplete proteins contain only some of the eight essential amino acids and it is recommended that people consume a combination of these proteins. Examples of incomplete proteins include nuts, seeds, legumes, and grains. When animals are fed a diet deficient in essential amino acids, uncharged tRNAs accumulate in the anterior piriform cortex signaling diet rejection [105]. The body normally interconverts amino acids to maintain homeostasis, but muscle protein can be catabolized to release amino acids during conditions of amino acid deficiency. Disruption of amino acid metabolism can affect brain development and neurophysiology to affect behavior. For example, fetal protein deficiency decreases the number of neurons in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. =Glutamate= Glutamate is a proteinogenic amino acid and neurotransmitter, though it is perhaps publicly best known in its sodium salt form: monosodium glutamate (MSG). It is also a flavor on its own, producing the umami or savory flavor found in many fermented foods such as cheese. As an amino acid it acts as a source of fuel for various cellular functions and as a neurotransmitter. Glutamate operates as an excitatory neurotransmitter and is released when a nerve impulse excites a glutamate producing cell. This in turn binds to neurons with glutamate receptors, stimulating them. Deficiencies and treatments Glutamate is a nutrient that is extremely difficult to be deficient in, as, being an amino acid, it is found in every food that contains protein. Additionally it is found, as previously mentioned, in fermented foods and in foods containing monosodium glutamate. As such, good sources of glutamate include meat, fish, dairy products and a wide array of other foods. Glutamate is also absorbed extremely efficiently by the intestines. However, there are instances of glutamate deficiency occurring, but only in cases where genetic disorders are present. One such example is Glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency and can cause either minor or profound physical and intellectual disabilities, depending on the severity of the condition. This disorder is extremely rare however, as only twenty people have so far been identified with this condition.http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/glutamate-formiminotransferase- deficiency Glutamate, while critically important in the body also acts as an excitotoxin in high concentrations not normally found outside of laboratory conditions, although it can occur following brain injury or spinal cord injury. =Phenylalanine= L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids, and beta- phenethylamine. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenethylamine is further converted into N-methylphenethylamine. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier, and, in large quantities, interferes with the production of serotonin. Phenylketonuria Toxic levels of phenylalanine accumulate in the brains of patients with phenylketonuria leading to severe brain damage and mental retardation. To prevent brain damage, these individuals can restrict dietary phenylalanine intake by avoiding protein and supplementing their diet with essential amino acids.

In May 2011 she won the Orwell Prize for Political Journalism, having been shortlisted for the Commentariat of the Year at the 2010 Comment Awards.https://web.archive.org/web/20111005203737/http://www.editorialintelligence.com/special- events_17_1461087199.pdf She was described as \\"the stand-out journalist in an outstanding field\\". The judges commented: \\"Her empathy for the world beyond Westminster gives her writing an extra dimension often lacking in political insiders. There is an overriding humanity to her work, whether she is covering the death-throes of the last Labour government or the birth-pangs of the Coalition.\\" She wrote the Monday political column for the London Evening Standard for two years, from 2011 to 2013, and was shortlisted for the inaugural Hatchet Job of the Year Award in 2012 for her work on as a book reviewer in The Sunday Times. In 2013, she became a member of the independent expert panel advising the Government on the initiation and publication of Serious Case Reviews, and in August that year began writing a column on Thursdays for The Times. At the 2015 Comment Awards she was named Society & Diversity Commentator of the Year. In March 2015, she profiled the Prime Minister, David Cameron, for The Times on the eve of the UK general election, and in April 2016 she profiled the US Ambassador to the UK, Matthew Barzun, also for The Times. In June 2016, she once again interviewed Prime Minister Cameron for The Times Magazine, this time ahead of the EU referendum. In 2017, Russell started writing for the New York Times as a contributing opinion writer. In 2020, she was long-listed for the Orwell Prize. Russell regularly appears on television and radio, on BBC's Newsnight and Sky News.
