It is operated by the Hopkins County Historical Society. The Hopkins County Museum is located in the George H. Wilson house, which was built in 1910. The house itself is noted for its unique architectural features, including carved columns, a roof made of pressed tin, double-bricked walls, and a Regency-style domed ceiling. All of the building's ceilings are original except one that is from a former local opera house. Its collections include Caddo artifacts, Civil War memorabilia, a doll collection, folk art, Paleolithic fossils, and period women's clothing. The museum also displays a crystal chandelier from Maximilian I's palace in Mexico City. Items that it exhibits have been donated by families living in Hopkins County. The Heritage Park consists of of historic houses and other buildings that have been moved to the site. In 2013, there were a total of 11 historic buildings in the Heritage Park, most of which date to the 19th century and have been restored. They include a working blacksmith shop, a chapel, a country store, farmhouses, a gristmill, log houses, and a print shop. The Atkins House, the oldest brick building in the county, is also included. According to the Hopkins County Museum and Heritage Park, the Heritage Park endeavors to replicate \\"small town Texas around the turn of the century\\". Sandra Ramani describes it, together with the Museum, as a \\"capsule of county history\\". The Hopkins County Museum and Heritage Park have also held numerous special events, including a Folk Festival in May and Indian Summer in October. Indian Summer days includes a Dutch oven cooking contest as well as archaeological digs, candle dipping, Native American dance and storytelling, and exhibitions of blacksmithing, butter churning, and gristmilling. The Museum and Heritage Park also host a 19th-century-style Christmas celebration, as well as arts and crafts festivals and bluegrass concerts. According to the Texas Historical Commission, the Museum and Heritage Park are considered historic sites along the former Bankhead Highway.

Then he served as commentator in the London, England radio studios of BBC and CBS. Returning to Princeton, for two years he taught in the School of Public and International Affairs. He became an editor of Public Opinion Quarterly and conducted opinion polls in Brazil. In the war against Hitler, Free joined the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service. He counted references to specific military units mentioned in propaganda broadcasts and made accurate inferences about enemy offensive movements. After the war he assisted UNESCO in their communication operations before continuing similarly with the State Department. On February 11, 1946, he married Elsbeth Studer. He and Hadley Cantril established the Institute for International Social Research.

It breeds on the Balearic Islands, Corsica and Sardinia, and is migratory, wintering in Africa. The International Ornithologists' Union has split the species from the spotted flycatcher, but other taxonomic authorities considered it still conspecific. This is an undistinguished looking bird with long wings and tail. The adults have grey- brown upperparts and whitish underparts, with a streaked crown and breast. The legs are short and black, and the bill is black and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. Juveniles are browner than adults and have spots on the upperparts. Taxonomy The first formal description of the Mediterranean flycatcher was by Guido Schiebel in 1910 who considered it as a subspecies of the spotted flycatcher and gave it the trinomial name Muscicapa striata tyrrhenica. A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2016 found that the subspecies M. s. tyrrhenica and M. s. balearica were genetically similar to each other but significantly different from the other spotted flycatcher subspecies. The authors proposed that these insular subspecies should be considered as a separate species. There are two recognised subspecies which both winter in southern Africa. The breeding range is given below. * M. t. balearica von Jordans, 1913 ‚Äì Balearic Islands * M. t. tyrrhenica Schiebel, 1910 ‚Äì Corsica and Sardinia Description The Mediterranean flycatcher is a small slim bird, around in length, with a weight of . It has dull grey-brown upperparts and off-white underparts. The crown, throat and breast are streaked with brown while the wings and tail feathers are edged with paler thin margins. The subspecies M. t. tyrrhenica has paler and warmer plumage on the upperparts, with more diffuse markings on the head and breast. The sexes are alike. Juveniles have ochre-buff spots above and scaly brown spots below. Behaviour and ecology Mediterranean flycatchers hunt from conspicuous perches, making sallies after passing flying insects, and often returning to the same perch. Their upright posture is characteristic. Most passerines moult their primary flight feathers in sequence beginning near the body and proceeding outwards along the wing. The Mediterranean flycatcher is unusual in replacing the outer flight feathers before those nearer the body. The flycatcher's call is a thin, drawn out soft and high pitched ', slightly descending in pitch. They are birds of deciduous woodlands, parks and gardens, with a preference for open areas amongst trees.

Initially adopted by the University of Chicago following a report issued by a designated Committee on Freedom of Expression in 2014 (‚Ä≥Report of the Committee on Freedom of Expression‚Ä≥), they came to be known as the ‚ÄúChicago principles‚Äù after the university engaged FIRE to lead a campaign to encourage other universities across the country sign up to the principles or model their own based on similar goals. Since 2014, several other universities have committed to the principles, including Princeton, Purdue, and Washington University in St. Louis. As of April 2020, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) reported that 72 U.S. colleges and universities had \\"adopted or endorsed the Chicago Statement or a substantially similar statement.\\"  Context and formulation  Following a series of incidents in 2014 where students at various schools sought to prevent controversial commencement speakers, the Committee on Freedom of Expression at the University of Chicago was formed and charged by the President Robert J. Zimmer and Provost Eric D. Isaacs in July 2014, to draft a statement that would articulate the University of Chicago's \\"overarching commitment to free, robust, and uninhibited debate and deliberation among all members of the University‚Äôs community.\\" Statement The report cited historical precedents by former University presidents, William Rainey Harper in 1902, Robert M. Hutchins in 1932,Hutchins defended the right of the students to invite a Communist Party member, William Z. Foster. Edward H. Levi in 1968, and Hanna Holborn Gray, who was president from 1978 to 1993. The committee returned a report which re-emphasized the school's commitment to principles of free expression as \\"an essential element of the University‚Äôs culture.\\" The report clarified that the responsibility on the part of the university community for maintaining a climate of civility and mutual respect, is not a justification to prevent \\"discussion of ideas, even if \\"some or even by most members of the University\\" find them \\"disagreeable\\", \\"offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed.\\" \\"Narrow exceptions to the general principle of freedom of expression\\" may include restrictions on \\"expression that violates the law, that falsely defames a specific individual, that constitutes a genuine threat or harassment, that unjustifiably invades substantial privacy or confidentiality interests, or that is otherwise directly incompatible with the functioning of the University. In addition, the University may reasonably regulate the time, place, and manner of expression to ensure that it does not disrupt the ordinary activities of the University.\\" The committee wrote that the University's responsibility is twofold, to \\"promote a lively and fearless freedom of debate and deliberation, but also to protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.\\" Response The University's commitment to free speech gained national media attention in August 2016, when Dean of Students John Ellison sent a letter to the incoming freshman class of 2020 affirming the free speech principles and stating that the University did not support the use of trigger warnings or safe spaces. In adopting the principles, Purdue president, Mitch Daniels later said ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt see how we could improve on the language.‚Äù While the campaign to adopt the Chicago principles has gained traction among private universities, some critics have challenged the cut-and-paste nature of the principles as discouraging active debate on university campuses. Some social reform activists argue that the campaign is a University of Chicago marketing ploy or a way to ignore student activism.

From age 15 to 16, he was a free student at the full-time ballet School in Antwerp, the Stedelijk Instituut voor Ballet. The intense training over these years at the ballet school gave him the basics he needed for his further career in Latin and ballroom dancing. His parents started a dancing school the year before he was born. At first it was a small studio that grew over the years. In 1978, they built a complex with two ballrooms and a studio.  Dance Business  After his father died in 1981, Peter Ekkart took over the business with his mother Mar and two brothers Tom and Wim. In 1998, he became the owner and added a third ballroom and an upstairs studio to the existing building. The ballrooms were divided by mobile soundproof walls, and could be transformed into one big ballroom of more than 1.000 square meters (10.500 square feet). He married his wife Ellen in 2001, who came also in the business as a full-time teacher. More and more people took lessons, and more staff was recruited. At a certain point, the school had a staff of 25 teachers in total. More than 16.000 people followed dance lessons over the last decades in the school. A very broad variety of styles were given: Latin & Ballroom of course, but also Showdance, Hip hop, Streetdance, Jazz, Zumba, Square dancing, Flamenco, Argentine Tango, Irish Dancing, Salsa, Disco Swing, and Formation dancing in different styles. The school counted 6 formation teams at one point in time, which competed successfully all over the world. Ekkart organized in this building high level dance seminars, Congresses, National Championships, International Championships and regular dance events, often accompagnied with live music. In November 2016, the school was moved to a new location in Lint. Dancing school Ekkart is to date still one of the top dance studios in Europe. During this time, Peter and Ellen were asked to start teaching in the US by three different organizations. They moved in 2017 to the US to investigate the possible options.  Dancing career  He danced in the Belgian Amateur Federation with two different partners, over a period of three years. He turned professional with the official professional organisation BuldoBuldo in 1987, and graduated as fast as the system let him, to the highest level. He received the Fellow degree (the highest degree) in the disciplines of ballroom and Latin dancing. Only four people have this degree in Belgium in both styles, and he was the youngest one ever. He started dancing with his partner and former wife and soon made it to the top in all disciplines. In total, they won seven Champion titles over their competing years from 1989 to 1991 (Latin, All round, Showdance Ballroom, and showdance Latin). They made the final in the European Professional All Round Championship in Berlin in 1988, and finished in fifth place with their tango (ninth place over ten dances). In 1991, the couple split up, and also ended their marriage. From then on, Ekkart started focusing on coaching, judging and teaching. In 2008 he made his competitive comeback with Ellen Saey, now his spouse. They started dancing after working together on the television show Sterren op de Dansvloer, the Belgian equivalent of Dancing with the Stars (US) or Strictly Come Dancing (UK). Two years later, they won all seven Belgian Professional Championships in a row, in the Ballroom style, from 2010 to 2016.  Vice World-Champion 2016  Peter & Ellen Ekkart participated in all World and European Championships from 2008, and travelled the world. They danced at the Kremlin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfprvN_ifhc in Russia, South Korea, Japan, Canada, the US, and almost all European countries. In June 2015, they were placed third at the World Professional Ballroom Championships 40+, in Cervia, Italy. One year later, they moved to second place, and became the vice-world Professional Ballroom Champions 40+. This was the first time in history that a Belgian couple had gained this title. They took lessons with top coaches all over the world: Marcus & Karen Hilton, Christopher Hawkins, Joanna Bolton, Eldar Dzafarov, Anna Sazhina, Tony & Amanda Dokman, Water Laird, and many more..... After visiting the United States in 2015, they started learning American Smooth dancing. They introduced this style for the first time in Belgian at the National Professional Belgian Congress in May 2016.  Dancing With the Stars  One of his most important work known to the public, was his involvement with the Flemish version of 'Dancing With The Stars'. VTM (Flemish Commercial television) bought the rights for this program in Belgium, and started the Flemish version of the show Sterren Op de Dansvloer in 2006. Band leader Steve Willaert and Musical Television Director Jos Van Oosterwyck asked Ekkart to be a musical advisor before the start of the first season, so they could fine-tune the music for the shows. Steve Willaert asked later Ekkart for advice on several other musical projects. Furthermore, he coordinated the marketing campaign for all the dancing schools in Belgium, together with the television company VTM. And of course he worked together with his wife Ellen, who was a professional participant at the show for 3 seasons. They made the choreographies for the celebrities for the show.  Choreographer  In the period between his two active dancing careers, Ekkart started working on choreography. He founded a formation team named Caf√© Latino. This group consisted of 25 young Latin dancers, and soon became famous in Belgium and abroad with their special style and different approach to the settled establishment of Latin formation dancing. In their competitive career, the team holds three Belgian titles to their name (1992, 1996 and 1998). They also danced in World and European Championships all over the world, and placed 13th at the World Championships in Tchechie at the top of their career. In 2006, the Belgian equivalent of Dancing with the Stars (USA) or Strictly Come Dancing (UK) started its first season, and his wife Ellen was one of the participants as a professional dancer. Together, they made the different choreographies for the show, and taught them to Sam Gooris (singer- entertainer), Herbert Flack (actor) and Nico Mattan (cyclist). Also from that period, Ekkart started teaching and coaching a group of young amateur couples, from within his dancing school.  Judging and teaching  During his professional career, Ekkart spent a lot of his time teaching people to dance. He developed a method, based on the experience his parents had built, on how to efficiently teach difficult dancing steps to groups, couples and individuals, and also how to very quickly analyse the technical shortcomings of dancers in the Latin and ballroom styles. He used this method in his dancing school. It grew to be the biggest dancing school in Belgium, with a high reputation of quality. More than 16.000 people have taken lessons in dansschool Ekkart over the years. Ekkart is also an official examiner for forming and educating dance teachers in Belgium. He has given lectures and workshops at congresses, for amateurs, professionals teachers and top dancers. Due to his vast experience in different dancing styles (ballroom, Latin, formation, and show dance) he is asked all over the world to judge competitions. He judged the World Professional Showdance Championship in Germany in 1993, and regular national and international championships in Europe, when he was not dancing. He is an official WDC (World Dance Council) judge with a license to judge all over the world. In 2015, he gave a lecture about adjudicating/judging competitions for an audience of professional judges, on how they can master the difficult job of judging objectively. He wrote the Ballroom Dance Technique Translation in Dutch and English. This work is used by Buldo to educate and graduate new dance teachers.  Television work and movies  * From age 14 to 16, he was selected together with 15 children by the Flemish actor Robert Borremans to participate in a project called Robert Borremans and the Santeboetiek Show. The Flemish National Television Station BRT (now called VRT) cast the group for a weekly program for children: The Wir War Show. A lot of experimental techniques were used in those days for the first time in Belgium, like Blue Key animation and hand puppet techniques. After two years of high ratings, the show was not prolonged due to the high costs. * In 1991, he organized the European 10 dance Championships for professionals in Belgium, which were televised by the Belgian National Television Company (TV1). He produced the show, and worked intensely together with all facets of making the program. * In 1993, Ekkart convinced the National Television Company (TV1) to broadcast the Cinderella Cup. This prestigious event was an international professional competition, the first of this kind held in Belgium. Couples from all over the world danced for a diamond trophy. This was sponsored by the Antwerp Diamond Industry. * In 2005, the television company Vitaya made a full episode of the series De job van je leven in Ekkart's dancing school. The solicitation process of a new hip hop teacher for the school was televised, together with the preparation, tests, interviews and results. * July 2005: Ekkart provided dancers for a movie directed by Robert Groslot, in cooperation with Marc Bogaerts. * 2005: VRT made a television show, Dans Mondial. Ekkart was the professional choreographer for actors Ann Ceurvels and Ronny Daelman. * From 2006 to 2011, VTM broadcast the Flemish version of Dancing with the Stars (US) or Strictly Come Dancing (UK). Together with his wife Ellen Ekkart, he made the choreography for the partners of Ellen Ekkart: Sam Gooris, Herbert Flack and Nico Mattan. * From 2007 to 2009, he coordinated dancers for a stage performance for the television show Zomerhit. He and his wife Ellen Ekkart provided dancers for national artists like Bart Peeters, Clouseau, and international artists as Sister Sledge, Kim Wilde and Melanie C from the Spice Girls. * In 2007, Humo asked Peter Ekkart to form a dance formation for Humo's pop Poll in the Sportpaleis. The whole show was televised on Canvas. * 2007: Jan Verheyen was looking for dancers for his movie Vermist, and hired dancers from Ekkart's school. * 2014: Frank Focketeyn and Karlijn Sileghem took dance lessons in preparation for the television series Tom & Harry.  Other projects  = Dancing in prison = From 2005 to 2007, the Federal Antwerp Prison asked Ekkart to give dance lessons in the prison to the inmates, and to choreograph a show with the inmates. = Walter Van Beirendonck = In July 1997, Walter Van Beirendonck, the famous Belgian fashion designer of the Antwerp Six, asked Ekkart to collaborate with his fashion show for his 1998 summer collection in Paris. He needed 70 dancers, dressed in futuric evening costumes, and green gas masks and long green rubber gloves, to dance the final show numberhttps://vimeo.com/153608487 for an audience of 3.000 fashion people and reporters. Peter Ekkart did the choreography, coordinated the act, and also participated as a dancer. = Wim Vandekeybus = For an audition for his show in 2015, Wim Vandekeybus had to choose from 600 dancers coming from all parts of the world. He hired Peter and Ellen Ekkart to give a session in ballroom dancing, so he could see how quickly dancers picked up this style. The fusion of contemporary dance, ballet and ballroom gave a special mix,https://vimeo.com/154039250 which Vandekeybus can use in the near future.  Music  Ekkart has a big interest in dance music. Because of the many poor quality albums delivered on the ballroom dancing market, he started to look for musicians and artists to create a better dancing experience. = Danny Wuyts = From 1996 to 1998, Ekkart worked together with Danny Wuyts (artist name Bodane). This versatile artist had all the capacities to make a good balance between cost and quality. Ekkart and Wuyts worked together to find the perfect songs, brought in top musicians to play the lead instruments, using Danny's wide voice range for the lead and backing vocals for all the songs, and recorded their first CD. In search of a music distributor, Ekkart found that the company Dancelife was looking for new talent, and was interested in selling a CD especially made for ballroom dancing schools. The CD was an instant hit with the Belgium and Dutch dancing public, and soon also in the international field of dancing. Following this success, three CDs in total were made, the first and second in cooperation with Peter Ekkart, and the third produced only by Danny Wuyts. Today, the music from the albums is still used in major dance competitions worldwide. After the sell-out of the three CDs, Dancelife put the catalogue on iTunes, where the music is still bought today. = Gery's Big Band = Ekkart understood the extra dimension that live music gave to dancers during their performance, so he looked further to provide live music during big organizations in Belgium. He found an existing band called Gery's Big Band,Gery's Big Band built around the musician Gery Liekens. His band gave the perfect base to try out lots of tracks and music, suitable to support ballroom dancing competitions. After rehearsals and tryouts, Gery's Big Band was ready to play at the official All Round Ballroom Dancing Championships in the early 1990s. Twenty years later, they made contact again, and started working again on a whole new and more defined playlist for competitions. Gery's Big Band now has an impressive playlist off almost 100 songs, perfectly suitable for high ranked competitions. They were asked for several competitions again from 2013, and played in 2015 at the Benelux championships. = Dancing With The Stars = VTM (Flemish Commercial television) bought the rights for this program in Belgium, and started the Flemish version of the show Sterren Op de Dansvloer in 2006. Band leader Steve Willaert and Musical Television Director Jos Van Oosterwyck asked Ekkart to be a musical advisor before the start of the first season, so they could fine- tune the music for the shows. Steve Willaert asked later Ekkart for advice on several other musical projects. = The Ballroom Orchestra = Wim Jansegers had the idea of touring the Flemish cultural centers with authentic ballroom music. He looked for professional musicians and singers, and for an advisor in the ballroom dancing world. That contact was soon found, and Peter Ekkart was attracted as a musical advisor, and as the show couple with his wife and partner Ellen Ekkart. They named the band The Ballroom Orchestra. One of the band members, Peter van Woensel, also participated in the making of the dance music CDs, and Ekkart asked him to join the band. The show included the participation of the public, where musicians, dancers and public interact with each other. The show toured for two years in 2013 and 2014, and played in all major cities in Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium. The highlight was three concerts in the authentic hall The Romahttps://vimeo.com/153942165 in Antwerp.  Personal life  Peter Ekkart was married with Sabine Potiau and has two children with her: Joyce and Mike. He married his partner Ellen Ekkart-Saey in 2001. Together they have a son named Idriz.

The southern portion of the permanent football seating, adjacent to left field, was excess capacity for baseball and was removed during World War II. The new alignment had abundant foul territory, especially along the third base line. Other than a backstop, there was little foul territory fencing, except to protect a parking lot to the right; it also went without dugouts, as the teams sat on open benches.

It was worth 120 nummi or 3 folles. The name trifollaro, used by scholars, was coined by the Italian numismatist Rodolfo Spahr. Contemporary sources do not use the name. Spahr interpreted the phrase tres follares aereos romesinam unam appretiatos (\\"three new copper follares should be taken as one romesina\\") in Falco of Benevento's discussion of the currency reform of 1140 as a reference to a new denomination of coin. Count Roger I of Sicily (reigned 1071‚Äì1101) minted both folles and trifollari at Mileto. The latter are on average about three times as heavy as the former (10.6 to 3.4 grams). While the folles have a large Tau cross on them, the trifollari have an image of an armed equestrian figure. Philip Grierson argues that it is likely an image of the count made from life, since it has no identifiable model or parallel in contemporary art or sculpture. It is perhaps close in style to the contemporary Norman Bayeux Tapestry. Duke William II of Apulia minted trifollari at Mileto. Those minted around the time of William's investiture by Pope Paschal II in 1114 bear an equestrian effigy in imitation of those of Roger I. Later examples have a variety of different images: busts, stars, crosses, etc. In about 1184, King William II of Sicily began minting at Messina a trifollaro with a lion's face (or mask) on the obverse and a fruited date-palm on the reverse. This was a debased coin, much smaller than the trifollari minted a century earlier. The lion's face appears to be a copy of a Siculo-Punic coin minted at Messina in the fifth century BC‚Äî1500 years earlier. These may still have been in circulation in Messina in 1184. The date-palm may have been a symbol meant for William's Muslim subjects, since the Quran says Mary ate dates at the time of Jesus' birth.

Plot Alex Cross and his family, who live in Washington, D.C., travel to Starksville, North Carolina, so Alex and his wife Bree can help clear Alex's cousin Stefan Tate of a murder they suspect he did not commit. Stefan, a school teacher, is on trial for supposedly murdering Rashawn Turnbull, a boy in his class, and almost everyone in town is convinced he's guilty and wants him to hang. Alex has not been to Starksville since leaving as a child thirty-five years ago. The Cross family has not found the town to be welcoming to them, partly because they are there to help clear Stefan. Alex travels to Belle Glade, Florida, to get information on his father, who was said to have committed suicide near there. He meets a veteran Palm Beach County, Florida, sergeant, who is convinced Alex can help him catch a brutal serial killer in Palm Beach County. It turns out that the sergeant is Alex's long-lost father Jason. Meanwhile, Alex looks into Marvin Bell, a local businessman who has had dubious influence on the Cross family during Alex's childhood and is said to have orchestrated Jason Cross's fake death. After investigation, it turns out that Bell teamed up with Rashawn's maternal grandparents to ship a highly potent addictive drug across the South and were making large profits off of this drug. Rashawn's grandfather had killed Rashawn due to feeling shameful about the child's mixed heritage, then pinned it on Stefan since the latter had been investigating into the Starksville drug trade. It is also discovered that the entire judicial system of Starksville had been under FBI investigation for corruption. Following the incident, the FBI moves in and arrests all the judges in Starksville, with Stefan's case being dropped.https://www.amazon.com/Cross-Justice-Alex-James- Patterson/dp/0316407046/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid;=&sr;= .

History The missile represents a further development of the HELA (Hypersonic Experimental Flying Vehicle) developed by NPO Mashinostroyeniya that was on display at the 1995 MAKS air show. Prototypes were test-launched from a Tu-22M3 bomber in 2012‚Äì2013. Launches from a ground-based platform followed in 2015, with first success achieved in 2016. In April 2017, it was reported Zircon had reached a speed of during a flight test. Zircon was again test-fired on 3 June 2017, almost a year earlier than had been announced by Russian officials. In November 2017, Colonel General Viktor Bondarev stated that the missile was already in service. Another flight test reportedly occurred on 10 December 2018, during which the missile demonstrated that it could attain a speed of Mach 8. On 20 February 2019, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated the missile is capable of accelerating up to Mach 9 and destroying both sea and land targets within distance. By the year's end, on 24 December 2019, Vladimir Putin stated that Zircon's land-based version was in development. According to the commander in chief of the Russian Navy Nikolai Yevmenov, as of January 2020, Zircon was still in testing phase and despite the overall positive evaluation of the test program, still suffered from the \\"childhood diseases\\" (Russian idiom meaning \\"teething problems\\"). Modernized frigates are expected to be the first platform to receive the hypersonic missile, and the tests are to be continued in parallel with the Navy's armament with the Kalibr cruise missile. Yevmenov further stated Zircon is expected to enter service \\"in the coming years\\". In early January 2020, Zircon was first test-launched from the frigate in the Barents Sea, and successfully hit a ground target in the Northern Urals, exceeding the distance of 500 km. On 7 October 2020, the Russian Chief of General Staff, Valery Gerasimov, stated Zircon was launched from the Admiral Gorshkov frigate in the White Sea and successfully hit a sea target in the Barents Sea away, reportedly reaching a speed of \\"more than Mach 8\\" and altitude of . Design Zircon is believed to be a maneuvering, winged hypersonic cruise missile with a lift-generating center body. A booster stage with solid-fuel engines accelerates it to supersonic speeds, after which a scramjet motor with liquid-fuel () in the second stage accelerates it to hypersonic speeds.

He fought in the Imperial Russian Army in World War I before going over to the Bolsheviks in the subsequent civil war. He was a recipient of the Order of the Red Banner. During the Great Purge, he was arrested on August 9, 1937 and later executed. After the death of Joseph Stalin, he was rehabilitated in 1956.  Early life, World War I, and Russian Civil War  Demichev was born in 1885 to a Russian peasant family in the village of Kuprino, Karachevsky Uyezd, Oryol Governorate. After graduating from the village school, he went to work in Yekaterinoslav, becoming a roller and paperboy at a printing house. Drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1908, Demichev served with the 14th Little Russia Dragoon Regiment as a private before rising to non-commissioned officer in 1911. He entered a school for praporshchiks (ensigns) at the division headquarters in 1913, but did not graduate due to the outbreak of World War I. Demichev fought with the regiment in the war and was promoted to praporshchik for distinguishing himself in battle. After joining the Red Army in June 1918 during the Russian Civil War, Demichev served as a platoon and squadron commander in the 4th Oryol Cavalry Regiment, assistant commander of the 5th Alatyr Cavalry Regiment for personnel, and commander of the latter regiment between 1918 and 1919. On the night of 25 February 1920, during Red attacks on Crimea in early 1920, Demichev led his regiment as part of the 13th Cavalry Brigade in a raid on Tyup-Dzhankoy and put the opposing White forces to flight while suffering minimal casualties. Continuing the pursuit allowed neighbouring units to also advance. For his leadership of the raid, Demichev was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 11 September. In 1920, with the regiment, he joined the Red Cossacks division and was appointed commander of its 3rd Brigade. He was twice wounded in action during the war.  Interwar period  From December 1920, he led the 8th Cavalry Division, which he commanded until August 1921, when it became the 1st Cavalry Division. Demichev continued in command of the division until 1932, simultaneously serving as its military commissar. He received a second Order of the Red Banner in 1923. During this period he graduated from Higher Academic Courses at the Military Academy of the Red Army in 1924, Courses of Improvement for Higher Officers at the Frunze Military Academy in 1930, and Courses for Commanders at the Tolmachev Military-Political Academy. Advancing to serve as commander and military commissar of the 1st Cavalry Corps in November 1932, Demichev was transferred to the reserve in August 1937 due to \\"political unreliability.\\" He was arrested on 9 August 1937 and sentenced to death by the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union on 19 November, charged with participating in a military conspiracy. Demichev was shot a day later. He was posthumously rehabilitated on 20 October 1956.

The multipayer model is designed for discrete instances of care, especially those involving chemotherapy, which triggers the six-month episode. The program combines fee- for-service (FFS) payments for established services, monthly payments for additional care under a structured guideline, and performance-based payments weighed against quality metrics and benchmarks. OCM is part of a general move away from the FFS model, \\"which pays doctors and hospitals according to the number of procedures they do, toward value-based care, which pays based on what helps patients get better.\\" This idea was advanced by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which was signed into law on March 23, 2010. , OCM is being utilized by 190 healthcare provider groups, which include over 3,000 physicians in the United States. Along with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the payment system is accepted by 16 other health care coverage programs in the US. The payment model went into operation in July 2016, and barring changes to the Affordable Care Act, is slated to run until 2021. Over this five-year period, it is estimated that the model will be used for $6 billion spent on medical care to 155,000 patients. The program is a move by the CMS to shift its focus to include specialized care. The bundled design has been the source of praise and criticism for the payment system. The program has been criticized for not going far enough; that is not eliminating FFS altogether. Other criticisms include the lack of flexibility in allowing primary care physicians to conduct care as they see fit, the arbitrary nature of the time period or episode, the cumbersome burden of the reporting standards and how it penalizes practices for outcomes out of their control.  History  The Affordable Care Act mandated the creation of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) as part of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). It was created to test new \\"payment and delivery system models\\" to be used by \\"Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program.\\" The legislation also created the accountable care organizations (ACO) model, which holds voluntarily-enrolled health care practitioners accountable to patients and third-party payers for the quality, appropriateness, and efficiency of its services. ACO introduced the concept of rewards based on savings or \\"shared savings,\\" which would later be applied to OCM. However, the results were mixed, with \\"only 31 percent of the nearly 400 ACOs\\" being successful in seeing returns. A related program is the Community Oncology Medical Home or COME HOME‚Äîa program to develop medical homes as a part of several oncology centers across the US. OCM was based on this earlier model developed by Barbara McAneny and Innovative Oncology Business Solutions through a $20 million grant from the CMMI. COME HOME included provisions which would later be emulated by OCM such as: requirement for use of electronic health records (EHR), patient education, access to 24/7 telephone support and same-day appointments. The program has reported lower rate of hospitalization, use of emergency services and lower cost of care. In September 2014, while OCM was still in development, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) commented on the program, \\"urging CMS to explore more substantial reforms,\\" and also offered its own alternative payment model. In February 2015, CMMI launched a demonstration program that would include a potential 100 oncology practices and invited other insurance payers to participate. OCM was officially launched on July 1, 2016. It was announced on June 28, as part of Vice President Joe Biden's Cancer Moonshot Summit.  Design  Physicians and Hospitals can earn $160 per patient per month for an entire 6 months which begins at the initiation of chemotherapy treatment. In order to qualify for these payments, the practice has to continually meet the following six care- standards: * Must provide 24/7 access to a healthcare provider who has access to the practice's medical records, * Develop and maintain a comprehensive care management plan, as outlined by Institute of Medicine, * Coordinate care through the use of patient navigators, * Participants of OCM are obligated to use an Office of the National Coordinator-certified EHR and must attest to stage 1 meaningful use by year one and stage 2 by year three, * Use accepted clinical treatments based on guidelines * Report care improvements implemented and clinical outcomes, and use data for continuous quality improvement, In order to receive performance-based payments, the practices must demonstrate a lowered spending per treatment episode when compared to benchmark standards. The benchmark is determined through the use of a risk-adjustment of expenditures compared to \\"a historical baseline period trended forward to the current performance period.\\" The program requires that practices report the outcome of their treatments and compares that to quality metrics to determine the level of reimbursement to the practice. A number of healthcare provider groups have announced that they have developed systems of reporting specifically designed for oncology to meet the demands of OCM and its EHR requirements. Some of these include third-parties solutions like Archway Health, Cota Healthcare, Flatiron Health, McKesson Specialty Health, and Navigating Cancer.  Criticisms  In their response to the model, Blase Polite and Harold Miller of the University of Chicago criticized OCM for not going far enough. In their view, the failure to eliminate FFS all together is a primary shortcoming of the payment model. A superficial monthly payment does little to prevent the unnecessary clinic visits doctors are forced to schedule in order to justify fees for actual care provided: They argue that the $160 per-beneficiary-per-month payments are insufficient to alleviate this sort of lose of revenue and the possibility of return-on-savings rarely succeeded in previous ACO models in testing. There is little scientific basis for the six months length of an episode of care that begins at the initiation of chemotherapy. While some oncology treatments take only mere weeks to complete, others can take the full six months of the episode to complete. However, the physician is paid the full bundle rate for both cases. In fact, if the care of the patient takes a little over six months, the physician is required to maintain care for a second episode and entitled to payments for two bundled episodes. According to Polite and Miller, this creates a \\"perverse incentive\\" to the physician to delay ending treatment or delay a portion of the treatment until the second episode in order to demonstrate lowered spending in the first episode, which is a requirement of performance-based payment.

The territory also includes Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport and various government facilities, and as of the 2010 census had a population of 149. Geography View of the Round Tower. The flag is at half- staff because former American President Ronald Reagan had died just prior to the day the photograph was taken. The unorganized territory of Fort Snelling is a division of Hennepin County lying just east of the city of Richfield. Historic Fort Snelling is located at the eastern end of the territory, near the confluence of the Mississippi River with the Minnesota River. Within Hennepin County it also borders Minneapolis to the north and Bloomington to the southwest, while across the Mississippi River is Saint Paul in Ramsey County, and across the Minnesota River are Mendota and Mendota Heights in Dakota County. For postal purposes, the eastern portion addresses in the unorganized territory (including Terminal 1 of the Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport and the Fort Snelling historic site) are in zip code 55111 with a Saint Paul mailing address, while addresses in the western part of the territory (including the airport's Terminal 2 and the Metropolitan Airports Commission offices) are in zip code 55450 and have a Minneapolis mailing address. According to the United States Census Bureau, this unorganized territory has a total area of 17.2 km2 (6.7 mi2). 16.5 km2 (6.4 mi2) of it is land and 0.8 km2 (0.3 mi2) of it is water. Fort Snelling's territory contains numerous military and other federal facilities. These facilities include the current National Guard base at Fort Snelling, Fort Snelling National Cemetery, and the Minneapolis Veterans Health Administration Medical Center. Several facilities belonging to Minnesota state government agencies such as the Minnesota Department of Transportation are also located in the territory, as are the headquarters and portions of Fort Snelling State Park and the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, however, includes most of the land area of the unorganized territory. Demographics Fort Snelling was listed as an incorporated village during the 1890 Census. Most people resident in the unorganized territory are service members stationed at the barracks at Fort Snelling. The number of troops stationed there has declined over the years; between the 2000 and 2010 censuses the population dropped from 442 to 149. Since then, however, a small amount of private housing in the old fort's Upper Post area has been developed or planned, so the population will likely increase again. As of the census of 2000, 442 people resided in the unorganized territory. The population density was 26.8/km¬≤ (69.5/mi¬≤). The racial makeup of the unorganized territory was 94.57% White, 3.62% Black or African American, 1.36% Native American, 0.00% Asian, 0.23% Pacific Islander, and 0.23% of other races. 0.45% of the population was Hispanic or Latino of any race. The population is spread out in age with 4.5% from 25 to 44, 33.0% from 45 to 64, and 62.4% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 69 years. Males had a median income of $43,558 versus $0 for females. The per capita income was $24,328. None of the population was below the poverty line.

During this process he helped a local business owner at the Manhattan Coffee Bar protest a $5000 Euro fine imposed by the police for installment of video cameras to protect his business. A fundraiser was organized by Merlino of which over 100 people attended and donated to raise money for the fine, so the bar owner could stay in business.  Earthquake Protests as Spider-Man  By late August 2016, attention was diverted to the victims of the 2016 6.2 Earthquakes impacting central Italy (namely the Amatrice region). He began marching in the squares of several towns, and ended up trekking over 300 miles to bring solidarity to the victims by suggesting a \\"smile iniative\\" for the children impacted.

Research Pinzari's research on the -body problem has been described as \\"the most natural way to apply\\" the Kolmogorov‚ÄìArnold‚ÄìMoser theorem to the problem. The original work of Vladimir Arnold on this theorem attempted to use it to show the stability of the solar system or similar systems of planetary orbits, but this worked only for the three-body problem because of a degeneracy in Arnold's mathematical framework. Pinzari showed how to eliminate this problem, and extended the solution to larger numbers of bodies, by developing \\"a rotation-invariant version of the KAM theory\\". Education and career Pinzari earned master's degrees in both physics and mathematics from Sapienza University of Rome, in 1990 and 1996 respectively. She completed her doctorate in 2009 at Roma Tre University under the supervision of Luigi Chierchia. She joined the faculty of the University of Naples Federico II since 2013, and later moved to the University of Padova.
