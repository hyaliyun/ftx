Biography  Charles Symmons was born in 1804 to a privileged family, made destitute by a \\"reversal of fortune\\" in 1831. While not meeting the usual requirements of education or experience in administering religion or law, Symmons took advantage of family connections to receive a recommendation from the Earl of Clarendon for a position at the new colony. His father's brother was Charles Symmons, a poet and scholar active in the Anglican clergy, and the Royal surgeon and scientist Anthony Carlisle was his brother-in-law. His impressive connections to upper classes of English society are likely to have increased his status in the small colony.  Works  Symmons arrived at the colony on 12 December 1839, beginning a public service position at the town that would become the state of Western Australia's capital, Perth. His title was first announced as the \\"Protector of Aborigines\\", he summarised this period in 1848 as the application of a reward system, \\"The Protectors are most effectually advancing the best interests of their sable clients, by identifying themselves equally with those of the settlers, by protecting them from the aggressions of the aborigines, and thereby promoting a mutual reciprocity of good feeling.\\" His policies of \\"native management\\" are regarded as a notable departure from his predecessors and contemporary application of justice and protection. His job title was later changed to \\"Guardian of Aborigines and Protector of Settlers\\". The appointment as Protector saw him take charge of two mounted officers with a contingent of eighteen indigenous men recruited as aides. Symmons was assisted by the colonist Francis Armstrong in the role of the town's constable and \\"native translator\\" and Peter Barrow, who had also been appointed in England and was posted to the eastern frontier of the settlement at York. The directives and payment of his salary were taken from funds provided by Lord Glenelg in England, in response to reports of violence presented in the British parliament, and to be implemented by the colony's governor John Hutt. When Charles Symmons assumed his role in 1840, the policies of extending law and order to the Aboriginal peoples included the use of Rottnest Island for detention of Aboriginal people. At the beginning of what would become a notorious prison system, the stated aim of the Rottenest was the education of men deemed as insubordinate to accept the newly imposed social regulations and be employed as farm labourers. Symmons was able to sentence individuals he described as \\"untameable savages\\" to be transported to the island, visible just twenty kilometres offshore and greatly feared by the Nyungar peoples due to reports of conditions there. His positions in the Swan River colony's civil service included the Public Works board in 1849, immigration agent in 1856, acting sheriff at Champion Bay during 1861 to 1862, and resident magistrate and justice of the peace at Fremantle in 1868. He was as Acting Superintendent, effectively the head of law enforcement in the colony, from the beginning of March to the end of May in 1958; a briefly held position that advanced his career in the judiciary. Symmons influence with the police came as recommendations for recruitment to their ranks, and he may have directly appointed new officers himself while serving as sheriff at Champion Bay. He retired as Police Magistrate at Fremantle in 1870. Charles Symmons recorded and assembled word lists of the Nyungar language in the course of his work, these were included in the important compilation A Descriptive Vocabulary of the Language in Common Use Amongst the Aborigines of Western Australia that was appended to publication of the colonist George Fletcher Moore's diaries.

Complementary medicine (CM), complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), integrated medicine or integrative medicine (IM), and holistic medicine are among many rebrandings of the same phenomenon.  Terms for alternative medicine  The terms alternative medicine, complementary medicine, integrative medicine, holistic medicine, natural medicine, unorthodox medicine, fringe medicine, unconventional medicine, and new age medicine are used interchangeably as having the same meaning and are almost synonymous in most contexts. Marcia Angell: \\"There cannot be two kinds of medicine ‚Äì conventional and alternative\\". The meaning of the term \\"alternative\\" in the expression \\"alternative medicine\\", is not that it is an effective alternative to medical science, although some alternative medicine promoters may use the loose terminology to give the appearance of effectiveness. Loose terminology may also be used to suggest meaning that a dichotomy exists when it does not, e.g., the use of the expressions \\"Western medicine\\" and \\"Eastern medicine\\" to suggest that the difference is a cultural difference between the Asiatic east and the European west, rather than that the difference is between evidence-based medicine and treatments that do not work. = Complementary or integrative medicine = Complementary medicine (CM) or integrative medicine (IM) is when alternative medicine is used together with functional medical treatment, in a belief that it improves the effect of treatments. For example, acupuncture (piercing the body with needles to influence the flow of a supernatural energy) might be believed to increase the effectiveness or \\"complement\\" science-based medicine when used at the same time. Instead, significant drug interactions caused by alternative therapies may make treatments less effective, notably in cancer therapy. Besides the usual issues with alternative medicine, integrative medicine has been described as an attempt to bring pseudoscience into academic science-based medicine, leading to the pejorative term \\"quackademic medicine\\". Due to its many names, the field has been criticized for intense rebranding of what are essentially the same practices. CAM is an abbreviation of the phrase complementary and alternative medicine. It has also been called sCAM or SCAM with the addition of \\"so-called\\" or \\"supplements\\". =Other terms= Traditional medicine refers to the pre-scientific practices of a certain culture, in contrast to what is typically practiced in cultures where medical science dominates. \\"Eastern medicine\\" typically refers to the traditional medicines of Asia where conventional bio-medicine penetrated much later. Holistic medicine is another rebranding of alternative medicine. In this case, the words balance and holism are often used alongside complementary or integrative, claiming to take into account a \\"whole\\" person, in contrast to the supposed reductionism of medicine.  Definitions of alternative medicine  Alternative medicine is defined loosely as a set of products, practices, and theories that are believed or perceived by their users to have the healing effects of medicine, but whose effectiveness has not been established using scientific methods, or whose theory and practice is not part of biomedicine, or whose theories or practices are directly contradicted by scientific evidence or scientific principles used in biomedicine. \\"Biomedicine\\" or \\"medicine\\" is that part of medical science that applies principles of biology, physiology, molecular biology, biophysics, and other natural sciences to clinical practice, using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice. Unlike medicine, an alternative product or practice does not originate from using scientific methods, but may instead be based on hearsay, religion, tradition, superstition, belief in supernatural energies, pseudoscience, errors in reasoning, propaganda, fraud, or other unscientific sources. = Challenges in defining alternative medicine= Terminology has shifted over time, reflecting the preferred branding of practitioners.\\"Integrative medicine\\": A brand, not a specialty. Science Based Medicine For example, the United States National Institutes of Health department studying alternative medicine, currently named the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH), was established as the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM) and was renamed the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) before obtaining its current name. Therapies are often framed as \\"natural\\" or \\"holistic\\", in apparent opposition to conventional medicine which is \\"artificial\\" and \\"narrow in scope\\", statements which are intentionally misleading. Prominent members of the science and biomedical science community say that it is not meaningful to define an alternative medicine that is separate from a conventional medicine, because the expressions \\"conventional medicine\\", \\"alternative medicine\\", \\"complementary medicine\\", \\"integrative medicine\\", and \\"holistic medicine\\" do not refer to any medicine at all. Others say that alternative medicine cannot be precisely defined because of the diversity of theories and practices it includes, and because the boundaries between alternative and conventional medicine overlap, are porous, and change. The systems and practices it refers to are diffuse, and its boundaries poorly defined. Healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin, theoretical basis, diagnostic technique, therapeutic practice and in their relationship to the medical mainstream. Some alternative therapies, such as traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda, have antique origins in East or South Asia and are entirely alternative medical systems;. . others, such as homeopathy and chiropractic, have origins in Europe or the United States and emerged in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Some, such as osteopathy and chiropractic, employ manipulative physical methods of treatment; others, such as meditation and prayer, are based on mind-body interventions. Under a definition of alternative medicine as \\"non-mainstream\\", treatments considered alternative in one location may be considered conventional in another. Critics say the expression is deceptive because it implies there is an effective alternative to science-based medicine, and that complementary is deceptive because it implies that the treatment increases the effectiveness of (complements) science-based medicine, while alternative medicines that have been tested nearly always have no measurable positive effect compared to a placebo. It has been said that \\"there is really no such thing as alternative medicine, just medicine that works and medicine that doesn't\\", and that the very idea of \\"alternative\\" treatments is paradoxical because any treatment proven to work is by definition \\"medicine.\\" =Different types of definitions= Some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare. This can refer to the lack of support that alternative therapies receive from medical scientists regarding access to research funding, sympathetic coverage in the medical press, or inclusion in the standard medical curriculum. In 1993, the British Medical Association (BMA) stated that it referred to \\"...those forms of treatment which are not widely used by the conventional healthcare professions, and the skills of which are not taught as part of the undergraduate curriculum of conventional medical and paramedical healthcare courses\\". In a US context, a definition coined in 1993 by the Harvard-based physician David M. Eisenberg described alternative medicine as \\"interventions neither taught widely in medical schools nor generally available in US hospitals\\".. . In a definition published in 2000 by the World Health Organization (WHO), CAM was defined as a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition and are not integrated into the dominant health care system. A widely used descriptive definition devised by the US NCCIH calls it \\"a group of diverse medical and health care systems, practices, and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine\\". However, these descriptive definitions are inadequate in the present-day when some conventional doctors offer alternative medical treatments and introductory courses or modules can be offered as part of standard undergraduate medical training; alternative medicine is taught in more than half of US medical schools and US health insurers are increasingly willing to provide reimbursement for alternative therapies. In 1999, 7.7% of US hospitals reported using some form of alternative therapy; this proportion had risen to 37.7% by 2008. An expert panel at a conference hosted in 1995 by the US Office for Alternative Medicine (OAM), devised a theoretical definition of alternative medicine as \\"a broad domain of healing resources ... other than those intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period\\". This definition has been widely adopted, and has been cited by the UK Department of Health, attributed as the definition used by the Cochrane Collaboration, and, with some modification, was preferred in the 2005 consensus report of the US Institute of Medicine. This definition, an expansion of Eisenberg's 1993 formulation, is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies. Its proponents hold that it thus avoids relativism about differing forms of medical knowledge and, while it is an essentially political definition, this should not imply that the dominance of mainstream medicine is solely due to political forces. According to this definition, alternative and mainstream medicine can only be differentiated with reference to what is \\"intrinsic to the politically dominant health system of a particular society of culture\\". However, there is neither a reliable method to distinguish between cultures and subcultures, nor to attribute them as dominant or subordinate, nor any accepted criteria to determine the dominance of a cultural entity. If the culture of a politically dominant healthcare system is held to be equivalent to the perspectives of those charged with the medical management of leading healthcare institutions and programs, the definition fails to recognize the potential for division either within such an elite or between a healthcare elite and the wider population. Evidence-based definitions distinguish alternative medicine based on its provision of therapies that are unproven, unvalidated, or ineffective and support of theories with no recognized scientific basis. These definitions characterize practices as constituting alternative medicine when, used independently or in place of evidence-based medicine, they are put forward as having the healing effects of medicine, but are not based on evidence gathered with the scientific method. Exemplifying this perspective, a 1998 editorial co-authored by Marcia Angell, a former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, argued that: This line of division has been subject to criticism on the grounds that not all forms of standard medical practice have adequately demonstrated evidence of benefit, and that most conventional therapies, if proven to be ineffective, would not later be classified as alternative. Another definition is that alternative medicine refers to a diverse range of related and unrelated products, practices, and theories ranging from biologically plausible practices and products and practices with some evidence, to practices and theories that are directly contradicted by basic science or clear evidence, and products that have been conclusively proven to be ineffective or even toxic and harmful. Proponents of an evidence-base for medicine such as the Cochrane Collaboration take a position that all systematic reviews of treatments, whether \\"mainstream\\" or \\"alternative\\", ought to be held to the current standards of scientific method. In 2011, the Cochrane Collaboration proposed that indicators of a therapy's level of acceptance include government licensing of practitioners, coverage by health insurance, statements of approval by government agencies, and recommendation as part of a practice guideline; and that if something is currently a standard, accepted therapy, then it is not likely to be widely considered as alternative. Australia The public information website maintained by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of the Commonwealth of Australia uses the acronym \\"CAM\\" for a wide range of health care practices, therapies, procedures and devices not within the domain of conventional medicine. In the Australian context this is stated to include acupuncture; aromatherapy; chiropractic; homeopathy; massage; meditation and relaxation therapies; naturopathy; osteopathy; reflexology, traditional Chinese medicine; and the use of vitamin supplements. Denmark The Danish National Board of Health's Council for Alternative Medicine (Sundhedsstyrelsens R√•d for Alternativ Behandling (SRAB)), an independent institution under the National Board of Health (Danish: Sundhedsstyrelsen), uses the term \\"alternative medicine\\" for: * Treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals. * Treatments performed by authorized healthcare professionals, but those based on methods otherwise used mainly outside the healthcare system. People without a healthcare authorisation are [also] allowed to perform the treatments. Other terms =Allopathic medicine= Allopathic medicine or allopathy is a pejorative term used by proponents of alternative medicine to refer to modern scientific systems of medicine, such as the use of pharmacologically active agents or physical interventions to treat or suppress symptoms or pathophysiologic processes of diseases or conditions. Citing: Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine (2008) and Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th ed. (2009). The expression was coined in 1810 by the creator of homeopathy, Samuel Hahnemann (1755‚Äì1843). Among homeopaths and other alternative medicine advocates, the expression \\"allopathic medicine\\" is still used to refer to \\"the broad category of medical practice that is sometimes called Western medicine, biomedicine, evidence-based medicine, or modern medicine.\\" Use of the term remains common among homeopaths and has spread to other alternative medicine practices. The meaning implied by the label has never been accepted by conventional medicine and is still considered pejorative by some. William Jarvis, an expert on alternative medicine and public health, states that \\"although many modern therapies can be construed to conform to an allopathic rationale (e.g., using a laxative to relieve constipation), standard medicine has never paid allegiance to an allopathic principle\\" and that the label \\"allopath\\" was \\"considered highly derisive by regular medicine.\\" Most modern science-based medical treatments (antibiotics, vaccines, and chemotherapeutics, for example) do not fit Samuel Hahnemann's definition of allopathy, as they seek to prevent illness, or remove the cause of an illness by acting on the cause of disease.

It supports projects and advocates politically for girls and women affected by sexual violence in war zones worldwide.  History  Shocked by the mass rapes of Bosnian women and the lack of media coverage,German source: K√∂lner Stadtanzeiger gynaecologist Monika Hauser went to the conflict area in the former Yugoslavia in late 1992. In April 1993, Hauser and about 20 local psychologists and physicians opened the therapy centre Medica Zenica in Zenica, Bosnia. They developed concepts on how to help women and their children suffering from war trauma, both during and after the war. In Germany, supporters collected donations for the centre, organised supply convoys to the war zone and raised awareness. In June 1993, Hauser founded the association Medica mondiale in Cologne. The German news show Tagesthemen awarded her the title \\"woman of the year\\". In 1996, Medica Zenica was officially recognised in Bosnia as a humanitarian organisation. In 1999, they expanded their activities to Kosovo and Albania, where more centres caring for raped and traumatised women where established. The interdisciplinary women's counselling centre in rural Gjakova in Kosovo has been independent since 2011. On the basis of the concept developed in Bosnia, the organisation's activity was expanded to more countries, including Afghanistan, where the 2002-established Medica Afghanistan has operated independently since 2011. Since 2004, subsidies through a project fund have been channelled to selected women's organisations, mainly in the Central African region of the Great Lakes. The association supports partner organisations in the DR Congo, Rwanda, Uganda and Burundi. Since 2006, Medica Zenica has been working in southeastern Liberia in a joint project with the German NGO Welthungerhilfe for the medical and psychosocial care and support of Liberian women. The women's rights organisation Medica Liberia, founded there, has been independent since 2015. Since autumn 2014, the association has been working in the Middle East, in the Syria/Iraq region and Turkey, to support women and girls who are affected and threatened of sexual violence, both in their home countries and as refugees.  Mission and vision  The organisation's vision is that all women and girls can live in a world without violence and discrimination, in dignity and equality in family and society. It offers medical, social and psychological help, as well as legal advice and representation to women with symptoms of trauma. Locals are trained to work with traumatised women, advisory and healthcare centres are built and possibilities for securing subsistence are created. Furthermore, crimes against women are documented and charges are prepared. The object is capacity building and supporting an independent life in equity, both through individual work with affected women, and by influencing the societal and political framework. This applies also to new organisations established by the organisation. These organisations continue to receive financial support and advice after establishment.http://www.taz.de/!5166693/title=√Ñrztin Monika Hauser: \\"Ich akzeptiere nicht\\"language=German The organisation disapproves of any form of nationalism and fundamentalism and sees itself as part of the international women's movement. It advocates for tolerance and appreciation of cultural and social diversity, as long as this is compatible with universal human rights. It calls for the implementation and further development of Resolution 1325, which was adopted in 2000. It is a member of several German NGO networks. The work of the organisation is financed by donations and grants from public funds. An annual report provides information about revenue and expenditure.  Stress- and trauma-sensitive approach  The organisation has developed a stress- and trauma-sensitive approach to support people affected by violence, especially women. The trauma-sensitive approach takes into account basic principles in dealing with people who have experienced violence. The main point is to avoid additional stress for those affected. In addition, the stress- and trauma-sensitive approach should prevent retraumatisation and strengthen women in restoring their self-esteem. The aim of psychosocial support is to support the management of traumatic experiences. This support goes along with measures designed to change political frameworks, structures and social awareness, including training for non-governmental organisations, police and health and legal staff.  Lobbying and campaigns  Through educational and human rights work, the association wants to make social and political changes in favour of women, both in Germany and worldwide. At events, in discussions with politicians, but also in position papers and open letters, the organisation takes a stand on sexualised wartime violence, names strategies for the prevention of sexual violence and calls on decision-makers to act. Through campaigns, the association drew attention to sexual violence in the war and its consequences: Zeit zu sprechen (time to speak) in 2005 drew awareness to crimes against women during the Second World War. The campaign Im Einsatz (in action) from 2008 to 2011 provided information about women and girls in war and crisis areas and asked for support for them. In 2015, Medica mondiale and Medica Zenica published a systematic study of the long-term consequences of war rape in Bosnia and Herzegovina. With the support of the Ministry of Health, Emancipation, Nursing and Age of the State of North Rhine- Westphalia, the association has been offering training courses for workers and volunteers in the field of flight and migration since 2016, as well as seminars for health professionals involved in the care of those seeking protection. In June 2016, the association developed, in cooperation with K√∂lner Fl√ºchtlingsrat e.V. (the Cologne Refugee Council), a position paper on the protection of women in refugee accommodations, which was submitted to the Ministry of the Interior and Municipal Affairs of North Rhine-Westphalia.

Civil status of Orl√©ans, which gave Altbenisgesang (in fact Altbessingen, near Gauaschach) as his birthplace.  Biography  Born in the vicinity of Gauaschach, now part of Hammelburg, district of Bad Kissingen in Lower Franconia (Germany), on 29 June 1763, he died in Orl√©ans, on 25 July 1832. He was the son of music teacher Sebastien Demar and his wife Doroth√©e Zugis.Cf. his death certificate, at the Orl√©ans civil registry office (25 July 1832, act ). Born into a family of musicians, he was first trained at the Strasbourg Cathedral by the Kapellmeister and composer Franz Xaver Richter, representative (in the same way as Johann Stamitz) of the Mannheim School. Then he became organist in Wissembourg, (Alsace). He also traveled to Vienna (Austria) to further his studies in the field of composition, with Joseph Haydn. He arrived in Paris in 1788 and settled in Orl√©ans in 1789, shortly before the Revolution. Demar did a lot for music in the city, where he first directed the music of the 88th Regiment (he was in place on 23 December 1791),Journal g√©n√©ral du d√©partement du Loiret. Announcements, Posters, and various Opinions of the City of Orl√©ans, 23 December 1791, . then of the National Guard. In 1799, he was appointed by the municipality to play the organ as an amateur at Republican festivals, in the various \\"temples\\" (the old churches) where they were held: the plain-song gave way to the \\"war song\\". At the beginning of the 19th century (1802?), Demar became \\"master of [pianoforte]\\" in the Maison d'√©ducation de Mme Robillard, in Orl√©ans. In 1806, he created the Soci√©t√© des Concerts par Abonnement. Following the course of history, he was also organist of Saint-Paterne's church from 1815... In this context he was able to train \\"choir children\\" (boys singing in the professional choir) in the technique of the pianoforte and the organ. He left many interesting works, often instrumental. He is the author, among others, of several concertos for forte-piano, including a \\"hunting concerto\\", a Cossack concerto, a concerto dedicated to the Empress Marie-Louise. He transcribed for harp one of his violin concertos so that it could be performed by his daughter Theresia in a public concert in Paris.

Prior to being elected as the first Vietnamese-American woman in the Massachusetts Legislature, Nguyen was an attorney at Greater Boston Legal Services providing support for domestic violence victims.  Early Life and Education  Nguyen was born in Vietnam and moved to the United States as a political refugee when she was 5 years old. She was raised in the Merrimack Valley and resides in Andover. Nguyen graduated from Methuen High School and enrolled at Tufts University as a first-generation college student. Before deciding to study law, Nguyen believed she wanted to study medicine and become a pediatrician. Her love for children led her to become involved with the Jumpstart program providing education to help underprivileged children develop literacy skills at a young age. However, her involvement with Jumpstart led Tram to realize that she wanted to continue to help families such as these and preferred to make change through policy, not medicine. Nguyen received a degree in Sociology and American Studies from Tufts University and then her J.D. from Northeastern University.  Career  = Legal career = Nguyen began her law career as a legal intern at Petrucelly, Nadler & Norris, P.C.. She then began to work as an attorney for Greater Boston Legal Services, where she focused on providing legal services to victims of domestic violence and family and immigration law, especially those of Vietnamese descent like herself. Nguyen also led the Nail Salon Initiative, an initiative to help low-wage workers fight wage theft. = State Representative = Tram Nguyen ran for State Representative of the 18th Essex District (parts of Andover, North Andover, Boxford, and Tewksbury) in Massachusetts. Nguyen ran against the incumbent Republican Rep. James J. Lyons Jr., who had been in office for 8 years prior to Nguyen's victory and was opposed to women's reproductive health and LGBTQ rights. Nguyen won with a 54% majority victory, a win that she credits to an \\"aggressive campaign focused on making constituents' voices heard\\". Her win gained back a historically Democratic seat that had been turned Republican when Lyons was elected to office. Additionally, Nguyen is the first Vietnamese-American woman to be elected to office in Massachusetts. During her campaign, Nguyen ran on a number of substantive issues including elected official accountability, better funding for public education, preserving the environment, prioritizing equality and inclusion for gender identity, gun violence prevention, making health care more affordable and accessible, addressing the opioid epidemic as a public health crisis, protecting seniors and veterans from a legal standpoint, investing in transportation, fighting for women's health, and improving the lives of working families.

He served in Dominicans convents across his homeland for over three decades as a teacher and prior before King Carlos III appointed him to a diocese in Mexico where he would be until being relocated to Guadalajara. It was there that his main legacies included the hospital and college he helped found there in addition to his dedication to restoring and constructing churches and schools. His beatification process opened in late 1994 and he became titled as a Servant of God. The cause later stalled due to low promotion and little interest though was resumed in 2013 upon new impetus for promoting his life and holiness. Life Antonio Alcalde Barriga was born on 14 March 1701 in Cigales in the Valladolid province in the Kingdom of Spain as the fourth and final child of Jos√© Alcalde and Isabel Barriga Balboa (who had been married since 1691). His paternal priest uncle Antonio Alcalde baptized him on 3 April in the Santiago Ap√≥stol parish church. His siblings preceding him were his brothers Fernando and Pedro and his sister In√©s. His mother died (29.7.1701) when she was 35 which left the children in the care of their father. He had worked on the farm during his childhood and worked with cattle while his father and uncle were responsible for his religious upbringing; his uncle encouraged his educational pursuits. In his childhood he had a habit of remaining long hours in the church that he would sometimes fall asleep which angered the sacristan. The sacristan would be forced to escort him home and this would prompt his parents to reprimand him for his behavior. He entered the Order of Preachers after he turned sixteen in 1717 in the San Pablo convent in Valladolid where he later assumed the religious habit in 1718. Alcalde studied Latin during his period of the novitiate. He was ordained a deacon either in late 1724 or at the beginning of 1725 while the San Pablo convent prior Francisco de Fuentes asked the Dominican prior general Juan de Ferry on 29 March 1725 that Alcalde be ordained as a priest. His ordination was celebrated sometime in mid or late 1725 in his home province. He served as the prior for several Dominican convents following his ordination from 1725 to 1762 while he served some of that time serving as a teacher for seminarians and novices in the convents he was stationed at from 1727 to 1753. Alcalde received his master's degree in 1751 around the time he was appointed as the prior for the Santo Domingo convent in Zamora. He served as the prior for the Jes√∫s Mar√≠a o de Nuestra Se√±ora de Valverde convent (seven kilometers outside of Madrid) from 13 May 1753. King Charles III - in July 1760 - travelled the slopes of Valverde and rested at the convent when he began feeling fatigued; it was there that he met and became impressed with Alcalde for his virtue and for his organizational abilities. The king later on 18 September 1761 made him the Bishop of Yucat√°n in Mexico and so he served as its bishop. The Dominicans were ignorant of this decision prior to the release of the official proclamation and in the meantime had sent Alcalde as the prior for the Santa Cruz de Segovia convent in the summer of 1761. Pope Clement XIII confirmed this appointment four months later in 1762 and he received his episcopal consecration in mid-1863 in the Cartagena de Indias cathedral before setting sail for Mexico for his new mission where he was enthroned on 1 August 1763. He studied the Mayan language when he arrived in Mexico. Alcalde was appointed as the Bishop of Guadalajara on 20 May 1771 after it had been vacant for little over five months and had the canon Manuel Col√≥n de Larre√°tegui take possession of the see on his behalf on 19 August 1771. He arrived in Guadalajara on 12 December 1771 to commence his pastoral duties in his new diocese. His two main legacies best remembered are the San Miguel Hospital and the Universidad de Guadalajara (obtaining approval for the college's construction in 1791 from King Charles IV) as he helped to found both during his episcopate. The hospital would be inaugurated on 5 November 1792 which would be three months after the bishop's death. The bishop's tenure was marked with a dedication to construct and restore churches across the large diocese which also extended to convents and schools since he had made education in the faith one of his main priorities. The people came to respect their bishop and knew him best for his gentle and affable attitude while noting him as a jovial but direct individual. He had a bed of simple sheepskin on the bare ground and would use wood as his pillow. He wore a rough blanket in the winter and fasted often. He often fed on vegetables but would sometimes add meat to his meal on some occasions. Alcalde died on 4 August 1792 in Guadalajara and his remains were buried in the diocese. Beatification process In 1992 calls for his beatification process were made and the cause launched in the Guadalajara archdiocese on 15 October 1994. The official introduction to the cause came on 17 December 1994 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause) edict and titled Alcalde as a Servant of God. The cause stalled due to a lack of promotion and waning interest though was revitalized in 2013 due to the efforts of Fr. Tom√°s de Hijar Ornelas.

Recent scholarship has suggested that In Norman Tindale's classic study his references to a Djilamatang tribe and their language arguably refer in good part to the Pallanganmiddang (or Dhudhuroa) Name -midhang/-middang ( mittang) occurs as an ethnonym-marking suffix attached to several tribal and clan names in the area. It may be the equivalent of the more southerly Kulin term ‚Äìwurrung, \\"mouth/speech\\". A. W. Howitt's map of the area refers to a Balaung Karar group, where Balaung may be an echo of Pallang- in the Pallanganmiddang ethnonym. Language Pallanganmiddang is classified by R. M. Dixon as one of two members of the Upper Murray Group, the other being Dhudhuroa. It was probably spoken by people inhabiting the area the northwest of the Dhudhuroa, though the overlap of vocabulary between the two languages appears to be low, about 10.7% A vocabulary of 46 words with the title \\"Pallanganmiddah\\" was provided by Thomas Mitchell, a resident of Tangambalanga, as early as 1878. A.W.Howitt first asserted that their language was \\"utterly different\\" from that of surrounding peoples, and modern research has confirmed that it lacked any close affinity with the other languages of that area. Country Robert Smyth's 1878 map located a PallunganMiddah group southeast of Wodonga, in the area of Tangambalanga about the terrain of the northern Kiewa River and Tallangatta around the Mitta Mitta River. Howitt's mention of a Balaung Karar group to the south-west of Wodonga has been taken, by Barry Blake, as a reference to (Balaung/Pallungan) to the same people. Society The Pallanganmiddang, in part at least, appear to have adopted the Kulin patrimoiety system with its eaglehawk ( Puntyil) ‚Äìcrow ( Waang/waa) moieties. This division, meaning that names were inherited through the father rather than the mother was a characteristic of Central Victorian Aboriginal culture, but deviated from the general norm in South-East Australia. Diane Barwick identified at least two clans, who used the Kulin terms rather than the corresponding Pallanganmiddang terminology (warrimu/berontha) to denote their respective moieties, a fact that suggests they intermarried with the contiguous southern and western Kulin groups. * Yowung-illam-balluk in the Mount Buffalo area, forming an eaglehawk moiety * Warrarak-balluk in the district of Wangaratta, constituting a crow moiety (waa).

He did pioneering work on the theory of sound propagation in the ocean and was a leading developer of motion picture technology during the transition from silent to sound film. Life Hugo Lichte studied mathematics, physics and chemistry at the University of G√∂ttingen from 1909 to 1913. He then joined the scientific staff of the ‚ÄúTorpedoinspektion Kiel‚Äù of the Imperial German Navy until 1919. After the end of World War I he worked at the ‚ÄúSignal GmbH‚Äù in Kiel and then in Berlin,starting in 1924 at the :de:Mix & Genest AG and in 1926 at the AEG.When the research institute of the AEG was founded in 1928 under the leadership of Carl Ramsauer, he was appoimted head of the electro-acoustic department in Berlin. After the end of World War II he became a teacher at the :de:Lilienthal-Gymnasium (Berlin-Lichterfelde) in Berlin until 1959. In addition he was a lecturer of physics at the Free University of Berlin from 1949. Work and achievements Lichte promoted the understanding of physical processes and related technical developments mainly in two fields: marine acoustics. and sound film technology He presented his pioneering work on the theory of sound propagation in the layered ocean in 1919. In his paper he was able to show that decreasing temperature and increasing pressure with depth lead to a minimum of sound velocity at mean depth. The resulting sound refraction patterns induce largely enhanced ranges of sound propagation. Urick commented: ‚ÄúThis paper was far ahead of its time, and is an indication of the highly advanced state of German physics in the early years of this century.‚Äú In his later work at the AEG research institute he was a leader in the development of sound technology, in particular the techniques for the transition from silent to sound movies and for sound recognition.

It is long and weighs . Taxonomy Bucco duvaucelii was the scientific name proposed by Ren√© Lesson in 1830 who described a barbet from Sumatra. The generic name Psilopogon was proposed by Salomon M√ºller in 1836, initially for a fire-tufted barbet (P. pyrolophus) from Sumatra. In subsequent decades, about 19 generic names were proposed for barbet species, including Megalaima by John Edward Gray in 1849 and Mezobucco by George Ernest Shelley in 1889. Taxonomists used different generic names when describing barbets in collections of natural history museums. Mezzobucco duvaucelii gigantorhinus was proposed by Harry C. Oberholser in 1912 for an adult male barbet with a large bill from Nias Island. Mezzobucco duvaucelii tanamassae was proposed by Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee in 1929 for a male barbet from the Batu Islands that differed from M. d. gigantorhinus by a more extensive red colour on the breast.

It was awarded to native Indian troops who took part in the major campaigns in India between 1778 to 1784. It is sometimes referred to as the Carnatic Medal. Criteria The Deccan Medal was awarded to native Indian soldiers of the armies of the EIC who participated in the campaigns in the West of India and Guzerat, and the Carnatic region of Southern India, from 1778 to 1784. This included service in both the second phase of the First Maratha War 1778-82 and the Second Mysore War of 1780-84. The first campaign medal to be awarded by the EIC to all ranks, it was authorised in 1784 by the Governor-General of India. It was issued in two sizes: a larger medal to native officers, in gold to Subedars and silver to Jemadars; with a smaller silver medal to other ranks, including Havildars, Naiks and Sepoys. In January 1785 eligibility was extended to artillery Lascars. Europeans, including those in EIC service and with British Army, were not eligible for the medal. It was only awarded to those still alive when the roll of recipients was compiled in May 1785. In addition to the medal, native soldiers who served in the relevant campaigns received additional pay of one rupee a month, while other ranks of EIC European units ‚Äì who did not receive the medal ‚Äì were granted a further two rupees a month. Each participating Indian battalion also received a pair of honorary standards. Description The medal was struck and minted by a private contractor in Calcutta. The gold medals were in diameter, while the silver were issued in two sizes: and . All types have a common design: The obverse depicts Britannia seated on a number of military trophies, holding a laurel wreath with her right hand towards a distant fort flying a Union Jack. There is no inscription. The reverse has two Persian inscriptions that translate as: in the centre: As coins are current around the world, so shall be the bravery and exploits of those heroes by who the name of the victorious English Nation was carried from Bengal to the Deccan; around the edge: Presented AD 1784 (Hijri year 1199) by the East India Company's Calcutta Government. The medal, issued unnamed, has a milled edge like a coin.Collett, D.W, Medals Yearbook, (1981). Page 42.

The medieval castle and subsequent Renaissance palace served as residence for the counts of Hainaut, the dukes of Burgundy and the Habsburg rulers of the Netherlands. The most famous resident has been Mary of Hungary, governor of the Netherlands. It was one of the first renaissance palaces in the Low Countries and was intended to rival the French palace of Fontainebleau. The palace was destroyed by soldiers of king Henry II of France. Today, only some medieval walls and fundaments remain of the castle and palace. History Baldwin IV, Count of Hainaut, also known as Baldwin the Builder, constructed the first castle in Binche in the 12th century. At the same time, he surrounded the city by large walls, which are almost entirely preserved till modern times. The ch√¢teau was known as the \\"Ch√¢teau de la Salles\\" during the 15th century. Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, restored the castle in 1461. Margaret of York, widow of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, received Binche as a dowry. She extended the castle around 1500. Article on Binche Castle on www.castles.nl - accessed on 28 April 2019 Mary of Hungary became governess of the Netherlands in 1528. She often stayed in Binche, which soon became one of her favourite residences. Her brother, Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, presented the city and the imperial estate of Binche to her in 1545. Mary decided to raze the medieval castle to the ground and to construct a magnificent and sumptuous palace in its place. It was one of the first Renaissance palaces in the Netherlands. The architect Jacques du Broeucq was responsible for the design. He also constructed for Mary a hunting lodge close by to Binche in Morlanwelz, called Mariemont Palace (literally, the palace on the hill of Mary). The construction of Binche palace took three years, and the building looked very similar to a renaissance castle earlier designed and constructed by Du Broeucq in Boussu. Of the old medieval castle, only the wing renovated by Margaret of York remained. The palace complex consisted of two towers and a two-story main building and two additional one-story wings. In addition, there was a chapel. There were various halls, a grand and a small gallery, dining rooms, kitchens, stables and other buildings. Most impressive were the large hall on the first floor (30*13,5 meters) and the 'riche logis' of Mary (18*9 meters). The palace was hailed as one of the wonders of the world. Jacqueline Kerkhoff, Maria van Hongarije en haar hof 1505-1558: tot plichtsbetrachting uitverkoren (Hilversum) 2008 In 1549, Mary receives Charles V and her nephew, the future king Philip II. The year before, the aging emperor decided to have has son recognized as successor by the various principalities in his empire. The imperial procession arrives in Binche on 22 August 1549. Mary was aware of the importance of the event and organized a grand reception: parties, balls and tournaments followed each other for six days. Upon return to Spain, king Philipp II was so impressed by Binche palace that it served as inspiration for the construction of the royal palaces in Aranjuez, El Pardo, and Valsain. Shortly after these festivities, the old conflict between Spain and France flared up again. In the spring of 1554, the imperial army entered Picardy. Amongst others, they destroyed the favourite palace of the French king, the ch√¢teau of Folembray. The French, however, counterattacked. On 21 July they invaded Binche and Mariemont, both palaces were set on fire in retaliation. It was Henry II himself who lit the fire and had a plaque attached to the ruins: \\"Queen of foolishness, remember Folembray!\\" Parts of the palace were saved from destruction. Restoration work started already in 1554, but stopped when Mary left the Netherlands in 1556 to go to Spain together with her brother after his resignation. Under Archdukes Albert and Isabella of Habsburg, sovereign of the Netherlands, a restoration was attempted but failed to reach completion as the palace of Mariemont was restored as well, and the palace of Binche fell out of grace. A number of sculpted pieces were sent to Mons (such as the entrance gate) or were reused in Binche itself. In the second half of the 17th century, the palace fell into ruins and around 1704, the palace was demolished. A public park was created on the remains in the 19th century. Large parts of the palace were excavated and examined by the archaeological department of Wallonia in the 20th century. Bibliography * Samuel Glot: \\"De Marie de Hongrie aux Gilles de Binche.

After winning his only race as a juvenile in 2014 he developed into a top-class performer in the following year when he won the Tokino Minoru Kinen and finished second in the Spring Stakes, Satsuki Sho St Lite Kinen and Kikuka Sho as well as running fourth in the Japanese Derby. He reached his peak as a four-year-old in 2016 when he won the Dubai Turf and ran second in the Tenno Sho. He remained in training for two more years, winning the Mainichi Okan in 2017 and running third in the 2018 Dubai Turf. Background Real Steel is a bay horse standing 1.67 metres high, with a white star and four white socks bred in Hokkaido, Japan by Northern Farm. During his racing career he was owned by Sunday Racing and trained by Yoshito Yahagi. He was from the fifth crop of foals sired by Deep Impact, who was the Japanese Horse of the Year in 2005 and 2006, winning races including the Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho, Arima Kinen and Japan Cup. Deep Impact's other progeny include Gentildonna, Harp Star, Kizuna, A Shin Hikari, Marialite and Saxon Warrior. Real Steel's dam Loves Only Me, a half-sister to Rumplestiltskin, was trained in Ireland but never raced and was exported to Japan after being sold for $900,000 at Keeneland in November 2009. She was a granddaughter of the outstanding racehorse and broodmare Miesque. She has also produced the Yushun Himba winner Loves Only You. Racing career =2014: two-year-old season= Real Steel began his racing career on 27 December 2014 when he contested an event for previously unraced juveniles over 1800 metres at Hanshin Racecourse. Running on firm ground he won by more than three lengths from Liberator. =2015: three-year-old season= For his three-year-old debut Real Steel was stepped up in class to contest the Grade 3 Tokino Minoru Kinen (a trial race for the Satsuki Sho) over 1800 metres at Tokyo Racecourse on 15 February and started the 5.1/1 second favourite behind Sunday Racing's other runner Duramente. Ridden as in all of his race that year by Yuichi Fukunaga he won by half a length from Duramente with Ambitious in third place. Five weeks later at Nakayama Racecourse the colt started favourite for the Spring Stakes but in a slowly run race he was beaten a neck by Kitasan Black with third place going to Danon Platina. In the Satsuki Sho over 2000 metres at Nakayama on 19 April Real Steel briefly took the lead in the straight before being overtaken and finishing second to Duramente with Kitasan Black in third and the favoured Satono Crown coming home sixth. The colt was then stepped up in distance for the 82nd running of the Tokyo Yushun over 2400 metres at Tokyo on 31 May in which he started second favourite and came home fourth behind Duramente, Satono Rasen and Satono Crown. After a break of almost four months, Real Steel returned on 27 September for the St Lite Kinen (a trial race for the Kikuka Sho) over 2400 metres at Hanshin. Starting the odds-on favourite he raced in mid-division before finishing strongly but was unable to catch Lia Fail and was beaten two lengths into second place. On 25 October the colt was made second favourite for the Kikuka Sho over 3000 metres at Kyoto Racecourse. After tracking the leading group he moved into contention entering the straight but despite producing an \\"impressive kick\\" in the last 200 metres he failed by a neck to overhaul Kitasan Black. In the 2015 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Real Steel was given a rating of 116, making the 139th best racehorse in the world. =2016: four-year-old season= Real Steels's trainer Yoshito Yahagi Real Steel began his third campaign on 28 February 2016 when he finished a close third behind Duramente and Ambitious in the Grade 2 Nakayama Kinen over 1800 metres with the unplaced runners including Logotype and Isla Bonita. The colt was then sent to the United Arab Emirates to contest the Dubai Turf on 26 March at Meydan Racecourse. Ridden by Ryan Moore he started at odds of 8/1 in an international field of fifteen runners. Godolphin's Jebel Hatta winner Tryster went off favourite, while the other contenders included Intilaaq (Rose of Lancaster Stakes), Very Special (Balanchine), Forries Waltz (Al Rashidiya), The Corsican (Arc Trial), Euro Charline (Beverly D. Stakes), Ertijaal (Cape Derby) and Flamboyant (San Marcos Stakes). Real Steel tracked the leaders on the outide as the 66/1 outsider Ghaamer set the early pace. Very Special went to the front 600 metres from the finish but Real Steel gained the advantage 200 metres out and kept on well to win by half a length from Euro Charline. Real Steel's trainer Yoshito Yahagi said after the race \\"I am elated and speechless. I am blessed with this horse and the people around me who have supported him\\". Ryan Moore commented \\"He's a beautiful horse, he's got lots of quality. It was a big effort from the horse, he had a tough trip and was out wide but has toughed it out. He never runs a bad race. He's a very brave horse and has had to do it the hard way\\". On his return to Japan Real Steel was dropped back in distance for the Grade 1 Yasuda Kinen over 1600 metres in which he started second favourite but was outpaced in the straight and came home eleventh of the twelve runners, six lengths behind the winner Logotype. After a four and a half month summer break the colt returned for the autumn edition of the Tenno Sho over 2000 metres at Tokyo. Ridden by Mirco Demuro he came from the rear of the field with a late run on the outside to take second place, one and a half lengths behind the winner Maurice. On his final start of the year Real Steel was made the 3.2/1 second favourite for the Japan Cup over 2400 metres at Tokyo on 27 November. After tracking the leaders he kept on well in the straight without looking likely to win and came home fifth of the seventeen runners behind Kitasan Black, Sounds of Earth, Cheval Grand and Gold Actor. In the 2016 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Real Steel was ranked the 34th best racehorse in the world with a rating of 120. =2017: five-year-old season= Real Steel win the 2017 Mainichi Okan Real Steel began his 2017 season in the Nakayama Kinen, as in the previous year, but on this occasion he ran poorly and came home eighth of the eleven runners behind Neorealism. He was expected to defend the Dubai Turf on 25 March but was withdrawn from the race when he bled from his nostrils after a training gallop. He was off the track for over seven months before making his comeback in the Mainichi Okan over 1800 metres at Tokyo on 8 October. Ridden by Mirco Demuro he was made the 4.8/1 third choice in the betting behind Soul Stirring and Makahiki in a twelve-runner field which also included Satono Aladdin (Yasuda Kinen) and One And Only (Tokyo Yushun). After racing in mid-division on the outside he made steady progress in the straight, took the lead 100 metres from the finish and held off the late challenge of Satono Aladdin to win by a neck. Three weeks later he contested the autumn running of the Tenno Sho for the second time and finished fourth behind Kitasan Black, Satono Crown and Rainbow Line. Real Steel finished 129th 2017 World's Best Racehorse Rankings with a rating of 117. =2018: six-year-old season= On his first appearance of 2018, Real Steel was sent back to Dubai in an attempt to repeat his 2016 victory in the Dubai Turf and started at odds of 10/1 in a 15-runner field. Partnered by Mickael Barzalona he stayed on strongly in the closing stages to dead heat with Deirdre for third place behind Benbatl and Vivlos. Barzalona said \\"He turned in a good race, but he just didn‚Äôt have enough.\\" In his second attempt to win the Yasuda Kinen on 3 June, Real Steel failed to reproduce his best form and trailed home towards the rear of the sixteen- runner field. He was retired shortly after the race when he sustained a torn ligament in his right foreleg. Real Steel's mark of 116 placed him 163rd in the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings with a rating of 117.

He served as a Uganda Army (UA) commander during the dictatorship of Idi Amin. When Amin was overthrown in 1979 during the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War, Tiyua was imprisoned by the new Ugandan government. He was freed in 1985, when Tito Okello overthrew Ugandan President Milton Obote. When Okello was defeated by Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army, Tiyua joined an insurgency in northern Uganda, and eventually rose to deputy commander of the West Nile Bank Front rebel group. Following years of warfare, Tiyua was captured by rebels allied to the Ugandan government in southern Sudan in 1997, and was again incarcerated. After being released in 2000, he became chairman of a veterans association and has lobbied for his former rebel comrades to end their insurgency.  Biography  = Early life and career = Tiyua was born as a member of the Kakwa people in Maracha District, part of the West Nile Province of Uganda. He joined the Uganda Army in 1961, and was lieutenant by 1971. When Army commander Idi Amin ousted President Milton Obote in the 1971 coup d'√©tat and installed himself as dictator, Tiyua remained in the military. Tiyua considered it his duty to obey the Commander-in-Chief, and thus did not question Amin's dictatorship. By 1977, he had risen to lieutenant colonel and commanded the 2nd Infantry Battalion, better known as Gonda Battalion, stationed in Moroto. = Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War = Map of the battles of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War When the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War broke out in October 1978, Tiyua served as second-in-command to Yefusa Bananuka who officially headed the Gonda Battalion by this point. Tiyua was sent with parts of the Gonda Battalion to the Tanzanian border to aid the Ugandan Invasion of Kagera, while Bananuka stayed behind in eastern Uganda. Tanzania repelled the invasion, and launched a counter-offensive in January 1979 that targeted the border town of Mutukula. By this time, Tiyua had risen to lieutenant colonel, and once again served as second-in-command to Bananuka who had finally joined the troops at the front. The Battle of Mutukula went badly for the Ugandans who were overwhelmed by the Tanzanian forces in a matter of hours. While the fighting was still ongoing, the Gonda Battalion retreated against the orders of the Ugandan high command. Tiyua subsequently stated that Bananuka had ordered the withdrawal, whereas the latter accused Tiyua of lying and being responsible for the retreat. By March 1979, Tiyua was serving as commander of the Eastern Brigade, stationed at Mbale in eastern Uganda. On 2 March 1979, Ugandan insurgents loyal to ex-President Obote launched a raid into Uganda from Kenya, attacking the town of Tororo. Part of its garrison revolted and defected to the attackers. In course of the following battle, the rebels captured Tororo. Upon hearing of this, Tiyua rallied his troops and launched a counter-attack alongside other Ugandan military units, routing the insurgents and retaking Tororo on 4 March. This marked one of the few Ugandan victories during the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War. On 8 April 1979, President Amin personally visited Tororo, and promoted Tiyua to brigadier for his role in the fighting. Uganda's military situation continued to deteriorate over the following weeks. On 10 April, the Tanzanians and their rebel allies assaulted Kampala, the Ugandan capital, and Amin fled his home country. Before escaping via airplane to Libya, Amin travelled to Mbale, where he urged Tiyua and his men to continue fighting. Tiyua obeyed this order, although most of his troops deserted in the next days. Realizing that he could offer no more resistance to the advancing Tanzanians, Tiyua and about 100 of his remaining troops crossed the border to Kenya. They hoped to reach Sudan by foot, and then travel back to their home areas in the West Nile sub-region. The Kenyans arrested Tiyua and his soldiers, however, and they were extradited to Uganda. = Imprisonment, opposition and later life = A kitchen at the Luzira Maximum Security Prison before its renovation in the 2000s As he had been one of the last Uganda Army commanders to lay down his weapons, Uganda's new government under Yusuf Lule (and later restored President Obote) considered Tiyua a criminal. He was imprisoned at the Maximum Security Prison of Luzira, and condemned to death without court procedure. Tiyua stated that he and other prisoners were mistreated and were not given adequate access to food, space, or medicine. He remained on the prison's death row until 1985, when Obote was overthrown by Tito Okello amid the Ugandan Bush War. Okello released Tiyua and other political prisoners, and he returned to his family's home in Arua District. Okello's military government was in turn overthrown by Yoweri Museveni's National Resistance Army in 1986. Instead of waiting to see how the new regime would treat him, Tiyua opted to flee into southern Sudan. At the time, rumours circulated that Museveni hated the former Uganda Army soldiers from the West Nile region. Museveni's private army FRONASA had committed several massacres against Muslims and people from West Nile during the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War. Believing that Museveni intended to kill West Nile natives, Tiyua decided to join the Uganda People's Democratic Army (UPDA), a rebel alliance formed by ex-forces of various former Ugandan governments. The UPDA soon split, and Tiyua joined the Former Uganda National Army (FUNA). He served as one of the group's leaders by 1990, serving alongside Isaac Lumago and Dusman Sabuni. Tiyua eventually became the deputy commander of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), serving as its \\"chief administrator\\" under the overall leadership of Juma Oris. Tiyua later claimed that he regretted joining the anti-Museveni rebellion, retrospectively regarding it as \\"time and life lost\\" fighting a \\"futile war\\". Drawn into numerous regional wars, including the Second Sudanese Civil War, the WNBF's fortunes declined over time. In March 1997, the group suffered a major defeat during Operation Thunderbolt. Tiyua and several of his fighters were captured by SPLA rebels in the Sudanese city of Yei on 13 March 1997. The SPLA was allied to Museveni, and extradited Tiyua to Uganda. After initially being detained in Kampala, Tiyua was again incarcerated in the Maximum Security Prison of Luzira, but expressed his hope that Museveni would pardon him. Though set free on 21 April 1999, he was immediately re-arrested, and was finally released on 21 June 2000. Following his release, Tiyua became the chairman of an ex-combatants association in Arua. Since then, he has lobbied for former WNBF fighters who still live as insurgents to lay down their weapons. In 2009, President Museveni promised to provide 250 million Ugandan shilling (~127,500 USD) to maintain Tiyua's office as well as 5 million USh (~2,500 USD) for every ex-WNBF fighter as gratuity. The Ugandan government subsequently organized \\"resettlement packages\\" for ex-rebels in the West Nile sub-region, consisting of 250,000 USh and some goods, but soon suspended the distribution of theses packages due to many ex-insurgents reportedly cheating the system by presenting family members as former combatants to get more than they were due. Tiyua condemned the suspension, arguing that there were many more former rebels than the government admitted, and that the ex-combatants were not cheating the system. In subsequent years, Tiyua publicly urged the Ugandan government to pay WNBF veterans a regular pension to ensure that they would not resume their insurgency. The government eventually agreed to do so in 2018, whereupon Tiyua applauded its decision.  Personal life  Tiyua is a Muslim and has several children and grandchildren. His daughters include professional sprinter Leni Shida and Animu Angupale, who served as Arua District Woman MP in the Seventh Parliament of Uganda.

A common characteristic of advocacy for both LGBT rights and access to cannabis is that before about 2000 both were outside legal approval, social approval, and were on the fringe of society everywhere, and still are in much of the world. Advocacy for the two issues combined for various reasons, including claims that cannabis is an effective treatment for relieving symptoms of AIDS, the LGBT community having leadership in matters of social tolerance and diversity of lifestyles, and for both LGBT and cannabis issues experiencing social grouping together as counterculture. By issue =Medical= In the timeline of HIV/AIDS at the start of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s there were not available pharmaceutical treatments to address the disease or provide relief of the symptoms. Many people could use medical cannabis to get relief that they could not get in any other way. However, at that time cannabis was illegal in many places. Because LGBT+ people were disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS, the LGBT community had a new and urgent need for access to cannabis. activism for LGBT+ rights began to overlap with activism for access to cannabis. This LGBT activism for cannabis sometimes organized as clubs or social networks through which people with cannabis would distribute it to people with AIDS. In 1990 a news report claimed that many people with HIV use cannabis for palliative care. LGBT and HIV activism greatly increased public support for access to cannabis. Harvey Milk and Dennis Peron were San Francisco-based LGBT political figures who proposed legislation for legalizing cannabis to benefit the LGBT community and others. =Marketplace= There is evidence which suggests that the business sector which invests into cannabis production and sales has a lower percentage of LGBT representation than the consumer market for cannabis products. There are also success stories of LGBT people in the cannabis industry and advocacy organizations like Proud Mary Network. Analysis recommends marketing cannabis to LGBT communities. In the United States Political commentators in the United States have compared the rapid changing of public opinion in the 2000s-10s on the issues of LGBT rights and access to cannabis. Whereas before around 2000 both subjects were taboo in the mainstream, after that time there has been a growing trend to normalize social acceptance of both LGBT people and cannabis use. Many media outlets compared the similarities of LGBT and cannabis advocacy. In the years leading to changes many reputed authorities incorrectly assessed public support for both LGBT and cannabis to be lower than it was. Federal laws in the United States were more misaligned than state laws on these subjects.

Going to School in East Asia. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007. , 9780313336331. p. 107.

The administrations of several schools which historically were EMI that were forced to become CMI opposed the move. In 2009 Hong Kong authorities allowed CMI schools to have special EMI classes. David C. S. Li wrote in Multilingual Hong Kong: Languages, Literacies and Identities that this action was \\"blurring\\" the distinctions between the two styles of schools.Li, David C.S.

This usage and a decrease in English fluency in the late 20th century were factors persuading pre-Handover British Hong Kong authorities to promote CMI education. many schools having EMI programming are also classified as direct subsidy scheme (DSS) schools.

They were built in 1962 by Alco for SEK and were put into operation at OSE in 1971, when it was founded. It is the first diesel loco in regular use in Greece while at the same time they are the first diesel locomotive of the network and a leader of the ALCo family in Greece. Their advent was marked by the great progress towards changing the railway and the gradual abolition of the steam locomotives. It looks much like the A.321 and A.9101 classes. The main difference from these machines is the appearance, since most A.201 were later rebuild, while A.321 and A.9101 remained the same, but it had the same gauge as A.321 (Standard), same speed as A.9101, while all three have the same manufacturers, while they are diesel-powered, while in total there are 10 such locomotive.

The powertrain is electric. The weight in a running order was 64 tonnes while the axle configuration is Bo Bo. When it was used for passenger routes, for the winter season, the locomotives were equipped with a boiler for the production of steam for heating in passenger cars. It is characteristic that in the locomotives cabins to date there is the metallic sign of the Greek-American friendship.  Route  Today, only 7 locomotibes are available, and these are A.201, A.204, A.205, A.206, A.208, A.209 and A.210 for shounting and local transport. Three were destroyed (A-202, A-203 and A-207), the remnants of the A-203 are still deposited in Thessaloniki since April 1998.  History  = 1960-1980 = In 1961, SEK made a purchase of 10 diesel locomotives. The new engines of the Greek Railways undertake the attraction of fast passenger and commercial trains on the Piraeus-Thessaloniki axis. In the early years, they were almost always coupled with another engine in double coupling due to their low power. With the receipt of the newest and most powerful types, such as the A-300 and A-320 classes, they will take on local and regional routes while their use will be extended to the Macedonian-Thrace network. Such a train, headed by A-207, will be involved in the long-term Doxaras accident on January 16, 1972. Later on, they will take over the fast links of the lines of Florina and Kozani. The locomotives will remain on passenger routes until the end of the 1990s on local routes. Meanwhile, the authentic green coloration with the red stripes will be replaced with the classic orange with white. = 1990s-today = By the end of the decade, they were still used on the Strymonos-Koulatas and Eidomeni-Gevgeli lines. In December 2000, the A-205 replaced a Ganz DMU series AA90 in the Larissa-Volos line. However, they are later abandoned by the passenger. However, they do not follow the fate of the remaining rows that are withdrawn, and the remaining 7 engines remain in the strength of OSE, who has decided to take advantage of their second property as a maneuvering machine and local transport. Later, the engines will undergo a lightweight rebuild, with a new cab, driving steam for better visibility during shounting, and a new sophisticated engine that was completed in 2010. The modification of their head-ons was considered unsightly. their new nickname was Pluto due to similarity to the cartoon by the same name. Only A-204 survived the interventions..  Livery  Class A.201 locomotive as it was before the modifications. Here is A.204 at the Rentis Depot in 2007 The livery of the locomotives consists of orange-red horizontal strips on a green color covering the largest surface of the vehicles. In the head-ons the strips join together, forming a triangle. This coloring was their original coloring before joining OSE. Now all A.201 diesel engines in Greece are painted orange with white stripes, although from the late 1990s onwards they returned to their old coloring.

It was a summer residence and hunting loge of the Prince-Electors and Archbishops of Trier. It was destroyed by French revolutionary troops in 1794. Today nothing is left. History Prince Elector Franz Georg von Sch√∂nborn constructed Schloss Sch√∂nbornslust as a hunting lodge between 1748 and 1752. The design was based on plans by Balthasar Neumann and the construction was supervised by his pupil Johanness Seiz. The electoral summer residence was completed in baroque style. It consisted of a single winged building with 21 windows on the front, an orangery and some smaller auxiliary buildings . It was last completed palace of Balthasar Neumann. After the start of the French Revolution in 1789, Elector Clemens Wenzeslaus von Sachsen offered refuge in the palace to members of the French royal family (King Louis XVI was his nephew). Also, he allowed Koblenz to become a centre of French monarchism. After the emigrants left the palace, the Prussian king Frederick William II stayed there for a few days in July 1792. Later, the palace was converted into a military hospital for Austrian soldiers. In the First Coalition War in October 1794, the French revolutionary army approached Koblenz from the North after the battle of Fleurus. Schloss Sch√∂nbornslust was in the middle of the fighting and was destroyed. After looting, the palace ruins were sold together and in 1806 completely broken off and leveled. Two economic buildings are located near the former monastery ' Maria Trost' '. Today there is a dense industrial area on the location of the palace.

The New England Quarterly. 60: 370 ‚Äì via JSTOR.  Courtship and marriage to Edward Dickinson  In 1826, Edward Dickinson, who was training to be a lawyer in Amherst, Massachusetts, traveled up to Monson on legal business and met Emily Norcross. She caught his attention, and the two struck up a lengthy correspondence.Ibid, 373. Over two years, they wrote ninety-three letters to one another, with Edward writing sixty-nine and Emily writing twenty-four. Edward constantly showed his affection for Emily in his letters, whereas Emily was the much more laconic in her replies.Pollack, Vivian (1988). A Poet's Parents. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. pp. xviii. She knew that her lack of enthusiasm frustrated Edward and wasn't afraid to let him know it, writing once in a letter \\"Frequent repetition of my disobedience I trust will not exhaust your patience, which I think has been faithfully tried.\\"Norcross, Emily (5 January 1828). ‚ÄúMonson Saturday Morn‚Äù(Letter).

Retrieved 2019-04-27. Her husband's busy career as a lawyer and as the treasurer of nearby Amherst College meant that she often stayed home with her children, which made her often feel isolated and lonely.Pollack, Vivian (1988). A Poet's Parents. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. pp. xx. In 1855, she endured a particularly troubling period of depression.\\"Emily Norcross Dickinson (1804-1882), mother  Emily Dickinson Museum\\". www.emilydickinsonmuseum.org. Retrieved 2019-04-27. She spent most of her time at home, either taking care of her household or tending her garden, which was her biggest passion in life. She suffered a stroke in 1874 from which she never truly recovered, and spent the remainder of her years paralyzed until her death in November 1882.Ibid.  Relationship with Emily Dickinson  Emily Norcross Dickinson never developed a deep relationship with her daughter Emily, who found her mother uninteresting and boring.

Goode was elected the first African American mayor of Philadelphia. Background Before the election, a total of eighteen black mayors had been elected in United States cities with populations above 100,000. At the time, there were incumbent black mayors in three of the other five United States cities with populations above 1 million people, Los Angeles (Tom Bradley), Chicago (Harold Washington), and Detroit (Coleman Young). No Republican, and only Democrats, had been elected mayor since after the 1947 Philadelphia mayoral election. At the time, blacks made up roughly 39% of registered voters in the city. White voters still outnumbered black voters 2 to 1. Registered Democrats outnumbered registered Republicans in the city by 4 to 1. Democratic primary Goode positioned himself as a candidate that could unite the city. This contrasted with many voters' perception that Rizzo had divided the city along racial and ethnic lines. Goode was fresh-faced, with this being his first campaign for elected office. He was also perceived as an efficient public servant. In the primary, more than 30% of white voters cast their votes for Goode. Race never became a major topic of the campaign. The race saw a record total of votes cast for a Democratic primary. Ronald Brown, the deputy chairman of the Democratic National Committee, appeared at Goode's primary election night victory party at the Philadelphia Convention Center to promise the national party's support for the general election.

The airfield is located south of Maidstone; about southeast of London. Opened in 1943 during the Second World War, it was named RAF Lashenden. It became a prototype for the temporary Advanced Landing Ground airfields that were built in France after D-Day, when the need for advanced landing fields became urgent as the Allied forces moved east across France and Germany. RAF Lashenden was used by the Royal Air Force, Royal Canadian Air Force and United States Army Air Forces before closing in September 1945. After the war, the airfield reverted to farmland until the present private grass airfield was opened in the late 1960s. History It was originally farmland, called Shenley Farm. Headcorn Aerodrome was first used for general aviation in 1927 when the local landowner flew with a group of friends. In 1942 it was requisitioned by the Airfields Board. It was named RAF Lashenden in an attempt to confuse the enemy (Lashenden is to the southwest of the field). Flying started in 1943. The USAAF Ninth Air Force required several temporary Advanced Landing Grounds (ALG) along the channel coast prior to the June 1944 Normandy Landings to provide tactical air support for the ground forces landing in France. The following units were here at some point: * No. 17 (Fighter) Wing RAF * No. 127 Airfield * 353rd Fighter Squadron * 354th Fighter Group * 355th Fighter Squadron * 356th Fighter Squadron * 362nd Fighter Squadron * No. 403 Squadron RAF * No. 421 Squadron RAF With the Americans having left, farming resumed in 1945 but this was not the end of the land's association with aircraft. In the late 1960s, the landowners started using part of the former wartime east-west runway site adjacent to the A274, for private flying. A grass airstrip was built aligned 10/28 with a grass parking area for light aircraft. This led to the formation of Weald Air Services Limited, a small charter company, and later a flying school was set up and the airfield became a busy centre for light flying in the area. Current use The airfield is host to Headcorn Parachute Club, the only skydiving club in Kent. The club operates a Cessna Caravan and regularly flies to altitudes between AGL. The club offers introductory training (tandem, static line/RAPs and AFF). The Tiger Club was also based at the airfield after moving from Redhill Aerodrome in 1990 before moving onto Damyns Hall Aerodrome A small museum of aviation relics was established on the site, the Lashenden Air Warfare Museum. Headcorn Aerodrome has a CAA Ordinary Licence (Number P838) that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction as authorised by the licensee.Civil Aviation Authority Aerodrome Ordinary Licences It is still also sometimes known as Lashenden Aerodrome (the non-directional beacon identifier is \\"LSH\\").

On March 11, 2020, the NBA suspended play of the entire league indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 4, 2020, the NBA Board of Governors approved a restart plan to resume the season on July 30, with approval from the National Basketball Players Association the next day. As a result, the Magic were one of 22 teams that were invited to play eight games each in the NBA Bubble at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida. The games, which were closed to the public, counted towards the regular season to determine the seeding for the 2020 NBA playoffs. On August 8, a loss by the Washington Wizards secured the Magic a playoff berth for the second season in a row. As the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Magic drew top seeded Milwaukee Bucks in the first round of the 2020 NBA playoffs. On August 26, with the Magic facing elimination, the fifth game of the series was postponed as a result of the Milwaukee Bucks boycott in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake. This ultimately resulted in a brief suspension of the entire NBA playoffs. In the days following, games in several other leagues were postponed as players refused to play in solidarity in order to bring further awareness to the Black Lives Matter movement. When game five was eventually played, the Magic lost, ending their season.

The Afghani president has placed a ban on the importation of the spice from Iran due to the quality of the nations export crop initiating a 'soft' war between the two nations. Early education He first learned of the value of Saffron in Iran, where he had immigrated to in 1981 after securing a degree in Agriculture from Kabul University. He was in Kabul when the Soviets invaded in 1979 and he watched as the communist installed government took his fellow students away in the chaos that ensued. Many of those were disappeared from university classrooms. After moving to Iran he was educating rural villagers in cultivation techniques, spending 10 years there before returning to Herat province. Pilot program While the harvesting of the spice is not suitable for all the provinces of Afghanistan, it is a labor- intensive process that lent itself to the abundance of cheap labor in Herat province. In sufficient quantities Saffron can be competitive in price to Afghanistan's other high value crop, the poppies used to harvest Heroin. In 1998 Aslami convinced his then supervisors at a Danish foreign Aid organization (DACAAR) to fund farmers to switch to harvesting the spice crop. Given a $100 grant, he convinced 4 farmers to begin planting the perennial bulbs from which the flower is the product that the stigmatas are gleaned by hand in the early AM. This period, as the Taliban was gaining ground and influence, was where he went from village to village, convincing farmers to take part in his grand vision. Starting with 300sq meters, one of the early farms is currently cultivating 35 acres of the spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, commonly known as the \\"saffron crocus\\". Mostly it is grown in small plots of land and Herat remains the largest producer of the crop in Afghanistan. Saffron is a key seasoning, fragrance, dye, and medicine in use for over three millennia. One of the world's most expensive spices by weight, saffron sells for as much as $700 per pound and is referred to as \\"Red Gold\\". Advisor to Afghanistan With the export value of the spice topping $25million annually, the former aid worker has been of value to the government, saffron production in Afghanistan ranks number 3 worldwide, behind Iran and India. This is growing at 20% annually. As the top government advisor on the market in spice, he is at 63, the mild mannered visionary that is responsible for a rare success in agriculture in Afghanistan. He is currently Senior Advisor of the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock in Afghanistan.

Early life  Lotta Linthicum was born in New York City, the daughter of William Oliver Linthicum and Julia Clark Bogardus Linthicum. After her father's death, she and her mother also lived in France and England, where Lotte trained in music, drama, and art. She was photographed by Alfred Stieglitz on one ocean crossing, in 1894. She and her mother had a home in Sconset, The Moorings, which was described as \\"a kind of social headquarters\\" for the summer colony of actors there, \\"full of unique souvenirs\\".

Generally, each serial involves a single set of characters, protagonistic and antagonistic, involved in a single story, which has been edited into chapters after the fashion of serial fiction and the episodes cannot be shown out of order or as a single or a random collection of short subjects. Each chapter was screened at a movie theater for one week, and ended with a cliffhanger, in which characters found themselves in perilous situations with little apparent chance of escape. Viewers had to return each week to see the cliffhangers resolved and to follow the continuing story. Movie serials were especially popular with children, and for many youths in the first half of the 20th century a typical Saturday matinee at the movies included at least one chapter of a serial, along with animated cartoons, newsreels, and two feature films. There were films covering many genres, including crime fiction, espionage, comic book or comic strip characters, science fiction, and jungle adventures. Many serials were Westerns, since those were the least expensive to film. Although most serials were filmed economically, some were made at significant expense. The Flash Gordon serial and its sequels, for instance, were major productions in their times. Serials were action-packed stories that usually involved a hero (or heroes) battling an evil villain and rescuing a damsel in distress. The villain would continually place the hero into inescapable deathtraps, or the heroine would be placed into a deathtrap and the hero would come to her rescue. The hero and heroine would face one trap after another, battling countless thugs and lackeys, before finally defeating the villain. History =Silent era= The Perils of Pauline (1914) The silent era was the zenith of the movie serial. Famous American serials of the silent era include The Perils of Pauline and The Exploits of Elaine made by Path√© Fr√®res and starring Pearl White. Another popular serial was the 119-episode The Hazards of Helen made by Kalem Studios and starring Helen Holmes for the first forty-eight episodes then Helen Gibson for the remainder. Ruth Roland, Marin Sais, Ann Little, and Helen Holmes were also early leading serial queens. Other major studios of the silent era, such as Vitagraph and Essanay Studios, produced serials, as did Warner Bros., Fox, and Universal. Several independent companies (for example, Mascot Pictures) made Western serials. Four silent Tarzan serials were also made. Serials were a popular form of movie entertainment dating back to Edison's What Happened to Mary of 1912. There appear to be older serials, however, such as the 1910 Deutsche Vitaskop 5 episode Arsene Lupin Contra Sherlock Holmes, based upon the Maurice LeBlanc novel, and a possible but unconfirmed Raffles serial in 1911. Europe had its own serials: in France Victorin-Hippolyte Jasset launched his series of Nick Carter films in 1908, and the idea of the episodic crime adventure was developed particularly by Louis Feuillade in Fant√¥mas (1913‚Äì14), Les Vampires (1915), and Judex (1916); in Germany, Homunculus (1916), directed by Otto Rippert, was a six-part horror serial about an artificial creature. Years after their first release, serials gained new life at \\"Saturday Matinees\\", theatrical showings on Saturday mornings aimed directly at children. For that reason, serials are sometimes called \\"Saturday Matinee Serials\\", even though they were originally shown with feature films. =Sound era= The arrival of sound technology made it costlier to produce serials, so that they were no longer as profitable on a flat rental basis. Further, the Great Depression made it impossible for many of the smaller companies that produced serials to upgrade to sound, and they went out of business. Only one serial specialty company, Mascot Pictures, transitioned from silent to sound filmmaking. Universal Pictures also kept its serial unit alive through the transition. In the early 1930s a handful of independent companies tried their hand at making serials, including the once-prolific Weiss Brothers. The Weisses bought a little time when Columbia Pictures decided to take a try at serials, and contracted with them (as Adventure Serials Inc.) to make three chapterplays. They were successful enough that Columbia then established its own serial unit and the Weisses essentially disappeared from the serial scene. This was in 1937, and Columbia was probably inspired by the previous year's serial blockbuster success at Universal, Flash Gordon, the first serial ever to play at a major theater on Broadway; and by the success of that same year of the newly created Republic Pictures, which dedicated itself to a program of serials and westerns, eschewing major productions in their favor. The creation of Republic involved the absorption of Mascot Pictures, so that by 1937, serial production was now in the hands of three companies only ‚Äì Universal, Columbia, and Republic, with Republic quickly becoming the acknowledged leader in quality serial product. Each company turned out four to five serials per year, of 12 to 15 episodes each, a pace they all kept up until the end of World War II when, in 1946, Universal dropped its serial unit along with its B-picture unit and renamed its production department Universal-International Pictures. Republic and Columbia continued unchallenged, with about four serials per year each, Republic fixing theirs at 12 chapters each while Columbia fixed at fifteen. By the mid-1950s, however, episodic television series and the sale of older serials to TV syndicators by all the current and past major sound serial producers, together with the loss of audience attendance at Saturday matinees in general, made serial-making a losing proposition. Terminology Many famous clich√©s of action-adventure movies had their origins in the serials. The popular term cliffhanger was developed as a plot device in film serials (though its origins have been traced by some historians to the Sherlock Holmes stories of Arthur Conan Doyle or the earlier A Pair of Blue Eyes by Thomas Hardy from 1873), and it comes from the many times that the hero or heroine would end up hanging over a cliff, usually as the villain gloated above and waited for them to plummet hundreds of metres to their deaths. Other popular clich√©s included the heroine or hero trapped in a burning building, being trampled by horses, knocked unconscious in a car as it goes over a cliff, crashing in an airplane, and watching as the burning fuse of a nearby bundle of dynamite sparked and sputtered its way towards the deadly explosive (at the beginning of the next chapter the endangered character usually simply got up and walked away with only minor scrapes). Besides the hero or heroine, some terms are used to define villains and supporting players: * The saddle pal or sidekick is the helper or assistant of the hero or heroine. That person is often a bumbling comic relief. * The brains heavy was the character who issues the orders to the henchmen. He often wears a suit, and pretends to be an upright, lawful member of the community. * The action heavy is the assistant or second-in-command to the brains heavy, who usually wears workmanlike duds, does the physical labor, and often has more brawn than brains. He tries to kill the hero with fists, knives, guns, bombs, or whatever else is handy at the time. * The oldtimer is (a) the man who owns the ranch, (b) the father of the hero or heroine, or (c) the wearer of a badge of a sheriff, marshall, or ranger. Production =Peak form= The classic sound serial, particularly in its Republic format, has a first episode of about 30 minutes (approximately three reels in length) and begins with reports of a masked, secret, or unsuspected villain menacing an unspecific part of America. This episode traditionally has the most detailed credits at the beginning, often with pictures of the actors with their names and that of the character they play. Often there follows a montage of scenes lifted from the cliffhangers of previous serials to depict the ways in which the master criminal was a serial killer with a motive. In the first episode, various suspects or \\"candidates\\" who may, in secret, be this villain are presented, and the viewer often hears the voice but does not see the face of this mastermind commanding his \\"lead villain\\", similar to a sergeant, whom the viewer sees in just about every episode. In the succeeding weeks (usually 11 to 14) thereafter, an episode nearly 20 minutes (approximately two reels) in length was presented, in which the \\"lead villain\\" and lesser thugs commit crimes in various places, fight the hero, and trap someone to make the ending a cliffhanger. Many of the episodes have clues, dialogue, and events leading the viewer to think that any of the candidates were the mastermind. As serials were made by writing the whole script first and then slicing it into portions filmed at various sites, often the same location would be used several times in the serial, often given different signage, or none at all, just being referred to differently. There would often be a female love interest of the male hero, or a female hero herself, but as the audience was mainly children, there was no hugging and kissing. The beginning of each chapter would bring the story up to date by repeating the last few minutes of the previous chapter, and then revealing how the main character escaped. Often the reprised scene would add an element not seen in the previous close, but unless it contradicted something shown previously, audiences accepted the explanation. On rare occasions the filmmakers would depend on the audience not remembering details of the previous week's chapter, using alternate outcomes that did not exactly match the previous episode's cliffhanger. The last episode was sometimes a bit longer than most, for its tasks were to unmask the head villain (who usually was someone completely unsuspected), wrap up the loose ends, and end with a triumphal proclamation, followed by a joke ‚Äì and sometimes a kiss (provided that the story supplied a heroine to receive it). In 1938, Republic introduced the \\"economy episode\\" (or \\"recap chapter\\") in which the characters summarize or reminisce about their adventures, so as to introduce showing those scenes again (in the manner of a clip show in modern television). This type of episode usually had a cheap, mechanical cliffhanger, like a time bomb rather than being unconscious in a runaway vehicle. =Production practices= The major studios had their own retinues of actors and writers, their own prop departments, existing sets, stock footage, and music libraries. The early independent studios had none of these, but could rent sets from independent producers of western features. The firms saved money by reusing the same cliffhangers, stunt and special-effects sequences over the years. Mines or tunnels flooded often, even in Flash Gordon, and the same model cars and trains went off the same cliffs and bridges. Republic had a Packard limousine and a Ford Woodie station wagon used in serial after serial so they could match the shots with the stock footage from the model or previous stunt driving. Three different serials had them chasing the Art Deco sound truck, required for location shooting, for various reasons. Male fistfighters all wore hats so that the change from actor to stunt double would not be caught so easily. A rubber liner on the hatband of the stuntman's fedora would make a seal on the stuntman's head, so the hat would stay on during fight scenes. Exposition of what led up to the previous episode's cliffhanger was usually displayed on placards with a photograph of one of the characters on it. In 1938, Universal brought the first \\"scrolling text\\" exposition to the serial, which George Lucas first used in Star Wars in 1977 and then in all of the following Star Wars films. As this would have required subcontracting the optical effects, Republic saved money by not using it. =Stylistic differences between the studios= Universal had been making serials since the 1910s, and continued to service its loyal neighborhood- theater customers with four serials annually. The studio made news in 1929 by hiring Tim McCoy to star in its first all-talking serial, The Indians Are Coming! Epic footage from this western serial turned up again and again in later serials and features. In 1936 Universal scored a coup by licensing the popular comic-strip character Flash Gordon for the screen; the serial was a smash hit, and was even booked into first-run theaters that usually did not bother with chapter plays. Universal followed it up with more pop-culture icons: The Green Hornet and Ace Drummond from radio, and Smilin' Jack and Buck Rogers from newspapers. Universal was more story-conscious than the other studios, and cast its serials with \\"name\\" actors recognizable from feature films: Lon Chaney, Jr., B√©la Lugosi, Dick Foran, The Dead End Kids, Kent Taylor, Robert Armstrong, Irene Hervey, and Johnny Mack Brown, among many others. In the 1940s Universal's serials employed urban and/or wartime themes, incorporating newsreel footage of actual disasters. The 1942 serial Gang Busters is perhaps the best of Universal's urban serials; Universal often cannibalized it for future cliffhangers. Don Winslow of the Navy may exemplify Universal's best war-themed chapterplay. The studio's reliance on stock footage for the big action scenes was certainly economical, but it often hurt the overall quality of the films. When the studio reorganized as Universal- International, it shut down most of the production units, including the serial crew. Universal's last serial was The Mysterious Mr. M (1946). Republic was the successor to Mascot Pictures, a serial specialist. Writers and directors were already geared to staging exciting films, and Republic improved on Mascot, adding music to underscore the action, and staging more elaborate stunts. Republic was one of Hollywood's smaller studios, but its serials have been hailed as some of the best, especially those directed by John English and William Witney. In addition to solid screenwriting that many critics thought was quite accomplished, the firm also introduced choreographed fistfights, which often included the stuntmen (usually the ones portraying the villains, never the heroes) throwing things in desperation at one another in every fight to heighten the action. Republic serials are noted for outstanding special effects, such as large-scale explosions and demolitions, and the more fantastic visuals like Captain Marvel and Rocketman flying. Most of the trick scenes were engineered by Howard and Theodore Lydecker. Republic was able to get the rights to the newspaper comic character Dick Tracy, the radio character The Lone Ranger, and the comic book characters Captain America, Captain Marvel, and Spy Smasher. Republic's serial scripts were written by teams, usually from three to seven writers. From 1950 Republic economized on serial production. The studio was no longer licensing expensive radio and comic-strip characters, and no longer staging spectacular action sequences. To save money, Republic turned instead to its impressive backlog of action highlights, which were cleverly re-edited into the new serials. Most of the studio's serials of the 1950s were written by only one man, Ronald Davidson‚ÄîDavidson had co-written and produced many Republic serials, and was familiar enough with the film library to write new scenes based on the older action footage. Republic's last serial was King of the Carnival (1955), a reworking of 1939's Daredevils of the Red Circle using some of its footage. Columbia made several serials using its own staff and facilities (1938‚Äì1939 and 1943‚Äì1945), and these are among the studio's best efforts: The Spider's Web, The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok, Batman, The Secret Code, and The Phantom maintained Columbia's own high standard. However, Columbia's serials often have a reputation for cheapness, because the studio usually subcontracted its serial production to outside producers: the Weiss Brothers (1937‚Äì1938), Larry Darmour (1939‚Äì1942), and finally Sam Katzman (1945‚Äì1956). Columbia built many serials around name-brand heroes. From newspaper comics, they got Terry and the Pirates, Mandrake the Magician, The Phantom, and Brenda Starr, Reporter; from the comic books, Blackhawk, Congo Bill, time traveler Brick Bradford, and Batman and Superman (although this last owed more to its radio incarnation, which the credits acknowledged); from radio, Jack Armstrong and Hop Harrigan; from the hero pulp characters like The Spider (two serials: The Spider's Web and The Spider Returns) and The Shadow (despite also being a very popular radio series); from the British novelist Edgar Wallace, the first archer-superhero, The Green Archer; and even from television: Captain Video. Columbia's early serials were very well received by audiences‚Äîexhibitors voted The Spider's Web (1938) the number-one serial of the year. Former silent- serial director James W. Horne co-directed The Spider's Web, and his work secured him a permanent position in Columbia's serial unit. Horne had been a comedy specialist in the 1930s, often working with Laurel and Hardy, and most of his Columbia serials after 1939 are played tongue-in-cheek, with exaggerated villainy and improbable heroics (the hero takes on six men in a fistfight and wins). After Horne's death in 1942, the studio's serial output was somewhat more sober, but still aimed primarily at the juvenile audience. Batman (1943) was quite popular, and Superman (1948) was phenomenally successful. Spencer Gordon Bennet, another silent-serial veteran, directed most of the later Columbia serials. His western-themed efforts were suitably accomplished, but Columbia cut corners in every respect until the quality of the serials suffered. Columbia also used cartoon animation instead of more expensive special effects with its science-fiction serials. By the 1950s Columbia serials were very-low-budget affairs, consisting mostly of action scenes and cliffhanger endings from older productions, and even employing the same actors for new scenes tying the old footage together. The new footage was so threadbare that it would often show the new hero watching the action from a distance, rather than actually participating in it. Columbia outlasted the other serial producers, its last being Blazing the Overland Trail (1956). Availability Film serials released to the home video market from original masters include the majority of Republic titles (with a few exceptions, such as Ghost of Zorro)‚Äîwhich were released by Republic Pictures Home Video on VHS and sometimes laserdisc (sometimes under their re-release titles) mostly from transfers made from the original negatives, The Shadow, and Blackhawk, both released by Sony only on VHS, and DVD versions of Flash Gordon, Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars, and Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe (Hearst), Adventures of Captain Marvel (Republic Pictures), Batman and Batman and Robin (Sony), Superman and Atom Man vs. Superman (Warner), and The Green Hornet (VCI). Notable restorations of partially lost or forgotten serials such as The Adventures of Tarzan, Beatrice Fairfax, The Lone Ranger Rides Again, Daredevils of the West and King of the Mounties have been developed and made available to fans by The Serial Squadron. A gray market for DVDs also exists consisting of DVD companies releasing titles from privately owned 16mm prints or even copies of previously released VHS or laserdisc editions, and various websites and internet auctions. These DVDs vary between good and poor quality, depending on their source. In 2017, Adventures of Captain Marvel became the first serial to be released on Blu-ray. Post-1950s serials There have been several post-1950s attempts at reviving or recalling cliffhanger serials, by both fans and professional studios, and serials were often spoofed in cartoons of the 1960s. In the early days of television in the United States, movie serials were often broadcast, one chapter a day, and in the late 1970s and 1980s, they were often revived on BBC television in the United Kingdom. Many have been released in home video formats. The popular Indiana Jones movies are a well-known, romantic pastiche of the serials' plot elements and devices. = Amateur/fan efforts = An early attempt at a low-budget Western serial, filmed in color, was entitled The Silver Avenger. One or two chapters exist of this effort on 16mm film but it is not known whether the serial was ever completed. The best-known fan-made chapter play is the four-chapter, silent 16mm Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates, made to resemble Republic and Columbia serials of the 1940s and completed in 1966. The plot involved a masked villain named The Master Duper, one of three members of a Film Commission who attempts to steal the only known prints of priceless antique films, and the heroic Captain Celluloid, who wears a costume reminiscent of that of the Black Commando in the Columbia serial The Secret Code and is determined to uncover him. Roles in the serial are played by, among others, film historians and serial fans Alan G. Barbour, Al Kilgore, and William K. Everson. In the 1970s, serial fan Blackie Seymour shot a complete 15-chapter serial called The Return of the Copperhead. Seymour's only daughter, who operated the camera at the age of 8, attests that as of 2008 the serial was indeed filmed but the raw footage remains in cans, unedited. In 2001, King of the Park Rangers, a one-chapter sound serial was released by Cliffhanger Productions on VHS video tape in sepia. It concerned the adventures of a Park Ranger named Patricia King and an FBI Agent who track down a trio of killers out to find buried treasure in the New Jersey Pine Barrens. A second ten- chapter serial, The Dangers of Deborah, in which a female reporter and a criminologist fight to uncover the identity of a mysterious villain named The Terror, was released by Cliffhanger Productions in 2008. In 2006, Lamb4 Productions created its own homage to the film serials of the 1940s with its own serial titled \\"Wildcat.\\" The story revolves around a super hero named Wildcat and his attempts to save the fictional Rite City from a masked villain known as the Roach. This eight-chapter serial was based heavily on popular super hero serials such as \\"Batman and Robin,\\" \\"Captain America,\\" and \\"The Adventures of Captain Marvel.\\" After its premiere, \\"Wildcat\\" was posted on the official Lamb4 Productions YouTube channel for public viewing. \\"Wildcat\\" Movie Serial Official Site = Studio/commercial efforts, cartoons, and spoofery = The serial format was used with stories on the original run of The Mickey Mouse Club (1955‚Äì58), with each chapter running about six to ten minutes. The longer-running dramatic serials included \\"Corky and White Shadow\\", \\"The Adventures of Spin and Marty\\", \\"The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure\\", \\"The Boys of the Western Sea\\", \\"The Secret of Mystery Lake\\", \\"The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of Ghost Farm\\", and The Adventures of Clint and Mac. Other Disney programs shown on Walt Disney Presents in segments (such as The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh, The Swamp Fox, The Secret of Boyne Castle, The Mooncussers, and The Prince and the Pauper) and Disney feature films (including Treasure Island; The Three Lives of Thomasina; The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men; Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue; and The Fighting Prince of Donegal) edited into segments for television presentation often had a cliffhanger-serial-like feel. In England, in the 1950s and 60s, low-budget six-chapter serials such as Dusty Bates and Masters of Venus were released theatrically, but these were not particularly well-regarded or remembered. The greatest number of serialized television programs to feature any single character were those made featuring The Doctor, the BBC character introduced in 1963. Doctor Who serials would run anywhere from 3 to 12 episodes and were shown in weekly segments, as had been the original theatrical cliffhangers. Doctor Who was syndicated in the US as early as 1974, but did not gain a following in America until the mid-1980s when episodes featuring Tom Baker reached its shores. The 1960s cartoon show Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle included two serial-style episodes per program. These spoofed the cliffhanger serial form. Within the Rocky and Bullwinke show, the recurring but non- serialized Dudley Do-Right, specifically parodied the damsel in distress (Nell Fenwick) being tied to railroad tracks by arch villain Snidely Whiplash and rescued by the noble but clueless Dudley. The Hanna‚ÄìBarbera Perils of Penelope Pitstop was a takeoff on the silent serials The Perils of Pauline and The Iron Claw, which featured Paul Lynde as the voice of the villain Sylvester Sneakley, alias \\"The Hooded Claw\\". Danger Island, a multi-part story in under-10-minute episodes, was shown on the Saturday morning Banana Splits program in the late 1960s. Episodes were short, full of wild action and usually ended on a cliffhanger. This serial was directed by Richard Donner and featured the first African American action hero in a chapter play. The violence present in most of the episodes, though much of it was deliberately comical and would not be considered shocking today, also raised concerns at a time when violence in children's TV was at issue. On February 27, 1979, NBC broadcast the first episode of an hour-long weekly television series Cliffhangers!, which had three segments, each with a different serial: a horror story (The Curse of Dracula, starring Michael Nouri), a science fiction/western (The Secret Empire, (inspired by 1935's The Phantom Empire) starring Geoffrey Scott as Marshal Jim Donner and Mark Lenard as Emperor Thorval) and a mystery (Stop Susan Williams!, starring Susan Anton, Ray Walston as Bob Richards, and Albert Paulsen as the villain Anthony Korf). Though final episodes were shot, the series was canceled and the last program aired on May 1, 1979 before all of the serials could conclude; only The Curse of Dracula was resolved. In 2006, Dark Horse Indie films, through Image Entertainment, released a 6-chapter serial parody called Monarch of the Moon, detailing the adventures of a hero named the Yellow Jacket, who could control Yellow Jackets with his voice, battled \\"Japbots\\", and traveled to the moon. The end credits promised a second serial, Commie Commandos From Mars. Dark Horse attempted to promote the release as a just-found, never-before-released serial made in 1946, but suppressed by the US Government.

He is known for his composition paintings where figures of horse, castle and woman dominate.  Life  Haki Xhakli was born on 3 October 1952 in Ferizaj, where he attended his early education. In 1978 he graduated from the Academy of Figurative Arts in University of Prishtina, where he studied painting in the class of professor Rexhep Ferri. From 1982-1988 he was leading the Artist's Association Zef Kolombi in Ferizaj. Since 1984 he has been a member of the Association of Figurative Artists of Kosovo,\\"Kosova Monography\\", Academy of Science and Arts of Kosova, pp.572‚Äì575. which he chaired from 2006 to 2008. He has been working at the Faculty of Education since 2005, where he teaches art methodology to undergraduates and graduates, with the title of Professor Assistant at the University of Prishtina. In 2010 he received a Doctoral Degree on Social Sciences at University of Skopje. In 2016 he served temporarily as the Dean of Faculty of Education at University of Prishtina. Xhakli was also a national coordinator for curriculum development of art education in Kosovo organised by Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (Kosovo) from 2002 until 2012.  Exhibitions  Xhakli participated in several international collective exhibitions and opened personal ones in Kosovo, Italy, Germany, France, Netherlands, Serbia, Macedonia and Albania. In Kosovo, he had ten solo exhibitions and participated in forty four (44) collective exhibitions. * 1983 Culture House, Ferizaj, Kosovo * 1993 Cafe Gallery ‚ÄúKata‚Äù, Ferizaj, Kosovo * 1994 Cafe ‚ÄúBolero‚Äù, Ferizaj, Kosovo * 1995 SHKA ‚ÄúAgimi‚Äù, Prizren, Kosovo * 1996 Gallery ‚ÄúRada‚Äù, Prizren, Kosovo * 1999 Hellweg-Museum, Unna, Germany * 1999 Katharinen-Hoff, Unna, Germany * 2000 Art Gallery, Ferizaj, Kosovo * 2002 Culture House, Ka√ßanik, Kosovo * 2003 Gallery of Ministry of Culture, Prishtina, Kosovo * 2006 Gallery of Ministry of Culture, Prishtina, Kosovo * 2011 National History Museum, Tirana, Albania * 2014 Show Your Hope, Eindhoven, The Netherlands * 2016 Embassy of Kosovo, Berlin, Germany * 2020 Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo, Prishtina, Kosovo During his career he spent time in Florence, Italy and Unna, Germany where he was a personal tutor of painters Ilona Hetmann Ilona Hetmann Ilona Hetmann, accessdate: May 2, 2019 and Hans Wegener.Hans Wegener : Kunstraum Unna: Hans Wegener : Kunstraum Unna, accessdate: May 2, 2019  Work  Apocalypse The symbols that Haki Xhakli communicates in his paintings are universal and autochthonous. Universal to the fact, as they are transposed well into the fabric and very accessible to understand for the general public and indigenous to the author's region as each figure and every single painting line comes from the experience of daily lives to the bloodshed history of author's nation. The inevitable symbol which is present in almost every painting of the artist is the horse. It's unique drawing brings up multiple associations with everyday life. It is portrayed as the symbol of faithfulness, but also of the burden that holds upon itself. It is very visible the inescapable feeling of alertness and vigilance that the horse symbol represents. With this detail, the artist reminds the audience for the struggles of the Albanian people for centuries, who could never sleep quietly, be comfortable and had to watch out on every side from dangers coming from conquerors nearby claiming the domination over the soil of artist's nation. In line with the horse symbol and its head, there is the symbol of the castle that connects well with high rooftops and small turrets, this symbolises the national resistance and the never-ending danger from various occupants. It's shielded walls used as a protection from enemies indicates the coldness of the stones absorbing from outside and the warmth inside that is offered through hospitality to every friend. The last piece of the triangle on his painting symbols is the personality of the woman, described as the symbol of human renewal. Painted as pretty, with a focus on the eyes, his paintings give a precise perspective thought where woman's sacrifice to save humankind is visible. In the woman's eyes in the paintings, you can read numerous stories, blunders, desires, goals, even tragedies, and troubles. The woman in Xhakli's paintings never spared herself, regardless of circumstances, and regardless of the absurd situations in which she was. The artist presents her entire spiritual world as it is, extremely grandiose and unobstructed, on one side and very modest on the other side. Through many symbols, he empowers his painting by elevating it to a high degree of universal semiotics, which receives a polysemic message, which then is not difficult to be accepted by artisans regardless of the relevance. One particular painting cycle that Xhakli created is the Apocalypse, as it makes the viewer think that it's the end of the world, in fact, it is portrayed as the end of the dreadful side of the universe.

(22 January 1820 - 28 January 1897) was a General in the Indian Army who served most of his military career in India including in the First Afghan War, the Second Afghan War, the Indian Mutiny and who was Resident at Baroda from 1873 to 1874 during which period the Maharaja Gaikwar, Malhar Rao, precipitated the Baroda Crisis and then attempted to poison Phayre, by putting arsenic and diamond dust in his sherbet. Early career Phayre was severely wounded during the Battle of Miani (1843) He was the son of Richard Phayre and Mary n√©e Ridgeway of Shrewsbury, and a brother of General Sir Arthur Purves Phayre. They were part of the Phayre Family, of which Lt Col Robert Phayre, who served the British administration in Ireland in the 17th-century, also had the death warrant of Charles I addressed to him and two other Colonels. Robert Phayre was educated at Shrewsbury School and commissioned as Ensign in the East India Company's service on 26 January 1839, being posted to the 25th Bombay Native Infantry, and became lieutenant on 1 December 1840. He served in the First Anglo-Afghan War with his regiment, was engaged with the Baluchis under Nasir Khan at Kotra and Gandava in December 1840, and was mentioned in despatches. He took part in the Sindh War of 1843, and was severely wounded at the Battle of Miani. He was again mentioned in despatches for bravery by Sir Charles Napier.London Gazette, 9 May 1843 In 1844 he was appointed Assistant Quartermaster-General in Sindh, and from 1851 to 1856 was specially employed in clearing mountain roads in the Southern Mahratta country. In 1856-7 he carried out the departmental arrangements connected with the Anglo-Persian War. In March 1857 he was appointed Quartermaster-General to the Bombay Army, and acted in this capacity throughout the Indian Mutiny, his services being warmly commended by Sir Hugh Rose (later Lord Strathnairn) on 15 May 1860. He held this office until 1868. He had become captain in his regiment on 28 December 1848 and was made brevet major on 16 June 1857, and major in the Bombay Staff Corps on 18 February 1861.Ernest Marsh Lloyd, Robert Phayre - Dictionary of National Biography, 1901 supplement He became brevet lieutenant- colonel on 6 January 1863, and colonel five years afterwards.

The Baroda Crisis The Baroda Crisis - Malhar Rao and Phayre - The Graphic (1875) From 1868 to 1872 he was political superintendent of the Sindh frontier, and commandant of the Frontier Force. In March 1873 he was appointed Resident at Baroda. He made strong representations of the gross tyranny and cruelty of the Maharaja Gaikwar, Malhar Rao which precipitated the Baroda Crisis, and a commission which investigated his charges found that they were substantially proved. The Gaikwar received a warning and was advised to change his minister, but matters did not improve. The friction between Phayre and Malhar Rao increased, and at the instigation of the latter an attempt was made on 9 November 1874 to poison Phayre, by putting arsenic and diamond dust in his sherbet. The Baroda trial followed, and by order of the Secretary of State for India, Lord Salisbury, Malhar Rao was deposed on 10 April 1875 and exiled to Madras, where he died in obscurity in 1882. He was succeeded by the moderniser Sayajirao Gaekwad III. But the Indian Government had previously decided to change the Resident at Baroda and Phayre, declining to resign, was superseded by Sir Lewis Pelly on 25 November 1874. Second Afghan War Reverting to military employment, Phayre commanded a brigade, first in Bombay and afterwards in Rajputana, from 10 May 1875 to 4 May 1880. Having been promoted Major-General on 1 January 1880, he was then appointed to the command of the reserve division of the army engaged in the Second Anglo-Afghan War and had charge of the line of communication by Quetta to Kandahar. After the disaster of the Battle of Maiwand on 27 July 1880 he was directed to push forward to Kandahar, besieged by Ayub Khan; but he was delayed by want of troops and transport, and Kandahar was relieved by General Frederick Roberts (afterwards Earl Roberts) at the Battle of Kandahar before his arrival.

He introduced Mannerism to Peru, where he went on a Jesuit mission after having studied in Rome. On his way to Peru, Bitti traveled through Spain, where he became influenced by Sevillian painting, especially that of Luis de Morales. Bitti arrived in Peru in 1575 and started painting for churches first in Lima and from 1583 in Cusco. His works in Lima include the typically Mannerist Coronation of the Virgin and The Virgin of the Candelaria for St. Peter's Church. The Immaculate Conception was a recurring theme in his paintings, one of which is in the in Cusco. In addition to Mannerism, his works reflect ideas of the Counter-Reformation and religious education of the natives. After 1584, Bitti traveled all over South America, painting where he went. His mobile lifestyle was a testament to his popularity with the Jesuits, but it led to Bitti's being unable to set up a workshop or have apprentices. Nevertheless, his influence in the region was immense, and resulted in Mannerism persisting in South America even when it had fallen out of favor in Europe. Bitti is regarded as the founder of the Cusco School of painting. Career Coronation of the Virgin The Virgin of the Candelaria Democrito Bernardo Bitti was born in Camerino, Italy in 1548. Few details about his life in Europe are known. He became a painter at an early age and as a teenager he moved to Rome to study painting for a period of five years. His studies focused on Italian Mannerism. At the age of 20, in 1568, Bitti became a Jesuit and relocated to the novitiate of Sant'Andrea al Quirinale, also in Rome, where he stayed until 1573. He might have painted some works there, but none survive. Meanwhile, the Jesuit mission in the Viceroyalty of Peru had asked for Rome to send them skilled painters. Bitti was identified as the best one available; his Jesuit background would make him the ideal painter of altarpieces. Thus Bitti was commissioned on a Jesuit mission to Peru in 1571, becoming the first artist to travel on a Jesuit mission to South America. The expedition party traveled through Spain on their way to Peru. It is not known precisely what Bitti did during his stay in Spain, but it appears that he had the opportunity to study Sevillian painting for 14 months. It has been subsequently noted that his paintings resemble particularly those of the painter Luis de Morales, probably through seeing his works rather than by training with him. Influence by Giuseppe Valeriano is also attested. The Jesuit party arrived in Peru in 1575, where Bitti introduced Mannerism to the country. He became a very sought after artist because of the novelty of his style in the new continent. One of Bitti's first tasks was to paint a collection for the Jesuit college and St. Peter's Church in Lima. His paintings in the church include Coronation of the Virgin and The Virgin of the Candelaria. Bitti also made a retable in St. Peter's Church. He stayed in Lima for eight years, working. In 1583, Bitti moved to Cusco, where he stayed until the end of 1584. There he painted Immaculate Conception and constructed a high altar, both for the Jesuit church of Cusco. For its Indian chapel, he painted a setting the Last Judgment, now lost, the sight of which persuaded many natives to convert, according to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega writing in 1612. Later in his career, Bitti traveled through Spanish America including Potos√≠, Arequipa, , Acora, La Paz, Sucre, and Chucuito. Most of his works were made in Juli. Of his paintings, only those in Peru remain. Bitti collaborated with other artists, including his fellow Jesuit Pedro de Vargas, in art projects all over the Peru. These collaborations included the sculptural support for many retablos. Works Immaculate Conception in Cusco Most of Bitti's works are on the life and persons of Jesus and Virgin Mary. Especially numerous are his works on the theme of the Immaculate Conception, including a noteworthy one in Cusco. Bitti was painting for a dual audience of European-born immigrants and newly converted natives. He was also under the constraint of carefully crafting his works to conform with the requirements of the post Council of Trent era of Counter-Reformation. His work is representative of Mannerism, characterized by elongated figures with slender limbs and delicate fingers in posing gracefully in condensed compositions. Drapery is characteristically crisp and \\"paper-like\\". The colors are saturated, often pastel blues and pinks. Bitti's Mannerism, however, \\"lacked the confusion, erudition, and sometimes erotic sway\\" that was typical of the style in his native Italy. Bitti painted in tempera, \\"with the delicacy of the followers of Michelangelo and Raphael\\". Lines are dominant and the colors are cool, exposing Bitti's kinship with the works of Giorgio Vasari. Although there is no contemporary material to conclude if Bitti's work was well-received, this is likely the case because he was sent to so many locations in South America. Today, Bitti's work is considered skillfully executed. Coronation of the Virgin in St. Peter's Church is centered on the Trinity, below which Mary is found. Presentation is typically Mannerist in elongated limbs and elegant poses, with mostly soft blue and pink colors. There is experimentation with the colors, which change in shadows and folds of drapery. Floating in the clouds are angels and cherubs, with considerable variation in postures, with figura serpentinata all over. The painting, however, differs from typical Mannerism in one important regard. It is markedly symmetrical and focused. As such, it emphasizes the Trinity in accordance with the didactic mission of the Jesuits and in the spirit of the Counter-Reformation. Bitti painted the persons of the Trinity as clearly distinct: God the Father and Son are of different ages, and the Holy Spirit takes the form of a dove. This was to avoid potential confusion that could arise in the eyes of natives when looking at paintings that portray the Trinity as a three-faced man or three near- identical men. The Virgin of the Candelaria, also at St. Peter's, features Mary holding infant Jesus while angels provide light with candles. The dramatic light it features is typical of the works of Bitti and something that he probably adopted from his time in Spain. Immaculate Conception, an altarpiece in the in Cusco, is typical of Bitti. Mary, with sharp features, is set against a background that does not reveal a setting. In the painting, made for devotion, she is at the same time accessible to the devotee and exists in an otherworldly realm. The colors are cool and pastel, and drapery folds in the typical brittle fashion. The painting relies on visual exaggeration reminiscent of the work of Italian Mannerists like Bronzino and Parmigianino, but without any eroticism. Agony in the Garden Agony in the Garden, painted around 1600 and now in the Lima Art Museum, has an elongated and graceful Christ figure and an angel, both in pastel draperies that seem to ignore both gravity and the shape of their bodies. Death and legacy Bitti returned to Lima and continued to work there until his death in 1610. At the time of his death, Bitti was an esteemed artist. Bitti is considered the founder of the Cusco School of painting. Even though many other Italian painters followed in his footsteps to South America ‚Äì including Matteo P√©rez and Angelino Medoro immediately in his year of arrival ‚Äì few became as influential as Bitti, whose influence on painting in Viceroyal Peru was decisive. Although Bitti never stayed in one place long enough to establish a workshop or train apprentices, his work influenced many painters of the Andes, especially in Cusco and the Audiencia of Charcas in Bolivia. Gregorio Gamarra is the only artist known to have been a proper follower of Bitti. L√°zaro Pardo de Lagos, Diego Cusi Guam√°n, and Pedro Bed√≥n also exhibit influences. Through Bed√≥n, Bitti influenced the Quito School. Many yet to be attributed works in Peruvian churches and monasteries also carry the hallmarks of Bitti's influence. Because of Bitti's influentiality, Mannerism featured in Peruvian and Bolivian art even after the style went out of fashion in Europe.

Larsen is an Associate professor of Earth Systems Science for the Department of Geography and Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley where she also heads the Environmental Systems Dynamics Laboratory. Her areas of expertise include hydroecology, geomorphology, complex systems, and environmental modeling.  Early life and education  Larsen spent much of her childhood playing in and around water in Florida. Her parents both worked in science, as a NASA shuttle engineer and a state water manager. At the age of 16, Larsen began her undergraduate studies at Washington University of St. Louis where she eventually graduated summa cum laude with majors in environmental studies and systems science and mathematics. She then proceeded to complete her master's degree in earth and planetary sciences at the same institution under Ray Arvidson's mentorship. Larsen's master's thesis is titled Development and Testing of a Coupled Heat and Moisture Transfer Model to Assess Subsurface Moisture Gradients and was completed in 2003. Larsen moved on to the University of Colorado-Boulder at age 21 and began her doctoral studies in the Civil, Environmental, and Architectural Engineering department. At the University of Colorado, Larsen studied fluvial geomorphology, aquatic ecology, and fluid mechanics. She began researching the Florida Everglades and how they evolved to create the unique slough and ridge landscape that is essential to the Everglades ecosystem. In 2008, she completed her dissertation on Hydroecological Feedback Processes Governing Landscape Self-Organization in the Florida Everglades.  Career and research  Laurel Larsen has worked in academia since she earned her PhD at the University of Colorado in 2008. She began her professional research with the USGS National Research Program as part of the Hydroecology of Flowing Waters Project. She continued working with the USGS National Research Program until 2016 on various other research topics. Some of this research included work on the differences between the hydrogeomorphology of restored and unrestored streams within the Chesapeake Bay watershed and what kind of impacts restoration can have on the surrounding ecosystem. Larsen was hired at the University of California, Berkeley as an Assistant professor for the Department of Geography in 2013. In 2018, she was made an Associate professor for the Geography and Civil and Environmental engineering department at the University of California, Berkeley and currently holds this position. Larsen's research focuses on the fields of hydrology, geomorphology, environmental fluid mechanics, complex systems, environmental modeling, aquatic ecology, restoration ecology, wetlands, sediment transport. She is most known for her achievements in research on the Florida Everglades which have influenced numerous restoration efforts in the area. The Florida Everglades have a unique ecosystem composed of ridges with more vegetation and sloughs with less vegetation. Water flows through the entire ecosystem parallel to these \\"ridge- and-slough\\" structures providing essential services to the ecosystem; however, human impacts have disrupted the flow of water through the Everglades. Larsen's research has answered questions about the formation of this landscape that were previously considered unanswerable and her research has been able to dictate decisions on how to best restore the natural landscape from anthropogenic changes.  Awards and honors  Some of Larsen's most recent awards include: * 2018, Donath Medal (Young Scientist Award), Geological Society of America * 2015, Hellman Faculty Fellow award, UC Berkeley * 2015, NSF CAREER award * 2013, Kohout Early Career Award, Geological Society of America Hydrogeology Division  Publications  Larsen has authored or co- authored over 100 published scientific papers and has been cited over 1200 times. Her most notable publications focus on the formation of aquatic landscapes such as the Florida Everglades and strategies for restoration of these spaces. These topics were previously considered untestable due to the large difference in timescales between the forces forming these landscapes (i.e. hydraulic transport) and the resulting changes in geomorphic and biological evolution. Larsen has been able to quantify and evaluate these systems using mathematical models that consider hydraulic transport on the scale of seconds to months and geomorphology and biology over the course of decades and centuries. Larsen has also published a picture book called \\"One Night in the Everglades\\" in conjunction with the Long Term ecological Research Network, an organization funded by the National Science Foundation.  Personal life  Larsen enjoys hiking and racing bicycles, both cyclocross and road cycling.

Chicago architectural firm Rapp and Rapp designed the Spanish Revival building; their design led them to become the main architects for Balaban and Katz, and later for Paramount Pictures. The firm's design featured two prominent towers on its front facade and was decorated with red brick and terra cotta. The theater was also the first in the world to include mechanical air conditioning, which featured prominently in its advertising during the summer. It provided entertainment to both Lawndale's Jewish community and the African-American community that replaced it in the 1950s, and it is one of the few remaining Lawndale business from the early twentieth century. The theatre was the inspiration for the well known Call of Duty Zombies map, Kino Der Toten. In 1971, the theater was converted to the House of Prayer, Church of God in Christ; it has been used as a church ever since.

The square has been a gathering place for many centuries in the town, the earliest recorded event was the execution of the Ipswich Martyrs in the 16th century. In the present-day, the Cornhill hosts various events such as Christmas markets, live music shows, and outdoor screenings of notable broadcasts, such as the proms. The square is surrounded by grand Victorian buildings built as the town's wealth was booming from sheep wool and dock trade. The prominent Ipswich Town Hall building is located on the Cornhill.  History  The Cornhill has always been an important area throughout the town's history. One of the earliest recorded events taken place on the Cornhill was the execution of the Ipswich Martyrs, nine people were persecuted for their Lollard or Protestant beliefs around 1515-1558. A memorial for the martyrs was erected in Christchurch Park in 1903. The monument has a square, stone base that bears a testament to the martyrs on the front, and lists their names on the other three sides. In 1818 William Cubitt connected a gas supply emanating from Ransome and Sons coke plant in Old Foundry Street to Cornhill, thereby introducing gas lighting to the square. In 1980's the Cornhill was pedestrianised into a town square after being used as a busy road throughout the town for decades. Cabman's Shelter, created in 1892, was made to provide a dry, warm space for drivers of horse-drawn cabs in the centre of Ipswich. It was moved from the Cornhill, to Christchurch Park in 1895. Damaged by fire in 1995, it was restored in 2006.  Redevelopment  In 2012, Lord Stuart Rose criticised the town square, describing it as a \\"barren wasteland\\" and \\"the most depressing place I have ever seen\\". His comments led to a ¬£3.6 million redevelopment of the square, in 2018 work commenced to replace the pavement, add a water fountain feature, and add four stone \\"gateway\\" arches. The new square was heavily criticised by locals, and a few months after the square was opened, a fatal accident brought many questions about the safety of the new square. The council responded by removing the gateway arches, and by remedial work to improve the safety of the squares steps.

He is a \\"passeur de m√©moire\\", a memory keeper, who survived the deportation of the Jews in Belgium during World War II. Paul Sobol was part of the last convoy of Jewish deportees to leave the Dossin Baracks for Auschwitz. An advertising executive, he also worked in marine and subaquatic tourism development.  Early life  Paul Sobol was born in Paris in 1926. Two years later, his family settled in Brussels. During the German invasion, the Sobol family melted into the Belgian population. Paul Sobol worked for a while for a furrier, but the attempt was not lasting. In 1941, he resumed his studies until 1942. The wearing of the Star of David and the registration of Jews forced the family to go underground. During these years, Paul Sobol was called Robert Sax. On June 13, 1944, while the allied troops were making headway in France, the family was denounced to the Gestapo and arrested. Taken to the Dossin Barracks in Mechelen, they were part of the 26th convoy on July 31, 1944, which was the last from Mechelen to leave Belgian territory in the direction of Auschwitz. Upon his arrival at the concentration camp, Paul Sobol was assigned to a Kommando of carpenters. He practised many activities during his captivity. On January 18, 1945, due to the Allied advance, he was compelled to take part in a death march in the direction of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. There, he was locked up with many other prisoners in freight wagons bound for a subcamp of Dachau, the M√ºhldorf complex. During the journey, everyone fought for their own life, but only 20% of the prisoners survived. On April 25, 1945, following a bombing, Paul Sobol escaped and found shelter in a village among French prisoners. They were released by the Americans on May 1, 1945, and Paul got back to Belgium, where he was reunited with his sister. His younger brother and his parents never came back. = FamilyP.

The film is told entirely through still photographs that the director took of his real life over the course of a year. Plot American college student Molly (Eireann Harper) is in Mexico to study Spanish. She wants to take advantage of the trip by visiting old ruins and focusing on her photography during her free time, but she ends up tagging along with the other students who are only interested in partying. Meanwhile, Diego (Diego Cata√±o), a teenage Mexican boy, falls in love with his cousin. He hurts his toenail one day during a soccer game while trying to impress her. Molly returns to Mexico during her next break from school in order to photograph the ruins that she missed seeing on her previous trip. She rents a room from Diego's mother, who is renting it out in order to raise money for an operation for Diego's grandfather. Diego and Molly end up spending time together. Diego falls in love with Molly and the two develop a bond, going to the beach together near his grandmother's ranch, but he never tells her his true feelings. After Molly leaves, Diego secretly buys an airplane ticket to New York to visit her. He lies to his parents, saying that he is going camping with friends for the weekend. When he arrives in New York he calls Molly and says that he is there accompanying his father on a business trip. She takes him to Coney Island and the two spend the day together. Before he goes home to Mexico, Diego reveals to Molly that he was not really there with his father and that he had come to see her. She says that he is sweet but too young for her. After he leaves, she changes her phone number so that he will be unable to contact her and able to move on with his life more easily. Months later, Molly returns to Mexico for a third time, still having never seen the ruins. She goes there alone but forgets to bring her camera. She considers contacting Diego and letting him know that she is there, but decides not to, realizing that he has probably moved on with his life and forgotten all about her. The film closes with Diego chatting with one of his cousins about girls. He has a new love interest and makes no mention of Molly.

The main building is a Grade B listed building. The hospital is managed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. History The hospital, which was designed by Thomas Graham Abercrombie in the Scottish Baroque style, opened as the Renfrew District Asylum in 1909. Two further villas and a nurses' home were completed in 1914 and it served as a military hospital during the closing stages of the First World War. It became Dykebar Mental Hospital in the 1920s and joined the National Health Service as Dykebar Hospital in 1948. A major extension for geriatric patients was added in 1975. Three historic wards at a Paisley Hospital have been placed on an at-risk register. Wards 20, 22, 23, at Dykebar Hospital are cited in the Buildings at Risk Bulletin published by the Scottish Civic Trust on behalf of conservation body Historic Scotland. Also on the at-risk list is Mid Dykebar, a large red sandstone building within the grounds of the hospital. Ward 22 - formerly known as Villa 2 - is vacant and has been the target of vandals for some time.Buildings at Risk Bulletin, the Scottish Civic Trust The remaining two wards - before the new hospital was built in the mid-Seventies ward 20 was known as Villa 1 and ward 23 Villa 5 - are also vacant and boarded up. All four buildings were built in 1909 by Abercrombie. Mid Dykebar was built to house the superintendent of the hospital, which was then Renfrew District Asylum. A notable feature of the building is that the east entrance is unusual in having large areas of walling without windows.

Each authority operates in an assigned geo-morphological and political boundary and work to improve agriculture and rural development through irrigation, control of river pollution and also to assist farmers in processing food crops. River basin authorities operations have been influenced by Nigeria's economic and political changes, ten years after they were established their impact has been minimal.  Background  Concerns about sustainable food production in Nigeria after the Sahel drought of the early 1970s and a decline in agricultural output following Nigeria's oil boom led to ideas about investing in sustainable food production and managing water resources. Plans were then developed to create government agencies spread out within the country based on the drainage systems of various rivers. In 1973, two river basin authorities were established for Sokoto River and Lake Chad basin. In 1976, the law establishing the River Basin Development Authorities listed eleven agencies with the mandate to develop water resources to boost agricultural productions. Water resource management to support irrigable crops was one of the crucial mandates of the river basin authorities. When a democratic administration came into power in 1979, improved capital expenditure was allocated to the river basin authorities, some of which were in states controlled by the opposition but political consideration in choice of contractors and board personnel. In 1984, new basin authorities were created for each state, an increase to 19 from the original eleven basins. However, this restructuring did not last as a new regime reverted to the previous eleven.  The river basin authorities  * Chad Basin Development Authority - areas surrounding the Lake Chad Basin. * Upper Benue River Basin Development Authority - areas drained by the Benue River and its tributaries from the international boundary to Pai and Donga River. * Lower Benue River Basin Development Authority - catchment area are those within the confluence of Benue and Niger Rivers. * Cross River Basin Development Authority - catchment area are places drained by the Cross River and tributaries. * Anambra - Imo River Basin Development Authority - East of Niger River in areas drained by Rivers Imo and Anambra. * Niger River Basin Development Authority - areas drained by the Niger River starting in the North from the river's confluence with Malendo River and down to Niger River's confluence with Ubo River. * Ogun Oshun River Basin Development Authority * Benin - Owena River Basin Development Authority * Niger Delta Basin Development Authority * Sokoto - Rima River Basin Development Authority * Hadejia - Jama're River Basin Development Authority. * Upper Niger River - Niger, Kaduna and FCT  References  Water management authorities in Nigeria ","title":"River Basin Authorities in Nigeria"},{"id":"60609744","text":"Wurdeman & Becket was an architectural firm, a partnership of Walter Wurdeman, Welton Becket and Charles F.

Self-employed people pay 28% of their earnings to this system while employees only pay 6.5% and the rest (21.5%) is paid by their employers. More than 99% of the population who reach the stipulated age have pensions from this basic pension insurance.https://www.mpsv.cz/en/1606 The Czech Republic is one of two Eastern European countries which do not have a second pillar. For 3 years, from 2013 to 2016, the Czech Republic had this pillar, but because of low interest, it was cancelled and the money was transferred to the first pillar. The third pillar forms the complementary additional pension insurance with state contributions and products offered by commercial insurance companies. These companies mostly offer life insurance and each of them can have only one pension plan. People who join this system can change pension funds whenever they want without extra fees and they can receive payments after age of 60.  Types of benefits  = Old-age pension = The old-age pensions () are the monthly benefits for people who have reached retirement age or who have worked for the required number of years. It has two components: a basic amount, which is 2700 CZK and a percentage amount which is defined individually, but cannot be less than 770 CZK. = Early old-age pension = This pension is for people who opt to receive a pension before retirement. Applicants for this plan must meet three conditions. They cannot perform any gainful activities, they have to reach a certain age and they must meet the minimum number of insured years. At best, they will be able to retire 5 years before retirement age. However, candidates need to consider the benefits, because during early retirement they cannot work and cannot receive unemployed benefit. = Invalidity pension = The invalidity pension () is for people who cannot fully work for health reasons. Three levels of disability are distinguished. If the decrease in ability to work is 35‚Äì49%, then it falls under the first degree of disability. If a person has decrease in ability more than 50% but less than 69%, it falls under the second degree of disability and cases with 70% or more decrease in ability fall under the third degree. Moreover, if applicants opt to receive this benefit, they cannot meet the conditions for receiving a standard old-age pension (in that case they will receive only old-age pension) and they have to have pension insurance for the stipulated periods. Like the old-age pension, the invalidity pension has two components. The first is a basic amount, which is 2700 CZK. The second component, a percentage amount, depends on the number of insured years and the degree of disability. The percentage amount is at least 770 CZK. = Widow's and widower's pension = People can receive this pension in the case of a husband's or wife's death. They can claim this pension exactly after death if the deceased meets one of the following conditions: *received old-age pension *received invalidity pension *on the date of death he/she fulfilled the condition of the necessary insurance period for entitlement to invalidity or old-age pension *died as a result of an accident at work A widower or widow may apply for this pension one year after the death of a spouse, if they meet one of the following conditions: *he/she cares for a dependent child *their child depends on the help of another person in Grade II or Grade III or Grade IV *he/she cares for his/her parent or the parent of a deceased spouse who lives with him/her in the household and who is dependent on the assistance of another person in Grade II, Grade III or Grade IV *he/she has third-degree disability *he/she has reached retirement age, or an age that is no more than 4 years below the retirement age of a man who was born in the same year The amount of the widow's or widower's pension is 50% of the retirement pension, or 50% of the third-degree invalidity pension to which the deceased had, or would have, been entitled at the time of death. =Orphan's pension= An orphan's pension () is for children whose parents or adoptive parents or carers have died. They are entitled to this pension if the deceased: *received old-age pension or *received invalidity pension or *on the date of death he/she has fulfilled the condition of the necessary insurance period for entitlement to invalidity or old-age pension or *died as a result of an accident at work The amount of the orphan's pension is 40% of the retirement pension or 40% of the third degree invalidity pension to which the deceased had or would have been entitled at the time of death.  Retirement age  Retirement age depends on the person's year of birth and gender. For a woman, the retirement age depends also on the number of children she has raised. For every man who was born before 1936, the retirement age is 60 years and 2 months. Retirement age for a woman, who was born before that year and has five or more children is 53. For those women who have raised three or four children it is 54, while for those who have raised two children it is 55, with one child it is 56 and women without children who were born before 1936 have a retirement age of 57. The retirement age for each person who was born after 1977 is 67. People who were born between 1936 and 1977 have a different retirement age, but it is always true that the retirement age of men is higher or equal to the retirement age of women. For example, a woman who was born in 1955 and has 2 children, has a retirement age of 60.

Fish communities in the first half of the 20th Century are known primarily from a unique fisheries survey conducted in 1927-1928 by the Colonial Office. In 1927 Michael Graham was sent from the fisheries laboratory in Lowestoft, together with Edgar Barton Worthington to spend a year surveying fisheries in Lake Nyanza (Lake Victoria) .Graham M.

The leading candidate at that time was the Nile perch, which already lived in nearby Lake Albert. At the time Graham wrote \\"The introduction of a large predatory species from another area would be attended with the upmost danger, unless preceded by extensive research into the probable effects of this operation\\". In a footnote he added that his warning had just been strengthened by a recent research report from Lake Albert, which described how rare the tilapia had become.Graham M. (1929.)

London: Crown Agents for the Colonies. 256pp. It also meant that Lake Victoria at one time boasted one of the most diverse fish communities on earth. With such diversity, the cichlids managed to exploit virtually every food source available, including most detritus, zooplankton and phytoplankton. Disregarding the haplochromines, the dominant species in the 1927/8 survey catches were two, now critically endangered tilapia species, the 'Ngege' or Singida tilapia (Oreochromis esculentus) and Victoria tilapia (O. variabilis). Other commonly observed species included: Marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus), Elephant-snout fish (Mormyrus kannume), Ripon barbel (Labeobarbus altianalis), African sharptooth catfish (Clarias gariepinus), silver butter catfish (Schilbe intermedius) and Semutundu (Bagrus docmak). The most common Haplochromis species were suggested to be Haplochromis guiarti and Haplochromis cinereus. Graham M. (1929.) The Victoria Nyanza and Its Fisheries: A Report on the Fish Survey of Lake Victoria 1927‚Äì1928 and Appendices.

Rohatiner opened Jeff's Gourmet in a small storefront on Pico Boulevard in the Pico-Robertson Jewish district. The restaurant has limited indoor seating and a few tables outside on the sidewalk. Jeff's Gourmet is certified glatt kosher by OK Kosher Certification. It is closed on Friday afternoon and Shabbat. While its customer base is largely Orthodox and Modern Orthodox, Jeff's Gourmet also appeals to Conservative and Progressive Jewish families and individuals who may or may not keep kosher.

He also refused to join his opponents in testifying on the city's financial problems before the Philadelphia City Council. Rizzo also did not make many campaign appearances, making only a single appearance a day and only appearing in white ethnic neighborhoods considered to be friendly towards him. Rizzo repeatedly insisted that he was \\"not a politician\\". Rizzo took a position against additional taxes. Rizzo had earned goodwill with many voters, who perceived his command of the police department as having staved off the sort of violent rioting other cities had experienced years earlier. Green warned voters that it would be a \\"disaster\\" if America's then-fourth largest city were to be led by Rizzo. Liberal politicians primarily supported Green. Shortly before the primary, governor Milton Shapp endorsed Green (after which Rizzo attacked Shapp's record).

Williams was the first well-known African American to run for mayor of Philadelphia. After Shapp accused Rizzo of police brutality and Pennsylvania Attorney General J .

Specter would later be elected to the U.S. Senate in 1980, where he served until 2011. In the Democratic primary, Tate successfully fended off a challenge by Alexander Hemphill, who had the backing of Philadelphia Democratic Party Chairman Francis R. Smith. Primaries =Democratic= Chairman of the Philadelphia Democratic Party Francis R. Smith made an attempt to replace Tate on the ticket with City Controller Alexander Hemphill. However, Tate refused to drop-out of the election. Tate defeated Hemphill in the Democratic primary. =Republican= Incumbent District Attorney of Philadelphia Arlen Specter won the Republican primary. General election =Campaign= At the opening of the general election campaign, Specter was viewed as the frontrunner. Tate faced the obstacle of a divided Democratic Party. Tate supported legislation also endorsed by Cardinal John Krol which would allow state funding of parochial and other private schools, while Specter did not take a stance of this issue. During the campaign, Tate received heavy media attention by being in Tel Aviv during the outbreak of the Six-Day War and being in Rome when Archbishop Krol was elevated to Cardinal. Tate benefited from positive regards for the city's ability to keep greater peace amid the long, hot summer of 1967 than many other major cities had been able to. Tate thought he needed to send a \\"law and order\\" message to secure reelection, and therefore appointed Frank Rizzo as Philadelphia Police Commissioner. During the campaign, Tate was asked many times whether he planned to keep Rizzo in this position if reelected. Since Specter was a former liberal member of the Democratic party, he was able to receive the backing of much of Philadelphia's political establishment, as well as many liberal Democrats, such as the group Americans for Democratic Action. Specter presented himself as being able to usher in a continuance of the liberal reform policies of Tate's immediate two predecessors, Richardson Dilworth and Joseph S. Clark Jr.. Tate countered this by having Clark make appearances on the campaign trail with him. Polls anticipated a Specter victory. =Results= Tate won reelection by a narrow margin. It is believed that Tate, the city's first Catholic mayor, received strong support from the Catholic electorate. He performed well in Catholic wards of the city. It is also believed that Tate benefited from strong turnout among labor voters. While Tate carried the city's African American wards, he received less support in these wards than was typical at the time for the Democratic Party. Specter, who would have become the city's first Jewish mayor had he won, carried the city's wards with a primarily Jewish population. Specter won a majority of the white vote.

The Faujdars of Purnea were notable in that they had created an autonomous jurisdiction for themselves and did not allow the Nawabs of Bengal and Murshidabad to interfere. They also carried the title of Nawab and so are sometimes referred to as the \\"Nawabs of Purnea\\". History The first faujdar of Purnea was Saif Khan who was a member of the Muslim nobility and was appointed in between 1704-1707 by the Mughals. During this period, Purnea was in a state of virtual anarchy with regular raids carried out by the zamindars of Morang, the Chakwar tribe of Begusarai and neighbouring zamindars. After his appointment, Saif Khan set to work pacifying and restoring order to the region. He was successful in defeating the enemies of the Mughal Empire and was eventually able to bring peace to the region. He also expanded his territories into modern-day Nepal and was a patron of arts. He eventually passed in 1748 and was succeeded by his son. Fakhr-ud-in Hussain Khan (also known as Nawab Bahadur), the son of Saif Khan was the next in line as the faujdar of Purnea. He was said to have had no talents or capacity as a governor and was also known for his hoarding of jewellery. He made several attempts to defy the Nawabs of Bengal who opposed his oppressive conduct. After a battle with the Nawabs, he escaped to Delhi and died in obscurity. After this period, the faujdars of Purnea were appointed by the Nawabs of Bengal however they all varied in the amount of loyalty they showed to the Nawabs. One of these faujdars, Shaukat Jang, fought on the side of the Bengal during the Battle of Plassey. The French mercenary, Walter Reinhardt Sombre was briefly employed by the faujdars of Purnea in the 1760s and commanded an army to fight on their behalf that unusually reported directly to him rather than to the faujdars. This army was said to have consisted of local Bihari soldiers and other European mercenaries. Expansion and conflict with Nepal Under the rule of Saif Khan, Purnea engaged in a protracted struggle with neighbouring kings in Nepal. Due to repeated Gorkhali incursions into modern-day Bihar, Saif Khan led a campaign into Nepal (specifically in Morang district) that culminated in the sacking of Makwanpur and nearby towns where various atrocities were committed.

He is renowned for his work in plasma physics and nuclear fusion. Currently, as a professor and tenured researcher at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica (TEC), he heads the Plasma Laboratory for Fusion Energy and Applications that he founded in 2011. On August 11, 2016, Legislative Assembly of the Republic of Costa Rica recognized the contributions and leadership of Vargas-Blanco in the design, construction, and implementation of the first high temperature plasma magnetic confinement Stellarator type device to be built in Latin America. This fact made Costa Rica one of only eight countries in the world to possess this type of technology for nuclear fusion research. He is a promoter of plasma physics applications for medical, agricultural, and industrial uses in his countries. On November 30, 2016, the government of Costa Rica honored Vargas-Blanco with the Clodomiro Picado Twight National Prize for Science and Technology. A few days later, on December 4, the Costa Rican newspaper La Naci√≥n chose Vargas- Blanco as one \\"News Character of The Year\\" in their Sunday Magazine edition. On June 4, 2018, the Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Yukiya Amano appointed Vargas-Blanco a member of the International Fusion Research Council (IFRC), to actively work on the development of the international cooperation in research on controlled nuclear fusion and its applications, as well as advising the IAEA on the activities of the nuclear fusion research and technology program.Tico estar√° en el consejo cient√≠fico m√°s importante del mundo en Fusi√≥n Nuclear. In October 2018, the Costa Rica Foreign Trade Promotion (Procomer) chose him as one of the ambassadors of the \\"Essential Costa Rica\\" Country Brand.  Early Years and education  Vargas-Blanco is the second of five children born in the Canton Central de Alajuela to Susana Blanco Solis and Victor Manuel Vargas Rodriguez. The family were raised in \\"Concepcion de la Palmera\\" San Carlos de Alajuela, a rural north region of Costa Rica. His mother, Susana, is a housewife who worked daily in a family restaurant until 2018. His father, Victor, was a dairy farmer who later in life joined wife Susana managing the restaurant. Vargas-Blanco's schooling began at a small primary unified public school in Conception de la Palmera (1980‚Äì85), and he remembers, \\"There was a year when we were only ten students in the whole school\\". His interest in the sciences began early in life when many after school hours were dedicated to studying the only three science books available at the primary school. One book titled, \\"Lo Que Queremos Saber de la T√©cnica\\", (What We Want To Know About Technique), fostered a deep desire to learn more about rockets and nuclear fusion.Especial con el Dr. Iv√°n Vargas: ¬øC√≥mo construir un sue√±o? Even as a child, Vargas- Blanco would compose notes on ideas about particle physics and nuclear fusion. Draft of a nuclear fusion rocket by child Ivan Vargas-Blanco. Vargas-Blanco's parents during the event of the first plasma in SCR-1. Photo Ruth Garita, OCM- TEC. From childhood to adolescence, Vargas-Blanco would spend his free time doing homemade experiments in his father's dairy. Vargas-Blanco completed his secondary school studies at the Colegio T√©cnico Profesional Agropecuario de Aguas Zarcas in San Carlos, Alajuela. He had three kilometers daily walks followed by a one-hour truck ride to reach the school. There, he founded a scientific club and participated in The National Fairs of Science and Technology, earning several awards of merit including first place at a national level in 1989. His project received a perfect score. The University of Costa Rica accepted Ivan Vargas-Blanco to its undergraduate program majoring in physics in 1991. One year later, concerned about the practicality of pursuing a career in physics, he switched his major to Electrical Engineering. However, the young undergraduate's doubts were short lived. By year three he returned to a major in physics, even though the family could no longer support the studies because of economic limitations. Undaunted, he studied mathematics then taught in high school academies to finance aspirations for a career in physics. The studies at the University of Costa Rica led to an undergraduate degree in the year 2000. By 2001, grad student Ivan Vargas-Blanco was hired as a Professor at the Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica, then in 2002 was awarded a two-year doctoral scholarship from the Instituto de Acustica del Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cient√≠ficas and the Complutense University of Madrid in Spain. During his second year in Spain, Vargas-Blanco was accepted into the PhD program in Plasma and Nuclear Fusion at Complutense University of Madrid, entering into the Centro de Investigaciones Energ√©ticas, Medioambientales y Tecnol√≥gicas (CIEMAT), where the Laboratorio Nacional de Fusion is located. It was here that Vargas-Blanco developed his doctoral thesis project on local plasma transport in magnetic confinement devices. Once the two-year scholarship was over, Vargas-Blanco once again had to find gainful employment to finish his studies. Never to give up on his dreams for a career in physics, he got a scholarship from the Ministerio de Educaci√≥n de Espa√±a and his doctoral studies were completed on June 26, 2008.  Career  = Research = Vargas-Blanco received his doctorate in Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion from the Complutense University of Madrid, Spain in 2008. His PhD thesis entitled \\"Transporte local en plasmas ECRH de un dispositivo Heliac de confinamiento magn√©tico\\" (Local transport in ECRH plasmas of a Heliac magnetic confinement device)Tesis Doctoral Iv√°n Vargas Blanco, 2008. Laboratorio Nacional de Fusi√≥n ‚Äì Ciemat. is carried out at the Centro de Investigaciones Energ√©ticas, Medioambientales y Tecnol√≥gicas (CIEMAT) where the National Fusion Laboratory is located. It presents the results of thermal transport characterization in plasmas of the Spanish Stellarator TJ-II and its dependence on density, rotational transformation and heating power. Additionally, it shows results of the study of particle transport in this device and its dependence on density.Density dependence of particle transport in ECH plasmas of the TJ-II stellarator. Vargas-Blanco's work represents one of the first scientific evidences of the influence and improvement of thermal confinement due to the rational surfaces in Stellarator devices. During his doctoral studies, Vargas-Blanco participated in other scientific activities such as the calibration and maintenance of the electronic cyclotron emission diagnosis for the measurement of plasma temperature and activities within the electronic cyclotron resonance heating group of the Stellarator TJ-II.

Prior to his return to Costa Rica, Vargas-Blanco succeeded in having the CIEMAT and the Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica sign a collaboration agreement to promote research in nuclear fusion plasmas between the two institutions. This allowed him in 2009 to continue conducting research in the field of nuclear fusion in Costa Rica with the dream of creating a laboratory and building a Stellarator device. Working towards his goals in plasma research, Vargas-Blanco founded in 2008 the Grupo de Plasmas y Aplicaciones in the Tecnologico de Costa Rica (TEC), and began the purchase and acquisition of scientific equipment. In 2009, the Project Stellarator of Costa Rica 1 (SCR-1) was launched with a group of enthusiastic students. The aim was to build the first device of its kind in Latin America. Since the creation of the Plasma Laboratory for Fusion Energy and Applications in 2011, coordinator Vargas-Blanco has promoted seventeen research projects in fusion, plasmas and their applications for Costa Rican medical, agricultural and industrial uses. These projects got the attention of the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States compelling them to donate a spherical tokamak, known as a MEDUSA (Madison Education Small Aspect Ratio, now known as MEDUSA-CR), to Tecnologico de Costa Rica, thus turning the university into one of the few in the world boasting both a Stellarator and a spherical tokamak. Thanks to his perseverance and leadership, Vargas-Blanco has consolidated his research group to be recognized within the international scientific community for innovations in plasmas and fusion applications and positioning Costa Rica as a reference in Latin America in this exciting new field of scientific endeavor. From 20‚Äì31 January 2014, Vargas-Blanco organized in Costa Rica three international Plasma Physics and Nuclear Fusion conferences and one Plasma Physics Workshop. Vargas-Blanco is a representative of Costa Rica in the International Scientific Committee of the Latin American Workshop on Plasma Physics, and the Conference from the International Atomic Energy Agency in the topics of exploring practical applications for small nuclear fusion devices. He has participated as a consultant of the International Atomic Energy Agency in the subject of research in nuclear fusion media, and he is also a member of good standing in the American Physical Society (APS), and a member of The Society of Plasma and Nuclear Sciences of the IEEE (NPSS). = University teaching = Due to his interest to establish new generations of scientists in the field of plasmas and fusion, Vargas-Blanco has taught the course \\"Plasma Physics and Applications I\\" for more than eight years at the Tecnol√≥gico de Costa Rica. This is a course that covers the introduction to the plasmas physics, charged particles in magnetic and electric fields, plasma as fluids, waves in plasmas, collisions, conductivity and diffusion, and the discharges types. By 2018, around 200 university students have enrolled into this course. In 2018, he taught the second course \\"Plasma Physics for Engineering II\\", adding topics as: plasma generation, introduction to plasma diagnosis, computational plasma physics, and plasma for nuclear fusion and surface treatment by plasma. Vargas is also a professor of general physics courses and general physics laboratories at the TEC School of Physics.  Scientific labor  Vargas-Blanco's scientific and technological contribution has focused on the physics and engineering of Stellarators. In physics, he has contributed to the characterization and understanding of thermal and particle transportation in helical magnetic confinement devices. In engineering, he led the design, construction and implementation of the first Stellarator in Latin America, which makes Costa Rica one of the eight countries in the world to have this technology for the research on nuclear fusion. Additionally, since 2006 he leads the implementation of the magnetic confinement device of the Tokamak Spherical type called MEDUSA-CR (Madison Education Small Aspect Ratio of Costa Rica) in the Costa Rican Institute of Technology. Likewise, he has participated as a co-author in scientific articles on the use of plasma in medicine, agriculture and industry.

She works on the cosmic microwave background, brane cosmology and massive gravity.  Early life and education  Durrer was born in Kerns. She earned her high school diploma at Kantonales Lehrerseminar, and studied at the University of Z√ºrich. She completed her PhD on perturbation theory with Norbert Straumann at the University of Z√ºrich in 1988. She was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge for a year, before joining Princeton University in 1989. Durrer returned to Z√ºrich in 1991, completing a postdoctoral fellowship.  Research and career  Durrer was made an assistant professor at the University of Z√ºrich in 1992, and full professor at the University of Geneva in 1995. She is a member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. She works on the cosmic microwave background and massive gravity. Massive gravity describes an expanding universe with massive gravitons, which weakens gravity on large scales. Durrer uses cosmological observations as a test for general relativity. Durrer has contributed extensively to the theoretical understanding of topological defects. She showed that cosmic textures can suppress the acoustic peaks of the angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background. This results confirm that cosmic textures are not responsible for the distribution of matter in the observed universe. She worked with Neil Turok to demonstrate it is possible to use terrestrial lab-based experiments to test phase transitions in the early universe. These include using liquid crystals to study the scaling solutions of string networks. She has also demonstrated that density fluctuations in the early universe can result in the cosmological magnetic fields. She showed that the scaling properties of these primordial magnetic fields can be determined by causality arguments alone. Durrer studied an extended area of space, separating it into 60 billion zones and using the c++ library LATfield2 with a supercomputer to study the movement of individual particles. She used Einstein's equations to calculate the distance in metric space, comparing this with the prediction of Newton's methods. She has investigated dark energy. Durrer was elected to Academia Net by the Swiss National Science Foundation in 2012. She is a member of the committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics International Society on General Relative and Gravitation.

After establishing themselves as separate dancehall artists from the Unity soundsystem in the 1980s, the Ragga Twins switched direction in the early 1990s, combining into a duo after signing to Shut Up & Dance's label. The production duo stirred the Ragga Twins' change in direction, fusion their previous reggae and dancehall style into the Shut Up & Dance hardcore dance style. Aided by the release of several charting singles, Reggae Owes Me Money reached number 26 on the UK Albums Chart. Since its release, it has been recognised as a blueprint for jungle music, which built upon its usage of ragga, reggae basslines and breakbeats. Now hailed as a classic album, most of the album's material was re-released on the Ragga Twins Step Out compilation in 2008. Background The Ragga Twins, consisting of brothers David and Trevor Destouche, known as Deman Rockers and Flinty Badman respectively, began as MCs for Unity, a leading sound system in London. Throughout the 1980s, they separately released music on the soundsystem's Unity label, making digital dancehall music similar in style to labelmate King Jammy. The brothers stayed faithful to the label by turning down offers from other record companies to do \\"voice things\\". Nonetheless, they both left decided to leave Unity while at the Shinolas club in Hackney on New Year's Day 1990. The brothers felt that they had spent the 1980s \\"not going anywhere\\" and \\"not being brought into a studio.\\" As a musician, Rockers wanted his music to be available for others to buy, but they felt there was little opportunity. He recalled: \\"I remember we played against Coxsone, and one of those guys told me if I was on their system I'd be in the studio every week! It was an easy decision to leave Unity and seek new opportunities. It was essential we left.\\" The brothers met Hackney-based breakbeat hardcore duo Shut Up and Dance, who also ran the label of the same name, when the latter duo contacted Deman Rockers to ask if they could sample his voice. The brothers had been signed to Unity as solo acts, but Shut Up & Dance suggested they sign them as a duo. Rockers later said that \\"SUAD have come up with a lot of great things, trust me, but this was perhaps their greatest achievement, getting us together as an act.\\" Shut Up and Dance, and their productions for the label, were known for the infusion of hip hop into house music with sped up hip hop beats and reggae-esque basslines, alongside unlicensed samples and sound effects, resulting in a dark style of hardcore music popular in British illegal raves around 1990. By producing the Ragga Twins, the styles of both acts merged and introduced a \\"new, streetwise sound\\" to British raves. This marked a transition for the Ragga Twins from reggae soundsystems to hardcore and acid house parties where, previously unbeknown to the brothers, they had been revered since the late 1980s. Production and composition Among the earliest records Shut Up & Dance produced for the Ragga Twins, \\"Ragga Trip\\" adapts lyrics Rockers had recorded for the reggae song \\"Hard Drugs,\\" and criticised the excessive drug use at acid house parties. Subsequent singles were more hardcore in style and included \\"Spliffhead\\", \\"Hooligan 69\\", \\"Illegal Gunshot\\" and \\"Wipe the Needle.\\" For Reggae Owes Me Money, the Ragga Twins wanted to prove to Unity \\"what they could have had,\\" and hence applied an energy and enthusiasm unseen in their Unity work. Flinty Badman recalled: \\"Back when we started as Ragga Twins it had to work... otherwise people would say, ‚ÄòWell, if reggae owes you money why did you leave in the first place?'.\\" Shut Up & Dance produced the album, on which the aforementioned singles appear. Music journalist Andrew Harrison described Reggae Makes Me Money as an abrasive fusion of ragga and house music, commenting how the Ragga Twins take Shut Up & Dance's style of 'massive' house beats and shameless sampling and moves it into \\"weird territory.\\" He also felt the duo's unique style of toasting is more reminiscent of \\"the jambering of a wino than Shabba Ranks' slick chant.\\" Previous singles \\"Hooligan 69\\" and \\"Illegal Gunshot\\" appear. The former begins with an unlicensed sample of the intro to Prince's \\"Let's Go Crazy\\", and was popular on dancefloors due to its heavy breakbeat and pulsating bassline. \\"Illegal Gunshot\\", meanwhile, applies a ragga chat atop a bouncy rhythm. A remix of \\"Spliffhead\\" fuses deep reggae with a style reminiscent of early Mantronix, while \\"Ragga Trip\\" is highlighted for its B-boy breakbeat and Roland TB-303 acid house bass. \\"Juggling\\" and \\"Wipe the Needle\\" feature toasting and boasting atop a classic break, anticipating the style of General Levy, whereas \\"18\\" Speaker\\" highlights the influence of dub on Shut Up & Dance's production style. \\"The Killing\\" is an anti-heroin song and samples \\"High Hopes\\" by the SOS Band.\\"  Release and reception  The duo named the album Reggae Owes Me Money in reference to how they felt they had put so much work into reggae and were not being rewarded for it, saying that \\"reggae will always be our first loved music.\\" Dave Jenkins of International DJ Mag elaborated: \\"It wasn't an ironic or humorous title: after investing 10 years of soundsystem graft and deejay craft with London's Unity Sound, they felt they weren't getting the studio breaks they saw contemporaries such as Tippa Irie or Papa Levi enjoying.\\" Reggae Owes Me Money was released on 10 April 1991. On 1 June, the album debuted and peaked number 26 on the UK Albums Chart, staying on the chart for five weeks, including two weeks in the top 40. The reused singles \\"Ragga Trip\\" and \\"Illegal Gunshot\\" had already charted on the UK Singles Chart in 1990, peaking at numbers 76 and 51 respectively. In April 1991, a double A-side of \\"Wipe the Needle\\" and \\"Juggling\\" reached number 71, while \\"Hooligan 69\\" reached number 56 in July. In a contemporary review for Select, Andrew Harrison highlighted the \\"weird\\" sound of the material, and commented that the \\"Ragga Twins are hit-and-miss exponents of the club 12-inch, so it's for the best that Reggae Owes Me Money is more of a greatest hits package than a genuine debut.\\" He did however feel that the Ragga Twins' \\"ragga-House\\" style was more difficult to digest in album form than on twelve- inch singles, describing the record as \\"[v]ery hardcore indeed, and sometimes enough to make producers SUAD themselves sound mainstream.\\" Legacy By fusing the Ragga Twins' reggae with Shut Up & Dance's production style, Reggae Owes Me Money became a blueprint for jungle music, a genre defined by its usage of basslines, breakbeats and ragga, and which Dan Kuper of the New Statesman describes as the first authentic British dance music genre and a direct ancestor to UK garage, grime and dubstep. In the 2018 documentary Bass, Beat and Bars, Flint Badman recalled the album as the link between reggae and jungle, \\"because it had us doing the reggae chatting, it added the fast sped up breaks, and it blended the two genres together, which now we call jungle.\\" Joe Patrin of Pitchfork wrote that \\"the Ragga Twins' 1990-92 output, which comprised the majority of their career work until their mid-aughts comeback, lacks the 150+ BPM pace and \\"Amen\\" break-chopping most obviously identified with the [jungle] genre by 1994. But it was a solid prototype.\\" English MC Rodney P hailed the album as a \\"landmark\\", while Joe Muggs of Fact Magazine considers it a \\"classic album.\\" Influential blogger Matt Woebot placed the album at number 7 on his list of the \\"100 Greatest Records Ever,\\" calling it \\"the best record to emerge out of the UK acid house scene‚Ä¶ it's also, by default, the best record to come out of the UK's Dancehall scene. And the best Grime LP ever!\\" Patrin acknowledged its placement in the list as an attempt to trying to rectify the Ragga Twins' standing as innovators, as the duo had become overlooked in the music media. In 2008, Soul Jazz Records released the compilation Ragga Twins Step Out, which includes all the songs from Reggae Makes Me Money with the exception of \\"Hooligan 69\\", due to Prince refusing the sample. However, the vinyl version of the compilation features a remix of the song without the Prince sample.

It is edited by Joachim Hiller and has had many contributors. Besides its focus on punk subculture, it also covers similar genres, reviews of comics, books and films, and has included serial novels by authors such as Klaus N. Frick. By 2019, Ox had a circulation of 10,000 copies.  History  Ox-Fanzine was founded in 1988 by Joachim Hiller and Biggi H√§u√üler in Heidenheim an der Brenz (Southern Germany). Its first issue was published in January 1989. The zine was named after the cat of H√§u√üler, which appeared on the first cover. After some time, Ox merged with the zine Faces the Facts and was joined by its editor Thomas H√§hnel, but eventually H√§u√üler and H√§hnel left it to focus on other endeavours, leaving Hiller as the only editor. In the 1990s, Hiller relocated to Solingen in Western Germany. Since the first issue of Ox-Fanzine there has been a page of vegetarian recipes and from there Hiller and his wife Uschi Herzer have published five cookbooks, the latest being entirely vegan. In them, several artists have collaborated with their own recipes, including Steve Albini, Mille Petrozza, Bill Gould, and Reimer Bustorff of Kettcar. By 2005, Ox had a circulation of 12,500 copies, surpassing other German and American zines such as HeartattaCk. On 11 February 2009, Ox-Fanzine and the music association Cow Club from Soligen organised a show celebrating the 100th issue of the magazine with Wire, Jingo De Lunch, EA80, among other bands. On 7 February 2014, the zine celebrated its 25th anniversary with a show featuring the Ruts DC, the Generators, Asta Kask, and Vitamin X. In January 2019, its circulation was around 10,000.  Recognitions  The Frankenpost has called Ox \\"the most important hardcore and punk magazine in the German-speaking world.\\" The Neue Osnabr√ºcker Zeitung described it as the \\"organ of the [German punk] scene\\".

Since 2014, when it was successfully used by Russia during its annexation of Crimea, this model has been adopted by other governments and political movements around the world.  Characteristics  The characteristics that distinguish this technique from Soviet Cold-War era propaganda techniques are a large number of messages and channels, and a \\"shameless\\" approach to disseminating falsehoods and contradictory messages. The immediate aim is to entertain, confuse, and overwhelm the audience. The \\"firehose\\" takes advantage of modern technology, such as the Internet and social media, and recent changes in the way people produce and consume news. The high volume of messages and the use of multiple channels are effective because people are more likely to believe a story when it appears to have been reported by multiple sources. In addition to the recognizably Russian news source, RT, for example, Russia disseminates propaganda using dozens of proxy websites whose connection to RT is \\"disguised or downplayed.\\" People are also more likely to believe a story when they think many others believe it, especially if those others belong to a group with which they identify. Thus, an army of trolls can influence a person's opinion by creating the false impression that a majority of that person's neighbors support a given view. Using the firehose model, according to the RAND Corporation, the Russian government has had some success in getting people to believe and spread falsehoods and disbelieve truthful reporting. The success of this approach flouts the conventional wisdom that communication is more persuasive when it is truthful, credible, and non-contradictory. Although the firehosing technique takes advantage of modern technology, it is informed by the thinking of the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin, according to literary critic Michiko Kakutani. Lenin once explained that his heated language was \\"calculated not to convince, but to break up the ranks of the opponent, not to correct the mistake of the opponent, but to destroy him, to wipe his organization off the face of the earth.\\" In his biography of Lenin, historian Victor Sebestyen described him as the \\"godfather\\" of \\"post-truth politics.\\" Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News and White House Chief Strategist in the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, once described himself as a Leninist. Kakutani also cites Vladislav Surkov, a Russian businessman and propagandist. Surkov helped engineer Vladimir Putin's rise to power by sowing chaos and confusion, and has suggested that the United States is also looking for a \\"strong hand\\" to lift it from increasing chaos.  Campaigns  According to The Washington Post, Kakutani and other sources, Russia has continued to use this propaganda technique in its dealings with Ukraine and Syria, against NATO allies, as part of its interference in the 2016 United States elections, and to interfere with elections in other countries. In November 2017, Russian state media published a number of stories claiming that coalition forces were purposely allowing Islamic State fighters to escape from Abu Kamal, Syria; the stories included a so-called \\"satellite image\\" which was later found to be a screen capture from a video game. In 2019, according to science writer William J. Broad of The New York Times, Russia began a \\"firehose of falsehood\\" campaign to convince Americans that 5G phones were a health hazard, even as Putin was ordering the launch of 5G networks in Russia. According to author and former military intelligence officer John Loftus, Iran has been using similar methods to incite hatred against Saudi Arabia, the United States, and Israel. He claims that some fake news attributed to Russia was actually planted in the Western press by Iran. During Indonesia's 2019 presidential race, incumbent Joko Widodo accused Prabowo Subianto's campaign team of disseminating hateful propaganda aided by foreign consultants, citing \\"Russian propaganda\\" and the \\"firehose of falsehood\\" model. According to Mother Jones editor Monika Bauerlein, the firehose technique is increasingly being used against the press by American politicians. She warns readers to expect an increase in the use of several related tactics: the lawsuit threat, the \\"fake news\\" denial, and the ad hominem attack. Deepfake video also poses a serious threat, according to Belgian journalist , who warns that \\"we've only seen the beginning of fake news.\\" The firehosing technique has been successfully used by Antivaxxers to spread debunked theories about the supposed dangers of vaccination.Firehosing: the systemic strategy that anti-vaxxers are using to spread misinformation by Lucky Tran, The Guardian, November 7, 2019  Countermeasures  Traditional counterpropaganda efforts are ineffective against this technique. As researchers at RAND put it, \\"Don't expect to counter the firehose of falsehood with the squirt gun of truth.\\" They suggest: * repeating the counterinformation * providing an alternative story to fill in the gaps created when false \\"facts\\" are removed * forewarning people about propaganda, highlighting the ways propagandists manipulate public opinion * countering the effects of propaganda, rather than the propaganda itself; for example, to counter propaganda that undermines support for a cause, work to boost support for that cause rather than refuting the propaganda directly * turning off the flow by enlisting the aid of Internet service providers and social media services, and conducting electronic warfare and cyberspace operations Researchers at the German Marshall Fund suggest, among other things, being careful not to repeat or amplify the original false claim; repeating a false story, even to refute it, makes people more likely to believe it. Security expert Bruce Schneier recommends teaching digital literacy as part of an 8-step information operations kill chain. Another way to combat disinformation is to respond quickly as events unfold and be the first to tell the story. An example of this occurred in February 2018, when Syrian pro-regime forces began shelling Syrian Democratic Forces near Khasham and coalition forces responded in self-defense. The Combined Joint Task Force ‚Äì Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) immediately published a news release titled \\"Unprovoked attack by Syrian pro-regime forces prompts coalition defensive strikes.\\" In response to the news, reporters from around the world flooded the CJTF‚ÄìOIR with queries, which allowed CJTF‚ÄìOIR to establish the facts before Russian news outlets could \\"spin\\" the story. In \\"How We Win the Competition for Influence\\" (2019), military strategists Wilson C. Blythe and Luke T. Calhoun stress the importance of consistent messaging. They compare information operations to other weapons used by the military to target an enemy and achieve a desired result: \\"The information environment is an inherent part of today's battlefields.\\"  See also  * Disinformation * Gish gallop * Illusory truth effect * Post-truth politics * Propaganda techniques * Russian propaganda  References  Propaganda techniques ","title":"Firehose of falsehood"},{"id":"60610879","text":"Renaissance Academy may refer to one of several schools: *Crater Renaissance Academy a public high school in Central Point, Oregon. *East Los Angeles Renaissance Academy (ELARA), a public high school in East Los Angeles, California. *Highland Park Renaissance Academy, a public K-8 school in Highland Park, Michigan. *Renaissance Academy (Los Angeles), a former charter high school in Los Angeles, California. *Renaissance Academy (Baltimore), a charter high school in Baltimore, Maryland. *Renaissance Academy Charter School, a charter K-12 school in Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. *Renaissance Academy, a Small Learning Community within John Marshall High School (Los Angeles), a public high school in Los Angeles, California. *Renaissance Academy, an academic program within Albert Einstein High School, a public high school in Kensington, Maryland. *Renaissance Academy (of Arts, Science and Social Justice), a middle school (grade 6-8) in Alum Rock Union Elementary School District, San Jose, California. *Renaissance Academy, a special school within Davis School District, Kaysville, Utah. *Renaissance Public Academy, a charter school for grades 4‚Äì12 in Molalla River School District, Molalla River, Oregon. *Syracuse Renaissance Academy at Carnegie, an alternative school in Syracuse City School District, Syracuse, New York.

Historians‚Äô interpretation of artefacts, preserved by the Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79, identify that such foreign influences came largely from Greek and Hellenistic cultures of the Eastern Mediterranean, including Egypt. Greek influences were transmitted to Pompeii via the Greek colonies in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy), which were formed in the 8th century BC. Hellenistic influences originated from Roman commerce, and later conquest of Egypt from the 2nd century BC. Specifically, these cultures contributed to the development of Pompeii‚Äôs art, architecture and religious spheres. For instance, Greek influences can be identified in the Alexander Mosaic, horse- shoe shaped theatres and Pompeii‚Äôs adoption of the Greek pantheon of gods. Examples of Egyptian influences can be found in the Nile Mosaic, garden art in the Villa of Julia Felix and the Cult of Isis. TOC  Origin of Greek influences  The origins of Greek influences on Pompeii stems from an ancient region collectively known by the Romans as ‚ÄòMagna Graceia‚Äô: a term used to label the cities of southern Italy established by the Greeks in the eighth century BCE. The Greeks were attracted to this area due to the fertile land it offered and the advantageous trading position it controlled. As the settlement flourished, Greek influence was transmitted to Pompeii and the wider Roman world through these colonies. Rooted in this early link, Rome developed a deep and enduring fascination for Greek culture as they integrated its art, architecture and religion into their own society. The popularity of Hellenic culture grew following the successful Roman capture of Syracuse (212 BCE) and sack of Corinth (146 BCE) where plundered Greek art and architecture were brought back to Rome.  Greek influences on Pompeii  =Art= The Alexander Mosaic, House of the Faun  The Alexander Mosaic  The Alexander Mosaic, unearthed during an 1831 excavation of the House of the Faun, depicts a battle between Alexander the Great and Darius III of Persia alongside their respective armies. This mosaic is believed to be a copy of a famous Greek painting by Philoxenos of Eretria dated c. 300 BCE. It mirrors the elements of traditional Hellenistic art by both emphasising visual effects and drawing to attention the emotional reaction of the fighters.  The Three Graces Fresco  Discovered in the House of Titus Dentatus Panthera (on south wall of tablinum), the Three Graces fresco depicts the Graces dancing naked in a circle while holding sprigs of myrtle and wearing wreaths. The Graces (also known as the Charities) were minor goddesses of Greek mythology. The Three Graces mosaic, House of Titus Dentatus Panthera  Doryphoros  Numerous Roman copies of Doryphoros (‚ÄòSpear-Bearer‚Äô) have been found around Campania including one in Pompeii. This statue, dated 120‚Äì50 BCE and made from Carrara marble, is an imitation of the bronze Greek original by the famed sculptor Polykleitos.University of Cambridge (2019). ‚ÄúDoryphoros,‚Äù Museum of Classical Archaeology Database. Retrieved 30 April 2019. = Architecture = Basilica  Pompeii‚Äôs Basilica (built between 120 BC and 78 BC) was constructed in the Hellenistic style. The building featured two levels of Greek Corinthian and Ionic columns rather than Roman arches to support the roof. A ancient Greek stoa; a freestanding colonnade which created public spaces.  Palestra  Palestra, Pompeii The large Palestra of Pompeii, located in the eastern periphery of the city, adopts Greek architectural elements with its large, open colonnaded spaces. This Roman practice of constructing Palestras originates from the ancient Greek gymnasium, a complex similarly built for training and exercise.  Streetscapes  House of the Faun, the second peristyle The streetscape of Pompeii, with its use of insulae to divide the roads of the town into blocks.  Peristyle  The peristyle, based on Greek design, featured in several of Pompeii‚Äôs private buildings and villas. A peristyle was a colonnade or covered walkway around a courtyard which enclosed a garden. The House of The Faun depicts this architectural feature containing two peristyles: one built in the early 2nd century BC and the other in the late 2nd century BC. = Religion = Villa of Mysteries Fresco, Pompeii Temple of Apollo, Pompeii The Cult of Dionysus  Dionysus, the god of fertility and wine was worshipped by the Greeks. Romans called this god Bacchus. Associated with this cult was the ‚Äòbacchanalia‚Äô, a Latin term for the rites or festivals of Bacchus which according to Livy involved cult members participating in aggressive sexual promiscuity and alcohol-fuelled violence. In 186 BC the Roman senate, fearing that the unbridled nature of the festivals was a threat to public and political stability, outlawed the cult. Despite this, its practice still remained popular in Campania and evidence suggests Pompeii as well. For instance, The Villa of Mysteries displays a series of frescoes which many historians believe to depict a woman‚Äôs initiation into the cult of Dionysus. The Cult of Apollo Worship of Apollo, the Greek god of poetry, music, dance, archery and prophecy, was also incorporated into Pompeian religion. Pompeii‚Äôs forum contained a Temple dedicated to this god built in the 2nd century BC. The temple was surrounded by Corinthian columns, featured a travertine stone altar and was decorated by statues of Apollo alongside other deities.  Worship of Hercules  Infant Hercules strangling snakes, House of the Vettii The Romans adapted the Greek god Heracles and incorporated him into their own religion under the new Roman name Hercules. This hero was regarded as the son of Jupiter (the Roman equivalent of Zeus) and was renowned for his superhuman strength and fantastic adventures. The House of the Garden of Hercules, located to the west of Pompeii‚Äôs Palestra, illustrates the influence of this Grecian god. Specifically, the garden of this building contained a large lararium where a marble statuette of Hercules, an altar and aedicula were dedicated to him. The House of the Vettii provides further evidence. Within its reception room, on the left hand wall, an infant Hercules is depicted strangling a serpent. This fresco, painted in Fourth Style, recalls the mythological story of when Hera, enraged by Zeus‚Äô affair with Alcmene, sent snakes to kill their child Hercules. = Drama = Theatre mask mosaic, House of the Faun Ancient Greek theatre, originally developed in Athens during the 6th century BCE, Greek tragedy plays. Its popularity expanded into the Mediterranean where it was embraced by other Hellenistic cultures and Rome. This influence of Greek drama on Pompeii is portrayed in The House of the Faun. Uncovered within the remains of this building is a mosaic depicting two tragic theatrical masks surrounded by garlands, flowers and fruits. 15 drama masks recently rediscovered in Pompeii provide further evidence. These masks were life-sized, made of plaster and found in 1749 during a dig funded by King Charles of Bourbon. The exact location of where they were unearthed is not known as they were stored with a variety of other artefacts in the Royal Palace of Portici and 18th century dig journals provide only vague details of the excavation. = Literature = Achilles surrendering Briseis to Agamemnon, House of the Tragic Poet The works and writers of Greek literature held a great influence over Roman culture. Beyond impacting Roman writing itself, scenes from Greek literature have been discovered throughout Pompeii. For instance, The House of the Tragic Poet displays a series of frescos which illustrate events from the Iliad by the Greek poet Homer. One panel displays the hero Achilles seated before his tent as he involuntarily releases his lover Briseis to Patroclus who guides her to Agamemnon, the king of the Greeks. The following panel, of which only half survives, portrays Helen as she steps from her homeland onto a ship which will transport her to Troy. It is believed that the lost fragment may have shown Paris, already in the ship, waiting for Helen, his queen, to join him.  Origin of Egyptian influences  Rome had been politically intertwined with Egypt as early as the 2nd century BCE during the rule of Ptolemy VI, however it was during the conflict between Octavian (later named Augustus) and Mark Antony and Cleopatra VII that Rome underwent a period of being considerably influenced by Egyptian culture. Under Roman rule by the 30BCE, Egypt began transmitting spoils of war and new materials such as glass, papyrus, minerals and ores to Rome. This conquest and influx of goods sparked a new fascination with ancient Egyptian culture with Romans now incorporating Egyptian art, architecture and religion into their own lives.  Egyptian influences on Pompeii  The Nile Mosaic, House of the Faun = Art =  The Nile Mosaic  A mosaic within the House of the Faun depicts an Egyptian Nile scene complete with crocodiles, ichneumon, hippopotamus and ibis. Egyptian flora can also be seen on this mosaic. The Temple of Isis, Pompeii The Temple of Isis The Temple of Isis too portrayed an Egyptian influence on Pompeii‚Äôs art. Specifically, the walls of the temple are decorated with a variety of Egyptian mythological scenes. One fresco depicts the reception of lo by Isis at Canopus in Egypt. Isis in this artwork is surrounded by Egyptian animals (snakes and crocodiles) and motifs (such as a sphinx statue). Another fresco displays the event of navigum Isidis (the transport of Osiris by Isis) while another depicts Isaic priests and worshippers. A pentelic marble statue of Isis was also uncovered at this temple. Similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics and statues, she is shown with her right foot in front of the left and holding an ankh.Naples National Archaeological Museum (2019). ‚ÄúTemple of Isis\\". Retrieved 8 May 2019. = Architecture =  The House of Julia Felix  The peristyle (i.e. the garden) within The House of Julia Felix is believed to represent a branch of the Nile Delta, most likely the Canopus Canal in Egypt. This is due to the fact that it included a series of linked water channels and was decorated with statues, elegant stuccoed columns and marble walkways. 188x188pxDecorative use of Sphinxes The Egyptian sphinx was uncovered in various private and public houses in Pompeii. For example, within the House of the Faun there is a table stand in the form of a sphinx. In the Tepidarium of the Forum Baths is a brazier with sphinx shaped feet. = Religion =  The Cult of Isis  188x188px Isis was one of the central goddesses in ancient Egyptian religion and mythology. It is believed that the cult of Isis arrived in Pompeii approximately 100BC, most likely introduced by the Greeks. It became popular among slaves, freedmen, women and later the nobility with followers believing that Isis could grant eternal life as she resurrected her slain husband (Osiris) from the dead. The temple dedicated to her worship is located in the theatre and gymnasium district of Pompeii. At this temple priests held two daily ceremonies. The first, celebrated before sunrise, memorialised the re- birth of Osiris while the second, celebrated in the afternoon, blessed sacred Nile water to give thanks to Isis. The temple was destroyed during the 62 AD earthquake but was quickly rebuilt, displaying Isis‚Äô popularity in Pompeii.  Anubis  Priest with mask of Anubis, Temple of Isis Anubis was the Egyptian God of the dead, associated specifically with mummification and the afterlife. Believed to be one of Egypt‚Äôs oldest gods, he is represented as a black canine or as a man with a canine head. Within Pompeii, The House of the Golden Cupids has a shrine dedicated to a number of Egyptian deities including Anubis. In this shrine, Anubis is shown with his customary canine head and holds a caduceus denoting his assimilation with the Roman god Mercury. Further evidence for his worship can be drawn from the Pompeian Temple of Isis which contains a fresco depicting a priest wearing a mask of Anubis.  Bes  Fresco of Bes, Temple of Isis Bes was a minor Egyptian god of war, sexuality, humour and music, however predominantly he was regarded as the protector of children and pregnant women. Within ancient art, this god was commonly depicted as a monstrous dwarf with large eyes, ears and a bearded head, protruding tongue, bowlegs and pronounced genitals. Multiple portrayals of Bes have been uncovered in Pompeii. Within the Temple of Isis, on the north wall of the Sacrarium, Bes is represented seated on a chair. Excavations completed by the Anglo-American Project in Insulae VI have also produced several bronze coins with the figure of Bes imprinted on them. Specifically, these coins were a combination of imports from Ebusus and locally manufactured imitations. The Pompeian imitations were initially quite similar to their originals however over time the portrayal of Bes was simplified resulting in a vague stick figure illustration of the Egyptian god. Other unearthed coins portray Bes with symbols such as toads or horse heads while others depict him with a butting bull or the head of a Roman God, most commonly Apollo.

In 1950, she completed a BSc in physical education at PWU and continued to teach folk dance there. She also taught ballet at St. Paul College in Manila and creative dance at the Centro Escolar University. Santos received a Fulbright Scholarship to attend the University of Wisconsin, where she studied with Margaret H'Doubler. She also was a member of Orchesis, a student dance group at the university and took classes in modern dance with Martha Graham, Louis Horst, Hanya Holm, Jos√© Lim√≥n and Charles Weidman. She was able to audit classes in composition with Doris Humphrey. In 1923, she went to Switzerland, where she pursued further studies with Harald Kreutzberg and Mary Wigman. On her return to the Philippines, she resumed teaching. She also was a member of the Francisca Reyes-Aquino Filipiniana Dance Troupe. She married lawyer Ruben F. Santos. The couple settled in Quezon City, where she opened her own ballet studio. She began teaching dance at Far Eastern University in 1957. There she also formed the FEU Modern Experimental Dance Group. In 1978, she was recognized by the Ballet Federation of the Philippines for her contributions as a teacher and choreographer. In 1981, she received the Patnubay ng Sining at Kalinagan Award from the city of Manila and, in 1994, the Gawad CCP para sa Sining, an arts award, for dance.

The brownstone that housed it, just off of Logan Circle, became a private residence in 1997. The Hall was owned by the Confederate Memorial Association. Description The Hall was originally the Confederate Memorial Home, both a residence and a gathering place for Confederate veterans. In 1919, 54 years after the Civil War's end, with few veterans still alive, it was converted into the Confederate Memorial Hall, no longer a residence but a library, museum, and \\"social hall for white politicians from the South\\". Notices in newspapers tell of events held there: the United Sons of Confederate Veterans, a \\"musical entertainment\\" in 1909; the Children of the Confederacy hosted in 1913; the women's auxiliary, a benefit concert in 1914; the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a reception in 1916 and a benefit card party in 1917; open house in 1917 for those attending \\"the annual pilgrimage of Confederate veterans to Arlington\\". According to a 1997 web page kept active, the Hall had oil portraits of Jefferson Davis and Generals Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson, Sterling Price, Joseph E. Johnston, and Fitzhugh Lee. Also on display were an original print of the Burial of [William] Latane, a marble bust of General Robert E. Lee by \\"Lost Cause\\" sculptor Herbert Barbee, a Jefferson Davis sideboard, two chairs once the property of General Beauregard, \\"numerous battle flags\\", and the First National Flag of the Confederacy that flew during the siege of Atlanta. The library contained over 1,000 books. The Hall had a collection of Civil War-era musical instruments on which small concerts of Civil War-era music were performed, \\"a copy of Lee's farewell order to his troops after the Battle of Appomattox...as well as a yellowed legal copy of Davis' bail bond\\". During the 1960s and 70s, the building and the association fell on hard times. Membership declined, and the hall became a refuge for vagrants. Hurley, whose father was a member, stepped in and helped refurbish the building, partly with his own money. Activities \\"As the 20th century drew to a close, the CMA was sponsoring magnificent white tie grand balls, barbecues, horse events, and a myriad of activities that showcase Southern culture and its inherent good manners and abiding respect for others.\\" On January 17, 1987, the date chosen because Robert E. Lee's birthday was January 19, the Association held an $80 ( in current dollars)-per-couple ball and fundraiser. It featured \\"period dancing to Stephen Foster melodies played on antique instruments.\\" In March 1989, there was a fox hunt in Virginia. \\"In June there is a grand ball to celebrate the birthday of Jefferson Davis.\\" It claimed a membership of several thousand, but the only visible member is its president, John Edward Hurley (who calls it \\"my...organization\\"). Hurley, who is described as a White House correspondent on the Web site of the Justice Integrity Project, and is also member of a lobbying group, has been president since the 1980s. Sarah McClendon was on the Association's board. Legal saga resulting in its closure Richard T. Hines was a former South Carolina state legislator, U.S. General Services Administration official, commander of the Sons of Confederate Veterans chapter in Washington, and \\"a major neo-Confederate\\", who \\"in 1984...penned a paean to Preston Brooks, the secessionist South Carolina congressman who caned Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts on the Senate floor in 1854 for his speeches against slavery.\\" In 1987 he filed suit seeking to dismiss Hurley and the association's vice president, Mrs. John Tilden Rogers. Hines complained, among other things, that Hurley operated the building for personal gain, renting out rooms and pocketing the proceeds. \\"In one of the most bizarre cases to ever come before the courts\\", Hurley and Mrs. Rogers responded by suing Hines and six others, claiming they were victims of a legal coup. Hines and his followers countered with a $250,000 suit against Hurley and Mrs. Rogers. In 1990, Hurley filed a $5 million suit under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, charging Hines and others with perjury, mail fraud, and money-laundering, \\"among other misdeeds\\". The suit was dismissed with prejudice and defendants were awarded $69,066 in attorneys' fees. Over several years Hurley also accused various people and federal agencies with corruption and a variety of financial crimes, as well as drug trafficking. In a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno, he linked government corruption, and retribution for his whistleblowing, with the efforts to force members onto the Association's board and thus seize its building. Hurley said his life was threatened on several occasions. There was a fight inside the Memorial Hall in which the shirt of one of Hurley's rivals was torn from his body...and the fracas \\"nearly led to bloodshed.\\" \\"They call my wife and threaten her or threaten me and put notes on my door. That's Ku Klux Klan stuff.\\" \\"I'm relatively conservative myself...[b]ut their conservatism is off the chart as far as I'm concerned.\\" He was jailed briefly for contempt of court and fined $30,000 in court costs during this extended battle, \\"because he had failed to obey [the judge's] previous order requiring that Hurley add new members to the organization's board of directors\\". \\"According to Hurley, the individuals the judge had ordered on the board had affiliations with Oliver North's Contra operations.\\" What \\"the North/Republican operatives\\" really wanted was...\\"a beautiful front behind which it can run a nasty military/intelligence operation\\". To no avail, Hurley also reported the federal judge deciding his case, John H. Bayly Jr., to the District of Columbia Commission on Judicial Disabilities and Tenure. He alleged that Bayly \\"hired the plaintiffs to sue him\\", and feared \\"his own 'probable assassination' by the government as payback for his uncovering court complicity in cocaine trafficking.\\" According to Hurley, his \\"bizarre court odyssey\\" began in the 1980s when he cancelled an Oliver North \\"Freedom Fighter\\" fund-raising event, to be held at Confederate Memorial Hall, for \\"denizens of the Reagan Doctrine, a peculiar gathering of Nicaraguan contras, Afghan-based mujahedeen and members of the Angolan guerrilla group UNITA, which was funded by the South African apartheid regime.\\" He said he took this action because such political activity by his tax-exempt organization was prohibited by the Tax Code; in fact, Hurley's Association lost its 501 (c)(3) status for a few years, but regained it. \\"Hurley said that after ten years of litigation he can prove beyond a shadow of doubt that members of Oliver North's operation was [sic] using a Mid- Atlantic Credit Union account in Gaithersburg, Maryland, and a review of this account would prove the costs imposed on Hurley were fraudulent. Judge Bayly, however, quashed subpoenas for both Oliver North and the account without explanation. Hurley said that the board of trustees of his organization, which included those trustees that Judge Bayly had ordered on the board, had voted to sell the museum to cover the fines and costs that were being imposed by the courts.\\" The building was seized and sold in 1997 to pay $500,000 in contempt of court fines that Hurley received in District of Columbia courts for undisclosed reasons. It then became a private residence. \\"'Constitutional government is a thing of the past', Hurley sadly observed.\\" References 1997 disestablishments in Washington, D.C.

It sank off New Zealand in 1902, leading to the deaths of 13 crew and the loss of 499 bodies of gold miners which were being repatriated to southern China. This led to the end of the practice of exhuming and returning human remains, en masse, to China from New Zealand.  Final voyage  Lifeboats from the SS Ventnor after the sinking. The charitable association Cheong Sing Tong chartered the Ventnor to return the remains of 499 bodies exhumed from 40 cemeteries in New Zealand to their homes in southern China. These men, mostly gold miners, were from the Poon Yu, Seyip, Jung Seng and Dongguan districts. The rest of the cargo was listed as \\"5347 tons of coal for the Admiralty at Hong Kong, 144 sacks and 22 bales of fungus, one bale of tow and one bale of flax\\". The Ventnor left Wellington for Hong Kong on 26 October 1902. At about 12:30 am the next morning it struck a reef off Cape Egmont leading to damage. It was decided to continue to Auckland instead of returning to Wellington. The ship sank about off the coast, in water, near Hokianga Heads on 27 October at 8:45 pm. Most of the crew made it ashore, but 13 were killed as a life boat capsized. None of the Chinese bodies were recovered initially.  Aftermath  The conclusion of a magisterial inquiry given on 19 November 1902 found that the sinking occurred due to either negligence or incompetence. It was found that drunkenness could not be proven and that while the captain and master made good decisions after striking the reef, the blame for the striking lay with the captain alone. Over the next few months after the sinking, the remains of the Chinese gold miners began to be washed ashore. The local MƒÅori tribe (Te Roroa) buried their remains near their own burial grounds. Cheong Sing Tong hired the Energy to try to find the wreck and recover the bodies, but the wreck remained lost for over 100 years. Remains were repatriated to China for many years after the sinking on an individual basis, but the Ventnor was the last attempt at a mass shipment. In 2007 a connection was formalised between Te Roroa and the descendants of the Chinese gold miners. A grove of 22 kauri trees were planted and a Chinese gate constructed to memorialise the sinking. The wreck was discovered in 2012 and is now a National Heritage Site. The Bone Feeder is an opera featuring the story of the Ventnor. It was composed by Gareth Farr to a libretto written by Renee Liang (and developed from her 2009 play of the same name) which incorporates text in the English, Cantonese and MƒÅori languages. In June 2020 a documentary crew caused a controversy due to their filming of the wreckage.

The peak lies 0.73 miles north of Eldorado Peak and southeast of Perdition Peak. It can be seen from the North Cascades Highway west of Marblemount at a road pullout along the Skagit River. The first ascent of the peak was made in July 1940 by Lloyd Anderson, Karl Boyer, and Tom Gorton via the Northwest Ridge. Precipitation runoff and glacier meltwater from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate Dorado Needle is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains.Dorado Needle in winter As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The Triad The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. A small glacial remnant lies on the south slope of Dorado Needle, whereas the northern slope maintains the extensive McAllister Glacier. The U-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

As a non-profit organisation, the Institute is subsidised by the town of Hombourg-Haut, the Department of Moselle and the region Grand Est.  Publishing  The institute has made the inventory, presenting and making accessible to all interpreters, musicologists or students, works which henceforth can be considered as integral: that is 160 works completed of which only 90 were published by various well-known publishers of the period (Richault in Paris, Breitkopf & H√§rtel in Leipzig). Some having disappeared it was necessary to find their foundations often dispersedFor example the Missa Brevis op. 72, furthermore it was necessary to recover non published manuscripts. CD recordings, publications of new and first editions of the scores and much more besides, show the Institute‚Äôs wide activities. Close relationship has been established with the record company K 617 in order to make available major works of Th√©odore Gouvy such as his great dramatic cantatas Elektra op. 85, Egill op. 86 or the Stabat Mater op. 65, all for solos, choir and orchestra, needing new edition. The same for Chamber music works that were previously unpublished like the Septet and several string quartets and string quintets. In the years 2010, close relationship has also been established with the German record label cpo, in particular for the symphonies and the cantatas Oedipus in Colonna OpÔºé75 and Iphig√©nie en Tauride OpÔºé76. With the later, the Institute also worked closely with the German musicologist and conductor Joachim Fontaine. During the year 2013, a close cooperation has been run with the Palazetto Bru Zan. Have been organised performers residencies in Venice, recording sessions with the Li√®ge Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the rediscovery of several Gouvy's worksPresentation of the book-record on Anaclase website.

From 1867 onwards, the composer used to spend the summer in this stately manor house built by his brother Alexandre. Today it serves as an office for the institute and as a center of information with a permanent exhibit which shows aspects of Gouvy‚Äôs life as well as his musical estate fully accessible to the public. In constituting the ‚Äúhistoric and musical collection‚Äù the Institute gathered all Gouvy‚Äôs music, as well as the documents, photographs, correspondence, souvenirs and other objects linked with the composer‚Äôs life and to become the privileged place for the revival of Gouvy‚Äôs works. Thanks to the composer‚Äôs heirs who all spontaneously accepted the reconstitution of the evocative universe of this maestro with a rare destiny.  The Festival  See Th√©odore Gouvy International Festival  Research and cooperation with Universities  In 2006, working together with the University of Saarland the first international conference about Theodore Gouvy was arranged and took place in Sarrebruck and Hombourg-Haut.

The original plan was for construction to start 2013‚Äì2014, but the Brazilian financial crisis that it is suffering since 2015 has put all projects on standby, and the next prediction is for construction to start only by 2020. In 2016 the Brazilian government confirmed it was seeking South Korean assistance with the development of a S√£o Paulo regional rail network and in 2019, the cost was estimated at Rs 20 billion. Lines = S√£o Paulo to Sorocaba = The first line will depart from √Ågua Branca interchange station in S√£o Paulo and end in Sorocaba, a 500.000 inhabitants city about 100 km west of S√£o Paulo, stopping midway at S√£o Roque and a populous neighborhood of Sorocaba, Brigadeiro Tobias. The complete journey will take around 50 minutes = S√£o Paulo to Santos = The second line will depart from the to-be-built S√£o Carlos interchange station in S√£o Paulo and head to Santos, a 430.000 inhabitants city 50 km south of S√£o Paulo, in the coast, which an important beach town as well as Brazil's most important freight port. The train will stop in 2 cities along the way. The complete journey will take around 35 minutes. = S√£o Paulo to Campinas and Americana = The third, and probably the most important and urgent line, is the line connecting S√£o Paulo's √Ågua Branca interchange station to Jundia√≠, Campinas and Americana. Campinas is one of Brazil's largest regional centers, it is just 90 km north of S√£o Paulo, and has its own Metropolitan area with over 3 million inhabitants, Jundia√≠ is a 400.000 inhabitants city in between them, and Americana is a 200.000 inhabitants city in the north limit of the Campinas Region. The journey from S√£o Paulo to Jundia√≠ will take 20 minutes, to Campinas around 40 to 50 minutes and Americana just over an hour. = S√£o Paulo to S√£o Jos√© dos Campos = The fourth route will leave from the Penha intermodal station and head to S√£o Jos√© dos Campos, a 710.000 inhabitants city 100 km east of S√£o Paulo, which is a very important tech center, with the headquarters of Embraer, for example, two public and multiple private universities, and which also possesses a large industrial complex, ranging from automotive and military to chemical and metal-mechanical. = Other routes = There are also future plans for other important routes such as from Sorocaba to Paulinia, Campinas to Piracicaba and Campinas to Rio Claro.

Members of Kulturbund in Maribor take authority from Yugoslav police during the April 1941 German annexation of northern Slovenia. Swabian- German Cultural Association () or Kulturbund was a cultural, social, and political organization of the ethnic Germans in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. During World War II, the Kulturbund promoted Nazism in the Yugoslavian German community and collaborated with the German occupational authorities. Founded in June 1920 in Novi Sad, it was originally conceived as a cultural and social organization representing the interests of the nearly 500,000 ethnic Germans in Yugoslavia in the interwar period and preserving their culture and language by promoting German-language education and publishing a German-language newspaper, the Deutsches Volksblatt, while also campaigning for Germans' land rights. In the 1920s, the organization's motto was \\"faithful to country, faithful to nation\\" (), which the Kulturbund leadership intended as a gesture of loyalty to the newly founded Yugoslavian state while also working to represent the interests of the German minority. However, some historians have argued that Germans (as well as Hungarians) in Yugoslavia did not collectively develop an allegiance to their new country for myriad reasons, including Serbo-Croatian's legal status as the official language; the German community's negligible influence on the drafting of the 1921 constitution and lack of representation in subsequent government administrations; the higher taxes levied on the provinces of Vojvodina and Slovenia, where the majority of the Yugoslavian Germans lived; and the exclusion of German peasant farmers from the agrarian reforms of the late 1910s and early 1920s. In 1922, the Kulturbund organized the German Party, a conservative minority political party that held between five and eight seats in the Parliament of Yugoslavia in the 1920s, until it was banned during the 6 January Dictatorship. While the organization was controlled by an older generation of conservative, Roman Catholic ethnic Germans in the 1920s and early 1930s, the Kulturbund came under the control of younger pro-Nazi elements in the late 1930s, partly because of the machinations of the SS-controlled Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle. In 1939, Nazi-sympathizer and collaborator Sepp Janko was elected president of the organization. Janko claimed that by summer 1940, the organization had 300,000 members and was actively trying to recruit the additional 200,000 Germans living in Yugoslavia. During the Axis Invasion of Yugoslavia, the Kulturbund acted as fifth column. In March 1941, the Nazi agents of the Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle covertly instructed Yugoslavian Germans that if they should be conscripted into the Yugoslavian military, they should desert at the first opportunity and flee to Nazi Germany via Hungary. Additionally, Janko covertly organized a paramilitary group under the guise of a sports organization in order to aid the German military. After the Yugoslavian defeat in April 1941, the Axis powers partitioned and occupied Yugoslavia. Yugoslavian Germans were divided between four different occupation zones and puppet states. While local chapters of the Kulturbund continued to operate throughout occupied Yugoslavian territory during the war, Sepp Janko's centralized Kulturbund saw its jurisdiction drastically shrink. Novi Sad, the location of the organization's headquarters, was occupied by Hungary, and the Janko received instructions from Berlin to move his headquarters to Banat, where the Kulturbund was tasked with organizing Volksdeutsche collaborators among the region's 130,000 ethnic Germans. In 1944, when the Axis was losing the war in the Balkans, members of the Kulturbund were some of the loudest voices calling for ethnic Germans to abandon their land, evacuate Yugoslavia and head to safer areas of the German Reich.

Originally devised in the early 20th century as a specialised hospital for infectious diseases, Curry Cabral Hospital currently offers many other specialities: it is perhaps best known as the national reference centre on liver transplantation and hepato- bilio-pancreatic diseases, and as the only public physical medicine and rehabilitation inpatient care service in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area. It is named after Jos√© Curry da C√¢mara Cabral (1844‚Äì1920), eminent clinician and medical researcher who was instrumental in the creation of the hospital in 1906. History In the early 20th century, there was a need for a specialised hospital in Lisbon dedicated to the care of infectious diseases. Up until the end of the previous century, contagious diseases were treated in the general Saint Joseph's Hospital, until 1892, when the vacant Convent of Our Lady of Nazareth (Convento de Nossa Senhora da Nazar√©) in Arroios was repurposed as the Arroios Hospital, an isolation hospital for smallpox and consumptive diseases. However, the old convent was not entirely adequate for the task, and a new specialised hospital was built as a series of 22 modern pavilions holding more than 700 beds. The place chosen for it was a vacant plot of land that had originally belonged to an old Franciscan nunnery, the Convent of Our Lady of Sorrows (Convento de Nossa Senhora das Dores), in the neighbourhood of Rego, in the Avenidas Novas area of Lisbon that was developing at the time as the city expanded north. The creation of this new hospital was only possible through the personal involvement of Prime Minister Hintze Ribeiro and a substantial grant from Caixa Geral de Dep√≥sitos, the largest Portuguese public banking corporation. Construction concluded in December 1904 and the first patients, transferred from Arroios Hospital, were admitted in January 1906. Rego Hospital (Hospital do Rego), as it was soon after known, was renamed Curry Cabral Hospital in 1929, as a homage to its founder, Jos√© Curry da C√¢mara Cabral, Chief Infirmerer (Enfermeiro-Mor) of the city's general hospital, who had long advocated the establishment of a specialised hospital for communicable diseases. From its inception, Curry Cabral Hospital became a part of the city's hospital centre, then collectively known as \\"Saint Joseph's Hospital and Annexes\\" (Hospital de S√£o Jos√© e Anexos) and from 1913, called the \\"Civil Hospitals of Lisbon\\" (Hospitais Civis de Lisboa, HCL), nowadays the Central Lisbon University Hospital Centre (Centro Hospitalar Universit√°rio de Lisboa Central, CHULC). In July 1978, when the Regulation of the Civil Hospitals of Lisbon (Regulamento dos Hospitais Civis de Lisboa) was issued, Curry Cabral Hospital changed its vocation from a specialised hospital for infectious diseases to a general hospital, with administrative autonomy from 1989 onwards. In the late 1990s, the hospital's infrastructure, virtually unchanged since its inception nearly a century prior, was showing signs of obvious deterioration and underwent much-needed modernisation. In 2019, Curry Cabral Hospital became the first hospital in the National Health Service to be endowed with a robotically assisted surgical system, donated by the Aga Khan Foundation. In 2020, during the containment phase of the coronavirus pandemic, Curry Cabral Hospital (along with Hospital de Dona Estef√¢nia for pediatric cases in Lisbon, and Hospital de S√£o Jo√£o in Porto) was one of the three first-line referral hospitals for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19; multiple other second-line hospitals were later activated throughout the country, until mitigation phase.

Conscription was introduced into what would become the Soviet Union in 1918, almost immediately after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 to strengthen the forces of the Red Army. Following its introduction, conscription remained a constant presence in the Soviet state until its dissolution in 1991. Various policy amendments changed the volume of conscription intakes and the required length of service, with key changes to policy occurring in 1918, 1938 and 1967. Wartime conscription, specifically during World War II, saw a significant increase in conscription intake as well as a broadening of the pool of candidates available to be conscripted. Unlike in countries without a consistent history of conscription (such as the United States), there was relatively little resistance to conscription policy, as the concept was enshrined in the Soviet constitution as a mandatory requirement of citizenship, regardless of identity or status, and was seen as the national duty of all Soviet military-aged men. TOC  Historical periods  = 1917‚Äì1939 = After the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia in 1917, the new communist government briefly experimented with a volunteer system of army recruitment but returned to the former system of conscription almost immediately in May 1918. The policy saw few changes until September 1, 1939, when a new Law on Universal Military Service was enacted following the outbreak of WWII across Europe. This new law saw large increases in terms of service periods, ages of conscription and a restriction of potential exemptions. The general period of service was increased from 2 to 3 years, and conscription age was lowered from 19 to 17 for young boys. Previous exemptions for those pursuing higher education were abolished, as well as exemptions on the grounds of family reasons (such as having several young children). The plan behind the increased conscription terms was to create two large groups of trained reserves, one for men up to 40 years of age, and the other for men up to 50 years of age. = World War II= Ukrainian conscript farewells family; Nikolayev, Ukrainian SSR, 1941 The Soviet Union officially entered World War II on June 22, 1941, when Germany launched a surprise attack against their western border. Soon after, in October 1941 the government passed a new military service law which states that all male citizens from the ages of 16 to 28 were liable for military service. On 9 February 1942, Stalin issued an order which stated it would be expedient to ‚Äúconscript into the ranks of the Red Army‚Ä¶ citizens in the liberated territories between the ages of 17 to 30 who have not been conscripted into the Red Army during the previous months of the war‚Äù due to the fact they were ‚Äúburning with hatred for the invader and a desire to participate in the subsequent liberation of their Soviet Motherland with weapons in their hands.‚Äù Following this order, non- Russian inhabitants of liberated territory began to be forcibly conscripted into the Red Army ranks as it moved westward toward Germany. This broadening of the conscription pool created a diverse range of military personnel along the front lines, with soldiers of many different nationalities, ethnicities and languages being present. Soviet conscripts entering Voroshilov Barracks in Moscow, 1941 = 1945‚Äì1991 = In 1950 a secretive amendment to the service law saw the term of active service increased by one year. It is speculated that this increase was a response to America‚Äôs involvement in the Korean war, however was chosen to be kept off of official records such as the Proceedings of the Supreme Soviet (link) so that the US would not learn of the increase and suspect the Soviet Union of preparing for war themselves. Then in 1955, the service term was reduced back down to three years from four in the air forces, coast-guard and coastal defence, and to four years from five in the Navy. This decision again was kept off official records, but was presumably part of the planned cut in manpower forces, announced in August 1955 and May 1956 On 12 October 1967 a major amendment to the service law saw service periods shortened from 3 years to 2, and also saw the frequency of call-ups increase to twice per year. This amendment is said to have been caused by the large increase in young men reaching military age around this time. In order to adhere to the concept of ‚Äòuniversal service‚Äô whilst maintain the size of the armed forces, conscript turnover was increased so that a large majority of boys reaching military age were still conscripted to serve, but not at the expense of increasing the size of the armed forces by unnecessary proportions. Following the 1967 amendment, conditions for conscripts worsened considerably, with reports of abuse, hazing and even murder of conscripted soldiers becoming widespread. Conscripted soldiers, particularly those in their first year of service who had not yet earned either rank or respect to protect them, faced physical violence and sexual assault from superior officers, and regularly had their pay and food rations confiscated. Any resistance to such abuse was met with beatings, sometimes resulting in severe injuries, disability discharges and even death. The official system of promoting some just recruited able soldiers to sergeants so that they were already in commanding positions shortly after enrollment into the armed forces, was undermined by an unofficial system structured around the years of service spent by each conscript. Junior conscripts became the subordinates to more experienced conscripts who had already served one or two years. This system was not recognised, however it became entrenched in conscript culture during the 1970s and 1980s. 293x293px Traditionally, all full-time Soviet students benefited from a draft postponement until graduation. If the college/university had a military chair (which provided training in a particular military specialty), its students became reserve officers and exemption from service as soldiers. Without a military chair the graduates were conscripted for shortened term. For many people, an intention to avoid or at least to defer soldier service was the main reason for studying. However between late autumn 1982 and 1988 Soviet Union had the mandatory draft for students of the most universities with the peak conscription fraction in 1987. Students were drafted for two or, if for the navy, three years of soldier service typically after termination of the first or second academic year.  Conscription of Women  The Soviet Union conscripted the most women for combat, comparative to other national military during wartime and especially during WWII. It is difficult to know the exact number of women conscripted during WWII and in what roles they served, as information about female soldiers was generally repressed in official reports and government documents from that period. However recently efforts have been made to uncover and rectify the records of female service personnel in the Soviet Union. In the 1938 amendment to the service law, it was stated that any woman with relevant training and education, such as medical or mechanical would be liable for conscription service during times of war. Three all-female aviation unit were formed in late 1941 after an official decree from Stalin on the 8th of October 1941. This was only 4 months after the Soviet Union officially entered WWII, and by late march 1942 over 100,000 women had already been conscripted into air defence units. By the end of the war, the air defence force was more than 1/4 female, with 300,000 women, both volunteers and conscripts serving as communicators, machine gunners, pilots and medical personnel. Most female conscripts served behind the front lines in secondary positions and roles in an attempt to free up more men for front line duty. However it is believed that many women also served in combat positions, such as in tank regiments or along the front line. The increased female presence in the armed forces during WWII also led to an improvement in sanitary conditions. On the 11th of April 1943 it was ordered that soap rations for women personnel be increased to 100 grams per month, 50% more than their male counterparts.  Resistance to Conscription  The first widespread and organised resistance to conscription policy began in the 1980's due to the growing public awareness of the harsh conditions faced by conscripted soldiers, as well as the loosening of government restrictions on things such as public organisations and freedom of speech under the Perestroika and Glasnost reforms. Within the armed forces resistance grew in the form of organised ethnic and nationality groups in order to protect each other from abuse and call attention to the treatment suffered by conscripts. In October 1989 a group of junior officers formed the Union for the Social Protection of Servicemen and their Families which publicised conscripts stories and conducted protests against government handling of the conscription policy. Outside of the armed forces, the most prolific public group which spoke out against conscription was the Committee of Soldiers Mothers, later changed to the Union of the Committees of Soldiers' Mothers of Russia in 1998. The group was founded in 1989 and aimed to record and publicise the treatment of conscripts within training and barracks centres. The group also organised public protests and called for government action to protect the rights of soldiers and conscripts whilst they served.  Conscription methods  In times of peace, the general conscription method was to conscript young boys, either 19 or 18 who had just finished high school or completed a trade. Under the 1938 law, one call up was conducted each year in October/November to induct conscripts for three years of service, unless they were in the Navy for which service terms were 4 years. These terms of service changed over the history of the Soviet Union as new drafts to the service law were enacted to reflect the growing and diminishing populations and external threat levels. Programs conducted by the government in elementary and secondary school usually meant that newly conscripted privates had already received a degree of military training and could bypass the usual basic training. However in times of war, specifically WWII, conscription methods became a lot less bureaucratic, with anyone who appeared to be of age forcibly conscripted from areas that had been taken back from German control. Soldiers in these liberated areas would comb haystacks, search forests etc. for those thought to be evading service.

Connecting heavily with the correlating policy of linkage, the policy was intended to exploit the ongoing rivalry between the two Communist powers (following the Sino-Soviet split (1956‚Äì1966)), as a means to strengthen American hegemony and diplomatic interest. Interrelating primarily with the subsequent development of the d√©tente era (1969‚Äì1979) during the Cold War, Triangular Diplomacy was instituted in order to manage the decline of American authority during the Vietnam War following the inefficiencies of former offensive policies such as Eisenhower‚Äôs ‚Äòrollback‚Äô and George Kennan‚Äôs ‚Äòcontainment‚Äô. Hence, triangular diplomacy was an instrumental facet in the shifting of Cold War policy toward talks of co-operation and diplomacy, and thus set a precedent for the eventual relaxation of tensions between the two superpowers through a focus on mutual benefit (as evidenced in the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) and the Strategic Arms Reduction (START) treaties).  Terminology  In principle, the policy of triangular diplomacy seeks to link the interests of three powerful states in order to retain a balance of power within the international system. Most commonly, this involves an insecure state (or states) pursuing strategic alliances or economic deals in an attempt to both weaken the hegemony of a powerful adversary and strengthen their own position. First developed by US advisor Henry Kissinger during the Vietnam War era, the policy was argued to be most effective when reliant upon ‚Äúthe natural incentives and propensities of the players.‚Äù Conceived in a period of American political weakness, Kissinger‚Äôs doctrine argues that foreign policy needed to rely on a combination of diplomacy and military power in order to bring benefits to all relevant players, and subsequently ensure international stability.Lukacsova, V. (2009). Kissinger's Triangular Diplomacy. [online] Available at: https://old.bisla.sk/sk/wp- content/uploads/2015/05/Lukacsova_Veronika-Bakalarska-praca.pdf [Accessed 6 May 2019]. This doctrine heavily relates to a neorealist analysis of international politics, professed by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz. Kissinger‚Äôs desires to seek a ‚Äúcoalition‚Äù with China in order to stabilise the power of the Soviet Union reflects the neorealist balance of power theory, as insecure states are seeking to bring an equilibrium to the international order in an attempt to bring peace and benefit the relevant actors.  Vietnam War  Entering into the White House during the height of the Vietnam War, one of Kissinger‚Äôs primary intentions with his policy was to gain Soviet and Chinese assistance in softening North Vietnamese troops, and withdrawing from the conflict with dignity. The Sino-Soviet split offered a ripe opportunity for Kissinger and Nixon to enact such a policy, intended by offering integration into the international trade system, scientific and technological resources and a stabilization of bilateral relations. The first instance of this rapprochement and the beginnings of triangular diplomacy within US policy is reflected in a 14th August 1969 National Security meeting, in which Nixon positioned his intentions to victimise China within the Sino-Soviet split and seek to offer assistance. 216x216pxThe following 1972 Beijing and Moscow summits further exacerbated the existing tensions between China and the Soviet Union, allowing Nixon and Kissinger to gain Soviet co-operation on matters deemed important to US foreign policy. This can be examined in the outcome of the 1972 Spring Offensive, as the United States were able to gain diplomatic co-operation in reaching a peace with North Vietnamese forces. Many scholars contend that Nixon‚Äôs rapprochement with China, as part of the triangular diplomacy framework, was an instrumental facet in the dissolution of the Vietnam War. Historian Raymond Garthoff argues that triangular diplomacy held a significant bearing on the settlement of the Vietnam War, whilst Jussi Hanhim√§ki contends that the policy played a critical role in bringing about changes in North Vietnamese negotiation strategy. However, triangular diplomacy did not ensure immediate stability and peaceful cooperation. The Vietnamese War continued in full force for three years after the emergence of the policy, with continued US-Soviet conflict evolving underneath. For Kissinger and Nixon, the policy was secondary to national interests and security concerns, as the nation needed to appear politically powerful against adversaries.  D√©tente  Following the Vietnam War, Kissinger sought to reshape the US approach to international relations, seeking a balance of power which can produce stability between the three key players in the international system; the Soviet Union, the United States and China, and subsequently reduce military and political tensions. Triangular diplomacy consequently included the aim of achieving this balance of power and pursuing the policy of detente with the Soviet Union, as Nixon and Kissinger saw that correlating the interests of each power was instrumental in stabilizing the international order. In The White House Years, Kissinger argued that the opening to China and detente with the Soviets were connected policies, intended to exploit the pre-existing tensions between the states in American interest. Stating that it was better for the United States ‚Äúto be closer to either Moscow or Peking than either was to the other‚Äù, as American bargaining power would strengthen two- fold.Mao Zedong and US President Richard Nixon, during his visit in China Key outcomes of triangular diplomacy during this period include the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT), the signing of the Shanghai Communiqu√© and the Camp David Accords, each of which were achieved as a result of Kissinger and Nixon's policy. However, depicted as a sign of American political weakness, the policy of d√©tente was ultimately overhauled. American nationalists saw the policy as a way for the Soviet Union to manipulate the US under the pretenses of diplomacy, evidenced by their refusal to ratify the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty and the gains received from Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik. In addition, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 solidified the re- invigoration of Cold War hostilities and the conclusive end of the d√©tente period. As a result, Nixon and Kissinger were removed from political power, to be succeeded by the administration of Gerald Ford, and triangular diplomacy was overlooked for the remainder of the Cold War.  After the Cold War  Following the Cold War, the premise of triangular diplomacy shifted from Nixon and Kissinger's definition to a ‚Äúcoordinated action by two states (which, in keeping with the triangle metaphor, we refer to collectively as the base) to change behaviour of another state (the ‚Äútarget‚Äù)\\". As nuclear capabilities became an established facet within international relations policy, so to did continued attempts by United States administration to enforce triangular diplomacy with China and the United States. Dmitry Medvedev and Hu Jintao A key example of this dynamic is the 2001 Sino-Russian Treaty of Friendship, signed between President Vladimir Putin and President Jiang Zemin. The signing of this treaty represented a diplomatic effort to strengthen Russian and Chinese influence in dealings with the United States, and a subsequent return to the triangular diplomacy framework. Results of this treaty included; the modernization of Chinese armed forces and stable levels of fuel shipments to aid the construction of the Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean oil pipeline, and the increase of Russian sources of capital following the dissolution of the Soviet state. The New York Times argued that while this manifestation of triangular diplomacy was \\"a new form‚Ä¶with diminished strategic significance\\", the treaty forces the US to pay more regard to both nations and act in accordance with their wishes in order to ensure their unipolar political position, following the Cold War. = Indo-Pacific and United States relations = The political interactions between the United States, India and China have come to reflect this new wave of triangular diplomacy. Following the rise of China to parity with the United States, attentions turned to India, as the third largest Asian economy and fourth biggest spender on defence in the Indo- Pacific region, in order to connect political motivations regarding trade and naval capabilities. Following US-Indian discussions regarding US withdrawal from Afghanistan and fears of an eventuating power vacuum in the area, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta stated that \\"New Delhi was a ‚Äúlynchpin‚Äù in a new US military strategy focused on Asia‚Äù. Seeking a policy to expand military presence in the Indo-Pacific, US interests were subsequently met by assurances from the Chinese defense minister, Liang Guanglie, of improved relations and co-operation within the new Asian balance of power. However, the growing naval profiles of both China and India within the Pacific and subsequent localisations of military rivalry, position China within capability to establish uni-polar control over the Asia-Pacific, thus spurring a coalition between the US and India. Nonetheless, coming with concerns from Indian leaders regarding the inconsistencies of American policy towards China. Scholar C. Raja Mohan contends that as a result, these ambiguities manifest in uncertainty surrounding the terms of triangular diplomacy being exercised in this instance, however cementing a certain ‚Äúintersection of their maritime policies with those of the United States‚Äù and are ‚Äúbound to churn the security politics of the Indo-Pacific for decades to come.‚Äù = Ukraine crisis = A contemporary reflection of triangular diplomacy can be examined through political interactions in regards to the Ukrainian Crisis. In particular, the interactions between the United States, the European Union and the Russian Federation. In attempts of the EU and US to balance the power of Russia, this policy can be examined through the correlation of the European Union and United States economic sanctions, the outsourcing of crisis resolution to the European Union, Ukraine‚Äôs efforts to increase transatlantic diplomacy and Russia‚Äôs efforts to undermine it. In addition to marking the rise of the EU as a major international actor in foreign policy, the Ukraine crisis marks a shift in triangular diplomacy away from its neorealist inclination, to more of a liberal position regarding international cooperation, as the US and EU sought to assist the Ukraine in an attempt to ensure peace as opposed to serving national interests. Liu He, May 2018 = Trump administration = The foreign policy of the Trump administration has found similarities with that of triangular diplomacy; in particular, regarding American involvement in the Asia-Pacific region in an attempt to balance out the power of China. Washington advisors Alexander Gray and Peter Navarro have aligned their intentions to implement a more muscular foreign policy in the region, in order to manage the growing power of China through improved relations with Taiwan, hence implementing triangular diplomacy principles. Washington Post writer Marc Thiessen argues that this is to be achieved through free trade agreement and upgrading the state‚Äôs political representation, following Trump‚Äôs unstable position regarding the One China policy.  International relations theory  political cartoon by Honore Daumier, L‚ÄôEquilibre Europea, representing the balance of power as men in differing military uniforms balancing the earth on bayonets The triangular diplomacy framework is contingent upon the realist and neo-realist analysis of international politics, which advocates a zero sum form of geopolitical conflict, through which the overriding paradigms of statism, survival and self help define political interactions.Dunne, T., & Schmidt, B. C. (2014). Realism. In S. Baylis & Owens (Eds.), The globalization of world politics: an introduction to international relations. Oxford: Oxford University Press. By attempting to connect the interests of competing powers in order to manifest a mutual political benefit, Kissinger's policy reflects the realist Balance of Power theory which argues that national and global stability is secured when military capability is distributed correspondingly amongst states, in order to avoid global unipolarity. As can be examined within the Vietnam War era, in the attempt of one state to ensure their own survival in the global anarchic system through increasing economic and military strength, this in turn fuels the insecurities of less powerful states. As a result, insecure states seek to form a coalition and subsequently balance out the power of their superior, thus bringing security to the international system.Waltz, K. (1979). Theory of International Politics. Boston: McGraw-Hill Higher Education Hence, reflecting the formation of a coalition between the United States and China in response to the growing power of the Soviet Union within the Vietnamese sphere, in order to achieve a level of global stability through d√©tente. As per scholar Raymond Aron, an achievement of this system will consequently manifest peace, as a ‚Äúmore or less lasting suspension of rivalry between political units‚Äù will ensue.Aron, R. (1966). Peace and War. New York: Doubleday. p. 151. However, as is evidenced from the inherent US unipolarity which has marked the 21st century, and failures of triangular diplomacy to substantiate such a peace, scholars Wohlforth, Little and Kaufman argue that these facets evidence the failures of the balance of power theory to correlate within the contemporary international environment.Wohlforth, W., Little, R., & Kaufman, S. (2007). Testing Balance- of-Power Theory in World History. European Journal of International Relations, 13(2), 155-185. doi: 10.1177/1354066107076951 Moreover, positioning triangular diplomacy as a point of contention within international relations theory, as whilst its tenets subscribe to realist thought, its developments within the contemporary era have positioned it against a constructivist or post- structuralist approach to international politics, advocated by scholars such as Wendt.

As a trained historian, Doyle analyses the decline in US international authority against the modern developments of triangular diplomacy, as a result of a post-Cold War power shift in the Indo- Pacific geopolitical region. His authoritative methodology manifests a highly credible account on these changes within the nature of triangular diplomacy, and the epochal international policy developing within the Indo-Pacific theatre as a result of the declining authority of the US. * Hanhimaki, J. (2003). Selling the ‚ÄúDecent interval‚Äù: Kissinger, triangular diplomacy, and the end of the Vietnam war, 1971‚Äì73. Diplomacy & Statecraft, 14(1), 159‚Äì194. As a leading historian on Cold War international relations, Hanhimaki's comprehensive account of triangular diplomacy allows for a multifaceted insight into Kissinger's motivations behind the policy. His interdisciplinary methodology, in addition to the credibility gained through publication in the Diplomacy & Statecraft journal, sets Hanhimaki's work as invaluable to a study of triangular diplomacy, through his fresh insights into Kissinger's subsequent provocation of Sino-Soviet competition in Indochina. * Daum, A., Gardner, L., & Mausbach, W.

More generally, privatisation is a set of economic policies that is part of a broader system of deregulation of government services, underpinned by the ideology of neoliberalism, in order to achieve economic outcomes of growth, efficiency and productivity. Some examples of sectors that have been privatised include finance, telecommunications and infrastructure. Australia's public service has also transformed with the introduction of New Public Management (NPM) in the late twentieth century which altered public administration models to appear more \\"business-like\\" through performance evaluations that emphasise efficiency, productivity and service delivery. Another definition of privatisation is reliance on \\"more on private institutions and less on government, to satisfy people‚Äôs needs‚Äù. The concept of privatisation can be construed in a narrow or broad sense. The narrow scope of privatisation is portrayed as the sale of public goods, while the broader understanding of privatisation involves the transfer of \\"ownership, management, finance and control\\" of public goods to private actors. Historically, the Australian government played an influential role in society as the idea of a strong state was prevalent to the Australian story since Federation. This changed in the twentieth-century, as Australia's adoption of privatisation as a set of government policies, reflected the rise of privatisation across the Western world, specifically in the United States and United Kingdom. The Australian experience of privatisation involves substituting government ownership, provision and funding to the private sector, in an attempt to liberalise the economy. The effectiveness of such policies is contested, as the motivations of privatisation are widely debated. TOC  History  = 20th century = While economic literature points to the United Kingdom as being the first government to use privatisation in the modern era, the Nazi government in Germany undertook a series of privatisation policies to consolidate control of power over the economy. While it may appear contradictory that privatisation consolidates control over the economy, the Nazis realised that the economic fortunes of privatisation would flow to Nazi officials who would subsequently, \\"exert control over the economy.\\" Australia's 23rd Prime Minister (1983-1991) Bob Hawke initiated reforms that modernised the economy. In Australia, the greatest influence on privatisation were the policies of the Thatcher government, who ‚Äúunleashed a wave of privatizations that transformed the economy‚Äù and became a model for other Western economies. Unlike the rest of the world, Australia's privatisation program was relatively early as it first commenced in the 1990s, under the Hawke Labor Government. The New South Wales state government began the process of privatisation earlier than the federal government, in 1989. Australia's first act of privatisation occurred in 1991, when the federal government sold the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, followed by the partial sale of Telstra and Qantas, all of which were significant national icons. The sectors most affected by privatisation in the 1990s, were finance, electricity and transport, estimating profits of up to $61 billion from both federal and state privatiaation policies. Consequently, Australia became second ranked in the world for privatisation profits, employing one of the most comprehensive programs, the effects of which are continuing to impact the economy. = Hawke-Keating Government (1983‚Äì1996) = The Hawke-Keating Labor Government's were instrumental in implementing deregulation policies that resulted in modernizing Australia's economy. Emerging industries replaced traditional ones that suddenly became non-competitive, as productivity in the finance, education and legal sector increased, as real wages grew concurrently. The decision to transition the Australian Dollar to a floating exchange rate in 1983 increased stability and confidence in the economy, as part of the deregulation program, that laid the foundations for a modern economy. While privatization is supported by neoliberal ideology that stipulates less government intervention in the economy, Australia's history of privatisation was initiated under a Labor government, which appears to defy Labor Party policy objectives. However, during the Hawke-Keating years, there were attempts to remove the ideological underpinnings of the debate on privatisation, as the approach taken by the government was \\"more about a pragmatic choice\\" to modernise and open the economy to international markets. Prime Minister Hawke said, \\"The difference between us will be one of ideology. That will distinguish us from the opposition (Liberals).\\" Hawke was rebuking the charge that Labor had abandoned its commitments to public ownership and enterprise, while highlighting the need for economic rationalism in order to address pressing economic problems. The consensus-style leadership of Bob Hawke enabled structural economic reforms, through the Accord struck in 1983 between Labor and the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). This accord brought together various stakeholders from unions, welfare organisations and the business community, to secure a mandate for market-oriented economic reforms, while remaining committed to social progress. = Howard Government (1996‚Äì2007) = Privatization was implemented by successive governments, including the Howard Government in 1996 to 2007, which saw record rates of continuous economic growth, a testament which economists attribute to the economic reforms of the Hawke-Keating Government. Economists indicate the continuous rates of economic growth were not the result of Howard's policies of privatization, but rather, to one of the world's biggest booms in the mining sector, where investments rose from 2 to 8 percent of GDP. The difference between privatization under Hawke-Keating and Howard governments, is argued to be one of ideology, however this does not suggest the Labor Party was not divided on this issue and continues to be. Privatization remained part of government policy through the twenty-first century, as it represented a form of economic rationalism.  Types of Privatisation  The following methods of privatisation are common for governments to employ: 1\\\\. Divestiture: The sale of public services to private industry. This is one of the simplest methods of privatisation, where all aspects of a government asset are sold off to private buyers. 2\\\\. Withdrawal: The Government no longer supplies a service and enables private providers to enter. Therefore, it withdraws from the public sphere and enables the market to fill the void. 3\\\\. Outsourcing: Governments, through a contractual agreement, confers non-core functions of a service to ‚Äúprivate service providers to deliver services to the public.‚Äù Paul Keating announcing the floating of the Australian Dollar in 1983, as part of the economic program of deregulation 4\\\\. Divestment: Leasing or selling public assets to the private sector, however the government has some control over the regulatory mechanisms of the private asset . 5\\\\. Public- Private-Partnership (PPP): Private financing of infrastructure, through an agreement with private corporations. An example of this is Sydney's WestConnex project, where the government offsets the risk of construction to Transurban, a private company, which also removes the burden of government accumulating debt. = Government Approaches = Governments have differing approaches to privatisation policies, such as pragmatic, tactical and systemic privatisation. Pragmatic privatisation is highly technical and engages in solving problems. This approach is privatisation is conditional upon the fact that public interests are preserved, therefore it is bereft of ideology. Former Treasurer Wayne Swan believes that Labor's economic reforms were pragmatic and rational, in contrast to Thatcherism. He coined the term, \\"Australian Laborism\\" to describe liberal economic policies that also assist working families and are pro-union. Tactical privatisation seeks to gain short-term political benefits for parties or political actors. By serving political goals, this approach to privatization is appealing to supporters, especially during specific political or global events. Some economists categorize Labor's privatisation scheme in the 1990s as tactical, because it aimed to achieve macroeconomic aims to ensure the competitiveness of Australia's economy, against the backdrop of an increasingly globalised economy. The systemic approach to privatisation is derived from ideological predispositions that seek to restructure society by minimizing government influence. The ultimate objective of this approach is to ‚Äúencourage greater reliance on the market than the state‚Äù. This approach was undertaken during Howard's leadership, as privatisation was underpinned by ideology, to ensure smaller government interference in the economy and to embolden private market actors over the public sector. Howard's systemic approach to privatisation is encapsulated in the following quote: \\"[T]he coalition...has...embraced a full- blooded policy of privatisation.\\" This relates to Thatcher's concept of privatisation, which incorporates an ideological aspect of shrinking government interference in society, according to the classical liberal theory.  Cases  = Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1991‚Äì1996) = The Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), often referred to as the People's Bank, was privatised in three stages, commencing from 1991 to 1996, by Treasurer Paul Keating, representing one of the earliest privatisation projects in Australia. It was initiated due to the burden of government investment to ensure the viability of the Bank, which was \\"a net cost to the taxpayer\\". The profits accumulated the from the sale of Commonwealth Bank equated over $7 billion by 1996. In recent years, the CBA has become one of the most profitable banks in Australia, with strong financial performance and a 10% growth in dividends annually. This policy was considered sensible by economists at the time, due to the competitive environment which CBA was operating in, rendering it inefficient. = Qantas (1992) = The partial sale of Qantas, is an example of privatisation of one of Australia's iconic brands, which was initiated in 1992. The government legislated to ensure Qantas was prohibited more than 50 per cent foreign ownership. A quarter of the shares were sold to British Airways, while the remaining were available to the public, which floated in 1995. The executive board of Qantas view this as a success, citing increasing staff numbers, flights and revenue growth since privatisation. However, critics claim that privatisation of Qantas has failed, due to its weak financial position, with a loss of over $2 billion in 2014. = Telstra (1997) = The telecommunications industry underwent the process of deregulation in Australia in 1997 by the Howard Government. When Telecom and Telecommunications Corporation amalgamated in 1992, Telstra was formed. Approximately, 33 percent of Telstra shares were sold, indicating a partial privatisation. Consequently, Telstra gained a monopoly over pay TV infrastructure and did not improve its network unless it received government funding. Telstra's monopoly over telecommunications infrastructure in Australia was a direct result of privatisation, limiting market competition and efficiency, which contradict the objectives of privatisation. = Sale of NSW Electricity (2015) = A more recent example of privatisation was the sale of NSW electricity by the state Government in 2015, which accumulated over $16 billion in revenue. Half of NSW electricity was sold, while the remaining was leased for 99 years. Despite its unpopularity with the electorate, as 67% of NSW voters opposed it, the Baird Government was elected on a mandate to proceed with the sale. Economists have signaled caution about privatizing electricity networks, due to the risk of creating a monopoly, which runs contrary to the policy aims of privatisation. While concerns have been raised about rising electricity prices and the loss of jobs in the electricity sector, the state government promised cheaper prices and the need to use the revenue generated from privatisation, for infrastructure projects across the state.  Impact  Privatisation has remains somewhat unpopular with the Australian electorate, which explains why the debate can be marred by ideologically-driven charges. Australia's experience of privatisation differs from the United States and United Kingdom, as early economic objectives were pursued in conjunction with social objectives. The Australian government has benefited from $100 billion from privatisation since the 1990s, with mixed results of successes and failures. The Australian approach to privatisation is nuanced, yielding some economic benefits, such as the sale of Telstra which accounts for $1 billion in government revenue, enabling the government to use those funds to combat climate issues and also repay deficits. Despite this positive effect of privatisation, Telstra's monopoly over telecommunications infrastructure in Australia as a consequence of privatisation, limited market competition, which reduced investment in the sector. Lack of investment stalled innovation which lead to reduced quality in services, even though customers were being overcharged. Once alternative telecommunication infrastructures entered the market, Telstra's monopoly diminished, which lowered prices for customers. This highlights the complexity of privatisation, which has varying levels of benefits and costs to society. The privatisation of Commonwealth Bank of Australia was soundly justified at time as it operated in the private market, with competition from private banks who offered cheaper products to consumers. Australian economist, John Quiggin, reveals that despite the sensible rationale in privatising the Commonwealth Bank, it represents a net loss to the taxpayer. Profits in the company have grown which explains the CBA Chief Executive Officer's highest salary package of $16.2 million in 2010. Financial deregulation has improved some aspects of CBA's operations as it is projected to become Australia's leading digital bank, while raising fees, reducing services, and in recent years, unethical conduct in the sector, were revealed by the Banking Royal Commission. A report from the People‚Äôs Inquiry in 2017, reveals the overall experience of Australian privatisation has been largely negative, citing job losses, reduced services and rising prices in various sectors across aged care, prison systems, railway and social service. = Positive = \\\\- Economic efficiency: performance figures measured by financial returns. However, efficiency also measures the objectives of the firm, relative to its performance, which may not provide an accurate report. \\\\- Competition: Removing government influence relates to less regulation, which is claimed to improve competition. \\\\- Reduced political interference: The removal of government influence ensures that assets or services are run privately by firms that seek efficiency, with little political interference which produces more productive and efficient outcomes. = Negative = \\\\- Rising inequality: Withdrawal of government influence enlarges the gap of inequality, due to the need to serve public interests. \\\\- Job losses: contractors and outsourced functions of the service renders existing full-time employees redundant. \\\\- Increased prices: The cost for services that have been privatised or assets managed by private corporations can raise costs. Since privatisation of Australia's electricity, prices have risen by 183 per cent.

The proportion of the Australian population aged 65 and over was 15% in 2017, a trend which is expected to continue to grow. It is estimated that by 2057 older people will account for 22% of the Australian population which translates to 8.8 million people. This increase in elderly population is due to what is known as The Australian Baby Boom (years 1946 to 1965). This period refers to the post-war era in which total fertility rates (TFR) were approximately 3.0, resulting in 4.19 million births recorded. This number exceeded the number of births in Australia from the previous 20 years in which there were 1.63 million births, and the proceeding 20 years in when 2.56 million births were recorded. The baby boom children will be celebrating their 65th birthday between 2011 and 2030. the age which is referred to as elderly Owing to this aging Australian demographic trend, Australia's economy, social engagement and workforce are all affected; respectively. TOC  Aging dynamics  The median age of Australian in 1996 compared to 2016. = Median age = The median age of Australians has also accordingly increased with the aging population trend. The median age of the Australian population 20 years ago was 34, today this has increased to 37; demonstrating a 4-year rise. Of all the Australian states and territories, Tasmania has had the largest upsurge in median age increasing to 42 years in 2016, a seven-year increase since 1996. = Australians aged 65 and over = While the percentage of Australians between the ages of 15 and 64 years has seen minimal change only decreasing by 0.7% between years 1996 and 2016, the percentage of citizens aged 65 years and above has had an increase of 3.3%. In 1927, 319 000 Australians were over the age of 65, then in 1977 this increased to 1.3 million. In 2018, approximately 1 in 7 Australians were aged 65 years or over with this number predicted to continue to increase and reach 8.8 million by 2057 = Australians aged 85 and over = From the beginning of the 21st century until July 2016, the Australian population aged 85 years and above has increased by 141.2%. From 2016 to 2017, the Australian population aged over 85 increased from 494,300 to 484,600; that is a 9,700 increase within a one-year period.  Causes  There are two main causes for the growing aging population; this includes declining mortality rates and the subsequent high life expectancy of Australians and the decreasing fertility rates. = High life expectancy = In 1972 mortality rates of the elderly began to drop. From 1907 to 2016, the death rate of males and females has decreased by 71% and 76% respectively, and between 2014 and 2016 Australia's males aged 65 were predicted to live till they were 84.6 years old and women of the age 65 between these same years were expected to live to the age of 87.3 years. This high life expectancy is as result of Australia's low mortality rates, as well as improvements in health care and advances in medical technologies have all contributed to Australia's increasing aging population. Decreasing mortality rates and the subsequently increasing life expectancy of Australians has seen an upward trend since the beginning of the 20th century. Between 2001 and the 1970s, for Australians aged 65 to 69 mortality rates have dropped by 47%. This is due to advances in living environments, including \\"better water supplies, sewerage systems, food quality and health education\\". Health services such as hospitals have also improved in the ability to quarantine infection and the general public's knowledge regarding how to protect themselves from diseases has also grown. Furthermore, developments in medical tools and skills, for example: the concept of immunisation and antibiotics have become a widespread phenomenon across Australia necessitating a surging life expectancy. The general public's knowledge regarding their lifestyle, such as what constitutes a healthy diet. In fact, education regarding the negative health implications of smoking has instigated a behavioural shift regarding the proportion of Australians smoking. Australia has seen the percentage of women smoking decrease by 9% and men by 19% from 1977 to 2008. It was projected in 2003 that smoking was liable for claiming approximately 7.8% of what would have been ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô years in an Australian's life due to its onset of debilitating or fatal illnesses. This increased awareness has contributed to the decline in Australians falling prematurely fatally sick (such as heart disease or lung cancer) as a result of preventable poor lifestyle choices due to lack of education in this arena, not immunising one's self against illnesses, consuming unnecessary amounts of alcohol and unhealthy foods, lacking an essential amount of consumption of fruits and vegetables and adequate amount of exercise. The increased education and the subsequent implementation of few or many of these ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô lifestyle essentials have precipitated the increased expected age of life in Australia as disease and mortality rates decrease = Low fertility rate = There have been three phases of the declining fertility rate trend in Australia between the 1960s and the beginning of the 21st century. The first stage occurred between 1961 and 1975 in which the fertility rate dropped from 3.55 to 2.15 children per woman; a 1.4 percent decrease. The second stage of the fertility decline was during the 1980s, in which there was a 0.08 drop from 1.92 to 1.84 percent. The final of these three phases began at the beginning of the 1990s in which the fertility rate in Australia continued to decline, reaching 1.73 children per woman in 2001. Since then the fertility rate has increased by 0.01% to 1.74 births per woman in 2017. After the fertility rate reached 1.84 children per woman at the end of the second phase, Australia's total fertility rate has been below replacement level. This is due to the transforming Australian society, in which there has been a cultural shift in attitudes towards women in the workforce. Rather, an increased number of women are now favouring a career over having a family, in turn, increasing the commonality of staying single or marrying in later life; all factors which have led to the decline in fertility rates in Australia.  Effects  = Economic = The economy of Australia refers to its population, participation and productivity. The aging demographic has an effect on this due as the rate at which citizen works, is impacted by their age. When people reach the age of 55 in Australia, their working participation begins to reduce and as such the Australian elderly population have low working rates compared to those aged under 55. 2011 saw the beginning of the retirement of the baby boomers as the generation celebrated their 65th birthdays. Since then, the proportion of the population in retirement has grown and while the proportion of those in their major working years has begun to drop. This shift has impacted the Australian budget. While, there is a reduction in revenue due to the declining working population, there is also a larger demand for elderly support such as nursing homes and care takers. Due to this increase in spending and decrease in cash flow revenue the elderly population is predicted to deduct 0.4 percentage points from the annual real growth in revenue and add 0.3 percentage points to the annual real growth in spending. Ultimately, this will lessen tax income and add to Australia's spending demands. This translates to $36 billion of added cost to the yearly Australian budget by 2029. Due to the baby boomer generation entering the latter part of the life (the 70s and 80s), need for health services has increased and is predicted to continue to increase as the aging demographic continues to grow. While it is predicted that the increasing aging demographic of Australia will result in a 20 billion detraction from revenue in 2029, it is also said to increase Australia's revenue by approximately 187 billion due to income increase and population increase, and consequently the remaining revenue increase in Australia is predicted to be around $166 billion by 2029. = Changing health profiles = As a person increases in age it is of higher chance that they have a health condition. With the increasing aging Australian population subsequently, it is expected that there will be an increase in chronic diseases such as dementia, arthritis and cancer; these being the most common in elderly people, affecting 49% of the Australian elderly. As the number of citizens with such diseases increase, it is becoming a rising challenge for the Australian health care system to cater and manage this appropriately. Dementia is particularly prevalent in the elderly population. In 2014, there were 332,000 Australians who suffered from dementia and of this, 93% were of an elderly age (65 or above). This is number is projected to increase to approximately 900,000 by 2050. With this rise in chronic diseases as a result of the growing elderly population, health care services are in high demand. In 2012, 98% of Australia's elderly population visited a health expert and 57% of those aged 65 and above visited a specialist, which is 29% greater than those aged below 65. Furthermore, there has also been a rise in the proportion of the population required aged care residential services. In fact, between 2003 and 2013, the number of the elderly population living in aged care residences increased by 20%. Due to this increased demand for support and health services, challenges are presented towards this industry. While the Australian health sector is sizable, with the increasing elderly population it is predicted that there will be shortages in workers who possess the appropriate skills to cater for the elderly's health care needs.  Comparisons with other countries  This aging trend is also reflected in many other populations around the world. According to the United Nations, all countries in the world are experiencing an increase in their elderly population. It is projected that by 2050 the world's elderly population will at least double, and by 2100 it will triple increasing from 962 million in 2017 to 2.1 billion in 2050 and 3.1 billion in 2100. This is particularly evident in industrialised countries and continents such as Japan and Hong Kong and a large portion of Europe including Switzerland, Greece and Italy. In particular Europe in 2017 had the largest percentage of elderly people, with 25% of their population being above the age of 60. By 2050 all continents, excluding Africa will have at least a quarter of their subsequently populations of an elderly age. This is due to similar reasons to the causes of Australia's increasing elderly population just as increased life expectancy and continual low fertility rates. In fact, in the countries of ‚ÄúJapan, Italy, France, Greece, Sweden, Canada, United Kingdom and Hong Kong‚Äù the number of elderly people surpasses the number of people aged from 0‚Äì14. In Australia this predicted to occur in approximately 2034. Compared to the United Kingdom and the United States of America, Australia's median age in 2015 was slightly less than these two countries. For instance, the United States of America had a median population age of 37.6 and the United Kingdoms was 40.2, and Australia's was slightly less at 37.2. Furthermore, in the same year the percentage of elderly people in these particular countries were similar. The proportion of the Australian population that was 65 or above was 15%, the United States of America was 18% and the United Kingdom was also 15%. Additionally, these countries all have alike future growth projections regarding their elderly population with, by 2020, the proportion of elderly people in Australia projected to grow by 1.2%, the United States of America estimated to increase by 2% and the United Kingdom expected to rise by approximately 0.9%.

It is in the form of a film that the main characters are puppets. Puppets‚Äô limbs are controlled by people and their mouths usually does not move frequently. The height of a puppet is approximately 20 centimeters and the background is a model which fits the size of the puppet. The film is shot by grid-by-frame photography. Puppet film starts around 1900s. Between 1930s and 1980s, most genres of puppet films are comedy and animation. There are some famous magnum opus such as Thunderbird series and The Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland. After 1980s, many horror puppet films appeared such as Puppet Master: The Littlest Reich. Compared to other films, puppet film focuses more on characters‚Äô movements and the main audiences are children and teenagers. More and more reality elements are added into puppet film in recent years.  History  The first puppet film \\" Dolly's Toys \\" is shown in 1902. It is also the first puppet animation in history. It is inspired by puppetry and uses puppets as main characters in the films. In Europe, Great Britain creates the earliest series of puppet films in 1900s. After 1920s, many great puppet films appears among different European countries, such as Germany's \\"Eva and Grasshopper\\"(1928), Poland's \\"For Pete's Sake\\"(1966) and France's \\"Frags Who Wanted a King\\"(1923). The main genre is comedy. In the USA, puppet film starts from 1910s. Similar to Europe, puppets in the films are controlled by strings which are usually hidden under the ground. Puppet film is popular in Hollywood from the beginning. Many special effects are added into the films. In 1979, director James Frawley create the first live-action film in the USA and the film is the start of the famous \\"Muppet Series\\". In Asia, puppetry is more popular than puppet films. In the middle of 20th centuries, some Asian countries starts putting puppets into their animation films. In 1953, China creates its first puppet animation film Emperor's Dream. It is one of the earliest puppet films in Asia according to the current research.  Film production process  = The construction of puppets = Similar to Puppetry, all kinds of the puppets in the early 20th centuries are controlled by hands working. However, Not every puppet can be used in a film. While puppets in the puppetry perform in front of the stage, puppets in puppet films are recorded frame-by- frame by a camera. The puppets' height are usually around 30 centimetres. Their heads are made of wood, plastics or moulded rubber. To turn a puppet into a live character in the film, facial expression is crucial. Puppets‚Äò facial features are usually moveable so that they can behave like talking or sleeping A few puppets use plain face with repainted features to show the changes of characters' feelings. Moreover, Some studios will prepare different heads for puppets and changes them during the production process. Puppets also have three types of bodies. They are distinguished by the materials which have been mentioned above. After the invention of CGI, some puppets uses CGI and create more fantastic effect. The alien in the film E.T is a good example. = Settings and techniques = The scale of the scene is followed by the size of the puppets. To make such a scene, many small items are used in the beginning of puppet film, such as stones, sticks and boxes. A close-up shot is always used to make audiences focus more on characters' movements instead of the rough background. In the meantime, effects like earthquake are required in the puppet film. The setting needs more solid material. But considering the reflection of light on the object will cause unnecessary shine, the studios usually use flat enamel and lacquer. Halogen ceiling light As the scene of puppet film is smaller than the real world, errors are easily expanded. So when setting the lighting, special equipment will be used. Halogen lamps are common devices in puppet films. The Halogen lighting unit is \\"small, lightweight and high mobile\\". Also, spotlights are set in the smallest position so that the extra light will be avoided. Compare to cartoon or animation, it is much more difficult to add dialogues into puppet films. The timing must be critical as the sound is recorded before the movements. It is hard to catch the puppets' mouth movements in every sentence. So the studios prefer to eliminate the conversation in. the early puppet films and add more music and sound effects. The audiences need to derive the meaning by themselves. But with the development of technology, more and more dialogues are added after 1950s.  Representative works  Famous horror puppet film series From 1900s to the early 1970s, most of the puppet films are animation or comedy. After 1970s, the Puppet Master Series changes the mainstream into horror style. Many horror puppet films are created between 1980s and 2000s.

Dolly's Toys (1902) is considered as the first puppet film in history. It is made by British film Pioneer Arthur Melbourne-Cooper. It is about a boy's fantasy that all his toys come to life. Arthur Melbourne-Cooper is the creator of the world's first animation films. On the basis of Dolly's Toys, Arthur made another film which is Dreams of Toyland. Two films have similar plots . The story is always around children and their toys. The Great Gabbo (1929) changes the plot. In this film, a ventriloquist who calls himself the Great Gabbo begins to lose his sense of identity when his only means of expression is through his wooden dummy. As the Great Gabbo begins to rely more and more on his dummy, he begins to go mad. The story is adapted from \\"Rival Dummy\\" by Ben Hecht. It brings the puppets to adult's world. The Czech Year (1947) is directed by Jir√≠ Trnka. Jir√≠ Trnkais an animation director and he used to build an early puppet theatre. The Czech Year is his first feature film. In The Czech Year, It has six stories: \\"Shrovetide\\", \\"Spring\\", \\"Legend About St. Prokop\\", \\"The Fair\\", \\"The Feast\\" and \\"Bethlehem\\". Though the puppet design is simply due to the technology, the story is interesting and is full of life. The director begins to use puppet films to reflect the culture of their countries. In 1949, Czech director Milos Makovec and Jir√≠ Trnka directed The Emperor's Nightingale. The story is about a Chinese emperor. He prefers the tinkling of a bejewelled mechanical bird to the song of a real nightingale. When the Emperor is near death, a nightingale's song restores his health. In this film, eastern countries' culture is presented through a fairytale. The play shows traditional Chinese lion dance, puppetry, and a pair of tigers and pandas. In the meantime, It has \\"strong ethical components\\". Tiny Hero(1953) is the first Chinese colour puppet film. It tells the story that brave children fight against a bad wolf and save other animals in the forest. It is produced by Shanghai Film Studio. Since then, China has created over 136 puppet films. In the same year, US director Charles Walters made his first puppet film Lili. It is a love story in a carnival. LILI is an orphan. A crippled puppeteer Mel Ferrer treats Lili with contempt. However, he loves LILI. He only expresses his love through talking to his puppets. Lili is a sign of the early drama puppet film. Thunderbirds Are GO (1966) is the start of the Thunderbird series. It is a science fiction story. The background of the film is in mid-2060s. The setting is in a secret base in the Pacific Ocean. Thunderbirds is a top life-saving organisation and the story. Anywhere in the world which has a serious disaster or accident can be immediately rushed to eliminate by Thunderbirds. It is directed by Gerry Anderson. Devil Doll (1964) is a British horror puppet film. The main character Vorelli is a ventriloquist and a hypnotist. He owns a magic puppet which can behave like a real man. To get his purpose, he asks the puppet to kill people. A series of mysterious murders begins.The director Lindsay Shonteff is known as making crime thriller films. He puts many thriller elements into the puppet film. It is one of the earliest thriller puppet films. The Ruka (1965) is also directed by Jir√≠ Trnka. In The Ruka, a huge hand approaches a small happy potter and wants him to sculpt its statue. After the potter refusing his request, he uses different ways to threat him.It is a tragedy in the end. It is the final work of Jir√≠ Trnka and it wins the highest animation award in his country. However, it is too dark and ironic to politics. It almost banned by the Communist Czechoslovakian government at that time. Mad Monster Party? (1967) is directed by Jules Bass. It is a fantasy story. Dr Frankenstein is retiring from the monster-making business and prepares an election. In the meantime, he discovers an important secret. The background of the film is Halloween and the film is full of interesting monster elements. Puppet On A Chain (1971) is directed by Geoffrey Reeve. In the film, a U.S agent arrives in Amsterdam to investigate a heroin smuggling ring. The city is out of control and the police is unwilling to deal with it. He has to fight alone with those bad guys. It is an action and thriller puppet film. The Muppet Movie (1979) is the first film of the Muppet series. The story starts from Frog Kermit who is approached by a Hollywood agent to audition for the chance of a lifetime. In his way to Hollywood, he meets several strange but interesting friends. They get together and a lot of funny things happens. It is directed by James Frawley. In 2004, Disney company purchased the copyright of Muppet Movie and made a new film which was The Muppet (2011).  Influence  Though puppetry has a 4000 years history, few people are interested in puppetry nowadays since the story of puppetry is repetitive and the stage setting is too simple compared with modern films. Puppet film innovates in preserving the form of puppetry and combines it with films. Puppet film focuses on the storytelling as the core idea and enriches the character figure. Puppet film creates more fantastic stories and brings people deeper thoughts. Puppet film inherits the culture of puppetry and makes it more suitable for the modern trend. Many puppet films are animated puppet films. Different from the normal animation, puppet film create a conversation between human and non-human. It produces many fantastic ideas for animation industries. Furthermore, Puppet film motivates a new element in horror film. From the Puppet Master Series, more and more puppets appear as evil and horrible elements in modern films. Dead Silence is a good example.

Paternal depression affects the mood of men; fathers and caregivers in particular. 'Father' may refer to the biological father, foster parent, social parent, step-parent or simply the carer of the child. This mood disorder exhibits symptoms similar to postpartum depression (PPD) including anxiety, insomnia, irritability, consistent breakdown and crying episodes, and low energy. This may negatively impact family relationships and the upbringing of children. Parents diagnosed with parental depression often experience increased stress and anxiety levels during early pregnancy, labor and postpartum. Those with parental depression may have developed it early on but some are diagnosed later on from when the child is a toddler up until a young adult. The causes of paternal depression are unclear; however, previous experiences of mental disorders and family history can contribute to the development of paternal depression. Other factors including stress overload, sleep deprivation and unhappy relationships with one's partner or children may also affect its prevalence. Although symptoms of feeling down, baby blues and a lack of sleep are common amongst new parents, a diagnosis of depression is appropriate when symptoms are severe and ongoing. Most health literature provides studies and research on maternal depression and women with postnatal depression. However, there is limited information about men and mental illness. Modern society and culture have changed social stigma of men with mental illness due to changes in gender role perspectives.  Signs and symptoms compared to women  When comparing the anxiety level of first-time parents, women tend to have higher levels of anxiety. This is applicable to women immediately after birth and in the first three trimesters. Compared to women, men experience greater anxiety levels within the first 3 months of childbirth and develop paternal depression as the children grows older. Although depression can affect individuals in different ways, there are some gender differences between parents. Women tend to have similar depressive symptoms over all three trimesters, however in men, there are significant changes between the 1st and 2nd trimester, but not between the 2nd trimester to 3 months postpartum. Women are also more likely to experience symptoms such as developing an eating disorder, irritability, crying episodes, extreme sadness, bipolar disorder and low energy levels. Men are more likely to experience substance abuse, a higher frequency of irritability, anger attacks and becoming abusive and violent. Men may also partake in risk-taking behaviour such as drink driving. Despite common symptoms of loss of appetite and insomnia, women are more likely to display atypical behaviours such as oversleeping and overeating. Successful suicide levels are also more often associated with fathers rather than with mothers. Prevalence of depressive symptoms in men and women from pregnancy to 3-months postpartum  Causes  In general, the causes of maternal and paternal depression are similar. Common causes include having limited emotional and social support, experiencing financial stress, having an unsatisfying relationship with one's partner, finding difficulty adjusting to parenting, unexpected events in child development and personal histories of mental disorders and drug abuse. According to a study conducted in 2005, 65% of males identified with depressive symptoms when the child was 8 weeks old. The causes of paternal depression include stress overload, caring responsively to the children, undertaking multiple family and social roles and a decrease in direct father to child interaction. Fathers of young boys are most vulnerable to paternal depression during the child's early and behavioural development. This is caused by young boys having the tendency to be hyperactive and harder to discipline. This causes the father to be concerned and frustrated. There is a positive correlation between a boy's misbehaviour and depression in fathers.  Prevalence  = Men in the U.S. = Studies show that 14.1% of men suffer from postpartum depression. Outside of the U.S. 8.2% of men experience depressive symptoms. The observation of postpartum depression could be categorised into the time blocks of paternal depression: first trimester to 6 months gestational age, >6 months to birth, immediate postpartum to 3 months postpartum, >3 to 6 months postpartum and >6 to 12 months postpartum. During the period of 3 to 6 months postpartum, the highest rate of 25.6% was recorded in men whilst the lowest occurred during the first three months of postpartum at 7.7%. The high levels of depression during the 3 to 6 months postpartum period is also similar amongst women. These results could be explained by the strenuousness of 3 to 6 months newborn care.  Treatment  Treatment for paternal depression depends on the severity of it. Light to moderate symptoms could be treated at home. This includes being well-rested, getting alone time, eating a well-balanced diet with adequate amounts of water and exercise, accepting social support from partner, friends and family. Joining local community groups and creating bonds with other fathers experiencing similar symptoms will decrease stress and create a sense of relief. However, treatment of mild to severe depression would require further action. Outlines some of the common treatment available for PPD, excluding psychotherapy and antidepressants. Treatments offered for parents with depression are similar to other mental disorders. This includes taking antidepressants or receiving psychotherapy. Those experiencing moderate paternal depression should seek therapy from a mental health professional. This may be a psychiatrist, counselor or psychologist. However, if experiencing intense depression, medical intervention may be necessary. Consult your health professional about medication including mood stabilizers. Other methods to recovery include electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This releases short electrical currents to the brain, allowing it to relax. It is recommended when all other procedures are ineffective. There are other alternatives to treatment. This includes self-care in the form of relaxation, massage, herbal medicine and chiropractic services. = Psychotherapy = Psychotherapy aids PPD treatment by approaching it with psychological, rather than biological, intervention. Many parents with PPD prefer psychological treatment as it limits any potential side affects that will influence the child. Common therapy styles include interpersonal therapy, cognitive-behavioural therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy and non-directive counseling. Therapy could be conducted individually or couple therapy is also an option. This is practical in addressing support at home along with your relationship with your partner. In general, therapy may take anywhere between a few weeks to months to be effective. However, severe symptoms will require intense psychotherapy which may take up to years. = Antidepressants = Pharmacological treatment such as antidepressant medication is a growing method of treatment with a recent increase in literature surrounding the topic. This is given to those that experience severe PPD as it balances the chemicals in the brain that affect mood. Mothers tend to avoid antidepressants with many fearing its impact on breast milk. However, it is an effective way in treating depression amongst fathers. There are several factors that the father may want to consider; this includes metabolic changes, mood changes, memory loss, drowsiness and possible side effects influencing child care. Medication needs to be under the supervision of a medical professional and is proven to be even more effective when accompanied with psychotherapy. = Self-care = There are a number of ways to treat PPD at home. These methods are recommended for those with moderate PPD. However, severe PPD will require intensive intervention. The following practices will promote a healthier and positive lifestyle and are beneficial to anyone: talking to loved ones, taking alone time, getting sufficient amounts of rest, exercising regularly and eating a balanced diet. Not skipping meals, prioritising sleep and getting outside will improve mental health and increase feelings of satisfaction and fulfilment.  Society and culture  The increase of paternal depression could be explained by women's increasing input into social roles. Women contributing to the workforce leads to more fathers becoming involved with family life. This increases the possibility of developing paternal depression. Paternal depression is a frequently neglected topic. It challenges social normalities of gender roles, the stereotypes of fatherhood, masculinity and social stigma on men with mental health. The progressive perception of fathers being the primary parent leads to further increase in father involvement. National policies have not progressed with the changes in gender roles. This includes the difficulties in receiving of paternal leave and receiving custody. This is influenced by the limited studies on fathers and depression. However, the recent increase of research into paternal depression shows society's views on increasing gender equality in social roles and the changing culture on masculine and feminine concepts. = Stigma of men with mental illness = How the stigma of men with mental illness influence the prevalence of seeking treatment There is often stigma around mental illness, especially for men. Severe stigma usually takes forms of discrimination, prejudice and stereotypes. These categorise how society view mental disorders. Paired with gender roles and the concepts of masculinity and femininity, society views men with mental impairments as weak and vulnerable and not the stereotypical alpha male. This then affects how men view their own mental disability, influencing the seeking of treatment and acceptance of the illness. This cause and effect relationship can create a cycle, leading men to be disheartened and ashamed of reaching out. According to the Australian Black Dog Institute, it is estimated that 72% of men do not seek treatment for mental disorders.

Virtually all deceased are now cremated in Japan ‚Äì as of 2012, it had the highest cremation rate in the world of over 99.9%. The Meiji government attempted to ban the practice in the 19th century, but the ban was only in effect for less than two years.  Religion  Cremation in Japan was originally practiced by monks inspired by the Buddha, who gave detailed instructions regarding his own cremation. It was therefore seen as a way of accruing spiritual merit and getting closer to Buddhahood. Cremation also exemplifies the Buddhist teaching of impermanence. Referred to as kas≈ç, which translates to 'fire burial', it is only one of several options mentioned in Buddhist literature, the others being earth burial (dos≈ç), water burial (suis≈ç), open-air burial (fus≈ç, or 'wind burial') and forest burial (rins≈ç). Water, wind and forest burial accrue the most merit, followed by cremation and then earth burial, which accrues the least merit as it does not offer the body for the benefit of wild plants and animals. Buddhist relics have been found in the ashes of spiritually meritorious individuals. Most Japanese Christians cremate their dead as well. The issue of limited burial space in Japan is felt particularly by Japanese Muslims, who do not cremate their dead.  History  Illustration of an open-air cremation. There is evidence of cremation from the prehistoric J≈çmon period. The first notable cremation in Japanese history was that of the Buddhist monk D≈çsh≈ç in 700 AD. The cremation of Empress Jito in 703 AD began an aristocratic tradition which remained generally unbroken until the full-body burial of Emperor Gokomyo in 1654. Even then, his burial was preceded by a symbolic burning. Such false cremations followed by discreet full-body burials became less common with Emperor Komei‚Äôs full-body burial in 1867. Towards the end of the Heian period (794-1185), cremation in Japan became a distinctly Buddhist practice, and Buddhist temples came to own or maintain most crematoria. The cost of firewood largely limited cremation to the nobility until the Kamakura period (1185-1333), when it spread to the common people. During the Edo/Tokugawa period (1603-1868), in modern-day Akita prefecture, each household in a certain village would contribute two bundles of straw towards the cremation of a recently deceased member of the community. Cremation was especially common among J≈çdo Shinsh≈´ or Shin Buddhists, whose founder Shinran encouraged cremation. Popularity amongst other schools of Buddhism varied. The compactness of the ashes resulting from cremation contributed to the rise of ancestral or family graves. Crematory workers were generally poor people called 'onboyaki', a term with negative connotations = Anti-cremation movement = The notion of cremation as the greatest sin against filial piety originated in China, where it was used as a punishment, during the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Japanese Confucians constituted the majority of vocal opponents, claiming that the dead should be treated as if they were still living. This justified ignoring a parent‚Äôs misguided wish to be cremated and giving them a full-body burial instead. The Meiji government (1868-1912) sought to replace Buddhist influences on national culture with Shintoist influences. For instance, they used Shinto and Confucian texts to design a new kind of Shinto funeral in an effort to replace Buddhist funerals. Meiji officials continually stressed that cremation was a foreign, Indian practice, brought to Japan via Buddhism. In 1873, Tokyo police relocated crematoria beyond city limits, citing the smell as detrimental to public health. Shinto leaders argued that to approve the relocation of crematoria was to implicitly condone cremation, leading the Meiji government to completely ban the practice on 18 July 1873. = Pro-cremation movement = During the ban, mourners carried out false cremations by burning firewood atop graves. Advocates argued that cremation was not unfilial as the compactness of the resulting ashes made it easier for people to fulfil the filial task of interring family members together in ancestral graves. The Meiji government was less lenient than the contemporary Qing government in China, which made an exception for those who had died far from home. Advocates argued that burning bodies were better than rotting ones, citing European studies on the detrimental effect of decomposing bodies on public health, as well as the fact that cremation was being promoted in the West as a hygienic practice. The ban also affected the practice of full-body burials. The local government in Tokyo planned to use temple grounds for extra burial space, to accommodate the increased full-body burials under the ban. However, the Finance Ministry argued that urban graveyards were a waste of potentially profitable, taxable land. The Council of State decided to ban full-body burial within Tokyo city limits, making no exception for those wishing to be buried in ancestral graves, even those on temple or personal property. After less than two years in effect, the ban was repealed in May 1875. = After the repeal = In 1878, English traveller Isabella Bird visited a new Japanese crematory equipped with smokestacks, which minimised the impact of crematory smoke on the public. Her description of the facilities was disseminated by Western cremationists. In 1880, German cremationists requested to view plans of another crematory modernised with ventilation systems and a lime filter. In 1884, the British government also requested to view plans, and completed England‚Äôs first crematory a year later. An 1897 law mandated the cremation of individuals that had died of communicable infections. A public crematorium was built in every Japanese municipality in the 1910s and 1920s. From the 1920s, firewood was gradually replaced with fossil fuels which produced less smoke and odours, allowing cremation to happen during the daytime. Because families no longer had to travel back to the crematory the next day to collect the ashes, the Buddhist service traditionally held on the seventh day after death could be held on the same day as both the funeral and cremation for convenience. After the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923, the majority of those who had been killed in Tokyo were cremated by Buddhist priests at an old military clothing depot, one of twelve areas designated for the cremation of victims. Postcards were spread depicting piles of ashes and bone fragments on the ground beside piles of personal effects removed before cremation. = The present = Cremation is now mandatory in most parts of Japan. After death, 24 hours must pass before cremation can take place, unless the cause of death is communicable infection. The ashes, which contain bone fragments (okotsu), can be pulverised into a fine powder for an additional cost. Local governments own and maintain most crematoria, and thus profit minimally from cremation costs. A particular public crematorium in Yokohama charged ¬•12 000 for residents and ¬•50 000 for visitors in 2016. A shortage in crematoria as Japan's population ages means that families can wait up to 4 days before the deceased can be cremated. Temporary mortuaries, commonly called 'hotels', are now available for families to store the deceased for around ¬•9000 a night. Some temples also offer this service. In the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake of 2011, the bodies of 2,000 victims were temporarily buried due to fuel shortages in the affected area. Many were exhumed before the expected two years had passed, despite their semi-decomposed state, by relatives whose mourning could not be complete without their cremation. Cremation became more common than full-body burial in the 1930s, and more common in all areas of Japan in the 1970s. As of 2010, Japan had a cremation rate of 99.94%. It is less common is rural areas and in the Okinawan archipelago where the bones of the decomposed body are exhumed, washed, and reburied (senkotsu). Since the 1990s, there has been the option to pulverise all remains to a fine powder and incorporate them into temoto kuyohin, or 'close-at-hand funerary items' such as memorial diamonds, crystals and ceramics. As of 2016, one third of cremations in Tokyo took place without a funeral. This cheaper and simpler option is called chokuso, or 'direct cremation'. In 2012, Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko stated that they wish to be cremated due to concerns over limited space in the imperial graveyard.  Process of cremation  The family may give a monetary gift to the cremator in charge before cremation begins. A Buddhist priest chants a Buddhist scripture, called a sutra, as cremation begins. The chief mourner presses the button to ignite the furnace, or two chief mourners press it together. This action mimics the ignition of the 'death flower', a paper flower traditionally placed atop graves. Igniting the flower or furnace marks the chief mourner's relationship to the deceased as their primary heir and caretaker. Attendees wait in the crematorium as the body is cremated for about 60 to 90 minutes. Lower temperatures of 500 to 600 ¬∞C are used than in Western cremation, to retain some bone as fragments. The remains are then placed on a metal tray and moved to the ash collecting room (sh≈´-kotsu-shitsu). Some mourners choose to consume some of the ashes, as they are or mixed with water. Transferring the ashes into a cinerary urn is traditionally done in male/female pairs as a precaution against the contaminating nature of death, and against accidentally dropping the bones. Mourners approach in order of their relationship to the deceased, and pass bone fragments from one pair of chopsticks to the other. Using chopsticks in this way outside of a bone- picking ceremony (kotsuage) is typically taboo. The chopsticks are longer than those used for eating, and one is wooden and the other bamboo. Sometimes only the left hand is used, or the left hand is used initially before switching to the right hand. Children are not exempt from participation in kotsuage. The bone fragments are transferred in order of those of the feet to those of the skull, so that the deceased will be upright within the urn. It is often necessary for the cremator to break the skull so that it will fit into the urn. The second cervical vertebra is placed in the urn last by the closest relative. Called 'nodobotoke', or 'throat Buddha', it resembles a meditating Buddha. In Eastern Japan, all of the remains are transferred into the urn, whereas in Western Japan, only some of the remains are collected. Mourners often only transfer some of the remains, while crematorium staff finish the task. The urn is then sealed, and placed in a box which is covered with cloth. As for full-body burials, permits for cremation are issued by a city office. During the Heian period, the cremation site was marked by a 6 foot tall fence, made of cypress bark or bamboo. Its rough construction deliberately distinguished it as a structure meant for the dead. It was also built without digging supports into the ground, to avoid angering the earth deities. At Emperor Go-Ichigo's cremation in 1036, and that of other royals and aristocrats around this time, a second fenced area was built within the first, increasing the religious and imperial sanctity of the inner space. A second fence also further protected the living and the dead from each other. Emperor Go-Ichigo's cremation pit contained straw mats, cloth, silk, and kindling. The various layers protected the dead from any angered earth deities. A ladel, a broom, and a bucket of water were placed at each corner. = Pet cremation = A Buddhist priest may chant sutras for a pet if it is cremated at a cemetery owned by a temple. Some opt for mass cremation, where the ashes are not collected by the owners but interred by the cemetery. = Object cremation = Some Buddhists believe that non-sentient objects also have the Buddha-nature, or the potential to attain Buddhahood. Some Japanese people thus express their gratitude towards certain significant material possessions by ceremonially cremating them. Commonly cremated objects include traditional Japanese tools such as needles, writing brushes, tea whisks, and paper umbrellas. Shoes, hairdressing scissors, hats, semiconductors, clocks, watches, and dolls have been cremated as well. One notable ceremony is the annual cremation of wooden chopsticks at Buddhist temples or Shinto shrines for Chopsticks Commemoration Day on the 4th of August.

History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Italian Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Cannone da 381/40 AVS started life as four Cannone da 381/40 naval guns which were intended to arm Dreadnought battleships of the Francesco Caracciolo-class of the Regia Marina but were made surplus when that class of ship was canceled. Three different guns were ordered for evaluation from Schneider-Ansaldo, Armstrong-Pozzuoli, and Vickers-Terni for the Francesco Caracciolo project. Although the construction of the guns differed they had nearly identical ballistic performance. The guns from Armstrong- Pozzuoli, and Vickers-Terni were wire wound guns while the Schneider-Ansaldo guns were of monobloc construction. The wire wound guns weighed while the monbloc guns only weighed . The Schneider-Ansaldo guns were chosen for conversion to railway guns. The guns used interrupted screw breeches and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. It fired high explosive shells weighing 730 kg (1,609 lb) and 876 kg (1,931 lb) to ranges of 33.6 km (21 mi) and 30 km (19 mi) respectively. It also fired a 884.5 kg (1,950 lb) armor-piercing shell to a range of 30 km (19 mi). The guns were fed from an attached ammunition wagon with an elevated ammunition trough between the carriages. The carriages consisted of a large rectangular steel base, which was suspended on three articulated rail bogies with two four-axle bogies at the front and one six-axle bogie at the rear similar to French Schneider gun carriages of the period. This asymmetric layout was less common and was chosen because the barrel was trunnioned well to the rear and a large counterweight was added to the breech to try and balance the preponderance of the barrel which was towards the front of the carriage. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. Due to this nose heaviness the guns were only capable of +25¬∞ of elevation. The guns used a combination of cradle recoil with four hydraulic buffers above and two pneumatic recuperators below the barrel and sliding recoil for the carriage. The carriage only had a limited amount of traverse +1¬∞ L/R controlled by the rear bogie so it was aimed by drawing the guns across a section of curved track. Once in firing position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wood and iron beams to support the weight of the gun. Six wooden beams under the center of the carriage were then lowered to lay across the tracks and the carriage was jacked up to take the weight off the bogies and anchor the gun in place. When the gun fired the entire carriage recoiled a few feet and was stopped by the friction of the beams on the tracks. The carriage was then lowered onto its axles and was either pushed back into place with a shunting locomotive or a windlass mounted on the front of the carriage pulled the carriage back into position. This cheap, simple and effective system came to characterize Schneider's railway guns during the later war years and is known as the Glissement system. World War One The four Cannone da 381/40 AVS entered service at the beginning of 1917 and were first used during the Battle of Caporetto. The four guns were placed in storage at La Spezia between the wars and were not mobilized during World War II.  Gallery  File:381-40 AVS (2).jpgA line diagram of carriage components.

By the late 1970s the yellow facia on the front entrance had been replaced by a much more austere concrete finish, akin to the incoming Thatcher years. Contemporary films owned two other cinemas under the \\"Phoenix\\" brand, in East Finchley and in Oxford, England and after the closure of the Paris Pullman, it has continued to distribute films to cinemas and TV, and videos and DVDs to the general public, as well as supplying footage to programme-makers. The residential block that replaced the cinema is called \\"Pullman Court\\". =Featured works= The roll- call of film directors whose films were screened at the Paris Pullman included: Michelangelo Antonioni, Ingmar Bergman, Bernardo Bertolucci, Walerian Borowczyk, Robert Bresson, Luis Bu√±uel, Claude Chabrol, Sergei Eisenstein, Milos Forman, Werner Herzog, Philippe Mora, Yasujir≈ç Ozu, Nagisa Oshima, Roman Polanski, Satyajit Ray, Jean Renoir, Andrei Tarkovsky, Andrzej Wajda and Rainer Werner Fassbinder whose Veronika Voss was the last film screened at the Paris Pullman on 8 May 1983.Cinema Treasures References External links * http://londonfilm.bbk.ac.uk/view/venue/?id=84 * At Home Inn Chelsea: Simon's walks Cinemas in London Theatres in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Theatres completed in 1947 Buildings and structures in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Paris Pullman Cinema 1947 establishments in England Theatres completed in 1911 1911 establishments in England Former buildings and structures in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea 1955 disestablishments in England 1983 disestablishments in England Former cinemas in London Former theatres in London ","title":"Paris Pullman Cinema"},{"id":"60611779","text":"Martha Atwell (1900 ‚Äì December 28, 1949) was an American radio director, known for her association with Frank and Anne Hummert.

Bolivian architecture has been constantly changing and progressing over time. Subject to terrain and high altitudes, most of Bolivia's Pre-Columbian buildings were built for housing, mainly influenced by Bolivian indigenous culture. The arrival of Spanish settlers brought many European-style buildings, and the Spaniards began planning to build big cities. After Independence, the architectural style became Neoclassical and many churches and government buildings were built. In modern Bolivia, like many countries, skyscrapers and post-modern buildings dominate, and of course there are special styles of architecture to attract tourists and build. Before the arrival of Spanish settlers, the architecture of the Tiwanaku Empire and the Inca Empire was the main representative of the architectural style of Pre- Columbian Bolivia. They not only reflect the culture of their respective empires, but also the Bolivian indigenous culture. During the Spanish colonial period, when the Spanish colonists built the big cities, they not only brought the Baroque style from Europe, but also the new building materials and religions from Europe. At the same time, Bolivia's original architectural style and Baroque style led to a new style, known as the Andean Baroque style. In modern times, like many countries, modern Bolivian architecture is dominated by modern and postmodernism. In order to meet the needs of tourism and benefit by the unique geographical environment of Bolivia, some other styles of architecture have emerged in Bolivia which better showing the diverse architecture of Bolivia.  History  = Tiwanaku empire (400‚Äì1000) = Akapana's Pyramid, which was the largest structure in the religious complex. Tiwanaku is located near the southern shore of Lake Titicaca at an altitude of 3,850 meters. Most of the ancient city sites were built from adobe, although they are now covered by modern towns, but representative stone buildings survive in protected archaeological areas. It was a prosperous and planned city between 400 AD and 900 AD. The city has impressive stone carvings and complex underground drainage systems that control the flow of rain. At the same time, there are many buildings related to religion and political structure, such as Temple Semi-underground, Akapana's Pyramid, Kalasasaya‚Äòs Temple and Palace of Putuni. One of the most spectacular monuments in Tiwanaku is Akapana's Pyramid. This is a pyramid with an initial stack of seven superimposed platforms with a stone retaining wall of up to 18 meters, but now only the lowest and a small part of it are well preserved. According to the investigations, it was clad in sandstone and surrounded by well-preserved drainage systems. Located in the north is Kalasasaya‚Äòs Temple, which is believed to have been used as an observatory. The most representative of it is the two huge sun gates cut from andesite, which is one of the most important representatives of Tiwanaku art. There are niches at the sides of the door, and a well-designed bas-relief above the door. The Temple Semi-underground also has beautifully carved. The walls are made up of 48 red sandstone columns with many carved stones set into it. It is clear that the former settlers of the city had a superb technique of carving and polishing various stone materials, combined with architectural techniques to make the architecture of the Tiwanaku empire more recognizable and representative. The ruins of ancient city of Tiwanaku has been listed on the World Heritage List by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 2000.

File:Tiwanaku23.jpgThe walls of Semi-subterranean Temple are made up with sandstone columns and carved stone. = Inca empire (1438‚Äì1471) = 238x238px Bolivia became part of the Inca Empire in the 13th century. Because the Inca Empire occupied Bolivia through invasion, many of the buildings of this period began to have military use, many fortresses and defensive walls appeared, and the buildings of this period had better comprehensiveness. The archaeological site of Incallajta covers an area of 67 hectares and is one of the main Inca sites in Bolivia. Incallajta can be considered a building similar to the Pocona fortress, with nearly forty buildings and a defensive wall, and the large space that can be covered is characteristic of Inca architecture. This is the Inca complex in Bolivia, with habitational, defensive, military, religious agricultural and towers for astronomy. The archaeological site of Incallajta was the largest and most important administrative centre in the region. In 2003, it was submitted to the Tentative Lists in the Global Strategy part created by UNESCO. = Spanish colonial period (1538‚Äì1825) = 256x256px With the arrival of Spanish settlers, almost all Bolivian architecture has changed. They bring Baroque style, new building materials and enough wealth. With the massive construction, the architectural landscape of Bolivia has changed. For Aboriginal people, the biggest change in housing is the introduction of adobe to replace the previous mud and clay mixture. Over time, this kind of European traditional style house with a courtyard and red tile roof is becoming more and more popular. However, the more obvious change is that Spanish settlers began to build big cities. These large cities are usually centered around a cathedral and palace which built in the \\"Andean Baroque style.\\" This style is a combination of Baroque style and original architecture style of Bolivia, although in most cases it looks almost identical to the original. In the period when Bolivia was colonized by Spain, this style can be found in most cities in Bolivia, the most representative being the City of Potos√≠. City of Potos√≠ is the largest supplier of silver in Spain during the Spanish colonial period. It is even hailed as the world's largest industrial park in the 16th century, with a major impact on the Spanish economy and the global economy. So in the 17th century, about 160,000 Spanish colonists lived in the city. In other words, the city is a good example of Bolivian architecture in Spanish colonial times. Not only has the various industrial infrastructures required for mining, but also has many buildings related to daily life. There is no doubt that the Spanish colonists established a European-style church associated with religion and its high-end residence. In this city, many buildings have adopted the ‚ÄúAndean Baroque style‚Äù, which blends Indian style. Potosi also has a lasting impact on the architecture of central Bolivia and the Andes by spreading Brazilian architectural style. City of Potos√≠ has been listed on the World Heritage List by the UNESCO in 1987. File:PMa 000087 BOL Calamarca.jpgIglesia Nuestra Se√±ora, a Baroque style church in Bolivia, 17th century.

Another representative city built by the Spanish settlers is the Historic City of Sucre. This is a city built in the south-central part of Bolivia in the first half of the 16th century. The various buildings in the city are well preserved, blending in Latin America and kinds of European architectural style Sucre's predecessor was La Plata, a silver town founded by the Spanish settlers in 1538. It is the representative of the indigenous culture of Characas. To commemorate the independent leader Antonio Jose de Sucre, it was designated as the first capital of Bolivia and renamed Sucre. This historic city was designed according to a simple urban plan, with a checkerboard pattern of streets, similar to other cities established by the Spanish settlers in the United States during the same period. Since the wealth of the nearby City of Potos√≠ has supported the economics of La Plata, La Plata has been the center of justice, religion and culture in the region since its establishment. In La Plata, Characas Audiencia is the prototype of the current Supreme Court. As a cultural centre, La Plata has many universities and royal colleges, such as the University of Saint-Francois-Xavier, the Royal Academia Carolina, and San Isabel de Hungria Seminario. These buildings are representative of the fusion of European architectural style and the style of local architecture in Latin America. Of course, in Sucre, the most representative architectural style is religious architecture. A series of cathedrals built since the 16th century, such as San L√°zaro, San Francisco, Santo Domingo and the Metropolitan Cathedral. In the 250-year span of construction, the integration of the architectural styles of the two continents became more and more mature. As one of the most important construction in Bolivia, Casa de la Libertad was built in 1621 as part of the Convent of the Jesuits, where it witnessed the independence of Bolivia. The 18th century architecture best reflects the style of the local architecture, similar to the structure in the same period in City of Potos√≠. Architecture in Sucre, is a complete display of the architectural style brought from Europe and the blend of local architectural styles and traditions in Bolivia, including the architectural traditions and styles of the Renaissance, Mud√©jar, Gothic, Baroque and Neoclassical periods. Historic City of Sucre has been listed on the World Heritage List by the UNESCO in 1991.

The architectural style became Neoclassical style, which is much like in Europe, but it also retained the characteristics of the early courtyard. During this time, large number of new churches and government buildings were built in Bolivia. But in the early 20th century, due to war, social unrest and economic depression, there was little development in Bolivia's architecture except for the necessary government buildings and churches. = Modern Bolivia (1982‚Äìpresent) = In the late 20th century and early 21st century, a large number of impressive buildings were built again in Bolivia. Like many countries in the world, modern Bolivian architecture is dominated by modern and postmodernism. Skyscrapers have risen in many cities and gradually occupied the skyline. Some representative cities are San Jorge, La Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba. The Top 10 skyscrapers in Bolivia are almost in La Paz and Santa Cruz. The tallest skyscraper of Bolivia is WTC TOYOSA Tower 1 which is 228 meters in La Paz. This is a building for office use.

For example, there is a new technology for repairing the ruins of Tiwanaku, 3D printing. Some parts of the Tiwanaku ruins were damaged due to the destruction of the Spanish colonists. So this study converted the literature into a 3D form, then Researchers can try to make quick combinations, which often try different insights into previous architectural styles. File:Virtual model pumapunku.png3D printing model pumapunku 1 File:Virtual model pumapunku2.png3D printing model pumapunku 2  Other style of architecture of Bolivia  In Bolivia, there are other unique architectural styles due to historical, cultural and geographical reasons. Over 15 km from Uyuni, southwest of Bolivia, there has the world‚Äôs largest salt flat, Salar de Uyuni. In order to attract tourists and provide them with convenience and comfort, combined with the local geographical environment, the world's first salt hotel, Palacio de Sal was built in 1998. This is an almost 100% salt hotel built by solid salt bricks from Salar de Uyuni. The hotel incorporates salt into every detail of the design to better blend into the dramatic and spectacular environment, bringing visitors different experiences and memories. The infrastructure and furniture in the hotel are also made of solid salt bricks from Salar de Uyuni. such as tables, chairs and other utensils. In public areas, the carefully carved salt sculptures by Bolivian artists are equally eye-catching. This white environment is easily reminiscent of white minimalism. At the same time, in order to prevent the salt environment from being too smooth, the deep red wood brings warm colors. Combining a wall with an alcove, a bedroom with a domed salt brick ceiling and a cathedral-like vestibule, this hotel gives the impression of a modern and local Andean architecture style. Unfortunately, the hotel must be demolished in 2002 due to environmental pollution caused by poor management. A new hotel was built at the eastern bank of Salar de Uyuni. Fortunately, the new hotel is still named after Palacio de Sal, and the infrastructure and furniture in the hotel are still made of solid salt bricks from Salar de Uyuni. But in order to comply with government standards, the health system has been redesigned. In the new hotel, same as the old hotel, people is forbidden to lick the walls in order to prevent the salt blocks from collapsing.

In the exterior of the building, similar pigments match each other for a colourful effect, while large glass panels are placed on the exterior wall. For a high-altitude city consist of bare bricks and monochrome, this clearly attracts attention. The Neo-Andean architecture rejects the minimalist and Baroque style preferred by Western traditional architects and marks the ‚Äúdecolonization of symbolic order‚Äù. For Mamani, architecture can promote Bolivian culture, to show and maintain the roots and identity of Bolivians themselves.

This is a rare constellation of symptoms with a predicted familial trend. The main signs of achalasia microcephaly syndrome involve the manifestation of each individual disease associated with the condition. Microcephaly can be primary, where the brain fails to develop properly during pregnancy, or secondary, where the brain is normal sized at birth but fails to grow as the child ages. Abnormalities will be observed progressively after birth whereby the child will display stunted growth and physical and cognitive development. The occipital-frontal circumference will be at or near the extreme lower end, the third percentile, indicating microcephaly. There are both genetic and behavioural causes of microcephaly. Achalasia, or oesophageal achalasia, is a disorder occurring in the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES). The LES fails to relax completely, resulting in frequent vomiting and regurgitation, usually one to two hours after meals. If untreated, the long-term health of the individual will be compromised, leading to the development of dysphagia, weight loss and chronic aspiration. It is very rare in children, especially siblings. Mortality, specifically in young children, can occur. Due to the nature of the individual diseases, there is no cure for achalasia microcephaly. Treatment for achalasia involves drugs and surgical intervention, such as heller myotomy, with the goal of relieving LES pressure and its symptoms. Management of these symptoms are important for the maintenance of the quality of life of the child and the prevention of the progression to more serious complications. These include organ perforation, aspiration pneumonia and death. Similarly, there is no cure for microcephaly and instead, early intervention, such as speech and physical therapy is recommended Families who have a genetic predisposition to microcephaly can involve genetic counselling in their planning for pregnancy As of 2017, there are 5 reported cases of achalasia microcephaly syndrome, all of which involve children.  Signs and symptoms  alt= The main symptoms of achalasia microcephaly syndrome are the progressive manifestation of the major symptoms associated with the individual diseases, in young children. Achalasia causes dysphagia, which leads to difficulties when eating, frequent vomiting after meals and possible respiratory arrest due to chronic aspiration. Symptoms can manifest at ages as young as six weeks. Alongside prominent dysphagia, the child will have microcephaly, which is characterised by an abnormally small head. Mild scaphocephaly may also be observed. This can manifest upon or after birth. Slow cognitive and fine motor development as well as delayed speech will be observed. Craniofacial dysmorphism, such as a globular-shaped nose, micrognathia and a flattened forehead may also be involved, but is not observed in all cases. Camptodactyly of some fingers can also manifest.  Cause  Achalasia microcephaly has only been reported in children, despite achalasia being associated as an adult disease. The first case involved an affected family of four children, three sisters and one brother, from northwest Mexico. All three sisters underwent the Heller procedure in order to relieve vomiting and regurgitation due to achalasia. The brother passed away at four and a half years old, due to the improper diagnosis of recurrent vomiting and resultant malnourishment. All siblings had slow to moderate cognitive development within the mentally retarded criteria. Both parents were unaffected and were from the same small village. The second case involved two affected brothers, aged seven and nine, from Libya, in a family of six children. By the age of two, both children were vomiting and regurgitating recurrently, had slow development and suffered from pneumonitis. They also displayed mild micrognathia and scaphocephaly. The elder son underwent a modified Heller's operation at age six. Their parents were first cousins, however, chromosomal studies did not observe any abnormalities. The third examined case was an affected nine-year-old boy born to unaffected parents who were from the same north-western Mexican area as the first reported case. It is denied but implicated that the parents were closely related. Abnormalities in motor function, physical appearance and difficulties during feeding manifested after birth. By eight months, psychomotor retardation was prominent and at nine months, malnourishment was extreme and so oesophagomyotomy (Heller myotomy) was performed. At eighteen months, microcephaly was revealed. The fourth case study involved an affected German child. Unlike previous cases, the condition was attributed to the anti-malaria drug, Mefloquine, which was prescribed during pregnancy. There is no apparent genetic correlation between parents. At eight weeks, the child was officially diagnosed with microcephaly and displayed craniofacial dysmorphism and muscular hypotonia similar to previous cases. Vomiting, seizures and respiratory arrest were common. It was noted that only 5.4% of pregnancies under the medication of Mefloquine experienced abnormalities. This is the first case involving a person of European descent. The fifth, most recent case, involved a girl born to consanguineous parents from Pakistan. There was no history of abnormalities or genetic disorders in previous children in the family. Gestational diabetes during the pregnancy did not cause any significant complications. Feeding difficulties and recurrent vomiting began to occur at six weeks, resulting in severe weight loss. The girl received surgery and repeated balloon dilatations by the age of two for severe achalasia. She was diagnosed with microcephaly at age six after concerns for her delayed fine motor skills and limited understanding of speech.  Mechanism  Achalasia is a neurodegenerative disease characterised by the degeneration of neurones of the myenteric plexus which are responsible for the motility of the digestive tract. It is extremely rare in children and normally affects the lower oesophageal sphincter (LES). LES contraction prevents acid reflux while relaxation allows food to enter the stomach. Impaired LES relaxation therefore leads to dysphagia, as the oesophagus cannot be emptied. Familial achalasia, whereby achalasia manifests among siblings, is noted in families displaying consanguinity or inbreeding as the disease can be passed on as an autosomal recessive trait. Microcephaly can manifest due to a variety of reasons, these include: TORCH infections, chromosomal and biochemical abnormalities and can be transmitted as an autosomal recessive, dominant or X-linked disorder. It is most commonly caused by congenital infections due to viruses such as cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus and Zika virus. The severe reduction of neural progenitors and neurones as a result of cell cycle arrest and neural progenitor death due to viral infection leads to microcephaly. There are two types of microcephaly, primary, occurring before thirty-two weeks of gestation or secondary, after birth. A reduced production of neurones is attributed to primary microcephaly whilst decreased dendritic connection is thought to cause secondary microcephaly, all amounting to an estimated brain size that is significantly smaller than average. Further, the cerebral cortex occupies 55% of the human brain, therefore, most microcephalic people are mentally retarded. Developmental delay in motor and communication skills will result. Congenital microcephaly has also been attributed to serine deficiencies that cause defects in two known enzymes: 3-phosphogycerate dehydrogenase and 3-phosphoserine phosphatase, leading to severe neurological abnormalities Like familial achalasia, microcephaly has an autosomal recessive predisposition. Although no disease-causing gene has been identified, studies suggest that due to the consanguinity or close relatedness of parents observed in four out of five cases, achalasia microcephaly might be inherited via an autosomal recessive gene.  Diagnosis  349x349px Symptoms of achalasia can be detected by fluoroscopy during barium swallow or oesophageal manometry. = Achalasia =  Barium swallow  A positive barium swallow will display the narrowing of the distal oesophagus in a ‚Äòbird beak‚Äô or ‚Äòchampagne class‚Äô fashion, aperistalsis, minimal LES opening and oesophageal dilation as the main indicator of the disease. Minimal barium will be present in the stomach. However, these diagnostic findings are not always present in the early onset of the disease and so a normal oesophagogram is not an indication of a lack of disease.  Oesophageal manometry  Patients who suffer from the vigorous achalasia variant of the disease, do not express dilation. Manometry is the best, most sensitive method in these cases as it can diagnose abnormalities related to achalasia based on basal pressure, without the need for the manifestation of dilation. Aperistalsis and a poorly relaxed and hypertensive LES is required for a positive diagnosis. = Microcephaly = Prenatal diagnosis of microcephaly is difficult due to the variability present in the causes of the disease. Early detection, however, is important for consanguineous parents as an autosomal recessive inheritance is highly implicated for microcephaly. Anomaly scans during pregnancy can be used to calculate the ratio between the head/abdominal circumference and head circumference/femur length which are used calculate and diagnose microcephaly. Ultrasound scans have also led to the accidental discovery of microcephaly, however this occurrence is an anomaly. Women who are at risk of contracting TORCH infections or exposure to Zika virus are recommended to undergo screening as most resultant infections are asymptomatic. This includes testing sera and saliva for viral antigens. Prenatal diagnosis is further complicated when microcephaly manifests with achalasia as it is only possible to detect symptoms shortly after the first trimester and early into the second. Consequently, microcephaly is usually diagnosed after the onset of achalasia by eighteen months or older. An occipital-frontal head circumference of less than three standard deviations is an indication of microcephaly. Radiography and NMR imaging of the skull can also be utilised. A physical examination of height and weight proportions as well as IQ and motor development is implemented for further confirmation as not all children with microcephaly have abnormal development A positive test will show normal to abnormal proportions, a low IQ and slow motor development.  Management  There is currently no treatment to reverse the neuropathology of achalasia or the effects of microcephaly. Instead, treatment focuses on the management of associated symptoms. = Achalasia = There are no medical interventions that allow the restoration of neurons in the myenteric plexus. Thus, early diagnosis of achalasia is crucial for the prevention of the progression of the disease to severe stages of aspiration pneumonia and organ perforation. Current treatment for achalasia symptoms focuses on the reduction of LES pressure to relieve dysphagia and therefore prevent further regurgitation, vomiting and aspiration. These include drugs such as anticholinergics and calcium channel blockers, mechanical dilation with a balloon dilator, or heller myotomy surgery. Botulinum toxin injections have been most successful in patients with vigorous achalasia and for those with unclear diagnosis. Follow up treatment involving re-dilatation or barium swallow is essential to monitor and prevent progression of disease severity. = Microcephaly = Early intervention involving speech pathology and occupational therapy can assist in addressing associated motor and speech dysfunction displayed by the child. Genetic counselling is utilised by families who are concerned or at a high risk of carrying genes for microcephaly. Congenital microcephaly due to serine deficiency can be treated by L-serine or L-serine with glycine in order to improve debilitating symptoms such as seizures and psychomotor retardation. Exogenous growth hormones can be used to boost development in microcephalic patients.  Epidemiology  Familial achalasia alone is scarce, especially in paediatric cases. Consequently, achalasia microcephaly, which has a familial predisposition, is an extremely rare syndrome. Current cases of achalasia microcephaly have only implicated children in its pathogenesis and there are only five, separate, known cases as of 2017. These cases involve a total of nine children, where each case refers to individual affected families. All cases, except for one, involves consanguineous parents.  Research  Knowledge of genes directly associated with achalasia microcephaly are unknown. However, genetic research is targeted towards the disease causing genes implicated in the manifestation of the individual diseases that arise alongside achalasia. These include recent breakthroughs that implicate 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase in causing congenital microcephaly, severe retardation and seizures. Treatment with L-serine coupled with early diagnosis have shown favourable outcomes. Studies implicate that biological disturbances in the pathways downstream of these candidate genes can lead to the development of achalasia. It is suggested that the disease has roots in neurological dysfunction due to the co-occurrence of microcephaly, the progressive narrowing of the oesophagus in the early stages of life and intellectual disability. Whole-exosome and whole-genome sequencing is proposed for the discovery of the underlying genetic cause of achalasia microcephaly. The familial trend of disease manifestation between siblings along with consanguinity in majority of cases is consistent with an autosomal recessive inheritance.

Johnson (October 15, 1868 ‚Äì June 26, 1940), more commonly referred to as J. B. Johnson, was an American attorney and politician who served as the 22nd Florida Attorney General.  Early life and military service  Johnson was born in Live Oak, Florida on October 15, 1868. On April 23, 1898, Johnson enlisted in the United States Army during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. He served as a first sergeant in Company L of the 1st Florida Infantry. His regiment did not see any combat, remaining in Tampa, Florida, and later Huntsville, Alabama, for the majority of the war. Johnson was mustered out of the Army on December 3, 1898. Educated in local schools, Johnson was admitted to the Florida Bar in 1903, and began a private practice in Live Oak.  Political career  In 1907, Johnson, a Democrat, was elected as the mayor of Live Oak. He was simultaneously elected to the Florida Senate, representing District 27, which encompassed Suwanee County. While in the senate, Johnson opposed legislature regulating child labor, and, as a fervent Methodist, he was a supporter of women's suffrage. In 1913, Johnson was appointed for a one year term as the President pro tempore of the Florida Senate by Senate President Ion L. Farris, and later in 1917, he would become the President of the Florida Senate, serving for only that year. Johnson did not seek reelection to either the senate or the mayoral office in 1922, opting to return to private practice. In 1925, Johnson was appointed as the 23rd Florida Attorney General by newly elected Governor John W. Martin, succeeding Rivers Buford, who Martin had appointed to the Florida Supreme Court. Johnson served as the Florida Attorney General until Martin appointed him as the judge of the Second Judicial Circuit Court of Florida.  Personal life and death  Johnson died in Live Oak on June 26, 1940. He is buried in the Live Oak Cemetery. Johnson was married to Mary Wagner on 1902. They were married until her death in 1923 and had two children with her: Wagner B. and John Paul. Johnson was a member of the Freemasons.

Nadell (born 1951) is an American historian, researcher, author, and lecturer focusing on Jewish history. Former President of the Association for Jewish Studies, she currently holds the Patrick Clendenen Chair in Women's and Gender History at American University. Nadell has focused her research on Jewish women and their role within Jewish history as well as in shaping the history of the United States through their role in various social and political movements.  Life and education  Nadell was born to Alice and Irwin M. Nadell in 1951 and grew up in Livingston, New Jersey. After graduating from Livingston High School in 1969, she attended Douglass College of Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey, where she majored in Hebraic Studies graduating with high honors. Nadell spent her junior year abroad studying at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. She continued her studies at Ohio State University where she earned her Masters in Jewish History (1976) and doctorate in American Jewish History (1982). While completing her doctorate on Eastern-European Jewish Migration patterns, Nadell received a fellowship from the American Jewish Archives, and was honored by Ohio State President, Harold Enarson, for her excellence as a teaching assistant.  Scholarship  Nadell's scholarship focuses on American Jewish history, especially the history of American Jewish women. In 1995, she was guest editor of an issue of American Jewish History devoted to research about women. She subsequently edited volumes including Women and American Judaism: Historical Perspectives (2001; with Jonathan D. Sarna), and American Jewish Women's History: A Reader, and authored others, including Women Who Would be Rabbis: A History of Women's Ordination and America's Jewish Women: A History from Colonial Times to Today. Her work brings to the fore Jewish women previously ignored in most history books. She highlights the roles women have played in changing historically set precedents. In doing so she has publicized the names of the first women to push against the established male-only rabbinates of the United States, tracing the origins of that debate in the late 19th century to an 1889 short story in the Jewish Exponent, \\"A Problem for Purim,\\" by the journalist Mary M. Cohen, a member of the historic Philadelphia synagogue, Congregation Mikveh Israel. Dedicating her work to advancing the scholarship laid down by historians of women's history, Nadell has ventured to explore the means in which women traditionally shut out of religious spaces continue to assert influence within and outside the religious domain. In America's Jewish Women: A History from Colonial Times to Today, religion becomes only one of the diverse commitments and activities of Jewish women. In this groundbreaking history, Nadell shows two threads binding the nation's Jewish women: a powerful sense of self and a deep commitment to making the world a better place. Informed by the shared values of America's founding and Jewish identity, Nadell highlights Jewish women's activism in the history of the nation they came to call home, from the 18th to the 20th century. She writes about the colonial era matriarch Grace Nathan and Nathan's great-granddaughter poet Emma Lazarus, about labor organizer Bessie Hillman, and about Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She discusses Jewish women's activism in the labor, birth control, suffrage, civil rights, and feminist movements. She also discusses sexual assaults of sweatshop workers during the mid-20th century, as well as the hardships many women would endure as agunot, women whose husbands cannot or will not grant them a religious divorce who can never remarry under Jewish law.  Role in public life  Nadell has shared her knowledge of Jewish women in America with the National Museum of American Jewish History in Philadelphia, including the stories of success highlighted in the \\"Only In America\\" gallery. After being elected in 2014, Nadell served as president of the Association for Jewish Studies from 2015 to 2017. While president, Nadell wrote an open letter to Hungarian President Zolt√°n Balog in opposition of the controversial amendments being made to the National Higher Education Law. The amendment would increase obstacles to universities operating outside European Union (EU) countries with sister-schools inside the EU. In her letter, Nadell expressed concern that such obstacles would encumber scholarship coming out of the Budapest-based Central European University. Nadell penned another letter as president, along with the Association for Jewish Studies executive board to Israeli ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer expressing concern over amendments made to the Israeli Entry into Israel Law. The law would prohibit the issuing of visas to foreign nationals who have made \\"public calls for boycotting Israel.\\" For Nadell, who herself identifies as a free-speech advocate, an attempt to suppress the speech of others would be seen as a deep concern. Nadell voiced similar free-speech concerns in 2017 before the House Judiciary Committee during a hearing on antisemitism on college campuses. The hearing would come as Members of Congress debated adding language to a proposed bill defining antisemitism as language which would \\"demonize, delegitimize, or apply a double standard to Israel.\\" In her testimony, Nadell alleged that such a definition would only limit free speech, and stated that Jewish students \\"feel safe on campus\\" without restrictions.

The development team was headed by Mark Turmell and Sal Divita, who were known for being behind NBA Jam, and NFL Blitz was a deliberate attempt to translate the exaggerated arcade-style approach of NBA Jam to the football realm. The game was ported to the PlayStation, Nintendo 64, Windows, and Game Boy Color in 1998. Gameplay NFL Blitz is based on seven-on-seven-man football teams. It also diverges from traditional rules of American football in that there are no penalties, no substitutions, and players can perform illegal attacks on each other such as dropkicks. The game features a full NFL license, with players and teams from the 1997 season. Development The game was developed by a team lead by Mark Turmell and Sal Divita, who wanted to \\"do for the NFL franchise what we did for the NBA franchise [with NBA Jam]\\" in Turmell's words. In particular, they wanted to create a football game which allows the players to get to the action more quickly than other football games, which they found tended to bog the player down in the play-select screen and other setup menus. The arcade board is called the Seattle System, which is based on a 3Dfx chipset. According to Divita, the team decided to make the game support just two players instead of four \\"because in a football game, there just isn't enough gameplay between the quarterback and the receiver to make it fun. It's not like NBA Jam, where teamwork can really be a factor.\\" Reception The Nintendo 64 and PlayStation versions received universal acclaim, while the PC version received favorable reviews, according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Next Generation said in its June 1998 issue that the arcade version \\"provides an unrealistic but adrenaline-packed experience.\\" The same magazine later said of the PlayStation version in its November 1998 issue, \\"The only real knock we have on Blitz is that, like the arcade version, the lack of play variety can get stale after a while, especially in single- player mode. Despite that one problem, Blitz offers the most intense game of football you're likely to find at home and makes a worthy purchase.\\" AllGame gave the arcade version four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that \\"it's not football played according to real rules, but it's still a blast. It's more like those pick-up games you played with kids in your neighborhood way back when, when every play was a pass and you needed two completions for a first down. The only difference is that punting is an option in this game, and if you had treated your opponents as a kid the way you can treat them in this game, then you're probably reading this from prison right now.\\" GameFan gave the N64 version universal acclaim, over a month before said console version was released Stateside. Computer Games Strategy Plus gave the PC version four stars out of five and said, \\"After yet another late hit, you're sure to nod in approval when the announcer says, 'That was totally uncalled for, but awfully fun to watch.'\\" Kevin Cheung of Hyper gave the N64 version 83% and stated, \\"The bottom line is that Blitz is the most offensively oriented football game around, with enough punishment that guarantees pleasure for the masses.

Though she does not have a boyfriend, Essie subtly influences her mother to suggest she marry Roarke Richards, a fellow teenager whose family is experiencing financial difficulties, yet who has aspirations to attend Columbia University. Celia offers Roarke and his family hundreds of thousands of dollars for him to marry Essie. The identity of the baby's father is not known to the reader for much of the novel, though it is eventually revealed that Essie's brother Caleb repeatedly raped her from age twelve and impregnated her. Roarke and Essie marry; with the money they gained from Essie's parents in exchange for doing so, Essie gains financial freedom. After wavering whether or not to do so, Essie decides to release a memoir of her diaries, detailing the abuse she experienced and exposing her family for covering it up.

Characters *Esther \\"Essie\\" Hicks: the youngest child of the Hicks family who is raped and impregnated by her older brother *Roarke Richards: The teenager Essie's mother arranges for her to marry *Liberty Bell: former hyperconservative teen-blogger turned reporter whom Essie enlists to help her release her side of the story to the public *Celia Richards: Essie's calculating mother *Caleb Hicks: Essie's older brother who raped her and her sister Themes In showing the Hicks' disparate treatment of their sons and daughters, the novel \\"asks that we look at the burdens we expect daughters to bear, and the free passes we give to sons\\". It also examines the American cultural obsession with celebrities and reality television. Reception With its conservative Christian family featured on reality television, the novel has been described as \\"a mashup of the Kardashians and the Duggars\\". Claire Hopley of The Washington Times noted that despite the novel's busy plot and three narrators, the novel does not get confusing and remains readable, \\"a testament to author Meghan Weir‚Äôs firm hand on the tiller of her plot\\". Kirkus Reviews called the novel \\"sensitive if not particularly subtle\\", with \\"genuine emotional punch\\". Publishers Weekly noted that some characters are finely nuanced, though \\"its villains lack dimension\\". Awards and nominations MacLean Weir won an Alex Award for The Book of Essie in 2019. The Book of Essie was a 2018 finalist for the New England Book Awards in the fiction category. References 2018 American novels Alfred A.

The court preceded the Idaho Supreme Court, established when Idaho became a state in 1890. Early life and family Weir was born in 1826 in Indiana, Pennsylvania, and he attended Blairsville Academy. He read law with Agustus Drum, and in 1852 he was admitted to practice law in Pennsylvania. In 1849 Weir married Katherine A. Porter, and the marriage produced three children, Agnes Lenore (Baker), Edward Weir, and Hugh Weir. Career Soon Weir and Drum formed a law partnership in Indiana, Weir later partnering with Robert M. Gibson in Pittsburgh in 1870 then with J.M. Garrison in 1884. A Democrat, Weir was active in local politics, and he ran unsuccessfully for Congress against John Covode in 1866. President Cleveland nominated Weir to replace James B. Hays, Chief Justice of the Idaho Territorial Court, in 1888, and the nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate later that year. Weir had been nominated as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Utah Territory, but that appointment went to Elliott Sandford. In 1889 Judge Weir wrote an opinion upholding the Idaho Territorial Legislature in its partition of Alturas County. Weir's political opponents, led by W.R. Riley of Hailey, the county seat, demanded that Weir be removed from office. President Harrison replaced Weir with James H. Beatty, a judge from Hailey, in November, 1889. Death After his time as chief justice, Weir formed a partnership with J.R. Wester, Weir & Wester, and he continued his law practice in Boise until his death in 1893.

It was first implemented in 2001. The word coblation is short for ‚Äòcontrolled ablation‚Äô, which means a controlled procedure used to destroy soft tissue. This procedure uses low temperature radio frequency during the operation, which was found to cause less pain for the patient than previous technologies used for tonsillectomy. Data collected from coblation tonsillectomy operations showed that the healing of the tonsillar fossa is much faster when this low temperature technology is used instead of a heat based technology, such as electrocautery tonsillectomy. Since coblation has been introduced to the medical field, more than 10 million surgical operations have been performed, but as of 2019, research is still ongoing to determine the positive and negative effects of this procedure.  Technology  206x206px 184x184px = Components = The equipment used for coblation tonsillectomy consists of a radio frequency (RF) generator, foot pedal control, irrigation system, and a tonsil wand. The generator provides radio frequency, which is essential for the procedure, and connects the foot pedal system to the tonsil wand. The foot pedals are colour coded to prevent confusion: one is yellow and is used for controlling the coblation, while the other is blue and used for controlling the radio frequency cautery. The wand is connected to the RF generator so it can be controlled with the pedals. The wand consists of a base electrode and an active electrode, which have ceramic and flowing saline between them. The radio frequency current that is produced by the generator travels through the saline, breaking the molecular bonds and forming ions. This creates a plasma field around the electrodes, which is used for removing soft tissue. There should not be any smoke produced while the coblation wand is being used during the operation; if this occurs, it is a sign that ablated tissue has entered the coblation wand's electrode area. This means that the current is not able to break down the saline into ions properly, so smoke is produced. When this happens, the coblation wand needs to be cleaned out before using it again. = Plasma field = The plasma field has a radius of about 100Œºm-200Œºm around the electrodes and is kept stable within the head of the coblation wand by the continuous supply of saline. Furthermore, the plasma field is controlled by the bipolar energy between the negative and positive ions that are produced by the plasma in order to use a precise amount of plasma to prevent damaging healthy tissues around the tonsils. Plasma does not have a thermal effect on tissue: it only affects it on a chemical level. The plasma field produces positively charged hydrogen ions (H+) and negatively charged hydroxide ions (OH-), which enable plasma to destroy tissue. There is no or only minor damage done to nearby tissues during the coblation procedure because charged particles move between the generated plasma field and the ablated tissue, hence the molecules breakdown without the temperatures rising high. The temperature for coblation tonsillectomy ranged from 60 ¬∞C to 70 ¬∞C, while other tonsillectomy operation procedures, such as electrosurgery require temperatures ranging from 400 ¬∞C to 600 ¬∞C, which is much higher. Thus, coblation is considered to be a non-heat focused medical procedure that is much better at causing minimal thermal damage to untargeted tissues near the targeted area.  Reasons for surgery  The need for removing tonsils of an individual using the coblation tonsillectomy surgical process can occur for four reasons. Firstly, the patient may have frequent long lasting tonsillitis. Secondly, tonsils can become swollen and inflamed which may cause breathing problems. Thirdly, blood loss can occur through the tonsils, which is a sign that they need to be removed. Lastly, in some cases tonsils get affected by rare diseases and viruses, which can only be treated by removing the tonsils. = Tonsillitis = Tonsils are part of the first line of defense in the mouth as they create white blood cells in order to fight diseases, bacteria and viruses that enter through the mouth. Owing to being exposed to amounts of material that enter the mouth, tonsils can become infected, which is called tonsillitis. This occurs mainly in children as in this age group is when the tonsils are the key providers of immune system functions. By the time individuals reach adulthood, they have been exposed to many diseases, bacteria and viruses, so they have developed immunity against these infection causing micro-organisms. Thus, adults normally do not need the help of tonsils anymore. When tonsillitis occurs regularly, meaning about seven times a year then the removal of tonsils is needed, otherwise it can have detrimental effects on the individual's health. Furthermore, tonsil surgery may be required when antibiotic treatment does not help in getting rid of the bacteria, which causes tonsillitis. = Swollen tonsils = After being exposed to several tonsil infections, tonsils have the tendency to become swollen and inflamed, but other factors may make them enlarged as well, such as genetics. Some of the significant problems that can arise due to having enlarged tonsils are breathing difficulties and the ability to swallow, thus the removal of tonsils is required. = Other conditions = After having frequent tonsil infections or severe diseases, bleeding from the tonsils tissues can occur. Furthermore, cancer cells can develop in the tonsil tissues. These are mostly uncommon but can still occur and can only be treated by surgically removing the tonsils from the both sides of the back of the throat.  Risks of the surgery  Similarly to any other medical surgery, coblation tonsillectomy has health risk factors as well, which can but will not necessarily occur from the surgery. Firstly, reactions to the general anesthetic drug, which is used to make the patients sleep while they are under surgery, can cause both short-term and long-term health problems, for example minor health problems like vomiting, nausea, muscle soreness, headache, and major health problems can include death. Another risk factor is that swelling can occur throughout the whole mouth during the beginning section of the surgery, but swelling is most likely to occur on the tongue and in the tissues surrounding the tonsils at the back of the throat. Furthermore, rarely bleeding may be present in the tonsil area of the mouth throughout the surgical procedure, which would need extra treatment on top of the coblation tonsillectomy surgery. This would require the patient to remain in the hospital for a longer period of time in order to fully recover. Bleeding in areas around the tonsils can also occur during the healing stage in the first few weeks after surgery because the wound is still fresh and can open up in come occasions. In addition, infections may develop in the mouth from the surgery, the main cause of these infections are the surgical equipment that are used if they were not disinfected properly before surgical procedure.  Surgery  Location of tonsils in the mouth = Overview = Tonsillectomy is a surgical procedure that consists of taking out the patient's tonsils, which produce chemical substances in back mouth area to assist in keeping a good health by fighting off infections. Tonsils can become enlarged when they are infected by a virus or bacteria over and over again, hence to combat the frequently occurring infections it becomes necessary to surgically remove the tonsils. High percentage of the population get their tonsils removed in their child years, however some people who do not go through the operation in their early years tend to get it removed later on in their lifetime because their tonsil glands swell to a point where they are struggling to breath. = Before the procedure = Before the surgery begins, the surgeon will take multiple blood test, physically examine the patient, and the surgeon will also check the past medical records of the patient to make sure it is safe to conduct the surgical procedure. On top of that, the surgeon doctor will ask about the types of medications that have been taken by the patient in the last 10 days following up to the surgery because certain medications can increase the chances of bleeding during the surgical procedure, such as aspirin and naproxen. Furthermore, the patient will be required to stop the consumption of any food and drinks for several hours before the procedure begins. = Surgical Procedure = Coblation tonsillectomy is an outpatient surgical process, meaning patients are able leave the hospital and go home after they have went through the surgery and have woken up, so they it is unnecessary for them to stay overnight. At the start of the surgical procedure, the patient is given a specific amount of general anesthesia to go into a deep sleep, in which they are not able to feel any pain until it wears off, and by the time it wears off the operation is over as it tends take less than one hour for operation to be fully done. Additionally, a breathing tube is provided for the patient, which is inserted into the nose instead of the regular breathing tube for the mouth in order to have enough space in the mouth for the surgery to be conducted in a safe and precise manner. The operation commences immediately after the patient has fallen asleep from the anesthesia. A mouth prop is used as a wedge to put between the upper and lower teeth on one side of the mouth in order to keep the patient's mouth wide open and steady for the surgeon to conduct the surgery with ease. Both tonsils are removed with coblation technology by applying precise amounts of plasma to detach the tonsils from the surrounding tissues without causing thermal damage. After the tonsils are fully removed, any bleeding that occurs at the back of the throat is stopped and the patient is woken up using medical drugs. Then the breathing tubes are completely removed and the patient is moved to the post-anesthesia care unit to recover and wake up.  Recovery from surgery  After the coblation tonsillectomy surgery, the patient will be taken the recovery room, where they will wake up soon after the surgery. A nurse will check the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and if any bleeding is present. If bleeding is present in the tonsil area due to slow recovery rate then the patient will be required to stay at the hospital overnight. Otherwise, if everything is stable then the patient can go home, but a relative or someone close to the patient will be required to take them home and take care of the patient until necessary. One to two weeks is normally the required time to for all wounds to fully heal from the coblation tonsillectomy surgery. Until the patient is still recovering at home, they should try not to come in contact with any sick people because the recovery stage is critical as they can easily get an infection in the tonsil area. The patient will likely experience pain in the throat, ears, jaws, and neck where it is most common. So it is recommended to take pain medication to reduce the pain in these areas. Furthermore, to assist the recovery of the wounds and to avoid any obstacles during recovery, the patient should consume lots of fluids to prevent being dehydrated. The patient only consume food that can be swallowed with an ease, soft and smooth food is recommended in order to prevent reopening the wounds from the surgery. The most vital part of recovery is taking lots of bed rest and avoiding physical activity, like sports for about two weeks. In some cases, it is vital for the patient to see a doctor immediately or go to emergency in a hospital if any health problems occur during recovery, for example bleeding, fever, dehydration and breathing problems.

The station has the dual status of being a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GMO) station and a European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP) supersite. Mace Head research and monitor the climate and atmospheric composition, focusing on aerosol-cloud interactions and mercury readings. TOC  About  Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station was established in 1987, and is still in operation. The current station manager is Mr Gerry Spain, who has held this position for the last 20 years. The station PI/Contact is Professor Simon O‚ÄôDoherty, who runs trace gas measurement at the University of Bristol, and the station CO-PI is Professor Peter Simmonds. Mace Head is funded by the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and NASA. The station has the dual status of being a World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Atmosphere Watch (GMO) station and a European Monitoring and Evaluation Program (EMEP) supersite. It is operated by both the National University of Ireland Galway's School of Physics and the University's Ryan Institute Centre for Climate and Air Pollution studies. The National University of Ireland Galway‚Äôs School of Physics has operated at Mace Head for 50 years, and Mace Head Station is one of the most important Global Atmosphere Watch stations in the Northern Hemisphere. With funding from research projects, it is the NUIG personnel; the students and post-doctoral fellows who are responsible for the operation and maintenance of equipment at Mace Head station. The NUIG provide the costs used for consumables such as filters, as well as the transport of chemical analysis samples to the Glasnevin, Dublin laboratory.  Location  The Mace Head Atmospheric Research Station is located on the West Coast of Ireland in Carna, County Galway. This Northern Hemisphere station has westerly exposure to the North Atlantic Ocean, with coordinates of 53¬∞20‚Äô N and 9¬∞54‚Äô W. This is a clean sector from 180 degrees to 300 degrees, and it is approximately 60% of the air that is measured by the site arrives through this clean sector. It has a time zone of UTC+1 or GMT+1, with 1200mm of annual rainfall, 10¬∞C average air temperature, and a sea temperature of 10¬∞C in winter and 15¬∞C in summer. Peat lands and wetlands surround the station, and its location is approximately 90m from the shoreline. To reduce pollutants influencing and interfering with measurements taken at the site, Mace Head is strategically located approximately 88km West of Galway city. Similarly, the clean sector surrounding the site also includes three small close surrounding islands, but they are uninhabited and thus do not influence the measurements taken at the site. Furthermore, the main Atlantic shipping routes are over 150km away, and the transatlantic air corridors are over 80km away, thus ensuring cleaner readings. The location of Mace Head makes it an ideal site for measuring marine biogenic gases, aerosol production and chemistry, and long-range transport of air pollution. It is also ideal for studying the atmosphere under Northern Hemispheric conditions as well as European conditions during eastern winds. There are numerous facilities on the site used for recording and analysing data. These facilities consist of a 10m meteorological tower, an aluminium walk-up tower and a cargo container laboratory, and three laboratory buildings; one that‚Äôs 300m from the shore, and two that are 90m from the shore.  History  Research and operations began during 1978 to 1983 in Adrigole, located a few kilometres from Mace Head. However, this was shut down and the operations officially moved to the Mace Head site in 1987. It was from 1987 that measurements of chloroform, methane and trichloro trifluoroethane began, and in 1995 carbon monoxide and hydrogen began. In October of 1994 the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE) network installed their first automated gas chromatography-mass spectrometer. It was later replaced by the Agilent 5973 MS in 1998, and in December of 2004 was retired and the Medusa gas chromatography mass spectrometry system (Medusa-GCMS) installed.  Mission Statement and Research Themes  The Mace Head station has numerous research aims and themes, such as monitoring climate change, atmospheric composition, aerosol-cloud interactions, air quality, atmosphere-ocean exchange and climate-ecosystem interactions. Their mission statement states that their goal is to monitor trends of atmospheric composition change, monitor climate variables and air pollution, and research atmospheric composition and its impact on climate change.Mace Head also wants to promote education within the topics of climate, air pollution, and the atmosphere.  Instruments  Mace Head uses a variety of instruments to record their findings. Some of these instruments include a ceilometer and doppler lidar, both used to detect clouds and aerosols, a cloud radar, microwave radiometer and a nano-scanning mobility particle sizer. Mace Head also has a gas chromatography mass spectrometry system (Medusa-GCMS), which was installed in December 2004 and measures trace gas species. Mace Head also has an automated atomic fluorescence analyzer (AFS) and an automated atomic absorption analyzer (AAS), both used to measure time resolved mercury measurements. There is also a cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS) which is used to measure carbon dioxide and methane. There is also a gas chromatorgraph-electron capture detector (GC- ECD) to measure sulphur hexafluoride and nitrous oxide, and a gas chromatophraph-multi detector (GC-MD) to measure carbon monoxide and hydrogen.  Measurements and Recordings  Mace Head is renowned for their atmospheric chemistry research, as they measure numerous meteorological elements such as wind speed and direction, temperature, rainfall, and humidity. They also record and measure greenhouse gases, UV levels, and solar radiation. Mace Head began measuring the ozone since 1988, chloroform, methane and trichloro trifluoroethane in 1897, and carbon monoxide and hydrogen began in 1995. Mark Lunt measured chlorofluorobarbon (CFC), and Jurgita Ovadnevaite reported on the aerosol-cloud and climate interactions at Mace head, specifically the major advances in sea salt aerosols. Observations of methyl chloroform at Mace Head have also been useful in the understanding of methane removal from the atmosphere, which is caused by trends in atmospheric hydroxyl radical concentrations. Whilst Mace Head does measure numerous atmospheric compositions, they mainly focuses on the measurements of aerosols and mercury readings, but also observed and measures storms and strong winds. = Storm and Wind Speeds = Mace Head measures storms and strong winds that pass through specifically during winter; storm season. One such storm measured was Storm Ali, the first storm of the 2018-2019 season. Storm Ali arrived at the northern areas of the British Isles on the 19th of September, and brought heavy rain and strong wind to Northern Ireland and Western Scotland. The highest recorded gust was at Cairngorm Summit with 105 mph, and Mace Head captured one of the highest recordings at 90 mph. Storm Ali impacted and disrupted Ireland immensely, causing power outages, travel disruption, damage to buildings and transport, as well as two deaths. Storm Callum was the third storm of the 2018-2019 season, impacting the UK during the 12th and 13th of October. Callum brought windy weather, rainfall, power outages, and since there were high tides the winds caused large waves thus many sea walls fell, resulting in coastal flooding. Mace Head measured wind gusts of 72 mph, with maximum gust speeds reading 86 mph in Capel Curig. Additionally, Storm Fionn was also measured at Mace Head. It was named by Met Eireann, and was the seventh storm of the 2018-2019 winter. It arrived in Ireland on the 16th of January and was observed and measured not only at Mace Head, but also other sites such as Sherkin Ireland, Valentia Observatory, St Mary's Airport and Aberdaron. The highest recorded gust was measured at Mace Head, with a wind speed of 85 mph. Storm Fionn did not have as significant disruption to Ireland as Storm Ali created, with the only impacts being traffic disruption and snowfall. Other storms measured at Mace Head include, Storm Erik at 76 mph and Storm Jake at 83 mph. = Aerosols = Air quality modelling is used to highlight the relationship between atmospheric concentrations, emissions, meteorology and other factors. These atmospheric measurements are useful in detailing trace gas concentrations and various atmospheric aerosols. Aerosols are liquid particles suspended in the air, and they influence the climate by scattering light and affecting clouds, thus they work in opposition to greenhouse gases and cause cooling. Natural aerosols include sulfates, ammonium salts and sea salts. Mace Head has one of the most advanced aerosol monitoring sites in Europe, providing important and vital ash data during the Icelandic volcano eruption during April and May. The 14th of April, 2010 saw the Icelandic‚Äôs Eyjafjallajokull volcano erupt, with volcanic ash rising up to 9km into the air. The weather conditions worsened for central Europe, with pollutants remaining for the next 6 days. The vertical volcanic ash plume had a peak of 3.5km and was intercepted Mace Head 33 times over a 6 week period, with approximately three of these events lasting more than 12hrs in duration, thus displaying it to be an incredibly strong ash plume. Mace Head uses a doppler cloud lidar and a ceilometer to detect clouds and aerosols about fifteen meters above ground level. This detection and sampling of aerosols is based on wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity and rain presence. For ideal collection of samples, there should be a low wind speed, <95% humidity and no rain present. Furthermore, more dependable samples are taken over multiple days. There are five main parameters that are routinely measured at Global Atmosphere Watch stations. These are aerosol optical depth, absorption, scattering, mass, and chemistry. Mass and chemistry of aerosols have not yet been measured at Mace Head but will be recorded over the coming years. The cloud radar can also be used to detect non-spherical and depolarizing volcanic ash particles. Thus, Mace Head is perfect for detecting volcanic aerosol plumes which could be used to alert locations with volcanoes nearby, namely Ireland and Europe, about possible eruptions. = Mercury = The Mace Head station has been recording mercury (Hg) since 1995, and has thus been one of the longest running mercury recording stations in the world. Mercury data recording and collection is vital as it is a global environmental pollutant emitted both naturally and from man-made sources. Evidence suggests that mercury emissions from man made sources are as great as those originating from natural sources, thus it is the man-made emitted mercury that is contributing to an increase in environmental exposure to mercury. Long term and continuous measurements are necessary as it details whether a fluctuation is normal or something unusual, thus allowing one to monitor background levels of total gaseous mercury. Continuous measurements of mercury are taken within a 15 minute time resolution, and is one of the first stations to generate total gaseous measurements with such a high time resolution. Furthermore, long term monitoring can provide direct evidence of temporal trends, as mercury has an atmospheric residence time of approximately 1 year. Measurements recorded at Mace Head display that background levels of mercury in the Northern Hemisphere are approximately 1.7 ng/m3 with a seasonal variation of approximately 20%.  Other International Research Networks  Mace Head is one of many international research networks, including the Atmospheric/Ocean Chemistry Experiment (AEROCE), the Advanced Global Atmospheric Gases Experiment (AGAGE), the World Meteorological Organization/Global Atmosphere Watch (WMO/GAW), the Budget of Ozone over the Atlantic (BOA), the Tropospheric Ozone Research (TOR, a EUROTRAC project), and the Climate Monitoring and Diagnostic Laboratory/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (CMDL/NOAA). There are five European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) monitoring stations in Ireland, with Mace Head being the site situated in West Ireland. The remaining four sites are Malin Head Glenveagh in the North, Valentia Observatory in the South, Carnsore Point and Johnstown Castle in the East and Oak Park located inland. Each of these EMEP sites have their chemical analysis undertaken by the Met Eireann at their Dublin Laboratory in Glasnevin.

He was a founding partner of the national society of authors and composers, Sociedad de Autores y Compositores de M√©xico (SACM).Biography of Severiano Brise√±o Ch√°vez on SACM (Written in Spanish) Accessed April 28, 2019.  Biographical information  On February 21, 1902, he was born in the small mountain town of San Jos√© de Canoas in the state of San Luis Potos√≠, to father Ram√≥n Brise√±o and mother Petra Chavez. At six years of age, his family emigrated to the Huasteca Region. From an early age, he had an inclination towards music, and his ability to compose songs was encouraged by his parents. His first song, called \\"Escolleras\\", was dedicated to the Tamaulipas port of Tampico and the song was well received because townsfolk were honoured to have been mentioned. Severiano Brise√±o Married Jovita Marquez in Altamira, Tamaulipas on June 7, 1932. With his brothers Guillermo and Rafael, he formed the Tr√≠o Los Tamaulipecos, and the band was popularly hired for nighttime serenades. Later it gained popularity when one of his songs, \\"El toro reques√≥n\\", was recorded for the soundtrack of the 1937 film Cuatro milpas. His songs started to achieve increasing popularity, especially \\"Caminito de Contreras\\" and \\"Ya lo pagar√°s con Dios\\", which was performed by Lucha Reyes and Ranchera singer Vargas de Tecalitl√°n. Later, he composed \\"El corrido de Monterrey\\", a composition which led him to find patrons amongst the upper class of the capital of Nuevo Le√≥n. In mid-1945, they performed El corrido de Monterrey on a national radio program. Increasing fame and support was obtained by those living in Sinaloa when he composed \\"El Sinaloense\\", the hit that popularized his performing group Tr√≠o Los Tamaulipecos. The definitive triumph of the song occurred when the Banda Los Guamuchile√±os incorporated it to its repertoire. Throughout the 50 years since it was composed, this ranchera song has become one of the most popular songs in the Banda music Genre. As such it has been recorded or performed by renowned artists such as Lola Beltr√°n, El Charro Avitia, Valent√≠n Elizalde, Piporro, Juan Gabriel, Luis Aguilar, and hundreds of others. In 1945 he was part of the group of authors and composers who founded the Society of Authors and Composers of Mexico (SACM). He died on October 6, 1988.
