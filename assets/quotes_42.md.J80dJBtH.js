His mother, Diana Maud Lyttelton (1920‚Äì2008), was the second daughter of George William Lyttelton of the Lyttelton family (Viscounts Cobham), thus making Lord Hood a nephew of noted entertainer Humphrey Lyttelton. Not long after succeeding his father to the title, he lost his seat in the House of Lords due to the House of Lords Act 1999 which removed all but 92 hereditary peers. He most recently stood as a crossbencher in the 2016 by-election following the removal of Lord Bridges for non-attendance without being on leave of absence and came third. Lord Hood married Flora Casement in 1991. The Viscountess is a maternal cousin of actor Hugh Grant. The couple have three sons and two daughters. Lord Hood was educated at Eton College and obtained a Master of Arts (Scotland) degree at the University of Edinburgh before gaining law qualifications at the College of Law in 1987.

The fructose porters of this family phosphorylate fructose on the 1-position. Those of TC family 4.A.6 phosphorylate fructose on the 6-position.  Structure  The IIA, IIB and IIC domains of the fructose- and mannitol-specific porters are demonstrably homologous. The IIB and IIC domains of the fructose porters appear to be dissimilar from each other as those of the mannitol porters. The IIB and IIC domains of these porters are homologous to those of the Glc family. However, the structure of the IIA domain of the mannitol porter of Escherichia coli has been determined, and it proved to possess an Œ±2Œ≤2Œ±3 secondary structure, a structure which is very different from the Œ≤-sandwich structure of IIAGlc. Further, the IIC domains of the mannitol and fructose porters are as dissimilar from each other as they are from the glucose or lactose families.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. At the time of its nomination it contained 183 resources, which included 120 contributing buildings, one contributing structure, and 62 non-contributing buildings. The historic district is a residential area west of the Cedar River and south of a commercial area. It was home to middle-to-working-class families and a few business and professional people. Most of the primary resources in the district are houses, and the secondary resources are either carriage houses, garages, or city barns. The primary resources that are not residential include First Baptist Church (1901), the Farmers Exchange Produce Building, the Farmers Exchange Office Building (1935), and St. Andrew's Episcopal Church (1958). The contributing structure is St. Andrew's bell tower. The Congregational Church (1868; no longer extant) was also located here until it was torn down. All but three houses contribute to the historical significance of the district, but a majority of the secondary resources do not. The houses range in size from single-story cottages to two-story front-gable-and-wing houses and two-story hipped-roof houses. They include a variety of the late 19th century and early 20th century architectural styles, with the Queen Anne and American Craftsman styles dominating the district. Most of the houses are of frame construction, but there are examples of brick and stucco construction as well. Most of the house construction took place between 1880 and 1940. The oldest houses are located on the east side of the district near the river. The secondary buildings date from around 1890 to 2010. Some of the houses were commissioned from regional architects, but for the most part their designs were derived from pattern books.

Under the moniker Dizi, Dirk Zimmer had a brief career as a painter during the German avant- garde movement and then turned to filmmaking, which he eventually dropped in the late 1970s to work as an illustrator for such American publications as Crawdaddy, the New York Times, and The New-York Magazine. Over the years, both his paintings and illustrations, were shown in private galleries in New York, Germany, Switzerland, and France. =The American period= His work as a children's book illustrator began after moving permanently to New York City in 1977. He also continued to exhibit his artwork and to be a presence in the New York art scene. He found a flat in John Street, right under the roof, for a lengthy period of time. The only media contact to his homeland was through the German Boa Vista magazine, in which he first published vignettes,Cf. Boa Vista 5. Zeitschrift f√ºr Neue Literatur.

In 1990, he was one of a small group of illustrators‚Äîincluding Natalie Babbitt, Maurice Sendak, Marc Simont and Barbara Cooney‚Äîwhose work was featured in The Big Book for Peace (Dutton, 1990), an anthology of 34 artists and writers. =Car accident and death= In Tivoli, on a walk to the river on the afternoon of September 21, 2008, Zimmer was struck by a car.

He attended school in Solothurn and entered the novitiate of the Capuchin Order on 17 September 1821.  Priesthood  In 1822 he professed his vows and was ordained a priest on September 24, 1825. After ordination, he worked as a chaplain in Luzern, then as novice master and teacher of theology at Fribourg until 1830. In 1839, he was sent to Solothurn to teach philosophy. During his teaching days, he started to feel a strong desire to go to the overseas missions. Permission was granted him to go as a missionary only after much hesitation from his superiors. In September 1841, Hartmann left Switzerland and traveled to Rome on foot. In 1843, he was chosen to go with the Mission to Agra in India. After five months, he was reassigned to head the mission station in the town of Gwalior, in what is now Madhya Pradesh.

More has been written about Billy the Kid than any other gunslinger in the history of the American West, while hundreds of books, motion pictures, radio and television programs and even a ballet have been inspired by his legend. When he was still alive, \\"Billy the Kid\\" had already become a nationally known figure whose exploits, real and imaginary, were reported in the National Police Gazette and the large newspapers of the eastern United States. After his death on July 14, 1881, all of New York City's papers ran his obituary, and within days, newspapers around the United States were printing exaggerated and romanticized accounts of Billy the Kid's short career. In the fifteen or so dime novels about his criminal career published between 1881 and 1906, the Kid was an outlaw antihero, customarily depicted as a badman with superior gunslinging skills, or even as a demonic agent of Satan who delighted in murder. Beginning of the legend Garrett's \\"The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid\\" was published in 1882 Within six weeks of Bonney's death there appeared the first complete narrative of his life, The True Life of Billy the Kid. Written by dime novelist John Woodruff Lewis under the pen name \\"Don Jenardo\\", this pulp novel depicted Billy the Kid as a sadistic psychopath. Pat Garrett, smarting from local outrage over his shooting of the Kid, wanted to present his side of the story and hoped to turn a profit as well on the American public's fascination with the notorious outlaw. Consequently, he published his account of Bonney's life, The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid, in 1882. It was credited to Garrett, but the first fifteen chapters were a concoction of factual material mixed with fabrications, written by Roswell's postmaster, Ash Upson, an itinerant journalist. The remaining chapters, written in a more restrained style, are generally accurate, and were likely composed by Garrett himself. The book failed to find a wide audience and sold just a few copies; nevertheless, although filled with many errors of fact, The Authentic Life served afterwards as the main source for most books written about the Kid until the 1960s. Thus was established the mythic stature of Pat Garrett as the heroic lawman in pursuit of the villainous but romantic desperado, Billy the Kid. The lawman and former ranch hand Charlie Siringo first told his version of the Kid's story in a chapter of his book, \\"A Texas Cowboy\\" (1885). During his youth, Siringo had ridden the range in eastern New Mexico and the Texas Panhandle, the familiar haunts of William Bonney and Pat Garrett, and knew both of them. In 1920, he published a sympathetic biography, History of Billy the Kid, in which he described the daily life of a cowboy realistically, but romanticized his account of Bonney with fantasies and exaggerations‚Äîits title page claimed \\"His six years of daring outlawry has never been equalled in the annals of criminal history.\\" Three governors of New Mexico wrote accounts of their dealings with Billy the Kid. Miguel Antonio Otero, the first governor of the territory, knew William Bonney, and was the first Mexican-American author to write about him. Otero's book, The Real Billy the Kid: With New Light on the Lincoln County War, was published in 1936. In it, he wrote admiringly of Bonney and described events of the time and place from the perspective of native New Mexicans. The Kid spoke Spanish fluently and was well-liked by the Hispanos of the Pecos River Valley, who told many stories about el Chivato, their colloquial Spanish for a young goat or kid. =Emerging symbol of the Old West= The modern legend of Billy the Kid as an immortal figure of the Old West first developed within a larger cultural context of social upheaval in the late 19th and early 20th century United States. Between 1897 and 1909, during the Progressive era of political activism and reform, the popular American novelist Emerson Hough wrote magazine articles, novels and informal histories that reintroduced Billy the Kid to a national audience, albeit in works that often relied more on fantasy than on actual events. Hough embellished the Kid's reputation with lurid descriptions of his exceptional villainy in an article called \\"Billy the Kid: The True Story of a Western 'Bad Man' \\", written in 1901 for the literary publication, Everybody's Magazine, using language such as \\"the soul of some fierce and far-off carnivor got into the body of this little man, this boy, this fiend in tight boots and a broad hat.\\" Hough further developed this image of the Kid in his book about western desperados, The Story of the Outlaw (1907), though not in such excessive language. By the mid-1920s, however, Bonney's place in the general awareness of the American public had diminished to the point that in 1925 Harvey Fergusson asked in the American Mercury magazine, \\"Who remembers Billy the Kid?\\". His reputation was revitalized the next year when Walter Noble Burns's book, The Saga of Billy the Kid, appeared as the Book-of-the-Month Club selection for December 1926, and became a bestseller. This success, and the fact that people who had actually known William Bonney were beginning to talk to reporters and write their memoirs, allowed stories of his exploits to regain a nationwide audience. Publication of \\"The Saga\\", in spite of its dubious facts and fabricated events, subsequently led to a proliferation of other books, magazines and newspaper articles, and then to movies, about the life of Billy the Kid. Depictions of Billy the Kid in popular culture fluctuated between the poles of cold-blooded murderer without a heart and sentimental hero fighting for justice. Kent Ladd Steckmesser wrote: \\"There are two Billy the Kids in legend. The first is a tough little thug, a coward, a thief, and a cold-blooded murderer. The second is a romantic and sentimental hero, the brave and likeable leader of an outnumbered band fighting for justice.\\" Both facets of his legend were perpetuated in often poorly researched biographies, as well as in fictionalized B movies, many of which were nonetheless commercially successful. The dramatic aspects of William Bonney's short life and violent death still appealed to popular taste, as they had in the heyday of the dime novels, but eventually an idealized image of Billy the Kid, as one who defends the underdog and fights against social injustice, came to the fore. The Texas historian, J. Frank Dobie, wrote in A Vaquero of the Brush Country (1929): \\"...because his daring apotheosized youth‚Äîyouth in the saddle‚Äîyouth with a flaming gun‚Äîand because his daring kept him running and balancing on the edge of a frightful precipice...Billy the Kid will always be interesting, will always appeal to the popular imagination.\\" =Billy the Kid in film and on stage= With the publication in 1926 of Walter Noble Burns's book,\\"The Saga of Billy the Kid\\", the Kid's legend revived and was consolidated as a standard tale of the American Old West. The American movie director King Vidor, who had wanted to film a Western-themed movie for some time, was inspired when he read Burns's book, and felt that the Kid's story had considerable dramatic appeal. Following the commercial success of the first movie he directed for the Metro Goldwyn Mayer studio, The Big Parade (1925), he was able to obtain backing for a Billy the Kid production when Irving Thalberg, an executive at MGM, took an interest in his proposal. Billy the Kid, the first talking picture version of the legend, was released in 1930. The film featured former college football star Johnny Mack Brown in the title role and Hollywood character actor Wallace Beery as Pat Garrett, but it was a box office failure. Nevertheless, Vidor's Billy the Kid set the pattern for Billy the Kid movies for the next fifty years, as other filmmakers followed its formula and made the Kid an instrument of justified vengeance and his enemies the villains of the story. As Billy the Kid was reborn a romantic or tragic figure in literature and films of the 1920s‚Äì1940s; high culture began to turn its attention to his legend in the late 1930s. Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder with George Balanchine of the School of American Ballet, drew material from Burns' book to write the libretto for a ballet to be called Billy the Kid, performed by his new group, the Ballet Caravan. Composer Aaron Copland was commissioned to score the music, and Eugene Loring to do the choreography. The ballet premiered at the Chicago Civic Opera House on October 16, 1938, and has since become a repertory standard. Copland arranged the score for a concert suite that was performed and recorded in 1959 by Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic Orchestra; the recording was released by Columbia Records in 1960. The Outlaw, starring Jack Buetel as Billy the Kid, Walter Huston as Doc Holliday, and Jane Russell in her first movie role, was produced by Howard Hughes and finished in 1941, though not released until 1943. The film, directed for the most part by Howard Hawks (Hughes got the screen credit), was promoted in a publicity campaign with posters featuring Russell posing in dishabille and her cleavage prominently displayed. Its emphasis on Jane Russell's physical attributes led to the film being dubbed the first \\"sex western\\". Although the movie was generally panned by movie critics, it was rereleased twice over the course of the next decade, grossing more than $20 million and solidifying the legend of Billy the Kid (although a distorted and unhistorical one) in the consciousness of the American filmgoing public. The film director Sam Peckinpah attempted an ambitious retelling of the legend in his last western film, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973), covering the last few months of Bonney's life, in which the violence and physical brutality of the world the protagonists inhabited is portrayed realistically. The film suffered from production difficulties as well as from Peckinpah's battles with MGM over his artistic vision and budget overruns. The studio's drastically cut release version, disowned by Peckinpah, was initially a failure with major critics and the viewing public. Although its depiction of the Kid as a roguish anarchist opposed to illegitimate law (as enforced by Garrett on behalf of a corrupt power structure) was suited to the temper of the times, it quickly left first-run theaters. Soon, however, reviews began to appear in smaller film magazines and journals in the United States and abroad that praised its artistry and breadth of vision. The film's reputation was on the ascendancy long before Peckinpah's preferred cut of the preview version was finally shown at the University of Southern California in 1986, and its critical stature has continued to increase since‚ÄîMartin Scorsese, e.g., called it a \\"masterpiece\\". Despite the liberties it took with history, scholar and film editor Paul Seydor described Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid as among the finest treatments of the legend in any medium. Billy the Kid as cultural icon The psychoanalyst Alfred Adler wrote an analysis in 1951 of the mythic aspects of the legend of Billy the Kid in which he compared the Kid to Oedipus, King Arthur, Robin Hood, and other legendary heroes of the past. Adler was the first writer to discuss the symbolic significance of Billy the Kid's nickname as a cultural totem. Arthur Penn's film, The Left Handed Gun (1958), portrays Billy the Kid as a misunderstood youth, played by Paul Newman in the manner of James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause, according to the film critic Robert Kolker. It similarly addresses the psychological motivations of those of its characters who resort to violence, in a pseudo- Freudian treatment of the subject characteristic of certain 1950s movies. In 1941 Life magazine ran a piece on Billy the Kid called America's Best-Loved Badman. The historian Stephen Tatum, writing forty years later, referred to the contradictory aspects of the mythical Billy the Kid, calling him a \\"flexible container\\" into which audiences poured their \\"hopes and fears, ideals and prejudices.\\" Writers and filmmakers have often depicted William Bonney as the personification of the \\"free-running reprobate\\" of the Old West, of the sort whom the reformed outlaw Emmett Dalton wondered if \\"he symbolizes the undying anarchy in the heart of every man.\\" In any case, the mythical Billy the Kid remains an icon of popular American culture, and the skinny, bucktoothed kid from New York City occupies the top place in Western American folklore. The mythologizing continues with new works in various media.

On the way back, Lao Dao is captured due to the lack of an identification of the first class, but rescued by Ge, a security official who was born in the third class. Lao Dao accidentally finds that the whole waste processing industry, the main economic pillar of the third world, can be easily replaced by technology - and it is only kept in order to provide jobs for those third class people. After dropping the response letter to Qin in the second class, Lao Dao comes back to the third class with newly made money, and continues his life.

It was home to working-class families, merchants, professionals, Wartburg College faculty and staff, and retired farmers. Many of the people who settled here were German immigrants. St. Paul's Lutheran Church (1908) is located in the district. Most of the houses were built using architectural styles popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The district has several concrete block houses that were built after 1907. The concrete block manufacturer/contractor lived in the neighborhood and his factory was just outside of the district. Some of the houses were commissioned from regional architects, but for the most part their designs were derived from pattern books.

Personal life Andr√© Tridon Jagendorf was born on October 21, 1926 in New York City to Moritz Adolph Jagendorf and Sophie Sheba (Sokolsky) Jagendorf. He married Jean Elizabeth Whitenack on June 12, 1952. They had three children Suzanne, Judith and Daniel (deceased January 2014); 8 grandchildren; and 9 great grandchildren. Andr√© Jagendorf died on March 13, 2017. University life Andre Jagendorf performing an experiment on leaf growth on October 31, 2016 Andr√© Jagendorf graduated from Cornell University where he was strongly influenced by Loren Petry who taught General Botany. He earned his PhD in 1951 at Yale University under David Bonner. Andr√© then went to UCLA, where he was awarded a Merck Postdoctoral fellowship and spent what he called \\"the happiest years of my life\\" working with Sam Wildman. Jagendorf became an Assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University in 1953, as Associate professor in 1958, and a Full professor in 1966. Jagendorf then returned to Cornell University as Professor of Plant Physiology, and in 1981 became the Liberty Hyde Baily Professor. Since 1997 Jagendorf has been the Liberty Hyde Bailey Professor Emeritus in the Department of Plant Biology and was actively doing research until days before his death. Research Jagendorf heard Peter Mitchell give a talk about chemiosmosis at a bioenergetics meeting in Sweden. According to Jagendorf, \\"His words went into one of my ears and out the other, leaving me feeling annoyed they had allowed such a ridiculous and incomprehensible speaker in. But ‚Äì Geoffrey [Hind] read Nature. Geoffrey was from England, both better trained and more intelligent than I was. He read Peter Mitchell‚Äôs paper, came to me, and said ‚ÄòAndr√©, could this possibly explain XE [something that preceded ATP formation]?‚Äô\\" As a result of this conversation, Jagendorf began to communicate with Peter Mitchell who invited him to visit his lab so that he could learn about the chemiosmotic hypothesis. Later that summer Jagendorf did the experimentum crucis that showed that the synthesis of adenosine trisphosphate by chloroplasts depended on the magnitude of the pH difference. The experiment consisted of creating a pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts in the dark. Jagendorf and Uribe created the transient pH gradient by incubating chloroplasts in a pH 4 buffer for 15 seconds. They then placed the chloroplasts in a pH 8 buffer that contained ADP and Pi. Under these conditions, the pH of the stroma increased to 8, whereas the pH of the thylakoid lumen remained at 4. An immediate increase in ATP synthesis accompanied the dissipation of the pH gradient across the thylakoid membrane. According to Berg et al. \\"This incisive experiment was one of the first to unequivocally support the hypothesis put forth by Peter Mitchell that ATP synthesis is driven by proton-motive force.\\" Following Jagendorf's results, Mitchell wrote a letter to Edward C. Slater on November 2, 1965, stating: \\"experiments have been steadily pushing me towards accepting the chemiosmotic hypothesis and I think I shall feel inclined presently to regard it as a theory.\\" Jagendorf was also a pioneer in many aspects of chloroplast molecular biology, including DNA repair mechanisms. Honors and awards Jagendorf became the President of the American Society of Plant Physiologists in 1967. He received the Charles F. Kettering Award of the American Society of Plant Physiologists in 1978. Jagendorf was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1980. Jagendorf received the Charles Reid Barnes Life Membership Award of the American Society of Plant Physiologists in 1989 and received the 2012 Rebeiz Foundation for Basic Research Life Time Achievement Award for his contributions to the understanding of ATP Biosynthesis.

The offensive  = Rebels advance = The operation began on 29 August, with two Jund al-Aqsa suicide car bombings against Syrian Army checkpoints near the village of al- Lataminah. Fierce fighting ensued, after which, the rebels managed to swiftly capture several villages. The local pro-government National Defense Forces militia were sent into a sudden and uncoordinated retreat, which lead to the rebels capturing the town of Halfaya. Over the next 24 hours, the Syrian Air Force conducted 52 airstrikes, which killed at least 20 rebels, and soon after the Army managed to temporarily recapture one village, before they were pushed back once again. By the evening of 30 August, the rebels also managed to seize the town of Taybat al-Imam, as well as two other nearby villages. The next day, the rebels managed to enter the town of Suran, but were subsequently pushed back after failing to capture the town's center. However, four hours later, a second rebel attack was launched which ultimately ended in the rebel capture of Suran. Afterwards, the rebel forces led by Jund al-Aqsa began an attack on the Alawite village of Ma‚Äôan, claiming to already have captured a small barrier to the settlement's north and 4 checkpoints to the east. On 1 September, the rebels seized the town of Maardis, as well as a nearby village. During their advances at Maardis, the rebels had seized a missile base that was being prepared by Russian forces for use.Jund al-Aqsa and the factions control the first line of defense of Qamhana and Missile Battalion near Maardis in Hama's countryside Over the next four days, several unsuccessful Army counter-attacks were conducted in an attempt to recapture the town. At the same time elsewhere, rebel attacks on the villages of Ma‚Äôan, Kawkab and Jubbayn, were repelled by government troops. On 2 September, a low-flying A√©rospatiale Gazelle in the area was destroyed mid-air by a Jaish al-Izza BGM-71 TOW missile. The next day, the Syrian Army temporarily recaptured Samam Hill, before losing it again later in the day. Two days later, government forces captured two hills overlooking the town of Qamhana, and forced the rebels to retreat from the town's outskirts. = Army counter-attack, new rebel advance and stalemate = On 6 September, the Syrian Army repelled rebel assaults on Ma‚Äôan and the neighboring Karah village. In the process, Syrian Army units recaptured the village of Btaysh. On 7 September, the Syrian Army and NDF units launched a new attack against Maardis and Taybat Al-Imam, clearing the area around Kawkab, and recaptured three villages by 9 September. On 11 September, following a suicide attack against Army positions, the rebels captured Kawkab. On 13‚Äì14 September, rebel forces launched several attacks near Maardis and Ma'an and took control of a number of checkpoints, though their assaults on the towns themselves were reportedly repelled by the government. As of 15 September, following the gains made in the previous two weeks, the rebels were preparing to start the second phase of their offensive to reach Hama city. At the same time, government forces were mobilizing for a counter-attack to regain all territory they had lost. = Further rebel gains = The Army launched its counter-attack on 21 September, and advanced, capturing a hilltop and several farms on the eastern edge of Maardis. The rebels claimed to had destroyed four Army tanks during the fighting and that they captured and executed 20 soldiers. The next day, the military seized several farms near Maardis. However, on 23 September, rebel forces reversed all government gains during a counter-attack, while there were conflicting reports on who controlled the village of Iskandariah. On the same day, Russian warplanes bombed a rebel headquarters in cave in Taybat al-Imam, killing 22 rebel fighters from the Free Idlib Army.Warplanes target a \\"cave\\" headquarters of a rebel faction, 22 fighters killed near Qamhana in Hama's countryside On 24 September, the rebels captured Ma‚Äôan and al-Kabariyyah after a short battle.Jund al-Aqsa and factions advance and control Maan and al-Kabariyyah in the northeastern countryside of Hama The Syrian Army subsequently launched a small-scale counter-attack, reentering al-Kabariyyah. On 27 September, the rebels once again advanced and captured six more villages. On 28 September, according to the Syrian Army, Jund al-Aqsa used chemical weapons against pro- government defenders as the group attacked and captured Karah. In response to the rebel's advances, several pro-government units were sent as reinforcements to Hama province and soon after government forces announced a new counter- offensive. By 29 September, the rebels had seized 42 towns, villages and hills. Meanwhile, the rebel group Ahrar Darayya (originating from Darayya) merged with Jaysh al-Nasr and joined the battle in northern Hama. On 6 October, it was reported that Fuad al-Salah, the prominent leader of the 'Leopard Militia', was killed in northern Hama. = Army counter-attack and government regains ground = On 8 October, taking advantage of rebel- infighting in the nearby Idlib province, the Army launched a counter-attack and recaptured 10 villages (including Qarah), several hills,The regime forces continue to expand their control area and restore areas they lost since the end of August two checkpoints and an airfield. The military continued to advance towards other nearby villages, specifically Ma'an, while a Russian air-strike directly hit a small convoy leaving Kawkab. On 9 October, the Army recaptured two more villages (Ma'an and Kubbariyah), as well as parts of Kawkab.The regime forces continue advancing in the countryside of Hama and regain control of two villages in the area Renewed fighting for Ma'an took place later that night, and by the next day both villages were again rebel- held.Factions in the northeastern countryside of Hama re-advance and regain 2 important areas from the regime forces Subsequently, government troops launched a new assault on Ma'an, and the town, along with nearby Kawkab, was heavily hit by air-strikes.

She was elected to the board and served as a vice president to Church Women United in the 1970s. Chupco was also the co-founder of the Tulsa Indian Center. She was one of the first women to serve on the Muscogee Nation National Council when it was reorganized in the 1970s and served for twenty-three years as a councilwoman. In 1992, she was recognized by the Oklahoma State Senate for her tribal leadership. Early life Helen Louise Palmer was born on March 10, 1919, in Holdenville, Oklahoma to Bessie (n√©e McCosar) and Billy Palmer. She was one of seven children, including three brothers, Louis, Houston and Kenneth, as well as three sisters Martha, Lucy, and Betty. Her mother was Muscogee and her father was Seminole. Palmer grew up participating in both tribal communities, and learned the Muscogee language. When she began attending public school, she learned English by having an interpreter help her, as the classes were taught solely in English. After completing her primary education in a rural school near Holdenville, Palmer was sent to further her education at Chilocco Indian School and then returned to complete her secondary schooling at Holdenville High School. After graduation, she enrolled in Hills Business University in Oklahoma City. Career By the early 1950s, Palmer had married Rev. Lee Chupco and was speaking on behalf of the Methodist church of the work that she and her husband did among Oklahoma's Indian tribes. Rev. Chupco was the superintendent of the central district for Indian Missions and both he and his wife traveled the country on speaking engagements. In 1950, Chupco was elected to serve as president of the Women's Society of Christian Service for the United Methodist Church's Oklahoma Indian Mission. She held the office until 1954 and then was re-elected to the post in 1958, serving through 1960. Chupco was one of the co-founders of the Tulsa Indian Center, which was created with funds from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare as a counseling center to assist Native American peoples in making the adjustment to living in urban environments. In 1970, Chupco was one of the members of a watchdog committee appointed by the Oklahoma Indian Rights Association to monitor civil rights violations of Native Americans in the state. She was elected to the board of Church Women United in 1971, as one of twelve vice presidents and one of only four Native American members. The three-year term was historic as it was the first time an African American woman had been elected to the presidency. When the Muscogee (Creek) Nation re-established its government in the 1970s, Chupco was selected as one of the first women to serve on the Muscogee National Council. She served for twenty-three years, as a tribal councilwoman. In 1984, Chupco was elected as treasurer of the Oklahoma Federation of Indian Women. In 1992, Chupco was recognized by the Oklahoma State Senate for her tribal leadership. Death and legacy Chupco died April 28, 2004 in Muskogee, Oklahoma and was buried in Holdenville. An annual leadership award was named in her honor by the Oklahoma Federation of Indian Women and is granted to someone who has performed outstanding leadership on behalf of their tribe.

Early and personal life Croes was born on Aruba on 10 May 1946. He studied law at Leiden University and the Katholieke Hogeschool Tilburg in the Netherlands. Croes started working as a civil servant in 1975. He later became head of the department of the governmental structure of the Netherlands Antilles, as which he served until 1980. Croes subsequently was scientific employee at the University of the Netherlands Antilles from 1980 to 1982. In May 2006 he earned his degree in jurisprudence from Tilburg University under Ernst Hirsch Ballin, with a dissertation titled:\\"De herdefini√´ring van het Koninkrijk\\". Croes was a Knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion. He also held a distinction in the Venezuelan Order of Francisco de Miranda. Croes died on 7 August 2016 in Oranjestad, Aruba, aged 70.Mito Croes passes away Political career Croes started his political career for the Aruban People's Party as a member of the Island Council of Aruba. From early to November 1982 Croes served as member of the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles. He subsequently became Minister of Political Structure of the Netherlands Antilles and also temporarily served as Minister of Justice until August 1983. Croes then returned to the Estates of the Netherlands Antilles, of which he stayed member until 1986, when Aruba gained its status as a constituent country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Croes subsequently was appointed as the country's first Minister for Welfare Affairs (Education, Culture, Employment and Social Affairs). Croes remained Minister until February 1989. He then became member of the Estates of Aruba. Croes remained member until September 1994 when he was appointed as Minister Plenipotentiary of Aruba. He kept this position until October 2001.

A single PTS permease of the L-Asc family of PTS permeases has been functionally characterized. This is the SgaTBA system, renamed UlaABC (utilization of L-ascorbate) by Yew and Gerlt.  The SgaTBA System  The SgaTBA permease consists of three proteins: SgaT, SgaB, and SgaA. SgaT is a 12 TMS protein, possibly very distantly related to the MFS hexuronate permease of Escherichia coli (TC# 2.A.1.14.2), which presumably functions as a PTS IIC protein. This gene product, as well as SgaB and SgaA, are all essential for anaerobic L-ascorbate utilization, transport and phosphorylation. This is the first documented example where the two sugar-specific energy-coupling proteins of a PTS permease are more closely related to the proteins of two different families. The sga regulation is controlled by the nearby YjfQ repressor.  Homology  Homologues of SgaT, like other PTS protein homologues, have been identified in a large number of evolutionarily divergent bacteria, but not in archaea or eukaryotes. Bacteria that encode SgaT homologues include numerous Gram-negative proteobacteria, as well as many low and high G+C Gram-positive bacteria. Except for species of Corynebacterium, Streptomyces and Bacillus, almost all organisms possessing SgaTBA homologues are human/animal pathogens. Several organisms have two or more SgaT paralogues, including E. coli, which has three. In some of the homologues found in other bacteria, SgaB domains are fused C-terminal to the SgaT domains. For example, this is true of putative transporters in Vibrio cholerae, Pasteurella multocida and Mycoplasma pulmonis. Homologues of SgaB and SgaA, but not SgaT, are also found in transcriptional activator proteins where they function in regulation rather than sugar transport.

Location St. Mary's Abbey is located in the central part of Duleek called the Commons, between Main Street and Church Lane. The Nanny River is to the southwest. History A monastery stood in Duleek from the 5th century. A round tower stood here; it was damaged by lightning in 1147 but survived a few more centuries.http://www.meathheritage.com/index.php/archives/item/me02066-commons- duleek-lower-by-round-tower In 1180 Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath granted Duleek (including St. Patrick's Church) to the Canons Regular. However, the surviving buildings are later: the southern arcade is 13th century, the southern aisle and bell tower are 15th century and the main tower and the east gable with window are 16th century. The abbey was shut down in the 1537 Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Abbey was later used for burials. James Cusack, Catholic Bishop of Meath 1679‚Äì88, was buried in an effigial tomb. Also buried here is John Bellew, 1st Baron Bellew of Duleek who died of wounds received at the Battle of Aughrim. Saint Kienan's, a Church of Ireland church, was built next to the old abbey in 1816. Buildings All that remains is the south aisle and the tower. The tower survives with four stories with quoins, battered walls, battlements, aumbry and stairs turret. The east window (bearing the arms of Sir John Bellew and Dame Ismay Nugent beneath it) is a 1587 post- Gothic replacement. In the north wall of the medieval belfry is the scar or shadow of a round tower.

Rumors of the McLaren dated back to November 2013. At this point, the phone was actually originally codenamed \\"Goldfinger\\", but the name was changed to McLaren later during development. McLaren was eventually cancelled in July 2014, merely four months before its supposed launch in the November of that year. Had the phone not been cancelled, Lumia McLaren could officially launched as successor for Lumia 1020. The cancellation left Lumia 1020 have no direct successor and no new Lumia flagship until October 2015. Lumia 1020 only get the \\"spiritual successor\\" in February 2019 with the launch of Nokia 9 PureView.  Hardware  The final prototypes of the McLaren featured a grey metal body with a polycarbonate strip along the bottom, likely for radio transparency for the antennas. However, apart from grey ones, silver and full black prototypes have also been built. Daniel Rubino of Windows Central described the device as a \\"cross between the Lumia 1020 and the Lumia 925\\". Since the device is a sealed unit, there is a door for the microSD card and the nano SIM. However, in some prototypes with earlier RM-XXXX number, but newer hardware revision number (0151 instead of the 0101 ones that have one door only), there are two separate doors, one for the nanoSIM and one for the storage expansion card. Some RM-XXXX numbers include the RM-1001, RM-1002, RM-1003, RM-1004, RM-1050, RM-1051 and RM-1052.http://allaboutwindowsphone.com/features/item/23573_Days_of_Future_Past- part_3_The.php = Internals = The McLaren featured a 2.3 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 MSM8974 quad-core SoC which also contains an Adreno 330 GPU. This SoC is paired with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal storage, which can be expanded with microSD cards up to 128 GB in size. It also comes with the non-replaceable Microsoft Battery BV-F4A, 2600mAh. = Display = McLaren had a 5.5 in (140 mm) LCD display with a resolution of 1080x1920 (Full HD) and a 16:9 aspect ratio. The pixel density of this display is 401 ppi. It is unknown which protective glass comes with the Lumia 1030 (probably Gorilla Glass 3 or later). Depending on the firmware installed, it also comes with features that were found on other Lumias, like Glance Screen, double tap and super-sensitive touch (use with gloves). The display of McLaren is also reported to incorporate projected-capacitive touch technology, which enables the software- driven \\"3D Touch\\" features, including the ability to hover over tiles on the Start screen to expand their contents. = Camera = The McLaren features a PureView-branded rear-facing camera with a resolution of somewhere within the 20 MP range. The in-built camera software, just like on the lumia 1020 shoots only in PureView mode (5-8MP range), with only few settings. However, with the Lumia Camera, the maximum resolution goes up to about 19-20MP (4:3), with the possibility to capture double images as well, like on the lumia 1020 (5MP PureView jpeg + full resolution jpeg or 5MP jpeg + full resolution dng, which is RAW image). Like the Lumia 1020, McLaren also had a large camera \\"hump\\", which contained Microsoft's propriety optical image stabilization hardware (this hardware was later reduced in size for the Lumia 950 and the Lumia 950 XL).  Software  The Lumia McLaren would have originally been released with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 1 with the later potential to upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile. However, due to the 3D Touch technology and software that was incorporated into McLaren, this is unlikely to be ever feasible. = 3D Touch = One of McLaren's reputed \\"killer\\" features was a technology known as \\"3D Touch\\" that allowed the user to interact with the phone using gestures. Sensors contained within the device's body and screen enabled new interactions, which mainly centred around the user hovering their finger over the display in order to reveal certain contextual menus or other additional functions. On the Start screen, 3D Touch allows the user to hover their finger over a live tile and for that tile to \\"explode\\" revealing many smaller tiles contained within ‚Äì this feature was dubbed MixView. On the near-final prototype hardware, MixView worked with very few apps (only the stock Phone app and Internet Explorer), but the original idea was to allow for developers to make use of exploding live tiles in their own apps. Other 3D Touch features include the ability to: * keep the screen of the phone on whilst the user is holding the device * lock the rotation of the screen if the phone is held in a certain way * silence incoming calls by gripping the phone or waving a hand over the display * answer incoming calls by also waving a hand * mute the speakerphone by holding a hand over the lower half of the display (where the in-built microphone is located) * display additional UI elements only when a finger is close to the respective area of the display * adapt the user interface depending on how the user holds the device * provide gesture-based controls for games  References  Microsoft hardware Nokia mobile phones Smartphones ","title":"Nokia Lumia McLaren"},{"id":"51468132","text":"This is a list of monuments in Kerƒãem, Gozo, Malta, which are listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands.

After education at Haileybury College, Douglas studied medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital and received there in 1896 M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P. (Lond.). He joined the Indian Medical Service on 28 January 1898 with the rank of second-lieutenant. All Indian Medical Service officers at that time were required to complete a course in pathology at Netley Hospital under Dr (later Sir) Almroth Wright. In 1899 Wright requested that Douglas accompany him to India for the investigative research of the first Plague Commission. On 31 March 1899 Douglas and H. J. Walton (at that time a lieutenant) were sent to investigate plague in the Garhwal District and other areas of the Kumaon Division of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh. Their investigation lasted about 5 months, during which Douglas suffered from recurring episodes of malaria. After completing this investigation, Douglas was sent in 1900 to China as part of the medical staff for the Gaselee Expedition in connection with the Boxer Rebellion. In China he was promoted to the rank of captain on 28 January 1901. However, in China he became infected with amoebic dysentery and developed a liver abscess. (From 1901 to the end of his life he suffered serious health problems.) He was given a medical discharge from the Indian Medical Service. Douglas returned to the UK and joined Almroth Wright at St Mary's Hospital to do research on vaccine therapy. For a pension from the Indian Medical Service, Douglas was put on temporary half pay on 15 September 1905 and was put on permanent half pay on 15 September 1907. In 1909 he was appointed a lecturer at St Mary's Hospital Medical School. When World War I started, the supply of peptones from Germany was cut off. Peptones were used by British bacteriologists in nutrient media for growing Salmonella typhi as part of the programme for preparing vaccines against typhoid fever. Within a few days, Douglas produced a new and superior peptone medium for bacterial culture. He joined Wright in Boulogne-sur-Mer but developed sciatica and returned to the UK for treatment. In 1915 he returned to work at St Mary's on vaccines against typhoid and other bacterial infections. Douglas also did research on dysentery. In 1916 he worked in St Mary Hospital's special wards for wounded soldiers and developed a successful method of autologous skin-grafting. In 1921 Douglas was appointed director of the Department of Bacteriology and Experimental Pathology in the National Institute for Medical Research under the direction of Sir Henry Dale at Mount Vernon Hospital in Hampstead and also deputy director for the NIMR under the director Dale. As head of his department, Douglas organised the research of Laidlaw, Dobell, William E. Gye (who worked on the Rous sarcoma virus), Ian A. Galloway (who worked on foot- and-mouth disease) and other researchers. Much of the research dealt with immunology and virology, especially viruses that cause dysentery. Douglas worked on the extraction of bacteria by acetone. This extraction method led to Georges Dreyer's 'diaplyte' and Dreyer's synthetic medium for the growth of tubercle bacilli; Dreyer's advances lead to a more effective form of tuberculin skin test.Munk's Roll Details for Stewart Ranken Douglas, Lives of the Fellows, Royal College of Physicians In Kensington in 1920 Douglas married Frances Miriam Clare Nias n√©e Dayrell. She was born in 1872 and married in 1896 the physician Joseph Baldwin Nias (1856‚Äì1919), whose father was Admiral Sir Joseph Nias (1793‚Äì1879). By his marriage, S. R.

Location and natural features Brunton Bank Quarry is situated in the south-west of the county of Northumberland, some south-west of Chollerford and north of Hexham. The site at High Brunton lies to the north of the B6318 road and Hadrian's Wall, which runs immediately south of the road; it is north of Turret 26A. The quarry's elevation is between and above sea level. Brunton Bank Quarry is one of a number of SSSIs which expose the Namurian Great Limestone; others include Sleightholme Beck Gorge ‚Äì The Troughs and West Rigg Open Cutting, both to the south of this site, in County Durham. An ancient tumulus is noted within the boundary of the site. Geology Brunton Bank Quarry is identified as an important geological site in the UK's Geological Conservation Review, for its stratigraphic and palaeontological characteristics. It provides an excellent exposure of the reef-like biostromic Chaetetes Band of the Namurian Great Limestone, the affinities of the flora of which is a subject of contemporary study: the quarry constitutes a leading site for such studies. The site is the sole location of one eponymous fossil species Calcifolium bruntonense. The condition of Brunton Bank Quarry was judged to be favourable in a 2013 inspection, which noted recent scrub clearance.

The cornerstone for the present church was laid on November 3, 1957. It is a Modern A-frame brick structure that is ten bays long. The bays project at an angle. Each has a window in the angle and an I-beam that serves as a buttress. On the interior, the I-beams are clad in a wood veneer. The short side walls are covered with brick laid in a stack bond. The brick on the west gabled end is laid in Flemish bond and features a series of small raised crosses in the brick pattern work. The east gable end was remodeled around 2006 and is composed of a combination of brick and synthetic metal siding. It has a large Celtic cross with windows that extend to the peak. A spire, divided into five sections, and a Celtic cross caps the steeply pitched roof. The Hemingway Memorial Bell Tower was completed in 1963.

He has been the Labor member for Port Darwin in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly since 2016. Early life and career Kirby was the Northern Territory Organiser for the Electrical Trades Union of Australia Queensland and NT Branch before entering politics. Politics Kirby was preselected as the Labor candidate for Port Darwin ahead of the 2016 Territory election. The seat's incumbent, John Elferink of the Country Liberal Party, was retiring. Port Darwin had historically been a CLP stronghold, having been in that party's hands for all but two terms of its entire existence. Labor had only won it once, and only on a knife-edge, during its 2005 landslide. Going into the 2016 election, Port Darwin had a notional CLP majority of 9.7 percent after the redistribution, which would have made it a fairly safe CLP seat under normal circumstances. However, the CLP had been sinking in the polls for some time, particularly in the Darwin area. Additionally, it no longer had the advantage of Elferink's incumbency. On election night, the CLP lost over 19 percent of its primary vote from 2012 amid its near-total meltdown in the capital. This allowed Kirby to take the seat on a swing of 12.5 percent, becoming only the second Labor member ever to win it. He was reelected in 2020, becoming the first Labor MP to win a second term in Port Darwin. Kirby was appointed to the cabinet after the 2020 election with the portfolios of Small Business, Jobs and Training, Corporate and Digital Development, Public Employment, Veterans Affairs and Recreational Fishing.

Biography Born in Paris, he was one of three children of Pierre Marie Joseph Molteni (1811‚Äì1852) and Maria Elisa Clara Houllier, and the grandson of the great optician Antoine Molteni. His family were immigrants to France, from the north of Italy. His uncle Jules Molteno and his grandfather brought him into the family firm at the age of 15, after his father's death. On 21 January 1863, they created the firm \\"J. &. A. Molteni\\" for the manufacture of precision instruments, under the ownership of Alfred Molteni (n¬∞9 de la rue des Petits H√¥tels) and Jules Molteno (n¬∞62 de la rue du Ch√¢teau d‚ÄôEau). Already from 1865 the dynamic Alfred played the most active role, and after Jules died on 25 May 1876, he directed the firm alone. Alfred Molteni authored numerous technical works and papers. His 1878 works on projection went into many editions. He was also responsible for a large range of inventions in the field of optics, projection and related fields. He was president of honour of the \\"Chambre Syndicale de la Photographie\\", recipient of numerous awards and diplomas from around Europe, and knight of the Legion of Honour(Feb. 1898). Under his direction, the Molteni firm shared with Duboscq the dominant position in the European market. It was also the favoured manufacturer of the equipment for many of the greatest scientists of the time. The majority of his time however, was spent designing light projection systems. He created innumerable devices and over 12,000 screenings for conferences and events. In the 1890s, he began working with the Lumi√®re brothers on the equipment for some of the first motion pictures. His downfall occurred at the height of his career. A product he sold (the 1894 oxy√©th√©rique \\"securitas\\" lamp), after initially being a great success in the first cinematograph films of 1897, was involved in a disastrous fire. During the Bazar de la Charit√© event, one of these lamps was brought in for the spectacles. Fatally, during the show, the projectionist pulled open the lamp, to access the ether. At the same time, the assistant leaned over and struck a match. The resulting fire spread and killed 126 people. Molteni was overwhelmed by the catastrophe. Believing his product was responsible, he renounced his career, and handed over his firm to Radiguet and Massiot in 1899. He moved to Tours where he died a few years later. Reconstituted under Radiguet and Massiot, the firm remains the leading French manufacturer of scientific materials.L.

He was beatified in July 1867 by Pope Pius IX.Fros SJ, Henryk \\"Book of names and saints\\", pp. 423‚Äì37, 2007 \\"Martirologio\\", Roman Curia Pontifical Academies  Early life  Ludovicus Sasada was born in Edo, present-day Tokyo, around 1598, to a pious Christian family. His family was befriended by a young missionary friar, Luis Sotelo, from the Franciscan Order.  Father Sotelo  Luis Sotelo tried to establish a Franciscan church in the area of Edo. The church was destroyed in 1612, following the interdiction of Christianity in the territories of the Tokugawa shogunate on 21 April 1612. After a period of intense missionary activity by the Catholic Church, Tokugawa Hidetada, the second sh≈çgun of the Tokugawa dynasty, issued a decree which banned the practice and teaching of the Christian faith, and under the threat of loss of life, all the missionaries had to leave Japan. This decree started the bloody persecution of Christians, which lasted several decades. After the healing of a concubine of the powerful daimy≈ç of Sendai, Date Masamune, in Edo, Sotelo was invited to the northern part of Japan, in the area controlled by Date, under whom Christianity was still allowed. He came back to Tokyo the following year and constructed and inaugurated a new church on 12 May 1613, in the area of Asakusa Torigoe. The Bakufu reacted by arresting the Christians, and Sotelo himself was put in the Kodenma-ch≈ç prison. Seven fellow Japanese Christians, who had been arrested with Sotelo, were executed on 1 July, but he was freed following a special request by Date Masamune. Sotelo, fluent in Japanese, planned and acted as translator on a Japanese embassy sent by Date Masamune to Madrid on 28 October 1613. The embassy was headed by Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga, and crossed the Pacific Ocean to Acapulco on board the Japanese-built galleon San Juan Bautista. The embassy continued to Veracruz and Sanlucar de Barrameda, Seville, and Madrid. Luis had the Japanese receive baptism in Madrid, before accompanying them to an audience with Pope Paul V in Rome. The embassy was a product of ambitions of Sotelo to increase the spread of the church in Japan and of Date Masamune to provide more priests for the churches of his Christian subjects and to establish trade between Sendai and New Spain, and it had the approval of the shogun, Ieyasu Tokugawa.  Seminary and priesthood  Ludovicus Sasada's father, Michael was beheaded on 16 August 1613, as a result of his Christian beliefs. Young Sasada accompanied Sotelo and the representatives of Japan, on their voyage to Europe. He requested to remain in Mexico, while the others proceeded to Madrid, and entered the convent of San Pedro and San Pablo in Valladolid, Michoac√°n, where he became a Franciscan brother and started his studies for the priesthood. Several years later, Sotelo, now Bishop-elect of ≈åsh≈´ (in Northern Honsh≈´), returned to Mexico en route to Japan, where he chose Sasada as his personal secretary. The party returned to Manila in June 1618, where Sasada completed his studies for priesthood, with Sotelo instructing him. Because he was not of canonical age, a special dispensation was obtained and he was ordained a priest in Manila.  Return to Japan and martyrdom  In 1622, Sotelo, Sasada and Ludovicus Baba (personal servant to Father Sotelo), set sail for Japan, disguised as merchants. As the Chinese captain suspected them for religious missionaries, they were surrendered to governmental authorities at Nagasaki. Within six months, these three prisoners were transferred to the new prison at ≈åmura. Their imprisonment almost lasted for two years. Two other missionary priests, Pedro V√°squez OP and Miguel de Carvalho SJ, eventually joined these three Franciscans in captivity. Their life in the ≈åmura prison was like a friary. These priests performed their religious exercises and celebrated Holy Mass. The imprisoned Christians at the risk of their lives procured what was needed. On 24 August, a death sentence was ordered.Borrelli, Antonio \\"Blessed Michael Carvalho, Jesuit martyr\\", 2005-02-22 When they received the news they sang the Te Deum. At ten in the morning, they were taken by boat to the place of execution. They were tied to stakes and a fire was placed around them. Sotelo was placed in the center and the two Japanese were on the outside of the circle. Since the fire burned the ropes of the two Japanese Franciscans, they prostrated themselves towards the center stake and asked for the Bishop- elect's blessing. Sotelo invoked God's blessing upon them and they returned to their stakes until they were overcome by the fire and smoke. After these martyrs died, the soldiers burned their remains in another fire and took their ashes in a boat to throw dispose of them into the sea, to prevent them being carried away by the Christians, even though a witness was able to collect some of Pedro V√°squez's cremains and had them deposited in a Jesuit Church in the Philippines. Sasada was beatified by Pope Pius IX on 7 July 1867. In the Roman Catholic Church, his feast day is celebrated on 25 August, as well as 10 September, the anniversary of the massacre of 205 Japanese martyrs.

History Born in Huntington, NY, and raised in Blairstown, NJ, Shoenfeld moved to Nashville after graduating high school, where he worked as a house musician at Woodland Studios. While working in the studio, Shoenfeld also performed with many different artists in Nashville, and was introduced to Hollywood Records recording artist \\"Big Kenny\\" Alphin. After a brief period of touring in support of Big Kenny‚Äôs solo effort Live a Little, they formed the rock band luvjOi, and it was during this time that Shoenfeld met singer-songwriter John Rich. Simultaneously, the MuzikMafia was born, a music and art collective in which Shoenfeld was a longstanding member and also included Jon Nicholson, Gretchen Wilson, Cowboy Troy and others. Rich began using Shoenfeld as a frequent guitarist in the recording studio, playing on demos of songs like \\"Redneck Woman\\" and \\"Hicktown\\" (penned by Rich and later recorded by Wilson and Aldean, respectively). After Luvjoi disbanded, the country duo Big & Rich was formed by Alphin and Rich and signed to Warner Bros. Records in 2004.

The proposed act, reported TCPalm, \\"would make sugar import quotas more flexible and protect taxpayers from government-funded buyouts of surplus sugar\\".

I am confident this process will be improved.\\" Citing his own Mexican grandparents, he said, \\"The way that they got to work, the way that they assimilated to the American way of life and became a part of our system is not what we're seeing across the board.\\" In June 2018, a volunteer for the Democratic Party of Martin County who was angry about the Trump administration's immigration policy, was arrested after threatening to kill Mast's children.

What's being done now is too little too late. It's going to require an all-out military effort. The only way to guarantee peace is to make the enemy surrender.\\" = Iran nuclear deal = Mast views Obama's Iran nuclear deal as a betrayal by the US of its own national security as well as that of Israel, Jordan, and other regional allies. \\"The deal has aligned us with a Shia regime, which is just enabling extremism. This is going to make it very hard to get Sunni regimes to align with us, and Putin is now the go-to player in Syria with his alliance with Assad,\\" he said in 2016. = Israel = Mast is \\"a vocal supporter of Israel and Israelis\\", reported The Times of Israel during his 2016 campaign. \\"If anyone was lobbing rockets into the US, guys like me would be sent to kill them, and Americans would applaud us,\\" he said. = Military and veterans affairs = Mast, who sits on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, was the first Member of Congress to open an office inside a federal agency.

Criticism  In August 2020, inappropriate Facebook comments made by Mast in 2009 and 2011 came to light, and the politician was moved to apologize for what he called \\"disgusting and inappropriate jokes that I am embarrassed to have associated with my name today\\". Mast's decade-old comments were directed to Mast's friend Rocco LeDonni, who is now Mast's political campaign manager. Mast's 2009 comment was in response to a photo of LeDonni traveling in South Africa, to which Mast said, \\"im so proud of you... i hope you hook up with at least fifteen 15 year olds over there.... its legel there right.\\" Later in 2011, LeDonni had publicly asked, \\"Anyone have any good pick up lines for this weekend considering according to the crazy christian radio guy the world may end on sunday?\\" To which Mast responded, \\"How about don‚Äôt turn this rape into a murder\\". The posts which had stayed public for 11 years were deleted shortly after the media contacted Mast about their contents, but screen shots had been saved. The discovery brought new scrutiny on one of Mast's key initiatives: building support for rape survivors in the military. In Mast's apology, he noted, \\"A decade ago when I was in the Army, and following my injury...\\", but one Republican news editor has called this a \\"lie\\" because Mast's comment about 15-year-old girls was posted to Facebook a year before Mast was injured. On October 13, 2019, Mast posted a Twitter wish for happy birthday to the United States Navy, accompanying an apparent stock photograph of the Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy. It was quickly deleted after being mocked.  Personal life  Mast lives in Palm City, Florida, with his wife Brianna and their four children, Madalyn, Maverick, Magnum, and Major.

Biography Muhammad Shah Qajar and his Vizier Haj Mirza Aghasi, second quarter of the nineteenth century, Ink, opaque watercolor and gold on paper, Iran, collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Aqasi was born and brought up in Maku to a certain Moslem ibn Abbas, a \\"petty\\" Mollah landowner of the city of ƒ™ravƒÅn (Yerevan), then still part of Iran, and a member of the Bayat clan. Mirza Akasi initiated Mohammad Shah into Sufi mysticism, and the two men \\"came to be known as two 'dervishes'.\\"Avery, Modern Iran, p. 30. While he has often been criticized for contributing to the disasters of the reign, it is possible that he was attempting to use Sufism as a weapon against the growing hold of the official representatives of religion, the mullahs, who were opposing both modernization and foreign influence. In foreign affairs, he managed to \\"prevent Iran disintegrating either into autonomous principalities or appanages of Russia, and Britain,\\" and internally he \\"revived the cultivation of the mulberry tree in the Kerman region, to feed silkworms; and he envisaged the diversion of the waters of the River Karaj for Tehran's water- supply.\\"Avery, Modern Iran, pp. 46-7. The failure of Haji Mirza Akasi's countrymen to praise him for his enterprise was partly no doubt due to an equally shrewd appreciation on their part that new economic alignments emerging during his period as Prime Minister were not destined to enrich the people, but only to make a rapacious aristocracy more powerful, while the situation of the cultivator became little better than slavery.Avery, Modern Iran, p. 47.

They were formerly part of private rubber extraction concessions, and continue to be used by the descendants of the original rubber tappers to extract rubber and other forest products. Recently the reserves have been threatened by violence and illegal logging. General The Association of Machadinho Rubber Tappers administers 15 small extractive reserves in the municipalities of Machadinho d'Oeste, Cujubim and Vale do Anari in the state of Rond√¥nia. They are remnants of the former Seringal Santo Ant√¥nio, Seringal S√£o Paulo and Seringal S√£o Gon√ßalo rubber extraction concessions. The main resource extracted from the forest is rubber, as well as nuts and copaiba oil. The reserves are Angelim, Aquariquara, Castanheira, Freij√≥, Garrote, Ip√™, Ita√∫ba, Jatob√°, Maracatiara, Massaranduba, Mogno, Piqui√°, Roxinho, Seringueira and Sucupira. Many of the residents were born in the region, descendants of the \\"rubber soldiers\\" who came to extract rubber for the foreign market in the 1940s. They have adapted their way of life to the environment. Only a few of the reserves have electricity. Latex extraction provides the main source of income. Other activities are growing cassava and making flour, production of bio-jewels, extraction and sale of copaiba and other oils. Some are trying to take advantage of license for sustainable timber harvesting. Production of eco- leather from plant fibre and oils is a promising source of income. In April 2015 members of the association met with the Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development of the state legislature. The committee was told that the members lived in a climate of terrorism in Machadinho, and had been receiving death threats. 16 homicides had been recorded in the past ten years.

On 18 November 1991 the Aquariquara Forest Reserve was closed to settlement, deforestation, professional fishing, logging, mining and other activities that could compromise sustainable use other than the activities of small farmers, rubber tappers and fisherfolk. Aquariquara Extractive Reserve was created by state decree 7.106 of 4 September 1995 with an area of . The purpose was to provide an area for sustainable use and conservation of natural resources by the agro-extractive population. The decree recognised that the great pressures of predatory activities on areas occupied by the traditional people of the forest were causing irreversible loss of plant and wildlife resources, and were exacerbating social conflicts and degrading the quality of life of the forest residents. The reserve created a forest management plan, and began exploiting wood in 1998. Some of the leaders and residents have sold abandoned lots to businesses and farmers from other regions. A 2011 survey of key people involved with the reserve showed that the extractive community did not perceive the significant potential for income generation of sustainable extraction as opposed to traditional methods. In April 2015 members of the association met with the Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development of the state legislature. The committee was told that the members lived in a climate of terrorism and had been receiving death threats. 16 homicides had been recorded in the past ten years. The protected areas were being laid waste with no effort being made by the state government to protect them. Economy The main resource extracted from the forest is rubber, as well as nuts and copaiba oil. In 1994 the Aquariquara Extractive Reserve had 181 residents. According to a 2000 survey there were 91 residents in 27 placements. As of 2011 there were 47 families in 27 placements in the reserve. A 1999 state government report said there was considerable and diversified agricultural production, especially coffee, in Aquariquara. A project to manufacture and market baba√ßu (Attalea speciosa) flour had been started in 1998, with considerable success, with the output sold to schools and stores in Machadinho. However, as of 2011 activities other than latex collection, such as acai production and seed collection, were negligible. Extraction used traditional methods, involving walking long distances to collect the latex. Although there are wide variations, on average each family produced of latex per year. The Rubber Tappers Association buys this output for R$2.00 per kilo. Due to the large effort and low economic value of sustainable rubber extraction, residents turn to other activities such as logging, agriculture and raising livestock. Forest management began in the reserve around 2001, covering about half the area of the reserve. The area is divided into lots, each explored for one year, giving a predicted 20-year cycle. Residents are involved in the forest inventory, identifying trees of each species to be harvested, and help open and demarcate the tracks for forestry. They also supervise the lumber operation and record the amount of wood extracted. An estimate of forestry income payable gave R$8,809 per family in 2010. The actual amount received by families for 2009 varied from zero to R$1,000. However, some residents with jobs with the lumber companies received as much as R$7,000. The method of allocating profits is opaque, and there is little government supervision.

It is intended to replace Superbird-B2 on the 162¬∞ East slot, offering Ku band and Ka band communication services to the Japanese market. It will also serve as one of the two planned X band military satellites of the DSN network, in this role, it will be known as DSN-1 (Kirameki-1). Originally intended to be launched by an Ariane 5 ECA in the second half of fiscal year 2015, a mishap during transport to the launch site in March 2016 meant that it would be delayed up to two years. History JSAT along NEC, NTT Com and Maeda Corporation formed a joint venture called DSN Corporation. On January 15, 2013, DSN Corporation announced that it had closed a contract with the Ministry of Defense to execute the \\"Program to Upgrade and Operate X-Band Satellite Communications Functions, etc\\". The contract is a private finance initiative, where private funds, management and technical capabilities are used to upgrade and operate the Japanese military X band satellite network. Based on this program, DSN Corporation will manufacture and launch two satellites plus perform the necessary upgrades to ground control stations. It will also operate, manage and maintain the facilities and equipment through fiscal years 2015 to 2030. The total program cost was estimated at ¬•122,074,026,613. The plan called for the launch of the first satellite in December 2015, with a start of operations in March 2016 and a termination of operations in April 2030. The second satellite was expected to launch in January 2017, starting operations in March 2017. The program and the operations of the second satellite were expected by March 2031. JSAT role is the procurement and general management of the satellites. The first satellite, DSN-1, is actually an additional payload on one of JSAT's own satellites, Superbird-8. The second satellite, DSN-2 is a dedicated spacecraft. On April 25, 2014 JSAT announced that it had placed an order with MELCO and its satellite platform DS2000 for its Superbird-8 satellite. It would replace Superbird-B2 and be positioned on the 162¬∞ East orbital slot. On an earning revision, JSAT disclosed that they had confirmed container deformation after Superbird-8 arrived to its launch site. In July 2016, it was published that a May 25 mishap during air transport had delayed the satellite launch by an estimated two years. A dislodged tarpaulin had blocked the bleed valve on the satellite container and the spacecraft had suffer from over pressurization damage.

From 1995 until its permanent closure in 2012, the county contracted with the Bobby Ross Group, Correctional Services Corporation, the GEO Group, and other prison operation companies. In its history it housed inmates for a list of state corrections departments (Virginia, Oklahoma, Missouri, Montana, Hawaii, Arizona, Idaho), for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and other agencies.  History  In 1995 the facility was operated by the Bobby Ross Group, and housed 150 male inmates from the Virginia Department of Corrections. From December 1995, about half of the facility's 832 beds were occupied by inmates exported from Hawaii. NCCC housed 435 Hawaiians, 211 Virginians, 134 Oklahomans, one Montanan and five prisoners from the county as of December 1997. A string of fires, riots, escapes, conflicts and legal action throughout 1996 and 1997 caused the Texas Commission on Jail Standards to step in and enforce state standards at the institution in February 1998. In March 1998, Oklahoma pulled out its 134 inmates. In May the Bobby Ross Group was fired and replaced by Correctional Services Corporation. The Hawaii prisoners stayed. In April through June 2006 the facility experienced another set of incidents (allegations of inmate abuse, an escape, the resignation of a deputy warden) related to the movement of about 250 Idaho Department of Correction prisoners into the facility. Idaho prisoners were removed in July. Newton County terminated the contract with GEO Group as of November 9, 2009.

Drafted into the Imperial Russian Army in 1917, Berestov participated in the Russian Revolution. He was drafted into the Red Army, fighting in the Russian Civil War and the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. He became a Red Army officer and served in several positions during the interwar period. Berestov was arrested and released during the Great Purge. He fought in the Winter War as a regimental commander. In the early days after the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he was given command of a People's Militia regiment, which was converted into a regular regiment. Berestov led the regiment in the early period of the Battle of Moscow and transferred to lead a regiment of the 82nd Motor Rifle Division. Berestov became the division's commander and in the spring of 1942 briefly led the 50th Rifle Division. In April, he took command of the 331st Rifle Division, which he led during the rest of the war. For his leadership, Berestov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in late June 1945. Postwar he commanded the 72nd Guards Rifle Division, which was downsized into a brigade, and the 43rd Guards Rifle Brigade, which became the 113th Guards Rifle Division. Berestov retired in 1955 and lived in Zaporizhia until his death in 1961.  Early military career  Born into a large peasant family in the aptly-named village of Berestovo, Berestov obtained an elementary and some secondary education before going to work at age 14 as a sawyer. In February, 1917, he was drafted into the Imperial Russian Army, just as the Russian Revolution was beginning. He was promoted to the rank of junior non- commissioned officer in the 165th Reserve Infantry Regiment at Simbirsk, and participated in revolutionary demonstrations both there and in Petrograd. In February, 1918, he was demobilized. Berestov returned home, and worked his father's farm until he was drafted again in November, now into the 38th Rifle Regiment of the Red Army, in the town of Glazov. By 1920 he had taken part in fighting against the forces of A.V. Kolchak, done a course for infantry leaders at Kazan, and served as a machine-gun platoon commander in 4th Rifle Division's 12th Rifle Regiment in the war with Poland. During the war, Berestov became a company commander in August 1920. Interwar period Berestov continued his service in the Red Army through the 1920s and '30s. In 1921 he graduated from a battalion commander course held at Vitebsk. In 1924 he graduated from the Higher School of Physical Education in Leningrad. Later that year he was in command of a battalion of the 4th Rifle Regiment. In November, 1930, he moved to a similar assignment the 54th Rifle Regiment of the 18th Rifle Division in Yaroslavl. Late the next year he got his first staff assignment in the same regiment, becoming a logistics officer. During Stalin's Great Purge in 1937, Berestov fell afoul of the NKVD and was arrested. In the course of his interrogation he had all his front teeth smashed out, all of his toes were broken, and he also suffered a broken rib. In 1939 he was released and rehabilitated, having been vouched for by Gen. S.K. Timoshenko.Boris Gorbachevsky, Through the Maelstrom, ed. and trans. by Stuart Britton, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2008, pp 335-36. Gorbachevsky gives the year of Berestov's release as 1940, but it must have been the previous year, given Berestov's service in the Winter War. After his release, in August, 1939, he became head of supply in the newly formed 168th Rifle Division. In December he took command of the 402nd Rifle Regiment in that same division. Wounded in late February, 1940, during the Winter War, he continued in command and was soon awarded his first of four Orders of the Red Banner. On 5 March he was promoted to Colonel. After the end of the war Berestov was sent to the Vystrel courses, from which he graduated in June 1941. Second World War In the days after the German invasion, Berestov was appointed commander of the 1st Moscow Peoples' Militia Regiment, recruited from the Leninsky District. Berestov later became commander of the 60th Rifle Division's 1281st Rifle Regiment, leading it at Yelnya and Spas-Demensk. In November 1941, Berestov became commander of the 601st Motor Rifle Regiment. He later became commander of the 82nd Motor Rifle Division, defending the Minsk highway near Kubinka station during the Battle of Moscow. In 1942 he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On Mar. 13, 1942, he was named as the commanding officer of 50th Rifle Division, a post he held for less than a month, before being reassigned to command of 331st Rifle Division, where he would continue for the duration. The 331st would compile an enviable record during the rest of the war, mostly as a division of 31st Army, where it became known as \\"the best of the 31st\\".Gorbachevsky, p 333 On 27 June 1945, Berestov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for his leadership. Postwar service and later life In his postwar service, Berestov moved to command of the 72nd Guards Rifle Division in the Central Group of Forces (Hungary) in July; this division was transferred to Kiev Military District in January, 1946. His next assignment, from May until the end of the year, was as commander of 7th Separate Guards Rifle Brigade. During the whole of 1947 he led the 59th Guards Rifle Division in Odessa Military District. In 1948 he upgraded his command skills at the Frunze Military Academy, graduating successfully. His last assignment was the command of the 43rd Guards Rifle Brigade in the Tauric Military District from December 1948. In October 1953, the brigade was upgraded into the 113th Guards Rifle Division.Feskov et al 2013, p. 149 Berestov retired in December 1955.

It was built in 1890s. It is also known as Beaconsfield Station Sheep Wash (Ruins). It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The former Beaconsfield Station Sheep Wash comprises a dam, washing trough, machinery and tramlines situated on a creek bank near the site of the 19th century woolshed, north of Ilfracombe. The runs that later comprised Beaconsfield Station were first taken up in 1872, although they were acquired by southern investors and little development seems to have taken place before the property was bought by George Fairbairn in 1882. Fairbairn built one of the greatest pastoral empires in Australia, his station holdings in Queensland including Landsdowne, Barcaldine Downs, Home Creek, Bimerah, Delta, Logan Downs, Wolfgang, and Beaconsfield, which became one of Australia's premier sheep stations. At their peak, the Fairbairn stations in Queensland carried over 800,000 sheep with Beaconsfield alone commonly running 100,000 head. Beaconsfield's growth is largely attributed to its manager, Walter Anderson, who oversaw the station for Stephen Fairbairn, the youngest of George's several sons, and was resident at the station between the 1880s and early 1900s. A number of improvements were made during the stewardship of these two men; in 1893 an artesian bore was put down and 24 Wolseley shearing machines were installed at the shearing shed, which was also used by other property owners. The sheep wash is thought to have been built around this time. Sheep accumulate dirt, grease and vegetable material such as burrs in their fleeces. Washing the sheep before shearing removes this matter, reducing the weight of the wool to be transported. The Beaconsfield wool wash was built near a former dam on Brutus Creek about from a shearing shed. The pumping machinery was installed in a timber-lined trough cut into the bank of the dam. Water was drawn out of the dam by a steam pump located in the trough near the creek. The sheep were washed in the trough by a combination of manual scrubbing and water jets located along the length of the trough. The washed sheep were then moved up a race on the western side of the trough to draining pens where they stood before being taken to the woolshed on trolleys that were winched along twin rail lines. The winch was possibly powered by the steam engine used to power the steam press in the shed. The process was found unsatisfactory, perhaps because of difficulties in obtaining sufficient water supply, and was abandoned later in the 1890s. The wash may have been abandoned after an artesian bore was sunk at Ilfracombe in c.1897 and a wool scour established soon after. Other steam-driven scouring works, popular in the early 1890s, had by the end of the decade been rendered obsolete by the establishment of a wide-ranging network of large, mechanised wool scours (e.g. the Blackall Woolscour). Over time the track and trolleys were removed to sugar mills and the wool scours at Cramsie (near Longreach) and Ilfracombe. The scheme is considered highly unusual in Queensland pastoral practice; the large scale of both the scheme and of the pump itself are testament to both the imagination and capital resources of the Fairbairns who may have had experience of comparable schemes in New South Wales and Victoria. George Fairbairn died in 1895, after which the property passed to Stephen Fairbairn who moved to England in 1904 and remained there until his death in 1938. After his departure, the property reverted to the family company with Walter Anderson as manager until 1907, when Frederick Cobb took over from him. In 1911 the property was sold to John Murray. By this time Beaconsfield's area had been somewhat reduced by resumption. John Murray was a Scot who had moved to Victoria with his family as a youth. In 1864 he moved to Rockhampton to join his oldest brother and took up a run in the area called Fitzroy Park. He was successfully involved in the sugar industry in the 1870s. Entering politics in 1888 as a member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, he later became a member of the Queensland Legislative Council and Minister for Railways and Public Works. After his retirement in 1903 he expanded his pastoral holdings, including the acquisition of Beaconsfield. Following his death in 1917 the property passed to his son Norman who had managed Beaconsfield since its purchase. It continued as one of the larger properties in Queensland's central west until further resumptions were effected in 1929. The property is still held by members of this family.  Description  Timber stumps Beaconsfield is located approximately north of Ilfracombe. The former sheep wash is located some west of the homestead. The shearing shed, about south-east of the sheep wash, has been replaced by a modern building. The remains of the sheep wash are on the bank of an intermittently dry creek; the dam that retained the water there was washed away in a flood. The visible remains of the sheep washing process comprise a circle of timber stumps, which supported the turning loop of the twin rails from the wash to the shearing shed and which encircled the draining yard. Miscellaneous machinery survives including a centrifugal pump made by Robinson Bros & Co. (patent 1882) of Melbourne, jets under which the sheep were washed, and the end of the pump with a column to a head of pressure.  Heritage listing  The former Beaconsfield Station Sheep Wash was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Beaconsfield Station Sheep Wash, thought to have been constructed in about 1893, is important in demonstrating the evolution of mass wool production techniques during the development of Queensland's pastoral industry. It is a good example of an attempt at mass, mechanised washing of sheep using available technology in a remote location. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former sheep wash is important as an uncommon example of a large-scale sheep washing system in outback Queensland. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. The former sheep wash at Beaconsfield has the potential to yield information that will contribute to an improved understanding of wool production techniques in outback Queensland during the 19th century. The place is sufficiently intact to permit further study of the washing technique used at that location and to contribute to a broader understanding of the development of Queensland's wool industry. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former Beaconsfield Station Sheep Wash is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of such a facility, the following key features being extant: a dam, washing trough, pump, water jet, and tramline for transporting the washed sheep to the nearby woolshed. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former Beaconsfield Station Sheep Wash has a special association with the Fairbairn pastoral empire, one of the most extensive pastoral holdings in Australia at the time. It has a particular association with Stephen Fairbairn and Walter Anderson the owner and manager of Beaconsfield respectively, who were responsible for its development into one of Australia's foremost sheep stations.

At only length and gaining only about in height, the well formed track can be walked by tourists with a wide range of level of fitness. The track is maintained by the Department of Conservation and has views of Aoraki / Mount Cook and access to the proglacial Hooker Lake, typically with icebergs floating in it. Hooker Valley Track has been named one of the 'best day walks in New Zealand'. The lookout point at the end of the Hooker Valley Track is the closest any walking track comes to Aoraki / Mount Cook, and reveals completely unobstructed views of the highest mountain in New Zealand, with Hooker Glacier in the valley below. There is also access to the shore of the glacial lake. The vegetation around the track is open alpine tussock, and as such the track offers clear views of the mountains surrounding the wide valley floor of the Hooker Valley. Etymology The geographic Hooker items were named by the Canterbury provincial geologist, Julius von Haast, after the English botanist William Jackson Hooker. Description The Hooker Valley Track starts at the White Horse Hill camping ground, which can be reached from Mount Cook Village by either a sealed road, or a walking track of similar length connecting Mount Cook Village with the camping ground. The walking track starts near the Hermitage hotel. Adjacent to the camping ground, there is a car park, toilets, and a large modern shelter with informative panels. In winter, the access road to the White Horse Hill camping ground can sometimes be closed to vehicles following snowfall, but can be walked along from Mount Cook Village to get to the start of the track. Alternatively, the connecting track from The Hermitage Hotel across the valley to the starting point of Hooker Valley Track is usually passable. The start of the Hooker Valley Track leads through open grassland, as it passes close to the Alpine Memorial, a memorial to the mountaineers who have died in the Mount Cook National Park over the years. The memorial site overlooks the proglacial lake of Mueller Glacier. The plaque on the Alpine Memorial reads: \\"To the memory of mountaineers and guides lost to the hills\\" Suspension bridge over Hooker River upstream of Mueller Glacier lake Shortly after the memorial site, the track crosses Hooker River downstream of the Mueller Glacier lake on the first of three solidly built large wooden suspension bridges (Lower Hooker Suspension Bridge), that were upgraded in 2015. As the track leads around the moraine wall damming Mueller Glacier lake, it crosses Hooker River again, this time upstream of Mueller Glacier lake. After this second bridge (Hooker Bluff Bridge), the track continues north further into the wide Hooker Valley, gradually revealing an open view towards the peaks of Aoraki / Mount Cook, which remain visible for the entire second half of the track. The vegetation in this section of the track changes to snow tussock, spear grass, large mountain daisies, and Mount Cook Lily. All of these alpine plants flower in the summer months between December and February. Bridge over Stocking Stream in winter At times, the track leads close to the Hooker River, its water a bluish light grey colour due to the suspended glacial rock flour in the meltwater. At Stocking Stream, crossed by the track on a small footbridge, there is the concrete base which is the only remains of a previous hut at this location, as well as two self- composting toilets, the only toilets along the Hooker Valley Track. North of Stocking Stream, the wide flat valley floor becomes swampy and the track continues on a wooden boardwalk before it reaches the last of the suspension bridges (Upper Hooker Bridge). The track crosses Hooker River a third time, just below the moraine walls of Hooker Lake. A short track leads off the main path to small tarn, before the track skirts around the moraine wall as it climbs gently to the height of the moraine wall, reaching a lookout point with picnic tables, overlooking the proglacial Hooker Lake. From the lookout, a small path leads down to the shore of the lake.Icebergs floating in Hooker Lake in summer During the summer months, icebergs can be seen floating in the lake, and the lookout also offers views across the lake to the terminus of Hooker Glacier. Frozen lake in winter with broken ice around a small iceberg remnant In winter, there can be snow and ice on the track, and the lake regularly freezes over. The walking track is not cleared of snow, but since it is relatively flat for its whole length and not close to avalanche-prone mountain sides, it presents no danger to walkers of at least average fitness. The wooden steps between the memorial and the first suspension bridge can become icy and slippery following frosty nights, but may be bypassed by walking through the snow on the side of the steps. In the coldest months of the year, it can even be safe to walk onto the ice of the frozen Hooker Lake once the icesheet is thick enough, but care must obviously be taken. Icebergs that had already been in the lake at the time of freezing are then frozen in place, but the slight movement of these floating icebergs breaks up the ice surrounding them - these areas must be avoided. Because the track is exposed, there is no protection from the strong sunlight, and wearing sunscreen is advised. There are no boat tours on the lake, unlike at the nearby Tasman Lake. No permit or fee is required to walk the Hooker Valley Track. Dogs or bicycles are not allowed on the track.

The Metropolis of Iconium () is a metropolitan bishopric of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople located at Iconium in Asia Minor, in the region of Lycaonia. It flourished through the Roman and Byzantine empires, and survived into the Ottoman Empire until the early 20th century and the Greco-Turkish population exchange, which led to the disappearance of the local Christian population. The see continues to be occupied today as a titular see of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The current incumbent is Theoleptos Fenerlis, who was raised to the see in 2000. History Christianity came to Iconium very early. The apostles Paul came to Iconium escaping a disturbance and attempted stoning.Bastian Van Elderen, Some Archaeological Observations on Paul‚Äôs First Missionary Journey, 157-159.Acts 14:6-21 It is presumed that Paul appointed bishops or presbyters during his visit. From ca. 370, the see of Iconium became the metropolis of Lycaonia. The city fell to the Seljuk Turks in 1084, and became the capital of the Sultanate of Rum, except for a brief recapture by the First Crusade in 1097. The fate of the see in the early Ottoman period is obscure: Metropolitan Amphilochius is mentioned as occupying the see until 1488, but it is unclear whether any bishop actually resided in the city, as this is not attested in the patriarchal ordinances (berat) of 1483 and 1525. The historian Elisabeth Zachariadou suggested that the seat of the metropolitan was moved at the time to Egridir, but this can not be verified. The see was definitely revived in the 17th century, as the patriarchal berat of 1625 once again refers to the city as the seat of a residential metropolitan. Iconium remained the seat of the metropolis until the 19th century, when it moved to Niƒüde, where the Greek Orthodox element was stronger. During the Ottoman period, the Metropolitan of Iconium also received the former metropolis of Tyana, whence his full title was \\"Metropolitan of Iconium and Tyana, hypertimos and exarch of all Lycaonia and Second Cappadocia\\".

Gray (June 7, 1914 ‚Äì April 27, 1994) was an American entomologist and origamist. She worked as an entomologist at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York for 43 years, writing, illustrating, and creating large models of insects. Known as the \\"Bug Lady\\", she conducted outreach and education in the museum, in local schools, and appeared on The Tonight Show. She began practicing origami first as an extension of her interest in insects, starting a tradition of using origami creatures to decorate the museum's Christmas tree. In the 1960s, she became more involved with the origami community and, in 1978, co-founded the Friends of the Origami Center of America in New York with Lillian Oppenheimer and Michael Shall, now known as OrigamiUSA.  Early life and education  Origami Christmas tree at the Museum of Natural History, a tradition Gray started Alice E. Gray was born on June 7, 1914. Her mother came from a farming family and her father was an engineer. She was interested by insects as a child. Her mother, when asked by Alice to keep insects she had caught, agreed under the condition that Alice learn what they ate by dinnertime, leading her to become an amateur entomologist at a young age. While still in high school she knew she wanted to work at the American Museum of Natural History, and called its Insects and Spiders Department to ask about employment. Based on the advice she received from then-chairman, Frank E. Lutz, she applied to and attended Cornell University, studying biology and entomology, and training in scientific illustration.  American Museum of Natural History  Upon graduating from Cornell in 1937, she started work with the museum and remained there until she retired. She proved to be a skilled illustrator, modeler, and writer, and engaged in a range of public relations and communications activities. She wrote for museum publications, constructed many of the department's displays, built large models, and illustrated entomology handouts still used . One of her projects was the creation of large-scale models of insects that she called \\"model monsters\\". She explained her modeling process and purpose in a lengthy article in Mechanix Illustrated in 1945. The first such model she created took six months to produce, taking pains to ensure its accuracy. \\"A well-made model is both a text and treasure ... Of the hundreds of people who daily pass these models in the museum, many never see them. Others take one glance and gulp and run. There are some, however, who look, see and remember that it is for them that all museum modelling is done.\\" She cited a flea as one example of her work: \\"A flea made large enough to serve six at dinner by the lens of the microscope, stands revealed as most admirably streamlined and thus enabled to slip unimpeded between hairs.\\" She continued her own education while employed at the museum, earning a Master of Science in Education from Teachers College in 1949. As Scientific Assistant in the Department of Entomology, Gray was the primary educator and communicator on the subject of insects. In addition to working inside the museum, she brought insects and spiders out to New York public schools, presenting in classrooms and eventually earning the nickname \\"Bug Lady\\" through her outreach efforts. She appeared with her insects on television in the 1960s and 1970s, including an episode of The Tonight Show.  Origami  Gray's first encounter with origami was when she purchased a book on the subject based on a picture of a cicada on the cover. She took to it as a hobby, but her interest deepened after meeting Lillian Oppenheimer in the 1960s. Oppenheimer is credited with popularizing origami in the United States, and Gray saw in her collection an art and craft that could be taken seriously. Gray offered to taxonomize and organize the collection, in a project that soon after was the cover story of the Origamian. In 1964, when both the editor and art director of that magazine left their positions, Gray filled in for both, first as a temporary measure and later on a permanent basis. In 1978 she co-founded, with Oppenheimer and Michael Shall, the non- profit Friends of the Origami Center of America in New York. She gained international recognition for her work developing models, writing books, and generally supporting the paperfolding community. Gray secured an office for the society inside the museum which it continues to occupy . Its name changed to OrigamiUSA when Oppenheimer died in 1992, and it remains the largest origami organization in the United States. Folding paper to create toys and models of insects also became part of her work at the museum. She introduced the idea of using her origami insects to decorate a Christmas tree in the museum, starting with a small tree in her office, using folded envelope linings. When it caught the attention of the Trustee Exhibition Committee, the AMNH Holiday Origami Tree became an annual tradition, still active . What began as a small tree decorated with folded envelope linings grew into a large tree with about 1,000 origami pieces, including not just insects but origami representations of many areas of the museum. When Japan Publications looked to create a beginners' origami book for American schoolchildren, it recruited Gray to work with Japanese artist Kunihiko Kasahara on what would become The Magic of Origami, released in 1977 with Oppenheimer credited as photographer. An origami butterfly named \\"The Alice\\" was dedicated to Gray by artist Michael LaFosse in 1992.  Later life  The Alice, an origami butterfly design named after Gray Gray retired from the museum in 1980, after 43 years, but remained involved as a volunteer. The next year, she was given the title \\"scientific assistant emeritus\\". Among other activities, she continued to help with public communications and participated in the creation of origami insects for the museum's Christmas tree. She also continued to be active in origami communities, serving as the president of the Friends of the Origami Center of America from 1985‚Äì1989. She died in Norwalk, Connecticut, on April 27, 1994, at the age of 79.

Built in 1870, it has been converted into the Wabasha County Historical Society Museum. The building is one of the state's oldest surviving brick schools, and typifies their characteristic boxy, bracketed, Italianate style. The school was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 for having local significance in the themes of architecture and exploration/settlement. It was nominated for being a rare surviving example of Minnesota's early brick schools, and for its association with Reads Landing's peak as a lumber milling boomtown. with Description Reads Landing School is a two-story brick building on a limestone foundation. Its footprint is nearly square. A central bay projects slightly from the front fa√ßade. The building has a hip roof with a gable over the front bay. This is topped with a cupola. A wide cornice overhangs the building, supported by pairs of heavy brackets emerging from the frieze. At the base of the walls, an unusual water table is formed by a projecting course of bricks rather than material from the foundation. The windows have segmental brick arches and limestone sills. The central front bay is distinguished by a semicircular fantail window over the main doors, semicircular arches over the second story windows, and an oculus window illuminating the attic. In the interior, both floors have two rooms with a hall across the front. History Reads Landing was platted in 1856 overlooking the confluence of the Mississippi and Chippewa Rivers. It was ideally sited for riverboat traffic and the booming lumber trade, and success as a lumber milling center swelled the population. In 1870, flush with wealth, the town replaced its 1858 frame schoolhouse with this stately brick structure. Twenty percent of the $8,200 cost was funded by liquor licenses; at its peak Reads Landing had 21 saloons. Early architects Abraham M. Radcliffe and Charles G. Maybury popularized squarish, Italianate government buildings in Southeast Minnesota, both for schools and courthouses. Wabasha County's first large brick school was constructed in 1869 in Wabasha, closely patterned after Goodhue County's 1865 courthouse. Both were cruciform whereas the Reads Landing School and its 1872 near-twin in Lake City were both cubical with a single entrance. The only one of these four buildings still standing, the Reads Landing School reflects the emergence of the boxy Italianate school in imitation of government buildings and its evolution into a smaller and more practical form. Contractor Daniel C. Hill of Red Wing was involved in all four projects, and the unusual brick water table appeared on each as if it were his architectural signature. In 1882 the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway opted to route across the Mississippi River into Minnesota at Wabasha rather than Reads Landing. The economy and population of Reads Landing quickly stagnated. Never upgraded or replaced, the school remained in use until 1965. Museum A classroom in the Reads Landing School The Wabasha County Historical Society operates the Reads Landing School as its primary museum. One classroom is decorated in the style of the 1920s and 30s. Another contains vignettes of 19th-century domestic furnishings. The third classroom displays the pulpit and pump organ from Reads Landing's only church as well as items from other Wabasha County churches, while the fourth is given over to local music heritage.

It denied that human reason by itself has the power to attain to any truths in these domains of knowledge. It arose, mainly in Belgium and France, as a reaction to 18th-century rationalism and can be considered an extreme form of anti-rationalism. Its chief proponents were Joseph de Maistre, Louis de Bonald, and Hugues Felicit√© Robert de Lamennais. Their doctrines were advocated in a modified form by Louis Eug√®ne Marie Bautain, Augustin Bonnetty, Casimir Ubaghs, and the philosophers of the Louvain school. The fundamental distrust of human reason underlying traditionalism was eventually condemned in a number of papal decrees and finally ruled out by the dogmatic constitution Dei Filius during the First Vatican Council in 1870.

London: Ta-Ha Publishers. Zayd's mother had previously been married to his grandfather, Nufayl ibn Abduluzza, so her son from this marriage, al-Khattab ibn Nufayl, was at the same time Zayd's maternal half-brother and paternal half-uncle. Zayd married Fatima bint Baaja from the Khuza'a tribe, and their son was Sa'id ibn Zayd. A subsequent wife, Umm Kurz Safiya bint al-Hadrami, bore his daughter Atiqa.Muhammad ibn Saad. Kitab al-Tabaqat al-Kabir. Translated by Bewley, A. (1995). The Women of Madina. London: Ta-Ha Publishers. Religious beliefs =Abandonment of idols= According to the Islamic historians Ibn Ishaq and Ibn Sa'd, Zayd became disillusioned with the traditional religion of Arabia, for the stone that the people worshipped \\"could neither hear nor see nor hurt nor help\\"Muhammad ibn Ishaq. Sirat Rasul Allah. Translated by Guillaume, A. (1955). The Life of Muhammad. Oxford: Oxford University Press. and \\"the worship of stone or hewn wood is nothing.\\" He pledged with three friends that they would seek the true religion of Abraham, which they called al-Hanafiya. The other three men eventually converted to Christianity. Another of his friends was Abdul-Muttalib. Zayd travelled to Syria to question both Jews and Christians about their beliefs, but he was not happy with the answers of either group. According to later Muslim historians, he had \\"the religion of Abraham, following the natural form\\" and \\"worshipped Allah alone with no partner.\\"Bukhari 5:58:169. Amir ibn Rabia, an ally of al-Khattab, later said that Zayd had told him that he believed in the future coming of a prophet. =Monotheistic beliefs= Three points of Zayd's religious beliefs are mentioned in traditional Islamic sources. First, he did not worship idols and he rebuked the Quraysh for doing so. Asma bint Abi Bakr heard him declaring outside the Kaaba: \\"O Quraysh, none of you is following Abraham's religion except me.\\" He composed this poem: Am I to worship one lord or a thousand? If there are as many as you claim, I renounce al-Lat and al-Uzza, both of them, as any strong-minded person would. I will not worship al-Uzza and her two daughters ‚Ä¶ I will not worship Hubal, though he was our lord in the days when I had little sense. Second, he modified his diet. He did not eat carrion, blood or anything that had been slaughtered for an idol. He told the Quraysh: \\"Allah has created the sheep and he has sent the rain and the grass for it; yet you don't mention Allah's name when you slaughter it.\\"Bukhari 5:58:169. Third, he opposed infanticide. He rescued infant girls who were about to be buried alive and brought them up in his own house. When the girls had grown older, he would offer their fathers a choice between taking their daughters back or leaving them to be supported at Zayd's expense. =Reaction of the Quraysh= Zayd's wife Safiya disliked his travels to Syria. Whenever she saw him preparing for a journey, she reported it to al-Khattab, who would reproach Zayd for abandoning their religion. Zayd did not bother to explain himself to al-Khattab, but he rebuked Safiya for trying to humiliate him. Al-Khattab harassed Zayd so severely that Zayd was forced to leave the city. He spent the last few years of his life in the mountain-caves surrounding Mecca. Al-Khattab then instructed the \\"young irresponsible men of the Quraysh\\" to ensure that Zayd could never enter the city again. Whenever Zayd tried to enter in secret, al-Khattab's men drove him out again.Guillaume, A. (1960). New Light on the Life of Muhammmad, p. 27. Manchester: Manchester University Press. Death In 605 Zayd was returning from a trip to Syria. Before he reached Mecca, in the country of Lakhm, he was murdered. Waraka ibn Nawfal is said to have composed an elegy for him. You were altogether on the right path, Ibn Amr; You have escaped Hell‚Äôs burning oven by serving the one and only God and abandoning vain idols ‚Ä¶ for the mercy of God reaches men though they be seventy valleys deep below the earth.

Purcell also received criticism from a 2014 incident where a candidate was left off the ballot. Another controversy occurred in April 2016 when Purcell's office was forced to reprint 700,000 ballots after a mistake was discovered on the Spanish-language version of the ballots.

After initially blaming voters for the long lines, Purcell took much of the blame for the delay after reducing the number of polling places to 60, instead of the 200 used in the 2012 Presidential election. Within a day after the election took place, a petition on the White House petitions site asking the Department of Justice to investigate voter suppression and election fraud in Arizona reached its goal of 100,000 signatures in a record amount of time. Members of Arizona's House of Representatives called for Purcell to resign.

Bitnation was founded in 2014 using Ethereum smart contract technology. As of 2018, it has about 15,000 \\"citizens\\".

Etymology and terminology The term bitnation consist of the words bit and nation. It is a government-centric analog to the virtual currency bitcoin that also applies blockchain technology. History =Background= Bitnation founder Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof grew up in a Franco-Swedish family where her father had been stateless for a decade. As a defense contractor working in the Middle East, she witnessed what she considered unethical and non-sustainable governance during the Arab Spring. The incorporation between Blockchain technology and its proof-of-work core product Bitcoin inspired her to extend its products into education and national security, which gradually evolved into the backbone concepts of the modern startup company Bitnation. =Founding= Bitnation was founded July 14, 2014 by Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof. An early whitepaper describing the Bitnation concept and laying out a political justification was written largely in late 2014 and finished in March 2016 by Tempelhof and co-drafter Jason M. Farrell. A second paper articulating the Pangea jurisdiction and supporting technologies was written by Tempelhof, Eliot Teissonierre, James Fennell Tempelhof and Dana Edwards and released in early 2018. Per the white paper, its stated purpose is to \\"free humankind from the oppression and sanction of pooled sovereignty, geographical apartheid and the xenophobia and violence that is nurtured by the Nation State oligopoly.\\" Media Bitnation was the subject of a Vice piece in September 2016 wherein the author noted that \\"because a nation is as much an ideological concept as it is a legal one, one strength of Bitnation lies in its ability to give agency to groups who have been ignored or repressed by modern nation-states.\\" The International Business Times noted Bitnation is \\"sure to change the conversation about tangible blockchain solutions for global problems like a refugee crisis.\\" The Atlantic noted in February 2018 \\"Bitnation [is] proposing a 'peer-to-peer voluntary governance system' to replace the arbitrariness of birth as the decider of one‚Äôs citizenship. Blockchain governance could allow for the creation of virtual citizenship and autonomous communities distinct from territorial nation-states.\\" Bitnation also received notable coverage in The Economist and The Wall Street Journal for its experimental work in using blockchain technology to solve the migrant crisis.

He is best known as the designer and developer of Le Palais Royal, a 60,000 square feet luxury mansion, which was the most expensive home in the United States when it was put on sale in 2014. Leone's other notable project was the rebuilding and expansion of the mega yacht My Seanna. Life and work Leone was born in Bologna, Italy. When he was 7, his family moved to southern France, where he grew up watching his father create men's suits in his tailor shop. When Joseph Leone was 23 years old, he started his own high-fashion jewelry design and manufacturing company in Marseille, working with French haute couture and fashion houses such as Jean Patou, Rochas, Celine, Annick Gouta, and Lancel. In 1991, Leone arrived in the USA (Miami), where he worked with department stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue and Bergdorf Goodman. Leone decided to change careers in 2004, when a client invited him to become involved with the management of his private assets. His meeting with the multimillionaire Robert W. Pereira led to his two largest and most famous projects: the design and construction of Le Palais Royal, a 60,000 square foot mansion valued at $159 million, and the rebuilding and expansion of the mega yacht My Seanna. =Le Palais Royal= The client purchased an estate with a waterfront mansion in Hillsboro Beach in 2004. After buying an additional estate for a total of 5 acres, both houses were torn down. Leone began designing Le Palais Royal in 2007 and began building in 2009. He hired Coastal Construction Group to build the estate. Le Palais Royal was inspired by the Palace of Versailles and Buckingham Palace. With construction costs exceeding $100 million, the 11-bedroom palace includes several unique luxury elements, such as the first ever home IMAX cinema in the world, a 29-foot tall waterfall, and over half a million leaves of 22 carat gold covering the gates and the interior. Leone said he wanted to \\"build a ch√¢teau in the US,\\" designed to last like old European palaces. In 2014, Leone's client decided to sell the house because of his frequent travelling. Internationally marketed as \\"The American Jewel,\\" Le Palais Royal was the most expensive home in the United States when it was first put on sale. Its price as of mid-2016 was $159 million. =My Seanna= Impressed with the way Le Palais was moving along, the client decided to hire Leone to rebuild his 164-foot superyacht Newvida. The yacht was originally Gallant Lady, built by Delta for Jim Moran in 2001. The client purchased the yacht from JM Lexus in 2006. Originally, the client wanted a new boat. However, as he loved his yacht, Leone convinced him to keep the Delta and undertake a significant refit. Over the course of a year, Leone invited brokers for sale and charter to come aboard the yacht, consider its strengths and weaknesses, and suggest changes or additions. The goal was to make it the best charter yacht on the market. After meeting with naval architect Patrick Dupuis of Murray & Associates, Leone started the 18-month transformation project. The Rybovich Shipyard in Florida was tasked with the completion of the advanced cosmetic and structural changes to the vessel. Key to the rebuild was the extension: by adding 25 feet to the hull, she could then accommodate one of the most requested features from charter brokers: a beach club. It also allowed the upper deck to be extended so that it could include a touch-and-go helipad. A cutting edge AV system was installed, featuring an outdoor film screen on the sun deck and an underwater camera whose picture can be seen on the TV. Other changes included two jet skis, a center island in the midships area, an oversized custom pool, an exercise area and a sauna Leone designed the yacht's interior decor for a Continental feel, with extensive use of 24-carat gold leaf and Italian marble. He described it as being \\"like a Ritz Carlton, a very beautiful hotel, but the views change.\\" Completed in November 2014, it was a $17-million \\"total, no-holds-barred, you-have-to-see-it-to-believe-it rebuild.\\" The yacht was \\"thoroughly and completely redesigned from the keel up to be a pure charter machine.\\" The boat, now 185 foot long, was rechristened My Seanna after the owner's daughter. It became one of the most successful charters in the market. My Seanna was a finalist at the 2015 World Superyacht Awards in Amsterdam.

It first opened in 1956 as a commercial, retail and entertainment center. After closing for complete renovation in 2013, the International Market Place reopened on August 25, 2016. Revenues from the International Market Place directly support The Queen‚Äôs Medical Center. Historical roots King William Charles Lunalilo, the first elected king in Hawaiian history, at one time owned the land where the International Market Place is located, using it as grounds for his residence. Known as ke ali‚Äôi lokomaika ªi, or \\"the kind king\\", Lunalilo later gifted the land to Queen Emma, wife of King Kamehameha IV. Queen Emma was well known for her tireless humanitarian efforts, and saw The Queen‚Äôs Hospital being named in her honor as part of her charitable legacy. Donn Beach moved to Honolulu in the mid-1950s before Hawaii had become a state and leased a piece of land from the Queen Emma Foundation. He founded The International Marketplace in 1956, eventually opening a new Don the Beachcomber's restaurant there. A book co-authored by Beach's ex-wife claims the marketplace was the brainchild of Beach and \\"Pete\\" Wimberly, \\"conceived on wrapping paper in the back of the old Moana Cottages.\\" He commissioned celebrated carver Edward ‚ÄúMick‚Äù Brownlee to create much of the original woodwork for the Market Place. A large banyan tree saw Beach's installation of an office tree house where he could be seen surveying the activity in the Market Place below. Other buildings included the Dagger Bar, and several representations of small villages meant to symbolize Korea, China, Japan, and the South Seas. During the 1960s, the Market Place also included the Hawaiian HƒÅlau, Japanese Tea House and Esplanade buildings. Generations of notable musicians performed at the Market Place‚Äôs nightclubs. This included Martin Denny, the bandleader behind the fusion of new wave jazz and jungle noises called exotica. Singer Don Ho later had a regular gig at the International Market Place before he hit it big at places like Duke Kahanamoku's Nightclub. At its height the International Market Place encompassed 50 shops, night clubs, and restaurants, three of which were owned by Beach himself, including The Colonel's Plantation and Beef Steak and Coffee House. Beach was honored with a House Resolution Tourism Award in 1957. He passed away in Hawaii in 1989. The International Market Place had experienced almost complete turnover since its inception, and all of its buildings were finally bulldozed in 2013 after it had fallen into great disrepair. Preservationists ensured that the main banyan tree remained for the completely new International Market Place's grand reopening in 2016. A commemorative plaque installed on the new \\"Don's Treehouse\\" reads in part: \\"The opening of Dagger Bar and the Bazaar Buildings in 1956 marked the establishment of Waikiki Village. Donn Beach...lived and worked in this treehouse...it was also the broadcasting home of radio personalities like J. Akuhead Pupule, who shared Hawaiian music with the world.\\" Tenants The International Market Place's tenants include approximately 90 stores and 10 restaurants. Its anchor tenant is a three- level, 80,000-square-foot Saks Fifth Avenue, which is the department store‚Äôs only full-line Hawai‚Äòi location. Ownership International Market Place is situated on six acres of land owned by Queen Emma Land Company. The center itself is owned by Taubman and CoastWood Capital Group through a long-term land lease with Queen Emma Land Company. Taubman leases and manages the project.

The sculpture consists of two decommissioned A-4 Skyhawk fighter jets that were sliced and arranged nose-to-nose; the piece is suspended above the station's platform level. Jet Kiss was commissioned by Sound Transit as part of their public art program in 2008, during planning and final design of the station. The initial concept was met with a mixed reception from the public over its use of warplanes, resulting in design modifications. It was installed in early 2015, and the station was opened to the public on March 19, 2016. Description The sculpture is suspended above the Capitol Hill station platform. Mike Ross's Jet Kiss is suspended approximately above the platform of Capitol Hill station, a light rail station in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. The piece consists of two decommissioned United States Navy A-4 Skyhawk fighter jets, which were disassembled and painted magenta and yellow. The military markings are preserved with a layer of translucent paint. Both jets are arranged nose-to-nose and span along the platform, fitting between struts that form the station's walls. Ross said he wanted the piece to exude organic forms, drawn from the city and its surroundings. The choice of magenta and yellow paint for the jets was a move to offset the city's stereotypical overcast skies. The choice of jets was a reference to the city's aviation history; its use of a non-aggressive and bird-like arrangement (itself a reference to the city bird, the Blue heron) was a counter to the inherent aggressiveness of jets as a symbol. The piece was given a budget of $440,000 by Sound Transit's public art program. Jet Kiss is joined by two murals from local cartoonist Ellen Forney at two of the three entrances to the station; Forney stated that she designed one of her pieces, \\"Crossed Pinkies\\", as a response to Jet Kiss. As part of regular maintenance, Jet Kiss is cleaned of dust during overnight shifts by transit workers. History and public reaction Detail of the sculpture in 2015 Sound Transit, Seattle's regional transit operator, adopted a public art funding program in 1998. The program, known as \\"STart\\", allocates one percent of construction costs to art for all Sound Transit projects, including light rail. Construction of the $1.9 billion University Link Extension included $1.25 million for public art through the STart program; $550,000 was specifically allocated for Capitol Hill station, located in one of the city's arts-heavy neighborhoods. A national call for artists was conducted in 2007, with 120 entrants submitting proposals to Sound Transit. Out of them, Brooklyn-based Mike Ross was selected unanimously by the station art panel in February 2008; Ross was sought out by Sound Transit art director Barbara Luecke after seeing his sculpture \\"Big Rig Jig\\" at Burning Man. Ross presented his initial concept of deconstructed fighter jets at an open house in April, and was met with negative reactions from members of the public. The piece was criticized for its use of \\"instruments of war\\", and Ross himself criticized for being a non-resident. The 43rd District Democrats passed a unanimous resolution calling for \\"more culturally sensitive themes for public art [...] instead of warplanes\\" and the hiring of local talent. Ross was taken aback by the criticism, telling New York's Village Voice that he \\"definitely didn't expect to get resistance from left-wing political activists\\". Cartoonist Ellen Forney, whose work would also be used at the station, defended Ross's work and called his proposal \\"thought-provoking\\" and \\"something that's not 'safe' and totally public art-y\\". A second public open house was held in June, to more favorable reactions. A revised design was presented in October, re-arranging the jets into more abstract shapes and arranging them to \\"kiss\\" rather than \\"dogfight\\". The piece, called \\"Together\\", was approved by Sound Transit and granted a budget of $484,000 in August 2009. The two fighter jets were acquired from a scrapyard in Arizona, and were sent to Ross's studio in Oakland, California for disassembly and reconfiguration. Jet Kiss, as it was later renamed, was installed at Capitol Hill station in February 2015. The station opened to the public on March 19, 2016. Critical response In a 2016 review, Gary Faigin, director of the Gage Academy of Art and art critic for The Seattle Times, called the piece \\"ambitious\\" but lacking in execution, with obstructed views from the station's architecture at track level hindering its completeness. Faigin, however, complimented that it comes together from views at the mezzanine and escalators.

It was erected in Ilfracombe in 1899, but was originally built earlier at another location. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 November 2001.  History  Langenbaker house, a small single story corrugated iron and timber house, was erected in Ilfracombe in 1899 by owner Harry Langenbaker, an outback teamster or carrier by trade. The town of Ilfracombe dates from 1890, when ambitious settlers anticipated the arrival of the Central Western railway. However, some of Australia's largest and best known sheep stations had been established in the area from 1864. Rodney Downs, Portland Downs, Beaconsfield and Wellshot were the original holdings in what later became the Shire of Ilfracombe. From September 1891 Ilfracombe was a strategic railhead for teamster's traffic, positioned close to the final terminus of the Central Western railway line at Longreach to capture road traffic from the large stations toward Aramac and Muttaburra in the north, and to the lower Barcoo in the south. Teamsters or carriers as they were sometimes known, provided an essential service of carrying goods and stock across trackless country to the new stations of western Queensland. The first teamsters into a new country were limited to the use of drays, which were more manoeuvrable than wagons. Among the essential equipment of these first teamsters were axes to clear tracts of land, picks and shovels to make creek crossings and a piece of brightly coloured rag. The rag was tied to a wheel so that its revolutions could be easily counted. These rough measurements of distance gave carriers a guide for cartage charges and provided a bush standard which remained in use until the introduction of surveyors and roadmakers. Ilfracombe provided work for teamsters up until a branch railway line was opened from Jericho to Blackall in 1908. At this time many teamsters traded in their horse and ox and replaced them with motor lorries. Others hung up their reins and looked for work with the railways or at the wool scour which opened in Ilfracombe in 1898. Henry (Harry) and Mary Ann Langenbaker n√©e Kahl, came to Ilfracombe in 1899 from Barcaldine, where they had married in 1890. They brought their house with them on their horse-drawn wagon. Like many other teamster families it is likely that both the Langenbaker's and their house had already moved several times to various locations at temporary railheads along the railway line. Langenbaker house was assembled on Mitchell Street, Ilfracombe, in about April 1899 and remained in the family until 1991 with the passing of Harry and Mary Ann's youngest son Bernard. Harry Langenbaker, was one of many teamsters who took advantage of the chance which Ilfracombe offered to keep his teams in work. Bernard Langenbaker, youngest son of Harry and Mary Ann describes his father's life as a teamster: > Dad worked down on the lower Barcoo. Often he would be away for twelve > months at a time, and while there was work to be had he wouldn't come home. > While he was away Mum would often play the piano on Saturday nights at > euchre parties and dances at the hall next to the hotel. This way she got a > few shillings to battle along. Dad had switched from bullocks to horses for > his wagons when he came to Ilfracombe, and I suppose he had about 50 horses > altogether. The Gooch family, the Baileys, the Hanifins and Storches all had > horses too, so when the teams weren't working there might be 500 horses > running on the stock routes and reserves around the town. Harry was a typical teamster - hard working and hard living. Evidence of both his life and work exist in the Langenbaker house in the form of personal memorabilia and tools of his trade. Harry, unlike many others, continued to work as a teamster up until 1922 at which time he pulled his wagon to its final resting place at the side of the house and passed the time by making skewers for the local butcher and greenhide whips. In contrast, his wife Mary Ann was ladylike and dainty. She was an accomplished needlewoman, and many examples of her craft can be seen in the house. She was also a skilled pianist who taught piano to many Ilfracombe children, and whose services were much in demand at town social gatherings. Harry and Mary Ann had eleven children. Ruby, born in 1891, Lillian born 1893, Julius born 1895, Ivy born 1897, Harold (Sonny) born 1899, Thelma born 1901, Les born 1904, William Roy born 1906, Estelle Gladys (Stella) born 1908, Vera born 1911 and Bernard born 1913. Three daughters married into the Bailey family, prominent carriers and business people in the town. Another four children intermarried with other local families, creating a network of relationships and friendships. Affectionately known as \\"Daddy Lang\\" and \\"Mumma Lang\\" a feature of family life for many years, even after the marriages of the children, was a regular gathering at the Langenbaker house. In 1993 Marge Escreet (born 1922) daughter of Ruby Bailey n√©e Langenbaker describes a typical afternoon at the Langenbaker's. > All the Langenbaker girls and their children used to gather for afternoon > tea and to see their mother most days. There was a large pepperina tree > (Schinus molle) at the side of the house, chairs and stools stayed outside > and afternoon tea was held outside. The children used to ride bikes and play > on the big old wooden swing. They would stay there until the shade of the > house came over and joined with the shade of the pepperina tree. It was > lovely and cool out there. You would get a breeze out there. Dadda Lang > built the swing. It was made from big heavy bush timber, and the trace chins > from his harness. It was just near the back door behind the water tank. The Langenbakers sixth child Les, was blind as the result of a horse riding accident in about 1921. After this time the family took care to change the layout and features of the house as little as possible so that Les could easily find his way about. This is one reason for the remarkably unchanged condition of the house today. It is full of old photographs, bric a brac and other personal items including a tennis trophy won by Bernie Langenbaker and Marge Escreet at the Central Western doubles championship. Other items include early metal all-purpose tubs, a hand made wheelbarrow, a galvanised iron bath, an upturned hand made galvanised iron boat and more personal items including early 1930s hairdressing equipment. Following damage caused by a windstorm in 1933 the rear verandah was enclosed and extended and the kitchen built in its present location. At about this time the originally corrugated iron gabled roof was also replaced by a corrugated iron hipped roof. In about 1942 an air raid shelter was excavated to the east of the rear of the house, but there is now no clear above ground evidence of this feature. Another notable feature of the house is the use of laced hoop iron to provide screening for the verandah. The hoop iron was originally used at the wool scour to bind wool bale packs and wool bales. Townspeople found the material ideal to create shaded semi- enclosed verandahs. The technique was once seen on most Ilfracombe houses, but now survives only at the Langenbaker house. The last child of the family, Bernard, was born in the house in 1913 and died there in 1991. The house was then bought by the Ilfracombe Shire Council and has been conserved as a monument to the ordinary men and women of the outback.  Description  Rear view of the house, 2013 Langenbaker house is located in the centre of town on Mitchell Street, Ilfracombe, and is described as Lot 908 on Plan No. 14173 being the whole of the land contained in Deed of Grant. Like most of the town's houses, Langenbaker house was brought from elsewhere - the light timber frame construction making it easy to dismantle and re-assemble. There are four principal structures remaining on the land: the dwelling house, a garage, a shed and a lavatory. = The dwelling house = The house is set on low stumps. It consists of a front verandah, a lounge, three bedrooms, a combined kitchen/dining/storage area, a back verandah with bathroom off to the side, and a ground level lean-to verandah. It has a semi-detached rain water tank. The house is constructed of corrugated iron and timber and appears to have originally consisted of a front verandah; a central hallway with three bedrooms and one lounge room; rear verandah and semi-detached kitchen. The rear verandah is now fully enclosed and the original gabled roof has been replaced by a corrugated iron hipped roof. Windows facing to the south east and north west all have metal awnings. The front verandah is enclosed using laced hoop iron. The interior of the home is as it was at the date of the son's accident, in approximately 1921. Parts of the bedroom, lounge room and kitchen walls and ceiling are clad with timber paneling. Other interior areas still have exposed corrugated iron walls and wooden beams. Furnishings within the home are of humble design, with some furnishings being hand-built by the owner. The central lounge still houses a Radio-Gram and the later addition of a television. Photos, Bric a Brac and other household utensils remain in the home. = Other structures = To the north west of the house, there is a former garage, now filled with bric a brac. To the north east of the house, a shed, also partly filled with bric a brac. To the east of the house, there is a detached lavatory. An aggregation of building materials on the rear of the allotment, roughly between the two sheds, is the remains of a butcher's shop which was one conducted in Ilfracombe by Syd Bailey. The original outdoor toilet with provision for night soil removal also still exists at the side of the dwelling. The site is fenced, although the front gate has been removed. Shedding for vehicles and horses (night horse) still exist in the yard surrounding the home. No gardens have survived except for the peppercorn tree in the front of the yard.  Heritage listing  Langenbaker House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 29 November 2001 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Langenbaker House, relocated to Ilfracombe in 1899, is a rare example of what was once a typical Ilfracombe workers dwelling and demonstrates the evolution and pattern of western Queensland's transport industry and the development of western Queensland towns and communities. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Langenbaker House, relocated to Ilfracombe in 1899, is a rare example of what was once a typical Ilfracombe workers dwelling and demonstrates the evolution and pattern of western Queensland's transport industry and the development of western Queensland towns and communities. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Langenbaker House is thought to be one of the earliest surviving residences in Ilfracombe and a good example of what was once a typical workers cottage. The architectural style of the building and the significance of the removal and relocation of the property to its present site, demonstrates an approach to building design that was influenced by climate, culture and resources. This is particularly evident in the use of metal bales straps woven into a lattice and fixed to the front verandah of the house which demonstrates the creative ability of early settlers to make do with fabrics and materials at hand. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Langenbaker House reflects the life and work of Harry and Mary Ann Langenbaker. Remaining virtually unchanged since its erection in Ilfracombe, the house and its contents, including personal memorabilia and numerous household utensils, provides an insight into the life of a pioneering family and the establishment of the town of Ilfracombe. Relocated from Barcaldine to Ilfracombe in 1899 by Harry and Mary Ann Langenbaker, the house remained in the Langenbaker family until 1991 with the passing of Harry and Mary Ann's youngest son, Bernard.

He is on a peacebuilding and peacekeeping mission, working in the conflict zones of Jammu and Kashmir. Kadam has completed a master's degree in political science. He is a co-founder and the chairman of Borderless World Foundation, which is an NGO that works for the deprived and victimized people of the border areas of India. The NGO runs four orphanage homes for girls in four districts of Jammu and Kashmir.  Career  Early in his career, Kadam worked for many non- profit organizations as a Volunteer. He started visiting Kashmir on an educational tour in 1997. At the age of 19, he visited a Kashmiri Pandit refugee camp in Jammu to observe their conditions. During the Kargil War, he worked on the forefront, especially for the refugees who were displaced in Kargil, Batalik and Drass Sectors. Later he worked with Balraj Puri and the Institute of J & K Affairs on the project of \\"Children affected by armed conflict in Jammu & Kashmir\\" which was sponsored by UNICEF. He founded the Borderless World Foundation (BWF) in 2002 with another activist from Pune, Bharati Mamani and a local resident, Mohiuddin Mir who had been active in the region since 1998. The primary objective of the NGO was to assist orphans and provide for their basic necessities with a focus on education. They worked extensively under the project of \\"Basera-e-Tabassum\\" (Abode of Smiles) to establish orphanages for girls in the Kupwara district and later in Budgam district. Mohiuddin Mir was killed in 2005 by militants. From only 2 girls in 2002, the foundation has grown to accommodate more than 220 girls falling in the age group of 18 months to 20 years at four centers and can support at least 1000+ girls in the state of Jammu & Kashmir. The first center was established in the Sulkoot village of Kupwara. Kadam has opened several group homes for orphans of the war, particularly females who according to him are the most vulnerable in conflict situations. He was kidnapped by militants who suspected him of working for intelligence agencies but was released on the intervention of locals. He was later detained by security forces who had grown suspicious of him as he was released by the militants unharmed. Kadam is said to lead an ascetic lifestyle having dedicated his life to service and lives as described by an article in India Currents magazine as a \\"penniless vagabond\\". He considers his work to be a spiritual journey.  Borderless World Foundation  Kadam started Borderless World Foundation (BWF) in 2002 with the objective of creating a more humanitarian world. While conducting a children- centric socio-economic survey of the region, he gained insight into the challenges of the people living in these areas. He has worked on various ad- hoc programs for local communities with am emphasis on those who had been widowed in the conflict before founding the organisation. Currently, the BWF houses around 230 girls. More than 110 girls have been re-integrated into their communities and 40 are pursuing higher education. Kadam hopes to restore a \\"culture of faith\\" to the communities of Kashmir. The BWF currently has various ongoing projects and programs for humanitarian purposes. = Basera-e- Tabassum = Kadam initiated Basera-e-Tabassum (BeT), a shelter program established in 2002 for girls who lost their parents as a result of the armed conflict or terrorism during the ongoing Kashmir conflict. The four centers (group-homes) in Kashmir region are called Basera-e-Tabassum (abode of smiles) and the one in Jammu is called Fah (Facilitate and accomplish with humility). The BeT centers also assist mothers who have lost their husbands in the conflict in providing financial and material aid to their children. The BeT is supported by a few prominent philanthropists and well-wishers like the Holkar Family, Syed Ata Hasnain, Balraj Puri and Dr. S.Natarajan. The BeT also maintains facilities which allow children to travel to various cities for educational and exposure tours, and for higher education in professional courses. = Kashmir Life Line = Kashmir Life Line is an ambulance service launched in 2015 with the aid of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir. Kadam, during his time, working in Kashmir had witnessed many deaths because of lack of emergency services for medical emergencies. He initiated the Kashmir Life Line medical services in the Kashmir valley to help remedy the issue. Border Security Force and J&K;, Directorate of Health Services are also partnering in this project and run ambulances in border areas under this project. = Helping pellet victims = In the 2016‚Äì17 Kashmir unrest, due to use of pellet guns by security forces, many children and youths aged between 10 and 30 got completely or partially blinded, during protests and curfews. More than 1200 cases were registered in hospitals. who were in need of treatment from specialists; otherwise they could lose their vision permanently. Kadam assisted in humanitarian efforts with the help of the BWF by organizing doctors from across India, and asking them to come to Kashmir to perform eye surgeries for free. Dr. S N Natarajan at Aditya Jyot Hospital, and, Dr. Mahesh P Shanmugam and Sankara Eye Foundation at L V Prasad Hospital helped with recommending experts and provided free surgeries. Kadam had brought more than a dozen doctors to Kashmir to perform some of the most critical surgeries in SMHS Hospital in Srinagar. = Rah-e-Niswan = Rah-e-Niswan (women's way), is a social entrepreneurship campaign in Kupwara. Initiated by Kadam, it is a project for women entrepreneurs in Jammu and Kashmir. The project trains girls in making sanitary napkins, computerized embroidery, stitching, knitting, fabric painting, and tailoring. The aim of the project is to assist them in being self-sufficient and financially independent. Kadam has also helped young girls and boys to find jobs in various cities. = Jammu Life Line = Jammu Life Line was launched in 2017 by Kadam. It is an ambulance service started for the people on the border districts of the Jammu region. Kadam started the project after documenting the lives of people living on the Line of Control (LoC). The Indo-Pakistan border at LoC is considered perilous where skirmishes occur occasionally and sometimes result in civilian casualties. The Jammu Life Line project is also partnered with the Border Security Force.  In popular culture  Kadam has given inspirational talks at various platforms. He was a speaker at a TED (conference) at Rajarampur Institute of Technology. He has also been a speaker at Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Princeton University and at various Rotary International clubs.

He and his wife have separated and Clement wants to be near his daughter. His police work is a long series of petty theft and drunken violence incidents until a body is discovered by Jasper's Creek with an axe wound to the head. Clement is called upon for his homicide skills and takes control of the case, initially thinking it a simple case of opportunistic murder. But as he digs deeper into the victim's background, and after a second body is found with the same type of head wound he and the Broome police come to the conclusion that there is something more sinister at play. Critical reception Fiona Hardy, reviewing the novel for Readings, found the novel \\"a wild ride\\" and noted: \\"‚Äô70s punk- rocker Warner nails laconic Australian characters but has infused Before It Breaks with a sharp writing style. So immersive in its description of the outback that you could almost swat at the words on the page like the ever- present flies and use the pages to fan yourself from the heat, it bleeds casual realism, honest but never dreary, regarding the non-blockbuster limitations of technology on blurry pictures, office procedure and officers learning the ropes on their first murder, or the determination needed to traverse through hundreds of kilometres of searing West Australian space just to interview one person.\\"\\"Review: Before It Breaks by Dave Warner\\" by Fiona Hardy, Readings, 26 May 2015 Ned Kelly Award judges' comments: \\"The eighth novel from songwriter Warner nails the brief: well-drawn characters you could swear you've met somewhere already, and an intriguing plot with roots in other places and other times, studded with incidents that ought to be bizarre but which Warner renders believable.

The company based in Chicago, Illinois, and launched in 2013 by George Bousis.  History  Raise.com was initially conceived as a spinoff of another service created by Bousis and Bradley Wasz, called CouponTrade, which was founded in 2010. Since that time, the marketplace became more amenable to Bousis's idea. As stated by Crain's Chicago Business column, \\"a 2009 federal law prevented gift cards from expiring for five years; cards went from a magnetic stripe to all-digital in 2010; and advances in mobile technology made it possible to buy and sell cards on a smartphone.\\" Founded in 2013, Raise.com received $18M in Series A funding from Bessemer Venture Funding. A second round of funding in 2015 saw $56M in Series B funding from New Enterprise Associates. In August 2015, Raise.com acquired Tastebud Technologies for an undisclosed amount. Its CEO, Tyler Spalding, took the Chief Strategy Officer role within Raise.com. In June 2016, Raise acquired Slide for an undisclosed amount in stock, a company which allows people to store your gift cards in a digital wallet/passbook. Raise also announced plans to open a New York office. As of 2016, the company is valued at about $1B, as presented by the New York Times.

Raise.com also has partnerships with \\"over a dozen undisclosed retailers so far who are interested in the sorts [of] consumer shopping insights Raise can provide.\\" Raise has a one-year money back guarantee on purchases made directly through the marketplace.  Gift card fraud  Some users of Raise.com have experienced gift card fraud, typically executed by people who steal items under the return receipt requirements of stores and then requesting gift cards. Generally, customer service regarding fraudulent gift cards receives minimal complaints, and people usually receive a 100%+ refund within the grace period. As AdvisoryHQ states, \\"Many of the negative Raise reviews on this review site are from buyers who waited until after Raise's 100-day money back guarantee had expired before trying to use their gift card ‚Äì only to discover that the card was invalid or had a different value than expected.\\" The company now offers a 365-day money-back guarantee. While Raise has not publicly commented on this, their terms of service state that any user who attempts to sell an \\"invalid card\\" will be subjected to a sale price reversal and may be liable for the 12% sales commission. Additionally, the account holder may be charged a \\"card refund fee\\" in the greater amount - $20 or 15% of the gift card sale price.

Under the heading Dimanche (Sunday), he advocated the use of the poor on Sunday afternoon to community service tasks, both to give them an extra income as well as to maintain the risk of idleness. Faiguet is still known for different pieces of prose and verse inserted in the Mercure de France and other newspapers. He invented, for the service of armies, a sort of mobile and portable ovens, of which the M√©moires de l‚Äôacad√©mie des sciences of the year 1761 made an honorable mention.

She had driven two co-workers to the hospital after one had been bitten by a spider. While they were waiting for a prescription to be filled, Scott went to get her car to bring it around to meet them. Her car approached them, but it sped away; neither could see who was driving as its headlights had blinded them. They reported her missing a couple of hours later, after not hearing from her. In the preceding months, Scott had been receiving anonymous phone calls from a man who had reportedly been stalking her. He had threatened to get her alone and \\"cut [her] up into bits so no one will ever find [her]\\". In June 1980, a man called the Orange County Register, a local newspaper that had published a story on the disappearance, and claimed that he had killed Scott. Police believe the caller was Scott's killer. From 1980 to 1984, Scott's mother Vera also received phone calls from a man who claimed to have Scott or to have killed her. None of the calls could be traced, however, because the caller would not stay on the line long enough. In August 1984, partial remains were found and later identified as Scott's. No arrests have been made in Scott's case. Victim Scott was a single mother living in Stanton, California, with her aunt and four-year-old son. She was a secretary for two jointly-owned Anaheim stores, one that sold psychedelic items (i.e. love beads, lava lamps) and the other a head shop. Co-workers and friends said she preferred staying at home, was a devout Christian, and did not drink or do drugs. Her parents, who lived in Anaheim, babysat their grandson while she worked. Scott's father, Jacob, said his daughter may have dated on occasion but had no steady boyfriend, as far as the family knew. Prior to abduction and murder Months before her abduction, Scott had been receiving strange phone calls at work from an unidentified male. The caller alternately professed his love for her and his intent to kill her. Scott's mother recounted, \\"One day he called and said to go outside because he had something for her. She went out and there was a single dead red rose on the windshield of her car.\\" Scott's mother said one call especially horrified her daughter. The man reportedly told Scott he would get her alone and \\"cut [her] up into bits so no one will ever find [her]\\". Because of the calls, Dorothy began considering the purchase of a handgun; about a week before her disappearance, she started taking karate lessons. Disappearance and murder At 9 p.m. on May 28, 1980, Scott was at an employee meeting at work. She noted co-worker Conrad Bostron did not look well and had a red mark on his arm. She and another co-worker, Pam Head, left the employee meeting to take Bostron to the emergency room (E.R.) at UC Irvine Medical Center. Scott then changed her black scarf to a red one and stopped by her parents' house on the way to the hospital to check on her son. Medical personnel determined Bostron had suffered a black widow spider bite and treated him; Head said she and Scott remained in the E.R. waiting room. At no time, Head said, did Scott leave her side. Bostron was discharged around 11 p.m. and given a prescription. Scott offered to bring her car to the exit; she did not want Bostron to walk too far in his condition, as he was still not feeling well. Head said Scott used the restroom briefly before heading out to the parking lot. Head and Bostron filled his prescription and waited at the exit for Scott; when they did not see her after a few minutes they went out to the E.R.'s parking lot. Suddenly, they saw Scott's car speeding toward them; its headlights blinded them so they could not see who was behind the wheel. They waved their arms to try to get Scott's attention, but the car sped past them and took a sharp right turn out of the parking lot. Initially, both thought Scott had an emergency come up with her son. A few hours later, after not hearing from her, Head and Bostron reported Scott missing. At about 4:30 a.m. on May 29, Scott's car, a white 1973 Toyota station wagon, was found burning in an alley about from the hospital. Neither she nor her supposed kidnapper were anywhere nearby. =Discovery of remains= On August 6, 1984, a construction worker discovered dog and human bones side by side, about from Santa Ana Canyon Road. The bones were partly charred and authorities believed they had been there for two years, as a bushfire had \\"swept across the site\\" in 1982. A turquoise ring and watch were also found. Scott's mother said the watch had stopped at 12:30 a.m. on May 29, about an hour after Head and Bostron last saw Scott's vehicle. On August 14, the bones were identified as Scott's by dental records. An autopsy could not determine the cause of death. A memorial service was held on August 22. Mysterious phone calls About a week after Scott's disappearance, her parents received a phone call from an unidentified man who said, \\"I've got her\\" and hung up. The same man called \\"almost every Wednesday afternoon\\" and said either that he had Dorothy or had killed her. The calls were usually brief, and usually occurred when Vera was home alone. In April 1984, the man called during the evening; Jacob Scott answered and the calls stopped. After Scott's remains were found in August 1984, the family started receiving calls again. Police installed a voice recorder at the Scott residence. They were not able to trace the calls, however, because the man never stayed on the line long enough. A possible motivation in Scott's murder surfaced June 12, 1980. An unidentified man called the front desk at the Orange County Register (the paper had run a story that day about the case). A managing editor told police the man said, \\"I killed her. I killed Dorothy Scott. She was my love. I caught her cheating with another man. She denied having someone else. I killed her.\\" The editor also said the caller knew Conrad Bostron had suffered from a spider bite the night of May 28. He also knew that Scott had been wearing a red scarf; she had changed her black scarf to a red one after the employee meeting. Neither of these details had been published in the June 12 article. The caller also claimed Scott phoned him from the hospital that night. Pam Head disputed that claim, saying she had been with Scott the entire time and she had not made a phone call. Investigators believe the anonymous caller was responsible for Scott's death.

It preys mainly on wandering spiders, especially wolf spiders. Description A mostly reddish-brown wasp, with four narrow dark bands circling the abdomen, and with violet-blue wings its body measures in length. Distribution This wasp is from as far north as Canada south through the United States, Mexico, and Central America to South America and the Caribbean. Taxonomy The nine recognised subspecies of T. ferrugineus include: *Tachypompilus ferrugineus annexus *Tachypompilus ferrugineus bicolor Banks, Hispaniola and Cuba. *Tachypompilus ferrugineus ferrugineus Say, the nominate subspecies from the south eastern United States. *Tachypompilus ferrugineus nigrescens Banks, found in the more northerly part of the species range in the eastern United States *Tachypompilus ferrugineus torridus Banks, the Sonoran Desert and adjacent regions of southern California, southern Utah, southwestern New Mexico, western Texas south to Chiapas, Mexico However, the subspecies T.f. nigrescens from the northeastern United States may be a melanistic morph of the nominate subspecies rather than a valid taxon in its own right. Biology In Illinois, adults have been recorded as feeding on nectar from Rhus copallina, Cicuta maculata, Eryngium yuccifolium, Oxypolis rigidior, Pastinaca sativa, Asclepias incarnata, Erechtites hieracifolia, and Pycnanthemum tenuifolium. In California, the adults of both sexes have been collected while feeding on aphid honeydew and at flowers of Hazardia squarrosa, while females alone have been taken at flowers of Celosia floribunda and males at Eriogonum fasciculatum, Koeberlinia spinosa, and Melilotus albus. In Syracuse, New York, males have been observed feeding on Daucus carota. During a period of observation in a cemetery in Syracuse, males were observed perched on the top of a monument with their antennae and legs outstretched and wings held flat along the dorsum. They chased one another from their favoured sites and pursued incoming females in flight. Both male and female wasps sheltered within a crevice close to the base of the monument at night and when it rained. Up to eight wasps (four males, four females) could occupy this space at the same time. When copulation was observed, the sequence was that a male and a female landed almost simultaneously very near each other on one side of the monument near the base. They walked slowly toward each other, both scissoring their wings (whereas vertical wing flicking is normal in spider wasps). They closed to within 2 cm of each other, face to face, scissoring their wings and vibrating their outstretched antennae. The much smaller male then flew to the rear of the female, mounted her while facing in the same direction as her, and assumed a position towards the rear of her abdomen. The male grasped the rear edge of her fore wings with his tarsal claws and curved his abdomen beneath hers to make contact with her genitalia. His fore tarsi then grasped the sides of her first gastral segment. The pair remained coupled but stationary for 27 seconds before separating, at which point the female flew off and was followed by the male for a distance of 1 m. Females have been observed dragging leaves into their nests in Ohio This wasp takes mainly large spiders of the families Lycosidae, Pisauridae, and Ctenidae with a preponderance of Lycosa wolf spiders, with the two main spider species caught being Tigrosa helluo and Rabidosa rabida. The female grasps the prey spider by its chelicerae or pedipalps and drags it along the ground walking backwards. In southern Canada, the dark fishing spider Dolomedes tenebrosus has been recorded as prey for this spider wasp. In Florida, Hogna timuqua has also been recorded as prey. The nest is often located under trees or buildings; dry, powdery soil is preferred for nest construction. The nest is a simple depression in the soil which the female wasp excavates by raking with her anterior legs and tamping down with her metasoma. The wasp drags the spider into the depression and an egg is deposited on the abdomen, near the base. The female wasp then backfills the depression by raking in soil and tamping with her metasoma. The nest is the camouflaged with pieces of debris collected from the vicinity of the nest.

Biography  The elder son of Jean-Baptiste Luton Durival, Nicolas Durival spent his entire career in the Lorraine administration. Having a good education, he was placed in the offices of the Intendance of the Duchy of Lorraine, and applied himself fully to acquire the knowledge necessary to an administrator. Struck with the imperfection of the works that existed on the topography of Lorraine, he formed the project to write one that would depart from the drought classifications and the prolixity of particular stories, contain accurate records on cities, towns and villages of this country. He published various essays to better understand if the project would be enjoyed and to request help from enlightened people ; he finally brought out, after twenty years of work and research, a Description de la Lorraine et du Barrois which was regarded, rightly, as a model of this kind of works. He was then clerk of Stanislas Leszczynski's State Council, and finally lieutenant de police in Nancy. Durival was a member of the Acad√©mie de Nancy since 1760 and communicated to the company a lot of memories on objects of public utility. His police lieutenant position having been abolished in 1790, he was appointed city manager. Though he had occupied gainful employment for most of his life, he remained poor and was included in the number of scholars to which the Convention granted relief in 1795. Durival collaborated with the Encyclop√©die by Diderot. He is the author of several books on the history, customs, agriculture, geography and customs of Lorraine.  Publications  *1753: M√©moire sur la Lorraine et le Barrois, suivi de la Table alphab√©tique..., etc., Nancy, in-4¬∞. The previous year, Durival had a small number of copies printed for distribution to friends. Henriquez inserted the complete alphabetical table in his Abr√©g√© chronologique de l‚ÄôHistoire de Lorraine, of which it forms the second volume, without naming the author. *1748: Table alphab√©tique des villes, bourgs, villages et hameaux de la Lorraine et du Barrois, Nancy, in- 8¬∞. This table was reprinted the following year, with additions, and a third time in 1766.

The fourth volume has become rarer than the three others, the remaining copies at the bookseller having been sold to a grocer during the Revolution. We can look at this work as the result of all studies by Durival: the facts are presented methodically, the style is nice, and the many indications of scrupulous accuracy. The introduction, which is the first volume, is a complete history of Lorraine from Reinier Le long cou, first beneficiary Duke of Lorraine (959), until the death of Stanislas. In his Biblioth√®que physico-√©conomique, Sonnini inserted three memoirs by Durival : * Consid√©rations sur les plantations de la Lorraine, June 1809. * Th√©orie de Leopold 1er, duc de Lorraine, pour la construction et l‚Äôentretien des routes, October 1809. * Comparaison des effets du r√©gime actuel des chauss√©es avec ceux qui r√©sultent des proc√©d√©s de la th√©orie de L√©opold 1er, November 1809.

It was formed in 1835 by a group of influential colonists of New South Wales which had among its leaders William Wentworth, the son of a convict woman and the publisher of the influential newspaper the Australian; Sir John Jamison, a surgeon and founder of the Agricultural Society; and William Bland, a prominent emancipist doctor.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Australian Patriotic Association Members included prominent businessman Prosper de Mestre, Samuel Terry, W.E. Riley, J. Blaxland and A.B. Spark. In September 1834 Sir Edward Lytton Bulwer, M.P., wrote from England that the situation in the colony was not well understood in London, and suggested that an organised association should be formed, and that it should appoint a parliamentary agent for New South Wales.John Cobley, Bland, William (1789‚Äì1868), Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 1, MUP, 1966, pp 112‚Äì115. This resulted in the formation of the Association in 1835 by Wentworth. Bland was its \\"chairman of the committee of correspondence\\" (i.e.: Secretary). The Association sought representative government for the colony with a broad franchise, and was opposed by more conservative free settlers in the colony who, while favouring representative government, sought disenfranchisement of emancipists. The Association had representatives in England to put their case before the British government, which was then considering a new constitution for New South Wales. Bulwer acted as parliamentary agent until 1838, when he was succeeded by Charles Buller. A petition went forward to the British government in 1839. During 1839‚Äì1841, Bland wrote letters for the Association which show the constitutional struggles towards autonomy. Bland, as secretary, helped draft two bills for a \\"representative constitution\\", which contributed to the drafting of the New South Wales Constitution Act, 1842 (UK) with Bland representing Sydney at its reading and approval passages. The Association also supported the incorporation of the City of Sydney as a municipality, which happened in July 1842 with a broadly based franchise. The colony's 1842 constitution gave to emancipists the same political rights as free settlers, but which was subject to a property test. The right to vote was limited to men with a freehold valued at ¬£200 or a householder paying rent of ¬£20 per year, both very large sums at the time. With its goals partly achieved, the Association disbanded in 1842. The first election under the new constitution took place in 1843, with several of the members of the now-disbanded Association standing, including Wentworth and Bland elected to the New South Wales Legislative Council.

Before the Olympiad  = Anti-cheating measures = Mindful particularly of the cheating incident of S√©bastien Feller at the 39th Chess Olympiad (2010),FIDE Ethics Commission judgement 2/2011 combined with the general increase of cheating incidents, the World Chess Federation (FIDE) strove to have greatly enhanced security in Baku. Some of these were already introduced at the Chess World Cup 2015 (also in Baku), which included transmission delay of (some) games, random security checks of players, ban for bringing pens and watches into the playing hall and installation of electronic checkpoints for players at the entrance of the playing hall (see below). In an interview during the preparations (May) for the Olympiad, Israel Gelfer (the Chairman of FIDE's Anti-cheating Committee) said that the issue of anti-cheating became important in the last couple of years, with the development of telecommunication technologies (mobile phones, watches and even glasses) that have caused a problem which cannot be ignored. Gelfer explained that they are trying to balance between their will to fight against cheaters and at the same time not to create an unhealthy atmosphere in the chess world.Interview with Israel Gelfer (FIDE) The usual electronic scans before and after the game were of course prescribed, while novel procedures included: having a special anti- cheating arbiter (Klaus Deventer) with approximately 15 arbiters under his authority, one of whose charges was to carry out 30-40 checks during the round; and that players MUST inform their Match Arbiter when leaving the playing area. Both of these later came into difficulties with their implementation (see below). = Visas = Due to a small number of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more difficult to obtain a visa for when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all participants could receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem.Minutes 2012 FIDE General Assembly (Page 49) In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports. In the end, it was unclear whether any non-attendees (see below) were absent for specifically this reason. = Armenian withdrawal = Levon Aronian missed the Olympiad as Armenia chose not to participate Armenia's participation in a Chess Olympiad hosted in Azerbaijan was raised as a concern at the 83rd FIDE Congress in Istanbul in 2012 during discussions about Baku's nomination to host the Olympiad in 2016, with the Armenian representative protesting since Armenian chess players would find it quite difficult to play in Baku. Historically this is nothing new, as the tense relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan because of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict have been mirrored in chess over the years, resulting in the absence of players from one of the two countries at tournaments hosted in the other country and even relocation of chess events. For example, the candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012 was ultimately moved (completely) from Baku to Kazan, with consideration given that one underlying reason was because Armenia's Levon Aronian was inhospitable toward playing in Azerbaijan.FIDE to move Candidates matches (ChessBase, Kommersant) More recently, Azerbaijan chose not to play in the 2015 World Team Chess Championship in Tsaghkadzor, and Azerbaijani players did not participate in the European Individual Chess Championship 2014 in Yerevan. Nevertheless, Armenian players, including Levon Aronian, did play at the 2015 Chess World Cup in Baku, giving some hope the team would appear at the Olympiad. In May 2016, during his visit to Yerevan, FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said that, after talking to the Armenian Chess Federation chairman Serzh Sargsyan (also President of Armenia), he heard no refusal about their participation. The vice-president of the Armenian Chess Federation Smbat Lputian responded that Armenia was still discussing the matter and had not decided on the matter yet. In July 2016, Lputian announced that (based upon discussion within the federation) the Armenian chess team would not participate in the Chess Olympiad. =Other federation difficulties= Pakistan One week before the Olympiad started, the Pakistani Sports Board, dealing with three separate claimants to status of official national federation, refused to issue \\"No Objection Certificates\\" (NOCs). A spokesman said, \\"we have refused to issue NOCs to around 15 men and women chess players and two officials as currently no chess federation is recognised by us. Issuing them NOCs will mean we‚Äôve accepted an illegal body.‚Äù In the end, a team from Pakistan (with its top players) did attend and finished slightly above average. Kenya Kenya has had a long running dispute within its federation,2016 FIDE General Assembly (Annex 62) and due to this and other reasons (see below) the open team ended up not showing up for the event and the women's team began play only in round 5.Round 4 report (Chess.com) = Other non-attendees = Israel Israel participated without Boris Gelfand, Emil Sutovsky, and Ilya Smirin due to a dispute with the Israel Chess Federation management. The hardships were already evident in 2015, when the country failed to send a team at the European Team Chess Championship due to monetary difficulties.Israeli Team Won't Come to Reykjavik Despite All Efforts to Raise Funds (Chess News) Boris Gelfand, who played on board one for Israel at nine consecutive Olympiads (1998-2014), said the management of the Israel Chess Federation have \\"absolutely forgotten about such things as the prestige of the country\\". Emil Sutovsky claimed on his Facebook page that the dispute was about \\"showing who‚Äôs boss rather than money\\". Bulgaria Bulgaria played without Ivan Cheparinov and Kiril Georgiev, the former due to monetary disputes,JPEG from Twitter and the latter because the Bulgarian Chess Federation considered him banned.FIDE Ethics case 4/2015 (also mentions national court situation)The court decides who is right/wrong in chess (Bulgarian). The issue was addressed by Bulgarian courts who concluded the ban was improper, but that decision is under appeal. After the FIDE General Assembly (following the Ethics Commission) voted to ban the Bulgarian Chess Federation if no action was taken, the ban was then lifted. Moreover, Veselin Topalov left midway through the event to attend to his pregnant wife.Twitter (Silvio Danailov) At one point, the entire Bulgarian team was rumored not to be coming (similarly they were absent from the 2015 European Team Chess Championship), as was Greece.Armenian team won't participate in Baku-hosted Chess Olympiad Individuals Other than the above, the most prominent individual not participating was Vishwanathan Anand, who has not represented India since 2006. Vassily Ivanchuk from Ukraine was absent for the first time since 1988, choosing to play in a draughts tournament instead.Who is and isn't playing the Olympiad (Chess.com)  During the Olympiad  = African nations = A number of African nations did not show up in time, for various reasons such as difficulties flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay first, and then get reimbursed later).Round 2 report (Chess.com) In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic). = Lack of security measures = Despite the aforementioned anti-cheating protocols, some participants felt that this was merely a display without effect. Mobile phones were commonly heard going off, particularly in the entourage of FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov.Anti- Cheating in Baku (Alex Colovic)English Chess Federation post (Nick Faulks, Bermuda) It was also regarded as fairly easy to circumvent the initial metal detectors simply by passing an object around them.Twitter (Pavel Eljanov, Twitter)Twitter (Part 2 of previous) = Complaints on anti-cheating measures = A significant petition was circulated by Jonathan Speelman and others regarding the mandatory notification of the arbiter when leaving the playing area (the petition concentrated on toilet visits).Round 3 report (Chess.com) Reasons given for this protesting against this \\"noxious\\" rule included: the FIDE rule that the toilet is part of the playing area; an indication it was \\"humiliating\\" for players to discuss bodily functions with arbiters (and embarrassing for the arbiters); a note that the Match Arbiter (the indicated person to be notified) was not always available, rendering it difficult to always comply with the rule; an argument that frequent toilet trips did not indicate cheating, and a request that players not be penalised merely for this; and an argument that the opponent might gain information from seeing a player notify the arbiter by moving as soon as they left for the bathroom visit. The response by Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov noted only that the third complaint was legitimate, and that \\"common sense\\" should apply. Nigel Short received official warning for refusing to undergo a check during a game During the game of the seventh round between Nigel Short and Li Chao, the former was returning from the toilet with about 30 minutes to make 20 moves when an anti- cheating arbiter asked him to undergo a spot check with a hand scanner for electronic devices.Nigel Short refused an arbiter (Chess-News, Russian) Short did not heed the request, and sat back down to play. After the game, Klaus Deventer (the head of the anti-cheating arbiters) reprimanded Short with a warning.Round 8 report (Chess.com, updating the Short story) Short discussed the event extensively after the event, indicating that he did not think the cost of annoyance to the player (even when returning from outside the playing area) was comparable to the anti-cheating benefit, though he was not pressed specifically regarding cases where a culprit has in fact been disqualified following mid-game requests for inspection (some for refusal, others for being caught with a device).Nigel Short calls anti-cheating rule \\"anti-chess\\" (Chess24, Interview with Nigel Short)A quick chat with Nigel Short in Baku 2016 (Youtube video, Daniel King) Initially Short also mentioned the fact he and the arbiter in question (Jamie Kenmure, an Australian who is FIDE delegate for the Solomon Islands) have a political past, and thus Short did not trust that his being selected for the test actually originated from Deventer (as per the regulations). Alternative initial reports dramatised the event to have the arbiters \\"ask[ing] him to step away from the board and subject himself to a full search\\" while in time trouble and playing a \\"do-or-die\\" position, though these details now seem discredited.Round 7 report (ChessBase, Albert Silver) Multiple post-event comments by captains and players continued to report the annoyance of the anti-cheating measures, noting that a better balance between security and enjoyment could be found by FIDE.Back from Baku (Shaun Press)Interview with Anton Korobov (Chess24) Baadur Jobava was prominent on the other side of the issue, opining that the anti-cheating measures would help solve the non-stop screaming about this great \\"headache\\" for the 21st century chess player.Facebook post (Baadur Jobava) = Japanese player forfeited = In the fourth round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was forfeited after he was caught with an electronic device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in a change in the match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti- cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanoviƒá later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar ƒåoloovi·∏±.

It has been approved as a medication for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) after clinical trials showed it to have similar or improved efficacy and some improvement in safety over existing drugs for this application.  Medical uses  Rolapitant is used in combination with other antiemetic (anti- vomiting) agents in adults for the prevention of delayed nausea and vomiting associated with initial and repeat courses of emetogenic cancer chemotherapy, including, but not limited to, highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The approved antiemetic combination consists of rolapitant plus dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist. Contraindications Under the US approval, rolapitant is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine, whose inactivation could be inhibited by rolapitant. Under the European approval, it is contraindicated in combination with St. John's Wort, which is expected to accelerate inactivation of rolapitant. Side effects In studies comparing chemotherapy plus rolapitant, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist to chemotherapy plus placebo, dexamethasone and a 5-HT3 antagonist, most side effects had comparable frequencies in both groups, and differed more between chemotherapy regimens than between rolapitant and placebo groups. Common side effects included decreased appetite (9% under rolapitant vs. 7% under placebo), neutropenia (9% vs. 8% or 7% vs. 6%, depending on the kind of chemotherapy), dizziness (6% vs. 4%), indigestion and stomatitis (both 4% vs. 2%). Overdose Up to eightfold therapeutic doses have been given in studies without problems.  Interactions  Rolapitant moderately inhibits the liver enzyme CYP2D6. Blood plasma concentrations of the CYP2D6 substrate dextromethorphan have increased threefold when combined with rolapitant; and increased concentrations of other substrates are expected. The drug also inhibits the transporter proteins ABCG2 (breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which has been shown to increase plasma concentrations of the ABCG2 substrate sulfasalazine twofold and the P-gp substrate digoxin by 70%. Strong inducers of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 decrease the area under the curve of rolapitant and its active metabolite (called M19); for rifampicin, this effect was almost 90% in a study. Inhibitors of CYP3A4 have no relevant effect on rolapitant concentrations. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Both rolapitant and its active metabolite M19 block the NK1 receptor with high affinity and selectivity: to block the closely related receptor NK2 or any other of 115 tested receptors and enzymes, more than 1000-fold therapeutic concentrations are necessary. =Pharmacokinetics= The major active metabolite, M19 (C4-pyrrolidine-hydroxylated rolapitant). The stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group is unknown. Rolapitant is practically completely absorbed from the gut, independently of food intake. It undergoes no measurable first-pass effect in the liver. Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached after about four hours. When in the bloodstream, 99.8% of the substance are bound to plasma proteins. It is metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4, resulting in the major active metabolite M19 (C4-pyrrolidine-hydroxylated rolapitant) and a number of inactive metabolites. Rolapitant is mainly excreted via the feces (52‚Äì89%) in unchanged form, and to a lesser extent via the urine (9‚Äì20%) in form of its inactive metabolites. Elimination half-life is about seven days (169 to 183 hours) over a wide dosing range. Chemistry The drug is used in form of rolapitant hydrochloride monohydrate, a white to off-white, slightly hygroscopic crystalline powder. Its maximum solubility in aqueous solutions is at pH 2‚Äì4.

Celli lived with the latter order in Rimini until he decided to spend the remainder of his life in deep contemplation and so moved to the region's hills where he dwelled in a cave near the Franciscans stationed there. It is claimed he was expelled from his order and became a Franciscan though there is no evidence to support this claim. His beatification received approval from Pope Clement XIV on 6 September 1769 after the pontiff confirmed the late friar's local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular and enduring veneration. Life Gregorio Celli was born in Rimini. His father died in his childhood. He was baptized in the church of Saint Martin. Each evening his mother would set off for the local church to find her son there who remained entranced with the Gregorian Chant. His mother's relations - despite being devout - feared that Celli would not follow in his father's footsteps to become a doctor of law but rather that he would consider the religious life. In 1240 he was admitted into the Order of Saint Augustine and his mother became a third order religious. He travelled to the convent on a mule for admission to commence his period of novitiate and in 1242 he had become a well-noted and regarded figure in the convent for his penances and strict adherence to the rule of Saint Augustine. He made his solemn profession into the hands of the order's superior Matteo de Modena. It was Brother Matteo who later selected Celli to preach and hear confessions in the region despite the latter not being an ordained priest - though he was soon ordained as such at the successful conclusion of his ecclesiastical studies. It was during this period that he preached against the heresies of Catharism and he even met the famous heretic Armanno Pungilupo. In 1256 he witnessed the Grand Union of the order. In 1300 he set off for Rome to participate in the Jubilee that Pope Boniface VIII called for and he visited each of the tombs of the Apostles. In 1300 he decided to withdraw from the active life of the apostolate he had served for decades in favor of a more contemplative existence somewhere in the hills surrounding the region he lived in. He confided this to Agostino Novello - the general of the order - and the general embraced and encouraged him. He lived in a cave where he spent the remainder of his life in reflection and fasting. Gregorio Celli died in mid-1343. His remains are now interred in the church of Saint Augustine in Verucchio. Beatification Citizens in Rimini requested on numerous occasions that a beatification process be opened and it was believed that Pope Innocent VI drew up a decree for the actual beatification itself in 1357. People in Rimini again began pushing for beatification in 1757. The beatification was later approved on 6 September 1769 after Pope Clement XIV issued a formal decree that acknowledged the fact that there existed a spontaneous and enduring local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular veneration - to the late monk.

The club are currently coached by Wasps RFC Academy and 1st team transition coach Matt Everard, assisted by Nottingham RFC players Murray McConnell and Tom Holmes. The club play their home games on West Park.  History  The club was formed in 1969 by a group of local people, mainly businessman and school teachers. In the first season only 3 games were played before becoming full members of Derbyshire RFU in 1969. The club soon progressed to running two sides in 1971, and then by 1974 was running four senior sides. In 1982 the club ran a colts section which lasted three years, and then returned to running four senior sides through until the late nineties when gradually over a number of years the club was resigned to running one side in 2008.. Along with the decrease in playing numbers the club in parallel lost its level of rugby resulting in them languishing in the bottom league of the Notts, Lincs and Derbyshire rugby hierarchy.

A Menger space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers \\\\mathcal{U}_1, \\\\mathcal{U}_2, \\\\ldots of the space there are finite sets \\\\mathcal{F}_1 \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_1, \\\\mathcal{F}_2 \\\\subset \\\\mathcal{U}_2, \\\\ldots such that the family \\\\mathcal{F}_1 \\\\cup \\\\mathcal{F}_2 \\\\cup \\\\cdots covers the space. History In 1924, Karl Menger introduced the following basis property for metric spaces: Every basis of the topology contains a countable family of sets with vanishing diameters that covers the space. Soon thereafter, Witold Hurewicz observed that Menger's basis property can be reformulated to the above form using sequences of open covers. Menger's conjecture Menger conjectured that in ZFC every Menger metric space is œÉ-compact. Fremlin and Miller proved that Menger's conjecture is false, by showing that there is, in ZFC, a set of real numbers that is Menger but not œÉ-compact. The Fremlin- Miller proof was dichotomic, and the set witnessing the failure of the conjecture heavily depends on whether a certain (undecidable) axiom holds or not. Bartoszy≈Ñski and Tsaban gave a uniform ZFC example of a Menger subset of the real line that is not œÉ-compact. Combinatorial characterization For subsets of the real line, the Menger property can be characterized using continuous functions into the Baire space \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N}. For functions f,g\\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N}, write f\\\\leq^* g if f(n)\\\\leq g(n) for all but finitely many natural numbers n. A subset A of \\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N} is dominating if for each function f\\\\in\\\\mathbb{N}^\\\\mathbb{N} there is a function g\\\\in A such that f\\\\leq^* g. Hurewicz proved that a subset of the real line is Menger iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is not dominating. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than the dominating number \\\\mathfrak{d} is Menger. The cardinality of Bartoszy≈Ñski and Tsaban's counter-example to Menger's conjecture is \\\\mathfrak{d}. Properties * Every compact, and even œÉ-compact, space is Menger. * Every Menger space is a Lindel√∂f space * Continuous image of a Menger space is Menger * The Menger property is closed under taking F_\\\\sigma subsets * Menger's property characterizes filters whose Mathias forcing notion does not add dominating functions.

It was introduced during the Renaissance, and since has been used frequently by many prominent poets. The importance of the Sapphic stanza for Polish literature lies not only in its frequent use, but also in the fact that it formed the basis of many new strophes, built up of hendecasyllables (11-syllable lines) and pentasyllables (5-syllable lines). Metrical components =Classical models= The stanza comes from classical Greece, but it was the Romans, especially Horace, who provided the chief models for Renaissance poets. Horace's Sapphic stanza comprised three \\"lesser sapphics\\" and an \\"adonic\\": ‚Äì u ‚Äì x ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì x ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u ‚Äì x ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì = long syllable; u = short syllable; x = anceps: either long or short =Polish verse= In Polish there was no quantitative verse, as phonemic quantity itself was extinct. Nor was there accentual-syllabic versification, save some attempts by Jan Kochanowski. But Polish syllabic lines were available. A syllabic hendecasyllable 11(5+6) took the place of the quantitative lesser sapphic; likewise with the adonic. Quantitative Lesser Sapphic: ‚Äì u ‚Äì x ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì Syllabic Polish Hendecasyllable: o o o S s  o o o o S s Quantitative Adonic: ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì Polish Pentasyllable: o o o S s o = any syllable; S = stressed syllable; s = unstressed syllable;  = caesura The hendecasyllable (with caesura after the fifth syllable) is very common in Polish poetry, and the pentasyllable is so typical for Polish verse that Karol Wiktor Zawodzi≈Ñski gave it the name of polonik.Micha≈Ç G≈Çowi≈Ñski, Teresa Kostkiewiczowa, Aleksandra Okopie≈Ñ-S≈Çawi≈Ñska, Janusz S≈Çawi≈Ñski, S≈Çownik termin√≥w literackich, Wroc≈Çaw 2002 (polonik). Pentasyllables occur in Polish poetry either in a long series of corresponding lines, or in combination with other metrical lines. They can also form a part- line within the metrical patterns of longer lines, such as: 8(5+3), 9(5+4), 10(5+5), 11(5+6), 12(5+7), 12(7+5), 13(8+5), and even 15(5+5+5) and 20(5+5+5+5). The Renaissance The Renaissance was the epoch when Polish literature became a great one.Andrzej Borowski wrote a monograph about Polish literature of 16th century: Andrzej Borowski, Renesans, Wydanie pierwsze, Wydawnictwa Szkolne i Pedagodgiczne, Warszawa 1992. Polish poets of the time were well educated, mainly in Italy, knew Latin and sometimes Greek, and worked hard on building a new Polish literature. Many authors wrote in Latin, while some tried to create a modern Polish literary language. As in other European literatures, Polish poets often looked to Greek and Roman literature as a model. Jan Kochanowski, the most prominent of a family of poets, wrote lyrical poems, often in imitation of Horace. The classic Polish Sapphic stanza was thus 11(5+6) / 11(5+6) / 11(5+6) / 5, typically rhymed a a b b. Jan Kochanowski used this Sapphic stanza several times in his Cantos, Laments, and Psalms. An excellent example is Lament XVI. Miko≈Çaj Sƒôp-Szarzy≈Ñski, who was the author of Rymy, abo wiersze polskie (The rhymes or Polish poems) and Sebastian Grabowiecki, who was the author of Setnik rym√≥w duchownych (Spiritual Rhymes) also used Sapphic stanzas in their lyrical pieces. Sebastian Fabian Klonowic (known as Acernus) decided to employ the stanza in a longer epic poem. His Flis, to Jest Spuszczanie Statk√≥w Wis≈ÇƒÖ i inszymi rzekami (The lightening or expediting barges on the Vistula river and other rivers) is because of its stanzaic form an exceptional work, perhaps not only in Polish literature. The whole poem is 471 stanzas long and probably no other work can be compared to it. Tobiasz Wiszniowski, who wrote his own sequence of Laments, employed Sapphic stanza in Tren XVII (Lament XVII).Tobiasz Wiszniowski, Treny. Opracowa≈Ç Jacek W√≥ycicki, Wydawnictwo Neriton, Warszawa 2008. The Baroque At the beginning of the Baroque, Kasper Miaskowski employed the Sapphic stanza in some poems. Olbrycht Karmanowski, a minor poet, employed it in the poem O ≈õmierci (On Death). Lenart Gnoi≈Ñski used Sapphic stanzas in the tenth poem of a sequence named ≈Åzy smutne (Sorrowful Tears). Daniel Naborowski, a Calvinist poet, employed the Sapphic stanza in Lament I from Laments on Death of Duke Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç, Castellan of Vilnius. The poem consists of eleven strophes.See: Treny na ≈õmierƒá ksiecia Radziwi≈Ç≈Ça, kasztelana wile≈Ñskiego. Tren I [in:] Daniel Naborowski, Poezje wybrane. Wyboru dokona≈Ç i opracowa≈Ç Krzysztof Karasek, Ludowa Sp√≥≈Çdzielnia Wydawnicza, Warszawa 1980, p. 118-119. Jan Andrzej Morsztyn, whose poetry (influenced strongly by Giambattista Marino) is most typical for Baroque, used Sappho's stanza in Do lutnie (To a Lute) from Lutnia (The Lute) and in Wiejski ≈ºywot (Life in a Village from the book Kaniku≈Ça, albo psia gwiazda (Canicula or dog star). Zbigniew Morsztyn shaped his Sapphic stanzas so as to make a long chain of linked strophes, exhibiting many enjambments from one to the next stanza.Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 115. He is the author of the poem S≈Çawna wiktoryja nad Turkami (The Famous Victory over the Turks), which is an example of the use of the Sapphic stanza in an epic function.Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 111. Large parts of Klemens Boles≈Çawiusz's Przera≈∫liwe echo trƒÖby ostatecznej (The Horrifying Echo of Doomsday Trumpet) are composed in Sapphic stanzas.See: Klemens Boles≈Çawiusz, Przera≈∫liwe echo trƒÖby ostatecznej. Wyda≈Ç Jacek Sokolski, Instytut Bada≈Ñ Literackich, Warszawa 2004. This work, which can be compared to The Revelation of St. John or Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, was extremely popular and appeared in eighteen editions from 1670 to 1886. It is another example of the Sapphic stanza serving an epic function in Old Polish literature. The Enlightenment The Sapphic stanza was also used in Poland during Enlightenment. Poets of the time preferred the Polish alexandrine (7+6) to the hendecasyllable (5+6), but used the latter metre in Italian forms, such as sesta rima and ottava rima, as well as in Sappho's stanza. Sapphic stanzas can be found in Adam Naruszewicz's poetry. He used the form among others in the poem Pie≈õ≈Ñ doroczna na dzie≈Ñ ocalenia ≈ºycia i zdrowia J. K. Mo≈õci (Annual song for the day of rescuing life and health of His Majesty, the King). He also employed it in the poem \\"Piesek\\" (\\"A little dog\\"). Franciszek Karpi≈Ñski made use of the analysed formLucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p.157. in Psalm 8. O wielko≈õci Boga (Psalm 8. On God's grandeur). He repeated it in the Psalmu 64 czƒô≈õƒá. O opatrzno≈õci (Part of Psalm 64. On Providence) and in the poem Pie≈õ≈Ñ do ≈õwiƒôtych Polak√≥w, patron√≥w Polski (Hymn to the holy Poles, patrons of Poland). Another poet, Franciszek Dionizy Knia≈∫nin used Sappho's stanza very frequently.Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 157. Another example of Sapphic stanza is a hymn included in Gorzkie ≈ºale (Bitter Lamentations), a typically Polish Catholic devotion, sung in churches on Sundays during Lent, and familiar to many Poles. Romanticism Neither Adam Mickiewicz nor Juliusz S≈Çowacki used the classic Sapphic stanza.Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 222. S≈Çowacki, however, employed its general scheme in his own six-line stanza, discussed below. Cyprian Kamil Norwid, a poet regarded as one of the greatest Polish authors and perhaps the most modern of the poets of the 19th century, used Sapphic stanzas in the poem named Trzy zwrotki (Three strophes), as well as in many other poemsLucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 223. including Sieroctwo (Orphanhood). Sometimes he implemented the scheme freely, as in the poem Buntowniki (Rioters). Second half of the 19th century The second half of the 19th century in Polish literature was dominated by pozytywizm (positivism), which was the local Polish version of West-European realism. The two greatest poets of the time were Adam Asnyk and Maria Konopnicka. Their poetry was much influenced by French Parnassianism. Maria Konopnicka published more than twenty poems written in the form. She also used its scheme for constructing more complicated stanzas. Felicjan Fale≈Ñski attempted a Polish Sapphic stanza more closely resembling the Greek and Latin models, and in translating Horace's poetry used a hendecasyllable with the caesura after the fourth, not the fifth syllable.Kazimierz W√≥ycicki, Forma d≈∫wiƒôkowa prozy polskiej i wiersza polskiego, E. Wende i S-ka, Warszawa 1912, p. 211. His Sapphic stanzas influenced the Czech poet Jaroslav Vrchlick√Ω. Also Kazimierz Wroczy≈Ñski tried to imitate Greek rhythm in his poem Strofa Safony (Sappho's strophe).Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 287. His stanza is composed of three lines of SsSsSsSSsSs and one of SssSs. The SsSsSsSSsSs scheme is just a trochaic hexameter (SsSsSsSsSsSs) with the eighth syllable omitted. For comparison to Horace's standard: Horace: ‚Äì u ‚Äì x ‚Äì u u ‚Äì u ‚Äì ‚Äì Wroczy≈Ñski: S s S s S s S S s S s (√ó3) Horace: ‚Äì u u ‚Äì ‚Äì Wroczy≈Ñski: S s s S s 20th century In the 20th century classic strophes went out of use together with regular verse. Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz used Sapphic stanza in the poem Marzec w Pary≈ºu (March in Paris). It is composed of four stanzas and three are Sapphic ones. Only the last one is made up of four hendecasyllabic lines. All strophes rhyme ABAB. The Sapphic stanza is still used in translations form Sappho's or Horace's poems. The scheme of Sapphic stanza is so recognizable, that it can be preserved even in free verse. Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska points out that Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz sometimes composed four-line stanzas with last line of five syllables and other lines of different length.Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 329. Other forms derived from the Sapphic stanza The Sapphic stanza's scheme was so attractive to Polish poets that they started to modify it, and many stanzas based on it can be found in Polish literature. Already in the 16th century Jan Kochanowski created a three-line stanza, being just a shortened Sapphic stanza (11/11/5), and used it in his Psalm 34.Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 64. Much later Kochanowski's proposal was used by Cyprian Kamil Norwid in his famous poem Co≈õ ty Atenom zrobi≈Ç, Sokratesie? (What Did You Do to Athens, Socrates?) Juliusz S≈Çowacki, a romantic poet, frequently used a sexain rhyming a b a b c c, and invented a stanza using this rhyme scheme but suggesting the Sapphic stanza in its metre: 11a/11b/11a/5b/11c/5c.Wiktor Jaros≈Çaw Darasz, Ma≈Çy przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Towarzystwo Mi≈Ço≈õnik√≥w Jƒôzyka Polskiego, Krak√≥w 2003, p. 145-146. It is also possible that S≈Çowacki was inspired by the well- known Burns stanza which also consists of four longer lines (iambic tetrameters) and two shorter (iambic dimeters): But Mousie, thou art no thy- lane, In proving foresight may be vain: The best laid schemes o‚Äô Mice an‚Äô Men Gang aft agley, An‚Äô lea‚Äôe us nought but grief an‚Äô pain, For promis‚Äôd joy! Maria Konopnicka used S≈Çowacki's stanza in her well-known poem with the Latin title \\"Contra spem spero\\", and in the poems \\"Do ziemi\\" (\\"To the soil\\") and in \\"Zima do poety\\" (\\"Winter to the poet\\"). In another poem, \\"Jej pamiƒôci\\" (\\"To her memory\\"), she employed a very similar strophe, also 11/11/11/5/11/5, but rhymed AABBCC. In the lyric \\"Preludium\\" (\\"Prelude\\") she employed a seven-line stanza, built in much the same way: 11a/11b/11a/11a/5b/11c/5c. Once again she suggested Sappho's stanzaic pattern in the poem \\"Pos≈Çom wielkopolskim\\" (\\"To the deputies from the Greater Poland\\"), which goes 11a/11b/11a/5b/11c/11c; she repeated this scheme in \\"Improwizacja\\" (\\"Improvisation\\") and in \\"Ave, Patria\\". In the poem \\"Id≈∫, id≈∫ w pokoju!\\" (\\"Go away in peace\\") Konopnicka used a six- line strophe 5a/11b/11b/11c/11c/5a. Another form used by Konopnicka suggestive of the Sapphic stanza is a quatrain composed of three hendecasyllabic lines and one trisyllable,Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 262. used in \\"Kto krzywdƒô p≈Çodzi\\" (\\"Who begets harm\\"). More complicated is an eight-line stanza 11/11/11/5/11/11/11/3 (rhymed ABABCCAB), as was employed in the \\"W Porta Pia\\" (\\"In Porta Pia\\"). Another form developed by Konopnicka is the five-line strophe including decasyllabic lines and masculine rhymes: 10m/5f/10m/10m/5f, used in \\"Kt√≥rzy idziemy\\" (\\"We that are going\\"). Adam Asnyk wrote an epigram (Italian strambotto) \\"Ironia\\" (\\"Irony\\") in the form of ottava rima with the last line being a pentasyllable. He also often combined octosyllables with a pentasyllable, making a quasi-Sapphic stanza of 8/8/8/5. He was not the first poet to use such a stanza, being preceded by Franciszek Dionizy Knia≈∫nin and by the Romantic poet Kazimierz Brodzi≈Ñski.Lucylla Pszczo≈Çowska, Wiersz polski. Zarys historyczny, Wroc≈Çaw 1997, p. 191. There are also more unusual forms. Jerzy Szlichting, a poet from 17th century, in his Pie≈õ≈Ñ (Song) made Sapphic-like strophe 13(8+5)a/13(8+5)a/16(8b+8b)/5x. It is an example of stanza with internal rhymes. The strophe is built of segments of five or eight syllables.

The galaxy cluster appears to be undergoing the transformation from a galaxy cluster that is still forming, a proto-cluster, to a mature cluster, and it is the first such cluster observed in this stage of its evolution. The cluster consists of seventeen galaxies, and nine of the eleven massive galaxies closest to its centre are starburst galaxies are together forming new stars at the rate of about 3,400 Suns per year. In contrast, the Milky Way produces only the equivalent of one Sun per year, so these galaxies at the core of the cluster are producing stars at a rate three thousand times greater than the Milky Way on average. Other galaxy clusters at ten billion light years and closer have far less star formation, and this suggests that star formation slows down in large galaxies within clusters after the galaxies have already come together during the development of a galaxy cluster.

Probably built in the 1850s, it is a well-preserved example of a first- generation railroad depot. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978, and now houses offices. Description and history The former New Haven Junction Depot stands adjacent to railroad tracks just north of the western junction of US 7 and Vermont 17 in the village of New Haven Junction. It is a single-story brick building with a gabled roof. It has Italianate styling, including rounded-arch windows and extended eaves supported by large brackets. The track-facing facade has two entrances, located in the second and fourth of five bays. An original manual semaphore control tower rises through the eave near the center of that facade. with The station's exact construction date is not known, and is assumed to be in the decade following the 1849 introduction of railroad service to the area by the Rutland and Burlington Railroad. The station was first listed as a stop in that railroad's timetables in 1854, suggesting construction of the depot took place in 1852 or 1853. The railroad was in the second half of the 19th century an important transportation artery for both the Burlington area's lumber industry, and the Rutland area's marble quarries. This building underwent restoration in the late 1970s.

It also made recommendations for reform of school education, curricular reforms at Universities, recommendations on education and examinations, research, as well as student welfare and state scholarships.

Though intellectual leader of the latter and Pascual's mentor Ram√≥n Mass√≥Lavard√≠n 1976, p. 274 abandoned politics, his AET-entourage continued the campaign to gain control of key positions in the party. Supported by the Carlist heir-to-the-throne Don Carlos Hugo, in 1966 they ensured Pascual's nomination to manager of the semi-official Carlist mouthpiece, El Pensamiento Navarro.Lavard√≠n 1976, p. 274. It is not clear whether the former manager of El Pensamiento Navarro, Francisco L√≥pez Sanz, was dismissed or talked into resignation (perhaps on the basis of his advanced age, as he completed 70 in 1966) It is not clear whether the Traditionalists realized the plot; officially they wholeheartedly endorsed Pascual.an iconic person of Pamplona Traditionalism, Joaqu√≠n Baleztena, delivered a warm welcome address, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 56. Also, when at one point it appeared that the resigning pro-Juanista members of the board would be able to suggest their successors, Ignacio Baleztena ensured that instead it would be Pascual coming out with the proposals, Mercedes V√°zquez de Prada, El final de una ilusi√≥n. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967), Madrid 2016, , p. 304. According to some accounts, it seems that Pascual, a determined supporter of Don Javier, might have been seconded to El Pensamiento by Valiente with the specific task of eradicating pro-Juanista feelings, visible in the daily, V√°zquez de Prada 2016, p. 80 Due to lack of funds Pascual failed to launch technological overhaul of antiquated newspaper;Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 72-76 he made it look more agile by re-arranging the layout,Errea Iribas 2007, p. 248.

The same year he kept publishing flattering photographs of Joaqu√≠n Baleztena, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 220 To the contrary, the change was styled as renovating Carlist thought; he presented Carlism not as a fixed doctrine but rather as a dynamic approach.Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 197-8 Key elements of this strategy were highlighting two pillars of the movement's ideological toolset: unswerving loyalty to the Carlist dynastywhen assuming his duties Pascual highlighted his total loyalty to the Borbon-Parmas (Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 59-60); he kept highlighting dynastic issues when commenting on ongoing events like Ley Organica referendum (El Pensamiento Navarro 15.12.66, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 88-9) or Montejurra gatherings (El Pensamiento Navarro 25.04.66, 03.05.67, 25.04.68, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 213-7), Following expulsion of the Borb√≥n-Parmas Pascual did his utmost to underline all calls for reverting the decision (El Pensamiento Navarro 22.12.68, 25.12.68, 28.12.69, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 172-4, 226-7), and welcomed the official nomination of Juan Carlos as the future king of Spain with deafening silence (El Pensamiento Navarro 23.07.69, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 177-9) and to the Church.Pascual consistently kept highlighting democratic and pro-social threads of Vaticanum II and focused on work of hierarchs launching own social initiavies, like Josef-Leon Cardijn. When democratic and progressive stand of the Spanish espiscopate generated a phenomenon of Right-wing anti-clericalism, Pascual stood by the hierarchs (Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 301-303, 316-7). His genuine and profound Catholicism was demonstrated during religious feasts, when El Pensamiento Navarro used to splash slogans like Viva Cristo Rey across all the columns, see e.g. El Pensamiento Navarro 27.10.68, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 313 As the former was getting dominated by Don Carlos Hugo and the latter were undergoing transformation adopted at Vaticanum II, the strategy worked as a trap for conservatively-minded readers; it also served as a springboard to advance increasingly Left-wing ideas. El Pensamiento Navarro (issue from the post- Pascual period) Apart from mobilizing support for the Borb√≥n-Parmasbacking the Borb√≥n-Parmas resulted in constand clashes with ABC, the pro-Juanist Madrid daily, which systematically downplayed all information related to Carlism, Don Javier or Don Carlos Hugo, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 164-8, 201, 211, 233-237, 347-391 and for labor-related changes embraced by the Church,at one point El Pensamiento Navarro has even declared itself a \\"syndicalist newspaper\\", El Pensamiento Navarro 21.01.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 103; the daily voiced in favor of a new Ley Sindical which would empower Catholic trade unions, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 120-144 other key thread of the newspaper was support for de-centralised organisation of state;the article ¬°Viva Guip√∫zcoa Foral! produced administrative measures against the newspaper, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 287-9. In line with the Orthodox Carlist understanding, Pascual confessed love for \\"las Espa√±as\\" (not \\"Espa√±a\\"), El Pensamiento Navarro 15.07.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 245 this, however, has never amounted to endorsing separatism of peripheral nationalisms, which Pascual vehemently opposed.Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 249, 336; he declared that \\"el separatismo es rid√≠culo\\" and that \\"el racismo es anticristiano\\", Errea Iribas 2007, p. 273. In 1968 Pascial supported Estado de Excepci√≥n in Gipuzkoa, El Pensamiento Navarro 09.06.68, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 309-10, even to the point of viewing Generalitat a result of extremism, El Pensamiento Navarro 19.04.66. He acknowledged Basque nationalist vandalism affecting Traditionalist monuments as cowardice and barbarity, El Pensamiento Navarro 24.03.67, 11.04.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 307 Though supportive of creeping democratization,e.g. advocating \\"monarqu√≠a popular\\" ( Errea Iribas 2007, p. 84) or supporting Carlist deputies from Tercio Familiar and the entire Cortes Trashumantes sittings (Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 92-120) Pensamiento avoided open challenge of either Franco or Francoismsome authors claim that \\"durante su labor al frente de la publicaci√≥n [Pascual] se hab√≠a mostrado muy cr√≠tico con el sistema franquista\\", Ferm√≠n P√©rez-Nievas Borderas, Contra viento y marea. Historia de la evoluci√≥n ideol√≥gica del carlismo a trav√©s de dos siglos de lucha, Pamplona 1999, , p. 186 and ‚Äì perhaps to some extent genuinelyPascual was perfectly aware of the linguistic subtleties involved. In 1961 he published an article, which was a laboratory and ice-cold analysis of Francoist language employed with regard to the 1936-1939 events; specifically, it focused on linguistic manipulations aimed at promoting the term \\"cruzada\\" and denying existence of a \\"civil war\\", see Javier Mar√≠a Pascual, Criba y comentarios: negaci√≥n y defensa del 18 de julio como cruzada, [in:] Punta Europa 62 (1961), pp. 112-123 ‚Äì boasted fidelity to \\"the spirit of July 18th\\".El Pensamiento Navarro was many times hailing \\"Jefe del Estado, General Franco, que supo conducir a la victoria al Ej√©rcito Nacional, a los heroicos Tercios de Requet√©s, a las tambi√©n heroicas Banderas de Falange\\", adding also that \\"queremos reafirmar nuestra fe en los principios de aqu√©l 18 de julio de 1936\\", see e.g. El Pensamiento Navarro 01.10.67, quoted after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 170 Calls for liberalization were styled as defense of the very regime,see e.g. shielding the new press law from critique of foreign commentators, El Pensamiento Navarro 09.04.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 114 official auto-denomination of the state as \\"Monarqu√≠a Trad√≠cional, Cat√≥lica, Social y Representativa\\" was repeated ad nauseam,see e.g. El Pensamiento Navarro 31,05,66 or 20.08.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 161 and Franco's own words were often quoted when presenting Carlism as representation of \\"la Espa√±a ideal, frente a la bastarda y afrancesada de los liberales\\".El Pensamiento Navarro 22.02.66 or 01.10.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 159 The regime identified Pensamiento as subversive,according to Pascual El Pensamiento Navarro was the most read newspaper among the Madrid central offices employees, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 63 though it applied few inconclusive measures.after introduction of the so- called Ley Fraga in 1966 the censorship office was left rather toothless. It intervened a number of times with regard to El Pensamiento Navarro, but apart from correspondence exchange no repressive measures can be identified (see e.g. \\"Director General de la Prensa ha ordenado la iniciaci√≥n de expediente administrativo al Director del Diario El Pensamiento Navarro\\", Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 337-347). Most interventions seem related to Basque and Catalan issues. Another author identifies 7 cases, raised by the censorship office, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 332 The boldest one was a 46-day exile in Riaza,Pascual spent his time in Riaza in a hotel and under friendly tutelage of Adolfo Suarez, at that time Civil Governor of the Segovia Province (which Riaza formed part of), Errea Iribas 2007, p. 260, Nevertheless, some commentators refer to Pascual‚Äôs fate in Riaza as \\"gulag\\", see Hoja Oficial de Lunes 06.10.80, available here administered versus Pascual in early 1969.following student and Basque unrest the State of Exception was introduced in all Spain on January 24, 1969, Stanley G. Payne, The Franco regime, London 1987, , p. 521. Pascual was detained on February 7 on orders of the Navarrese Civil Governor, and administered residence in Riaza, Martorell P√©rez 2014, p. 257, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 253 and passim. No specific charges were raised, though the key motive supposed were Pascual‚Äôs contacts with HOAC, the increasingly restless Catholic trade unions, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 263. The exile term expired automatically with the end of Estado de Excepci√≥n on March 25, 1969, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 286. Another picturesque measure was adopted against Pascual and other Carlists, travelling on a chartered plane from Seville to Biarritz to celebrate the 80th birthday of the Carlist king Don Javier in May 1969; the aircraft was made to land at Fuenterabia and all those on board were prevented from crossing the frontier, Martorell P√©rez 2014, pp. 258-9 More fateful were differences with the Traditionalists controlling Editorial Navarra, a front company which owned the newspaper. Though there were no public clashes between Pascual and the board in 1966-1968,Errea Iribas 2007, p. 209. During his Riaza exile Pascual was visited by the leader of Navarrese Traditionalists Joaqu√≠n Baleztena, who pledged to intervene in his favor, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 262 key Traditionalist pundits used to challenge Pascual's line from the very onset.already in 1966 it was Rafael Gambra, who noted \\"marxismo que se va introduciendo y ante el que deb√≠a batallar, especialmenta, su peri√≥dico\\"; further on he admitted \\"prepcupaci√≥n por una postura seria y consciente del peri√≥dico, a favor del progresismo injustificiado\\", El Pensamiento Navarro 18.06.66. Pascual responded by claiming he strictly followed Vatican, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 303-4. In 1968 another Traditionalist intellectual, Francisco El√≠as de Tejada, embarked on a somewhat veiled polemics by confronting traditional Navarrese foral sense of liberty with a revolutionary liberty, El Penamiento Navarro 15.11.68, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 224-5. Note that Pascual allowed the articles of his critics to appear in print In the late 1960s he was already considered one of threewith Zabala and Clemente \\"prohombres del neocarlismo socialista\\", who presided over transformation towards Marxism.Robert Vallverd√∫ i Mart√≠, La metamorfosi del carlisme catal√†: del \\"D√©u, P√†tria i Rei\\" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975), Barcelona 2014, , p. 210 Following printing of declaration issued by Catholic syndicates,jointly named Movimientos Obreros Cristianos (and divided into HOAC, VOS and JOC) which in name of \\"the working class\\" lambasted \\"unjust and inhuman capitalist system\\",El Pensamiento Navarro 26.04.70, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 391-395 in the spring of 1970 Pascual was officially admonished by the managing board;\\"for some time we have noted that the periodical deviated from Traditionalist ideas towards biased and leftist path\\" (\\"desde hace alg√∫n tiempo hemos notado en el peri√≥dico una desviaci√≥n de las ideas tradicionalistas en sentido tendencioso e izquierdista\\"), Errea Iribas 2007, p. 396, Josep Carles Clemente, Historia del Carlismo contemporaneo 1935‚Äì1972, Barcelona 1977, , p. 66. The official Carlist executive immediately protested the Editorial Navarra statement and demanded that the board members step down in July that year Editorial Navarra terminated Pascual's employment contract.on 23.07.70, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 407, P√©rez-Nievas Borderas 1999, p. 186. Members of the Editorial Navarra board refused to backtrack under pressure from the Hugocarlistas; their leader, Joaqu√≠n Baleztena, declared that they were entrusted with ensuring that El Pensamiento Navarro does not deviate from Traditionalist course (indeed in the late 1930s Editorial Navarra was set up as a front company to spare amalgamtion of the newspaper into the Francoist propaganda machine) and that this is exactly what they do, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 411. The party executive responded that it was not up to the board to decide what constituted violation of fidelity to Traditionalist principles and expulsed almost all (mostly members of the Baleztena family) board members from the Carlist structes, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 410, Clemente 1977, pp. 68-69 Back in Madrid: politics and around Carlos Hugo and his wife, 1978 Pascual's dismissal came as a heavy blow for the Hugocarlistas; under his guidance El Pensamiento Navarro was \\"instrumental for a new Carlist evolution\\"Jordi Canal, El carlismo, Madrid 2000, , p. 374 (the author wrongly claiming that Pascual headed Pensamiento since 1967). Pascual‚Äôs work was greatly appreciated by the Carlist king Don Javier. At the 1970 christening of his grandson he thanked Pascual personally and admitted that \\"todas las ma√±anas me dais los buenos d√≠as. Cuando llega el correo digo siempre: dejad a un lado las cartas, que quiero El Pensamiento Navarro\\", El Pensamiento Navarro 15.02.70, quoted after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 371 and together with few minor periodicalsthe other two were Montejurra and Esfuerzo Com√∫n constituted a propaganda ram of the Progressists.Olcina 2007, p. 11 The faction immediately launched a counter- strike; they attempted to remove the Traditionalists from Editorial Navarra board, orchestrated a wave of protest letters and engineered boycott of the newspaper; the campaign climaxed in a bombing attempt.the attempt was claimed by and is usually attributed to Grupos de Acci√≥n Carlista, compare Clemente 1977, p. 70, though at some stage also ETA claimed responsibility, see ABC 02.01.06, available here All that proved fruitless and El Pensamiento Navarro was re-claimed by the Traditionalists, their last and ephemeral victory in the struggle to control the party; at that time the Carlist structures were already firmly dominated by the Hugocarlistas. Apart from minor role in an advisory Carlist propaganda body,in late 1968 Pascual was appointed one of 14 members of a newly set up body, Consejo Nacional de Prensa del Carlismo, advisory to Junta Suprema. Although due to his position in Pensamiento he was standing head and shoulders above all Carlists involved in the printed media, Pascual was not offered presidency, which went to Juan Jos√© Pe√±a Iba√±ez; Manuel Cerezales was vice-president, Clemente secretario and Alfonso Carlos Fal vice-secretary, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 133 Pascual held no political positions either in Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista or in a 1970-created Hugocarlista organisation, Partido Carlista.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 265 He was also no ideologue and no rally-type speaker;he did not take part in public rallies and has never spoken at Montejurra, see the list of speakers in Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 302-3 his role was chiefly about managing the faction's propaganda campaign and as such is classified as representative of \\"sector m√°s abierto del Carlismo\\".Errea Iribas 2007, p. 344 Having left Pamplona and taken up employment in state-ran media company Pascual no longer was an asset for the party. Moreover, he developed doubts about a militantly left-bound and decreasingly religious course adopted by Partido Carlista.e.g. Jos√© Zabala claimed that Carlism did not need social teaching of the Church because it had its own, Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Rod√≥n Guinjoan, Invierno, primavera y oto√±o del carlismo (1939-1976) [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 405 Though earlier he praised the party ideologue, Pedro Jos√© Zabala, as \\"carlista sin lastres inncecesarios\\",Rod√≥n Guinjoan 2015, p. 406 he later nurtured some second thoughtsCaspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 75 and corresponding with the old-time party leader Manuel Fal tended to accept at least some criticism.late 1970, commenting to Fal on memorandum of Jes√∫s Evaristo Casariego, which defined Carlism as anti-capitalist but also anti- marxist, he noted \\"me preocupa honradamente el hecho de que en algunos panfletos o memorandums ‚Äì como el de Casariego, pintoresco personaje ‚Äì pueda haber algo de cr√≠tica aprovechable, que nosotros debieramos traducir en autoconfesi√≥n\\", Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 138, compare also his letter to Fal critical about Partido Carlista, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 197 As a result, Pascual's relationship with Partido Carlista deteriorated, especially that co-managing a state-ran news agency in the early 1970s he could not afford demonstrating radical political sympathies. None of the sources consulted provides any information on Pascual's involvement in Partido Carlista electoral efforts of the transici√≥n. In 1976 he might have been involved in Progressist seizure of Carlist historical memorabilia.until the mid-1960s the Baleztena family ran a private museum of Carlism; most items on display were deposited by various individuals. From the late 1960s the collection was held by the Baleztenas and presented at various one-off displays. In 1976, following one of such events, the collection was stored in a house of Pascual's relatives in Sanguesa. During a night a team of people arrived and snatched the collection, which later emerged in possession of Partido Carlista. The Baleztenas sued but lost the case in court, Diario de Navarra 28.08.85 The last time he was identified as supporting Don Carlos Hugo was in 1978, when Pascual took part in Jornadas Carlistas de la Prensa in Madrid.Hoja Oficial del lunes 20.11.78, available here Juan Carlos, 1984 The late 1970s and the early 1980s marked full Pascual's integration within the public realm of post-Francoist Spain. In 1979 he entered the executive of Asociaci√≥n de la Prensa de MadridHoja Oficial del lunes 15.01.79, available here and ‚Äì perhaps as a great fan of bullfightingABC 22.08.78, available here ‚Äì was appointed head of its Comisi√≥n de Festejos.Hoja Oficial del lunes 02.07.79, available here Taking part in a number of corporative debatesespecially the one of the early 1980s related to status of Hoja Oficial del lunes, the only daily permitted to appear on Mondays and owned by Asociaci√≥n de Prensa, Hoja Oficial del lunes 06.10.79, available here; monopoly of the paper was challenged by a new daily named Diario16, and conflict with this periodical soon spilled over to cover also the question of covering the attempted coup of 1981; corporative press organisations charged Diario16 with publishing speculations about journalists who might have participated in the plot, see Hoja Oficial del lunes 25.10.82, available here; in 1983 he grew to vice-secretary of AdP.Hoja Oficial del lunes 25.04.83, available here His career in the Asociaci√≥n came to an abrupt end in 1984, marking also completion of his dynastical U-turn. Protesting against what he perceived as a TVE insult to king Juan Carlos, he resigned from all functions in the corporative associationthe official Spanish broadcaster, TVE, ignored the bullfight organized in Madrid by Asociaci√≥n de Prensa and Pascual personally as head of its Comisi√≥n de Festejos, even though the event was attended by king Juan Carlos, and decided to broadcast another bullfight taking place at the same time in Albacete, ABC 10.07.84, available here, also ABC 09.07,84, available here. Pascual‚Äôs dynastical U-turn from Carlism to Juanism was even more visible as ABC, the Juanista newspaper he continuously confronted in the late 1960s, started to hail him as \\"one of most prestigious men of Spanish journalism\\", ABC 10.07.84, available here \\\\- which did not prevent him from nurturing \\"gran sentimiento\\" towards the memory of his former Carlist monarch, Don Javier.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 443. Until his death Pascual kept collecting and editing wartime letters of Requetes from Sanguesa; he intended to publish them, the task he did not live to complete, Pablo Larraz And√≠a, V√≠ctor Sierra-Ses√∫maga Ariznabarreta, Requet√©s: de las trincheras al olvido, Madrid 2011, , p. 24 What did not change was Pascual's opposition to Basque separatism.presented among \\"personalidades navarras\\", in 1979 Pascual protested Herri Batasuna designs on Navarre and claimed that \\"Navarra es el mismisimo quicio de Espa√±a\\", ABC 19.08.79, available here Though he fully supported new democratic media legislation,Hoja Oficial del lunes 12.05.80, available here in the late 1980s Pascual publicly demonstrated some unease about what he considered blasphemous threads in the free Spanish media.ABC 03.03.88, available here Agencia EFE EFE logotype Upon return to Madrid Pascual was employed in the central office of Agencia EFE, the official Spanish news agency.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 443 It is not clear what his role in the company structures was in the early 1970s; according to one source he worked as redactor-jefe, a senior editor responsible for news released during his shift. Already at that time he was a respected figure in the world of Madrid media; in 1973 he was among the first ones to move into the co-called Ciudad de los Periodistas, a complex of five high-rise residential buildings commissioned by Asociaci√≥n de la Prensa, in the 21st century still dubbed \\"the best place to live in Madrid\\".Alvaro Santamar√≠a, Ernest Hothorn, Ciudad de los Periodistas: El mejor sitio para vivir en Madrid, [in:] asesorator service 25.05.07 As Pascual was redactor-jefe during the night Franco died, it was he who determined how the news was disseminated.V√≠ctor Olmos, Historia de la Agencia EFE: El Mundo en Espa√±ol, Madrid 1997, , see especially Part IV, Chapter 36, Franco ha muerto, pp. 389‚Äì400 At unspecified time though prior to mid-1979 he rose to executive of Secci√≥n de Informaci√≥n Nacional and subdirector of the entire agency;ABC 19 August 1979, Martorell P√©rez 2014, p. 303 in 1981 he was nominated manager of national section of EFE. In the early 1980s EFE created Departamento del Espa√±ol Urgente (DEU), a sub-unit dedicated mostly to quality assurance; its focus was on language and style used by the agency, with three key tasks specified.\\"1) Procurar que el periodismo, en sus formas oral y escrita, emplee un idioma correcto, aceptable y normalizado en todas sus manifestaciones. 2) Contribuir, por este medio, a la defensa y unidad del espa√±ol en todos los pa√≠ses de lengua espa√±ola. 3) Resolver con la m√°xima rapidez los problemas que plantea a los profesionales la adopci√≥n de neologismos y evitar la invasi√≥n indiscriminada, con vistas a que la soluci√≥n propuesta, una vez aceptada por la Comisi√≥n Asesora, sea sancionada por la RAE y la Asociaci√≥n de la Lengua\\", Javier Mar√≠a Pascual, Alberto G√≥mez Font, Pedro Garc√≠a Dom√≠nguez, El Departamento de Espa√±ol Urgente, tareas y programas, [in:] El idioma espa√±ol en las agencias de prensa, Madrid 1990, p. 105 Pascual was nominated head of DEU; at this job he shaped its modus operandi and prioritized work, presiding over Comisi√≥n PermanenteFund√©u-BBVA: el largo brazo de la RAE en los medios, [in:] Addenda & Corrigenda 09.05.12, available here and co-operating with Comisi√≥n Asesora. It is not clear whether, apart from typical managerial tasks, his role was also about providing actual linguistic and editorial expertise;the experts tasked with day-to-day assessment were Pedro Garc√≠a Dom√≠nguez, Alberto G√≥mez Font and Carlos Ramirez Dampierre (since 1988 Pilar Vicho Toledo), Franz Lebsanft, Spanische Sprachkultur: Studien zur Bewertung und Pflege des √∂ffentlichen Sprachgebrauchs im heutigen Spanien, Tubingen 1997, , pp. 188 however, he clearly emerged as leader of a unit set up as high authority on Spanish language, with normative role across EFE branches worldwidesince 1981 the usual Manual de estilo, issued periodically by EFE, were replaced by Manual de espa√±ol urgente, Lebsanft 1997, p. 195 and exercising influence on the entire Hispanic realm.Lebsanft 1997, pp. 188, 223 At this position Pascual tackled heterogeneity of Spanish as used worldwide and led the drive to introduce a global standard, to be shaped mostly by Madrid and adopted across all Hispanic community.compare one of the objectives of DEU: \\"contribuir, por este medio, a la defensa y unidad del espa√±ol en todos los pa√≠ses de lengua espa√±ola\\", Pascual, Garc√≠a Dom√≠nguez, G√≥mez Font 1990, p. 105 hq (2nd from right), Madrid Pascual continued as one of EFE subdirectors and head of DEU across the 1980s. Due to his role he interfaced with a number of institutions, including Real Academia Espa√±ola, e.g. when championing his homogeneity drive and attempting to set up Fundaci√≥n para la Defensa de la Lengua Espa√±ola;Silvia Senz Bueno, El largo brazo de la RAE en los medios, [in:] Rebeli√≥n 9 May 2012, available here he also took part in a number of linguistic and educational initiatives. Apart from having been responsible for periodical updates of EFE's Manual of Style, he edited and co-edited a number of EFE publications,Pascual, Garc√≠a Dom√≠nguez, G√≥mez Font 1990, pp. 99-121 the best-known of them El neologismo necesario (1992).Javier Mar√≠a Pascual, Alberto G√≥mez Font, Pedro Garc√≠a Dom√≠nguez, Pilar Vicho Toledo (eds.), El neologismo necesario, Madrid 1992, For reasons which are not clear in 1992 he ceased as head of the unit, at that time renamed Departamento de Control de Publicaci√≥n y An√°lisis de Estilo of EFE. The motive might have been his poor health; in 1994 he was already noted for frequent absence on sittings of the EFE boards.Carlos G. Reigosa (ed.), El idioma espa√±ol en el deporte, Madrid 1994, p. 251. It is not clear whether Pascual's ailing health was anyhow related to a serious car accident he suffered in Pamplona in 1967. A car he drove collided with a truck and Pascual sustained very heavy injuries. Academic Facultad de Ciencias de la Informaci√≥n, Complutense Already in Pamplona in the late 1960s Pascual tried his hand as an academic; his old-time mentor Mass√≥, at that time teaching at the Opus Dei managed Universidad de Navarra, arranged for Pascual to be invited to give lectures at Escuela de Periodismo, a freshly established section of the university.Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 62, 358 The co-operation was terminated once Pascual left Navarre, though rumors about the Opus Dei link continued.Lavard√≠n 1976, p. 102 Once in Madrid he decided to upgrade his scientific credentials and commenced doctoral research, with focus on media in works of the Second Vatican Council. The thesis, written under the guidance of Pedro Lombard√≠aErrea Iribas 2007, p. 362 and titled Trayectoria doctrinal del Concilio Vaticano II sobre la comunicaci√≥n y sus medios, was accepted cum laude at Universidad Complutense in 1973.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 443. Some sources wrongly claim that he wrote the thesis in the late 1950s, compare El Pa√≠s 14.12.98, available here.

He established the Sant'Onofrio church in Rome where he was later buried. He became a friend to both Pope Eugene IV and Pope Nicholas V. His beatification received formal approval from Pope Clement XIV on 27 August 1771 after the pontiff acknowledged the fact that there was a local 'cultus' - or popular devotion - to the late religious that endured since his death. Life Tomb in the church he himself founded. Nicola da Forca Palena was born in a modest house in Forca - in Chieri - on 10 September 1349 to devout and modest parents. On the previous day, 9 September 1349, a devastating earthquake had struck the region and the surrounding areas. He became a professed member of the Third Order of Saint Francis and became noted for penitential acts and those austere methods that defined his life. He undertook a pilgrimage to Rome where he visited the tombs of each of the apostles and there felt a call to lead a more austere mode of life. He decided to join several companions to live the life of solitude that the group craved and so he decided to retire to a hermitage. He moved to one such place in Rome and later moved to another one in Naples before returning to Rome once more in 1419. He founded the Santa Maria della Grazie hermitage in Sperlonga in Naples and a hospice at the square of Sant'Agnello. Nicola attended the Jubilee in 1400 that Pope Boniface IX presided over. Nicola served as the curate to the Sant'Antonio church in Palena in 1379. He later met Pietro Gambacorta and the pair founded the Poor Hermits of Saint Jerome in Rome. Pope Eugene IV later heard of his reputation for holiness and so entrusted him to the direction of several convents in Florence in 1434 and in 1437; the same pontiff would later issue full papal approval to the order he and Gambacora founded together in 1446 after Pope Martin V had issued the initial approval in 1421. Nicola also founded the Sant'Onofrio church in Rome in 1439. Construction funds came from various donors including Cardinal Gabriele Condulmer - the future Pope Eugene IV. Nicola died on 1 October 1449 and his remains were interred in the church that he himself established. His remains were laid out for just under a week for the faithful and he was then buried under the floor of the church. His friend Pope Nicholas V dictated the sepulchral inscription. His remains were then moved to the main altar in 1712 where it now rests. The Poor Hermits of Saint Jerome was dissolved under Pope Pius XI on 12 January 1933. Sant'Onofrio became a titular see for cardinals since 1519 when Pope Leo X elevated it and it included three pontiffs such as Pope Innocent XI. The church - since 1945 - has been the headquarters of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Beatification The beatification process culminated on 27 August 1771 after Pope Clement XIV issued a formal decree that ratified the fact that there existed a spontaneous and enduring local 'cultus' - otherwise known as popular veneration - to the late friar. Since 14 March 1638 - under the directive of Pope Urban VIII - he has been the patron of both Forca - his hometown - and Palena.

Thomas is the first female African-American orthopedic surgeon in the United States. She attended Medical School at Johns Hopkins University. She was the first African-American and woman to be admitted to the Yale Medical Program in orthopedics. She strives to increase the number of minority students in medical school and to help decrease racial bias in the healthcare industry. While in her undergrad at Vassar College she helped form the Students' Afro-American Society (SAS), whose members pushed for the creation of a Black Studies program at the college. She has overcome kidney failure which was exacerbated by a hurricane and is a cancer survivor.  Early life  Claudia Lynn Thomas was born in Brooklyn and raised in Queens, New York, by her parents, Charles and Daisy Thomas, and with her older sister, Catharine Thomas. Growing up, Thomas believed her parents were her biggest motivators. Her father, Charles, worked multiple jobs during the depression, and eventually became a welder in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Thomas was also inspired by her childhood pediatrician, Pearl Foster, MD, an African-American woman. In spite of the fact that Thomas' parents were denied higher education, that did not stop them from mentoring children in the neighborhood. Church was also a priority, and provided the family their spiritual guidance. Daisy and Charles ensured that Thomas and her sister would become successful.  Education  Education has always been a very important aspect of Thomas' life. Before she and her sister started kindergarten, their mother taught them their letters and numbers. Thomas attended the High School of Music and Art in New York City. She had high enough test scores that allowed her to be awarded a National Merit Scholarship and New York Regent Scholarship. For her undergraduate degree, Thomas enrolled in Vassar College as a math major; however, she graduated and earned her degree in Black Studies. Thomas attended Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and completed her residency at the Yale University Orthopedic Program, making her the first woman to graduate from the program. Thomas is also the first female African American Orthopedic surgeon in the United States.  Career  Thomas commenced her orthopedic residency at Yale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Connecticut in 1975. In 1980, Thomas completed a fellowship at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore in the shock trauma unit. In 1981, she went on to serve as assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore Maryland. In 1991, Thomas earned a position on the Maryland medical Licensure board as a part-time consultant. In 2004, Thomas joined a private practice at the Tri County Orthopedic Center in Leesburg, Florida.  Social impact  While attending Vassar College, Thomas helped create the Students‚Äô Afro-American Society on campus. The Students' Afro-American Society held seminars on black oriented issues on campus. The SAS pushed for the college to create a Black Studies Major even though the funding for the program was not guaranteed for renewal. The SAS did succeed in getting a Black Studies Major created after they staged a takeover of Vassar‚Äôs main building in October, 1969. The takeover lasted for three days until the college gave in and created a Black Studies Major and promised to hire more black professors. The program brought leading faculty members to the school and offered a six-week trip to Africa. While on the faculty at Johns Hopkins University of Medicine, she helped recruit the largest number of minorities and women to train in orthopedics at Johns Hopkins. Thomas was awarded the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons Diversity Award in 2008 for her efforts in improving diversity within her field and for mentoring and being a role model. Thomas currently mentors middle school aged boys with her peers in Leesburg, Florida.

From a very early age onwards, he became acquainted with painting. He maintains that the confrontation with Jean Fouquet's painting \\"Madonna surrounded by seraphim's and cherubim's\\" at the Museum of Fine Arts (Antwerp) altered his view on reality. A different kind of reality became tangible at that instant.2016, Reflections of another mind, p. 4, de Bogaard, Sint Truiden, Belgium Weidenbaum's work cannot define as little style elements or constants. It is rather an exploration into our culture of images and the materialization of thoughts within the context of art. We look with our brain. This is the starting point of his exploration of images; whether it shows itself in sculpture, in an installation or painted on canvas. Weidenbaum's work is a reaction to the dictatorship of reality and a quest for the metaphysical.Frank Snyders, J. Swinnen, E. Van den Eynden, 1999, 'Bouillon', p, 64‚Äì70, HISK, Goff, Ghent, Belgium Education In 1993, Weidenbaum enrolled in The Royal Academy in Antwerp and at the behest of Walter Villain, studies Monumental Art. During his time there, he seeks inspiration from literature: Sartre, Goethe, Jung shape his thoughts. This leads to the series \\"Greetings from Faust\\" and a string of works by the poet Paul van Ostaijen. The German expressionists Max Beckmann and George Grosz have a significant influence on the young artist, despite the generational difference. In 2014 the public broadcast service showed a two-series documentary concerning the 350th anniversary of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp (KASK). In \\"Stream of Talent,\\" such diverse artists like Fred Bervoets, Jan Fabre, Luk Tuymans, Cindy Wright and Peter Weidenbaum reminisce about their time at the KASK. Situating and work In 1996, at the suggestion of artist Guillaume Bijl, Weidenbaum successfully applied for a training course at the Higher Institute for Fine Arts (HISK).T. De Mette, 2015, 'The Institute' p. 498-499, HISK, Publishers Lannoo, Tielt, Belgium His investigations into images lead to a cross-pollination between cartoon films and sculptural work. In 1999 he received an invitation from Stijn Huijts, director of the Civic Museum \\"Het Domein\\" in Sittard, The Netherlands. This results in his first museum exhibition with the installation \\"Somebody puts something in my dreams.\\" During this period, Weidenbaum also produces a few \\"fake reality\\" short films in which his brother plays the lead role. After his HISK period, he works for three years on a series \\"Out of the Forest,\\" a set of cryptic sculptures,S. Vanderstichelen, 2014, Health: something of value, p.126-127, RIZIV, IN-depth, Antwerp, Belgium drawings, and paintings. During this period, Weidenbaum strikes up a close contact with the philosopher Willem Elias, who remarks the following about the series: \\"Weidenbaum reflects about the world surrounding him. He takes us into the forest. No jolly walkabout but bewitched approaches confuse our sight.\\" In his book \\"Aspects of Belgian art beyond ‚Äò45\\",W; Elias, 2008, ‚ÄòAspecten van de Belgische kunst deel II', p. 150-151, 154, Snoeck, Ghent, Belgium, he later cites Weidenbaum under the heading of \\"neosymbolism,\\" a particular style in Flanders labeled as \\"the school of Antwerp\\" and of which Luc Tuymans is the most prominent representative. Elias mentions \\"recontextualization\\" of reality and includes Weidenbaum in his book, besides the likes of Ronny Delrue and Koen van den Broek.S. Vanderstichelen, 2009, Fading, p. 138-139, Snoeck, Ghent, Belgium, Weidenbaum continues to reflect about the function of the artist and reaches the conclusion that an artist as merely a producer of work doesn't make much sense if there is no social dimension connected with it. This is because the artist through his work illustrates a different vision of reality and because of this enriches the spectator's experience.W. Elias, A. Kindekens, 2009, 'Het zelfde en het andere', p. 92-95, Unie Vrijzinige Verenigingen, ASP Editions, Brussels, Belgium, Exhibitions With the display \\"Daswald,\\" Antwerp 2004 and the project \\"Lookout,\\"S. Vanderstichelen, 2005, Lookout, Skin, Tienen, Belgium Tienen 2005, he emerges from creative isolation. The \\"Lookout\\" project involves the construction of a hunting pulpit with students from a technical college. The shooting platform is constructed to a very high standard and placed in a pedestrianized shopping street. This project conducts in close collaboration with the writer, the curator, the artist, the students who help him build the hunting pulpit, the spectator. On the other hand, the different locations: the pedestrianized shopping street, the gallery, and the museum. Weidenbaum interacts and tears them out of their context. The students constructing the hunting pulpit with him, become part of his artistic process. He extracts their activity out of the school structure and involves them in his creative activity. Curator Sven Vanderstichelen has this to say about the \\"lookout out of the box\\": \\"the ‚Äòlookout‚Äô project is not merely an installation, a video, a sketch or a painting. It‚Äôs a search for what Peter Weidenbaum so aptly names as ‚Äòthe inner forest.' The place where every interactive process between the outside world and the self is getting interpreted.\\" In 2006, at the request of Het Beschrijf, Weidenbaum collaborated on an artistic project \\"Po√´zie\\"B. Neervoort, 2009, Cahier, p. 34-37, Het beschrijf, Vrijdag, Brussels, Belgium, in the city of Brussels. Using the title 'Passing by,' Peter Weidenbaum develops a multifaceted symbolism that corresponds to his artistic expression. He describes his intervention as an infiltration in the Montgomery district and creates a walking route where his paintings of recognizable city scenes are showed in surprising locations. It demonstrates the picture of a dignitary in a night shop and a painting of an independent immigrant in the embassy. This provides food for thought for the inhabitants of the district. He publishes a newspaperA. Vanderscheuren, 2006, Montgomery, Het beschrijf, Vers Brussel, Brussels, Belgium where the painted cityscapes show in combination with a poem by Agnieszka Kuciak, a Polish poet and different interviews with local inhabitants. This congruence of systems of signs finalizes with a sculpture on Montgomery Square. He designs a very high lifeguard chair in stainless steel on a concrete slab in which one may read a poem of Kuciak.P; Smet, 2008, In Transit, 5 jaar visuele kunst in Brussel, p. 157,159, VGC, Brussels, Belgium, This is a symbolic gesture, where Weidenbaum invites the accidental passer-by to view the city from a bird's eye view, to reflect, to take distance, to integrate a moment of peace. Weidenbaum becomes very impressed with the work of the German artist Martin Kippenberger who will have a lasting influence on him through his controversial work. Another remarkable Weidenbaum work is the artistic alter ego of the car. This damaged bronze vehicle, transformed by the artist into a sculptural aesthetic form is full of references. Transformed into an immobile piece of art, the euphoria of speed puts into question, and only the metaphor remains. For some, it is a status symbol, for others an extension of their ego, which gives them the illusion of freedom and individuality. (Flor Bex,F. Bex, 2001, Kunst in Belgie na 1975, p. 360, 380, 383, 397, Mercatorfonds, Antwerp, Belgium, Honorary Director MUHKA about \\"alter ego\\"). In 2006 Weidenbaum commences a series of paintings named \\"Out of the series Car Crash.\\" This results in the monumental sculpture \\"Alter Ego\\"J. De Nys, 2010, FAKE!, p. 128-131, Stedelijk museum, Aalst, Belgium in 2008. It is at that time that the artist begins producing artistic integrations within the architecture of public buildings. 'Green Velvet' in the Children's Psychiatric wing of the UZ Jette and 'Landscape' in Saint Agatha Berchem, in a children's day car center are both good examples of this. In both works, several universes intermingle. An abstracted landscape reconstructs in a public space. In a very urbanized environment, this becomes a landmark, an oasis for young residents. Weidenbaum attaches particular importance to a society-oriented creative process. He tries to overcome a contemporary feeling such as alienation using pictures: a common reality whereby the object itself lowers the threshold. The permanent installation \\"Passing-By\\" at Montgomery in Brussels and his sculpture \\"Alter Ego\\" create within this context.

The obverse, depicting Abraham Lincoln, was designed by Chief Engraver George T. Morgan; the reverse, based on the Seal of Illinois, was by his assistant and successor, John R. Sinnock. Morgan's obverse is based on the statue by Andrew O'Connor. A commemorative was wanted by the State of Illinois to mark the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union, and in 1918, legislation was introduced into Congress to accomplish this. It met no opposition, though several amendments were made during the legislative process. After it passed, the two engravers produced designs, but Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo required changes, not all of which were made. The coins were minted in August 1918, and were sold to the public for $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial celebrations or to help those in need because of World War I. Later writers have generally admired the coin, considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. The coin is valued in the hundreds of dollars today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.  Legislation  The State of Illinois wanted a commemorative coin to be issued for the centennial of its 1818 admission to the Union. A bill that would accomplish this, H.R. 8764, was introduced into the U.S. House of Representatives on January 16, 1918 by that state's Loren E. Wheeler. It was referred to the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures, which held hearings on March 5. Wheeler told the committee (of which he was not a member) that the coins were desired for distribution during the celebrations in Illinois. He had been to see Treasury Secretary William G. McAdoo and Mint Director Raymond T. Baker. Neither had any objection to the legislation, though McAdoo had explained that the problem with commemorative coins was that they did not sell as well as expected, and many were returned to the Mint for melting. After telling of his meeting with the officials, Wheeler explained to the committee that the coins would be purchased by the State Treasurer of Illinois and so there would be no returns. James L. Slayden of Texas asked what the cost to the federal government would be, but Wheeler did not know. Slayden asked what had been the cost for the 1916‚Äì1917 McKinley Birthplace Memorial dollar, and Ohio's William A. Ashbrook, the chairman of the committee, said that the cost of the dies had been borne by the group purchasing the coins from the government; Ashbrook proposed amending the bill to make this clear this would be an expense to be paid by Illinois. Wheeler had no objection, and stated that to avoid returns, it might be best if the issue was limited to 100,000 coins rather than the 200,000 in the original bill. Ashbrook then asked if the coins were to be sold at a premium by the centennial committee, and Wheeler denied this, indicating that they were to be circulated like any other half dollar. This concluded the public hearing on the bill, with the committee to take further action in executive session. On March 12, Ashbrook submitted a report on behalf of his committee recommending passage of the bill once it had been amended to reduce the authorized mintage from 200,000 to 100,000 and to add a statement that the United States government would not be responsible for the cost of the dies. Wheeler presented the bill on the floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked whether there had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and whether there was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote. H. R. 8742 was transmitted to the Senate, where it was referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency. That committee's chairman, Oklahoma's Robert L. Owen, reported it back with an amendment to the full Senate, where the bill was considered on May 21, 1918. The House-passed bill had said the laws relating to the minor coinage of the United States (the cent and nickel) would apply to the coin; this was changed to state that the laws relating to the subsidiary silver coinage (which the half dollar was) would apply. The bill was passed as amended without objection. Later in the day, Illinois Senator James Hamilton Lewis made a statement which was inserted in the Congressional Record at this point, applauding the passage of the honor to his home state, and noting that \\"more than a hundred thousand of her sons\\" were then being deployed to the battlefields of World War I. Since the versions the two houses had passed were not identical, the bill returned to the House of Representatives, where on May 25, Arizona's Carl Hayden successfully moved that the House agree to the Senate amendment. The Speaker, Champ Clark, felt that the title of the bill might have to be changed for reasons he did not explain, but Hayden disagreed and Clark did not press his point. The bill passed the House, and was enacted by the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on June 1, 1918.  Preparation and design  Part of the statue of Lincoln by Andrew O'Connor on the State Capitol grounds at Springfield, Illinois The designs were prepared internally in the Engraving Department at the Philadelphia Mint. The obverse design, depicting Abraham Lincoln, was created by Chief Engraver George T. Morgan. The Chief Engraver worked from a photograph of a statue of Lincoln designed by Andrew O'Connor and unveiled in Springfield (the city where Lincoln lived for much of his adult life) in August 1918. Lincoln is shown beardless, as he was when living in Illinois before he was elected president in 1860. He was chosen to be on the coin as Illinois' most famous resident. The obverse also contains the mottoes LIBERTY and IN GOD WE TRUST, as well as an inscription noting the centennial. The reverse was designed by the assistant engraver who would succeed Morgan on his death in 1925, John R. Sinnock. It is an adaptation of the Seal of Illinois, an eagle perched on a rock mound, with the rising Sun beyond it. The bird holds in its beak a scroll with the Illinois state motto, STATE SOVEREIGNTY, NATIONAL UNION and it clutches the Federal shield. An olive branch is seen, but without any arrows representing war, even though these symbols are often paired on U.S. coins. Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen suggested \\"their presence on a coin designed during the concluding months of World War I might have been considered just a bit raw\\". The reverse also bears the legends, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, E PLURIBUS UNUM (the national motto, meaning \\"out of many, one\\") and HALF DOLLAR. The reverse of the coin is based on the Seal of Illinois. Secretary McAdoo had originally rejected the submissions. Acting Mint Director Mary M. O'Reilly wrote to Philadelphia Mint Superintendent Adam M. Joyce on June 24, 1918, relaying the Treasury Secretary's concerns. McAdoo \\"specifically direct[ed]\\" that the Illinois state motto be deleted from the scroll in the eagle's beak on the reverse, to be replaced with the national one. Joyce was told to follow the provisions of the Coinage Act of 1873 requiring that on one side there be the word LIBERTY, a design emblematic of it, and the year of striking, with the other side an eagle with the name of the country and the denomination of the coin. Despite McAdoo's order, the Illinois inscription was retained on the scroll. Don Taxay, in his book on commemoratives, speculated it might have been the Illinois Centennial Commission that had insisted on this. Cornelius Vermeule felt that the use of the Sun on the Illinois coin recalled works such as the Walking Liberty half dollar (first issued 1916). Later commentators have praised the coin. Taxay deemed the obverse \\"undoubtedly the finest work Morgan ever did in his forty-eight years with the Mint. The head is not merely well drawn, there is in it a depth of feeling, and introspective mood that almost makes the observer feel he is intruding on the great man.\\" Writers on commemorative coins, including Arlie Slabaugh and David M. Bullowa, also admired the Illinois piece. Q. David Bowers deemed Sinnock's reverse \\"the finest work he ever did for a legal tender coin\\", not excluding the Roosevelt dime (1946) and Franklin half dollar (1948, posthumous). Bowers noted that the border of both sides of the coin consists of beads and pellets, \\"an attractive substitute for denticles\\". Art historian Cornelius Vermeule, in his 1971 book on the artistry of American coins and medals, wrote that \\"Morgan's interpretation has captured the restless plasticity of [O'Connor's] bust, yet another indication of the benefits for coin design of good monumental models in sculpture\\". He noted of Sinnock's reverse, \\"the little burst of sun at the right is almost a bow to the Roty‚ÄìSaint-Gaudens‚ÄìWeinman developments outside the Philadelphia Mint in American numismatic taste and iconography in the generation following 1900. Sinnock's composition can be called conventional, but the entire aura of the coin reflects American art after the Civil War, and this is perhaps truly appropriate for the only [pre-1954] commemorative coin to honor Abraham Lincoln.\\"  Production, distribution, and collecting  A total of 100,058 Illinois Centennial half dollars were struck at the Philadelphia Mint during August 1918, with the excess over the round number reserved for inspection and testing at the 1919 meeting of the annual Assay Commission. There was no official packaging; a few were used in badges for the Illinois Centennial Commission. The coins were not publicized much outside Illinois. The centennial commission distributed them, at face value, to its county affiliates in proportion to their share of Illinois' population, on condition they be sold at a premium to help pay for local celebrations, and if one had already been held, for war relief. The coins were also sold by the Springfield Chamber of Commerce at $1 each, though some were eventually vended for less: Texas coin dealer B. Max Mehl purchased several thousand at just over face value. A local bank held 30,000 of them for 15 years, and sold them during the 1933 Bank Holiday for a slight advance on par. This temporarily flooded the market, but they were absorbed during the first commemorative coin boom in 1936, though the price did not then rise from the $1.25 they had sold for since about 1925. At the height of the second commemorative coin boom in 1980, uncirculated specimens sold for about $300. The edition of R. S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins published in 2017 lists the coin for between $130 and $685, depending on condition. An exceptional specimen sold at auction in 2014 for $7,040.

There, he was tutor of Ange Laurent Lalive de Jully (1725-1779), a future as well as honorary member of the Acad√©mie royale de peinture et de sculpture.Holzhey, Helmut; Mudroch, Vilem; Ueberweg, Friedrich; Rohbeck, Johannes: Grundriss der Geschichte der Philosophie: Die Philosophie des 18. Jahrhunderts. 2 Halbbde. Schwabe-Verlag, Basel (2008) , (p. 289‚Äì290) He entered into license in 1742 at the Faculty of Theology of Paris and was an Associate in the House and Royal Society of Navarre. It was customary at the end of licenses, that the two first places went to the priors of Sorbonne, the following two to the most talented graduates and the fifth to the best student without diplomas. Mallet won fifth place unanimously. During his studies in Paris, he was also temporarily private teacher of the Fermier G√©n√©ral Louis Denis Lalive de Bellegarde (1680-1751). In 1744 he returned by his family in Melun and remained seven years. In 1747, he published an Essai sur l‚Äô√©tude des belles-lettres. After his mother's death in 1751, he moved back to Paris, and took a chair of theology at the Coll√®ge de Navarre. In 1753, he published an Essai sur les biens√©ances oratoires and Principes pour la lecture des Orateurs in three volumes. In 1754, appeared his Principes pour la lecture des Po√´tes. He also translated an Histoire de Davila which was published only after his death. He began to gather sources to address two major projects: Histoire g√©n√©rale de toutes les guerres de France de l‚Äô√©tablissement de la monarchie jusqu‚Äô√† Louis XIV and a History of the Council of Trent. For the Encyclop√©die by Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d‚ÄôAlembert, he wrote more than a thousand articles with a focus on trading (over 500 articles), theology, history (about 600 ones) and literature (200) but died of angina well before the completion of the project. These articles reported information often from already given texts and reference works. Several of his articles with historical content were revised by Nicolas Lenglet Du Fresnoy and edited by Jean-Fran√ßois Marmontel for their literary aspect.  Controversies  If Abb√© Mallet demonstrated a great erudition, his stance in theological articles and categorical tone can lead the reader to wonder why he was chosen as editor for this kind of texts, which were intended to relativize and even ridiculize religion. Indeed, Father Mallet seemed to show an orthodox mind for everything related to religion. He particularly manifested a fierce hatred for all heretical beliefs. It appears that Father Mallet was actually recommended by Jean-Fran√ßois Boyer, the Bishop of Mirepoix, a bitter enemy of the Jansenist and the Philosophes, and it is possible that Mallet was a Trojan Horse in his service. But it is also possible that he acted as a safeguard: If the Encyclop√©die in its infancy had exceeded the limits of decency of the time in religion, perhaps the project would have had later many more problems that it actually had.

It was built in 2000, nearly replicating a previous structure built on the site in 1883 and lost due to ice damage. It is one of a high concentration of covered bridges in Tunbridge and Chelsea. The 1883 bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The Mill Covered Bridge is located on the north side of Tunbridge village, where it carries Spring Road across the First Branch White River, west of Vermont Route 110. It is located among the buildings of the former Hayward and Kibby Mill, a 19th- century mill complex. It is a single-span structure, with multiple kingpost trusses resting on abutments of stone and concrete. It is long and has a total width of and a roadway width of (one lane). The trusses are reinforced by wrought iron rods, which provide lateral bracing often provided by wooden members in other bridges. The exterior consists of a metal roof and vertical board siding, the latter extending around the portals and a short way into the interior. The floor consists of planking laid parallel to the trusses on supporting stringers. with The historic bridge was built about 1883 by Arthur G. Adams, a local carpenter credited with construction of a number of Tunbridge's five surviving covered bridges. These bridges, along with another in nearby Chelsea, form a remarkable concentration of 19th-century covered bridges in the state. This bridge was severely damaged by ice floes in March 1999 and subsequently demolished. A substantially similar bridge was completed on the site the following year.

The other whorls are convex with oblique, acute, longitudinal ribs (11 in the body whorl). Three spiral lirae form nodules when crossing the ribs. The body whorl contains about 15 spiral lirae, but only the upper three are nodulose. The ribs on the body whorl are terminated inferiorly by the spiral lirations around the cauda, which are rather thicker than those on the rest of the shell. The oval aperture measures 10/23 of the total length of the shell. The short siphonal canal is recurved and inclined to the right. The anal sinus is large and deep. The columella is slightly angled and shows a callus. Distribution This marine species occurs off the Philippines. References * M.M.

Vakhushti Abashidze came from an influential princely family from Imereti, a kingdom in western Georgia. In 1711, he left a war-ridden Imereti after the downfall of his powerful uncle, Giorgi-Malakia Abashidze, and crossed into the eastern Georgian kingdom of Kartli to put himself under the suzerainty of King Vakhtang VI. On this occasion, Vakhushti Abashidze was bestowed with estates in western Kartli, belonging to the extinct line of his cousins, Princes Abashidze of Kvishkheti, and given, in 1712, King Vakhtang's daughter Anuka (1698‚Äì1746) in marriage. In his turn, the king benefited by having a new vassal, whose patrimonial estate, the village of Vakhani with its fortress, controlled one of the routes used by the Akhaltsikhe-based Turk and Lesgian marauders for their raids into western Kartli. Vakhushti Abashidze remained in Kartli even after his royal father-in-law left the upheaval in the kingdom to the Russian Empire in 1724. His relations with the Imeretian kings were strained; in 1735, the troops sent by King Alexander V of Imereti attacked Abashidze at Tedzeri and made him prisoner. Through his wife's efforts, the pasha of Akhaltsikhe intervened militarily and put Alexander to flight, but it was only in 1740 that Vakhushti Abashidze was released. In 1742, he joined the rebellion led by Prince Givi Amilakhvari against the Iranian hegemony in Kartli, which was eventually defeated through the efforts of the Georgian royal princes Teimuraz and Erekle, who would emerge, as a result, as new leaders of eastern Georgia.

He identified calcium as the principal second messenger in the coupling of neuronal activity to gene expression and characterized the processes that mediate the dialogue between the synapse and the nucleus. His work highlighted the spatial aspects of calcium signals and in particular the importance of nuclear calcium in governing activity-dependent gene expression and adaptations in the nervous system that include memory formation and acquired neuroprotection. The discovery of toxic signaling by extrasynaptic NMDA receptors that antagonizes gene regulation by synaptic activity and causes neuronal dysfunction and cell death contributed to the understanding of neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

Carbon Tracker popularized the notion of a carbon bubble, which describes the incompatibility between the continued development of fossil fuel projects and combating climate change.Jackie Wills, \\"Carbon Tracker has changed the financial language of climate change\\", The Guardian, 15 May 2014 (page visited on 8 November 2016).Katharine Earley, \\"Carbon Tracker measures oil and coal risk for investors\\", The Guardian, 30 April 2015 (page visited on 8 November 2016).  History and work  Carbon Tracker was founded by UK fund manager Mark Campanale, with Jeremy Leggett serving as chairman. The organisation's first two reportsUnburnable Carbon (2011) and Unburnable Carbon (2013)argued that up to two-thirds of the world's known reserves and resources of oil, coal and gas could not be burned while avoiding dangerous levels of climate change. As summarized by Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf: \\"The conclusion is quite simple: burning known reserves of fossil fuels is incompatible with meeting the climate targets governments have set themselves.\\" The Paris Agreement, adopted internationally in December 2015, aims to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 ¬∞C of warming, to avoid and reduce some of the most severe risks and impacts of climate change. But this requires carbon dioxide levels emitted in the atmosphere by 2050 to not exceed a \\"carbon budget\\" of up to 900 gigatonnes.Malte Meinshausen, Nicolai Meinshausen, William Hare, Sarah Raper, Katja Frieler, Reto Knutti, David Frame and Myles Allen, \\"Greenhouse- gas emission targets for limiting global warming to 2¬∞C\\", Nature, volume 458, pages 1158‚Äì1163, 2009. Drawing on research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Carbon Tracker's reports showed that the world's reserves and resources of coal, oil and gas, if burned, would emit more than three times this amount: approximately 2800 gigatonnes. This raises the possibility that, by financing the development and production of fossil fuels that might never be consumed, investors are exposed to the risk of \\"stranded assets\\", rendered unprofitable by climate regulations and technological alternatives such as renewable energy.At about that time, the carbon budget idea was plucked from academia by Carbon Tracker, a small London think-tank founded by Mark Campanale, one of the city‚Äôs first sustainable investment analysts. Applying the research to the world‚Äôs coal mines, oil wells and gasfields, the think-tank said that to have even a small chance of meeting the 2C target, only 565 gigatonnes of CO2 could be emitted up to 2050. But the known fossil fuel reserves of energy and mining companies were equal to 2,795 gigatonnes of CO2. So if the world ever took serious action to meet the 2C goal, most of those reserves would become ‚Äúunburnable‚Äù stranded assets.\\" Carney on climate: Stranded fossil fuel theory proves potent, Financial Times, 30 September 2015 Reuters described this idea ‚Äì that investors were financing a \\"carbon bubble\\" ‚Äì as having become 'part of \\"the climate change lexicon\\"; it has formed the basis for warnings about \\"stranded assets\\" by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and inspired groups like Norway's sovereign wealth fund to divest billions in fossil fuel holdings'.

It argues that even if climate-change policies severely constrain demand for oil, companies will still need to produce more of the black stuff.

Stretching 21 km (13 mi), it was a narrow gauge line. The line was constructed by the Paknam Railway Company established by a British navigator Alfred John Loftus and the Danish naval commander Andreas du Plessis de Richelieu. Construction commenced on 10 July 1891. The company was granted a 20-year concession to run the line. The opening of the railway on 11 April 1893 was attended by King Rama V who had in fact invested half of the 400,000 Baht funding required for construction of the line. Tram in Paknam station in 1959 Initially there were four steam locomotives constructed by Krauss & Co. of Munich, and four trains ran in each direction daily. There were twelve stations in all, with trains taking one hour to travel over the line. The line was initially a financial success. A motor-tramway service was introduced in 1908 and the line was electrified in 1926. After the end of the concession period, the line was purchased outright by the government in 1936 but there was little further investment in the line. By this time competition from buses running between Bangkok and Paknam was already impacting the railway's finances. During World War II the railway enjoyed a resurgence due to the impact of fuel shortages on the bus companies. Services were temporarily suspended in 1942 due to record flooding in Bangkok but services were restored soon after with twelve trips daily. After the end of World War II competition with buses and private cars again increased and by the 1950s the railway was operating at a loss. Several plans for modernisation were proposed but none were realised. In the end the Paknam Railway was closed at the end of 1959 to allow for the construction of Rama IV Road.

The historic bridge replaced an older covered bridge destroyed by Vermont's devastating 1927 floods.

Vermont 100 runs west from the junction, and then crosses the river before bending to parallel the river running further southwest. The present bridge, constructed in 2008-2009, is a steel girder bridge whose deck is integrated into its abutments. The bridge is curved to accommodate the transition from the crossing to the southwest continuation of the roadway. Historic bridges Early bridges were built on the site by the town. A covered bridge was washed away from the site by Vermont's devastating floods of 1927, which caused particularly severe damage in the White River valley. In 1929, the state retained the Berlin Construction Company to build a Pratt through truss at the site; it was built out of steel I-beams and placed on rubblestone abutments that were later reinforced with concrete footings. It was of a standardized design developed by the state in the wake of the floods to more effectively produce the many bridges requiring replacement. with See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Windsor County, Vermont *List of bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont References Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Vermont National Register of Historic Places in Windsor County, Vermont Bridges completed in 1929 Bridges in Windsor County, Vermont Buildings and structures in Stockbridge, Vermont Steel bridges in the United States Girder bridges in the United States ","title":"Stockbridge Four Corners Bridge"},{"id":"51475738","text":"Thubten Nyima Lungtok Tenzin Norbu (born 1928) is an Indian cleric who was a Ganden Tripa (spiritual head of the Gelug Buddhists) - now known as Ganden Trisur.

The reserve lies to the north of the TO-201 highway, south of the Tocantins River. History The Extremo Norte do Tocantins Extractive Reserve was created by federal decree 535 of 20 May 1992. On 9 December 2005 the Minister of the Environment appointed representatives of agencies and NGOs to elaborate the proposal for occupying the territory of the reserve. The deliberative council was created on 23 May 2011. The reserve is administered by the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). It is classed as IUCN protected area category VI (protected area with sustainable use of natural resources). Its purpose is to protect the livelihoods and culture of the traditional extractive population, and ensure the sustainable use of natural resources of the unit. Economy As of 2009 the population of the reserve was fairly young. About 25% of the population is illiterate and 32% have no more than three years of education, mostly women. About 30% of girls do not attend school but help the family in production activities. The reserve is served by health centres in the Carrasco Bonito municipal seat. The main economic activity is processing and marketing of babassu palm fruit, mainly by the women. The men cultivate rice, beans, maize and cassava, mainly for their family consumption. A 2015 study reported that after 22 years the families of the reserve still lived outside it in surrounding communities. The result had been constant competition for resources and disputes with farmers, and steady clearance of the babassu to expand pasturage for livestock.

Upon Sallie's death, Whitehead eventually married Myra Loving McGinnis, who survived him. He was active in the Episcopal Church, especially Trinity Episcopal Church in Oak Ridge, Virginia. Political career Upon admission to the Virginia bar, Whitehead tried to practice law in Lynchburg with J. Lindsey Coleman, but ultimately returned to Nelson County to practice law with his father beginning in 1921. Their office (established 1853) was on the courthouse green. Like his father and grandfather, Whitehead was elected Commonwealth Attorney of Nelson County and served from 1933-1941 (the three Whitehead prosecutors served a total of 72 years).Nelson County Historical Society Although Virginia's Byrd Organization (while also Democrats) opposed many of President Franklin Delano Rooosevelt's reforms, and especially President Harry S Truman after he abolished racial segregation in the armed forces, Whitehead served as one of the Democratic Electors for FDR's third term in 1936, and later as Virginia State Chairman of the Truman Barkley Straight Ticket Committee in 1948. He was also a director of The First National Bank of Nelson County, and active in the Ruritan club, the American Legion, and on the Executive Committee of the Virginia State Bar. A Democratic member of the House of Delegates from 1942-1960, Whitehead often opposed the Byrd Organization, which gave him poor committee assignments and often sought to marginalize him.

He succeeded as the head of the house of Abashidze and prince of Saabashidzo in Upper Imereti on the death of his father in 1658. At that time, the kingdom of Imereti was plagued by a civil war in which neighboring Georgian polities were also involved. In 1661, Abashidze allied himself with Vakhtang V, a Mukhranian king of Kartli in eastern Georgia, who pushed for the efforts to install his son Archil as king in Imereti, an endeavor which eventually ended in failure. Abashidze's influence grew during the reign of Alexander IV, whose sister Darejan, a former wife of ex-king George Gurieli, he married in 1683. Paata Abashidze became a major supporter of Alexander in a renewed civil war in 1684, when George Gurieli attempted to reclaim the crown of Imereti in alliance with Shoshita III, Duke of Racha, Giorgi Lipartiani, regent of Mingrelia, the princes Chijavadze and the nobles of Lechkhumi.

The public library began in 1902 when Judge Addison Oliver offered to buy the former Congregational Church for a library building, and funds to buy books and fixtures. with His offer was accepted by the community, which also promised to maintain the facility as a free library. The library soon outgrew the old church and in November 1906 the board of directors approached the Carnegie Corporation of New York for a grant to build a library building. A $10,000 grant was approved on December 13, 1907. Judge Oliver donated another $10,000 for the building, and an additional $10,000 for an endowment fund. The Chicago architectural firm of Patton & Miller designed the Prairie School building, which was dedicated on October 22, 1909. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. The library is a two-story brick structure built on a foundation of Sioux Falls granite that is laid as random rubble. The granite extends to the bottom of the first floor widows. The central entry is flanked by side- and toplights, and surrounded by white limestone. A curved canopy is suspended by a pair of chains over the steps. Buttress piers at the corners curve upward from the limestone water table and fade into the wall surface at the second floor. The arched windows on the first floor are surrounded by brick arches that rise from limestone impost blocks at the water table. The building is capped with a tile hipped roof.
