He came from the Beecher family, a prominent 19th century American religious family. Parents and siblings James Chaplin Beecher was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and the youngest child of Lyman Beecher and Harriet Porter Beecher. Lyman was a Presbyterian minister who became best known as a revivalist and social reformer in the years before the American Civil War. His noted half-siblings include; Harriet Beecher Stowe, famed abolitionist and author of the novel Uncle Tom’s Cabin, Catharine Beecher, noted educator and author, Henry Ward Beecher, a famous preacher and abolitionist, and Charles Beecher and Edward Beecher. His sister, Isabella Beecher Hooker, was a leader and activist in the American Suffragists movement, and his brother, Thomas K. Beecher, was a preacher and educator. Early life James was educated at Lane Theological Seminary in Walnut Hills, within Cincinnati, Ohio, of which his father was president. He entered Dartmouth College and graduated in 1848. James served for five years as ship's officer in the East India trade. After a couple of years serving a coaster which traded along the eastern U.S. coast, James took up the study of theology at Andover Theological Seminary. During his time at Andover, James married Anne Morse, a widow with a young daughter. In May, 1856, James was ordained a minister of the Congregational Church. Soon after his ordination, James and Anne left for China to be missionaries in Canton and Hong Kong. In 1859, Anne Beecher returned to America for health reasons. During a correspondence with Isabella Beecher Hooker, James admitted to his sister that Anne was suffering from drug and alcohol addiction. Anne went to Gleason’s sanitarium in Elmira, New York for their water cure treatment before she was committed to an asylum in June 1860.Van Deusen, A. (2013).

The heavy demands of leading a regiment and the increasing concerns of Anne’s health, James began to break down and briefly returned to civilian life until Anne’s death in 1863. As the war progressed, James rejoined the army and accepted the promotion of lieutenant-colonel and was appointed to recruit an African American regiment, the 1st North Carolina Colored Infantry (35th Regiment, United States Colored Infantry). The regiment would come to be called the 35th United States Colored Troops, and fought at the Battle of Olustee, Florida and Honey Hill, South Carolina.

Upon assuming the throne, he became the first Bosporan ruler to take the title of basileus, likely due to the Hellenistic kings of the time period doing the same such as the Antigonids, Lysimachids, Seleucids, and the Ptolemies. As soon as the Athenian trade was liberated from Demetrius, Spartokos quickly sought to renew his relationship with Athens, which had already been trade partners with the Bosporan Kingdom in the reign of his great-grandfather Leukon.

It is commonly served to guests and business partners at meetings and social events, and has been drunk by Arab people for centuries. It is considered to be a healthy drink largely because boiling water kills off most of the bacteria and viruses that would otherwise cause sickness, and some claim that it offers additional medicinal advantages.  Arab society  Tea is an important drink in the Arab world and is usually served with breakfast, after lunch, and with dinner. For Arabs, tea denotes hospitality, and is typically served to guests. It is also common for Arabs to drink tea with dates, which acts as a sweetener. Tea owes its popularity to its social nature; it is one of the most important aspects of hospitality and business etiquette in Arab culture. Importantly, one should not reject tea when offered, because it may be considered rude.  Varieties  There are many different types of Arabic tea: Arabic tea in Libya with peanuts Maghrebi mint tea in Morocco black tea in Tunisia * Sage () tea is typically served after a meal to aid in digestion and eliminate gas or heartburn. It has a distinct flavor, and, if brewed without black tea, is non-caffeinated. Homegrown, dried sage leaves are considered best for making sage Arabic tea. *Chamomile () tea is made by brewing dried chamomile flowers and has many health benefits, including reducing stress and anxiety, alleviating pain and discomfort, and also improving sleep and insomnia. *Anise () tea has been well known for hundreds of years. *Thyme () tea helps improve memory and cleans out the stomach. Rich in antioxidants, this tea is also useful in preventing aging from within. *Cardamom () tea is very common in the Arab world, and is known for its strong aroma. It is sometimes mixed with coffee, and is said to help digestion and increase saliva flow. It is drunk before meals to prepare digestive enzymes. Although one of the most expensive spices in the world, cardamom is still largely harvested by hand for many Arab customers. *Maghrebi mint tea (at- tāy): (; Maghrebi Arabic: at-tāy) also known as Moroccan mint tea, is a green tea prepared with spearmint leaves and sugar, traditional to the Maghreb region (the northwest African countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Mauritania). The tea was originally made by English traders and has spread in popularity throughout Africa, France, and other neighboring countries. Known for its flavor and vitality, the fresh mint used to prepare at-tāy helps to clear the palate after meals. *Mint tea () is commonly used to get over colds, a sore throat, sinus congestion, and stomach ulcers. Seasonal allergies can also be treated by drinking cups of tea containing rosemarynic acid: an anti-inflammatory agent found in mint. *Black tea () is the most common, usually the brand name Lipton. *Hibiscus () tea is drunk hot in the winter and cold in the summer. Hibiscus tea has a large amount of vitamin C. *Cinnamon tea or Kuwaiti tea () is created by putting water in a boiler together with cinnamon sticks and sugar. Cinnamon tea contains many health benefits such as bacterial resistance, diabetes treatment, protection against heart disease, and prevention of colon disorders, as well as containing many antioxidant compounds. *Dried lime tea () also known as chai noomi basra, noomi basra tea or loomi tea, is a type of herbal tea made from dried limes that is traditional to Iraq, Kuwait, Oman and United Arab Emirates.  Served  Tea in the Arab world is usually a strong dark mix, similar to the so-called \\"breakfast tea\\" served in other parts of the world. Often brewed with sugar and served in long glasses, it can also be made with mint or cardamom, or with a dash of milk. In Yemen, black tea is brewed in water and milk.Yemeni Tea. shebayemenifood.com. 05.30.2012.

He is a professor of sociology, psychology, and organizational behavior at Stanford University. He earned his Ph.D. in sociology at Cornell University. Research Robb Willer has published more than 40 scientific articles in journals such as Administrative Science Quarterly, American Journal of Sociology, American Sociological Review, Annual Review of Sociology, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London: Biological Sciences, and Psychological Science. He has received grants from the California Environmental Protection Agency, and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation, and the National Science Foundation. As of July 12, 2017, his Google Scholar h-index was 30 and his i10-index was 49, with 5,402 citations. Much of Willer's research focuses on political psychology and sociology, exploring both sources of political polarization and ways it can be reduced. He and Matthew Feinberg developed the idea of \\"moral reframing\\". Based on moral foundations theory, moral reframing is a technique of political persuasion in which a political message draws a connection between a given issue and the audience's assumed moral values. Willer's talk on political communication has been viewed over 1 million times since it was posted on the TED website January 20, 2017. Willer's other research on politics emphasizes the effects of various forms of threat and anxiety on political attitudes, for example, the effects of racial status threats, terror threats, and masculinity threats. He has studied masculine overcompensation, showing that men whose masculinity has been threatened tend to adopt more stereotypically masculine attitudes on issues like war and gay rights. His master's thesis used the text from the Sokal affair to investigate the effects of academic status on the evaluation of unintelligible academic texts, finding that unintelligible texts are evaluated more positively if authored by high status academics. He contributed research to the best-selling book Modern Romance: An Investigation, by Aziz Ansari and Eric Klinenberg. Teaching Prior to moving Stanford, Willer was an assistant professor at UC Berkeley's Sociology Department. Willer was the 2009 recipient of the Golden Apple Award for Outstanding Teaching, the only teaching award given by the UC-Berkeley student body. Media coverage Willer's research has received widespread media coverage including from the Chicago Tribune, CNN, Forbes, Huffington Post, LA Times, Nature, New York Daily News, New York magazine, NPR's Morning Edition, Pacific Standard, Salon, San Francisco Chronicle, Science, Scientific American, The Atlantic, The Daily Telegraph, The New York Times, Time, USA Today, Vox, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post.

She served as First Lady of Costa Rica from 1948 to 1949 in the years immediately following the Costa Rican Civil War. She turned 100 in May 2018.  Biography  Boggs was born in Spartanburg, South Carolina. She was the daughter of Meta Long and Ralph Emerson Boggs, a Presbyterian elder. In 1923, her family moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where her father started a construction business. After completing high school, Boggs attended Birmingham–Southern College, where she studied English and was a reporter for the student newspaper. While on a summer vacation, Boggs went to visit her aunt and uncle, who had retired in Costa Rica. While there she met and would later marry José Figueres Ferrer. Figueres would go on to lead the opposition forces in the 1948 Costa Rican Civil War. Therein he led a successful democratic revolution against the government, abolished the army, and catapulted Boggs to the role of first lady. From that vantage point, she successfully pushed for giving Costa Rican women the right to vote. Over time, Boggs realized that marriage and life in politics were incompatible, given her independent spirit in what was still very much a patriarchal society. Boggs divorced Figueres in 1954, and she took their children to New York City, where she worked for Costa Rica's delegation to the United Nations while pursuing her lifelong passion of writing. Her return to Alabama in 1969 came with a second marriage to Dr. Hugh MacGuire and her co-founding of River Region Living, the city magazine that she would later sell, but for which she still wrote, up to the time of her death. Boggs died at her home in Montgomery, Alabama on September 9, 2020 from COVID-19 at the age of 102. Documentary film Her 1992 memoir of her years in Costa Rica, Married to a Legend: My Life with Don Pepe, is popular among readers in both the United States and Costa Rica, and is the subject of the documentary First Lady of the Revolution.

The episode was written by Robert Berens and directed by Eduardo Sanchez. It was first broadcast on December 1, 2016, on The CW. In the episode, Sam and Dean find that Lucifer is using Vince Vincente as a way to start his new career with worshipers. They along with Castiel and Crowley seek to stop him from killing the audience at one of his concerts. The episode received mixed reviews with critics criticizing Lucifer's motives and actions in the episode. Plot Temporarily fixing his vessel with one of his fossilized angel feathers, Lucifer (Rick Springfield) revives Vince Vincente's rock career in Los Angeles for fresh worshipers. Dean (Jensen Ackles), Sam (Jared Padalecki), Castiel (Misha Collins), and Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard) try intimidating those in Vince's circle to find out where his concert will be held, without success until Lucifer's forcing Vince's manager to kill himself gets bandmate Tommy (Woody Jeffreys) to text Castiel the location. Lucifer kills the rest of the band and beats Castiel and Crowley, though the Winchesters scare the rest of the humans away to safety. Lucifer reveals he has no plan and is upset that God apologized to him only to leave again to be with Amara. Now Lucifer believes everything is pointless and he just wants to have fun by making people suffer. The effort of the battle burns through Vince's body and Lucifer escapes with a promise to go on to bigger things.

Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 2 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"This was an episode that left me bored through most of it and more disappointed by the end. And that's frustrating, especially because Sam and Dean were dealing with Lucifer, a character that has been mostly so memorable and fantastic, and not just some throwaway monster of the week. I really hope Supernatural Season 12 can kick it into gear for the midseason finale because it would be nice to get an exciting and investing episode before the show goes on hiatus for a while. Fingers crossed!\\" Bridget LaMonica from Den of Geek wrote: \\"So why didn't I think this episode was awesome? I didn't like the lack of direction with Lucifer's motives. Maybe that's supposed to make him feel more dangerous, but to me it feels like a lack of story arc for our main villain of the season. I hope that changes soon, perhaps revealed during the mid-season finale. This episode also felt cheap – I don't know how to explain it, but I really noticed how empty it was by mid-episode. Maybe that's just the soulless design of LA. Thanks a lot, Crowley. Well, the story arc could use some bolstering, but other than that we had a fun little ride here in Rock Never Dies.\\" Samantha Highfill from EW was more positive with the episode, giving it a \\"B+\\" and wrote, \\"With that, we've got another hour in the bank, and I really enjoyed this one. There were so many great lines that made it one of the funnier episodes this season, but I also love the way they handled Lucifer and tied in the idea of social media and celebrity in today's world. This episode was not only funny, but it was relevant and, of course, very creative.\\" References Supernatural (season 12) episodes 2016 American television episodes Television episodes set in Los Angeles Television episodes set in Kansas ","title":"Rock Never Dies"},{"id":"53716633","text":"Paul Lucas was an American playwright and producer based in New York City.

Members of the committee were drawn from the House and Senate Committees on the District of Columbia. The Committee's work proceeded in two phases. During the first phase, until January 1959, the committee studied and prepared staff reports on the region's water supply, pollution, economic development, park areas, and governmental organization.

The current owner, Baker Trayte Marine Ltd, has operated the ferry since August 2016 following a period of ceasation when the previous operation fell into administration in March 2015. The ferry operates throughout the year and conveys schoolchildren, commuters, tourists and cyclists and is busy in the summer. In winter, there is a significant reduction of use. The ferry is scheduled to run hourly but will run more frequently in peak and if the ferry becomes full. Bicycles are conveyed subject to space. The tidal currents at the Ferry point are extremely treacherous and have claimed many lives over the years. Connecting services There is a bus service on the Portsmouth side however the bus service to the ferry point on the Hayling side ceased in 2004. Efforts to re- instate a bus service to the ferry on the Hayling side have taken place at various times and have proved unsuccessful until in July 2018 Havant Councillors approved a £20,000 community bus trial planned to commence shortly thereafter with funding from the Community Infrastructure Levy. In September 2018 after months of discussions arrangements have been made for connecting bus services by First Hampshire & Dorset at Eastney and by a twenty seater community bus on Hayling. The connecting service on Hayling commenced on 24 September 2018 and the trial is to run for six months. Alternative route When the ferry has been closed the only public connection between Hayling Island and the mainland is a single carriageway road linking Northney to Langstone, Havant. Particularly in summer this road can become very congested rendering the journey between the bridge and South Hayling (the most populated area) anything from 30 minutes to an hour.Hayling Billy Project history . Havant Borough Council website. Retrieved 20 June 2010. When the ferry has been closed this has been found to impact businesses on South Hayling. =Alternative proposals to passenger ferry= * In 1886 there was a proposal to construct a branch off the Havant to Hayling railway line and to cross Langstone Harbour with a 900 ft road and rail swing bridge. * In 1903 a scheme for a 720 ft Traveller Suspension Bridge conveying a 60 ft by 30 ft suspended car from one side to the other. * A proposed Millennium project to create a new shared pedestrian and cycle bridge was unsuccessful. History It is claimed that a regular ferry service has run since before 1850, possible even from the 18th century. Rights to run a ferry had passed to the Duke of Norfolk to whom the rights as Lord of the manor of Hayling island had passed on dissolution of the monasteries. The rights were sold to a Mr. William Padwick Esq. in 1825. =Hayling Island Steam Ferry Company= * Formed in 1901 the venture bought the ferry rights but folded soon after due to the unsuitability of the steam vessel. While a Mr. Sandeman (members of the Sandeman (port wine) family has resided on the Island since 1824) had prepared significant infrastructure including pontoons and the construction of Ferry Road across Sinah Common and The Kench on the Hayling side he discovered the vessel was unable to transport a carriage and was restricted to foot passengers. =George Spraggs and the Spraggs Brothers= At some point after the demise of the earlier enterprise utililising the pontoons built for the Steam vessel George Spraggs the licensee of the tavern on the Hayling side began operated the ferry using motor boats with his sons until his drowning in 1922. Following their father's death the sons Cecil, George and Jack continued the operation until 1961,. They seem also to have been joined by an Alan Spraggs, and Cecil was the engineer. They typically used 3 boats, two in service and one in the boatshed.  The Ferry Boat Inn  The Spraggs were also proprietors of The Ferry Boat Inn and its predecessor the Norfolk Lodge (Inn) which was mutually beneficial to the Hayling Ferry operation. Even as early as 1901 they were rebranding the Norfolk lodge Inn as the Hayling Ferry Tavern. =Portsmouth City Council= Portsmouth Council took over and operated the route from 1960 until April 1981 when it closed, introducing the Iris in 1968 and the Irene in 1974 to the service. In 1978 they also briefly introduced a tourist service direct from Southsea using the Folkstone Belle. = Hayling Island Ferry Limited = * The Hayling Island Ferry company took over operation of the ferry in 1985 using the Hayling Enterprise and Hampshire County Council wished the service to be re-instated and was prepared to provide a subsidy. ** Initially the pontoon on the Eastney side had deteriorated so badly it was necessary to run onto the beach. * After the restoration of the pontoon the company purchased the 65 seat Pride of Hayling which entered operation in 1989. * In 2009 after 28000 hours of service the Pride of Hayling had its engines renewed. * Various maintenance, subsidy, operating and financial difficulties and incidents accumulated to bring the company into receivership. ** The Pride of Hayling went in for what proved to be extensive maintenance repairs at the end of 2013, with the 12 seat Tina Marie sourced to continue the service in the interim from January 2014. Repairs by took over 10 months and monies were owed to the repairers. ** This ferry ceased operating in March 2015 with the company going into receivership. = Re-opening under Baker Trayte following closure period = * Receivers sold the boats to realise compensation for creditors. It was hoped the new would purchase the Pride of Hayling and get the service running again quickly. * In August 2015, Baker Trayte Marine, an established marine contractor, purchased the Pride of Hayling ferry with the intention of reinstating the ferry service from Ferry Point on Hayling Island to Eastney Point on the Portsmouth side. * The new service was launched on 5 August 2016 following strenuous efforts to attain the required subsidies needed by the Baker Trayte Business Plan including £15155 by the Hayling Ferry Trust and £5000 from Richard Branson among others. * In 2018 it was reported that while the ferry was popular and financially viable over the summer months the winter patronage was low and unprofitable. The public funding reserves of £20.000 had almost been fully used up and it might be necessary to curtail services in the remaining winter months. The owners and a fundraising group hoped a County Council subsidy could be re-instated and stated the difficulties that were arising because a bus-link could not be re-established on the Hayling side. Boats * Unknown steam vessel of 1901, it proved unsuccessful and was withdrawn after a short while. It was unable to transport a carriage. * Folkstone Belle – Built in 1928 by Gale, H & Co. of Cowes.

He served as the city editor of the Montgomery Advertiser. Early life and career Azbell was born in 1927 in Texas near the Oklahoma border. When Azbell was 7, his father died and his mother struggled to support her large family alone. At the age of 12, he ran away from home. He hitchhiked his way across the United States and Mexico, earning a living by picking cotton, washing dishes and selling and printing newspapers. He then joined the United States Army Air Corps, where he scored well on the Army General Classification Test. He was the top of his class at the Air Force's administration school and was sent to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery. He was the founder and editor of the Air University Dispatch, the official newspaper for the base. After his military service ended in 1946, Azbell moved to Selma where he founded his own newspaper. While in Selma, he also began writing speeches for pro-integration Governor Jim Folsom. He later moved to Montgomery, where he became the city editor for the Montgomery Advertiser. In his spare time, Azbell provided transport to hospitals for black children stricken with polio, as most members of the black community did not own a car. In 1954, Azbell received an honorary doctorate from Selma University, a historically black college. In 1956, local community leader E. D. Nixon gave Azbell a pamphlet by the Montgomery Improvement Association calling for a bus boycott. He published it on the front page of the Montgomery Advertiser, alerting local residents to begin the Montgomery bus boycott. Journalist Ted Poston later called Azbell the father of the bus boycott as Poston believed that many in the African- American community were unaware of the planned boycott prior to publication. Azbell interviewed many civil rights figures of the day such as Martin Luther King Jr., Ralph Abernathy, A. Philip Randolph and Rufus Lewis. He was the first reporter on the scene after King's home was bombed on January 30, 1956, and the first on the scene when E.D. Nixon's house was bombed two days later. Azbell later testified in King's favor when he was on trial in State of Alabama V. M. L. King, Jr. for inciting the boycott. Azbell also was a speechwriter for George Wallace. He developed Wallace's presidential campaign slogan \\"Send them a message\\".

The committee was also directed to inquire generally into the question of the utility of dirigibles in military and naval establishments and make recommendations to the Senate and House of Representatives regarding their future use. The committee was created after the 1933 crash of the U.S.S. Akron, a dirigible designed for the Navy by the Goodyear-Zeppelin Corporation of Akron, Ohio. The U.S.S. Akron made its maiden flight on September 23, 1931. The design of the Akron supposedly had resolved previous safety problems involving rigid airships, but, on April 4, 1933, the Akron crashed just off the coast of New Jersey under stormy conditions. Of the ship's company of 77 officers and men, 74 servicemen, including Rear Admiral William A. Moffett, lost their lives. Its final report was submitted on June 14, 1933 (Senate Document 75, 73rd Congress, 1st session, Serial 9748). Colonel Henry Breckenridge, former Assistant Secretary of War, served as counsel for the joint committee. Senator William H. King of Utah served as chairman. Representative John J.

Zen creates a feed of content that automatically adjusts to the interests of a user. The selection of content is based on the analysis of browsing history, user-specified preferences, location, time of day and other factors. Zen has a weekly active user audience of more than 20 million.  Technology  Zen is an example of the implementation of a specialized artificial intelligence technology. To analyze the interests and preferences of users, Yandex uses information about sites that have been visited, as well as user-specified interests. The system analyzes the user's favorite sites and other behaviors with the aim of creating a unique model of the user's preferences. With an increasing amount of data about the user, the system can offer the user more relevant and topical content, including content from sources unfamiliar to the user. Zen adapts to the changing interests of the user. For example, if a user begins to read about architecture, content on this subject will appear in their content feed more often. Prediction of user interest by using collaborative filtering The service is available as part of the desktop and mobile versions of Yandex Browser and in Yandex Launcher. Zen, Launcher and Browser belong to the “Discovery” technology category (services and apps that use artificial intelligence to adapt to a user). The technology that underlies Zen was adapted by Yandex and CERN for use in the Large Hadron Collider. It is used to provide in-depth analysis of the results of physics experiments taking place at the LHС.  Media platform  In 2017, Yandex announced the launch of a platform that allows companies and independent authors to publish media content (articles, photos, videos) directly to Zen. The platform also allows popular authors to earn money by using micropayment channels and ads. According to Zen Media Director Daniel Trabun, the company plans to pay up to $1 million to the best authors of publications in 2017. Prior to the launch of the platform, Zen feeds consisted only of publications selected from publicly available sources.  History  In 1997, Yandex began research into natural language processing, machine learning and recommendation systems. In 2009, the proprietary machine learning algorithm MatrixNet was developed by Yandex, becoming one of the key components that Zen functions on. The first Yandex service to introduce the use of recommendation technology was Yandex.Music, which was launched in September 2014. This technology was then implemented in Yandex.Market and Yandex.Radio. In June 2015, a beta version of Zen became available. At first, the Zen content feed showed only content from the media, and the service was only available to the 5% of users of Yandex Browser on Android that had registered a Yandex account. Prior to this, Zen was available in an experimental form on the webpage zen.yandex.ru. In the following months, other types of content were added to Zen, such as image galleries, articles, blogs, forums, videos from YouTube, etc.http://istreetwire.com/2016/07/15/stocks-in-the-spotlight-endeavour- silver-corp-exk-baker-hughes-incorporated-bhi-yandex-n-v-yndx/ According to data from April 2017, Zen is available in more than 50 languages in more than 100 countries, including the United States, India and Brazil.  Management  The head of the Zen service is Dmitry Ivanov.  Finances  Zen is one of Yandex's experimental business activities. According to data from 2015, this segment earned the company almost half a billion rubles in revenue. In Q2 2016, Zen and other experimental services brought in 153 million rubles in revenue to Yandex. Monetization of the service is due to ad blocks built into the news feeds (in Russia, ads are served by Yandex.Direct).  Competitors  After the release of Zen, several major companies also announced personal recommendation services. In May 2016, Mail.Ru Group presented a similar project called Likemore, which offers users content from VK (VKontakte) social media groups. In August 2016, Google launched a test version of a similar service that recommends news articles. Apple and Facebook have also launched news services with similar functionality.

Built in 1865, it is a high-quality local example of Italianate architecture executed in brick. It is also noted for its interior, which is a well-preserved later Victorian remodeling of the original. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Description and history The Lucius Barbour House stands about three blocks south of Hartford's Capitol District, on the east side of Washington Street a short way north of Park Street. Washington Street is a major north-south artery in the city, and was historically lined with some of the city's grandest mansions. Many of them have since been demolished to make way for either commercial development or apartment buildings. The Barbour House is one of the few that survive. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, built out of red brick, with a three-story tower at the center of its southern facade. Its form is basically that of a cube, which has been embellished by projecting window bays and wrought iron porches. Many windows are set in segmented-arch openings framed by bracketed sills and lintels. The third floor of the tower is mostly banked sash windows, and the roof of both the tower and main block have projecting eaves with paired brackets. The front facade has been marred by a modern addition to the right of the entrance. The house was built in 1865 by Lucius Barbour, who made a fortune in the dry goods business and real estate speculation. The interior was redecorated about 1890, after Barbour's son (also named Lucius) took over the property. It features elaborate Victorian woodwork, plaster, and tile in each of the public rooms, and original wall treatments from the restyling survive, including wallpaper and stencilwork. A few rooms upstairs were later redecorated with more Adamesque Colonial Revival details. The house now houses professional offices.

The flight crashed during the initial climb phase, shortly after takeoff from Anchorage due to pilot intoxication.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Douglas DC-8-62AF, equipped with four Pratt & Whitney JT3D engines; registered JA8054 to JAL Cargo, a subsidiary of Japan Airlines. The aircraft had a total of 19,744 flight hours, of which 8,708 were since that last major inspection and 45 since the last check. Records showed the aircraft had been maintained within Japanese, American, and ICAO recommendations. = Ice on the aircraft = Mechanics report ice present on the inlet guide vanes, engine cowlings and engine bullet noses, but no ice was found on the aircraft surfaces. A mechanic recommended that the engine anti-icing system be used, but no maintenance was performed on the aircraft in Anchorage. Investigators suspected that ice on the airfoil or transducer may have caused the stall warning to fail. The ice present on the surface of the wings and leading edges could have reduced the angle of attack needed to produce a stall.  Crew  On board the aircraft were three flight crew members, two cattle handlers, and live cattle being shipped to Japan as cargo. The cockpit crew consisted of: Captain Hugh L. Marsh, age 53, hired by Japan Airlines on June 24, 1969. He was certified to serve as the pilot-in command of the DC-8 on February 9, 1970; and on October 30, 1969 issued a JCAB airline transport rating, No. 001168, as well as type rated for the DC-8. Due to minor vision impairment he was required to wear corrective glasses for near vision as needed in flight. On September 10, 1970 he was certified as second class navigator. Marsh had logged a total of 23,252 flight hours, including 4,040 hours on the DC-8. First officer Kunihika Akitani, age 31, hired by Japan Airlines on May 6, 1970 and certified as a copilot on the DC-8 on August 1, 1976. Akitani had 1,603 flight hours, with 1,208 of them on the DC-8. Flight engineer Nobumasa Yokokawa, age 31, hired by Japan Airlines on April 1, 1960. On November 20, 1960 he received his flight engineer DC-8 type rating. Yokokawa was also certified to serve as flight engineer on Convair 880 and Boeing 747 aircraft. Yokokawa had 4,920 flight hours, including 2,757 hours on the DC-8. = Pilot intoxication = The taxi driver who drove Captain Marsh to the airport told investigators that he seemed disoriented. At 04:50 local time a taxi dispatcher phoned JAL and warned of an intoxicated pilot. JAL responded by saying there seemed nothing unusual about the flight crew. Autopsies after the crash showed that the captain was heavily intoxicated, with the initial blood alcohol level 298 mg per 100 ml and a vitreous alcohol level of 310 mg per 100 ml taken twelve hours after the crash; the state of Alaska considers 100 mg per 100 ml legally unacceptable for driving. Of the thirteen people questioned who had spoken with Marsh before the flight, six stated he had been drinking or appeared to be drunk.  Flight synopsis  The aftermath of the crash.At 05:15 the crew boarded the aircraft; the driver of the crew car stated: \\"...he was in good condition as far as ways I've seen him sometimes and I made that statement before I ever heard any rumors that he was supposedly drunk or had been partying or whatever.\\" as to whether the pilot appeared intoxicated. Cockpit voice recorder (CVR) data showed that the crew began the prestart checklists at 06:09; CVR data showed the takeoff was normal until the aircraft slowed acceleration from VR to V2 speed; the aircraft stalled almost immediately after reaching V2 speed. At 0635:39 AST, JAL Cargo Flight 8054 crashed at Anchorage International Airport shortly after takeoff from runway 24L. A witness reportedly saw the flight climb to approximately 100 feet above the ground, veer to the left, and then slide out of the air. All five people on board the aircraft perished in the crash.  Cause  According to the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), flight 8054 crashed due to erroneous inputs to the flight controls, factors for such inputs being pilot intoxication and airframe icing. The NTSB noted that the two other flight crew members should have corrected the intoxicated pilot, Hugh L. Marsh, but did not. > \\"The National Transportation Safety Board determines that the probable cause > of the accident was a stall that resulted from the pilot's control inputs > aggravated by airframe icing while the pilot was under the influence of > alcohol. Contributing to the cause of this accident was the failure of the > other flightcrew members to prevent the captain from attempting the flight.\\" >  See also  * Impact of culture on aviation safety * Aeroflot Flight 821 * Aero Flight 311 * Trans-Colorado Airlines Flight 2286 References Airliner accidents and incidents caused by pilot error 8054 Accidents and incidents involving the Douglas DC-8 Aviation accidents and incidents in the United States in 1977 January 1977 events in the United States Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport ","title":"JAL Cargo Flight 8054"},{"id":"53716992","text":"Rank comparison chart of air forces of Oceanian states.

Following the Moro conflict and subsequent major military operation in the islands of Mindanao during the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos in 1970s, thousands of Filipinos mainly from the Moro ancestry have sought refuge in neighbouring countries of Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei, with majority of them mostly heading to the state of Sabah in Malaysia.  Reasons for fleeing  Despite the uncertain conflict that happened in the southern Philippines, many of the Filipinos decision to flee are also driven by economic factors and hope for a better lives with many are reluctant to return to their homeland that continues to be torn by violence and kidnappings.  Host countries  = Malaysia = Tausug refugee kids in water Since the 1970s, thousands of Filipino refugees have emigrated to the state of Sabah, forcing the need for maintenance of the refugees. As Malaysia are not the signatory of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, the country have maintained that any newly arrived aliens are illegal immigrants rather than refugees. Although unlike the economically motivated illegal immigrants, the Filipino refugees have long been granted special permission to stay despite limited access to the state employment, social services and public amenities. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) establish its office in the state in 1977 with around $2.7 million have been allocated for the maintenance of the refugees children education, with most of it been allocated to the Sandakan area. Despite this however, the Philippines side constantly accused the Malaysian side especially the Sabah authorities for victimising the refugees with the dismissal of their workers by Sabah businessmen. The total of Filipino refugees was only 20,367 in the first quarter of 1970. By 1978, it increased to over 92,000 with a non- official estimate put the total already reach 140,000. The refugees rose to over 350,000 in 1989. As there is still no definite sign the conflict will permanently stopped, the influx of Filipino refugees continued even after the peace agreement with the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in 1976. Following the government decision to issue residency visas and a special card known as the IMM13 to the refugees, the UNHCR closed its office in 1987 after operating for 10 years. To this date, the main office being maintained in Kuala Lumpur. = Indonesia = As there is no official estimate of the total of Filipino refugees in Indonesia, the exact population is unknown. Recent findings in 2014 found there are at least 544 Filipino refugees (mostly from the Bajau community) taking shelter in Derawan Island, Berau Regency, East Kalimantan. It is believed their presence began in 2010 with some of the refugees claiming they are Malaysian citizens, although they were found with a special document released by the Malaysian government which stating they are not the citizen of that country during identity check-up by the Indonesian authorities. Responding to the report, Indonesian President Joko Widodo ordering them to be sent back to their country in the Philippines immediately, although it is still unknown whether the process of deportation has began. Nunukan Regency in North Kalimantan also reportedly saw a large Filipino refugees presence as recently in early 2017.  Aid  = Issues = The UNHCR office in the Malaysian state of Sabah have been giving aid to the refugees for a period of 10 years; however, following the closure of its office, many of the refugees have been roaming in and around Sabah. Following the release of report from Royal Commission of Inquiry on illegal immigrants in Sabah (RCI) which stated many of the Filipino refugees have illegally obtained Malaysian citizenship, the UNHCR began monitoring the situation. However, since the UNHCR did not have any permanent presence in the state anymore, the monitoring capacity was limited. As the Philippines never have the intention to establish its own consulate in the Malaysian state of Sabah to look on the welfare of its citizens, the blame was also put to the Philippines side for its lack of co-operation as the country continuously criticising the treatment towards its refugees without giving more of its own efforts to help and solve the problems of its own citizens. By the end of 2014, UNHCR Malaysia together with UNICEF plans to support local non- governmental organisations (NGOs) to conduct a workshop on birth registration which will be involving different government agencies; such as the Malaysian National Registration Department, local legal practitioners as well as relevant stakeholders. Filipino refugees children also have been enrolled to recently established Alternative Learning Centre (ALC) that was set-up by Filipino volunteers in Sabah with a collaboration with various local NGOs. By 2016, under the Philippines administration reform of President Rodrigo Duterte, the Philippine government began to sign a deal with the Malaysian government for the gradual repatriation of Filipino refugees in Sabah. The Philippines side also announced their plan to establish a consular office in the state along with the establishment of their own school and hospital to care for their nationals as had been recommended previously. However, according to Philippine Representative from Palawan Jose C. Alvarez, they are more interested to establish a Palawan Business Office in the state than Philippine Office that will also giving the similar services like passport granting, renewal of travel documents and other requirements as well extending business assistance to the Filipino people when the need arises, giving excuses that it is only proper and logical to set up the main office if there are increasing number of Filipino traders especially from Palawan. The Filipinos in the state expressed their hopes that more attention will be given from the Filipino consular services especially on easy and better access in communication facilities, more friendly attitude from embassy officials and staff and transparency in all official transactions as they had repeatedly expressed their dissatisfaction over how the manner of consular missions were conducted with the presence of \\"middlemen\\", delays in deliveries of travel documents, difficulties to telephone the main Philippine embassy in Kuala Lumpur and rudeness of some of the embassy officials and staff.  Durable solution  = Repatriation = The Malaysian government are criticised for its contrast policy in dealing with refugees; with different treatments have been compared between the non-Muslim Vietnamese refugees which are quickly being repatriated than the Muslim Filipino refugees which are still being maintained in the country until this day. In defending the presence of Filipino refugees, Ghazali Shafie who is the Home Minister at the time justified their position with the support of Deputy Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad: > :Their presence will not have adverse effects on the peace and order of the > country because they intended to go back whereas the presence of Vietnamese > immigrants could have adverse consequences on the country as they had no > intention of returning to their homeland after the war. :Ghazali Shafie, > Malaysian Home Minister. Most of the Filipino refugees are issued with IMM13 documents by the Malaysian government during Mahathir administration, with many of them have been controversially naturalised as citizen. Repatriation of Filipino refugees remain difficult due to the ongoing conflict in the southern Philippines. The latest peace deal between the Government of the Philippines and Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) is a step towards peace and stability in the southern Philippines. The MILF have been welcoming the return of Filipino refugees from Malaysia as the peace is being gradually restored in their homeland. The International Monitoring Team (IMT) led by Malaysia also monitoring the ceasefire between the Philippine government and MILF since 2010 and put hopes that further new administration of the Philippine government will put an end to the refugee issues which have plaguing the bilateral relations between the two countries. Group such as the MNLF under Nur Misuari have recently staging violent attacks to oppose the peace agreement between the MILF and the Philippine government forces with the latest major attack resulted in the Zamboanga City crisis in late 2013. This presents a definite obstacle to repatriation and led to another new wave of refugees.  Hosting refugees  There are at least five camps for the Filipino refugees in Malaysia, such as in Kinarut in Papar, Telipok in Kota Kinabalu, Kampung Bahagia in Sandakan, Kampung Selamat in Semporna and Kampung Hidayat in Tawau with many Sabah local politicians have repeatedly urging the closure of the camps and repatriation of the refugees to their home country as the camps have become the source of many criminal activities perpetrated by the refugees. In late 2016, the Sabah state government submit recommendations to the Malaysian federal government through the Main Committee on Management of Foreigners to move all the refugee placement schemes in the state to other more suitable locations far from the towns and industrial development areas. Further in 2019 under a new Malaysian government, the IMM13 document for refugees from southern Philippines are being replaced with Temporary Sabah Pass (PSS) to solve the problems once and for all which have been ongoing since 1970s where the old document is misused by the refugees which subsequently posing threats to the security of the state.  Criticism of refugee settlements  The huge Filipino refugee settlements in Sabah have mainly criticised by the locals there for contributing to the significant rise of rampant crimes, with the refugees loyalty towards the country they seeking for refuge are also been questioned for the unstoppable crimes perpetrated from their own community as a Filipino man was recently charged in court as recently in 2017 for supporting the ideology of Abu Sayyaf terrorist group.

History  The Weißes Fenn Marzahne The Weißes Fenn Marzahne was formed after the last cold period, the Weichselian Glaciation. Advancing ice masses pushed a series of tunnel valley basins similar to the parallel Beetzsee- Riewendsee- or Bohnenland-Görden glacial valley, in which meltwaters flowed or collected. These ran from northeast to southwest in the direction of the advancing ice. In this series of tunnel valleys, lakes were subsequently formed, like the Pritzerber See in the southwest. Later low lines of dunes crossed the valley bottoms and they still do today in the northeast of the row of tunnel valleys.Sebastian Kinder und Haik Thomas Porada (eds.): Brandenburg an der Havel und Umgebung. 2006, p. 89. These lines of dunes formed a barrier for the Weißes Fenn (\\"White Fen\\") to the southwest, so that water could no longer drain in that direction and a boggy wetland was created. In the modern period, a ditch, the Roter Graben, was cut to drain the wetland and the lake. This empties into the Pritzerber See.

Barlow Jr. House is a historic house at 31 Canterbury Street in Hartford, Connecticut. An architecturally undistinguished two-story built in 1926, it was from 1958 home to Boce W. Barlow Jr. (1915–2005), the first African-American to win election to the Connecticut State Senate, and a prominent figure Hartford politics. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The Boce W. Barlow Jr. House is located in Hartford's northernmost Blue Hills neighborhood, on the west side of Canterbury Street north of Westbourne Parkway. It is one of a number of similar homes on the street, which was subdivided and built out in the 1920s. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, clapboarded exterior, and two brick chimneys, one at the left side and one in the interior behind the roof ridge. The main facade is three bays wide, with the outer bays filled by paired sash windows. The main entrance is at the center, sheltered by a bracketed gable-roofed hood. A smaller pair of sash windows are set above the entrance. The house was built in 1926, and was purchased in 1958 by Boce Barlow Jr. Born in Georgia, Barlow came to Hartford with his parents when he was one year old, attended Hartford High School, and graduated from Howard University in 1939 as class president. After serving in World War II in a segregated unit, he graduated from Harvard Law School, one of only four African-Americans in his class.

Life and family Rufus Andrew Lewis was born in Montgomery, Alabama on November 30, 1906. He was the fourth and last child of Lula and Jerry Lewis. He had three older sisters: Roberta, Janie, and Corrine. Lewis married in 1935 to Jule Adelaide Clayton, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William and Frazzie Clayton. They had one child, a daughter, Mrs. Eleanor Lewis Dawkins. The family lived on Bolivar Street in Montgomery, Alabama at the home of William Clayton following his passing. The street has since been renamed Rufus A. Lewis Ln and the family home is now the residence of Lewis’ granddaughter, Ms. Karen Dawkins. Jule Clayton Lewis passed away in 1958 following a car accident.  Education  Lewis received his early education in Montgomery County where no public high school program was available to black children at the time. As a teenager, he attended Alabama State Laboratory High School, a tuition-funded private school with limited capacity that was used by Alabama State College to train teachers. He then went on to attend the Alabama State Teachers’ Junior College. Lewis was involved in athletics at the high school and college level, participating in both football and baseball.Interview with Rufus Lewis, conducted by Blackside, Inc. on October 31, 1985, for Eyes onthe Prize: America’s Civil Rights Years (1954-1965). Washington University Libraries, Film and Media Archive, Henry Hampton Collection. After junior college, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee to attend University. Lewis graduated from Fisk University in 1931 with a degree in Business Administration.  Career  Rufus Lewis returned to Alabama after graduating where he taught for one year at the Conecuh County Training School in Evergreen, Alabama (1931-1932) and then at People's Village School in Mt. Meigs, Alabama (1932-1933). In 1933 Rufus Lewis became a faculty member at Alabama State Teachers’ College where he worked as the athletic coach and librarian. In 1943, Lewis, a charter member of the graduate chapter of Alpha Upsilon Lambda chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, was named the Head Coach for Football and Track. He worked as a football coach there until the outbreak of World War II in 1941. Although he was called to serve in the war, a prior injury resulting from a car accident made him ineligible. He went on to spend two years working with the National Defense Project as a civilian. After the war ended, Lewis established classes for black Montgomery residents who wanted to pass the literacy tests they were required to complete to vote.  Activism  Lewis first became active in the voter registration movement in 1938 when he went to work with students in the “Citizenship Club” at Alabama State Laboratory High School. During the early 40s, Lewis set up schools and clinics to teach community members, especially veterans, to fill out the required literacy test to become a registered voter. In 1949 Lewis was hired to lead a program created by the Montgomery School Board in an agreement with the Veterans Administration that offered job training classes for black veterans. In 1952 Lewis founded the Citizens Club, a social club aimed to assist the black community with matters of voter registration. In 1954 Lewis worked with Jo Ann Robinson and E. D. Nixon to organize the Citizen Coordinating Committee to advance efforts in civic consciousness and get people registered to vote. He was a member of Dexter Avenue Baptist Church and a founding member of the Montgomery Improvement Association which organized the Montgomery bus boycott. He served on the organization's executive committee and was chairman of the transportation committee and the voter registration committee. At the organization's first meeting, Lewis nominated Martin Luther King Jr. as president.  Political work  Lewis’ early work as a civil rights activist lead to a successful political career later in life. In 1960 he co-founded the Alabama Democratic Conference (ADC). Lewis was the first president of the Montgomery County Democratic Conference, 2nd Congressional District of the Democratic Conference. He was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Montgomery Community Action Committee. He later attended the official signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 at the White House. In 1976, he was elected to the Alabama House of Representatives. In 1977 President Jimmy Carter appointed Lewis to become the first Black U.S. Marshal of the Middle District of Alabama. He worked in this role until 1981. Honors and awards In 1994, one of Montgomery's libraries was renamed Rufus A. Lewis Regional Library in his honor. The street that he and his wife lived on for many years was also changed from Bolivar Lane to Rufus A. Lewis Lane.

Burkina Faso maintains an embassy in New Delhi. India maintained an embassy in Ouagadougou from November 1996 until its closure in July 2002. Currently, India maintains an honorary consulate in Ouagadougou, which functions under the jurisdiction of the High Commission of India in Accra, Ghana.  History  Burkina Faso's Commerce & Industry Minister led an official delegation to India in March 1976. This was the first bilateral activity between Burkina Faso and India. During the visit, the two countries signed a Protocol on Economic and Technical Cooperation. Several high level visits between officials of the two countries have taken place since then. Burkinabe President Captain Thomas Sankara visited India in 1983 to attend the NAM Summit. The Indian Minister of State for External Affairs visited Burkina Faso in 1987, becoming the first Indian minister to visit the country. Burkinabe President Blaise Compaore visited India in May–June 1993, and the two nations agreed to establish a Joint Commission to foster bilateral cooperation. India also offered help in the economic development of Burkina Faso, particularly in the fields of agriculture, hand looms, mining, irrigation, and small scale industries. Compaore visited Delhi for two days in July 1994, and visited India again in 1997. Narasimha Rao became the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Burkina Faso when he made a state visit to Ouagadougou on 2–4 November 1995. Rao met with the Burkinabe President, addressed the country's Parliament, and was conferred Burkina Faso's highest civilian award. Rao also inaugurated the Embassy of India in Ouagadougou during his visit. The Embassy was headed by a resident Chargé d'Affaires until its closure in July 2002. Burkina Faso opened its embassy in New Delhi in 1996, and upgraded it to ambassador-level in 2011. Burkina Faso and India established a Joint Commission on economic, cultural, political and technical after signing an agreement in October 1994. Former Prime Minister Tertius Zongo visited New Delhi in April 2008 to attend the first India-Africa Forum Summit, and also held bilateral talks with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Bharti Airtel completed the acquisition on 8 June 2010. In January 2016, Airtel announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its operations in Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone to French telecom company Orange S.A. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but analysts estimated it to be worth $800–900 million. Orange assumed control of operations in Burkina Faso in June 2016.  Foreign aid  During President Compaore's first visit to India in July 1994, India offered to help in the economic development of Burkina Faso, particularly in the fields of agriculture, handlooms, mining, irrigation, and small scale industries. During Compaore's second visit in July 1994, India provided of aid to Burkina Faso to help develop agriculture in the country. The aid included 200 tractors, seeds, implements, water pumps and several other accessories. India supplied expert farmers to Burkina Faso to provide training to local farmers about Indian practices of rice growing, the use of ergonomically designed hand tools and tractors, and related consumable inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. The project began in Burkina Faso in 1999 and was completed in 2002. Farm machinery, equipment, vehicles and other necessary support were donated to the Burkina Faso government after project was completed. Burkina Faso was one of the nine West African countries included in the TEAM-9 initiative and the Pan African e-Network Project.

It is a luxury living community with many amenities including an in-ground pool, clay tennis courts, picnic grounds, fire pit, and walking paths. The buildings, of brutalist architectural design, were built on the lakefront to create an opportunity for comfortable luxury condominium dwelling in a municipality where previously only free-standing single-family housing existed. One of the two structures was originally intended to be a 180-unit rental apartment building, while the other, smaller one was a condominium from its inception. In 1976 however, the larger one also became a condominium, and the ultimate success of these two condominium associations heralded a diversification of housing types in Bratenahl Village since that time. Condominium suites in these two structures range in price from $150,000 to over $1.0 million. Nicholas Satterlee & Associates of Washington, D.C. was the architectural firm that designed both buildings. Nicholas Satterlee’s wife, Sally Hitchcock Satterlee, grew up in Bratenahl as a child.

Life  Since 1957 Wagin has been living in Berlin, where he studied at the University of the Arts. Being a student, he worked as assistant for sculptor Karl Hartung and others. On 3 May 1962 he opened the \\"Galerie S\\" in the front yard of the student dormitory Siegmunds Hof. Here, he first presented works of Berlin's artists, but exhibition rooms of the Galerie S soon became famously known nation- and eventually worldwide. In May 1966 Wagin published the monthly newsletter \\"Galerien + Museen in Berlin\\" for the first time. On 8 May 1968 Wagin together with his Galerie S moved into the Europa-Center. Since 1970 he has been regularly showing art installations at Art Basel.

He also used halls of the TU Berlin on Ackerstraße as studio and exhibition space from the middle of 1980s to ca. 2006.http://www.pressestelle.tu- berlin.de/medieninformationen/2007/maerz_nr_51-67/medieninformation_nr_612007/ Ben Wagin in Lindentunnel, 1995 Project at Gräbendorfer See In many works, exhibitions and other performances Wagin tries to make the viewer think about man-made changes of natural environment. In 1975 he initiated one of the first and to date one of the biggest wall paintings in Berlin at Siegmunds Hof, which is called \\"Weltbaum I\\". In 1985 he designed \\"Weltbaum II\\" with many other artists on \\"Brandmauer\\" at Berlins city train station S-Bahnhof Savignyplatz. Wagin has planted numerous trees in and around Berlin, often with politicians and persons engaged in the cultural sector. Wagin's trees still stand in front of federal ministries, theatres, museums, among others in front of Berliner Ensemble, the Gedächtniskirche and the Neuen Nationalgalerie. The Parliament of Trees, 2010 In 2005 Wagin started \\"Sonnenboten\\" (Messengers of the Sun) and has since created 4 million oases of sunflowers together with schools and communities in the whole of Germany. Ben Wagin is known as \\"Baumpate\\" (Godfather of Trees) nationwide and has been able to plant around 50.000 Ginkgo trees from Moscow to Vilshofen. Wagin has been fighting for years for the preservation of The Parliament of Trees, which has been standing as permanent installation in the middle of Berlin's governmental quarter since the 1990s. Pieces of the former Berlin Wall designed by Wagin were included in the library of the national German parliament in Marie- Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus and are known as \\"Mauer-Mahnmal des Bundestages\\" (Memorial of the Berlin Wall of the national German Parliament).

At that time, there was concern that the Katyn Massacre could have served as a \\"blueprint\\" for the execution of U.S. troops by Communist forces.Fischer, Benjamin B. \\"The Katyn Controversy: Stalin's Killing Field\\" Studies in Intelligence Winter, 1999–2000.  Background  Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union each invaded Poland in September 1939, having divided the country into separate spheres of influence under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. While the Germans began a massacre of Jews and Poles in western occupied Poland, the Red Army arrested and imprisoned thousands of Polish military officers, policemen, and intelligentsia during their occupation of eastern Poland. Prisoners of war and civilian internees captured by the Soviets were placed in several camps in the western USSR, run by the Soviet People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs, or NKVD, a predecessor organization to the modern FSB-camps including Kozielsk, Ostashkov, and Starobielsk. In April 1943, in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk in the Soviet Union, occupying German troops discovered eight large graves containing the remains of thousands of the Polish Army officers and intellectual leaders who had been interned at the prisoner-of-war camp at Kozielsk. Bodies of the prisoners who had been housed at Ostashkov and Starobielsk were discovered near Piatykhatky and Mednoye, respectively. Collectively, these murders are known as the Katyn Forest Massacre. An internationally staffed medical commission organized by the Germans excavated the area in early spring 1943. As the excavation progressed, the Germans brought in several groups of observers, including some American prisoners-of- war. This commission determined that the massacre occurred in 1940, when the area was under Soviet control—a determination which was then used as a propaganda tool intended to disrupt the alliance between the US, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union. This effort was successful in part, as Polish intelligence sources immediately blamed the Soviets for the atrocities, leading to a break in diplomatic relations between Poland and the USSR. After their recapture of Smolensk in the autumn of 1943, the Soviet government organized its own excavation. This second enquiry concluded that the Polish prisoners of war had been captured and executed by invading German units in August 1941. The official American response at the time was one of non- involvement. In a June 1943 telegram to Churchill, Roosevelt expressed approval that the British approach to Stalin was grounded \\"upon the obvious necessity of creating the most favorable conditions for bringing the full weight of the armed forces of all the United Nations to bear upon the common enemy. ... The winning of the war is the paramount objective for all of us. For this unity is necessary.\\"  Formation of the Committee  Later, on September 18, 1951, the United States House of Representatives established the Select Committee to Conduct an Investigation and Study of the Facts, Evidence, and Circumstances of the Katyn Forest Massacre, known as the Madden Committee after its chairman, Rep. Ray J. Madden of Indiana. The committee assembled records relating to the massacre and its aftermath, including records from the files of the State and War Departments, in addition to hearing extensive witness testimony. Their purpose was to determine which nation was responsible for the atrocities and whether any American officials had engaged in covering up the massacre. The Madden Committee determined unanimously that the NKVD was responsible for the executions, and recommended a trial before the International World Court of Justice. The question of an American cover-up was less clear cut. In its final report, the committee concluded that American officials failed to properly evaluate and act upon clear danger signals in Russian behavior evident as early as 1942. In addition, the committee found that American policy toward the Soviet Union might have been different if information deliberately withheld from the public had been made available sooner.  Declassification and release of related records  In September 2011, the National Archives responded to a letter to President Barack Obama by Representative Marcy Kaptur and Representative Daniel Lipinski requesting the identification, declassification and public release of all records of permanent value in the custody of the US Government relating to the events at Katyn. The National Archives via the National Declassification Center subsequently made it a priority to process and declassify all known documents related not only to the initial events of the 1940s but also to the Madden Committee and the ongoing American response. This special effort has led to the declassification of over a thousand pages not previously released to the public, and the launch of a project to highlight Katyn material declassified by the National Archives over the previous few decades.

He was born in Orenburg and was educated at the high school in the city of Gorky and then at the Lomonosov Moscow State University. In 1957 he joined the laboratory of Gersh Budker, which was a part of the I. V. Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy (now the Kurchatov Institute). Since 1962, Skrinsky has been connected with the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics, where he was director from 1977 to 2015. Skrinsky made a significant contribution to the development of the physics of accelerators and high-energy physics (in particular, he developed a method of colliding beams, he participated in the creation of new types of colliders in electron-electron, electron-positron and proton- antiproton beams). In 1964, together with Budker, he developed the foundations of the method of colliding beams, on the basis of which the world's first VEP-1 collider was created at the Institute of Nuclear Physics of the Siberian Branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR for experiments in the physics of elementary particles and a series of studies on quantum electrodynamics was carried out. In 1966 an electron-positron collider VEPP-2 was constructed, experiments on which yielded valuable results on the physics of vector mesons and other hadrons. Later, the method of colliding beams became the basis of modern high-energy experimental physics; In particular, based on the technology of the colliding beams method, the Large Hadron Collider was built. On November 26, 1968 he was elected a corresponding member, and on December 24, 1970 a full member, of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR (since 1991 the Russian Academy of Sciences) in the Division of Nuclear Physics (High Energy Physics). He is also a full member of the American Physical Society (1999) and a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences (2000).

It is responsible for a range of rural, coastal and marine assets and works with the Scottish Government, Scottish Parliament, local authorities, communities and businesses in sectors such as offshore renewables, farming, tourism and aquaculture. The corporation is held 'in right of the Crown' and the monarch remains the legal owner, but it is not the private property of the monarch. It cannot be sold by the monarch, nor do revenues from it belong to the monarch. Surplus revenue (i.e. revenue profit) is paid from Crown Estate Scotland to the Scottish Consolidated Fund. Crown Estate Scotland is one of the largest property managers in Scotland, managing assets worth £385.8 million. These include over of land in rural Scotland, the majority of which is let for farming, residential, commercial, sporting and mineral operations. The estate also has significant holdings in the coastal and marine environment, including virtually all of the seabed out to , rights to lease seabed for renewable energy generation and gas and carbon dioxide storage out to 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres) and just under half of Scotland's foreshores. History King George III revoked his claim to the income from the crown estates in England in 1790, receiving in return an annual payment known as the civil list from the Treasury. However it was not until 1830 that King William IV revoked the income from the crown estates in Scotland. The hereditary land revenues of The Crown in Scotland, formerly under the management of the Barons of the Exchequer, were transferred to the Commissioners of Woods, Forests, Land Revenues, Works and Buildings and their successors under the Crown Lands (Scotland) Acts of 1832, 1833 and 1835.Pugh, p. 18 These holdings mainly comprised former ecclesiastical land (following the abolition of the episcopacy in 1689) in Caithness and Orkney, and ancient royal possession in Stirling and Edinburgh, and feudal dues. There was virtually no urban property. Most of the present Scottish estate excepting foreshore and salmon fishing is due to inward investment, including Glenlivet Estate, the largest area of land managed by the Crown Estate in Scotland, purchased in 1937,Paterson, Wilma \\"Out of the shadows\\", The Herald, 13 November 1999, p. 12 Applegirth, Fochabers and Whitehill estates, purchased in 1963, 1937 and 1969 respectively. After winning the 2011 Scottish election, the Scottish National Party (SNP) called for the devolution of the Crown Estate income to Scotland. In response to this demand, the Scotland Office decided against dividing up the Crown Estates, however plans were developed to allocate some of the Crown Estate income to the Big Lottery Fund, which would then distribute funds to coastal communities. Following the 2014 Scottish independence referendum, there were calls for more powers to be devolved from the United Kingdom Parliament to the Scottish Parliament. The Smith Commission was announced by Prime Minister David Cameron, with Lord Smith of Kelvin asked to \\"convene cross-party talks and facilitate an inclusive engagement process across Scotland to produce, by 30 November 2014, Heads of Agreement with recommendations for further devolution of powers to the Scottish Parliament\\". On 27 November 2014, the Commission published a number of recommendations, which included that \\"responsibility for the management of the Crown Estate's economic assets in Scotland, including the Crown Estate's seabed and mineral and fishing rights, and the revenue generated from these assets, [should] be transferred to the Scottish Parliament.\\" A bill based on the Smith Commission's recommendations became law as the Scotland Act 2016 in March 2016. This made provision for the devolution for the management and revenues of Crown Estate assets in Scotland. Crown Estate Scotland was established by The Crown Estate Scotland (Interim Management) Order 2017. Under The Crown Estate Transfer Scheme 2017, the existing functions of the Crown Estate Commissioners and the rights and liabilities set out in the transfer scheme transferred from the Crown Estate Commissioners to Crown Estate Scotland on 1 April 2017. Prior to the handover, the Crown Estate owned a multi-million stake in the Fort Kinnaird retail park which represented about 60% of the value of all crown assets in Scotland. This was not passed to Crown Estates Scotland with other Scottish properties in 2016. Two years later, the Crown Estate sold its stake and used the funds to assume full ownership of the Gallagher Retail Park in Cheltenham. Assets Crown Estate Scotland is responsible for managing: * 37,000 hectares of rural land with agricultural tenancies, residential and commercial properties and forestry on four rural estates (Glenlivet, Fochabers, Applegirth and Whitehill) * Salmon and sea trout fishing rights on many Scottish rivers * Around half the foreshore around Scotland including 5,800 moorings and some ports and harbours * Leasing of virtually all seabed out to covering some 750 fish farming sites and agreements with cables & pipeline operators * The rights to offshore renewable energy and gas and carbon storage out to * Mineral rights over naturally occurring gold and silver across most of Scotland * Retail and office units at 39-41 George Street Edinburgh Although The Crown has first claim on all \\"royal fish\\" (whales which measure more than from the snout to the middle of the tail) found dead or stranded in Scottish waters, since 1999 this right has been administered by the Scottish Government's Marine Directorate, and royal fish do not become the property of Crown Estate Scotland. Similarly, assets that have no owner (bona vacantia) also revert to The Crown, but in Scotland such assets are dealt with by the Queen's and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer. Management and governance Crown Estate Scotland is a public corporation of the Scottish Government, i.e. a commercial enterprise under government control. As such it is managed by a board whose members and chair are appointed by Ministers. Board members are appointed to serve for a two or three year term, and may not serve for longer than eight years in total. The board appoints a Chief Executive, who is responsible for day-to-day running of the body and is accountable to the board. As of January 2020 the Chief Executive was Simon Hodge.

The film stars Garlin, Natasha Lyonne, Amy Sedaris, Leah Remini, Christine Woods and Steven Weber. It was released on Netflix on May 5, 2017.  Plot  Los Angeles police detective Gene Handsome visits the house of a new neighbor and meets her babysitter, Heather Dromgoole. The next day, Handsome and his partner, Fleur Scozzari, find that Dromgoole has been murdered and dismembered outside the home of actor Talbert Bacorn. Bacorn claims that at the time of the murder, he was inside taking care of his neighbor's dog and watching a TV rebroadcast of one of his early films. Handsome's neighbor, Nora, says Dromgoole was a good babysitter despite stealing several items from her. Handsome babysits Nora's daughter so Nora can go to work. When she returns, Nora tells Handsome Dromgoole had a roommate, Amanda. While interviewing Amanda, Handsome and Scozzari notice an extravagant body lotion on Dromgoole's dresser. Amanda says she believes Dromgoole received it while dating an older man, who turns out to be Nora's ex-husband Lloyd. Lloyd denies a sexual relationship and says he was a father figure. Scozzari has sex with Lloyd. Handsome learns from the medical examiner that Dromgoole's body contains traces of an expensive skincare cream and she has a round depression in her skull. After examining Dromgoole's phone records, Handsome confronts Lloyd, who admits he hired Dromgoole to spy on his ex-wife. Handsome notices Lloyd's company's coffee table book, which contains a photograph of Dromgoole and Bacorn attending the same sponsored event. Nora visits Handsome and during a conversation they realize they have had the same dream about escaping their current lives to live in the country and care for dogs. Lloyd explains that the picture of Dromgoole and Bacorn was taken at a celebrity gala where he provided the fireworks and Dromgoole tagged along by pretending to be his assistant. Annoyed she could not take one of the \\"swag bags\\" given to celebrities at the event, which included expensive toiletries, she befriended Bacorn. When Handsome arrives at Bacorn's house to re-interview him, he discovers that the handles of the neighbor's tools contain traces of skincare cream. At Bacorn's house, Handsome notices that Bacorn is using the same brand of skincare cream as the lotion from Dromgoole's apartment. Bacorn says he received the skincare cream and body lotion at the party Dromgoole and he attended, and he gave the lotion to her. Handsome spots a large award in Bacorn's bedroom, something which could have caused Dromgoole's head injury. Handsome denigrates Bacorn's acting and Bacorn becomes enraged, confirming Handsome's suspicion that Bacorn is prone to violent anger. Bacorn admits that Dromgoole and he had sex after the party, during which she ridiculed his acting. Bacorn killed her, then dismembered her using his neighbor's tools. He dumped her body on his own lawn, assuming no one would suspect him if his guilt seemed so obvious. Bacorn attacks Handsome, but Scozzari arrives and saves him. Nora says she cannot date Handsome because she is moving to the country to begin a new job giving massages to dogs. Handsome returns to his regular neighborhood routine.

And when we’re brave enough to listen, and > bold enough to pursue, that dream will lead us on a journey to discover who > we’re meant to be.

Magical pixie dust flows through the keyhole and covers the castle and surrounding turrets in royal red and gold as the Happily Ever After theme song plays. Searchlights, lasers (from and towards the castle), and eventually fireworks come into play. = Dreams = Introduced by Tiana, we see various Disney characters longing for their deepest desires – Ariel wishing to be ‘part of our world’, Remy for his own career as a cook in Paris, Rapunzel for freedom from her tower, and Quasimodo for one day to be ‘out there’ from the tower of Notre Dame. Songs include: \\"Down in New Orleans (Prologue)\\", \\"Part of Your World\\", and \\"Out There\\". = Journey = Introduced by Merida, characters from Brave, A Bug's Life, Cars, Up, Finding Nemo, and Moana are shown embarking on their adventures. Songs include: \\"Touch the Sky\\" and \\"How Far I'll Go\\". = Friendship = Introduced by Aladdin, this segment highlights the friendships shared by Disney characters from Tarzan, The Lion King, Toy Story, The Jungle Book, Wreck-It Ralph, Big Hero 6, Zootopia, Inside Out, Monsters Inc., and Aladdin. The segment comes full circle with a showstopping performance by the Genie. Songs featured: \\"Trashin' the Camp\\", \\"Hakuna Matata\\", \\"You've Got a Friend in Me\\", \\"The Bare Necessities\\", \\"I've Got No Strings\\", \\"That’s What Friends Are For\\", and \\"Friend Like Me\\". = Love = Introduced by Olaf, a full moon rises across the castle that leads into romances and acts of love shared by characters from Wall-E, The Lion King, Tarzan, Zootopia, Finding Dory, Up, and Dumbo. The castle turns into a garden with waterfalls and then transitions to show silhouettes of Disney princes and princesses; floating lanterns from Tangled are seen covering the castle as Rapunzel and Flynn Rider duet and send their own lanterns to the top of the castle. Songs featured are \\"Love is an Open Door\\", \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\\", \\"You'll Be in My Heart\\", \\"A Whole New World\\", and \\"I See the Light\\". = Adversity = Introduced by the Emperor of China from Mulan, the show becomes aggressive and loud, highlighting the climactic battles and challenges the characters face including epic scenes from The Incredibles, The Little Mermaid, The Lion King, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, and Pirates of the Caribbean. The castle and its surroundings are peppered with explosions as many more climactic scenes are shown. When it is over, the castle is left a flaming ruin with gaping holes in its sides. Music featured include instrumental selections from Frozen and The Lion King, and \\"He's a Pirate\\". = Triumph = The visage constellation of Mufasa appears across a starry sky reminding us to “remember who [we] are”. As an inspirational version of \\"Go the Distance\\" from Hercules plays, turret by turret, the castle gradually repairs itself while we see the featured characters in their triumphant moments. As the music swells, the structure turns gold with stained-glass portraits of the characters, all of them accomplishing their 'happily ever after'. = Finale = The show ends with the narrator challenging the audience to unlock their own magic and make their dreams come true, just as the characters did. The keyhole reappears and a pixie flies from it, leaving a trail of dust around the central plaza. As the castle restores itself to red and gold, the pixie flies up to the highest spire, where it’s revealed to be Tinker Bell, making her flight over the park to the familiar refrain of \\"You Can Fly\\". The castle and illuminated central plaza change color as multi-color peony fireworks appear in the sky. The keyhole then turns and opens, unleashing a colorful final set of fireworks.

Gouyn helped Nicholas Sprimont (1716-1771) set up the Chelsea Porcelain Factory around 1745. But in about 1748 Gouyn severed his links with Sprimont and the Chelsea Porcelain Factory and set out to compete with his own 'Girl-in-a Swing' manufactory, so-called after a figure in the Victoria & Albert which has given its name to a whole class of similar porcelain figures. Gouyn's factory also made small scent bottles, etc. usually with gold or gilt metal mounts collectively known as 'toys'. Some 'Girl-in-a-Swing' products appear to imitate Chelsea porcelain models and vice versa. Research by Bernard Dragesco discovered in French archives in 1993, has established that a group of figures and wares were made in St. James's and the factory is now identified as the St. James's factory. However, the precise location of his factory, and the identity of the modeller of these distinctive figures, remain unknown. Examples of his work are in public collections held in The British Museum, Dallas Museum of Art, Royal Collection Trust, The National Archives, Victoria & Albert Museum and Metropolitan Museum of Art.

All contemporary fifty states and the District of Columbia took part, and Florida voters selected fourteen electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background Like all former Confederate States, Florida following the end of Reconstruction had become a one-party Democratic state as the introduction of poll taxes and literacy tests effectively disfranchised the entire black population and many poor whites. Unlike southern states extending into the Appalachian Mountains or Ozarks, or Texas with its German settlements in the Edwards Plateau, Florida completely lacked upland or German refugee whites opposed to secession. Thus its Republican Party between 1872 and 1888 was entirely dependent upon black votes, as one can see from the fact that so late as the landmark court case of Smith v. Allwright, half of Florida’s registered Republicans were still blackSee Price, Hugh Douglas; ‘The Negro and Florida Politics, 1944-1954’; The Journal of Politics, Vol. 17, No. 2 (May, 1955), pp. 198-220 – although very few blacks in Florida had ever voted within the previous fifty-five years. Thus this disfranchisement of blacks and poor whites by a poll tax introduced in 1889Silbey, Joel H. and Bogue, Allan G.; The History of American Electoral Behavior, p. 210 left Florida as devoid of Republican adherents as Louisiana, Mississippi or South Carolina.Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 208, 210 Immigration of northerners into the previously undeveloped areas of South Florida, along with fierce anti-Catholicism in the northern Piney Woods, did give Herbert Hoover a freakish victory in 1928,Phillips; The Emerging Republican Majority; pp. 212-214 but apart from that the Democratic Party lost only six counties at a presidential level between 1892 and 1944.Menendez, Albert J.; The Geography of Presidential Elections in the United States, 1868-2004, p. 164-165 Things began to change in the late 1940s, as new migrants from traditionally Republican northern states in Central Florida took their Republican voting habits with them at the presidential level,Seagull, Louis M.; Southern Republicanism, p. 73 restricting Harry Truman to under half the statewide vote in 1948 and allowing Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon to carry the state in the following three elections. The GOP reached over seventy percent in the retirement areas of the southwest coast, and its success was greatest in areas which had historically not had plantation agriculture and favoured little or no economic regulation.Doherty, Herbert J. (junior); ‘Liberal and Conservative Politics in Florida’; The Journal of Politics, nol. 14, no. 3 (August 1952), pp. 403-417 In contrast, North Florida’s Piney Woods had remained loyal to the Democratic Party at all levels despite the 1960 Presidential ticket being headed by another Roman Catholic in John F. Kennedy. Between the 1960 and 1964 elections, North Florida was severely affected by civil rights protests, especially over school and university integration.Encyclopedia of African American History: 5-Volume Set, p. 228 Contrariwise, the retirement communities further south that had become powerfully Republican in presidential elections over the previous fifteen years were extremely hostile to GOP nominee Barry Goldwater’s desire to privatize Social Security.Phillips; The Emerging Republican Majority, p. 224 Vote The two contrasting trends noted previously produced a major reversal in the voting patterns from the previous four presidential elections: indeed at a county level there was essentially zero correlation between 1960 and 1964 party percentages,Lamis, Alexander P.; The Two-Party South, p. 180 and as many as 43% of voters switched parties.Gimpel, James Graydon and Schuknecht, Jason E.; Patchwork Nation: Sectionalism and Political Change in American Politics; pp. 102-103 A Lyndon B. Johnson campaign office in Key West. Incumbent President Lyndon Johnson overall won Florida against Goldwater by 42,599 votes, a margin of 2.30%, or a swing of 5.32% from the 1960 result. Increased registration of black voters – it had reached 51% by the time of the election – was crucial to Johnson regaining Florida: in the northern counties of Lafayette and Liberty where no blacks were registered, swings toward Goldwater reached over 100 percentage points.Bullock, Charles S. and Gaddie, Ronald Keith; The Triumph of Voting Rights in the South, p. 254 Florida was the second-closest state win by Johnson after Idaho. , this is the last election in which the Democratic candidate carried Charlotte County.Sullivan, Robert David; ‘How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century’; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 Results =Results by county= { width=\\"60%\\" class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" -

Laura Lu Scherer Copenhaver (August 29, 1868 – December 18, 1940) was an American businesswoman. Copenhaver was a native of Marion, Virginia, where her father, the Reverend John Jacob Scherer, was the first president of Marion College. She was a writer, collaborating with her younger sister, Katharine Killinger Scherer Cronk, on fiction, poetry, and church pageants; her poem \\"Heralds of Christ\\" became a popular hymn. Copenhaver was the director of information for the Virginia Farm Bureau Federation, and in that role advanced the agricultural economy of southwestern Virginia. In this role she emphasized cooperative marketing of farm products, and herself was involved in the same practice by producing textiles out of her home, Rosemont, hiring local women to craft coverlets based on traditional patterns, using locally produced wool. Copenhaver pressed her local Women's Missionary Society to establish the Konnarock Training School, which offered entry-level academic and religious education to children who could not attend the regular schools, and which opened in 1925. Copenhaver was the mother-in-law of Sherwood Anderson, and was long active as a lay leader in the Lutheran Church. After her death her sister Minerva May Scherer headed Rosemont Industries for two decades; in 1960 some of her children incorporated it as Laura Copenhaver Industries, Inc.

Loewy was widely recognized for his research on the biochemistry of blood clotting and his identification of Factor XIII, an enzyme involved in the clotting pathway. He also played a major role in the development of the molecular biology and biochemistry curricula at Haverford. Early life and education Loewy was born on March 12, 1925, in Bucharest, Romania. His family left the country when he was a child, escaping the rise of fascism in Europe by emigrating to England in 1936 and then to Canada in 1941. Loewy studied botany at McGill University, from which he received his bachelor's and master's degrees. He moved to the United States in 1948 to attend the University of Pennsylvania, from which he received his Ph.D. in botany in 1951 for work on the motility of slime molds. After graduation Loewy worked as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University, where he first began his work on the biochemistry of clotting; it was during this period that he identified Factor XIII and studied its transaminase enzymatic activity. Academic career After a year as a research fellow at the University of Cambridge from 1952 to 1953, Loewy returned to the U.S. to join the faculty at Haverford College. He held the Jack and Barbara Bush Professorship in the Natural Sciences from 1983 to 1995 and spent a period as chair of the biology department. Loewy continued his research on Factor XIII, transaminases, and later on isopeptidases and their effects on neurofibrillary tangles, aggregates of tau protein found in Alzheimer's disease and other diseases known as tauopathies. Loewy was known during his tenure at Haverford for his work in developing the curriculum at Haverford to focus on molecular and cell biology and biochemistry, an unusual emphasis for undergraduate biology education at the time. In 2000, Loewy left Haverford to teach at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. Loewy served as an editor of the scientific journal Thrombosis Research and coauthored the major textbook Cell Structure and Function' with Philip Siekevitz, first published in 1963 and described as the first American textbook on cell biology. He also coauthored a second, more basic textbook, Biology. Personal life Loewy and his wife had three sons and two daughters. Loewy died on February 13, 2001, of complications after a stroke.

He was selected as consul ordinarius in his ninetieth year, serving with Gaius Antistius Vetus in AD 96.Anthony Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 230 The primary sources differ over Manlius Valens' praenomen. A number of inscriptions state it is \\"Titus\\", such as ; however both Cassius Dio and the Fasti Ostienses state it is \\"Gaius\\". Aged 45 or 46, Valens was already older than the average legatus commanding a legion in Roman Britain when the governor Publius Ostorius Scapula died. The identity of the legion is not definitely known: although Legio II Augusta has been proposed, Anthony Birley believes Legio XX Valeria Victrix is more likely. Although emperor Claudius quickly selected a replacement for Scapula, Aulus Didius Gallus, between Scapula's death and the arrival of a new governor the Silurians had defeated the legion under Valens' command.Tacitus, Annales, XII.40 The defeat in Britain likely set back his career, for Manlius Valens does not appear in the historical record until towards the end of the reign of Nero, when he became legate of the newly formed Legio I Italica at Lugdunum; this fact caused Birley to comment that \\"at sixty-two or sixty-three he is by far the oldest known legionary legate.\\" During the Year of the Four Emperors, Valens and the legion sided with Lucius Vitellius;Tacitus, Histories I.59 however, this did not gain him any favor from Vitellius due to Fabius Valens defaming him behind his back.Tacitus, Histories, I.64 Since Legio I Italica was present at the two battles of Bedriacum, it is likely Valens was also a participant in one or both battles. However, with the success of Vespasian, Valens retired from public life. Why Domitian selected him, a general of an enemy of his father, as eponymous consul almost 30 years later, Birley confesses is a mystery. Manlius Valens died the same year he was consul.

It was remarkable in that it consisted - out of military necessity - entirely of officers, with those below the rank of colonel serving as troopers. The Sacred Squadron was formed on 23 November 1812, by the Bobr River (perhaps at Borisoff, in modern Belarus) to serve as Napoleon's bodyguard. It was disbanded on 10 December 1812, in Kowno (modern Kaunas, Lithuania). It therefore served during the crossing of the Berezina (26-29 November), and continued to exist for a few days after Napoleon's departure for Paris on 5 December. Its existence is recorded in the , by which Napoleon hinted to the French people for the first time the scale of the disaster which had befallen the Grande Armée: French soldiers had earlier coined the phrase \\"mentir comme un Bulletin\\" (\\"to lie like a Bulletin\\"). The French populace - and government officials - may have been able to read between the lines for the implications of, if not fully to comprehend, what had happened. The Grande Armée had invaded Russia with 80,000 cavalry. No written order establishing the unit has been found; it is possible that it was set up orally. No official record of those who served in it has survived; considering the circumstances, it is possible that none was ever made, or that the records of Marshal Berthier (Napoleon's Chief of Staff) were lost during the retreat.

It is a superficial cyst in the alveolar mucosa. It can be seen inside the mouth as small and whitish bulge. Depending on the ages in which they develop, the cysts are classified into gingival cyst of newborn (or infant) and gingival cyst of adult. Structurally, the cyst is lined by thin epithelium and shows a lumen usually filled with desquamated keratin, occasionally containing inflammatory cells. The nodes are formed as a result of cystic degeneration of epithelial rests of the dental lamina (called the rests of Serres). Gingival cyst was first described by a Czech physician Alois Epstein in 1880. In 1886, a German physician Heinrich Bohn described another type of cyst. Alfred Fromm introduced the classification of gingival cysts in 1967. According to him, gingival cysts of newborns can be further classified based on their specific origin of the tissues as Epstein’s pearls, Bohn’s nodules and dental lamina cysts. Babies Gingival (alveolar) cysts of infants are mostly found in groups, but are frequently found as single nodules. They are present on the alveolar ridges. They are formed from fragments of dental lamina that remains within the alveolar ridge mucosa during tooth formation (odontogenesis). Specifically, they emerge when the process of formation extends into the abnormal sites to form small keratinized cysts. They are generally harmless (asymptomatic) and do not cause discomfort, and they normally degenerate and involutes or rupture into the oral cavity within 2 weeks to 5 months after birth. Hence, they are not normally recognized and do not require medical treatment. It is estimated that the prevalence is higher than 50% in babies. Depending on their exact occurrence, the cysts can be classified into palatal and alveolar cysts. Palatine cysts are those located at the mid-palatine raphe, while alveolar cysts are found on the buccal, lingual or crest of alveolar ridge. =Epstein’s pearl= Epstein’s pearls were discovered by Alois Epstein in 1880. They are palatal cysts found along the median palatal raphae and arise from the epithelium entangled along the line of fusion. They are small white or yellow cystic vesicles (1 to 3 mm in size) often seen in the median palatal raphe of the mouth of newborn infants (occur in 60-85% of newborns). They are typically seen on the roof of the mouth (palate) and are filled with fluid. They are caused by entrapped epithelium (fissural cyst) during the development of the palate. =Bohn’s nodules= Bohn's nodule in a nine-month-old baby Bohn’s nodules, described by Heinrich Bohn in 1886 as \\"mucous gland cysts\\", are distributed over the junction of the hard and soft palate. They are derived from minor salivary glands. They are found at the junction of the hard and soft palate, and along lingual and buccal parts of the dental ridges, away from the midline. These nodules are 1–3 mm in size, and filled with keratin. Bohn also classified cysts in the alveolar ridges as mucous gland cysts. However, a century later it was shown that these cysts are microkeratocysts. Adults Gingival cyst of adult (arrow) Panoramal radiograph of GCA. Inset: no evidence of bone involvement. Gingival cyst of adult is a rare condition. The incidence is less than 0.5%. It is formed from the rests of dental lamina. It is found in the soft tissues on the buccal and labial portions of the jaw. It usually occurs on the facial gingiva as a single small flesh colored swelling, sometimes with a bluish hue due to the cystic fluid. Sometimes, it may occur in cluster, either unilaterally or bilaterally or on the lingual surface of the alveolar process. It is most commonly seen in the canine and premolar regions of the mandible, and are sometimes confused with lateral periodontal cysts. It is not normally problematic, but when it grows larger, it can cause some discomfort. It can be removed by simple surgical excision. They are developed late in life, generally up to the sixth decade of age.

Matthew Carlson serves as showrunner. The series stars Paris Berelc and Isabel May as Alexa and Katie, a high schooler suffering from cancer and her best friend, respectively. Jolie Jenkins, Emery Kelly, Eddie Shin, Finn Carr, Tiffani Thiessen, with Jack Griffo also star. The series debuted on Netflix on March 23, 2018, and ran for three seasons, concluding on June 13, 2020. Premise Lifelong best friends Alexa and Katie are eagerly anticipating the start of their freshman year of high school. The two friends confront a crisis when Alexa discovers that she is ill with cancer and starts undergoing treatment for the illness, which leaves them feeling like outsiders at a time when what seems to matter most is fitting in. To support Alexa, Katie makes an important decision and shaves her head with Alexa. The girls try to navigate through all the troubles high school seems to bring while Alexa is dealing with cancer. Cast =Main= * Paris Berelc as Alexa, an ambitious basketball player battling cancer. A determined individual, she strives to live a normal life which often gives her rebellious tendencies. She also despises the pity she receives because of her illness. *Isabel May as Katie, Alexa's best friend. Portrayed as quirky and awkward, she consistently supports Alexa's impulsive decisions when dealing with the illness. Katie also shares a liking for theatre. She seems to be attracted to Lucas. * Jolie Jenkins as Jennifer, Katie's divorced, single mother studying to finish college while working. She is the matriarch of the Cooper family. Because of her home situation, the Cooper family is less financially fortunate than the Mendoza family. * Emery Kelly as Lucas, Alexa's older brother. Often portrayed as dimwitted and conceited, he cares a great deal for Alexa and aspires to be a doctor, wanting to help others as the doctors helped her. In season two, he becomes the lead of his own band. * Eddie Shin as Dave, Alexa and Lucas' father, Lori's husband, and an airline pilot. He is the patriarch of the Mendoza family. When Alexa shaves her head, he struggles to cope with the reality, but eventually realizes his faults. He is also shown to have competitive tendencies like his wife, Lori. * Finn Carr as Jack, Jennifer's son and Katie's younger brother with an avid love for candy and video games. Despite his age, he understands Alexa's situation and helps her the best he can. He eventually adopts a dog, Potato. * Tiffani Thiessen as Lori, Alexa and Lucas' mother, Dave's wife, and the matriarch of the Mendoza family. Strong- willed, competitive, and at times overprotective, she helps guide Alexa through her fight with cancer and additional problems as a teen. * Jack Griffo as Dylan (recurring in season 1 & 3; main in season 2), Lucas' highly intelligent best friend. He begins tutoring Alexa in season one when her grades drop. Later, Dylan asks Alexa to the Winter Formal and the two begin dating. In season two, Alexa breaks up with Dylan when he doesn't know what will happen to them when he goes to college, but they eventually agree to be friends. =Recurring= * Kerri Medders as Gwenny, Alexa's self-absorbed and manipulative rival on the girls' basketball team. Much to Alexa's dismay, Gwenny begins acting kinder towards her after learning about Alexa's illness. She also begins dating Lucas in season two. * Iman Benson as Reagan, a friend of Alexa and Katie. She is more sensible than Hannah. Often portrayed as self- centered, Reagan's selfishness is a running gag in the series. * Merit Leighton as Hannah, a friend of Alexa and Katie. She is more naive and dimwitted than Reagan. In season two, she joins the school's cheerleading team. * Nathaniel J. Potvin as Ryan, an awkward friend of Katie who worked with her in the school play.

Cory Jr. (August 3, 1920—April 11, 1978) was an American pianist and composer whose most notable work was the music to the song \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\". His partner, Douglass Cross, wrote the lyrics. When the song was written in 1953, Cory and Cross were amateur songwriters who had moved to New York following military service during WW II and had become homesick for the West Coast. After pitching the song unsuccessfully to other artists for about eight years, the song was picked up by Ralph Sharon, Tony Bennett's musical director, who suggested to Bennett that it would be a good song for a 1962 \\"Happy New Year\\" engagement scheduled at the Fairmont Hotel in San Francisco. Mayor George Christopher and future mayor Joseph L. Alioto were in attendance. After a good response to the song, Bennett recorded it shortly thereafter and released it in February 1962. The song became an enduring hit and in 1969 was named as the official song of San Francisco. The two authors were present at the meeting when the city's board of governors selected it by a unanimous decision. Early career Cory grew up in the San Francisco area and attended Old Mill School in Mill Valley. He attended Tamalpais High, class of 1937. He studied music at UC Berkeley, then enlisted in the army on September 14, 1942. While in the army, he met Douglass Cross who was also in the service at the time. Cross had been a baritone soloist (and youngest member) of the San Francisco Opera Company in 1941 when his career was interrupted by the war. During the war, Cory and Cross collaborated on musical shows for servicemen. After military service, the two moved to Brooklyn, New York, to make a career of songwriting and met with mixed success. They wrote over 200 songs together, but only 30 were published. The song, \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\" was their only commercial success. The song provided them income for life when it became an international hit. In 2003, authors Cory and Cross received the \\"Towering Song Award\\" for the song, given by the Songwriters Hall of Fame and presented at the National Academy of Popular Music's 34th annual induction ceremony. Tony Bennett received the \\"Towering Performance Award\\" for his trademark rendition of the song. Later life Cory committed suicide by a drug overdose in his San Francisco apartment on April 11, 1978. He had been despondent in previous weeks over failing health, according to the coroner's office. He left a note, but the contents were not revealed. He was 57.

Tabaristan and Jibal) in the early 10th century. He played a major role in the succession disputes of the Alids of Tabaristan, and managed to establish himself as the ruler of Tabaristan and northern Jibal briefly from 928 to 930. Name Asfār is a local Caspian form of Middle Persian aswār, which means \\"rider, cavalryman\\". The New Persian form of the word is savār.  Biography  =Background and early life= Map of northern Iran A native of Lahijan, Asfar belonged to the Gilaki clan of Varudavand, and was the son of a certain Shiruya (Sheroe). Asfar had a brother named Shirzad, and grew up in an environment where \\"Iranian culture, memories of the glories of the Iranian Empire, were alive among them.\\" Like many other Gilakis and Daylamites, Asfar was not a Muslim—he was in fact a nationalist, who loathed Arab rule and admired the Iranian Empire. According to the 10th- century Arab historian al-Masudi, most of the Daylamite and Gilaki leaders, who were adherents of Zoroastrian and Iranian paganism, had become atheists. Asfar was one of the many Gilaki leaders that entered into the service of the Alids, after establishing their rule over Tabaristan, Gilan, and Daylam. =Rise to power= Asfar is first mentioned in 917, during the succession disputes for control in Tabaristan after the death of the Alid ruler Hasan al- Utrush (r. 914–917). Eventually, Hasan ibn Qasam (called al-da'i al-saghir, \\"the lesser missionary\\") managed to emerge victorious. It was around this period, that the Samanid Empire was seeking to expand their power from Transoxiana and Khorasan into northern Iran, opposing Zaydi Shia Islam there whilst advocating the Sunni movement against it. =Reign and downfall= Asfar now expanded his domains over Ray, Qazvin and other parts of Jibal, initially apparently as a delegate of the Samanids, but thereafter as an sovereign ruler, assuming the emblem of kingship at Ray in disregard of Nasr II and the Abbasid caliph, al-Muqtadir (r. 908-932). He reportedly killed a great number of the citizens of Qazvin, burned the markets, demolished mosques and killed the muezzin, and prohibited the salah. Furthermore, he enforced a poll-tax on the whole population of the city, along with traders visiting from other countries, thus acquiring a vast sum. He also appointed his lieutenant and compatriot Mardavij as the governor of Zanjan. View of the Alamut Castle, where Asfar had left his vast treasure. In 930, Mardavij along with Asfar's brother, Shirzad, were ordered to capture Tarom, the capital of the Sallarid ruler Muhammad ibn Musafir. During the siege, Mardavij, on the urging of Makan and Muhammad, betrayed Asfar by revolting against him. With the aid of Muhammad and Makan, Mardavij defeated and killed Shirzad, including other members of the Varudavand clan. He then marched towards Qazvin, the residence of Asfar. However, Asfar managed to flee. Mardavij thus founded the Ziyarid dynasty, and became ruler of Asfar's former territories. Asfar was chased into Khorasan, being left no choice but to leave the treasure which he had assembled in the castle of Alamut in Daylam. When Asfar arrived at Bayhaq, however, he went back, aiming to recover his treasure at Alamut. But when he entered Talaqan, a town in Daylam near Qazvin, he was overwhelmed and killed by Mardavij, most likely in 931.

She was the first woman in Buffalo, from New York to become a professional journalist, the first American woman to lecture at Cambridge University, and the first American woman whose work was accepted by the British Association. Welch was a pioneer among American women in developing an extensive group of American history lecture courses. Early years and education Jane Meade Welch, daughter of Thomas Cary Welch and Maria Allen Meade Welch, was born in Buffalo, New York on March 11, 1854. Of New England ancestry, she was descended from John Alden, Priscilla Alden, and Samuel Seabury. Welch graduated from Buffalo Female Academy (now Buffalo Seminary) at the age of 16. At Elmira College, she was the best historian of her class, often rising at four o'clock in the morning to study David Hume and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Her studies were interrupted in her sophomore year by an almost fatal illness. Career =Journalist= Welch was an invalid for two years before she regained her health and became a practical journalist, beginning as a music critic. For a year, she served as a general writer on the Buffalo Express. She next joined the staff of the Buffalo Courier (now Buffalo Courier), writing anonymously. During the 10 years she served at the Courier, Welch worked in a variety of areas, from writing advertisements to pieces on a political leader. She served as society editor and occasional contributor of editorial articles, as well as preparing and conducting a woman's work column. Welch was the first woman in Buffalo to make a career of journalism. =Historian= While working as a journalist, Welch instituted history classes at her home in Buffalo inviting her female friends. The success of these classes induced Welch to devote herself full-time to history. She became a regular lecturer on American history at the Buffalo Seminary, St. Margaret's school, Buffalo; Mrs. Sylvanus Reed‘s school, New York; The Misses Masters School, Dobbs Ferry, New York; and Ogontz school, Pennsylvania (now Penn State Abington), Cornell University, and the Chautauqua Assembly. In February 1891, she gave a series of six lectures in the Berkeley Lyceum Theater in New York City, on the advice of her friend and former townswoman, Frances Folsom Cleveland Preston. With every lecture, Welch's audience grew in numbers; some of the attendees included Preston, Mrs. William Collins Whitney, Anne Wroe Scollay Curtis, Mrs. Edwin Lawrence Godkin, Rev. Dr. Morgan Dix, President Seth Low of Columbia University, Dorman Bridgman Eaton, and the Rev. Dr. Charles Deems. Welch was the first American woman to lecture at Cambridge University, and whose work was accepted by the British Association. She was a pioneer among American women in talking about American history in the form of extended lecture courses. Her writings on this topic were voluminous and valuable. Personal life Welch traveled extensively in the US, as well as in Great Britain, France, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. She lived at 514 Delaware Avenue in Buffalo for 30 years.

Biography  Ruth Laxson was born in Roanoke, Alabama, the daughter of the Edward Wilts Knight Sr. and Ruby Melinda Dunson Knight. She studied art at Atlanta College of Art (1958–1965) and was based in Atlanta, Georgia from1953. until her death on June 1, 2019. During most of her career, Ruth Laxson worked in two studios built in 1970 by her husband, Robert Earle Laxson, that sat side by side in the Brookhaven neighborhood of Atlanta. . \\"It's the eighth day and God has handed us the chisel,\\" says Laxson, who was born to fundamentalist parents, \\"Artists were sent here to be agents of creativity. I think art is a responsibility, a bit of an onus, a delightful burden. I work hard as hell. It is hard work. The masses think that the artist is just spending the afternoon dabbling.\\" Ruth Laxson said in a 1992 interview that her earliest works were large color woodcuts that contained biomorphic forms and shapes along with traces of the symbols and markings we have always used to communicate.. Around the late '70s she became interested in new paper techniques that put her in touch with the artists' book world. Yet, she never made a book with hand-made paper; when she started making books she wanted them to be more idea-oriented.. Her first artist book, done in the early 1980s, was Power Poem, a little book about power. It was a simple little book in black and white, done by offset. Laxson's books merge images with often fragmented texts that may be handwritten or typeset. Inspired by the Surrealists, she playfully pushed language outside its ordinary meanings. The books may also include collaged or sewn-in elements.. Michael Fallon writes, \\"Her books follow their own logic. Images and texts move in spirals, flow into starbursts and tangles, run erratically across page-spreads, fade, blur, and break up. There are twisting lines of type, plentiful arrows pointing this way and that, words split asunder and reshaped into images (a bird, a train, a house). There are dingbats and other iconograms worked in with their own rationale.\\" Laxson also made stand-alone prints and drawings, paintings, sculptures, and mail art. When asked in 1992 what was a major theme of her work, Ruth Laxson replied \\"Communication.\\" \\"I am intrigued by the looks of systems of communication—the markings for music and physics and mathematics. \\"I really want to get beyond words. The idea of making words more meaningful by reducing them, distilling them is wonderful but I think that to really get at life we have to get beyond words.\\" \\"Obviously you can also play with ideas. You can sound-off or be poetic or whatever. It's a good way to be an anarchist if one wishes. It gives me a chance to shape ideas.\\" Pattie Belle Hastings writes, \\"Laxson has an ear for the peculiar and mundane phrases of our everyday lives, taking seemingly innocuous banter from TV, radio, or casual conversation and transforming it into a stream-of-consciousness.\\" Laxson's books are best experienced when read out loud - performed even. She has been a visiting artist at the University of Iowa, Center for the Book; Atlanta College of Art; and Agnes Scott College. Laxson has exhibited shows at the Neuberger Museum, SUNY; Rolling Stone Press; Atlanta College of Art; National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.; San Antonio Art Institute; and Zeitgenossiche Handpressendrucke, Hamburg. Collections holding her work include the Victoria & Albert Museum (London), the Getty Center Museum (California), the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the High Museum of Art, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia, and the Sackner Archive of Visual and Concrete Poetry. A print she made in honor of James Agee is in Georgia's State Art Collection. Laxson had her first museum retrospective in 2013 at the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia. Laxson's archive has been acquired by the Rhode Island School of Design.Also Laxson's Hip Young Owl at Atlanta featured more than125 works.

Biography  Úrsula Céspedes was born October 21, 1832, in Hacienda La Soledad, close to the city of Bayamo in the eastern part of Cuba. She first received schooling in her own home where she learned music and French. In 1854, she visited Villa Clara, where she met Ginés Escanaverino, whom she married three years later. In 1858, she became a teacher. The same year she and her husband founded the Academia Santa Úrsula for women's schooling. They moved to Havana in 1863, where they remained until 1865. Afterwards, her husband obtained the position of director for the secondary school for men in San Cristóbal, Cuba, where Céspedes also taught classes for girls.  Works  When Céspedes composed her first verses, she received the support of her distant relative Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, who declared Cuban independence in 1868, who also chose her first pseudonym: \\"La Calandria.\\" During this period, Carlos Manuel was still living in Bayamo. She published her first poems in 1855 in Semanario Cubano and El Redactor in Santiago de Cuba, sometimes under the pseudonyms of \\"La Serrana\\" and Carlos Enrique Alba. She collaborated on \\"La Regeneración,\\" published in Bayamo; \\"La Antorcha,\\" in Manzanillo; \\"La Alborada\\" and \\"Eco de Villa Clara,\\" in Santa Clara; \\"El Fomento\\" and \\"Hoja Económica,\\" in Cienfuegos; \\"Corre de Trinidad\\" and \\"La Abeja,\\" in Trinidad; \\"La Prensa\\" and \\"El Kaleidoscopio;\\" \\"La Idea\\" y \\"Cuba Literaria\\" in Havana; and \\"La Moda Elegante\\" in Cádiz, Spain. In 1861, she published her book Ecos de la Selva with a prologue by Carlos Manuel de Céspedes in which he wrote, \\"Therefore, in spite of the defects they suffer from, her verses grab and seduce one; she paints what she feels; but she does it with such trueness to color, that her feelings are transmitted like magnetic fluid to the heart to those who hear her inspired word.\\" Her spouse posthumously published Cantos Postreros in a small private edition. In 1948, the Dirección de Cultura of the Ministry of Education published a selection of her works.  Death  After the death of Céspedes's brothers and father, the uncontrolled persecution against her family and the loss of all their goods caused her to move to Santa Isabel de las Lajas where she died on November 2, 1874.

In eukaryotes, enzymes with isopeptidase activity are often involved in this pathway; all five classes of deubiquitinating enzymes have isopeptidase activity. Examples include Ulp1 peptidase and USP5 (formerly known as isopeptidase T). In lasso peptide processing Isopeptidases have also been identified in prokaryotes that express lasso peptides, or peptides with a knotted conformation established by the presence of a non-main-chain linkage between an acidic amino acid and the peptide's N-terminus to form the knot. (Some lasso peptides also have topological complexity conferred by disulfide bonds.) Isopeptidase enzymes linearize the peptides by cleaving the isopeptide bond.

Michael first gained popularity in 2016 for his cover of the Finnish rock band Eppu Normaali, titled \\"Joka päivä ja jokaikinen yö\\" which became a hit on Facebook and was featured on Soundi.fi, the website for Finland's largest music magazine. He was also a contestant on season 6 of The Voice of Finland (2017) where he reached the knockout stage of the competition.  Early life  Born in the rural area of Lagos (Nigeria), Ekeghasi is the fourth child of his parents and has six brothers. He developed interest in music since the early age of 10. learning to play instrument like flute, harmonica and percussion all by himself without any formal training. He also sang in the choir at the local church in his city. At age 16, he had his first studio recording experience as a back-up vocalist. Growing up in a society where there is not much regards for music as a career, he was discouraged by family members and friends from following his passion.  Education  He later studied Electromechanics at the Institute for Industrial Technology, Lagos, and worked for a while before moving to Finland in 2010 to further his studies. In 2013, he graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in automation engineering from HAMK University of Applied Sciences.  Career  While studying in Finland, he played percussion and sang at the local church band during his spare time. He was a member of a multi-genre band in Valkeakoski which converted Finnish traditional Christmas songs into modern contemporary songs and performed them at the annual event, Grooveimmat Joululaulut. He was also member of the now defunct band called Love Nation. In late 2014, Ekeghasi decided go back to his passion and starts a career in Music. He started posting covers of songs by famous Finnish singers and of other popular music artiste on Facebook and YouTube and also performing at the local gigs and bars around town. In September 2016, his cover of the song Joka päivä ja jokaikinen yö by the Finnish rock band Eppu Normaali immediately became a hit on Facebook with thousands of views. This was partly due to his lively and sunny rendition of the song. He went on to release other hit cover songs on Facebook like J.Karjalainen’s Vileja Lupiineja and Hector's Mandoliinimies among others.  Popular Finnish media appearance  = Yle = On 24 September 2016, Ekeghasi appeared on the Finnish national television, Yle, during the Peli Poikki anti-racism rally held in Helsinki, where he performed as a guest artist. The rally had in attendance over 15,000 people among which the former president of Finland, Tarja Halonen, Paleface, Malang Cissokho and Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. = Soundi = In September 2016, Ekeghasi was featured on Soundi.fi, the website for the largest music magazine in Finland. = Ruutu = On 27 January 2017, Ekeghasi appeared on Ruutu.fi in an interview with Tiini Wikström of Loop FM, In the interview, Ekeghasi explained what led to his covering of the Eppu Normaali song \\"Joka paivaa ja joka ikinen yö\\".  The Voice of Finland, (2017)  In January 2017, Ekeghasi's blind audition on The Voice of Finland season 6 was aired on channel 4, Nelonen TV. He performed \\"One Love/People Get Ready\\" by the legendary reggae music icon Bob Marley. Three of the Judges, Redrama, Anna Puu and Michael Monroe turned their chairs. These reactions of these judges earned him a place in the battle rounds of the competition as he picked Redrama as his choice coach. His battle performance was broadcast in February 2017, Ekeghasi performed \\"Can't stop the feeling\\" by Justin Timberlake, alongside Terry Kim, another contestant from South Korea. Ekeghasi was selected as the winner of that round and move on to the next rounds, the Knockouts. At the knockout rounds, which was aired in March 2017, Ekeghasi performed his famous cover of Eppu Normaali's song, Joka päivää ja joka ikinen yö. His performance was well received by the audience with positive feedback from the judges. Michael Monroe, one of the judges, said he loves the contrast of having a Nigerian perform a Finnish song in a unique way. Ekeghasi was asked to take the second seat by his coach Redrama.

It was created and developed by Japanese performance artist Miyuki Matsunaga, with music by Cirque Du Soleil adapter and musician Pierre Dubé.  Characteristics  Geta Dance Art blends elements of Japanese traditional dance, modern dance, and deep vocal singing with live painting and acting. The goal of each dance piece is to express strong emotions through a vibrant theatrical presentation. A Geta Dance Art performance. Performers wear geta (Japanese wooden sandals) and custom-made kimono. In addition, they use various traditional Japanese accessories—including sensu (fan), kasa (umbrella) and katana (sword) -- to visually enhance the performances. Each Geta Dance Art piece has its own story that is portrayed through intricate choreography. Typically, a performance will include a live painting of Japanese calligraphy. Common compositions during performances are the Japanese kanji for the four Earth elements: earth, water, wind, and fire. The music is in the New Age music style and is performed using taiko drums, a shakuhachi (bamboo flute), and a shamisen.  History and Development  Inspired by kabuki theatre and Japanese traditional dance, and wanting to incorporate those traditions into a more modern approach, Matsunaga began to formulate her new dance method in 2005. After coming up with the idea to perform the new style using geta sandals, she named it Geta Dance. A Geta Dance Art performance. Matsunaga first started performing Geta Dance at the 2nd Street Jazz Club in the Little Tokyo neighborhood of Los Angeles, where she gained a following. Soon, Japanese folk singer Marisa Kosugi asked Matsunaga to perform Geta Dance as the opening act for her minyo (Japanese folk music) shows at Japanese festivals and events throughout California.Digital Chopsticks (March 1, 2009) \\"minyo station, the departure for points east and west\\" Shortly thereafter, Matsunaga began performing at county fairs, art galleries, and other venues. She later served as the opening act for Japanese pop singer Ai (singer). In 2008 Matsunaga performed Geta Dance alongside lead actress Mary Takeyama in the Baseline Productions motion picture Subprime Children. In 2009 she performed on the 7Jem Productions television pilot Let's Chat Girls. She also performed in a commercial for Sekka rice, which aired on United Television Broadcasting Systems, Inc.'s Channel 18 for several years. A Geta Dance Art performance. In 2008 Matsunaga, who up to that point had been using various New Age music recordings to accompany her performances, met Pierre Dubé, music adapter and taiko performer for the Cirque Du Soleil production Mystere. Initially, Dubé gave Matsunaga permission to use one of his original songs for her Geta Dance shows. Impressed by her performances, he began to provide more of his works, and his compositions came to comprise the bulk of the music for Geta Dance shows. In 2012 Matsunaga added the live painting component to her performances, after which she renamed the style Geta Dance Art. Matsunaga has been invited to perform Geta Dance Art in Germany, Lithuania, India, and throughout the United States.Rafu Shimo Los Angeles Japanese Daily News (January 23rd, 2016) \\"Live in Vilnius\\"Houston Japan Fest \\"Miyuki Matsunaga: World Famous Geta Dance\\"Berliner Abendblatt (April 7, 2017) \\"Japan erleben in Berlin\\"  Criticism  While Geta Dance Art has gotten much acclaim, it has also received some criticism from advocates of traditional Japanese dance. It has been called inauthentic, and Matsunaga has been accused of lowering the standards of Japanese dance. Some have also criticized the look and aesthetics of Geta Dance Art, likening its female practitioners to appearing like prostitutes or onna tsubofuri shi, the women who worked for yakuza gambling dens in Edo period Japan.

The initial and the no-slip condition on the wall are :u(y,0) = 0, \\\\quad u(0,t>0) = U, \\\\quad u(\\\\infty,t>0) = 0, the last condition is due to the fact that the motion at y=0 is not felt at infinity.

P.\\", National Catholic Register, July 20, 2014 His work spanned subjects as diverse as literature, education, theology, apologetics, economics, environmental stewardship, sacred geometry, art, culture, and more. Books include Radiance of Being, Beauty for Truth's Sake, All Things Made New, and Not as the World Gives. He was a founding editor for the online journal Humanum and a contributor for several online and print journals in addition to maintaining his own blogs. Early life and education Dulwich College Stratford Caldecott was born in 1953, in London, to parents who had left South Africa in 1951. The family espoused no particular religious beliefs. As a child, he was sickly and bedridden much of the time, and developed a close relationship with his mother. His father was a publisher with Penguin Books,Bogle, James. \\"The Constant Convert\\", Touchstone, Nov./Dec. 2014 which fueled Stratford's love of reading. He attended Dulwich College. As a teenager Caldecott fell in love with America through his exposure to comic books, and their portrayal of the fight between good and evil, and the theme of hope. Between Dulwich and university he went to America, earning money as a 'mother's help' and stayed first with a family in New England before touring the continent by Greyhound bus. After a year, he attended Hertford College, Oxford on scholarship and studied Philosophy and Psychology. After taking his degree, Caldecott pursued a career in publishing and education as a senior editor for publishers Routledge, HarperCollins, and T&T; Clark. In 1977, he married fellow student Leonie Richards. The ceremony was held in an Anglican ceremony, in deference to her family. He and his wife had three daughters. Conversion Caldecott says that at the age of fourteen he had what he terms \\"a philosophical insight\\" that there was more to the universe than matter and energy. His metaphysical samplings at Oxford led him to seek a religious tradition. Shortly after graduating, he became a member of the Baha'i faith. He later explored Sufism and Buddhism. He also began a correspondence with philosopher Robert Bolton, author of The Order of the Ages, The Logic of Spiritual Values, Self and Spirit, and The One and the Many: A Defense of Theistic Religion.Robert Bolton, Angelico Press Caldecott came to realize that the stories which had informed his early youth, stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, the Quest of the Holy Grail, and the Narnia books of C.S. Lewis and Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings reflected a Christian worldview. \\"All along, my imagination had been built on a Christian foundation, and I had never noticed it before. I knew now that in some sense, on some level, I was already a Christian.\\"Longenecker, Dwight. \\"Stratford Caldecott - A Tribute\\", Patheos, July 18, 2014 His reading then turned to Gilson, Maritain and Aquinas. In 1980 he was baptised into the Catholic Church. This was not well received by his father, who viewed Catholicism as \\"worse than apartheid\\". Career Caldecott taught a course called \\"Christianity and Society\\" at Plater College in Headington, on the other side of Oxford. Caldecott was a G. K. Chesterton Research Fellow at St. Benet's Hall, Oxford. His devotion to Chesterton led to his becoming something of an expert on him. He also served as a commissioning editor for the Catholic Truth Society. From 2010, he and his wife Leonie, served as co-editors of the UK and Ireland edition of Magnificat.Jones, Kevin J., \\"Catholic cultural renewal advocate Stratford Caldecott mourned\\", Catholic News Agency, July 18, 2014 He also became the founding editor of the journal \\"Humanum\\", under the aegis of the Washington DC John Paul II Institute. =Centre for Faith & Culture= In 1994 the Caldecotts founded a research centre in Oxford called the Centre for Faith & Culture (CFC), associated with The Chesterton Review and the international review Communio. Its newsletter, the Faith & Culture Bulletin, was offered free of charge. The Oxford Centre was initially a partnership between Westminster College in Oxford at Botley (where it was physically located) and the Edinburgh theological publishers T&T; Clark. The two partners divided the costs between them, and the Centre's activities were equally divided between conferences and publications. Before long it also provided a home for the G. K. Chesterton Library created by Mr Aidan Mackey. In 1998, after Westminster College was acquired by Oxford Brookes University, the CFC moved to Plater College in Headington, maintaining its activities with partial support from T&T; Clark and also from the G. K. Chesterton Institute, founded by Rev. Ian J. Boyd CSB, publisher of The Chesterton Review. In 2002, after the demise of Plater College, the Centre for Faith & Culture merged for several years with the G. K. Chesterton Institute, creating the \\"G. K. Chesterton Institute for Faith & Culture\\", which was eventually based at Seton Hall University in New Jersey with its Oxford Centre in King Street, Oxford. After 2006 Seton Hall ceased to support the Centre in Oxford and it became independent again. =Second Spring= Caldecott was a co-director of Second Spring, (named after John Henry Newman's famous sermon of 1852, in which Newman predicted a revival of Catholicism in England). Second Spring initially appeared in 1992 as an 8-page quarterly supplement in the American Catholic World Report. In 2001 Second Spring merged with the Newsletter of the Centre and started to appear as an 80-page journal twice a year.\\"Historical Background\\", Second Spring The Caldecotts, together with the artist David Clayton, started a company called \\"ResSource\\" to develop educational projects in the spirit of Second Spring, but it ceased trading after Clayton took up a post at the Thomas More College of Liberal Arts in New Hampshire. The Caldecotts, along with their eldest daughter Teresa, eventually founded their own company, Second Spring Oxford Ltd, in order to manage several editorial contracts as well as undertaking their own publishing programme. Thomas More College became the distributor of Second Spring Journal, as well as sending students to a summer school organised by Second Spring in Oxford. Caldecott's blogs \\"Beauty in Education\\", \\"The Economy Project\\",Caldecott, Stratford. The Economy Project and \\"All Things Made New\\"Caldecott, Stratford. All Things Made New serve as resource collections on the topics of education, economics and social justice, and perennial wisdom, and served also as forums for a growing network of friends who, under the banner \\"Second Spring Associates\\", hoped to expand the reach of his Second Spring work internationally. The work in this direction was temporarily suspended at his death, but in 2017 Leonie used her own funds to re-launch the website at second spring.co.uk, including an online version of the journal, Second Spring Current. =Writing= Caldecott's writing draws on the work of Hans Urs von Balthasar, Joseph Ratzinger, Pope John Paul II, Henri de Lubac, Luigi Giussani, G. K. Chesterton, John Henry Newman, Jacques Maritain, and many other Catholic intellectuals. Caldecott's articles appeared in Oasis, the National Catholic Register, Touchstone, This Rock, Radical Orthodoxy Journal, The Chesterton Review, Communio and Parabola. He was a senior contributor to The Imaginative Conservative. Additionally, he organized conferences, such as, example, \\"Beyond the Prosaic\\" on the reform of the Liturgy, and \\"Eternity in Time\\", on Christopher Dawson's contribution to the Catholic idea of history, which proceedings were subsequently published.\\"Mammana Jr., Richard J. \\"The Recovery of the Altars\\", Review of Beyond the Prosaic, (Stratford Caldecott, ed.), Edinburgh: T & T Clark, 1998, Touchstone Magazine, January/February 2000Eternity in Time: Christopher Dawson and the Catholic Idea of History, (Stratford Caldecott, and John Morrill, eds.), T & T Clark International, 2000 In his work for Sophia Institute Press, the Catholic Truth Society, The Chesterton Review, the U.S. edition of Communio (founded in the 1970s by Hans Urs von Balthasar), Oasis, and many others, he served as a leader for those interested in Catholic engagement with culture, respectful inter-religious dialogue, integral human development and ressourcement. Christendom Awake, for whom he wrote a number of articles, maintains a page with biographical information, a partial bibliography, and some links to Caldecott's work. On Tolkien J. R. R. Tolkien was among the writers whose works influenced Caldecott's conversion to Christianity. Caldecott became an authority on the Christian themes in The Lord of the Rings. *He was a contributing editor to A Hidden Presence, the Catholic Imagination of J.R.R. Tolkien.The Hidden Presence, The Chesterton Press (2003) ASIN: B000NL05RE In Catholic Literary Giants, Joseph Pearce notes Caldecott's contribution to A Hidden Presence and recommends the volume as a valuable scholarly contribution to the literature on Tolkien's work.Pearce, Joseph.

The Power of the Ring explores the spiritual, theological, and philosophical meaning of the work – Tolkien's faith, which was influenced by the Oratory of St Philip.Caldecott, Stratford. \\"Bibliography\\", Beauty in Education * Caldecott's essay, \\"The Lord & Lady of the Rings\\",Caldecott, Stratford. \\"The Lord & Lady of the Rings\\", Touchstone Magazine, January/February 2002 describing Marian influences in Tolkien's work, was cited by Sarah Jane Boss in her work on traditions of Marian doctrine and devotion.Boss, Sarah Jane. Mary, Continuum Books 2003 Death As a teenager Caldecott had fallen in love with America because of its comic books. He loved the fight between good and evil, and the theme of hope that the comics portrayed. When he was dying from prostate cancer in May 2014, he was too ill to see the latest Avenger's movie, Captain America: The Winter Soldier in the cinema and he was not expected to survive long enough for the Blu-Ray release. His daughter, Sophie Caldecott Lippiatt, initiated an online campaign to persuade the producer Marvel Studios and distributor Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to send a copy so that he could watch it at home. Many actors who have portrayed Marvel characters posted selfies with a \\"Cap for Strat\\" sign in support of the request.Dickey, Josh. \\"Avengers Assemble for Terminal Cancer Patient's 'Winter Soldier' Wish\\", Mashable, May 16, 2014 In response, Marvel agreed to arrange an exclusive advanced screening on DVD for Caldecott at his home. Ms. Lippiatt, who blogs under the name Sophie Caldecott, stated, \\"\\"He doesn't like the limelight, but is so very touched. It means a lot to him that this isn't just about blessing his last days, but also about a wider campaign to raise awareness about prostate cancer.\\"Withnall, Adam. \\"How I assembled the Avengers\\", The Independent, May 19, 2014 This was particularly poignant because a late diagnosis had taken away Caldecott's chance of a longer life. Caldecott's final thoughts on life and faith, death and eternal life were presented in an essay published in the online journal The Imaginative Conservative.Caldecott, Stratford. \\"Search for the Secret of Life and Death\\", The Imaginative conservative, May 21, 2014 His funeral Mass was celebrated at the Oxford Oratory on Thursday, July 31. He is buried in Wolvercote Cemetery, Oxford, near Tolkien, his literary hero.Dodd, Liz. \\"Catholic Author to be Buried beside his Inspiration, Tolkien\\", the Tablet, July 21, 2014 His life and passing were noted in the U.S. and Europe and by The American Conservative, and Hollywood stars such as Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey, Jr. (The Denver Post noted their participation in a project to honor him.) Legacy The news of his death touched an international array of people who considered him a polymath, one of the most influential contemporary Catholics of the Anglophone world, an inspiration, a trustworthy thinker and a prolific contributor to the Catholic intellectual tradition. Kathy Schiffer of Ave Maria Radio, described Caldecott as \\"a giant in the Catholic world\\".Schiffer, Kathy. \\"R.I.P. Stratford Caldecott, 'Marvel' of Catholicism\\", Patheos, July 17, 2014 Pierpaolo Finaldi, Managing Editor of The Catholic Truth Society, noted Caldecott's \\"encyclopaedic knowledge of the faith\\". Michael J. Lichens, editor of the website Catholic Exchange, described Caldecott as \\"...without a doubt, the most powerful voice for Catholic culture in the Anglophone world.\\" Caldecott's influence continues to grow, despite his death, as others study his enormous body of work. He is cited, for instance, in Joseph Pearce's Catholic Literary Giants, Charlotte Ostermann's Souls at Rest, and Paul Kerry's The Ring and the Cross. In the tradition of the Catholic communio movement, he made a contribution of lasting significance to the work of returning all things to Christ fulfilled through the Faith. His own citations of the work of his contemporaries leads his readers to the work of authors such as Aidan Walker, Tracey Rowland, D.C. Schindler, John Milbank, Aidan Nichols, David Clayton, Carol and Philip Zaleski, Archbishop Javier Martinez, Jean Borella , David L. Schindler, and Mary Taylor, among many others. Caldecott is a figure of unique importance as a bridge builder, whose wide-ranging interests continue to draw people together in a friendship of rich ideas and aspirations.  Citations and tributes  David B. Burrell recommends The Grandeur of Reason and notes particularly Caldecott's approach to the problem of a perception of polarity between faith and reason by explicit attention to culture. Peter Casarella cites \\"The Marian Dimension of Existence\\" in Healy and Schindler, eds. Being Holy in the World in \\"Public Reason and Intercultural Dialogue\\" in At the Limits of the Secular: Reflections on Faith and Public Life, William A. Barbieri, Jr. ed, Eerdmans 2014. Apart from his writing, Caldecott established an international network of relationships he developed and in his interest in the work of others as in his own original thinking. The many tributes that appeared after his death help to convey a sense of that richness.\\"Requiescat in Pace, Stratford\\", Angelico PressTodd Aglialoro, Todd. \\"Stratford Caldecott: Farewell\\", Catholic Answers, July 18, 2014 In 2014, a volume of essays in his honor, The Beauty of God's House was published posthumously and received its own positive reviews.

Moss, 572 U.S. _ (2014), was a United States Supreme Court case holding secret service officers who moved protesters away from the president were protected by qualified immunity. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote the opinion for a unanimous court. The case arose out of a campaign stop President George W. Bush made during the 2004 presidential campaign. Prior to the campaign event, Bush dined at a restaurant near where a group of supporters and a group of protesters had gathered. Two secret service agents directed local police to move the protesters to protect the president. The protesters sued the agents in the U.S. District Court of the District of Oregon. The agents filed a motion to dismiss which was eventually granted based upon the Supreme Court's decision. Background = Factual background = President George W. Bush went to Jacksonville, Oregon for a campaign event for the 2004 presidential election. Two groups assembled, with permission, on opposite sides of a street near the venue: a group of supporters and a group of protesters. President Bush decided to make an unplanned stop for food at the Jacksonville Inn prior to the event, causing the protesters to move closer to the restaurant.. Two secret service officers, with the help of local police, made the decision to move the protesters to another block, causing the protesters to then be further away from restaurant than the supporters. After the President's meal, the President's motorcade left the restaurant and its route left protesters too far away to be seen or heard. = Procedural history = The protesters filed suit against the two secret service agents in U. S. District Court for the District of Oregon. The protesters claimed the actions of the officers had violated the protesters' First Amendment rights, specifically engaging in view point discrimination by moving the protesters further away than the supporters. The agents moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and further arguing they were protected by qualified immunity. The District Court denied the motion. The U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit then reversed on interlocutory appeal, but instructed the lower court to allow protesters the opportunity to amend their complaint. The protesters supplemented their complaint with allegations the secret service systematically attempted to remove protesters from the vicinity of event sites and motorcade routes. Ibid. The agents again moved to dismiss and the District Court denied the motion. On a second interlocutory appeal the Ninth Circuit affirmed. The Supreme Court granted certiorari.  Opinion of the Court  In a unanimous opinion, authored by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court held the two secret service agents were entitled to qualified immunity. To circumvent the doctrine of qualified immunity, the protesters would need to show the violation of a constitutional right and that the right was \\"clearly established\\" at the time of the conduct. Only one prior Supreme Court case had addressed the qualified immunity of secret service agents. Hunter v. Bryant, applied qualified immunity to secret service agents who had arrested an individual for a threat to assassinate the president. In other cases, the Court has recognized the importance of protecting the chief executive. Ibid. Although the Ninth Circuit had found fault with the secret service agents for failing to provide a reason for treating the supporters and protesters differently, the Supreme Court found that no existing law would have alerted the secret service agents that they had an obligation under the First Amendment to give each group comparable locations at all times. The Court was persuaded there was a security motive for moving the protesters, who had been in weapons range with an unobstructed view of the President dining on the patio and there would have been no such rationale for moving the supporters. Ibid. No existing law required the secret service to interfere with the speech rights of supporters more than security concerns necessitated. The Court also rejected the protesters' allegation that the secret service agents moved the protesters to engage in viewpoint discrimination. After noting that a White House manual urging political operatives to work with secret service designate a protest area outside of the view of presidential motorcades was not actually the policy of the secret service itself, the Court noted the actual agents themselves would need to have acted with discriminatory intent. The Court found it persuasive that a security motive existed for moving the protesters.  Subsequent legal action  The Supreme Court's decision dismissed the claims against the two secret service agents, however, other claims against the Jacksonville Chief of Police, the city of Jacksonville and former Sheriff remained active. Protesters who were detained were certified as a class whereas individual claims of excessive force, including a claim from Michael Moss, the named respondent in Wood v. Moss, proceeded individually.  Responses and analysis  This case was one of several to allege the Bush administration used the secret service to keep protesters away from Bush's public appearances. The New Republic found the decision to be a hopeful one for future protections for free speech. Although the protesters lost, The New Republic noted that the Court indicated that acting purely based on viewpoint discrimination might have yielded a different result. The New Republic also found Ginsburg's treatment of the field manual as disapproving. The American Civil Liberties Union released a statement expressing its disappointment with the decision to dismiss the case. The organization believed a jury should have been able to decide whether the secret service was censuring speech.

Beginning her career as a teacher, Štebi became involved in women's rights and moved into politics and journalism. Addressing the lack of civic, political and social equality and she used her writing and political stances to advance an equal society. Though supportive of a united Yugoslavia, she was cautious about losing rights that the various states had if they joined. She founded the Feminist Alliance of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to unite women in the newly formed state to advocate for equal pay, civil marriage, protections for children and a social safety net for workers. Early life Alojzija Štebi was born on 24 March 1883 in Ljubljana, which at the time was part of Austria-Hungary to Marija (née Kunstel) and Anton Štebi. She was known familiarly as \\"Lojzka\\". Štebi attended the girls’ primary and high schools before entering teacher's training in 1899. She graduated in 1903 from Ljubljana' normal school. Career After completing her studies, Štebi immediately went to work in Tainach, Carinthia as a substitute teacher. The following year, she began work as a full-time teacher in Tržič and in 1911 began writing about women's issues. By 1912, was writing for a socialist newspaper, Zarja (Dawn). Simultaneously, she began editing the newspaper of the Slovene members of the Austrian Trade Union of Tobacco Workers, Tobačni delavec (Tobacco worker). In 1913, Štebi was elected to the Carniolan Provincial Assembly representing the Yugoslav Social- Democratic Party and began speaking at meetings in the region. Her leftist activities and ideology created conflict with school authorities, resulting in her resignation in 1914. She continued her writing and editing, including becoming an editor in 1915 for the women's socialist gazette, Ženski list (Women’s newspaper); editor-in chief of the social democrats' daily newspaper, Naprej (Forward) in 1917; and chief editor of the gazette Demokracija (Democracy) in 1918. In 1917, Štebi, who supported establishing a Yugoslavian state, joined with other social democrat women to found the Slovene Social Society (), hoping to protect the rights of women and children in the proposed new state. She feared that adopting a Serbian-style civil code would diminish civil rights of Slovenian women and pressed for changes that would protect women throughout the diverse cultures in a united Yugoslavian state. In 1918, she published an important paper, Demokratizem in ženstvo (Democracy and womanhood), outlining a program to improve women’s educational opportunities, grant women's suffrage and protect civil rights. While believing that women should have equal access to civil, social and political rights, Štebi felt that women and men had different skills. She expressed that if women used their maternal instincts, they could be effective in creating social change by strengthening societal morality, creating a less fractious society. That same year, she began working for the national government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as a superintendent in the Department for Youth Welfare in Ljubljana. It would be the first of several government positions Štebi held, concerned with social welfare and policy, before she was pushed out of government in 1927 due to her politics. Štebi was a member of the National Women’s Association of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes between 1919 and 1923, but left the organization because of their ineffectiveness. That same year, she founded the Feminist Alliance of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which was renamed in 1926 to the Women’s Movements’ Alliance of Yugoslavia (). Štebi served as president of the organization, which aimed to provide civil, political and social equality for women, until 1927. The organization spread across the country and served as a means of uniting their varying cultures to a common cause. She saw socialism as a means of reorganizing society's attitudes towards women, and had read widely, including works by August Bebel, Friedrich Engels, Ellen Key, Rosa Luxemburg, Karl Marx, and Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk. During this time frame, she participated in numerous international women's groups and conferences, such as the 1923 Rome Congress of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance (IWSA); the 1925 Little Entente of Women (LEW) conference held in Belgrade; the 1925 Meeting of the International Council of Women (ICW) in Washington, D.C.; the 1926 Women's Conference of Prague; the 1929 Berlin Congress of the IWSA; the 1934 Paris Council of the ICW; and the 1936 Dubrovnik Council of the ICW. Moving to Belgrade, in 1927, Štebi began editing a journal for the AZPJ, Ženski pokret (Women’s movement), which she would edit until 1938. The journal was published in Slovene, Croatian and Serbian. She published two booklets which were translated into French to explain the Yugoslav women's movement to international audiences—Le travail des féministes Yugoslaves (1931) and L’activité des sociétés feminines en Yugosloavie (1936). Štebi became employed in 1933 as an assistant secretary to the Ministry of Social Policy and National Health. In that role, she became an advocate for eugenics, based upon the Norwegian model, which focused on the social need for family planning, rather than on a state policy of targeting undesirables. Štebi also pushed for measures to provide parity between men and women in domestic, personal and political spheres. In addition to suffrage, she advocated for civil marriage, equal custody of children, and recognition of illegitimate offspring. She believed in equal property laws, which conferred equal inheritance, but also saw that redefining property rights could be used to redefine social and political roles. On the economic front, Štebi proposed that domestic work be evaluated as paid labor, that civil employees be paid equal wages and that insurance should be extended to cover accidents, death, illness, injuries and old age for both sexes. She also proposed that women be allowed to participate in Labor Inspector positions to implement controls for the benefit of social welfare and health. Štebi advocated against child labor and worker exploitation. In 1940, Štebi returned to Ljubljana and because of poor health moved in with her brother, Anton Štebi (sl) and his wife , a women's rights activist. The household joined the Slovene Partisans in 1941 as collaborators, which resulted in her brother's murder by the Nazis and her sister-in-law's deportation and death in Auschwitz by the following year. When the war ended, Štebi returned to government work for the newly formed People's Republic of Slovenia. She worked in the Department of Education and Improvement of Human resources, becoming head of the department in 1947. The following year, she was promoted to head the Board of Administration for Workers. After two years, Štebi transferred from the Ministry of Work to the Ministry of Education and briefly worked in the Department of Vocational Schools before her retirement in 1950. From 1950 until 1956, she took contract assignments from the Ministry of Education. Death and legacy Štebi died on 9 August 1956, in Ljubljana. At the time of her death, Štebi's contributions were viewed with disfavor by the communist regime.

Logan Huffman, Natalia Warner, and Brandon Tyler Sklenar star as Americans who visit Japan to research local temples. Once there, they become obsessed with investigating a temple said to be haunted. It is an international co-production between the United States and Japan.  Plot  In Japan, a professor and his interpreter question a wounded and bandaged man. Both ask questions of each other that go unanswered. When the professor plays a videotape, the wounded man flashes back to before he was injured. Kate, a university student studying comparative religion, invites her friend Chris, who is recovering from the loss of his brother, to join her in a trip to Japan, where she intends to study local temples. Kate's boyfriend, James, though surprised to find Kate and Chris have been platonic friends since childhood, says he is not jealous of their relationship. Chris, who speaks some Japanese, translates for the group when they arrive in Japan. After engaging in sight-seeing, they stop at a book store. Kate finds a book of Japanese folklore and becomes intrigued by a temple depicted in it. When Chris attempts to purchase the book, the proprietor abruptly refuses to sell it and closes her shop. Confused, the trio return to their hotel. Later that night, Chris and James visit a club, where Chris sees James kiss and dance with other women. Upon leaving the club, Chris returns to the bookstore, where he comes upon a young boy, Seita, who claims to work there. After Seita sells him the folklore book, Chris experiences several strange encounters, feeling that something is stalking him. At a bar, a man tells him that the temple depicted in the book is nearby but is rumored to be haunted, and the bartender gives him directions to a village near the temple. Though they warn him to stay away, Chris presents the book to Kate, who becomes excited to visit it; James is less enthused. They at first have trouble finding a villager that will talk to them, but one tells them of a man named Hitoshi, who returned from a trip to the temple blind and claiming to have had visions. The trio at first laugh off the stories. Chris gets them a room at an inn, where he comes upon Seita again. Seita, who says he lives in the village, offers to take them to the temple the next day. After agreeing, Chris sees an eyeless man; he identifies himself as Hitoshi and reveals that 50 years ago, several children went missing. The villagers found a monk at the temple, and, not believing his story, killed him. That night, Chris watches Kate and James as they have sex until he becomes convinced he has seen someone outside his room. James is annoyed at both the commotion Chris causes and that Chris has apparently been spying on them. The next day, Seita leads them to the temple. Along the way, they find an abandoned mine, which James wants to explore. He reluctantly leaves it so they can reach the temple before dark. Seita leaves for home shortly after they arrive. The temple is guarded by the statue of a kitsune, a legendary fox-human hybrid. James is disappointed in the temple but agrees to let Kate explore it. After being spooked by something in the forest while examining a nearby graveyard, she agrees they should leave. Before they can, hands pull Chris through a wooden floor, and he breaks his leg. James makes a splint and promises to return to town for help in the morning. However, when James overhears a conversation between Chris and Kate in which she alludes to having had an abortion without telling James, he leaves immediately. Chris and Kate cuddle together until Kate hears James cry out in the distance. A kitsune chases after James. Following his cries, Kate returns to the mine, only to find him disfigured and eyeless. When she flees, she discovers the mine's entrance has collapsed, trapping her. At the same time, the missing children attack Chris at the temple. In the present, the bandaged man, whom the professor believes to be Chris, denies having killed Kate and James, despite evidence from Chris' camera, which apparently shows him attacking James. The bandaged man becomes enraged when they deny that Seita is there with them, and he stabs the translator with a pen before escaping the room.

Justin Low of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film \\"comes off as more of a half-hearted attempt at exploiting typical J-horror themes than an actual homage\\". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kimber Myers said that the film has some nice visuals but offers nothing new. Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine rated it one out of five stars and called it a \\"walking tour of J-horror's hoariest signposts\\" that might have been better had Simon Barrett's regular partner, Adam Wingard, directed it. Ryan Larson of Nightmarish Conjurings gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"Although the movie is very clearly filled with good intentions, it misses the mark. It can’t quite decide how scary it wants to be, what monsters it wants to use, it can’t even decide which character it wants the female lead to end up with.\\" Matt Boiselle from Dread Central awarded the film one and a half out of five stars, panning the film's slow pacing, lack of suspense, and conclusion. Simon Abrams from Roger Ebert.com gave the film a \\"Thumbs down\\", calling the film\\" dull and misconceived\\", and panning the film's pacing, plot, ineffective scares, \\"boring\\" characters, and cinematography. Jake Dee of Arrow in the Head rated the film a score of four out of ten, calling it \\" a boring, underdone conjuration of worn out J-horror convention\\".

Reign She is presumably the namesake of one of her ancestors named Komosarye, another Bosporan queen of relative significance who also married her cousin named Paerisades. After the death of her grandfather Leukon II, she was presumably too young to rule as heir so Hygiainon, a prominent member of the aristocracy, ruled as Archon and probably as regent presumably until she or her father were of age. He ruled until 200 BC, at which point her father Spartokos became king and ruled until 180 BC. She became queen in 180 BC and was very politically active throughout her reign as queen being mentioned in many inscriptions, such as with her and her husband Paerisades being honored at Delphi for the treatment of foreigners in their kingdom. At some point during her reign, she took the surname \\"Philoteknos\\" which means \\"children-adoring\\" possibly to show a strong bond with her children. She bore presumably two sons to Paerisades, Paerisades IV and Paerisades V, the last kings of the Bosporan Kingdom.

In 1985, Masel co-authored Blacklisted News: Secret Histories from Chicago, '68 to 1984, a comprehensive history of the Youth International Party. Masel published the underground newspaper Zenger from 1987 to 1993. Until his death, Masel maintained online political action blogs and petitions at Myspace, Facebook, and alternative media sites. =Election campaigns and advocacy= Ben Masel at the Great Midwest Marijuana Harvest Festival in 2008 According to Steve DeAngelo, the first Hemp Tour in 1989 was Masel's idea. Jack Herer visited fourteen American cities, promoting the revised edition of his book The Emperor Wears No Clothes, in 1989. In 1990, Masel ran against Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson in the Republican primary. When the 1990 Midwest Marijuana Harvest Festival at the Wisconsin Capitol drew the criticism of Attorney General Don Hanaway, Masel challenged Hanaway to a chess match in order to prove that cannabis does not diminish intelligence. Hanaway declined Masel's chess game challenge. During a 1992 write-in bid for Dane County sheriff, Masel's campaign poster pictured him naked with the slogan: \\"Nothing to Hide, Masel for Sheriff.\\" He got more than 7,000 votes. And when he made the ballot in 1994 as the Democratic candidate for sheriff, Masel received more than 39,000 votes. Masel challenged US Senator Herb Kohl in the Democratic primary in 2006 and got over 50,000 votes (about fifteen percent). At the time he was diagnosed with cancer in 2011, Masel was again seeking the Wisconsin Democratic Party endorsement for US senator. =Civil rights career= Masel was a professional protester. He got a $95,000 settlement from Sauk County, Wisconsin, after police officers wearing body armor arrested about a dozen Weedstock festival-goers, including Masel, who refused an order to vacate the grounds after being told the festival could not be held on a private field there, in 2000. On June 29, 2006, while lawfully gathering signatures during an election campaign, Masel was confronted by two University of Wisconsin–Madison police officers who threw him to the ground, pinned him with a knee on his back and then pepper-sprayed him in the face. Masel's federal civil rights suit against police officers John McCaughtry and Michael Mansavage which was heard at trial in 2009 before a hung jury and was to be reheard at a second trial in 2010, was settled out of court. Masel agreed to accept $7,500 from the state of Wisconsin to dismiss the appeal. A longtime friend of Masel, Amy Gros-Louis, told a Wisconsin State Journal reporter that \\"Ben knew the laws better than the police did.\\" Masel fought limitations to free speech and the right to assemble. Whenever police tried to stop him, he would sue. And he usually won, according to Jeff Scott Olson, Masel's lawyer. =Legacy and recognition= In April, 2011, Masel was recognized by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws board of directors with an award of special appreciation for \\"A Lifetime of Outstanding Work in Advancing the Cause of Legalizing Marijuana.\\" The 420 Chess Club held an online competition called The Ben Masel Memorial 420 Chess Tournament from May, 2011, through February, 2012. Masel was named High Times' Freedom Fighter of the Month in August, 2011. On May 17, 2011, the City of Madison Common Council declared April 20 to be Ben Masel Day. Illness and death In January, 2011, Masel was diagnosed with lung cancer. He underwent a series of radiation treatments and was given steroids to aid his breathing, but became too weak to undergo chemotherapy. Nevertheless, Masel remained upbeat and never stopped demonstrating, even defying his doctor's advice in order to join a month-long labor rights protest being held at the Wisconsin State Capitol during April. Masel, who did not have health insurance, died in a hospice, surrounded by friends and family, on April 30, 2011. He is survived by his daughter, Semilla Anderson, and granddaughter, Anandi.

John Houstoun McIntosh was chosen as \\"Director\\" of the self-named Patriots in March, 1812, to receive formal Spanish capitulation at Amelia Island. In July, while under the occupation of U.S. forces, the Patriots created a constitution of government that provided for an executive office, a legislative council, and a court system. Under its provisions, on July 27 McIntosh was named \\"Director of the Territory of East Florida\\". He was later succeeded in that office by Gen. Buckner Harris. Patriots wished neither independence nor statehood in the United States; they desired annexation by the U.S., connoted by the word \\"Territory\\" in their name of the country, and as expressly declared by the delegates at their constitutional convention. John Houstoun McIntosh marker in McIntosh County, Georgia, USA commemorating McIntosh's role as the first American \\"Governor or Director\\" of the Republic of Florida  History  =General Mathews and Patriots= In 1812, General George Mathews and Colonel John McKee were commissioned by President James Madison as agents \\"with secret instructions \\"to repair to that quarter with all possible expedition,\\" for the purpose of carrying out the intentions of the act...\\" (i.e., a secret Act of Congress on January 15, 1811) and to approach the Spanish governor in an attempt to acquire East Florida. Their instructions were to take possession of any part of the territory of the Floridas upon making \\"arrangement\\" with the \\"local authority\\" to deliver possession to the U.S. Barring that and an attempted occupation by any foreign government, they were not to take possession of any part of Florida.Cusick 2007, p. 2 McKee recused himself, while Mathews proceeded on the mission to East Florida and moved into a house at St. Marys, Georgia. Being unable to satisfy his instructions straightforwardly, he schemed to organize a rebel group to seize the local governing authority. However, the local inhabitants had little cause for complaint toward the Spanish government, as the province was enjoying prosperity from the markets in cotton and timber, with prices high and demand increasing. The town of Fernandina on Amelia Island was a neutral or free port at which a large and lucrative trade was carried on with many nations. It was also a center of the illicit trade of cotton with Great Britain and smuggling in general. A revolution at this time was not to rise organically among the inhabitants. Instead, Mathews set about recruiting leaders of a rebellion among the frontier inhabitants in the northern part of the province, mostly Georgia militiamen, wood-choppers and boatmen from the neighborhood of St. Marys. They were supported by slave-holding planters who wanted to stop raiding parties of Seminole Indians from the Alachua region and feared the presence of armed free black militias in Spanish Florida.Cusick 2003, p.49 Mathews persuaded their leaders that he had the full authorization of a United States government that was determined to take possession of East Florida. Mathews not only promised arms and the support of the U.S. military to the rebels in order to wrest control of the Spanish fort at Fernandina but also to defend the territory once they, as the new local authority, ceded it to the United States. On March 14, 1812, the self-named \\"Patriots of Amelia Island\\" armed and assembled on the Florida side of the St. Mary's River. They selected temporary officers under the supervision of Gen. Mathews. Accounts of the group's size range from 250 to 357, but only a small number were Spanish subjects. On March 16, nine American gunboats under the command of Commodore Hugh Campbell lined up in the harbor at Fernandina with guns aimed at the town as cover for the Patriot volunteers. Gen. Mathews, still ensconced at Point Peter on the St. Marys River in Georgia, demanded that Justo López, commandant of Fort San Carlos and Amelia Island, surrender. López acknowledged the superior force and surrendered the port and the town. On March 17, John H. McIntosh, representing the Patriots, and George J. F. Clarke and Justo López, representing the Spanish government, signed the articles of capitulation; the Patriots then raised their own standard. The next day, a detachment of 250 regular United States troops were brought over from Point Peter, and the Patriots surrendered the town to Gen. Mathews, who had the U.S. flag raised immediately. As agreed, the Patriots held Fernandina for only one day before turning authority over to the U.S. military, an event that soon gave the U.S. control of the coast to St. Augustine. Within several days the Patriots, along with a regiment of regular Army troops and Georgian volunteers, moved toward St. Augustine. On this march the Patriots were slightly in advance of the American troops. The Patriots would proclaim possession of some ground, raise the Patriot flag, and as the \\"local authority\\" surrender the territory to the United States troops, who would then substitute the American flag for the Patriot flag. The Patriots faced no opposition as they marched, usually with Gen. Mathews. Accounts of witnesses state that the Patriots could have made no progress but for the protection of the U.S. forces and could not have maintained their position in the country without the aid of the U.S. troops. The American troops and Patriots acted in close concert, marching, camping, foraging and fighting together. In this way, the American troops sustained the Patriots. As soon as the U.S. government was notified of these events, Congress became alarmed at the possibility of being drawn into war with Spain, and the effort fell apart. Secretary of State James Monroe promptly disavowed the actions and relieved Gen. Mathews of his commission on May 9, on the grounds that neither of the instructed contingencies had occurred. Monroe ordered the withdrawal of American troops with instructions \\"to restore back to the Spanish authorities Amelia Island and such other posts of East Florida as had been thus taken from them.\\" In his letter, Monroe wrote, in regard to the forcible taking of Spanish territory, \\"I forbear to dwell on the details of this transaction because it is too painful to recite them.\\" However, negotiations with the Spanish authorities were protracted and slow. Through the summer and autumn, the U.S. and Patriot troops foraged and plundered almost every plantation and farm, most of them having been abandoned by their owners. The troops helped themselves to everything they could find. Stored food was used up, growing crops destroyed or fed to horses, all types of movable property plundered or destroyed, buildings and fences burned, cattle and hogs killed or stolen for butchering, and slaves often dispersed or abducted. This continued until May 1813 and left the formerly inhabited parts in a state of desolation. Negotiations concluded for the withdrawal of U.S. troops in 1813. On May 6, 1813, the army lowered the flag at Fernandina and crossed the St. Marys River to Georgia with the remaining troops. Spain took possession of the redoubt at Fort San Carlos and regained control of the region. =Elotchaway= On January 10, 1814, Gen. Buckner Harris of Georgia led a group of volunteers to the former site of Paynes Town, home of the leader of the Alachua band of Seminoles, King Payne, which had been burned down by the United States troops in 1813. This site was located a considerable distance inland, southwest of St. Augustine and south of present-day Gainesville. There they constructed a small blockhouse they called Fort Mitchell after the former governor of Georgia, David Mitchell. The settlers met as a legislative assembly on January 25, 1814, and declared the area to be the \\"District of Elotchaway of the Republic of East Florida\\". President James Madison officially refused to recognize the Republic of East Florida on April 19, 1814, a devastating blow to the hopes of the Patriots. Meanwhile, the Spanish governor, Sebastián Kindelán, placed a bounty on Harris to reward the Seminoles for collecting his scalp. On May 5, 1814, they ambushed, killed and scalped Harris. His murder left the Patriots leaderless and terminated the attempt to resurrect a Republic of East Florida. =End of rebellion= The white population of East Florida, outside of St. Augustine, consisted of a few hundred persons scattered along the St. Johns, Nassau, and St. Marys Rivers. The revolution affected a narrow strip of settled territory along the east coast of Florida, north of St. Augustine, about sixty miles long by fifteen to twenty in width. After the Spanish reoccupation in 1813, Governor Kindelán established three local governing districts under the Spanish Constitution of 1812 in this strip of territory. They were Fernandina (Amelia, Tiger, and Talbot Islands, both banks of the Nassau River and the south bank of the St. Marys, bordering the U.S.), Upper St. Johns (along the upper part of that river) and Lower St. Johns (everything downriver, including San Pablo Inlet and Fort George Island). He appointed a capitán de partido (equivalent to a constable and justice of the peace) to serve in each district, with small detachments of troops. In the St. Johns River districts, this system lasted until the end of Spanish rule in Florida, but not in the territory along and between the Nassau and St. Marys Rivers, where trouble involving the malcontents continued until 1816. Vignoles described the three years that followed the resumption of hostilities in August, 1813, as a time of anarchy and desolation, in contrast to the stated purpose in the Patriots' failed constitution \\"that a Government should be established in this Province to prevent anarchy and confusion.\\"Dippel, Horst (ed.). \\"United States of America, Florida: Failed Constitution (1812)\\". Constitutions of the World from the late 18th Century to the Middle of the 19th Century Online. K. G. Saur Verlag. In the state of anarchy endemic to the area, civil disturbances were prevalent, and the rebellion begun in 1812 persisted, with hostility directed at the Spanish authorities on Amelia Island. In 1816, Governor Coppinger sent Clarke, Zephaniah Kingsley, and Henry Yonge, Jr. to parley with the malcontents and negotiate an agreement by which the hostility might cease. The three commissioners met forty \\"people of the main\\" at Mill's Ferry on the St. Marys and arranged for a general meeting of the men of the region to be convened at Waterman's Bluff in three weeks. Clarke and the other two commissioners went to the meeting and offered a \\"plan of reconciliation and re-establishment of order\\", proposing that the malcontents accept Spanish rule under a plan that divided the territory between the St. Marys and St. Johns into three self- governing districts, to be known as Upper St. Marys, Lower St. Marys, and Nassau (Amelia Island). Each district was to have a magistrate's court and its own militia, the officers to be elected by the people. The group accepted these conditions, and Clarke's plan was adopted. = Flag = East Florida Patriot flag On March 14, 1812, a group of men calling themselves the \\"Patriots\\" assembled at Rose's Bluff, across the river from St. Marys, and raised their standard of revolt against the Spanish government of East Florida. This was a flag designed by Colonel Ralph Isaacs, Mathew's aide-de- camp, with a white field on which the blue figure of a soldier was depicted charging with his bayonet. Beneath him was the Latin motto: Salus populi lex suprema (The safety of the people, the supreme law).Patriots Flag. (2017). Florida Flag History. MyFlorida.

Formed in 1915 as a hostilities-only battalion, it was part of the East Surrey Regiment garrisoned at Witley, England. Going to France in 1916, it saw action at the battles of the Somme, Cambrai, Arras and the Lys. Formation The battalion was formed in Wandsworth by the Mayor on 16 June 1915, and the War Office recognised the battalion on 28 August 1915. The separate 14th (Service) Battalion (Wandsworth) East Surrey Regiment was absorbed into other training reserve battalions in June 1916. The 13th Battalion wore a special cap badge, authorised by the War Office. The arms of Wandsworth were displayed at the centre of the badge, instead of the arms of Guildford, worn more generally by the East Surrey Regiment. Western Front =1916= After training in southern England, the battalion landed at Le Harve on 4 June 1916. They were then moved to Lens and from there with the 40th Division moved to the Hohenzollern Redoubt where they relieved the 12th Battalion, Suffolk Regiment. They were not involved in major actions at the Hohenzollern Redoubt, but artillery bombardment was starting to take a toll, with casualties of 16%. The battalion was then put into reserve for the next months while the 40th Division was being relieved. The battalion was then temporarily attached to the 49th Division to help relieve the 4th Battalion, King's Own Yorkshire Light Infantry at Hébuterne near the town of Albert, during the Battle of the Somme. They soon rejoined the 40th Division and marched to Bouchavesnes Area near the Somme Valley where they spent Christmas. =1917= During the German withdrawal to the Hindenburg Line in the spring, the 13th Battalion were in the front line near Bouchavesnes. It was here, on 24 April during the Battle of Arras, that Corporal Edward Foster of the battalion won the Victoria Cross when he entered a heavily protected enemy trench and knocked out two machine guns, enabling the advance to continue. In the autumn, the battalion were heavily engaged in the Battle of Cambrai. =1918= The battalion fought at the Battle of the Lys during the German Spring Offensive and suffered severe loses when surrounded at Fleurbaix. In May, the battalion was reduced to cadre strength. After a period attached to the US Army for training purposes, the battalion returned to England on 30 June. Stationed in Lowestoft, they absorbed the newly formed 15th Battalion East Surrey Regiment and were disbanded on 3 November 1918. Post war After the war, to recognise their service, each Service Battalion that served overseas was presented with a King’s Colour. The colour of the 13th Battalion was presented at a special ceremony on Wandsworth Common on 16 July 1921, in the presence of over 350 former members of the battalion.

Her music has been used on television series such as the opening theme songs of Dynasties (\\"Game of Survival\\"), Shadowhunters (\\"This Is the Hunt\\"), and The Shannara Chronicles (\\"Until We Go Down\\"). Early life and education Born the middle child of three sisters, Eckford grew up in Hattiesburg, Mississippi and attended a private Christian high school. She attended music school in Sydney, Australia. Ruelle is now based in Nashville, Tennessee. She adopted the French word \\"Ruelle\\" as her stage name because she liked how it gave off a sense of darkness and mystery, and how it has multiple meanings, including \\"chamber\\". Music Though Nashville is known for country music and rock-and- roll, Ruelle's first two albums, For What It's Worth (2010) and Show and Tell (2012), released under her birth name Maggie Eckford were indie pop. She then adopted the stage name Ruelle to represent her musical career, and moved towards electronic pop with EPs Up in Flames (2015), Madness (2016), and Rival (2017). Ruelle's first television placement was a song in a Japanese iPad commercial. Alongside the theme songs for Shadowhunters and The Shannara Chronicles, her songs have also been featured in numerous prime time television series, including Arrow, Inhumans, Dancing with the Stars, The Challenge XXX: Dirty 30, Cloak & Dagger, Eyewitness, Famous in Love, Grey's Anatomy, Guilt, How to Get Away with Murder, The Leftovers, Midnight, Texas, The Originals, Pretty Little Liars, Quantico, Reckless, Reign, Revenge, Riverdale, Scream, Sleepy Hollow, So You Think You Can Dance, Teen Wolf, Titans, The Vampire Diaries, The Walking Dead, Wynonna Earp, and The Village. She featured in both the trailer and the soundtrack for The Loft as well as trailers for Bad Moms, Before I Fall, Free State of Jones, and Keeping up with the Joneses. Her song Game of Survival featured in the 13 Reasons Why trailer, the Gears 5 trailer and the trailer for David Attenborough's BBC Earth series Dynasties. Madness is in Siren, and The Looming Tower trailer features the song Rivals. In July 2018, the released trailer for the upcoming series Titans by DC Universe features three of her songs such as Madness, Monsters' and Revolution. She also released the song Take it All, used in a trailer for the British soap Emmerdale. The song Slip Away was featured in an episode of Midnight, Texas season 2. Ruelle has collaborated with electronic music producer Ki:Theory, providing the vocals on his song Bringing Me Down. Ruelle's best-performing song on the Billboard charts was I Get to Love You, which reached #15 on the Spotify's Viral 50 on March 5, 2016. Ruelle also provided vocals to the song 10 Feet Down by NF, part of the album Perception which hit #1 on the Billboard 200 Chart in 2017. In January 2019, Wake Up World a collab track between Unsecret and Ruelle, was used for the first teaser of the STARZ exclusive limited series The Spanish Princess. Ruelle decided to split up her new album into two EPs as she felt that 10 songs at once can feel like a lot to digest. She wanted listeners to be able to give them all the attention they deserve. Earth Glow was released on Wednesday 7 August 2019 with 5 songs and then another EP soon after with another 5 songs. Her favorite song from the EP is the 4th song Like You Mean It because it is about her husband. Fleurie, a fellow artist and close friend, wrote Like You Mean It with Ruelle, alongside mutual friend Jeremy Lutito who also co- produced the EP. The second EP was released on the 22 November 2019 and is titled \\"Exodus\\". Fear of Letting Go (a popular one since it was already heard in Life Sentence) is on the second EP. Ruelle has also been collaborating with some friends since 2018 on the side project Club Yoko. Their song I AM was in the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 commercials.Samsung Mobile's commercial featuring \\"I Am\\" by Club Yoko Ruelle's single 'Good Day for Dreaming' was featured in Apple's iPhone 12 lineup launch event in October 2020.

It is located about north of Graz and crosses the Tannenben karst region. The cave has two accessible entrances, one at the village of Semriach and the other at the village of Peggau. At the Semriach entrance, the Lur River sinks into the cave. At the Peggau entrance, the Schmelz River emerges from within the cave, flowing to the west and eventually joining the Mur River.  History  Archaeologists have found material in and around the cave that indicates habitation since the Paleolithic era. One specimen, a reindeer bone with tool markings, has been radiocarbon dated to approximately 52,000 years ago. The cave was first scientifically explored by the Italian cave explorer Max Brunello on April 1, 1894. While the higher portions of the cave were known to locals, Brunello was the first to discover the lower portion of the cave. The next attempt to explore further provoked disaster. On April 29, 1894, seven cavers entered the Lurgrotte, despite heavy rainfall. A flash flood occurred while they were inside, and they wound up trapped for ten days. Emperor Franz Joseph I approved a rescue effort, employing large numbers of workers, miners, and divers who bailed out the water and successfully rescued the trapped cavers. In February 1905, members of the Austrian Tourist Club surveyed of passages within the Lurgrotte. In the 1920s, the cave explorer Hermann Mayer worked with his father to develop the Peggauer section of the Lurgrotte for visitors. In addition, they tried to find a link between the Peggauer entry and Semriach entry. On November 26, 1924, the route was cleared by explosives, but it was not until 1935 that the first crossing was possible. On May 23, 1926, the pioneering female cave explorer Leopoldine Fuhrich fell approximately to her death while exploring Lurgrotte.Antonius Lux (eds.): Great women of world history. Thousands of biographies in word and image. Sebastian Lux Verlag, Munich 1963, p. 176 There is a memorial plaque for her still inside the cave. On February 24, 1927, the city of Frohnleiten hosted an auction for the grotto, including a restaurant, two mansions, and of ground, in the interests of preserving the Lurgrotte as a domestic enterprise. On July 8, 1927, the District Court of Frohnleiten held another auction of the Lurgrotte, which was eventually won by a wine-trader named Pezzi. Pezzi planned to turn the Lurgrotte into a show cave and construct railway through the cave. The first complete crossing of about long cave succeeded in 1935. In the following years the Lurgrotte was developed into a show cave, with infrastructure such as bridges, walkways, and lights added for visitors. From 1962 it was possible for visitors to wander through the entire cave, until 1975, when parts of the infrastructure were washed away in a powerful storm. Because the flooding recurs on a yearly basis, the full infrastructure has never been repaired.  Hydrology  The Schmelz River flowing from the Peggau entrance to the Lurgrotte. The Lurgrotte is a complex, three-level cave which forms a drainage system for the entire Tanneben karst area. Because of its complexity, and the difficulty in exploring the cave's numerous underground channels, the cave's hydrology is poorly understood. It is known that the Lur River enters at the Semriach entry, and the Schmelz River exits from the Peggau side. When rainfall is heavy, excess water from the Lur system can overflow into the Schmelz system, so it is confirmed that there is a high- water connection between the two, although its location and extent are still unknown.Hydrogeology of the Lurhollow System (PDF file) Attempts to trace the outflow using dye have shown that the water from the Lur emerges in springs south of the cave, while the flow of the Schmelz appears to originate from sources north of the Lurgrotte.  Tourism  Since the flooding of 1975, it is no longer possible to cross through the caves from one side to another. Visitors can instead tour through a shortened area at each end of the cave. From Peggau, regular guided tours enter into the cave, although in the winter longer tours of up to are available by appointment. From Semriach, tourists have access to approximately of the cave, including its largest gallery, called the Big Dome or the Bear Grotto due to the cave bear bones that have been found within. At long, wide, and a tall, it is one of Central Europe's largest underground rooms.

The episode was written by Eugenie Ross-Leming and Brad Buckner and directed by Phil Sgriccia. It was first broadcast on December 8, 2016, on The CW. In the episode, Lucifer possesses influential people, going as far as to possess the President of the United States. Using his new power, he tries to stop Sam and Dean from catching him. The episode received mixed-to-positive reviews with critics criticizing Lucifer's motives and actions in the episode. Plot Lucifer begins possessing people of power and influence, eventually possessing Jefferson Rooney, the President of the United States. While possessing Rooney, Lucifer conceives a powerful half-angel Nephilim with Rooney's unsuspecting staffer Kelly Kline (Courtney Ford), while his actions draw the attention of Sam (Jared Padalecki), Dean (Jensen Ackles), Crowley (Mark A. Sheppard), Castiel (Misha Collins), and Rowena (Ruth Connell). Lucifer sends the Secret Service to kill the Winchesters, but they are rescued by Arthur Ketch (David Haydn-Jones), who provides them with a device capable of expelling any angel or demon from their vessel. To draw Lucifer out into the open, Crowley kidnaps Kelly. They are able to convince her of the truth and she calls Lucifer to a motel room where the Winchesters, Castiel, Crowley, and Rowena ambush him. Using Arthur's device, Sam is able to exorcise Lucifer from Rooney and Rowena casts a spell believed to banish him back to his cage. However, the Winchesters are arrested by the Secret Service, who believe they were attempting to assassinate the President, and rather than aborting the Nephilim, Kelly flees from Castiel. Reception =Viewers= The episode was watched by 1.73 million viewers with a 0.6/2 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was a 4% decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 1.80 million viewers with a 0.6/2 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 0.6 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 2 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. Supernatural ranked as the second most watched program on The CW in the day, behind Legends of Tomorrow. =Critical reviews= \\"LOTUS\\" received mixed-to- positive reviews. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.3 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict: \\"'Lotus' was a fun, twisted ride that made for a satisfying midseason finale. It was more effective though as an end to the Lucifer story (for now) than it was as set up for the second half of the season. Kelly wanting to keep the nephilim didn't feel quite right. Wouldn't she assume, like anyone who can guess at horror movies, that Lucifer can come back through his own baby? Also, it just gives our heroes another person to track down (while hitting dead ends and doing monster-of-the-week work).\\" Sean McKenna from TV Fanatic, gave a 2.4 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"I wanted to like this episode and hoped it would be a major upswing from Supernatural Season 12 Episode 7. But it just felt lackluster for most of it and spent far too much time with Lucifer doing not much as the president. There certainly could be some interesting story to come from Lucifer's baby, but the contrived ending left me scratching my head rather than exuberantly looking forward to what's next.\\" Samantha Highfill from EW gave the episode a \\"B\\" and wrote, \\"And yet, it sets up a lot of potential drama for when we return next year. As much as I didn't believe how it happened, there's a certain element to Sam and Dean in jail that I can appreciate. After getting through hell and purgatory, it's human jail that they can't escape. (Then again, do we believe that someone couldn’t get them out?) Altogether, I almost wish the president story line spanned more than one episode because I feel like there was more fun to be had there.

Early life and career Moon was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1901. His father Roddy K. Moon established the Cleveland branch of the NAACP in 1912. Moon attended Howard University where he served as the editor of the school's University Journal. He then received a master's degree in journalism from Ohio State University. Moon's goal at the time was to become the first black journalist to work for a white-owned newspaper. However, in 1925 he went to work in public relations at the Tuskegee Institute instead. In 1931, he achieved his dream of becoming a newspaperman when he was offered a job at the African-American weekly The Amsterdam News. He moved to New York City and began writing book reviews and essays for the publication. The same year, he collaborated with fellow News journalist Ted Poston on a series of articles focusing on capital crimes. The two men became roommates and remained best friends for the rest of their lives. In 1932, they traveled to the Soviet Union with Langston Hughes and Moon's future wife Mollie Lewis to make an anti-segregation film called Black and White. The film was cancelled at the last minute by the Mezhrabpomfilm studio, causing Moon to have a lifelong disillusionment with the Communists. Unbeknownst to Moon, engineer Hugh Lincoln Cooper had threatened to stop work on the high-profile Dnieper Dam if the Soviet government did not halt the production of the film, which he viewed as un-American. After he returned to the US, Moon got a job with the Public Works Administration under Harold L. Ickes and continued to write for The Amsterdam News. Moon was fired from the paper after he encouraged the staff to join The Newspaper Guild union. He then went to work for the Federal Writers' Project until federal funding for it was ended in 1939. Moon applied to the New York Times, but was rejected. He found work in Washington, D.C. working for Robert C. Weaver on Franklin D. Roosevelt's Black Cabinet as a race relations advisor. After the war, he worked as an organizer for the PAC of the CIO trade union. In 1948, Moon began working for the NAACP as their public relations director. Moon held the position until 1974. During his tenure at the NAACP, he promoted voting rights and encouraged the organization to work harder to elect politicians friendly to their cause. While at the NAACP, he also wrote the book Balance of Power and edited a collection of W. E. B. Du Bois' writings. Death and legacy Moon died on June 7, 1985 at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Chicago, Illinois. In 1988, the library at the NAACP's headquarters in Baltimore was renamed in his memory. Personal life Moon married Mollie Lewis on August 13, 1938. The couple became well-known for throwing integrated society parties that allowed black and white New Yorkers to meet and connect with each other. Their reputation was satirized in Chester Himes' 1961 novel Pinktoes.

Mexico City-Querétaro The highway between Mexico City and Querétaro is one of the oldest components of the Mexican toll road network, being the third toll highway to open in the country. It was built by Caminos Federales de Ingresos, S.A. de C.V., a state-owned predecessor to Caminos y Puentes Federales (CAPUFE), and reduced travel times between Mexico City and cities in central and northern Mexico. The road also crosses through a portion of the state of Hidalgo, including the city of Tepeji del Río. Not all of the road to Querétaro is tolled, but traffic is tolled on the between Mexico City and Palmillas, for a toll of 148 pesos (for cars) over two toll booths. Bypasses of San Luis Potosí =Libramiento Oriente= The two bypasses of San Luis Potosí City are identified as Fed. 57D. The Libramiento Oriente de San Luis Potosí, serving the north-south cargo traffic and also allowing traffic to access Fed. 70 to Tampico, opened on August 23, 1991. It is operated by META (Mexicana de Técnicos en Autopistas) and carries a toll of 59 pesos for cars.Tarifas: Libramiento SLP =Libramiento Norponiente/Poniente= When the Libramiento Norponiente de San Luis Potosí opened in 2014, it initially was in length and ran from the Libramiento Oriente to Fed. 49 to Zacatecas. An extension, the Western Bypass, to Fed. 80 was formally inaugurated by President Enrique Peña Nieto on February 27, 2017. The segment from Fed. 57D to Fed. 45 carries a toll of 56 pesos for cars, while the segment to Fed. 80 carries a toll of 49 pesos for cars. Both segments are maintained by META.

Criticism around the highway has abounded, particularly over its poor condition. Northbound travelers do not benefit from the highway's insurance policy, as they do not have toll tickets obtained at the toll booth at the northern terminus.

The incident was the largest single death toll inflicted by a coalition air strike since the 2003 invasion of Iraq by U.S. forces.  Background  Beginning on 16 October 2016, American-led forces began taking back control of the city of Mosul after it fell under occupation of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in 2014. On 24 January 2017, the Eastern half of the city had been liberated from ISIL control, and the coalition forces began advancing into western Mosul soon after. In February, the Trump administration stated that the U.S. would sharply escalate the offensive in Mosul. The Pentagon reported that around 1,400 separate munitions were unleashed over the last two weeks of March. The Iraqi Observatory for Human Rights corroborated an increase in the rate of drone strikes and also documented eyewitness accounts of 3,846 civilian deaths and the destruction of 10,000 homes since the offensive into western Mosul began. Bassma Bassim, the head of the Mosul District Council, stated that air raids from 10 March to 17 March alone had killed \\"more than 500\\" civilians.  Attack  On 18 March, the U.S. Department of Defense stated that the American-led coalition had conducted \\"eight strikes consisting of 73 engagements in Iraq, coordinated with and in support of Iraq’s government\\" and four of these strikes targeted ISIL in Mosul. They noted the strikes \\"engaged three ISIS tactical units; destroyed 56 ISIS vehicles, 25 fighting positions, five rocket-propelled grenade systems, two medium machine guns, two mortar systems, and an ISIS car bomb; and suppressed 20 ISIS mortar teams and four ISIS tactical units.\\" The following day, they noted five more strikes in Mosul which \\"engaged four ISIS tactical units; destroyed 14 fighting positions, four vehicles, two rocket- propelled grenade systems, a medium machine gun, and an artillery system; damaged 14 supply routes; and suppressed five mortar teams and three ISIS tactical units.\\" Some residents of the al-Jadida neighborhood say the airstrike hit an explosive-filled truck, detonating a blast that collapsed buildings packed with families.  Investigation  The United States Central Command confirmed that the American-led coalition conducted an airstrike targeting ISIL fighters and equipment on 17 March in the al-Jadidah neighborhood, where the civilian casualties were reported; however, they could not confirm which member of the coalition conducted the airstrike. The Iraqi military blamed ISIL for the attack despite reports suggesting that its artillery may also have hit the neighborhood, saying that 61 bodies had been recovered at the site of a booby-trapped house which it described as “completely destroyed.” The statement added that “there is no hole or indication that was subjected to an air strike.” That account strongly contradicted much field reporting and the accounts of other officials. A provincial health official, for instance, told Reuters that wide swaths of the neighborhood were destroyed in fighting, “civil defense has extracted and buried 160 bodies up to this moment.” The Iraqi Civil Defense Department reported at least 137 bodies were recovered, but by 27 March, that number had risen to 531. On 25 May 2017, the Pentagon concluded that at least 105 civilians died in the airstrike when a US aircraft delivered a single precision-guided bomb (GBU-38 JDAM) with the intention of targeting two ISIL snipers on the second storey of a structure in al-Jadida neighborhood. But the bomb also caused a large cache of ISIL explosives to detonate, leading to the catastrophic collapse of the building that had civilians sheltering downstairs, officials said.  Aftermath  The Iraqi Army temporarily stopped its advance into western Mosul following the airstrike.  Reactions  = Supranational and non-governmental organizations = * Amnesty International – Amnesty International stated that recent increase in civilian casualties from U.S.-led coalition airstrikes \\"raised serious questions about the lawfulness of these attacks.\\" * United Nations – The UN expressed profound concern over the escalating civilian death toll in the battle to retake Mosul. * Human Rights Watch – Human Rights Watch stated that \\"The high number of civilian deaths in recent fighting, as well as recent announcements about changed procedures for vetting airstrikes, raise concerns about the way the battle for west Mosul is being fought.\\"\\"Iraq: Airstrike Vetting Changes Raise Concerns\\".

He is the leader and primary songwriter of the masked rock band Ghost, performing live as their vocalist under the stage names Papa Emeritus and Cardinal Copia. Although the band formed in 2006, Forge's identity as the Ghost frontman was only confirmed in 2017, following a lawsuit by former band members due to a royalty dispute. Prior to finding success, he was in several other bands including Repugnant and Crashdïet under the stage name Mary Goore. For his musical accomplishments, Forge was awarded the 2019 Platinagitarren award from STIM, who explained \\"With one foot standing firmly on the metal floor, Forge is a composer pushing the boundaries of the genre.\\" Jury member and journalist Jan Gradvall stated that Forge is among the \\"most visionary and creative in Swedish music history.\\" Due to \\"Ghost's epic progression from underground doom favorites to an arena phenomenon\\" in the 2010s, Loudwire named Forge the Metal Artist of the Decade.  Repugnant and Crashdïet  Forge was a member of the band Superior under the stage name Leviathan in 1996. He fronted the Stockholm-based death metal band Repugnant from 1998, under the stage name Mary Goore. They recorded their only studio album Epitome of Darkness in 2002, but it was left unreleased when the band broke up in 2004, only being published in 2006. Between 2000 and 2002, Forge was also a guitarist for glam metal band Crashdïet using the Mary Goore name. At some point he also played guitar for the punk rock band Onkel Kånkel. Repugnant reunited for the Hell's Pleasure festival in 2010.  Subvision and Magna Carta Cartel  From 2002 to 2008, Forge was vocalist and guitarist of the pop rock band Subvision. The group also included future Ghost members Martin Persner and Gustaf Lindström on guitar and bass respectively. They released two EPs and one album, So Far So Noir (2006), before disbanding. Forge, Persner and Simon Söderberg, another future Ghost member, were also members of the Linköping-based alternative rock band Magna Carta Cartel (or MCC) from 2006 to 2010. Forge played guitar and bass, with Persner and Söderberg both handling guitar and singing duties. The band went on hiatus when all three began to focus on Ghost. Persner left Ghost in July 2016 and reformed Magna Carta Cartel.  Ghost  Forge performing as the original Papa Emeritus, 2012 Forge has been the chief songwriter and business leader of the rock and heavy metal band Ghost since 2006, a project and role that contributed to a significant rise in his fame and popularity, following many years of involvement in other underground acts. During live performances with the band, he performs as its singer, originally under the stage name Papa Emeritus, a demonic anti-pope, and now Cardinal Copia. Peter Hällje, a former bandmate of Martin Persner, claimed he designed the Papa Emeritus character in 2005, prior to the formation of Ghost. Hällje never performed as Papa Emeritus and agreed with Persner to let him use the character for his then-new band. For recorded material, Forge seems to also play most of the other instruments in addition to vocals. For example, he said their 2010 debut album Opus Eponymous was recorded with a session drummer and nothing else. During a concert in the band's hometown of Linköping, Sweden in 2012, Papa Emeritus was ostensibly retired and replaced by a supposedly new vocalist, Papa Emeritus II, which was actually Forge in another costume. The band's second album Infestissumam was released in 2013. Due to a legal dispute over the band's name, they were forced to release the album using the name \\"Ghost B.C.\\" in the United States. Forge performed as Papa Emeritus II for this album, as well as the subsequent EP If You Have Ghost (2013). Papa Emeritus III was introduced in 2015 to coincide with the release of the band's third album Meliora. Papa Emeritus III was retired at the end of Ghost's 2016–2017 Popestar Tour (being physically dragged off stage at the end of the final show), and a new character, Papa Emeritus Zero (now known as Papa Nihil), was introduced immediately afterward. For the band's fourth album, Prequelle (2018), Forge adopted another new persona, Cardinal Copia. During the final show of the tour in support of the band's fourth album, Cardinal Copia was anointed and introduced as Papa Emeritus IV. Forge performing as Papa Emeritus III in 2016 Despite anonymity being one of Ghost's biggest themes, Forge's identity as Papa Emeritus was revealed following a lawsuit in April 2017 by former Ghost members over a royalties dispute. They also claimed he was trying to transform Ghost \\"from a band into a solo project with hired musicians\\" in an \\"underhanded and shameless way\\". Forge has disputed this, claiming that Ghost \\"was always sort of… I guess a Bathory sort of band, where there was people playing live, and the people playing live [were] not necessarily the same that played on the records.\\" Forge claimed that \\"no legal partnership\\" ever existed between the other members and himself; they were paid a fixed salary to perform and execute the band's image as he instructed as \\"musicians for hire.\\"  Other work  Forge, as Papa Emeritus III, appears as a guest on Candlemass' May 2018 vinyl-exclusive version of \\"House of Doom\\". As Cardinal Copia he joined members of Candlemass and Vargas and Lagola for a live performance of \\"Enter Sandman\\" in front of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden and Queen Silvia of Sweden during the 14 June 2018 ceremony honoring Metallica with the Polar Music Prize. Cardinal Copia also makes a featured appearance on the song \\"I'm Not Afraid\\" from Emigrate's November 2018 album A Million Degrees.  Personal life  Forge is married to wife Boel Forge, and is the father of twins, a boy and a girl. His daughter sings \\"Ashes\\", the opening track to Prequelle. His brother Sebastian, who was thirteen years his senior, had a large influence on Tobias and introduced him to film and music such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Kim Wilde, Rainbow, Kiss, and Mötley Crüe at a very young age. Sebastian died from a heart disease on 12 March 2010, the same day that Ghost released their first demo songs online. Sebastian was also a published author. Forge stated that as an adolescent he \\"unquestionably [threw] my hands into the hands of Satan.\\" He cited a strict stepmother, the alienation he felt at her home, and an even stricter religious schoolteacher for making him run \\"headfirst into the arms of the devil.\\"  Discography  Superior *Metamorphis (Demo, 1996) *Illustrare Ad Infernali (Demo, 1997) Repugnant *Spawn of Pure Malevolence (Demo, 1999) *Hecatomb (EP, 1999) *Draped in Cerecloth (Demo, 2001) *Dunkel Besatthet (Split, 2002) *Premature Burial (EP, 2004) *Kaamos / Repugnant (Split, 2004) *Epitome of Darkness (2006) Crashdïet *Demo 1 (Demo, 2000) *Demo 2 (Demo, 2000) *Demo 3 (Demo, 2001) Subvision * Brilliant Music for Stupid People (EP, 2003) * Pearls for Pigsnawps (EP, 2003) * The Killing Floor E.P.

Gegodog is located in the northeastern coast of Java, east of Tuban. Prior to the battle, Trunajaya invaded eastern Java and occupied Surabaya and other towns. King Amangkurat I sent an army to face him, led by the crown prince. The crown prince expected a sham battle from Trunajaya, his former protégé. However, Trunajaya offered a real fight which resulted in a decisive victory over the much larger royal army. The royal army was routed, and the king's elderly uncle Pangeran Purbaya was killed after leading a futile charge. The rebel victory was followed by further successes - including more conquests and the defections of Mataram subjects into Trunajaya's side.  Background  Prior to the rebellion, the Madurese nobleman Trunajaya lived in exile in Mataram and had a close relation with the crown prince of Mataram (then known as Pangeran Adipati Anom, future Amangkurat II). Trunajaya's father-in-law and a prominent nobleman Raden Kajoran had introduced him to the crown prince in 1670. Both had a grudge against King Amangkurat I, the crown prince over the execution of Pangeran Pekik, the prince's maternal grandfather, and Trunajaya over his exile and the execution of his father. The two forged a friendship, partly due to this mutual dislike. In 1670 or 1671, Trunajaya left Mataram for his homeland Madura and became its ruler. He used the crown prince's patronage (as well as his own family's name) to gain followers which allowed him to wrest control of the island. The Trunajaya rebellion began in 1674 as Trunajaya's forces conducted raids against the cities under Mataram control. In 1676, a rebel army of 9,000 invaded East Java from their base in Madura, and took Surabaya – the principal city of East Java – shortly after. The army consisted of East Javanese, Madurese and Makassarese and was led by Trunajaya and his Makassarese ally Karaeng Galesong.  Battle  In 1676, the King decided to send a large army to suppress the rebellion. The army was much larger than Trunajaya's, but was predominantly made up of conscripted peasants. It also included West Javanese auxiliaries. The king put the crown prince in charge of this army; he was either unaware of the crown prince's role in the rebellion or planned to have him murdered during the campaign. Other princes also joined the army, including the King's uncle Pangeran Purbaya, Sultan Agung's only remaining brother who was almost 80 years old, as well another son of the king Pangeran Singasari who was the crown prince's archenemy. The Mataram army marched to Jepara, and then eastwards towards territories controlled by the rebels. It met the rebel army in Gegodog, east of Tuban on the north coast of eastern Java. The Crown Prince initially expected that he and his protégé Trunajaya would only fight a sham battle and then both forces would join against the King. However, Trunajaya betrayed his former friend and patron, and the presence of other princes might have prevented the crown prince from faking the battle. After a long wavering, the prince ordered an attack on 13 October. Trunajaya offered a real battle, which went badly for the royal army. In a desperate effort, the aged Pangeran Purbaya rallied the troops and led a final charge. According to Thomas Stamford Raffles, he \\"performed extraordinary feats of valour\\", had his horse shot under him and continued to fight on foot, before he was overpowered and slain. The charge failed, and the battle ended in a decisive victory for the rebels. Mataram troops disintegrated and retreated, along with the Crown Prince and other princes, towards the capital.  Aftermath  After the rebel victory, Javanese defection into Trunajaya's side accelerated, and Trunajaya followed up his victory by further conquests of Mataram's territories. His forces advanced westward along the northern coast, and by January 1677 nearly all of Mataram's northern coast, with the notable exception of Jepara, fell into his hands. Towns as far west as Cirebon submitted to Trunajaya. Jepara did not fall due to the united efforts of the king's military governor there and VOC forces who arrived there from Batavia. The inland advance was slower, but rebel forces under Raden Kajoran would ultimately overrun and sack the capital in June 1677. For Mataram, the defeat was disastrous. After the battle, Mataram could only wage a defensive campaign. Its territories, expanded by Sultan Agung decades before, would fall into rebel hands, laid in ruin and their fortifications dismantled, culminating in the fall of the capital. The rebellion would continue for several more years, and Mataram would be forced to request assistance from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) - in exchange for geopolitical and financial compensations - to turn the tide of the war. The crown prince was blamed for the defeat and was accused of colluding with the enemy. After Gedogog, he was replaced by his brothers, Pangeran Martasana and Pangeran Puger, in leading the Mataram forces. After the fall of the capital he fled with his father, and upon his father's death during the retreat, he took the throne as Amangkurat II.

The creek's source area is located within the east-side neighborhoods of Hazleton, Pennsylvania. The entire city is low lying relative to the surrounding mountainous Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians and historically was known as the \\"Great Swamp\\" and other names with either wilderness or swamp being appended—the whole area extending over to the Lehigh Gap was heavily forested with low-lying areas generally being swampy pinewood forests. Hazle Creek's source springs originate in the terrain along the upper edge of the Lehigh River drainage basin, TBDL ft above its mouth, and TBDL above mean sea level. Hazle Creek flows from its headwaters near Hazleton to its mouth near Weatherly. Due to underground mining, most of the surface drainage in the Hazleton Basin has been destroyed. Surface water infiltrates into the underlying minepool through abandoned strip mines. Initially part of the terrain traversed by the Amerindian trail known to white settlers as the \\"Warriors' Path\\", the creek's water gap hosted an early crude wagon road, the Lausanne-Nescopeck Road, which connected the Moravians in Bethlehem and the lower Luzerne County settlements of \\"Saint Anthony's Wilderness\\", the earliest being those along the Nescopeck Creek in a village known as St. Johns in the late 1700s.

Background Prior to Russian forces taking an active combat role in the Syrian Civil War, Syrian government forces had previously attacked medical facilities in areas not under their control. Attacks began in early 2012. These attacks included an August 2012 attack, and a November 2012 attack both on the Dar al-Shifa Hospital in Aleppo. United Nations investigators called the attacks systematic. In an effort to refer the Syrian government to the International Criminal Court, the People's Republic of China and Russia blocked an attempted referral in 2014. Physicians for Human Rights estimates that medical facilities were attacked over 300 times between March 2011 and August 2015, with 90% being conducted by Syrian government forces. Medical facilities attacked by Russian or Syrian forces in Syria =2015 - 2017= After Russia began military operations in Syria, aerial bombardment intensified. In 2015, there were more than 300 attacks on medical facilities by Syrian and Russian forces. From May to December 2016, medical facilities were attacked about 200 times by Russian and Syrian forces. Hospitals in Aleppo were attacked multiple times. Before March 2016, more than six hospitals were attacked in the Aleppo Governorate. In April 2016, over two dozen were killed when a Russian airstrike hit a hospital; the hospital served as the area's primary pediatric care facility. In July 2016, M2 Hospital was attacked by aircraft. By the end of the month, six hospitals in Aleppo had been destroyed. In October 2016, M10 Hospital was attacked by airstrikes. Hospital attacks were not limited to Aleppo. In October 2015, a Russian aircraft attacked a medical facility operated by the Syrian American Medical Society in the town of Sarmin. In February 2016, a children's hospital was hit in Azaz; Russians claimed they targeted ISIL infrastructure. That same month two hospitals in Maarrat al-Nu'man were attacked by Syrian forces, one being a Doctors Without Borders supported facility; Syria claimed that one of the attacks was done by American forces. In July 2016, a hospital was attacked by Russian forces in Atarib. In August 2016, a medical facility was attacked once every 17 hours. One of these attacks was an attack on the last functioning hospital in Darayya; the attack was done with barrel bombs filled with napalm. In April 2017, a hospital was attacked in Maarat al- Nu'man.

Non- Russian and non-Syrian claims were that the chemical attack was carried out by Syrian forces. The Syrian government denied making a chemical attack. Russia denied that chemical weapons were used in Douma; later it claimed that the attack was staged by the United Kingdom. As a result of the attack on Douma, Israeli aircraft attacked an air base in Syria on 9 April; French, British, and American forces attacked targets in Syria on 14 April. The UN humanitarian office said that, between late April and June 2019, a total of 24 health facilities and 35 schools were hit by the Syrian government and Russian air raids and rocket fire on the Idlib region. The coordinates of nine of those health facilities were shared with the UN, which passed them to Russia in an effort to protect them from being bombed and encourage some form of accountability for attacks. Instead, they also came under fire. On 15 May 2019, Syrian government forces bombed the Tarmala Maternity and Children's Hospital in South Idlib, completely destroying the facility, which had served about 6,000 people a month.

The book was published in January 2012 by Random House. It tells the story of a father dealing with the accusation that his 14-year-old son is a murderer. Plot Andy Barber is an assistant district attorney in Newton, Massachusetts. He is investigating the murder of a 14-year-old boy, Ben Rifkin, who was a classmate of his son Jacob and was found stabbed to death in a park near their school. Andy initially suspects Leonard Patz, a known local paedophile, but soon, he discovers that Ben’s friend hints at the animosity between Ben and Jacob. Andy searches Jacob’s room and discovers a knife that fits the description of the murder weapon. Unsettled by finding a knife in his son's room, Andy disposes of the knife on the notion of this being what \\"any parent would do.\\" The next day, he is suddenly pulled off the case when a fingerprint is found inside Ben’s sweatshirt that matches that of Jacob. The finding shocks Andy and his wife, Laurie, but does not shake their belief in his innocence. Jacob claims that he found Ben dead in the park and tried to revive him. While Jacob spends the night in jail, Andy reveals to Laurie that his father, Billy Barber, was a convicted murderer and rapist who was serving his life sentence at a Connecticut state prison. At the request of Jacob’s lawyer, Andy reluctantly meets with Billy. He seems to be indifferent to Jacob’s situation. At the trial, incriminating evidence comes out, like a story Jacob posted online which read like a narrative of Ben’s murder. Just when things look bad for Jacob, Leonard Patz is found hanging in his house. He leaves behind a suicide note taking responsibility for Ben’s murder and Jacob is cleared of all charges. The Barber family is relieved, but Andy feels suspicious about Patz’s death. He visits his father again and learns that he had hired a hitman to kill Patz and leave behind the note. Billy expresses regret over his life in prison and realized he did not want the same for Jacob. Andy is angered by this since he believes Jacob is innocent and would have been cleared anyway. Wanting to put the whole ordeal behind them, the Barber family decide to go on a vacation to Jamaica. There, Jacob meets a girl named Hope Connors and the two become close. One day while Jacob is relaxing at the resort, his parents notice a red stain on his bathing suit. The next day, Hope is reported missing. Her body is found several weeks later, washed up ashore with evidence pointing to her windpipe being crushed. Laurie becomes convinced of Jacob’s guilt and in turn, feels guilty herself. On their driving to an interview at a private school, Laurie crashes the car she is driving with Jacob in it, resulting in Jacob's death, while sustaining critical injuries herself. Andy is questioned in connection with Jacob’s death but refuses to cooperate or incriminate Laurie in any way. Afterwards, Andy tries to imagine the final moments of Jacob’s life and what he would have become if had he lived. Writing Landay viewed Defending Jacob as a deviation from his usual style of writing, explaining: \\"My first two books were easy to categorize as “crime novels.” I have no problem with that label, but the fact is a lot of mainstream readers simply won’t even consider them. You could call Defending Jacob a crime novel, too, but you could just as easily call it a family drama\\". In an interview with The Huffington Post, Landay said that while he tried to avoid using real-life cases for his books, \\"there were many cases that inspired various aspects of [Defending Jacob], most of them of only local interest in the Boston area, where I live\\". In a separate interview, he revealed that \\"the first manuscript of Defending Jacob that I submitted actually had a different ending. What followed was a very long discussion about how the story could end in a way that was both big enough to be dramatically satisfying yet small enough to be credible for the ordinary people who populate the book\\". Reception Defending Jacob received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the book's subject matter and handling of court scenes. Patrick Andersen of Washington Post called it an \\"exceptionally serious, suspenseful, engrossing story\\", with an ending that was \\"all too real, all too painful, all too haunting\\". Hallie Ephron of The Boston Globe also positively reviewed the book's \\"riveting courtroom procedure\\" and its parallel narratives that \\"interlock like the teeth of a zipper, building to a tough and unflinching finale\\". Entertainment Weekly's Thom Geier gave it a B+, stating: \\"[Landay's] prose can be workmanlike and his dialogue pedestrian (Jacob and his peers sound like no teens you’ve ever met). But with a grabby premise and careful plotting, he keeps you turning the pages through the shocking gut-punch of an ending\\". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, Julia Keller gave the book a mixed review, panning the \\"inexplicable bursts of clunky, cliche-ridden prose and huge dumps of exposition\\" and opined that the ending was \\"signaled so flamboyantly and built up to at such tedious length that that readers will be well within their rights to skim\\". In his piece for Kirkus Reviews, J. Kingston Pierce disagreed, writing: \\"Many readers, preferring neatly tied-up plots, will be frustrated by the way Landay drops red herrings and possibly significant clues, but then leaves a surfeit of questions outstanding at the end of the book. However, the raggedness of this story’s final section, especially, is one of its signal strengths\\". Television adaptation The novel has been developed into an eight-episode web television miniseries, produced by Apple TV+, starring Chris Evans, Michelle Dockery and Jaeden Martell as the title character. The series premiered on April 24, 2020, and concluded on May 29, 2020.

The applied models are served as a part of the application system in which it can be changed at runtime. The target things are what the application deals with, such as the objects and affairs in business for a business application. Follows the definition of application in TOGAF, a model-driven business application could be described as an IT system that supports business functions and services running on the models of the (things in) business. History The ideal of the architecture for a model- driven application was first put forward by Tong-Ying Yu on the Enterprise Engineering Forum in 1999, which have been studied and spread through some internet media for a long time. It had influence on the field of enterprise application development in China; there were successful cases of commercial development of enterprise/business applications in the architectural style of a model-driven application.ChinaLabs \\"Business system infrastruc-ture platform (Technical report).\\" Beijing, China: 2002. Gartner Group carried out some studies into the subject in 2008; they defined the model-driven packaged applications as \\"enterprise applications that have explicit metadata-driven models of the supported processes, data and relationships, and that generate runtime components through metadata models, either dynamically interpreted or compiled, rather than hardcoded.\\" The model-driven application architecture is one of few technology trends to driven the next generation of application modernization, that claimed by some industrial researchers in 2012.Winslow, P., Panigrahi, S. & Morrison, D. “The Apps Revolution Manifesto —Volume 1: The Technologies.” Credit Suisse. March 29, 2012. Instance Business process management (BPM) is the significant practice to the model-driven application. According to the definition, a BPM system is model-driven if the functions are operated based on the business process models which are built and changed at the operational time but not the design or implementation time; the biggest advantage is that it can deal with the continuous changing of business process directly without modifying the code of the software. Notes Note that it should be distinguished from the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA); the latter is a software design approach for the development of software systems and generally does not specify a specific system style or the runtime configuration.

The project was initiated in 2008 by Aurora Flight Sciences, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Pratt & Whitney under NASA's sponsorship of $2.9 million (£2.19 million). Aurora is refining the fuel-efficient D8 designed for NASA by MIT, hoping to fly a half- scale demonstrator in 2021. The 180-seat, -range airliner is designed to fly at within the capabilities of the Boeing 737 or Airbus A320 and could be in test service by 2027 at the earliest and 2035 at the latest. Aurora Flight Sciences was purchased by Boeing on November 8, 2017 for their drone developments. The subsidiary is intended to accelerate Boeing's development of autonomous technology. Design The side-by-side \\"double bubble\\" fuselage provides additional lift along the nose section as well as faster turnaround owing to its wider fuselage. As a result, smaller wings can be used to generate lift which reduces drag. The mounting of the engines at the rear end of the D8 instead of below the wings used in conventional aircraft design allows reduction of thrust requirements by minimizing inefficiency from Boundary Layer Ingestion (BLI). This results in the ability to use smaller and lighter high bypass ratio engines. However, the chassis features less radical than competing blended wing body concepts without modifying existing airport infrastructure, and BLI. The original goal was to reduce fuel burn by 70% and noise by 71 dB by flying at Mach 0.74, but a more traditional Mach 0.82 wing and fuselage growth resulted in a more-conservative 49% fuel burn reduction and 40 EPNdB noise reduction against a Boeing 737-800. =Engines= Clustering the engines together atop the wide tail of a flattened fuselage enables them to reenergize the slow-moving boundary layer over the fuselage to increase efficiency, and allow a clean, low drag, high aspect ratio wing. Starting with slower flow, the reduction in exhaust velocity increases the propulsive efficiency with a similar specific thrust. By ingesting and reenergizing the boundary layer flow, BLI reduces by 40% in the D8 the wasted kinetic energy in the combined high-velocity jet exhaust and slow-speed wake behind the fuselage. Large-scale wind-tunnel testing with NASA showed a power- saving from BLI from 8.4% with the same jet nozzle area to 10.4% with the same mass flow. The BLI benefit is an order of magnitude more than the loss from ingesting distorted boundary-layer flow. A large fan size is needed to exceed a 20:1 bypass ratio. Developed by United Technologies Research Center, a distortion-tolerant fan was scale tested at NASA and coped with flow distortion from ingesting the boundary layer close to the upper fuselage surface. As a compact core limits blade tip clearances issues due to bending but cannot house the fan to low-pressure turbine driveshaft, Pratt & Whitney turned the core backwards, similar to PT6 arrangement, with hot gas discharged forward through a low-pressure power turbine connected to the fan via a short shaft and a gearbox. To avoid the risk of an uncontained engine failure causing the second engine to fail, the cores are angled by 50° since they are no longer mechanically linked to the fan, with low pressure losses since only the core flow is turned. Not connected to the power section, the core can be disassembled for maintenance.
