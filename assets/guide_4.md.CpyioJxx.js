The film is a melding of dark modern drama with idealised Chinese and Japanese cultural themes and settings, and centres on body painting. Plot The film's title, \\"The Pillow Book\\", refers to an ancient Japanese diary written by Sei Sh≈çnagon, actual name believed to be Kiyohara Nagiko, from whence the protagonist's name in the film. The film is narrated by Nagiko, a Japanese born model living in Hong Kong. Nagiko seeks a lover who can match her desire for carnal pleasure with her admiration for poetry and calligraphy. The roots of this obsession lie in her youth in Kyoto, when her father would write characters of good fortune on her face. Nagiko's father celebrates her birthday retelling the Japanese creation myth and writing on her flesh in beautiful calligraphy, while her aunt reads a list of \\"beautiful things\\" from Sei Sh≈çnagon's Pillow Book. Nagiko's aunt tells her that when she is twenty- eight years old, the official book of observations will be officially 1000 years old, and that she, Nagiko, will be the same age as Sei Sh≈çnagon when she had written the book (in addition to sharing her first name). Nagiko also learns around this time that her father is in thrall to his publisher, \\"Yaji- san\\", who demands sexual favours from her father in exchange for publishing his work. =Early chapters= The publisher arranges Nagiko's wedding to his young apprentice. Her husband, an expert archer, resents Nagiko's love for books and her desire to read, in spite of his apprenticeship. He also refuses to indulge in her desires for pleasure, refusing to write on her body. When he discovers and reads Nagiko's pillow book, he is extremely resentful, setting it on fire and thus setting fire to their marital home, an event which Nagiko describes to be the 'first major fire of [her] life.' Insulted and enraged, Nagiko leaves him for good. Hiding from her husband, Nagiko moves to Hong Kong. In spite of her aversion to the practice, she learns how to type to find work. Outside her apartment, a group of activists regularly protest the publishing industry for the depletion of forests due to the need to make paper. After working as a secretary in the office of a Japanese fashion designer for a while, Nagiko's employer takes a liking to her and makes her one of his models. As a successful fashion model, Nagiko hires a maid, as she now finally has the opportunity to explore her sexual desires of being written on. However, after several affairs, she feels dissatisfied with them all: either they have great penmanship and are lousy lovers, or vice versa. One day, at the Cafe Typo, Nagiko's favourite haunt, she meets Jerome, a British translator. Intrigued by his knowledge, they go to a private space where she has Jerome write on her body in various languages. In spite of her interest, Nagiko dislikes Jerome's handwriting and orders him out. Jerome totally shocks Nagiko, however, when he asks her to teach him, offering her to write on his body. Opening his shirt, he offers Nagiko to \\"Use my body like the pages of a book. Of your book!\\". Nagiko has never considered this aspect in her desires before: her lovers always write on her body. When she backs out and runs, Jerome laughs at her. Frightened but very intrigued by Jerome's suggestion, Nagiko has several one-night stands in which she experiments writing on their bodies. One of the activists, admirer Hoki, a Japanese photographer who adores her, begs Nagiko to take him as a lover. She explains she can't, as his skin's no good for writing: whenever she writes on him, the ink smears and runs. Hoki, not wanting Nagiko to keep carrying on like she is, suggests she try writing a book, offering to take it to a renowned publisher he freelances for. Nagiko likes this idea and writes her first book. Nagiko's book is returned, being told the book is \\"not worth the paper it's written on!\\". Insulted, Nagiko follows the address on the envelope to confront the publisher. Nagiko is shocked to discover that the publisher who rejected her work is in fact Yaji-san, her father's old publisher. What's more, the publisher has a young lover: Jerome. Devising a plan, Nagiko decides that she will get to the publisher through Jerome. Meeting up with Jerome again, Nagiko discovers he has learned a few more languages, and his penmanship has greatly improved. Nagiko and Jerome spend several weeks exploring this, writing on each other and making love. Nagiko soon realises that, in Jerome, she has found the perfect lover she has been searching for: the partner with whom she can share her physical and her poetic passion, using each other's bodies as tablets for their art. =Writing of books 1 ‚Äì 6= Nagiko tells Jerome the truth and the whole story with the publisher. Jerome comes up with an idea: Nagiko will write her book on Jerome's body and Jerome will take it to the publisher. Nagiko loves the idea, and writes Book 1: The Book of The Agenda, in intricate characters of black, red, and gold, on Jerome, keeping her identity anonymous. The plan is a success: Jerome sees the publisher and exhibits the book on his nude body, and the impressed publisher has his scriveners copy down the text. After telling Nagiko of the plan's success, Jerome tells Nagiko that he'll return to her as soon as the publisher, who was extremely aroused by the experience, lets him go. However, during his time with the publisher, Jerome appears to lose track of time and doesn't return to Nagiko. Nagiko, jealous, impatient, and angry, searches for Jerome, eventually finding him making love with the publisher. Nagiko takes this as rejection and betrayal of the worst kind, and immediately plots revenge. On two Swedish tourists, Nagiko writes Book 2: The Book of The Innocent and Book 3: The Book of the Idiot. Shortly afterwards, an old man is running naked through the streets from the publisher's shop, bearing Book 4: The Book of Impotence/Old Age. Book 5: The Book of the Exhibitionist is delivered by a boorish, fat, hyperactive American (Tom Kane; who was actually more interested in Hoki than Nagiko). Nagiko's revenge is a success. Jerome is furiously jealous, and comes to Nagiko's home to confront her. Nagiko refuses to meet him, however, and won't let Jerome in. Jerome's outrage soon turns to desperation as he begs her to talk to him, but she won't. Jerome sinks into deep depression and meets with Hoki at the Cafe Typo, desperate to find a way to get Nagiko to forgive him. Hoki suggests that he \\"scare\\" Nagiko by faking suicide, similar to the fake death scene in Romeo and Juliet and gives Jerome some pills. Arriving at Nagiko's home while she is away, Jerome takes some of the pills, then writes a page, as if writing a book. Each time he takes some pills, he writes another page, keeping track of how many pills he takes on each page. As the pills take effect, Jerome can write no more and lies on the bed, naked, holding a copy of Sei Sh≈çnagon's the book of observations. The plan is a success: when Nagiko returns home and finds Jerome, she rushes to him, eager to renew their relationship and continue their plans. However, the plan has worked too well: Jerome has overdosed on the pills and is dead. Nagiko is devastated, and realises how much she loved him. On his dead body, Nagiko writes Book 6: The Book of the Lovers. At Jerome's funeral, his mother, a snobbish, upper-class woman, tells Nagiko that Jerome always loved things that were \\"fashionable\\". When she suggests that was probably why Jerome loved Nagiko, Nagiko strikes her. Nagiko burns her possessions and moves back to Japan. After the funeral, the publisher secretly exhumes Jerome's body from the tomb and has Jerome's skin, still bearing the writing, flayed and made into a grotesque pillow book of his own. Nagiko learns of the publisher's actions and becomes distraught and outraged. She sends a letter to the publisher, still keeping her identity a secret, demanding that particular book from the publisher's hands in exchange for the remaining books. The publisher, now obsessed with his mysterious writer and her work, agrees. =Writing of books 7 ‚Äì 13= Nagiko, now pregnant with Jerome's child, writes Book 7: The Book of The Seducer on a male messenger. The writing on him is almost destroyed and undecipherable when the publisher accidentally leaves the messenger out in the rain. Book 8: The Book of Youth is delivered as a series of photographs. A young Buddhist monk then arrives bearing Book 9: The Book of Secrets written on all his \\"secret\\" spots: in between his fingers and toes, the insides of his thighs, etc.; the book is presented in the form of riddles. When the next messenger arrives, he is completely bare: no writing at all. The publisher and staff search for any hint of writing on the messenger's naked body. As the publisher dismisses him as a hoax, the man sticks out his tongue, bearing Book 10: The Book of Silence. The activists' protests come to an end when their truck hits a young wrestler bearing Book 11: The Book of The Betrayed, right outside the publisher's office. The next messenger (Masaru Matsuda) simply drives by the office, giving little time to copy down Book 12: The Book of False Starts. Finally, Book 13: The Book of the Dead arrives on the body of a Sumo wrestler. In the book writing on the body of the messenger, which the publisher carefully reads, Nagiko finally reveals her identity, confronting the publisher with his crimes: blackmailing and disgracing her father, \\"corrupting\\" her husband, as well as Jerome, and what he's done to Jerome's corpse. The publisher, greatly shamed and humbled by being confronted with his guilt, hands the pillow book made of Jerome's skin to the messenger, then has the messenger slit his throat. Upon recovering the book made out of Jerome's skin, Nagiko buries it under a Bonsai tree and life goes on. She has given birth to Jerome's child, and is shown in the epilogue writing on her child's face, like her father used to do when she was young, and quoting from her own pillow book. It is now Nagiko's 28th birthday. Nagiko's bi-cultural heritage plays a key role in this film. As a half-Chinese and half-Japanese woman, Nagiko navigates her dual cultures through physical and psychological exploration. Greenaway portrays this exploration subtly by mixing and switching Asian iconography.

The novel is a report of Ijon Tichy's travel to a faraway planet Entia (in Polish text: Encja) to study their civilization. This report was supposed to fix a misunderstanding arisen from Tichy's Fourteenth Voyage to supposedly Entia (then known as Enteropia), which turned out to be a satellite of Entia, masqueraded by Entians to misguide explorers. The travel was also to verify the results of the \\"Institute of Historiographical Computers\\" (Polish: Instytut Maszyn Dziejowych), which use predictive modeling to overcome the speed of light limitation and get information about the state of the affairs on remote planets based on information obtained from previous expeditions. Major themes of the book are: the problems of the society of abundance based entirely on automated production where individuals have little to do; imposition of ethical laws through technology i.e. the \\"ethicsphere\\" which has made it impossible to harm individuals physically; and the ideological opposition of two dominant systems, which is basically a parody of Western World-Soviet Union split taken to the absurd. The original novel was first printed by Wydawnictwo Literackie in 1982. It was translated into German by Hubert Schumann under the title Lokaltermin in 1987 (). Lacking English translation, the novel title was also translated in literary criticism works as \\"Eyewitness Account\\" and \\"The Scene of the Crime\\". Science Fiction Studies published a collection of excerpts from Lem's letters which show the chronology of the creation of the novel (during 1979-1981). In the first one Lem confesses that he tried to approach the subject several times in the past few years. \\"On the Genesis of Wizja Lokalna\\" in: Science Fiction Studies #40 = Volume 13, Part 3 = November 1986, Article Abstracts Also, in his essay The Philosophy of Chance Lem confesses that he struggled with the novel for many years. Plot summary Tichy arrives on Entia to discover a unique anthropomorphic civilization divided into two major states: Kurdlandia (from \\"kurdl\\") and Luzania. These names require some explanations. Kurdl is a huge animal inhabiting the marshes of Entia. The name of the animal is Lem's invention, used in earlier tales about Tichy. (In Polish it is kurdel, however in declensions of the word the root converts into \\"kurdl-\\", hence there are no associations with the English word \\"curdle\\"). Michael Kandel translated it as \\"squamp\\" in his translation of Tichy's 14th voyage. The name \\"Luzania\\" derives from the Polish root \\"luz-\\" with the meaning of \\"loose\\", \\"not restrained\\"; the choice will become clear below. Kurdlandia's guiding ideology is \\"national mobilism\\", that is the vast majority of the population must live inside of the stomachs, various passages and internal organs of the kurdls. Kurdls walk about the marshes, guided by drivers, and their inhabitants hence are \\"able to explore the land of their wonderful country from inside of their home kurdl\\", in the words of a patriotic individual that Ijon Tichy spoke to. Inhabitants of the kurdls may get out periodically (at least for 24 hours a year). Exceptions are largely confined to high government officials who live outside the marshes, on dry ground, in normal houses. Kurdlandia has no technology to speak of and is proud of it. The other state, Luzania, constitutes a treatment of the topic of an \\"ideal state\\". Luzanian's most prominent accomplishment is the creation of \\"ethicsphere\\" (compare \\"atmosphere\\"). They have produced huge numbers of molecular sized nanobots called \\"bystry\\" (\\"quickies\\" in English) that serve to control matter in the 'quickated' areas. The primary function of the 'quickies' is the enforcement of the laws of ethics as physical laws (hence the word \\"ethicsphere\\"). Hence, it is a physical law in Luzania that it is not possible to hurt an individual physically. If you try to strike your neighbor, your hand will be stopped by the suddenly increased air viscosity, (although you will not be hurt either). If you try to drown, the water will push you out. Doing non-physical harm, such as by pestering, criticizing, and otherwise mentally tormenting people is still possible, although in such a case the 'quickies' would probably help the victim to walk away from the attackers. There is a large protest movement in Luzania of people who want to end the ethicsphere, and a major element of their activities is trying to inflict harm on anybody just to prove the possibility of doing so, but they have not succeeded yet. The 'quickies' also serve to produce material goods necessary to maintain a high standard of living. Hence, there is not much of an economic life going on, although there are limits for the amount of energy individuals may spend on satisfying their needs. Many Luzanians are involved in intellectual pursuits, such as being professors, students, and government officials, but the problem of nothing productive to do stands prominent. Apparently the 'quickies' are capable of some collective thought, at least for the purposes of self-replication and self-improvement, as well as in order to identify instances of potential harm to individuals (no small feat, no doubt). The artists of Luzania feel particularly slighted by the fact that 'quickies' can create art of all forms of much greater quality than they can; naturally, many of them are members of the protest movement. There exists ideological opposition between Kurdlandia and Luzania. Generally speaking, many of the people holed up in the kurdls on poor rations would have been more than happy to run away and live in plenty across the border. On the other hand, many Luzanians, especially university students and faculty, dislike the consumerism and ethical limitations of freedom under the 'quickies' and call variously for the imposition of the kurdl-ism or at least for a slight rollback of the technological development and the abolition of the 'quickies', depending on the degree of radicalism of the individual. Luzanians also enjoy traveling to Kurdlandia on vacation to get out of the 'quickies' areas. The main character spends most of his time in Luzania, studying the history of the world and the current Luzanian social system. We learn about it through his words.

Broken Bay is the first major bay north of Sydney Harbour. Broken Bay has its origin at the confluence of the Hawkesbury River, Pittwater, and Brisbane Water and flows openly into the Tasman Sea. The total surface area of the bay is approximately .  Geography  The entrance to Broken Bay lies between the northern Box Head and Barrenjoey Head to the south. Barrenjoey Lighthouse was constructed in 1881 to guide ships away from the prominent headland. The bay comprises three arms, being the prominent estuary of the Hawkesbury River in the west, Pittwater to the south, and Brisbane Water to the north. These three arms are flooded rivers (rias) formed at a time when the sea level was much lower than it is at the present day. The Hawkesbury River flows from the confluence of the Grose and Nepean Rivers at the base of the Blue Mountains. Pittwater extends south from Broken Bay and is the northernmost extent of the greater Sydney area. Pittwater's calm waters make it a popular sailing area. West Head, west of Barrenjoey Head, marks the divide between Pittwater and the Hawkesbury. Brisbane Water is the northern arm of Broken Bay and has the towns of Gosford and Woy Woy on its shores. Lion Island, named for its profile's resemblance to a Sphinx from some viewpoints, is located at the entrance of Broken Bay. Lion Island Nature Reserve covers the entire island, and is home to a colony of fairy penguins.  European discovery  James Cook recorded \\"broken land\\" seen north of Port Jackson just before sunset on 7 wMay 1770, and named it Broken Bay. However, there has been some controversy over whether what is now known as 'Broken Bay' was what was sighted by Cook. :Matthew Flinders, llopllThe colonists have called this place Broken Bay, but it is not what was so named by Captain Cook. Ray Parkin in his book H. M. Bark Endeavour claims that the modern 'Broken Bay' was passed unremarked at night, and that Cook was in fact referring to the area around Narrabeen Lagoon. Matthew Flinders placed Cook's 'Broken Bay' at 33¬∞ 42' South, near to the mouth of Narrabeen Lagoon.A Voyage to Terra Australia, Vol Two page 2 (22 July 1802) Whatever the case, Governor Phillip was the first to examine the present day Broken Bay in a longboat from the Sirius on 2 March 1788.The Voyage of Governor Phillip to Botany Bay with an account of the Establishment of the Colonies of Port Jackson etc etc London 1789 page 9--~~~~  Role in attack on Sydney Harbour  On 28 November 2005, documentary film-maker Damien Lay claimed that the wreckage of M-24, a Japanese midget submarine involved in the attack on Sydney Harbour in 1942 and disappeared soon afterward, was buried under sand on the seabed, just east of Lion Island. Lay claimed to have confirmed that copper wiring found at the site was consistent with that used in similar Japanese vessels. A few weeks later, New South Wales Planning Minister Frank Sartor announced that sonar scans conducted by the New South Wales Heritage Office at the location specified had found no trace of the lost submarine. M-24 was eventually found approximately 13 kilometres south of Broken Bay, 5 kilometres off Bungan Head, proving the hypothesis that M-24 chose to not draw attention to its mother submarines to the south of Sydney Harbour and instead moved north towards Broken Bay.

Brisbane Water has its origin at the confluence of the Narara and Coorumbine Creeks, to the south‚Äìeast of Gosford and travels for approximately in a southerly direction to its mouth at Broken Bay, about from the Tasman Sea, at Barrenjoey Head. A number of towns and suburbs surround the shores of Brisbane Water, including Blackwall, Booker Bay, Davistown, Empire Bay, Erina, Ettalong Beach, Gosford, Green Point, Hardys Bay, Kilcare, Kincumber, Koolewong, Phegans Bay, Point Frederick, Point Clare, Saratoga, Tascott, Wagstaffe, and Woy Woy. Contained within Brisbane Water is St Huberts Island, Rileys Island, and Pelican Island; and adjoining the estuary is Brisbane Water National Park to the west and Bouddi National Park to the east. Forming part of the same tidal estuary system is a separate but connected basin, the Kincumber Broadwater, lying to the east of Davistown. The total catchment area of the river is approximately . The land adjacent to the Brisbane Water was occupied for many thousands of years by Australian Aboriginal peoples, the Darkinjung and Kuringgai, who used the estuary and foreshore areas for cultural purposes. Brisbane Water was named in 1825 in honour of Sir Thomas Brisbane, a Governor of New South Wales, serving between 1820 and 1825.  History  Brisbane Water is part of the traditional lands of the Darkinjung and Kuringgai aboriginal peoples. Places of significance to Aboriginal people located in the area surrounding Brisbane Water that are listed on the Register of the National Estate include Daleys Point area and Staples Lookout, west of Woy Woy. Initial colonial explorers of the area were assisted by Bungaree, a leader of the Kuringgai tribe who went on to assist Phillip Parker King and Matthew Flinders in the circumnavigation of Australia. Twentieth century European settlement led to the development of an extensive local ferry network, including one supplying an otherwise isolated orphanage, a commuter service from Gosford to Woy Woy and a third operation dedicated to carrying farm produce. The last commuter ferries between Brisbane Water townships ceased in 1971. The only ferry service to exist now services the communities of Empire Bay, Davistown, Saratoga and Woy Woy and is operated by Central Coast Ferries. In 1973, local residents on Rileys Island requested a green ban after a development company intended to remove all native vegetation to make way for construction on the island. Environment The Brisbane Water estuary and foreshores have particularly high scenic value and include areas of pristine vegetation and extensive views of the water from a number of locations. Beaches, inlets and bays can be distinguished in the foreground with inherent juxtaposition of bushland- covered hills in the distance. Access to existing key vantage points allows for the public to experience the landscape character of the Brisbane Water estuary and its surrounds. With the approximate average bed level at and often as low as , Brisbane Water is considered mostly shallow, with a tidal impact of ¬±. The inlet narrows at a point known as The Rip, located adjacent to Ettalong Beach. The Rip has a rapid tidal current. The oyster industry is an important part of the local economy. In terms of Sydney rock oyster production, in 2007/2008 a total of ~250,000 dozens of oysters were produced in the Brisbane Water estuary, with a total value of 1.3 million representing approximately 3.6% of the NSW industry total for 2007/2008. During 2009, over 110 bird species were recorded within the estuary; with sixty vulnerable and fourteen endangered animal species, and sixteen vulnerable and eight endangered plant species. Some of Brisbane Water is classified by BirdLife International as an important bird area because it has an isolated population of up to ten breeding pairs of bush stone-curlews and sometimes supports flocks of the endangered regent honeyeater and swift parrot during autumn and winter, when the swamp mahogany trees are in flower.

The novel describes, in a satirical tone, the ultimate implications of the arms race. It is a continuation of the adventures of Ijon Tichy.About the novel on Lem's official website  Plot summary The evolution of artificial intelligence has allowed major world powers to sign a rather curious treaty: the Moon is divided into national zones (proportional to each nation's Earth real estate) and all weapons development and production must be moved there to be handled by factories. This is supposed to completely demilitarize Earth, achieving the long-sought dream of world peace. A MAD stabilizing factor is apparently preserved by the ability of countries, in case of war, to quickly ship weapons down from the Moon. Unknown to most people, a problem arises. The ever-increasing amount of autonomy given to Moon's automata, in order to conduct more-effective espionage in neighbors' nation facilities and also to defend one's own, leads to localized robotic conflicts on the Moon's surface. Eventually, after a number of events, there is a total discontinuation of any communication with the Moon. After a number of failed expeditions to reveal the truth on what is going on beneath the Moon's surface, Ijon Tichy is called to the rescue.Review at challengingdestiny.com Right before the return he was hit by a laser weapon which has led to his callosotomy. The resulting split personality leads to his inability to communicate properly both with the people and between the two \\"alter egos\\". This results in a good deal of slapstick comedy, e.g., involving hilarious conflicts between Tichy's left and right hand or leg. With the help of his friend, professor Tarantoga, he eventually succeeds in talking to himself. Another consequence of Tichy's visit is that he accidentally brings to the Earth particles of mysterious moon dust, which turns out to be the result of military-robotic \\"necroevolution\\", described in Lem's novel The Invincible and which brings a quiet devastation of the whole Earth's technological infrastructure and information stored in it.

Stanton (AP-69) was the lead ship of her class of Second World War United States Navy transport ships, named for the suffragist and abolitionist Elizabeth Cady Stanton. Elizabeth C. Stanton was launched on 22 December 1939 as Sea Star by Moore Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, for Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc., under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. Richard J. Welch; renamed Mormacstar in 1940; transferred to the Navy on 13 September 1942; and commissioned on 17 September 1942, Commander D. A. Frost, USN (Ret), in command. Service history Sailing from Norfolk on 24 October 1942, Elizabeth C. Stanton quickly landed her troops and equipment for the assault on North Africa on 8 November and got underway for the States within the week. After another rapid voyage to North Africa to support the troops fighting ashore, she returned to Norfolk on 24 April 1943 and the following day became flagship for amphibious exercises in Chesapeake Bay. On 10 May 1943 Elizabeth C. Stanton sailed again for the Mediterranean, where she saw action during the invasion of Sicily on 10 July. She remained off the island discharging troops and combat cargo, and fighting off enemy aircraft for six days. She returned to Algeria to prepare for the next operation, and on 9 September landed her troops at Salerno in the initial assault. Until the end of October, she carried reinforcement troops from Bizerte and Oran to Naples for the capture and occupation of Italy, then sailed for New York and overhaul. When Elizabeth C. Stanton returned to transport duty in January 1944, preparations were underway for the June invasion of Normandy; she made two voyages to carry troops and cargo for the huge buildup in the British Isles. On 14 March 1944 she departed Belfast for Algeria, and subsequently carried troops to Naples, taking part in amphibious exercises and antisubmarine patrols until August. Then she saw action in the initial landings on the coast of southern France. She continued to support this operation by transporting troops and cargo throughout the Mediterranean until returning to the United States on 8 November. After overhaul at New York, Elizabeth C. Stanton sailed for the Pacific on 4 January 1945, and arrived at Espiritu Santo on 23 February. Assigned to redeploy troops in the central and southern Pacific, she sailed from Pearl Harbor to the New Hebrides, Marianas, Marshalls, Solomons, Carolines and Okinawa Gunto. Arriving at San Francisco on 11 July for repairs, she sailed again in August to transport troops for the occupation of Japan. She returned to the West Coast late in 1945. On 20 January 1946 she carried 1,800 German prisoners of war with their US Army guards from Long Beach to Liverpool and Le Havre. She returned to New York on 5 March and was decommissioned on 3 April 1946, ownership reverting to the Maritime Commission on the same day. Elizabeth C. Stanton received five battle stars for World War II service. Return to commerce On 24 August 1946 the ship was returned to Moore McCormack Lines for operation until sold to Peninsular Navigation Co. on 14 February 1961 to be renamed Jacqueline Someck. The ship was sold back to Moore McCormack on 18 December 1963 to be sold again on 28 February 1964 to Windward Steamship Co. to be renamed National Seafarer. The ship was sold to interest in Japan and scrapped September 1967.

Starring Erland Josephson, it centers on a middle-aged intellectual who attempts to bargain with God to stop an impending nuclear holocaust. The Sacrifice was Tarkovsky's third film as a Soviet expatriate, after Nostalghia and the documentary Voyage in Time, and was also his last, as he died shortly after its completion. Like 1972's Solaris, it won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival. Plot The film opens on the birthday of Alexander (Erland Josephson), an actor who gave up the stage to work as a journalist, critic and lecturer on aesthetics. He lives in a beautiful house with his actress wife Adelaide (Susan Fleetwood), stepdaughter Marta (Filippa Franz√©n), and young son, \\"Little Man\\", who is temporarily mute due to a throat operation. Alexander and Little Man plant a tree by the seaside, when Alexander's friend Otto, a part-time postman, delivers a birthday card to him. When Otto asks, Alexander mentions that his relationship with God is \\"nonexistent\\". After Otto leaves, Adelaide and Victor, a medical doctor and a close family friend who performed Little Man's operation, arrive at the scene and offer to take Alexander and Little Man home in Victor's car. However, Alexander prefers to stay behind and talk to his son. In his monologue, Alexander first recounts how he and Adelaide found this lovely house near the sea by accident, and how they fell in love with the house and surroundings, but then enters a bitter tirade against the state of modern man. As Tarkovsky wrote, Alexander is weary of \\"the pressures of change, the discord in his family, and his instinctive sense of the threat posed by the relentless march of technology\\"; in fact, he has \\"grown to hate the emptiness of human speech\\". The family, as well as Victor and Otto, gather at Alexander's house for the celebration. Their maid Maria leaves, while nurse-maid Julia stays to help with the dinner. People comment on Maria's odd appearances and behavior. The guests chat inside the house, where Otto reveals that he is a student of paranormal phenomena, a collector of \\"inexplicable but true incidences.\\" Just when the dinner is almost ready, the rumbling noise of low-flying jet fighters interrupts them, and soon after, as Alexander enters, a news program announces the beginning of what appears to be all-out war, and possibly nuclear holocaust. His wife has a complete nervous breakdown. In despair, he vows to God to sacrifice all he loves, even Little Man, if this may be undone. Otto advises him to slip away and lie with Maria, who Otto convinces him is a witch, \\"in the best possible sense\\". Alexander takes his gun, leaves a note in his room, escapes the house, and rides his bike to where she is staying. She is bewildered when he makes his advances, but when he puts his gun to his temple (\\"Don't kill us, Maria\\"), at which point the jet-fighters' rumblings return, she soothes him and they consummate while floating above her bed, though Alexander's reaction is ambiguous. When he awakes the next morning, in his own bed, everything seems normal. Nevertheless, Alexander sets forth to give up all he loves and possesses. He tricks the family members and friends into going for a walk, and sets fire to their house when they are away. As the group rushes back, alarmed by the fire, Alexander confesses that he set the fire himself, and furiously runs around. Maria, who until then was not seen that morning, appears in the fire scene; Alexander tries to approach her, but is restrained by others. Without explanation, an ambulance appears in the area, and two paramedics chase Alexander, who appears to have lost control of himself, and drive off with him. Maria begins to bicycle away, but stops halfway to observe Little Man watering the tree he and Alexander planted the day before. As Maria leaves the scene, the \\"mute\\" Little Man, lying at the foot of the tree, speaks his only line, which quotes the opening Gospel of John: \\"In the beginning was the Word. Why is that, Papa?\\" Cast * Erland Josephson as Alexander * Susan Fleetwood as Adelaide * Allan Edwall as Otto * Gu√∞r√∫n G√≠slad√≥ttir as Maria * Sven Wollter as Victor * Val√©rie Mairesse as Julia * Filippa Franz√©n as Marta * Tommy Kjellqvist as Gossen (Little Man) * Per K√§llman, Tommy Nordahl as ambulance drivers Production =Pre-production= The Sacrifice originated as a screenplay entitled The Witch, which preserved the element of a middle- aged protagonist spending the night with a reputed witch. However, in this story, his cancer was miraculously cured, and he ran away with the woman. In March 1982, Tarkovsky wrote in his journal that he considered this ending \\"weak\\", as the happy ending was unchallenged. He wanted personal favorite and frequent collaborator Anatoly Solonitsyn to star in this picture, as was also his intention for Nostalghia, but when Solonitsyn died from cancer in 1982, the director rewrote the screenplay into what would become The Sacrifice and also filmed Nostalghia with Oleg Yankovsky as the lead. Tarkovsky considered The Sacrifice different from his earlier films because, while he commented that his recent films had been \\"impressionistic in structure\\", in this case he not only \\"aimed...to develop [its] episodes in the light of my own experience and of the rules of dramatic structure\\", but also to \\"[build] the picture into a poetic whole in which all the episodes were harmoniously linked\\", and that because of this, it \\"took on the form of a poetic parable\\". At the 1984 Cannes Film Festival, Tarkovsky was invited to film in Sweden, as he was a long-time friend of Anna-Lena Wibom of the Swedish Film Institute. He decided to film The Sacrifice with Erland Josephson, who was best known for his work with Ingmar Bergman, and whom Tarkovsky had directed in Nostalghia. Cinematographer Sven Nykvist, a friend of Josephson and frequent collaborator with Ingmar Bergman, was asked to join the production. Despite a contemporaneous offer to shoot Sydney Pollack's Out of Africa, Nykvist later said that it was \\"not a difficult choice\\", and like Josephson, he became a co-producer when he invested his fees back into the film. Production designer Anna Asp, who worked on Bergman's Autumn Sonata and After the Rehearsal, and had won an Academy Award alongside Susanne Lingheim for Fanny and Alexander, also joined the project, as well as Daniel Bergman, one of Ingmar's children, who worked as a camera assistant. Many critics would comment on The Sacrifice in the context of Bergman's work. =Filming= While often erroneously claimed to have been shot on F√•r√∂, The Sacrifice was actually filmed at N√§rsholmen on the nearby island of Gotland; the Swedish military denied Tarkovsky access to F√•r√∂. Alexander's house, specially built for the production, was to be burned for the climactic scene, in which Alexander burns his house and his possessions. The shot was very difficult to achieve, and the first failed attempt was, according to Tarkovsky, the only problem during shooting. Despite Sven Nykvist's protest, only one camera was used for this scene, and while shooting the burning house, the camera jammed and the footage was thus ruined. The scene had to be reshot, requiring a quick and very costly reconstruction of the house in two weeks. This time, two cameras were set up on tracks, running parallel to each other. The footage in the final version of the film is the second take, which lasts for six minutes (and ends abruptly because the camera had run through an entire reel). The cast and crew broke down in tears after the take was completed.Directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. Dir. Michal Leszczylowski. Perf. Brian Cox, Erland Josephson and Andrey Tarkovskiy. Svenska Filminstitutet (SFI), 1988. =Post-production= Tarkovsky and Nykvist performed significant amounts of color reduction on select scenes. According to Nykvist, almost sixty percent of the color was removed from these parts. Reception The film won Tarkovsky his second Grand Prix, after Solaris, his fourth FIPRESCI Prize at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival, and his third Palme D'Or nomination. The Sacrifice also won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. At the 22nd Guldbagge Awards, the film won the awards for Best Film and Best Actor (Erland Josephson). In 1988, it won the BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film. The film was selected as the Swedish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 59th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Since the 1980s, reviewers have been responding positively to the film; the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 86%, based on 42 reviews with an average rating of 7.58/10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Formally impressive, visually accomplished, and narratively rewarding, The Sacrifice places a fittingly solid capstone on a brilliant filmmaking career\\". In 1995, the Vatican compiled a list of 45 'great films', separated into the categories of \\"Religion\\", \\"Values\\", and \\"Art\\", to recognize the centennial of cinema. The Sacrifice was included under the first category, as well as Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev. However, critics have commented on The Sacrifice's religious ambiguities. Dennis Lim points out that it is \\"not exactly a simple allegory of Christian atonement and self-sacrifice\\". Catholic film critic Steven Greydanus contrasts the film's \\"dialectic of Christian and pagan ideas\\" with Andrei Rublev, writing that, while Rublev \\"[rejects] the advances of an alluring pagan witch as incompatible with Christian love\\", The Sacrifice \\"juxtaposes\\" both sensibilities.

The town is located on the edge of an elevated plateau (the Illawarra escarpment) about from the coast. At the , Robertson and its surrounding area had a population of 1,865. Robertson is known for its high annual rainfall and fertile soil. It was previously covered by an extensive temperate rainforest, most of which has been cleared for farming though remnants such as Robertson Nature Reserve still exist today. The town is colloquially known as \\"Robbo\\" by the locals. The town is surrounded by lush pasture used for beef and dairy production. It was once famous for cheese production; its distance from, and poor transport to, the Sydney markets meant that in the early days fresh milk was not a viable industry and so the key dairy industries were butter and cheese. Today, the remnants of the cheese industry are seen with one of the old cheese factories remaining in the town; it has been converted into a commercial row of shops. There is also the remnants of an old butter factory at the western end of town. Robertson is now more widely known for potato growing and is the home of the \\"Big Potato\\". The Big Potato was built in the 1970s by a local potato grower. Robertson is also where the 1995 movie Babe was filmed. History Robertson is named after former Premier of New South Wales Sir John Robertson, whose 1861 Land Act cleared the way for the establishment of the town.http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article13117116 Before then it was called Yarrawa Bush. Population In the 2016 Census, there were 1,865 people in Robertson. 76.7% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 5.6%. 89.0% of people spoke only English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 28.9%, Anglican 25.2% and Catholic 17.2%. Events Aerial photo with street names. The Big Potato In February or March of each year the Robertson Show is held, featuring \\"The Great Australian Potato Race\\". In spring Robertson holds a spring festival, with local gardens open to the public.  Attractions  =Robertson Hotel= Robertson is home to the \\"Robertson Hotel\\", a popular hotel and wedding venue. The hotel was originally built in 1924, opening as Hotel Robertson. It had a nine-hole golf course, two tennis courts, croquet, lawn bowls, billiards, fishing, hunting, horse riding, and an onsite mechanic who looked after guests' cars during their stay. The hotel won the \\"Most luxurious hotel in the Commonwealth\\" award in 1925, and was the first hotel in Australia to have phone lines to every room. The hotel was built to draw some of the Sydneysiders, who in the past retreated to the cool climate of the Southern Highlands to escape the heat of a Sydney summer and enjoy the beauty of the countryside. It was a success and the developer went on to subdivide and develop the local area, less successfully. In 1930 the hotel was sold and marketed as an exclusive country club and renamed Ranelagh Country Club after Ranelagh Gardens in London. However, the Great Depression made those plans short lived. In the buildup to World War II the hotel became a WAAAF training base,https://www.ozatwar.com/locations/no2waaafdepot.htm serving as a signals base and a training area for budding pilots. After World War II, the hotel was used as a hospice for returned pilots. The building sold again in 1947 and became St Anthony's College, a Franciscan friary and seminary; it was also used as a school and accommodation house run by the monks. It was during this period that the stained glass windows, rock walls and fountains were built. These are still in the building and around the gardens and grounds. The hotel has its own railway platform, Moss Vale ‚Äì Unanderra line, which is still used today. In 1972 the monks moved to smaller premises in Campbelltown and the building returned to its original use as a hotel, named Ranelagh House. The hotel was sold again in late 2007, and was renamed Fountaindale Grand Manor and Ranelagh Gardens, undergoing major renovations and refurbishments. Recently it was renamed to Robertson Hotel.http://www.fountaindale.com.au/ Fountaindale Grand Manor =Illawarra Fly= On 15 March 2008, the Illawarra Fly Tree Top Walk opened to the public. It is similar to the Otway Fly, in Victoria. It is perched on the Illawarra escarpment at Knights Hill, located east of Robertson. The tree top walk is joined with an observation outdoor tower with views of Wollongong. It is expected to have approximately 200,000 visitors every year. =The Big Potato= The pranksters posing with the Big Potato Face, an overnight guerilla art installation, in March 2010. Built in 1977 by local potato grower Jim Mauger, the Big Potato sits off the Illawarra Highway. It was modelled on the Sebago potato and is approximately ten metres long and four metres wide. The structure was originally meant to house a Potato Information Centre but rising costs proved an obstacle. Recently the locals of Robertson have worked together to turn the surrounding land into a park.  Transport  Aerial photo from north west Robertson was served by a railway station on the Unanderra‚ÄìMoss Vale railway line. The railway line is mainly used for freight. East Coast Heritage Rail operates its Cockatoo Run train on a monthly basis across the line from Sydney to Moss Vale and return (via Wollongong). Other heritage trains sometimes use the line, however no regular passenger services are present on the line. CountryLink buses travel along the Illawarra Highway, linking the Southern Highlands to Wollongong. The Illawarra Highway winds down the escarpment via the Macquarie Pass.

Small quantities of sulfur, iron and cobalt are usually present, and sometimes the arsenic is largely replaced by antimony. This last forms an isomorphous series with breithauptite (nickel antimonide).  Etymology and history  When, in the medieval German Erzgebirge, or Ore Mountains, a red mineral resembling copper-ore was found, the miners looking for copper could extract none from it, as it contains none; worse yet, the ore also sickened them. They blamed a mischievous sprite of German mythology, Nickel (similar to Old Nick) for besetting the copper (German: Kupfer).Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary, p888, W&R; Chambers Ltd, 1977. This German equivalent of \\"copper-nickel\\" was used as early as 1694 (other old German synonyms are Rotnickelkies and Arsennickel). In 1751, Baron Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was attempting to extract copper from kupfernickel mineral, and obtained instead a white metal that he called after the spirit, nickel. In modern German, Kupfernickel and Kupfer-Nickel designates the alloy Cupronickel. The names subsequently given to the ore, nickeline from F. S. Beudant, 1832, and niccolite, from J. D. Dana, 1868, refer to the presence of nickel; in Latin, niccolum. In 1971, the International Mineralogical Association recommended use of the name nickeline rather than niccolite. Preparation of NiAs The main compound within nickeline, nickel arsenide (NiAs), can be prepared by direct combination of the elements: Ni(s) + As(s) ‚Üí NiAs(s)  Occurrence  Nickeline is formed by hydrothermal modification of ultramafic rocks and associated ore deposits, and may be formed by replacement of nickel-copper bearing sulfides (replacing pentlandite, and in association with copper arsenic sulfides), or via metasomatism of sulfide-free ultramafic rocks, where metasomatic fluids introduce sulfur, carbonate, and arsenic. This typically results in mineral assemblaged including millerite, heazelwoodite and metamorphic pentlandite-pyrite via sulfidation and associated arsenopyrite-nickeline-breithauptite. Associated minerals include: arsenopyrite, barite, silver, cobaltite, pyrrhotite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, breithauptite and maucherite. Nickeline alters to annabergite (a coating of green nickel arsenate) on exposure to moist air. Most of these minerals can be found in the areas surrounding Sudbury and Cobalt, Ontario. Other localities include the eastern flank of the Widgiemooltha Dome, Western Australia, from altered pentlndite-pyrite-pyrrhotite assemblages within the Mariners, Redross and Miitel nickel mines where nickeline is produced by regional Au-As-Ag-bearing alteration and carbonate metasomatism. Other occurrences include within similarly modified nickel mines of the Kambalda area.  Crystal structure  The unit cell of nickeline is used as the prototype of a class of solids with similar crystal structures. It consists of arsenic atoms in a distorted hexagonal close-packed structure with nickel atoms in \\"octahedral\\" sites, which in NiAs have distorted to become trigonal prismatic.Inorganic Chemistry by Duward Shriver and Peter Atkins, 3rd Edition, W.H. Freeman and Company, 1999, pp.47,48. Compounds adopting the NiAs structure are generally the chalcogenides, arsenides, antimonides and bismuthides of transition metals. The unit cell of nickeline The following are the members of the nickeline group: *Achavalite: FeSe *Breithauptite: NiSb *Freboldite: CoSe *Kotulskite: Pd(Te,Bi) *Langistite: (Co,Ni)As *Nickeline: NiAs *Sobolevskite: Pd(Bi,Te) *Sudburyite: (Pd,Ni)Sb  Economic importance  Nickeline is rarely used as a source of nickel due to the presence of arsenic, which is deleterious to most smelting and milling techniques. When nickel sulfide ore deposits have been altered to produce nickeline, often the presence of arsenic renders the ore uneconomic when concentrations of As reach several hundred parts per million. However, arsenic bearing nickel ore may be treated by blending with 'clean' ore sources, to produce a blended feedstock which the mill and smelter can handle with acceptable recovery. The primary problem for treating nickeline in conventionally constructed nickel mills is the specific gravity of nickeline versus that of pentlandite. This renders the ore difficult to treat via the froth flotation technique. Within the smelter itself, the nickeline contributes to high arsenic contents which require additional reagents and fluxes to strip from the nickel metal.

They are located at the outer edge of Buzzards Bay, north of Martha's Vineyard, from which they are separated by Vineyard Sound, and constitute the town of Gosnold in Dukes County, Massachusetts. History Satellite image of Elizabeth Islands and Martha's Vineyard In 1602 the islands were first discovered by Europeans when the English explorer and colonialist Bartholomew Gosnold sighted them on his way to Virginia. However it was not until 1641, subsequent to the successful establishment of the first English North American colonies, that colonialists formally laid claim and settled the islands in the name of the English Crown as part of the country's nascent imperial expansion. At this time they renamed the islands after Elizabeth I, who had been Queen of England when the islands had first been discovered.\\"Visiting the Elizabeth Islands,\\" North American Review; vol. 5 (15); (September 1817), pp. 313-324; accessed July 7, 2009 In 1641, Thomas Mayhew the Elder, of Watertown, Massachusetts, bought the islands‚Äîalong with Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard‚Äîfrom William Alexander, the Earl of Stirling. Before the creation of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in 1691, the islands were part of the extinct Dukes County, New York. The first known European inhabitant was Francis Usselton, who had been banished at the time for making secret trades with the local Indians without consent from the governor. Geography and demographics The total land area of the islands is 34.55 km¬≤ (13.34 sq mi); and there was a permanent population of 75 persons as of the 2010 census, making it the smallest town in Massachusetts. = Named islands = Stretching south-west from land's end at Falmouth, Massachusetts, the islands are: *Nonamesset Island, the closest to the mainland *Veckatimest, a small island. *Gull Island, a small uninhabited island. *Uncatena Island, uninhabited as of the 2000 Census *Naushon Island, long and the largest. Composed of the main island along with the smaller Nonamesset, Monohansett, Bull, Cedar, and Bachelor islands. Owned by the Forbes' Naushon Island Trust, and while it is not generally open to the public, the Forbes family has set aside Tarpaulin Cove to the south and Kettle Cove to the north as well as Bull Island and Hadley Harbor to the northeast for public enjoyment including picknicking. *The Weepecket Islands, three small, publicly accessible islands north of central Naushon owned by the Forbes family. These islands offer very few places to land, are nearly obscured by water, and are home to numerous shore birds, seals and other animals. *Pasque Island, long, owned by a subset of the Forbes family, and covered in poison ivy. A shallow tidal creek cuts part way through the island. *Nashawena Island, long, owned by another subset of the Forbes family, it has grazing livestock. *Baret Island, located off the north shore of Nashawena Island. *Rock Island, located off the north shore of Nashawena Island. *Penikese Island, located about north of Nashawena and Cuttyhunk. Penikese is owned by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and has a colorful history. It was the site of a groundbreaking 19th-century research facility that was the precursor to the famed Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) in Woods Hole, was the site of the state's only leper colony in the early 20th century, and is currently a bird sanctuary and site of the Penikese Island School, a 35-year- old school for troubled teens. *Cuttyhunk Island, farthest west in the chain, and home to most of Gosnold's municipal population. Like Penikese, Cuttyhunk is not owned by the Forbes family, and therefore much of the island is publicly accessible. *Gosnold Island, located in Westend Pond on Cuttyhunk Island. = Named channels = Channels with strong tidal currents, known locally as holes, separate the islands from each other and the mainland. Currents of up to are driven by the different sizes and filling rates of Vineyard Sound to the southeast and Buzzards Bay to the northwest. At high tide, water flows from Buzzards Bay to the Vineyard Sound. Near mid-tide the water stops and reverses, filling the Bay at low tide. Listed from northeast to southwest, the named channels are: *Woods Hole separating the mainland from Nonamesset Island *Robinson's Hole between Naushon Island and Pasque Island *Quick's Hole between Pasque Island and Nashawena Island *Canapitsit Channel between Nashawena Island and Cuttyhunk Island. = Named harbors and coves = *Cuttyhunk Harbor is sheltered on its east by Nashawena Island on its west by Cuttyhunk Island and on its north by Penikese Island. *Tarpaulin Cove on the south shore of Naushon Island.

It was led by Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of the state of Shu Han, against opposing forces in the Nanzhong region (covering parts of present-day Yunnan, Guizhou and southern Sichuan). The campaign was a response to rebellions started by local governors in the Nanzhong region and intrusions by the Nanman (literally: \\"southern barbarians\\"). Background In October 222, Liu Bei, the founding emperor of Shu, lost the Battle of Xiaoting against Shu's ally- turned-rival state Wu. He died in Baidicheng (in present-day Fengjie County, Chengdu) in June 223. =Yong Kai's rebellion= Yong Kai (ÈõçÈóì), a descendant of Yong Chi (ÈõçÈΩí) and a tribal chief active in the Nanzhong region, heard about Liu Bei's death and started a rebellion against Shu rule. He killed Zheng Ang (Ê≠£ÊòÇ), the Shu-appointed Administrator of Jianning Commandery (Âª∫ÂØßÈÉ°; around present-day Qujing, Yunnan), and took Zheng Ang's successor Zhang Yi hostage. The Shu general Li Yan wrote a total of six letters to Yong Kai to dissuade him from rebelling, but Yong Kai arrogantly replied: \\"I heard that the sky cannot have two suns and the land cannot have two rulers. Now, from a distance away, I see that the Empire has been divided into three, so I am fearful and confused and do not know whom to pledge allegiance to.\\"(ÈÉΩË≠∑ÊùéÂö¥ËàáÈóìÊõ∏ÂÖ≠Á¥ôÔºåËß£ÂñªÂà©ÂÆ≥ÔºåÈóì‰ΩÜÁ≠î‰∏ÄÁ¥ôÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËìãËÅûÂ§©ÁÑ°‰∫åÊó•ÔºåÂúüÁÑ°‰∫åÁéãÔºå‰ªäÂ§©‰∏ãÈºéÁ´ãÔºåÊ≠£ÊúîÊúâ‰∏âÔºåÊòØ‰ª•ÈÅ†‰∫∫ÊÉ∂ÊÉëÔºå‰∏çÁü•ÊâÄÊ≠∏‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçÂÖ∂Ê°ÄÊÖ¢Â¶ÇÊ≠§„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Under urging from Shi Xie and the Wu general Bu Zhi, Yong Kai agreed to pledge allegiance to Wu and he sent Zhang Yi as a captive to the Wu emperor Sun Quan to express his sincerity. In return, Sun Quan appointed him as the Administrator of Yongchang Commandery (Ê∞∏ÊòåÈÉ°; covering parts of present-day western Yunnan), which was then guarded by the Shu officials L√º Kai and Wang Kang (Áéã‰ºâ). When Yong Kai showed up to take control of Yongchang, L√º Kai and Wang Kang refused to recognise his legitimacy and led both the local government and civilians alike to resist Yong Kai and prevent him from entering Yongchang. Yong Kai then repeatedly wrote letters to them in an attempt to convince them that he was the rightful Administrator, but L√º Kai refuted Yong Kai's claims and managed to retain control over Yongchang because the people of Yongchang highly regarded and trusted him.(...

At the same time, he also sent Deng Zhi and Chen Zhen as diplomats to Wu to meet Sun Quan and convince him to make peace with Shu and rebuild the Shu‚ÄìWu alliance against their rival state, Wei. In the meantime, Gao Ding (È´òÂÆö; or Gao Dingyuan È´òÂÆöÂÖÉ), the chief of the Sou tribe (ÂèüÊóè) in Yuexi/Yuesui Commandery (Ë∂äÂ∑ÇÈÉ°; around present-day Xichang, Sichuan) heard about Yong Kai's rebellion and decided to join, so he killed Jiao Huang (ÁÑ¶Áíú), the Administrator of Yuexi/Yuesui appointed by the Shu government. While Zhuge Liang was planning for a military campaign against the rebels, he appointed Gong Lu as the new Administrator of Yuexi/Yuesui and sent him there to make preparations in advance. However, Gong Lu ended up being killed by Gao Ding. Around the same time, Zhuge Liang also sent an official, Qi Xing (È†éË°å), to conduct an investigation in Zangke Commandery (ÁâÇÊüØÈÉ°; around present-day Guiyang or Fuquan, Guizhou). Upon arriving in Zangke, Qi Xing detained all the lower-ranked officials for questioning. Zhu Bao (Êú±Ë§í), the Shu-appointed Administrator (Â§™ÂÆà) of Zangke, had heard of the rebellions in the neighbouring Jianning and Yuexi/Yuesui commanderies, so he killed Qi Xing and joined the rebels. =Involvement of Meng Huo and the Nanman= After failing to capture Yongchang Commandery from L√º Kai and Wang Kang, Yong Kai turned to the Nanman tribes for help but they were unwilling to listen to him. Yong Kai then sought help from Meng Huo, a local leader with much influence and popularity among the Nanman. Meng Huo lied to the Nanman that the Shu government had made unreasonable demands from them and successfully incited them to rebel against Shu rule. Pacifying Nanzhong In the spring of 225, after Shu rebuilt its alliance with Wu against their rival state Wei, Zhuge Liang, the Imperial Chancellor of Shu, personally led Shu imperial forces south to pacify the Nanzhong region and quell the rebellions. Wang Lian, Zhuge Liang's chief clerk, attempted to dissuade him from participating in the campaign, but Zhuge Liang insisted because he was worried that the Shu generals might not be competent enough to deal with the rebels on their own.(ÊôÇÂçóÊñπË´∏ÈÉ°‰∏çË≥îÔºåË´∏Ëëõ‰∫ÆÂ∞áËá™ÂæÅ‰πãÔºåÈÄ£Ë´´‰ª•ÁÇ∫„ÄåÊ≠§‰∏çÊØõ‰πãÂú∞ÔºåÁñ´Áôò‰πãÈÑâÔºå‰∏çÂÆú‰ª•‰∏ÄÂúã‰πãÊúõÔºåÂÜíÈö™ËÄåË°å„Äç„ÄÇ‰∫ÆÊÖÆË´∏Â∞áÊâç‰∏çÂèäÂ∑±ÔºåÊÑèÊ¨≤ÂøÖÂæÄÔºåËÄåÈÄ£Ë®ÄËºíÊááËá≥ÔºåÊïÖÂÅúÁïôËÄÖ‰πÜ‰πã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 41.

Just as the rebels believed him and lowered their guard, he used the opportunity to strike back and move south to Panjiang (ÊßÉÊ±ü) to meet up with Ma Zhong, who had just defeated Zhu Bao's rebel forces and recaptured Zangke.

He pointed out the problems with leaving non-locals in charge: The people in Nanzhong had recently lost their loved ones in the battles and might still harbour bitter feelings towards the Shu government; if they had non-locals to govern them, they might feel even more resentful and choose to rebel again; if non-locals were put in charge, the Shu government would need to station troops in the area to protect them.(Âçó‰∏≠Âπ≥ÔºåÁöÜÂç≥ÂÖ∂Ê∏†ÁéáËÄåÁî®‰πã„ÄÇÊàñ‰ª•Ë´´‰∫ÆÔºå‰∫ÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËã•ÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÔºåÂâáÁï∂ÁïôÂÖµÔºåÂÖµÁïôÂâáÁÑ°ÊâÄÈ£üÔºå‰∏Ä‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõÂä†Â§∑Êñ∞ÂÇ∑Á†¥ÔºåÁà∂ÂÖÑÊ≠ªÂñ™ÔºåÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ËÄåÁÑ°ÂÖµËÄÖÔºåÂøÖÊàêÁ¶çÊÇ£Ôºå‰∫å‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõÂèàÂ§∑Á¥ØÊúâÂª¢ÊÆ∫‰πãÁΩ™ÔºåËá™Â´åÈáÅÈáçÔºåËã•ÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÔºåÁµÇ‰∏çÁõ∏‰ø°Ôºå‰∏â‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõ‰ªäÂêæÊ¨≤‰Ωø‰∏çÁïôÂÖµÔºå‰∏çÈÅãÁ≥ßÔºåËÄåÁ∂±Á¥ÄÁ≤óÂÆöÔºåÂ§∑„ÄÅÊº¢Á≤óÂÆâÊïÖËÄ≥„ÄÇ„Äç) Han Jin Chunqiu annotation in Sanguozhi vol. 35.(ÁõäÂ∑û„ÄÅÊ∞∏Êòå„ÄÅÁâÇÊüØ„ÄÅË∂äÂ∑ÇÂõõÈÉ°ÁöÜÂπ≥Ôºå‰∫ÆÂçΩÂÖ∂Ê∏†ÁéáËÄåÁî®‰πã„ÄÇÊàñ‰ª•Ë´´‰∫ÆÔºå‰∫ÆÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåËã•ÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÔºåÂâáÁï∂ÁïôÂÖµÔºåÂÖµÁïôÂâáÁÑ°ÊâÄÈ£üÔºå‰∏Ä‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõÂä†Â§∑Êñ∞ÂÇ∑Á†¥ÔºåÁà∂ÂÖÑÊ≠ªÂñ™ÔºåÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ËÄåÁÑ°ÂÖµËÄÖÔºåÂøÖÊàêÁ¶çÊÇ£Ôºå‰∫å‰∏çÊòì‰πüÔºõÂèàÔºåÂ§∑Á¥ØÊúâÂª¢ÊÆ∫‰πãÁΩ™ÔºåËá™Â´åÈáÅÈáçÔºåËã•ÁïôÂ§ñ‰∫∫ÔºåÁµÇ‰∏çÁõ∏‰ø°Ôºå‰∏â‰∏çÊòì‰πü„ÄÇ‰ªäÂêæÊ¨≤‰Ωø‰∏çÁïôÂÖµÔºå‰∏çÈÅãÁ≥ßÔºåËÄåÁ∂±Á¥ÄÁ≤óÂÆöÔºåÂ§∑„ÄÅÊº¢Á≤óÂÆâÊïÖËÄ≥„ÄÇ„Äç) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 70. Before completely withdrawing all Shu soldiers from the Nanzhong region, Zhuge Liang told Meng Huo and the other local leaders that he only required them to pay tribute to the Shu government in the form of gold, silver, oxen, warhorses, etc. He appointed locals such as Li Hui (from Jianning Commandery) and L√º Kai (from Yongchang Commandery) as commandery administrators. These commandery administrators were different from their predecessors in the sense that they only served as representatives of the Shu government in the region; the locals were governed by their respective local leaders and tribal chiefs.(‰∫ÆÊñºÊòØÊÇâÊî∂ÂÖ∂‰øäÂÇëÂ≠üÁç≤Á≠â‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÂÆòÂ±¨ÔºåÂá∫ÂÖ∂Èáë„ÄÅÈäÄ„ÄÅ‰∏π„ÄÅÊºÜ„ÄÅËÄïÁâõ„ÄÅÊà∞È¶¨‰ª•Áµ¶ËªçÂúã‰πãÁî®„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian vol. 70.

In Romance of the Three Kingdoms Although historical records mentioned that Zhuge Liang captured and released Meng Huo a total of seven times throughout the campaign, no details were provided. The 14th-century historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period, spends a total of about four-and-a-half chapters (87 to 91) fleshing out the details of each of the seven battles. It includes numerous fictional characters associated with Meng Huo, such as Lady Zhurong (Meng Huo's wife), Meng You (Meng Huo's brother) and other Nanman chieftains such as King Mulu and King Duosi. Apart from this, in the novel, the Shu generals Zhao Yun, Wei Yan and Ma Dai actively participate in the campaign, even though historically there is no mention about their involvement. # First battle: Zhao Yun leads his troops to attack Meng Huo and defeats his army. Wei Yan captures Meng Huo and brings him before Zhuge Liang. When Meng Huo complains that he was captured through trickery, Zhuge Liang releases him and allows him to return for another battle. # Second battle: Meng Huo builds a series of fortifications across a river and taunts the Shu forces to attack him. Ma Dai cuts off his supply route and kills Jinhuan Sanjie, Meng Huo's subordinate who was protecting the river fortifications. Ahuinan and Dongtuna, two of Meng Huo's subordinates, betray their master, capture him and hand him over as a prisoner to Zhuge Liang. Like before, Meng Huo complains that he had did not have a chance to fight the enemy fair and square. Zhuge Liang then shows him around the Shu camp before releasing him. # Third battle: Meng Huo's younger brother Meng You pretends to surrender to Zhuge Liang and lure Meng Huo into a trap. However, Zhuge Liang knows it is a ploy so he also pretends to play along, captures both of them in the trap, and releases them again. # Fourth battle: When Meng Huo hears that the Shu army is planning to retreat, he gathers all his troops and attacks the Shu camp. He falls into the pit traps in the camp and ends up being captured again. Zhuge Liang releases him once more. # Fifth battle: Meng Huo, having learnt his lesson from his previous defeats, adopts a more defensive stance. He lures the Shu forces into the poisonous marshes around the caves of his ally, King Duosi. However, Zhuge Liang manages to avoid the dangers of the marshes with the help of Meng Jie, Meng Huo's elder brother who does not participate in Meng Huo's rebellion against Shu. The Shu forces then defeat and kill King Duosi and capture Meng Huo again. Like before, Zhuge Liang releases Meng Huo again. # Sixth battle: Meng Huo's wife Lady Zhurong joins the battle and captures the Shu generals Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni. Ma Dai defeats Lady Zhurong later and captures her. Zhuge Liang releases Lady Zhurong in exchange for Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni. Meng Huo then turns to his ally King Mulu for help. King Mulu has the ability to control wild animals and direct them in battle. However, the Shu army is prepared for this and they use fire-breathing contraptions (referred to as juggernauts in some translations) to scare away the animals. King Mulu is killed in battle and Meng Huo ends up being captured again, but Zhuge Liang releases him once more. # Seventh battle: Meng Huo turns to another ally, Wutugu, for help. Wutugu's soldiers wear a special type of armour made of rattan which can deflect sharp blades and arrows. Zhuge Liang comes up with a plan for Wei Yan to lure Wutugu and his army into a trap in a valley, where explosives and fire traps have been set. The flammable rattan armour catches fire easily and Wutugu and his army completely perish in the valley. Meng Huo is captured once more. This time, he feels ashamed of himself and decides to surrender to Zhuge Liang and swear allegiance to Shu for the rest of his life. In popular culture A popular legend tells of how Zhuge Liang invented the mantou, a kind of steamed bun, during this campaign. It probably rose from the fact that the name mantou () is homonymous with mantou (). The story tells that, on the way back after the campaign, Zhuge Liang and the Shu army came to a swift-flowing river which defied all attempts to cross it. Locals informed him that he must sacrifice 50 men and throw their heads into the river to appease the river deity, who will then allow them to cross. As Zhuge Liang did not want to cause further bloodshed, he ordered buns shaped roughly like human heads ‚Äì round with a flat base ‚Äì to be made and thrown into the river. After a successful crossing, he named the bun \\"barbarian's head\\", which evolved into the present-day mantou. The southern campaign has been reenacted in a number of video games, including Koei's Dynasty Warriors series and Sangokushi Koumeiden. Both follow the events described in the historical novel Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and the player can defeat Meng Huo up to seven times. A whole chapter (out of five) is dedicated to this campaign in Sangokushi Koumeiden. References * Chang, Qu ( 4th century). Chronicles of Huayang (Huayang Guo Zhi). * Chen, Shou (3rd century).

Early life William David Ormsby-Gore was born into an Anglo-Irish aristocratic family on 20 May 1918 in Westminster, London, the second son of William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech, a Conservative politician, and Lady Beatrice Edith Mildred Gascoyne-Cecil. His maternal great-grandfather was British Prime Minister The 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. He was educated at St Cyprian's School, Eton College and New College, Oxford. A well-known story told of him at Eton is that, when a boy in his house killed himself, the housemaster called the boys together, and asked if any of them had any idea why this should have happened. Ormsby-Gore put up his hand and asked, \\"Please sir, could it have been the food?\\"Brian Johnston, A further slice of Johnners (Random House, 2011)Alex Renton, Stiff Upper Lip (Hachette UK, 2017) In 1939, he was commissioned into the Royal Artillery (Berkshire Yeomanry Field Regiment), served in the 'Phantom' reconnaissance unit, and worked with airborne and other special units. By the end of the War, he held the rank of major on the general staff. After the war, his father handed over to him all his land, and Ormsby-Gore farmed the 400 acres (1.6 km¬≤) of the Woodhill Estate, Oswestry, Shropshire. In 1948, he was commissioned a Major in the Shropshire Yeomanry, but left in 1950. Career =Member of Parliament= At the 1950 general election, he was elected Member of Parliament for Oswestry, which he remained until 1961. Under Prime Minister Anthony Eden he served briefly, from November 1956 to January 1957, as Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and under Prime Minister Harold Macmillan he was from 1957 to 1961 Minister of State for Foreign Affairs. After the election of U.S. President John F. Kennedy he was appointed British Ambassador to the United States on 18 October 1961. This meant that he had to take the Chiltern Hundreds on 1 June, so that he could resign from the House. =Ambassador to the United States= Ormsby-Gore knew Kennedy well from his time in London, where his father Joseph P. Kennedy had served as American Ambassador. Like Macmillan, Ormsby-Gore was distantly related to Kennedy, but had a closer relationship than did Macmillan with the President-elect and his brother Robert. Six months after Kennedy took office Ormsby-Gore was in Washington, D.C. Referred to under the Kennedy administration as \\"our kind of Ambassador\\", he supplied Kennedy with a stream of advice and Cuban cigars via his diplomatic bag. He was almost a resident at the White House, being more a friend of the family than a mere ambassador. After President Kennedy's assassination there were rumours of a romance between Ormsby-Gore and Jacqueline Kennedy. In 1968 he proposed marriage to her, but, she did not accept. Ormsby-Gore was one of the pallbearers at Robert F. Kennedy's funeral along with Robert McNamara, John Glenn, W. Averell Harriman, C. Douglas Dillon, Kirk Lemoyne Billings (schoolmate of John F. Kennedy), Stephen Edward Smith (husband to Jean Ann Kennedy), David Hackett, Jim Whittaker and John Seigenthaler Sr. Under the Lyndon B. Johnson administration relations were more formal but remained excellent; and Ormsby-Gore maintained his position after the Labour government took power in Britain in 1964. A fierce opponent of oil-barrel politics, Ormsby-Gore's terse dismissal of the phenomenon ran: \\"It would indeed be a tragedy if the history of the human race proved to be nothing more than the story of an ape playing with a box of matches on a petrol dump.\\" The extent of his influence over the Kennedy administration is disputed. Unable to persuade the American government to agree with the British line over Yemen and the Congo, or to proceed with either a negotiated settlement with Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev over Berlin or the Skybolt ballistic missile programme, he nevertheless played a significant role in the Cuban Missile Crisis and ensured that Britain's views were taken into account by the American government. The friendships of Ormsby-Gore and Macmillan with John F. Kennedy helped secure the first Test-Ban Treaty in 1963. Macmillan and Ormsby-Gore had been attempting to achieve a test-ban treaty with the Russians for the past ten years, and won Kennedy over through letters from Macmillan and frank discussions between Ormsby-Gore and Kennedy. They convinced him to act like a statesman and conclude Test-ban treaties with Russia and not fear being branded as an appeaser by political opponents in the United States. Ormsby-Gore was a participant in what is referred to as a \\"twenty-five year conversation to do with the role of a leader in a democratic society\\". He encouraged Kennedy to remain focused on issues relevant to the world and the future, rather than attempting to protect himself politically. According to the Duchess of Devonshire, who travelled with the British delegation to Kennedy's funeral in November 1963, Macmillan's successor as Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home had wanted to appoint Ormsby-Gore as Foreign Secretary, but R. A. Butler had insisted on having this post as a condition of serving under Home.Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire, Diary, 27 November 1963, quoted in Deborah Devonshire (2010) Wait For Me! After Kennedy's assassination, Ormsby- Gore became involved in a relationship with his widow Jacqueline, going withon a vacation with in Cambodia. He proposed marriage to her in 1965 and was turned down. In 1968, when she married the Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis, Lord Harlech was opposed and wrote to her asking her mind to change her mind.. =Later life= Ormsby-Gore retired as ambassador in 1965, a year after his father died, and took his seat in the House of Lords as Lord Harlech, briefly also holding the position of deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. He also had a successful career as a television executive, founding HTV, and served as president of the British Board of Film Classification. He had an active interest in the avant-garde, and for nearly ten years, beginning in 1969, was patron of the Institute for Research in Art and Technology. Personal life On 9 February 1940, Lord Harlech married Sylvia Lloyd (b. 24 Apr 1920)Hywel Trewyn & Tony Bonnici, \\"Lord Harlech's tragic life and death\\", Daily Post, 15 November 2016.

In 1968, Lord Harlech proposed to the widowed Jacqueline Kennedy, whom he had been friends with since before her husband's assassination. Jacqueline Kennedy declined his offer of marriage in a letter, writing: \\"If ever I can find some healing and some comfort ‚Äî it has to be with somebody who is not part of all my world of past and pain ... I can find that now if the world will let us.\\" She later married Aristotle Onassis. On 11 December 1969, Lord Harlech married American socialite Pamela Colin, daughter of a Manhattan top corporate lawyer, herself a London resident editor of Vogue and then food editor of the British Vogue.\\"Lord Harlech obituary: Wife's departure was the start of peer's sad decline\\", The Sydney Morning Herald, February 12, 2016. The wedding was attended by Princess Margaret, the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, the Earl and Countess of Drogheda, the Earl and Countess of Airlie, The Countess Gowrie, Lord and Lady David Cecil, Sir Fitzroy Maclean, J.

Crystals have the form of cubic icositetrahedra but, as first observed by Sir David Brewster in 1821, they are not optically isotropic, and are therefore pseudo-cubic. Goniometric measurements made by Gerhard vom Rath in 1873 led him to refer the crystals to the tetragonal system. Optical investigations have since proved the crystals to be still more complex in character, and to consist of several orthorhombic or monoclinic individuals, which are optically biaxial and repeatedly twinned, giving rise to twin-lamellae and to striations on the faces. When the crystals are raised to a temperature of about 500 ¬∞C they become optically isotropic and the twin-lamellae and striations disappear, although they reappear when the crystals are cooled again. This pseudo-cubic character of leucite is very similar to that of the mineral boracite. The crystals are white or ash-grey in colour, hence the name suggested by A. G. Werner in 1701, from ŒªŒµœÖŒ∫ŒøœÇ, '(matt) white'. They are transparent and glassy when fresh, albeit with a noticeably subdued 'subvitreous' lustre due to the low refractive index, but readily alter to become waxy/greasy and then dull and opaque; they are brittle and break with a conchoidal fracture. The Mohs hardness is 5.5, and the specific gravity 2.47. Inclusions of other minerals, arranged in concentric zones, are frequently present in the crystals. On account of the color and form of the crystals the mineral was early known as 'white garnet'. French authors in older literature may employ Ren√© Just Ha√ºy's name amphig√®ne, but 'leucite' is the only name for this mineral species that is recognised as official by the International Mineralogical Association.

Argentite belongs to the galena group. Silver is extracted from the ore-argentite. The name \\"argentite\\" sometimes also refers to pseudomorphs of argentite: specimens of acanthite which still display some of the outward signs of the cubic crystal form, even though their actual crystal structure is monoclinic due to the lower temperature. This form of acanthite is occasionally found as uneven cubes and octahedra, but more often as dendritic or earthy masses, with a blackish lead-grey color and metallic luster. Cleavage, which is so prominent a feature in galena, here presents only in traces. The mineral is perfectly sectile and has a shining streak; hardness 2.5, specific gravity is 7.2‚Äì7.4. It occurs in mineral veins, and when found in large masses, as in Mexico and in the Comstock Lode in Nevada, it forms an important ore of silver. The mineral was mentioned in 1529 by G. Agricola, but the name argentite was not used till 1845 and is due to W. Haidinger. Old names for the species are Glaserz, silver-glance and vitreous silver. A related copper-rich mineral occurring e.g. in Jalpa, Zacatecas, Mexico, is known as jalpaite.

Jacobs, J.T. Allen and G.R. Bozzoli 1937. Wonderstone. Geological Survey of South Africa Bulletin no. 8. Uses The compact variety of pyrophyllite is used for slate pencils and tailors' chalk (French chalk), and is carved by the Chinese into small images and ornaments of various kinds. Other soft compact minerals (steatite and pinite) used for these Chinese carvings are included with pyrophyllite under the terms agalmatolite and pagodite. Pyrophyllite is easily machineable and has excellent thermal stability, so it is added to clay to reduce thermal expansion when firing, but it has many other industry uses when combined with other compounds, such as in insecticide and for making bricks. Pyrophyllite is also widely used in high-pressure experiments, both as a gasket material and as a pressure-transmitting medium. See also * References .

The Maribyrnong River is a perennial river of the Port Phillip catchment, located in the northwestern suburbs of Melbourne, in the Australian state of Victoria. Course The Maribyrnong River draws its headwaters from near Mount Macedon within the Macedon Ranges, part of the Great Dividing Range. Formed by the confluence of the Jackson Creek and the Deep Creek below , the river flows generally southward, joined by two minor tributaries before reaching its confluence with the Yarra River at , to eventually empty into Port Phillip. The river descends over its course. =Headwaters= Jackson Creek, a tributary of the Maribyrnong River at Clarkefield. The head of the Maribyrnong catchment is situated in the Macedon Ranges region of central Victoria around northwest of Melbourne City Centre. Various creeks beginning in the southern Mount Macedon area flow into Riddells Creek which in turn flows into the Jackson Creek. The Jackson Creek starts its journey northwest of Gisborne, north of Melbourne CBD. The other major tributary of the Maribyrnong is Deep Creek, which also has its headwaters in the northern and eastern parts of the Macedon Ranges. The creek has cut a deep valley through the surrounding basalt plains in its southward course, in particular as it flows through localities such as Konagaderra and Bulla. To the west of Melbourne Airport the tributaries of the Jackson Creek and the Deep Creek conjoin to form the Maribyrnong River. The Organ Pipes National Park can be found adjacent to the Jackson Creek, near the Calder Freeway, with picnic facilities and a prominent display of basaltic columns a geological formation, so named because they look like organ pipes. =Middle reaches= Maribyrnong River at Brimbank Park The river flows south and west. At Keilor the river winds back on itself in a giant horseshoe bend, before winding south again at Brimbank Park. Here the river flows below the western plains. Brimbank Park forms a huge amphitheatre in the bend in the river with picnic areas, cycle and walking trails, and a caf√©, that is usually busy on weekends and public holidays. The area is rich in birdlife and native fauna. The Maribyrnong River Trail shared path starts at Brimbank Park, following mostly beside the river to near its conjunction with the Yarra River in Footscray. At Avondale Heights and Essendon West residents have views over the river valley to the skyscrapers of the Melbourne CBD. =Lower reaches= Aerial panorama of Flemington Racecourse along the Maribyrnong. Taken August 2018. The river flows past Pipemakers Park at Maribyrnong and Melbourne's Living Museum of the West which presents information on the history of the river and the early industrial history of the site. Dolphins are sometimes sighted in the lower reaches of the river, along with many water birds, especially at Burndap Park. Footscray Park opposite the Flemington Racecourse is only metres down river from Pipemakers Park and Burndap Park, the river then meanders across the floodplain to its juncture with the Yarra River at Yarraville.

The name Maribyrnong however, is derived from either mirring-gnay-bir-nong which in Woiwurrung, the language of the local Wurundjeri people, is said to mean \\"I can hear a ringtail possum\\" or \\"saltwater river\\" (Gunung or Gunnung is Woiwurrung for river, as seen in the names of other watercourses in the area, such as; Koonung Creek and Birrarung). Marriburnong is an alternate spelling listed on a map dated from 1840. The inner western and north-western suburbs of Melbourne are located in the vicinity of the Maribyrnong River and the river has given its name to the suburb of Maribyrnong and the local government area, the City of Maribyrnong. History The Maribyrnong River valley has been home for the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin nation for up to years. Human remains dated at least yearsold have been found along the river, with much older signs of human habitation also present. The first Europeans to explore along the river were the party led by Charles Grimes, Deputy Surveyor-General of New South Wales, in February 1803. John Batman is likely to have explored up the river in early 1835. With the establishment of the colony of Melbourne later that year, sheep runs were soon established by Edmund Davis Fergusson and Michael Solomon in the Avondale and Sunshine areas. On Solomon's sheep station the ford now near the west end of Canning Street in Avondale Heights soon became known as Solomon's Ford. This was the lowest crossing on the Saltwater (Maribyrnong) River, and the furthest inland point of tidal influence. Batman is believed to have crossed the river at this point probably in the well worn steps of Aboriginals. It was for many years the only way from Melbourne to Geelong and land west. During the second half of the 19th century much of Melbourne's industry was located along the river, and the water became very degraded. With the closure of many industries since the 1960s and 1970s, much river front land has opened up to parkland and highly sought after residential estates. Recreational use As the second major river in metropolitan Melbourne, the Maribyrnong plays a very important part in Melbourne's recreation. Boating, cycling along its bike paths such as the Maribyrnong River Trail, fishing, and walking. Light bushwalking can also be done and nature watchers can observe Australian native fauna such as echidna, wallabies as well as the ubiquitous possums and flying foxes.

Native mammals include swamp wallabies, grey-headed flying foxes, common brushtail possums, common ringtail possums, water rats, echidnas, and platypus in the upper reaches of the river. Native reptile species include eastern brown snakes, tiger snakes, skinks, and common snakeneck turtles. Native birds include the eastern whipbird, cockatoo, rainbow lorikeet, galah, brown falcon, peregrine falcon, square-tailed kite, royal spoonbill, black swan, Pacific black duck, little pied cormorant, moorhen, and long-billed corella. There are various native frogs and native fish species include the short-finned eel, tupong, short-headed lamprey, Australian grayling, southern black bream, common galaxias, broad-finned galaxias and spotted galaxias. Starfish may also be found in the river. =Introduced species= Introduced species include the red fox, European rabbit, and feral cat. While introduced birds include the song thrush, common blackbird, common myna, common starling, house sparrow, spotted turtle dove, rock pigeon, and mallard. Common carp have also been introduced to the river.

The term first came into popular usage after it was used in a 1946 speech by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. The two nations have been close allies during many conflicts in the 20th and 21st centuries, including World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Cold War, the Gulf War, and the War on Terror. Although both governments also have close relationships with many other nations, the level of cooperation between the U.K. and the U.S. in trade and commerce, military planning, execution of military operations, nuclear weapons technology, and intelligence sharing has been described as \\"unparalleled\\" among major world powers. The close relationships between British and American heads of government such as Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher as well as between Tony Blair and both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have been noted. At the diplomatic level, characteristics include recurring public representations of the relationship as \\"special\\", frequent and high-profile political visits and extensive information exchange at the diplomatic working level. Some critics deny the existence of a \\"special relationship\\", calling it a myth.John Baylis, \\"The 'special Relationship' A Diverting British Myth?,\\" in Cyril Buffet, Beatrice Heuser (eds.), Haunted by History: Myths in International Relations, ch. 10, Berghahn Books, 1998, Former U.S. President Barack Obama considered Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel to be his \\"closest international partner\\" and said the U.K. would be at the \\"back of the queue\\" in any trade deal with the U.S. if it left the European Union, while accusing British Prime Minister David Cameron of being \\"distracted by a range of other things\\" during the 2011 military intervention in Libya. During the 1956 Suez Crisis, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower threatened to revoke IMF loans due to Britain's invasion of Egypt to recapture the Suez Canal. In the 1960s, British Prime Minister Harold Wilson rebuffed U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson's request to employ British troops in the Vietnam War. Prime Minister Thatcher also privately opposed the 1983 United States invasion of Grenada, while President Reagan unsuccessfully pressured against the 1982 Falklands War. Following the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, the British government under Prime Minister Theresa May sought to establish \\"a new special relationship\\" with the Trump administration. Trump claimed his relationship with Theresa May was \\"the highest level of special.\\" Origins Although the \\"Special Relationship\\" between the U.K. and the U.S. was perhaps most memorably emphasized by Churchill, its existence, and even the term itself, had been recognized since the 19th century, not least by rival powers.Existence in the 19th century and early 20th century: * , quoting the \\"semi-official organ\\" the North-German Gazette: \\"There is, therefore, not the slightest occasion for other States to adopt as their model and example a form of agreement which may, perhaps, be advantage to England and America in their special relationship\\". * \\"No Ambassador to this or any other nation is similarly honoured ... It is intended to be, we need hardly say, precisely what it is, a unique compliment, a recognition on our part that Great Britain and the United States stand to one another in a special relationship, and that between them some departure from the merely official attitude is most natural\\". * \\"The answer of the [Japanese] Ambassador [Baron Kato] shows that he and his Government even then [1911] appreciated the special relationship between this country [the United Kingdom] and the United States ... That, probably, the Japanese Government understands now, as clearly as their predecessors understood in 1911 that we could never make war on the United States\\". * \\"After comparing the programmes of Britain, America, and Japan, the First Lord said that so far from importing into our maintenance of the one- Power standard a spirit of keen and jealous competition, we had, on the contrary, interpreted it with a latitude which could only be justified by our desire to avoid provoking competition and by our conception of the special relationship of good will and mutual understanding between ourselves and the United States\\". * \\"As was well pointed out in our columns yesterday by Professor Muirhead, Great Britain stands in a quite special relationship to that great Republic [the United States]\\". * quoting J. A. Spender: \\"The problem for British and Americans was to make their special relationship a good relationship, to be candid and open with each other, and to refrain from the envy and uncharitableness which too often in history had embittered the dealings of kindred peoples\\". The governments of the United States and Britain were enemies when foreign relations between them first began, after the American colonies declared their independence from British rule, triggering the American Revolutionary War. Relations often continued to be strained through the mid-19th century, erupting into conflict during the War of 1812 and again verging on war when Britain almost supported the rebel Confederacy in the early part of the American Civil War. British leaders were constantly annoyed from the 1830s to the 1860s by what they saw as Washington's pandering to the democratic mob, as in the Aroostook War in 1838‚Äì39 and the Oregon boundary dispute in 1844‚Äì46. However, British middle-class public opinion sensed a common \\"special relationship\\" between the two peoples based on their shared language, migrations, evangelical Protestantism, classical liberalism, and extensive private trade. This constituency rejected war, forcing London to appease the Americans. During the Trent Affair of late 1861, London drew the line and Washington retreated.George L. Bernstein, \\"Special Relationship and Appeasement: Liberal policy towards America in the age of Palmerston.\\" Historical Journal 41#3 (1998): 725‚Äì750. Troops from the two nations had begun fighting side-by-side, sometimes spontaneously, in skirmishes overseas by 1859, and the two democracies shared a common bond of sacrifice during World War I. Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald's visit to the U.S. in 1930 confirmed his own belief in the \\"special relationship\\", and for this reason he looked to the Washington Treaty rather than a revival of the Anglo‚ÄìJapanese alliance as the guarantee of peace in the Far East. However, as the historian David Reynolds observes: \\"For most of the period since 1919, Anglo-American relations had been cool and often suspicious. United States 'betrayal' of the League of Nations was only the first in a series of US actions‚Äîover war debts, naval rivalry, the 1931‚Äì2 Manchurian crisis and the Depression‚Äîthat convinced British leaders that the United States could not be relied on\\". Equally, as President Harry S. Truman's Secretary of State, Dean Acheson, recalled: \\"Of course a unique relation existed between Britain and America‚Äîour common language and history ensured that. But unique did not mean affectionate. We had fought England as an enemy as often as we had fought by her side as an ally\\". Churchillian emphasis A poster from World War I showing Britannia arm-in-arm with Uncle Sam, symbolizing the Anglo‚ÄìAmerican alliance The outbreak of World War II provoked the rapid emergence of an unambiguously positive relationship between the two nations. The fall of France in 1940 has been described as a decisive event in international relations, leading the Special Relationship to displace the Entente Cordiale as the pivot of the international system. During the war, one observer noted that \\"Great Britain and the United States integrated their military efforts to a degree unprecedented among major allies in the history of warfare\\". \\"Each time I must choose between you and Roosevelt\\", Churchill shouted at General Charles de Gaulle, leader of the Free French, in 1945, \\"I shall choose Roosevelt\\". Between 1939 and 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt exchanged 1,700 letters and telegrams and met 11 times. Churchill estimated that they had 120 days of close personal contact. On one occasion Roosevelt went to Churchill's room when Churchill had just emerged from the bath. On his return from Washington Churchill said to King George VI, \\"Sir, I believe I am the only man in the world to have received the head of a nation naked.\\"Richard M. Langworth, \\"Churchill's Naked Encounter\\", (27 May 2011), https://richardlangworth.com/churchills-naked-encounter Churchill's mother was a U.S. citizen, and he keenly felt the links between the two English-speaking peoples. He first used the term \\"special relationship\\" on 16 February 1944, when he said it was his \\"deepest conviction that unless Britain and the United States are joined in a special relationship ‚Ä¶ another destructive war will come to pass\\". He used it again in 1945 to describe not the Anglo‚ÄìAmerican relationship alone, but the U.K.'s relationship with both the U.S. and Canada. The New York Times Herald quoted Churchill in November 1945: Churchill used the phrase again a year later, at the onset of the Cold War, this time to note the special relationship between the U.S. on the one hand, and the English- speaking nations of the British Commonwealth and Empire under the leadership of the U.K. on the other. The occasion was his \\"Sinews of Peace Address\\", delivered in Fulton, Missouri, on 5 March 1946: In the opinion of one international relations specialist: \\"the United Kingdom's success in obtaining US commitment to cooperation in the postwar world was a major triumph, given the isolation of the interwar period\\". A senior British diplomat in Moscow, Thomas Brimelow, admitted: \\"The one quality which most disquiets the Soviet government is the ability which they attribute to us to get others to do our fighting for us ... they respect not us, but our ability to collect friends\\". Conversely, \\"the success or failure of United States foreign economic peace aims depended almost entirely on its ability to win or extract the co- operation of Great Britain\\". Reflecting on the symbiosis, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1982 declared: \\"The Anglo-American relationship has done more for the defence and future of freedom than any other alliance in the world\\". Meeting of the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the British Chief of the Defence Staff in 2006 While most government officials on both sides have supported the Special Relationship, there have been sharp critics. British journalist Guy Arnold (1932‚Äì2020) denounced it in 2014 as a \\"sickness in the body politic of Britain that needs to be flushed out\\". Instead Arnold calls for closer relationships with Europe and Russia so as to rid \\"itself of the US incubus.\\"Guy Arnold, America and Britain: Was There Ever a Special Relationship? (London: Hurst, 2014) pp 6, 153 Military cooperation United Kingdom and United States at a World War II memorial in Upper Benefield, England The intense level of military co-operation between the UK and US began with the creation of the Combined Chiefs of Staff in December 1941, a military command with authority over all US and British operations. Following the end of the Second World War the joint command structure was disbanded, but close military cooperation between the nations resumed in the early 1950s with the start of the Cold War.Derek E. Mix - The United Kingdom: Background and Relations with the United States - fas.org. Congressional Research Service. 29 April 2015. Retrieved 13 April 2017. =Shared military bases= Since the Second World War and the subsequent Berlin Blockade, the US has maintained substantial forces in Great Britain. In July 1948, the first American deployment began with the stationing of B-29 bombers. Currently, an important base is the radar facility RAF Fylingdales, part of the US Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, although this base is operated under British command and has only one USAF representative for largely administrative reasons. Several bases with a significant US presence include RAF Menwith Hill (only a short distance from RAF Fylingdales), RAF Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall (scheduled to close in 2027), RAF Fairford (the only base for US strategic bombers in Europe), RAF Croughton (not an air base but a military communications hub) and RAF Welford (an ammunition storage depot).Richard Reeve, ORG Explains #6: UK-US Defence and Security Relations, Oxford Research Group (July 2018, updated May 2019), p.4. Retrieved 3 June 2019. Following the end of the Cold War, which was the main rationale for their presence, the number of US facilities in the UK has been reduced in number in line with the US military worldwide. Despite this, these bases have been used extensively in support of various peacekeeping and offensive operations of the 1990s and early 21st century. The two nations also jointly operate on the British military facilities of Diego Garcia in the British Indian Ocean Territory and on Ascension Island, a dependency of Saint Helena in the Atlantic Ocean. The US Navy also makes occasional use of British naval bases at Gibraltar and Bermuda and the US Air Force uses RAF Akrotiri on Cyprus, mainly for reconnaissance flights.Reeve, UK-US Defence and Security Relations pp.4-5. =Nuclear weapons development= The Quebec Agreement of 1943 paved the way for the two countries to develop atomic weapons side by side, the UK handing over vital documents from its own Tube Alloys project and sending a delegation to assist in the work of the Manhattan Project. The US later kept the results of the work to itself under the postwar McMahon Act, but after the UK developed its own thermonuclear weapons, the US agreed to supply delivery systems, designs and nuclear material for British warheads through the 1958 US‚ÄìUK Mutual Defence Agreement. The UK purchased first Polaris and then the US Trident system which remains in use. The 1958 agreement gave the UK access to the facilities at the Nevada Test Site, and from 1963 it conducted a total of 21 underground tests there before the cessation of testing in 1991.'Time Runs Out as Clinton Dithers over Nuclear Test', Independent On Sunday (20 June 1993), p. 13. The agreement under which this partnership operates was updated in 2004; anti-nuclear activists argued renewal may breach the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.Richard Norton- Taylor, Nuclear weapons treaty may be illegal, The Guardian (27 July 2004).

The U.K. was involved in writing the specification and selection and its largest defense contractor, BAE Systems, is a partner of the American prime contractor Lockheed Martin. BAE Systems is also the largest foreign supplier to the US Defense Department and has been permitted to buy important US defense companies such as Lockheed Martin Aerospace Electronic Systems and United Defense. The US operates several British designs including Chobham Armour, the Harrier GR9/AV-8B Harrier II and the US Navy T-45 Goshawk. The UK also operates several American designs, including the Javelin anti-tank missile, M270 rocket artillery, the Apache gunship, C-130 Hercules and C-17 Globemaster transport aircraft. Other areas of cooperation =Intelligence sharing= RAF Menwith Hill near Harrogate, England, which provides communications and intelligence support services to both the United Kingdom and the United States A cornerstone of the Special Relationship is the collecting and sharing of intelligence. This originated during World War II with the sharing of code-breaking knowledge and led to the 1943 BRUSA Agreement, signed at Bletchley Park. After World War II the common goal of monitoring and countering the threat of communism prompted the UK-USA Security Agreement of 1948. This agreement brought together the SIGINT organizations of the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand and is still in place today (see: Five Eyes). The head of the CIA station in London attends each weekly meeting of the British Joint Intelligence Committee. One present-day example of such cooperation is the UKUSA Community, comprising the U.S. National Security Agency, the U.K. Government Communications Headquarters, Australia's Defence Signals Directorate and Canada's Communications Security Establishment collaborating on ECHELON, a global intelligence gathering system. Under classified bilateral accords, UKUSA members do not spy on each other.Bob Drogin and Greg Miller, 'Purported Spy Memo May Add to US Troubles at UN', Los Angeles Times (4 March 2003). Following the discovery of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, the CIA began to assist the Security Service (MI5) by running its own agent networks in the British Pakistani community. One intelligence official commented on the threat against the US from British Islamists: \\"The fear is that something like this would not just kill people but cause a historic rift between the US and the UK\\".Tim Shipman, 'Why the CIA has to spy on Britain', The Spectator (28 February 2009), pp. 20‚Äì1. =Economic policy= The U.S. is the largest source of foreign direct investment to the U.K., and the U.K. is likewise the largest single foreign direct investor in the U.S.\\"Country Profiles: United States of America\\" on UK Foreign & Commonwealth Office website British trade and capital have been important components of the American economy since its colonial inception. In trade and finance, the Special Relationship has been described as \\"well- balanced\\", with London's \\"light-touch\\" regulation in recent years attracting a massive outflow of capital from New York.Irwin Seltzer, 'Britain is not America's economic poodle', The Spectator (30 September 2006), p. 36. The key sectors for British exporters to the U.S. are aviation, aerospace, commercial property, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and heavy machinery.\\"International Trade ‚Äì The 51st State?\\", Midlands Business Insider (1 July 2007). British ideas, classical and modern, have also exerted a profound influence on U.S. economic policy, most notably those of the historian Adam Smith on free trade and the economist John Maynard Keynes on counter-cyclical spending, while the British government has adopted workfare reforms from the U.S. American and British investors share entrepreneurial attitudes towards the housing market, and the fashion and music industries of each country are major influences on their counterparts.Seltzer, 'Not America's economic poodle', p. 36. Trade ties have been strengthened by globalisation, while both governments agree on the need for currency reform in China and educational reform at home to increase their competitiveness against India's developing service industries. In 2007, the U.S. ambassador suggested to British business leaders that the Special Relationship could be used \\"to promote world trade and limit environmental damage as well as combating terrorism\\".'Special ties should be used for trade and the climate says US ambassador', Western Daily Press (4 April 2007), p. 36. In a press conference that made several references to the Special Relationship, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, in London with U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague on 9 September 2013, said: History The Special Relationship has often depended on the personal relations between British prime ministers and U.S. presidents. The first example was the close relationship between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt, who were in fact distantly related.Spencer family Prior to their collaboration during World War II, Anglo‚ÄìAmerican relations had been somewhat frosty. President Woodrow Wilson and Prime Minister David Lloyd George in Paris had been the only previous leaders of the two nations to meet face-to-face, but had enjoyed nothing that could be described as a \\"special relationship\\", although Lloyd George's wartime Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, got on well with Wilson during his time in the US and helped convince the previously skeptical president to enter World War I. Churchill spent much time and effort cultivating the relationship, which paid dividends for the war effort. Two great architects of the Special Relationship on a practical level were Field Marshal Sir John Dill and General George Marshall, whose excellent personal relations and senior positions (Roosevelt was especially close to Marshall) oiled the wheels of the alliance considerably. Major links were created during the war, such as the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Britain, previously somewhat the senior partner, had found herself the junior beginning in 1941. The diplomatic policy was thus two-pronged, encompassing strong personal support and equally forthright military and political aid. These two have always operated in tandem; that is to say, the best personal relationships between British prime ministers and American presidents have always been those based around shared goals. For example, Harold Wilson's government would not commit troops to Vietnam, and Wilson and Lyndon Johnson did not get on especially well. Peaks in the Special Relationship include the bonds between Harold Macmillan (who like Churchill had an American mother) and John F. Kennedy; between James Callaghan and Jimmy Carter, who were close personal friends despite their differences in personality; between Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan; and more recently between Tony Blair and both Bill Clinton and George W.

Immediately at the start of Churchill's premiership, the Battle of Dunkirk took place. Before Churchill's premiership, President Roosevelt had secretively been in frequent correspondence with him. Their correspondence had begun in September 1939, at the very start of World War II. In these private communications, the two had been discussing ways in which the US might support Britain in their war effort.Warren F. Kimball, ed. Churchill and Roosevelt, The Complete Correspondence (3 vol Princeton UP, 1984). However, at the time when Winston Churchill assumed the office of Prime Minister, Roosevelt was nearing the end of his second term and making considerations of seeking election to an unprecedented third term (he would make no public pronouncements about this until the Democratic National Convention that year). From the American experience during the First World War, Roosevelt judged that involvement in the Second World War was likely to be an inevitability. This was a key reason for Roosevelt's decision to break from tradition and seek a third term. Roosevelt desired to be president when the US would finally be drawn into entering the conflict. However, in order to win a third term, Roosevelt made the American people promises that he would keep them out of the war. In November 1940, upon Roosevelt's victory in the presidential election, Churchill sent him a congratulatory letter, Having promised the American public to avoid entering any foreign war, Roosevelt went as far as public opinion allowed in providing financial and military aid to Britain, France and China. In a December 1940 talk, dubbed the Arsenal of Democracy Speech, Roosevelt declared, \\"This is not a fireside chat on war. It is a talk about national security\\". He went on to declare the importance of American support of Britain's war effort, framing it as a matter of national security for the U.S. As the American public opposed involvement in the conflict, Roosevelt sought to emphasize that it was critical to assist the British in order to prevent the conflict from reaching American shores. He aimed to paint the British war effort as beneficial to the US by arguing that they would contain the Nazi threat from spreading across the Atlantic. Churchill's edited copy of the final draft of the Atlantic Charter To assist the British war effort, Roosevelt enacted the Lend-Lease policy and drafted the Atlantic Charter with Churchill. The US ultimately joined the war effort in December 1941, under Roosevelt's leadership.\\"A Chronology of US Historical Documents\\". Oklahoma College of Law Roosevelt and Churchill had a relative fondness of one another. They connected on their shared passions for tobacco and liquors, and their mutual interest in history and battleships. Churchill later wrote, \\"I felt I was in contact with a very great man, who was also a warm-hearted friend, and the foremost champion of the high causes which we served.\\" One anecdote that has been told to illustrate the intimacy of Churchill and Roosevelt's bond alleges that once, while hosting Churchill at the White House, Roosevelt stopped by the bedroom in which the Prime Minister was staying to converse with him. Churchill answered his door in a state of nudity, remarking, \\"You see, Mr. President, I have nothing to hide from you.\\" The president is said to have taken this in good humor, later joking with an aide that Churchill was, \\"pink and white all over.\\" Between 1939 and 1945, Roosevelt and Churchill exchanged an estimated 1700 letters and telegrams and met with one another 11 times. On Churchill's 60th birthday, Roosevelt wrote him, \\"It is fun to be in the same decade as you.\\" Beginning under Roosevelt and Churchill, the U.S. and U.K. worked together closely to establish the IMF, World Bank and NATO. =Churchill and Truman (April ‚Äì July 1945)= 1945 election). Roosevelt died in April 1945, shortly into his fourth term in office, and was succeeded by his vice president, Harry Truman. Churchill and Truman likewise developed a strong relationship with one another. While he was saddened by the death of Roosevelt, Churchill was a strong supporter of Truman in his early presidency, calling him, \\"the type of leader the world needs when it needs him most.\\" At the Potsdam Conference, Truman and Churchill, along with Joseph Stalin, made agreements for settling the boundaries of Europe.Jenkins, Roy. Churchill: A Biography (2001); p. 849 / =Attlee and Truman (July 1945 ‚Äì October 1951)= Truman meeting with Attlee during the Potsdam Conference Four months into Truman's presidency, Churchill's party was handed a surprise defeat at the polls, and Clement Attlee became Prime Minister. The deputy in Churchill's wartime coalition government, Attlee had been in the US at the time of Roosevelt's death, and thus had met with Truman immediately after he took office. The two of them had come to like one another. However, Attlee and Truman never became particularly close with one another. During their coinciding tenure as heads of government, they only met on three occasions. The two did not maintain regular correspondence. Their working relationship with each other, nonetheless, remained sturdy. When Attlee assumed the position of Prime Minister, negotiations had not yet been completed at the Potsdam Conference, which had begun on 17 July. Attlee took Churchill's place at the conference once he was named Prime Minister on 26 July. Therefore, Attlee's first sixteen days as Prime Minister were spent handling negotiations at the conference. Attlee flew to Washington in December 1950 to support Truman in standing up against Douglas MacArthur. In 1951, Truman pressured Attlee not to intervene against Mossadeq in Iran. In his time as Prime Minister, Attlee also managed to convince Truman to agree to greater nuclear cooperation. =Churchill and Truman (October 1951 ‚Äì January 1953)= Blair House in 1949 Churchill became Prime Minister again in October 1951. He had maintained his relationship with Truman during his six-year stint as Leader of the Opposition. In 1946, on invitation from Truman, Churchill visited the U.S. to deliver a speech at Westminster College in Truman's home state of Missouri. The speech, which would be remembered as the \\"Iron Curtain\\" speech, affected greater public attention to the schism that had developed between the Soviet Union and the rest of the Allied Powers. During this trip, Churchill lost a significant amount of cash in a poker game with Harry Truman and his advisors.; retrieved 23 March 2009. In 1947, Churchill had written Truman an unheeded memo recommending that the US make a pre-emptive atomic bomb strike on Moscow before the Soviet Union could acquire nuclear weapons themselves.Kevin Ruane, Churchill and the Bomb in War and Cold War (2016) p. 156. Churchill and Eden visited Washington in January 1952. At the time, Truman's administration was supporting plans for a European Defence Community in hopes that it would allow West Germany to undergo rearmament, consequentially enabling the U.S. to decrease the number of American troops stationed in Germany. Churchill opposed the EDC, feeling that it could not work. He also asked, unsuccessfully, for the US to commit its forces to supporting Britain in Egypt and the Middle East. This had no appeal for Truman. Truman expected the British to assist the Americans in their fight against communist forces in Korea, but felt that supporting the British in the Middle East would be assisting them in their imperialist efforts, which would do nothing to thwart communism. Truman opted not to seek re-election in 1952, and his presidency ended in January 1953. =Churchill and Eisenhower (January 1953 ‚Äì April 1955)= Eisenhower (center) sits between Churchill (left) and Bernard Montgomery at a NATO conference in October 1951. Eisenhower would be elected president just over a year later. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Churchill were both familiar with one another, as they had both been significant leaders of the Allied effort during World War II. Relations were strained, however, by Eisenhower's outrage over Churchill's half-baked attempt to set up a \\"parley at the summit\\" with Joseph Stalin. =Eden and Eisenhower (April 1955 ‚Äì January 1957)= Similarly to his predecessor, Eden had worked closely with Eisenhower during World War II. Suez Crisis When Eden took office, Gamal Abdel Nasser built up Egyptian nationalism and threatened to take control of the vital Suez Canal. Eden in 1956 made a secret agreement with France and Israel to seize control of the canal. Eisenhower had repeatedly warned Eden that the US would not accept British military intervention. When the invasion came anyway, the US denounced it at the United Nations, and used financial power to force the British to completely withdraw. Britain lost its prestige and its powerful role in Mid-Eastern affairs, to be replaced by the Americans. Eden, in poor health, was forced to retire.Keith Kyle, Suez: Britain's End of Empire in the Middle East (2003).C.C. Kingseed, Eisenhower and the Suez Crisis of 1956 (1995).Simon C. Smith, ed. Reassessing Suez 1956: New perspectives on the crisis and its aftermath (Routledge, 2016). =Macmillan and Eisenhower (January 1957 ‚Äì January 1961)= Macmillan and Eisenhower meet in March 1957 for talks in Bermuda, aiming to repair Anglo- American relationships in the aftermath of the previous year's Suez Crisis. Once he took office, Macmillan worked to undo the strain that the Special Relationship had incurred in the preceding years. Macmillan famously quipped that it was Britain's historical duty to guide the power of the US as the ancient Greeks had the Romans.Alistair Horne, Macmillan, 1894‚Äì1956: Volume I of the Official Biography (London: Macmillan, 1988), p. 160. He endeavoured to broaden the Special Relationship beyond Churchill's conception of an English- Speaking Union into a more inclusive \\"Atlantic Community\\".Christopher Coker, 'Britain and the New World Order: The Special Relationship in the 1990s', International Affairs, Vol. 68, No. 3 (Jul. 1992), p. 408. His key theme, \\"of the interdependence of the nations of the Free World and the partnership which must be maintained between Europe and the United States\\", was one that Kennedy subsequently took up.Harold Macmillan, At the End of the Day (London: Macmillan, 1973), p. 111. However, Eisenhower increased tension with the UK by sabotaging Macmillan's policy of d√©tente with the Soviet Union at the May 1960 Paris summit.Nigel J. Ashton, 'Harold Macmillan and the \\"Golden Days\\" of Anglo-American Relations Revisited', Diplomatic History, Vol. 29, No. 4 (2005), pp. 696, 704. =Macmillan and Kennedy (January 1961 ‚Äì October 1963)= Macmillan and Kennedy at Key West in 1961 Kennedy was an anglophile.Christopher Sandford, Harold and Jack: The Remarkable Friendship of Prime Minister Macmillan and President Kennedy (Prometheus Books, 2014) His father had previously served as the US ambassador to the UK and his sister had been Marchioness of Hartington, whose husband was incidentally Macmillan's nephew by marriage. British intelligence assisted the US in assessing the Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy appreciated Macmillan's steady leadership, and admired his Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. Skybolt crisis The Special Relationship was perhaps tested the most severely by the Skybolt crisis of 1962, when Kennedy cancelled a joint project without consultation. Skybolt was a nuclear air-to-ground missile that could penetrate Soviet airspace and would extend the life of Britain's deterrent, which consisted only of free-falling hydrogen bombs. London saw cancellation as a reduction in the British nuclear deterrent. The crisis was resolved during a series of compromises that led to the Royal Navy purchasing the American UGM-27 Polaris missile and construction of the Resolution-class submarines to launch them.Ken Young, \\"The Skybolt Crisis of 1962: Muddle or Mischief?\\", Journal of Strategic Studies 27.4 (2004): 614-635.Myron A. Greenberg, 'Kennedy's Choice: The Skybolt Crisis Revisited', Naval War College Review, Autumn 2000.Richard E. Neustadt, Report to JFK: The Skybolt Crisis in Perspective (1999)Horne, Macmillan: Volume II, pp. 433‚Äì37. The debates over Skybolt were top secret, but tensions were exacerbated when Dean Acheson, a former Secretary of State, challenged publicly the Special Relationship and marginalised the British contribution to the Western alliance. Acheson said: A British UGM-27 Polaris missile at the Imperial War Museum in London On learning of Acheson's attack, Macmillan thundered in public: The looming collapse of the alliance between the two thermonuclear powers forced Kennedy into an about-face at the Anglo- American summit in Nassau, where he agreed to sell Polaris as a replacement for the cancelled Skybolt. Richard E. Neustadt in his official investigation concluded the crisis in the Special Relationship had erupted because \\"the president's 'Chiefs' failed to make a proper strategic assessment of Great Britain's intentions and its capabilities\\".Greenberg, 'Kennedy's Choice'. The Skybolt crisis with Kennedy came on top of Eisenhower's wrecking of Macmillan's policy of d√©tente with the Soviet Union at the May 1960 Paris summit, and the prime minister's resulting disenchantment with the Special Relationship contributed to his decision to seek an alternative in British membership of the European Economic Community (EEC). According to a recent analyst: \\"What the prime minister in effect adopted was a hedging strategy in which ties with Washington would be maintained while at the same time a new power base in Europe was sought.\\"Ashton, Anglo-American Relations Revisited, p. 705. Even so, Kennedy assured Macmillan \\"that relations between the United States and the UK would be strengthened not weakened, if the UK moved towards membership.\\"David Reynolds, \\"A 'Special Relationship'? America, Britain and the International Order Since the Second World War\\", International Affairs, Vol. 62, No. 1 (Winter, 1985‚Äì1986), p. 14. =Douglas-Home and Kennedy (October ‚Äì November 1963)= Kennedy hosts (then-Foreign Secretary) Douglas- Home at the White House in 1962 Jacqueline and his brother Ted at a reception in the White House Cross Hall following Kennedy's state funeral. Alec Douglas-Home only entered the race to replace the resigning Macmillan as Leader of the Conservative Party after learning from the British ambassador to the US that the Kennedy administration was uneasy at the prospect of Quintin Hogg being Prime Minister. Douglas-Home, however, would only serve as Prime Minister for a little over a month before Kennedy was assassinated. In England, Kennedy's assassination in November 1963 caused a profound shock and sadness expressed by many politicians, religious leaders, and luminaries of literature and the arts. The Archbishop of Canterbury led a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral. Sir Laurence Olivier at the end of his next performance called for a moment of silence, followed by a playing of \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\". Prime Minister Douglas-Home led parliamentary tributes to Kennedy, whom he called, \\"the most loyal and faithful of allies.\\"Robert Cook and Clive Webb. \\"Unraveling the special relationship: British responses to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.\\" The Sixties 8#2 (2015): 179‚Äì194, quote p . Douglas-Home was visibly upset during his remarks, as he was truly saddened by Kennedy's death. He had liked Kennedy, and had begun to establish a positive working relationship with him.\\"Carried the hopes of the world\\", The Guardian, 23 November 1963, p. 3 After his assassination, the British government sought approval to build a memorial to President Kennedy, in part to demonstrate the strength of the Special Relationship. However, the weak popular response to its ambitious fundraising campaign was a surprise, and suggested a grassroots opposition to the late president, his policies and the US. =Douglas-Home and Johnson (November 1963 ‚Äì October 1964)= Blue Room of the White House Douglas-Home had a far more terse relationship with Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson. Douglas-Home failed to develop a good relationship with Lyndon Johnson. Their governments had a serious disagreement on the question of British trade with Cuba.Hurd, Douglas \\"Home, Alexander Frederick Douglas-, fourteenth earl of Home and Baron Home of the Hirsel (1903‚Äì1995)\\",Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 14 April 2012 Relations between the two nations worsened after British Leyland busses were sold to Cuba, thus undermining the effectiveness of the United States embargo against Cuba. Douglas-Home's Conservative Party lost the 1964 general election, thus he lost his position as Prime Minister. He had only served as Prime Minister for 363 days, the U.K.'s second shortest premiership of the twentieth century. Despite its unusual brevity (and due to the assassination of Kennedy), Douglas-Home's tenure had overlapped with two US presidencies. =Wilson and Johnson (October 1964 ‚Äì January 1969)= Wilson and Johnson meet at the White House in 1966 Prime Minister Harold Wilson recast the alliance as a \\"close relationship\\",Reynolds, \\"A 'Special Relationship'?\\", p. 1. but neither he nor President Lyndon B.

However, relations were sustained by U.S. recognition that Wilson was being criticised at home by his neutralist Labour left for not condemning American involvement in the war.O'Hara, Review, p. 482.Ashton, Anglo-American Relations Revisited, p. 694. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara asked Britain to send troops to Vietnam as \\"the unwritten terms of the Special Relationship\\",Ben Macintyre, \\"Blair's real special relationship is with us, not the US\\", The Times (7 September 2002), p. 22. Wilson agreed to help in many ways but refused to commit regular forces, only special forces instructors.

The United Kingdom's subsequent withdrawal from the Persian Gulf and East Asia surprised Washington, where it was strongly opposed because British forces were valued for their contribution.Reynolds, pp. 14‚Äì15. In retrospect Wilson's moves to scale back Britain's global commitments and correct its balance of payments contrasted with Johnson's overexertions which accelerated the relative economic and military decline of the US. =Wilson and Nixon (January 1969 ‚Äì June 1970)= Wilson visiting the White House in January 1970 By the time Richard Nixon had taken office, many issues of tension between the two nations had been resolved. This allowed for the Special Relationship to blossom. In a speech delivered on 27 January 1970 at a state dinner welcoming the Prime Minister in his visit to the US Nixon said, =Heath and Nixon (June 1970 ‚Äì March 1974)= Prime Minister Edward Heath and Queen Elizabeth II with President Richard M.

A12. The Heath‚ÄìNixon era was dominated by the United Kingdom's 1973 entry into the European Economic Community (EEC). Although the two leaders' 1971 Bermuda communiqu√© restated that entry served the interests of the Atlantic Alliance, American observers voiced concern that the British government's membership would impair its role as an honest broker, and that, because of the European goal of political union, the Special Relationship would only survive if it included the whole Community.Editorial, The New York Times (24 December 1971), p. 24, col. 1. Critics accused President Nixon of impeding the EEC's inclusion in the Special Relationship by his economic policy,The New York Times (24 December 1971). which dismantled the postwar international monetary system and sought to force open European markets for US exports.Allen J. Matusow, 'Richard Nixon and the Failed War Against the Trading World', Diplomatic History, vol. 7, no. 5 (November 2003), pp. 767‚Äì8. Detractors also slated the personal relationship at the top as \\"decidedly less than special\\"; Prime Minister Edward Heath, it was alleged, \\"hardly dared put through a phone call to Richard Nixon for fear of offending his new Common Market partners.\\"Henrik Bering-Jensen, \\"Hawks of a Feather\\", Washington Times (8 April 1991), p. 2. The Special Relationship was \\"soured\\" during the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War of 1973 when Nixon failed to inform Heath that US forces had been put on DEFCON 3 in a worldwide standoff with the Soviet Union, and US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger misled the British ambassador over the nuclear alert.Paul Reynolds, UK in dark over 1973 nuclear alert, BBC News (2 January 2004). Retrieved 16 March 2009. Heath, who learned about the alert only from press reports hours later, confessed: \\"I have found considerable alarm as to what use the Americans would have been able to make of their forces here without in any way consulting us or considering the British interests.\\"\\"America 'misled Britain' in Cold War; National archives: 1973\\", The Times (1 January 2004), p. 10.

Wilson held Nixon in high regards. After he left office himself, Wilson praised Nixon as America's \\"most able\\" president. =Wilson and Ford (August 1974 ‚Äì April 1976)= Wilson and Ford in the White House Rose Garden in January 1975 Gerald Ford became president after Nixon's resignation. In a toast to Wilson at a January 1975 state dinner, Ford remarked, =Callaghan and Ford (April 1976 ‚Äì January 1977)= Callaghan and Ford sitting at the Oval Office fireplace In April 1976, James Callaghan became Prime Minister after Wilson resigned the office. While President Ford never visited the United Kingdom during his presidency,'Thatcher Hero and the Leader of Free World Basks in Glory', The Guardian (25 November 1995), p. 8. the British government saw the U.S. bicentennial in 1976 as an occasion to celebrate the Special Relationship. Political leaders and guests from both sides of the Atlantic gathered in May at Westminster Hall to mark the American Declaration of Independence of 1776. Prime Minister Callaghan presented a visiting Congressional delegation with a gold-embossed reproduction of Magna Carta, symbolising the common heritage of the two nations. British historian Esmond Wright noted \\"a vast amount of popular identification with the American story\\". A year of cultural exchanges and exhibitions culminated in July in a state visit to the United States by the Queen.Robert B. Semple, Jr, \\"British Government Puts on its Biggest Single Show of Year to Mark Declaration of Independence\\", The New York Times (27 May 1976), p. 1, col. 2. Ford lost the 1976 election. Consequentially, his presidency ended in January 1977. =Callaghan and Carter (January 1977 ‚Äì May 1979)= President Jimmy Carter (left) and Prime Minister James Callaghan (right) in the Oval Office in March 1978 After defeating the incumbent Gerald Ford in the 1976 election, Jimmy Carter was sworn in as President of the United States in January 1977. Ties between Callaghan and Carter were cordial but, with both left of centre governments being preoccupied with economic malaise, diplomatic contacts remained low key. US officials characterised relations in 1978 as \\"extremely good\\", with the main disagreement being over trans-Atlantic air routes.'Callaghan set to see Carter about recession', Globe and Mail (16 March 1978), p. 12. The economic malaise that Callaghan was facing at home developed into the \\"Winter of Discontent\\", which ultimately led to Callaghan's Labour Party losing the May 1979 general election, thus ending his tenure as Prime Minister. =Thatcher and Carter (May 1979 ‚Äì January 1981)= Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter hosting a state dinner for Margaret Thatcher at the White House during her 1979 visit to the United States Conservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister after her party won the general election in 1979. Relations between President Carter and Prime Minister Thatcher during the year-and-a-half overlap of their leadership have often been seen as relatively cold, especially when contrasted with the kinship that Thatcher would subsequently develop with Carter's successor Ronald Reagan. However, Carter's relationship with Thatcher never reached the levels of strain that Reagan's relationship would in the midst of the Falklands War. Thatcher and Carter had clear differences in their political ideology. They both occupied relatively opposing ends of the political spectrum. By the time she had become Prime Minister, Thatcher had already met Carter on two previous occasions. Both of these encounters had initially left Carter with a negative impression of her. However, his opinion of Thatcher had reportedly become more placid by the time she was elected Prime Minister. Despite the tensions between the two, historian Chris Collins (of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation) has stated, \\"Carter is somebody she worked hard to get along with. She had considerable success at it. Had Carter lasted two terms we might be writing about the surprising amount of common ground between the two.\\" Carter congratulated Thatcher in a phone call after her party's victory in the general election (which elevated her to the office of Prime Minister), stating that the United States would, \\"look forward to working with you on an official basis.\\" However, his congratulations was delivered with an audibly unenthusiastic tone. In her first full letter to Carter, Thatcher voiced her assurance of full support in the ratification of the SALT II nuclear arms treaty writing, \\"We will do all we can to assist you\\". Shortly after her election, following her first meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin (which she would describe as, \\"profoundly disheartening\\"), Thatcher expressed her concerns to Carter about the issue of Israeli settlements stating, \\"I emphasized to Mr. Begin the danger which continued expansion of Israeli settlements represents to the autonomy negotiations‚Ä¶ but he will not listen and even resents the subject of settlements being raised at all.\\" Both leaders were mutually facing great pressures during the overlap of their tenures as a national leader. Both of their nations were experiencing economic crisis due to the early 1980s recession. In addition, there was international upheaval in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Among the areas of turmoil were Afghanistan (due to the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War) and Iran (where Carter was facing a hostage crisis following the Iranian Revolution).Records of the Prime Minister's Office, Correspondence & Papers; 1979‚Äì1997 at discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk: IRAN.

Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, Part 4, Part 5, Part 6, Part 7; access date=11 June 2017 Carter with Thatcher having tea at the White House during her 1979 visit to the United States Both Carter and Thatcher condemned the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. They expressed concern to each other that other European nations were being too soft towards the Russians. Carter hoped that she could persuade other European nations to condemn the invasion. However, with a particularly tumultuous economic situation at home, and with most NATO members reluctant to cut trade ties with the USSR, Thatcher would only provide very weak support to Carter's efforts to punish the USSR through economic sanctions.Daniel James Lahey, \\"The Thatcher government's response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, 1979‚Äì1980\\", Cold War History (2013) 13#1 pp. 21‚Äì42. Thatcher was concerned that Carter was naive about Soviet relations. Nevertheless, Thatcher played a (perhaps pivotal) role in fulfilling Carter's desire for the U.N. adoption of a resolution demanding the withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Thatcher also encouraged British athletes to participate in the boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which Carter initiated in response to the invasion. However, Thatcher ultimately gave the country's Olympic Committee and individual athletes the choice to decide whether or not they would boycott the games. The United Kingdom ended up participating in the 1980 games, albeit with a smaller delegation due to individual athletes deciding to participate in boycotting the games. In their correspondences, Thatcher expressed sympathy to Carter's troubled efforts to resolve the hostage crisis in Iran. However, she outright refused his request for her to decrease the presence of the British embassy in Iran. Thatcher provided Carter with praise on his handling of the US economy, sending him a letter endorsing his measures in handling economic inflation and in cutting gas consumption during the 1979 energy crisis as, \\"painful but necessary\\". In October 1979 Thatcher wrote Carter, \\"I share your concern about Cuban and Soviet intentions in the Caribbean. This danger exists more widely in the developing world. It is essential that the Soviet Union should recognise your resolve in this matter. [‚Ä¶] I am therefore especially encouraged by your statement that you are accelerating efforts to increase the capability of the United States to use its military forces world wide.\\" Also October 1979 there was a dispute over Thatcher's government's provision of funding for BBC's external services. In desperation, the BBC contacted United States Ambassador Kingman Brewster Jr. to request that the US government endorse them in their fight against spending cuts. National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski discussed this request with the State Department, and even drafted a letter for Carter to send Thatcher. However, Brzezinski ultimately decided against advising Carter to involve himself in the BBC's efforts to lobby against budget cuts. During her December 1979 visit to the United States, Thatcher chastised Carter for not permitting the sale of arsenal to equip the Royal Ulster Constabulary. During this visit, she delivered a speech in which a lack of warmth towards Carter was evident. While Thatcher likely favoured her ideological counterpart Ronald Reagan to win the 1980 election (in which he defeated Carter), she was cautious to avoid voicing any such preference, even in private. =Thatcher and Reagan (January 1981 ‚Äì January 1989)= President Ronald Reagan (left) and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (right) in Bonn, May 1985 The personal friendship between President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher united them as \\"ideological soul- mates\\". They shared a commitment to the philosophy of the free market, low taxes, limited government, and a strong defence; they rejected d√©tente and were determined to win the Cold War with the Soviet Union. However, they did have disagreements on internal social policies such as the AIDS epidemic and abortion.Geoffrey Smith, Reagan and Thatcher (Vintage, 1990).Anthony Andrew Clark, \\"Were Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan Inseparable Political Allies?.\\" History in the Making 2#2 (2013): 21‚Äì29. Thatcher summed up her understanding of the Special Relationship at her first meeting with Reagan as president in 1981: \\"Your problems will be our problems and when you look for friends we shall be there.\\" Celebrating the 200th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 1985, Thatcher enthused: Reagan, in turn, acknowledged: In 1982, Thatcher and Reagan reached an agreement to replace the British Polaris fleet with a force equipped with US-supplied Trident missiles. The confidence between the two principals appeared momentarily strained by Reagan's belated support in the Falklands War, but this was more than countered by the Anglophile American Defense Secretary, Caspar Weinberger, who provided strong support in intelligence and munitions. It has since been revealed that while publicly claiming neutrality in the dispute between Argentina and Britain over the Falkland Islands, Reagan had approved a top-secret plan to loan a U.S. aircraft carrier to the British in the event that Argentine forces managed to sink one of the British carriers, and had told Weinberger to: \\"Give Maggie everything she needs to get on with it.\\" A July 2012 article by USNI News of the United States Naval Institute revealed that the Reagan Administration offered the use of the USS Iwo Jima as a replacement in case either of the two British carriers, and , had been damaged or destroyed during the 1982 Falklands War. This top-secret contingency plan was revealed to the staff of the Naval Institute by John Lehman, the U.S. Secretary of the Navy at the time of the Falklands War, from a speech provided to the Naval Institute that Lehman made in Portsmouth, UK on 26 June 2012. Lehman stated that the loan of Iwo Jima was made in response to a request from the Royal Navy, and it had the endorsement of U.S. President Ronald Reagan and U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. The actual planning for the loan of Iwo Jima was done by the staff of the U.S. Second Fleet under the direction of Vice Admiral James Lyons, who confirmed Lehman's revelations with the Naval Institute staff. Contingency planning envisioned American military contractors, likely retired sailors with knowledge of Iwo Jimas systems, assisting the British in manning the U.S. helicopter carrier during the loan-out. Naval analyst Eric Wertheim compared this arrangement to the Flying Tigers. Significantly, except for U.S. Secretary of State Alexander Haig, the U.S. Department of State was not included in the loan-out negotiations. An American F-111F takes off from RAF Lakenheath to conduct an airstrike in Libya on 15 April 1986. In 1986 Washington asked permission to use British airbases in order to bomb Libya in retaliation for the 1986 West Berlin discotheque bombing by Libyan terrorists that killed two U.S. servicemen. The British cabinet was opposed and Thatcher herself was worried it would lead to widespread attacks on British interests in the Middle East. That did not happen, and instead Libyan terrorism fell off sharply. Furthermore, although British public opinion was highly negative, Britain won widespread praise in the United States at a time when Spain and France had vetoed American requests to fly over their territories.John Campbell, Margaret Thatcher: The Iron Lady vol. 2 (2003) pp. 279‚Äì82. online A more serious disagreement came in 1983 when Washington did not consult with London on the invasion of Grenada.Gary Williams, \\"'A Matter of Regret': Britain, the 1983 Grendada Crisis, and the Special Relationship\\", Twentieth Century British History 12#2 (2001): 208‚Äì230. Grenada is part of the Commonwealth of Nations and, following the invasion, it requested help from other Commonwealth members. The intervention was opposed by Commonwealth members including the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, and Canada, among others. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a close ally of Reagan on other matters, personally opposed the U.S. invasion. Reagan told her it might happen; she did not know for sure it was coming until three hours before. At 12:30 on the morning of the invasion, Thatcher sent a message to Reagan: Reagan told Thatcher before anyone else that the invasion would begin in a few hours, but ignored her complaints. She publicly supported the U.S. action. Reagan phoned to apologize for the miscommunication, and the long-term friendly relationship endured.John Campbell, Margaret Thatcher Volume Two: The Iron Lady (2011) pp. 273‚Äì79.Gary Williams, \\"'A Matter of Regret': Britain, the 1983 Grenada Crisis, and the Special Relationship\\", Twentieth Century British History 12#2 (2001): 208‚Äì30. In 1986, the British defence secretary Michael Heseltine, a prominent critic of the Special Relationship and a supporter of European integration, resigned over his concern that a takeover of Britain's last helicopter manufacturer by a US firm would harm the British defence industry.John Dumbrell, A Special Relationship: Anglo-American Relations in the Cold War and After (Basingstoke, Hants: Macmillan, 2001), pp. 97‚Äì99. Thatcher herself also saw a potential risk to Britain's deterrent and security posed by the Strategic Defense InitiativeMargaret Thatcher, The Downing Street Years, (London: HarperCollins, 1993), pp. 465‚Äì6. She was alarmed at Reagan's proposal at the Reykjav√≠k Summit to eliminate nuclear weapons, but was relieved when the proposal failed. All in all, Britain's needs figured more prominently in American thinking strategy than anyone else.Coker, 'Britain and the New World Order', p. 408. Peter Hennessy, a leading historian, singles out the personal dynamic of \\"Ron\\" and \\"Margaret\\" in this success: =Thatcher and George H. W. Bush (January 1989 ‚Äì November 1990)= Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President George H. W. Bush in London, June 1989 In his personal diary, George H. W. Bush wrote that his first impression of Thatcher was she was principled but very difficult. Bush also wrote that Thatcher, \\"talks all the time when you're in a conversation. It's a one-way street.\\" Despite having developed a warm relation with Reagan, whom Bush had served under as vice president, Thatcher never developed a similar sense of camaraderie with Bush. At the time that Bush took office in 1989, Thatcher was politically under siege from both her political opposition and forces within her own party. Bush was anxious to manage the collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe in a manner that would produce order and stability. Bush therefore used a 1989 trip to Brussels to demonstrate the heightened attention that his administration planned to allocate towards US‚ÄìGerman relations. Thus, rather than giving Thatcher the precedence which Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom were accustomed to receiving from US Presidents, he met with the president of the European Commission first, leaving Thatcher, \\"cooling her heels\\". This irritated Thatcher. In 1989, after Bush proposed a reduction in US troops stationed in Europe, Thatcher lectured Bush on the importance of freedom. Bush came out of this encounter asking, \\"Why does she have any doubt that we feel this way on this issue?\\" In the midst of the invasion of Kuwait, Thatcher advised Bush that, \\"this is no time to go wobbly.\\" Thatcher lost her premiership in November 1990. However, to Bush's displeasure, she continued attempting to involve herself in diplomacy between the West and the Soviet Union. Bush took particular offence to a speech Thatcher gave after leaving office in which she said that she and Ronald Reagan were responsible for ending the Cold War. Thatcher gave this speech, which snubbed the contributions that others had made, before an audience that included a number of individuals who had contributed to the ending the Cold War, such as Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa and V√°clav Havel. In reaction to this speech, Helmut Kohl sent Bush a note proclaiming that Thatcher was crazy. =Major and George H. W.

Bush (right) at Camp David in June 1992 As had started becoming apparent in Thatcher's last few years of premiership, the Special Relationship had begun to wane for a time with the passing of the Cold War, despite intensive co-operation in the Gulf War. Thus, while it remained the case that \\"On almost all issues, Britain and the US are on the same side of the table. You cannot say that for other important allies such as France, Germany or Japan\\",Martin Fletcher and Michael Binyon, 'Special Relationship Struggles to Bridge the Generation Gap‚ÄîAnglo-American', The Times (22 December 1993). it was also acknowledged that \\"The disappearance of a powerful common threat, the Soviet Union, has allowed narrower disputes to emerge and given them greater weight.\\"\\"British-American Strains\\", The New York Times (25 March 1995), p. 22. =Major and Clinton (January 1993 ‚Äì May 1997)= President Bill Clinton (left) and Prime Minister John Major (right) hold a working breakfast at the White House in 1994. Republican administrations had typically worked well with Conservative governments, and the new Democratic President Bill Clinton intended to maintain the Special Relationship. But he and Major did not prove compatible. The nuclear alliance was weakened when Clinton extended a moratorium on tests in the Nevada desert in 1993, and pressed Major to agree to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.Martin Walker, 'President puts Britain's deterrent in melting pot', The Guardian (24 February 1993), p. 1. The freeze was described by a British defence minister as \\"unfortunate and misguided\\", as it inhibited validation of the \\"safety, reliability and effectiveness\\" of fail-safe mechanisms on upgraded warheads for the British Trident II D5 missiles, and potentially the development of a new deterrent for the 21st century, leading Major to consider a return to Pacific Ocean testing.Graham Barrett, 'UK Eyes Nuclear Testing In Pacific', The Age (5 July 1993), p. 8.

US Secretary of State Warren Christopher's campaign to lift the embargo was rebuffed by Major and President Mitterrand in May 1993. After the so-called 'Copenhagen ambush' in June 1993, where Clinton \\"ganged up\\" with Chancellor Kohl to rally the European Community against the peacekeeping states, Major was said to be contemplating the death of the Special Relationship. The following month the United States voted at the UN with non-aligned countries against Britain and France over lifting the embargo.Robi Dutta, \\"Bridging Troubled Waters ‚Äì Chronology ‚Äì US Foreign Policy\\", The Times (19 October 1993). By October 1993, Warren Christopher was bristling that Washington policy makers had been too \\"Eurocentric\\", and declared that Western Europe was \\"no longer the dominant area of the world\\". The U.S. ambassador to London, Raymond G.H. Seitz, demurred, insisting it was far too early to put a \\"tombstone\\" over the Special Relationship. A senior U.S. State Department official described Bosnia in the spring of 1995 as the worst crisis with the British and French since Suez.Walker, \\"Why Bill Won't Give Up His Respect for Major\\", p. 21. By the summer, U.S. officials were doubting whether NATO had a future. The nadir had now been reached, and, along with NATO enlargement and the Croatian offensive in 1995 that opened the way for NATO bombing, the strengthening Clinton‚ÄìMajor relationship was later credited as one of three developments that saved the Western alliance. The president later acknowledged, A rift opened in a further area. In February 1994, Major refused to answer Clinton's telephone calls for days over his decision to grant Sinn F√©in leader Gerry Adams a visa to visit the United States to agitate. Adams was listed as a terrorist by London.Villa, \\"The Reagan‚ÄìThatcher 'special relationship' has not weathered the years\\".

To the disappointment of the prime minister, Clinton lifted the ban on official contacts and received Adams at the White House on St. Patrick's Day 1995, despite the fact the paramilitaries had not agreed to disarm. The rows over Northern Ireland and the Adams affair reportedly \\"provoked incandescent Clintonian rages\\". In November 1995, Clinton became only the second US president ever to address both Houses of Parliament, but, by the end of Major's premiership, disenchantment with the Special Relationship had deepened to the point where the incoming British ambassador Christopher Meyer banned the \\"hackneyed phrase\\" from the embassy.Walker, \\"Why Bill Won't Give Up His Respect for Major\\", p. 21Jasper Gerar, Ultimate insider prowls into the outside world, The Sunday Times (1 June 2003).

Despite their political differences on non-strategic matters, their shared beliefs and responses to the international situation formed a commonality of purpose following the September 11 attacks in New York and Washington, D.C. Blair, like Bush, was convinced of the importance of moving against the perceived threat to world peace and international order, famously pledging to stand \\"shoulder to shoulder\\" with Bush: Blair flew to Washington immediately after 9/11 to affirm British solidarity with the United States.

On 20 July, Cameron met with Obama during his first visit to the United States as prime minister. The two expressed unity in a wide range of issues, including the war in Afghanistan. During the meeting, Obama stated, \\"We can never say it enough.

Obama maintained his stance that the UK would be a low priority for US trade talks post-Brexit, and that the UK would be at \\"the back of the queue\\". May chose Boris Johnson to serve as her Foreign Secretary. Johnson had written an op-ed which made mention of Obama's Kenyan heritage in a manner which critics accused of being racist. He had also previously written an op-ed about Hillary Clinton which made derisive statements that had been criticized as sexist. By the time May appointed Johnson, Clinton was the Democratic Party's presumptive nominee in the election to elect Obama's successor, and thus had a significant chance of being the next US president. A senior official in the US government suggested that Johnson's appointment would push the US further towards ties with Germany at the expense of the Special Relationship with the UK. Ultimately, before he left office, Obama stated that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been his \\"closest international partner\\" throughout his tenure as president. While Obama might have had a distant relationship with Prime Minister May, he reportedly maintained a strong cordial relationship with members of the British royal family. =May and Trump (January 2017 ‚Äì July 2019)= May was the first foreign leader to visit Trump following his inauguration. Following the election of Donald Trump, the British government has sought to establish a close alliance with the Trump administration. May's efforts to closely associate herself with Trump proved to be strongly controversial in the United Kingdom. May was the first world leader to meet with Trump following his inauguration. May's supporters described her visit as a bid to reaffirm the historical \\"special relationship\\" between the two countries. The meeting took place at the White House and lasted about an hour. May was criticized in the UK by members of all major parties, including her own, for refusing to condemn Trump's \\"Muslim ban\\" executive order. as well as for her invitation to Trump, extended in 2017, for a state visit with Queen Elizabeth II. An invitation for a state visit had not traditionally been extended so early in a presidency, however May did so in hopes of fostering a stronger trade relationship with the United States before the Brexit deadline. More than 1.8 million signed an official parliamentary e-petition which said that \\"Donald Trump's well documented misogyny and vulgarity disqualifies him from being received by Her Majesty the Queen or the Prince of Wales,\\" and Jeremy Corbyn, the Leader of the Opposition Labour Party, said in Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) that Trump should not be welcomed to Britain \\"while he abuses our shared values with his shameful Muslim ban and attacks on refugees' and women's rights\\" and said that Trump should be banned from the UK until his travel ban is lifted. Baroness Warsi, former chair of the Conservatives, accused May of \\"bowing down\\" to Trump, who she described as \\"a man who has no respect for women, disdain for minorities, little value for LGBT communities, no compassion clearly for the vulnerable and whose policies are rooted in divisive rhetoric.\\" London Mayor Sadiq Khan and the Conservative leader in Scotland, Ruth Davidson, also called for the visit to be cancelled. Trump's invitation was later downgraded to a \\"working visit\\" rather than a \\"state visit\\"; the visit occurred in July 2018 and included a meeting with the queen, but not the ceremonies and events of a full state visit. Despite May's efforts to establish a beneficial working relationship with Trump, their relationship had been described as \\"dysfunctional\\". It had been reported that, in their phone calls, Trump has made a habit of interrupting May. In November 2017, Trump retweeted an anti-Muslim post from the far-right group Britain First. The move was condemned across the British political spectrum, and May said through a spokesperson that it was \\"wrong of the president to have done this.\\" In response, Trump tweeted, \\"Don't focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom, We are doing just fine!\\" The dispute between Trump and May weakened the perception of a strong \\"special relationship\\" under May's leadership and undermined her efforts to craft an image of a close relationship with the United States in order to ease the passage of Brexit. Some viewed Trump's tweets as causing significant harm to the Special Relationship. In February 2018, Trump--in an attempt to rebuke a push by some in the U.S. Democratic Party for universal healthcare--tweeted that, \\"thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working\\". Trump's criticism of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) was factually inaccurate; the protests in the UK that Trump referenced actually pushed for an improvement in NHS services and increases in NHS funding, and were not in opposition to the NHS or to Britain's universal healthcare system. The tweet furthered strained the Trump-May relationship, and May responded by declaring her pride in the UK's health system. In January 2018, in a televised interview with Piers Morgan, Trump criticized May's approach to Brexit negotiations, furthering straining his relationship with her. At the 2018 G7 summit, Trump repeatedly made apparent slights towards May. Despite this, May stated that her relationship with Trump remained strong. At the 2018 Brussels summit, May sought to curry favor with Trump by supporting his complaints that other NATO members had failing to meet certain levels of defense funding. Following the Brussels summit, Trump made his first presidential visit to the United Kingdom. His visit came at period in the United Kingdom's political climate which had been preceded by significant tumult for May. She was receiving significant resistance to her plans for a \\"soft Brexit\\", which had resulted several major resignations amongst her cabinet ministers. During his visit, in an interview with The Sun, Trump spoke critically of May's handling of Brexit negotiations. He stated that May's proposal would likely kill the prospects of a US-UK trade agreement. These comments inflicted further damage on an already-embattled May. Trump also praised Boris Johnson (a political rival of May's who had recently resigned from her cabinet), going as far to suggest that Johnson would make a good prime minister. Vanity Fair considered that the \\"special relationship\\" had \\"devolved into a greasy dumpster fire\\" under Trump and May. Relations between the United Kingdom and the United States were further strained in 2019, after a number of confidential diplomatic cables authored by the British Ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch, were leaked to the Mail on Sunday. In the cables to the Foreign Office, which dated from 2017 to 2019, Darroch reported that the Trump administration as \\"uniquely dysfunctional\\" and \\"inept\\" and that Trump was \\"radiates insecurity\\"; the cables advised U.S. officials that dealing with Trump required them \\"you need to make your points simple, even blunt.\\" Darroch also wrote that Trump's position toward Iran frequently changed, likely to political considerations. After the memos leaked, Trump said that Darroch \\"has not served the UK well\\" and criticizing May. May defended Darroch, stating that \\"Good government depends on public servants being able to give full and frank advice\\"; other British politicians, such as Nigel Farage and Liam Fox, criticized Darroch. Following Boris Johnson's refusal to defend Darroch in a debate for the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election and Trump's statement that he would refuse to deal with Darroch, the ambassador resigned. Both May and Corbyn praised Darroch's service in the House of Commons and deplored that he had to resign under pressure from the United States. =Johnson and Trump (July 2019 ‚Äì present)= Prime Minister Boris Johnson (left) speaking with US President Donald Trump (right) at the 45th G7 summit, August 2019 After May resigned, Boris Johnson won the leadership contest with Trump's endorsement, and became Prime Minister. Trump praised Johnson as Prime Minister and celebrated comparisons that had been made between Johnson and himself, declaring, \\"Good man. He's tough and he's smart. They're saying 'Britain Trump.' They call him 'Britain Trump,' and there's people saying that's a good thing.\\" At the start of November, as the UK prepared for the start of its 2019 general election campaign, Trump threw his support behind Johnson and the Conservative Party, telling London radio station LBC that a government led by opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party would be \\"so bad for your country ... he'd take you into such bad places.\\" In the same interview, Trump praised Johnson as, \\"a fantastic man\\", and, \\"the exact right guy for the times\\". Trump also praised Nigel Farage, leader of the Brexit Party, and called for him and Johnson to collaborate on delivering Brexit. During the election campaign, Johnson had been seen as being keen on distancing himself from Trump, who is greatly unpopular in the UK. At the NATO summit in London in December 2019, Johnson was caught on-camera appearing to participate in mocking Trump in a conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Anne, Princess Royal. After the video was publicized, Trump criticized Trudeau as \\"two-faced\\" but did not criticize Johnson or other leaders. Public opinion It has been noted that secret defence and intelligence links \\"that [have] minimal impact on ordinary people [play] a disproportionate role in the transatlantic friendship\\",Editorial ‚Äì Bill and Tony ‚Äì New Best Friends', The Guardian (30 May 1997), p. 18. and perspectives on the Special Relationship differ. =Poll findings= A 1942 Gallup poll conducted after Pearl Harbor, before the arrival of U.S. troops and Churchill's heavy promotion of the Special Relationship, showed the wartime ally of the USSR was still more popular than the United States among 62% of Britons. However, only 6% had ever visited the United States and only 35% knew any Americans personally.Harry Blaney III and Julia Moore, 'Britain Doubtful of American Intentions, Poll Shows', Dallas Morning News (17 February 1986), p. 15A. In 1969, the United States was tied with the Commonwealth as the most important overseas connection for the British public, while Europe came in a distant third. By 1984, after a decade in the Common Market, Britons chose Europe as being most important to them.Blaney and Moore, 'Britain Doubtful', p. 15A. British opinion polls from the Cold War revealed ambivalent feelings towards the United States. Margaret Thatcher's 1979 agreement to base US cruise missiles in Britain was approved of by only 36% of Britons, and the number with little or no trust in the ability of the US to deal wisely with world affairs had soared from 38% in 1977 to 74% in 1984, by which time 49% wanted US nuclear bases in Britain removed, and 50% would have sent US-controlled cruise missiles back to the United States. At the same time, 59% of Britons supported their own country's nuclear deterrent, with 60% believing Britain should rely on both nuclear and conventional weapons, and 66% opposing unilateral nuclear disarmament. 53% of Britons opposed dismantling the Royal Navy's Polaris submarines. 70% of Britons still considered Americans to be very or fairly trustworthy, and in case of war the United States was the ally trusted overwhelmingly to come to Britain's aid, and to risk its own security for the sake of Britain. The United States and Britain were also the two countries most alike in basic values such as willingness to fight for their country and the importance of freedom. In 1986, 71% of Britons, questioned in a Mori poll the day after Ronald Reagan's bombing of Libya, disagreed with Thatcher's decision to allow the use of RAF bases, while two thirds in a Gallup survey opposed the bombing itself, the inverse of US opinion.Fiona Thompson, 'US Policies Breed Special Relationship Of Resentment / Increasing criticism of British Premier Thatcher's support for Reagan administration', Financial Times (11 November 1986). Anti-war protest in Trafalgar Square, February 2007 The United Kingdom's all-time low poll rating in the United States came in 1994, during the split over Bosnia, when 56% of Americans interviewed considered Britons to be close allies.Nihal Kaneira, 'Canada still tops list of US allies ‚Äì poll', Gulf News (21 September 1997).Tunku Varadarajan, 'Britain's place in US hearts secure', The Times (18 September 1997), p. 19. In a 1997 Harris poll published after Tony Blair's election, 63% of people in the United States viewed Britain as a close ally, up by one percent from 1996, 'confirming that the long- running \\"special relationship\\" with America's transatlantic cousins is still alive and well'.Kaneira, 'poll'. Britain came second behind its colonial offshoot Canada, on 73%, while another offshoot, Australia, came third, on 48%.Varadarajan, 'Britain's place secure', p. 19. Popular awareness of the historical link was fading in the parent country, however. In a 1997 Gallup poll, while 60% of the British public said they regretted the end of Empire and 70% expressed pride in the imperial past, 53% wrongly supposed that the United States had never been a British possession.'(Mis)remembrances of Empire', Wall Street Journal (29 August 1997), p. 6. In 1998, 61% of Britons polled by ICM said they believed they had more in common with US citizens than they did with the rest of Europe. 64% disagreed with the sentence 'Britain does what the US government tells us to do.' A majority also backed Blair's support of Bill Clinton's strategy on Iraq, 42% saying action should be taken to topple Saddam Hussein, with 24% favouring diplomatic action, and a further 24%, military action. A majority of Britons aged 24 and over said they did not like Blair supporting Clinton over the Lewinsky scandal.Orya Sultan Halisdemir, 'British deny they are US puppets', Turkish Daily News (14 February 1998). A 2006 poll of the US public showed that the United Kingdom, as an 'ally in the war on terror' was viewed more positively than any other country. 76% of the US people polled viewed the British as an 'ally in the War on Terror' according to Rasmussen Reports. According to Harris Interactive, 74% of Americans viewed Great Britain as a 'close ally in the war in Iraq', well ahead of next-ranked Canada at 48%. A June 2006 poll by Populus for The Times showed that the number of Britons agreeing that 'it is important for Britain's long-term security that we have a close and special relationship with America' had fallen to 58% (from 71% in April), and that 65% believed that 'Britain's future lies more with Europe than America.'Populus poll 2‚Äì4 June 2006 Only 44%, however, agreed that 'America is a force for good in the world.' A later poll during the Israel-Lebanon conflict found that 63% of Britons felt that the United Kingdom was tied too closely to the United States.Stand up to US, voters tell Blair, The Guardian (25 July 2006). A 2008 poll by The Economist showed that Britons' views differed considerably from Americans' views when asked about the topics of religion, values, and national interest. The Economist remarked: In January 2010 a Leflein poll conducted for Atlantic Bridge found that 57% of people in the US considered the special relationship with Britain to be the world's most important bilateral partnership, with 2% disagreeing. 60% of people in the US regarded Britain as the country most likely to support the United States in a crisis, while Canada came second on 24%, and Australia third on 4%.Amanda Bowman, What Britain's changing of the guard will mean for the U.S., Washington Examiner (7 April 2010).Americans Overwhelmingly Support the Special Relationship Between the US and the UK , Atlantic Bridge, 2010. In May 2010, a poll conducted in the UK by YouGov revealed that 66% of those surveyed held a favourable view of the US and 62% agreed with the assertion that America is Britain's most important ally. However, the survey also revealed that 85% of British citizens believe that the UK has little or no influence on American policies, and that 62% think that America does not consider British interests.Obama and the 'Special Relationship', Wall Street Journal, 19 May 2010. Another poll by YouGov in September 2016 revealed that 57% still believed in the special relationship, whilst 37% did not. =Iraq War= Following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, senior British figures criticized the refusal of the US Government to heed British advice regarding post-war plans for Iraq, specifically the Coalition Provisional Authority's de-Ba'athification policy and the critical importance of preventing the power vacuum in which the insurgency subsequently developed. British defence secretary Geoff Hoon later stated that the United Kingdom 'lost the argument' with the Bush administration over rebuilding Iraq. =Extraordinary rendition= US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice with British Foreign Secretary David Miliband, September 2007 Assurances made by the United States to the United Kingdom that 'extraordinary rendition' flights had never landed on British territory were later shown to be false when official US records proved that such flights had landed at Diego Garcia repeatedly. The revelation was an embarrassment for British foreign secretary David Miliband, who apologised to Parliament. =Criminal law= In 2003, the United States pressed the United Kingdom to agree to an extradition treaty which, proponents argued, allowed for equal extradition requirements between the two countries.Ambassador Tuttle on the Extradition Treaty (12 July 2006) Embassy of the United States. Retrieved 22 March 2009.Meg Hillier, What is the US-UK Extradition Act? (24 November 2006). Retrieved 22 March 2009. Critics argued that the United Kingdom was obligated to make a strong prima facie case to US courts before extradition would be granted, and that, by contrast, extradition from the United Kingdom to the United States was a matter of administrative decision alone, without prima facie evidence.John Hardy, Letter: Bilateral extradition treaty is not equal The Times (22 January 2009). This had been implemented as an anti-terrorist measure in the wake of 11 September 2001 attacks. Very soon, however, it was being used by the United States to extradite and prosecute a number of high-profile London businessmen (e.g., the Natwest Three and Ian Norris) on fraud charges. Contrasts have been drawn with the United States' harboring of Provisional IRA terrorists in the 1970s through to the 1990s and repeated refusals to extradite them to the UK. On 30 September 2006, the US Senate unanimously ratified the 2003 treaty. Ratification had been slowed by complaints from some Irish-American groups that the treaty would create new legal jeopardy for US citizens who opposed British policy in Northern Ireland. The Spectator condemned the three-year delay as 'an appalling breach in a long-treasured relationship'.'Suspend the treaty now', The Spectator (8 July 2006). The United States also refused to accede to another priority of the Blair government, the treaty setting-up the International Criminal Court.The Court That Tries American's Patience, The Daily Telegraph report =Trade policy= Trade disputes and attendant job fears have sometimes strained the Special Relationship. The United States has been accused of pursuing an aggressive trade policy, using or ignoring WTO rules; the aspects of this causing most difficulty to the United Kingdom have been a successful challenge to the protection of small family banana farmers in the West Indies from large US corporations such as the American Financial Group,Peter Clegg, From Insiders to Outsiders: Caribbean Banana Interests in the New International Trading Framework and high tariffs on British steel products. In 2002, Blair denounced Bush's imposition of tariffs on steel as 'unacceptable, unjustified and wrong', but although Britain's biggest steelmaker, Corus, called for protection from dumping by developing nations, the Confederation of British Industry urged the government not to start a 'tit-for-tat'.Peter Marsh and Robert Shrimsley, 'Blair condemns Bush's tariffs on steel imports', The Financial Times (7 March 2002), p. 3.

A barrel is one of several units of volume applied in various contexts; there are dry barrels, fluid barrels (such as the U.K. beer barrel and U.S. beer barrel), oil barrels, and so forth. For historical reasons the volumes of some barrel units are roughly double the volumes of others; volumes in common use range approximately from . In many connections the term is used almost interchangeably with barrel. Since medieval times the term as a unit of measure has had various meanings throughout Europe, ranging from about 100 litres to about 1,000 litres. The name was derived in medieval times from the French , of unknown origin, but still in use, both in French and as derivations in many other languages such as Italian, Polish and Spanish. In most countries such usage is obsolescent, increasingly superseded by SI units. As a result, the meaning of corresponding words and related concepts (vat, cask, keg etc.) in other languages often refers to a physical container rather than a known measure. In the international oil market context, however, prices in United States dollars per barrel are commonly used, and the term is variously translated, often to derivations of the Latin / Teutonic root fat (for example vat or Fass). In other commercial connections, barrel sizes such as beer keg volumes also are standardised in many countries. Dry goods in the US * US dry barrel: ( ‚âà ) **Defined as length of stave , diameter of head , distance between heads , circumference of bulge outside measurement; representing as nearly as possible 7,056 cubic inches; and the thickness of staves not greater than (diameter ‚âà ). Any barrel that is 7,056 cubic inches is recognized as equivalent. This is exactly equal to 26.25 US dry-gallons. * US barrel for cranberries ( ‚âà ) ** Defined as length of stave , diameter of head , distance between heads , circumference of bulge outside measurement; and the thickness of staves not greater than (diameter ‚âà ). No equivalent in cubic inches is given in the statute, but later regulations specify it as 5,826 cubic inches. Some products have a standard weight or volume that constitutes a barrel: * Cornmeal, * Cement (including Portland cement), or *Sugar, () * Wheat or rye flour, three bushels or * Lime (mineral), large barrel, or small barrel * Butter and cheese in UK, * Salt, Fluid barrel in the US and UK Fluid barrels vary depending on what is being measured and where. In the UK a beer barrel is . In the US most fluid barrels (apart from oil) are (half a hogshead), but a beer barrel is .27 CFR ¬ß 25.11. The size of beer kegs in the US is based loosely on fractions of the US beer barrel. When referring to beer barrels or kegs in many countries, the term may be used for the commercial package units independent of actual volume, where common range for professional use is 20‚Äì60 L, typically a DIN or Euro keg of 50 L. =History= Richard III, King of England from 1483 until 1485, had defined the wine puncheon as a cask holding 84 gallons and a wine tierce as holding 42 gallons. Custom had made the 42 gallon watertight tierce a standard container for shipping eel, salmon, herring, molasses, wine, whale oil, and many other commodities in the English colonies by 1700. After the American Revolution in 1776, American merchants continued to use the same size barrels. Oil barrel In the worldwide oil industry, an oil barrel is defined as 42 US gallons, which is about litres,1 US liquid gallon = 231 cu in and 1 inch = 25.4 mm implies exactly 158.987294928 litres. or 35 imperial gallons. Oil companies that are listed on American stock exchanges typically report their production in terms of volume and use the units bbl (one barrel), or kbbl or Mbbl (one kilobarrel, one thousand barrels), or MMbbl (one million barrels), and occasionally for wider comprehensive statistics Gbbl (or sometimes Gbl), for giga-barrel (one billion barrels). There is a conflict concerning the units for oil barrels (see ). For all other physical quantities, according to the International System of Units, the uppercase letter \\"M\\" means \\"mega-\\" (\\"one million\\"), for example: Mm (one million metres, megametres), MHz (one million hertz, or megahertz), MW (one million watts, or megawatt), MeV (one million electronvolt, or megaelectronvolt). But due to tradition, the Mbbl acronym is used today meaning \\"one thousand bbl\\", as a heritage of the roman number \\"M\\" meaning \\"one thousand\\". On the other hand, there are efforts to avoid this ambiguity, and most of the barrel dealers today prefer to use bbl, instead of Mbbl, mbbl, MMbbl or mmbbl. Outside the United States, volumes of oil are usually reported in cubic metres (m3) instead of oil barrels. Cubic metre is the basic volume unit in the International System. In Canada, oil companies measure oil in cubic metres, but convert to barrels on export, since most of Canada's oil production is exported to the US. The nominal conversion factor is 1 cubic metre = 6.2898 oil barrels, but conversion is generally done by custody transfer meters on the border, since the volumes are specified at different temperatures, and the exact conversion factor depends on both density and temperature. Canadian companies operate internally and report to Canadian governments in cubic metres, but often convert to US barrels for the benefit of American investors and oil marketers. They generally quote prices in Canadian dollars per cubic metre to other Canadian companies, but use US dollars per barrel in financial reports and press statements, making it appear to the outside world that they operate in barrels. Companies on the European stock exchanges report the mass of oil in tonnes. Since different varieties of petroleum have different densities, however, there is not a single conversion between mass and volume. For example, one tonne of heavy distillates might occupy a volume of . In contrast, one tonne of crude oil might occupy , and one tonne of gasoline will require . Overall, the conversion is usually between per tonne. =History= The measurement of an \\"oil barrel\\" originated in the early Pennsylvania oil fields. The Drake Well, the first oil well in the US, was drilled in Pennsylvania in 1859, and an oil boom followed in the 1860s. When oil production began, there was no standard container for oil, so oil and petroleum products were stored and transported in barrels of different shapes and sizes. Some of these barrels would originally have been used for other products, such as beer, fish, molasses, or turpentine. Both the barrels (based on the old English wine measure), the tierce (159 litres) and the whiskey barrels were used. Also, barrels were in common use. The 40 gallon whiskey barrel was the most common size used by early oil producers, since they were readily available at the time. Around 1866, early oil producers in Pennsylvania came to the conclusion that shipping oil in a variety of different containers was causing buyer distrust. They decided they needed a standard unit of measure to convince buyers that they were getting a fair volume for their money, and settled on the standard wine tierce, which was two gallons larger than the standard whisky barrel. The Weekly Register, an Oil City, Pennsylvania newspaper, stated on August 31, 1866 that \\"the oil producers have issued the following circular\\": And by that means King Richard III's English wine tierce became the American standard oil barrel. By 1872, the standard oil barrel was firmly established as 42 US-gallons. The 42 gallon standard oil barrel was officially adopted by the Petroleum Producers Association in 1872 and by the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1882. In modern times, many different types of oil, chemicals, and other products are transported in steel drums. In the United States, these commonly have a capacity of and are referred to as such. They are called 210 litre or 200 kg drums outside the United States. In the United Kingdom and its former dependencies, a drum is used, even though all those countries now officially use the metric system and the drums are filled to 200 litres. Thus, the 42 US-gallon oil barrel is a unit of measure, and is no longer a physical container used to transport crude oil, as most petroleum is moved in pipelines or oil tankers. In the United States, the 42 US-gallon size of barrel as a unit of measure is largely confined to the oil industry, while different sizes of barrel are used in other industries. Nearly all other countries use the metric system. =Definitions and units= The abbreviations Mbbl and MMbbl refer to one thousand and one million barrels respectively. These are derived from the Latin \\"mille\\", meaning \\"thousand\\". This is different from the SI convention where \\"M\\" stands for the Greek \\"mega\\", meaning \\"million\\". Outside of the oil industry, the unit Mbbl (megabarrel) can sometimes stand for one million barrels. The \\"b\\" may have been doubled originally to indicate the plural (1 bl, 2 bbl), or possibly it was doubled to eliminate any confusion with bl as a symbol for the bale. Some sources assert that \\"bbl\\" originated as a symbol for \\"blue barrels\\" delivered by Standard Oil in its early days. However, while Ida Tarbell's 1904 Standard Oil Company history acknowledged the \\"holy blue barrel\\", the abbreviation \\"bbl\\" had been in use well before the 1859 birth of the U.S. petroleum industry. Oil wells recover not just oil from the ground, but also natural gas and water. The term barrels of liquid per day (BLPD) refers to the total volume of liquid that is recovered. Similarly, barrels of oil equivalent or BOE is a value that accounts for both oil and natural gas while ignoring any water that is recovered. Other terms are used when discussing only oil. These terms can refer to either the production of crude oil at an oil well, the conversion of crude oil to other products at an oil refinery, or the overall consumption of oil by a region or country. One common term is barrels per day (BPD, BOPD, bbl/d, bpd, bd, or b/d), where 1 BPD is equivalent to 0.0292 gallons per minute.BP Statistical Review 2006. One BPD also becomes 49.8 tonnes per year. At an oil refinery, production is sometimes reported as barrels per calendar day (b/cd or bcd), which is total production in a year divided by the days in that year. Likewise, barrels per stream day (BSD or BPSD) is the quantity of oil product produced by a single refining unit during continuous operation for 24 hours. Burning a barrel of light, synthetic, or heavy crude yields 38.51, 39.40, or 40.90 GJ (thermal) respectively, so 1 bpd of synthetic crude is about 450 kW (slightly less for light crude, slightly more for heavy crude). =Accuracy when converting from barrel to cubic metre= When used to denote a volume, one barrel is exactly 42 US gallons and is easily converted to any other unit of volume. As the US gallon since 1893 is defined as 3.785411784 litre, a volume of one barrel is exactly 158.987294928 litres. Using the approximate value 159 litre is about 0.013% off. In the oil industry, following the definition of the American Petroleum Institute, a standard barrel of oil is often taken to mean the amount of oil that at a standard pressure and temperature would occupy a volume of exactly . This standard barrel of oil will occupy a different volume at different pressures and temperatures. A standard barrel in this context is thus not simply a measure of volume, but of volume under specific conditions. The task of converting this standard barrel of oil to a standard cubic metre of oil is complicated by the fact that the standard cubic metre is defined by the American Petroleum Institute to mean the amount of oil that at 101.325 kPa and occupies 1 cubic metre. The fact that the conditions are not exactly the same means that an exact conversion is impossible unless the exact expansion coefficient of the crude is known, and this will vary from one crude oil to another. For a light oil with density of 850 kilogram per cubic metre (API gravity of 35),API gravity calculated from density_oil as API_g = (141.5 / SG ) ‚àí 131.5, where SG is specific gravity = density_oil / density_water. warming the oil from to might increase its volume by about 0.047%. Conversely, a heavy oil with a density of 934 kg/m3 (API gravity of 20) might only increase in volume by 0.039%. If physically measuring the density at a new temperature is not possible, then tables of empirical data can be used to accurately predict the change in density. In turn, this allows maximum accuracy when converting between standard barrel and standard cubic metre. The logic above also implies the same level of accuracy in measurements for barrels if there is a error in measuring the temperature at time of measuring the volume. For ease of trading, communication and financial accounting, international commodity exchanges often set a conversion factor for benchmark crude oils. For instance the conversion factor set by the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) for Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude oil traded at Hardisty, Alberta, Canada is 6.29287 U.S. barrels per cubic metre, despite the uncertainty in converting the volume for crude oil. Regulatory authorities in producing countries set standards for measurement accuracy of produced hydrocarbons, where such measurements affect taxes or royalties to the government. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the measurement accuracy required is ¬±0.25%. =Qualifiers= A barrel can technically be used to specify any volume. Since the actual nature of the fluids being measured varies along the stream, sometimes qualifiers are used to clarify what is being specified. In the oil field, it is often important to differentiate between rates of production of fluids, which may be a mix of oil and water, and rates of production of the oil itself. If a well is producing 10 mbd of fluids with a 20% water cut, then the well would also be said to be producing 8,000 barrels of oil a day (bod). In other circumstances, it can be important to include gas in production and consumption figures. Normally, gas amount is measured in standard cubic feet or cubic metres for volume (as well as in kg or Btu, which don't depend on pressure or temperature). But when necessary, such volume is converted to a volume of oil of equivalent enthalpy of combustion. Production and consumption using this analogue is stated in barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). In the case of water-injection wells, in the United States it is common to refer to the injectivity rate in barrels of water per day (bwd). In Canada, it is measured in cubic metres per day (m3/d). In general, water injection rates will be stated in the same units as oil production rates, since the usual objective is to replace the volume of oil produced with a similar volume of water to maintain reservoir pressure.

Description Well developed crystals of epidote, Ca2Al2(Fe3+;Al)(SiO4)(Si2O7)O(OH), crystallizing in the monoclinic system, are of frequent occurrence: they are commonly prismatic in habit, the direction of elongation being perpendicular to the single plane of symmetry. The faces are often deeply striated and crystals are often twinned. Many of the characters of the mineral vary with the amount of iron present for instance, the color, the optical constants, and the specific gravity. The color is green, grey, brown or nearly black, but usually a characteristic shade of yellowish-green or pistachio-green. It displays strong pleochroism, the pleochroic colors being usually green, yellow and brown. Clinozoisite is green, white or pale rose-red group species containing very little iron, thus having the same chemical composition as the orthorhombic mineral zoisite. The name, due to Ha√ºy, is derived from the Greek word \\"epidosis\\" (·ºêœÄŒØŒ¥ŒøœÉŒπœÇ) which means \\"addition\\" in allusion to one side of the ideal prism being longer than the other. Epidote from Alaska Epidote is an abundant rock-forming mineral, but one of secondary origin. It occurs in marble and schistose rocks of metamorphic origin. It is also a product of hydrothermal alteration of various minerals (feldspars, micas, pyroxenes, amphiboles, garnets, and others) composing igneous rocks. A rock composed of quartz and epidote is known as epidosite. Well-developed crystals are found at many localities: Knappenwand, near the Gro√üvenediger in the Untersulzbachthal in Salzburg, as magnificent, dark green crystals of long prismatic habit in cavities in epidote schist, with asbestos, adularia, calcite, and apatite; the Ala valley and Traversella in Piedmont; Arendal in Norway; Le Bourg-d'Oisans in Dauphin√©; Haddam in Connecticut; Prince of Wales Island in Alaska, here as large, dark green, tabular crystals with copper ores in metamorphosed limestone. The perfectly transparent, dark green crystals from the Knappenwand and from Brazil have occasionally been cut as gemstones. =Related species= Belonging to the same isomorphous group with epidote are the REE-rich allanite (containing primarily lanthanum, cerium, and yttrium), and the manganese-rich piemontite. Piemontite occurs as small, reddish-black, monoclinic crystals in the manganese mines at San Marcel, near Ivrea in Piedmont, and in crystalline schists at several places in Japan. The purple color of the Egyptian porfido rosso antico is due to the presence of this mineral. Sample of dollaseite (dark brown matrix at arrow points) from Sweden Allanite and dollaseite-(Ce) have the same general epidote formula and contain metals of the cerium group. In external appearance allanite differs widely from epidote, being black or dark brown in color, pitchy in lustre, and opaque in the mass; further, there is little or no cleavage, and well-developed crystals are rare. The crystallographic and optical characters are similar to those of epidote; the pleochroism is strong with reddish-, yellowish-, and greenish-brown colors. Although not a common mineral, allanite is of fairly wide distribution as a primary accessory constituent of many crystalline rocks, gneiss, granite, syenite, rhyolite, andesite, and others. It was first found in the granite of east Greenland and described by Thomas Allan in 1808, after whom the species was named. Allanite is a mineral readily altered by hydration, becoming optically isotropic and amorphous: for this reason several varieties have been distinguished, and many different names applied. Orthite was the name given by J√∂ns Berzelius in 1818 to a hydrated form found as slender prismatic crystals, sometimes a foot in length, at Finbo, near Falun in Sweden. Dollaseite is less common, famous from the Ostanmossa mine in the Norberg district of Sweden.

It was, along with The Apples in Stereo and Neutral Milk Hotel, one of the three original projects of The Elephant 6 Recording Company. The band was founded by the remnants of the group Synthetic Flying Machine (Jeff Mangum, Bill Doss, and Will Cullen Hart) in 1994. The band went on hiatus in early 2000, and later reformed in 2009. Bill Doss died on July 31, 2012 (according to some sources, due to an aneurysm, however no official cause of death has been released). Synthetic Flying Machine Synthetic Flying Machine was an early project of Will Cullen Hart, Bill Doss, and Neutral Milk Hotel's Jeff Mangum. The band later went on to become known as the Olivia Tremor Control, with Hart and Doss remaining members while Mangum eventually left to focus on Neutral Milk Hotel. The band had only one official release to their name, Heaven Is for Kids, but there are several other tape cassettes of music distributed among friends and collaborators. Many of the songs performed by Synthetic Flying Machine later became songs by Neutral Milk Hotel (\\"Arms So Real\\") or Olivia Tremor Control (\\"Shaving Spiders\\", \\"Opera House\\"). Jeff Mangum wrote a song about the band of the same name, which became \\"Up and Over\\" and finally \\"The King of Carrot Flowers Pt. 3\\" on In the Aeroplane Over the Sea. Sound and history The band's distinct sound is a mixture of Doss and Hart's pop and experimental tendencies. Some tracks are 2‚Äì3 minute songs, while others are electro-acoustic collages ranging in length from 2 seconds to 10 minutes, and differing in content from vibrant horns to near silence. Furthermore, the band released a record of experimental electro-acoustic music, The Late Music, Volume One, under the name The Black Swan Network, in 1997. Another Black Swan Network release, a 7\\" EP on the Happy Happy Birthday to Me label, appeared in 2000, though it did not feature Bill Doss. In October 1997, a \\"collaborative\\" LP between the Olivia Tremor Control and The Black Swan Network was released, originally as a tour-only item, and later put out as a CD by Flydaddy, which gave the record the title, The Olivia Tremor Control vs. The Black Swan Network, though the band had never wanted the record to be named as such. Other projects The members of the Olivia Tremor Control embarked on a variety of different projects before and after the band broke up. Eric Harris released a record under the name Frosted Ambassador and later two CD-R releases under his own name on Cloud Recordings, the label founded by Fernandes and Hart in the wake of OTC's demise. Pete Erchick released three records, Individualized Shirts, Special Fanfare For Anything and Lost in the Pancakes, under the name Pipes You See, Pipes You Don't. Bill Doss followed OTC by putting out records as The Sunshine Fix, a name he had used years before. The Sunshine Fix has evolved from a recording project to a formal working band. Hart's post-OTC project, Circulatory System, has taken a similar route. The self-titled 2001 LP continued the melding together of pop and experimental traditions the OTC had worked on and won high accolades from the press. Jeff Mangum followed OTC with Neutral Milk Hotel, releasing On Avery Island and In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, as well as a few \\"underground\\" acoustic demos. Signal Morning, Circulatory System's sophomore LP features the reunion of Will Hart and Bill Doss singing harmonies on its opening track. Signal Morning was released on 8 September 2009 on Cloud Recordings. Will Cullen Hart has collaborated with groups such as Athens Tango Project in which he contributed backup vocals to a cover version of Olivia Tremor Control's song, I Have Been Floated which appeared on the compilation album release, An Enthusiast's Fanfare for Elephant 6 released in 2019. Reunion In 2005, the Olivia Tremor Control temporarily reunited, solely for live shows, at the behest of the All Tomorrow's Parties festival. They appeared at a UK version of the festival, preceded by warm-up shows in Athens, Georgia and London; that summer, they again played Athens, at the Orange Twin Conservation Community, as well as gigs in New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and L.A. In the fall of 2008, all members of the Olivia Tremor Control toured with other members of the Elephant 6 collective as part of the Holiday Surprise tour. In May 2009, Will Hart said in an interview that the band had recently re-entered the recording studio: \\"We've got two songs for the next Olivia record, in my opinion. They're on Bill's hard drive.\\" In March 2011, Elf Power drummer Derek Almstead confirmed that he was engineering and playing percussion on the new record and that new material would be debuted at All Tomorrows' Parties later in the year. In addition to this, they have released a song titled North Term Reality under Olivia Tremor Control for AUX Vol. 2. In September 2011, the band released the single The Game You Play Is In Your Head, a 3-song suite. It is unknown whether or not the song is a single from their new album. More live shows were planned including an appearance at the ATP Curated by Jeff Mangum festival in March 2012 in Minehead, England. On January 17, 2012, it was announced that OTC would play the fifth Austin Psych Fest April 27‚Äì29, 2012 at Emo's East in Austin Texas. OTC performed at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago's Union Park on July 13, 2012. On July 31, 2012, the band announced the death of Bill Doss. He died of an aneurysm.

The QR algorithm was developed in the late 1950s by John G. F. Francis and by Vera N. Kublanovskaya, working independently.J.G.F. Francis, \\"The QR Transformation, I\\", The Computer Journal, 4(3), pages 265-271 (1961, received October 1959). doi:10.1093/comjnl/4.3.265 Vera N. Kublanovskaya, \\"On some algorithms for the solution of the complete eigenvalue problem,\\" USSR Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics, vol. 1, no. 3, pages 637‚Äì657 (1963, received Feb 1961). Also published in: Zhurnal Vychislitel'noi Matematiki i Matematicheskoi Fiziki, vol.1, no. 4, pages 555‚Äì570 (1961). doi:10.1016/0041-5553(63)90168-X The basic idea is to perform a QR decomposition, writing the matrix as a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix, multiply the factors in the reverse order, and iterate. The practical QR algorithm Formally, let A be a real matrix of which we want to compute the eigenvalues, and let A0:=A. At the k-th step (starting with k = 0), we compute the QR decomposition Ak=QkRk where Qk is an orthogonal matrix (i.e., QT = Q‚àí1) and Rk is an upper triangular matrix. We then form Ak+1 = RkQk. Note that : A_{k+1} = R_k Q_k = Q_k^{-1} Q_k R_k Q_k = Q_k^{-1} A_k Q_k = Q_k^{\\\\mathsf{T}} A_k Q_k, so all the Ak are similar and hence they have the same eigenvalues. The algorithm is numerically stable because it proceeds by orthogonal similarity transforms. Under certain conditions, the matrices Ak converge to a triangular matrix, the Schur form of A. The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are listed on the diagonal, and the eigenvalue problem is solved. In testing for convergence it is impractical to require exact zeros, but the Gershgorin circle theorem provides a bound on the error. In this crude form the iterations are relatively expensive. This can be mitigated by first bringing the matrix A to upper Hessenberg form (which costs \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{10}{3}\\\\end{matrix} n^3 + \\\\mathcal{O}(n^2) arithmetic operations using a technique based on Householder reduction), with a finite sequence of orthogonal similarity transforms, somewhat like a two-sided QR decomposition. (For QR decomposition, the Householder reflectors are multiplied only on the left, but for the Hessenberg case they are multiplied on both left and right.) Determining the QR decomposition of an upper Hessenberg matrix costs 6 n^2 + \\\\mathcal{O}(n) arithmetic operations. Moreover, because the Hessenberg form is already nearly upper-triangular (it has just one nonzero entry below each diagonal), using it as a starting point reduces the number of steps required for convergence of the QR algorithm. If the original matrix is symmetric, then the upper Hessenberg matrix is also symmetric and thus tridiagonal, and so are all the Ak. This procedure costs \\\\begin{matrix}\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\end{matrix} n^3 + \\\\mathcal{O}(n^2) arithmetic operations using a technique based on Householder reduction. Determining the QR decomposition of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix costs \\\\mathcal{O}(n) operations. The rate of convergence depends on the separation between eigenvalues, so a practical algorithm will use shifts, either explicit or implicit, to increase separation and accelerate convergence. A typical symmetric QR algorithm isolates each eigenvalue (then reduces the size of the matrix) with only one or two iterations, making it efficient as well as robust.  The implicit QR algorithm  In modern computational practice, the QR algorithm is performed in an implicit version which makes the use of multiple shifts easier to introduce. The matrix is first brought to upper Hessenberg form A_0=QAQ^{\\\\mathsf{T}} as in the explicit version; then, at each step, the first column of A_k is transformed via a small-size Householder similarity transformation to the first column of p(A_k) (or p(A_k)e_1), where p(A_k), of degree r, is the polynomial that defines the shifting strategy (often p(x)=(x-\\\\lambda)(x-\\\\bar\\\\lambda), where \\\\lambda and \\\\bar\\\\lambda are the two eigenvalues of the trailing 2 \\\\times 2 principal submatrix of A_k, the so- called implicit double-shift). Then successive Householder transformations of size r+1 are performed in order to return the working matrix A_k to upper Hessenberg form. This operation is known as bulge chasing, due to the peculiar shape of the non-zero entries of the matrix along the steps of the algorithm. As in the first version, deflation is performed as soon as one of the sub- diagonal entries of A_k is sufficiently small. =Renaming proposal= Since in the modern implicit version of the procedure no QR decompositions are explicitly performed, some authors, for instance Watkins, suggested changing its name to Francis algorithm. Golub and Van Loan use the term Francis QR step.  Interpretation and convergence  The QR algorithm can be seen as a more sophisticated variation of the basic \\"power\\" eigenvalue algorithm. Recall that the power algorithm repeatedly multiplies A times a single vector, normalizing after each iteration. The vector converges to an eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue. Instead, the QR algorithm works with a complete basis of vectors, using QR decomposition to renormalize (and orthogonalize). For a symmetric matrix A, upon convergence, AQ = QŒõ, where Œõ is the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues to which A converged, and where Q is a composite of all the orthogonal similarity transforms required to get there. Thus the columns of Q are the eigenvectors.  History  The QR algorithm was preceded by the LR algorithm, which uses the LU decomposition instead of the QR decomposition. The QR algorithm is more stable, so the LR algorithm is rarely used nowadays. However, it represents an important step in the development of the QR algorithm. The LR algorithm was developed in the early 1950s by Heinz Rutishauser, who worked at that time as a research assistant of Eduard Stiefel at ETH Zurich. Stiefel suggested that Rutishauser use the sequence of moments y0T Ak x0, k = 0, 1, ‚Ä¶ (where x0 and y0 are arbitrary vectors) to find the eigenvalues of A. Rutishauser took an algorithm of Alexander Aitken for this task and developed it into the quotient-difference algorithm or qd algorithm. After arranging the computation in a suitable shape, he discovered that the qd algorithm is in fact the iteration Ak = LkUk (LU decomposition), Ak+1 = UkLk, applied on a tridiagonal matrix, from which the LR algorithm follows.  Other variants  One variant of the QR algorithm, the Golub-Kahan-Reinsch algorithm starts with reducing a general matrix into a bidiagonal one.Bochkanov Sergey Anatolyevich.

Lasting from March 9‚Äì29, 1847, it began with the first large-scale amphibious assault conducted by United States military forces, and ended with the surrender and occupation of the city. U.S. forces then marched inland to Mexico City. Background After the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista, much of Zachary Taylor's Army of Occupation was transferred to the command of Major General Winfield Scott in support of the upcoming campaign. That campaign, determined by Scott and other Washington officials, would be a Veracruz landing and an advance inland.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846‚Äì1848, New York: Macmillan, Mexican military intelligence knew in advance of U.S. plans to attack Veracruz, but internal government turmoil left them powerless to send crucial reinforcements before the American assault commenced. Opposing forces Mexican defenses Veracruz was considered to be the strongest fortress in North America at the time. Brigadier General Juan Esteban Morales commanded a garrison of 3,360 men which manned three major forts guarding Veracruz: * Fort Santiago ‚Äì south end of town * Fort Concepci√≥n ‚Äì north top of town ** These two forts included 3,360 men and 89 guns: artillery, 2nd and 8th infantry regiments, 3rd Light Regiment, a picket of 11th Regt., Puebla Libres, Orizaba, Veracruz, Oaxaca and Tehuantepec national guards. Battalions, sappers and enlisted marines. * Fort San Juan de Ul√∫a ‚Äì offshore on the Gallega Reef. Gen. Jose Dur√°n with 1,030 men and 135 guns: artillery, Puebla and Jamiltepec activo battalions, companies of Tuxpan, Tampico and Alvardo activo battalions. * See Orders of Battle Mexican War. Landings The amphibious assault on Veracruz The Americans arrived at Anton Lizardo, Veracruz in early March. Scott agreed with Conner's suggestion for a landing site at Collado Beach, south of Veracruz. The 1st Regular Division under Worth was chosen to make the landing first, followed by Patterson's volunteers and then Twiggs' regular division. Conner's Mosquito Fleet moved to within of the beach to supply covering fire if necessary. By 12:15 pm on 9 March, this force was off Collado Beach, followed by larger vessels over the next three hours and a signal for landing the surfboats at 5:30 pm. Just before the main force touched the beach, a gig dashed ahead, and General Worth with his staff jumped ashore. Worth's whole division landed without firing or receiving a single shot. By 11 pm, Scott's entire army had been brought ashore without a single man lost, and the first large scale amphibious landing conducted by the U.S. military was a success. Siege =Envelopment= Once ashore Patterson's division began marching northward to effect a complete envelopment of the city. One of Patterson's brigades under Gideon Pillow drove off a Mexican cavalry at Malibr√°n, cutting off the Alvarado road and the city's water supply. Quitman and Shields managed to drive off cavalry with one shot attempting to prevent the investment. By 13 March, the U.S. had completed a siege line from Collado in the south to Playa Vergara in the north. On 17 March, siege lines were dug for Scott's siege artillery, sufficient for taking the city but not Ulua. =Investment= The besiegers were plagued by sorties from the city, and Col. Juan Aguayo used the cover of a storm to slip his Alvarado garrison into Veracruz. Commodore Matthew C. Perry, Conner's successor, returned from Norfolk, Virginia after making repairs on the , on 20 March. Perry and Conner met with Scott regarding the Navy's role in the siege, and offered six guns that were to be manned by sailors from the ships. The naval battery was constructed under the direction of Captain Robert E. Lee from the city walls. On March 22, Morales declined a surrender demand from Scott, and the American batteries opened fire at 4:15 pm followed by those of Commander Josiah Tattnall's Mosquito Fleet at 5:45 pm. The Naval battery's heavy cannonballs easily broke the coral walls. Congreve rockets were fired into the defenses and the combined fire forced the abandonment of Fort Santiago and Mexican morale began to drop as civilian deaths reached the hundreds. On March 24, Persifor F. Smith's brigade captured a Mexican soldier with reports that Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna was marching an army from Mexico City to the relief of Veracruz. Scott dispatched Colonel William S. Harney with 100 dragoons to inspect any approaches that Santa Anna might make. Harney reported about 2,000 Mexicans and a battery not far away, and he called for reinforcements. General Patterson led a mixed group of volunteers and dragoons to Harney's aid and cleared the force from their positions, chasing them to Madellin. =Surrender= Attack of the Gun Boats, San Juan de Ulloa, after a sketch by J. M. Ladd, USN Scott made plans for an assault on the city when on 25 March, the Mexicans called for a cease-fire to evacuate women and children which Scott refused. That night, Morales' council of war advised surrender prompting Morales to resign while General Jos√© Juan Landero assumed command. A truce was called at 8 am on 26 March while terms of surrender were negotiated and concluded by 27 March. On 29 March, the Mexicans officially surrendered their garrisons in Veracruz and Fort Ul√∫a and later that day, the U.S. flag flew over San Juan de Ul√∫a. Aftermath The obstacle to an advancement to Mexico City was removed and Scott made immediate plans to leave a small garrison at Veracruz and march inland, his first objective being Jalapa. Along the way, Scott would in fact encounter a sizable Mexican army under Santa Anna at the Battle of Cerro Gordo.

History The professional care of feet was in existence in ancient Egypt as evidenced by bas-relief carvings at the entrance to Ankmahor's tomb dating from about 2400 BC where work on hands and feet is depicted. Corns and calluses were described by Hippocrates who recognized the need to physically reduce hard skin, followed by removal of the cause. He invented skin scrapers for this purpose and these were the original scalpels. Until the turn of the 20th century, chiropodists‚Äînow known as podiatrists‚Äîwere separate from organized medicine. They were independently licensed physicians who treated the feet, ankles and related leg structures. Lewis Durlacher was one of the first people to call for a protected profession. There are records of the King of France employing a personal podiatrist, as did Napoleon. In the United States, President Abraham Lincoln suffered greatly with his feet and chose a chiropodist named Isachar Zacharie, who not only cared for the president‚Äôs feet, but also was sent by President Lincoln on confidential missions to confer with leaders of the Confederacy during the U.S. Civil War.http://www.mdconsult.com/books/page.do?eid=4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-5223-4..00113-X&isbn;=978-1-4160-5223-4&sid;=1443544104&uniqId;=411842093-70#4-u1.0-B978-1-4160-5223-4..00113-X --s0010 The first society of chiropodists, now known as podiatrists, was established in New York in 1895‚Äîand still operates there today as NYSPMA. The first school opened in 1911. One year later the British established a society at the London Foot Hospital and a school was added in 1919. In Australia professional associations appeared from 1924 onwards. The first American journal appeared in 1907, followed in 1912 by a UK journal. In 1939, the Australians introduced a training centre as well as a professional journal. Podiatry is a high paying specialty and was listed by Forbes in 2007 as the 15th best paid profession in the United States.

Specific country practices =Australia= In Australia, podiatry is considered as an allied health profession, and is practised by individuals licensed by the Podiatry Board of Australia. There are eight teaching centres (as well as Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand), with two levels of awards‚Äîbachelor's degree (pass and/or honours) such as the Bachelor of Podiatric Medicine offered by Charles Sturt University and University of Western Sydney, and the master-level postgraduate Doctor of Podiatric Medicine offered by the University of Western Australia and the Master of Podiatric Practice by La Trobe University. In Australia there currently exist two levels of professional accreditation and professional privilege: General Podiatrist and the specialist ‚Äì Podiatric Surgeon. There is current lobbying for other specialties to be recognised in Australia such as podopediatrics, diabetes, high risk, musculoskeletal and sports podiatry. Australian podiatrists are able to practise abroad with their qualifications recognised in some Commonwealth countries. Many general podiatrists in Australia do routinely use the title Doctor, Dr. compliant with advertising regulations, and appropriate for the professional standing. Dr is not a protected title and therefore its use is unrestricted in Australia, and may be used by any health professional regulated under AHPRA as per advertising guidelines. There are guidelines advertising for regulated health services were jointly developed by the National Boards under section 39 of the National Law. Section 133 of the National Law regulates advertising of regulated health services. Registration and regulation Australian Podiatrists must register with the Podiatry Board of Australia. The Podiatry Board of Australia is responsible for regulation and recognition of Podiatrists and Podiatric Surgeons, and assessing foreign trained registrants in conjunction with the Australian & New Zealand Podiatry Accreditation Council (ANZPAC).

The cut-off scores from the Universities Admissions Centre (UAC) generally range from 70.00 to 95.00 dependent on the popularity and intake of each podiatric medical school. Prospective students can also be of mature age (21 & over) and they apply direct to the university instead of going through UAC. The UWA DPM degree have admission requirements that: completion of a UWA bachelor's degree or equivalent, a minimum GPA of 5.0 from the most recent three years (FTE) of valid study, suitable GAMSAT score, there is no interview for the DPM (Applications are handled via the University), english language competency Australian podiatrists complete an undergraduate degree ranging from 3 to 4 years of education. The first 2 years of this program are generally focused on various biomedical science subjects including functional anatomy, microbiology, biochemistry, physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, evidence-based medicine, sociology and patient psychology, similar to the medical curriculum. The following one years will then be spent focusing on podiatry specific areas such as podiatric anatomy & biomechanics, human gait, podiatric orthopaedics or the non-surgical management of foot abnormalities, podopaediatrics, sports medicine, rheumatology, diabetes, vascular medicine, mental health, wound care, neuroscience & neurology, pharmacology, general medicine, general pathology, local and general anaesthesia, minor & major podiatric surgical procedural techniques such as partial and total nail avulsions, matricectomy, cryotherapy, wound debridement, enucleation, suturing, other cutaneous and electro-surgical procedures and theoretical understanding of procedures performed by orthopaedic and podiatric surgeons. Australian podiatric surgeons are specialist podiatrists with further training in advanced medicine, advanced pharmacology, and training in foot surgery. Podiatrists wishing to pursue specialisation in podiatric surgery must meet the requirements for Fellowship with the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. They first complete a degree of 4 years, which includes 2 years of didactic study and 2 years of clinical experience. Following this, a master's degree must be completed with focus on biomechanics, medicine, surgery, general surgery, advanced pharmacology, advanced medical imaging and clinical pathology. They then qualify for the status of Registrar with the Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons. Following surgical training with a podiatric surgeon (3‚Äì5 years), rotations within other medical and surgeons' disciplines, overseas clinical rotations, and passing oral and written exams, Registrars may qualify for Fellowship status.Fellowship Training Program, Australasian College of Podiatric Surgeons Fellows are then given Commonwealth accreditation under the Health Insurance Act to be recognised as providers of professional attention, for the purposes of health insurance rebates. Australian podiatric medical schools There are currently nine universities in Australia (plus one in New Zealand) offering varying degrees of podiatric medicine from a Bachelor of Podiatry/Podiatric Medicine (BPod), a Masters of Podiatric Medicine (MPod) and the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) (DPM is a master-level degree). All podiatry schools are accredited by the Australian and New Zealand Podiatry Accreditation Council (ANZPAC). ANZPAC is an independent body comprising members consisting of the Podiatry Registration Boards in Australia and New Zealand. The Board of Management comprises registered podiatrists (nominated by the Registration Boards), nominees from the professional associations (Australasian Podiatry Council and Podiatry New Zealand), nominees from the educational institutions offering podiatry programs and community representation. ANZPAC has been assigned the accreditation functions for the Podiatry Board of Australia under the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme for Health Professions. There are also two more podiatry schools currently being developed at the Australian Catholic University and the University of Ballarat. The following universities offering podiatry areUniversity of Western Australia, Charles Sturt University, La Trobe University, University of Western Sydney, University of South Australia, University of Newcastle (Australia), Queensland University of Technology, Central Queensland University, Southern Cross University, Auckland University of Technology (New Zealand).

All podiatrists may refer patients for Medicare rebatable plain x-rays of the foot, leg, knee and femur, as well as ultrasound examination of soft tissue conditions of the foot. Podiatrists may refer patients for other radiology investigations such as CT, MRI or bone scans, however Medicare rebates do not currently exist for these examinations. Similarly, podiatrists may refer patients when needed to specialist medical practitioners, or for pathology testing, however similar exclusions in the Medicare Benefits Schedule prevent rebates being available to patients for these referrals. =Canada= In Canada, the definition and scope of the practice of podiatry varies provincially. For instance, in some provinces like British Columbia and Alberta, the standards are the same as in the United States where the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) is the accepted qualification. Quebec has also adopted the DPM level of training, although other academic designations may register. Also, in 2004, Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Trois-Rivi√®res started the first and only program of Podiatric Medicine in Canada based on the American definition of podiatry. This program enlists 25 students yearly across Canada and leads to a DPM upon obtaining 195 credits. In the prairie and Atlantic provinces, the standard was originally based on the British model now called podiatry (chiropody). The province of Ontario has been registering chiropodists since 1944, then introduced new legislation in 1991 (when the Ontario Government imposed a cap on Ontario trained chiropodists becoming podiatrists). If a registered podiatrist from outside of Ontario relocates to Ontario they are required to register with the province and practice as a chiropodist. Podiatrists who were practicing in Ontario previous to the imposed provincial cap were 'grandfathered' and allowed to keep the title of podiatrist as a subclass of chiropody. The scope of these 'grandfathered' (mostly American trained) podiatrists includes boney procedures of the forefoot and the ordering of x-rays in addition to the scope of the chiropodist. In Ontario, podiatrists are required to have a \\"Doctor of Podiatric Medicine/DPM\\" degree (a post-baccalaureate, four-year degree), where the majority of chiropodists currently practicing hold a post-secondary advanced diploma in chiropody, requiring a baccalaureate degree in the sciences or in another field as a prerequisite before entering chiropody. Podiatrists may bill OHIP for their services; chiropodists were restricted in 1991 from billing OHIP. Podiatrists may \\"communicate a diagnosis\\" to their patients (or to their patients' representatives) and perform surgical procedures on the bones of the forefoot; chiropodists may do neither. Chiropodists in Ontario perform soft tissue surgical procedures. Chiropodists and podiatrists are regulated by the College of Chiropodists of Ontario, which had 678 chiropodists and 55 podiatrists registered as of December 31, 2018.http://www.cocoo.on.ca/pdf/annual_report/annual_report_2018.pdf The only English-speaking chiropody program in Canada, in which also has a working chiropody clinic on campus for students to treat patients under the supervision of licensed chiropodists is The Michener Institute ‚Äì affiliated with University Health Network, Toronto. According to The Michener Institute website, chiropody is a branch of medical science that involves the assessment and management of foot and lower limb disorders. This includes the management of a wide variety of disorders, injuries, foot deformities, infections and local manifestations of systemic conditions. A chiropodist is a primary care professional practicing in podiatric medicine in Ontario that specializes in assessment, management and prevention of diseases and disorders of the foot. An essential member of the inter professional healthcare team, the chiropodist is skilled in assessing the needs of their patients and of managing both chronic and acute conditions affecting foot and lower limb function. As a primary care provider capable of independent clinical practice, these skills are often practiced independent of medical referral and medical supervision. =Iran= There are no podiatric medical schools in Iran. The Ministry of Health and Medical Education (MoHME) reviews the dossier of podiatric applicants for medical registration according to the \\"Regulations on the Evaluation of the Educational Credentials of Foreign Graduates\\", updated on 12 Mordad 1388 AHS (3 August 2009 CE).http://edd.behdasht.gov.ir Center for Educational Services, Under-ministry for Education, Ministry of Health and Medical Education, Government of Iran. Retrieved on 2014-04-12 Section 12-5: \\"The specific requirements for evaluation of education degrees in podiatry\\" stipulates that the podiatric degree from the United States will be registered as a professional doctorate in podiatric medicine, provided that the following are met: possession of a bachelor's degree, Successfully passing the MCAT, completion of the podiatric curriculum and obtaining the Doctor of Podiatric Medicine (DPM) from an accredited school, if required by the home jurisdiction, completion of a one-year postgraduate training, successfully passing of the relevant board examinations, an exception is made for those holding the [3-year undergraduate] Bachelor of Science (Podiatry) degree from accredited schools in the United Kingdom. After successful evaluation by the relevant commission, these degrees will be accepted at the bachelor's level (editorial note: the meaning of this exception is not clearly stated. It appears safe to assume that such bachelor's degrees do not qualify for medical registration and merely allow the holders to enroll in further educational programs). =New Zealand= Chiropody became a registered profession in New Zealand in 1969 with the requirement that all applicants take a recognized three-year course of training. Soon after the professional title was changed from Chiropody to Podiatry and The New Zealand School of Podiatry was established in 1970 at Petone under the direction of John Gallocher. Later the school moved to the Central Institute of Technology, Upper Hutt, Wellington. In 1976 the profession gained the legal right to use a local anaesthetic and began to introduce minor surgical ingrown toenail procedures as part of the scope of practice. New Zealand podiatrists were granted the right of direct referral to radiologists for X-rays in 1984. Acknowledgement of podiatric expertise marked improved services to patients and eventually in 1989 suitably trained podiatrists were able to become licensed to take X-rays within their own practice. Diagnostic radiographic training is incorporated into the degree syllabus and on successful completion of the course, graduates register with the New Zealand National Radiation Laboratory. In 1986, the profession undertook a needs analysis in conjunction with the Central Institute of Technology to identify competencies for podiatry in 2000. A Bachelor of Health Science was introduced in 1993. Auckland University of Technology is now the only provider of podiatry training in New Zealand. =United Kingdom= Mobile chiropodist in Chorley 2011 The scope of practice of UK podiatrists on registration after obtaining a degree in podiatry includes the use and supply of some prescription only medicines, injection therapy and non-invasive surgery e.g. performing partial or total nail resection and removal, with chemical destruction of the tissues. Podiatrists complete about 1,000 supervised clinical hours in the course of training which enables them to recognise systemic disease as it manifests in the foot and will refer on to the appropriate health care professional. Those in the NHS interface between the patients and multidisciplinary teams. The scope of practice of a podiatrist is varied ranging from simple skin care to invasive bone and joint surgery depending on education and training. In order to perform invasive foot surgery a UK podiatrist must undertake extensive postgraduate education and training, usually taking a minimum of 10 years to complete. In a similar way to podiatrists in Australasia, UK podiatrists may continue their studies and qualify as podiatric surgeons. Due to recent changes in legislation, the professional titles ‚Äòchiropodist‚Äô and ‚Äòpodiatrist‚Äô are now protected by law. In the UK there is no difference between the terms chiropodist and podiatrist. Those using protected titles must be registered with the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC). Registration is normally only granted to those holding a bachelor's degree from one of 13 recognized schools of podiatry in the UK. Professional bodies recognised by the Health Professions Council are: The Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, The Alliance of Private Sector Practitioners (thealliancepsp.com ), The Institute of Chiropodists and Podiatrists and The British Chiropody and Podiatry Association. The Royal Commission on the National Health Service in 1979 reported that about six and a half million NHS chiropody treatments were provided to just over one and a half million people in Great Britain in 1977, 19% more than three years earlier. Over 90% of patients receiving these treatments were aged 65 or over. At that time there were about 5,000 state registered chiropodists but only about two-thirds worked for the NHS. The Commission agreed with the suggestion of the Association of Chief Chiropody Officers for the introduction of more foot hygienists to undertake, under the direction of a registered chiropodist, \\"nail cutting and such simple foot-care and hygiene as a fit person should normally carry out for himself.\\" =United States= In the United States, medical and surgical care of the foot and ankle is mainly provided by two groups of physicians: podiatrists (who hold the degree of Doctor of Podiatric Medicine or DPM) and orthopedic surgeons (MD or DO). The first two years of podiatric medical school is similar to training that M.D. and D.O. students receive, but with an emphasized scope on foot, ankle, and lower extremity. Being classified as a second entry degree, in order to be considered for admission an applicant must first complete a minimum of 90 semester hours at the university level or more commonly, complete a bachelor's degree with emphasis on general/organic chemistry, biochemistry, biology, etc. In addition, potential students are required to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT). The DPM degree itself takes a minimum of four years to complete. extension angle of the first metatarsal phalangeal joint (MTPJ). The four-year podiatric medical school is followed by a surgical based residency, which is hands-on post-doctoral training. As of July 2013, all residency programs in podiatry were required to transition to a minimum three- years of post-doctoral training. Podiatric residents rotate through core areas of medicine and surgery. They work under MD supervision in such rotations as emergency medicine, internal medicine, infectious disease, behavioral medicine, physical medicine & rehabilitation, vascular surgery, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, plastic surgery, dermatology and of course podiatric surgery and medicine. Fellowship training is available after residency in such fields such as geriatrics, foot and ankle traumatology, infectious disease etc. In reality though, the residency training of most podiatry residencies today are already highly inclusive of these medical areas. In most states, their scope is limited to areas at or below the ankle joint, however, some states include the leg, as well as the hand as within the scope of podiatry. Podiatric Surgical Training A 40 watt CO2 laser used for podiatry Upon completion of their residency, podiatrists can decide to become board certified by a number of specialty boards including the more common American Board of Podiatric Medicine and/or the American Board of Podiatric Surgery. The American Board of Podiatric Medical Specialties (ABPMS) has been certifying podiatrists since 1998.US Podiatry. K12 Academics Retrieved on 2012-08-24. Within the American Board of Podiatric Surgery, PM&S; 24 graduates can sit for Board Certification in Foot Surgery and those that complete PM&S; 36 can sit for Board Certification in Foot Surgery and Board Certification in Reconstructive Rearfoot & Ankle Surgery. Both boards in ABPS are examined as separate tracks. Though the ABPS and ABPM are more common, other boards are equally challenging and confer board qualified/certified status. Many hospitals and insurance plans do not require board eligibility or certification to participate. Podiatrists certified by the ABPS have successfully completed an intense board certification process comparable to that undertaken by individual MD and DO specialties. There are two surgical certifications under ABPS. They are Foot Surgery and Reconstructive Rearfoot/Ankle (RRA) Surgery. In order to be Board Certified in RRA, the sitting candidate has to have already achieved board certification in Foot Surgery. Certification by ABPS requires initial successful passing of the written examination. Then the candidate is required to submit surgical logs indicating experience and variety. Once accepted, the candidate has to successfully pass oral examination and computer questions of clinical simulation. Practice characteristics While the majority of podiatric physicians are in solo practice, there has been a movement toward larger group practices as well as the use of podiatrists in multi-specialty groups including orthopedic groups, treating diabetes, or in multi-specialty orthopedic surgical groups. Some podiatrists work within clinic practices such as the Indian Health Service (IHS), the Rural Health Centers (RHC) and Community Health Center (FQHC) systems established by the US government to provide services to under-insured and non-insured patients as well as within the United States Department of Veterans Affairs providing care to veterans of military service. Some podiatrists have primarily surgical practices. Some specialists complete additional fellowship training in reconstruction of the foot and ankle from the effect of diabetes or physical trauma. Other surgeons practice minimally invasive percutaneous surgery for cosmetic correction of hammer toes and bunions. Podiatrists use medical, orthopedic, biomechanical and surgical principles to maintain and correct foot deformities. Podiatrists may also be able to be a Chief of Surgery in a public or private hospital. Colleges and education There are nine colleges of podiatric medicine in the United States. These are governed by the American Association of Colleges of Podiatric Medicine (AACPM). The AACPM describes its mission as to enhance academic podiatric medicine.

It is connected with the Tasman Sea through a tidal channel at its southern end known as The Entrance. It is also connected with two smaller lakes, Budgewoi Lake and through that to Lake Munmorah. Tuggerah Lake has a catchment area of and a surface area of . When full, Tuggerah Lake covers an area of around . Heavy rains in June 2007 caused Tuggerah Lake to flood, affecting areas of Long Jetty, Killarney Vale and Chittaway Point. On the sea side of the peninsula is Norah Head and its historic lighthouse. =Urban areas= The lake adjoins extensive areas of suburban development. Much of the original settlement bordering the lake was oriented towards domestic tourism; with Sydney residents drawn to the area and staying in camp and early cabin-style accommodation clustered around towns of The Entrance and Long Jetty, from there spreading to Toukley on the northern lakeshore. Many towns surround the lake including Lake Munmorah, The Entrance, Killarney Vale, Berkeley Vale, Tumbi Umbi, Wyong, Kanwal, Gorokan and Toukley. Long Jetty South of The Entrance is Long Jetty, so named for the jetty built to service the first sub-division of land at The Entrance. The original jetty was washed away in a flood at Easter 1927; the present structure replaced it, built in 1927‚Äì28 to a length of . Parts of the jetty have fallen into disrepair and it requires frequent periodic repairs and replacement of its structure and decking. =Fishing and boating= Tuggerah Lake is well known for its recreational fishing with species such as luderick, bream, flathead and whiting caught from the shoreline and boats. Prawns can be plentiful over the summer months during the dark of the new moon. Fishing in Tuggerah Lake is generally poor during late winter and early spring, particularly when westerly winds are prevalent. Special purpose markers (coloured yellow) around Terilbah Island and Pelican Island denote areas where net and trap fishing are restricted. Other parts of the lake may have permanent or temporary fishing restrictions in force. Due to its large size and shallow depth strong winds can whip up a steep choppy surface that can be hazardous to small boats, however Tuggerah Lake is considered quite safe for most forms of small recreational watercraft if common sense and general safe boating practices are followed. Many parts of Tuggerah Lake are quite shallow with sand or weed flats exposed at low water. Marked channels should be navigated with care and at reduced speed. Mobile phone coverage is available across the entire lake. Environment Substantial residential and commercial development, involving excavation and alteration of native vegetation and natural watercourses in the lake catchment and hinterland, has given rise to siltation and changes in the make up of the lakebed and foreshore. During 2004 and 2005 the Tuggerah Lakes Restoration project has been attempting to restore and revive the lake system. Urbanisation and development have caused increased nutrients to build up in the lake stimulating weed growth. Restoration work has focussed on inshore removal of weed and ooze; foreshore reclamation and reinstatement; pollutant traps; and channel dredging to increase the tidal exchange of water with the sea. Wyrrabalong National Park borders the lake and the sea separating the residential areas of Toukley and The Entrance, and preserves the last significant littoral rainforest on the Central Coast. The lake is part of the Tuggerah Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance for a variety of water and woodland birds.BirdLife International. (2011).

It is a remake of the 1936 Frank Capra film Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, which in turn is based on the 1935 short story Opera Hat by Clarence Budington Kelland. Plot Multi-billionaire Preston Blake (Harve Presnell) dies while climbing Mount Everest. With no immediate heir, it is unclear who will inherit Blake's massive fortune. It is found that Blake has a living grandnephew named Longfellow Deeds (Adam Sandler), who runs a pizzeria in Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire and also writes greeting cards hoping to sell them to Hallmark. Deeds is flown to New York City by businessman Chuck Cedar (Peter Gallagher), who temporarily controls Blake Media. Once Deeds arrives, plans are made for him to sell his shares in the company to Cedar and return home $40 billion richer. He remains in New York while the legal details are worked out. The story is major news, and reporter Babe Bennett (Winona Ryder), who works for a tabloid TV show called Inside Access, has a co-worker pretend to steal her purse in sight of Deeds. Research indicates that Deeds wants to meet a girl by \\"rescuing\\" her, the same way his father had met his mother. Deeds \\"rescues\\" Babe and she goes out with him pretending to be \\"Pam Dawson\\", a school nurse from a fictional town called Winchestertonfieldville, Iowa (which later turns out to be a real place, surprising Babe). Though Babe initially wanted a good story on the new heir, she eventually falls for the unfailingly hard-hearted Deeds. She decides to tell him who she really is, but Inside Access, in concert with Cedar (who learned the truth from the fake purse snatcher who is smitten with Babe) reveals the truth to Deeds first. Heartbroken, Deeds decides to return home to Mandrake Falls and decides to donate his $40 billion inheritance to the United Negro College Fund. After returning to Mandrake Falls, Deeds learns from his friend, Crazy Eyes, (Steve Buscemi) that Cedar intends to sell the company, causing employees to lose their jobs. Cedar had convinced Longfellow to sell his shares by lying that he would command the company in honor of Preston's lifetime of work. Babe follows Deeds to Mandrake Falls to win him back, but after saving her life when she falls through the ice over a lake, he rejects her, saying he does not really know who she is. At a shareholders meeting, Cedar has persuaded everyone to sell the company, until Deeds (who has bought a single share) arrives and convinces everyone not to sell. But Cedar controls a majority of the shares and the sale is approved. Babe arrives and reveals that, having studied Blake's personal journal after she stole it from Deeds earlier, she has determined that Emilio Lopez (John Turturro), Preston Blake's longtime butler, is Blake's illegitimate son and the true heir as a result of Preston's affair with his maid. Emilio immediately takes control of Blake Media, starting by firing Cedar. Babe reconciles with Deeds after professing she loves him. Emilio thanks Deeds for his support and offers him a billion dollars, some of which Deeds spends on red Corvettes for everyone in Mandrake Falls. When he returns to the pizzeria with Babe, he learns that Hallmark is interested in buying one of his greeting cards: the one he wrote for Babe when he professed his love for her. They share a kiss as the movie ends with Crazy Eyes crashing his Corvette into a tree, but is unharmed.

Production The producers were looking for a small, \\"old-fashioned, New England-type\\" town close to New York, when they serendipitously discovered New Milford, Connecticut, and, upon having lunch there at \\"The Bistro Cafe\\", decided the town would be the perfect choice to portray the fictional home-town of Deeds, Mandrake Falls, New Hampshire, and the cafe was a great location to use as \\"'Deeds' Pizza\\" restaurant.per DVD 'extras' featurette Some scenes were also shot in Carmel, New York. Several sequences were filmed in New York City around Spring 2001. Following the September 11th, 2001 attacks, images of the World Trade Center towers were digitally removed from several shots of New York City. The Blake Media Hotel scenes were shot in Beverly Hills, California. In the scene where Longfellow Deeds and Chuck Cedar playing tennis at the tennis court was filmed at Roosevelt Island, New York. Reception = Critical response = The film received mainly negative reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 22% based on reviews from 156 critics, with an average rating score of 4.05/10. Its consensus states: \\"This update of Capra doesn't hold a candle to the original, and even on its own merits, Mr. Deeds is still indifferently acted and stale\\". Mr. Deeds received three Razzie Award nominations including Worst Actor (Adam Sandler), Worst Actress (Winona Ryder) and Worst Remake or Sequel. However, the film also won a Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Movie Actor (Sandler).

He wrote more than 50 books, mostly in the fields of African-American history and general U.S. history, most notably, American Negro Slave Revolts (1943), a classic in the field. He also compiled the 7-volume Documentary History of the Negro People (1951‚Äì1994). In addition, he compiled a wide variety of primary documents supporting study of African- American history. He was the literary executor for W. E. B. Du Bois. From the 1940s, Aptheker was a prominent figure in U.S. scholarly discourse. Aptheker was blacklisted in academia during the 1950s because of his Communist Party membership. He succeeded V. J. Jerome in 1955 as editor of Political Affairs, a communist theory magazine. Biography =Early life and education= Herbert Aptheker was born in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest child of a wealthy Jewish family. In 1931, when he was 16, he accompanied his father on a business trip to Alabama.Gary Murrell, \\"The Most Dangerous Communist in the United States\\": A Biography of Herbert Aptheker. Amherst, MA: University of Massachusetts Press, 2015; pg. 4. There he learned first-hand about the oppression of African Americans under Jim Crow Laws in the South.Murrell, \\"The Most Dangerous Communist in the World,\\" pp. 4-5. The trip proved shocking and life-altering for Aptheker, who upon his return to Brooklyn began writing a column called \\"The Dark Side of The South\\" for his Erasmus Hall High School newspaper Murrell, \\"The Most Dangerous Communist in the World,\\" pg. 5. Aptheker graduated from high school in the spring of 1933, during the Great Depression. Although admitted to Columbia University, he was unable to gain admission to the main campus of Columbia College, which had already filled a quota set for Jews by college president Nicholas Murray Butler. Instead, Aptheker was relegated to enrolling at Seth Low Junior College in Brooklyn Heights, a satellite school established by Butler as a de facto dumping ground for JewsLeeza Hirt, \\"Columbia for Jews? The Untold Story of Seth Low Junior College,\\" The Current, Fall 2016. and ethnic Italians admitted in excess of Butler's quotas. During his time at Seth Low, Aptheker was first drawn into political activity, helping to organize anti-war rallies and speaking on behalf of the communist-backed National Student League (NSL) and the socialist-backed Student League for Industrial Democracy.Murrell, \\"The Most Dangerous Communist in the World,\\" pg. 6. He began reading the Communist Party's daily newspaper, The Daily Worker, at this time as well as the party's literary-artistic monthly, The New Masses, although he did not yet become a member of the party. After two years at Seth Low, Aptheker was allowed to enroll at Columbia's main campus in Morningside Heights in Manhattan, but not with full status as a member of Columbia College. Instead, he was classified as a \\"university undergraduate\\", which placed him on track for a lesser Bachelor of Science degree rather than the higher-status Bachelor of Arts, which he received in 1936. At Columbia, Aptheker continued to engage in the anti-war movement, both through the NSL and the American League Against War and Fascism, a broader mass organization of the Communist Party during its Popular Front period. Aptheker earned his Master's degree from Columbia in 1937 and a Ph.D. in 1943 from the same institution.Francis X. Gannon, Biographical Dictionary of the Left: Volume 3. Boston: Western Islands, 1972; pp. 215-218. In September 1939, he joined the Communist Party USA. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in sociology in 1945. =Marriage and World War II= In 1942 Aptheker married Fay Philippa Aptheker (1905‚Äì1999), a first cousin who was also a native of Brooklyn. She was a union organizer and political activist. They were married for 62 years, until her death. Their daughter, Bettina, was born in 1944 at the U.S. Army Hospital in Fort Bragg, North Carolina during Aptheker's service in World War II. Aptheker participated in Operation Overlord, the invasion of northern France; by 1945 he had been promoted to the rank of Major in the artillery. He commanded the all-black 350th artillery unit.Robin D.G. Kelley, \\"Interview of Herbert Aptheker,\\" The Journal of American History, vol. 87, no. 1 (June 2000), pp. 151‚Äì167 In December 1950, after failing to respond to the U.S. Army's letter of inquiry about his Communist political activity, he lost his commission after an honorable discharge. =Work in the South= Returning with his family to the South after the war, Aptheker became an educational worker for the Food and Tobacco Workers Union. Shortly afterward, he served as secretary of the \\"Abolish Peonage Committee,\\" which had been established in 1940 by activists in New York and Chicago, with the support of the International Labor Defense (IDL), an arm of the Communist Party. \\"Peons\\" in the South, the vast majority of whom were African American, were typically rural sharecroppers who became tied to plantations by the debt they owed to the plantation owners, or to local merchants. This practice had effectively maintained African-American slavery after the Civil War in all but name.Douglas A. Blackmon, Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II, 2009 Given repeated publicity about peonage abuses, in 1941 Attorney General Francis Biddle had directed all federal prosecutors to \\"actively investigate and try more peonage cases.\\" On the verge of entering World War II, the US would make more effort to reduce rural peonage. Similarly, southern states had run convict leasing programs, hiring out convicts to industries and taking the fees as revenue. Several southern states had banned convict leasing to industries in the early 20th century: Tennessee, South Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Arkansas and Florida by 1923.[https://bento.cdn.pbs.org/hostedbento- prod/filer_public/SBAN/Images/Classrooms/Slavery%20by%20Another%20Name%20History%20Background_Final.pdf Nancy O‚ÄôBrien Wagner, \\"Slavery by Another Name: History Background\\", Twin Cities Public Television, 2012 Research in African-American history Aptheker's master's thesis, a study of Nat Turner's slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831, laid the groundwork for his future work on the history of American slave revolts. Aptheker revealed Turner's heroism, demonstrating how his rebellion was rooted in resistance to the exploitative conditions of the Southern slave system. His Negro Slave Revolts in the United States 1526‚Äì1860 (1939), includes a table of documented slave revolts by year and state. His doctoral dissertation, American Negro Slave Revolts, was published in 1943. Doing research in Southern libraries and archives, he uncovered 250 similar episodes. Aptheker set forth historiographical arguments, challenging some conservative histories, most notably the perspective in the writings of Georgia-born historian Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, who was considered part of the Dunning School at Columbia University. Historians of this group had been critical of Reconstruction and argued that slavery was no worse than urban labor conditions. Phillips had characterized enslaved African Americans as childlike, inferior, and uncivilized; he argued that slavery was a benign institution; and defended the preservation of the Southern plantation system. Such works had been common in the field before Aptheker's scholarship. Aptheker long emphasized W. E. B. Du Bois' social science scholarship and lifelong struggle for African Americans to achieve equality. In his work as a historian, he compiled a documentary history of African Americans in the United States, a monumental collection which he started publishing in 1951. It eventually resulted in seven volumes of primary documents, a tremendous resource for African-American studies. Post-war activism During the 1950s and the period of McCarthyism, Aptheker was blacklisted in academia because of his membership in the Communist Party. He was unable to obtain an appointment as a university lecturer for a decade. Aptheker served on the National Committee of the CPUSA from 1957 to 1991. For several years in the 1960s and 1970s, he was executive director of the American Institute For Marxist Studies. In 1966, he ran in the U.S. House of Representatives election in New York's 12th Congressional District for the Peace and Freedom Party; he received 3,562 votes. Given his work on African-American documents and history, Aptheker was chosen by W. E. B. Du Bois to be his literary executor. A strong opponent of the Vietnam War, Aptheker lectured on the subject on college campuses nationwide. From 1969 to 1973, Aptheker taught a full-year course annually in Afro-American History at Bryn Mawr College. Aptheker died at age 87 on March 17, 2003, in Mountain View, California. His wife had died in 1999. Allegation of child abuse Bettina Aptheker is a professor of feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In her 2006 memoir, Intimate Politics, she claimed that she was sexually abused by her father from the age of 3 to 13. Her memories of the events began to arise in 1999, after her mother's death and when she was working on a memoir. She sought counseling for her dissociation and recovered memory. Alt URL She also wrote that she and her father reconciled before his death in 2003. Her assertion caused great controversy among historians and activists. Some raised questions about her credibility; others questioned the Old Left's desire to bury the news, and still others wondered at how to look at Aptheker's work in view of this information. In her memoir, Bettina Aptheker wrote more at length about her father's work on African-American history. She thought that he celebrated black resistance in part \\"to compensate for his deep shame about the way, he believed, the Jews had acted during the Holocaust.\\" The controversy about her claims about her father continued for months, with many essays and letters published on the History News Network hosted by George Mason University. In November 2007, the historian Christopher Phelps published an overview of the issues. He also wrote that he had interviewed Kate Miller, who had been present during Bettina Aptheker's 1999 conversation with her father about the abuse, and confirmed her account.Christopher Phelps, \\"Herbert Aptheker: His daughter's partner confirms molestation charge\\", The Nation, 5 November 2007, reprinted at History News Network, accessed 18 January 2012 Works *\\"Mississippi Reconstruction and the Negro Leader Charles Caldwell\\", Science & Society (Fall 1947) *Afro American History: 1910-1932, (Citadel Press: New York, 1951) *History and Reality, *The American Revolution 1763-1783,(International Publishers: New York, 1960) * American Negro Slave Revolts (1943), (Cameron Associates: NY, 1955) * Documentary History of the Negro People, 7-volumes, (Carol Publishing Group: NJ, 1951‚Äì1994) *The Truth about Hungary, (Kraus Reprint: NY, 1957) *And Why Not Every Man?, (Seven Seas Books: CA, 1961) *Dare We Be Free?, (New Century Publishers: Dublin, 1961) *Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion: Including the 1831 \\"Confessions\\", (Dover: NY, 1966) * \\"Imperialism and Irrationalism\\", TELOS 04 (Fall 1969) *The Urgency of Marxist-Christian Dialogue, (Kraus Reprint: NY, 1970) *American Negro Slave Revolts, (International Publishers: New York, 1974) *Early Years of the Republic: From the End of the Revolution to the First Administration of Washington, (International Publishers: New York, 1976) *Negro People in America, (Kraus Reprint: NY, 1977) *The World of C.

Course and features Reflections of the forest on the Gordon River.The \\"weak tea\\" coloured water of the Gordon River. The Gordon River rises below Mount Hobhouse in the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park draining the eastern slopes of the King William Range. The river flows generally south and to the west of the Gordon Range before flowing west through the Gordon Gap and spilling into Lake Gordon, an impounded reservoir created by damming the Gordon at the Gordon Dam. Together with water fed from Lake Pedder, the principal purpose of the reservoir is for generation of hydro-electricity at the Gordon Power Station. Flowing from east to west through Lake Gordon, the river continues west, passing through the Gordon Splits, a series of gorges once considered impassable until 1958 when Olegas Truchanas, a conservationist and nature photographer, was the first person to navigate the Gordon River in a kayak. The river flows north by west and then due north and finally due west as it reaches its mouth and empties into Macquarie Harbour at Wrights Bay. From source to mouth, the river is joined by 25 tributaries including the Gell, Boyes, Pokana, Holley, Adams, Serpentine, Albert, Orange, Smith, Denison, Olga, Sprent, Franklin, and the Spence rivers. The river descends over its course; much of which is located in an uninhabited wilderness area, contained with the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park and Southwest National Park. The lower part of the Gordon River is part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area and contains a cold-climate rainforest and rare trees. As with many rivers in western Tasmania, the water is fresh and drinkable, yet has the colour of weak tea due to the absorption of tannin from button grass growing in the catchment area. Additional dams were proposed for the lower part of the river. However, these plans were changed as a result of significant opposition and public opinion. In particular, the Franklin Dam was proposed just downstream of the junction with the Franklin River, and would have flooded much of both rivers. It was a major political and environmental issue in the 1980s. Boat excursions to the lower Gordon River from Macquarie Harbour are popular with tourists in Strahan. Seaplane flights depart Strahan during the warmer months and include an out landing on the Gordon River (usually a duration of one hour).

He is well known for his distinct guitar work and drumming in the band Emperor, as well as his formation of the death metal band Zyklon. In very early Emperor releases, he was called Samot (his name \\"Tomas\\" backward), and with the formation of Zyklon he became known as Zamoth. Samoth was the owner of the record label Nocturnal Art Productions and had a close relationship with Candlelight Records. Biography Samoth was born on 9 June 1974 in Hammerfest, Norway. He is the son of Spoonful of Blues bass player Jens Haugen, who encouraged his son to play bass guitar. He grew up in Akkerhaugen, Norway. When Samoth was a young man, he met a fellow musician, who would later become known as Ihsahn, at a rock clinic in Bergen. The two soon became friends and started playing music together. They formed a band and moved through various names ‚Äì they were called Dark Device, Xerasia, and finally Embryonic. The group eventually settled on the name Thou Shalt Suffer in 1991. They were playing an early form of black metal with keyboards strongly influenced by death metal, particularly vocally. Samoth and Ihsahn's friendship proved to be strong, and the two eventually took their musicianship to a new level. Partially due to the influence of Euronymous of the band Mayhem, Samoth left Thou Shalt Suffer and with Ihsahn, began writing music for a new band called Emperor (in which he played drums). Ihsahn was the only member of Thou Shalt Suffer to remain, and soon bass player Mortiis and drummer Faust were recruited for Emperor; Samoth moved back to his more familiar position of guitar. At this point, the group was playing fully developed black metal. Emperor was quick to release several demos in 1992 and 1993, which gained them recognition and popularity in the underground. Mortiis did not stay in the band, and decided to form his own, more electronic-based solo band. He was succeeded by Tchort. In 1994 Samoth was sentenced to 16 months in prison for burning Skjold Church in Vindafjord, together with Varg Vikernes.NTB. (1994, June 29th). Ubetinget fengsel for kirkebrann.

(Norwegian) VG, p. 11. where Samoth performed as a session bass player. As Tchort and Faust were also imprisoned at this time, Ihsahn was the only remaining band member outside prison, and Emperor did not release another album for three years. Tchort and Faust did not return to the band. After years of playing in Emperor and being featured on various black metal side projects, Samoth, in conjunction with Ihsahn, decided to dissolve Emperor in 2001 due to their differing musical tastes. Although black metal was both Samoth and Ihsahn's biggest influence and favorite genre of music, Samoth was leaning toward a futuristic death metal sound, while Ihsahn was more influenced by progressive metal and symphonic metal. After Emperor's final release, Prometheus: The Discipline of Fire & Demise, composed entirely by Ihsahn, Emperor was no more. Samoth went on to play guitar with fellow drummer Trym in the death metal band Zyklon. Emperor regrouped in 2006 with the core trio of Ihsahn, Samoth and Trym augmented by a bassist and a keyboardist, and played a few one-night-off gigs in Europe and USA in 2006 and 2007. Recently Samoth was involved in Norwegian- American supergroup Scum, which also featured B√•rd Faust, Cosmocrator of Mindgrinder, Chasey Chaos of Amen and Happy Tom from Turbonegro. He has one daughter with ex-wife Andrea Haugen. He remarried since his divorce and he also has a daughter with his wife Erin.

At the , Strahan had a population of 658. Port Originally developed as a port of access for the mining settlements in the area, the town was known as Long Bay or Regatta Point until 1877, when it was formally named after the colony‚Äôs Governor, Sir George Cumine Strahan.

The Strahan Marine Board was an important authority dealing with the issues of the port and Macquarie Harbour up until the end of the twentieth century when it was absorbed into the Hobart Marine Board. Post offices Macquarie Harbour Post Office opened on 16 May 1878, was renamed Strahan in 1881 and closed in 1891. East Strahan Post Office opened in 1891 and was renamed Strahan in 1893. Fishing and tourism Strahan port and fishing vessels Historically Strahan has been a port to a small fishing fleet that braves the west coast conditions and Hell's Gates. It is the nearest inhabited locality to Cape Sorell and is literally the 'gateway' to the south- west wilderness - as boats, planes and helicopters utilise Strahan as their base when travelling into the region. The Huon Pine industry utilised stands around the harbour and up the tributary rivers - including King River, the Franklin River and the Gordon River. Strahan is the location of the only all weather commercial airport in Western Tasmania, Strahan Airport. Also located at the airport is the Automatic Weather Station, an important western Tasmania weather observation point. Strahan is the base for boat trips to Sarah Island, the notorious penal settlement that garnered the reputation as the harshest penal settlement in the Australian colonies, and the lower Gordon River. Strahan is an access point to the Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park, which was declared part of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area in 1982. For several years Strahan became the focus of a conservation campaign opposed to the proposed Franklin-below-Gordon Dam. It is the home of the Round Earth Theatre Company, which conducts explanatory tours of Sarah Island and also has produced a daily enactment/play about Sarah Island, The Ship That Never Was, which has exceeded 5000 performances and is Australia's longest running play. Railway stopping place Strahan was a stopping place on the former Strahan to Zeehan railway. It was also known as Strahan Wharf. page 105 tickets were issues between 1892 and 1953, and 4th June 1960 was the closure date of the Strahan - Zeehand line Strahan was connected with the former Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company railway line that had a terminus at Regatta Point. The railway was government owned, and ran past the wharf at Strahan, and continued around the harbour before running north on its way to Zeehan. The formation of the railway line can be seen around the edge of the harbour. The northern shore of Macquarie Harbour is across the bay from Regatta Point, the terminus of the recently reconstructed, West Coast Wilderness Railway. Cultural references An extinct species of Banksia, fossils of which were found in sediment at nearby Regatta Point, was named Banksia strahanensis after the town. Climate Strahan has an oceanic climate (Cfb) with mild damp summers and cool, very rainy winters. Lying on Tasmania's West Coast, Strahan is frequently buffeted by low pressure systems from the Southern Ocean, causing heavy rain and gusty winds. Strahan receives 15.7 days, on average, of clear weather annually. Temperatures vary little between summer and winter, with minimums below having been recorded in every month. Hot weather is rare, with an average of only one day reaching or above every three years. The highest recorded temperature is on 14 February 1982, with the lowest recorded being on 30 June 1983. Snow down to sea level is rare but falls frequently in the mountains just a few kilometers inland of Strahan.

It is approximately 315 sq.km, and has an average depth of 15m, with deeper places up to 50m. The inlet is navigable by shallow- draft vessels. The main channel is kept clear by the presence of a rock wall on the outside of the channel's curve. This man-made wall prevents erosion and keeps the channel deep and narrow, rather than allowing the channel to become wide and shallow. A reported Aboriginal name for the harbour is Parralaongatek. The harbour was named in honour of Scottish Major General Lachlan Macquarie, the fifth Colonial Governor of New South Wales. History James Kelly wrote in his narrative First Discovery of Port Davey and Macquarie Harbour how he sailed from Hobart in a small open five-oared whaleboat to discover Macquarie Harbour on 28 December 1815. However, different accounts of the journey have indicated different methods and dates of the discovery. In the commentary to the Historical Records of Australia, the editor notes that T.W. Birch stated before the commission of inquiry into the state of the colony in 1820 that Kelly had discovered Macquarie Harbour after proceeding along in a boat from Port Davey where they had travelled in the schooner Henrietta Packet. Kelly gave evidence before the commission, and did not mention any discoveries. In a letter dated 11 April 1816, preserved in the record office, London, T.W. Birch transmitted an account of this voyage, which records the discovery of Macquarie Harbour on 26 December 1815. Charles Whitham notes variations on the date. Surveyor-General Oxley of New South Wales in March 1820 battled with the seas around the heads and Hells Gates. Surveyor-General Evans travelled in the area in 1821-22. In September 2020, almost 100 Pilot whales were rescued from the harbour after becoming stranded. An estimated 350 whales which were unable to be rescued died. Convict era The harbour was established as a prison which was a place of \\"extreme physical and mental torture\\" .Flannery, T.F. (1994) The Future Eaters: An ecological history of the Australasian lands and people Chatswood: New South Wales It was built for British convicts but many Irish patriots and Tasmanian Aborigines were also detained there.  Rivers  The King River which cuts through the West Coast Range and the Gordon River empty into Macquarie Harbour. The narrow entrance to Macquarie Harbour has hazardous tidal currents and is called Hell's Gates. Outside of the Harbour the entrance area is known as Macquarie Heads, and the most western point is Cape Sorell. The sheer volume of fresh water that pours into the Harbour through the rivers, combined with the narrow exit result in barometric tides. When there is rain in the mountains surrounding the Harbour, the tide rises, and it falls when the atmospheric pressure reverses and results in less rain. The Queen River, King River and Macquarie Harbour were all polluted by mine waste from the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company until its closing in 1994. It is estimated that 100 million tonnes of tailings were disposed of into the Queen River. The Mount Lyell Remediation and Research and Demonstration Program was carried out by the office of Supervising Scientist and the Tasmanian Department of Environment and Land Management over the following two years. The result of the program a marked reduction in the waste material entering the rivers and harbour. * Bird River - mouth of river in Kelly Basin * Braddon River - mouth on mid-eastern shore * Clark River - mouth at Pillinger, Kelly Basin. * Gordon River - mouth on south eastern end of harbour * King River - mouth at north east of harbour Islands Photo of the lighthouse on Bonnet Island, Hells gate, Tasmania (looking out from Harbour) Sarah Island in Macquarie Harbour.

Later the small port of Strahan was developed on the shores of Macquarie Harbour to support the nearby mining settlements, mainly Queenstown. Another port was developed on the south east section of the harbour in Kelly Basin along with townsite of Pillinger.

Location and features King river at entrance to Macquarie Harbour - the West Coast Wilderness Railway line passes from the right of this picture to enter the King River Valley at the left of photo. Delta of eroded material is typical at this location. Hell's Gates is at top of picture (out of view) and Strahan is to the right off photo. Photo hazy due to bushfires of January 2003. Formed by the confluence of the Eldon and South Eldon rivers, the King River rises near Eldon Range on the slopes of the West Coast Range between Mount Huxley and Mount Jukes. The river flows generally south and then west, joined by nine tributaries including the Tofft, Governor, Nelson, Princess, and Queen rivers before emptying into Macquarie Harbour near , and merging with the Southern Ocean. The river descends over its course. The upper section of the river lies in a glaciated valley, with glacier scouring scars high up on the upper parts of the mountains of the West Coast Range. Also small glacial lakes occur on and north of Mount Sedgwick. Lake Beatrice for instance lies on the eastern slope of Mount Sedgwick. The upper portion of the King River valley was first surveyed for damming in 1917 by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company.  King River Power Development Scheme  The river is impounded by the Crotty Dam to form Lake Burbury, covering over the former valley and named after the first Australian born Governor of Tasmania, Stanley Burbury. Water drawn from the lake is used to supply the conventional hydroelectric John Butters Power Station, operated by Hydro Tasmania. Below the dam wall, the river flows through a narrow channel as it flows west towards , in the last of the river, where extensive silting from the mine tailings that have been carried down from Queenstown, has created such a resource that at least one mining company has in the past proposed the mining of the deposits at the edge of the river, as well as the delta formed out into Macquarie Harbour due to the amount of economically viable materials in the silt. The small timber mill community adjacent to the old alignment of the Lyell Highway was submerged, as was a significant portion of the old railway alignment of the North Mount Lyell Railway between Linda and Pillinger. The site of the townsite of Crotty, and the smelters of Crotty were also submerged. =Queen River= King River gorge lower west end, from Abt Railway looking east The King River was considered to be Australia's most polluted river.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-24/fix-the-rivers-challenge- for-tas-phd-students/7874112 Mining started in the 1880s, with the Queen River, a major tributary of the King River, being used for waste water disposal from the Mt Lyell copper mine. Between 1922 and 1995 low grade ore was concentrated on site and the tailings (ore-washing residue) dumped in the river also. About 1.5 million tonnes of sulfidic tailings entered the river system each year up to 1995, along with huge volumes of acidic, metal-rich water flowing from the workings. This 'acid mine drainage' is derived from water leaching through the exposed and oxidised sulfide rocks. When it was in operation, the fumes from the ore smelter produced acid rain which also leached minerals from the bare Queenstown hills. In 1992 the King River was dammed above the confluence with the Queen River to generate hydroelectric power at the Crotty Dam. This changed the flow regime in the King River, and affected the way tailings were transported through the river system. The tailings in the river greatly affect the water quality. About 100 million tonnes of tailings have been deposited on the banks and bed of the King River and in a delta at the mouth of the river where it enters Macquarie Harbour. Since the closure of the mine in late 1995, and the construction of a tailings dam by the new operators, tailings no longer enter the river system. However, acid water continues to enter the river due to mine dewatering and run-off from the waste rock dumps. Without the buffering previously provided by the alkaline tailings, the acidity in the Queen and King rivers has increased, and dissolved metal concentrations have greatly increased-to levels highly toxic to aquatic life. =Abt Railway route= The north bank (except for the Teepookana to Quarter Mile Bridge section which was on the south bank) of the lower portion of the King River valley was the route for the old \\"Abt\\" rack railway to Queenstown. In 1962 the original builder and owner, the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Company closed and removed the line. This has been since restored in early 2002 for tourism purposes. The new line follows exactly the same route and is known as the West Coast Wilderness Railway.

Mafia-like groups offer a solution of sorts to the trust problem by playing the role of a government for the underworld and supplying protection to people involved in illegal markets ordeals. They may play that role poorly, sometimes veering toward extortion rather than genuine protection, but they do play it.\\" The term \\"mafia\\" derives from the Sicilian Mafia. Mafias often engage in secondary activities such as gambling, loan sharking, drug-trafficking, prostitution, and fraud. The term \\"mafia\\" was originally applied only to the Sicilian Mafia and originates in Sicily, but it has since expanded to encompass other organizations of similar methods and purpose, e.g., \\"the Russian Mafia\\" or \\"the Japanese Mafia\\". The term is applied informally by the press and public; the criminal organizations themselves have their own terms (e.g. the Sicilian Mafia and the related Italian-American Mafia refer to their organizations as \\"Cosa Nostra\\"; the \\"Japanese Mafia\\" calls itself \\"Yakuza\\"; and \\"Russian Mafia\\" groups often call themselves \\"Bratva\\"). When used alone and without any qualifier, \\"Mafia\\" or \\"the Mafia\\" typically refers to either the Sicilian Mafia or the American Mafia and sometimes Italian organized crime in general (e.g., Camorra, 'Ndrangheta, Sacra Corona Unita, Stidda, etc.). Etymology The word mafia () derives from the Sicilian adjective mafiusu, which, roughly translated, means \\"swagger\\", but can also be translated as \\"boldness\\" or \\"bravado\\". In reference to a man, mafiusu (mafioso in Italian) in 19th century Sicily signified \\"fearless\\", \\"enterprising\\", and \\"proud\\", according to scholar Diego Gambetta.This etymology is based on the books Che cosa √® la mafia? by Gaetano Mosca, Mafioso by Gaia Servadio, The Sicilian Mafia by Diego Gambetta, Mafia & Mafiosi by Henner Hess, and Cosa Nostra by John Dickie (see Books below). In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form adjective mafiusa means 'beautiful' or 'attractive'. Because Sicily was once an Islamic emirate from 831 to 1072, mafia may have come to Sicilian through Arabic, though the word's origins are uncertain. Possible Arabic roots of the word include: *ma'afi (ŸÖÿπŸÅŸä) = exempted. In Islamic law, Jizya, is the yearly tax imposed on non- Muslims residing in Muslim lands. And people who pay it are \\"exempted\\" from prosecution. *m√†ha = quarry, cave; especially the mafie, the caves in the region of Marsala, which acted as hiding places for persecuted Muslims and later served other types of refugees, in particular Giuseppe Garibaldi's \\"Redshirts\\" after their embarkment on Sicily in 1860 in the struggle for Italian unification.According to , \\"cave\\" in Arabic literary writing is Maqtaa hagiar, while in popular Arabic it is pronounced as Mahias hagiar and then \\"from Maqtaa (Mahias) = mafia, that is cave, hence the name (ma)qotai, quarrymen, stone-cutters, that is, mafia.\\" (Loschiavo 1962: 27-30). See: Fabrizio Fioretti (2011), Il termine \\"mafia\\", Sveuƒçili≈°te Jurja Dobrile u Puli.Mosca, Che cosa √® la mafia?, p. 51Hess, Mafia & Mafiosi, pp. 1-3Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, pp. 259-261.Coluccello, Challenging the Mafia Mystique, p.3 *mahyas (ŸÖŸáŸäÿßÿµ) = aggressive boasting, bragging *marfud (ŸÖÿ±ŸÅŸàÿ∂) = rejected, considered to be the most plausible derivation; marfud developed into marpiuni (swindler) to marpiusu and finally mafiusu.Lupo, History of the Mafia, p. 282 quoting Lo Monaco (1990), Lingua nostra. *mu'afa (ŸÖÿπÿßŸÅŸâ) = safety, protection *Ma √†fir = the name of an Arab tribe that ruled Palermo. The local peasants imitated these Arabs and as a result the tribe's name entered the popular lexicon. The word mafia was then used to refer to the defenders of Palermo during the Sicilian Vespers against rule of the Capetian House of Anjou on 30 March 1282. *mafy√°, meaning \\"place of shade\\". The word \\"shade\\" meaning refuge or derived from refuge. After the Normans destroyed the Saracen rule in Sicily in the eleventh century, Sicily became feudalistic. Most Arab smallholders became serfs on new estates, with some escaping to \\"the Mafia.\\" It became a secret refuge. The public's association of the word with the criminal secret society was perhaps inspired by the 1863 play ' (\\"The Mafiosi of the Vicaria\\") by Giuseppe Rizzotto and Gaspare Mosca. The words mafia and mafiusi are never mentioned in the play. The play is about a Palermo prison gang with traits similar to the Mafia: a boss, an initiation ritual, and talk of \\"umirt√†\\" (omert√† or code of silence) and \\"pizzu\\" (a codeword for extortion money).Gambetta, The Sicilian Mafia, p. 136. The play had great success throughout Italy. Soon after, the use of the term \\"mafia\\" began appearing in the Italian state's early reports on the phenomenon. The word made its first official appearance in 1865 in a report by the prefect of Palermo .Lupo, The History of the Mafia , p. 3. Definitions The term \\"mafia\\" was never officially used by Sicilian mafiosi, who prefer to refer to their organization as \\"Cosa Nostra\\". Nevertheless, it is typically by comparison to the groups and families that comprise the Sicilian Mafia that other criminal groups are given the label. Giovanni Falcone, an anti-Mafia judge murdered by the Sicilian Mafia in 1992, objected to the conflation of the term \\"Mafia\\" with organized crime in general: =Mafias as private protection firms= Scholars such as Diego GambettaDiego Gambetta (1993). The Sicilian Mafia: The Business of Private Protection and Leopoldo Franchetti have characterized the Sicilian Mafia as a \\"cartel of private protection firms\\", whose primary business is protection racketeering: they use their fearsome reputation for violence to deter people from swindling, robbing, or competing with those who pay them for protection. For many businessmen in Sicily, they provide an essential service when they cannot rely on the police and judiciary to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves (this is often because they are engaged in black market deals). Scholars have observed that many other societies around the world have criminal organizations of their own that provide essentially the same protection service through similar methods. For instance, in Russia after the collapse of Communism, the state security system had all but collapsed, forcing businessmen to hire criminal gangs to enforce their contracts and protect their properties from thieves. These gangs are popularly called \\"the Russian Mafia\\" by foreigners, but they prefer to go by the term krysha. In his analysis of the Sicilian Mafia, Gambetta provided the following hypothetical scenario to illustrate the Mafia's function in the Sicilian economy. Suppose a grocer wants to buy meat from a butcher without paying sales tax to the government. Because this is a black market deal, neither party can take the other to court if the other cheats. The grocer is afraid that the butcher will sell him rotten meat. The butcher is afraid that the grocer will not pay him. If the butcher and the grocer can't get over their mistrust and refuse to trade, they would both miss out on an opportunity for profit. Their solution is to ask the local mafioso to oversee the transaction, in exchange for a fee proportional to the value of the transaction but below the legal tax. If the butcher cheats the grocer by selling rotten meat, the mafioso will punish the butcher. If the grocer cheats the butcher by not paying on time and in full, the mafioso will punish the grocer. Punishment might take the form of a violent assault or vandalism against property. The grocer and the butcher both fear the mafioso, so each honors their side of the bargain. All three parties profit. =Mafia-type organizations under Italian law= Introduced by Pio La Torre, article 416-bis of the Italian Penal Code defines a Mafia-type association (Associazione di Tipo Mafioso) as one where \\"those belonging to the association exploit the potential for intimidation which their membership gives them, and the compliance and omert√† which membership entails and which lead to the committing of crimes, the direct or indirect assumption of management or control of financial activities, concessions, permissions, enterprises and public services for the purpose of deriving profit or wrongful advantages for themselves or others.\\"Seindal, Mafia: money and politics in Sicily, p. 20Art. 416-bis, Codice Penale - Associazione di Tipo mafioso International Mafia-proper can refer to either: *American Mafia *Sicilian Mafia (aka \\"Cosa Nostra\\") =Italy= Map of Italy's main criminal syndicates.

Historically part of Staffordshire, Sedgley is on the A459 road between Wolverhampton and Dudley, and was formerly the seat of an ancient manor comprising several smaller villages, including Gornal, Gospel End, Woodsetton, Ettingshall, Coseley, and Brierley (now Bradley). In 1894, the manor was split to create the Sedgley and Coseley urban districts, the bulk of which were later merged into the Dudley County Borough in 1966. Most of Sedgley was absorbed into an expanded County Borough of Dudley in 1966, with some parts being incorporated into Seisdon and Wolverhampton. Since 1974 it has been part of the Metropolitan Borough of Dudley. History Steam tram at Bull Ring, Sedgley, in the early 20th century The place name Sedgley was first mentioned in a 985 charter from King √Üthelred to Lady Wulfr≈´n, when describing the Wolverhampton border. The original Old English place name was 'Secg's lƒìah' ‚Äì Secg being a personal name (meaning sword-bearing man or warrior) and lƒìah meaning wood, glade or woodland clearing.David Horovitz ‚Äì The Place-Names of Staffordshire (2006) Sedgley was also mentioned in the Domesday Book, as an estate held by William Fitz-Ansculf, Lord of Dudley. Stephen Cox & Son Ltd, Iron & Steel & Safe Engineers of Sedgley; makers' plate on a safe displayed at the Black Country Living Museum Originally dotted with farming communities in the middle-ages, the village became industrialized as natural resources such as coal and limestone were exploited, and by the 18th century it was producing goods such as iron and brick. Sedgley expanded rapidly during the early part of the 20th century, partly in response to the development of the nearby Baggeridge Colliery, despite a depletion in raw materials and a general decline in industry. As industry continued to decline, much of the area became redeveloped, with residential suburbs now dominating the landscape. Many pre-1900 buildings in Sedgley survive to this day. They include Queen Victoria Primary School (1897), All Saints' Church (1805) and the early 19th century courthouse, now used as a public house. =Civic History= The ancient Manor of Sedgley consisted of nine villages; Sedgley, Gospel End, Cotwall End, Upper Gornal, Lower Gornal, Woodsetton, Coseley, Ettingshall and Brierley. In 1897, the villages of Coseley, Ettingshall and Brierley broke away from the Manor of Sedgley to form the Coseley Urban District, while Sedgley itself, Gospel End, Cotwall End, Upper Gornal, Lower Gornal, and Woodsetton were formed into the Sedgley Urban District. The entire area was part of the Wolverhampton Parliamentary Borough, created in 1832. The east of the Sedgley district was transferred into Dudley as long ago as 1926, to allow for the development of the Priory and Wrens Nest Estates, where new council housing was built to rehouse families from the slum clearances in central Dudley in the 10 years leading up to the outbreak of World War II in 1939. The Old Park Farm Estate was added in the early 1950s.Dudley Sedgley Urban District Council survived until 1966, when the majority of the area was merged into the Dudley County Borough, along with the Coseley and Brierley Hill districts. The Gospel End area, however, was merged into the Seisdon Rural District (later South Staffordshire), and the Goldthorn Park estate in the extreme north of the area was transferred into Wolverhampton. The Gornal villages are generally not considered part of modern-day Sedgley, nor is the bulk of Woodsetton. Gospel End is no longer even in the same county as Sedgley, having remained in Staffordshire. Neighbourhoods =Bull Ring= The central area of Sedgley, so named because it was originally the site of bull baiting before the sport was declared illegal in 1835. All signs of the actual ring were destroyed in about 1930 on the construction of a traffic island, but the traffic island is still known as the Bull Ring. The current Bull Ring is surrounded by a number of notable buildings. The Court House, built in the early 19th century, was originally the law court for Sedgley but is now empty despite their attempts of a succession of owners to keep in competitive with other local pubs. These law courts were relocated to a building at the nearby police station until the town's courts were declared redundant in 1988. The Red Lion is approximately the same age as the Court House, and was once the village prison. It is still connected to the Court House by a passageway, though this has long fallen into disuse. The Clifton was opened in 1937 as Sedgley's first cinema, and remained open until 1978, when it closed and was converted into a bingo hall before being taken over by JD Wetherspoon and converted into a public house in 1998. The White Horse was built in the 19th century and was refurbished in 2014. Since then it has been the liveliest pub in Sedgley. Monty's wine bar also opened in 1998 in what was once a food store. Presto opened a large supermarket on High Holborn in the town centre in 1987, on the site of a former filling station ‚Äì with a former public car park being incorporated into the supermarket. A year later it was re-branded Safeway, and in 2004 it was taken over by the Midcounties Co- Operative. This in turn closed in the April 2017 and was re-opened in August 2017 as an Asda following a major refurbishment. =High Arcal Estate= Situated to the south of the town centre. It was developed in phases on part of a large field between 1992 and 1996; part of the field has been retained as a public open space and play area. The estate consists of around 300 Housing Association houses, flats and bungalows. Three-bedroom houses are the most frequent type of property in the area. Most residents on the estate are tenants of their homes, while some have shared ownership or full ownership. High Arcal is the largest post-1970s housing development in Sedgley. =Cotwall End= Cotwall End is situated around the rural Cotwall End Valley, and is one of the nine historic villages of the Sedgley manor. A few pre-1900 buildings still exist, but the face of the area has changed dramatically since the Second World War by the construction of mostly upmarket detached houses in Cotwall End Road and Catholic Lane. Cotwall End Primary School has served the area since 1962, by which time most of the current surrounding houses had been built. The Sandyfields Estate between Cotwall End Road and Sandyfields Road was built in the late 1950s, and is similar in style and layout to the nearby Brownswall and Straits Estates. One of the few surviving buildings from the historic village of Cotwall End is Spout House Farm, which was built in the 18th century and remained in use for some 200 years, finally being abandoned during the 1970s. The farm house and buildings fell into disrepair over the next two decades but were restored in 2001 and converted into apartments. A nature reserve, Cotwall End Valley, was opened in the area by Dudley council in 1969. Since 2005 the Brockswood Animal Sanctuary, a non-profit making company caring for rescued animals, has operated from the nature reserve.Cotwall End Local Nature ReserveBrockswood at Cotwall End \\"Cotwall End LNR\\" Natural England. Retrieved 27 July 2020. =Brownswall Estate= Situated to the north of Cotwall End Valley, this private housing estate was developed by Coseley-based builders Joseph Webb between 1956 and 1959, consisting of semi-detached and detached houses and bungalows with either two or three bedrooms. Most of the homes on the estate are three-bedroomed semi detached houses. It is also served by a recreation ground which includes a large football pitch and at one stage also a playground. However, the playground was dismantled in 2000 after more than 10 years of continued vandalism and gradual loss of playing equipment, which had reduced its popularity with local children. =Northway= Situated north of Cotwall End towards the border with Wolverhampton. The development began in the mid 1950s on land to the north of Gospel End Road, gathered pace in the 1960s and was mostly completed in the 1970s (by which time some 1,000 houses had been built) to join up with Wolverhampton Road. Alder Coppice Primary School was opened on the Northway estate in 1967. Alder Coppice, designated a local nature reserve in November 2019, is next to the estate.\\"Sedgley residents welcome new nature reserve\\" Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council, 25 November 2019. Retrieved 21 August 2020. Also adjoining the estate is Sedgley Hall Park, built in the grounds of Sedgley Hall, a 15th-century house which was demolished in 1966. The park includes playing facilities for children, although some of the playing equipment was dismantled in the 1990s and 2000s due to vandalism. The centre of the Northway Estate features shops, a medical centre and public house called \\"The Cabin\\", which was part of the late 1960s phase of the estate. =Beacon Estate= The Beacon Estate was built by Sedgley UDC in the shadow of Beacon Hill during the 1920s and 1930s, with two small sections being added in the 1940s and 1950s. Some of the first houses built by Sedgley UDC were on the estate. During the early hours of July 28, 2012, Shane Watson, a 23-year- old man who lived on the estate, was found murdered in an alleyway on the estate. Two local men, Shylon Wishart and James Cartwright, were later convicted of Mr Watson's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment.Shane Watson murder: Two teenagers guilty Places of interest =All Saints' Church= All Saints' Church, Sedgley All Saints' Church is a parish church situated in the centre of Sedgley. The first records of the church date back to the Domesday Survey of 1086, but the current structure dates to the early 19th century. Paid for by the Earl of Dudley, the Neo-Gothic building originally had a seating capacity of over 1,000, but was later re-seated to hold 850. The organ which was fitted in the church on its completion had originally been in Westminster Abbey. The current church was built in 1805 and is located on the corner of Vicar Street and Dean Street, with the modern vicarage and church hall on the opposite side of Vicar Street. At the time, it was the only parish church in the large but relatively lightly populated parish of Sedgley, but the parish was later divided into five ecclesiastical districts, to cover the nine villages of the Manor. =Baggeridge Park= Sedgley Beacon Baggeridge Park is a country park located 1.5 miles south- west of Sedgley in Gospel End. Originally part of the Earl of Dudley's Himley estate, coal mining operations began on the site in 1902, with the opening of the Baggeridge Colliery. After its closure in 1968 the colliery was bought by Seisdon Rural District Council, and later granted country park status in 1970. Full reclamation of the land commenced in January 1981, with the park officially opened by Princess Anne in June 1983. It has so far been largely free of many of the problems which have become increasingly common across the rest of Sedgley since then. =Sedgley Beacon= Beacon Hill, one of several Beacon hills in England, is above sea level, one of the highest points in the West Midlands. It is well known for fossils. The hill was once the site where beacons were lit to warn local people of invaders. Sedgley Beacon Hill provides views across the Black Country, Cannock Chase and Birmingham to the east, and to the Wrekin, Clee Hills and Malvern Hills to the west; on very clear days it is possible to see the hills of North Staffordshire and Derbyshire, as well as the mountains of both North and South Wales. It is also possible to see another Beacon hill ‚Äì Barr Beacon, some 15 miles away. =Sarah Hughes Brewery= The Sarah Hughes Brewery founded in 1921 in a Victorian brew house and pub is situated in Bilston Street, Sedgley, attached to the Beacon Hotel. Education =Primary schools= * Queen Victoria Primary School ‚Äì built in 1897, situated in the town centre. The school was one of the first to take part in a government-sponsored initiative to extend school hours with additional programs beyond the traditional school day, aimed at making better use of public resources for community benefit. New classrooms were built in 2006 to replace mobile classrooms that had been at the school since the 1970s. The original 1897 building is still in existence, and an extension dating from 1931 is also still standing. Students from Queen Victoria mostly transfer to The Dormston School; situated adjacent to the Queen Victoria school site. The two schools often collaborate in enrichment programs for younger students such as the JSLA (Junior Sports Leaders Award) students attending the primary school to teach younger students. Queen Victoria students often use the Mill Theatre for school productions, notably the first production to take place under such circumstance was \\"A Spaceman Came Travelling\\" for the Millennium production. The school is a 3‚Äì11 school which includes a nursery unit which opened in the 1970s, when the school also opened to 12 year olds as part of a local education reorganisation. However, the school lost a significant number of its pupils to the new Alder Coppice and Cotwall End schools during the 1960s, which were built to accommodate Sedgley's rapidly growing population in the postwar years. There was also a senior school at Queen Victoria for pupils aged over 11 years until 1937, by which time Dormston School had opened nearby. The first and middle school buildings were connected in the early 1980s with the construction of a new administration area. The age range was altered to 3‚Äì11 from September 1990. * Cotwall End Primary School ‚Äì built in 1962, situated about half a mile west of the town centre. It provides a two-form entry for pupils aged 3‚Äì11 years. Originally a one-form entry school, it became a two-form entry school in 1971 following the completion of a new infant school building. Cotwall End originally had separate infant and junior schools (becoming a first and middle school in 1972), but merged in 1981 to form a single primary school, with the first and middle school departments reverting to infant and junior school when the leaving age was reduced from 12 to 11 after July 1990. * Alder Coppice Primary School was opened in 1967 and situated about a mile north-west of the town centre on the Northway Estate. The current headteacher is Dr Duncan Jones, who arrived in January 2006 to replace the retiring Mr David Cox, who had been at the school since April 1999. His predecessor was Mrs Barbara Carter. The school's previous headteacher, Mr Colin Gould, left in October 1995 for disciplinary reasons. Alder Coppice was put into special measures in December 1999 after OFSTED inspectors criticised the school's weak management of resources and lack of direction, but it came out of special measures 18 months later and is successful again. Doctor Duncan Jones took over from David Cox in January 2006. It was originally two separate infant and junior schools (5‚Äì7 and 7‚Äì11 respectively), with a nursery unit being added in the 1970s around the same time that the infant and junior schools became first and middle schools in September 1972. However, the first and middle schools merged to form a primary school in September 1988, and the two departments reverted to infant and junior in September 1990 when the age of secondary transfer was reduced from 12 to 11. * St Chad's Catholic Primary School is a Catholic primary school, although non-Catholic children are permitted to attend. The school opened in 1870 in a building attached to the church. Two teachers taught approximately 70 children. In 1876, the Victorian School was completed, but eventually became overcrowded. In 1954, work started on the New School. The first three classrooms opened in 1956. Later in 1962 the hall was added. After 1969, the old school became the Dining Room. Further classrooms were added in 1969 and 1973. All three school buildings remain on site, as does the church. It is situated about a quarter of a mile south of the town centre. * Straits Primary School ‚Äì built in 1968 to serve the (then) new Straits housing estate. It is situated about two miles south-west of the town centre. The current headmaster is Mr Len Haslehurst, who has there since April 2012. His predecessor was Mr Adrian Slack, who was at the school for 15 years. On Adrian Slack's arrival, the school had been placed into special measures by OFSTED inspectors who had criticised the school heavily under its previous management. It came out of special measures in 1999 and is now one of the strongest performing primary schools in the whole Dudley Borough. In September 1989, mobile buildings in the school grounds were used as accommodation for pupils who were starting the new Milking Bank Primary School just over the border in Dudley, as the new school building was not ready in time for the 1989/90 academic year. However, the Milking Bank pupils left the Straits site on 27 November 1989 when their new school buildings was opened. =Secondary schools= * Dormston School ‚Äì built in 1935, situated in the centre of Sedgley. Has expanded greatly since the late 1960s, and since 1996 has included a sixth form centre in partnership with Dudley College. Its status changed from secondary modern to comprehensive in 1975. The age range on its opening was 11+, before changing to 12‚Äì16 in 1972 and 11‚Äì16 in 1990. * High Arcal School ‚Äì built in 1961, situated about half a mile east of Sedgley in Woodsetton, and was a grammar school until becoming comprehensive in 1975. It had a sixth form until 1990. Sixth form facilities returned to the school in 2002, when the sixth form being run in partnership with Dormston School and Dudley College was extended to High Arcal. =Former schools= * Flax Hall Primary School ‚Äì opened in the 1950s but closed in 1989 due to falling pupil numbers. The school buildings survive and are now used as a community centre. * Tudor County Primary School ‚Äì opened in the late 19th century, served the community of Upper Gornal until its closure in July 1986. The school buildings were used as an adult education centre until their demolition in 1996, when the site was redeveloped for housing. Transport Due to its hilly geography Sedgley has never had a rail or canal link, although near its historic border with Kingswinford there was a halt on the railway between Stourbridge and Wolverhampton known as Gornal Halt which opened in 1925 and closed in 1932 after just seven years in use, although the line on which it was situated survived into the 1960s. However, it is served by bus routes to neighbouring areas such as Wolverhampton, Dudley, Bilston and Tipton. Crime Crime in Sedgley increased significantly during the 1990s and early 2000s, but has fallen in more recent years. In the ward of Sedgley (which includes the town centre, Brownswall, Northway and Beacon estates as well as some of the High Arcal Estate) it was not uncommon for more than 100 crimes to be reported in a single month ‚Äì with anti-social behaviour by teenagers being particularly rife, more often than not fuelled by alcohol or drugs. The police regularly had to deal with incidents at Dormston School involving pupils. However, by 2014 the number of reported crimes in the Sedgley ward has regularly fallen to less than 50 crimes in a month, with the final two months of 2013 seeing less than 40 crimes reported each month.

The lake environment is administered by the Lake Illawarra Authority, a New South Wales statutory authority established pursuant to the with the aim of transforming the degraded waters and foreshores of Lake Illawarra into an attractive recreational and tourist resource. Location and features Sunset over Lake Illawarra, 2008 Windang, 2008 Albion Park and Albion Park Rail Located south of the city of Wollongong, north of the city of Shellharbour, and northeast of Dapto, Lake Illawarra receives runoff from the Illawarra escarpment through Macquarie Rivulet and Mullet Creek, drawing from a catchment area of . With an average depth of , the relatively shallow lake, brought about because of infilling by sand which has been eroded from the surrounding catchments, covers a surface area of . At an elevation of , the maximum volume of water held in the lake is . The narrow tidal entrance to the Tasman Sea of the South Pacific Ocean is located at Windang. Before 2007 Lake Illawarra was frequently closed to the sea. The lake system received large amounts of nutrient and sediment from the catchment which tended to remain within the lake. Water levels within the lake also fluctuated greatly, affecting the local flora species. In July 2007 the Lake Illawarra Authority completed works on training the entrance of the lake to create a permanent opening to the sea. Located on the western shore of Lake Illawarra at Yallah is the natural gas-powered Tallawarra Power Station. The power station draws water from the lake for cooling purposes, and returns water to the lake via an onsite water management system that ensures water quality is maintained at levels above the catchment average. The lake's location within the sprawling Wollongong urban area means that Lake Illawarra is vulnerable to pollution and urban run-off. =Recreation= Lake Illawarra is popular for recreational fishing, prawning and sailing. On 12 January 2009, it is suspected a man was bitten by a bull shark whilst snorkelling at Windang, near the mouth of Lake Illawarra. Birds found at the lake include pelicans, cormorants, musk ducks, hoary-headed grebes, black swans, black ducks, grey teal ducks, herons, ibises and spoonbills. History The traditional custodians of the land surrounding what is now known as Lake Illawarra are the Aboriginal Tharawal and Wadi Wadi peoples. Lake Illawarra was a valuable source of food and spirituality. Burial sites and middens (shell and camp rubbish heaps) discovered at Windang and surrounding areas indicate that the Wadi Wadi used the area extensively and performed various corroborees and ceremonies in the area. The name Illawarra is derived from various adaptions of the Aboriginal Tharawal language words of elouera, eloura, or allowrie; illa, wurra, or warra mean generally a pleasant place near the sea, or high place near the sea, or white clay mountain. Matthew Flinders and George Bass called the lake Tom Thumb's Lagoon on Flinders' chart, named after their little boat the Tom Thumb, when they were there in March 1796. In Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history, Joseph Davis provides a wide-ranging environmental and historical biography of the lake and its foreshores. The book also contains many images and photographs depicting the lake. Davis edited John Brown of Brownsville: his manuscripts, letterbook and the records of Dapto Show Society 1857-1904 that deals with the man who did most to protect the vegetation of the lake islands, and he authored Gooseberry & Hooka: the island reserves of Lake Illawarra 1829-1947, the latter examining the records of John Brown and others and deals with the history of these two islands and how they survived to become nature refuges rather than recreation reserves.

It is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, and was founded in 1839. With the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, it forms part of the Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics. HCO houses a collection of approximately 500,000 astronomical plates taken between the mid-1880s and 1989 (with a gap from 1953‚Äì1968). This 100-year coverage is a unique resource for studying temporal variations in the universe. The Digital Access to a Sky Century @ Harvard project is digitally scanning and archiving these photographic plates. History Sketch of Harvard's Great Refractor telescope In 1839, the Harvard Corporation voted to appoint William Cranch Bond, a prominent Boston clockmaker, as \\"Astronomical Observer to the University\\" (at no salary). This marked the founding of the Harvard College Observatory. HCO's first telescope, the 15-inch Great Refractor, was installed in 1847. That telescope was the largest in the United States from installation until 1867. Between 1847 and 1852 Bond and pioneer photographer John Adams Whipple used the Great Refractor telescope to produce images of the moon that are remarkable in their clarity of detail and aesthetic power. This was the largest telescope in North America at that time, and their images of the moon took the prize for technical excellence in photography at the 1851 Great Exhibition at The Crystal Palace in London. On the night of July 16‚Äì17, 1850, Whipple and Bond made the first daguerreotype of a star (Vega). Harvard College Observatory is historically important to astronomy, as many women including Annie Jump Cannon, Henrietta Swan Leavitt, Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, Williamina Fleming, and Florence Cushman performed pivotal stellar classification research. Cannon, Leavitt and Cushman were hired initially as \\"computers\\" to perform calculations and examine stellar photographs, but later made insightful connections in their research. Publications From 1898 to 1926, a series of Bulletins were issued containing many of the major discoveries of the period. These were then replaced by Announcement Cards which continued to be issued until 1952. In 1908, the observatory published the Harvard Revised Photometry Catalogue, which gave rise to the HR star catalogue, now maintained by the Yale University Observatory as the Bright Star Catalogue.

As at the , the suburb had a population of 10,730. History The name Dapto is said to be an Aboriginal word either from Dabpeto meaning \\"water plenty\\", or from tap-toe which described the way a lame Aboriginal elder walked. The suburb was officially founded in 1834, when George Brown transferred the Ship Inn from Wollongong to Mullet Creek Farm, in an area now named in his honour as Brownsville. After an unsuccessful attempt at wheat growing in the 1850s, Dapto embraced the dairy industry. In 1887 the railway opened and a butter factory was established. This began a transformation of Dapto and the town centre shifted south to where the new station was located. The Australian Smelting Company's works were established on Kanahooka Road and employed over 500 men. A railway, operated by the Illawarra Harbour and Land Corporation Limited, connected the smelter with the Government railway at Dapto. By 1903 the Commissioner for Railways declared that Dapto was the most valuable station on the Illawarra line, its traffic being double that of Wollongong. The books John Brown of Brownsville (2012), Gooseberry and Hooka (2012) and Lake Illawarra: an ongoing history (2005) ‚Äì all written by Joseph Davis and published by the Lake Illawarra Authority ‚Äì contain much detail about Dapto's history. Dapto has a number of heritage- listed sites, including Horsley Homestead on Bong Bong Road. Population According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 10,730 people in Dapto. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.7% of the population. * 79.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 6.1% and Scotland 1.0%. * 89.2% of people spoke only English at home. * The most common responses for religion were Catholic 26.1%, No Religion 26.0% and Anglican 23.9%. Further information On Koonawarra Point is Mount Brown Reserve, a hill protected by a nature reserve for its important habitat. The eastern side and summit is owned by Tallawarra Power Station. Dapto used to be home to a smelting industry but this has now closed. Most of the town is residential with several commercial areas. The main one includes Dapto Mall, which is on the Princes Highway. A small area of the escarpment west of Dapto is protected as part of the Illawarra Escapment State Recreation Area, though not accessible to the public. The escarpment west of Dapto includes Mount Bong Bong, the site of an aeroplane crash when the controllers mistook Lake Illawarra for Botany Bay. A plaque commemorates this event in Dapto. Much of the land to the west is still used as farmland, though other ventures such as the shooting grounds exist. The land to the west is noticeably more hilly than the plain to the north of Wollongong. The South Coast line electric rail service terminated in Dapto prior to electrification being extended to Kiama in 2001. The area of Dapto west of this rail line, formerly pastoral land, has undergone significant expansion over the past 20 years. This area has become the fastest growing part of the greater Wollongong region and consists of a sprawling, medium-density suburbia known as Horsley, now officially a suburb in its own right. The Dapto Greyhound Racing Club, locally known as the 'Dapto Dogs', runs races every Thursday evening. The Dapto Canaries compete in the local Illawarra Rugby League. Dapto was once, during an episode of the ABC TV show The Aunty Jack Show, part of a parody of the nearby city of Wollongong. The lyrics of the Lucky Starr song \\"I've Been Everywhere\\" were changed so that, instead of listing a wide range of Australian towns, the song said \\"I've been to Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong, Wollongong,... Wollongong, Wollongong, Dapto, Wollongong\\". =Dapto Mall= Entrance to Dapto Mall Dapto Mall is fourth-largest shopping centre in the Illawarra region, after competitors Wollongong Central, Stockland Shellharbour and Warrawong Plaza. Dapto Mall features Big W, Woolworths and Coles and around 66 stores. =Dapto Ribbonwood Centre= The centre was Dapto's new community centre after relocating in 2001, it is named so after the species of tree that is planted in front. The local library is located on topmost floor of Level 1. It also hosts several conference rooms that can be hired out for a variety of events, ranging from private, small gatherings, to large social events, such as entertainment. The Ribbonwood Centre is also the home of CPSA Dapto Seniors a 'not for profit' community organisation and the largest senior citizen group in the Illawarra, its fortnightly meetings and many weekly activities take place in Heininger House. Heininger House was incorporated in the Ribbonwood Centre when the community centre was constructed in 2001. File:Dapto Ribbonwood centre north facade.jpgThe northern facade File:Dapto ribbonwood centre interior.jpgThe view from the interior of the library on Level 1 =Dapto Anglican Church= The Dapto Anglican Church centre is adjacent to the Dapto Mall and the Dapto Grayhound Racing Club; it has services running from three other sites including the St Aidens building, the hall of Dapto Primary School on a Sunday morning, and the St Lukes Brownsville building (which is historically listed and over 100 years old). There are six services held weekly, as well as children and youth activities on Friday nights, children's programs on a Sunday morning and during the weeks of the school holidays, 'Cafe Church' during the week, and many one-off activities. =Dapto Uniting Church= Dapto Uniting Church. Dapto Uniting Church is located in the heart of Dapto, next to the Dapto Medical Centre on the Princes Highway. Services are held at 9:30am every Sunday morning and incorporate both contemporary and tradition styles of worship. Children's programs are held during the Sunday service, Sunday's Cool, and mid-week on Wednesdays, Tiddlywinks playgroup. The Dapto Uniting congregation is a healthy community composed of people of all generations, cultures and backgrounds. The Dapto Uniting Church traces its roots right back to 1841 when Sunday services were first held in a Dapto schoolroom under the leadership of Presbyterian minister Rev. John Tait. With the establishment of the railway network in 1887, the Dapto area experienced a period of continued urban expansion over the ensuing decades. The current red brick building, St Andrews, was officially opened and dedicated on 7 February 1959. Construction work commenced in 1981 to attach new hall facilities to the existing church building. For many years, the Dapto Uniting family has sought to serve the local community, through ministries such as the Op Shop, regular Market Days, Family Fun Days and group Heart & Soul Exercise sessions. =St. John's Catholic Church= St. John's Church is the public worship centre of Dapto's Catholic population, and can be found in Jeramatta Street. Mass times are: Saturday Vigil Mass ‚Äì 5:00pm, and Sundays at 7:30, 9:30 and 6:00pm. Cups of tea may be had after every mass. It also has a new Youth Group. =Dapto Public School= The original Dapto Public School opened in August 1875, and was operated out of a local church hall. A permanent and more central location was opened on the corner of Byamee and Moombara Streets in 1928, which remained the schools' location until 2004. Due to large expansion of the Horsley area, the school relocated to Sierra Drive, Horsley, opening in 2004.

He is best known for his collaborations with writer Alan Moore, which include the miniseries Watchmen and the Superman story \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\". He was an artist for 2000 AD, for which he contributed a large body of work from its first issue in 1977. Early life Gibbons was born on 14 April 1949, at Forest Gate Hospital in London, to Chester, a town planner, and Gladys, a secretary. He began reading comic books at the age of seven. A self-taught artist, he illustrated his own comic strips. Gibbons became a building surveyor but eventually entered the UK comics industry as a letterer for IPC Media. He left his surveyor job to focus on his comics career. British comics work Gibbons earliest published work was in British underground comics, starting with The Trials of Nasty Tales, including the main cover illustration, and continuing in cOZmic Comics produced by Felix Dennis. =IPC Comics= Gibbons entered the British comics industry by working on horror and action titles for both DC Thomson and IPC. One of his earlier works was a 12-part comic-series titled Year of the Shark Men for D.C. Thomson's The Wizard magazine, in April 1976 ‚Äì July 1976\\"Year of the Shark Men\\" Retrieved on 22 May 2019 When the science-fiction title 2000 AD was set up in the mid-1970s, Gibbons contributed artwork to the first issue, Prog 01 (February 1977), and went on to draw the first 24 instalments of Harlem Heroes, one of the founding (and pre-Judge Dredd) strips. Midway through the comic's first year he began illustrating Dan Dare, a cherished project for Gibbons who had been a fan of the original series and artist Frank Hampson who, alongside Frank Bellamy, Don Lawrence and Ron Turner are well- liked and inspirational artists to Gibbons, whose \\"style evolved out of [his] love for the MAD magazine artists like Wally Wood and Will Elder\\". Working on early feature Ro-Busters (after Starlord merged with 2000 AD), Gibbons became one of the most prolific of 2000 AD's earliest creators, contributing artwork to 108 of the first 131 Progs/issues. He returned to the pages of \\"the Galaxy's Greatest Comic\\" in the early 1980s to create Rogue Trooper with writer Gerry Finley-Day and produce an early run on that feature, before handing it over to a succession of other artists. He illustrated a handful of Tharg's Future Shocks shorts, primarily with author Alan Moore. Gibbons was known, by sight but not by name, to readers of the short-lived IPC title Tornado. Whereas 2000 AD was said to be \\"edited\\" by the alien Tharg, Tornado was \\"edited\\" by superhero Big E, who as alter-ego Percy Pilbeam worked on the magazine. These characters appeared in photographic form within the comic, with Gibbons posing as both Big E and Pilbeam for the entire 22 issue run of Tornado before it was subsumed into 2000 AD. =Doctor Who= Gibbons departed from 2000 AD briefly in the late 1970s/early 1980s to become the lead artist on Doctor Who Weekly/Monthly, for which magazine he drew the main comic strip from issue No. 1 until No. 69, missing only four issues during that time. The Doctor Who Storybook 2007 (released Christmas 2006) features a story called \\"Untitled\\" which includes the name Gibbons in a list of great artists of Earth history. American comics work =1980s= Gibbons was one of the British comic talents identified by Len Wein in 1982 for American publisher DC Comics: he was hired primarily to draw \\"Green Lantern Corps\\" backup stories within the pages of Green Lantern. Gibbons' first DC work was on the Green Lantern Corps story in Green Lantern No. 161 (February 1983), with writer Todd Klein, as well as the concurrently released \\"Creeper\\" two-part backup story in The Flash #318‚Äì319. Gibbons drew the lead story in The Brave and the Bold No. 200 (July 1983) which featured a team-up of the Batmen of Earth-One and Earth-Two. With Green Lantern No. 172 (Jan. 1984), Gibbons joined writer Wein on the main feature while continuing to illustrate the backup features. In issue No. 182, Wein and Gibbons made architect John Stewart, who had been introduced previously in issue No. 87, the title's primary character.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 209: \\"Architect John Stewart was chosen as Green Lantern Hal Jordon's permanent replacement as guardian of space sector 2814 in this issue by writer Len Wein and artist Dave Gibbons.\\" Ceding the \\"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\\" backup features to various other individuals from No. 181, Gibbons last issue with Wein was issue No. 186 (March 1985). Gibbons returned to pencil the backup story \\"Mogo Doesn't Socialize\\" with Alan Moore in issue No. 188. While Marvel Comics reprinted some of Gibbons' Marvel UK Doctor Who work, Eclipse Comics reprinted some of his Warrior work and Eagle reprinted various Judge Dredd tales, Gibbons continued to produce new work almost exclusively for DC throughout the 1980s. For the 1985 Superman Annual No. 11, Gibbons drew the main story \\"For the Man Who Has Everything\\", again written by Alan Moore.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 214: \\"The legendary writer Alan Moore and artist Dave Gibbons teamed up once again with the just-as-legendary Man of Tomorrow for a special that saw Superman...held in the sway of the Black Mercy.\\" During 1985 and 1986, Gibbons' artwork graced the pages of several issues of both DC's Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe and Marvel's The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition. He was one of the contributors to the DC Challenge limited series and in December 1986, he contributed to Harrier Comics' Brickman No. 1 alongside Kevin O'Neill, Lew Stringer and others. Between May and August 1988, he contributed covers to The Phantom miniseries, inked Kevin Maguire's pencilled contribution to Action Comics No. 600, and produced the cover to Action Comics Weekly No. 601. Watchmen The cast of Watchmen, created in 1986 by Gibbons and Alan Moore. He is best known in the US for collaborating with Alan Moore on the 12-issue limited series Watchmen, now one of the best-selling graphic novels of all time, and the only one to feature on Times \\"Top 100 Novels\\" list. Gibbons' artwork in Watchmen is notable both for its stark utilisation of the formulaic comicbook nine-panel grid layout, as well as for its intense narrative and symbolic density,Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 220: \\"The story itself was a masterful example of comic book storytelling at its finest...Filled with symbolism, foreshadowing, and ahead-of-its-time characterization thanks to adult themes and sophisticated plotting, Watchmen elevated the super hero comic book into the realms of true modern literature.\\" with some symbolic background elements suggested by Moore, others by Gibbons. Initially pitched by Moore to use the Charlton Comics characters which had been purchased by DC Comics, Watchmen was re-tooled to feature new, analogue characters when it became clear that the story would have significant and lasting ramifications on its main players. Gibbons believes that his own involvement likely came about after the idea was already in its early initial stages. He recalls that he had: To complement the story, Gibbons remembers working on rough character designs which ultimately changed little in their final appearance from \\"the descriptions that Alan had provided,\\" trying to come up with \\"a classic superhero feel but be a little bit stranger ... a sort of operatic look ... an Egyptian kind of a look.\\" Gibbons lettered Watchmen and it was his lettering style that later served as one of two reference sources used by Vincent Connare when creating the controversial font Comic Sans in 1994. Gibbons has commented that \\"It's just a shame they couldn't have used just the original font, because it's a real mess. I think it's a particularly ugly letter form.\\" Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Watchmen \\"called into question the basic assumptions on which the super hero genre is formulated\\". DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed in 2010 that \\"As with The Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen set off a chain reaction of rethinking the nature of super heroes and heroism itself, and pushed the genre darker for more than a decade. The series won acclaim...and would continue to be regarded as one of the most important literary works the field ever produced.\\" Gibbons returned to Watchmen in 2008, producing the behind- the-scenes book Watching the Watchmen to tie into the release of the 2009 film. Watching the Watchmen is his take on the creation of the seminal work, and features a number of rarely seen pieces of artwork including sketches and character designs, as well as \\"stuff,\\" he says \\"that I just don't know why I kept but I'm really pleased I did.\\" Gibbons stated that \\"I'm basically thrilled with the movie, you know; it's been in the making for years. There have been proposals to make it ‚Äì some I was excited about, some I was less excited about. But I think the way that it finally has been made is just great. I honestly can't imagine it being made much better.\\" =1990s= Give Me Liberty No. 1 (1990) Art by Gibbons; story by Frank Miller From the start of the 1990s, Gibbons began to focus as much on writing and inking as on drawing, contributing to a number of different titles and issues from a variety of companies. Particular highlights included, in 1990, Gibbons writing the three-issue World's Finest miniseries for artist Steve Rude and DC,Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 246: \\"Writer Dave Gibbons and artist Steve Rude presented a three-issue miniseries...that proved the World's Finest team of Superman and Batman was still relevant.\\" while drawing Give Me Liberty for writer Frank Miller and Dark Horse Comics. He penned the first Batman versus Predator crossover for artists Andy and Adam Kubert (Dec. 1991‚ÄìFeb. 1992), and inked Rick Veitch and Stephen R. Bissette for half of Alan Moore's 1963 Image Comics series (1993). Rejoining Frank Miller in mid-1994 on Martha Washington Goes to War, the following year Gibbons wrote the Elseworlds title Superman: Kal for Jos√© Luis Garc√≠a-L√≥pez, melding Arthurian legends to the Superman mythos in an \\"out-of- continuity\\" tale set in an alternate DC Universe. In Marvel Edge's Savage Hulk No. 1 (Jan 1996), Gibbons wrote, penciled, inked, coloured and lettered \\"Old Friends\\", a version of the events of Captain America No. 110 from the point of view of the Hulk. In 1996 and 1997, Gibbons collaborated with Mark Waid and Jimmy Palmiotti on two issues of the Amalgam Comics character \\"Super- Soldier,\\"Manning \\"1990s\\" in Dolan, p. 279: \\"Super-Soldier (an amalgam of Superman and Marvel's Captain America) returned in his second Amalgam one- shot, by writer Mark Waid and penciller Dave Gibbons.\\" a character born from the merging of the DC and Marvel Universes after the events of the 1996 intercompany crossover DC vs. Marvel/Marvel vs. DC. Among many other covers, one-shots and minor works, Gibbons worked with Alan Moore again briefly on the latter's Awesome Entertainment Judgment Day miniseries, providing (variant) covers to all three issues, on the first issue of Kitchen Sink Press' The Spirit: The New Adventures revival and within the pages of the Alan Moore Songbook. He designed the logo for Oni Press in 1997. In 1999 he penciled and inked Darko Macan's four-issue Star Wars: Vader's Quest miniseries. =2000s= Gibbons was one of the artists on the Superman and Batman: World's Funnest one-shot written by Evan Dorkin and in December 2001 Gibbons collaborated with Stan Lee on Just Imagine... Stan Lee creating Green Lantern. Gibbons wrote Captain America issues #17‚Äì20 (Nov. 2003‚ÄìJan. 2004) for artist Lee Weeks. In 2005, he drew covers for JSA, as well as producing the complete original graphic novel The Originals, a black and white graphic novel which he scripted and drew. Published by Vertigo, the work is set in the near future, but draws heavily on the imagery of the Mods and Rockers of the 1960s. He wrote The Rann‚ÄìThanagar War six-issue limited series for DC Comics, one of four lead-ins to the company-wide \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, and returned to the Green Lantern Corps with the five-issue Green Lantern Corps: Recharge (Nov. 2005 ‚Äì March 2006), co-written with Geoff Johns, which spun off into an ongoing, Gibbons-written series in August 2006. Gibbons was involved in two series released by DC/WildStorm when DC acquired American rights to the IPC stable of characters. He provided cover artwork for the flagship title, Albion, the six-issue limited series written by Leah Moore and her husband, John Reppion and co-plotted by her father, Alan Moore. Gibbons wrote the Albion spin-off Thunderbolt Jaxon (April‚ÄìSept. 2006), with art by John Higgins. Gibbons provided covers for three issues of writers Kurt Busiek and Fabian Nicieza's run on Action Comics (issues #841‚Äì843) and co-penciled (with Ethan van Sciver) the Green Lantern: Sinestro Corps issue as part of the \\"Sinestro Corps\\" story arc. He contributed to the ongoing Green Lantern Corps title on issues #18‚Äì20 (May‚ÄìJuly 2007). Gibbons and Ryan Sook produced a Kamandi serial for Wednesday Comics in 2009.Cowsill, Alan \\"2000s\\" in Dolan, p. 338 In the late 2000s, he provided new alternative covers to IDW Publishing's reprints of his Marvel UK Doctor Who comics. =2010s= On 9 April 2011 Gibbons was one of 62 comics creators who appeared at the IGN stage at the Kapow! convention in London to set two Guinness World Records, the Fastest Production of a Comic Book, and Most Contributors to a Comic Book. With Guinness officials on hand to monitor their progress, writer Mark Millar began work at 9am scripting a 20-page black and white Superior comic book, with various artists appearing on stage throughout the day to work on the pencils, inks, and lettering. The artists included Gibbons, Frank Quitely, John Romita Jr., Jock, Adi Granov, Doug Braithwaite, Ian Churchill, Olivier Coipel, Duncan Fegredo, Simon Furman, David Lafuente, John McCrea, Sean Phillips and Liam Sharp, who all drew a panel each, with regular Superior artist Leinil Yu creating the book's front cover. The book was completed in 11 hours, 19 minutes, and 38 seconds, and was published through Icon on 23 November 2011, with all royalties being donated to Yorkhill Children's Foundation. In 2014 he was appointed the UK's first Comics Laureate, to act as an ambassador for comic books and their potential to improve literacy. Gibbons drew the 1950s variant cover for Action Comics No. 1000 (June 2018). Work in other media Works other than comics include providing the cartoon strip on the inside sleeve of Jethro Tull's 1976 album Too Old to Rock 'n' Roll: Too Young to Die!, background art for the 1994 computer game Beneath a Steel Sky and the cover to K, the 1996 debut album by psychedelic rock band Kula Shaker. In 1988, he did the cover art of album The Madness. In 2007, he served as a consultant on the film Watchmen, which was adapted from the book, and released in March 2009. Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars ‚Äì Director's Cut (2009) featured hand drawn art by Dave Gibbons.

It is a coastal region situated immediately south of Sydney and north of the Shoalhaven or South Coast region. It encompasses the cities of Wollongong, Shellharbour and the town of Kiama. The Illawarra region is characterised by three distinct districts: the north-central district, which is a contiguous urban sprawl centred on Lake Illawarra; the western district defined by the Illawarra escarpment, which leads up to the south-west fringe of Greater Metropolitan Sydney including the Macarthur and Southern Highlands regions; and the southern district, which is historically semi-rural (area undefined), yet now defined by increasing urbanisation.  Etymology  The word \\"illawarra\\" is derived from the Aboriginal Tharawal word \\"allowrie,\\" also sometimes spelled as \\"elouera\\" or \\"eloura.\\" According to A. W. Reed, the word is variously translated as \\"pleasant place near the sea\\" or \\"high place near the sea.\\" The prefix of \\"illa\\" is also known to mean \\"white clay;\\" with the suffix \\"warra,\\" sometimes spelled as \\"wurra,\\" meaning \\"mountain\\" in the local indigenous language. George Bass and Matthew Flinders were the first Europeans to visit the area, with Flinders recording that it 'was called \\"Allowrie\\" by the natives'. For the period around 1806, the region was called \\"Five Islands\\"; referring to the group of five islands off Red Point. In 1817 Governor Macquarie, referring to region, wrote: 'part of the coast known generally by the name of the Five Islands, but called by the natives \\"Illawarra\\".  Geography  Lookout from the Illawarra escarpment above Wombarra over the northern Illawarra plain viewing Austinmer, Thirroul, Bulli, Wollongong up to Port Kembla in the far. Illawarra Escarpment above Austinmer, showing Hawkesbury sandstone, Rainforest and Eucalyptus forest. A section of the Illawarra coastline, circa 1900 The region consists of a grassy coastal plain, narrow in the north and wider in the south, bounded by the Tasman Sea on the east and the mountainous, almost impassable Illawarra escarpment (forming the eastern edge of the Southern Highlands plateau) to the west. In the middle of the region is Lake Illawarra, a shallow lake formed when sediment built up at the entrance to a bay. The district extends from the southern hills of the Royal National Park in the north to the Shoalhaven River in the south, and contains the city of Wollongong, the fourth largest urban area in New South Wales. North of Wollongong the plain narrows to a small strip of land between the coast and the escarpment. At Coalcliff and Stanwell Park small valleys are formed allowing further settlement. To the south it widens, and becomes increasingly hillier before reaching Stockyard Mountain, a long divide between the main plain and the Jamberoo Valley, which stretches until it reaches Kiama. South of Kiama is Saddleback Mountain and south of that the Shoalhaven plains and the outcrop of Coolangatta Mountain. =Ecology= Ecologically, the coastal grassy region of the Illawarra is within the Illawarra Lowlands Grassy Woodland biome. Characteristic tree species in the region include Eucalyptus tereticornis, Eucalyptus eugenioides, Eucalyptus longifolia, Eucalyptus bosistoana and Melaleuca decora. Shrub species include Acacia mearnsii, Dodonaea viscosa and as well as the endangered orchard Pterostylis gibbosa.Illawarra Lowlands Grassy Woodland in the Sydney Basin Bioregion - profile NSW Government ‚Äì Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales) The wet elevated areas of the Illawarra, where rainfall exceeds 1300mm, are within the Southern Lowland Wet Sclerophyll Forests and Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests biomes which generally feature tall, compact eucalyptus forests 30m-60m tall and understorey that include moist shrubs, tree ferns, a few vines and a uninterrupted herbaceous groundcover.Southern Lowland Wet Sclerophyll Forests NSW Government ‚Äì Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests NSW Government ‚Äì Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)  Government administration  For the purposes of Australian federal elections for the House of Representatives, the Illawarra region is contained within the electoral Divisions of Cunningham, Whitlam and the northern tip of Gilmore. For the purposes of New South Wales elections for the NSW Legislative Assembly, the Illawarra region is contained within the electoral districts of Wollongong, Kiera, Shellharbour, Heathcote, and Kiama. For the purposes of local government administration, the Illawarra region is contained within the cities of Wollongong, Shellharbour and the Municipality of Kiama. *The City of Wollongong forms the northernmost boundary, ranging from Helensburgh to Lake Illawarra, with northernmost coastal suburb Helensburgh and southernmost suburbs including Windang, Yallah and Haywards Bay. *The City of Shellharbour is south of Wollongong City, and ranges from Albion Park Rail in the north, west to Macquarie Pass near the escarpment, south to Dunmore near the Minnamurra River, and bordered on the east by ocean stretching from Lake Illawarra, Warilla, Barrack Point and Shellharbour. *The Municipality of Kiama is south of Shellharbour City, and ranges from the Minnamurra River, west to Bald Hill, and south to about south of Gerroa. Economy The main industries in the area have traditionally been farming, coal mining and steel making. Australia's largest steel-works, BlueScope, operates at Port Kembla. The area, especially around Port Kembla and Wollongong, was once known for its mainly industrial jobs, but since the 1990s commerce has played an increasing role in the city, overtaking industry in many areas. Illawarra cattle were originally bred in Illawarra and are now Australia's 3rd largest breed in population. They are large dark red cows sometimes with white patches. They produce large amounts of high butter fat and high protein milk and are suited to the Australian climate. Coal mining has been a key part to the Illawarra's economy for over 200 years. Transport The Illawarra region is linked to Sydney by several passes and a motorway (Southern Freeway) and electric railway (see Illawarra railway line); to the west by the Illawarra Highway and Picton Road; and to the south by the Princes Highway. At Albion Park Rail the Illawarra Regional Airport serves the region.  Sport  = Rugby League Football = The Illawarra Steelers Rugby league Football Club played in the NSWRL rugby league competition, then the NRL, from 1982 to 1998, and currently forms one half of the St George Illawarra Dragons joint venture, who play four of their twelve home games at WIN Stadium in Wollongong. The Illawarra Steelers still field teams in the lower rugby league divisions. Many famous footballers, such as Bob Fulton, Graeme Langlands, Mick Cronin, Rod Wishart, Paul McGregor, Craig Fitzgibbon, Luke Bailey, Steve Roach, Garry Jack, Warren Ryan, and the Stewart brothers Brett and Glenn, have come from the Illawarra region. = Basketball = The Hawks have represented the region (previously known as the Illawarra Hawks and the Wollongong Hawks) since the foundation year of the NBL, 1979. They won the NBL championship in 2001 defeating the Townsville Crocs 2-1 in the best of 3 finals. They also finished as runners-up in 2005 and 2010 seasons. The team caught global attention when American teen sensation LaMelo BallLaMelo Ball announced on ESPN's show The Jump that he will be joining the Hawks through the NBL's Next Star program. In April 2020, LaMelo Ball and his business manager, Jermaine Jackson announced they had bought the Hawks. = Association football = The Wollongong Wolves participated in the now defunct NSL, winning back to back premierships in 2000 and 2001. The Wolves were not selected for the NSL's replacement, the A-League, and instead chose to compete in the New South Wales Premier League under the name Wollongong FC. The Wolves organisation collapsed in 2008, and was taken over by Wollongong Community Football Club. The Wolves have continued to play in the New South Wales Premier League. = Rugby union = The Illawarriors are a Rugby Union club that have contested the Shute Shield since 2007. = Cricket = Cricket has also been played in the Illawarra for at least one hundred and fifty years with the Keira Cricket Club being founded in 1862.

It was Waugh's first published novel; an earlier attempt, titled The Temple at Thatch, was destroyed by Waugh while still in manuscript form. Decline and Fall is based, in part, on Waugh's schooldays at Lancing College, undergraduate years at Hertford College, Oxford, and his experience as a teacher at Arnold House in north Wales. It is a social satire that employs the author's characteristic black humour in lampooning various features of British society in the 1920s. The novel's title is a contraction of Edward Gibbon's The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. The title alludes also to the German philosopher Oswald Spengler's The Decline of the West (1918‚Äì1922), which first appeared in an English translation in 1926 and which argued, among other things, that the rise of nations and cultures is inevitably followed by their eclipse. Waugh read both Gibbon and Spengler while writing his first novel.David Bradshaw, Introduction p. xviii Penguin 2001, Decline and Fall Waugh's satire is unambiguously hostile to much that was in vogue in the late 1920s, and \\"themes of cultural confusion, moral disorientation and social bedlam...both drive the novel forward and fuel its humour.\\"David Bradshaw xxv/xxvi introduction 2001 Penguin edition This \\"undertow of moral seriousness provides a crucial tension within [Waugh's novels], but it does not dominate them.\\"Ian Littlewood, The Writings of Evelyn Waugh Oxford, Basil Blackwell, 1983 Waugh himself stated in his 'Author's Note' to the first edition: 'Please bear in mind throughout that IT IS MEANT TO BE FUNNY.' In the text of the 1962 Uniform Edition of the novel Waugh restored a number of words and phrases which he had been asked to suppress for the first edition. The novel was dedicated to Harold Acton, \\"in homage and affection\\".Acton, Memoirs of an Aesthete, p. 203 Plot summary Modest and unassuming theology student Paul Pennyfeather falls victim to the drunken antics of the Bollinger Club and is subsequently expelled from Oxford for running through the grounds of Scone College without his trousers. Having thereby defaulted on the conditions of his inheritance, he is forced to take a job teaching at an obscure public school in Wales called Llanabba, run by Dr Fagan. Attracted to the wealthy mother of one of his pupils, Pennyfeather becomes private tutor to her boy, Peter, and then engaged to be married to her‚Äîthe Honourable Mrs Margot Beste-Chetwynde (who later becomes \\"Lady Metroland\\", and appears in Waugh's other novels).Vile Bodies: A Revolution In Film Art, Evelyn Waugh Newsletter, Winter 1974 Pennyfeather, however, is unaware that the source of her income is a number of high-class brothels in South America. One of the farcical elements of the plot is Pennyfeather's coincidental meetings with his college friend Potts who works for the League of Nations investigating human trafficking. Arrested on the morning of the wedding, after running an errand for Margot related to her business, Pennyfeather takes the fall to protect his fianc√©e's honour and is sentenced to seven years in prison for traffic in prostitution. Margot marries another man with government ties and he arranges for Paul to fake his own death and escape. In the end he returns to where he started at Scone. He studies under his own name, having convinced the college that he is the distant cousin of the Paul Pennyfeather who was sent down previously. The novel ends as it started, with Paul sitting in his room listening to the distant shouts of the Bollinger Club. Critical reception The Guardian, in 1928, praised the book as \\"a great lark; its author has an agreeable sense of comedy and characterisation, and the gift of writing smart and telling conversation, while his drawings are quite in tune with the spirit of the tale\\". The newspaper also compared the superficial presentation in the novel to that employed by P. G. Wodehouse.Decline and Fall by Evelyn Waugh (classics) The Guardian. 12 October 1928 Arnold Bennett hailed it as \\"an uncompromising and brilliantly malicious satire\\"Quoted in Martin Stannard(editor), Evelyn Waugh, the Critical Heritage, RKP 1984 and the writer John Mortimer called it Waugh's \\"most perfect novel ... a ruthlessly comic plot.\\" In his biography of Waugh, journalist Christopher Sykes recalled, \\"I was in a nursing home when Decline and Fall came out, and Tom Driberg visited me and brought a copy. He began to read out some favourite passages and was literally unable to read them to the end because he and I were so overcome by laughter.\\"Sykes, Christopher. Evelyn Waugh: A Biography. p. 85. In a 2009 episode of Desert Island Discs, the British actor and comedian David Mitchell named Decline and Fall as the book he would take to a desert island, calling it \\"one of the funniest books I've ever read\\" and \\"exactly the sort of novel I would like to have written\\".https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/b00ln1b2 In other media The novel was dramatised as the 1969 film, Decline and Fall... of a Birdwatcher starring Robin Phillips and also by Jeremy Front in a 2008 BBC Radio 4 production starring Alistair McGowan as Pennyfeather, Jim Broadbent as Grimes, Andrew Sachs as Prendergast, Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Fagan, Jonathan Kidd as Philbrick, Joanna David as Margot Beste-Chetwynde, Emma Fielding as Flossie, and Richard Pearce as Peter. In 2017 the BBC produced a three-part TV dramatisation starring Jack Whitehall as Paul Pennyfeather, David Suchet as Dr Fagan, Eva Longoria as Margot Beste-Chetwynde, Douglas Hodge as Captain Grimes, and Vincent Franklin as Mr Prendergast. The production was the book's first television adaptation, and received largely positive reviews. Alastair Mckay with the Evening Standard called it \\"delicately constructed and pitch- perfect.\\" Ellen E. Jones remarked on the show's \\"many enjoyable performances,\\" especially that of Hodge as the \\"drink-soaked deviant\\" Captain Grimes, adding, \\"Give him a spin-off series immediately.\\" Constance Watson, the great- granddaughter of Evelyn Waugh, found Whitehall's performance \\"funny\\", but said that his character occasionally came \\"across as smug, and his acting seems somewhat self-conscious\\", blaming his deficiencies on a crush on Longoria.

It was founded by Archie Bleyer, who had been the musical director and orchestra leader for Arthur Godfrey in 1952. Bleyer had written a few hot songs in 1932‚Äì34 (Fletcher Henderson's \\"Business in F\\" is a good example) and had a band that recorded for ARC in 1934 and 1935 (his records were issued on Vocalion, Melotone, Perfect and Romeo). The first recording star for Cadence was Godfrey alumnus Julius La Rosa. Other Godfrey alumnae signed to the label included the Chordettes. According to legend, Bleyer was fired from the Godfrey show when he signed someone Godfrey regarded as a rival to a record deal (Godfrey later fired singer Julius La Rosa in October 1954, causing a storm of controversy at the time). The label also produced the early hits of Andy Williams and the Everly Brothers, as well as Johnny Tillotson and Lenny Welch. Virtuoso jazz/classical pianist Don Shirley was signed with Cadence in the 1950s and 1960s. Candid Records was the company's short-lived jazz subsidiary. One of Cadence's most popular songs in the 1950s was \\"Eloise\\", written and sung by Kay Thompson. Cadence charted nearly 100 American singles between 1953 and 1964. It also produced the 1962 smash bestselling parody album The First Family, starring comedic actor Vaughn Meader. Acclaimed at that time as the fastest-selling album in history, this White House satire on the Kennedy family and Capitol Hill politics remained at #1 on the Billboard 200 for 12 weeks. Featuring Meader's impression of President John F. Kennedy, the sketch revue also included takes on First Lady Jackie Kennedy, newsmakers like Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and then Vice-President Lyndon Johnson. A sequel album, The First Family Volume Two, released in March 1963, reached #4. Both albums were immediately recalled and taken out of print following Kennedy's assassination in Dallas. The departures of the Everly Brothers in 1960 (to Warner Bros. Records) and of Andy Williams in 1961 (to Columbia Records), along with radical changes in public taste and the music business brought on by the British Invasion, led to the rapid decline of the company by 1964. Bleyer opted to shut down Cadenceand sold Williams' masters to the singer, which he bought mainly because he wanted to keep any other buyer (Kapp Records and Liberty Records were two companies mentioned interested in buying the Cadence catalog) from reissuing his old material in competition with his new material. Bleyer wanted Williams to buy the entire Cadence catalog, which he did. Williams reissued his old albums on Columbia and formed Barnaby Records to manage the Cadence catalog.

History and facilities Despite being called \\"Elstree Studios\\", only one studio has ever been located in Elstree itself, the remainder residing in the adjacent town of Borehamwood. When the studios were being established, Elstree was significantly larger than Borehamwood. Nowadays, Borehamwood is larger, but the old names have remained in use. The civil parish that contains the town was called \\"Elstree\\". The local railway station was originally known as \\"Elstree\\" (nowadays, it is called \\"\\"). The local telephone exchange was also called \\"Elstree\\". =Eldon Avenue Studios, Borehamwood= The Neptune Film Company opened the first studios in Borehamwood in 1914. Production ceased during 1917, and the studio was sold to the Ideal Film Company who used the site up until 1924. During 1928, the studio was sold to Ludwig Blattner who connected it to the electricity mains and introduced a German system of sound recording. The Blattner Studio was leased to Joe Rock Productions during 1934, which purchased the site two years later. Rock Productions built four new large stages. The site was again sold, and taken over by the British National Films Company between 1939 and 1948, although during this period a large portion of the studio was taken over by the British government for war work. During 1953, the studios were bought by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., mainly for television production and were later sold to Lew Grade's Associated Television (ATV). The Eldon Avenue centre became the main television production hub for ATV. The smaller Studios A and B were used for schools and sitcoms, while Studio C was a drama studio. Studio D, with permanent audience seating, was used for light entertainment programmesBarfe Turned Out Nice Again, p.108 such as the ATV Morecambe and Wise series Two of a Kind (1961‚Äì68) and The Muppet Show (1976‚Äì81).Brian Jay Jones Jim Henson: The Biography, London: Random House, 2013, p.126 When ATV was restructured as Central Independent Television in 1982, one of the conditions of its licence renewal by the governing body of the ITV network, the Independent Broadcasting Authority, was that ATV should leave any London-centric facilities and become more focused on the Midlands, the part of the United Kingdom to which it broadcast ITV programmes. They remained in operation by Central up until July 1983. The BBC bought the Elstree site in 1984 to produce its new soap opera EastEnders (first aired on 19 February 1985). In addition to EastEnders, many other programmes have been made there including Top of the Pops, 'Allo 'Allo!, You Rang, M'Lord?, Grange Hill, Hangar 17 and Holby City. =Elstree Studios, Shenley Rd, Borehamwood= The Main Gate entrance at Shenley Road (late 1990s). British National Pictures Ltd. purchased of land on the south side of Shenley Road and began construction of two large film stages in 1925. The first film produced there was Madame Pompadour (1927). The company was renamed British International Pictures (BIP) and a second stage was ready for production in 1928. Alfred Hitchcock made Blackmail (1929), the first British talkie at the studios in 1929. At the end of the silent-film era, six new sound stages were built; three of these were sold to the British & Dominions Film Corporation. BIP became Associated British Picture Corporation (ABPC) in 1933. During World War II, the studios were used by the War Office for storage.Warren, p.71 In 1946, Warner Brothers acquired a substantial interest in ABPC, appointed a new board and decided to rebuild the stages. In 1969, EMI gained control of ABPC and the studios were renamed EMI-Elstree Studios.Warren, p.76 In 1969, Bryan Forbes was appointed head of production of the film studio (see EMI Films). His tenure was short-lived and marked by financial problems, brought about by deliberately withheld funding and failed projects. Forbes resigned in 1971.Batty D. Bryan Forbes, acclaimed film director, dies aged 86. The Guardian. 8 May 2013. Retrieved 9 May 2013 During the period 1970‚Äì73, when EMI had a short-lived production and distribution deal with the American Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film studio, the facilities were known as the EMI-MGM Elstree Studios. In 1974, Andrew Mitchell took over from Ian Scott as managing director of the studios but was almost immediately told to close the facility and lay off all the staff. This was halted, but only with significant job cuts and closure of some facilities. The studio's immediate survival was secured through the facilities being used for Star Wars (1977). This led to subsequent Lucas productions such as the Star Wars sequels and Indiana Jones franchise being made at Elstree and also brought in directors Steven Spielberg and Jim Henson. In 1979, Thorn Electrical Industries merged with EMI after EMI's debacle with its invention of the CT Scanner, and the studios were renamed Thorn-EMI Elstree Studios. The studios were put up for sale in 1985. Acquired by the entertainment and property company Brent Walker, most of the backlot and several facilities were demolished to build a Tesco superstore. A \\"Save Our Studios\\" campaign led to the site being purchased by Hertsmere Borough Council in February 1996 and management company, Elstree Film & Television Studios Ltd was appointed to run the studios in 2000. Stages at Elstree Studios. The studios at Shenley Road are used for both film and television production, and the studios are the temporary home of BBC Studios and Post Production during the redevelopment of Television Centre. Shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and Pointless are recorded there. =Station Road Studios, Borehamwood= A single large stage was built in Station Road in 1928 by Whitehall Films Ltd, but the company was wound up in 1930. In 1935, Julius Hagen, the owner of Twickenham Studios, bought the site and formed a new company, JH Studios. Financial difficulties forced Hagen to sell the studios to MP Productions in 1937. During World War II, the studio was used by the government for storage. In 1950, the site was bought by J. Arthur Rank, who renamed it Gate Studios and made religious films. Production ceased in 1957, and the site was sold to Andrew Harkness, a manufacturer of cinema screens. Harkness Screens moved out of the site in 2004 having established a global manufacturing base in France and the US and relocated its UK operation to a new production facility in Stevenage. The building in Borehamwood was demolished in 2006 to make way for apartments new properties, the development being named Gate Studios in homage to the former site. =British and Dominion Studios, Borehamwood= 1936\\\\. Fire destroys three stages of British and Dominion Studios. From the Illustrated London News 15 February 1936 In 1930, British and Dominion bought three new sound stages from British International Pictures Ltd on the adjoining site before their construction was completed. Alexander Korda made one of his greatest successes at the studio, The Private Life of Henry VIII (1933), which starred Charles Laughton as the King. The film's success in the United States and elsewhere persuaded United Artists and The Prudential to invest in Korda's proposed Denham Film Studios.Patricia Warren British Film Studios: An Illustrated History, London: B.T. Batsford, 2001, p.26, 28 Film production continued until 1936 when fire destroyed the three stages.\\"British Film Studios at Elstree Destroyed in $2,250,000 Blaze\\". Calgary Daily Herald. 10 February 1936. p. 9. British and Dominion made a substantial investment in Pinewood Studios and moved production to Iver Heath, Buckinghamshire. The support buildings that remained after the fire were sold off to various companies including Frank Landsdown Ltd, which opened a film vault service. The Rank Organisation bought the music stage for the production of documentary films. It later became the headquarters of the film and sound-effect libraries. =MGM British, Borehamwood= Amalgamated Studios Ltd constructed a large studio on the north side of Elstree Way between 1935 and 1937, but its plans collapsed and the facility was soon sold to Rank, who never used it for making films. After a brief period owned by the Prudential, the studios were purchased by the American film studio Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1944 and was renamed MGM- British Studios. After improvements the studio contained seven stages totalling over of floor space. MGM sometimes leased the studios to other film companies including the 20th Century Fox-produced The Inn of the Sixth Happiness (1958), for which a large set of a Chinese town, complete with artificial lakes, covering some 500,000 square feet, was constructed.Warren, p.85 Several stages were taken up with the sets for 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) over its extended production schedule, and indeed Stanley Kubrick's film is sometimes blamed for making the studios financially unviable. The facility continued to be used until 1970 when MGM closed the studios. The American company formed a short-lived deal with EMI, while the site of its former studios was redeveloped for industrial use and housing. =Danziger Studios, Elstree= In 1956 the Danziger brothers converted a wartime plane engine testing factory into a studio they called New Elstree,Tise Vahimagi \\"Danzigers, The\\", BFI screenonline which was located to the west of the Aldenham reservoir. It was used mainly for television production and second features, but was closed by 1962 and sold in 1965. =Millennium Studios, Elstree Way, Borehamwood= Established in 1993, the Millennium Studios on the south side of Elstree Way offered television and film production space together with associated services. Millennium Studios have now relocated to Thurleigh near Bedford. =Sky Studios Elstree= In December 2019, media conglomerate Sky announced plans to develop a new studio facility at Rowley Lane. The new studios are expected to open in 2022, and to have 14 stages with the smallest being approximately . The site is also expected to house post- production facilities and an on-site screening cinema.

Early life Bleyer was born in the Corona section of the New York City borough of Queens. His father was a well-known trumpet player who had played with the Metropolitan Opera.\\"Musician Archie Bleyer, Fired By Godfrey.\\" Los Angeles Times, March 22, 1989, p. 20 The younger Bleyer began playing the piano when he was only seven years old. In 1927 he attended Columbia College, intending to become an electrical engineer, but as a sophomore switched to a music major. Without graduating, he left to become an arranger.Andy Rooney, \\"Bleyer Was Musician's Musician.\\" Marietta (GA) Journal, March 29, 1989, p 6 In the early 1930s, Bleyer wrote a number of songs that were recorded; all 'hot' novelty numbers, including \\"Mouthful O'Jam\\", \\"Business In F\\" and \\"Business In Q\\". In 1934, he began to lead his own band at Earl Carroll's club in Hollywood, California. Bleyer's orchestra recorded for Vocalion Records in 1934 and in 1935 moved to the ARC group of labels (Melotone, Perfect, Romeo, Oriole). One of the vocalists who worked with this orchestra was Johnny Mercer, who later became known as a songwriter and co-founder of Capitol Records. In 1945, Bleyer began a collaboration on the CBS radio network as the orchestra conductor for the popular Gordon MacRae Show. Included among the instrumentalist who appeared with his orchestra was John Serry Sr., who emerged in later years as a leading orchestral accordionist. The Godfrey years He became Arthur Godfrey's musical director in 1946, remaining in this role until 1953. Many close to Godfrey considered Bleyer's creativity and understanding of music to be pivotal to the success of Godfrey's radio and TV programs. And while Godfrey was known to be short-fused and controlling, he often deferred to Bleyer's judgment in the areas of presentation and production. Bleyer founded Cadence Records in 1952. The label's first artist was Julius La Rosa, a member of the Godfrey cast along with vocalists Janette Davis, Frank Parker, Marion Marlowe and the integrated vocal group The Mariners. At the time, La Rosa was the show's most popular cast member. Along with several instrumental hit singles of his own, Bleyer signed many other artists who had performed on Godfrey's programs including The Chordettes, one of whose members, Janet Ertel, became his wife in 1954.\\"Archie Bleyer to Wed Singer.\\" New York Times, November 9, 1954, p. 23 In the fall of 1953, Godfrey dismissed La Rosa on the air and later claimed the young singer \\"lacked humility\\", which heavily damaged Godfrey's popularity. La Rosa had hired a personal manager, going against an unofficial Godfrey policy. That same day, Godfrey fired Bleyer, apparently offended when Bleyer recorded spoken recitations by Chicago radio personality Don McNeill, host of Don McNeill's Breakfast Club. This long-running Godfrey- like show was based in Chicago and broadcast nationally, but its popularity was mainly in the Midwest and tailored to that audience. Always insecure, Godfrey felt McNeill, whose show had once been a competitor, was still in competition though Godfrey was the dominant personality of his generation. Godfrey later claimed when he confronted Bleyer and threatened to fire him from at least one of the three shows Godfrey hosted, the conductor shrugged and told him to do what he had to do.'' Radio historian John Dunning has suggested, in On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, that Bleyer's relationship with Janet Ertel was also a factor in Godfrey's decision to fire him; Godfrey tried to enforce a no-dating policy among his cast and fired several who dated each other. After leaving the show, Bleyer never made a public comment about his days with Godfrey. The public furor that surrounded LaRosa's firing and, to a lesser extent, Bleyer's, began the slow unraveling of Godfrey's seemingly unstoppable dominance of radio and TV as Bleyer's career was just beginning to blossom. The loss of Bleyer's expertise in staging and production matters, where he served as an informal mentor to Godfrey despite their age differences, was detrimental to Godfrey's programs. Cadence Records While LaRosa was unable to sustain his early successes, later Cadence artists included Andy Williams and the label's biggest act of all, The Everly Brothers whose hits such as \\"Bye Bye Love\\" and \\"Wake Up Little Susie\\" were produced by Bleyer in Nashville with country studio musicians led by Chet Atkins. Bleyer circa 1963 was also the step father-in-law of Phil Everly. He had his own instrumental recording hits on the Cadence label as well. Don Shirley appeared on the label in 1955 with \\"Tonal Expressions\\". It became a Top 15 album in the spring of that year, reportedly selling more than 20,000 copies, a respectable debut for a jazz artist. It was the only chart album Shirley was to enjoy, but his sales remained steady enough that he was with the label until it closed in 1964, recording more than a dozen long-play releases.Don Shirley Discography Bleyer also had his limits to his tolerance for rock and roll. While he clearly, and correctly, viewed the Everlys as a commercially appealing, clean-cut act whose country-influenced harmonies could reach a vast following, he was not so tolerant of pioneer garage-rock guitarist Link Wray. In 1957, Bleyer reluctantly agreed to release his no- frills, roaring instrumental \\"Rumble\\" on Cadence in part due to his daughter's fascination with the song. Wray had a contract with Cadence, but in 1958 after he submitted a newly recorded album of similarly raw material recorded in Nashville, Bleyer was convinced the instrumental music was morally and musically inappropriate and shelved the album and canceled Wray's contract. The material wouldn't see the light of day for decades until it was acquired by the British Rollercoaster label. Cadence had a short-lived jazz subsidiary, Candid, which lasted for about a year from 1960 (it was reactivated under new owners several decades later). Cadence had another major hit in 1962 with comic Vaughn Meader's album The First Family, which featured Meader's comedic sketches and his peerless impersonations of President John F. Kennedy. The album was an enormous seller, as was a followup, until Kennedy was assassinated in 1963. Cadence always maintained a small roster of artists. Other Cadence hits included 14 chart hits by Johnny Tillotson, ten by The Chordettes, four by Lenny Welch, and two by Don Shirley. In 1964, Bleyer, who was unable to accept the changing pop music market at the dawn of the British Invasion era, sold the Cadence label and all its recordings (except for certain material which he kept to himself, like the Link Wray album). The buyer was Cadence artist Andy Williams, who formed Barnaby Records to manage the Cadence catalog. Bleyer moved with his wife Janet to her hometown of Sheboygan, Wisconsin, where he died in 1989 of the effects of Parkinson's disease.'Archie Bleyer, 79, Music Director, Dies,' New York Times, March 21, 1989 Bleyer was a freemason, and a member of St. Cecile Lodge No. 568, New York City.

Wadcutters have also found favor for use in self-defense guns, such as .38 caliber snubnosed revolvers, where, due to short barrel lengths, maximum bullet velocities are usually low, typically under 900 ft/s (274 m/s), and improved lethality is desired. Wadcutters are often used in handgun and airgun competitions. Bullet profile .38 Special wadcutters loaded cartridges, 148 grain hollow- base wadcutter bullet and target showing the clean round holes A wadcutter has a flat or nearly flat front that is typically as wide as the caliber size or only slightly smaller in diameter than caliber size. For target shooting, a wadcutter cuts a very clean hole through the paper target, making it easier to score and ideally reducing errors in scoring the target in the favor of the shooter. Because the flat nosed bullet is not well suited for feeding out of a magazine, wadcutters are normally used only in revolvers or in specially designed semi-automatic pistols, although this is not always the case as some wadcutters may have rounded bullet nose profiles. Types of firearm wadcutters Keith-Style SWC with one crimping groove and one filled lubrication groove. In practice, the bullet can be crimped over the leading band, or on the crimping groove, as desired.A variety of wadcutter types exist: HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter), DEWC (Double-ended wadcutters), BBWC (Beveled-Base Wadcutters), and SWC (Semi-Wadcutters). HBWC rounds are best used at only the lowest velocities, as by being hollow at the rear end, they can split under heavy loads. DEWC rounds are best suited for automatic press reloading uses, as they may be used when loaded with either end pointed forward. BBWC have been developed to permit easier bullet insertion into the case when reloading. SWC rounds were developed to permit them to be loaded in either semi-automatic pistols or revolvers, where the rounded bullet shape often works better with feed ramps on semi-automatic pistols, and they are often used for heavy loads intended either for hunting or for self-defense. Some SWC bullet designs have a smaller diameter rear end, making these bullets suitable for use with gas checks. Properly lubricated SWC bullets with gas checks are suitable for use at velocities exceeding 1700 ft/s (518 m/s), the gas check reducing leading within the bore. =Accuracy= The maximum accurate distance of wadcutters varies considerably with the shape of the front of the bullet. Full caliber diameter wadcutters are suitable for use only at short ranges, typically not being used at ranges exceeding 25 yards where accuracy is especially desirable. At distances beyond 50 yards, full caliber diameter wadcutters become highly inaccurate. On the other hand, SWC bullets can maintain high accuracy at ranges exceeding 100 yards. In general, semi-wadcutters having a partially rounded nose are more accurate than wadcutters having a flat-front profile. In contrast, flat-front profile wadcutters tend to have improved lethality for hunting or self-defense purposes. =Lubrication and bullet crimping= Lead wadcutters require proper lubrication to prevent leading (buildup of lead deposits) of rifling and forcing cones when used in firearms. With proper lubrication, no leading for solid lead wadcutters occurs until velocities exceed approximately 940 ft/s. Without proper lubrication, however, severe leading can occur quickly, in as few as a couple of rounds. Most DEWC, BBWC, HBWC, and SWC bullets have 1, 2, or 3 lubrication grooves, with or without an additional 1 or 2 crimping grooves. (Having two crimping grooves is sometimes seen in dual-use bullets, such as intended for use with both .38 Special and .357 Magnum cartridges, or, similarly, for use with both .44 Special and .44 Magnum, in instances where overall cartridge lengths may need to be set differently so as to achieve the highest accuracy.) Used in revolvers, wadcutters must be roll crimped. Used in semi-automatic pistols, wadcutters must be taper crimped. Used in single-shot firearms (e.g., Thompson Center Contender or Encore), no crimping is absolutely required, but higher velocities may be achieved with either a roll or taper crimp, depending on cartridge, to permit pressure to rise higher before the bullet is released from the brass case. =Indoor wadcutters= Wadcutter bullets for center-fire firearms often have a modified profile with a reduced-diameter central point or rounded section. This was developed to allow the use of wadcutter bullets without causing excessive damage to the rubber anti-splashback curtain on indoor ranges. This profile produces a clean cut without tearing of the paper on the paper target for scoring but will only partially deform a rubber curtain and rebound before penetrating enough to cut the surface of the rubber mat. =Bullet loading techniques= Wadcutters can be loaded flush with the brass case opening or they may be set to extend out of the brass case, depending on what provides the most accuracy; the desired powder capacity of the case; or other desired criteria. Both varieties of wadcutters (flush, or non-flush) are commercially available. Although primarily intended for target practice, wadcutters can be used for close-in self-defense and hunting because their sharp edges and close-range accuracy are claimed to increase lethality. Leading effects Wadcutters are typically made from lead. Deposition of lead into the rifling grooves of barrels and into the forcing cones of revolvers limits the maximum usable velocity of wadcutters to less than about 900 ft/s. A Modern solution to leading at higher velocities is powder coating the lead projectile, encasing it in a protective shell. Shots fired at higher velocities may cause severe leading of the rifling and of the forcing cone, introducing a potentially dangerous condition from overpressure if FMJ (Full Metal Jacket) bullets are subsequently fired without first removing the lead buildup. Either a mechanical lead removing tool (i.e., a Lewis Lead Remover or a generic equivalent) and/or chemical removal techniques may be used to remove the lead build-up caused from shooting wadcutters at too high a velocity. Air rifle and pistol wadcutters A typical 4.5 mm (.177 in) match diabolo air gun pellet, in the HBWC (Hollow Base Wadcutter) configuration Target airguns used for 10 metre air rifle and 10 metre air pistol competitions generally shoot wadcutter pellets at muzzle velocities around . The use of wadcutter match diabolo pellets is nearly universal in airgun target shooting where paper targets are used, at distances of 25 meters or less.

It is traditionally very long, up to 21 inches (50 cm), and sold rolled in a flat, circular coil, but within western Cumbria, it is more often served in long, curved lengths. Seasonings are prepared from a variety of spices and herbs, though the flavour palate is commonly dominated by pepper, both black and white, in contrast to more herb-dominated varieties such as Lincolnshire sausage. Traditionally no colourings or preservatives are added. The distinctive feature is that the meat is chopped, not ground or minced, giving the sausage a chunky texture. In March 2011, the \\"Traditional Cumberland sausage\\" was granted Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status. History The Cumberland sausage has been a local speciality in the area for around 500 years. How the Cumberland sausage came to acquire its special shape and taste is not known. Historically, the sausage was more highly seasoned than it is today, reflecting a strong influx of spices into Whitehaven during the 18th century. During this time, Cumbria was introduced to ginger, black pepper, and nutmeg, as well as other foodstuffs such as molasses, sugar, and rum. Many of these ingredients have been incorporated into some of Cumbria's local specialities, such as the spicy Cumberland sausage. Ingredients Cumberland sausage is typically filled with chopped or coarsely minced pork, to which is added pepper, thyme, sage, nutmeg and cayenne, and some rusk as a binder. The meat content is usually 85‚Äì98%. However, the popularity of the Cumberland sausage has become so widespread in recent years that many large food producers started to mass-produce it and sacrificed its original quality with a meat content as low as 45%, containing emulsified rather than coarse- cut meat and being sold in thin links rather than thick, continuous lengths. Until the 1950s, most local farms and many households kept a pig as part of their regular husbandry and means of self-sufficiency. Over time, a local variety of pig was bred that was suited to the cooler and wetter climate in Cumberland, known as the Cumberland pig. The Cumberland pig was a heavy pig with an upturned snout and ears that flopped forwards. Heavy boned, slow to mature, and extremely hardy, the creature became a symbol of the region, but was allowed to die out in the early 1960s at Bothel. As an alternative, Large Black, Gloucestershire Old Spots, and Welsh breeds can be used. The Cumberland pig breed has now been revived, although not officially recognised by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. Protected Geographical Status A campaign was made by some Cumbrian butchers and meat manufacturers to have Cumberland sausage placed under a Protected Geographical Status classification under European Commission rules. This would provide the same protection as is afforded to Parma ham and Feta cheese. The association suggested that the criteria for the sausages should include a high meat content of more than 80%; the sausage to be coiled, not linked; a wider diameter than conventional sausages; and a rough-cut texture. The association asserts the sausage should be prepared in Cumbria. While individual butchers have their own recipes, they are generally more highly seasoned than traditional sausages, possibly due to the historical import of spices at Whitehaven. However, opposition arose to the campaign in its present form, which essentially calls for the modification of the proposition to reduce the region of the proposed protection from the post-1974 'administrative' County of Cumbria ‚Äì which incorporates Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire 'north of the Sands' but without abolishing the original counties ‚Äì to the Traditional County of Cumberland, on native grounds, with provisions including the native right for natives to continue to manufacture the sausage elsewhere. In March 2011, PGI status was granted to the name \\"Traditional Cumberland sausage\\". To display the PGI mark, the sausage must be produced, processed, and prepared in Cumbria and have a meat content of at least 80%. It must include seasoning and be sold in a long coil. However, sausages not meeting these criteria are sold as Cumberland sausages (without claiming PGI). Waitrose supermarket product description: \\"Cumberland sausages\\" made from Hampshire breed pork from Norfolk, Suffolk, and Wiltshire, and made into sausage links, not a coil. A thin \\"chipolata\\" version is also produced.

Taxonomy  The description of the population was revised in 2019, separating a central western population as Chaeropus yirratji and recognised two earlier descriptions as subspecies Chaeropus ecaudatus ecaudatus (found in southeastern Australia) and Chaeropus ecaudatus occidentalis (found in western and southwestern Australia).  Description  It has been believed to be extinct since the mid-20th century, having reportedly vanished from its final refuge in southern Australia by 1945. It was presumably the first of the two species of Chaeropus to go extinct. Eventhough, the pig footed-bandicoot went extinct they were the only marsipulas to walk on reduced digits both on the fore and hind feet.In addition the pig footed- bandicoot diverges from two different species. According to molecular phylogenetic analyses they diverged from other bandicoots like the Peramelidae, and also from the bilbies like Thylacomyidae int he mid-Late Oligocen (Travouillion, Kenny pg5). It is thought to have been distributed in shrubland habitats in the southern regions of Australia's deserts, and its range likely extended to Western Australia. It physically closely resembled the northern pig-footed bandicoot (C. yirratji), but it had fewer holes on its palate and shorter feet. It also had a different dentition than C. yirratji, indicating that it may have had a different diet. The two species were formerly considered conspecific until a study released in 2019 found them to be separate species.

It is located about southeast of Tahiti. Administratively Moruroa Atoll is part of the commune of Tureia, which includes the atolls of Tureia, Fangataufa, Tematangi and Vanavana. France undertook nuclear weapon tests between 1966 and 1996 at Moruroa and Fangataufa, causing international protests, notably in 1974 and 1995. The number of tests performed has been variously reported as 175 and 181. History Moruroa Even though ancient Polynesians knew Mururoa Atoll by the ancestral name of Hiti-Tautau-Mai, there is no firm historical evidence that it has been permanently inhabited. The first recorded European to visit this atoll was Commander Philip Carteret on HMS Swallow in 1767, just a few days after he had discovered Pitcairn Island. Carteret named Mururoa \\"Bishop of Osnaburgh Island\\". In 1792, the British whaler was wrecked here, and it became known as Matilda's Rocks. Frederick William Beechey visited it in 1826. =French nuclear weapons testing= KH-7 satellite reconnaissance image of the Mururoa Atomic Test Site in French Polynesia, May 26, 1967 Mururoa, and its sister atoll Fangataufa, were the site of extensive nuclear testing by France between 1966 and 1996, as well as the site of numerous protests by various vessels, including the Rainbow Warrior. The atoll was officially established as a nuclear test site by France on September 21, 1962, when the Direction des Centres d'Exp√©rimentations Nucl√©aires (DIRCEN) was established to administer the nuclear testing. This followed with the construction of various infrastructures on the atoll commencing in May 1963. The atoll of Hao, to the north-west of Mururoa, was chosen as a support base for the nuclear tests and other operations. Despite objections from some 30 members of the Polynesian Territorial Assembly, the first nuclear test was conducted on July 2, 1966, code named Aldebaran, when a plutonium fission bomb was exploded in the lagoon. Greenpeace states in a 21st-century study that the explosion sucked all the water from the lagoon, \\"raining dead fish and mollusks down on the atoll\\", and that it spread contamination across the Pacific as far as Peru and New Zealand. President Charles de Gaulle himself was present at Moruroa on 10 September 1966 when a test was conducted, using a device suspended from a balloon. Most of these tests were conducted on the western end of the atoll, designated as Dindon. Smaller blasts were detonated on the northern end of the atoll, designated as Denise. Three nuclear devices were detonated on barges, three were air dropped from bombers, and the rest were suspended from helium filled balloons. A total of 41 atmospheric nuclear tests were conducted at Mururoa between 1966 and 1974. The lagoon of Mururoa, 1972 View on Mururoa, 2005 France abandoned atmospheric nuclear testing in 1974 and moved to underground testing in the midst of intense world pressure which was sparked by the New Zealand Government of the time, which sent two frigates in July 1973, HMNZS Canterbury and Otago, to the atoll in protest for a nuclear free Pacific. Shafts were drilled deep into the volcanic rocks underlying the atolls where nuclear devices were detonated. This practice created much controversy as cracking of the atolls was discovered, resulting in fears that the radioactive material trapped under the atolls would eventually escape and contaminate the surrounding ocean and neighbouring atolls, a case of so-called tired mountain syndrome. A major accident occurred on 25 July 1979 when a test was conducted at half the usual depth because the nuclear device got stuck halfway down the 800 metre shaft. It was detonated and caused a large submarine landslide on the southwest rim of the atoll, causing a significant chunk of the outer slope of the atoll to break loose and causing a tsunami affecting Mururoa and injuring workers. The blast caused a 2 kilometre long and 40 cm wide crack to appear on the atoll. French president Jacques Chirac's decision to run a nuclear test series at Mururoa on 5 September and 2 October 1995, just one year before the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty was to be signed, caused worldwide protest, including an embargo of French wine. Riots took place across Polynesia, and the South Pacific Forum threatened to suspend France. These tests were meant to provide the nation with enough data to improve further nuclear technology without needing additional series of tests. The test site at Mururoa was dismantled following France‚Äôs last nuclear test to date, detonated on 27 January 1996, but the atoll is still guarded by the French Forces. In total, 181 explosions took place at Moruroa and Fangataufa, 41 of which were atmospheric. However, the total number has been variously reported: nuclear scientists working at the site claim 175 explosions in total took place in the Pacific.  Monitoring  A report from 2012 suggested that only 11 of the 20 monitoring system sensors are actually functional, which could mean the atoll could potentially collapse without forewarning of the monitoring system.

Alongside Pat Mills, he helped revitalise British comics in the 1970s, and continues to be active in the British comics industry, occasionally also working in American comics. He is best known as the co-creator, with artist Carlos Ezquerra, of the character Judge Dredd. Wagner started his career in editorial with D. C. Thomson & Co. in the late 1960s before becoming a freelance writer and a staff editor at IPC in the 1970s. He has worked in children's humour and girls' adventure comics, but is most notable for his boys' adventure comics; he helped launch Battle Picture Weekly (1975), for which he wrote \\"Darkie's Mob\\", and 2000 AD (1977), for which he created numerous characters, including Judge Dredd, Strontium Dog, Robo-Hunter and Button Man. In the 1980s, he and co-writer Alan Grant wrote prolifically for IPC's 2000 AD, Battle, Eagle, Scream! and Roy of the Rovers. They also wrote for DC Comics' Batman in the U.S., created a series of Batman and Judge Dredd team-up comics, and started the British independent comic The Bogie Man. Judge Dredd has twice been adapted for film, and David Cronenberg adapted Wagner's graphic novel A History of Violence into the 2005 film of the same name. Wagner continues to write for 2000 AD and Judge Dredd Megazine. Biography =Early life and career= \\"Patridge's Patch\\", from Jet, co-written with Pat Mills, illustrated by Mike Western, 1971. Wagner was born in Pennsylvania, U.S., in 1949,Colin M. Jarman and Peter Acton, Judge Dredd: The Mega History, Lennard Publishing, 1995 the product of a war marriage. When Wagner was twelve his parents separated and his mother returned to Greenock in Scotland with the children.Jack McKeown, \\"Dredd 3D fans owe a debt to the Wormit Thrill Shed , The Courier, 4 September 2012Steven McKenzie, Scotland's influence on 2000AD's Judge Dredd, BBC Scotland, 14 August 2012 Wagner describes himself as \\"a pretty badly adjusted youth\\" in America, fighting and getting into trouble, and says he \\"benefited a lot from the added discipline of life in Scotland.\\" When he left school he joined a printing company, going to college on day release, until his aunt showed him an advert for editorial assistants at D.

IPC managers John Purdie and John Sanders began to take notice. After nine months their writing partnership broke up, and Wagner moved to London to join IPC's staff, editing girls' titles Sandie and Princess Tina until 1973, when both were merged into other titles. After that he quit comics for a time, taking a variety of jobs, including as caretaker of an estate in the Scottish Highlands and dredging on a barge.David Bishop, John Wagner talks about Battle Picture Weekly, Vicious Imagery, 30 January 2007 =Battle, Valiant and Action= \\"Darkie's Mob\\", illustrated by Mike Western, from Battle Picture Weekly In the autumn of 1974 Pat Mills had been tasked with developing Battle Picture Weekly, a new war- themed title for IPC to compete with D. C. Thomson's Warlord. He asked Wagner to join him and help develop characters. Mills and Wagner were dissatisfied with the sanitised nature of boys' comics and wanted to make them harder- hitting, with more working-class heroes. They devised the opening line-up themselves, with the assistance of Gerry Finley-Day, before farming the stories out to other writers. The title was launched with a cover date of 8 March 1975, and was a hit. Wagner continued to write for girls' comics, including scripting gymnastics strip \\"Bella at the Bar\\" for Tammy,Brave Bella Barlow, Tammy's Most Popular Heroine , Books Monthly (undated) and was appointed editor of the ailing boys' weekly Valiant. Characters he created for this title included the tough New York City cop \\"One-Eyed Jack\\", drawn by John Cooper, which was inspired by the film Dirty Harry and became the comic's most popular character,\\"I invented Judge Dredd\\", BBC, 28 February 2002 and \\"Soldier Sharp\\", drawn by Joe Colquhoun, about a cunning coward in World War II. Both strips transferred to Battle when Valiant was merged into it in 1976, with One-Eyed Jack leaving the police and becoming a spy.David Bishop, \\"Blazing Battle Action\\" part 2, Judge Dredd Megazine No. 210, 23 September 2003, pp. 72‚Äì79 Wagner then quit editorial and returned to freelance writing. In 1976‚Äì77 he wrote \\"Darkie's Mob\\" for Battle, a violent series about a renegade British captain leading a group of lost soldiers in a personal war against the Japanese in Burma during World War II, drawn by Mike Western, which became one of the comic's most popular strips, although Wagner has since said he regrets \\"some of the jingoistic, racist language\\" used.Ian Wheeler, \\"John Wagner: The Story Man\\", Eagle Flies Again issue 11, Winter 2004, pp. 5‚Äì6 A collected edition was published by Titan Books in 2011.Darkie's Mob ‚Äì The Secret War of Joe Darkie at Titan Books Other strips he wrote for Battle included \\"Joe Two Beans\\" (1977), about a mute Native American soldier in the Pacific Campaign, drawn by Eric Bradbury, and the naval series \\"HMS Nightshade\\" (1978‚Äì79), drawn by Western. For Mills' short-lived, controversial title Action he scripted the boxing strip \\"Blackjack\\".\\"Blackjack\\" at The Sevenpenny Nightmare During this time he shared a flat on Camberwell New Road in London with future 2000 AD editor Steve MacManus. =2000 AD= In 1976 Mills brought Wagner in as script adviser for the new science fiction comic he was developing, 2000 AD. Wagner suggested the new title needed a cop story, and his proposal, \\"Judge Dredd\\", took the Dirty Harry archetype further, imagining a violent lawman, empowered to dispense justice on the spot in a future New York. Artist Carlos Ezquerra was asked to visualise the character, but Wagner initially hated the elaborate look Ezquerra came up with, thinking it \\"way over the top\\". When a proposed buy-out of 2000 AD that would have improved creators' terms and conditions fell through, Wagner walked away from the comic,David Bishop, Thrill Power Overload, Rebellion, 2002‚Äì2009 leaving Mills to develop the character by commissioning stories from freelancers. The first published episode appeared in issue 2, based on a script by Peter Harris, rewritten by Mills and drawn by Mike McMahon, which alienated Ezquerra. Wagner returned to write the character from issue 9, and has written the majority of Judge Dredd stories since. Ezquerra returned in 1982 to draw the \\"Apocalypse War\\" storyline, and continued to draw the character semi-regularly until his death in 2018. Wagner created two long-running series in 1978. One, \\"Robo-Hunter\\", a private detective-style character who specialised in robot-related cases, was initially drawn by Jos√© Ferrer, but his pages were partly redrawn by Ian Gibson, who became the strip's regular artist. The other, \\"Strontium Dog\\", a sci-fi western about a bounty hunter in a future where mutants are an oppressed minority forced into doing such dirty work, was created by Wagner and Ezquerra for Starlord, a short-lived sister title to 2000 AD with higher production values. Starlord was later merged into 2000 AD, bringing \\"Strontium Dog\\" with it. =Doctor Who= During their writing partnership, Wagner and Mills had submitted story ideas to the BBC for the TV series Doctor Who in the 1970s,Dave Gibbons, Pat Mills, John Wagner and Steve Moore, Doctor Who: The Iron Legion, Panini Books but Wagner eventually dropped out, tired of the endless rewrites requested, an experience which turned him off TV writing. Mills' involvement came to an end when the show's script editor changed. Artist Dave Gibbons was aware of this, and when he was offered the chance to draw the lead strip in Doctor Who Weekly in 1979, he suggested them as writers. The pair wrote four eight-part serials, based on their unmade TV scripts. They adapted them separately, Wagner scripting \\"City of the Damned\\" and \\"Dogs of Doom\\", and Mills scripting \\"The Iron Legion\\" and \\"The Star Beast\\", although all were credited to \\"Mills & Wagner\\". =Partnership with Alan Grant= John Wagner at a comic convention in New York City in 1992. From 1980 to 1988 he wrote in partnership with Alan Grant, an old friend and former D. C. Thomson and 2000 AD sub-editor with whom he was sharing an old farmhouse in Essex, although most stories were credited to Wagner alone (under one of his pseudonyms) or Grant alone ‚Äì whichever of them typed the script up got the cheque.David Bishop, \\"Interrogation: Alan Grant\\" part 2, Judge Dredd Megazine #267, 5 February 2008, pp. 16‚Äì22 Wagner (as John Howard or T. B. Grover) was credited with \\"Judge Dredd\\", and Grant with the less frequent \\"Robo-Hunter\\", \\"Strontium Dog\\", and the Judge Dredd spin-off \\"Anderson, Psi Division\\", while some strips, like the CB-inspired space haulage comedy \\"Ace Trucking Co.\\", were credited to \\"Grant/Grover\\". \\"Judge Dredd\\" was credited to \\"Wagner/Grant\\" starting in 1986.2000 AD prog 493, IPC Magazines Ltd, cover date 25 October 1986 Other pseudonyms were created, at the insistence of publisher John Sanders, to disguise how prolific the two writers were. For the revived Eagle they wrote \\"Doomlord\\", \\"Joe Soap\\", \\"Rebel the Police Dog\\", \\"Computer Warrior\\", \\"The Fists of Danny Pyke\\", \\"Manix\\" and \\"The House of Daemon\\"; for Scream! they wrote \\"The Thirteenth Floor\\",Alex Frith, , 2000 AD Review (undated, via Internet Archive) for Roy of the Rovers they wrote \\"Dan Harker's War\\", and for Battle they wrote \\"Invasion 1984\\".David Bishop, \\"Blazing Battle Action\\" part 4, Judge Dredd Megazine No. 212, 18 November 2003, pp. 72‚Äì79 During this time Wagner wrote the documentary strip \\"Fight for the Falklands\\" for Battle, without Grant who had no interest in war stories, and \\"Dan Dare\\" with Pat Mills for Eagle.Dan Dare at Barney's 2000 AD Database Wagner and Grant became part of the so-called \\"British Invasion\\" of American comics during the 1980s. In 1987 their first title, a mini-series called Outcasts, was published by DC Comics with Cam Kennedy as artist. Outcasts was well received, though it never sold in great quantities, and this success led to the pair writing Batman in the pages of Detective Comics from issue 583, largely with Norm Breyfogle on art duties. Grant and Wagner introduced the Ventriloquist in their first Batman story and the Ratcatcher in their third. The pair also created the bleak nuclear dystopia The Last American for Epic Comics with longtime Dredd artist Mike McMahon. Arguments over the direction of that title and the ending of the Judge Dredd story \\"Oz\\" led to the end of their writing partnership and they split their work between them: Wagner kept \\"Judge Dredd\\", while Grant continued \\"Strontium Dog\\" and \\"Anderson, Psi Division\\" and became the sole writer of Detective Comics. Although the two continue to collaborate from time to time, they have never resumed a full-time partnership. =Creators' rights= In 1987, IPC's comics division was sold to Robert Maxwell as Fleetway Publications. John Davidge was appointed as publishing director in 1989, and within a matter of weeks was confronted by Wagner, who emptied a large bag of Judge Dredd merchandise onto his desk, pointed out he had received no royalties for any of it, and threatened a creator walk-out over the issue. Davidge, whose background was in magazine and book publishing, was shocked, and introduced written contracts and royalty payments for comic creators. =The Bogie Man and the 1990s= One series Wagner and Grant did continue writing together was The Bogie Man, about an escaped mental patient who thinks he's Humphrey Bogart, or rather a composite of the characters he played, and constructs imaginary cases by associating random events with events in Bogart films. They had previously pitched the series, unsuccessfully, to DC before writing Outcasts. It was first published as a four-part miniseries by the Scottish independent Fat Man Press in 1989, intending to tie in with Glasgow's position as European City of Culture in 1990, and further stories followed from other publishers. Wagner and Grant were named as consulting editors on a new title, the Judge Dredd Megazine, in 1990. Wagner did most of the development work, and wrote three of the five strips in the opening line-up, including \\"America\\", illustrated by Colin MacNeil, which examined the totalitarian nature of the Judge system through the story of a young woman who becomes a pro-democracy terrorist, and \\"Young Death: Boyhood of a Superfiend\\", with art by Peter Doherty, which told the origin of Dredd's arch-enemy Judge Death in humorous style. While his efforts were concentrated on Dredd in the Megazine, Wagner took a break from writing the character in 2000 AD, replaced by Garth Ennis, Grant Morrison, Mark Millar and others. He did not resume writing for 2000 AD for more than three years. Wagner was initially involved in Toxic!, an independent weekly anthology launched in 1991, but, aside from two Bogie Man serials co-written with Grant, most of his proposed stories were rejected and he withdrew from the project. One such proposal, \\"Al's Baby\\", a comedy about a male mob hitman who becomes pregnant, drawn by Carlos Ezquerra, ran in the Judge Dredd Megazine in 1991. Another, \\"Button Man\\", a contemporary urban gladiator thriller drawn by Arthur Ranson, was published in 2000 AD in 1992. Both spawned sequels. Wagner and Grant reunited in 1992 for Judgement on Gotham, a hit graphic novel teaming up Judge Dredd and Batman, co-published by Fleetway and DC and featuring painted art by Simon Bisley. Further team-ups between Dredd and Batman followed, but were beset by production delays.David Bishop, \\"Interrogation: Alan Grant\\" part 3, Judge Dredd Megazine #268, pp. 16‚Äì22 In the mid-1990s Wagner worked on a number of licensed properties for Dark Horse Comics in the US, including Aliens, Star Wars - notably solo stories starring Boba Fett, Dark Horse Comics, 1997 (via Internet Archive) and the comics strand of the multimedia project Shadows of the Empire - and Xena: Warrior Princess.John Wagner interview, Westfield Comics, July 1999 In 1997 he wrote his first original graphic novel, A History of Violence, a contemporary thriller about an unassuming small-town man whose background in gang crime comes back to haunt him, drawn by Vince Locke for the Paradox Press imprint of DC Comics. It was nominated for the Angoul√™me International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario in 2006. =21st century= In 2000 Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra revived \\"Strontium Dog\\" (main character Johnny Alpha had been killed off in 1990 in a story written by Alan Grant), based on a treatment Wagner had written for an abortive TV pilot. Initially, stories were set before the character's death in a revised continuity, but 2010's \\"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\\" brought Johnny back from the dead.Tony Ingram, Mutant Mayhem in Milton Keynes: The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha, Strontium Dog , Broken Frontier, 19 August 2011 Wagner has continued to be the main writer of \\"Judge Dredd\\" in 2000 AD and the Judge Dredd Megazine. In 2003 he co-wrote the Judge Dredd/Aliens crossover, \\"Incubus\\", with Andy Diggle, which was co-published by Dark Horse Comics and 2000 AD. Since 2005 he has shared the character with other writers, including Gordon Rennie, Robbie Morrison, Si Spurrier, Al Ewing and Michael Carroll. Major storylines he has contributed include \\"Origins\\" (2006‚Äì2007), exploring how the Judge system was established, and \\"Day of Chaos\\" (2011‚Äì2012), in which many of the institutions of Dredd's world are destroyed, leaving a more dangerous city. In 2016 Wagnor teamed up with Grant to create a new comic for BHP Comics. Drawn by Dan Cornwell \\"Rok of the Reds\\" tells the story of a dangerous intergalactic outlaw, Rok of Arkadi, who, while on the run, hides on the planet earth by taking over the body and life of troubled football star Kyle Dixon. A father of two, Wagner lives with his wife near Shrewsbury, Shropshire.Shropshire restaurant name immortalised in Dredd 3D, Shropshire Star, 9 August 2012Rick Fulton, \\"Scots comic legend on the end of an era.. and dawn of a new Dredd\\", Daily Record and Sunday Mail, 7 September 2012 Style and influence Pat Mills describes Wagner's writing as \\"romantic but not emotional\\". His depictions of violent action, from \\"Darkie's Mob\\" to \\"Judge Dredd\\" to A History of Violence, are unsentimental and laced with mordant humour. Other strips, like \\"Robo-Hunter\\", \\"Ace Trucking Co.\\" and \\"The Balls Brothers\\", reveal a more overt comedy side to his writing. He is well known for writing terse scripts, described by artist Dave Gibbons as being like \\"exciting telegrams\\".Thom Young, Watching the Watchmen with Dave Gibbons: An Interview, Comics Bulletin (undated) He says he does not think visually, but rather \\"in terms of plot developments [and] dialogue\\", preferring to leave the visual decisions to the artist.Laura Sneddon, Comic Studies: Dundee Comics Day, Comic Book Resources, 2 November 2011 Described by Warren Ellis as \\"probably the single most influential writer in British comics\\",Warren Ellis, Come In Alone issue #14, Comic Book Resources, 3 March 2000 Wagner is named as an influence by writers such as Alan Grant, who says he \\"taught me almost all I know about comic writing\\",Oor Authors, ItchyCoo Garth Ennis,Comic Book Day: Getting Closure with Garth Ennis , Nerdist News, 29 February 2012 Andy DiggleCut to: Andy Diggle (Comic Book Writer) , My PDF Scripts, 2012 and Rob Williams.Multiversity Comics Presents: Rob Williams , 19 September 2011 Alan Moore was inspired by the work of Wagner and Pat Mills in 2000 AD to try and express his ideas in mainstream comics.Gary Spencer Millidge, Alan Moore: Storyteller, Ilex, 2011, p. 58 Wagner's own influences include the comics of D.

Wagner and Grant made very little money out of it. Wagner felt that the screenwriter did a poor job adapting it, and Coltrane did not understand the character. 1995 saw the release of Judge Dredd, a big budget version of the comic directed by Danny Cannon and starring Sylvester Stallone. Wagner was unhappy with the result, feeling they had filmed \\"the wrong script\\" and that \\"Stallone was badly advised\\".

An adaptation of the 1944 novel of the same name by Margaret Landon, it was based on the fictionalized diaries of Anna Leonowens, an Anglo-Indian woman who claimed to be British and became governess in the Royal Court of Siam (now modern Thailand) during the 1860s. Darryl F. Zanuck read Landon's book in galleys and immediately bought the film rights. The story mainly concerns the culture clash of the Imperialist Victorian values of the British Empire with the autocratic rule of Siam's King Mongkut. The successful film starred Rex Harrison as the king and Irene Dunne as Anna. At the 19th Academy Awards ceremony, the film received two Oscars; for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction (Lyle R. Wheeler, William S. Darling, Thomas Little, Frank E. Hughes). Also nominated were Bernard Herrmann for the score, the screenwriters and supporting actress Gale Sondergaard. Landon's novel was later adapted by Rodgers and Hammerstein for their 1951 stage musical The King and I and subsequent 1956 film of the same name. American film director Andy Tennant remade the film in 1999 as Anna and the King with Jodie Foster and Chow Yun- fat. The portrayal of Tuptim in Anna and the King of Siam is considerably less sympathetic than in the musical version The King and I, as the 1946 film shows animosity between Tuptim and Anna, while the musical makes her into a romantic character. Also, Tuptim is ultimately executed cruelly by the king, following an episode in Leonowens's book, while in the musical her fate is made ambiguous.Ma, Sheng-mei. \\"Rodgers and Hammerstein's 'Chopsticks' musicals\\". Literature/Film Quarterly, Vol. 31, Number 1 (2003), pp. 17‚Äì26. Plot In 1862, Anna OwensThis shortened form of \\"Leonowens\\" is used in the film. arrives in Bangkok, with her son Louis, to tutor the children of the King. She believes she is sufficiently acquainted with Asian customs to know what is proper in Siam, having read a book summarizing the same. However, when the Kralahome or Prime Minister comes out to welcome her, he asks her a number of personal questions, and she does not know that this is common courtesy in Siam. Her letter from the King asking her to come to Siam includes a promise that she will have a house of her own away from the Palace, but the Kralahome says she will have to stay in the harem for now (although she'll have a private room there). Anna goes to the Kralahome's office the next day and apologizes for her misunderstanding, asking him to introduce her to the King so she can get the house business straightened out and start her school. He says it is New Year in Siam and the King is busy with many festivities and ceremonies, but he will work her into the schedule. When he does so, he tells her that it is polite to prostrate oneself before the King; Anna refuses, and says she will bow as she would to her own Queen. Mongkut challenges her with personal questions; she responds with nonsensical answers. Liking her spirit, he introduces her to his many wives and his 67 children, asking that she instruct the wives in English as well as the children. She is enchanted, but reminds him that he promised her a house. He refuses to remember that he promised such a thing and insists she live in the palace, where she will be more accessible in case students (or the King himself) have questions. When she insists, she is shown a sleazy house in the fishmarket, but rejects it and stays in the palace, starting her school there. Lady Thiang, the head wife knows English and translates. Among other things, Anna teaches proverbs and songs about promises and home or houses. Soon even the royal secretary is singing \\"Home! Sweet Home!\\" under his breath as he works. Meanwhile, the Kralahome comes in and tells Mongkut that Cambodia, once a part of Siam, has sold out to the French, who have established a protectorate. The King says his plan is to hold onto Siam, to save what he can. He finally cedes to Anna on the matter of the house; she likes it, but plans to leave. However, the Kralahome tells her to stay, because Mongkut is a complex man who needs her influence. Mongkut begins summoning Anna in the middle of the night to discuss how the Bible should be interpreted, and other scholarly matters. On the way back from one of these sessions, she discovers a chained slave with a baby. This is L'Ore, who belongs to Lady Tuptim, the new favorite. Tuptim is very young and very bitter about being brought to the Palace and shut up behind the walls, even though the King likes her. She refuses to let L'Ore go, even though L'Ore's husband has offered to pay for her. As he has done several times in the past, Crown Prince Chulalongkorn questions her about these matters, but she puts him off. Lady Thiang, the crown prince's mother, is concerned, but Anna gives her the brush-off too, saying they will talk \\"later, when she has time\\". Anna tells the King about L'Ore, reminding him that it's his own law that slaves must be freed if the money is offered. This law protects all. The King asks if Queen Victoria is above the law. Anna explains that she is not and neither is President Lincoln. She tells about the fight against slavery in America, and about the Civil War. He writes to Lincoln offering to send pairs of elephants that can be used as army transport (an actual incident); Lincoln writes back, thanking him for the offer but explaining that elephants would not do well in American climates. Tuptim shows Anna a jeweled glass pomegranate the King gave her for freeing her slave, but then believes that the King listened to Anna about this, not to her. \\"If I am not first here, what is left for me?\\" Mongkut expects English visitors and asks Anna to dress some of his prettiest wives in European style and to provide English-style decor and utensils to show that he is not a barbarian. Much is at stakeforeign papers have written very biased things about Siam, and Britain is thinking about establishing a protectorate. Anna suggests that the King invite consuls to come from other countries at the same time. The party is a great success, combining British, European and Siamese traditions and convincing the visitors that Siam is indeed a civilized nation with a very old and very proud history. Lady Tuptim, who's been missing for some time, is found in a Buddhist temple, disguised as a young man. She is put on trial and explains; she couldn't stand being shut up, and so disguised herself and went to the monastery because she had nowhere else to go. She was accepted as a novice and studied with Phra Palat, her former fianc√©, who'd taken holy vows when Tuptim was presented to the king. No one believes that she was simply in disguise and that Phra Palat had no idea who she was. Anna runs to the King and begs his help, but he's very insulted that Anna even knows about what happened‚Äîit's a private matter as well as something that harms his dignity. Anna unwisely loses her temper and tells the king he has no heart and that he's a barbarian. Protesting her innocence and Phra Palat's, Tuptim is burned at the stake and he with her. Anna decides that she has had enough and says goodbye to the children. The royal wives read her a letter pleading with her to stay. Lady Thiang is disappointed with Anna, explains her life story through the illustrations on her wallpaper, and says that the crown prince may not grow up to be a good king if Anna doesn't stay to educate him. At the same time, Louis dies in a riding accident. The Kralahome comes to her and reads a proclamation from the King granting Louis royal funeral honours. He explains that the King does this by way of apology for what happened with Tuptim. But when the King asks Anna to continue secretarial duties, she says \\"It's the children I want,\\" and goes on with her school. The British open a consulate in 1865, the French in 1867, and the US in 1870. Many years pass, and the crown prince is now a young man. Anna is summoned to the bedside of the King, who is dying. The King says that Anna spoke the truth to him and was a good influence on the children. He expresses his gratitude and dies. The Kralahome asks Anna to stay and help the prince. When Chulalongkorn is crowned, his first act is to abolish the practice of prostration before the King, so that everyone can respect each other and work together. Cast Historical inconsistencies There are a number of differences between the plot of this film and historical fact, including: * Anna was Anglo-Indian, raised in India, and not Welsh, as she claimed; she had never even visited Britain before becoming a governess in the court of Siam. Also, she was the widow of a civilian clerk and hotel- keeper, not a British army officer. * King Mongkut had been a Buddhist monk for 27 years before succeeding his brother as king. This is actually brought out quite prominently in one scene. His portrayal as an arrogant tyrant is debated. The film and musical production were based on Margaret Landon's 1944 novel, Anna and the King of Siam, which was in turn based on Leonowens' accounts of her experiences. To set the record straight, Thai intellectuals Seni Pramoj and Kukrit Pramoj (brothers) wrote The King of Siam Speaks in 1948. () * Tuptim's torture and execution by burning at the stake is disputed by a great-granddaughter of the King who claimed also to be Tuptim's granddaughter.Princess Vudhichalerm Vudhijaya (b. 21 May 1934), stated in a 2001 interview, \\"King Mongkut was in the monk's hood for 27 years before he was king. He would never have ordered an execution. It is not the Buddhist way.\\" She added that the same Tuptim was her grandmother and had married Chulalongkorn. Nancy Dunne, \\"'Life as a royal is not for me': A Thai princess tells Nancy Dunne the truth about The King and I and how she prefers a simple life in the U.S.\\", Financial Times (25 August 2001), p. 7. This type of execution was never done in Siam according to former Prime Minister Anan Panyarachun.Panyarachun is quoted in a 1998 article in the Thai newspaper The Nation, reprinted article at Anna and the King Articles. * Mongkut really did write a letter to Washington offering elephants to be used as stock for breeding American elephants, but the offer was unrelated to the Civil War. His letter, accompanied by some gifts, was addressed to President James Buchanan during the last month of his term, \\"or to whomsoever the people have elected anew as Chief ruler in place of President Buchanan\\". The response, dated almost a year later, came from President Abraham Lincoln, thanking the king for the gifts and good wishes, but declining the elephants on the grounds that the latitude of the U.S. made raising elephants impractical. * The Siamese theatricals presented at the dinner party in the film are accompanied by music that seems to be sourced from the Folkways album Music of the Orient (1979 remastered edition available). The soundtrack cuts back and forth between a piece labeled Gamelan Gong: Lagu kebiar which is not Siamese but Balinese, and what appears to be a Thai piece used to accompany dramatic performances. The recording labels it as \\"Musical Drama: Scene from the Rama Legend\\". The Balinese music is in a style known as gong kebyar, which didn't exist in the 1860s. However, the background music by Bernard Herrmann is clearly based on Thai traditional court music in the mahori style, particularly the use of the ranat xylophone. * Anna's son Louis dies as a child in a riding accident in the film, and Anna's decision to remain in Siam is prompted both by the King's sincere regret for her loss and her own maternal instincts: Prince Chulalongkorn becomes a sort of foster son for Anna. The historical Louis Leonowens did not die as a child, and in fact outlived his mother. * In the film, Anna is present at the death of King Mongkut. The historical Anna had been granted a leave of absence for health reasons in 1867 and was in England at the time of the King's death in 1868; she was not invited to resume her post by the new king.

Biography Title page from Nachman Krochmal's Guide for the Perplexed of Our Time.He began the study of the Talmud at an early age. At age fourteen he was married, according to the custom of the time, to the daughter of the wealthy merchant Habermann. He then went to live with his father-in-law at Zhovkva, near Lemberg, where he devoted himself entirely to his studies, beginning with Maimonides' The Guide for the Perplexed, and studying other Hebrew philosophical writings. Krochmal then proceeded to study German and the German philosophers, especially Immanuel Kant, to read Latin and French classics, and Arabic and Syriac books. After suffering a breakdown from overwork in 1808, he went to Lemberg for medical treatment; and the friendship he there formed with S.L. Rapoport, whose teacher he became, was most fruitful for Jewish science. On his return to ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew, after having partially recovered, he again took up philosophy, reading Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling, and subsequently Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, whose system chiefly attracted him and exerted a great influence on his views. Aside from Rapoport, who often visited him in ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew, he gathered around him a group of young students. In 1814, after the death of his wife's parents, he was compelled to earn a livelihood, and he became a merchant. Twelve years later he lost his wife, and his health became very poor. In spite of failure in business, poor circumstances, and loneliness, he refused an invitation to the rabbinate of Berlin, and instead obtained a position as bookkeeper in ≈ª√≥≈Çkiew, which he held from 1836 to 1838. A serious illness then compelled him to retire to his daughter's house in Tarnopol; and here two years later he died. Career Krochmal was a brilliant conversationalist and an exceedingly careful student. For a long time he could not be persuaded to publish any of the results of his studies, in consequence of aspersions cast upon him on account of his friendly correspondence with the hakham of the neighboring Karaite community of Kokusow. Krochmal defended himself in a circular letter against these accusations. He was not a prolific writer. Besides some Hebrew essays in periodicals (Sulamith, 1818; Ha-·∫íefirah, Zolkiev, 1824; and Kerem ·∏§emed, vols. iv., v.), he wrote only one Hebrew book, namely, Moreh Nebuke ha-Zeman (Lemberg, 1851), edited, according to the author's last will, by Leopold Zunz, whom he admired as a great scholar though he never met. Other editions appeared in Lemberg in 1863 and Warsaw in 1898. =Moreh Nebukhe ha-Zeman= Moreh Nebukhe ha-Zeman (Guide for the Perplexed of the Time) is divided into seventeen chapters, of which the first six deal with religion in general. Ch. vii describes Israel's spiritual gift as the desire for and faculty of seeking God. The next three chapters contain a philosophical analysis of Jewish history, which, corresponding to Israel's attachment to the Lord, that is, to its religious development, is divided into three epochs. These epochs terminate respectively: (1) with the death of Gedaliah after the destruction of the Temple; (2) with the death of Bar Kokba (ca. 135); and (3) with the expulsion of the Jews from Spain (1492). The author does not characterize the modern period in which he himself lived. Ch. xi-xv deal with the post-exilic Biblical and the Apocryphal literature and with the various religious movements. The author discusses also the necessity of tradition and gives a critical r√©sum√© of the development of the Halakhah and Aggadah. Ch. xvi gives a brief sketch of the future development of Jewish religious philosophy based on the principles of Hegel. The work finishes with an exposition of Ibn Ezra's philosophy. The historical digressions in the book touch the profoundest problems of Jewish science; and it remains their indisputable merit to have paved the way for critical studies in Jewish history. The work really became, as intended by the author, a \\"guide\\" to students of Jewish science in the nineteenth century.

It was once a common tradition in saloons and taverns in many places in the United States, with the phrase appearing in U.S. literature from about 1870 to the 1920s. These establishments included a \\"free\\" lunch, which varied from rudimentary to quite elaborate, with the purchase of at least one drink. These free lunches were typically worth far more than the price of a single drink. The saloon-keeper relied on the expectation that most customers would buy more than one drink, and that the practice would build patronage for other times of day. The hardships of the Depression marked the curtailing of the widespread practice for reasons of economy, and it never really returned. This was noted in Carroll John Daly‚Äôs 1944 detective story ‚Äú Body, Body, Who‚Äôs Got the Body?‚Äù. The protagonist, hard-boiled investigator Race Williams, meets a woman in New York at a fancy Park Avenue cafe. Grumbling at the high prices and skimpy portions, he says ‚ÄúI...paid the bill for what would have been a free lunch in the good old days‚Äù. Free food or drink is sometimes supplied in contemporary times, often by gambling establishments such as casinos. The saying \\"there ain't no such thing as a free lunch\\" refers to the practice, meaning that you always end up paying in some way for something offered for free. In PEC perspective, this concept is used as the strategy that is used to attract certain audiences to make more profits by broadcasters. They are selling the time, audience's attentions and general consciousness to the capitalists.  History  In 1875, The New York Times wrote of elaborate free lunches as a \\"custom peculiar to the Crescent City\\" (New Orleans), saying, \\"In every one of the drinking saloons which fill the city a meal of some sort is served free every day. The custom appears to have prevailed long before the war .... I am informed that there are thousands of men in this city who live entirely on the meals obtained in this way.\\" As described by this reporter, > A free lunch-counter is a great leveler of classes, and when a man takes up > a position before one of them he must give up all hope of appearing either > dignified or consequential.

An 1872 New York Times story about \\"loafers and free-lunch men\\" who \\"toil not, neither do they spin, yet they 'get along,'\\" visiting saloons, trying to bum drinks from strangers; \\"should this inexplicable lunch-fiend not happen to be called to drink, he devours whatever he can, and, while the bartender is occupied, tries to escape unnoticed.\\"\\"The Loafer and Free-Lunch Men;\\" The New York Times, June 30, 1872, p. 6 In American saloon bars from the late 19th century until Prohibition, bouncers had, in addition to their role of removing drunks who were too intoxicated to keep buying drinks, fighters, and troublemakers, the unusual role of protecting the saloon's free buffet. To attract business, \\"... many saloons lured customers with offers of a \\"free lunch\\"‚Äîusually well salted to inspire drinking, and the saloon \\"bouncer\\" was generally on hand to discourage [those with too] hearty appetites\\".Drinking in America: A History - Search for Consensus: Drinking and the War Against Pluralism, 1860-1920 ‚Äì Lender, Mark Edward & Martin, James Kirby, The Free Press, New York, 1982 The custom was well-developed in San Francisco. An 1886 story on the fading of the days of the 1849 California Gold Rush calls \\"the free lunch fiend the only landmark of the past.\\" It asks \\"How do all these idle people live\\" and asserts, \\"It is the free lunch system that keeps them alive. Take away that peculiarly California institution and they would all starve.\\"\\"Old Things Passing Away,\\" The New York Times, March 5, 1886, p. 2 Rudyard Kipling, writing in 1891, noted how he > came upon a barroom full of bad Salon pictures in which men with hats on the > backs of their heads were wolfing food from a counter.

An 1874 history of the movement writes: > In the cities, there are prominent rooms on fashionable streets that hold > out the sign \\"Free Lunch.\\" Does it mean that some [philanthropist] ... has > gone systematically to work setting out tables ... placing about them a > score of the most beautiful and winning young ladies ... hiring a band of > music?

Thus consummate art plies the work > of death, and virtue, reputation, and every good are sacrificed at these > worse than Moloch shrines., p. 133 A number of writers, however, suggest that the free lunch actually performed a social relief function. Reformer William T.

This article is about the director's cut, lasting 123 minutes, which is the only circulating version of the film. The hastily censored theatrical cut, lasting 118 minutes, has completely lost its viewership since the director's cut became available to the North American public in 2012.  Plot  On 28 April 1876, Leopold, His Grace the 3rd Duke of Albany, is a stifled dreamer. He has created a design for a primitive elevator, and has built a small model of this device. His strict Uncle Millard has no patience for what he sees as Leopold's frivolous interest in the sciences and new inventions, having brought him to New York City in order to marry a wealthy American heiress, as the Mountbatten family is heavily indebted. While sketching the Brooklyn Bridge during a public meeting dedicated to the completion of its Manhattan tower, Leopold notices Stuart Besser taking photographs with an anachronistically small camera. Stuart is an amateur physicist (and great‚Äëgreat‚Äëgrandson of Leopold) from 21st‚Äëcentury New York who has discovered the existence of gravitational time portals. Later, Leopold catches Stuart in the Duke's study, photographing his schematic diagrams. When Stuart attempts to flee, Leopold follows and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into the time portal. Leopold awakens on a Wednesday morning in the year 2001 in Stuart's apartment at 88 White Street, Manhattan. Stuart explains that the portal they have travelled through has closed, but will reopen on the next Monday, until which time Leopold should stay in Stuart's apartment. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the empty elevator shaft, and, after ranting about his scientific discovery in the hospital, is involuntarily committed to a mental institution. According to Stuart's concept, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a widespread \\"occlusion\\" of elevators, and may cause the disappearance of Stuart himself if Leopold doesn't go back on Monday. Leopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay, Stuart's ex-girlfriend who lives downstairs. He observes that she is a \\"career woman\\" and that her field, market research, is a fine avocation for a woman. Kate dismisses him and demands that he take Stuart's dog for a walk. Back at the apartment, he befriends Charlie, Kate's brother and an aspiring actor, who believes him to be an actor as well, steadfast to his character. On Thursday morning, Kate becomes impressed by Leopold's eloquent exposition of how important the tastiness of food is to the quality of human life. She takes him to an audition for a TV commercial pitching a fat-free butter, Farmer's Bounty, produced by the British company Jansen Foods, which is being taken over by Kate's company, Camden Research Group (CRG). On Friday, Leopold hires a violinist and invites Kate to a rooftop dinner, which ends with a waltz and the first kiss. They become romantically entangled and spend Saturday touring New York. In the evening, he tries to propose to her, but she falls asleep on his lap. On Monday, Leopold acts in a Farmer's Bounty commercial, but walks off the set upon finding the diet margarine disgusting. Leopold chastises Kate about integrity, to which she counters that he lacks connection with reality. Realizing that their time together is nearly over, both spend the evening in subdued contemplation. On Tuesday morning, Stuart escapes from the asylum and sends Leopold to his own time, which makes the elevators work again. Charlie notices Kate in a photo taken at Leopold's ball on 28 April 1876, and shows the photo to Stuart, who realizes that Kate's future is in the past. That night, when Kate is about to accept her promotion at the merger banquet, Stuart and Charlie tell her that she has to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge within the next 23 minutes. Kate rejects their suggestion as absurd and goes to give her acceptance speech, during which she sees herself, wearing the same evening dress, in one of Stuart's pictures. She abruptly ends the speech, and the three of them rush to the bridge. Having made it through the portal, Kate appears in 1876. Just when Leopold is about to announce his bride of convenience, Kate storms into the ballroom, and he instead announces her name, styled as \\"Kate McKay, of the McKays of Massapequa\\". Among the shocked guests, Kate and Leopold reunite with a kiss and dance a bridal waltz. Thus Kate turns out to be Stuart's great‚Äëgreat‚Äëgrandmother.  Cast   Alternative versions  References suggesting that Kate is Stuart's great-great-grandmother were censored from the film just a few days before the theatrical release.

The Paykan ( meaning Arrow) is the first Iranian made car produced by Iran Khodro (formerly called \\"Iran National\\") between 1967 and 2005. The car was very popular in Iran from its introduction until its discontinuation. It is often colloquially referred as the Iranian chariot. The Paykan was a Hillman Hunter built under licence, but had some unique body work and locally-developed variants (most notably, the pickup, which used a different body shell from the one sold elsewhere). History The design was introduced to Iran by Mahmoud Khayami, co-founder and, by then, owner of the Iran Khodro (formerly called \\"Iran National\\") company and factory, who accurately predicted that Iran was in need of a simple \\"no-frills\\" motorcar within the price range of ordinary people. In 1967, Rootes began exporting Hillman Hunters to Iran Khodro in \\"complete knock down\\" (CKD) kit form, for assembly in Iran. By the mid-1970s, full-scale manufacturing of the car (minus the engine) had started in Iran. In 1977, Roy Axe designed a new Paykan facelift model using many interior and exterior parts from the Chrysler Alpine. In 1978, Peugeot took over the Rootes company after it collapsed under the ownership of Chrysler Europe; a year later, Peugeot ended Hillman Hunter production in Ireland. Following this, the Paykan's engine production tooling was moved to Iran and was in full-scale manufacturing under Peugeot licence. This ended in 2005 with the final Paykan leaving the assembly line. Irankhodro tried to replace Paykan with a so called \\"New Paykan\\" but Peugeot did not agree with the naming. This revealed the fact that the intellectual ownership of the Paykan brand and logo still belongs to the PSA (Peugeot Soci√©t√© Anonyme) as a legacy of the demise of Rootes group. Design Although the Paykan was based on a 1966 Hillman Hunter, there were many changes and modifications made to it over the years ‚Äì notably the substitution of the original 1725cc Rootes engine with a Peugeot 504-derived unit. The modifications to the exterior included revised headlights and taillights. A Paykan Pickup was also offered.Iran Khodro Paykan Pick up, tocmp.org Retrieved 15 February 2016 There was another pickup truck based on the Hillman Hunter sold in South Africa ‚Äì the Dodge Husky ‚Äì but the two models used different bodies. The South African version has a thicker B-pillar and retains the saloon's lines along the side panels. The tailgate and rear window are also subtly different. The Iranian government reportedly offered Iran Khodro a large cash incentive to end Paykan production by 2005, labelling the car as an environmental hazard because of its unacceptably high fuel consumption. During its last years, the order backlog was nearly two years long. The Samand, commonly referred to as the \\"New Paykan\\", is currently being produced by Iran Khodro as a modern substitute for the Paykan class of cars. In 2005, Iran Khodro announced that it had sold the discontinued Paykan's motorcar production line to the Khartoum Transport Company in Sudan, while car-parts production for the Paykan still continues by third party manufacturers in Iran.

Known for inciting patriotic rebellion among the Filipino clergy, he was also a political activist who became acquainted with Isabelo de los Reyes, who would start an Independent Christian Filipino Church named after Aglipay in 1902. Aglipay was previously excommunicated by Archbishop Bernardino Norzaleda y Villa of Manila in May 1899, upon the expressed permission of Pope Leo XIII. Aglipay later joined Freemasonry in May 1918. Aglipay later married Pilar Jamias y Ver from Sarrat, Ilocos Norte in 1939 and then died one year later. Followers of Aglipay through the church colloquially sometimes refer to their membership as Aglipayans. Early life Born in Batac, Ilocos Norte, Aglipay was an orphan who grew up in the tobacco fields in the last volatile decades of the Spanish occupation of the Philippines. He bore deep grievances against the colonial Spanish government of the islands, stemming from abuses within the agricultural system. Arrested at fourteen when a tobacco-picking worker for not meeting his tobacco quota, he later moved to the capital of Manila to study law under the private tutelage of Julian Carpio.University, Princeton. \\"The Catholic Historical Review, Volume 4\\". American Catholic Historical Association, 1919, p. 320. After two years of study under Carpio, Aglipay continued his studies at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran and at the University of Santo Tomas. After obtaining his degree, he then entered the seminary in Ilocos Sur in 1883 and was ordained to the priesthood seven years later. He began a career as an assistant priest in various parishes around the main northern island of Luzon. While in Victoria, Tarlac, Aglipay gave aid to the revolutionaries and employed thirty carpenters who in reality were revolutionists in touch with the Katipunan group. Despite being a priest, Aglipay, like other revolutionaries, joined Freemasonry. Revolution In 1898, the Katipunan was led by the Supremo, Andr√©s Bonifacio. Archbishop Bernardino Nozaleda asked Aglipay to confront the revolutionary leaders, offering them a level of autonomy in the future for the Philippines if they would end the rebellion. Emilio Aguinaldo, in turn, sent Colonel Luciano San Miguel to Aglipay with the intention of getting him to join the rebellion. In the course of Aglipay's journey north, the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War started. When Aglipay returned to Manila and discovered that the Americans had attacked, he joined the revolution. On 20 October 1898, Gen. Aguinaldo appointed Aglipay Military Vicar General of the revolutionaries. Aglipay interpreted this as making him Ecclesiastical Superior to all Filipino priests who, as such, should all be appointed Military Chaplains for the duration of the war.\\"The First Obispo Maximo, Monsignor Gregorio L. Aglipay\\", Iglesia Filipina Independiente, note 16 Fighting which broke out between the U.S. and Filipino forces on February 4, 1899 prompted Aglipay to withdraw to Ilocos Norte to organize an armed resistance. On 29 April 1899, Aglipay was excommunicated for \\"usurpation of ecclesiastical jurisdiction.Iglesia Filipina Independiente Following the end of the war in 1902, Isabelo de los Reyes was working towards the formation of a national church, that is independent of Rome. On 3 August he suggested that Aglipay be its first bishop. Aglipay, a devout Catholic at the time, was reluctant, but accepted de los Reyes' offer to establish an independent church. On 18 January 1903, Aglipay was appointed Supreme Bishop of the \\"Philippine Independent Church\\". As Supreme Bishop he allied himself with the nationalist and most radical political parties during his time like the Sakdalistas and later on even with the Socialist and Communist Parties. During the theological discussions while visiting other churches while travelling abroad, Aglipay rejected the belief in the Trinity, becoming theologically accepting of the main Unitarian belief however, his own church refused to accept his amended theology. Aglipay's unitarian and progressive theological ideas were evident in his \\"novena\\", \\"Pagsisiyam sa Birhen sa Balintawak\\", 1925Aglipay, Gregorio, Pagsisiyam sa Birhen sa Balintawak , 1925 and its English translation, \\"Novenary of the Motherland\\", 1926.Aglipay, Gregorio, Novenary of the Motherland , 1926 Bishop Gregorio Aglipay bust (Samal, Bataan, \\"Iglesia Filipina Independiente\\" (Philippine Independent Church). Later life Aglipay ran for elections as President of the Commonwealth along with the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas Norberto Nabong in a joined Republican-Communist Party ticket in 1935, but lost to Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osme√±a of the Nacionalista Party. He married D. Pilar Jamias year in 1939 since his church permits married clergy, but Aglipay died the following year on 1 September 1940.

Relatively small for eagles and contrastingly patterned like a falcon, this species was earlier placed in the genus Hieraaetus and sometimes also in the genus Aquila but thought to be distinctive enough to belong to a separate genus. Taxonomy and systematics A captive adult rufous-bellied eagle. This eagle was originally described as Astur kienerii on the basis of a specimen from the Himalayas. It was later moved to Limnaetus by Jerdon, the genus Lophotriorchis and still later to Hieraaetus, the so-called \\"hawk-eagles\\". A study of the phylogeny of some Hieraaetus species and other eagles indicated that they were nested within the Aquila clade of eagles, resulting in their repositioning. Another molecular study of the eagles suggested that kienerii was distinctive enough to be retained in a separate genus for which the name Kienastur had been suggested but as this occurred in a thesis it is invalid for taxonomic purposes, and in any case Lophotriorchis was proposed much earlier (though originally shared with the Black-and-chestnut eagle which is nowadays placed in Spizaetus). Within its wide range, two subspecies are recognized although there is no marked plumage difference. The nominate kienerii of India and Sri Lanka (the northern birds are larger); and formosus described by Erwin Stresemann in 1924 which is widely distributed across Southeast Asia from Burma to Sulawesi. Description Adult rufous-bellied eagles are distinctive in their pattern. They have a black hood with a short crest. Chestnut underparts and wing coverts contrast with the white on the throat and breast. The sexes are almost indistinguishable in plumage but females are slightly larger and have more black on the face. They perch in a very upright stance and the wingtip almost reaches the tail. The tarsus is fully feathered. Juveniles have very white underparts with dark markings on the sides of the body, head mask and edge of underwing coverts. They can appear similar to a booted eagle (Aquila pennata). In flight, the underwing lining is dark and the greater coverts are black. The flight feathers are thinly barred with a black edge. The tail is dark and barred. Distribution and habitat left The rufous-bellied eagle is found in southern and south-eastern Asia and its range also extends to Sulawesi. This species is associated mainly with hill forests. In India, they are commoner in the Western Ghats than along the Himalayas where they occur from Nepal to Assam. They also occur in parts of the Eastern Ghats. Behaviour and ecology Rufous-bellied eagles are usually seen in flight, soaring high over the forest canopy. They dive to capture prey that can include birds and mammals in the air, canopy, or forest floor. Birds the size of the Sri Lanka wood pigeon, Kalij pheasant and junglefowl have been recorded as prey. The breeding season of the eagles is in winter with the young fledging in spring when the prey species are also breeding. The display flight involves stooping and wing-quivering. Their calls include a series of high pitched fwick, fwick... notes followed by a thin sweek!. They nest on a large, often bare tree, building a large platform of dry sticks and branches that they break off. The nest is lined with green leaves and a single egg is laid. Both parents take turns in incubation, feeding and nest defence.

Edward Bond wrote the screenplay, which is loosely based on the 1959 novel Walkabout by James Vance Marshall. Set in the Australian outback, it centres on two white schoolchildren who are left to fend for themselves in the Australian outback and who come across a teenage Aboriginal boy who helps them to survive. One of the first films in the Australian New Wave cinema movement, it received positive reviews despite being a commercial failure. Alongside Wake in Fright, it was one of two Australian films entered in competition for the Grand Prix du Festival at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. It is also held to be one of Roeg's masterpieces, along with Performance (1970), Don't Look Now (1973), and The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976). In 2005, the British Film Institute included it in their list of the \\"50 films you should see by the age of 14\\".  Plot  A white, city-bred teenaged schoolgirl, her younger brother and their father drive far into the Australian outback, ostensibly for a picnic. The father goes berserk and suddenly begins shooting at the children. They run behind rocks for cover, whereupon he sets the car on fire and shoots himself in the head. The girl conceals the suicide from her brother, retrieves some picnic food, and leads him away from the scene, attempting to walk home through the desert. By the middle of the next day, they are weak and the boy can barely walk. Discovering a small water hole with a fruiting tree, they spend the day playing, bathing, and resting. By the next morning, the water has dried up. They are then discovered by an Aboriginal boy. Although the girl cannot communicate with him, due to the language barrier, her brother mimes their need for water and the newcomer cheerfully shows them how to draw it from the drying bed of the oasis. The three travel together, with the Aboriginal boy sharing food he has caught hunting. The boys learn to communicate slightly using words and sign language. While in the vicinity of a plantation, a white woman walks past the Aboriginal boy, who simply ignores her when she speaks to him. She appears to see the other children, but they do not see her, and they continue on their journey. The children also discover a weather balloon belonging to a nearby research team working in the desert. After drawing markings of a modern-style house, the Aboriginal boy eventually leads them to an abandoned farm, and takes the small boy to a nearby road. The Aboriginal boy hunts down a water buffalo and is wrestling it to the ground when two white hunters appear in a truck and nearly run him over. He watches in shock as they shoot several buffalo with a rifle. The boy then returns to the farm, but passes by without speaking. Later, the Aboriginal boy lies in a trance among a slew of buffalo bones, having painted himself in ceremonial markings. He returns to the farmhouse, catching the undressing girl by surprise, and initiates a mating ritual by performing a courtship dance in front of her. Although he dances outside all day and into the night until he becomes exhausted, she is frightened and hides from him, and tells her brother they will leave him the next day. In the morning, after they dress in their school uniforms, the brother takes her to the Aboriginal boy's body, hanging in a tree. Before leaving, the girl wipes ants from the dead boy's chest. Hiking up the road, the siblings find a nearly deserted mining town where a surly employee directs them towards nearby accommodation. Much later, a businessman arrives home as the now grown-up girl prepares dinner; while he embraces her and relates office gossip, she imagines a scene in which she, her brother, and the Aboriginal boy are playing and swimming naked in a billabong in the outback. Cast * Jenny Agutter as Girl * Luc Roeg (credited as Lucien John) as White Boy * David Gulpilil (miscredited as David Gumpilil) as Black Boy * John Meillon as Father * Robert McDarra as Man * Pete Carver as No Hoper * John Illingsworth as Husband * Hilary Bamberger as Woman * Barry Donnelly as Australian Scientist * Noeline Brown as German Scientist * Carlo Manchini as Italian Scientist Themes Jenny Agutter regards the film as multilayered; on one hand it is a story about children lost in the outback finding their way, and on the other it is an allegorical tale about society and the loss of innocence. Louis Nowra noted that biblical imagery runs through the film; in one scene there is a cut to a subliminal flashback of the father's suicide, but the scene plays in reverse and the father rises up as if he has been \\"resurrected\\". Many writers have also drawn a direct parallel between the depiction of the Outback and the Garden of Eden, with Nowra observing that this went as far as to include \\"portents of a snake slithering across the bare branches of the tree\\" above Jenny Agutter's character as she sleeps. Gregory Stephens, an associate professor of English, sees the film framed as a typical \\"back to Eden\\" story, including common motifs from 1960s counterculture; he offers the skinny-dipping sequence as an example of a \\"symbolic shedding of the clothes of the over-civilized world\\". By way of the girl's rejection of the Aboriginal boy and his subsequent death the film paints the Outback as \\"an Eden that can only ever be lost\\". Agutter shares a similar interpretation, noting \\"we cannot go back and have that Garden of Eden. We cannot go back and make it innocent again.\\" Agutter considers the ages of the two adolescents, who are on the cusp of adulthood and losing their childhood innocence, as a metaphor for the irreversible change wrought by Western civilisation.  Production  The film was the second feature directed by Nicolas Roeg, a British filmmaker. He had long planned to make a film of the novel Walkabout, in which the children are Americans stranded by a plane crash. After the indigenous boy finds and leads them to safety, he dies of influenza contracted from them, as he has not been immunised. Roeg had not been able to find a script he was happy with, until the English playwright Edward Bond did a minimal 14-page screenplay. Roeg then obtained backing from two American businessmen, Max Raab and Si Litvinoff, who incorporated a company in Australia but raised the budget entirely in the US and sold world rights to 20th Century Fox. Filming began in Sydney in August 1969 and later moved to Alice Springs, and Roeg's son, Luc, played the younger boy in the film. Roeg brought an outsider's eye and interpretation to the Australian setting, and improvised greatly during filming. He commented, \\"We didn‚Äôt really plan anything‚Äîwe just came across things by chance‚Ä¶filming whatever we found.\\" The film is an example of Roeg's well-defined directorial style, characterised by strong visual composition from his experience as a cinematographer, combined with extensive cross-cutting and the juxtaposition of events, location, or environments to build his themes. The music was composed and conducted by John Barry, and produced by Phil Ramone, and the poem read at the end of the film is Poem 40 from A.E. Housman's A Shropshire Lad.  Reception  Walkabout fared poorly at the box office in Australia. Critics debated whether it could be considered an Australian film, and whether it was an embrace of or a reaction to the country's cultural and natural context. In the US, the film was originally rated R by the MPAA due to nudity, but was reduced to a GP- rating (PG) on appeal. Critic Roger Ebert called it \\"one of the great films\\". He writes that it contains little moral or emotional judgement of its characters, and ultimately is a portrait of isolation in proximity. At the time, he stated: \\"Is it a parable about noble savages and the crushed spirits of city dwellers? That's what the film's surface suggests, but I think it's about something deeper and more elusive: the mystery of communication.\\" Film critic Edward Guthmann also notes the strong use of exotic natural images, calling them a \\"chorus of lizards\\". In Walkabout, an analysis of the film, author Louis Nowra wrote: \\"I was stunned. The images of the Outback were of an almost hallucinogenic intensity. Instead of the desert and bush being infused with a dull monotony, everything seemed acute, shrill, and incandescent. The Outback was beautiful and haunting.\\" Walkabout features several scenes of animal hunting and killing, such as a kangaroo being speared and bludgeoned to death. The Cinematograph Films (Animals) Act 1937 makes it illegal in the United Kingdom to distribute or exhibit material where the production involved inflicting pain or terror on an animal. Since the animals did not appear to suffer or be in distress the film was deemed to not contravene the Act. The film includes scenes of nudity featuring Jenny Agutter, who the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) surmised was 17 years old at the time of filming. The scenes did not pose a problem when submitted to the BBFC in 1971 and later in 1998. The Protection of Children Act 1978 prohibited distribution and possession of indecent images of people under the age of 16 so the issue of potential indecency had not been considered on previous occasions. However, the Sexual Offences Act 2003 raised the age threshold to 18 which meant the BBFC was required to consider the scenes of nudity in the context of the new law when the film was re-submitted in 2011. The BBFC reviewed the scenes and considered them not to be indecent and passed the film uncut. = Legacy = Commenting on the film's enduring appeal, Roeg described the film in 1998 as \\"a simple story about life and being alive, not covered with sophistry but addressing the most basic human themes; birth, death, mutability.\\" More than 40 years after its release, on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a score of 84% based on reviews from 37 critics, with an average rating of 8.2 out of 10.

The series was created by writer John Wagner (under the pseudonym T. B. Grover) and artist Carlos Ezquerra for Starlord, a short-lived weekly science fiction comic, in 1978. When Starlord was cancelled, the series transferred to 2000 AD. In 1980, Wagner was joined by co-writer Alan Grant, although scripts were normally credited to Grant alone. Grant wrote the series solo from 1988 to 1990. After Ezquerra's death in October 2018 the series was put in indefinite hiatus with no current plans for its continuation (other than some single-episode stories in special issues aimed at younger readers). Series background The premise of the series is that the Great Nuclear War of 2150 wiped out 70% of Britain's population and led to a huge increase of mutant births due to exposure to nuclear fallout (strontium-90). The mutants faced a high degree of racism, similar to that faced by the Jewish population of Nazi Germany. Laws were passed forbidding mutants from owning businesses and segregating them into ghettos such as a giant mutant settlement at Milton Keynes. Following the end of this storyline, in 2180, one of the few jobs left for mutants is that of bounty hunter, a job considered too dangerous for normal humans. The strongest of mutants hunt down criminals throughout the galaxy for the Search/Destroy agency, whose distinctive SD badges give them the nickname Strontium Dogs. The SD agents operate from an orbiting space station known as The Doghouse. The mutants of Strontium Dog differ from the usual depiction of mutants in American comics, such as those published by Marvel, in that they are generally afflicted with severe physical deformities and only rarely granted with superhuman powers. Often this leads to humour and character names being puns, as Spider-Dan in the Young Middenface spin-off and skull-faced Welsh mutant Dai the Death in Strontium Dog: Traitor To His Kind. Even by the standards of 2000 AD, Strontium Dog plotlines can be bizarre. In one story, Alpha travels to an alternate dimension that passes for Hell. In another, he is sent by time machine to 1945 to arrest Adolf Hitler. There is a bleak, minimalistic edge to the series at times reminiscent of spaghetti westerns. =Earth= Earth is rarely seen in the strip. When it is, the focus is often New Britain ‚Äì Great Britain after a devastating nuclear war. It is much closer to modern-day Britain than Judge Dredd's Brit-Cit by the same writers, but contains areas of nuclear devastation such as the Greater London Crater and Birmingham Gap; areas known to survive include Salisbury (now a major area and political centre), Glasgow, Newcastle, Dover, Christchurch & Bournemouth (now a combined conurbation), Cardiff, Isles of Scilly, and Winchester. The flying building of Upminster contains both the parliament and the monarchy. In the sequel series Strontium Dogs, it was stated that Britain had a large empire of outer-space colonies. The mutants of New Britain live in ghettos, isolated from the human population and living in poverty. Later stories like Traitor To His Kind would reveal some figures in the government, such as the First Lord of the Military (himself having a mutant daughter) are attempting to slowly improve the mutants' lot, but much of this goes unnoticed behind the scenes; many other figures in the government want to go back to greater oppression or attempted extermination. In The Final Solution, the government was usurped by the New Church and the incumbent monarch killed; the first Strontium Dogs story had it that after the destruction of the New Church by the Strontium Dogs, a hastily assembled junta government exiled all mutants from Britain. Crossroads, in prog 898, revealed that Earth was in a severe political mess, with twenty six \\"minor wars\\", and the rest of the galaxy was cutting ties. The later strip The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha ignored all of this, instead having post-Church New Britain ruled by a more liberal government. Ireland is known to still exist, though little has been shown; the United States of America and Canada were both visited in The Mork Whisperer (2009); and the leader of a West African Mutant Republic was shown in The Final Solution. Antarctica was the setting of part of Outlaw, shown to have been turned into a tropical area with marshes and rainforests by the Rad Wars. The centre was Antarctic City (also the name of a megacity in Judge Dredd), with military and police matters handled by the Antarctic Militia. Johnny Alpha The Strontium Dogs storyline focuses on John Alpha, whose mutated eyes allow him to see through walls and read minds. He is responsible for such legendary achievements as destroying the Wolrog homeworld, leading the mutant uprising on Earth, and bringing Adolf Hitler to the future to face trial. His legendary career and his assistance to mutants in trouble - such as donating a large sum of money to the Milton Keynes ghetto in \\"Mutie's Luck\\" - have made him an icon to Earth's mutants. He is a highly skilled and dangerous fighter. A dogged bounty hunter, Johnny never gives up in the pursuit of his quarry. While he does work for money, he possesses a conscience and will often take a job, forego payment or sometimes drop a job entirely: in \\"The Doc Quince Case\\", he immediately relented and rescued a man he'd hunted down, and in \\"The Slavers of Drule\\" he took an assignment to track down a group of slavers because he felt it was the right thing to do. He also can be extremely vengeful when angered, as shown by his actions towards Nelson Kreelman and Max Bubba. He is the son of Nelson Bunker Kreelman, a bigoted politician who drafted the anti-mutant laws and gained power on the back of bigotry. Despised, abused and hidden away by his father, Johnny escaped at a young age and joined the Mutant Army, becoming one of its key leaders by age 17 and playing a major part in the mutant uprising of 2167. He never revealed the identity of his father, changing his name from Kreelman to Alpha. He has a \\"norm\\" sister called Ruth, who is married and has a husband (Nigel) and daughter. She and her family have traditionally been friendly to Johnny; she even helped him escape and caused Nelson Kreelman's blackmail during the Mutant Army uprising of 2167. However, after her daughter was abducted and almost killed by a criminal looking for revenge on Johnny, she forbade him from coming near her family again. Alpha has a norm half- brother, the son of Nelson Kreelman by an affair, called Nelson Culliver, who after the war became head of the Anti-Mutant Squad at Scotland Yard. In \\"Traitor to His Kind\\", Culliver tried to have Alpha murdered, but was exposed and fired from his job. Alpha decided to assassinate him, but relented on meeting his children. =Weapons/equipment and mutant abilities= Like all Search/Destroy agents, Alpha is armed with highly advanced technology including a variable-cartridge blaster, electrified brass knuckles, a short- range teleporter, a \\"time drogue\\" that can briefly \\"rewind\\" the last few minutes of time, and \\"time bombs\\" which can transport somebody minutes or hours forwards or backwards in time (by which time the planet has moved along in its orbit, so that the victim reappears in empty space). Over the years, Johnny Alpha's white, incandescent eyes have provided him with several mutant abilities. Most frequently, the high-level alpha radiation emitted from his eyes allows Johnny to see through walls and other solid objects, or to read people's minds. He has also used his piercing stare to inflict severe headaches on his opponents, or to \\"suggest\\" illusions or hallucinations (e.g., while fighting the Necromagus, Sabbat, Johnny made Sabbat believe the Grim Reaper was behind him). =Supporting cast= Johnny's original partner is Wulf Sternhammer, who is not a mutant but a normal human from Scandinavia; he became a Strontium Dog out of a sense of camaraderie with Johnny, and, despite the indignities, he viewed it as good work as it kept the galaxy \\"safe for decent people\\".Starlord #1 A blunt and straightforward brawler, Wulf was far less prone to doubt and introspection and tried to bring his friend back in line when he had doubts. Ever since Starlord #5, Wulf wore the fur pelt of a Gronk that he'd befriended - the alien's custom was for people dear to them to wear their skin, so part of them would live on. Wulf acted a lot like a stereotypical Viking and it was eventually retconned that he was a Viking, accidentally brought into the 22nd century when Johnny was pursuing a criminal gang through time. Early strips included the Gronk, the brother of the Gronk that Wulf had met earlier. It was a timid, metal-eating alien from the planet Blas, in the Gallego system (a tribute to the fantasy artist Blas Gallego). The Gronk provided medical back-up and constantly worried about its \\"poor heartses\\", and in \\"Outlaw\\" showed it could survive multiple heart attacks. A gag showed that \\"the Gronk\\" was the name for most of its species, causing problems when mail arrives for \\"the Gronk\\". In the Strontium Dogs spinoff, the Gronk transformed into a gun-toting highly aggressive soldier. King Clarkie the Second, a thinly veiled parody of Prince Charles was the monarch for much of the strip, being deposed late in the series for his pro-mutant views. While presented as a buffoon in several strips, he was also essentially harmless and well-meaning. Two allies who gained their own solo spin-off series were Middenface McNulty, a Scottish mutant raised in a ghetto/concentration camp called 'Shytehill' - presumably a reference to the Sighthill area of Glasgow - and whose head is covered with lumps; and Durham Red, a female agent whose mutation resembles vampirism and who is thus feared and despised by other mutants. Feral, introduced in \\"The Final Solution\\", was a young, savage mutant. He initially despised the Strontium Dogs, who he saw as abandoning the mutants on Earth, but was inspired by the actions of Johnny Alpha. Feral witnessed Alpha's sacrifice in \\"The Final Solution\\", and in the original \\"Strontium Dogs\\" strips of the 1990s, he became first a rebel outlaw in the colony worlds and then a renowned SD Agent. In \\"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\\", this was ignored and he became a SD Agent soon after \\"The Final Solution\\" ‚Äì due to his abrasive personality, he soon left and became an outlaw who tried to resurrect Alpha, only to give up. In this second timeline, he was executed for murder on an alien world. In both the original series and the revival Alpha frequently encountered or worked alongside members of a mutant family known as the Stix Clan. All members male and female are identical in appearance, personality and dress sense. They all hail from a single town called Stixville on the planet Freedonia and are highly hostile to any outsiders. They often appear as antagonist to Alpha but at times have worked alongside him, however they usually double cross and betray him at some point showing only the slightest loyalty to other Stix. There is said to be only one good Stix, Father Phineas who is a Catholic priest, a genuinely good and kind person and thus unmentionable around the rest of the Clan. The revival would introduce Negus, the First Lord of the Military, a stern-faced and middle-aged politician who would both hire Johnny and act as his Upminster contact. Negus was pushing for increased mutant rights, having a mutant daughter that he kept at home (something Johnny remarked as being a brave act for a man in Negus' position), though he still wanted to keep mutant and norm bloodlines separate. Flashbacks to the pre-Wulf days of Johnny's life would introduce Precious Matson, a reporter from the mutant colony of Freedonia. A competent and dogged reporter, she became friends with Johnny and helped him against the terrorist leader Blood Moon. In \\"Life and Death\\", she began investigating the true events of Johnny's death and, with McNulty's aid, was able to resurrect him. In 2018 ‚ÄúThe Son‚Äù revealed that Wulf had had a son, Kenton Sternhammer, who joined the Search/Destroy Agency. =Date= The first Strontium Dog stories in Starlord and 2000 AD were set in the year 2180. Later, the story \\"Max Bubba\\" gave the date 2185 (just as in the Judge Dredd stories by the same writers, the date progresses in real time). However, although the stories \\"The No-Go Job\\" and \\"The Final Solution\\" were said to take place two years after the events in \\"Max Bubba,\\" the date was again given as 2180. This discrepancy was repeated in the story \\"Judgement Day\\" (written by Garth Ennis), which gave the date 2178 even though it was set after the events in \\"Max Bubba.\\" Occasionally, some one-episode stories which appeared in annuals and summer specials were set outside the range of dates given above, being set in different points of Alpha's life. Major stories =Original run= \\"Portrait of a Mutant\\", a flashback story in 1981, filled in the background of the series and Johnny's role in the Mutant Army; it introduced Kreelman and the Kreelers, his quasi-official anti-mutant police. Kreelman drafted laws stating mutants were not allowed to work or own businesses, leading to them being forced from their homes into slums and eventually into being forced into labour camps; the only option for many mutants was to join the nationwide guerilla Mutant Army. An attack was launched on Upminster in 2167 as part of a general uprising, but the Army's leaders were forced to surrender in the face of mass mutant executions. Kreelman used this as an opportunity to push forward the extermination of all mutants; Johnny Alpha and the other leaders escaped (thanks to Johnny's sister and mother) and led the Mutant Army in a second major uprising to prevent genocide. The Prime Minister and King agreed to draft into law a better deal for mutants, and - after hearing Alpha was Kreelman's son from Ruth - blackmailed Kreelman into resigning. The mutant leaders were pardoned on condition they go into exile in space, leading to the creation of the Search/Destroy agency; the Kreelers were disbanded and replaced with a new police force. This changeover was depicted by a panel showing Kreelers, which was then repeated but with a different uniform, showing that the same people and attitudes remained. In the present day, bookending \\"Portrait\\", Johnny tracked his father down and activated a time device, causing his father to relive his final moments: begging for his life, forever. In the story \\"Outlaw\\", Kreelman was later freed, and, in disguise, had himself appointed head of the Search/Destroy agency. He used his position to frame Johnny and other Mutant Army veterans for murder. Johnny was soon made aware of the truth and had no qualms about dragging his own father before the deceived mutants who gunned him down on the spot. In the 1986 story \\"Max Bubba\\", a lengthy story explaining Wulf's origins, Wulf was killed off at the hands of Max Bubba and his gang. This led to the epic \\"Rage\\", in which Johnny remorselessly hunted down his partner's killers. After that Johnny either worked solo, or with Durham Red or Scottish mutant Middenface McNulty. Johnny was killed off in 1990, sacrificing himself to save mutants from extermination at the hands of Kreelman's illegitimate son, Lord Sagan. Artist Carlos Ezquerra disagreed with the decision to kill him and refused to draw it, so Johnny's final adventures were illustrated by Simon Harrison and Colin MacNeil. John Wagner later admitted in Judge Dredd Megazine's Thrill Power Overload feature on the history of the comic that \\"killing off Johnny Alpha was a mistake [that] I'm doing my best to rectify.\\"Judge Dredd Megazine, volume 4, issue 17, p. 49 He later described it as \\"one of the big regrets of my career, probably the biggest.\\"Judge Dredd Megazine #377, 2016. =Post- death and Strontium Dogs= The medium of time travel allowed him to make further appearances. In the 1991 Judge Dredd Annual John Wagner wrote and Colin MacNeil drew \\"Top Dogs\\", in which Johnny and Wulf travel back in time to Mega-City One in pursuit of a criminal, whilst encountering and only narrowly escaping Judge Dredd. Johnny and Dredd renewed acquaintances in 1992 in the Judge Dredd story \\"Judgement Day\\", written by Garth Ennis and drawn mainly by Ezquerra. The supporting cast would gain their own spin-off strip Strontium Dogs in the 1990s, written by Garth Ennis and Peter Hogan. It was criticised by Ennis in the book Thrill Power Overload as being anti-climactic and that the lead, Feral, \\"was nowhere near as interesting as Johnny\\". The series was scrapped when David Bishop became 2000 AD's editor. The first story, Monster starring Feral, revealed the Search Destroy Agency no longer existed and mutants had been driven off Earth by a hastily assembled UK junta government; colony worlds were also shown to be under military occupation and severely ill-treating mutants, with the alleged mutant resistance merely using their organisation to extort \\"liberation\\" taxes from mutants (an allegory for The Troubles in Northern Ireland, Ennis' home). Ennis would bring back the Gronk in Return of the Gronk, turning him into an aggressive berserker: learning that Johnny Alpha was dead caused a heart attack which awakened his aggressive side of this one. The Gronk and Feral were teamed up, and went out for revenge against the necromancers who'd killed Alpha in The Darkest Star. In the process, Feral found out he was the son of the lead necromancer and both he and the Gronk discovered that the necromancers drew their power from torturing the people they had killed ‚Äì including Johnny Alpha. To destroy the enemy, the Gronk killed the captives ‚Äì including, at his friend's request, Alpha himself, who couldn't live on in such excruciating pain. From prog 897, Peter Hogan became the regular writer on the strip and in prog 898 he resurrected the Search Destroy Agency: an agent named Bullmoose revealed that the Galactic Crime Commission had cut ties with Earth (who had pressed for the Agency to be closed and mutants purged), moved to Ganymede, and recreated the agency as they needed mutants to \\"clean their dirty laundry for them\\". Durham Red was given her own solo series, written by Alan Grant, Peter Hogan and later Dan Abnett. This series continued after Strontium Dogs was cancelled. =Revival= In the Prog 2000 holiday special, published at the end of 1999, Johnny Alpha was revived by his original creators, Wagner and Ezquerra. The new stories were set before Johnny's death. The first story, \\"The Kreeler Conspiracy\\", was based on a treatment Wagner had written for an aborted Strontium Dog TV pilot, and featured Johnny working solo, but Wulf returned in subsequent stories. Wagner introduced the concept that all previous stories were 'folklore' and the current series was the truth, giving him free rein to alter a number of details (such as giving Johnny an AI computer assistant and Kreelman having been President of a unified Earth government). This concept was dropped after \\"Conspiracy\\", with the later stories directly harkening back to the original run. A subsequent story in 2004, \\"Traitor To His Kind\\" (progs 1406‚Äì1415), introduced Johnny's half-brother, head of a brutal police unit that dealt with mutant crimes. Hired by pro-mutant First Lord Negus, Johnny was sent to get a kidnapped King Clarkie back from mutant guerillas; loath though he was to do so, he knew elements within the government were trying to use this as an excuse to viciously crack down on mutants. Johnny and Wulf rescue the King, as well as uncovering a conspiracy in the Home Office to allow the kidnapping and subsequently fake the King's murder so as to provide a reason for mutant brutalisation. While this led to an improvement in the lives of mutants, all of it was behind the scenes and Johnny Alpha was branded a traitor by mutants for working against his kind. The 2009 story Blood Moon retconned in a fanatical mutant rebel leader, William Blood Moon, who was responsible for civilian massacres and suicide bombings. Johnny had been seconded to him during the war, and swore vengeance for Moon having his friend Mardi killed as a suicide bomber; years later, before meeting Wulf, he and other former rebel leaders would hunt down Blood Moon to kill him for his continuing terrorist atrocities. Johnny would use a time bomb to take Moon back to the site of Mardi's bombing and executed him there. =The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha= In prog 1689, June 2010, Wagner and Ezquerra began a strip called The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha which took place following The Final Solution. The strip featured reporter Precious Matson trying to discover the true circumstances behind Johnny's death: the story explicitly stated itself to be a retcon and the \\"true\\" story of what happened, and diverged from The Final Solution when Precious revealed to Middenface McNulty that Johnny's body had been brought back by Feral (the original strip showed it destroyed and the remains left behind).2000 AD prog 1689 Mutants remain on Earth, the S/D Agency still exists and has a new Doghouse satellite, and the UK government is said to be \\"apologists and mutie-lovers\\", ignoring Strontium Dogs.Prog 1690 Middenface and Precious went searching for the truth behind Johnny's death and the whereabouts of his body. In the process, they found out that Feral had taken the body on a quest for the Stone Wizards, immensely powerful entities that could bring Johnny back to life ‚Äì but, as the cost would be his own life, he backed out and buried him instead. (Feral would end up executed during the story for unrelated crimes.) Precious and Middenface located the body and took it to the Stone Wizards, where McNulty offered to die so Johnny would live ‚Äì the story ended with Johnny returning to life. The story continued in three further installments from 2011 to 2014. Alpha discovered a conspiracy to secretly sterilise all mutants in New Britain. This revelation led to a new civil war, with Alpha leading the mutant faction. After the conclusion of The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha, the series returned to its bounty-hunter premise. In The Son in 2018 a new character, Wulf Sternhammer's son Kenton, joined Johnny Alpha as a rookie Search/Destroy agent. Hiatus Since the death of artist Carlos Ezquerra in October 2018, the editor of 2000AD, Matt Smith, has said he is yet to decide whether the series should continue without Ezquerra. However he has said that spin off series set around popular supporting characters are in development.2000AD prog 2115, Input section, \\"Strontium Fallout\\" A story starring the Stix Clan was later published in the May 2019 Villains Takeover Special. In 2020 a one- episode story about Johnny Alpha as a child appeared in prog 2183, by Michael Carroll and Nick Brokenshire. Crossover stories Johnny Alpha has also appeared in three Judge Dredd stories, in which he travelled back in time to Dredd's era. The first was Top Dogs, written by John Wagner, which appeared in the Judge Dredd Annual 1991 (published in 1990).

Originally the company was known as E. Remington followed by E. Remington & Son and then E. Remington and Sons. Early years upright Eliphalet Remington II was born in 1793 in the town of Suffield, Connecticut. He was the second child of four surviving children (but the only son) of Eliphalet and Elizabeth (Kilbourn) Remington, whose family origins lay in Yorkshire, England. Eliphalet II followed in his father's footsteps and entered the blacksmith trade at the family's rural forge in Herkimer County, New York. The original family home at Kinne Corners, New York, built about 1810 and known as Remington House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Remington Company co-founder The younger Remington worked with his father in the forge, and at 23 he hand- made a flintlock rifle using a firing mechanism bought from a gunsmith, but constructing the barrel himself. The rifle received such a response that Remington decided to manufacture it in quantity. By 1840, when his three sons began to take a more active role in the family business, he formed the firm of E. Remington and Sons, which he headed until his death in 1861. The company continued to grow and to develop its product and gradually began the manufacture of other sporting goods, such as bicycles. At the present time, the company is known as the Remington Arms Co., Inc.

In 1594, he led an expedition to the West Indies, of which he wrote an account. The illegitimate son of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, he inherited the bulk of the Earl's estate in accordance with his father's will, including Kenilworth Castle. In 1603‚Äì1605, he tried unsuccessfully to establish his legitimacy in court. After that he left England forever, finding a new existence in the service of the grand dukes of Tuscany. There, he worked as an engineer and shipbuilder, and designed and published Dell'Arcano del Mare (1645-1646), the first maritime atlas to cover the whole world. He was also a skilled navigator and mathematician. In Italy, he styled himself \\"Earl of Warwick and Leicester\\", as well as \\"Duke of Northumberland\\", a title recognized by Emperor Ferdinand II. Early life Robert Dudley was the son of Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester and his lover Douglas Sheffield, daughter of William Howard, 1st Baron Howard of Effingham. He grew up in the houses of his father and his father's friends, but had leave to see his mother whenever she wished.Adams 2008a; Adams 2008b His mother married Sir Edward Stafford in November 1579, and then left for Paris. Leicester was fond of his son and often made trips to see him.Warner 1899 p. vi; Wilson 1981 p. 246 Dudley was given an excellent education and was enrolled at Christ Church, Oxford, in 1587, with the status of filius comitis (\\"Earl's son\\"). There, his mentor was Thomas Chaloner, who also became his close friend.Wilson 1981 p. 246 In 1588, when the Spanish Armada threatened England, the 14-year-old Robert joined his father, who was commanding the army at Tilbury Camp, preparing to resist a Spanish invasion, but on 4 September, the Earl of Leicester died.Warner 1899 p. viii His will gave Dudley a large inheritance, including the castle and estate at Kenilworth, and on the death of his uncle, Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, the lordships of Denbigh and Chirk.Wilson 1981 pp. 336‚Äì337 Probable likeness of Robert Dudley, c. 1591National Portrait Gallery Retrieved 2012-06-11 In early 1591, Dudley was contracted to marry Frances Vavasour with the consent of Queen Elizabeth I, who liked Dudley very much but wished him to wait until he was older. Later that year, Vavasour secretly married another man and was banished from court. In turn, the 17-year-old Dudley married Margaret, a sister of Sir Thomas Cavendish, in whose last voyage he had probably invested. Dudley was excluded from court for this secret marriage, but only for a few days. Margaret was given two ships by her father Robert, named the Leicester and the Roebuck. She soon died childless. Expeditions In 1594, Dudley assembled a fleet of ships, including his flagship, the galleon Beare, as well as the Beare's Whelpe, and the pinnaces Earwig and Frisking. He intended to use them to harass the Spaniards in the Atlantic. The Queen did not approve of his plans, because of his inexperience and the value of the ships. She did commission him as a general but insisted that he sail to Guiana, instead. Dudley recruited 275 veteran sailors, including the navigator Abraham Kendal, and the captains Thomas Jobson and Benjamin Wood. Dudley's fleet sailed on 6 November 1594, but a sudden storm separated the ships and drove the vessels back to different ports. Dudley sent word to the captain of the Beare's Whelp to join him in the Canary Islands or Cabo Blanco, and he sailed again. At first, Dudley's trip proved unlucky: the Earwig sank, and most of the vessels he encountered were friendly. Dudley led only one raid in the Gulf of Lagos. In December, the expedition finally managed to capture two Spanish ships at Tenerife. Dudley renamed them Intent and Regard, manned them with his sailors, and put Captain Woods in charge. He sailed to Cabo Blanco, expecting to meet the Beare's Whelpe there, but it did not show up. Dudley's fleet sailed to Trinidad and anchored at Cedros Bay on 31 January 1595. There, he discovered an island that he claimed for the English crown and named Dudleiana. Then he sailed to Paracoa Bay for repairs and made a reconnaissance to San Jose de Oruna, but decided not to attack it. Dudley divided his forces, sending the Intent and Regard to the north. In Trinidad, he recruited a Spanish-speaking Indian who promised to escort an expedition to a gold mine up the Orinoco River. The expedition, led by Captain Jobson, returned after two weeks; as it turned out, their guide had deserted them, and they had struggled back. Dudley returned to Trinidad. On 12 March, Dudley's fleet sailed north, where it finally captured a Spanish merchantman. It then sailed on to Cabo Rojo, in Puerto Rico, waited for suitable prey for some time, and then sailed towards Bermuda. A storm blew the Beare north to near what is now New England before the fleet finally reached the Azores. Low on provisions and working guns, Dudley sailed for home, but he met a Spanish man-of-war on the way. He managed to outmanoeuvre and cripple it in a two-day battle, but decided not to board it. The Beare arrived at St Ives in Cornwall at the end of May 1595, and Dudley heard that Captain Woods had taken three ships. The next year, 1596, Dudley joined Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, to serve as commander of the Nonpareil in an expedition against Cadiz. He was later knighted for his conduct in the Capture of Cadiz, although what he did is not recorded. Shortly afterwards he married Alice, daughter of Sir Thomas Leigh of Stoneleigh. In 1597, Dudley sent Captain Wood on a trading voyage to China with the Beare, the Beare's Whelp and the Benjamin, but they never returned. Claiming legitimacy Dudley claimed to have been told in May 1603, by a shadowy adventurer called Thomas Drury, that his parents had been secretly married.Warner 1899 p. xli He began trying to establish his claim to the peerages of Earl of Leicester and Earl of Warwick, as well as to the property of his deceased uncle Ambrose Dudley, including Ambrose's Warwick Castle estates. The case came before the Star Chamber in 1604‚Äì1605 and aroused great public interest. Ninety witnesses appeared for Dudley and 57 for the widowed Countess of Leicester, Lettice Knollys. Dudley persuaded, and perhaps pressured, his mother to support his cause. She declared in writing (she did not attend the trial in person) that Leicester had solemnly contracted to marry her in Cannon Row, Westminster, in 1571, and that they were married at Esher, Surrey, \\"in wintertime\\" in 1573. Yet all of the 10 putative witnesses (\\"besides others\\") to the ceremony were long since dead. Neither could she remember who the \\"minister\\" was, nor the exact date of the marriage.Warner 1899 pp. xl‚Äìxli; Adams 2008b The Star Chamber rejected the evidence and fined several of the witnesses. It was concluded that Sir Robert Dudley had been duped by Drury, who in his turn had sought \\"his own private gains\\".Warner 1899 p. xlvi King James I ratified the judgement, and it was handed down on 10 May 1605. In 1621, an official investigation in Tuscany, Dudley's new country, concluded that Dudley's \\"friends maintain that his father married Lady Sheffield, but they are unable to account for her marriage during his lifetime, an act so injurious to the alleged legitimacy of her son.\\"Adams 2008a In Italy Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria, one of Dudley's Medici patrons Dudley left England in July 1605, by Calais. His lover and cousin Elizabeth Southwell accompanied him, disguised as a page. She was a daughter of Sir Robert Southwell and Lady Elizabeth Howard, who was a granddaughter of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, Dudley's uncle. The couple declared that they had converted to Catholicism. Dudley married Elizabeth Southwell in Lyon in 1606, after they had received a papal dispensation because they were blood relatives, and they first settled in Florence. In English law, this marriage was bigamous as he was still married to Lady Alice (a marriage not recognised by the Pope as it had taken place in the Church of England). He began to use his father's title of Earl of Leicester and his uncle's title of Earl of Warwick. Dudley designed and built warships for the arsenal of Livorno and became a naval advisor to Ferdinand I, Grand Duke of Tuscany, of the Medici family. He received an annuity of 2,000 ducats. In 1608, Dudley convinced the Duke to send the privateer galleon Santa Lucia Buonaventura to Guiana and northern Brazil in the only tentative of Italian colonization in the Americas, known as the Thornton expedition.Sanfilippo, Matteo. Gli Italiani in Brasile. Edizioni Sette Citta'. Viterbo, 2008 =Attempts at reconciliation= James I revoked Dudley's travel licence in 1607. When he ordered Dudley to return home to provide for his deserted wife and family, Dudley refused. He was then declared an outlaw, and his estate was confiscated. He continued contacts with the English court through Sir Thomas Chaloner, who was now a chamberlain to Henry, Prince of Wales. He corresponded with the young Prince on the subjects of navigation and shipbuilding, and in 1611 tried to broker a marriage between him and Caterina, daughter of Duke Ferdinand. Meanwhile, Henry Frederick had taken a fancy to Kenilworth Castle, calling it \\"the most noble and magnificent thing in the midland parts of this realm\\". Wanting it, he was willing to buy it from Dudley and agreed in 1611 to pay ¬£14,500, with Dudley to hold the office of constable of the castle for his lifetime. When Henry died in 1612, only ¬£3,000 had been paid, and it is unclear whether Dudley ever received it. The new Prince of Wales, Charles, then took possession of the castle but failed to pay the balance owing. In 1621, he got an Act of Parliament allowing Dudley's wife to sell the estate to him for ¬£4,000. Memorial to Robert Dudley's daughter Katherine Dudley and son-in-law Sir Richard Leveson. In 1618, James I granted the Earldoms of Leicester and Warwick to others (Lord Lisle and Lord Rich). In 1620, Dudley convinced Grand Duchess Maria Magdalena, wife of the new duke Cosimo II, to ask her brother, the Emperor Ferdinand II, to recognize his claim to his grandfather's title of Duke of Northumberland. Dudley succeeded on 9 March 1620, and James I severed all negotiations for conciliation. =Later years= Adelhida Paleotti became Charles Talbot's wife in 1705; granddaughter of Robert Dudley In addition to shipbuilding, Dudley was busy with many projects in Tuscany, including the Livorno's breakwater and harbour fortifications, draining local swamps, and building a palace in the heart of Florence. He also designed new galleys, and he wrote his memoirs of navigation and seamanship between 1610 and 1620. Later, Dudley incorporated his notes into six volumes of Dell'Arcano del Mare (The Secret of the Sea), self-published in 1646‚Äì1647. He also wrote a Maritime Directory as a manual for the Tuscan Navy but it was never published. In 1631, his wife Elizabeth died the day after giving birth to her last child. Several of their 13 children married into the Italian nobility. In 1644, King Charles I created Dudley's second wife Alice Duchess of Dudley for life and recognized Dudley's legitimacy but did not restore his titles and estate. Robert Dudley died on 6 September 1649 outside Florence in Villa Rinieri (now Villa Corsini a Castello). He was buried at San Pancrazio in Florence. A son of Dudley was Carlo Dudley, titular Duke of Northumberland who was the father of Maria Cristina Dudley, the second wife of Marquis Andrea Paleottil they were the parents of Adelhida Paleotti who married Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury; there was no issue of this marriage. Despite the marriages of Dudley descendants, \\"No Dudleys in the line male now remained to carry on the name. After the third generation they became extinct in Italy\\".Life of Sir Robert Dudley, Earl of Warwick and Duke of Northumberland By John Temple Leader 1895 In 1660, after the Restoration, Lady Alice, Dudley's second wife (regarded in English law as his legitimate widow), petitioned King Charles II to have her title as Duchess of Northumberland recognised; and for her daughters, Lady Katherine Leveson and Lady Anne Holborne, to be given the rank and precedence of a duchess's daughters. However, the King kept the title in the gift of the Crown, and bestowed it instead on his illegitimate son, George Fitzroy. Dudley bequeathed his estate to Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. His collection of scientific instruments is on display at the Museo Galileo (Galileo Museum, formerly the Institute and Museum of the History of Science) in Florence. Dell'Arcano del Mare: chart of Portugal Dell'Arcano del Mare The most important of Dudley's works was Dell'Arcano del Mare (Secrets of the Sea). It includes a comprehensive treatise on navigation and shipbuilding and it has become renowned as the first atlas of sea charts of the world. Dell'Arcano del Mare consists of six known volumes that illustrate Dudley's knowledge of navigation, shipbuilding and astronomy and it includes 130 original maps, all his own creations and not copied from existing maps, which was unusual for the period. Originally published at Florence in 1645 in Italian, they represent a collection of all contemporary naval knowledge. The atlas also includes a proposal for the construction of a fleet of five rates (sizes) of ships, which Dudley had designed and described. Dell'Arcano del Mare was reprinted in Florence in 1661 without the charts of the first edition. The distinctive character of Dudley's charts was influenced by the Italian baroque engraver Antonio Francesco Lucini. Later mapmakers chose not to copy Dudley's style and so it became a unique and rare relic in the history of cartography. Lucini recorded that he had spent 12 years and 5,000 pounds of copper to produce the plates.

Interview conducted by Catherine Yronwode October 13th and 17th, 1978 The Spirit chronicles the adventures of a masked vigilante who fights crime with the blessing of the city's police commissioner Dolan, an old friend. Despite the Spirit's origin as detective/criminologist Denny Colt, his real identity was rarely referred to after his first appearance, and for all intents and purposes he was simply \\"The Spirit\\". The stories are presented in a wide variety of styles, from straightforward crime drama and noir to lighthearted adventure, from mystery and horror to comedy and love stories, often with hybrid elements that twisted genre and reader expectations. From the 1960s to 1980s, a handful of new Eisner Spirit stories appeared in Harvey Comics and elsewhere, and Warren Publishing and Kitchen Sink Press variously reprinted the newspaper feature in black-and-white comics magazines and in color comic books. In the 1990s and 2000s, Kitchen Sink Press and DC Comics also published new Spirit stories by other writers and artists. In 2011, IGN ranked the Spirit 21st in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of all time. Publication history In late 1939, Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold, publisher of the Quality Comics comic-book line, began exploring an expansion into newspaper Sunday supplements, aware that many newspapers felt they had to compete with the suddenly burgeoning new medium of American comic books, as exemplified by the Chicago Tribune Comic Book, premiering two months before \\"The Spirit Section\\". Arnold compiled a presentation piece with existing Quality Comics material. An editor of The Washington Star liked George Brenner's comic-book feature \\"The Clock\\", but not Brenner's art, and was favorably disposed toward a Lou Fine strip. Arnold, concerned over the meticulous Fine's slowness and his ability to meet deadlines, claimed it was the work of Eisner, Fine's boss at the Eisner & Iger studio, from which Arnold bought his outsourced comics work. In \\"late '39, just before Christmas time\\", Eisner recalled in 1979,Panels #1 (Summer 1979), \\"Art & Commerce: An Oral Reminiscence by Will Eisner\\", pp. 5‚Äì21, quoted in \\"Arnold came to me and said that the Sunday newspapers were looking for a way of getting into this comic book boom\\". In a 2004 interview, Eisner elaborated on that meeting: Eisner negotiated an agreement with the syndicate in which Arnold would copyright the feature but, \\"Written down in the contract I had with 'Busy' Arnold‚Äî and this contract exists today as the basis for my copyright ownership‚Äî Arnold agreed that it was my property. They agreed that if we had a split-up in any way, the property would revert to me on that day that happened. My attorney went to 'Busy' Arnold and his family, and they all signed a release agreeing that they would not pursue the question of ownership.\\" This would include the eventual backup features, \\"Mr. Mystic\\" and \\"Lady Luck.\\" Selling his share of their firm to Iger, who would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio and as Phoenix Features through 1955, for $20,000,Kitchen, Denis. \\"Annotations to The Dreamer, in Eisner, Will, The Dreamer (W.W. Norton & Company, New York City, 2008), p. 52. Eisner left to create \\"The Spirit Section\\". \\"They gave me an adult audience\\", Eisner said in 1997, \\"and I wanted to write better things than superheroes. Comic books were a ghetto. I sold my part of the enterprise to my associate and then began The Spirit. They wanted an heroic character, a costumed character. They asked me if he'd have a costume. And I put a mask on him and said, 'Yes, he has a costume!'\\" The character and the types of stories Eisner would tell, Eisner said in 1978, derived from his desire The character's name, he said in that interview, came from Arnold: \\"When 'Busy' Arnold called, he suggested a kind of ghost or some kind of metaphysical character. He said, 'How about a thing called the Ghost?' and I said, 'Naw, that's not any good,' and he said, 'Well, then, call it the Spirit; there's nothing like that around.' I said, 'Well, I don't know what you mean.,' and he said, 'Well, you can figure that out‚ÄîI just like the words \\"the Spirit.\\"' He was calling from a bar somewhere, I think... [A]nd actually, the more I thought about it the more I realized I didn't care about the name.\\"\\"Will Eisner Interview\\", The Comics Journal #46 (May 1979), p. 37. Interview conducted Oct. 13 and 17, 1978 The Spirit, an initially eight (and later seven) page urban-crimefighter series, ran with the initial backup features \\"Mr. Mystic\\" and \\"Lady Luck\\" in a 16-page Sunday supplement (colloquially called \\"The Spirit Section\\") that was eventually distributed in 20 newspapers with a combined circulation of as many as five million copies.Eisner, The Dreamer, \\"About the Author\\", p. 55 It premiered June 2, 1940, and continued through 1952.

Note the innovative use of title design, the mix of color and black-and-white, and the shadowing and texturing that combine for exotic noir effect. Other Spirit stories could be whimsical, gritty, folklorish, sentimental, horrific, or mystical, yet always humanistic. Eisner was drafted into the U.S. Army in late 1941, \\"and then had about another half-year which the government gave me to clean up my affairs before going off\\" to fight in World War II. In his absence, the newspaper syndicate used ghost writers and artists to continue the strip, including Manly Wade Wellman, William Woolfolk, Jack Cole and Lou Fine.Eisner, Will (2003). Will Eisner's The Spirit Archive, Volume 10, January 7 to June 24 1945 DC Comics. () Eisner's rumpled, masked hero (with his headquarters under the tombstone of his supposedly deceased true identity, Denny Colt) and his gritty, detailed view of big-city life (based on Eisner's Jewish upbringing in New York City) both reflected and anticipated the noir outlook of movies and fiction in the 1940s.Rzepka, Charles J., Lee Horsley (2010). A Companion to Crime Fiction. Wiley. p. 338. . Eisner said in 2001 that he created the strip as a vehicle to explore various genres: \\"When I created The Spirit, I never had any intention of creating a superhero. I never felt The Spirit would dominate the feature. He served as a sort of an identity for the strip. The stories were what I was interested in.\\"Eisner Wide Open, Hogan's Alley #11, 2001 In some episodes, the nominal hero makes a brief, almost incidental appearance while the story focuses on a real-life drama played out in streets, dilapidated tenements, and smoke-filled back rooms. Yet along with violence and pathos, the feature lived on humor, both subtle and overt. He was shot, knocked silly, bruised, often amazed into near immobility and constantly confused by beautiful women.Steranko, Jim (1972). The Steranko History of Comics 2. Supergraphics. pp. 115‚Äì116. The feature ended with the October 5, 1952, edition. As The Comics Journal editor- publisher Gary Groth wrote, \\"By the late '40s, Eisner's participation in the strip had dwindled to a largely supervisory role. ... Eisner hired Jerry Grandenetti and Jim Dixon to occasionally ink his pencils. By 1950, Jules Feiffer was writing most of the strips, and Grandenetti, Dixon, and Al Wenzel were drawing them.\\" Grandenetti, who penciled as a ghost-artist under Eisner's byline, said in 2005 that before the feature's demise, Eisner had \\"tried everything. Had me penciling 'The Spirit'. Later on it was Wally Wood\\", who drew the final installments. Fictional character biography The Spirit, referred to in one newspaper article cited below as \\"the only real middle- class crimefighter\\", was the hero persona of young detective/criminologist Denny Colt.Eisner, Will (2015). Will Eisner's The Spirit: A Celebration of 75 Years DC Comics. () p.9 Presumed killed in the first three pages of the premiere story, Colt later revealed to his friend, Central City Police Commissioner Dolan, that he had in fact gone into suspended animation caused by one of archvillain Dr. Cobra's experiments. When Colt awakened in Wildwood Cemetery, he established a base there (underneath his own tombstone) and, using his new-found anonymity, began a life of fighting crime wearing a simple costume consisting of a blue domino mask, business suit, fedora hat and gloves (plus a white shirt and red necktie). While elements of this basic costume occasionally vary (depending on the Spirit's circumstances and where he is in the world), he is always depicted wearing his blue domino mask and blue leather gloves.Eisner, Will (2015). Will Eisner's The Spirit: A Celebration of 75 Years DC Comics. () The Spirit dispensed justice with the aid of his assistant, Ebony White, funding his adventures with an inheritance from his late father, Denny Colt Snr, and the rewards for capturing villains.Eisner, Will (1989). The Spirit #56 Kitchen Sink Press Inc. () p.6 The Spirit originally was based in New York City, but this was quickly changed to the fictional \\"Central City\\". Not tied to one locale, his adventures took him around the globe and even to the moon. He met eccentrics, kooks, and femme fatales, bringing his own form of justice to all of them. The story changed continually, but certain themes remained constant: the love between the Spirit and Dolan's feisty protofeminist daughter Ellen; the annual \\"Christmas Spirit\\" stories; and the Octopus (a psychopathic criminal mastermind who was never seen, except for his distinctive purple gloves).Eisner, Will (2015).

Eisner was criticized for his depiction of Ebony White, the Spirit's African-American sidekick. The character's name is a racial pun, and his facial features, including large white eyes and thick pinkish lips, are typical of racial blackface caricatures popular throughout the \\"Jim Crow\\" era. Eisner later admitted to consciously stereotyping the character, but said he tried to do so with \\"responsibility\\", and argued that \\"at the time humor consisted in our society of bad English and physical difference in identity\\".Eisner interview, The character, who was consistently treated with respect by the strip's fellow cast-members, developed beyond the stereotype as the series progressed, and Eisner also introduced such African- American characters as the no-nonsense Detective Grey who defied popular stereotypes. Ebony debuted as a resourceful taxi driver in the first \\"Spirit Section\\". He became a mainstay of the strip and a principal member of the Spirit's supporting cast until Eisner phased him out of the narrative in mid-1949 and replaced him with another assistant, a Caucasian boy named Sammy. Ebony's last \\"starring\\" role in a Spirit story (a semi-regular event in which he was the focus of the story rather than the Spirit himself) was \\"Young Dr. Ebony\\", published on May 29, 1949. Sammy first appeared in \\"The Ballgame\\", published July 31, 1949, part of a six-episode arc set in the South Seas, in which Ebony does not appear. Sammy returns to Central City with the Spirit in \\"The Return\\", published August 14, 1949, and is welcomed into the cast by Ebony, Commissioner Dolan and Ellen Dolan. Ebony makes two wordless, one-panel appearances in the next two installments, \\"The Candidate\\" and \\"White Cloud\\" (August 21 and 28, 1949) before making his final appearance in five panels of \\"Lurid Love\\" (September 18, 1949). After this (and apart from one final mention of his name in the text-based splash page of \\"The Inner Voice\\", published November 6, 1949), Ebony left the strip without fanfare or explanation, and Sammy functioned as the Spirit's assistant for the strip's final three years.Eisner, Will (2006). Will Eisner's The Spirit Archives, Volume 19, July 3 to December 25, 1949 DC Comics. () An adult Ebony appears as an office worker in a one-off Spirit story that appeared January 9, 1966, in the New York Herald Tribune. In an accompanying feature article in issue of the New York Herald Tribune, Eisner's former office manager Marilyn Mercer wrote, \\"Ebony never drew criticism from Negro groups (in fact, Eisner was commended by some for using him), perhaps because, although his speech pattern was early Minstrel Show, he himself derived from another literary tradition: he was a combination of Tom Sawyer and Penrod, with a touch of Horatio Alger hero, and color didn't really come into it\\".Mercer, Marilyn, \\"The Only Real Middle-Class Crimefighter\\", New York (Sunday supplement, New York Herald Tribune), Jan. 9, 1966; reprinted in Alter Ego #48 (May 2005) Other characters *Dr. Cobra is a mad scientist whose chemicals and machinations inadvertently help Denny Colt become the Spirit. *Darling O' Shea is the richest and most spoiled child in the world. *Hazel P.

The first name is a pun on sitz bath. *P'Gell is a femme fatale who perennially tries to seduce the Spirit to a life of crime at her side. She seduces and marries wealthy men who invariably die in mysterious ways, and uses their money to fund her crime empire in Istanbul and expand her influence and control over the underworld. After moving to Central City to find the Spirit, she continues her modus operandi of selected marriages with the cream of society, even gaining an ally in the form of Saree, the young daughter of one of her deceased husbands. In the 2000s DC Comics version, P'Gell was once a young socialite in love with a doctor, working in Third World countries, and turned to a life of crime when he was killed. (Vide Pigalle.) *P.S. Smith (\\"Peppermint Stick\\" Smith AKA Algernon Tidewater) is a silent, baseball helmet-wearing associate of Ebony. Always sucking on a peppermint stick and appearing to be 6-8 years of age, the wordless P.S. is capable of almost-superhuman feats (always played for comedic effect) and serves as Eisner's comic embodiment of anarchy and disruption. P.S. first appeared in The Philadelphia Enquirer as the star of a silent pantomime strip appearing underneath the main Spirit story, before Eisner introduced the character within the main strip (as Algernon Tidewater) in 1941. The character was renamed P.S. in his first postwar appearance in May 1946.Eisner, Will (2008). Comics and Sequential Art: Principles and Practices from the Legendary Cartoonist. W.W.

The initial lines of were first uttered in the story \\"Poole's Toadstool Facial Cream\\" (June 9, 1946). By the end of 1946, all of the lyrics had appeared, sung by various characters. In 1947, Eisner collaborated with his World War II service friend Bill Harr, who composed a melody for Eisner's lyrics. The complete song appears in the April 27, 1947 \\"Spirit Section\\", here titled \\"Ev'ry Li'l Bug\\", with Ebony credited within the storyline as its composer. In the story \\"Wiffenpoof\\" (June 29, 1947), real-life operatic singer Robert Merrill was depicted singing the tune. Shortly afterward, the Robbins Music Corporation of New York published \\"Ev'ry Little Bug\\" as sheet music, with an image of Ebony on its cover page. After three more appearances in the strip, \\"Ev'ry Little Bug\\" remained dormant until 1987, when music producer John Christensen assembled a recording featuring five versions of the tune, released by Kitchen Sink as a picture disc with an exclusive Spirit/Ebony image illustrated by Eisner on one side and the original art for the sheet music on the other. The record featured actor Billy Mumy playing guitar on some tracks. =Song appearances= *June 9, 1946 - \\"Poole's Toadstool Facial Cream\\" *July 7, 1946 - \\"Dulcet Tone\\" *October 13, 1946 - \\"The Heart of Rosie Lee\\" *December 15, 1946 - \\"The Van Gaul Diamonds\\" *December 29, 1946 - \\"Hubert The Duck\\" *February 2, 1947 - \\"The Cosmic Answer\\" *March 16, 1947 - \\"Hoagy the Yogi\\" *April 27, 1947 - \\"Ev'ry Li'l Bug\\" *June 29, 1947 - \\"Wiffenpoof\\" *August 17, 1947 - \\"The Picnic\\" *March 27, 1949 - \\"The Dummy\\" *April 30, 1950 - \\"Wanted, Dangerous Job\\" The Spirit and John Law Several Spirit stories, such as the first appearance of Sand Saref, were retooled from a failed publishing venture featuring an eyepatched, pipe-smoking detective named John Law. Law and his shoeshine-boy sidekick, Nubbin, starred in several adventures planned for a new comics series. These completed adventures were eventually adapted into Spirit stories, with John Law's eyepatch being changed to the Spirit's mask, and Nubbin redrawn as Willum Waif or other Spirit supporting characters. The original John Law stories were restored and published in Will Eisner's John Law: Dead Man Walking (IDW Publishing, 2004), a collection of stories that also features new adventures by writer-artist Gary Chaloner, starring John Law, Nubbin, and other Eisner creations, including Lady Luck and Mr. Mystic. Assistants and collaborators Like most artists working in newspaper comic strips, Eisner after a time employed a studio of assistants who, on any given week's story, might draw or simply ink backgrounds, ink parts of Eisner's main characters (such as clothing or shoes), or as eventually occurred, ghost-draw the strip entirely. Eisner also eventually used ghostwriters, generally in collaboration with him. Jules Feiffer, who began as an art assistant circa 1946 and later became the primary writer through the strip's end in 1952, recalled, \\"When I first worked for Will there was John Spranger, who was his penciler and a wonderful draftsman; better than Will. There was Sam Rosen, the lettering man. Jerry Grandenetti came a little after me and did backgrounds, and Jerry had some architectural background. His drawing was stiff but loosened up after a while, but he drew backgrounds and inked them beautifully. And Abe Kanegson, who was my best friend in the office, was a jack-of-all- trades but mostly did lettering and backgrounds after Jerry left. Abe was a mentor to me.\\"Transcript of March 24, 2010, Feiffer interview at the Museum of Comic and Cartoon Art, published as Eisner's studio also included:Spirit, The (Register and Tribune Syndicate, 1940 Series) at the Grand Comics Database Main page archived from the original on July 4, 2012. *Art assistants: Bob Powell (1940), Dave Berg (backgrounds, 1940‚Äì41), Tex Blaisdell (1940‚Äì41), Fred Kida (1941), Alexander Kostuk a.k.a.

The first of these two 60-page issues opened with a new seven-page retelling of the Spirit's origin by writer-penciler-inker Eisner (with inking assist by Chuck Kramer). Also new was the text feature \\"An Interview With the Spirit\\", credited to Marilyn Mercer; and writer-artist Eisner's two-page featurette \\"Spirit Lab: Invincible Devices\\". Seven 1948‚Äì1949 Spirit stories were reprinted.The second issue opened with a new seven-page story by writer-artist Eisner, \\"Octopus: The Life Story of the King of Crime,\\" giving the heretofore unrevealed origin of the Spirit's nemesis The Octopus, as well as his given name (Zitzbath Zark).

In the mid-2000s, DC Comics began reprinting the feature \\"The Spirit\\" chronologically in the company's hardcover Archive series, in an approximately 8x10-inch format, smaller than the Kitchen Sink and Warren publications. Eisner's final Spirit story appeared in the sixth issue of The Amazing Adventures of the Escapist, from Dark Horse Comics, published on April 20, 2005. This 6-page story featured a crossover between the Spirit and the book's lead character, the Escapist. =DC Comics= The DC Comics one-shot Batman/The Spirit (January 2007), by writer Jeph Loeb and artists Darwyn Cooke and J. Bone introduced the Spirit into the DC Universe. The first issue of the ongoing series The Spirit, written and pencilled by Cooke and inked by J. Bone, debuted the following month. The series updated some concepts, with Ellen's Internet skills helping to solve a case, and Ebony White stripped of his racial stereotype characteristics. The team of Mark Evanier and Sergio Aragones became the series' regular writers beginning with issue #14 (March 2008), with Mike Ploog and later Paul Smith providing the artwork. DC'S The Spirit series ran through issue #32 (Aug. 2009), with most running a single 22-page story. The imprint First Wave, launched in January 2010, featured the Spirit, pulp heroes Doc Savage and The Avenger, and DC's Rima the Jungle Girl, the Blackhawks, and a Golden Age incarnation of Batman into a DC \\"pulpverse\\" overseen by writer Brian Azzarello.

In other media =Comic strip= From October 13, 1941 to March 11 1944, there was also a black-and-white daily newspaper comic strip starring the Spirit. These were later reprinted in several collections, including the complete run in DC's The Spirit Archives Volume 25. In early 2017, the Spirit returned to newspaper strips as a guest-star in Dick Tracy by Mike Curtis (script) and Joe Staton (art), continuing the trend of Tracy stories reviving characters from defunct strips. =TV-movie= The character was the subject of a 1987 ABC television movie starring Sam J. Jones as the Spirit, Nana Visitor as Ellen Dolan, and Garry Walberg as Commissioner Dolan. The film served as a pilot for a planned TV series. =Planned animated movie= An animated feature to be directed by Brad Bird was in development in the 1980s. Steven Paul Leiva, animator Jerry Rees, and producer Gary Kurtz also were involved, and a presentation trailer was produced. The Spirit's voice was supplied by animator Randy Cook. =Film= The film adaptation The Spirit, written and directed by Frank Miller, was released in theaters by Lionsgate on December 25, 2008. The film stars Gabriel Macht as the Spirit and Samuel L. Jackson as the Octopus. =Radio= Denis Kitchen, the Eisner estate's agent, said in a July 8, 2006 online interview that a radio series had been in development: \\"It was pitched to the estate by a couple of producers, one of whom is very experienced with NPR, so we have been back and forth on how that would work.

Cooperative Linux utilizes the concept of a Cooperative Virtual Machine (CVM). In contrast to traditional virtual machines, the CVM shares resources that already exist in the host OS. In traditional VM hosts, resources are virtualized for every (guest) OS. The CVM gives both OSs complete control of the host machine while the traditional VM sets every guest OS in an unprivileged state to access the real machine.  Overview  Synaptic and nautilus running on Windows The term \\"cooperative\\" is used to describe two entities working in parallel. In effect Cooperative Linux turns the two different operating system kernels into two big coroutines. Each kernel has its own complete CPU context and address space, and each kernel decides when to give control back to its partner. However, while both kernels theoretically have full access to the real hardware, modern PC hardware is not designed to be controlled by two different operating systems at the same time. Therefore, the host kernel is left in control of the real hardware and the guest kernel contains special drivers that communicate with the host and provide various important devices to the guest OS. The host can be any OS kernel that exports basic primitives that allow the Cooperative Linux portable driver to run in CPL0 mode (ring 0) and allocate memory.  History  Dan Aloni originally started the development of Cooperative Linux based on similar work with User-mode Linux. He announced the development on 25 Jan 2004.Dan Aloni announces Cooperative Linux In July 2004 he presented a paper at the Linux Symposium. The source was released under the GNU General Public License. Other developers have since contributed various patches and additions to the software.  Comparisons  Cooperative Linux is significantly different from full x86 virtualization, which generally works by running the guest OS in a less privileged mode than that of the host kernel, and having all resources delegated by the host kernel. In contrast, Cooperative Linux runs a specially modified Linux kernel that is Cooperative in that it takes responsibility for sharing resources with the NT kernel and not instigating race conditions.  Distribution  Most of the changes in the Cooperative Linux patch are on the i386 tree‚Äîthe only supported architecture for Cooperative at the time of this writing. The other changes are mostly additions of virtual drivers: cobd (block device), conet (network), and cocon (console). Most of the changes in the i386 tree involve the initialization and setup code. It is a goal of the Cooperative Linux kernel design to remain as close as possible to the standalone i386 kernel, so all changes are localized and minimized as much as possible. The coLinux package installs a port of the Linux kernel and a virtual network device and can run simultaneously under a version of the Windows operating system such as Windows 2000 or Windows XP. It does not use a virtual machine such as VMware. Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora and Gentoo are especially popular with the coLinux users. Due to the rather unusual structure of the virtual hardware, installing Linux distributions under coLinux is generally difficult. Therefore, users in most cases use either an existing Linux installation on a real partition or a ready made filesystem image distributed by the project. The filesystem images are made by a variety of methods, including taking images of a normal Linux system, finding ways to make installers run with the strange hardware, building up installs by hand using the package manager or simply upgrading existing images using tools like yum and apt. An easier way to get an up-to-date filesystem image is to use QEMU to install Linux and \\"convert\\" the image by stripping off the first 63 512-byte blocks as described in the coLinux wiki. Since coLinux does not have access to native graphics hardware, X Window or X Servers will not run under coLinux directly, but one can install an X Server under Windows, such as Cygwin/X or Xming and use KDE or GNOME and almost any other Linux application and distribution. All of these issues are fixed by using coLinux based distributions such as andLinux, based on Ubuntu, or TopologiLinux, based on Slackware.

It stars Mark Wahlberg, Reese Witherspoon, William Petersen, Alyssa Milano and Amy Brenneman. It revolves around a wealthy family whose seemingly perfect life is threatened when their teenage daughter begins dating an attractive and mysterious young man. The film was largely derided by critics upon its release, but became a sleeper hit in the spring of 1996, grossing $20 million at the U.S. box office. It has since become a cult film, while at the same time launching teen idol status for its two young leads, who were romantically linked at the time of the movie's premiere. Wahlberg was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain. The film's executive producer, Brian Grazer, described it as \\"Fatal Attraction for teens\\" ‚Äì a loose recollection in which Wahlberg and Witherspoon have the Glenn Close and Michael Douglas roles, respectively, while Petersen is in Anne Archer's. Plot 16-year-old Nicole Walker (Reese Witherspoon) lives in the suburbs of Seattle with her father Steven (William Petersen), his new wife Laura (Amy Brenneman), and Laura's son Toby (Christopher Gray). At a bar with her best friend Margo (Alyssa Milano) and friend Gary (Todd Caldecott), Nicole meets David McCall (Mark Wahlberg), and instantly falls for his good looks and charm. Nicole falls in love with David, but Steven dislikes him, and grows angry with him when he disregards Nicole's curfew and, eventually, takes her virginity. David soon becomes possessive and jealous of Nicole, culminating in attacking Gary when he sees them hugging, beating him up and giving Nicole a black eye. As a result, she breaks up with him, but they get back together when David manipulates her into believing her father assaulted him. David invites Nicole to a party at his friend Logan's (Tracy Fraim) house. At first, she declines but then decides to drive to the party, where she witnesses Margo smoking crack and, apparently, having sex with David. The following day, she confronts him about his infidelity, and also confronts Margo, who insists that David raped her. David then threatens Margo to convince Nicole to take him back. After seeing Nicole with Gary, David follows and kills him. Nicole goes with Laura and Toby to the mall, where David corners her in the women's restroom. Meanwhile, Steven finds his car vandalized with an insulting note left by David. Furious, Steven breaks into the house David shares with Logan and vandalizes it. In retaliation for Steven's vandalism, David decides to break into the Walkers' residence with his four friends: Logan, Hacker (Gary Riley), Knobby (Jed Rees), and Terry (Jason Kristofer). After Margo informs the Walkers of Gary's death, David and his gang behead Kaiser, the family dog, then make multiple attempts to break inside. Steven and Laura barricade the doors, and Laura injures Hacker with a drill, and he is then taken to the hospital by Knobby. Using a flashlight, Nicole sends an SOS to the Walker's private security guard, Larry, who arrives to confront the situation, but is killed by Terry. David, Logan, and Terry take Steven hostage, forcing Laura to surrender. Toby escapes through a window and gets to Laura's car phone. After Terry finds him in the garage, Toby fatally runs Terry over with the SUV. Logan forces himself onto Nicole; Margo intervenes, but is knocked unconscious. David shoots Logan dead for attempting to rape Nicole. After Toby retrieves Larry's keys and releases his parents, Steven rushes at David and the pair get into a furious brawl. David gets ready to execute Steven but Nicole stabs David in the back with a peace pipe (a gift from David himself). Steven then throws David through the bedroom window to his death. Moments later, police and paramedics arrive.

Reception The film holds a 46% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 37 reviews, with an average rating of 5.06/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"Fear has an appealing young cast, but their efforts aren't enough to consistently distract from an increasingly overblown - and illogical - teen stalker story\\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"Fear is hard to resist. On one hand it's a shameless thriller that makes up for the inevitability of its story by consistently being bigger, faster and more appalling than you might expect. On the other hand, it contains enough truth about fathers, teenaged daughters and young lust to distinguish it from most thrillers and ground it in vivid emotion. It is a nightmare fantasy for fathers. Director James Foley and screenwriter Christopher Crowe keep raising the stakes all the way to a finish that's something out of The Straw Dogs. It's a maddening, satisfying, junky, enjoyable picture.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a positive review, further accrediting the comparisons to Fatal Attraction, writing: \\"Fear is a teen Fatal Attraction, and ‚Äî surprise ‚Äî it isn‚Äôt bad.\\" He did, however, criticise the finale: \\"[Director] James Foley does a fine job evoking the sexual tensions between father, daughter, and rogue suitor, but he has less luck with the (inevitable) garish climax, which is so unconvincingly staged it never even makes it over the top\\". Gene Siskel gave the film a thumbs-down while Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs-up. Siskel called the picture \\"Predictable trash with an 'inspired' title, and with a third act which nosedives into pure mayhem...It's shocking that such a film was made by the same director who gave us At Close Range, After Dark, My Sweet, and Glengary Glen Ross; this one is not worthy of his talent. It should have been titled Who's That Boy.\\" Ebert, however, claimed the movie \\"generates genuine psychological interest, with an effective and suspenseful portrait of a family under siege.\\" Siskel & Ebert @ the Movies: April 21, 1996 Movie historian Leonard Maltin gave the picture 2/4 stars: \\"This passable slasher epic benefits from taut, stylish direction and from decent performances; still, it's awfully derivative -- especially the climactic showdown. Mark Wahlberg is menacing as the lovestruck hood, but he could benefit from diction lessons.\\" Maltin's TV, Movie & Video Guide Critical revaluation of the film has proved more positive than its initial reception, with Carter Burwell's score being especially well-received. One critic has since stated that \\"although dismissed by some reviewers upon its release as a sensationalist, hysterical, formulaic piece, Fear has improved with age\\". The film was placed as No. 19 on Bravo TV's \\"30 Even Scarier Movie Moments\\".

It follows the adventures of Rogue, a \\"Genetic Infantryman\\", a genetically engineered, blue-skinned, super soldier and his three comrades' search for the Traitor General. His comrades are in the form of biochips ‚Äì onto which a GIs entire personality is downloaded at the time of death for later retrieval ‚Äì and are named Gunnar (mounted on Rogue's rifle), Bagman (on his backpack) and Helm (on his helmet). He is genetically engineered to be immune to almost all known toxins, can submerge in strong acid unaffected, and is able to withstand a vacuum in his bare skin. The series was rebooted in 1989 in the story \\"The War Machine,\\" featuring a new version of the character called Friday. This version of the character last appeared in 1996. The original character returned in 1999 and all stories since then have featured the original Rogue. The character has also featured in a number of 2000 AD crossovers. Publication history Gibbons left the strip early on, to be replaced by a succession of artists and writers who have taken the strip in several different directions over the years. Artists to have drawn the character include Brett Ewins, Cam Kennedy and Colin Wilson. This quest continued from 1981 until 1985, when the G.I. had his final confrontation with the traitor general and, after a brief further run set on the Planet Horst, Finley-Day ceased writing the strip. Simon Geller took over, reinventing the character as an intergalactic hitman attempting to end the war by assassinating key figures, but this new direction was dropped in 1989. John Smith wrote a 'flashback' story, \\"Cinnabar\\", set in Rogue's deserter days, before original series artist Dave Gibbons returned to write a much more radical revamp of the character. In \\"The War Machine\\", Gibbons and artist Will Simpson created a different war, set on a different planet, starring a different Genetic Infantryman, this time called Friday. The bio- chips were dropped, and Gibbons concentrated on the politics and economics of war and the sinister nature of the genetic engineering involved. A new ongoing series featuring Friday followed, written by American writer Michael Fleisher. In Fleisher's final story, \\"Scavenger of Souls\\", the bio-chips are reintroduced via an alien 'soul collector'. Fleischer was replaced with Steve White, who made the military aspect of the strip more up-to-date and tried to reconcile the two versions of the character. He also reintroduced Venus Bluegenes (Helm's treacherous girlfriend from an earlier story who gained a more prominent role during the Simon Geller run) who had her own short spin- off run. His run on the character was the 2000 AD debut of artist Henry Flint. The character was rested after White's last story in 1996. In 1997 a related character, blue-skinned ambulance pilot Tor Cyan was introduced in the story Mercy Heights. In 2002 the original Rogue was reintroduced, again in flashback to his days hunting the traitor general, written by Gordon Rennie. Artists have included Staz Johnson, Dylan Teague, Mike Collins, Simon Coleby and PJ Holden. In 2004 Rennie statedGordon Rennie interview , 2000 AD Review, 4 June that he had intended to revamp the character yet again, but had been blocked by 2000 AD editorial. He also hints that any return to the Rogue Trooper universe will concentrate on supporting cast and not include the Rogue character. This can be seen in the new series The 86ers. Plot synopsis The story is initially set on the planet Nu-Earth, where a war of attrition between the Norts and Southers is being fought. There is some similarity to both the American Civil War and to World War I, with the Norts resembling Germany, and the Southers the Allied forces. During the conflict, the use of chemical and biological weapons have poisoned the planet's atmosphere and oceans. As a result, what remains of the population of the planet, including the troops of both sides, live in enclosed domed military bases and habitats. They wear protective suits, helmets and respiration gear when outside their domes. These suits are known as \\"chemsuits\\". Any damage to the helmet or chemsuit is usually fatal to the wearer. In an attempt to bring an end to the stalemate, the Southern High Command have created the GI, or \\"Genetic Infantryman\\". The GI is a soldier genetically engineered to be immune to the poisonous atmosphere of Nu-Earth, and therefore be able to fight without chemsuits. The Southern High Command deploy the entire GI Regiment in a mass spaceborne capsule drop over an area known as \\"The Quartz Zone\\", which resembles one of the Earth's Poles because the surface has an icy, glacier- like nature. The assault was intended to be a surprise attack, but because a traitor within the Southern High Command has passed details of it to the Norts, they are expecting the attack. The Norts employ elite infantry known as the Kashan and Kashar Legions to repulse the assault, and the entire GI Regiment - apart from Rogue - is wiped out. This event is referred to as \\"The Quartz Zone Massacre\\". Rogue, the only surviving G.I., goes AWOL in order to track down the traitor. Along the way he thwarts numerous Nort schemes, discovers and inadvertently destroys the only portion of Nu-Earth not contaminated by chemical weapons, and is betrayed by every female character he encounters. A later storyline ‚Äì \\"MilliCom Memories\\" ‚Äì shows how the GIs progress through their training, and that rather than a name each GI has a letter suffixed by their age. Rogue is \\"R\\", Gunnar \\"G\\", Helm \\"H\\" and Bagman \\"B\\". Two other troopers \\"D\\" and \\"N\\" are referenced in the storyline. During their training each GI is given a nickname - Gunnar is so named because of his marksmanship ability. Millicom Memories showed there were other prototype GIs before the development of Rogue's class, some of which were killed during his training. In a multi-part story titled \\"The Marauders\\", Rogue encounters a group of deserters from both Nort and Southern sides, who operate as scavengers from a hidden base and attack both Nort and Southers in order to obtain food, ammunition and supplies. Unknown to Rogue, the commander of The Marauders is the Traitor General. Due to accident the General was severely burned and is now unrecognisable. The General later reveals himself to Rogue, then captures and tortures him. Rogue eventually escapes, and with the help of one of the Marauders (a Souther pilot known as 'Player'), defeats the Marauders that pursue him. The Traitor General escapes, destroying the Marauder base as he does so. In \\"All Hell on the Dix-I Front\\" a massive Nort assault forces the Southerners to retreat from a vast area of Nu-Earth, similar to the Ardennes assault of World War II. During this, other Elite units of the Nort military are introduced, such as the Sun Legion, a Regiment of solar glider troops, and the Scum Marines, an amphibious assault force. \\"Sister Sledge\\",a pun on the pop group of the same name a military nurse accompanied Rogue during the Dix-I campaign. She is secretly an enemy agent known as a \\"filth columnist\\"a play on fifth columnist and dies in the final episode of the series when Bagman causes her to fall from a boat into the heavily polluted and toxic \\"Scum Sea\\". \\"Fort Neuro\\" introduced a defensive line that has been cut off from both Southers and Norts since the beginning of the war. The Fort has been split into separate sectors by the same clouds, meaning each sector operates independently of each other, without any contact or cohesion. The soldiers within each sector are suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder so the French sector ‚Äì known as \\"Franks\\" ‚Äì wear Napoleonic era uniforms, and hold grand balls that were popular in that period. Other sectors display similar erratic behaviour, with the English troops ‚Äì known as \\"Lime- ees\\" ‚Äì dressing as holiday camp redcoats and behaving as though they are on a perpetual holiday, while the \\"Rom\\" garrison fashion themselves as 1950's Teddy Boys - or \\"Romeos\\". Rogue is immune to all known toxins, diseases, and acids with three known exceptions: * A new plant is discovered after permafrost is melted in an arctic zone, which renders him unconscious.Prog 242 * In the flashback story \\"Cinnabar\\" a retrovirus is engineered specifically to target his immune system, making him susceptible to all other Nu-Earth hazards, ultimately forcing him to wear a chem-suit. * On Horst, Rogue is bitten by one of the Dragoid creatures causing him to pass out. As Bagman points out, Rogue was engineered to be resistant to conditions on Nu Earth, not those unique to Horst. However, the toxin quickly wears off, and in fact has a beneficial effect on Rogue. In a lighter moment during the Fort Neuro series, Rogue is shown to have difficulty breathing when in a staff car full of officers from the \\"Rom\\" sector, who in anticipation of a good night out with the neighbouring \\"Scan\\" sector, have applied too much aftershave.Prog 300 The Biochips are infected by a latent malady unknowingly contracted whilst passing through the Neverglades area of Nu Earth. The unnamed condition renders them susceptible to \\"Enzyme E disfunction\\", which causes their newly re-gened bodies to disintegrate, leaving only their bio-chips. Norts Nort insignia Norts are a fictional fascist enemy with Slavic and German-like overtones. They are fighting the Southers. They were mainly responsible for the Quartz Massacre. The Traitor General was briefly allied with them. =History= In a war which broke out on Earth, it is presumed that Germany and Russia formed a large empire stretching from Asia to Central Europe and ended the war by entering into an unstable alliance with the Southers. The ruling political party of the Norts, the Nordland Party, urged their armies to colonise the various planets deep in Souther space, including Nu-Earth. The early Nort colonists lived in the desert and tamed its wild animals. Years later, when it was discovered that the black hole near the planet led to other parts of the Galaxy, the Norts declared war and launched a preemptive attack on Fort Neuropa, starting the \\"Nu-Earth Future war\\". By the time of Rogue Trooper, the atmosphere of Nu-Earth is heavily poisoned by war gases and cannot be breathed except by the Rogue Trooper; all others in the open must wear chemsuits. In the separate 'Friday' continuity, the Norts started off as a trading company and rival to its sister company, the Southers (both owned by the Clavel Corporation, a megacorporation). When their parent company started a war between Humanity in an effort to avoid stagnation, they pitted the two corporations against one another. After several years (during which time, they started the Eugenics Project), they recalled all high-ranking officers back to their corporate HQ. The sole surviving member of the program, Friday, sneaked on board a rocket bound for their corporate HQ and successfully assassinated Mr. Clavel, the founder and CEO of Clavel Corporation and destroying the company AI, Highside. In the process, he re-ignited the war between the two trading companies.  Realpolitik storyline  In the \\"Realpolitik\\" storyline, War Marshal Zell travels to Nu-Earth after hearing of his son's death. He releases Kapitan Arkhan from prison with the intention of capturing and killing his son's killer, the Rogue Trooper. When Arkhan fails the mission, Zell orders Nu-Earth to be captured and sends all available troops there. Eventually, Zell's Inner Circle begin to plot against him, believing he has gone mad due to his son's death. They capture Rogue Trooper and order him to assassinate Zell. Arkhan discovers the plot and executes the chief plotters. Meanwhile, Rogue's contact in the base (who is a Double agent) betrays him, resulting in her death. Arkhan then contacts Rogue and orders him to continue the mission. After Rogue successfully finishes the mission, he is captured, but is soon released by Arkhan after Arkhan is promoted to War Marshal. Before the newly promoted marshal leaves Nu-Earth, he orders the remnants of the plotters to be executed. =Military= Their armed forces include:  Armed forces  Nort troopers of the Kashan Legion, from a Rogue Trooper comic book The Nort military have formed many units and war machines at their disposal including: * Base Commanders * Chem-sisters * Dust Devils * EMP troops * Infantry * Kashan Legions (Nordland's Elite) * Kashar Legions (Nort warriors) * Lazooka troops * Mortar troops * Nagan Legions (Penal troops) * Navy Sergeant * Undercover Poison-Pollution Agents, known to the Southers as Filth Columnists * Sailors * Scum Legions (Formed by Admiral Torpitz and disbanded after the Fort Neuropa Campaign) * Scum Marines (Named after the Scum Sea) * Sergeants * Shotgun troops * Snipers * Space pirates * Sun Legions (Hang glider troops) * Stammel Riders * Vroogmen (Divers) * Snow troopers * Various Genetic Experiments  War machines  * Amoks (large robots) * Bio-wire * Blackmares (Giant tanks) * Decapitators * Dream Weavers (Horrific illusions) * Drill Probes * Foils (carrying missiles) * Hell Cannon * Hellstreaks * Attack Hoppas * Deploy Hoppas * Hov-Peds * Lamprey Assault Ship * Missile Bomber * Naval Atmocrafts * Nort Heavy Support Armour * Nort Tactical Armour * Patrol Boats * Pillboxes * Porcupines (Particle-Accelerated Armour-Piercing Sabot Micro-Rounds) * Ro-Rats (On Horst Only) * Scoutships * Seed Ships (carrying Decapitators) * Submarines * Tailgunner Joes (fire and forget munitions)  Allies  On Horst the Norts had numerous allies: * Drom * Winged bats * Amphibious crabs * Rhino Subspecies  Other  * The Bioware Units * Ghouls (Deserters from both sides who live on what salvage they find) * Medics * Military Intelligence * Military police * The pay-corps * scientists * Stammels, descendants of Earth Camels which can breathe the chemically contaminated air of Nu-Earth, ridden by Nort Desert raiders. * The Office of the Public Truth- A unit that hunts war criminals, as featured in the Jaegir spinoff comic series. * The Office of Genetic Purity- Another internal security unit with a particular focus on hunting those Nort soldiers infected by the Strigoi Curse. Again featured in Jaegir.  Equipment  Their usual chemsuit has a soft hood, often with a low blunt-pointed top, hiding the wearer's face completely except small round or oblong eye-holes, and two large backpack air or oxygen cylinders. Two wide breathing tubes run, one from the top of each cylinder over the shoulders and run into the hood beside his mouth and nose. The design was likely inspired by the old-type open-circuit aqualung. In some episodes this set has an extra smaller cylinder on the back of the two main cylinders, likely imitated from U.S.Army flamethrowers. In at least one comic issue,Rogue Trooper comic, issue 49, publ by Fleetway, ISSN 1044-5609 one page (page 7) shows Nort chemsuit breathing sets drawn with the breathing tubes coming from an (undersized) demand valve midway between the tops of the cylinders; but many other Nort breathing sets in that issue show the usual design, and in a few frames a version with one cylinder. =Norts= Norts include: * General Doenz - The Supreme Commander * War Marshal Zell (Killed and replaced by Arkhan) * The Grand Marshal (on Horst) * Admiral Torpitz - Naval Commander * General Vagner - Army Commander * Morgen - Ex-Nort sniper for the \\"Marauders\\" * Commandant Marvin - Sun Legion Commander * Marshal Mooler - Scum Marine Commander * War Marshal Arkhan - High-ranking Nort Commander * Mr. Brass of Bland & Brass bodylooters. * Sister Sledge - Filth Columnist who worked in Nu-Atlanta and nearly captured Rogue during the Norts' DIX-I offensive. =Norts: Miscellaneous= * The Norts were inspired by the Northerner Unionists from the American Civil War and the Nazis from World War II. * The Norts' protective suits (showing only the eyes) reinforce the \\"Bad Guy\\" delineation. * They often say \\"Stak!\\" when either surprised or dismayed. * They often say \\"Nain\\", as a substitute for the word \\"No\\", this sounds and looks similar to the German spelling of the word \\"Nein\\". * The Nort lightning-bolt insignia bears some similarity to the insignia of the British Union of Fascists under Oswald Mosley. Southers Souther insignia Southers are the \\"good guys\\" fighting the Norts in Rogue Trooper. Their country is called the Souther Confederacy. They receive orders from Milli-com, their military command complex. It was Souther army scientists who developed the G.I.s in an attempt to produce a soldier more suited to the toxic conditions on Nu-Earth. =History= After an unnamed war ended on Earth, the remnants of America and Britain quickly took control of the Americas, Western Europe and parts of Africa to create a new country and proceeded to promote peace and stability on Earth. They then proceeded to colonise other planets, forming the \\"Souther Confederacy\\" and when Nu-Earth was discovered, they built Fort Neuropa as a base of operations. When it was discovered that the black hole near the planet led to other parts of the Galaxy, tensions mounted between both sides. Eventually, the Norts attacked Fort Neuropa so the Southers were forced to retaliate. By the time of Rogue Trooper, Souther Gene-Scientists had created the G.I. Project in a desperate struggle to win the Nu-Earth Future War. In the separate 'Friday' continuity, the Southers started off as a trading company and rival to its sister company, the Norts (both owned by the Clavel Corporation, a Mega Corp). When their parent company started a war between Humanity in an effort to avoid stagnation, they pitted the two corporations against one another. After several years (during which time, they started the Eugenics Project), they recalled all high-ranking officers back to their corporate HQ. When the sole surviving member of their eugenics program, Friday, sneaked on board a rocket bound for their corporate HQ and successfully assassinated Mr. Clavel, the founder and CEO of Clavel Corporation and destroying the company AI, Highside, in the process, he re-ignited the war between the two trading companies. Fort Neuropa Fort Neuropa was a Souther fort in the \\"Fort Neuro\\" story in the Rogue Trooper stories. Completely isolated since the beginning of the war, its garrison developed bizarre customs (as a result of watching old historical movies and neglecting their Robe-Runners) resulting in its inhabitants aping the manners and clothes of various European nations and groups from centuries earlier. When Rogue Trooper arrived at \\"Fort Neuropa\\", he discovered that everyone was suffering \\"Siege Mentality\\". After losing Bagman, Helm and Gunnar to the \\"Fort Neuropans\\", he discovered a plot by the Norts to capture the fort by playing on these neuroses. After foiling an assassination attempt on his life, he recruited the Robe-Runners to help him foil the invasion. Afterwards the neuroses cleared and the garrison were all back to being ordinary Southers. Rogue had to rescue each sector of the fort separately: * Frank sector: Here the garrison had developed a Napoleonic- period French mentality and were trying to talk in French (spelt phonetically, e.g. \\"Kee valla?\\" for \\"Qui va l√†?\\" = \\"Who goes there?\\"). A Nort had played on this by impersonating Napoleon Bonaparte. Rogue, with help from the Robe- Runners stopped this invasion while Gunnar killed the fake emperor. * Lim-Ee sector (Camp Reveille): Here the garrison had developed a holiday camp format. Their self-styled elite, who had taken on a personality similar to stereotypical English hunt parties, quickly wiped out the Norts. * Rom Sector: Here the garrison had developed a disco format hence \\"Rom\\" meant Romeo. Norts were using Dreamweavers and their own women. * Scan Sector: Here \\"Scan\\" stood for \\"Scandinavian\\". The Scan sector was predominantly garrisoned by women, mostly falling into the blonde bombshell stereotype. As a result, they had close links with the Rom sector, and the two garrisons defended their sectors together. Admiral Torpitz then used his Scum Legions to attack all four sectors at once, bringing in their \\"Amoks\\". All the sectors attacked the Nort forces destroying all the Amoks and killing the majority of the Norts which resulted in the rest of the Norts surrendering. During the battle, the resulting explosions and force-fields make a break in the chem-clouds which resulted in sunlight reaching the ground and as a result, the garrison lose their format obsessions. Before Rogue leaves, the Fort Neuropans reward the Robe-Runners with a new redesign and vow to protect Fort Neuropa from the Norts. As a result, the Nort commander in charge, General Vagner went insane from the shock of defeat. =Realpolitik= Shortly afterwards, Fort Neuropa was destroyed. Its remnants reverted to the World War II era with the leaders modelling themselves after Winston Churchill, Josef Stalin, and Harry S. Truman. =Military= Their armed forces include:- Armed forces The Souther military have at their disposal: * 86th Air Support Reconnaissance Squadron * Chem-sisters * GIs * S3 Agents * Troops War machines * Attack Hoppers * Carter Class tanks * Deploy Hoppers * Drop pods * Hover trains * Landing Crafts * Robe-Runners * Space-Attack Crafts * Stomper Rigs * Submarines * The War Golems (Scrapped after initial tests failed) Allies Numerous allies have included: * Anthropomorphic creatures * Insectoids * Reptilian Dragoids Other * The Bioware Units * medics * Military Intelligence * Military police * The pay-corps * scientists * Vid- Vultures (Remote controlled war correspondents) Equipment Their usual chemsuit has a hard helmet, often with a big anti-gas filter like in gasmasks but bigger, on the front of the chest, connected by a wide breathing tube to the bottom of the helmet faceplate. All the wearer's face can be seen from outside. =Famous Southers= Notable Southers that appeared in the Rogue Trooper fictional universe include: * The Traitor General - The Souther responsible for the destruction of the G.I.s * Star Marshal Lamal - Supreme Commander * Colonel Kovert - Military Intelligence * Doctor Friedkin - Physician * Colonel Logan - Commander in charge (G.I.s) * Mr. Bland of Bland & Brass bodylooters. * Various G.I.s have included: ** Rogue ** Friday ** Tor Cyan ** Venus Bluegenes ** Azure ** Major Magnam - A GI Officer whose bio-chip was found in a weapons auction implanted into a GI Officer's side arm. ** Rafaelle Blue =Southers: Miscellaneous= * The Southers were inspired by the Southern Confederates from the American Civil War (including the rebel yell of \\"South Side, yeah!\\") and the Allies from World War II. * Their protective suits (showing their faces) reinforce the \\"Good Guy\\" delineation. * Female G.I.s are known as G.I. Dolls Historical influences Many elements of the Rogue back-story were inspired by World War II, the American Civil War and the Cold War. Norts (Northerner Unionists) fought against generally less- well equipped Southers (Southern Confederates), and several battles were referenced, such as the First Battle of Bull Run, which was retold as the Battle of Mek-Bull Run. The Norts appear totalitarian in nature. While their uniforms have Nazi connotations their dialect and names are mostly quasi- Slavic, as if they represented a futuristic version of the Soviet Bloc, although there is some usage of German names as well, for example General Vagner, Admiral Torpitz. Their conduct and methods of waging war are also more barbaric than those of the comparatively civilised Southers. Although as the series develops the Southers are also shown committing comparably immoral acts as well. \\"Genetic Infantryman\\" is a direct homage to the supposed \\"Government Issue\\" tag that American troops were nicknamed after.

Spin-offs and reboots =The 86ers= The 86ers was created by writer Gordon Rennie and drawn by artists Karl Richardson and PJ Holden. The story stars G.I. pilot Rafella \\"Rafe\\" Blue and her robot Gabe. =Venus Bluegenes= Venus Bluegenes appeared both in Rogue Trooper and in her own eponymous strip, with stories written by authors including Grant Morrison, Steve White and Dan Abnett. =Tor Cyan= Tor Cyan appeared both in Mercy Heights and in his own eponymous strip, in a series written by John Tomlinson. =Jaegir= Jaegir is a recurring series in 2000 AD, focusing on Kapitan-Inspector Atalia Jaegir, who serves in the Nordland State Security Police. Her role is to hunt down escaped war criminals. =Hunted= Gordon Rennie and artist PJ Holden produced Hunted, a nine-part story told from the point of view of the Traitor General, in 2016. It began in 2000AD progs 2001 to 2009. It features a young Atalia Jaegir and a monstrous early specimen of the G.I. project. =IDW Publishing reboot= IDW Publishing's Rogue Trooper #1. On 20 July 2013, American company IDW Publishing announced that after the success of its adaptation of Judge Dredd from 2000 AD it would now champion Rogue Trooper with recoloured old issues as well as completely new stories. \\"Following the success of Judge Dredd, IDW and Rebellion/2000 AD expand their thriving relationship with the addition of Rogue Trooper to their publishing slate! IDW will launch an all-new Rogue Trooper series in 2014, and also offer newly colored re-presentations of past Rogue Trooper comics, too.\\" On 13 November 2013 it was announced that the new series would be written by British fantasy writer Brian Ruckley and drawn by Alberto Ponticelli. Brian Ruckley acquired the position \\"by writing a pitch document that people apparently liked.\\" He described his first challenge as scriptwriter as \\"I can now say from personal experience that writing comics is not straightforward or effortless!\\" The new Rogue Trooper features a re-designed helmet, rifle and backpack which serve as the three main supporting characters in the stories. The first episode was originally set to ship at the end of February 2014, but the first issue was actually released on 5 March 2014. Due to lower-than-expected sales, the decision was made to put the series \\"on hold\\". The final issue of the new Rogue Trooper series was issue 4, published on 21 May 2014. All four issues were collected as a trade paperback and released on 17 September 2014 under the title Rogue Trooper: Last Man Standing. IDW also published Rogue Trooper Classics, a series of recoloured stories from 2000 AD, in order. It was originally intended to consist of 12 issues (with issue 1 being published on 14 May 2014), but like the new Rogue title, it was cut short, with only 8 issues to be produced in total ‚Äì again, a result of lower-than-expected sales. Other media A range of Rogue Trooper material has been produced: =Novels= There are three novels based on Rogue Trooper: * Crucible (Gordon Rennie, October 2004 ) * Blood Relative (James Swallow, March 2005 ) * The Quartz Massacre (Rebecca Levene, March 2006 ) =Boardgames= The Rogue Trooper Boardgame was released in 1987 by Games Workshop. =Video games= A number of Rogue Trooper computer games have been released in 1986 and 1990. An isometric shooter by Piranha Software for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum was released in 1986. The game consists of killing Norts while searching Nu-Earth for 8 vid-tapes containing evidence of the Traitor General's involvement in the Quartz Zone Massacre, where all of the G.I.s except Rogue were slaughtered. On finding all 8 tapes, Rogue has to return to the Souther base of Milli-Com to prove the General's treachery and the extenuating circumstances of his going AWOL. During the game, as well as the vid-tapes, players could also pick up medi-kits to regain health and ammo boxes to feed Gunnar. A platform game incorporating first-person vehicle levels for the Amiga and Atari ST by Krisalis Software came out in 1990. After Rebellion bought 2000 AD they released a Rogue Trooper video game in 2006, with a Wii version out in 2009. In 2009 Rogue Trooper featured a guest role in the game \\"LittleBigPlanet\\" for PS3. It came in the form of content which could be bought in the PlayStation Store. In 2017 Rogue Trooper Redux was released to the current generation PC, PS4, XB1 and Nintendo Switch, developed by Rebellion and TickTock Games.2000 AD #2050, 27 September 2017 =Film= Grant Morrison has said he will be writing a Rogue Trooper screenplay for Sam Worthington's production company Full Clip Production. On 16 July 2018, Duncan Jones revealed that he will direct the movie, without Full Clip Production. In 2018, a not for profit short fan film directed by Adam Kirley, produced by Joby Stephens and starring stuntman Damien Walters is being released. The short will premiere at the International London Sci Fi film festival. In November 2018, Rebellion Developments announced they were setting up a studio for Film and TV series based on 2000 AD characters with Rogue Trooper as one of their projects.

The pilot sets the pressure altitude and air temperature in the top window using the knob; the needle indicates true airspeed in the lower left window. Here the speed is displayed both in knots (kn) and miles per hour (mph). The true airspeed (TAS; also KTAS, for knots true airspeed) of an aircraft is the speed of the aircraft relative to the air mass through which it is flying. The true airspeed is important information for accurate navigation of an aircraft. Traditionally it is measured using an analogue TAS indicator, but as the Global Positioning System has become available for civilian use, the importance of such analogue instruments has decreased. Since indicated airspeed is a better indicator of power used and lift available, True airspeed is not used for controlling the aircraft during taxiing, takeoff, climb, descent, approach or landing; for these purposes the Indicated airspeed - IAS or KIAS (knots indicated airspeed) - is used. However, since indicated airspeed only shows true speed through the air at standard sea level pressure and temperature, a TAS meter is necessary for navigation purposes at cruising altitude in less dense air. The IAS meter reads very nearly the TAS at lower altitude and at lower speed. On jet airliners the TAS meter is usually hidden at speeds below . Neither provides for accurate speed over the ground, since surface winds or winds aloft are not taken into account. Performance TAS is the true measure of aircraft performance in cruise, thus it is the speed listed in aircraft specifications, manuals, performance comparisons, pilot reports, and every situation when cruise or endurance performance needs to be measured. It is the speed normally listed on the flight plan, also used in flight planning, before considering the effects of wind. Airspeed sensing errors The airspeed indicator (ASI), driven by ram air into a Pitot tube and still air into a barometric static port, shows what is called indicated airspeed (IAS). The differential pressure is affected by air density. The ratio between the two measurements is temperature-dependent and pressure- dependent, according to the ideal gas law. At sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) and at low speeds where air compressibility is negligible (i.e., assuming a constant air density), IAS corresponds to TAS. When the air density or temperature around the aircraft differs from standard sea level conditions, IAS will no longer correspond to TAS, thus it will no longer reflect aircraft performance. The ASI will indicate less than TAS when the air density decreases due to a change in altitude or air temperature. For this reason, TAS cannot be measured directly. In flight, it can be calculated either by using an E6B flight calculator or its equivalent. For low speeds, the data required are static air temperature, pressure altitude and IAS (or CAS for more precision). Above approximately , the compressibility error rises significantly and TAS must be calculated by the Mach speed. Mach incorporates the above data including the compressibility factor. Modern aircraft instrumentation use an Air Data Computer to perform this calculation in real time and display the TAS reading directly on the Electronic flight instrument system. Since temperature variations are of a smaller influence, the ASI error can be roughly estimated as indicating about 2% less than TAS per of altitude above sea level. For example, an aircraft flying at in the international standard atmosphere with an IAS of , is actually flying at TAS. Use in navigation calculations To maintain a desired ground track while flying in the moving airmass, the pilot of an aircraft must use knowledge of wind speed, wind direction, and true air speed to determine the required heading. See also wind triangle. Calculating true airspeed =Low-speed flight= At low speeds and altitudes, IAS and CAS are close to equivalent airspeed (EAS). TAS can be calculated as a function of EAS and air density:Clancy, L. J., Aerodynamics, Section 3.8. \\\\mathrm{TAS} = \\\\mathrm{EAS}\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\rho_0}{\\\\rho}}, where :\\\\mathrm{TAS} is true airspeed, :\\\\mathrm{EAS} is equivalent airspeed, :\\\\rho_0 is the air density at sea level in the International Standard Atmosphere (15 ¬∞C and 1013.25 hectopascals, corresponding to a density of 1.225 kg/m3), :\\\\rho is the density of the air in which the aircraft is flying. =High-speed flight= TAS can be calculated as a function of Mach number and static air temperature: \\\\mathrm{TAS} ={a_0} M\\\\sqrt{T\\\\over T_0}, where :{a_0} is the speed of sound at standard sea level (), :M is Mach number, :T is static air temperature in kelvins, :T_0 is the temperature at standard sea level (288.15 K). For manual calculation of TAS in knots, where Mach number and static air temperature are known, the expression may be simplified to \\\\mathrm{TAS} = 39M\\\\sqrt{T} (remembering temperature is in kelvins). Combining the above with the expression for Mach number gives an expression for TAS as a function of impact pressure, static pressure and static air temperature (valid for subsonic flow): \\\\mathrm{TAS} = a_0\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{5T}{T_0}\\\\left[\\\\left(\\\\frac{q_c}{P} + 1\\\\right)^\\\\frac{2}{7} - 1\\\\right]}, where: :q_c is impact pressure, :P is static pressure. Electronic flight instrument systems (EFIS) contain an air data computer with inputs of impact pressure, static pressure and total air temperature. In order to compute TAS, the air data computer must convert total air temperature to static air temperature. This is also a function of Mach number: T = \\\\frac{T_\\\\text{t}}{1 + 0.2M^2}, where :T_\\\\text{t} = total air temperature. In simple aircraft, without an air data computer or Machmeter, true airspeed can be calculated as a function of calibrated airspeed and local air density (or static air temperature and pressure altitude, which determine density). Some airspeed indicators incorporate a slide rule mechanism to perform this calculation. Otherwise, it can be performed using this applet or a device such as the E6B (a handheld circular slide rule).

Accordingly, Greek-Americans and Greek-Canadians sometimes call it \\"Easter soup\\", \\"Easter Sunday soup\\", or \\"Easter lamb soup\\". In some parts of Greece, most notably Thessaly, it is not served as soup but rather as a fricassee, where it contains only offal and large variety of vegetables, but no onions or rice, as in the soup. Traditional use Magiritsa is eaten to break the fast of the Greek Orthodox Great Lent, the 40 days before Easter. Its role and ingredients result from its association with the roasted lamb traditionally served at the Paschal meal; in its traditional form, magiritsa consists of the offal removed from the lamb before roasting, flavored with seasonings and sauces. Prepared on Holy Saturday along with the next day's lamb, magiritsa is consumed immediately after the midnight Divine Liturgy. Ingredients and preparation While traditional magiritsa includes all the lamb offal available, it is the head and neck of the lamb which provide most of the soup's flavor, and those parts, along with the intestines, heart, and liver, are most commonly used today. After a thorough cleaning, the lamb parts are boiled whole in water for between thirty minutes and two hours, then cut up into smaller pieces, flavored with onions, dill, butter and sometimes vegetables, and left to simmer. Rice is added towards the end of the boiling process, and the stock is thickened with avgolemono. When consumed in the early hours of the Paschal morning after church, magiritsa is sometimes accompanied by salad and cheese, tsoureki sweet bread, and hard-boiled eggs dyed red as a symbol of the risen Christ's blood.

The object that the metaobject pertains to is called the base object. Some information that a metaobject might define includes the base object's type, interface, class, methods, attributes, parse tree, etc. Metaobjects are examples of the computer science concept of reflection, where a system has access (usually at run time) to its own internal structure. Reflection enables a system to essentially rewrite itself on the fly, to alter its own implementation as it executes.  Metaobject protocol  A metaobject protocol (MOP) provides the vocabulary (protocol) to access and manipulate the structure and behaviour of systems of objects. Typical functions of a metaobject protocol include: *Create or delete a new class *Create a new property or method *Cause a class to inherit from a different class (\\"change the class structure\\") *Generate or change the code defining the methods of a class Metaobject protocol is contrary to Bertrand Meyer's open/closed principle, which holds that software object systems should be open for extension but closed for modification. This principle effectively draws a distinction between extending an object by adding to it, and modifying an object by redefining it, proposing that the former is a desirable quality (\\"objects should be extensible to meet the requirements of future use cases\\"), while the latter is undesirable (\\"objects should provide a stable interface not subject to summary revision\\"). Metaobject protocol, by contrast, transparently exposes the internal composition of objects and the entire object system in terms of the system itself. In practice, this means that programmers may use objects to redefine themselves, possibly in quite complex ways. Furthermore, metaobject protocol is not merely an interface to an \\"underlying\\" implementation; rather, through metaobject protocol the object system is recursively implemented in terms of a meta-object system, which itself is theoretically implemented in terms of a meta-metaobject system, and so on until an arbitrary base case (a consistent state of the object system) is determined, with the protocol as such being the recursive functional relationship between these implementation levels. Implementing object systems in such a way opens the possibility for radical discretionary redesign, providing deep flexibility but introducing possibly complex or difficult-to- understand metastability issues (for instance, the object system must not destructively update its own metaobject protocol - its internal self- representation - but the potential destructiveness of some updates is non- trivial to predict and may be hard to reason about), depending on the recursive depth to which the desired modifications are propagated.The Art of the Metaobject Protocol, Appendix C ‚Äî Living with Circularity For this reason, metaobject protocol, when present in a language, is usually used sparingly and for specialised purposes such as software that transforms other software or itself in sophisticated ways, for example in reverse engineering. = Runtime and compile time = When compilation is not available at run-time there are additional complications for the implementation of metaobject protocol. For example, it is possible to change the type hierarchy with such a protocol but doing so may cause problems for code compiled with an alternative class model definition. Some environments have found innovative solutions for this, e.g., by handling metaobject issues at compile time. A good example of this is OpenC++. The Semantic Web object-oriented model is more dynamic than most standard object systems, and is consistent with runtime metaobject protocols. For example, in the Semantic Web model classes are expected to change their relations to each other and there is a special inference engine known as a classifier that can validate and analyze evolving class models. = Usage = The first metaobject protocol was in the Smalltalk object-oriented programming language developed at Xerox PARC. The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) came later and was influenced by the Smalltalk protocol as well as by Brian C. Smith's original studies on 3-Lisp as an infinite tower of evaluators. The CLOS model, unlike the Smalltalk model, allows a class to have more than one superclass; this raises additional complexity in issues such as resolving the lineage of the class hierarchy on some object instance. CLOS also allows for dynamic multimethod dispatch, which is handled via generic functions rather than message passing like in Smalltalk's single dispatch. The most influential book describing the semantics and implementation of the metaobject protocol in Common Lisp is The Art of the Metaobject Protocol by Gregor Kiczales et al. Metaobject protocols are also extensively used in software engineering applications. In virtually all commercial CASE, re-engineering, and Integrated Development Environments there is some form of metaobject protocol to represent and manipulate the design artifacts. A metaobject protocol is one way to implement aspect-oriented programming. Many of the early founders of MOPs, including Gregor Kiczales, have since moved on to be the primary advocates for aspect-oriented programming. Kiczales et al. of PARC were hired to design AspectJ for Java, a language which does not possess a native metaobject protocol.

Drawing by Antoine Morel-Fatio. British and Danish ships in line of battle at the Battle of Copenhagen (1801) In naval warfare, the line of battle is a tactic in which a naval fleet of ships forms a line end to end. Its first use is disputed, variously claimed for dates ranging from 1502 to 1652, with line-of-battle tactics in widespread use by 1675. Compared with prior naval tactics, in which two opposing ships closed on one another for individual combat, the line of battle has the advantage that each ship in the line can fire its broadside without fear of hitting a friendly ship. Therefore, in a given period, the fleet can fire more shots. Another advantage is that a relative movement of the line in relation to some part of the enemy fleet allows for a systematic concentration of fire on that part. The other fleet can avoid this by maneuvering in a line itself, with a result typical for sea battle since 1675: two fleets sail alongside one another or on the opposite tack. A ship powerful enough to stand in the line of battle came to be called a ship of the line (of battle) or line of battle ship, which was shortened to become the word battleship.\\"battleship\\" The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. 1989. OED Online. Oxford University Press. 4 April 2000. Development A contemporary depiction of the Battle of √ñland between an allied Danish-Dutch fleet under Cornelis Tromp and the Swedish navy. The Swedish ships are arranged in a battle line in the early stages, but they quickly become disorganized and suffer a humiliating defeat. Copper engraving by Romeyn de Hooghe, 1676. The first recorded mention of the use of a line of battle tactic is attested from 1500. The Instructions provided in 1500 by King Manuel I of Portugal to the commander of a fleet dispatched to the Indian Ocean suggests its use predated the written instructions. Portuguese fleets overseas deployed in line ahead, firing one broadside and then putting about in order to return and discharge the other, resolving battles by gunnery alone. In a treatise of 1555, The Art of War at Sea, Portuguese theorist on naval warfare and shipbuilding, Fern√£o de Oliveira, recognized that at sea, the Portuguese \\"fight at a distance, as if from walls and fortresses...\\". He recommended the single line ahead as the ideal combat formation. The Cambridge Illustrated History of Warfare: The Triumph of the West - Geoffrey Parker, pp. 125-130, Cambridge University Press, 1995. A line-of-battle tactic had been used by the Fourth Portuguese India Armada in the Battle of Calicut, under Vasco da Gama in 1502, near Malabar against a Muslim fleet.Geoffrey Parker, The Military Revolution, p. 94. One of the earliest recorded deliberate use is also documented in the First Battle of Cannanore between the Third Portuguese India Armada under Jo√£o da Nova and the naval forces of Calicut, earlier in the same year.Marinha.pt, 2009, site Cananor - 31 de Dezembro de 1501 a 2 de Janeiro de 1502 . Another early, but different form of this strategy, was used in 1507 by Afonso de Albuquerque at the entrance to the Persian Gulf, in the first conquest of Ormuz. Albuquerque commanded a fleet of six carracks manned by 460 men, and entered Ormuz Bay, being surrounded by 250 warships and a 20,000 men army on land. Albuquerque made his small fleet (but powerful in its artillery) circle like a carrousel, but in a line end-to-end, and destroyed most of the ships that surrounded his squad. He then proceeded to capture Ormuz. While it is well documented that Maarten Tromp first used it in the Action of 18 September 1639,Prud‚Äôhomme van Reine, R. Schittering en Schandaal. Dubbelbiografie van Maerten en Cornelis Tromp', 2001, p. 417. some have disputed this. One of the first precise written instructions in any language adopting the formation were contained in the English Navy's Fighting Instructions, written by Admiral Robert Blake and published in 1653.Fighting Instructions, 1530-1816 Sir Julian Stafford Corbett, Publications of The Navy Records Society Vol. XXIX. Individual captains on both sides of the First Anglo-Dutch War appear to have experimented with the technique in 1652, possibly including Blake at the Battle of Goodwin Sands. From the mid-16th century the cannon gradually became the most important weapon in naval warfare, replacing boarding actions as the decisive factor in combat. At the same time, the natural tendency in the design of galleons was for longer ships with lower castles, which meant faster, more stable vessels. These newer warships could mount more cannons along the sides of their decks, concentrating their firepower along their broadside. Until the mid-17th century, the tactics of a fleet were often to \\"charge\\" the enemy, firing bow chaser cannon, which did not deploy the broadside to its best effect. These new vessels required new tactics, and \\"since ... almost all the artillery is found upon the sides of a ship of war, hence it is the beam that must necessarily and always be turned toward the enemy. On the other hand, it is necessary that the sight of the latter must never be interrupted by a friendly ship. Only one formation allows the ships of the same fleet to satisfy fully these conditions. That formation is the line ahead [column]. This line, therefore, is imposed as the only order of battle, and consequently as the basis of all fleet tactics.\\"Mahan, A.T., The Influence of Sea Power Upon History 1660‚Äì1783, pp. 115‚Äì116, quoting Chabaud- Arnault The line-of-battle tactic favored very large ships that could sail steadily and maintain their place in the line in the face of heavy fire. The change toward the line of battle also depended on an increased disciplining of society and the demands of powerful centralized government to keep permanent fleets led by a corps of professional officers. These officers were better able to manage and communicate between the ships they commanded than the merchant crews that often comprised large parts of a navy's force. The new type of warfare that developed during the early modern period was marked by a successively stricter organization. Battle formations became standardized, based on mathematically calculated ideal models. The increased power of states at the expense of individual landowners led to increasingly larger armies and navies.Glete (1993), p. 176. Effective use The line of battle was marked by tactical rigidity and often resulted in indecisive engagements. Fleet commanders sometimes met with greater success by altering or abandoning the line of battle outright by breaking the enemy line and moving through it (e.g. Four Days Battle, Battle of Schooneveld, Battle of Trafalgar), by trying to cut off and isolate part of the enemy's line while concentrating a stronger force on it (e.g. Battle of Texel, Battle of the Saintes), or by trying to \\"double up\\" the enemy's ships (e.g. Battle of Beachy Head). Weaknesses The main problem with the line of battle was that when the fleets are of similar size, naval actions using it were generally indecisive. The French in particular were adept at gunnery and would generally take the leeward position to enable their fleet to retire downwind while continuing to fire chain-shot at long range to bring down masts. Eventually so many vessels in a line would be damaged that they would be forced to retire for repairs while the French took few casualties and very little damage themselves. Doubling If the opposing fleets were of similar size, a portion of the line might be overwhelmed by focused gunfire of the entire enemy line by doubling. Ships breaking through the enemy line would act in concert with others remaining on the original side to simultaneously engage both sides of a portion of the enemy fleet while the broadsides of the remainder of the enemy line were unable to engage. Age of steam For a period in the late 19th century, naval tactics became chaotic as ironclad warships were introduced. One school of thought held that ironclads were effectively invulnerable to gunfire, so ramming became a popular method of attack, such as at the Battle of Lissa and the Battle of the Yalu River. Another held that naval battles would only be decided by an assault on an enemy fleet in port. Ships built according to these doctrines tended to mount a handful of guns which could fire ahead or all-round, rather than broadside. The fleets of these periods tended to use the line of battle less. However, as ramming fell out of fashion, the logic of the line of battle returned; used in the Battle of Tsushima of 1905, the Battle of Jutland in 1916 and finally in the Battle of Surigao Strait in 1944. During World War II the development of aircraft carriers meant that gun engagements were no longer decisive. This meant there was no rationale for using a line-of-battle formation. In modern naval warfare, a battlegroup generally deploys with the highest-value units in the centre, accompanied closely by anti-aircraft escorts, with a number of anti-submarine escorts surrounding the formation at a distance of tens of miles.

In 1963 he played a key role in exposing Harold Challenor, a corrupt police officer who tried to frame him. Biography Donald Rooum was born in Bradford. He registered as a conscientious objector but was pressured by his family into doing two years military service, starting January 1947. A resettlement grant following his discharge allowed him to study commercial design at Bradford Regional Art School from 1949 to 1953.Sansom, Philip \\"Introduction\\" in Wildcat Anarchist Comics by Donald Rooum, London, Freedom Press, pp.2‚Äì12. Rooum's 1952 portrait by Frank Lisle, one of his lecturers of the time, is in Wakefield Gallery. From 1954 to 1966 Rooum worked as a layout artist and typographer in London advertising agencies, then as a lecturer in typographic design at the London College of Printing until 1983. He studied life sciences at the Open University from 1973 to 1979, and was awarded a first class degree in 1980. He was elected Member of the Institute of Biology (incorporated into the Society of Biology in October 2009) and became a chartered biologist in 2004. Rooum lived with Irene Brown from 1954 to 1983 and they had four children: Josephine Anne (born 1956), Penelope Jane (born 1958 died 1960), Mathew Donald (born 1960) and Rebecca Jane (born 1962). =Activism= Rooum said that he first became interested in anarchism in 1944 when he visited Speaker's Corner in London while on a Ministry of Food scheme which used schoolboys to pick hops in Kent. He subscribed to War Commentary, thus beginning a connection with Freedom Press which continued for over sixty years. During that time he was a writer for and an editor of Freedom, the name to which War Commentary reverted after the end of the Second World War.Rooum, Donald \\"Freedom, Freedom Press and Freedom Bookshop\\" in Information for Social Change Number 27, Summer 2008, pp.29‚Äì36 ISSN 1364-694X In 1949, Rooum began to raise his profile in activist circles, participating in the annual anarchist summer school. The working title of Frank Lisle's 1952 portrait was The Anarchist.\\"Portrait of Donald Rooum by Frank Lisle\\". Wakefield Council. Accessed August 2013. Rooum became an outdoor speaker Market Street, Bradford, then at Speaker's Corner. He was a founding member of the Malatesta Club, an anarchist social club and venue that opened in London on May Day 1954. Rooum and Irene Brown worked as volunteers there. In the long-running feud between Vernon Richards and Freedom on the one hand, and Albert Meltzer and Black Flag on the other, Rooum sided with Richards. = Thought = As to his theoretical position as an anarchist, Rooum stated: \\"The most influential source is Max Stirner. I am happy to be called a Stirnerite anarchist, provided 'Stirnerite' means one who agrees with Stirner's general drift, not one who agrees with Stirner's every word.\\"Donald Rooum: Anarchism and Selfishness. In: The Raven. Anarchist Quarterly (London), vol. 1, n. 3 (nov. 1987), pp. 251‚Äì259 (here 259) An Anarchist FAQ reports that \\"From meeting anarchists in Glasgow during the Second World War, long-time anarchist activist and artist Donald Rooum likewise combined Stirner and anarcho-communism.\\".\\"G.6. What are the ideas of Max Stirner\\" in An Anarchist FAQ =Role in the Challenor affair= In 1963 Rooum exposed police corruption during demonstrations against the London visit by King Paul of Greece and Queen Frederika. There had been attempts to outlaw the demonstrations and draconian prison sentences were passed on demonstrators. The government was criticized in the press for the severity of the sentences and eventually there were embarrassing climb-downs. Some of the sentences were overturned on appeal and the Home Secretary, Henry Brooke, had to offer financial compensation. Rooum proved that an offensive weapon had been planted on him.Driver, Christopher, The Disarmers: A Study in Protest, London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1964 On 11 July, he had joined a demonstration against the royal party at Claridge's hotel. He held up a banner reading, \\"Lambrakis RIP\\", referring to a Greek MP and peace activist who had been murdered. According to Rooum's account, the banner was confiscated by a police officer and read by four plain clothes men. Rooum asked, \\"Can I have my banner back?\\" He was approached by one of the officers: \\"This big one with the short- back-and-sides stepped forward. 'Can you have your what back?' \\"'My banner.\\" \\"He smiled at me. 'You're fucking nicked, my old beauty,' he said, and gave me a terrific clout on the ear.\\"Rooum, Donald, \\"I've dislodged a bit of brick\\", Anarchy, No.36, Vol.4. No.2, February 1964 At the police station, the officer, Detective Sergeant Harold Challenor, \\"took from his pocket a screwed-up newspaper, which he opened with a flourish. Inside was a piece of brick. His smile widened. 'There you are, my old beauty. Carrying an offensive weapon. You can get two years for that.'\\" Rooum was a member of the National Council of Civil Liberties and he had, by good fortune, read some material on forensic science and so gave his clothes to his defence solicitor Stanley Clinton Davis for analysis. No brick dust was found in his pocket and Rooum convinced the magistrate that therefore no brick could have been there at the time of the alleged offence.Link to article on Challenor, mentioning Rooum's role in exposing him James Morton (1993) Bent Coppers pp.118‚Äì9 There followed a public inquiry that criticised the police and led to the imprisonment of three officers.Parliamentary question by Shirley Summerskill to Home Office ministers Report of Enquiry, by Mr A.E.James, QC, 1965 HMSO, Cmnd 2735 Rooum received ¬£500 compensation (¬£9,655 at 2017 value) and other convictions were overturned. Challenor was deemed mentally unfit to plead and was committed to Netherne mental hospital. A subsequent enquiry found that he had probably been suffering from the onset of paranoid schizophrenia for some months before the incident, but the lack of any successful prosecution against him was seen by some as evidence of further establishment corruption.Parliamentary question to Attorney General re Challenor by Arthur Lewis Cartoonist In 1952, Philip Sansom invited Rooum to draw a regular cartoon strip for The Syndicalist and he contributed Scissor Bill. The name derived from an IWW name for a bosses' yes-man. From 1960, his cartoons started appearing in such outlets as She, The Daily Mirror, Private Eye and The Spectator. Rooum has had a long relationship, with interruptions, with Peace News, his first work appearing for them in 1962. Originals of his cartoons for Peace News up to 1971, together with some for The Spectator, are stored at the British Cartoon Archive. In 1974, Sansom invited Rooum to provide a cartoon for a monthly magazine he was working on, Wildcat. Rooum created a character of the same name. Wildcat ceased publication in 1975 but in 1980, when Sansom was again working on Freedom, he persuaded Rooum and the editorial collective to revive the Wildcat comic strip, which featured in every edition until Freedom ceased printing in 2014. In 2016, PM Press of California published Wildcat Anarchist Comics, a collection of Donald Rooum's cartoons coloured by Jayne Clementson, with some autobiographical material, and What is Anarchism 2nd edition, an expanded version of the Freedom Press What is Anarchism 1992. Rooum has drawn the Sprite strip for The Skeptic magazine since 1987. He has illustrated several books, including Don't you believe it! by John Radford. An exhibition of Rooum's work was held at Conway Hall in 2008. Wildcat, a short film by Adam Louis-Jacob (2018) has an animated, coloured Wildcat walking past some of Rooum's black and white strip cartoons for Freedom, drawing attention to the speech balloons.

Cell proliferation leads to an exponential increase in cell number and is therefore a rapid mechanism of tissue growth. Cell proliferation requires both cell growth and cell division to occur at the same time, such that the average size of cells remains constant in the population. Cell division can occur without cell growth, producing many progressively smaller cells (as in cleavage of the zygote, while cell growth can occur without cell division to produce a single larger cell (as in growth of neurons). Thus, cell proliferation is not synonymous with either cell growth or cell division, despite the fact that these terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Stem cells undergo cell proliferation to produce proliferating \\"transit amplifying\\" daughter cells that later differentiate to construct tissues during normal development and tissue growth, during tissue regeneration after damage, or in cancer. The total number of cells in a population is determined by the rate of cell proliferation minus the rate of cell death. Cell size depends on both cell growth and cell division, with a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell growth leading to production of larger cells and a disproportionate increase in the rate of cell division leading to production of many smaller cells. Cell proliferation typically involves balanced cell growth and cell division rates that maintain a roughly constant cell size in the exponentially proliferating population of cells. Cell proliferation occurs by combining cell growth with regular \\"G1-S-M-G2\\" cell cycles to produce many diploid cell progeny. In single-celled organisms, cell proliferation is largely responsive to the availability of nutrients in the environment (or laboratory growth medium). In multicellular organisms, the process of cell proliferation is tightly controlled by gene regulatory networks encoded in the genome and executed mainly by transcription factors including those regulated by signal transduction pathways elicited by growth factors during cell-cell communication in development. In addition, intake of nutrients in animals can induce circulating hormones of the Insulin/IGF-1 family, which are also considered growth factors, and that function to promote cell proliferation in cells throughout the body that are capable of doing so. Uncontrolled cell proliferation, leading to an increased proliferation rate, or a failure of cells to arrest their proliferation at the normal time, is a cause of cancer.

It was intended to serve students in east Texas, where the majority of the black population lived at the time. In 1961 the administration moved the college into Dallas, Texas. In 2006 the president of Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky reached out to Bishop College alumni, proposing to have them \\"adopt\\" his college as an alma mater. He offered scholarships to their descendants, with a chance to have their diploma read \\"Bishop College\\". This was part of an effort to increase minority enrollment at Georgetown. History 1850 plot plan of Bishop College (Wyalucing) The college was founded by the Baptist Home Mission Society in 1881 as the result of a movement to build a college for African- American Baptists. Nathan Bishop, who had been the superintendent of several major school systems in New England, started this effort. Baylor University President Rufus C. Burleson secured a pledge of $25,000 from Judge Bishop to start the college during a meeting of the National Baptist Education Society meeting in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A committee of Baptist ministers from East Texas, where most African Americans then lived, selected a location in Marshall, on land belonging to the Holcomb Plantation, Wyalucing. \\"Wyalucing, Bishop & West Bush Streets, Marshall, Harrison County, TX,\\" Historic American Buildings Survey, Library of Congress, retrieved 22 January 2013 For the college's first several decades, Bishop's faculty and administration were staffed largely by European Americans. The first African American appointed as president was Joseph J. Rhoads, who started in 1929 and served through the Great Depression and World War II.Bishop College: Texas school continues historic push for academic excellence, Ebony, May 1981 During his presidency, Bishop phased out the high school preparatory programs associated with the college, which had operated to help students compensate for failures in public education. He emphasized the college's new two-year ministerial program. During the 1930s and 1940s, the ministerial program was developed as the Lacy Kirk Williams Institute. It moved to Dallas when the college moved in 1961. The Lacy Kirk Williams Institute evolved into a week-long seminar which attracted well-known preachers including Jessie Jackson and Martin Luther King, Sr. in 1975. (source, Lloyd Thompson's dissertation for North Texas University, p 34-35) In 1961, after receiving a grant from the Hoblitzelle Foundation, Bishop moved to a campus in Dallas. It was able to attract more students there. In Dallas, enrollments increased, peaking at almost 2,000 students around 1970. The college closed in 1988 after a financial scandal led to the revocation of its accreditation, and its eligibility to receive funds from charities such as the United Negro College Fund. Purchased in 1990 by Comer S. Cottrell, the campus is now used by Paul Quinn College. In 2006, the president of Georgetown College in Georgetown, Kentucky proposed a plan to Bishop College alumni to make Georgetown their adopted alma mater. Georgetown offers scholarships to children or grandchildren of Bishop alumni or students nominated by Bishop alumni. Upon graduation, these students receive diplomas with the name and insignia of Bishop College. Georgetown president William H. Crouch Jr. hopes the program will help the college reach its goal of increasing minority enrollment to 25% by 2012. Notable alumni Dr. Manuel L.

History TES, formerly known as The Eulenspiegel Society, is the first BDSM organization founded in the United States. It was founded in 1971 in New York City by Pat Bond (he was a music teacher) and Fran Nowve, as an informal association and support group for masochists; sadists joined shortly after in that same year. Bond placed an ad in Screw magazine in December 1970, reading: ‚ÄúMasochist? Happy? Is it curable? Does psychiatry help? Is a satisfactory life-style possible? There‚Äôs women‚Äôs lib, black lib, gay lib, etc. Isn‚Äôt it time we put something together?‚Äù The ad also ran in the East Village Other. Fran Nowve, using the name Terry Kolb, was the first person to answer the ad. She and Bond began The Eulenspiegel Society in 1971, and Nowve came up with its name. In August 1971, The Eulenspiegel Society's members voted to include sadists in the organization. The Eulenspiegel Society originally met in members' homes, and then met in rented space in theaters and churches. The organization was an active part of the 1970s sexual revolution, as well as LGBT activism, including marching in New York City Pride Parades beginning in the early 1970s. The organization also launched Prometheus, a decades-long- running magazine, in the early 1970s, exploring issues important to kinksters, ranging from advice columns and personal ads, to erotica and art, to conversation about the philosophy of consensual kink. The magazine now exists online. In 1992, The Eulenspiegel Society‚Äôs cofounder Pat Bond received the Steve Maidhof Award for National or International Work from the National Leather Association International. In 1996, The Eulenspiegel Society hosted the first large BDSM convention, in celebration of its 25th anniversary. This event was so well attended that the organization took over two large clubs (Hellfire Club and The Vault) as well as a disco which was converted into a club. Over 1,300 people attended. This event inspired other leather organizations to hold annual conventions as well. The Eulenspiegel Society was one of the founding coalition partners of the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, which was founded in 1997.https://ncsfreedom.org/who-we-are/the- history-of-the-ncsf/ In 1999, Gary Switch posted to The Eulenspiegel Society's USENET list \\"TES-Friends\\" proposing the term RACK (Risk-aware consensual kink) out of a desire to form a more accurate portrayal of the type of play that many engage in. Noting that nothing is truly 100% safe, not even crossing the street, Switch compared BDSM to the sport of mountain climbing. In both, risk is an essential part of the thrill, and that risk is minimized through study, training, technique, and practice. In 2002, The Eulenspiegel Society formally changed its name to \\"TES\\". In 2011, TES was inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame (under the name Eulenspiegel Society). In 2015, Bond and Nowvve (the latter under the name Terry Kolb) were inducted into the Leather Hall of Fame. Organizational activities TES (pronounced \\"Tess,\\") is an entirely volunteer-run nonprofit organization, including an elected board of directors. It \\"promotes sexual liberation for all adults, especially for people who enjoy consensual S/M\\". It regards sexual liberation as a prerequisite for a \\"truly free\\" society and it is particularly concerned about the freedom of sexual minorities such as the BDSM community. TES generally holds two classes each week (over 100 a year) in New York City, both general meetings, and ones hosted by special interest groups, ranging from bondage to a meet-ups for novices interested in alternative sexualities. In 1996, TES hosted the first large BDSM convention, in celebration of its 25th anniversary. This event was so well attended that the organization took over two large clubs (Hellfire Club and The Vault) as well as a disco which was converted into a club. Over 1,300 people attended. This event inspired other leather organizations to hold annual conventions as well. It also hosts frequent social events, including parties. Membership includes discounts at participating stores and clubs. It also supports AIDS prevention education and organizations such as the Free Speech Coalition (FSC) and the National Coalition for Sexual Freedom, for which TES is a founding coalition partner. Name TES, originally known as \\"The Eulenspiegel Society\\", took its original name from Till Eulenspiegel, a character described as a \\"foolish yet clever lad\\" in medieval German folklore. Until the early 2000s, the organization maintained the name \\"The Eulenspiegel Society\\". It formally changed its name to \\"TES\\" in 2002. The original name, which cofounder Fran Nowve came up with, was inspired by a passage from Austrian psychoanalyst Theodor Reik's Masochism in Modern Man (1941), in which he argues that patients who engage in self-punishing or provocative behavior do so in order to demonstrate their emotional fortitude, induce guilt in others, and achieve a sense of \\"victory through defeat\\". Reik describes Till Eulenspiegel's \\"peculiar\\" behavior‚Äîhe enjoys walking uphill, and feels \\"dejected\\" walking downhill‚Äîand compares it to a \\"paradox reminiscent of masochism\\", because Till Eulenspiegel \\"gladly submits to discomfort, enjoys it, even transforms it into pleasure\\".

Cyclopaedia 1728, Vol 2 The Age of Sail (usually dated as 1571‚Äì1862) was a period roughly corresponding to the early modern period in which international trade and naval warfare were dominated by sailing ships and gunpowder warfare, lasting from the mid-16th to the mid-19th centuries. Definition Like most periodic eras, the definition is inexact but instead serves as a general description. The age of sail runs roughly from the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the last significant engagement in which oar-propelled galleys played a major role, to the Battle of Hampton Roads in 1862, in which the steam-powered ironclad CSS Virginia destroyed the sailing ships USS Cumberland and USS Congress, demonstrating that the advance of steam power had rendered sail power in warfare obsolete. The Suez Canal, in the Middle-East, which opened in 1869, was impractical for sailing ships and made steamboats faster on the European-Asian sea route. Golden Age of Sail The period between the mid-18th century and the early 19th century, when sailing vessels reached their peak of size and complexity is sometimes referred to as the \\"Golden Age of Sail\\".\\"Sailing Ship Rigs\\" . Maritime Museum of the Atlantic During this time, the efficiency and use of commercial sailing vessels was at its peak--immediately before steamboats started to take trade away from sail. Decline By 1873, the Age of Sail had definitely ended, with commissioned in 1871. Devastation was the first class of ocean-going battleships that did not carry sails. HMS Devastation Sailing ships sometimes continued to be an economical way to transport bulk cargo on long voyages into the 1920s and 1930s, even though steamships were also used for such transports and became more common. Sailing ships do not require fuel or complex engines to be powered; thus they tended to be more independent from requiring a dedicated support base on the mainland. Crucially though, steam-powered ships held a speed advantage and were rarely hindered by adverse winds, freeing steam- powered vessels from the necessity of following trade winds. As a result, cargo and supplies could reach a foreign port in half the time it took a sailing ship. Sailing vessels were pushed into narrower and narrower economic niches and gradually disappeared from commercial trade. Today, sailing vessels are only economically viable for small scale coastal fishing, along with recreational uses such as yachting and passenger sail excursion ships.

This obscures clues for a cryptanalyst, and can be used to increase cryptanalytic difficulty in naive cryptographic schemes (however, most modern schemes contain more rigorous defences; see ciphertext indistinguishability). This is of course desirable for those sending messages and wishing them to remain confidential. Padding is another technique for obscuring such clues. The technique is to break the starting plaintext message into two parts and then to invert the order of the parts (similar to circular shift). This puts all endings and beginnings (presumably the location of most boilerplate phrases) \\"somewhere in the middle\\" of the version of the plaintext that is actually encrypted. For some messages, mostly those not in a human language (e.g., images or tabular data), the decrypted version of the plaintext will present problems when reversing the inversion. For messages expressed in ordinary language, there is sufficient redundancy that the inversion can almost always be reversed by a human immediately on inspection. The English phrase suggests that it originally came from an observation about Russian cryptographic practice. However, the technique is generally useful and neither was, nor is, limited to use by Russians.A History of U.S. Communications Security; the David G.

The group comprised singers Cheryl Cole, Nadine Coyle, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh. The group achieved a string of twenty consecutive top ten singles in the United Kingdom, including four number ones. They also achieved seven certified albums, of which two reached number one. They have been nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for \\"The Promise\\". The group's musical style is pop, but they had experimented with electropop and dance-pop throughout their career. Girls Aloud's collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim,Girls Aloud Critical Acclaim due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group became one of the few UK reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of ¬£30 million by May 2010. Guinness World Records lists them as \\"Most Successful Reality TV Group\\" in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for \\"Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group\\" in the 2008 edition, and are credited again for \\"Most Successful Reality TV Group\\" in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom's biggest selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone. The group disbanded in March 2013 following the conclusion of the Ten: The Hits Tour. History =2002: Popstars: The Rivals= The group Girls Aloud was formed on 30 November 2002, in front of millions of viewers on ITV's Popstars: The Rivals. The concept of the programme, hosted by Big Brother presenter Davina McCall was to produce a boyband and a girlgroup who would be \\"rivals\\" and compete for the 2002 Christmas number one single. Following the initial success of Hear'Say (winners of the original Popstars show), several thousand applicants attended auditions across the United Kingdom in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Pete Waterman, Louis Walsh and Spice Girls member Geri Halliwell. However, two of these were disqualified before the live shows began: Hazel Kaneswaran was found to be too old to participate, while Nicola Ward refused to sign the contract, claiming the pay the group would receive was too low. Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts were chosen as their replacements. During October and November, the finalists took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating week-by- week between the girls and boys). Each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated until the final line-ups of the groups emerged. The five girls who made it into the group were Cheryl Tweedy, Nicola Roberts, Nadine Coyle, Kimberley Walsh, and Sarah Harding; Javine Hylton missed out on a place in the group, despite previous expectations that she would be placed in the line-up. The group was named Girls Aloud and were managed by Louis Walsh until 2005 when Hilary Shaw replaced him. The new group competed with the boys' winning group, One True Voice to have 2002's Christmas number one single. Girls Aloud won the battle with their single \\"Sound of the Underground\\", produced by Brian Higgins and Xenomania. The song spent four consecutive weeks at number one and was certified platinum in March 2003. The song received critical acclaim; Alexis Petridis of The Guardian stated that \\"it proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture\\". =2002‚Äì2005: Sound of the Underground and What Will the Neighbours Say?= After the success of their first single \\"Sound of the Underground\\", Girls Aloud spent five months recording the follow-up single and their debut album. Sound of the Underground was completed in April 2003 and released the following month. The album entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry. The second single, \\"No Good Advice\\", was also released in May 2003 to similar success. Girls Aloud's third single, \\"Life Got Cold\\", charted at number three in August 2003. In November 2003, Girls Aloud released a cover version of the Pointer Sisters' 1980s dance hit \\"Jump\\". The single, which charted at number two, accompanied a new edition of Sound of the Underground. After a brief hiatus, Girls Aloud released \\"The Show\\" in June 2004, the first single from What Will the Neighbours Say?, the group's second album. The single entered the charts at number two. The next single, \\"Love Machine\\", also peaked at number two in September 2004. Girls Aloud then recorded a cover of The Pretenders' \\"I'll Stand by You\\" which was released as the official Children in Need charity single. The song was not well received by critics; however, the cover became Girls Aloud's second number one single, holding the position for two weeks. The album What Will the Neighbours Say? was entirely written and produced by Xenomania. Upon its release on 29 November 2004, the album charted just outside of the top five and was quickly certified platinum. The final single from the album, \\"Wake Me Up\\", was released in February 2005. It charted at number four, making it their first to miss the top three. In early 2005, the group was nominated for a BRIT Award for Best Pop Act. Following the album's success, Girls Aloud announced their first tour, the What Will the Neighbours Say...?

The follow-up single from the album, \\"Biology\\" was released in November 2005. The song was critically acclaimed; Peter Cashmore of The Guardian labeled it \\"the best pop single of the last decade\\". The release was followed by a cover of Dee C. Lee's \\"See the Day\\", released in the Christmas week of 2005., following this they presented one-off TV Special, Christmas Mania, on ITV, where they sang songs taken from their Christmas album. Girls Aloud won the Heart Award for the single at the O2 Silver Clef Lunch. The group travelled to Australia and New Zealand in February 2006 to release \\"Biology\\" and Chemistry. Despite, a one-week promotional tour, \\"Biology\\" peaked at number twenty-six on the ARIA Singles Chart, failing to break the group in the Australian market. \\"Whole Lotta History\\", the fourth and final single to be taken from Chemistry, was released in March 2006 and charted at number six. In 2005, Girls Aloud filmed a one-off documentary entitled Girls Aloud: Home Truths for ITV2. The success of the show later made way for Off the Record, a six-part fly on the wall documentary series for E4. Girls Aloud then appeared in an episode of Ghosthunting with...

In the same month, Girls Aloud were moved to Fascination Records, a sub-label of Polydor Records. In October 2006, Girls Aloud released their first greatest hits collection, The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits. It debuted at number one on the UK album chart and went on to sell over one million copies. The album was accompanied by the single \\"Something Kinda Ooooh\\".

Billed as \\"Sugababes vs. Girls Aloud\\", the song served as the official single for Comic Relief which became the group's third number one. In May 2007, Girls Aloud embarked on their third tour, The Greatest Hits Tour. =2007‚Äì2009: Tangled Up, Out of Control and hiatus= Girls Aloud released their fourth studio album, Tangled Up, in November 2007. The first single from the album, \\"Sexy! No No No...\\" peaked at number-five on the UK Singles Chart. The second single, \\"Call the Shots\\" entered the top three. The third and final single from the album, \\"Can't Speak French\\", continued Girls Aloud's top ten streak. The release of the single coincided with Girls Aloud's second television series, The Passions of Girls Aloud. The show revolved around each member, with the exception of Coyle, achieving aspirations outside of the group. Girls Aloud also received their second BRIT Award nomination in 2008, nominated for the Best British Group award. In May 2008, Girls Aloud embarked on the Tangled Up Tour which consisted of 34 concerts around the United Kingdom. Girls Aloud performing in Glasgow during the Tangled Up Tour (2008) Girls Aloud then recorded two tracks for the soundtrack to the movie, St Trinian's. They also made a cameo appearance in the film as the school band. The soundtrack was released on 10 December 2007, and the video for \\"Theme to St. Trinian's\\" premiered in December 2007. In November 2008, Girls Aloud released their fifth studio album and would be their final studio album Out of Control, which entered the UK Albums Chart at number one and became their most successful studio album to date, being certified double platinum. The album's lead single, \\"The Promise\\", became the group's fourth number one on the UK Singles Chart. The single also returned the group to the top two on the Irish Singles Chart. \\"The Promise\\" was awarded Best British Single at the 2009 BRIT Awards; the group also performed the song during the ceremony. For the promotion of the album, Girls Aloud appeared in a variety show entitled The Girls Aloud Party which aired on 13 December 2008 on ITV. The second single from Out of Control was \\"The Loving Kind\\", the track was produced by Xenomania. The song peaked at number ten, becoming Girls Aloud's twentieth consecutive top ten single. The final single from the album, \\"Untouchable\\" was released in April 2009. It peaked at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the first single of Girls Aloud to miss the top ten. Girls Aloud embarked on the Out of Control Tour, which ran from April to June 2009. Their label, Fascination Records released a singles boxset collection to coincide with the tour. In February 2009, Girls Aloud signed a new record deal with Fascination that would see the group release another three studio albums. However, in July 2009, Girls Aloud announced that they were taking a year-long hiatus to pursue solo projects, but would reunite for a new studio album in 2010 which did not materialize. Two months later, Girls Aloud briefly interrupted the hiatus to do two shows supporting Coldplay along with Jay-Z at Wembley Stadium. =2012‚Äì2013: Ten and disbandment = After three years of hiatus, Girls Aloud reunited for the group's 10th anniversary. On 16 November 2012, the group released their new single, \\"Something New\\" which was the official charity single for Children in Need. The single peaked at number-two on the UK Singles Chart. The group released their second greatest hits compilation, Ten on 23 November 2012. The second single taken from Ten, \\"Beautiful 'Cause You Love Me,\\" was released on 17 December 2012. The single failed to chart in the top-forty. A documentary special entitled Girls Aloud: Ten Years at the Top aired on ITV1 on 15 December 2012. In February 2013, the group embarked on Ten: The Hits Tour. On 20 March 2013, the group performed their final concert at Echo Arena Liverpool. A few hours later, they announced their split on Twitter. Other endeavours Girls Aloud came together with Mattel in 2005 to produce Fashion Fever Barbies. Each member designed the outfit and look of a doll modelled after themselves. In addition to live DVDs of their tours and both of Girls Aloud's television series, the group has also released Girls on Film and Style. Official calendars were also issued annually from 2004 to 2009, the only exception being 2005. Girls Aloud co-wrote an autobiography titled Dreams That Glitter ‚Äì Our Story. The book, named after a lyric in \\"Call the Shots\\", was published in October 2008 through the Transworld imprint Bantam Press. Before the release, OK! magazine bought the rights to preview and serialise the book.OK! magazine . Ok.co.uk (24 September 2008). Retrieved on 5 August 2011. In 2007, Girls Aloud signed a ¬£1.25m one-year deal to endorse hair care brand Sunsilk. The girls filmed a television advertisement and appeared in and magazine advertisements, with each of the five members being the face of a different shampoo. The same year, Girls Aloud also signed a deal with the UK division of Samsung. They endorsed mobile phones and MP3 players, made personal appearances and sang at Samsung events, and contributed to competition prizes, among other activities. The Samsung F210 Purple came with a 1GB memory card featuring Girls Aloud content. Girls Aloud appeared in television advertisements for Nintendo DS the following year. The group signed a deal to front a promotional campaign for a new low-calorie KitKat bar called \\"Senses\\" in March 2008. The chocolate bar manufacturer also sponsored Girls Aloud's Tangled Up Tour. The exact worth of the endorsement is unknown, but a figure of ¬£500,000 each has been suggested. Sales increased 6.8% in the United Kingdom. Beginning in 2009, Girls Aloud teamed with Eylure to release five sets of false eyelashes, each set designed by a different member of the band. A range of festival-themed lashes followed in 2010, while limited edition \\"10th Anniversary\\" lash was released in 2012. Similarly, to celebrate their tenth anniversary, each member designed a charm bracelet for Pandora, available as either a complete bracelet or a \\"starter\\" bracelet. =Philanthropy= All five members of the group have been involved in charity work. Girls Aloud's cover of The Pretenders' \\"I'll Stand by You\\" was released as the official 2004 Children in Need single, with proceeds going to the charity. Nicola Roberts said, \\"Hopefully if our single does well it's a lot of money going to the charity.\\" Their cover Aerosmith and Run DMC's \\"Walk This Way\\", a collaboration with the Sugababes, was the official charity single for Comic Relief in 2007, recorded at Comic Relief co-founder and trustee Richard Curtis' request. Kimberley Walsh said, \\"It's a fantastic song and hopefully will raise tons of money for people living in really difficult situations here and in Africa.\\" In March 2009, Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh, and various other celebrities climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Comic Relief. The trek raised ¬£3.4 million for the charity. Between 3 February and 23 March 2009, the celebrities involved in the Kilimanjaro trek also raised money for Comic Relief by providing the voice for the BT Speaking Clock. Walsh is also a charity ambassador for Breast Cancer Haven. She helped open a ¬£2.2 million breast cancer centre in 2008 and participated in a \\"heel-a-thon\\" in 2009. In February 2011, Cheryl Cole launched her own charitable foundation named the ‚ÄúCheryl Cole Foundation with The Prince's Trust following a meeting with The Trust‚Äôs President, Charles, Prince of Wales‚Äù. The foundation provides vital funds for The Trust in the North East, helping disadvantaged young people from her own region. Girls Aloud celebrated their 10 years as a group by releasing another Children in Need single, \\"Something New\\", which they performed on the Children in Need TV special on 16 November 2012. Artistry =Musical style= Girls Aloud worked closely with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania throughout their career. Xenomania produced all of Girls Aloud's albums and singles, excluding nine songs from their debut album, Sound of the Underground, the charity single \\"Walk This Way\\" and two songs from Ten. Of Higgins and Xenomania, Girls Aloud's former manager Louis Walsh says, \\"He just makes great songs for radio. They just jump out at you and stay in your brain.\\" In a review of the group's debut single \\"Sound of the Underground\\", The Guardian's Alexis Petridis exclaimed it \\"proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture.\\" In response to Girls Aloud's debut album, Jacqueline Hodges of BBC Music said that \\"Higgins injects an element of instant-catchy-cool to the songs without going overboard in trying to shape uber-chic dance floor hits.\\" Petridis of The Guardian described What Will the Neighbours Say? as \\"a great album: funny, clever, immediate, richly inventive.\\" He later wrote that Chemistry is \\"a record that dispenses with the tiresome business of verses and instead opts for songs apparently constructed by stitching eight different choruses together.\\" Talia Kraines of BBC Music exclaimed that Girls Aloud \\"have resuscitated [pop music's] corpse by wedding chart-friendly melodies to experimental avant-garde sounds\\". \\"Biology\\" was described as \\"about as far from tired formula as you can possibly get. It sounds like three separate melodies condensed into one.\\" Popjustice referred to the song as \\"pop music which redefines the supposed boundaries of pop music.\\" In a review for 2007's \\"Sexy! No No No...\\", Nick Levine of Digital Spy complimented Xenomania's work on the song: sacrificing \\"conventional song structure in the name of keeping [...] hooks coming thick and fast ‚Äì and quite right too.\\" =Influences= The band members themselves are known to be fans of artists such as Ne-Yo, Oasis, and Michael Jackson. The group's debut album Sound of the Underground takes influence from a number of 1980s genres, such as synthpop, power pop, and new wave, and 1990s styles like big beat, drum and bass, and garage. The album received comparisons to girl groups such as Bananarama, The Bangles, and the Spice Girls. Similarities to Kylie Minogue and Madonna were also noted. A majority of the songs make use of guitars and electronic beats. The rise of indie rock also inspired Brian Higgins to \\"blur the edges between commercial music and so-called 'indie' music.\\" He continued, \\"pop music was on its backside and indie music was about to rise, through The Strokes and everything else. We were an independent company and we were as indie as the other bands around us. The guitar riff on No Good Advice is very very similar to the riff on the track Michael by Franz Ferdinand.\\" What Will the Neighbours Say? further explores different subgenres of pop, especially electropop. Synthesizers are more prominent on the album, although the usage of guitar remains prominent in several songs. The backing track to \\"Love Machine\\", composed by Xenomania musicians Tim Powell and Nick Coler, was inspired by The Smiths, while \\"Wake Me Up\\" includes a guitar riff inspired by garage rock. Chemistry takes influences from a wide variety of sources, including \\"everything from French chanson to piano-pounding blues to the clipped R&B; of the Small Faces\\". Rapping in the same vein as artists like Betty Boo and Neneh Cherry is prominent. Yahoo! Music says \\"there's nary a 'formula' in sight. There are as many sudden tonal and tempo switches as the tricksiest Chicago art rock band. And all but one song here gives guitars a starring role.\\" The songs are noticeably less rooted in electronic music, although \\"Swinging London Town\\" is \\"a dark, squiggly synth pop epic a la Pet Shop Boys\\" and \\"It's Magic\\" is composed of \\"little Royksopp-like keyboard riffs\\". Alternatively, Tangled Up features a dancier, more electronic sound, inspired by the success of their 2006 single \\"Something Kinda Ooooh\\". \\"Call the Shots\\", \\"Close to Love\\", and \\"Girl Overboard\\" are all electropop numbers reminiscent of 1980s music. However, \\"Control of the Knife\\" is more inspired by reggae and ska, while \\"Can't Speak French\\" employs \\"jazzy guitar changes\\" and \\"Black Jacks\\" recalls \\"sixties psychedelica\\". Out of Control features a number of songs inspired by 1980s electropop, while also exploring retro styles. \\"The Promise\\" is a 1960s Spector-influenced number, while \\"Rolling Back the Rivers in Time\\" was compared to the works of Burt Bacharach. =Legacy= Girls Aloud's debut single \\"Sound of the Underground\\" and another Xenomania production, Sugababes' \\"Round Round\\", have been called \\"two huge groundbreaking hits\\", credited with reshaping British pop music for the 2000s. The Telegraph placed the song at number 15 on a list of 100 songs that defined the 2000s, while NME included it at number 39. Spinner.com named \\"Sound of the Underground\\" the eighth best British song of the 2000s. In 2009, The Times included 2007's Tangled Up at number 62 on a list of the decade's best pop albums. MSN listed 2005's Chemistry as one of the decade's best albums. Girls Aloud were one of the few pop acts to achieve continued success and longevity throughout the mid-2000s while R&B; and rock music became more popular. In a review for the group's 2008 Tangled Up Tour, David Pollock of The Independent noted that \\"Girls Aloud remain confidently the only pop show in town.\\" The Times stated, \\"Not since Abba and Michael Jackson has pure pop been so unanimously praised.\\" Girls Aloud are also notably one of the few British reality television acts to achieve continued success and longevity. According to The Times, Girls Aloud are the highest-earning UK reality television stars, having amassed a fortune of ¬£25 million by May 2009. The figure was increased to ¬£30 million the following year, following Cheryl's appearance on The X Factor. All five members were included in a 2010 list of Britain's richest stars under 30. Reviews of Girls Aloud's debut album noted the high quality of the album compared to output from other reality show contestants. In 2004, David Hooper of BBC Music exclaimed that \\"Girls Aloud are currently British pop royalty [...] in the ultra-fickle world of TV-generated pop, Girls Aloud have real staying power.\\" Andrew Lynch of entertainment.ie said, \\"Girls Aloud really shouldn't have made it as far as a second album. [...] There's just one problem ‚Äì the girls have a knack of coming up with utterly infectious pop songs\\". The group has also received praise from the Jonas Brothers, Aggro Santos, Matt Helders, Duff McKagan, Gabriella Cilmi, Noel Gallagher, Neil Tennant, Selena Gomez, and Spice Girls members Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell. Bono referred to himself as a fan of the group, saying: \\"I think Girls Aloud are at the cutting edge of pop music. They are a great band and they deserve to be centre stage.\\" Chris Martin also said that he is a fan of the group, referring to them as \\"the ultimate form of life,\\" while Julie Burchill has stated that Girls Aloud are \\"simply the most perfect pop group since The Monkees.\\" In addition, Girls Aloud have had their music covered by artists as varied as Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party, and Coldplay, among others.

They were essentially smaller and hence cheaper versions of the three-decker first rates. Like the first rates, they fought in the line of battle, but unlike the first rates, which were considered too valuable to risk in distant stations, the second rates often served also in major overseas stations as flagships. They had a reputation for poor handling and slow sailing. They were popular as Flagships of admirals commanding the Windward and/or Leeward islands station, which was usually a Rear-admiral of the red. Rating Typically measuring around 2000 tons burthen and carrying a crew of 750, the second-rates by the second half of the 18th century carried 32-pounder guns on the gun deck, with 18-pounders instead of 24-pounders on the middle deck, and 12-pounders on the upper deck (rather than 18- or 24-pounders on first rates), although there were exceptions to this. Both first and second rates carried lighter guns (and, after 1780, carronades) on their forecastles and quarterdecks. =Three-decker v two- decker= The three-decker second-rate was mainly a British type, and was not built by other European navies to any great degree.Gardiner p. 14 As speed is mainly determined by length along the waterline, the three-deck, second-rate was a slow sailer compared to both its two-deck equivalent and the first-rate ships.Gardiner p. 18 Being the same height as a first-rate but shorter meant they handled poorly and had a tendency to sail to leeward; was described by one of her lieutenants as sailing \\"like a haystack\\".Gardiner pp. 14 - 15 Their poor sailing abilities prompted Nelson, at Trafalgar, to order Prince and to approach the enemy at a lesser angle than the remainder of the column, in the hope that having more sail area exposed to the wind, would enable these two ships to keep up. A near disastrous example of the three-decker's maladroitness occurred on 25 December 1796 when, on sighting the enemy, the Channel Fleet attempted a hurried departure from Spithead: Four second-rates collided with each other while another ran aground.Gardiner p. 15 Apart from its unhandiness, in terms of sheer firepower it was matched or even out-gunned by many of the large 80-gun and 74-gun two-deckers used by the French and Spanish navies. The additional height did, however, give the second rate an advantage in close combat with the further advantage of it being able to withstand punishment like a larger ship, but being much cheaper to build and maintain. It was sometimes mistaken by the enemy for a first-rate, which could possibly make enemy commanders reluctant to press an attack. Term The term \\"second-rate\\" has since passed into general usage as an adjective used to mean of suboptimal quality, inferior to something that is \\"first-rate\\".  Bibliography  * Bennett, G.

Manufactured by Tupolev, the Tu-22 entered service with the Soviet military in the 1960s. The last examples were retired during the early 2000s. Produced in comparatively small numbers, the aircraft was a disappointment, lacking the intercontinental range that had been expected. Later in their service life, Tu-22s were used as launch platforms for the Soviet Kh-22 standoff missile, and as reconnaissance aircraft. Tu-22s were sold to other nations, including Libya and Iraq. The Tu-22 was one of the few Soviet bombers to see combat; Libyan Tu-22s were used against Tanzania and Chad, and Iraqi Tu-22s were used during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Development The Tu-22 was intended originally as a supersonic replacement for the Tupolev Tu-16 bomber. Preliminary design of an aircraft to meet this requirement, designated Samolyot 105 by Tupolev, was started in 1954, with the first prototype completed in December 1957. It made its maiden flight from Zhukovsky on 21 June 1958, flown by test pilot Yuri Alasheev. The availability of more powerful engines, and the TsAGI rediscovery of the Area rule for minimizing transonic aerodynamic drag, resulted in the construction of a revised prototype, the 105A. This first flew on 7 September 1959. The first serial- production Tu-22B bomber, built by Factory No. 22 at Kazan, flew on 22 September 1960, and the type was presented to the public in the Tushino Aviation Day parade on 9 July 1961, with a flypast of 10 aircraft. It initially received the NATO reporting name 'Bullshot', which was deemed to be inappropriate, then 'Beauty', which was deemed to be too complimentary, and finally the 'Blinder'. Soviet crews called it \\"shilo\\" (awl) because of its shape. Tu-22 Blinder landing The Tu-22 entered service in 1962, but it experienced considerable problems, resulting in widespread unserviceability and several crashes. Amongst its many faults was a tendency for skin aerodynamic heating at supersonic speed, distorting the control rods and causing poor handling. The landing speed was 100 km/h (62 mph) greater than previous bombers and the Tu-22 had a tendency to pitch up and strike its tail on landing, though this problem was eventually resolved with the addition of electronic stabilization aids. Even after some of its problems had been resolved, the 'Blinder' was never easy to fly, and it was maintenance- intensive. Among its unpleasant characteristics was a wing design that allowed aileron reversal at high deflections. When the stick had been neutralized following such an event, the deformation of the wing did not necessarily disappear but could persist and result in an almost uncontrollable aircraft. Pilots for the first Tu-22 squadrons were selected from the ranks of \\"First Class\\" Tu-16 pilots, which made transition into the new aircraft difficult, as the Tu-16 had a co-pilot, and many of the \\"elite\\" Tu-16 pilots selected had become accustomed to allowing their co-pilots to handle all the flight operations of the Tu-16 except for take-off and landings. As a consequence, Tu-16 pilots transitioning to the single-pilot Tu-22 suddenly found themselves having to perform all the piloting tasks, and in a much more complicated cockpit. Many, if not most of these pilots were unable to complete their training for this reason. Eventually, pilots were selected from the ranks of the Su-17 \\"Fitter\\" crews, and these pilots made the transition with less difficulty. By the time the Tu-22B (Blinder-A) entered service, it was already obvious that its operational usefulness was limited. Despite its speed, it was inferior to the Tu-16 with respect to combat radius, weapon load, and serviceability. Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev believed that ballistic missiles were the way of the future, and bombers like the Tu-22 were in danger of cancellation. As a result, only 15 (some sources say 20) Tu-22Bs were built. Soviet engineer checks the 23-mm R-23 cannon in remotely controlled tail turret A combat-capable aerial reconnaissance version, the Tu-22R ('Blinder-C'), was developed along with the bomber, entering service in 1962. The Tu-22R could be fitted with an aerial refueling probe that was subsequently fitted to most Tu-22s, expanding their radius of operation. 127 Tu-22Rs were built, 62 of which went to the AVMF for maritime patrol use. Some of these aircraft were stripped of their camera and sensor packs and sold for export as Tu-22Bs, although in other respects they apparently remained more comparable to the Tu-22R than to the early-production Tu-22Bs. A trainer version of the 'Blinder,' the Tu-22U ('Blinder-D'), was fielded at the same time; it had a raised cockpit for an instructor pilot. The Tu-22U had no tail guns, and was not combat-capable. Forty six were produced. To try to salvage some offensive combat role for the Tu-22 in the face of official hostility, the Tu-22 was developed as a missile carrier, the Tu-22K ('Blinder-B'), with the ability to carry a single Kh-22 (AS-4 'Kitchen') stand-off missile in a modified weapons bay. The Tu-22K was deployed both by DA (Long Range Aviation), and AVMF (Soviet Naval Aviation). The last Tu-22 subtype was the Tu-22P ('Blinder-E') electronic warfare version, initially used for ELINT electronic intelligence gathering. Some were converted to serve as stand-off ECM jammers to support Tu-22K missile carriers. One squadron was usually allocated to each Tu-22 regiment. The Tu-22 was upgraded in service with more powerful engines, in-flight refueling (for those aircraft that did not initially have it), and better electronics. The -D suffix (for Dalni, long- range) denotes aircraft fitted for aerial refueling. Tu-22s were exported to Iraq and Libya during the 1970s. An Egyptian request was refused as a result of Soviet objections to the Yom Kippur War. Design The Tu-22 has a low- middle mounted wing swept at an angle of 55¬∞. The two large turbojet engines, originally 159 kN (35,273 lbf) Dobrynin VD-7M, later 162 kN (36,375 lbf) Kolesov RD-7M2, are mounted atop the rear fuselage on either side of the large vertical stabilizer, with a low mounted tailplane. Continuing a Tupolev OKB design feature, the main landing gear are mounted in pods at the trailing edge of each wing. The highly swept wings gave little drag at transonic speeds, but resulted in very high landing speeds and a long take-off run. A parked Tupolev Tu-22. The Tu-22's cockpit placed the pilot forward, offset slightly to the left, with the weapons officer behind and the navigator below, within the fuselage, sitting on downwards-firing ejector seats. The cockpit design had poor visibility compared to some bombers (doing nothing for the Tu-22's poor runway performance), uncomfortable seats, and poor locations for instruments and switches. The Tu-22's defensive armament, operated by the weapons officer, consisted of a tail turret beneath the engine pods, containing a single 23mm R-23 gun. The turret was directed by a small PRS-3A 'Argon' gun-laying radar to compensate for the weapons officer's lack of rear visibility. The bomber's main weapon load was carried in a fuselage bomb bay between the wings, capable of carrying a variety of free-fall weapons: up to 24 FAB-500 general-purpose bombs, one FAB-9000 bomb (9,000 kg/20,000 lb), or various nuclear bombs. On the Tu-22K, the bay was reconfigured to carry one Raduga Kh-22 (AS-4 'Kitchen') missile semi-recessed beneath the fuselage. The enormous weapon was big enough to have a substantial effect on handling and performance, and was also a safety hazard. The early Tu-22B had an optical bombing system (which was retained by the Tu-22R), with a Rubin-1A nav/attack radar. The Tu-22K had the Leninets PN (NATO reporting name 'Down Beat') to guide the Kh-22 missile. The Tu-22R could carry a camera array or an APP-22 jammer pack in the bomb bay as an alternative to bombs. Some Tu-22Rs were fitted with the Kub ELINT system, and later with an under-fuselage pallet for M-202 Shompol side looking airborne radar, as well as cameras and an infrared line-scanner. A small number of Tu-22Ks were modified to Tu-22KP or Tu-22KPD configuration with Kurs-N SIGINT equipment to detect enemy radar systems and provide compatibility with the Kh-22P anti-radiation missile. Operational history =Libya= The Libyan Arab Republic Air Force (LARAF) used the Tu-22 in combat against Tanzania in 1979 as part of the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War to help its Ugandan allies, with a single Tu-22 flying a completely unsuccessful bombing mission against Mwanza on 29 March 1979. A U.S. Navy F-4N intercepts Tu-22s being delivered to Libya in 1977. The Libyan aircraft were also used against Chad as part of the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict, with strikes into western Sudan and Chad. Libyan Tu-22s flew their first mission over Chad on 9 October 1980 against Hiss√®ne Habr√©'s forces near the Chadian capital of N'Djamena. Occasional bombing raids by small numbers of Tu-22s against targets in Chad and Sudan, including a raid on Omdurman in September 1981, which killed three civilians and injured 20 others, continued to be performed until a ceasefire was arranged in November 1981. Fighting restarted in July 1983, with Libyan air power, including its Tu-22s, being used in attacks against forces loyal to Habr√©, before a further ceasefire stopped the fighting until Libyan-assisted forces began a fresh offensive in early 1986. On 17 February 1986, in retaliation for the French Operation √âpervier (which had hit the runway of the Libyan Ouadi Doum Airbase one day earlier), a single LARAF Tu-22B attacked the airfield at N'Djamena. Staying under French radar coverage by flying low over the desert for more than 1,127 km (700 mi), it accelerated to over Mach 1, climbed to 5,030 m (16,503 ft) and dropped three heavy bombs. Despite the considerable speed and height, the attack was extremely precise: two bombs hit the runway, one demolished the taxiway, and the airfield remained closed for several hours as a consequence. The bomber ran into technical problems on its return journey. U.S. early warning reconnaissance planes based in Sudan monitored distress calls sent by the pilot of the Tu-22 that probably crashed before reaching its base at Aouzou (maybe hit by twin-tubes that fired in N'Djamena airport). On 19 February, another LARAF Tu-22 attempted to bomb N'Djamena once again. The Tu-22 was intercepted by a patrol of French Air Force Mirage F1Cs, and shot down 110 kilometers off Chad's capital city. One bomber was shot down by captured 2K12 Kub (SA-6) surface-to-air missiles during a bombing attack on an abandoned Libyan base at Aouzou on 8 August 1987. One eyewitness report suggests that the pilot ejected but his parachute was seen on fire. Another Blinder was lost on the morning of 7 September 1987, when two Tu-22Bs conducted a strike against N'Djamena. A French battery of MIM-23 Hawk SAMs of the 402nd Air Defence Regiment shot down one of the bombers, killing the East German crew. This raid was the last involvement of the Tupolev Tu-22 with the Chadian‚ÄìLibyan conflict. The last flight of a Libyan Blinder was recorded on 7 September 1992. They are probably now unserviceable because of a lack of spare parts, although seven are visible at the Al Jufra Air Base at the following coordinates: . They were reportedly replaced by Su-24s. =Iraq= Iraq used its Tu-22s in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War from 1980 to 1988. Offensive operations started on the first day of the war, when a Tu-22 based at H-3 Air Base struck an Iranian fuel depot at Mehrabad International Airport, Tehran, which in conjunction with other Iraqi attacks resulted in a shortage of aviation fuel for the Iranians in the early period of the war. Otherwise, these early attacks were relatively ineffective, with many raids being aborted owing to Iranian air defences and operations being disrupted by heavy Iranian air strikes against Iraqi airfields. Iran claimed three Tu-22s shot down during October 1980; one on 6 October over Tehran, and two on 29 October, one near Najafabad by an AIM-54 Phoenix missile launched by an F-14 interceptor and one over Qom. Iraq deployed its Tu-22s during the War of the Cities (along with Tu-16s, Su-22s and MiG-25s), flying air-raids against Tehran, Isfahan and Shiraz, with these attacks supplemented by Iraqi Scud and Al Hussein missiles. Iran retaliated against Iraqi cities with its own Scuds. The Iraqi Air Force were particularly enthusiastic users of the gargantuan FAB-9000 (9,000 kg/20,000 lb) general-purpose bomb, which skilled Tu-22 pilots could deploy with impressive accuracy, utilizing supersonic toss bombing techniques at stand-off distances and allowing the aircraft to escape retaliatory anti-aircraft fire. Usage of the FAB-9000 was so heavy that the Iraqis ran low of imported Soviet stocks and resorted to manufacturing their own version, called the Nassir-9. Iraqi Tu-22s were also deployed in the last stages of the \\"Tanker War\\". On 19 March 1988, four Tu-22s together with six Mirage F.1s carried out a raid against Iranian oil tankers near Kharg Island. The Tu-22s sank one supertanker and set another on fire, while Exocet missiles from the Mirages damaged another tanker. A second strike against Kharg Island later that day was less successful, encountering alerted Iranian defences, with two Tu-22s being shot down. These were the final operations carried out by Iraq's Tu-22s during the Iran‚ÄìIraq war. Iraq lost seven Tu-22s during the war, with several more badly damaged. The remaining Iraqi Tu-22s were destroyed by American air attacks during the 1991 Gulf War. =Soviet Union= The only Soviet combat use of the Tu-22 occurred in 1988, during the Soviet withdrawal from the war in Afghanistan. Tu-22P Blinder-E electronic jammers were given the task of covering the withdrawal route back to the Soviet Union. Radar-jamming Tu-22PD aircraft covered Tu-22M3 Backfire-C bombers operating out of the Mary-2 airfield in the Turkmen SSR on missions in Afghanistan near the Pakistani border. They protected the strike aircraft against Pakistani F-16 air defence activity and suppressed radar systems which could aid Pakistani F-16 attacks on the Soviet bombers in the border region. Tu-22PD crews were also tasked with photo-reconnaissance missions, to assess bomb- damage, in addition to their primary electronic warfare missions. The Tu-22 was gradually phased out of Soviet service in favor of the more-capable Tupolev Tu-22M. At the time of the dissolution of the Soviet Union there were 154 remaining in service, but none are now believed to be used. The Tu-22M was still in use as of 2017. Variants A total of 311 Tu-22s of all variants were produced, the last in 1969. Production numbers were following: 15 of bomber version (B), about 127 of reconnaissance versions (R, RD, RK, RDK and RDM), 47 of ELINT versions (P and PD), 76 of missile carriers (K, KD, KP and KPD) and 46 of training versions (U and UD).

Their productions are staged at Papermill Theatre, at historic Todmorden Mills on Pottery Road in East York, Toronto. Original productions =H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation= H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation is a Star Trek adaptation of two famous Gilbert and Sullivan operettas (HMS Pinafore and Trial by Jury). In Toronto, it was first presented by the North Toronto Players in 1999. For the show, new lyrics are often added and musical adjustments made, while keeping true to the humor and musical beauty of the original. For example, the song \\"I am an Englishman\\" was changed to \\"I Am Canadian\\" (which not only made it more local, but made reference to a very popular Molson Canadian beer commercial advertisement which ends with that phrase, see I Am Canadian). It was adapted in Toronto by Michael Harms and John Ricciardelli. Plot The Pinafore is at its starbase being readied for further space exploration. Ralph (pronounced \\"Raif\\") Rackstraw declares his love for Josephine, the daughter of Captain Corcoran. Ralph is supported by most members of the crew with the exception of Dick Deadeye, a Klingon. Little Buttercup, a Betazoid woman who is on board to sell items to the crew, hints that she knows a secret from Ralph's past. The Captain consults his daughter Josephine and reminds her that she has the opportunity to marry Sir Joseph Porter, who is First Lord of the Starfleet Admiralty and a wealthy Ferengi. Sir Joseph arrives with his entourage of 'relatives' (Cousin Hebe and a variety of aliens) and impresses all with his exalted position. Ralph, dejected, informs his friends that he plans to end it all. In a dramatic moment, Josephine declares her love for him and they agree to leave the ship and get married. Ralph and Josephine's stealthy departure with friends from the crew is foiled when they are intercepted by Dick Deadeye and the Captain. Sir Joseph intervenes but is shocked to learn that Ralph has dared to contemplate marriage with Josephine. He orders a court-martial for the insubordinate crewman! Everyone assembles for the trial in which Sir Joseph serves as judge. After several eloquent pleas, the dilemma remains unsolved and Ralph is about to be incarcerated. It is then that Buttercup reveals her secret and provides a happy solution to the social conflict. True love unites all parties in the appropriate way!

It is assigned to the daisy family. Flowers can be found from February to May. The stems of this plant dry-out when the seeds are ripe and break free from the underground root, and are then blown away like a tumbleweed, thus spreading the seeds effectively over large areas with little standing vegetation. This plant is native to the eastern Mediterranean and the Middle-East. Opinions differ about the number of species in Gundelia. Sometimes the genus is regarded monotypic, Gundelia tournefortii being a species with a large variability, but other authors distinguish up to nine species, differing in floret color and pubescence. Young stems are cooked and eaten in the Middle-East and are said to taste like a combination of artichoke and asparagus. The plant also contains compounds that have been demonstrated to be effective against a range of ailments. A large quantity of pollen assigned to Gundelia has been found on the Shroud of Turin, which may suggest that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia, but this finding has been contested. It's called Akkoub () in Arabic, silifa in Greek, Akuvit ha-Galgal () in Hebrew, Kangar () in Armenian and Persian, Kenger in Turkish, and Kereng in Kurdish. Any reference to Kenger in the Turkish language originates from the Kurdish language as, in Turkey, Kenger is native to and grown only in the Kurdish inhabited region. It's called tumble thistle in English.  Description  small plant in flower Gundelia tournefortii is a spiny hemicryptophyte with stems 20‚Äì100 cm high, that branch from the base, the first growth of the plant consists of a rosette of leaves. All parts contain a milky latex. The parts above the surface break from the root and may be blown away by the wind as a tumbleweed, assisting in the dispersion of the seed. All counts executed so far arrive at eighteen chromosomes (2n=18). = Root, stems and leaves = The plant develops a woody, vertical rootstock of up to 4 cm in diameter, at the surface usually covered by the remains of old leaves. The leaves are sessile or decurrent at their base with spiny wings, and alternate set along the stems. The lowest leaves are usually 7‚Äì30 cm long and 4‚Äì16 cm wide, pinnately dissected and the sections of the larger leaves may be pinnately parted themselves, and have a dentate or serrate margin, all tipped with spines. The midvein and sideveins are prominent, whitish, sometimes tinged purple. The leaf surface may be covered in spiderweb-like hairs, that tend to wither away quickly. = Inflorescence = tumbleweed-stage The stem divides into ten or more branches, each of which is topped by a compound spiny ovoid inflorescence of 4‚Äì8 cm in diameter, which may be covered in dense arachnoid hairs. This inflorescence is unusual for members of the family Asteraceae, as each true flowerhead is so far reduced as to only contain one floret, which is surrounded by its own involucre. Five to seven of these monofloral flowerheads combine into secondary flowerheads, each subtended by a spiny bract hardly or substantially longer than the secondary flowerheads, with only the centre floret developing a cypsela, and the surrounding ones only producing pollen. These secondary flowerheads later break free from the globose assembly of flowerheads that sit on the end of each branch of the stem during the tumbleweed-stage. Remarkable for a member of the tribe Cichorieae are also the disk florets, a trait that is further only present in Warionia saharae. cited on = Florets = The pentameric corollas are usually 7‚Äì10 mm long, gloomy purple or yellowish outside, white to bright yellow, greenish, flesh colored or silvery to red purple inside, with spreading narrow lobes of 3‚Äì4 mm mm long and about 1 mm wide, the tube hairless inside. The five merged anthers form a cylinder of 4‚Äì6 mm long, yellow or brownish in color. The style arms are also brownish. = Pollen = Pollen is covered in acute spines. = Fruit and seed = The involucral bracts of the secondary flowerheads are merged into a brown, durable, hard cup with a fibery fringe. Each contains only one cypsela of about 8 mm long, 5 mm at its widest, somewhat dorsally compressed, narrow at its base and widest beyond halflength, with the pappus at its tip consisting of a 2 mm high cup, narrowest at its base. = Characters common to all Asteraceae = Like in all Asteraceae, the pentameric flowers have anthers that are fused together forming a tube through which the style grows. The style picks up the pollen on hairs along its length and splits into two style branches at its tip. These parts sit on an inferior ovary that grows into an indehiscent fruit in which only one seed develops (a so-called cypsela). All florets (in this case only one) are set on a common base (the receptacle), and are surrounded by several rows of bracts, that form an involucre. A particular character of Gudelia that is rare among the Asteraceae is that florets are gender specialised, with the central floret being functionally hermaphrodite and the marginal florets being functionally male. = Characters common to Cichorieae = Tumble thistles are assigned to the Cichorieae-tribe that shares anastomosing latex canals in both root, stem and leaves, and has flower heads only consisting of one type of floret. In Warionia and Gundelia these are exclusively disk florets, while all other Cichorieae only have ligulate florets. Gundelia is unique in the complex morphology of the inflorescences. = Differences with other genera = Warionia and Gundelia share a thistle-like appearance, anastomosing latex- ducts, floral heads that only contain disk florets, spurred anthers, and styles with branches and highest part of the scape covered with long hairs. Gundelia however is herbaceous, has monofloral primary flowerheads combined into groups of five to seven, the centre floret hermaphrodite, the marginal florets functionally male, and those groups combined in ovoid spiny florescences at the end of the stem, and spiny leaves, florets dull yellow to dull purple on the inside, purple to rusty on the outside. Warionia is a shrub, has many dandelion-yellow florets in each flowerhead, single or with two or three together at the end of the branches, the leaves dentate but not spiny. Scolymus is also a thistle-like herbaceaceous perennial with anastomosing latex-ducts, related to Gundelia, but it has many yellow, orange or white ligulate florets in each flowerhead, which are arranged with many in a spike-like inflorescence, or with a few at the end of the stems. = Phytochemistry = Gundelia contains several essential oils, with large proportions (20-25% each) of thymol and germacrene-D.  Taxonomy  = Taxonomic history = As far as known, the tumble thistle was first collected during an expedition by Leonhard Rauwolf (1573‚Äì1575), and this specimen can now be found in the National Herbarium in Leiden, the Netherlands. Tournefort, Von Gundelsheimer and Claude Aubriet also collected this plant while traveling through Greece, Turkey, former Armenia and Persia (1700‚Äì1702). Since Von Gundelsheimer was the first to have sighted the plant, his companions began to call it Gundelia. Tournefort already observed the remarkable morphology of the compounded flowerheads. Carl Linnaeus in 1753 adopted and published this name, providing the correct name. Henri Cassini in 1821 suggested to assign this species to the tribe Vernonieae. In 1828 he specified this assignment to the Vernonieae-Rolandreae, a group formalized by Christian Friedrich Lessing as subtribe Rolandrinae in 1831. Following a change in the interpretation of the complex inflorescence, Cassini rejected the interpretation by Linnaeus, and erected the genus Gundelsheimera, which is illegitimate as it is based on the same type specimen. Next, George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1873 placed the species in the tribe Arctotideae, subtribe Gundelieae (corrected name Gundelinae). Pierre Edmond Boissier in 1875 thought this taxon sufficiently divergent to erect the tribe Gundelieae. Karl August Otto Hoffmann misspelled the genus name as Grundelia, while remarking that Gundelsheimera is a synonym. Other authors hesitantly considered a position for Gundelia in the Cardueae sensu lato. It recently has also been combined with Warionia in the tribe Gundelieae by C. Jeffrey. = Number of species = a plant with purple corollas The earliest descriptions of Gundelia recognise that the corollas could be cream, flesh coloured or purplish. Linnaeus regarded the genus as monospecific, but distinguished plants with purple corollas as variety Œ≤. Bornm√ºller in 1939 distinguished a forma purpurascens. Other infraspecific taxa differ only in leaf characters. Many modern authors recognise only Gundelia tournefortii with a wide variation in corolla color, or both G. tournefortii and a much more uniform G. aragatsi Nersesyan with brown red corollas and very downy inflorescences. Other species distinguished by some authors are G. armeniaca Nersesyan, G. dersim Vitek, Y√ºce & Ergin, G. glabra Vitek, Y√ºce & Ergin and G. munzuriensis Vitek, Y√ºce & Ergin, G. rosea Al-Taey & Hossain, G. tenuisecta Vitek, Y√ºce & Ergin and Gundelia vitekii Armaƒüan. = Modern classification = Debate on the number of subtaxa remains and some authors think there is only one species, Gundelia tournefortii. Others also recognise G. aragatsi, a form only known from Armenia, that has brown red corollas and very felty inflorescences. Some even distinguish up to nine different taxa. Gundelia is now assigned to the Cichorieae-tribe, as the basal member of the Scolyminae-subtribe. = Phylogeny = According to recent genetic analyses, the genus Gundelia is related to the genera Hymenonema, Scolymus and Catananche. This results in the following relationship tree. = Etymology = Pedanius Dioscorides called this plant silybum. The genus Gundelia is named to honor Andreas von Gundelsheimer (1668‚Äì1715), a German botanist, while the species name tournefortii was named after Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, a French botanist, who together undertook a botanical journey to the Levant, during which the species was collected, described and illustrated.  Distribution  The tumble thistle can be found in Cyprus, Turkey (Anatolia), Armenia, Azerbaijan, Northern Iraq, northern Iran, Afghanistan, western Syria, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt. It has been introduced in Algeria.  Ecology  Gundelia grows on limestone, igneous rock or reddish soils, in steppe, open oak or pine woodland, or between coppices, as weed in barley- or cornfields, fallowed or deserted fields, and in roadsides. It can be found at altitudes up to 2500 m. It is pollinated by insects such as honey bees and pollen feeding beetles, such as the Garden Chafer.  Cultivation  Seeds germinate slowly and may take several years. Seedlings can be planted outside but required light, well-drained soil, and protection against frost. Growth is slow during the first year. Plants can be grown in the rock garden, or on raised beds. Gundelia is probably hardy to about ‚àí15 ¬∞C when the drainage is good. Plants have been grown intermittently at the √âcole de Botanique and in what is currently known as the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, since the 18th century.  Use  Young Gundelia-stems prepared for using as food = Food = Early in the year, Gundelia plants growing in the wild are cut at the base and the thorns are removed. Leaves, stems, roots, and particularly the undeveloped flowerheads can be eaten. The base of the young leaves which is still under the surface is used by Bedouin and Arabs to make akkub soup. In the West Bank, young flowerheads, stems and leaves are fried in olive oil, mixed with a stew of meat chops until well done, and served mixed with yogurt. Gundelia is said to taste like something between asparagus and artichoke. Another dish is to put a trimmed inflorescence in a meatball, fry these in olive oil and then simmer them in a sauce containing lemon juice. In rural communities in northern Iraq, Gundelia is still being used as a vegetable, but in Israel collecting for the market resulted in a decline in the plant population and collecting is restricted to personal use. A chewing gum can be made from the latex, a fact that is already mentioned by Tournefort in 1718, and is called \\"kenger sakƒ±zƒ±\\" in Turkish. The fruits as well as roots can be roasted and ground to be used as substitute coffee, and is known as \\"kenger kahvesi\\". In recent times, mature seeds have been used to extract oil. Remains of charred inflorescences of Gundelia from the neolithic found in Turkey and Iraq indicate that oil was pressed from the seeds as long as at least 10,000 years ago. The seeds are edible (called ÿ≥ÿ≥ŸëŸä \\"Sissi\\" in Northern Iraq); dried, salted and roasted are sold in nut shops, the taste similar to sun flower seeds. The cypselas contain almost 7% oleic acid and 12¬Ω% linoleic acid, making the oil comparable to soybean, corn, sunflower and sesame oils. Commercial use would be dependent on plant breeding to improve crop yield, suitability for harvesting and for food processing, such as selection of spineless plants. = Medical uses = Traditionally, Gundelia is used to treat a wide variety of ailments such as liver diseases, diabetes, chest pain, heart attacks, pain in the chest and the stomach, leukoderma, diarrhea and bronchitis. In addition hypoglycaemic, laxative, sedative, anti-inflammatory, anti-parasite, antiseptic and emetic effects have been claimed, as well as improvement of the gums and curing spleen enlargement. Proven effects include antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, antioxidant, antiplatelet and cholesterol suppression. = Fodder = Fully grown foliage is used to feed livestock in spite of the spines, both fresh (in Syria and Palestine) and dry (in Kurdistan and Iran).  Culture  In 1998 pollen found on the Shroud of Turin was analysed and with 29%, the pollen assigned to Gundelia was the most numerous. Such a high density makes it very unlikely that this would merely be the result of the Shroud having been exposed to the wind, particularly because Gundelia is an insect-pollinated, not a wind-pollinated plant. Some researchers have suggested this implies that the crown of thorns was made from Gundelia-branches. Other authors doubt the accuracy of the pollen analysis and of the process of gathering the pollen from the Shroud. One reason for doubt is that during the period that pollen is present in the plant, the thorns would have still been tender. It was suggested the pollen is from Helichrysum-species which have a similar type of pollen. Helichrysum was used in classical times to make crowns and garlands for the diseased because they do not wither and remain scented for a long time. An alternative explanation suggested is that rather more recent different flowers have been pressed against the Shroud to create contact relics, while in the process contaminating it with pollen and therefore diluting the original pollen signature. Some Bible scholars think that the tumbleweed that is spoken of in Psalm 83, verse 14 \\"Make them like tumbleweed, O my God, like galgal before the wind\\" is Gundelia. Akkub, the biblical name for this species, is already mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud.

Politics = Federal Politics=  Liberal Party  Kinsella served as a strategist in the Canadian federal Liberal Party's 1993 election campaign \\"task force\\", and worked as a media adviser to opposition leader Jean Chr√©tien's office.Jeffrey, Brooke Divided Loyalties: The Liberal Party of Canada, 1984‚Äì2008, Toronto: University of Toronto Press page 198 After the Liberals won the election, Kinsella became chief of staff to federal Public Works minister David Dingwall for a short time. Lawrence Martin noted in his book Iron Man that Kinsella was accused by Peter Donolo, Chr√©tien's communications director, of being overtly aggressive and seeing enemies everywhere.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Viking: Toronto, 2003 page 240. In addition, Martin noted that many Liberal MPs expressed concern about Kinsella's behaviour. However, Kinsella was a favourite of Aline Chr√©tien, the Prime Minister's wife, which meant that the complaints were ignored. Kinsella ran as a Liberal candidate in the 1997 federal election in the riding of North Vancouver but was defeated by Reform incumbent Ted White. During his last stint as a national campaign headquarters worker during the 2000 Canadian federal election, he appeared on CTV's Canada AM brandishing a purple Barney dinosaur doll to mock what he claimed were Canadian Alliance leader Stockwell Day's creationist beliefs. Public affairs consultant Robin Sears in Policy Options used this incident to compare him to American Political Consultant James Carvile and argued that \\"The Carvillites and their young fans were less con- cerned with the substance of pol- itics or its impact on citizens' building contempt for politics than with their personal scores.\\" After the 2000 federal election, Kinsella was a vocal supporter of Chretien during the intra-party struggle that resulted in Chretien being replaced by Paul Martin. In Iron Man, Lawerence Martin noted that Kinsella saw Paul Martin and his followers \\"as almost much an enemy\\" as the opposition parties, and favored working against the Martin faction.Martin, Lawrence Iron Man, Toronto: Viking, 2003 page 39. He would work on Liberal leadership campaigns for Allan Rock and Sheila Copps in opposition to Martin. He later admitted to quitting the Liberal Party when then-cabinet minister Herb Dhaliwal had his Vancouver South-Burnaby riding association taken over by the Martin forces in November 2002. Starting in November 2008, Kinsella worked briefly for Liberal leadership candidate Michael Ignatieff. One long-time senior Liberal questioned the hiring of Kinsella, calling him a \\"human shrapnel machine.\\" Later that month Kinsella apologized for a post in his video blog that jokingly mentioned that his regular Chinese restaurant sold \\"cat meat.\\" Kinsella resigned from Ignatieff's campaign in May 2009, citing treatment of fired colleagues. Kinsella publicly considered seeking the Liberal nomination for the 2015 federal election in Toronto‚ÄîDanforth, but ultimately demurred after believing he would not be approved as a nominee. He argued that Trudeau's inner circle' played a role in the ouster of Jean Chretien as Prime Minister. He has been a critic of Justin Trudeau's leadership. https://torontosun.com/news/national/election-2019/kinsella-why-i- cant-vote-liberal-on-oct-21 During the 2019 Election, Kinsella tweets drew attention as he accused Justin Trudeau for buying drinks for Faith Goldy in a deleted post, tweeted false accusations of a suppressed Globe & Mail Story, and noted a fake website that advocated Chystria Freeland as leader of the Liberal party. After the election, Kinsella praised Trudeau by stating that he handled the right way since the election stating \\"\\"No stunts, no selfies, no over-saturation\\"\\".  Gomery inquiry  During the Gomery Commission's inquiry into the Sponsorship scandal, Justice John Gomery was told that Kinsella, while chief of staff to Minister of Public Works David Dingwall, wrote a letter to the department's Deputy Minister, Ran Quail in 1994 requesting Chuck Guit√© be appointed to review the government's advertising and communications strategy. Quail said he viewed the letter as political interference into civil service affairs, while Dingwall and Kinsella characterized the letter as a request rather than a directive. No finding of any fault was found in Gomery's report relating to Kinsella's conduct.http://www.yorku.ca/igreene/gomfactVI.pdf  Green Party  Kinsella worked for the Canadian Green Party during July of 2019 in the run-up to the 2019 Canadian federal election. This work was a temporary arrangement and involved \\"Kinsella setting up a quick-response unit for the Greens.\\" Conservative Party of Canada In October 2019, the Globe and Mail reported that Kinsella's consulting firm, Daisy Group, had, according to an anonymous source, been hired by the Conservative Party of Canada to create a campaign attempting to discredit Maxime Bernier and the People's Party of Canada. Neither the Conservative Party nor Kinsella would confirm or deny that they are ‚Äì or have been ‚Äì working together. Bernier filed a complaint to the Commissioner of Canada Elections. On October 19, 2019, Kinsella deactivated his Twitter and Facebook accounts and posted a statement on his website that he is \\"pulling back from (social) media.\\" On October 22, 2019, Kinsella called on the Commissioner of Canada Elections to investigate the role that his own firm played. On 29 October 2019 Kinsella said on his podcast that he would not reveal the who hired his company, maintaining that it was protected by solicitor-client privilege but stated the campaign should have been disclosed earlier. On November 2, Kory Teneycke cited Andrew Scheer handling of the Kinsella story to the Toronto Star as one of the example questioning Scheer future as the leader of the Conservative Party. While, CBC revealed, on November 26, 2019, a recording describing Kinsella's contempt of Bernier and identified that Conservative campaign manager Hamish Marshall and co-chair, John Walsh potentially knew about the campaign. After filing a $1 milllion lawsuit, Kinsella later settled out of court with the source; who was a former Daisy Employee, Aziza Mohammed. On December, 08, the Globe and Mail, reported that it was a lack of clarity \\"what other activities were part of the project\\" and that \\"The Conservative Party will eventually have to report all of its spending and third-party contracts to Elections Canada\\". While, Kinsella and his firm did not break the Elections Canada Act (which only governs spending), CBC News suggested that story might not end. In February 2020, Bernier launched a lawsuit alleging defamation against Kinsella. = Provincial politics =  Ontario Liberals  Kinsella was a long time supporter of Ontario premier Dalton McGuinty, and was a fixture in Ontario Liberal Party election campaigns while McGuinty was leader. The Hill Times stated that Kinsella was the individual that branded Ontario Progressive Conservatives Leader John Tory's promise to publicly fund faith-based schools during the 2007 election \\"into a Canadian version of Nixon's racist Southern strategy\\". He would apologize for a blog post during the campaign suggesting that Progressive Conservative MPP Lisa MacLeod would rather bake cookies than be seen with farm activist Randy Hillier; MacLeod would later use the remark as the humorous title for a cookbook. Kinsella supported Sandra Pupatello in the 2013 Liberal Party of Ontario leadership convention that chose a successor to McGuinty. The leadership was won by Kathleen Wynne. Kinsella was sharply critical of Wynne's campaign during the 2014 Ontario election, and subsequently.  Ontario Progressive Conservatives  On October 31, 2019, the Globe and Mail reported that a spokesperson for Autistics for Autistics (A4A), an Ontario Autism advocacy group, threatened ligation against Kinsella after warning Kinsella's Daisy firm over a suspected connection between free media training provided by his firm and the Ontario government led by premier Doug Ford. Kinsella stated that his work was unrelated with strategic advice and media training provided to Minister of Children, Community and Social Services Lisa MacLeod and her political staff in March 2018 over the restrictions to the provincial autism program. While House leader Paul Calandra, who was asked by reporters if he would release the contract, stated that Daisy' firm services was for social assistance not autism = Municipal politics = Kinsella advised John Tory in the 2003 Toronto mayoral election. In 2014 mayoral election, Kinsella assisted Olivia Chow's campaign. On August 20, 2014, Kinsella tweeted \\"Is John Tory's SmartTrack, you know, Segregationist Track?\\", and posted a photo featuring Tory and an edited speech bubble stating that Jane/Finch and Rexdale were intentionally excluded from the plan. Kinsella apologized for the incident. Daisy Consulting later announced that they had fired Chow as a client due to remarks regarding Kinsella. After a Twitter showdown between Tory's strategist Nick Kouvalis; Kinsella sued Kouvalis for $100,000 libel suit over tweets that Kinsella alleges were slanderous. Kouvalis was later reported by the Toronto Star as the person responsible for bring Kinsella as an advisor to John Tory during the 2018 Toronto mayoral election. On November 16, 2018 the OPP charged Mark Grimes along with outgoing city councillor Justin Di Ciano for allegedly filing false campaign expenses for the 2014 municipal elections, contrary to the Municipal Elections Act. In order to fight the allegations, then- councillor Di Ciano and Grimes hired the firm of strategist Kinsella to compile a \\"research\\" dossier on him and political foes such as CBC News. A few months later, Grimes faced litigation by Kinsella for allegedly failing to pay invoices for services rendered by Kinsella's Daisy Group.  Writing  In 1997, Kinsella published the novel Party Favours, a thinly veiled roman √† clef about the Chr√©tien government similar to the 1996 American novel Primary Colors.\\"Political punk\\". The Globe and Mail, August 20, 2005. The novel was initially credited to \\"Jean Doe\\",\\"Author of Party Favours keeping identity a secret\\". Toronto Star, September 17, 1997. with Kinsella only later revealing himself as the real author. Macleans associated \\"Prince of Darkness\\" with dirty politics because \\"His political books are thick with tales of dirty tricks and nasty business in Ottawa's corridors of power, and he is an admitted and most gleeful practitioner of both.\\" Kinsella runs a blog that is famous in Canadian political circles for Kinsella's on-and-off feuds with other bloggers, including one with columnist Ezra Levant that prompted Kinsella to initiate a defamation suit claiming $5,000,000 in damages. In March 2019, Kinsella started as a Toronto Sun columnist. After, it was revealed Kinsella's consulting firm worked with the Conservative Party. Canadaland reported that Sun management did not respond to questions about whether they were aware of Kinsella doing paid work on behalf of the Conservatives, but a spokesperson for parent company Postmedia stated in an email that \\"Postmedia is unaware of any financial arrangement that Warren Kinsella might have had with a political party while writing a column for the Toronto Sun.

Moulin Rouge is a 1952 British drama film directed by John Huston, produced by John and James Woolf for their Romulus Films company and released by United Artists. The film is set in Paris in the late 19th century, following artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec in the city's bohemian subculture in and around the burlesque palace the Moulin Rouge. The screenplay is by Huston, based on the 1950 novel by Pierre La Mure. The cinematography was by Oswald Morris. This film was screened at the 14th Venice International Film Festival where it won the Silver Lion. The film stars Jos√© Ferrer as Toulouse-Lautrec, with Zsa Zsa Gabor as Jane Avril, Suzanne Flon, Eric Pohlmann, Colette Marchand, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Katherine Kath, Theodore Bikel, and Muriel Smith. Plot In 1890 Paris crowds pour into the Moulin Rouge nightclub as artist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec finishes a bottle of cognac while sketching the club's dancers. The club's regulars arrive: singer Jane Avril teases Henri charmingly, dancers La Goulue and Aicha fight, and owner Maurice Joyant offers Henri free drinks for a month in exchange for painting a promotional poster. At closing time, Henri waits for the crowds to disperse before standing to reveal his four-foot six-inch stature. As he walks to his Montmartre apartment, he recalls the events that led to his disfigurement. It is revealed that Lautrec as a boy fell down a flight of stairs, whereupon his legs failed to heal because of a genetic weakness resulting from his parents being first cousins. His legs stunted and pained, Henri loses himself in his art, while his father leaves his mother, the countess, to ensure that they have no more children. Henri is a bright, happy child, revered by his father, the Count de Toulouse-Lautrec. As a young adult, he proposes to the woman he loves but, when she tells him that no woman will ever love him, he leaves his childhood home in despair to begin a new life as a painter in Paris. Back in the present, street walker Marie Charlet begs Henri to rescue her from police sergeant Patou. Henri wards off the policeman by pretending to be her escort, after which she insists on following him home. There, she addresses his small stature and, although he is at first angry, he allows her to stay and is charmed when she claims not to care about his legs. Within days, he is buying her gifts and singing as he paints, until Marie takes his money and stays out all night. Henri waits in agony for her return, but when she finally does he tells her to leave at once. Realizing he loves her, Marie vows to stay and love him back. Though she continues to fight with him, he tells himself her crassness stems from her poverty, and lets her stay. During one fight Marie tells Henri he can never attract a real woman, and leaves. By morning, she begs him to take her back, but he refuses. He begins drinking and does not stop until his landlady calls his mother, who urges him to save his health by finding Marie. Henri searches Marie's working-class neighborhood, finally discovering her at a caf√©, where she drunkenly reveals she stayed with him only to procure money for her boyfriend. When she adds that his touch made her sick, Henri returns to his apartment, and turns on the gas vents. As he sits waiting to die, he is suddenly inspired to finish his Moulin Rouge poster and, brush in hand, distractedly turns the vents off again. The next day, Henri brings the poster to the dance hall and, though the style is unusual, Maurice accepts it. Henri works for days at the lithographers, blending his own inks to perfect the vivid colors. When he finishes the poster, which shows a woman dancing with her legs exposed, it becomes an instant sensation and the Moulin Rouge opens to high society. His father denounces Henri for the \\"pornographic\\" work. Over the next ten years, Henri records Parisian life in brilliant paintings. By 1900 he is famous, but still terribly lonely. One day he sees Myriamme Hyam standing at the edge of Pont Alexandre III over the Seine River. Thinking she might jump, he stops to talk to her. She spurns his advances and throws a key into the water. Days later, Jane, a friend of Myriamme, arranges a meeting for them. Myriamme is a great admirer of Henri's paintings, and the two begin to spend time together. She soon reveals to Henri that the key she threw into the water belonged to a married man, Marcel de la Voisier, who asked her to be his mistress. While Henri continues to decry the possibility of true love he falls in love with Myriamme. One day the two see dancer La Goulue on the street drunkenly insisting that she was once a star. Henri realizes that the Moulin Rouge has become a respectable establishment and no longer the home for misfits. Myriamme informs Henri that Marcel has asked her to marry him. Certain she loves the more handsome man, he bitingly congratulates her for trapping Marne. Myriamme asks Henri if he loves her, but, believing that she is only trying to spare his feelings, he lies and tells her he does not. By the time he receives a letter from her stating that she loves him, but cannot wait any longer, Myriamme has left the city and Henri goes on an unsuccessful search for her. Weeks later, while sitting in a dive drinking steadily, Henri repeatedly reads Myriamme's note. Patou, now an inspector, is called to help him. Once home, in a state of delirium tremens, Henri hallucinates that he sees cockroaches, and in trying to drive them away, accidentally falls down a flight of stairs. Near death, Henri is brought to his family home. After a priest reads the last rites, his father tearfully informs Henri that he is to be the first living artist to be shown in the Louvre, and begs for forgiveness. Henri turns his head and watches as phantasmal characters from his Moulin Rouge paintings, including Jane Avril, dance into the room to bid him goodbye before his death.

To transform Ferrer into Henri required the use of platforms and concealed pits as well as special camera angles, makeup and costumes. Short body doubles were also used. In addition, Ferrer used a set of knee-pads of his own design allowing him to walk on his knees . He received high praise not only for his performance, but for his willingness to have his legs strapped in such a manner simply to play a role. It was reported that John Huston asked cinematographer Oswald Morris to render the color scheme of the film to look \\"as if Toulouse-Lautrec had directed it\\".Tom Vallance, \\"Obituary: Sir John Woolf\\", The Independent, 1 July 1999 Moulin Rouge was shot in three-strip Technicolor. The Technicolor projection print is created by dye transfer from three primary-color gelatin matrices. This permits great flexibility in controlling the density, contrast, and saturation of the print. Huston asked Technicolor for a subdued palette, rather than the sometimes-gaudy colors \\"glorious Technicolor\\" was famous for. Technicolor was reportedly reluctant to do this. The film was shot at Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, Surrey, England, and on location in London and Paris. Reception During its first year of release it earned ¬£205,453 in UK cinemasVincent Porter, 'The Robert Clark Account', Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Vol 20 No 4, 2000 p.499 and grossed $9 million at the North American box office.

They contrast with figurehead presidents, common in most parliamentary republics, in which the president serves symbolic, nonpolitical roles (and often is appointed to office by parliament) while the prime minister holds all relevant executive power. A small number of nations, most notably South Africa and Botswana, have both an executive presidency and a system of governance that is parliamentary in character, with the President elected by and dependent on the confidence of the legislature. In these states, the offices of president and prime minister (as both head of state and head of government respectively) might be said to be combined. The above examples notwithstanding, executive presidencies are found in presidential systems and semi-presidential systems. In order to prevent the abuse of power, checks and balances are implemented through the legislative and judiciary bodies. For example, in the United States one method is impeachment whereby the president can be held accountable if others deem their actions unconstitutional, with the most recent example being the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.  Elections  In parliamentary republics, presidents are most commonly chosen by the legislature. However, in those countries with both a prime minister and a president, methods differ. For example, in Ireland a plurality vote from the public elects the president. In presidential and semi-presidential systems, the president is elected independently of the legislature. There are several methods in which to do this, including the plurality system and the two-round system. Whilst these methods use the popular vote, not all presidents are chosen in this way. For example, to be elected in the United States, a candidate must win a majority of the votes from the Electoral College - not the popular vote.

She was the mother of musician and producer Michael Nesmith of The Monkees. Biography Graham was born Bette Clair McMurray, in Dallas, Texas, to Jesse McMurray, an automotive supply company manager, and Christine Duval.Texas Birth Index, \\"Robert Micheal Nesmith\\" born 1942, retrieved from Ancestry.com, lists his mother's full birth name. She was raised in San Antonio and graduated from Alamo Heights High School. She married Warren Audrey Nesmith (1919‚Äì1984) before he left to fight in World War II. While he was overseas she had a child (Robert Michael Nesmith, born December 30, 1942). After Warren Nesmith returned home, they divorced (1946). Her father died in the early 1950s, leaving some property in Dallas to Bette. She, her mother, Michael, and her sister Yvonne moved there. To support herself as a single mother, she worked as a secretary at Texas Bank and Trust. She eventually attained the position of the executive secretary, the highest position open at that time to women in the industry. It was difficult to erase mistakes made by early electric typewriters, which caused problems. To make extra money, she used her talent painting holiday windows at the bank. She realized as she said, \\"with lettering, an artist never corrects by erasing, but always paints over the error. So I decided to use what artists use. I put some tempera water-based paint in a bottle and took my watercolor brush to the office. I used to correct my mistakes.\\" Graham secretly used her white correction paint for five years, making some improvements with help from her son's chemistry teacher at Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas. Some bosses admonished her for using it, but coworkers frequently sought her \\"paint out\\". She eventually began marketing her typewriter correction fluid as \\"Mistake Out\\" in 1956. The name was later changed to Liquid Paper when she began her own company. Mistake Out started the 1960s operating at a small loss, with Nesmith's home doubling as company headquarters. As the product became an indispensable tool of the secretarial trade, Nesmith relocated production and shipping from her kitchen to a 10 foot-by-26 foot portable metal structure in her backyard, where packaging, shipping, and production were centered. Bette Nesmith married Robert Graham in 1962; he joined her in running the company. They divorced in 1975. She sold Liquid Paper to the Gillette Corporation for USD $47.5 million in 1979. At the time, her company employed 200 people and made 25 million bottles of Liquid Paper per year. Bette Nesmith died on May 12, 1980, at the age of 56, in Richardson, Texas after suffering a stroke. Management style From the start, Graham ran her company with a unique combination of spirituality, egalitarianism, and pragmatism. Raised a Baptist, Graham converted to Christian Science in 1942, and this faith inspired the development of her corporate \\"Statement of Policy\\". Part-code of ethics, part-business philosophy, it covered everything from her belief in a \\"Supreme Being\\" to a focus on decentralized decision making and an emphasis on product quality over the pursuit of profit. She also believed that women could bring a more nurturing and humanistic quality to the male world of business, and provided a greenbelt with a fish pond, an employee library, and a childcare center in her new company headquarters in 1975. Legacy Her only son, a musician Michael Nesmith (best known as a member of The Monkees), inherited half of his mother's estate of over $50 million. A portion financed the Gihon Foundation which established the Council on Ideas, a think tank with a retreat center located north of Santa Fe, New Mexico active from 1990 to 2000 and devoted to exploring world problems. Additionally, a portion of Graham's estate financed Betty Clair McMurray Foundation, which focuses on supporting projects such as the exhibit Texas Women, A Celebration of History, career guidance for unwed mothers, shelter and counseling for battered women, and college scholarships for mature women. In 2018 The New York Times published a belated obituary for her.

The blue silica gel in the space below the platform is used as the desiccant. Desiccators are sealable enclosures containing desiccants used for preserving moisture-sensitive items such as cobalt chloride paper for another use. A common use for desiccators is to protect chemicals which are hygroscopic or which react with water from humidity. The contents of desiccators are exposed to atmospheric moisture whenever the desiccators are opened. It also requires some time to achieve a low humidity. Hence they are not appropriate for storing chemicals which react quickly or violently with atmospheric moisture such as the alkali metals; a glovebox or Schlenk-type apparatus may be more suitable for these purposes. Desiccators are sometimes used to remove traces of water from an almost-dry sample. Where a desiccator alone is unsatisfactory, the sample may be dried at elevated temperature using Abderhalden's drying pistol. Constituents The lower compartment of the desiccator contains lumps of silica gel, freshly calcined quicklime, Drierite or (not as effective) anhydrous calcium chloride to absorb water vapor. The substance needing desiccation is put in the upper compartment, usually on a glazed, perforated ceramic plate. The ground-glass rim of the desiccator lid must be greased with a thin layer of vacuum grease, petroleum jelly or other lubricant to ensure an airtight seal. In order to prevent damage to a desiccator the lid should be carefully slid on and off instead of being directly placed onto the base. Operation In laboratory use, the most common desiccators are circular and made of heavy glass. There is usually a removable platform on which the items to be stored are placed. The desiccant, usually an otherwise-inert solid such as silica gel, fills the space under the platform. Colour changing silica may be used to indicate when it should be refreshed. Indication gels typically change from blue to pink as they absorb moisture but other colours may be used. A stopcock may be included to permit the desiccator to be evacuated. Such models are usually known as vacuum desiccators. When a vacuum is to be applied, it is a common practice to criss-cross the vacuum desiccator with tape, or to place it behind a screen to minimize damage or injury caused by an implosion. To maintain a good seal, vacuum grease is usually applied to the flanges.

There are other levels of precepts, varying amongst traditions. In Theravadan tradition there are Eight Precepts, Ten Precepts, and the Patimokkha. Eight Precepts are a more rigorous practice for laypeople. Ten Precepts are the training rules for samaneras and samaneris, novice monks and nuns, respectively. The Patimokkha is the basic Theravada code of monastic discipline, consisting of 227 rules for monks, (bhikkhus) and 311 rules for nuns (bhikkhunis). Secular law In secular law, a precept is a command in writing; a species of writ issued from a court or other legal authority. It is now chiefly used of an order demanding payment (in the UK, for example, the term is applied by local precepting authorities as part of the Council Tax system). The Latin form praecipe (i.e., to enjoin, command) is used of the note of instructions delivered by a plaintiff or his lawyer to be filed by the officer of the court, giving the names of the plaintiff and defendant. Higher education Princeton University uses the term precept to describe what many other universities refer to as recitations: large classes are often divided into several smaller discussion sections called precepts, which are led by the professor or graduate teaching assistants. Precepts or recitations usually meet once a week to supplement the lectures and provide a venue for discussion of the course material.Aaron Sommers, The Nature of Time.

He opposed the liberal Constitution of 1857 and served as President of Mexico in opposition to the constitutional president, Benito Ju√°rez of the Liberal Party. He was one the youngest rulers and the first not born during Spanish colonial rule. He served in the imperial army during the French Intervention in Mexico and was executed with Emperor Maximilian and General Tom√°s Mej√≠a by a republican army firing squad. He remains a controversial figure in Mexico, combining \\"military skill with political miscalculation.\\"Hamnett, Brian. \\"Miguel Miram√≥n\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996, vol. 4, p. 67. Early life Miram√≥n was born in Mexico City in 1831 into a very traditional family of partial French heritage. He was the son of Colonel Bernardo de Miram√≥n and his wife Carmen Tarelo, who apparently had twelve offspring. Some of them were Joaquin, Carlos and Mariano; these appeared next to his brother in his various military campaigns. At the age of 15, he fought bravely but was taken prisoner while a cadet by the U.S. Army in the September 1847 defending on Chapultepec Castle in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War.Hamnett, \\"Miguel Miram√≥n\\", p. 67. Career Miguel Miram√≥n wearing a general's court dress during Maximilian's reign He was a staunch conservative, typical of most Mexican army officers, and a supporter of aristocracy and religious privileges (fueros) for the Catholic Church and the army. In 1854-55, he fought with conservative General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna, then President of Mexico, against liberals who overthrew him in the Revolution of Ayutla that brought liberals to power. During the administration of President Ignacio Comonfort, he played a role in the city of Puebla's resistance to the liberals in 1856, and was imprisoned in 1857 after the promulgation of the new liberal Constitution of 1857. =War of Reform and presidency= During the War of Reform (1858-1861), he was the principal general of the conservative army. He fought in the north and the central lowlands on the side of the conservatives, which had ousted the liberal regime of Benito Ju√°rez, who had succeeded to the presidency of Mexico after the resignation of Comonfort. He was victorious in some early battles at Salamanca, Atentique, Ahualulco, but twice failed to take the liberal stronghold of Veracruz. He left the country after the conservative defeat, but played no part in the subsequent conservative efforts that brought Maximilian Hapsburg in the French Intervention in Mexico.Hamnett, \\"Miguel Miram√≥n\\", p. 67. Several presidents were appointed by different conservative factions. Miram√≥n's faction eventually prevailed, and on February 2nd 1860, not yet 30 years old, he assumed the presidency in the zone controlled by the conservatives. On 11 April 1859, Miram√≥n ordered the execution of not only captured liberal officers but also the doctors who had treated their wounds, as well as numerous civilians deemed sympathetic to the liberal forces. Liberals had just suffered a defeat in attempting to retake the capital from the junta now headed by Miram√≥n. As a result of this massacre, liberal General Santos Degollado ordered officers of the conservative armies shot upon capture. Between 12 August and 15 August 1860, he left the presidency to an interim, Jos√© Ignacio Pav√≥n. According to some sources, he also used the Mexico City police to raid the residence of the British consul (who was actively supporting the liberals) and steal 600,000 pesos to finance a conservative levy. He maintained hostilities against the liberals until he was defeated by the troops of Gen. Jes√∫s Gonz√°lez Ortega in San Juan del R√≠o, Quer√©taro, on 22 December. Two days later, Miram√≥n resigned and left for exile in Havana, Cuba. =Second Empire= The Execution of Emperor Maximilian (1868‚Äì69), flanked by Generals Miguel Miram√≥n and Tom√°s Mej√≠a by Eduard Manet, oil on canvas, 252 x 305 cm. Kunsthalle Mannheim While in France, he did not take part in the negotiations between the Mexican monarchists, Napoleon III and the Archduke Maximilian of Austria.Hamnett, \\"Miguel Miram√≥n\\", p. 67. When he returned to Mexico on July 28, 1863, the archduke, now crowned as Emperor Maximilian of Mexico, appointed him as Great Marshal of the Imperial Army and sent him to Berlin to study military tactics. However, the war which had lead to constant victory for the French and their allies was beginning to turn. Republican forces were now returning with support from the United States in the form of weapons and supplies. The conservatives was joining imperial forces the retreat from mainland Mexico. Miram√≥n returned in 1866 and organized the imperial defenses against the Republicans in a attempt to keep his allies fighting. On 19 February 1867, Miram√≥n, faithful to his allies, arrived at Quer√©taro to break the liberal siege holding emperor Maximilian. He took charge of the infantry and sent General Tom√°s Mej√≠a to take charge of the cavalry and rally up support for a breakout attempt. The attempt failed, however, and three months later the emperor capitulated to the republicans, against the advice of the seriously wounded Miram√≥n. On 19 June all three were shot for treason on the order of republican President Benito Ju√°rez. The execution took place at the Cerro de las Campanas in the outskirts of Quer√©taro, practically ending the Second Mexican Empire and the conservative cause. =Assessment= Miram√≥n was a talented leader, evidenced by his presidency and his high military commands during the reform war and the French intervention. He fought in defense of both his country and his factions against Americans and Mexican Liberals with unwavering and patriotic resolve. However, the defeat of his conservative faction forced Miram√≥n to leave his country, and his support of the French Empire ended with both his death and the death of Mexican conservatism on the battlefield. The commander was indefatigably dedicated in his beliefs, remaining loyal to his allies even as all hope was lost and the his liberal enemies advanced on all fronts around him. General Miram√≥n fought valorously on the losing side of history.

Design work began in 1942, the first of three prototype XC-97s flew on 9 November 1944 (none saw combat), and the first of six service-test YC-97s flew on 11 March 1947. All nine were based on the 24ST alloy structure and Wright R-3350 engines of the B-29, but with a larger-diameter fuselage upper lobe (making a figure of eight or \\"double-bubble\\" section) and they had the B-29 vertical tail with the gunner's position blanked off. The first of three heavily revised YC-97A incorporating the re-engineered wing ( higher strength 75ST alloy), taller vertical tail and larger Pratt and Whitney R-4360 engines of the B-50 bomber, flew on 28 January 1948 and was the basis of the subsequent sole YC-97B, all production C-97s, KC-97s and civilian Stratocruiser aircraft. Between 1944 and 1958, 888 C-97s in several versions were built, 811 being KC-97 tankers.Bach 1996, p. 7Bowers 1989, pp. 353‚Äì359. C-97s served in the Berlin Airlift, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War. Some aircraft served as flying command posts for the Strategic Air Command, while others were modified for use in Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadrons (ARRS). Design and development The C-97 Stratofreighter was developed towards the end of World War II by fitting an enlarged upper fuselage onto a lower fuselage and wings that were essentially the same as those of the B-29 Superfortress with the tail, wing, and engine layout being nearly identical.Swanborough and Bowers 1989, p. 125. It was built before the death of Boeing president Philip G. Johnson. It can be easily distinguished from the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser by the \\"beak\\" radome beneath the nose and by the flying boom and jet engines on later tanker models. The prototype XC-97 was powered by the Wright R-3350 engine, the same as used in the B-29. The XC-97 took off for its first flight on November 9, 1944.Bowers 1989, p. 353. YC-97 Stratofreighter with the shorter fin and smaller engines of the B-29 in 1947 On 9 January 1945, the first prototype, piloted by Major Curtin L. Reinhardt, flew from Seattle to Washington, D.C. in 6 hours 4 minutes, an average speed of with of cargo, which (at that time) was impressive for such a large aircraft. Production models featured the Pratt & Whitney Wasp Major engine, the same engine as for the B-50. The tenth and all subsequent aircraft were fitted with the taller fin and rudder of the B-50 Superfortress. The C-97 had clamshell doors under its tail, so that two retractable ramps could be used to drive in cargo. However, unlike the later Lockheed C-130 Hercules, it was not designed as a combat transport that could deliver directly to primitive forward bases using relatively short takeoffs and landings. The two rear ramps could not be used in flight; but removed, the C-97 could be used for air drops. The C-97 had a useful payload of and could carry two normal trucks, towed artillery, or light tracked vehicles such as the M56 Scorpion. The C-97 was also the first mass-produced air transport to feature cabin pressurization, which made long range missions somewhat more comfortable for its crew and passengers. The civilian derivative of the C-97 was the Boeing 377 Stratocruiser, a very luxurious transoceanic airliner that featured a lower deck lounge and could be fitted with sleeper cabins. The first Stratocruiser flew on July 8, 1947. Only 56 were built.Bach 1996, p. 40  Operational history  The C-97 entered service in 1947, during a period of rapid development of heavy transport aircraft. Only 77 were built before the Douglas C-124 Globemaster II was delivered in 1950, with nearly twice the payload capacity of the C-97. The USAF Strategic Air Command operated C-97 Stratofreighters from 1949 to 1978. Early in its service life, it served as an airborne alternative SAC command post. While only 77 C-97 transports were built, 811 were built as KC-97 Stratofreighters for inflight refueling. The KC-97 began to be phased out with the introduction of the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker in 1957. Many KC-97s were later refitted as C-97G transports and equipped several squadrons of the U.S. Air National Guard. One YC-97A (45‚Äì59595) was used in the Berlin Airlift during April 1949, operating for the 1st Strategic Support Squadron. It suffered a landing gear accident at Gatow and by the time it was repaired, the Soviet Blockade was lifted. C-97s evacuated casualties during the Korean War. C-97s also participated in the Biafran airlift, delivering relief materials to Uli airstrip in Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War. Flying under the cover of darkness and at treetop level to evade radar, at least two C-97s were lost.\\"ASN Aviation Safety Database.\\" Aviation Safety Network, Flight Safety Foundation.

They adapted Boeing 377 Stratocruiser airliners into transports, including many using C-97 tail sections including the loading ramps. Others were adapted with swiveling tails and refueling pods.

It has been criticized by some experts on nutrition and eating disorders for encouraging dieting in children as young as 8. Christy Harrison, a registered dietician, wrote in the New York Times, \\"programs like this are fertile ground for disordered eating\\" and that efforts to lose weight \\"are especially troubling when imposed on children who aren't in a position to make their own choices and who haven't had the opportunity to develop a peaceful relationship with food and their bodies.\\" However, an article in the Journal of Childhood Obesity concluded that it could be \\"part of the piece of the puzzle to improving health in youth\\", despite the authors' concerns with the marketing of the app emphasizing weight loss. An uncontrolled three-month study of the app used by children between 8 and 17 said that it was \\"highly effective\\" based on an average reduction in zBMI of 0.26, and a survey of weight management apps published in JMIR mHealth uHealth noted that of their list, only Kurbo involved health care professionals in its development.

The series originally aired on Fox and was canceled after four episodes. It was later picked up by PBS and aired in its entirety. The series was created by R. J. Cutler, a documentary filmmaker. The show received the 2001 Emmy Award for Outstanding Non-Fiction Program. The theme song \\"American High (Now It's Everything)\\", was written and performed by Bouncing Souls. An earlier Fox Network documentary series from 1991, Yearbook also covered the lives of suburban Chicago high school students. Plot Kaytee's gift for song steers an inner turmoil about her future. Morgan's sullen and needy exterior masks his true compassion. After revealing his deepest secret to his peers, what's next for Brad? Who are they? These are real teenagers who unleash their adolescent anxieties amid their triumphs in American High. At the brink of adulthood, they face some of the toughest decisions and harshest realizations of their lives during the 1999-2000 school year at a suburban Chicago high school. But these kids aren‚Äôt actors. The situations aren‚Äôt contrived. The programs are not scripted. Cameras roll and the ensuing drama is riveting and real. American High is an innovative drama series from Academy Award-nominated filmmaker R.J. Cutler (\\"The War Room,\\" \\"The Perfect Candidate\\"). Following the lives of a group of students as they deal with their personal conflicts ‚Äì both at home and at school ‚Äì from the first day of senior year through graduation, the series is culled from 10 months of documentary footage shot by Cutler and his production team, which includes some of America's leading documentary filmmakers. Also featured in the series are scenes from hundreds of hours of \\"video diaries\\" shot by the students themselves. This remarkable combination of professional footage and student-shot video provides a window into what it's like to be a teenager growing up in America today. Brimming with exuberance, hipness and stylish editing, American High boasts authenticity as well as addictive drama. \\"They trusted our crews to tell their stories truthfully and honestly,\\" says producer Cutler of the students. \\"I wanted this to be as honest as any of the best cin√©ma v√©rit√© documentaries.\\" And Cutler has succeeded, with scenes that are often brutally frank. The footage from the students‚Äô own video diaries is among the most fascinating. These scenes capture an eclectic mix of characters baring their souls as they confront conflicts with powerful emotions. Precocious Kaytee, the gifted singer/songwriter whose music fills the hallways at school and creates decision-making dilemmas for her. Easygoing and athletic Robby, whose best friend is Brad ‚Äì the first high-profile kid to announce his homosexuality, confronts the future of his shaky relationship with Sarah. Anna, whose intimidating beauty affords her everything except what she really wants ‚Äì a boyfriend. Mike (\\"Kiwi\\"), the star football kicker whose future hinges on a successful season. One of the series‚Äô most dynamic characters, rebellious Morgan, comes across as angry and needy, masking a compassionate and sensitive nature. Half a dozen other students reveal complex natures and share their innermost feelings.

It is on a bay in the middle of the Cap de Creus peninsula, near Cap de Creus cape, on the Costa Brava of the Mediterranean. It is two- and-a-quarter-hour drive from Barcelona, and thus it is accessible not only to tourists but also to people who want a second home for weekends and summers. In 2002, Cadaqu√©s had an official population of 2,612, but up to ten times as many people can live in the town during the peak of the summer tourism season. Cadaqu√©s has a special place in art history. Commanding charcoals, by local artist Eliseu Meifr√®n, of the 19th century Cadaqu√©s beleaguered by a winter tramontane, can be seen at the Cadaqu√©s museum. Fren was the first modern artist to live in Cadaqu√©s and gave the town many of his works and a marble top table on which he sketched many of its turn-of-the-century fishermen. Salvador Dal√≠ often visited Cadaqu√©s in his childhood, and later kept a home in Port Lligat, a small village on a bay next to the town. A summer holiday here in 1916, spent with the family of Ramon Pichot is seen as especially important to Dal√≠'s artistic career. Other notable artists, including Pablo Picasso, Joan Mir√≥, Marcel Duchamp, Richard Hamilton, Albert R√†fols-Casamada, Antoni Pitxot, Henri-Fran√ßois Rey, Melina Mercouri and Maurice Boitel also spent time here. Cadaqu√©s is mentioned in the story \\"Tramontana\\" by Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. The interesting submarine life of this sleepy fishing village was studied for several years by phycologist Fran√ßoise Ardr√©, long before Cadaqu√©s was discovered and transformed into a tourism destination.

The village of Cadaqu√©s has its own variant or dialect of the Catalan language. One of the most notable features is that the definite articles are different from standard Catalan, namely, they are \\"sa\\" (feminine) and \\"es\\" masculine instead of the normal Catalan definite articles \\"la\\" and \\"el\\". This feature is shared with the variant of Catalan spoken in the Balearic Islands. The explanation for this (see \\"El Vocabulari de Cadaqu√©s\\", Ernesta Sala i Bruses) is that when the Catalan ruler Jaume I conquered the Balearic Islands in the Middle Ages he re-colonized the islands with people from the Empord√† region of Catalonia. Because Cadaqu√©s has remained relatively isolated from the surrounding region (owing to its geography), the mediaeval speech patterns have been preserved. Another aspect of the speech variant of Cadaqu√©s is the alteration of the first person singular of certain verbs: conjugations that normally end in \\"o\\" end in \\"i\\" in the Cadaqu√©s variant. For example, \\"a vegades agafi molt per Cala Nans\\" (informant was an approximately 90-year-old fisherman). In standard Catalan this would be \\"a vegades agafo molt per Cala Nans\\" (meaning: sometimes I catch a lot at Cala Nans) The speech variant of Catalan has most similarities with the Catalan spoken in Ibiza (Balearic Islands). The Catalan variant of Cadaqu√©s is referred to as \\"cadaquesenc\\" by the local people and also has many lexical items. Examples include: * rastell: a street (normally with a steep slope) which is formed with pieces of slate stone placed in a vertical position. These types of streets are very characteristic of the streets of Cadaqu√©s. * grop: a black rain cloud * llagut: a small boat * talaia: an elevated castle or look-out which could warn the village of danger or transmit other signals (example: approaching ships) ‚Äì compare with the \\"talaiots\\" of Menorca. * xarxi: a (fishing) net, as opposed to \\"xarxa\\" in standard Catalan * Norai: a stone cylindrical building with a large stone on the top that fishermen used to attach their boats.  Main sights  * Salvador Dal√≠ House-Museum * Church of St. Mary (late-17th century) is the church that most stands out in the views of the town. * Hermitage of Sant Sebasti√†, a large house located high on Pen√≠ Mountain behind Cadaqu√©s. It is a private residence not open to the public. The hermitage is surrounded by cork trees, and is built on a steep slope. * Natural Park of Cap de Creus. The Cadaqu√©s shoreline Panorama of Cadaqu√©s Panorama of Cadaqu√©s  Traditions  Women of the village traditionally fetched water using a glazed earthenware jug called a \\"doll\\". The colour of the glazing was green. Similar earthenware can still be seen used as decorations. A number of photos exist showing women carrying these \\"dolls\\" on their heads (covered with a protective cloth). Owing to Cadaqu√©s's proximity to the French border and its isolation by land, the village had a tradition of running contraband. See the writings of Josep Pla.  Geology  Cadaqu√©s and the surrounding peninsula known as the Cap de Creus owes its beauty in part to its complex geology. The rocks here were pushed up when the Pyrenees (or Pirineus in Catalan) were formed, and are mostly metamorphic schists which turn a golden colour in the Mediterranean sun. Add to that the weather: this is one of the wildest spots on the Costa Brava in the winter (Costa Brava means \\"wild coast\\"), so the migmatites and schists are battered and eroded by the Tramuntana wind which whips off the mountains and by a sea that appears as if it is boiling in the force 8 winds. The Cadaqu√©s migmatites formed under extreme pressure and temperatures: a partial melt. They are halfway between an igneous and metamorphic rock. The area also contains a lot of schist: a medium grade metamorphic rock that has been flattened into sheets. White blocks of pegmatite mark where molten rock was squeezed through the older metamorphics at the end of the orogeny or mountain building. The geological history has been exposed by erosion from wind and sea, and many geologists have mapped the area for this reason.  Chinese replica  In 2010, a Chinese developer, China Merchants Zhangzhou, announced its intention to build a near-exact copy of Cadaqu√©s on more than of land on Xiamen Bay in China. The replica village is projected to house some 15,000 Chinese holidaymakers. Building is reported to begin in September or October 2010.

Meno begins the dialogue by asking Socrates whether virtue is teachable Plato, Meno, 70a. In order to determine whether virtue is teachable or not, Socrates tells Meno that they first need to determine what virtue is. When the characters speak of virtue, or rather arete, they refer to virtue in general, rather than particular virtues, such as justice or temperance. The first part of the work showcases Socratic dialectical style; Meno, unable to adequately define virtue, is reduced to confusion or aporia Plato, Meno, 80a-b. Socrates suggests that they seek an adequate definition for virtue together. In response, Meno suggests that it is impossible to seek what one does not know, because one will be unable to determine whether one has found it Plato, Meno, 80d. Socrates challenges Meno's argument, often called \\"Meno's Paradox\\" or the \\"Learner's Paradox,\\" by introducing the theory of knowledge as recollection (anamnesis). As presented in the dialogue, the theory proposes that souls are immortal and know all things in a disembodied state; learning in the embodied is actually a process of recollecting that which the soul knew before it came into a bodyPlato, Meno, 81a-e. Socrates demonstrates recollection in action by posing a mathematical puzzle to one of Meno's slaves Plato, Meno, 82a-86c. Subsequently, Socrates and Meno return to the question of whether virtue is teachable, employing the method of hypothesis. Near the end of the dialogue, Meno poses another famous puzzle, called \\"The Meno Problem\\" or \\"The Value Problem for Knowledge,\\" which questions why knowledge is valued more highly that true belief Plato, Meno, 97b-d. In response, Socrates provides a famous and somewhat enigmatic distinction between knowledge and true belief Plato, Meno, 98a. Characters Plato's Meno is a Socratic dialogue in which the two main speakers, Socrates and Meno (also transliterated as \\"Menon\\"), discuss human virtue: what it is, and whether or not it can be taught. Meno is visiting Athens from Thessaly with a large entourage of slaves attending him. Young, good-looking and well-born, he is a student of Gorgias, a prominent sophist whose views on virtue clearly influence that of Meno's. Early in the dialogue, Meno claims that he has held forth many times on the subject of virtue, and in front of large audiences. One of Meno's slaves also has a speaking role, as one of the features of the dialogue is Socrates' use of the slave to demonstrate his idea of anamnesis: certain knowledge is innate and \\"recollected\\" by the soul through proper inquiry. Another participant in the dialogue is Athenian politician Anytus, a prosecutor of Socrates with whom Meno is friendly. Dialogue =Introduction of virtue= The dialogue begins with Meno asking Socrates to tell him if virtue can be taught. Socrates says that he does not know what virtue is, and neither does anyone else he knows.Plato, Meno, 71b Meno responds that, according to Gorgias, virtue is different for different people, that what is virtuous for a man is to conduct himself in the city so that he helps his friends, injures his enemies, and takes care all the while that he personally comes to no harm. Virtue is different for a woman, he says. Her domain is the management of the household, and she is supposed to obey her husband. He says that children (male and female) have their own proper virtue, and so do old men‚Äîfree or slaves.Plato, Meno, 71e Socrates objects: there must be some virtue common to all human beings. Socrates rejects the idea that human virtue depends on a person's sex or age. He leads Meno towards the idea that virtues are common to all people, that sophrosun√™ ('temperance', i.e. exercise of self-control) and dik√™ (aka dikaiosun√™; 'justice', i.e. refrain from harming others) are virtues even in children and old men.Plato, Meno, 73b Meno proposes to Socrates that the \\"capacity to govern men\\" may be a virtue common to all people. Socrates points out to the slaveholder that \\"governing well\\" cannot be a virtue of a slave, because then he would not be a slave.Plato, Meno, 73c‚Äìd One of the errors that Socrates points out is that Meno lists many particular virtues without defining a common feature inherent to virtues which makes them thus. Socrates remarks that Meno makes many out of one, like somebody who breaks a plate.Plato, Meno, 77a Meno proposes that virtue is the desire for good things and the power to get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem‚Äîmany people do not recognize evil.Plato, Meno, 77d‚Äìe The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for the fact that so many people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether good things must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good.Plato, Meno, 78b Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many. No satisfactory definition of virtue emerges in the Meno. Socrates' comments, however, show that he considers a successful definition to be unitary, rather than a list of varieties of virtue, that it must contain all and only those terms which are genuine instances of virtue, and must not be circular.Day, Jane Mary. 1994. Plato's Meno in Focus. Routledge. p. 19. . =Meno's paradox= Meno asks Socrates:Plato, Meno (translated by B. Jowett 1871).Plato. [380 BC] 1976. Meno, translated by G. M. A. Grube. Indianapolis: Hackett. line 80d, p. 9. > And how will you enquire, Socrates, into that which you do not know? What > will you put forth as the subject of enquiry? And if you find what you want, > how will you ever know that this is the thing which you did not know? Socrates rephrases the question, which has come to be the canonical statement of the paradox:Plato. [380 BC] 1976. Meno, translated by G. M. A. Grube. Indianapolis: Hackett. line 80e: > \\"[A] man cannot search either for what he knows or for what he does not > know; He cannot search for what he knows--since he knows it, there is no > need to search--nor for what he does not know, for he does not know what to > look for.\\" =Dialogue with Meno's slave= Socrates responds to this sophistical paradox with a mythos ('narrative' or 'fiction') according to which souls are immortal and have learned everything prior to transmigrating into the human body. Since the soul has had contact with real things prior to birth, we have only to 'recollect' them when alive. Such recollection requires Socratic questioning, which according to Socrates is not teaching. Socrates demonstrates his method of questioning and recollection by interrogating a slave who is ignorant of geometry. Socrates begins one of the most influential dialogues of Western philosophy regarding the argument for inborn knowledge. By drawing geometric figures in the ground Socrates demonstrates that the slave is initially unaware of the length that a side must be in order to double the area of a square with 2-foot sides. The slave guesses first that the original side must be doubled in length (4 feet), and when this proves too much, that it must be 3 feet. This is still too much, and the slave is at a loss. Socrates claims that before he got hold of him the slave (who has been picked at random from Meno's entourage) might have thought he could speak \\"well and fluently\\" on the subject of a square double the size of a given square.Plato, Meno, 84c Socrates comments that this \\"numbing\\" he caused in the slave has done him no harm and has even benefited him.Plato, Meno, 84b Socrates then draws a second square figure using the diagonal of the original square. Each diagonal cuts each two foot square in half, yielding an area of two square feet. The square composed of four of the eight interior triangular areas is eight square feet, double that of the original area. He gets the slave to agree that this is twice the size of the original square and says that he has \\"spontaneously recovered\\" knowledge he knew from a past lifePlato, Meno, 85d without having been taught. Socrates is satisfied that new beliefs were \\"newly aroused\\" in the slave. After witnessing the example with the slave boy, Meno tells Socrates that he thinks that Socrates is correct in his theory of recollection, to which Socrates agrees:Plato, Meno, 86b =Anytus= Meno now beseeches Socrates to return to the original question, how virtue is acquired, and in particular, whether or not it is acquired by teaching or through life experience. Socrates proceeds on the hypothesis that virtue is knowledge, and it is quickly agreed that, if this is true, virtue is teachable. They turn to the question of whether virtue is indeed knowledge. Socrates is hesitant, because, if virtue were knowledge, there should be teachers and learners of it, but there are none. Coincidentally Anytus appears, whom Socrates praises as the son of Anthemion, who earned his fortune with intelligence and hard work. He says that Anthemion had his son well-educated and so Anytus is well- suited to join the investigation. Socrates suggests that the sophists are teachers of virtue. Anytus is horrified, saying that he neither knows any, nor cares to know any. Socrates then questions why it is that men do not always produce sons of the same virtue as themselves. He alludes to other notable male figures, such as Themistocles, Aristides, Pericles and Thucydides, and casts doubt on whether these men produced sons as capable of virtue as themselves. Anytus becomes offended and accuses Socrates of slander, warning him to be careful expressing such opinions. (The historical Anytus was one of Socrates' accusers in his trial.) Socrates suggests that Anytus does not realize what slander is, and continues his dialogue with Meno as to the definition of virtue. =True belief and knowledge= After the discussion with Anytus, Socrates returns to quizzing Meno for his own thoughts on whether the sophists are teachers of virtue and whether virtue can be taught. Meno is again at a loss, and Socrates suggests that they have made a mistake in agreeing that knowledge is required for virtue. He points out the similarities and differences between \\"true belief\\" and \\"knowledge\\". True beliefs are as useful to us as knowledge, but they often fail to \\"stay in their place\\" and must be \\"tethered\\" by what he calls aitias ('calculation of reason' or 'reasoned explanation'), immediately adding that this is anamnesis, or recollection.Vlastos, Gregory. 1996. Studies in Greek Philosophy: Socrates, Plato, and Their Tradition 2. Princeton University Press. . p. 155. Whether or not Plato intends that the tethering of true beliefs with reasoned explanations must always involve anamnesis is explored in later interpretations of the text.Fine, Gail. 1992. \\"Inquiry in the 'Meno'.\\" In The Cambridge Companion to Plato, edited by R. Kraut. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. . p. 221.Kahn, Charles. 2006. \\"Plato on Recollection.\\" In A Companion to Plato 37, edited by H. H. Benson. Wiley-Blackwell. . p. 122. Socrates' distinction between \\"true belief\\" and \\"knowledge\\" forms the basis of the philosophical definition of knowledge as \\"justified true belief\\". Myles Burnyeat and others, however, have argued that the phrase aitias logismos refers to a practical working out of a solution, rather than a justification.Fine, Gail. 2004. \\"Knowledge and True Belief in the Meno.\\" Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy 27(winter): 61‚Äì62, edited by D. Sedley. . Socrates concludes that, in the virtuous people of the present and the past, at least, virtue has been the result of divine inspiration, akin to the inspiration of the poets, whereas a knowledge of it will require answering the basic question, what is virtue?. In most modern readings these closing remarks are \\"evidently ironic,\\"Waterfield, Robin. 2005. Meno and Other Dialogues, (Oxford World Classics). Oxford University Press. . pxliv. but Socrates' invocation of the gods may be sincere, albeit \\"highly tentative.\\"Scott, Dominic. 2006. Plato's 'Meno'. Cambridge University Press. p 193. . This passage in the Meno is often seen as the first statement of the problem of the value of knowledge: how is knowledge more valuable than mere true belief?Pritchard, Duncan, John Turri, and J. Adam Carter. [2007] 2018. \\"The Value of Knowledge\\" (revised). The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Meno and Protagoras Meno theme is also dealt with in the dialogue Protagoras, where Plato ultimately has Socrates arrive at the opposite conclusion: virtue can be taught. Likewise, while in Protagoras knowledge is uncompromisingly this-worldly, in Meno the theory of recollection points to a link between knowledge and eternal truths.

Written and directed by Billy Ray, the film is based on a 1998 Vanity Fair article of the same name by H. G. Bissinger and chronicles Glass' fall from grace when his stories were discovered to be fabricated. It stars Hayden Christensen as Glass, alongside Peter Sarsgaard, Chlo√´ Sevigny, and Steve Zahn.Why All Journalists Should Watch Shattered Glass - Plagiarism Today The film premiered at the 2003 Toronto International Film FestivalDer Spiegel Fires Journalist After Fabricated Articles ‚Äî Deadline on August 10, 2003 and received a North American limited release on November 26, 2003. Despite being a commercial failure, Shattered Glass received highly positive reviews from critics, with particular praise for Christensen's and Sarsgaard's performances. Plot Stephen Glass is a reporter at The New Republic, where he has made a name for himself for writing colorful stories. His editor Michael Kelly is revered by the magazine's young staff. When David Keene (at the time Chairman of the American Conservative Union) questions Glass's description of minibars and the drunken antics of Young Republicans at a convention, Kelly backs his reporter when Glass admits to one mistake but says the rest is true. Kelly is fired after he stands up to his boss Marty Peretz on an unrelated personnel issue, and fellow writer Charles \\"Chuck\\" Lane is promoted as a replacement. The magazine publishes an entertaining story by Glass titled \\"Hack Heaven\\" about Ian Restil, a teenage hacker who was given a lucrative job at software company Jukt Micronics after hacking into its computer system. After the article is published, Forbes Digital Tool reporter Adam Penenberg begins researching the story in order to discover how Glass scooped everyone else; Penenberg is unable to uncover any corroborating evidence for Glass's story. Questioned by the Forbes reporter, Lane becomes suspicious when Glass cannot provide sources for his article and when the few pieces of concrete evidence are discovered to be an amateurish website representing Jukt Micronics and a Palo Alto phone number with only one phone line where every call goes directly to voicemail. Penenberg and his colleague Andy Fox can find no proof Jukt or any of the people mentioned in the story exist: Restil, Jukt president George Sims, former NBA agent Joe Hiert, and Nevada law enforcement official Jim Ghort. Lane drives Glass to the convention center where the hacker convention supposedly took place. When Lane asks a security guard for help, he learns the convention center was not open that day. Lane also discovers that the restaurant where the hackers supposedly ate dinner afterwards closes in the early afternoon. After haphazardly trying to defend himself, Glass finally \\"admits\\" to Lane that he wasn't actually at the hacker convention, but relied on sources for information and pretended he was there to give the article a first-person feel. Lane is outraged, but proceeds cautiously while seeking the truth. He suspends Glass, earning him the enmity of staff reporters who all are fond of Glass. Caitlin Avey is so angered by Lane's actions that she considers quitting. When a fellow staff member calls Lane, expressing concern for Glass's state of mind, he mentions that Glass has a brother living in Palo Alto. Lane realizes the brother must have posed as Sims on the day he returned Lane's phone call. Glass pleads for another chance, but Lane orders him out of the office and takes his security access card. Searching through back issues of The New Republic, Lane realizes that much of Glass's previous work was falsified. When an emotional Glass returns, Lane fires him. Caitlin accuses Lane of wanting to get rid of everyone who was loyal to Kelly, but he challenges her to act like the good reporter she is. He reminds her that half of the falsified stories were published on Kelly's watch after being fact- checked, and that the entire staff will have to apologize to their readers for allowing Glass to continue to hand in fictitious stories. The following day, a receptionist wryly remarks to Lane that all this trouble could have been averted if the stories required photographs, which Lane had argued against putting in the magazine. Lane discovers the staff has written an apology to their readers. They spontaneously applaud their editor, signifying their unity. At a meeting with Lane and a lawyer, Glass tacitly admits that 27 of the 41 articles he wrote for The New Republic were fabricated in whole or in part. An epilogue reveals that Glass decided to complete law school and wrote a novel called The Fabulist about a reporter who fabricates his stories, and that Kelly was killed in Iraq while covering Operation Iraqi Freedom. The film is dedicated to his memory.

Bissinger's Vanity Fair magazine article about Stephen Glass for an HBO original movie. They hired screenwriter Billy Ray based on the script he had written for the TNT film Legalese. Ray grew up with Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as his heroes and studied journalism for a year. It was this love for journalism that motivated him to make Shattered Glass. A sudden change in management put the film into turnaround and it remained inactive for two years until Cruise/Wagner Productions bought it from HBO. They took it to Lionsgate and Ray asked the studio if he could direct in addition to writing it. The challenge for Ray was to make the subject matter watchable because, according to the filmmaker, \\"watching people write is deadly dull ... in a film like this, dialogue is what a character is willing to reveal about himself, and the camera is there to capture everything else\\". The breakthrough for Ray came when he realized that the film's real protagonist was not Glass but Chuck Lane. According to Ray, \\"as fascinating as Stephen Glass is by the end of the movie people would want to kill themselves ‚Äì you just can't follow him all the way\\". He used the Bissinger article as a starting point, which gave him a line of dialogue on which to hook the entire character of Glass: \\"Are you mad at me?\\" According to Ray, \\"you can build an entire character around that notion, and we did\\". To prepare for the film, Ray interviewed and re-interviewed key figures for any relevant details. He signed some of them as paid consultants and gave several approval over the script. Early on, he spent a considerable amount of time trying to earn the trust of the people who had worked with Glass and get them to understand that he was going to be objective with the subject matter. The real Michael Kelly was so unhappy about how he was portrayed in Bissinger's article that he threatened to sue when Ray first contacted him about the film and refused for two years to read Ray's script, which he eventually approved. Ray attempted to contact Glass through his lawyers but was unsuccessful. Lionsgate lawyers asked Ray to give them an annotated script where he had to footnote every line of dialogue and every assertion and back them up with corresponding notes. The night before principal photography began in Montreal, Ray screened All the President's Men for the cast and crew. He shot both halves of the film differently ‚Äì in the first half, he used hand-held cameras in the scenes that took place in the offices of The New Republic, but when the Forbes editors begin to question Glass, the camerawork was more stable. Ray's original cut of the film was a much more straightforward account of events but while editing the film he realized that it was not good enough. He raised additional funds to shoot the high school scenes that bookend the film. On April 3, 2003, a little more than six months before the film was released, Michael Kelly was killed while reporting on the invasion of Iraq. The film is dedicated to his memory. Release Shattered Glass premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Telluride Film Festival, the Boston Film Festival, the Woodstock Film Festival, the Mill Valley Film Festival, and the Austin Film Festival before opening on eight screens in New York City and Los Angeles on October 31, 2003. It grossed $77,540 on its opening weekend. It eventually earned $2,220,008 in North America and $724,744 in other markets for a total worldwide box office of $2,944,752. =Critical reception= The film received positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 91% \\"Certified Fresh\\" rating, based on 172 reviews, with an average rating of 7.68/10. The site's consensus states: \\"A compelling look at Stephen Glass' fall from grace.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 73 out of 100, based on 38 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times described the film as \\"a serious, well-observed examination of the practice of journalism,\\" and \\"an astute and surprisingly gripping drama.\\" He added, \\"A more showily ambitious film might have tried to delve into Glass's personal history in search of an explanation for his behavior, or to draw provocative connections between that behavior and the cultural and political climate of the times. Such a movie would also have been conventional, facile and ultimately false. Mr. Ray knows better than to sensationalize a story about the dangers of sensationalism. Shattered Glass is good enough to be true\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and felt the film was well-cast and \\"deserves comparison with All the President's Men among movies about journalism\\". In a dissenting review from The Village Voice, J. Hoberman dismissed the film as \\"self-important yet insipid,\\" and asks, \\"Shattered Glass begs a larger question: What sort of culture elevates Glass for his entertainment value, punishes him for being too entertaining, rewards his notoriety, and then resurrects him again as a moral object lesson?\\" Sarsgaard's performance as Charles Lane was singled out by several critics for praise. USA Today gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote of him: \\"Sarsgaard deserves more credit than he'll probably get for his multi- layered performance\\". Premieres Glenn Kenny wrote, \\"it's Peter Sarsgaard, as the editor who serves Glass his just desserts [sic], who walks away with the picture, metamorphosing his character's stiffness into a moral indignation that's jolting and, finally, invigorating\\". His performance ended up winning numerous awards, including \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" citations from the Boston Society of Film Critics, Kansas City Film Critics Circle, National Society of Film Critics, Online Film Critics Society, San Francisco Film Critics Circle, and the Toronto Film Critics Association, as well as nominations from the Independent Spirit Awards and the Golden Globes. The A.V. Club placed his portrayal of Chuck Lane at number six on a list of the best performances of the decade. Stephen Glass saw the film and, when reflecting about the experience, he said, \\"It was very painful for me. It was like being on a guided tour of the moments of my life I am most ashamed of\\".

Mellon Financial Corporation was one of the world's largest money management firms. Based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, it was in the business of institutional and high-net-worth individual asset management, including the Dreyfus family of mutual funds, business banking, and shareholder and investor services. On December 4, 2006, it announced a merger agreement with Bank of New York, to form The Bank of New York Mellon. After regulatory and shareholder approval, the banks completed the merger on July 2, 2007.  History  Mellon was founded in 1869 by Thomas Mellon and his sons Andrew W. Mellon and Richard B. Mellon, as T. Mellon & Sons' Bank. In 1902, the institution became Mellon National Bank. Mellon Bank was an important force in the mass production revolution in the United States, especially in the Midwest. The Mellon family using the bank as a proxy had direct involvement with founding the modern aluminium, oil, consumer electronics and financial industries. Alcoa, Gulf Oil (now Chevron-Texaco), Westinghouse (now CBS Corporation and Siemens) and Rockwell, all were directly founded and managed by the bank. U.S. Steel (the world's first billion dollar corporation), Heinz, General Motors, Koppers and ExxonMobil (as Rockefeller's Standard Oil) were born and nurtured by Mellon. In 1920, Andrew left his leadership post of the bank to become the longest serving U.S. Treasury Secretary in history (serving under three separate administrations). In 1929, Richard founded Mellbank Corporation. In 1946, Mellon National, Mellbank, and the Union Trust Company merged to form Mellon National Bank and Trust Company. A reorganization in 1972 brought about a name change to Mellon Bank, N.A. and the formation of a holding company, Mellon National Corporation. In 1983, Mellon bought Girard Bank of Philadelphia and Central Counties Bank of State College, Pennsylvania. The next year, Mellon National Corporation became Mellon Bank Corporation, and purchased Northwest Pennsylvania Corporation of Oil City, Pennsylvania. In 1986, Mellon bought Commonwealth National Financial of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It is also reported that Mellon operated the 2nd largest financial computing system in the world. In 1991, Mellon bought United Penn Bank of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. The next year, Mellon bought 54 branch offices of Philadelphia- based Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, whose parent company had become insolvent. Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, was the first savings bank in the United States, founded in 1819. The Boston Company logo, ca 1993, acquired by Mellon In 1993, Mellon bought The Boston Company from American Express and AFCO Credit Corporation from The Continental Corporation. The next year, Mellon merged with the Dreyfus Corporation, bringing its mutual funds under its umbrella. 1998 saw Mellon's purchase of United Bankshares, Inc., of Miami, 1st Business Bank of Los Angeles, and Founders Asset Management. In 1999, Martin G. McGuinn became chairman and chief executive officer of Mellon Bank Corporation. Mellon Bank Corporation then became Mellon Financial Corporation. Two years later, it sold its retail banking operations to Citizens Financial Group. In 2004, Mellon announced it would purchase Safeco Trust Company from Seattle-based Safeco Corporation. The same year, it purchased outstanding shares in London-based Pareto Partners and offered them floor space in Mellon Financial Centre (opened earlier in the year). In February 2020, Mellon announced that it has successfully onboarded Liontrust Asset Management to its new Investment Operations platform. Merger with Bank of New York In 2006, Mellon announced its plans to merge with Bank of New York. Talks began when Tom Renyi approached Robert Kelly about a possible amalgamation between the Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation. The $16.5 billion deal ($ billion today) was announced in December 2006 and finalized on July 1, 2007, with Kelly as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the new company, and Renyi as Executive Chairman. Per the deal, the new Board of Directors is composed of ten directors appointed by the Bank of New York, and eight by Mellon. The merger was completed July 1, 2007, as The Bank of New York Mellon. Headquartered in New York, it is the world's largest securities servicing firm and one of the world's top ten asset managing firms. The new venture launched its brand identity on October 1, 2007. These two companies, along with State Street, followed essentially the same evolution. All were originally large diversified financial service providers, particularly in the corporate banking space in the regions they were located in. However, competition in the corporate loans and retail banking businesses saw them jettison these operations in favor of what were believed to be more stable, fee based business: asset management (i.e. investment management in the form of mutual funds and other separately managed accounts) and asset servicing (i.e. corporate trust, stock transfer services and depository receipts). Mellon is a large provider of what are known as controlled disbursement accounts. These are checking accounts in specialized locations which are given early warning by the Federal Reserve as to what checks will be clearing them. Companies can then transfer the exact amount needed to pay those checks, while then investing the unneeded money or using other funds to pay down debt. Mellon Bank CEOs * Robert E.

It incorporates 21st-century information and communications technology to promote democracy; such technologies include civic technology and government technology. It is a form of government in which all adult citizens are presumed to be eligible to participate equally in the proposal, development and creation of laws. E-democracy encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self- determination. According to Sharique Hassan Manazir, digital inclusion is an inherent necessity of an e-democracy. Goals =Human rights= The spread of free information through the internet has encouraged freedom and human development. The internet is used for promoting human rights‚Äîincluding free speech, religion, expression, peaceful assembly, government accountability, and the right of knowledge and understanding‚Äîthat support democracy. An e-democracy process has been recently proposed in a scientific article for solving a question that has crucial importance for all humans in the 21st century: \\"As planet Earth citizens, will you stop the climate from warming?\\" The author proposes to use a cell-phone for answering this question during the Olympic Games in Pyeongchang 2018 and Tokyo 2020. =Expanding democracy= The Internet has several attributes that encourage thinking about it as a democratic medium. The lack of centralized control makes censorship difficult. There are other parallels in the social design in the early days of the internet, such as the strongly libertarian support for free speech, the sharing culture that permeated nearly all aspects of Internet use, and the outright prohibition on commercial use by the National Science Foundation. Another example is the unmediated mass communication on the internet, such as through newsgroups, chat rooms, and MUDs. This communication ignored the boundaries established with broadcast media, such as newspapers or radio, and with one-to-one media, such as letters or landline telephones. Finally, because the Internet is a massive digital network with open standards, universal and inexpensive access to a wide variety of communication media and models could actually be attained.Novak, T., & Hoffman, D. (1998). Bridging the Digital Divide: The Impact of Race on Computer Access and Internet Use. Nashville: Vanderbilt University. Some practical issues involving e-democracy include: effective participation; voting equality at decision stage; enlightened understanding; control of the agenda; and inclusiveness. Systemic issues may include cyber-security concerns and protection of sensitive data from third parties. =Improving Democracy= Modern democracies are generally representative democracies, where citizens elect representatives to manage the creation and implementation of laws, policies, and regulations on their behalf, in contrast to direct democracies in which citizens retain that responsibility. They may be referred to as more or less \\"democratic\\" depending on how well the government represents the will or interest of the people. A shift to e-democracy would in effect devolve political power from elected representatives to the individual. In America, politics have become reliant on the Internet because the Internet is the primary source of information for most Americans. The Internet educates people on democracy, helping people stay up to date with what is happening in their government. Online advertising is becoming more popular for political candidates and group's opinions on propositions. For many the Internet is often the primary resource for information. The reason for this, and especially among younger voters, is that it is easy and reliable when used correctly, thus lowering an individual's workload. The innate usability of search engines, such as Google, results in increased citizen engagement with research and political issues. Social networks allow people to express their opinions about the government through an alias, anonymously and judgment-free.Oral, Beh√ßet(2008). \\"Computers & Education: The evaluation of the student teachers' attitudes toward the Internet and democracy.\\" Dicle University, Volume 50, Issue 1: 437-445. Due to the Internets' size and decentralized structure, any individual has the potential to go viral and gain influence over a large number of others. The Internet enables citizens to get and post information about politicians, and it allows those politicians to get advice from the people in larger numbers. This collective decision making and problem-solving gives more power to the citizens and helps politicians make decisions faster. This creates a more productive society that can handle problems faster and more efficiently. Getting feedback and advice from the American population is a large part of a politician's job and the Internet allows them to function effectively with larger numbers of people's opinions. With this heightened ability to communicate with the public, the American government is able to function more capably and effectively as a Democracy. The American election of 2016 is an example, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton made good use of Twitter, attempting to shape perceptions on their behalf, whilst using social media to transmit the idea that authorities are also 'normal', and they can communicate through a Twitter account just like everyone does. In other words, nowadays, any ordinary person can research on political causes and events at any time just by searching something on Google. Also, the various different forms of sharing one's political beliefs through interactive chats and online posts on social media, such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, connects people who part one's same views (Sarwar & Soomro, 2013, pp. 216‚Äì226) Generation X became disillusioned that even large-scale public protests such as the UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985) were seen to fail a decade before information technology became generally available to individual citizens. E-democracy is sometimes seen as a remedy to the insular nature, concentrated power, and lack of post- election accountability in traditional democratic process organized mostly around political parties. Tom Watson, the Deputy Leader of the UK Labour Party, said: > It feels like the Labour frontbench is further away from our members than at > any point in our history and the digital revolution can help bring the party > closer together ... I'm going to ask our NEC to see whether we can have > digital branches and digital delegates to the conference. Not replacing what > we do but providing an alternative platform. It's a way of organising for a > different generation of people who do their politics differently, get their > news differently. =Digital Inclusion= Digital Inclusion is essential for citizen participation in public policy formulation for a healthy Digital Democracy through equal participation of all section of society in any democracy irrespective of citizen's income level, education level, gender, religion, color, race, language used, physical and mental health etc. Any public policy formulated without including any specific section of society will always remain non-inclusive by nature which will go against the ethos of democracy. Effects \\"E-democracy offers greater electronic community access to political processes and policy choices. E-democracy development is connected to complex internal factors, such as political norms and citizen pressures\\" and in general to the particular model of democracy implemented. E-democracy is therefore highly influenced by both internal factors to a country and by the external factors of standard innovation and diffusion theory. People are pressuring their public officials to adopt more policies that other states or countries have regarding information and news about their government online. People have all governmental information at their fingertips and easy access to contact their government officials. In this new generation where internet and networking rule everyone's daily lives, it is more convenient that people can be informed of the government and policies through this form of communication. E-democracy has, in fact, endorsed a better and faster political information exchange, public argumentation and involvement in decision-making (Djik, 2006, pp. 126). Social media has become an empowerment tool, especially for the youth, who are encouraged to participate in elections. Social media has also allowed the politicians to interact with civilians. A clear example was the 2016 American elections and how Donald Trump tweeted most of his announcements and goals. Not only Trump, but other presidents have Twitter accounts such as Justin Trudeau, Jair Bolsonaro, and Hassan Rouhani. Moreover, some people genuinely believe that the government posting public information online makes them more vulnerable and therefore more evident in people's eyes, which favors the public's surveillance. Thus, distributing power among society. In Jane Fountain's (2001) Building the Virtual State, she describes how this widespread e-democracy is able to connect with so many people and correlates it to the government we had before. > Fountain's framework provides a subtle and nuanced appreciation of the > interplay of preexisting norms, procedures, and rules within bureaucracies > and how these affect the introduction of new technological forms... In its > most radical guise, this form of e- government would entail a radical > overhaul of the modern administrative state as regular electronic > consultations involving elected politicians, civil servants, pressure > groups, and other affected interests become standard practice in all stages > of the policy process (Sage). Cities in states with Republican-controlled legislatures, high legislative professionalization, and more active professional networks were more likely to embrace e-government and e-democracy. =Occupy movement= Following the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì08 a number of social networks proposed demonstrations such as the Occupy movement. =15-M movement= The 15-M Movement started in Spain and spread to other European countries. From that emerged the Partido X (X Party) proposals in Spain. =Arab Spring= During the \\"Arab Spring,\\" online activists led uprisings in a dozen countries across North Africa and the Middle East. At first, digital media allowed pro- democracy movements to use the internet against authoritarian regimes; however, these regimes eventually worked social media into their own counter- insurgency strategies. Digital media helped to turn individualized, localized, and community-specific dissent into structured movements with a collective consciousness about both shared grievances and opportunities for action.\\"The Role of Digital Media\\", Philip N. Howard, Muzammil M. Hussain. Journal of Democracy, Volume 22, Number 3, July 2011.pp. 35-48 10.1353/jod.2011.0041 (Abstract) Egyptian Revolution On 25 January 2011, mass protests began in Cairo, Egypt, protesting the long reign of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, the high unemployment rate, government corruption, poverty, and oppression within society. This 18-day revolution did not begin with guns, violence, or protests, but rather with the creation of a single Facebook page which quickly gained the attention of thousands, and soon millions, of Egyptians, spreading into a global phenomenon. The internet empowered protesters and allowed for anyone with access to the internet be involved in the democratization process of their government. In order to have a democratic, free nation, all information that can be shared, should be shared. Protestors communicated, organized, and collaborated through the use of this technology with real time, real impacts. Technologies played an enormous role on the world stage during this time. Even when the regime eliminated all access to the Internet in a failed attempt to halt further political online forums, Google and Twitter teamed up, making a system that would get information out to the public without having access to the internet. The interactivity of media during this revolution boosted civic participation and played a monumental role in the political outcome of the revolution and the democratization of an entire nation. The revolution in Egypt has been understood by some as an example of a broader trend of transforming from a system based on group control to one of \\"networked individualism\\". These networked societies are constructed post -\\"triple revolution\\" of technology, which involves a three-step process. Step one in the \\"triple revolution\\" is \\"the turn to social networks\\", step two: \\"the proliferation of the far-flung, instantaneous internet\\", and step three: \\"the even wider proliferation of always-available mobile phones\\". These elements play a key role in change through the Internet. Such technologies provide an alternative sphere that is unregulated by the government, and where construction of ideas and protests can foster without regulation. For example, In Egypt, the \\"6 April Youth Movement\\" established their political group on Facebook where they called for a national strike to occur on 6 April. This event was ultimately suppressed, however; the Facebook group remained, spurring the growth of other activist parties to take an online media route. The Internet in Egypt was used also to form connections with networks of people outside of their own country. The connections provided through Internet media sources, such as Twitter allowed rapid spread of the revolt to be known around the world. Specifically, more than 3 million tweets contained six popular hashtags alluring to the revolt, for example, #Egypt and #sidibouzid; further enabling the spread of knowledge and change in Egypt. =Kony 2012= The Invisible Children's Kony 2012 video was released 5 March 2012, initiating an online grassroots campaign for the search and arrest of Joseph Kony. Invisible Children, the non-profit organization responsible for this video campaign, was founded on the mission to bring awareness to the vile actions of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), located in Central Africa, and the arrest of its leader, Joseph Kony. In the video, Jason Russell, one of the founders of Invisible Children, says that \\"the problem is that 99% of the planet doesn't know who [Kony] is\\" and the only way to stop him is by having enough support from the people to convince the government to continue the hunt for him. So, Invisible Children's purpose for the video was to raise awareness by making Kony famous through the ever- expanding market of social media and to use the technology we have today to bring his crimes to light. On 21 March 2012, a group of 33 Senators introduced a resolution condemning \\"the crimes against humanity\\" committed by Joseph Kony and the LRA. The resolution supports the continued efforts by the US government to \\"strengthen the capabilities of regional military forces deployed to protect civilians and pursue commanders of the LRA, and calls for cross-border efforts to increase civilian protection and provide assistance to populations affected by the LRA.\\" Senator Lindsey Graham, a co-sponsor of the resolution stated that \\"When you get 100 million Americans looking at something, you will get our attention. This YouTube sensation is gonna help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined\\". =India Against Corruption 2011-12= India Against Corruption (IAC) is an anti-corruption movement in India which was particularly prominent during the anti-corruption protests of 2011 and 2012, the central point of which was debate concerning the introduction of a Jan Lokpal bill. During that time it sought to mobilize the masses in support of their demands for a less corrupt society in India. Divisions amongst key members of the IAC's core committee eventually led to a split within the movement. Arvind Kejriwal left to form the Aam Aadmi Party, while Anna Hazare left to form Jantantra Morcha. =Long March (Pakistan)= In December 2012, after living for seven years in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Qadri returned to Pakistan and initiated a political campaign. Qadri called for a \\"million-men\\" march in Islamabad to protest against the government's corruption. On 14 January 2013, a crowd marched down the city's main avenue. Thousands of people pledged to sit-in until their demands were met. When he started the long march from Lahore about 25,000 people were with him. He told the rally in front of parliament: \\"There is no Parliament; there is a group of looters, thieves and dacoits [bandits] ... Our lawmakers are the lawbreakers.\\". After four days of sit-in, the Government and Qadri signed an agreement called the Islamabad Long March Declaration, which promised electoral reforms and increased political transparency. Although Qadri called for a \\"million-men\\" march, the estimated total present for the sit-in in Islamabad was 50,000 according to the government. =Five Star Movement (Italy)= In 2012, the rising Five Star Movement (M5S), in Italy, chose its candidates to Italian and European elections through online voting by registered members of Beppe Grillo's blog. Through an application called Rousseau reachable on the web, the registered users of M5S discuss, approve or reject legislative proposals (submitted then in the Parliament by the M5S group). For example, the M5S electoral law was shaped through a series of online votes, like the name of the M5S candidate for President of the Republic in Italy. The choice to support the abolition of a law against immigrants was taken online by members of the M5S even if the final decision was against the opinions of Grillo and Casaleggio. The partnership with the UK Independence Party was also decided by online voting, although the given options for the choice of European Parliament group for M5S were limited to Europe of Freedom and Democracy (EFD), European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and \\"Stay independent\\" (Non-Inscrits). The option of joining the Greens/EFA group was discussed, but this option was not available at the time of the voting due to that group's prior rejection of the M5S. When the Conte I Cabinet broke down, a new coalition between Democratic Party and MS5 was approved after 100,000 members voted, with 79.3% approving the new coalition. Requirements E-Democracy is made possible through its role in relevancy of participation, the social construction of inclusiveness, sensitivity to the individual, and flexibility in participation. The Internet provides a sense of relevancy in participation through allowing everyone's voice to be heard and expressed. A structure of social inclusion is also provided through a wide variety of Internet sites, groups, and social networks, all representing different viewpoints and ideas. Sensitivity to the individual's needs is accomplished through the ability to express individual opinions publicly and rapidly. Finally, the Internet is an extremely flexible area of participation; it is low in cost and widely available to the public. Through these four directions, e-Democracy and the implementation of the Internet are able to play an active role in societal change. =Internet access= The e-democratic process is hindered by the digital divide between active participants and those who do not participate in electronic communities. Advocates of e-democracy may advocate government moves to close this gap. The disparity e-governance and e-democracy between developed and developing worlds has been attributed to the digital divide. Practical objections include the digital divide between those with access and those without, as well as the opportunity cost of expenditure on e-democracy innovations. There is also skepticism of the amount of impact that they can make through online participation. =Security and the protection of privacy= The government must be in a position to guarantee that online communications are secure and that they do not violate people's privacy. This is especially important when considering electronic voting. An electoral voting system is more complex than other electronic transaction systems and the authentication mechanisms employed must be able to prevent ballot rigging or the threat of rigging. This may include the use of smart cards that allow a voter's identity to be verified whilst at the same time ensuring the privacy of the vote cast. Electronic voting in Estonia is one example of a method to conquer the privacy-identity problem inherent in internet voting systems. However, the objective should be to provide equivalence with the security and privacy of current manual systems. =Government responsiveness= In order to attract people to get involved in online consultations and discussions, the government must respond to people and actively demonstrate that there is a relationship between the citizen's engagement and policy outcome. It is also important that people are able to become involved in the process, at a time and place that is convenient to them but when their opinions will count. The government will need to ensure that the structures are in place to deal with increased participation. In order to ensure that issues are debated in a democratic, inclusive, tolerant and productive way, the role that intermediaries and representative organizations may play should be considered. In order to strengthen the effectiveness of the existing legal rights of access to information held by public authorities, citizens should have the right to effective public deliberation and moderation.Waller Livesey Edin (2001) Types of interaction 3D e-democracy roadmap: transcending the trade-offs E-democracy has the potential to overcome the traditional trade-off between the size of the group that participates in the democratic process and the depth of the will expression (see Figure). Traditionally, large group size was achieved with simple ballot voting, whereas the depth of the will expression was limited to predefined options (what's on the ballot), while depth of will expression was achieved by limiting the number of participants through representative democracy (see Table). The social media Web 2.0 revolution has shown to achieve both, large group sizes and depth of will expression, but the will expressions in social media are not structured and it is difficult (and often subjective) to make sense of them (see Table). New information processing techniques, including big data analytics and the semantic web have shown ways to make use of these possibilities for the implementation of future forms of e-democracy. For now, the process of e-democracy is carried out by technologies such as electronic mailing lists, peer-to-peer networks, collaborative software and apps like GovernEye, Countable, VoteSpotter, wikis, Internet forums and blogs. Forms of democracy trade-off table E-democracy has been analyzed with regard to the different stages of the democratic process, such as \\"information provision, deliberation, and participation in decision-making.\\", by the hierarchical level of government, including local communities, states/regions, nations and on the global stage and by its reach and scope of involvement, such as the involvement of citizens/voters, the media, elected officials, political organizations, and governments.Clift, S. (2004). E-Democracy Resource Links from Steven Clift - E-Government, E-Politics, E-Voting Links and more. Retrieved 10 July 2009, from Publicus.Ne-t Public Strategies for the Online World: Publicus.net As such, \\"its development is conditioned by such pervasive changes as increased interdependency, technological multimediation, partnership governance, and individualism.\\" Social media sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, WordPress and Blogspot, are playing an increasingly important role in democratic deliberations.Is Facebook keeping you in a political bubble? http://news.sciencemag.org/social-sciences/2015/05/facebook- keeping-you-political-bubble The role of social media in e-democracy has been an emerging area for e-democracy, as well as related technological developments, such as argument maps and eventually, the semantic web. free access to the article can be found here martinhilbert.net/e-democracyHilbertJITP.pdf Another related development consists in combining the open communication of social networking with the structured communication of closed panels including experts and/or policy- makers, such as for example through modified versions of the Delphi method (HyperDelphi) to combine the open communication of self-organized virtual communities with the structured communication of closed panels, including members of the policy-community.. A summary of Democrazia elettronica is also in , chap. 23. This approach addresses the question of how, in electronic democracy, to reconcile distributed knowledge and self-organized memories with critical control, responsibility and decision. The social networking entry point, for example, is within the citizens' environment, and the engagement is on the citizens' terms. Proponents of e-government perceive government use of social networks as a medium to help government act more like the public it serves. Examples of state usage can be found at The Official Commonwealth of Virginia Homepage, where citizens can find Google tools and open social forums. Those are seen as important stepping stones in the maturation of the concept of e-democracy. =Civic engagement= Civic engagement includes three dimensions: political knowledge of public affairs, political trust for the political system, and political participation in influencing the government and the decision-making process. The internet aids civic engagement by providing a new avenue to interact with governmental institutions. Proponents of e-democracy believe that governments can be much more actively engaged than presently, and encourage citizens to take their own initiative to influence decisions that will affect them. Many studies report increasing use of the internet to find political information. Between 1996 and 2002, the number of adults who reported that the internet was significant in their choices increased from about 14 to 20 percent. In 2002, nearly a quarter of the population reported having visited a website to research specific public policy issues. Studies have shown that more people visit websites that challenge their point of view than visit websites that mirror their own opinions. Sixteen percent of the population has participated in online political culture by interacting with political websites through joining campaigns, volunteering time, donating money, or participating in polls. According to a survey conducted by Philip N. Howard, almost two-thirds of the adult population in the United States has had some online experience with political news, information, or other content over the past four election cycles. They tend to reference the websites of special interest groups more than the websites of specific elected leaders, political candidates, political parties, nonpartisan groups, and local community groups. The information capacity available on the Internet allows citizens to become more knowledgeable about government and political issues, and the interactivity of the medium allows for new forms of communication with government, i.e. elected officials and/or public servants. The posting of contact information, legislation, agendas, and policies makes government more transparent, potentially enabling more informed participation both online and offline. According to Matt Leighninger, the internet impacts government in two main ways, empowering individuals, and empowering groups of people. The internet gives interested citizens better access to the information which allows them to impact on public policy. Using online tools to organize, people can more easily be involved in the policy-making process of government, and this has led to increased public engagement. Social media sites support networks of people; online networks affect the political process, including causing an increase in politicians' efforts to appeal to the public in campaigns. For e-democracy provides a forum for public discussion. An e-government process improves cooperation with the local populace and helps the government focus in upon key issues the community wants addressed. The theory is that every citizen has the opportunity to have a voice in their local government. E-democracy works in tandem with local communities and gives every citizen who wants to contribute the chance. What makes an effective e-democracy is that the citizens not only contribute to the government, but they communicate and work together to improve their own local communities. E-democracy is the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) to support the democratic decision-making processes. ICTs play a major role in organizing and informing citizens in various forms of civic engagement. ICTs are used to enhance active participation of citizens and to support the collaboration between actors for policy-making purposes within the political processes of all stages of governance.Kubicek, H., & Westholm, H. (2007).Macintoch, Ann (2006) The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development lists three main factors when it comes to ICTs promoting civic engagement. The first of these is timing; most of the civil engagement occurs during the agenda-setting in a cycle. The second key factor is tailor; this refers to the idea of how ICTs are changing in order to allow for more civic engagement. The last of these factors is integrations; integration is how new ICTs are combining the new technological ways with the traditional ways in order to gain more civic engagement. ICT creates the opportunity for a government that is simultaneously more democratic and more expert by creating open online collaboration between professionals and the general public. The responsibility of gathering information and making decisions is shared between those with technological expertise and those who are professionally considered the decision-makers. Greater public participation in the collaboration of ideas and policies makes decision-making is more democratic. ICT also promotes the idea of pluralism within a democracy, bringing new issues and perspectives. Regular citizens become potential producers of political value and commentary, for example, by creating individual blogs and websites. The online political sphere can work together, like ABCNews did with their Campaign Watchdog effort, where citizens by the polls reported any rule violations perpetrated by any candidate's party. Pdf. In 2000, Candidate's for the United States presidential race frequently used their websites to encourage their voters to not only vote, but to encourage their friends to vote as well. This two-step process, encouraging an individual to vote and to tell his or her friends to vote, was just emerging at that time. Now, political involvement from a variety of social media is commonplace and civic engagement through online forums frequent. Through the use of ICTs, politically minded individuals have the opportunity to become more involved. =Youth engagement= Young people under the age of 35, or Generation X and Generation Y, have been noted for their lack of political interest and activity.Owen, D. (2006). The Internet and youth civic engagement in the United States. In S. Oates, D. Owen & R. K. Gibson (Eds.), The Internet and politics: Citizens, voters and activists. London: Routledge. Electronic democracy has been suggested as a possible method to increase voter turnout, democratic participation, and political knowledge in youth.Canadian Parties in Transition, 3rd Edition. Gagnon and Tanguay (eds). Chapter 20 - Essay by Milner The notion of youth e-citizenship seems to be caught between two distinct approaches: management and autonomy. The policy of \\"targeting\\" young people so that they can \\"play their part\\" can be read either as an encouragement of youth activism or an attempt to manage it.Coleman, Stephen. \\"Doing IT for Themselves: Management versus Autonomy in Youth E-Citizenship.\\" Civic Life Online: Learning How Digital Media Can Engage Youth. Edited by W. Lance Bennett. The John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation Series on Digital Media and Learning. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 2008. 189‚Äì206. Autonomous e-citizens argue that despite their limited experience, youth deserve to speak for themselves on agendas of their own making. On the contrary, managed e-citizens regard young people as apprentice citizens who are in a process of transition from the immaturity of childhood to the self-possession of adulthood, and are thus incapable of contributing to politics without regulation. The Internet is another important issue, with managed e-citizens believing young people are highly vulnerable to misinformation and misdirection. The conflict between the two faces of e-citizenship is a view of democracy as an established and reasonably just system, with which young people should be encouraged to engage, and democracy as a political as well as cultural aspiration, most likely to be realized through networks in which young people engage with one another. Ultimately, strategies of accessing and influencing power are at the heart of what might first appear to be mere differences of communication styles. The Highland Youth Voice demonstrated the attempt to increase democratic involvement, especially through online measures, in Scotland. The youth population is increasingly more prominent in governmental policy and issues in the UK. However, involvement and interest have been decreasing. In 2001 elections in the United Kingdom to Westminster, the turnout of 18- to 24-year-olds was estimated at only 40%, which can be compared to the more than 80% of 16- to 24-year-old who have accessed the internet at some time in their life. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child have promoted and stressed the need to educate the younger population as citizens of the nation in which they live in, and promote the participation and active politics which they can shape through debate and communication. The Highland Youth Voice aims to increase the involvement of the younger generation through understanding their needs and wishes for their government, through an understanding of their views, experiences, and aspirations. Highland Youth Voice gives young Scots a chance to influence the decision makers in the Highlands. The members age from 14 to 18 and the parliament as a whole is an elected body of around 100 members. They are elected directly through schools and youth forums. Through the website, those involved are able to discuss the issues important to them. The final prominent democratic aspect of the website is the elections for members, which occur every other year. These three contents of the website allow for an online forum in which members may educate themselves through Youth Voice, partake in online policy debates, or experience a model of e-democracy in the ease of online voting. =Civil society= Citizens' associations play an important role in the democratic process, providing a place for individuals to learn about public affairs and a source of power outside that of the state, according to theorists like Alexis de Tocqueville. Public policy researcher Hans Klein at the Georgia Institute of Technology notes that participation in such forums has a number of barriers, such as the need to meet in one place at one time. In a study of a civic association in the northeastern United States, Klein found that electronic communications greatly enhanced the ability of the organization to fulfill its mission. The lower cost of information exchange on the Internet, as well as the high level of reach that the content potentially has, makes the Internet an attractive medium for political information, particularly amongst social interest groups and parties with lower budgets. For example, environmental or social issue groups may find the Internet an easier mechanism to increase awareness of their issues, as compared to traditional media outlets, such as television or newspapers, which require heavy financial investment. Due to all these factors, the Internet has the potential to take over certain traditional media of political communication, such as the telephone, the television, newspapers and the radio. The civil society has gradually moved into the online world. There are many forms of association in civic society. The term interest group conventionally refers to more formal organizations that either focus on particular social groups and economic sectors, such as trade unions and business and professional associations, or on more specific issues, such as abortion, gun control, or the environment.Norris, P. (2001). Digital divide: Civic engagement, information poverty, and the Internet worldwide. Cambridge: University Press Other traditional interest groups have well-established organizational structures and formal membership rules, and their primary orientation is toward influencing government and the policy process. Transnational advocacy networks bring together loose coalitions of these organizations under common umbrella organizations that cross national borders. Novel tools are being developed that are aimed at empowering bloggers, webmasters and owners of other social media, with the effect of moving from a strictly informational use of the Internet to using the Internet as a means of social organization not requiring top-down action. Calls to action, for instance, are a novel concept designed to allow webmasters to mobilize their viewers into action without the need for leadership. These tools are also utilized worldwide: for example, India is developing an effective blogosphere that allows internet users to state their thoughts and opinions.The road to e-democracy. (2008, February). The Economist, 386(8567), 15. The Internet may serve multiple functions for all these organizations, including lobbying elected representatives, public officials, and policy elites; networking with related associations and organizations; mobilizing organizers, activists, and members using action alerts, newsletters, and emails; raising funds and recruiting supporters; and communicating their message to the public via the traditional news media. =Deliberative democracy= The Internet also plays a central role in deliberative democracy, where deliberation and access to multiple viewpoints is central in decision-making. The Internet is able to provide an opportunity for interaction and serves as a prerequisite in the deliberative process as a research tool. On the Internet, the exchange of ideas is widely encouraged through a vast number of websites, blogs, and social networking outlets, such as Twitter; all of which encourage freedom of expression. Through the Internet, information is easily accessible, and in a cost-effective manner, providing access and means for change. Another fundamental feature of the Internet is its uncontrolled nature, and ability to provide all viewpoints no matter the accuracy. The freedom the Internet provides is able to foster and advocate change, crucial in e-democracy. A recent advancement in the utilization of e-democracy for the deliberative process is the California Report Card created by the Data and Democracy Initiative of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at University of California, Berkeley, together with Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom. The California Report Card, launched in January 2014, is a mobile-optimized web application designed to facilitate online deliberative democracy. After a short opinion poll on 6 timely issues, participants are invited to enter an online \\"caf√©\\" where they are placed, using Principal Component Analysis, among users with similar views. They are then encouraged to engage in the deliberative process by entering textual suggestions about new political issues and grading other participants' suggestions. The California Report Card prides itself on being resistant to private agendas dominating the discussion. Another example is openforum.com.au, an Australian non-profit eDemocracy project that invites politicians, senior public servants, academics, business people and other key stakeholders to engage in high-level policy debate. An alternative to the SOPA and PIPA, the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN Act) is supported by Google and Facebook. The OPEN Act website Keep The Web Open provides full access to the bill. The site also incorporates user input, over 150 changes have been made by users. The peer-to-patent project allows the public to do research and present the patent examiner with 'prior art' publications which will inform them of the novelty of the invention so that they can determine whether the invention is worthy of a patent. The community elects ten prior art pieces to be sent to the patent examiner for review. This enables the public to directly communicate with the patent examiner. This form of e-democracy is a structured environment which demands certain information from participants that aid in the decision-making process. The goal of the project is to make decision-making process is made more effective by allowing experts and civilians who work together to find solutions. Beyond citizens checking a box that reduces opinions to a few given words, citizens can participate and share ideas. =Voting and polling= Another great hurdle in implementing e-democracy is the matter of ensuring security in internet-voting systems. Viruses and malware could block or redirect citizens' votes on matters of great importance; as long as that threat remains, e-democracy will not be able to diffuse throughout society. Kevin Curran and Eric Nichols of the Internet Technologies Research Group noted in 2005 that \\"a secure Internet voting system is theoretically possible, but it would be the first secure networked application ever created in the history of computers\\". A lack of participation in democracy may result from a plethora of polls and surveys, which can lead to survey fatigue. =Government transparency and accessibility= Through ListServs, RSS feeds, mobile messaging, micro-blogging services and blogs, government and its agencies can share information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. Some government representatives are also beginning to use Twitter which provides them with an easy medium to inform their followers. In the state of Rhode Island, for instance, Treasurer Frank T. Caprio is offering daily tweets of the state's cash flow. A number of non-governmental sites have developed cross-jurisdiction, customer-focused applications that extract information from thousands of governmental organizations into a system that brings consistency to data across many dissimilar providers. It is convenient and cost-effective for businesses, and the public benefits by getting easy access to the most current information available without having to expend tax dollars to get it. One example of this is transparent.gov.com, a free resource for citizens to quickly identify the various open government initiatives taking place in their community or in communities across the country. A similar example is USA.gov, the official site of the United States government, which is a directory that links to every federal and state agency. E-democracy leads to a more simplified process and access to government information for public-sector agencies and citizens. For example, the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records to be admitted in county court proceedings. Indiana became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed, legally certified and delivered electronically by using Electronic Postmark technology. The internet has created increased government accessibility to news, policies, and contacts in the 21st century: \\"In 2000 only two percent of government sites offered three or more services online; in 2007 that figure was 58 percent. In 2000, 78 percent of the states offered no on-line services; in 2007 only 14 percent were without these services (West, 2007)\\"(Issuu). Direct access via email has also increased; \\"In 2007, 89 percent of government sites allowed the public e-mail a public official directly rather than simply e-mailing the webmaster (West, 2007)\\"(Issuu). Opposition Information and communications technologies can be used for both democratic and anti-democratic ends.(e.g. both coercive control and participation can be fostered by digital technology) George Orwell's in his Nineteen Eighty-Four is one example of the vision of the anti-democratic use of technology. Objections to direct democracy are argued to apply to e-democracy, such as the potential for direct governance to tend towards the polarization of opinions, populism, and demagoguery. =Internet censorship= In a nation with heavy government censorship, e-democracy could not be utilized to its full extent. Governments often implement internet crackdowns during widespread political protests. In the middle-east in 2011, for example, the multiple cases of internet blackouts were dubbed the \\"Arab Net Crackdown\\". Libya, Egypt, Bahrain, Syria, Iran, and Yemen are all countries whose leaders implemented complete censorship of the internet in response to the plethora of pro-democracy demonstrations in their respective nations. These lockdowns were primarily put in place in order to prevent the leakage of cell phone videos that contained images of the violent government crackdown on protesters. Additionally, based on Joshua A. Tucker's critics of e-democracy, social media's malleability and receptiveness may allow political parties to manipulate it and implement political desires (Tucker et al., 2017). Through it, authorities are able to spread authoritarianism, firstly by, intimidation; imposing fear on opposers, monitoring private conversations and even imprisoning one who dissents non- desirable opinion. Secondly, flooding; diverting and occupying services with pro-regime messages. Thirdly, detaining; interrupting signals which impedes access to information. Lastly, banning; forbidding globalized platforms and websites (Tucker et al., 2017). =Concerns with populism= In a study conducted that interviewed elected officials in Austria's parliament, opinions were widely and strongly against e-democracy. They believed that the citizens were uninformed and that their only way of expressing their opinions should be to vote; sharing opinions and ideas was strictly the job of the elected. Alternatively, theories of epistemic democracy have indicated that more engagement of the populace has benefited the aggregation of knowledge and intelligence, and thus permitted democracies to track the truth better. =Stop Online Piracy Act= Many Internet users believed that Internet democracy was being attacked in the United States with the introduction of H.R. 3261, Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), in the United States House of Representatives.Smith, Congressman Lamar. \\"H.R. 3261.\\" Ed. Representatives, House of. Washington, DC: 112th Congress, 1st Session, 2011. Print. A Huffington Post Contributor noted that the best way to promote democracy, including keeping freedom of speech alive, is through defeating the Stop Online Piracy Act. It is important to note that SOPA was postponed indefinitely after major protests arose, including by many popular websites such as Wikipedia, which launched a site blackout on 18 January 2012. In India, a similar situation was noted at the end of 2011, when India's Communication and IT Minister Kapil Sibal suggested that offensive content may be privately \\"pre-screened\\" before being allowed on the Internet with no rules for redressal. However, more recent news reports quote Sibal as saying that there would be no restrictions whatsoever on the use of the Internet. Government models =Representative democracy= The radical shift from representative government to internet-mediated direct democracy is not likely. However, proponents believe that a \\"hybrid model\\" that uses the internet to allow for greater government transparency and community participation in decision-making is on the horizon. Committee selection, local town and city decisions, and otherwise people-centric decisions would be more easily facilitated. The principles of democracy are not changing so much as the tools used to uphold them. E-democracy would not be a means to implement direct democracy, but rather a tool to enable more participatory democracy as it exists now. =Electronic direct democracy= Proponents of e-democracy sometimes envision a transition from a representative democracy to a direct democracy carried out through technological means, and see this transition as an end goal of e-democracy. In an Electronic direct democracy (EDD) (also known as open source governance or collaborative e-democracy), the people are directly involved in the legislative function by electronic means. Citizens electronically vote on legislation, author new legislation, and recall representatives (if any representatives are preserved). Technology for supporting EDD has been researched and developed at the Florida Institute of Technology,Kattamuri, et al. \\"Supporting Debates Over Citizen Initiatives\\", Digital Government Conference, pp 279-280, 2005 where the technology is used with student organizations. Numerous other software development projects are underway,List of active projects involved in the Metagovernment project along with many supporting and related projects.List of related projects from the Metagovernment project Several of these projects are now collaborating on a cross-platform architecture, under the umbrella of the Metagovernment project.Standardization project of the Metagovernment project. EDD as a system is not fully implemented in a political government anywhere in the world, although several initiatives are currently forming. Ross Perot was a prominent advocate of EDD when he advocated \\"electronic town halls\\" during his 1992 and 1996 Presidential campaigns in the United States. Switzerland, already partially governed by direct democracy, is making progress towards such a system. Senator On-Line, an Australian political party established in 2007, proposes to institute an EDD system so that Australians can decide which way the senators vote on each and every bill. A similar initiative was formed 2002 in Sweden where the party Direktdemokraterna, running for the Swedish parliament, offers its members the power to decide the actions of the party over all or some areas of decision, or to use a proxy with immediate recall for one or several areas. The Direktdemokraterna party in Sweden advocates EDD. =Liquid democracy= Liquid democracy, or direct democracy with delegable proxy, would allow citizens to choose a proxy to vote on their behalf while retaining the right to cast their own vote on legislation. The voting and the appointment of proxies could be done electronically. Taking this further, the proxies could form proxy chains, in which if A appoints B and B appoints C, and neither A nor B vote on a proposed bill but C does, C's vote will count for all three of them. Citizens could also rank their proxies in order of preference, so that if their first choice proxy fails to vote, their vote can be cast by their second-choice proxy. =Wikidemocracy= One proposed form of e-democracy is \\"wikidemocracy\\", with a government legislature whose codex of laws was an editable wiki, like Wikipedia. In 2012, J Manuel Feliz-Teixeira said he believed the resources to implement wikidemocracy were available. He envisions a wiki-system in which there would be three wings of legislative, executive and judiciary roles for which every citizen could have a voice with free access to the wiki and a personal ID to continuously reform policies until the last day of December (when all votes would be counted). Advantages to wikidemocracy include a no-cost system with the removal of elections, no need for parliament or representatives because citizens directly represent themselves, and ease of access to voice one's opinion. However, there are obstacles, uncertainties and disagreements. First, the digital divide and low quality of education can be deterrents to achieve the full potential of a wikidemocracy. Similarly, there is a diffusion of innovation in response to new technologies in which some people readily adopt novel ways and others at the opposite end of the spectrum reject them or are slow to adapt. It is also uncertain how secure this type of democracy would be because we would have to trust that the system administrator would have a high level of integrity to protect the votes saved to the public domain. Lastly, Peter Levine agrees that wikidemocracy would increase discussion on political and moral issues, but he disagrees with Feliz-Teixeira who argues that wikidemocracy would remove the need for representatives and formal governmental structures. Wikidemocracy is also used to mean more limited instantiations of e-democracy, such as in Argentina in August 2011, where the polling records of the presidential election were made available to the public in online form, for vetting. The term has also been used in a more general way to refer to the democratic values and environments offered by wikis. In 2011, some in Finland undertook an experiment in wikidemocracy by creating a \\"shadow government program\\" on the Internet, essentially a compilation of the political views and aspirations of various groups in Finland, on a wiki.

H√∏nefoss is an industrial center of inner √òstlandet, containing several factories and other industry. As of 1 January 2008, H√∏nefoss has 14,177 inhabitants. In 1852, H√∏nefoss received town status and was separated from Norderhov. In 1964, H√∏nefoss ceased being a separate municipality and became part of Ringerike. Etymology The town is named after H√∏nefossen, a waterfall on the Begna River. The first element is the name of the old farm H√∏nen (Old Norse *H≈ìnvin), the last element is foss meaning 'waterfall'. The name of the farm is a compound of a word *h≈ìn- (with an unknown meaning) and vin f 'meadow'.Oluf Rygh (1897) ¬´Norske Gaardnavne¬ª. 86. H√∏nen Location H√∏nefoss is located 63 kilometres northwest by road from the Norwegian capital of Oslo. H√∏nefoss is situated north of Lake Tyrifjorden. At H√∏nefoss, the Begna flows together with the Randselva river just below H√∏nefossen forming the Storelva river which flows into Nordfjord, the upper west branch of Lake Tyrifjord. Transportation European route E16 runs near H√∏nefoss on its way from Oslo to Bergen. H√∏nefoss is connected to Norwegian national road 35 (Rv 35) which passes within town limits. Norwegian National Road 7 from Granvin in Hordaland ends at H√∏nefoss. H√∏nefoss Station is located at the intersection between the Bergen Line (Bergensbanen), the Randsfjord Line and the Roa‚ÄìH√∏nefoss Line. The rail station was opened in 1868 when the Randsfjord Line was extended from Tyristand to Randsfjord. The current station building was put into operation in 1909, in connection with the opening of the Bergen Line between Oslo and Geilo. Economy H√∏nefoss is home to several factories and other industry, with Norske Skog Follum maintaining its headquarters in the city. Dating from 1873, Norske Skog Follum was one of the largest producers of newsprint in Europe. The paper mill closed in 2012. Ringerikes Blad is a regional newspaper covering Ringerike, Hole and Jevnaker. Established in 1845, the newspaper is published daily in H√∏nefoss.

The museum is noted for its icon collection, its rune stones and its collection of the private belongings of J√∏rgen Engebretsen Moe. J√∏rgen Moe was a Norwegian author, who is best known for the Norske Folkeeventyr, a collection of Norwegian folk tales which he edited in collaboration with Peter Christen Asbj√∏rnsen. It is affiliated with the Buskerud Museum (Buskerudmuseet). Buskerud Photography Archive (Buskerud fylkesfotoarkiv) is a central archive for photography and photo- historical material from Buskerud. The archives accommodates approx. 200,000 photographs dating from the 1850s. Buskerud fylkesfotoarkiv has shared office space with the Ringerikes Museum in Norderhov and is affiliated with the Buskerud Museum (Buskerudmuseet). Veien Cultural Heritage Park (Veien Kulturminnepark) is in located in H√∏nefoss. The park contains over 100 grave mounds from the Early Iron Age, as well as a reconstructed longhouse and a museum. It is affiliated with the Buskerud Museum (Buskerudmuseet). Ridder Farm (Ridderg√•rden) is located on the north side of H√∏nefoss. This had been a family farm dating to 1730.

Early life James Kilfedder, born in Kinlough, County Leitrim to a family from Enniskillen, was educated at Portora Royal School, Enniskillen and Trinity College Dublin. During his time in college he acted as Auditor of the College Historical Society, one of the oldest undergraduate debating society in the world. He became a barrister, called to the Irish Bar at King's Inns, Dublin, in 1952 and the English Bar at Gray's Inn in 1958. He practised law in London. Political career At the 1964 general election, Kilfedder was elected as an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) Member of Parliament for West Belfast. During the campaign there were riots in Divis Street when the police removed an Irish flag from the Sinn F√©in offices of Billy McMillen after a complaint by Kilfedder in the form of a telegram to the Minister of Home Affairs, Brian McConnell. It read \\"Remove tricolour in Divis Street which is aimed to provoke and insult loyalists of Belfast.\\"Andy Boyd: Holy War in Belfast Kilfedder lost his seat at the 1966 election to Gerry Fitt. He was elected again in the 1970 general election for North Down, and held the seat until his death in 1995. Kilfedder was elected for North Down in the 1973 Assembly election, signing Brian Faulkner's pledge to support the White Paper which eventually established the Sunningdale Agreement but becoming an anti-White Paper Unionist after the election. In 1975 he stood for the same constituency in the Constitutional Convention election, polling over three quotas as a UUP member of the United Ulster Unionist Coalition (UUUC) although he refused to sign the UUUC's pledge of conduct. He left the UUP in 1977 in opposition to the party's policies tending to integrationism, preferring to advocate the restoration of the Stormont administration. For a time he sat as an \\"Independent Ulster Unionist\\". He contested the 1979 European Parliament Election under that label, finishing fourth in the count for the three seats, having overtaken the UUP leader Harry West on transfers. In 1980 he formed the Ulster Popular Unionist Party (UPUP) and was re-elected under that label in all subsequent elections. He again topped the poll in the 1982 Assembly election and was elected as Speaker of the AssemblyRobert Waller, Almanac of British Politics, 3rd edition (to 1986). He generally took the Conservative whip at Westminster.Waller and Criddle, Almanac of British Politics, 6th edition Whilst Speaker he was paid more than the Prime Minister. Death and legacy On 20 March 1995, while travelling by train into London from Gatwick airport, Kilfedder died of a heart attack. This was the same day that the Belfast Telegraph carried a front-page story saying that an Ulster MP had been targeted as one of twenty MPs invited by the LGBT rights organisation OutRage! in a letter to come out.Angus McLaren, Sexual Blackmail: A Modern History, Harvard University Press, 2002 and the Belfast Telegraph of that date He died unmarried, survived by two sisters. Kilfedder was described as > \\"a phenomenon or perhaps a left-over from a remote era of Northern Irish > politics when Ulster was represented by such figures as Lord Robert > Grosvenor, Major Robin Chichester-Clark, Stratton Mills, and Rafton > Pounder.\\" Kilfedder was described by Democratic Unionist Party MLA Peter Weir as \\"the best MP North Down ever had.\\" The UPUP did not outlive him, and the by- election for his Commons seat was won by Robert McCartney standing for the UK Unionist Party. He had fought the seat in the 1987 general election as a \\"Real Unionist\\" with the backing of the Campaign for Equal Citizenship. At the 1987 election count, in his victory speech, Kilfedder had \\"attacked his rival's supporters as 'a rag tag collection of people who shame the name of civil rights.' He said they included communists, Protestant paramilitaries and Gay Rights supporters and he promised to expose more in future.\\"Co. Down Spectator, 18 June 1987 McCartney lost North Down in 2001 to Lady Hermon of the UUP.

It evolved out of the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (founded in 1967). The association was one of the biggest advancements for women's athletics on the collegiate level. Throughout the 1970s, the AIAW grew rapidly in membership and influence, in parallel with the national growth of women's sports following the enactment of Title IX. The AIAW functioned in the equivalent role for college women's programs that the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) had been doing for men's programs. Owing to its own success, the AIAW was in a vulnerable position that precipitated conflicts with the NCAA in the early 1980s. Following a one-year overlap in which both organizations staged women's championships, the AIAW discontinued operation, and most member schools continued their women's athletics programs under the governance of the NCAA. History Women's intercollegiate athletics were organized on a national basis in 1941, the year the first national collegiate championship was held in the sport of golf by the Division for Girls' and Women's Sports (DGWS) of the American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation. During the late 1950s and the 1960s, many colleges around the country had started women's sports teams that competed with other schools in their respective geographic areas. In 1956 the Tripartite Committee was formed by representatives of three organizations: the National Association for Physical Education for College Women, the National Association for Girls' and Women's Sport, and the American Federation of College Women.Hunt, Virginia: \\"Governance of Women's Intercollegiate Athletics: an Historical Perspective.\\" PhD Diss. University of North Carolina - Greensboro, 1976. Ann Arbor, Michigan: University Microfilms, 1977. Upon the recommendation of the Tripartite Committee, the National Joint Committee on Extramural Sports for College Women (NJCESCW) was formed in 1957 to guide and administer women's intercollegiate athletic programs. In 1965, with the desire to consolidate governance of women's intercollegiate athletics under one organization, the NJCESCW disbanded and agreed to let the DGWS assume control over competition and extramural events. The first action the DGWS took was to establish the Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (CIAW) to assume responsibility for designing, sponsoring, and sanctioning women‚Äôs intercollegiate sports and championships. The purposes of the CIAW were (1) to provide the framework and organization for women's intercollegiate athletic opportunities and (2) to sponsor national championships for college women under the authority of the DGWS. The AIAW developed from the CIAW in recognition of the need for institutional membership and elected representation. Formation of the AIAW was approved by the DGWS Council and the AAHPER Board of Directors in 1971, but the CIAW continued to operate until early 1972, at which time the AIAW officially came into existence, with over 280 schools as members. At that time the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) had no interest in women's athletics, and administrators of the AIAW had no interest in the NCAA either. The NCAA was seen as being commercially driven and neglecting the meaning of the student-athlete. There were distinct differences between the two associations in the AIAW's early years. For example, student-athletes playing in AIAW programs were allowed to transfer freely between schools, and to prevent unfair advantages, programs were initially forbidden to offer scholarships and recruit off-campus. The AIAW continued the rules established by the CIAW, which were intended to prohibit unethical practices that were observed in men's sports. To enforce the rules, students receiving scholarships were forbidden from championship participation. The ban on scholarships ended in 1973, following a lawsuit by players and coaches from two colleges in Florida. The AIAW was not without criticism however, as some outsiders and individual members complained that the association devoted too much time, efforts, and funds securing distinction and independence from the NCAA. The annual softball tournaments and basketball tournaments received the most publicity and drew the biggest crowds; however, the association organized championships in various other sports. They included mainstream sports like volleyball and tennis but were as far reaching as badminton and fencing. Aside from national championships, individual schools worked together to stage annual state championships. While in existence, the AIAW organized and administered all competition at the regional and national levels. In 1981-82 the organization offered 41 national championships in 19 sports ‚Äî badminton, basketball, cross country, fencing, field hockey, golf, gymnastics, indoor track and field, lacrosse, rowing, skiing, soccer, softball (fast and slow pitch), swimming and diving, synchronized swimming, tennis, track and field, and volleyball. The 1973 Basketball Tournament was the first sign that women's sports could be financially successful. Over 3,000 fans watched the final game between Queens and Immaculata, and the tournament earned over $4,500 in profits. In 1975 these two teams met again, this time in Madison Square Garden. The first women's basketball game to be played in the arena drew a crowd of more than 12,000 spectators. The AIAW started to take advantage of corporate sponsorships and television payouts not unlike its male counterpart, but on a smaller scale. In 1972, the United States Congress passed Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972. Although the impact today is primarily discussed in terms of the impact on athletics, the bill made no explicit mention of athletics. The bill provided that neither men nor women could \\"be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance\\". The task of issuing regulations fell to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW). One of its early decisions was that athletic programs would indeed be subject to the requirements of the law. The effect was to require the creation of new women's teams instead of stipulating that women could simply try out for men's teams. Consequently, the regulations required colleges to provide equal opportunities for both genders in collegiate athletics. Any school that received federal funds was required to provide gender equality by the 1978-79 school year. In 1974 colleges started giving scholarships to female student-athletes. That year (aside from the exceptional Wayland College basketball team in the 1950s), Ann Meyers became the first female to receive a full scholarship by committing to play for UCLA. Title IX is credited with the vast improvement in funding for women's athletics. By 1980, the average university spent over 16% of its athletics budget on women's sports. In the early 1970s that number was less than 1%. Although the regulations promulgated under the law required additional funding for women's teams, athletic directors did not immediately embrace the requirements. Their concerns included the relative inability for many schools to sufficiently fund the necessary women's teams, making it possible for the budgets for men's teams to be reduced to achieve compliance. The NCAA, which regulated men's intercollegiate sports, raised money to help fight Title IX. In 1974 the Senate passed the Tower Amendment, which decreed that Title IX did not cover football or other revenue-producing sports. The recently formed AIAW responded, hiring a lawyer, Margot Polivy, to fight the Tower Amendment. Their efforts were successful, as a joint Congressional conference committee decided to eliminate the Tower Amendment. On June 1, 1979, the AIAW assumed a separate legal identity and became a nonprofit corporation in the District of Columbia. Then in 1981, following the NCAA's decision to offer championships for women in its top competitive division, Division I, the AIAW suffered substantial losses of members and revenue. = AIAW vs. NCAA = At its peak, the AIAW had almost 1,000 member schools. In the late 1970s, however, schools began to realize that women's athletics could be profitable, and the NCAA decided to offer women's championships. The NCAA's Divisions II and III voted to offer championships in 1980; however, Division I members failed to gain a majority vote on this issue until the 1981 national meeting. This decision was quite contentious. During the tense floor debate, AIAW representatives objected to the motion to sponsor Division I championships, but their objections were met with pockets of \\"ridicule and hissing\\". After considerable debate, a vote was called, and the initial result was a tie, 124‚Äì124. A recount of the votes revealed the defeat of the motion by a vote of 128‚Äì127. However, parliamentary rules permit \\"reconsideration\\" of a vote if someone on the prevailing side asks for it. Several delegates on the losing side knew of one institution that had voted against the motion but whose faculty representative favored the NCAA position. When the influencer of the school‚Äôs \\"nay\\" vote left the room, those delegates prevailed upon that representative to request reconsideration. This time it passed, 137‚Äì117. For the 1981-82 academic year, schools were able to compete in either the NCAA or the AIAW championships. There were a few occasions when a school participated in both tournaments that year (Florida in gymnastics, 1982; Oklahoma State in softball, 1982; indeed the University of Tulsa won both the AIAW and NCAA women's golf championships in 1982). However, the battle of members had started, as schools whose men's teams were already participating in the NCAA started to integrate their women's teams. Although some schools permitted their individual women's teams to choose, most schools made the weighty decision to support only one of the two organizations. The AIAW had fought for women's rights in the Title IX battle, while the NCAA had opposed those efforts. In contrast, the NCAA was much better funded and had better access to television contracts. The University of Texas, where the last AIAW president, Donna Lopiano, was the women's athletics director, was one of the stronger holdouts. But when seventeen of the top twenty basketball teams agreed to enter the NCAA tournament, it proved to be the end for the AIAW. In 1982 the first Division I NCAA Women‚Äôs Basketball Tournament was held. The NCAA was able to offer incentives, such as payment of transportation costs, to participating members, something the AIAW was not able to do. When former AIAW powerhouses like Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, and Old Dominion decided to participate in the NCAA tournament, the AIAW tournament lost much of its appeal and popularity. NBC canceled its TV contract with the association, and in mid-1982 the AIAW stopped operations in all sports. Following the last AIAW sanctioned event in 1982, the AIAW pursued a federal anti-trust suit against the NCAA. But one year later, after the presiding judge ruled against the organization, the AIAW ceased existence on June 30, 1983. Under NCAA governance, scholarships increased. However, several problems the NCAA was facing, then and now, began to also affect women's intercollegiate athletics. Examples of these include recruiting irregularities and increased turnover in coaching positions for revenue-producing sports. Several AIAW championships were televised by the TVS Television Network in 1979.

He came to believe that she is the Divine Mother and started to take care of her, allowing her to unfold her inner experiences. Her parents Antamma and Veera Reddy live in Madanapalle, Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.Mother Meera, \\"Answers, part II\\", page 21 -23 In 1974, uncle Reddy brought Mother Meera to the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Puducherry, India, of which he was a member.Adilakshmi, 'The Mother', page 10 There she first met Westerners and started to give Darshan. She is however not associated with the Sri Aurobindo Ashram today. In 1979 she was invited by her first devotees to Canada, where she went several times. Meanwhile, uncle Reddy's health started to deteriorate. In 1981 she made her first trip to West Germany, where she, together with uncle Reddy and her close companion Adilakshmi, settled down a year later. She married a German in 1982. Uncle Reddy died in 1985 and was buried in the local cemetery in Dornburg-Thalheim, Hesse.Adilakshmi, 'The Mother', page 7 For some years now, she has been giving Darshan (literally seeing, primarily in a spiritual context) at Schloss Schaumburg in Balduinstein, a small town in Germany. Previously, in the early 1990s, she gave Darshan in a house in the town of Thalheim, some 5 km northwest of Hadamar in Germany. She also visits the United States on a regular basis (see links below). Activities Mother Meera receives thousands of visitors of all religions for darshan which she conducts in total silence. Her darshan consists of a ritual, where she will touch a person's head, and then look into their eyes. During this process, she reportedly 'unties knots' in the person's subtle system and permeates them with light.Adilakshmi, \\"The Mother\\", pages 87 -88 She doesn't charge any money for doing so and she will not give lectures. Mother Meera's reported task on Earth was in calling down a dynamic light- force from the Supreme (Paramatman ‚Äì the supreme Self) in collaboration with other saints and divine beings, as she says, making spiritual progress on earth easier.Adilakshmi, \\"The Mother\\", pages 38 ‚Äì 40 About this light she says: Through Japa, the mental remembrance of any Divine Name or Mantra, which may be done informally, and whenever convenient, people could open themselves up to this Light.Mother Meera, \\"Answers, Part I\\", pages 89 -98 She does not claim to be a guru or have followers. To be connected to her work, people do not have to recognise her. Her teaching is mainly related to Bhakti, that is devotion to God, and in that she accepts all denominations. Mother Meera does not belong to any particular tradition, except for a certain closeness to the work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother,See 'Sri Aurobindo Research Academy' in Mother Meera, \\"Answers, Part II\\", pages 189 ‚Äì 195 whom she was reported to have met in their subtle bodies, when she was a child, visiting their Samadhi (grave).Adilakshmi, \\"The Mother\\", pages 10 ‚Äì 12 She teaches the unity of all religions. Everyone can go their own ways. It is only important to be connected with the light (the personal spiritual role model) every day by praying, reading or meditating.  Critics  After splitting from Mother Meera, the writer and former follower Andrew Harvey wrote The Sun at Midnight.Harvey, Andrew, The Sun at Midnight: A Memoir of the Dark Night, 2002, In it, Harvey accused Meera of homophobia, saying that Mother Meera disapproved of Harvey's marriage to another man. In his first book about her, Hidden Journey, Harvey had originally praised her as an avatar, attributing his own claimed enlightenment to her. Harvey's accusation of homophobia is disputed. One of Harvey's former lovers, the writer Mark Matousek (1997),Homepage said that: \\"I do know that the idea that she's homophobic is completely ridiculous.

It is set in the fictitious town of Starkfield, Massachusetts. The novel was adapted into a film, Ethan Frome, in 1993. Plot The novel is a framed narrative. The framing story concerns an unnamed male narrator spending a winter in Starkfield while in the area on business. He spots a limping, quiet man around the village, who is somehow compelling in his demeanor and carriage. This is Ethan Frome, who is a lifelong resident and a local fixture of the community. Frome is described by the narrator as \\"the most striking figure in Starkfield\\", \\"the ruin of a man\\" with a \\"careless powerful look ... in spite of a lameness checking each step like the jerk of a chain\\". Curious, the narrator sets out to learn about him. He learns that Frome's limp arose from having been injured in a \\"smash-up\\" twenty-four years before, but further details are not forthcoming, and the narrator fails to learn much more from Frome's fellow townspeople other than that Ethan's attempt at higher education decades before was thwarted by the sudden illness of his father following an injury, forcing his return to the farm to assist his parents, never to leave again. Because people seem not to wish to speak other than in vague and general terms about Frome's past, the narrator's curiosity grows, but he learns little more. Chance circumstances arise that allow the narrator to hire Frome as his driver for a week. A severe snowstorm during one of their journeys forces Frome to allow the narrator to shelter at his home one night. Just as the two are entering Frome's house, the prologue ends and the framed story begins. The narration switches from the first-person narrator of the prologue to a limited third-person narrator. We then embark on the \\"first\\" chapter (Chapter I), which takes place twenty-four years prior. In Chapter I, Ethan is waiting outside a church dance for Mattie, his wife's cousin, who has for a year lived with Ethan and his sickly wife, Zeena (Zenobia), in order to help out around the house and farm. Mattie is given the occasional night off to entertain herself in town as partial recompense for helping care for the Fromes, and Ethan has the duty of walking her home. It is quickly clear that Ethan has deep feelings for Mattie. Passing the graveyard, he thinks in an intense moment of foreshadowing that, \\"We'll always go on living here together, and some day she'll lie there beside me.\\" It also becomes clear that Zeena has observed enough to understand that he has these feelings and, understandably, she resents them. When Zeena leaves for an overnight visit to seek treatment for her various complaints and symptoms in a neighboring town, Ethan is excited to have an evening alone with Mattie. During this evening, the narrator reveals small actions that show that they each have feelings for the other, including a lingering of touching hands on the milk jug, although neither openly declares their love. Mattie makes supper and retrieves from a high shelf Zeena's treasured pickle dish, which Zeena, in a symbol of her stingy nature, never uses, in order to protect it. Mattie uses it to present Ethan with a simple supper, and disaster ensues when the Fromes' cat jumps on the table and knocks it off, shattering it beyond repair. Ethan tries to help by setting the dish's pieces neatly in the cupboard, presenting the false impression of wholeness if not examined closely, with plans to purchase some glue and fix it as soon as he can. In the morning Ethan's hopes for more private time with Mattie are foiled by the presence of his hired man. Ethan then goes into town to buy glue for the broken pickle dish, and upon his return finds that Zeena has also come home. Zeena retreats upstairs, proclaiming her illness, and refusing supper because she is not hungry. There, she informs Ethan that she plans to send Mattie away and has already hired another girl to replace her, claiming that she needs someone more efficient because her health is failing more rapidly than ever. Ethan is angry and frustrated to the point of panic by the thought of losing Mattie, and he is also worried for Mattie, who has no other place to go and no way to support herself in the world. He returns to the kitchen and joins Mattie, and tries to eat, but he is distraught and suddenly blurts out Zeena's plans to send Mattie away. Mattie reacts with shock but rapid acceptance, trying to calm Ethan, while Ethan becomes more agitated and begins to insist that he will not let her go. Ethan kisses her. Moments later, they are interrupted by Zeena, who has decided that she is hungry after all. After supper, Zeena discovers the broken pickle dish and is heartbroken and enraged; this betrayal cements her determination to send Mattie away. Ethan, miserable at the thought of losing Mattie and worried sick about her fate, considers running away with Mattie, but he lacks the money to do so. He feels that he cannot abandon Zeena because he knows that she would neither be able to run the farm nor sell it (the poor quality of the place has been discussed at several points in the story already). Every plan he thinks of is impossible to carry out, and he remains in despair and frantically trying to think of a way to change this one more turn of events against his ability to have a happy life. The next morning, Zeena describes her specific and imminent plans for sending Mattie on her way. Panicked, Ethan rushes into town to try to get a cash advance from a customer for a load of lumber in order to have the money with which to abscond with Mattie. His plan is unhinged by guilt, however, when his customer's wife expresses compassion, understanding, and empathy for Ethan's lot, which has involved the repeated duty to care for others, first his parents, then his sickly wife. He realizes that, of all people, he cannot cheat this kindly woman and her husband out of money, since she is one of the few people who have ever seemed to have seen or openly acknowledged Ethan's lifelong plight, as well as his honor in fulfilling his duties. Ethan returns to the farm and picks up Mattie to take her to the train station. They stop at a hill upon which they had once planned to go sledding and decide to sled together as a way of delaying their sad parting, after which they anticipate never seeing each other again. After their first run, Mattie suggests a suicide pact: that they go down again, and steer the sled directly into a tree, so they will never be parted and so that they may spend their last moments together. Ethan first refuses to go through with the plan, but in his despair that mirrors Mattie's, he ultimately agrees, and they get on the sled, clutching each other. On the way down, a vision of Zeena's face startles Ethan into swerving a bit, but he corrects their course, and they crash headlong and at high speed into the elm tree. Ethan regains consciousness after the accident but Mattie lies beside him, \\"cheeping\\" in pain like a small wounded animal. Ethan is also injured, and the reader is left to understand that this was the \\"smash-up\\" that left Ethan with a permanent limp. The epilogue returns to the framing story and the first-person narrator point of view of the prologue. The framing story resumes precisely where it left off: just as Frome and his visitor, the narrator, enter the Frome household in the story's present. The narrator hears a complaining female voice, and it is easy to assume that it belongs to the never-happy Zeena, but in the final twist of the story, it emerges that it is in fact Mattie, who now lives with the Fromes due to having been paralyzed in the accident. Her misery over her plight and dependence has embittered and \\"soured\\" her, and, with roles reversed, Zeena is now forced to care for her as well as Ethan. Further illustrating the psychosomatic nature of most of Zeena's previous complaints, she has now found the strength through necessity to be the caregiver rather than being the invalid. In an agonizing irony, Ethan and Mattie have gotten their wish to stay together, but in mutual unhappiness and discontent, with Mattie helpless and paralyzed, and with Zeena as a constant presence between the two of them. Development The story of Ethan Frome had initially begun as a French-language composition that Wharton had to write while studying the language in Paris, but several years later she took the story up again and transformed it into the novel it now is, basing her sense of New England culture and place on her ten years of living at The Mount, her home in Lenox, Massachusetts. She would read portions of her novel- in-progress each day to her good friend Walter Berry, who was an international lawyer. Wharton likely based the story of Ethan and Mattie's sledding experience on an accident that she had heard about in 1904 in Lenox, Massachusetts. Five people total were involved in the real-life accident, four girls and one boy. They crashed into a lamppost while sledding down Courthouse Hill in Lenox. A girl named Emily Hazel Crosby was killed in the accident. Wharton learned of the accident from one of the girls who survived, Kate Spencer, when the two became friends while both worked at the Lenox Library. Kate Spencer suffered from a hip injury in the accident and also had facial injuries. It is among the few works by Wharton with a rural setting. Wharton found the notion of the tragic sledding crash to be irresistible as a potential extended metaphor for the wrongdoings of a secret love affair. Lenox is also where Wharton had traveled extensively and had come into contact with at least one of the victims of the accident; victims of the accident are buried in graves nearby Wharton family members. In her introduction to the novel, Wharton talks of the \\"outcropping granite\\" of New England, the austerity of its land and the stoicism of its people. The connection between land and people is very much a part of naturalism; the environment is a powerful shaper of man's fate, and the novel dwells insistently on the cruelty of Starkfield's winters.Lewis, R.W.B. Edith Wharton: A Biography. New York: Harper & Row, Publishers, 1975. Reception The New York Times called Ethan Frome \\"a compelling and haunting story.\\" Edith Wharton was able to write an appealing book and separate it from her other works, where her characters in Ethan Frome are not of the elite upper class. However, the problems that the characters endure are still consistently the same, where the protagonist has to decide whether or not to fulfill their duty or follow their heart. She began writing Ethan Frome in the early 1900s when she was still married. The novel was criticized by Lionel Trilling as lacking in moral or ethical significance. Trilling wrote that the ending is \\"terrible to contemplate,\\" but that \\"the mind can do nothing with it, can only endure it.\\"\\"Review of Ethan Frome\\" . NovelGuide: Ethan Frome. Novelgide.com, n.d. February 24, 2010. Jeffrey Lilburn notes that some find \\"the suffering endured by Wharton's characters is excessive and unjustified,\\" but others see the difficult moral questions addressed and note that it \\"provides insightful commentary on the American economic and cultural realities that produced and allowed such suffering.\\" Wharton was always careful to label Ethan Frome as a tale rather than a novel. Critics did take note of this when reviewing the book. Elizabeth Ammons compared the work to fairy tales. She found a story that is \\"as moral as the classic fairy tale\\" and that functions as a \\"realistic social criticism.\\" The moral concepts, as described by Ammons, are revealed with all of the brutality of Starkfield's winters. Comparing Mattie Silver and Zeena Frome, Ammons suggests that the Matties will grow as frigid and crippled as the Zeenas, so long as such women remain isolated and dependent. Wharton cripples Mattie, says Lilburn, but has her survive in order to demonstrate the cruelty of the culture surrounding women in that period.Lilburn, Jeffrey. \\"Ethan Frome (Criticism).\\" Answers.com.

It can be found in soil, water, and fecal matter. It is grouped with the Morganellaceae and is an opportunistic pathogen of humans. It is known to cause wound infections and other species of its genera are known to cause urinary tract infections. P. vulgaris was one of the three species Hauser isolated from putrefied meat and identified (1885). Over the past two decades, the genus Proteus, and in particular P. vulgaris, has undergone a number of major taxonomic revisions. In 1982, P. vulgaris was separated into three biogroups on the basis of indole production. Biogroup one was indole negative and represented a new species, P. penneri, while biogroups two and three remained together as P. vulgaris.  Lab identification  According to laboratory fermentation tests, P. vulgaris ferments glucose and amygdalin, but does not ferment mannitol or lactose. P. vulgaris also tests positive for the methyl red (mixed acid fermentation) test and is also an extremely motile organism. When P. vulgaris is tested using the API 20E identification system it produces positive results for sulfur reduction, urease production, tryptophan deaminase production, indole production, sometimes positive gelatinase activity, and saccharose fermentation, and negative results for the remainder of the tests on the testing strip. It is referenced in the Analytical Profile Index using the nine-digit code: 047602157. The optimal growing conditions of this organism is in a facultative anaerobic environment with an average temperature of about 40 ¬∞C. The Becton/Dickinson BBL Enterotube II system for identification of members of the order Enterobacterales inoculated with P. vulgaris may yield the following results: *Positive for glucose fermentation (with gas production) *Negative for lysine and ornithine *Positive for hydrogen sulfide production and indole production *Negative for lactose, arabinose, adonitol, sorbitol and dulcitol *Positive for the phenylalanine test and the Harnstoff urea test P. vulgaris can test positive or negative for citrate. All combine for a Biocode ID of 31406, (Biocode ID 31402, 31404, 31407 all resulting in P. vulgaris with asymptomatic results) for use in the Interpretation Guide/Computer Coding and Identification System. P. vulgaris can also test urease negative in solid media (such as in Enterotube), but will be urease positive in liquid media. The CCIS code will still identify it with a negative urease test. When inoculated in a gelatin stab test, P. vulgaris is capable of hydrolysis of gelatin.  Proteus infections  = Cause and epidemiology = *Nosocomial infections *P. mirabilis causes 9% of Proteus infections. *P. vulgaris and P. penneri are easily isolated from individuals in long-term care facilities and hospitals and from patients with underlying diseases or compromised immune systems. *Patients with recurrent infections, those with structural abnormalities of the urinary tract, those who have had urethral instrumentation, and those whose infections were acquired in the hospital have an increased frequency of infection caused by Proteus and other organisms (e.g., Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, enterococci, and staphylococci). *P. vulgaris is highly resistant to antibiotics because of the plasmids present in the bacterium, making infections extremely difficult to cure. This is because the plasmids have varied drug resistant markers on them. = Clinical expression = Enterobacterales (of which Proteus is a member) and Pseudomonas species are the micro-organisms most commonly responsible for Gram-negative bacteremia and sepsis. The presence of the sepsis syndrome associated with a urinary tract infection (UTI) should raise the possibility of urinary tract obstruction. This is especially true of patients who reside in long-term care facilities, who have long-term indwelling urethral catheters, or who have a known history of urethral anatomic abnormalities. ;UTI obstruction Urease production leads to precipitation of organic and inorganic compounds, which leads to struvite stone formation. Struvite stones are composed of a combination of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium carbonate-apatite. Struvite stone formation can be sustained only when ammonia production is increased and the urine pH is elevated to decrease the solubility of phosphate. Both of these requirements can occur only when urine is infected with a urease-producing organism such as Proteus. Urease metabolizes urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide: urea 2 NH3 \\\\+ CO2. The ammonia/ammonium buffer pair has a pK of 9.0, resulting in the combination of highly alkaline, ammonia-rich urine. Symptoms attributable to struvite stones are uncommon. More often, women present with UTI, flank pain, or hematuria, and are found to have a persistently alkaline urine pH (>7.0).  Treatments  Antibiotics to which P. vulgaris is known to be sensitive: *Ciprofloxacin *Ceftazidime *Netilmicin *Sulbactam or cefoperazone *Meropenem *Piperacillin/tazobactam *Ampicillin/sulbactam See also * Proteus OX19 * Swarming motility References ‚ÄúProteus Vulgaris.‚Äù Thistle, Thistle.co, www.thistle.co.za/pdf_files/education/microbiology/microbiology_legends/Cycle_41/Cycle%2041%20Organism%203%20-%20Proteus%20Vulgaris.pdf.

During his tenure, he served as the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He was a member of the Democratic Party. On November 2, 2010, he lost his seat to Republican Vicky Hartzler amid a Republican wave. Notably, he was one of three Democratic committee chairmen to lose reelection in the 2010 midterm cycle, alongside House Budget Committee chairman John Spratt of South Carolina and House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee chairman Jim Oberstar of Minnesota. Early life, education and career Skelton was born in Lexington, Missouri, a rural town with extensive Civil War history. He was the son of Carolyn Marie (Boone) and Isaac Newton Skelton III. In 1928, Skelton's father met Harry S. Truman, then a Jackson County judge, and the men became good friends. When he was 17, Skelton attended Truman's 1949 inauguration. Skelton was an Eagle Scout. He earned an associate of arts degree from Wentworth Military Academy and College in 1951, an A.B. in 1953 and an LL.B. in 1956 from the University of Missouri. He is a brother of Sigma Chi and Alpha Phi Omega at the University of Missouri. He also attended the University of Edinburgh in Scotland in 1953. Skelton then became a lawyer and entered private practice in Lafayette County, Missouri. He was a prosecuting attorney from 1957 until 1960 and a special assistant attorney general. Missouri Senate Skelton was a member of the Missouri Senate, representing Lafayette County, from 1971 until 1977. U.S. House of Representatives Inaugural Congressional photo of Skelton from the 1977 Congressional Pictorial Directory. =Committee assignments= *Committee on Armed Services (Chairman) As chairman of the full committee, Skelton served as an ex officio member of all subcommittees. Skelton served as Chair of the House Armed Services Committee, having previously served as Ranking Member on the House Armed Services Committee since 1998 but was promoted to Chairman following the 2006 midterm elections when Democrats regained control of Congress. Political positions Skelton voted with Democratic leadership 94.6% of the time during the 111th Congress, meaning he broke with his party more frequently than 82% of the Democratic Caucus. Vicky Hartzler, Skelton's 2010 Congressional opponent, stated on the campaign trail that Skelton has voted in line with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 95% of the time during his tenure in the House. Before the 2006 election, Skelton told columnist George Will that if the Democrats won control of Congress, his main priority would be \\"oversight, oversight, oversight!\\" While he voted for the War in Iraq, he expressed serious misgivings about troop readiness. In 2006, he favored reducing the number of troops in Iraq and supported redeploying a brigade from Iraq to Kuwait. Will suggested that under Skelton, the Armed Services Committee would resemble a U.S. Senate committee created to examine defense spending during World War II. This committee was chaired by Skelton's hero, Harry S. Truman. =Fiscal issues= Skelton voted against the 2001 Bush Tax cuts.http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll149.xml In 1981, he voted against Reagan's tax cuts. He was supportive of labor. The League of Conservation Voters rated Skelton at 53 percent on environmental issues. He was one of the few Congressional Democrats to vote in favor of CAFTA and mostly supported free trade deals. He was a supporter of TRiO programs. =Social issues= Skelton was fairly conservative on social issues. He opposed abortion and gun control. He helped craft the Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, and voted against its repeal in 2010. =Military issues= Skelton was a long-time proponent of the Missouri National Guard, in recognition for which the National Guard Training Center in Jefferson City is named in his honor. However, at times he has disagreed with other members of Missouri's congressional delegation over the state's defense installations. In 2005, for instance, he opposed Senator Kit Bond's efforts to keep open the 131st Air National Guard Fighter Wing in St. Louis County. The wing was considered an \\"alert site\\" by the Defense Department, responsible for maintaining sovereignty over United States air space. In its final report, the 9/11 Commission found that the lack of alert sites, and with their positions primarily on the nation's periphery, reduced the capability of the military to respond effectively to the 9/11 attacks. Senator Bond testified in the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) hearings against the closure of the 131st, which was based at Lambert International Airport. He noted that this wing, which was located in a strategically important location, had protected critical assets on 09-11-01. He warned that the loss of the wing would compromise security over a vast area of the Midwestern United States. Representative Skelton, as the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, voted in favor of closure.http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll548.xml The House passed the BRAC recommendations, and the base was subsequently closed, with its components deployed elsewhere. Controversy On October 8, 2009, Skelton, after addressing fellow Missouri Congressman Todd Akin, a Republican, on the House floor, said to Akin, \\"stick it up your ass.\\" The comment was picked up by the microphone and could be heard on the C-SPAN broadcast. Skelton's spokeswoman, Jennifer Kohl, said the comment was not intended to be broadcast and was \\"said out of frustration in the heat of debate.\\" Akin's spokesman, Steve Taylor, said the remark was \\"shocking and not characteristic of Skelton's behavior.\\" Political campaigns When William J. Randall retired after 17 years in the U.S. House of Representatives, Skelton won the Democratic nomination to succeed him with 40% of the vote in a crowded primary field of nine Democratic candidates. He ran with the endorsement of Truman's widow, Bess, which he attributes to his own father's support for Harry S. Truman in the 1940 U.S. Senate primary. He was reelected 16 times, usually by well over 60 percent of the vote. Before 2010, he only faced one truly serious challenge, in 1982. That year, Missouri lost a district, and Skelton's district was merged with the neighboring 8th District, represented by freshman Republican Wendell Bailey. Although Skelton retained almost 60 percent of his former territory, Bailey held him to 54 percent of the vote. =2010= Skelton seemed to have a fairly secure hold on his district, even though it had been trending Republican for some time. The rural areas of the district, once solidly Democratic, had turned increasingly Republican since the turn of the century. Indeed, in 2000, Republicans captured most of the area's legislative seats and have held them ever since. Even before then, the district had been shedding more of the strongly Democratic areas near Kansas City due to that city's dwindling population. Before 1983, it stretched as far west as Independence, on Kansas City's eastern border. As a result, it had been pushed further into heavily Republican Southwest Missouri. Al Gore, John Kerry and Barack Obama all won less than 40 percent of the vote in the district even as Skelton skated to reelection. It was considered very likely that Skelton would be succeeded by a Republican once he retired. In 2010, Skelton faced former Republican state representative Vicky Hartzler, who had been out of politics for more than a decade. Polls consistently showed a very competitive race, easily the most competitive the district had seen in decades. Most pundits rated it as a toss-up. Skelton lost to Hartzler, 50 percent to 45 percent. While Skelton ran evenly with Hartzler in the areas closer to Kansas City, he lost badly in the rural areas, including some that had supported him for many years. Since then, no Democrat has managed as much as 40 percent of the vote. Awards and honors In 2005 the U S Navy Memorial Foundation awarded Skelton its Naval Heritage award for his support of the U S Navy and military during his years in Congress. In 2010, Skelton was recognized by then, Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James F. Amos, as an Honorary Marine, the first U.S. congressman to be awarded the title.http://www.marines.mil/Community- Relations/Outreach-Programs/Honorary-Marine/ In 2012, the United States Military Academy recognized Skelton with the Sylvanus Thayer Award. In the same year, the USAF Air University presented Skelton with an honorary Doctor of Law degree for his work in the advancement of military education. Personal life His wife of 44 years, Susan Anding Skelton, died on August 23, 2005. Later that year, on November 26, Skelton was injured when a van carrying him and fellow U.S. Representatives Tim Murphy and Jim Marshall overturned near Baghdad Airport while on an official visit to Iraq. Skelton and Murphy were airlifted to a U.S. Military hospital in Germany after complaining of neck pain. Both made a full recovery. On August 29, 2009, Skelton married Patty Martin, a longtime friend and widowed middle school counselor from his home town. Skelton was a member of the Christian Church and an honorary chieftain in Scouting's Tribe of Mic-O-Say. He was also of distant relation to Daniel Boone as well as to U.S. Representative Louise Slaughter of New York.Barone & Cohen, 2008 Almanac of American Politics, p.958 = Death = Skelton died of pneumonia at Virginia Hospital Center in Arlington, Virginia on October 28, 2013, at the age of 81.

Introduced by M√§rklin in 1972, Z scale trains operate on 0-10 volts DC and offer the same operating characteristics as all other two-rail, direct-current, analog model railways. Locomotives can be fitted with digital decoders for independent control. Model trains, track, structures, and human/animal figures are readily available in European, North American, and Japanese styles from a variety of manufacturers.  History  The sugar-cube sized electric motor in a Z scale model locomotive. The entire engine is only long. Z scale was introduced by the German model train manufacturer M√§rklin in 1972 at the Nuremberg Toy Fair. It was the brainchild of Helmut Killian, M√§rklin's head design engineer at the time. The letter Z was chosen to designate the new scale, its place as the last character of the German and English alphabets signaling the thought that there would never be a smaller commercial model railway scale. While there have been attempts since then to bring even smaller scales to the market, they remain niche products without a wider followingthe largest market being T gauge (1:450, gauge), designed in Japan and manufactured in China. Originally running on 8 V DC, track voltage was increased to 10 V DC around the year 2000. Accessory power has always been 10 V AC. In 1978, a M√§rklin Z scale locomotive pulling six coaches made its entry into the Guinness Book of World Records by running nonstop for 1,219 hours, and travelling a distance of before the train stopped due to failure of the motor. Z scale, at its inception, was predominantly a European scale, but it has an increasing number of followers in other parts of the world. There are now also manufacturers in North America and Japan and China, among others. Z scale enthusiasts throughout Europe, North America, and Japan participate regularly at most national and regional model railroad exhibitions and shows, where they have demonstrated the outstanding operation and layout design characteristics of the scale. While prices were initially higher for Z scale products (particularly locomotives) compared with those available in larger scales, as volume production, computer-aided design and manufacturing techniques, and the number of competing manufacturers increased, prices have come down to a point comparable to those of high-quality models in other scales. As early as 1988, M√§rklin announced their intention to offer digital train control systems in Z scale, and M√§rklin's 1988 Z scale product catalog listed three locomotives with a built-in digital decoder. However, the technology was not developed enough, and the manufacturer had to cancel these plans, mainly due to heat dissipation problems in locomotive decoders. Since then, these problems have been solved, Z scale has embraced advanced electronics (e.g., microprocessors originally developed for cell phones, surface-mount technology, etc.), and an increasing number of modellers have converted their locomotives to use third party digital model train control systems. The first attempts to use digital system in Z scale were based on NEM standard, Selectrix, which offered the smallest decoders in the market, with thicknesses of less than 2 mm. German company M√ºt brought also the first digital control central unit designed specially for Z scale in the market in the early 2000s. Use of the popular National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) Digital Command Control (DCC) standard has expanded substantially in Z scale recently as locomotive decoders with sizes comparable to the sizes of smallest Selectrix decoders have become available. Z scale is now a mature modelling scale, with model locomotives, rolling stock, buildings, signalling and human and animal figures becoming available in increasing numbers from an expanding variety of established and particularly smaller, fast-growing manufacturers. Z scale layouts have been winning local, regional, and national level competitions, such as best of show at the NMRA National Train Show (NTS) in July 2001, in St. Louis, MO.Photo, 2001 NTS Best of Show, NMRA.org and Jeffrey MacHan  Advantages  A \\"night shot\\" of a coffee-table sized Z scale layout The diminutive size of Z scale makes it possible to fit more scale space into the same physical layout as would be used by larger-scale models. Z scale can also be beneficial when there is a need to build very compact train layouts, such as novelty setups in briefcases, guitar cases, or jewellery boxes. Several transportation museums, for instance, have used Z scale to present real world railway scenes. Z scale allows longer trains and broader, more realistic curves than is practical in larger scales.  Drawbacks  \\"Val Ease East\\" division yard scene showing scratch-built Russell snow plow and detailed Mogul on the turntable. Due to the small size of Z scale and, in particular, the low weight of the locomotives (a small Z scale engine can weigh as little as ), it can be challenging to ensure reliable operation. In particular, the track must be kept clean, as minuscule particles of dust, dirt, or corrosion can easily stop locomotives. Poorly-installed trackwork can be a source of consistent derailing of rolling stock (although this is true, to some extent, in any scale). All of this can create issues for modellers who are interested in prototypical operationsin particular, switching. The low weight of Z scale locomotives contributes to their difficulty pulling trains up grades. In practice, the grade is kept under 2% for reliable operation of trains up to seven, four-axle cars; shorter trains can operate on grades up to 4%. Pulling power of locomotives can be increased by use of traction tires, or by adding weight using high-density materialtungsten powder (used in metal golf club driver heads) and lead are popular choices.Improving Locomotive Traction, Zscale.org The smaller market for Z scale results in a limited range of available products, including both rolling stock and accessories; some of the demand is therefore met by cottage industries.  Manufacturers  * The originator of Z scale, German manufacturer M√§rklin, still dominates the market for European prototype trains. M√§rklin couplers are unrealistic but can be easily coupled and uncoupled. * Micro-Trains Line (MTL) of Talent, Oregon, has joined M√§rklin as a major Z scale manufacturer and supplier of Z scale model locomotives, rolling stock, structures, and complete set track systems specializing in North American prototypes. MTL uses Magnematic couplers that can be uncoupled magnetically and enable operations that mimic prototype railroad activities such as delivering or picking up empty or loaded rail cars, building trains in classification yards, etc. Other manufacturers use fixed couplers that cannot be manipulated in this way. There is a growing number of smaller manufacturers, both in Europe and in North America, of Z scale specialty items such as detail parts, electronics, track-building aids, structures, scratch-building supplies, and tools in addition to rolling stock. * In addition to custom Z scale rolling stock for European, Japanese, and North American modelers, the German company Freudenreich Feinwerktechnik (FR) has introduced a complete narrow-gauge Z scale system with gauge track, which corresponds with metre gauge in prototype and is designated as Zm scale following the NEM standard scale naming system. * American Z Line (AZL) is a growing manufacturer producing a variety of highly detailed injection-molded North American prototype diesel locomotives and rolling stock as well as limited-run brass model steam and diesel locomotives. AZL has produced the largest variety of North American prototype locomotives and rolling stock available. * Rokuhan, a Japanese company, produces Japanese prototype rolling stock as well as structures, accessories, and a complete line of track products with simulated wooden and concrete ties suitable for North American themed model railroads. * Atlas produces two foot (610mm) long Z scale flex track and number 6 switches with North American tie spacing (closer than European because North American rail cars are heavier). * Peco produces three foot (914mm) long Z scale flex track with European tie spacing.

Introduced in September 2002, Roombas feature a set of sensors that enable them to navigate the floor area of a home and clean it. For instance, Roombas' sensors can detect the presence of obstacles, detect dirty spots on the floor, and sense steep drops to keep them from falling down stairs. The Roomba units have a range of models which provide several different features, such as tangle-free brushes, separate sweep canister, a more powerful vacuum, obstacle avoidance, or performance maps displayed via a smartphone app. However, some parts of the Roomba models are interchangeable between related models, allowing a mix/match of features, or switching into other units for longer battery operation. Newer high-end models also feature a camera, which works in conjunction with onboard mapping and navigation software to systematically cover all floor area, move from room to room, and find recharging bases and beacons. Additionally, some Roomba units can be adapted to perform other more creative tasks using an embedded computer in conjunction with the Roomba Open Interface.  Description  Various Roomba internal parts Roomba recharging. Most Roomba models are disc-shaped, measuring in diameter and high depending on the model. The ninth generation S series are D-shaped rather than circular, with the flat part of the D at the front, and are narrower at wide. A large contact-sensing mechanical bumper is mounted on the front half of all Roombas, with an omnidirectional infrared sensor at its top front center. A recessed carrying handle is fitted on the top of most models. First- and second-generation Roombas are compatible with the Virtual Wall, an accessory used to prevent a Roomba from entering an area. The Virtual Wall projects a signal in a straight line (actually a thin fan or cone shape) using infrared light, which Roombas detect and treat the same as a physical wall, prompting them to stop and turn around. Third-generation and newer models are compatible with the Dual Mode Virtual Wall, which in addition to a straight line wall can also create a circular barrier roughly in diameter. Some 500-, 700- and 800-series models are compatible with the Virtual Wall Lighthouse. This initially confines a Roomba to one area to be cleaned like a Virtual Wall, and once the Roomba reports the area has been sufficiently cleaned (based on its estimated area) allows the Roomba to proceed to the next space which needs to be cleaned, and contains the Roomba to the new area.  Operation  Long exposure photo showing path taken by a Roomba as it cleans All Roomba models can be operated by manually carrying them to the room to be cleaned and pressing a button. Later models introduced several additional operating modes, such as \\"Spot\\" which cleans an area of a few feet and \\"Max\\" which cleans endlessly until the battery is depleted. \\"Dock\\" mode, introduced with the third generation, instructs the Roomba to seek a charging base for recharging. The availability of the modes varies by model. Many second- and third-generation Roombas come packaged with infrared remote controls, allowing a human operator to \\"drive\\" the Roomba to areas to be specially cleaned. Roombas are driven by two independently-operating side wheels, which can drive the Roomba forwards and backwards as well as perform turns of any radius, including 360¬∞ turns in place. Rotary encoders on the wheels can detect the rate at which the wheels are spinning so it can determine if they're slipping or stuck, and drop sensors detect if a wheel is too low (such as getting stuck in a vent). An undriven swivel caster (located at the front of most models, and at the back of the D-shaped S series) is used not for steering, as is often believed, but as an additional sensor. It too is a rotary encoder; the caster's wheel is half black and half white, and optical sensors detect the change in color as it rotates. This helps detect if the Roomba is stuck or beached (i.e., the drive wheels are spinning but the Roomba isn't moving). The cleaning head (brushes and suction area) on Roombas is relatively small. On most models, it is between the two side wheels, and is around wide; on the S series, it is moved to the flat square part of the D shape near the front where it is wider, but still does not extend the full width of the vehicle. To compensate for this, Roombas have a rotating multi- pronged brush on one side which sweeps debris towards the path of the cleaning head, helping to clean a wider path and to reach into edges and corners. Roombas before the seventh-generation models do not map out the rooms they are cleaning. Instead, iRobot developed a technology called iAdapt Responsive Cleaning Technology. This relies on a few simple algorithms, such as spiraling, room crossing, wall following, and random walk angle changing after bumping into an object or wall. This design is based on MIT researcher and iRobot CTO Rodney Brooks's philosophy that robots should be like insects, equipped with simple control mechanisms tuned to their environments. The result is that although Roombas are effective at cleaning rooms, they take several times longer to do the job than a human would. The Roomba may cover some areas many times, other areas only once or twice, and may miss some areas. However, the random algorithm has been shown to effectively cover rooms of various sizes and configurations, particularly when used repeatedly for maintenance cleaning. (Some users have used long-exposure photography or compositing to create images showing Roombas' coverage of the floor, and have even attached light sources to Roombas to create art using light painting. Some have also noted that doubts about the effectiveness of the random algorithms have been assuaged by multiple reports of Roombas rolling over dog feces and spreading it through the room, which rather unpleasantly illustrate how well the Roomba can cover the floor's area.) Roombas have become a common example of how randomized algorithms can probabilistically succeed even though they cannot absolutely guarantee success on any single run or even after many repeated runs. Compared to competing products available when Roombas were first introduced such as the Electrolux Trilobite, the effectiveness of Roombas' random navigation was on par with (or even more effective than) robotic mapping technology available at the time, and being cheaper to develop and produce, could be offered at a significantly lower price. Starting with the seventh generation, Roombas have an upwards-facing camera and a downward facing infrared floor-tracking sensor which are used to create a map of the floor. This enables them to use a more efficient back-and-forth cleaning pattern, which is faster and more efficient as it ensures more complete coverage without needing to cover an area multiple times. The floor-tracking sensor operates like an optical mouse and can provide precise movement data over small distances, but suffers from integration drift: small errors in measurement which accumulate over time. To rectify this, the upwards-facing camera is used periodically to identify waypoints or \\"landmarks\\", coarse points that are used to correct the Roombas' position and map. Some algorithms such as wall following are still used, partly to assist in mapping the floor and also simply to make sure the floor is cleaned along the edge and around obstacles. Unlike other mapping systems like lidar which can operate in complete darkness, Roombas' camera requires some light in the room in order to be able to map it. Starting with the eighth generation, Roombas retain the map after each run, and use subsequent runs to improve the map. Multiple maps can be stored, and users can edit maps to separate and label regions (such as rooms), which can be used to have the Roomba clean only a selected room. The Roombas' bumper allows them to sense when they have bumped into an obstacle, after which they will reverse or change paths. Infrared \\"cliff sensors\\" on the bottom of Roombas similarly prevent them from falling off ledges such as stairways. (These may also trigger a false positive on dark or black colored surfaces such as some carpets, preventing Roombas from entering or being able to clean those areas.) Third-generation and newer models have additional forward-looking infrared sensors to detect obstacles. These slow down the Roomba when nearing obstacles, to reduce its force of impact. It's also used to clean alongside walls without bumping into the wall repeatedly. This technology is also able to distinguish between hard and soft obstacles. Most second- and third-generation models and all newer ones have internal acoustic- based dirt sensors that allow them to detect particularly dirty spots and focus on those areas accordingly. Fourth-generation and newer models have an optical sensor located in front of the vacuum bin, allowing detection of wider and smaller messes. The cleaning time depends on room size and, for models equipped with dirt sensors, volume of dirt. First-generation models must be told the room size, while subsequent models either estimate room size by measuring the longest straight-line run they can perform without bumping into an object or create an accurate map of the room. When finished cleaning, or when the battery is nearly depleted, Roombas except for first-generation models will try to return to a base if one is detected. Roombas with mapping capability can also recharge and resume a cleaning job, enabling them to clean large areas that take more than one full battery of charge to complete. Roombas except for first-generation models also support scheduling, allowing cleaning to start at the time of day and on days of the week that the owner desires. Most 500-series models support scheduling through buttons on the unit itself, and higher-end models allow the use of a remote control, smartphone app, or smarthome automation integration to program schedules. Roombas are not designed for deep-pile carpet. Also, the first- and second-generation Roombas can get stuck on rug tassels and electrical cords. Third-generation and newer models are able to reverse their brushes to escape entangled cords and tassels. All models are designed to be low enough to go under a bed or most other items of furniture. If at any time the unit senses that it has become stuck, no longer senses the floor beneath it, or decides that it has worked its way into a narrow area from which it is unable to escape, it stops and sounds an error to help someone find it. Early models use only flashing lights to indicate specific problems, while later models use a synthesized voice to announce a problem and a suggested solution. =Maintenance= Roombas require regular cleaning and maintenance. Because they are smaller and less powerful than large upright vacuums, the dustbin must be emptied frequently (sometimes as often as every single use), and hair and other obstructions must be removed from rollers and brushes more frequently. Some reviewers have complained about this necessity compared to traditional upright vacuums that only need infrequent cleaning and almost no maintenance; however others have countered that the chore is not difficult, and that it takes significantly less time to clean a Roomba than it does to vacuum by hand. iRobot has been praised for the availability of replacement parts for Roombas, with official parts still being sold for every model including the first-generation Roombas, almost 20 years after their release. Roombas are powered by a user-replaceable rechargeable battery; older models used NiMH batteries, while newer models use lithium-ion batteries, and a few models support both. First-generation models must be recharged from a wall power adapter, while all subsequent models have a self- charging homebase that the unit seeks out at the end of a cleaning session via infrared beacons. Charging takes about three hours. =Connectivity= As opposed to hacking and extending Roomba, non Desktop users can use the iRobot HOME App, although only certain models support 5 GHz. = Battery life = Battery reliability is a frequently mentioned complaint on customer review websites. Battery replacements from iRobot cost a significant fraction of the purchase price of a new Roomba, though compatible third-party batteries are available at a lower price. The iRobot customer support website offers advice on maximizing battery performance and longevity.  Models  there have been nine generations of Roomba units. All models have a patented design using pair of brushes or rollers, rotating in opposite directions, to pick up debris from the floor. In some models, the brushes are followed by a squeegee vacuum, which directs the airflow through a narrow slit to increase its speed in order to collect fine dust. A horizontally mounted \\"side spinner\\" brush on the right side of the unit sweeps against walls to reach debris not accessible by the main brushes and vacuum. In the first generation, the dirty air passes through the fan before reaching the filter, while later models use a fan-bypass vacuum. = First generation: Original series = Introduced in September 2002, the first-generation Roomba had three buttons for room size. The first- generation units comprised the original silver-colored Roomba, the blue Roomba Pro, and the maroon Roomba Pro Elite. The later two models included additional accessories, but all three used the same core robot and cleaning system. = Second generation: Discovery and 400 series = The second-generation Roombas (\\"Discovery\\", later called 400 series) replaced their predecessors in July 2004, added a larger dust bin, improved software that calculates room size, dirt detection, and fast charging in the home base. Room size is detected automatically based on the longest straight-line path that can be driven; instead of buttons for room size, their buttons are \\"Clean\\", \\"Spot\\", and \\"Max\\". Roomba budget models (Dirt Dog and Model 401) used a simplified interface (a single \\"Clean\\" button) and lacked some of the software-controlled flexibility of other versions. They were less expensive models intended for first-time purchasers. The Roomba Dirt Dog contained sweeping brushes and a larger dust bin, but lacked the vacuum motor, using the space that would be required for the vacuum for additional dust bin volume. It was designed for a home shop or garage environment. The Roomba Model 401 was similar but had a standard-size dust bin and vacuum system. The Dirt Dog was discontinued in 2010. = Third generation: Professional and 500 series = The 500 series was introduced in August 2007 and featured a forward-looking infrared sensor to detect obstacles and reduce speed, a docking command button, improved mechanical components, smoother operation, and a modular design to facilitate part replacement. The Roombas' speed is also increased, which is possible in part because of the sensors to avoid bumping into obstacles too hard. It also introduced customizable decorative face plates. The Roomba 530 included two virtual walls and a recharging dock. There are several types of dust and debris collection bins for the 500 series models. The standard vacuum bin incorporates a squeegee vacuum. The high-capacity sweeper bin does not include a vacuum, but has greater debris capacity. The AeroVac Bin directs suction airflow through the main brushes instead of using a squeegee, which is thought to keep the brushes cleaner. = Fourth generation: 600 series= In August 2012, the 500 series was superseded by the 600 series, which added the AeroVac Bin and advanced cleaning head as standard features. In 2017 they released the 690, which has Wi-Fi connectivity so it can be started with an app and various personal-assistant software. = Fifth generation: 700 series = The 701 series, introduced in May 2011, though largely similar to the 500 and 600 series, included a more robust cleaning system, improved AeroVac Bin with HEPA filter, and improved battery life. Like the 500 series, the 700 series had models with different technologies and accessories. The Roomba 760 was the simplest model, and Roomba 790 was the , with both scheduling and a large range of accessories including lighthouses, wireless command center (also compatible with select retrofitted 500-series models), and extra brushes and filters. Besides these two models, Roomba 770 and 780 were available, with scheduling, Dirt Detect, and full bin indicator. = Sixth generation: 800 series = The 800 series, introduced in 2013, is similar to the 700 series and its predecessors, but contains updated technology. The AeroForce Performance Cleaning System, which is five times more powerful than older series, and the iRobot XLife battery are some of the new features. The AeroForce system does away with the large rotating brush, and pulls air between two rubber rollers, thereby getting the vacuum suction closer to the floor. In 2017 iRobot released the 890 with Wi-Fi connectivity that can be started with an app and various personal-assistant software. = Seventh generation: 900 series = The Roomba 980 was released in September 2015, and contains a new visual simultaneous localization and mapping (vSLAM) navigation system,\\"Roomba 1,000,000 and 980\\". Leads Rating, January 04, 2017, by Jeremy Jauncey which allows it to clean an entire level of a home more efficiently. The 980 also features Wi-Fi connectivity and an iPhone and Android app. The Roomba 960 was released on August 4, 2016. As of March 29, 2017, 900 series users can receive detailed cleaning maps of their Roomba through the app. The maps show exact areas of clean and dirty spots in the home, allowing the Roomba to know where it needs to spend more time cleaning. However, the maps are not retained between cleaning runs, and each time the Roomba is run it builds a new map from scratch. Push notifications of when the Roomba is finished cleaning is also a new feature. Integration to Amazon's Echo was also announced, launching in spring 2017. = Eighth generation: I series and E series = In September 2018, iRobot introduced a new Roomba series with three models: the premium i7 and i7+ and the more basic e5. The i7 models use the same motor as the 980 but feature updated brush extractors and Imprint Smart Map navigation. This feature retains the map after the Roomba has run, and uses subsequent runs to improve the map. This lets users select which room for Roomba to clean from the iRobot Home app. The i7+ features the Clean Base, a self-emptying base that empties the Roomba's bin when it docks using a powerful vacuum. iRobot claims that the base can empty the Roomba's bin up to 30 cleaning cycles. The Clean Base uses a disposable bag. The basic e5 Roomba replaces the 800 series with an improved battery life from 60 to 90 minutes of run time on hardwood floors using a lithium-ion battery. = Ninth generation: S series = In late May 2019, iRobot introduced the Roomba s9 and s9+ as the \\"smartest, most powerful robot vacuum yet\\". The S series features a newly designed \\"D\\" shape and corner brush for optimized edge cleaning deep into corners and along edges. Other new features include an anti-allergen system that traps 99% of pollen, mold and allergens, compared to the 600 series, 30% wider rubber brushes, and the most advanced navigation system to date. Similar to the I series, the s9+ comes with the self-emptying Clean Base. The S series also includes linking technology that allows the Roomba to communicate wirelessly with other iRobot products, where the Braava Jet M6 can automatically be set to mop after the s9 has finished vacuuming.  Hacking and extending Roomba  A hacked Roomba drawing a Spirograph-like pattern From the earliest models on, Roomba vacuum cleaning robots have been hacked to extend their functionality. The first adaptations were based on a microcontroller that was directly connected to the motor drivers and sensors. Versions manufactured after October 2005 contain an electronic and software interface that allows hackers to more easily control or modify behavior and remotely monitor its sensors. One early application was using the device to map a room. The native code for Roomba is written in a dialect of Lisp. Models with an interface (400 series since October 2007 plus 500 and 700 series) come with a Mini-DIN connector supporting a serial interface, which is electrically and physically incompatible with standard PC/Mac serial ports and cables. However, third-party adapters are available to access the Roomba's computer via Bluetooth, USB, or RS-232 (PC/Mac serial). Roombas pre-October 2005 upgraded with the OSMO hacker device allow monitoring many sensors and modifying the unit's behavior. The Roomba Open Interface (OI, formerly Roomba Serial Command Interface) allows programmers and roboticists to create their own enhancements. Several projects are described on Roomba hacking sites. In response to the growing interest of hackers in their product, the company developed the iRobot Create. In this model the vacuum cleaner motor is replaced by a \\"cargo bay\\" for mounting devices like TV cameras, lasers and other robotic parts. It provides a greatly enhanced 25-pin interface providing both analog and digital bidirectional communication with the hosted device allowing use as the mobile base for completely new robots. Together with a computing platform like a netbook or handheld device with wireless networking, it can be remotely controlled through a network.

Peters' book popularized the term \\"blue laws\\", referring to laws restricting activities on Sunday. Background Peters was an Anglican priest hostile to the cause of American independence and had been forced to flee to London in late 1774, shortly before the Revolutionary War began; he made up 45 harsh laws as a hoax to discredit America as backwards and fanatical, and in 1781 published them in a book called A General History of Connecticut, which contains numerous other tall tales. According to Peters the blue laws \\"were never suffered to be printed\\", but especially in the 19th century they were confused with the Code of 1650 of the colonists of Connecticut and with the statutes drafted in 1655 by Governor Theophilus Eaton for the then unconnected Colony of New Haven, for which he drew on the writings of the Reverend John Cotton and the laws of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and which were printed in London in blue covers for the use of the colonists. Peters was probably the first to popularize the term \\"blue laws\\". Its etymology is unclear, but he implied a relationship to the expletive \\"bloody\\", saying that they \\"were very properly termed Blue Laws, i.e. Bloody Laws, for they were all sanctified with excommunication, confiscation, fines, banishment, whippings, cutting off the ears, burning the tongue, and death.\\" Supposed Connecticut Blue Laws #The Governor and Magistrates convened in general Assembly, are the supreme power under God of this independent Dominion. # From the determination of the Assembly no appeal shall be made. # The Governor is amenable to the voice of the people. #The Governor shall have only a single vote in determining any question; except a casting vote, when the Assembly may be equally divided. #The Assembly of the People shall not be dismissed by the Governor, but shall dismiss itself. #Conspiracy against this Dominion shall be punished with death. #Whoever says there is power and jurisdiction above and over this Dominion, shall suffer death and loss of property. #Whoever attempts to change or overturn this Dominion, shall suffer death. #The judges shall determine controversies without a jury #No one shall be a freeman, or give a vote, unless he be converted, and a member in full communion of one of the Churches allowed in this Dominion. #No man shall hold any office, who is not sound in the faith, and faithful to this Dominion; and whoever gives a vote to such a person, shall pay a fine of ¬£1; for a second offence, he shall be disfranchised. #Each freeman shall swear by the blessed God to bear true allegiance to this Dominion, and that Jesus Christ is the only King. #No quaker or dissenter from the established worship of this Dominion shall be allowed to give a vote for the election of Magistrates, or any officer. #No food or lodging shall be afforded to a Quaker, Adamite, or other Heretic. #If any person turns Quaker, he shall be banished, and not suffered to return but upon pain of death. #No Priest shall abide in this Dominion: he shall be banished, and suffer death on his return.

Boston: Western Islands Publishers, 1969; pp. 452‚Äì454. From 1927 to 1938, McWilliams practiced law in Los Angeles at Black, Hammock & Black. Some of his cases, including his defense of striking Mexican citrus workers, prefigured his later writing. During the 1920s and early 1930s, McWilliams joined a loose network of mostly Southern California writers that included Robinson Jeffers, John Fante, Louis Adamic, and Upton Sinclair. His literary career also benefited greatly from his relationships with Mary Austin and H.L. Mencken. Mencken provided an outlet for McWilliams's early journalism and floated the idea for his first book, a 1929 biography of popular writer and sometime Californian Ambrose Bierce. Political activity The Depression and the rise of European fascism in the 1930s radicalized McWilliams. He began working with left-wing political and legal organizations, including the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild. He also wrote for Pacific Weekly, Controversy, The Nation, and other progressive magazines. He continued to represent workers in and around Los Angeles, helped organize unions and guilds, and served as a trial examiner for the new National Labor Relations Board. His first bestseller, Factories in the Field, appeared in 1939 and ranks among his most enduring works. Published within months of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, it examines the lives of migrant farm workers in California and condemns the politics and consequences of California agricultural land monopoly and large-scale agribusiness. Shortly before its publication, McWilliams accepted an offer from incoming Governor Culbert Olson to head California's Division of Immigration and Housing. Over his four-year term (1938-1942), he focused on improving agricultural working conditions and wages, but his hopes for major reform deteriorated with the advent of World War II. During the 1940s, McWilliams lived in Echo Park, California, a neighborhoodhttp://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/region/central-la/ of Los Angeles. He owned his home at 2041 Alvarado Street until the 1970s, well after he moved to New York in 1951. McWilliams left his government post in 1942, when incoming Governor Earl Warren promised campaign audiences that his first official act would be to fire him. McWilliams was a sharp critic of Warren, whom he described as \\"the personification of Smart Reaction,\\" but he became an enthusiastic admirer after Warren joined the US Supreme Court the following decade. No such conversion occurred in his attitude toward another California politician, Richard Nixon, whom McWilliams described in 1950 as \\"a dapper little man with an astonishing capacity for petty malice.\\" After leaving the state government, McWilliams continued to write prolifically. He turned his attention to issues of racial and ethnic equality, writing a series of important books (including Brothers Under the Skin, Prejudice, North from Mexico, and A Mask for Privilege) that dealt with the treatment of immigrant and minority groups. He also produced two regional portraits, Southern California Country: An Island on the Land (1946, American Folkways series) and California: The Great Exception (1949), which many aficionados still regard as the finest interpretive histories of those areas. Decades after its publication, Southern California Country inspired Robert Towne's Oscar-winning original screenplay for Chinatown (1974). Accusations of communist sympathies Witch Hunt (1950) was an early attempt to combat McCarthyism, which McWilliams considered a grave threat to civil liberties and healthy politics. Although he was never a member of the Communist Party, he was a frequent target of anticommunist attacks. In the 1940s, he was called before the Committee on Un-American Activities in California. FBI director J. Edgar Hoover placed him on the Custodial Detention List, making him a candidate for detention in case of national emergency even though McWilliams was serving in the state government at the time. His activism took many forms. In the early 1940s, he helped overturn the convictions of mostly Latino youths following the so-called Sleepy Lagoon murder trial. He also helped cool the city's temperature during the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943, when scuffles between servicemen and Latino youths spun out of control. Once out of government, he became an outspoken critic of the removal and internment of Japanese American citizens and almost immediately began writing an expos√© on the topic. Published in 1944, Prejudice: Japanese-Americans: Symbol of Race Hatred was cited repeatedly in the sole dissenting opinion in Korematsu v. United States, the Supreme Court decision that upheld the constitutionality of the exclusion. Several years later, a group of Los Angeles screenwriters, directors, and producers known as the Hollywood Ten was cited for contempt of Congress after refusing to answer a House committee's questions about Communist Party membership. McWilliams drafted a Supreme Court amicus brief for two of them, John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo. (The Court declined to hear their appeal.) In 1951, McWilliams moved to New York City to work at The Nation under editor Freda Kirchwey. For the next decade, he helped shepherd the magazine through its most difficult period. Taking over as editor in 1955, he stayed until 1975 and is credited with strengthening the magazine's investigative reporting. He also published the early work of Ralph Nader, Howard Zinn, Theodore Roszak, and Hunter S. Thompson, who credited McWilliams with the idea for his first bestselling book, Hell's Angels: A Strange and Terrible Saga (1966). McWilliams and Bay of Pigs story McWilliams was the first American reporter to reveal that the CIA was training a group of Cuban exiles in Guatemala for the Bay of Pigs Invasion.Carey McWilliams, The Education of Carey McWilliams 228 (Simon & Schuster 1978). His article for The Nation, \\"Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas?\\", was published in November 1960, five months before the invasion occurred, during the Eisenhower Administration.Are We Training Cuban Guerrillas?, 191 The Nation 378 (November 19, 1960). The story was largely ignored by major newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post.Montague Kern et al., The Kennedy Crises: The Press, The Presidency and Foreign Policy 105-06 (Univ. of N.C. Press 1983). Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., an aide to President John F. Kennedy, pressured The New Republic not to run a story about the guerrilla force.Id. Following the failure of the invasion, Kennedy expressed regret that more information about the invasion plan was not published by telling Times reporter Turner Catledge, \\"If you had printed more about the operation, you would have saved us from a colossal mistake.\\"Carey McWilliams, The Education of Carey McWilliams 229 (Simon & Schuster 1978). Death and legacy He died in New York City on June 27, 1980, at 74.Online Archive of California Since his death, his critical fortunes have risen steadily. The American Political Science Association gives an annual Carey McWilliams Award \\"to honor a major journalistic contribution to our understanding of politics.\\" In Embattled Dreams (2002), California historian Kevin Starr calls McWilliams \\"the single finest nonfiction on California‚Äìever,\\" and biographer Peter Richardson maintains that McWilliams might be the most versatile American public intellectual of the twentieth century. His first son, Wilson Carey McWilliams, was a noted political scientist who taught at Rutgers University. His second son, Jerry McWilliams, was an expert on vinyl disc records preservation. McWilliams had two grandchildren: Susan McWilliams Barndt, a professor of politics at Pomona College, and Helen McWilliams, the lead singer of VAGIANT Boston. His papers are housed in the Bancroft Library at the University of California, Berkeley and at Special Collections at the University of California, Los Angeles.

It can be denoted by the symbols NH3(aq). Although the name ammonium hydroxide suggests an alkali with composition [NH4+][OH‚àí], it is actually impossible to isolate samples of NH4OH. The ions NH4+ and OH‚àí do not account for a significant fraction of the total amount of ammonia except in extremely dilute solutions. Basicity of ammonia in water In aqueous solution, ammonia deprotonates a small fraction of the water to give ammonium and hydroxide according to the following equilibrium: : NH3 \\\\+ H2O NH4+ \\\\+ OH‚àí. In a 1 M ammonia solution, about 0.42% of the ammonia is converted to ammonium, equivalent to pH = 11.63 because [NH4+] = 0.0042 M, [OH‚àí] = 0.0042 M, [NH3] = 0.9958 M, and pH = 14 + log10[OH‚àí] = 11.62. The base ionization constant is : Kb = [NH4+][OH‚àí] / [NH3] = 1.8. Saturated solutions Like other gases, ammonia exhibits decreasing solubility in solvent liquids as the temperature of the solvent increases. Ammonia solutions decrease in density as the concentration of dissolved ammonia increases. At , the density of a saturated solution is 0.88 g/ml and contains 35.6% ammonia by mass, 308 grams of ammonia per litre of solution, and has a molarity of approximately 18 mol/L. At higher temperatures, the molarity of the saturated solution decreases and the density increases. Upon warming saturated solutions, ammonia gas is released. Applications In contrast to anhydrous ammonia, aqueous ammonia finds few non-niche uses outside of cleaning agents. = Household cleaner = Diluted (1‚Äì3%) ammonia is also an ingredient of numerous cleaning agents, including many window cleaning formulas. Because aqueous ammonia is a gas dissolved in water, as the water evaporates from a window, the gas evaporates also, leaving the window streak-free. In addition to use as an ingredient in cleansers with other cleansing ingredients, ammonia in water is also sold as a cleaning agent by itself, usually labeled as simply \\"ammonia\\". It may be sold plain, lemon- scented (and typically colored yellow), or pine-scented (green). Commonly available ammonia with soap added is known as \\"cloudy ammonia\\". = Alkyl amine precursor= In industry, aqueous ammonia can be used as a precursor to some alkyl amines, although anhydrous ammonia is usually preferred. Hexamethylenetetramine forms readily from aqueous ammonia and formaldehyde. Ethylenediamine forms from 1,2-dichloroethane and aqueous ammonia. = Absorption refrigeration = In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used, but after the development of the vapor compression cycle it lost much of its importance because of its low coefficient of performance (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Both the Electrolux refrigeratorVapour Absorption Cycle - Domestic Electrolux Refrigerator and the Einstein refrigerator are well known examples of this application of the ammonia solution. = Water treatment = Ammonia is used to produce monochloramine, which is used as a disinfectant. Chloramine is preferred over chlorination for its ability to remain active in stagnant water pipes longer, reducing the risk of waterborne infections. Ammonia is used by aquarists for the purposes of setting up a new fish tank using an ammonia process called fishless cycling. This application requires that the ammonia contain no additives. = Food production = Baking ammonia (ammonium bicarbonate) was one of the original chemical leavening agents. It was obtained from deer antlers. It is useful as a leavening agent, because ammonium carbonate is heat activated. This characteristic allows bakers to avoid both yeast's long proofing time and the quick CO2 dissipation of baking soda in making breads and cookies rise. It is still used to make ammonia cookies and other crisp baked goods, but its popularity has waned because of ammonia's off-putting smell and concerns over its use as a food ingredient compared to modern-day baking powder formulations. It has been assigned E number E527 for use as a food additive in the European Union. Aqueous ammonia is used as an acidity regulator to bring down the acid levels in food. It is classified in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) when using the food grade version.Database of Select Committee on GRAS Substances (SCOGS) Reviews: Ammonium hydroxide, U.S. Food and Drug Administration Its pH control abilities make it an effective antimicrobial agent. = Furniture darkening = In furniture-making, Ammonia fuming was traditionally used to darken or stain wood containing tannic acid. After being sealed inside a container with the wood, fumes from the ammonia solution react with the tannic acid and iron salts naturally found in wood, creating a rich, dark stained look to the wood. This technique was commonly used during the arts and crafts movement in furniture ‚Äì a furniture style which was primarily constructed of oak and stained using these methods. = Treatment of straw for cattle = Ammonia solution is used to treat straw, producing \\"ammoniated straw\\" making it more edible for cattle.  Laboratory use  Aqueous ammonia is used in traditional qualitative inorganic analysis as a complexant and base. Like many amines, it gives a deep blue coloration with copper(II) solutions. Ammonia solution can dissolve silver oxide residues, such as that formed from Tollens' reagent. It is often found in solutions used to clean gold, silver, and platinum jewelry, but may have adverse effects on porous gem stones like opals and pearls.The Jeweler's Bench. 2015.

The project entails the construction of a demonstration power plant at Koeberg near Cape Town (now postponed indefinitelyhttp://www.world-nuclear- news.org/NN-PBMR_postponed-1109092.html World Nuclear News 11 September 2009) and a fuel plant at Pelindaba near Pretoria.  Reactor design  The PBMR is characterised by inherent safety features, which mean that no human error or equipment failure can cause an accident that would harm the public. Heat from the PBMR can be used for a variety of industrial process applications, including process steam for cogeneration applications, in-situ oil sands recovery, ethanol applications, refinery and petrochemical applications. The high temperature heat can also be used to reform methane to produce syngas (where the syngas can be used as feedstock to produce hydrogen, ammonia and methanol); and to produce hydrogen and oxygen by decomposing water thermochemically. The PBMR is modular in that only small to mid-sized units will be designed. Larger power stations will be built by combining many of these modules. As of 2008, 400MWt was emerging as an optimum module size, considerably larger than the original concept size. The PBMR is fuelled and moderated by graphite fuel spheres each containing TRISO coated low enriched uranium oxide fuel particles. There are 15000 fuel particles per fuel sphere the size of a billiard ball. \\"Each fuel pebble contains 9 g of uranium, and this holds enough generation capacity to sustain a family of four, for a year. Five tons of coal and up to 23 000 m3 of water will be required to generate one pebble's energy.‚Äù The concept is based on the AVR reactor and THTR in Germany, but modified to drive a Brayton closed-cycle gas turbine.IAEA Technical Committee Meeting on ‚ÄúGas Turbine Power Conversion Systems for Modular HTGRs‚Äù, held from 14‚Äì16 November 2000 in Palo Alto, California.

IAEA-TECDOC‚Äî1238, pp:102‚Äì113 The core design is annular with a centre column as a neutron reflector.  PBMR (Pty) Ltd  Since its establishment in 1994, Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (Pty) Ltd grew into one of the largest nuclear reactor design teams in the world. In addition to the core team of some 700 people at the PBMR head-office in Centurion near Pretoria, more than 600 people at universities, private companies and research institutes were involved with the project. In 2009 PBMR (Pty) announced that it was looking at employing the technology for process heat applications, and some pebble bed reactor contracts had been put on hold to prevent unnecessary spending In early 2010 the South Africa government announced it had stopped funding the development of the pebble bed modular reactor, and PBMR (Pty) stated it was considering 75% cuts in staff. The decision was taken because no customer or investor for PBMR was found. Unresolved technical items, a substantial increase of costs and a 2008 report from Forschungszentrum J√ºlich about major problems in operation of the German pebble bed reactor AVR had discouraged potential investors. International banks refused to support the PBMR project by loans. PBMR's CEO resigned on March, 8th 2010. In future, the South African nuclear program will concentrate on conventional light water reactors. On 25 May 2010 the company announced to staff that it intends to implement a \\"Care and Maintenance\\" Strategy. This involves the reduction of staff to 9. The stated purpose of the proposed structure is; preserve PBMR as a legal entity, preserve and optimise IP, preserve HTR license, preserve assets and solicit new investors. The strategy assumes that keeping on 9 employees in the medium term will leave sufficient funding to take PBMR to March 2013. The remaining employees will serve to end of October 2010. Some funding is foreseen for dismantling of the PBMR fuel fabrication laboratories in 2011. In 2006, the US Department of Energy awarded the PBMR consortium the primary contract for the first phase of its New Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) project. The scope for the first phase of this contract, which has now been completed, was for the pre-conceptual engineering of a nuclear co- generation plant for the production of electricity and hydrogen. Requests for proposals for the second phase of the NGNP project will soon be issued, to which the PBMR consortium will be responding within the next few months of 2009. In May 2010 Westinghouse withdrew from the PBMR consortium, which led to an end of the South African engagement in NGNP. The NGNP project will continue on HTGRs with prismatic fuel elements, not with pebbles as in PBMR, as was announced in February 2012. R9.244 billion (US$1.3 billion) had been invested in the PBMR project. Over 80% came from the South African government, with smaller amounts from Eskom (8.8%), Westinghouse (4.9%), Industrial Development Corporation (4.9%) and Exelon (1.1%).

Schlesisches Tor U1 is a line on the Berlin U-Bahn, which is long and has 13 stations. Its traditional line designation was BII. It runs east‚Äìwest and its eastern terminus is Warschauer Stra√üe S-Bahn station where it connects to the Schlesische Bahn. From there it runs through Kreuzberg via Gleisdreieck and Wittenbergplatz on to the Kurf√ºrstendamm. The eastern section of the line is the oldest part of the Berlin U-Bahn, although it is largely above ground.  Nomenclature  The U1 route was originally part of BII until 1957, where it was renamed to BIV until 1 March 1966. While the main section between Wittenbergplatz and Schlesisches Tor has been designated as line 1 since 1966, the western end of the line has changed twice. It was consequently renumbered to Line \\"3\\" and \\"U3\\" in 1993, before being renamed U15 until 2004.  History  The increasing traffic problems in Berlin at the end of the 19th century led to a search for new efficient means of transport. Inspired by Werner von Siemens, numerous suggestions were made for overhead conveyors, such as a suspension railway, as was later built in Wuppertal, or a tube railway as was built in London. Finally Siemens and some prominent Berliners submitted a plan for an elevated railway on the model of New York. These people opposed Siemens' suggestion of building an overhead railway in the major street of Friedrichstrasse, but the city of Berlin opposed underground railways, since it feared damage to one of its new sewers. The original route Finally, after many years and negotiations, Siemens proposal for an elevated railway line from Warschauer Br√ºcke via Hallesches Tor to B√ºlowstra√üe was approved. This was only possible, however, because it passed through poor areas. The richer residents of Leipziger Stra√üe pressed the city administration to prevent the line using their street. Siemens & Halske carried out all construction work and also owned the line. The first sod was turned on 10 September 1896 in Gitschiner Stra√üe. The construction work had to be carried out quickly because the contract with the city of Berlin, signed with the granting of the concession, specified that the line had to be finished within two years, or a penalty of 50,000 marks would be payable. The railway engineers developed a design for the supporting columns for the elevated railway, but it was unpopular and the architect Alfred Grenander was asked to submit an artistic solution for this problem. For the next 30 years Grenander was the house architect for the elevated and underground railway. After tough negotiations with the city of Charlottenburg it was decided to extend the line to Knie along the Tauentzienstrasse, but instead of being elevated it would be a subsurface (cut-and-cover) railway. The management of the city of Berlin board of works regarded the idea of an underground railway sympathetically. Since the underground caused no apparent damage to the new sewer, an underground branch could be built from a junction at Gleisdreieck (German for \\"rail triangle\\") to Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's then city centre. The national government granted permission for the planning changes on 1 November 1900. The B√ºlowstra√üe elevated station in 1903 The total length of the elevated and underground railway was now . The largest part of the route, approximately , would be established on viaducts and connect eleven elevated stations. In addition there would be of underground line with three underground stations. The planners believed that 8-carriage trains would not be needed and therefore designed it with 80 m-long (260 ft) platforms, sufficient only for 6-carriage trains. The first of the line was finished in 1901 and on 15 February 1902 the first train ran on the line from Potsdamer Platz to Zoologischer Garten, then to Stralauer Tor and back to Potsdamer Platz. This allowed many prominent Berliners to participate in the opening trip, including the Prussian minister for public works, Karl von Thielen. On 18 February 1902 the first stage of the Berlin U-Bahn was officially opened (Stralauer Tor‚ÄìPotsdamer Platz). In March the line was extended to Zoologischer Garten and on 17 August it was extended by 380 m from Stralauer Tor to Warschauer Br√ºcke. There were at that time only two lines: *From Warschauer Br√ºcke to Zoologischer Garten via Potsdamer Platz (with reversal). *From Warschauer Br√ºcke directly to Zoologischer Garten. On 14 December the line was extended to Knie. The section between Gleisdreieck and Knie (now Ernst-Reuter-Platz) is now part of U2. = U-Bahn to Dahlem and the branch to Uhlandstra√üe = Uhlandstra√üe (U1) In the summer of 1907, the elevated railway company of the new city of Wilmersdorf suggested the building of an underground line to the Wilmersdorf area. It suggested a line to N√ºrnberger Platz and, if Wilmersdorf would pay for it, to Breitenbachplatz. Since Wilmersdorf municipality had poor transport connections, the Wilmersdorf city fathers were pleased to take up this suggestion. The royal domain of Dahlem, which was south of Wilmersdorf and was still undeveloped, also supported a U-bahn connection and wanted it extended from Breitenbachplatz to Thielplatz. However, the future line would run partly through the city of Charlottenburg, which saw the city of Wilmersdorf as a major competitor for the settlement of wealthy ratepayers. Long negotiations ensued, until finally in the summer 1910 a solution was found: an additional line would be built under the Kurf√ºrstendamm to Uhlandstra√üe. Work began on these lines in the same summer. Eastern entrance of Uhlandstra√üe U-Bahn station The double-track Wittenbergplatz station, which only had two side platforms, had to be completely rebuilt. The new station required five platforms with a sixth prepared for development and an entrance hall. The cities of Wilmersdorf and Charlottenburg submitted many suggestions for its design. Finally the house architect of the elevated railway company, Alfred Grenander, was appointed to design the station on the recommendation of the royal police chief. The additional line to Uhlandstra√üe branched at Wittenbergplatz and had no intervening stations, but it was intended to be extended to Halensee. Nevertheless, the only addition to the line has been the building in 1961 of the Kurf√ºrstendamm interchange station with the U9. It is still planned to extend the line to the west and preparations were made for it in the building of Internationales Congress Centrum on Neuen Kantstra√üe. In addition provisions have been made for a U1 station under the U7 station at Adenauerplatz. After a relatively short construction period the Kurf√ºrstendamm line, as it was called, was opened together with the Dahlem line on 12 October 1913. The length of the additional lines totaled about . These were the last sections of the Berlin U-Bahn built before World War I. = The new Gleisdreieck = Gleisdreieck lower platform ‚Äì today the U2 stops here One of the most dangerous places of the entire U-Bahn network was found at the triangular rail junction at Gleisdreieck, which connected the main route between Warschauer Br√ºcke and Zoologischer Garten with the branch line to Potsdamer Platz. This branch was protected only by signals, so that train- driver inattention could easily lead to a disaster, as happened on 26 September 1908. A U-Bahn train ran into the side of another train, forcing two carriages off the track. One carriage fell over the viaduct and 21 passengers died. As a result, it was decided to change the configuration at Gleisdreieck. Construction began in May 1912 to replace the rail triangle with two lines built as a grade-separated cross with a new Gleisdreieck interchange station at the intersection. These lines now form part of U1 and U2. The new works were carried out largely with full services operating, although services were briefly interrupted on each line. On 3 November 1912 the new Gleisdreieck station was opened but construction was not completed until August 1913. The connecting track from the Pankow direction to the Warschauer Stra√üe direction continued to operate until the completion of works for construction supply vehicles. =Last small profile U-Bahn opened= Nollendorfplatz station The small profile network was only slightly extended during the Weimar Republic. The new arrangement at Gleisdreieck was completed. The additional line created by the conversion of the three way junction to a cross at Gleisdreieck was extended under Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe to Nollendorfplatz and was opened on 24 October 1926 together with the rebuilt Nollendorfplatz station. The basic fit- out of the Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe station bears witness to the difficult financial times. As part of this work, the Nollendorfplatz station was completely rebuilt to incorporate the Sch√∂neberg line (now U4), which had continued to be independently operated after its take over by the city of Berlin in 1920. The new Nollendorfplatz station has two underground platforms, one below the other and looking identical. The Sch√∂neberg line ends on the higher level across the platform from trains coming from Wittenbergplatz. Trains run from the lower level to Sch√∂neberg and Wittenbergplatz, also allowing cross-platform transfers. The elevated station of today's U2 remained completely unchanged. Its impressive dome was destroyed in World War II and a simplified dome was only re-established on the U-Bahn's 100-year anniversary in 2002. = Kurf√ºrstendamm station = The new Berlin sector administration in West Berlin focussed on the reconstruction of buses and trams starting in the late 1940s. It also recognised that the densely populated districts of Steglitz, Wedding and Reinickendorf needed a rail connection to the then redeveloping centre around Zoologischer Garten. This could not be achieved however with line extensions and a new line was necessary. Therefore, it was proposed to build line G (now U9) from central Wedding, near Osloer Stra√üe, through Moabit, the centre of West Berlin, near Zoo and Kurf√ºrstendamm, the Bundesallee and the Schlo√üstra√üe to Rathaus Steglitz. This line was the third north south line, after lines C (U6) and D (U8). In addition a new station would be built at the intersection of the new built line with the then U3 (now U1). Instead of building the station with services operating, the ‚Äústub line‚Äù was simply shut down so that the rail interchange could be built under the crossing of Joachimstaler Stra√üe and Kurf√ºrstendamm. Line G was due to be opened on 2 September 1961, but on 13 August the GDR government commenced building the Berlin Wall, making the line even more needed. Therefore, the opening date was brought forward to 28 August. = Fall of the wall and reunification of the networks = Since 1995 the U-Bahn runs again over the Oberbaumbr√ºcke After the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and German reunification on 3 October 1990, it was also necessary to combine the two U-Bahn networks of the east and west again. When line U2 started running through in 1993, line U1 still ended at Schlesisches Tor station, where it had terminated since August 1961. The first reconstruction work on the line began in 1992. Numerous repairs had to be made and new buildings were necessary because some station buildings had been demolished during the GDR era. The Oberbaumbr√ºcke was also in a very run-down condition. The Spanish architect, Santiago Calatrava drew up the plans for rebuilding the bridge. The station with its three platforms, the old signal tower, and the carriage shed in Rudolfstrasse all required repairs. After construction was completed, the first train ran on 14 October 1995 to Warschauer Stra√üe (formerly called Warschauer Br√ºcke, but renamed after the nearby S-Bahn station). There are plans for the U-Bahn station to be moved closer to the S-Bahn station, but due to financial constraints this would not happen before 2015.https://www.welt.de/print- welt/article192078/Warschauer_Strasse_Mehr_als_50_000_Fahrgaeste_taeglich.html = Planning = U-Bahn train crosses the Oberbaum Bridge, December 2014 In the east, an extension to the northeast to Frankfurter Tor (U5) has been planned since the 1920s, via Kopernikusstra√üe, but is not likely to be implemented for some time. It may have potential extensions to Forckenbeckplatz and Storkower Stra√üe, whereas another extension is also underway to Hausburgstra√üe and Landsberger Allee. The Berlin U-Bahn 2014 Plans has been revived to allow the U1 to be extended to Ostkreuz, which increases the significance of Ostkreuz being a transit hub. In the west, there are long- term plans to extend the line to Westkreuz via Schl√ºterstra√üe and Adenauerplatz (U7) and a new station at Kracauer Platz, instead of continuing the line to Halensee. The advantage would be the connection to the Ring- and Stadtbahn, whereas in Halensee, only the Ringbahn would connect. A line to Halensee could replace several bus lines. Westkreuz is almost only a station to change trains, as there is very limited passenger potential in the vicinity. Zukunft Mobilit√§t (german) While older plans for a continuation to Theodor-Heuss-Platz would create a line with above average passenger numbers, costs might be prohibitive compared to smaller and shorter alternatives.

Berlin U-Bahn lines Articles containing video clips Railway lines opened in 1902 1902 establishments in Germany ","title":"U1 (Berlin U-Bahn)"},{"id":"594639","text":"U2 is a line of the Berlin U-Bahn. The U2 line starts at Pankow S-Bahn station, runs through the eastern city centre (Alexanderplatz) to Potsdamer Platz, the western city centre (Wittenbergplatz, Zoologischer Garten) and finally to the Ruhleben terminal station. U2 sign at Ernst-Reuter Platz The U2 has 29 stations and a length of . Together with the U1, U3, and U4 lines, it was part of the early Berlin U-Bahn network built before 1914. The line between Potsdamer Platz and Zoologischer Garten was the western section of the \\"stem line\\" (Stammstrecke), Berlin's first U-Bahn line opened in 1902. Gleisdreieck higher platform - today the U1 and the U3 stop here Zoologischer Garten station, looking towards Ruhleben Overview The line starts to the west of central Berlin at Ruhleben and runs on an embankment between Rominter Allee and the railway to Spandau (also called the \\"Olympic\\" or \\"Grunewald\\" railway). On the bend approaching Olympischen Stra√üe, the line descends into tunnel to run beneath that road. Subsequently, the U2 swings onto Reichsstrasse to Theodor-Heuss-Platz, where it runs in a curve to Kaiserdamm. Under Kaiserdamm, which becomes Bismarckstra√üe at Sophie Charlotte-Platz, the tunnel runs straight to Ernst-Reuter-Platz. Here again, it swings to the southeast, following the course of Hardenberger Stra√üe towards Zoologischer Garten station. In the tunnel, it passes the foundations of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church on a tight arc and then follows Tauentzienstra√üe to Wittenbergplatz where the line emerges to an elevated section via a ramp east of the Kleiststra√üe/Courbierestra√üe intersection. The elevated railway reaches its full height at Nollendorfplatz station where all four lines of the small- profile network meet. The underground part of the station has four tracks. The U2 continues above ground to the east of B√ºlowstra√üe. After that the U2 makes a curve over a long viaduct at the southernmost point of the line, passes through Gleisdreieck station and then runs straight across the Landwehr Canal and returns underground between Mendelssohn Bartholdy-Park and Potsdamer Platz stations. While the elevated railway company intended to continue the line along Leipziger Stra√üe, it was not permitted to build this route and instead it continues instead along Mohrenstra√üe, Markgrafenstra√üe and Niederwallstra√üe to the River Spree in Berlin Mitte. After passing M√§rkisches Museum station, it goes under the River Spree in a tunnel, and runs through Klosterstra√üe to Alexanderplatz station. After leaving Alexanderplatz, the line turns under Rosa-Luxemburg-Stra√üe and through Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz station. The line then runs north underneath Sch√∂nhauser Allee and through Senefelderplatz station. Before reaching Eberswalder Stra√üe station, the line emerges from tunnel and on to an elevated viaduct through to Sch√∂nhauser Allee station, an interchange with the S-Bahn. From there the line runs beyond the former city limits and the elevated railway descends again into a tunnel to Vinetastra√üe before reaching the terminus at Pankow.  Route numbering  Since the introduction of the schematic line network plans at the Berlin subway, at least parts of today's line U2 always had the colour red. When letters were introduced as a line name after the First World War, the small profile network received the letters \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". The inner city route, more important than the older route through Kreuzberg, became line A, as did the two western branches to Charlottenburg and Dahlem (today's U2 and U3 lines). The routes from Kurf√ºrstendamm and Sch√∂neberg through Kreuzberg to Warschauer Stra√üe (today: U1 and U4) were given the letter \\"B\\" and the colour code green. To distinguish the branches in the western part of the line, the letters were supplemented by Roman numbers, the Charlottenburg route was thus the line AI. From 1966, the designation of the lines operated by the Berlin public transport companies (BVG West / BVG) in West Berlin was converted to Arabic numbers. Each line was now operated independently and without branching. The (\\"green\\") line 1 now ran from Ruhleben through Charlottenburg to Kreuzberg, while the previous AII became the (\\"red\\") line 2 (Krumme Lanke ‚Äì Gleisdreieck, from 1972 only to Wittenbergplatz). The severed eastern line section, used since 1949 by the BVG East / BVB, retained the \\"A\\" line designation unchanged, as well as the red colour code. On 9 January 1984, the BVG also took over the S-Bahn lines in West Berlin previously managed by Deutsche Reichsbahn. The marking of the U-Bahn lines operated by the BVG changed again because the U-Bahn and S-Bahn lines were now operated in parallel. To better distinguish the two networks, the respective Arabic numbers, which had been used since 1966, were prefixed with the letter \\"U\\" to provide a line number. According to the model of public transport networks, which were used in various cities (Frankfurt, Shanghai, Munich, Beijing, Guangzhou) they were then designated as U1 to U9 and similarly the acquired S-Bahn routes were preceded by \\"S\\". With the merging of Berlin in the context of German reunification and the reconstruction of the disused Wittenbergplatz‚ÄìMohrenstra√üe section in 1993, the BVG decided to swap the western branches of lines U1 and U2, which meet at Wittenbergplatz. The reunited former AI line has since been operated under the new name \\"U2\\", but using the traditional red line colour as previously used in the separate parts of the city.  History  The original route The B√ºlowstra√üe elevated station in 1903 air raid in November 1943. The increasing traffic problems in Berlin at the end of the 19th century led to a search for new efficient means of transport. Inspired by Werner von Siemens, numerous suggestions were made for overhead conveyors, such as a suspension railway, as was later built in Wuppertal, or a tube railway as was built in London. Finally Siemens and some prominent Berliners submitted a plan for an elevated railway on the model of New York. These people opposed Siemens' suggestion of building an overhead railway in the major street of Friedrichstra√üe, but the city of Berlin opposed underground railways, since it feared damage to one of its new sewers. Finally, after many years and negotiations, Siemens proposal for an elevated railway line from Warschauer Br√ºcke via Hallesches Tor to B√ºlowstra√üe was approved. This was only possible, however, because it passed through poor areas. The richer residents of Leipziger Stra√üe pressed the city administration to prevent the line using their street. Siemens & Halske carried out all construction work and also owned the line. The first sod was turned on 10 September 1896 in Gitschiner Stra√üe. The construction work had to be carried out quickly because the contract with the city of Berlin, signed with the granting of the concession, specified that the line had to be finished within two years, or a penalty of 50,000 marks would be payable. The railway engineers developed a design for the supporting columns for the elevated railway, but it was unpopular and the architect Alfred Grenander was asked to submit an artistic solution for this problem. For the next 30 years Grenander was the house architect for the elevated and underground railway. After tough negotiations with the city of Charlottenburg it was decided to extend the line to Knie along the Tauentzienstra√üe, but instead of being elevated it would be a subsurface (cut-and-cover) railway. The management of the city of Berlin board of works regarded the idea of an underground railway sympathetically. Since the underground caused no apparent damage to the new sewer, an underground branch could be built from a junction at Gleisdreieck (German for \\"rail triangle\\") to Potsdamer Platz, Berlin‚Äôs then city centre. The national government granted permission for the planning changes on 1 November 1900. The total length of the elevated and underground railway was now . The largest part of the route, approximately , would be established on viaducts and connect eleven elevated stations. In addition there would be of underground line with three underground stations. The planners believed that 8-carriage trains would not be needed and therefore designed it with 80 m-long platforms, sufficient only for 6-carriage trains. The first of the line was finished in 1901 and on 15 February 1902 the first train ran on the line from Potsdamer Platz to Zoologischer Garten, then to Stralauer Tor and back to Potsdamer Platz. This allowed many prominent Berliners to participate in the opening trip, including the Prussian minister for public works, Karl von Thielen. On 18 February 1902 the first stage of the Berlin U-Bahn was officially opened (Stralauer Tor‚ÄìPotsdamer Platz). In March the line was extended to Zoologischer Garten and on 17 August it was extended by 380 m from Stralauer Tor to Warschauer Br√ºcke. There were at that time only two lines: *From Warschauer Br√ºcke to Zoologischer Garten via Potsdamer Platz (with reversal). *From Warschauer Br√ºcke directly to Zoologischer Garten. On 14 December the line was extended to Knie. The section between Gleisdreieck and Knie (now Ernst-Reuter-Platz) is now part of U2. = Charlottenburg extension = Deutsche Oper station, formerly Bismarckstra√üe Sophie-Charlotte-Platz station After the opening of the original route further plans to extend the three route branches emerged: via Charlottenburg city to Wilhelmplatz (now Richard-Wagner-Platz) and towards Reichskanzlerplatz (now Theodor-Heuss Platz), from Potsdamer Platz to the centre of Berlin and via Warschauer Stra√üe to Frankfurter Tor The fastest route negotiations were completed with the young and coming city of Charlottenburg because there was a lot of vacant land that could be developed. The most important negotiating point was to build a route via Charlottenburg Town Hall in Wilhelmsplatz. Here an extension along Berliner Stra√üe (now Otto-Suhr-Allee) would have served, but this was served at the time by the and a parallel line did not seem sensible. Therefore, this line would continue under Bismarckstra√üe to the west and then curve to the town hall. Under the working title of Krumme Stra√üe, the line was initially planned with a station at Bismarckstra√üe (now Deutsche Oper) and a terminus at Wilhelmplatz. The line was opened between Knie and Wilhelmplatz on 14 May 1906. Both U-Bahn lines now ran to Bismarckstra√üe, but only the branch to Potsdamer Platz also ran to Wilhelmsplatz. While this line was under construction, the railway company and the city of Charlottenburg agreed on a branch towards Westend. Therefore, a planning amendment was necessary at the planned station at Bismarckstra√üe, because the line to Westend would branch there. Therefore, the station was built as the first four-track U-Bahn station in Germany. The two inner tracks would be used for the line to Wilhelmsplatz and the outer tracks for the line to Westend. Since the western Charlottenburg area was still completely undeveloped, the line would not generate any profits in its early years. Therefore, the elevated railway company negotiated with the city of Charlottenburg and the other property owners to compensate for the line's deficit. This contract was signed on 23 June 1906. For the line westwards through Charlottenburg, the following stations were to be built: * Bismarckstra√üe (today's: Deutsche Oper) * Sophie-Charlotte-Platz * Kaiserdamm * Reichskanzlerplatz (now Theodor-Heuss-Platz, the terminus) On 16 March 1908, the Emperor Wilhelm II, opened the line, following the \\"ministerial trip\\", the first service on the line. It was officially inaugurated on 29 March 1908. The two existing lines did not continue to Reichskanzlerplatz; instead, a third line was established, operating only between Bismarckstra√üe and Reichskanzlerplatz. Olympia-Stadion station Because of the greatly extended length of the line, a new workshop was desirable as the previous workshop in Rudolfstra√üe (or Warschauer Br√ºcke) was now no longer adequate. Therefore, the elevated railway company sought a suitable site. Since the Prussian forest administration wanted to market its site of the Grunewald profitably, the interests of both partners were met. The railway company bought only 14 hectares of land to build its new operations workshop. At the same time, it undertook, to build an extension of the line to a station at the stadium (now Olympia-Stadion). The elevated railway company received a grant from the Forestry Administration of 200,000 marks to support this project. Services would only be operated there on special occasions. The shell of Neu-Westend station was built with the extension to the stadium station, as there was insufficient traffic to justify completing the station at that time. The new extension was completed on 8 June 1913. The nearby Unterspreewald power station on Wiesendamm in Ruhleben, which was built for the U-Bahn power supply, had already started operation in 1911. = The central line = After the so-called \\"stem line\\" had been extended to Wilhelmplatz (now Richard- Wagner-Platz) in Charlottenburg, the elevated railway company planned to connect the Berlin city centre to the new U-Bahn. The city of Berlin, however, prohibited this because, given the success of the first line, it had made its own plans for the construction of a metro. But the highest decision-maker, the Berlin Police chief, intervened and approved the plans. Hotel Kaiserhof (now Mohrenstra√üe) was given an entrance designed in accordance with its elegant surroundings. The elevated railway company planned to run the new line in a straight line under Leipziger Stra√üe from Potsdamer Platz to Spittelmarkt. The \\"Gro√üe Berliner Stra√üenbahn\\" (Greater Berlin tramway company), which operated a line along this street, prevented the realisation of these plans by threatening claims for damages, with the support of city of Berlin. Spittelmarkt station provides daylight. The negotiating partners finally agreed to a long-term route through Spittelmarkt, Alexanderplatz and Sch√∂nhauser Allee to Nordring station. The plans initially included the stations of Kaiserhof (now Mohrenstra√üe), Friedrichstra√üe (now Stadtmitte), Hausvogteiplatz and Spittelmarkt. The line was later to continue via the following stations: Inselbr√ºcke (now M√§rkisches Museum), Klosterstra√üe, Alexanderplatz, Sch√∂nhauser Tor (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz), Senefelderplatz, Danziger Stra√üe (now Eberswalder Stra√üe, an elevated station) and Nordring (now Sch√∂nhauser Allee, an elevated station). As the section of the line through Spittelmarkt would be very complex and expensive due to the need to tunnel under the Spree, the plans provided for a (cheaper) elevated line in Sch√∂nhauser Allee as compensation. Construction began on 15 December 1905. Potsdamer Platz station, which then had side platforms, was demolished to enable the extension. The new Leipziger Platz (now Potsdamer Platz) station was opened 200 metres away on 28 September 1907. Spittelmarkt station was built under Spittelmarkt square in 1908. This lies directly next to the Spree, so the subsoil is very wet. Piled foundations were necessary to prevent the station subsiding. A windowed gallery was built on the Spree. It was closed in the Second World War and only reopened in 2004. The \\"Spittelmarkt line\\" was officially opened on 1 October 1908. There were now four different services on the U-Bahn network, two of which used the new line: * Warschauer Br√ºcke ‚Äì Potsdamer Platz ‚Äì Spittelmarkt, and * Wilhelmplatz (Charlottenburg) ‚Äì Wittenbergplatz ‚Äì Potsdamer Platz ‚Äì Spittelmarkt. = Construction of elevated line in Sch√∂nhauser Allee = Elevated station at Eberswalder Stra√üe (formerly Dimitroffstra√üe, originally Danziger Stra√üe) In March 1910, construction began on the extension of the \\"Spittelmarkt line\\" (now also called the \\"Centrumslinie\\"‚Äîcentral line) to the north. There were also some challenges here. After the Spittelmarkt station, the line runs along the banks of the Spree. Therefore, a ramp had to be built to pass under the river bed. Inselbr√ºcke (\\"island bridge\\", now M√§rkisches Museum) station was built there at a depth of about six and a half metres. Because the station was so deep, it was built with an impressively high barrel vault that covers the platform, which is rare in Berlin. It and Platz der Luftbr√ºcke station are the only column-free U-Bahn stations in Berlin. Beyond this station, the line crossed under the Spree and swung under Klosterstra√üe, where the station of the same name was located. Since there were plans at the time to build a branch line under Frankfurter Allee, space was left in the middle of the platform area for another track. Today a line runs on a similar route from Alexanderplatz to Frankfurter Allee. The Central line continued from Klosterstrasse to Alexanderplatz. During the building of Alexanderplatz station, care was taken to ensure that stairs to other lines could later be added. The line between Spittelmarkt and Alexanderplatz was opened on 1 July 1913. The line between Alexanderplatz and Wilhelmplatz quickly became the most used U-Bahn line. This extension ran to Sch√∂nhauser Allee. Sch√∂nhauser Tor station (now Rosa- Luxemburg-Platz) was the first station under today's Torstra√üe. Since Sch√∂nhauser Allee was wide enough, there were no problems with the construction of the tunnel. The next station was as Senefelderplatz. Beyond this, a ramp emerges from the tunnel and runs to the former Danziger Stra√üe station (now Eberswalder Stra√üe). As mentioned, this was built as an elevated railway, because the tunnel section at Spittelmarkt was very cost-intensive and the construction of the elevated railway on the broad Sch√∂nhauser Allee was very cheap. After Danziger Stra√üe station there was a longer elevated viaduct to the former Nordring station (now Sch√∂nhauser Allee). There, the existing Ringbahn was crossed, not underground, but on an even higher level. The S-Bahn now runs in a cutting there. This was the terminus of the line. The extension from Alexanderplatz to Nordring was opened just three and a half weeks after the line to Alexanderplatz was opened on 27 July 1913. = The new Gleisdreieck = Gleisdreieck before and after the reconstruction One of the most dangerous places of the entire U-Bahn network was found at the triangular rail junction at Gleisdreieck, which connected the main line between Warschauer Br√ºcke and Zoologischer Garten with the branch line to Potsdamer Platz. This branch was protected only by signals, so that driver inattention could easily lead to a disaster, as happened on 26 September 1908. A U-Bahn train ran into the side of another train, forcing two carriages off the track. One carriage fell over the viaduct and 21 passengers died. As a result, it was decided to change the configuration at Gleisdreieck. Construction began in May 1912 to replace the triangular junction with two lines built as a grade- separated cross with a new Gleisdreieck interchange station at the intersection. These lines now form part of U1 and U2. The new work was carried out largely with full services operating, although services were briefly interrupted on each line. On 3 November 1912, the new Gleisdreieck station was opened but construction was not completed until August 1913. The connecting track from the Pankow direction to the Warschauer Stra√üe direction continued to be open until the completion of work for use by construction supply trains. = Two new termini= The current U2 terminus in Ruhleben Vinetastra√üe station with a class GI train, 1993 The small profile network was only slightly expanded during the Weimar Republic. There has been regular train traffic to Stadion since 1913 and Neu-Westend station, which was already partly built at that time, was finally opened on 22 May 1922. The new Gleisdreieck station was also completed to form a cross; the \\"relief line\\" from Gleisdreieck via Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe to Nollendorfplatz was opened on 24 October 1926. The austere Kurf√ºrstenstra√üe station testifies to the difficult financial situation of that time. Nollendorfplatz station was also completely rebuilt and rearranged as part of the construction of the relief line, since the U-Bahn of the formerly independent city of Sch√∂neberg (today's line U4) was still operated independently, although it was now part of the City of Berlin. The former ‚Äústem line‚Äù from Nordring to Stadion was extended by one station in each direction. Pankow station (now Vinetastra√üe) was built in 1930 to its north. There was one main reason for its construction: trains ran so often to Nordring station that it was not possible to reverse them on the viaduct. It was much easier to provide a reversing facility underground. A further planned extension to Breiten Stra√üe in Pankow or to Pankow S-Bahn station was not built at that time and construction did not recommence until 1997. At the opposite end, the line was extended by one stop to the new terminus of Ruhleben on 22 December 1929. This line ran on an embankment. An extension through a garden and industrial area to nearby Spandau was planned to start a little later. However, the Great Depression and the Second World War prevented these plans from being carried out and the 1929 extension remains the western end of the U2. = Nazism and the Second World War = After the seizure of power of the Nazis two stations on line AI were renamed after people highly regarded by the Nazi party. Reichskanzlerplatz station (now Theodor-Heuss-Platz) was renamed Adolf-Hitler-Platz on 24 April 1933. Sch√∂nhauser Tor station (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz) was renamed after SA (\\"Brownshirts\\") Sturmf√ºhrer (lieutenant) Horst Wessel on 1 May 1934. Under the plans to transform Berlin into \\"Germania\\" in 1939, the route of line A at that time would have changed relatively little compared to other plans of the time. In addition to the northern extension to Pankow, referred to in the plans as Pankow (Breite Stra√üe), which had been planned for years, the elevated line at Gleisdreieck was to be dismantled and replaced by a new, underground and direct route to B√ºlowstra√üe. The proposals for an extension to Spandau that were made in previous and later plans were not incorporated. The proposed lines FI and FIII served this purpose. The first tunnel work started at what is now Theodor-Heuss-Platz, but was stopped in 1941. It was intended that work would resume after the predicted \\"final victory\\". After the war began on 1 September 1939, the order was given to all modes of transport to only run with darkened headlights. This affected not only the trains, but also to the S-Bahn and U-Bahn stations‚Äîonly a few lights were left on. In the autumn of 1943, when the Allied bombing of Berlin increased sharply, many people took refuge in U-Bahn stations. The official regulations stated that at the sound of an air raid siren, all U-Bahn stations were to be closed, however this rarely happened and many people mistakenly believed that they were protected from air raids. For example, the entrance to Senefelderplatz station collapsed as a result of a bomb during the raids that occurred on November 3 and 4 in 1943. In 1944, as the air raids continued, the Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe had trouble keeping the U2 line in operation, as many stations were affected such as Gleisdreieck, Nollendorfplatz, Olympiastadion, Potsdamer Platz, and Klosterstra√üe. In 1945, the situation deteriorated further and the U-Bahn operated only as a shuttle between some stations. The entire U-Bahn came to a standstill on 25 April 1945. Shortly before the end of the Battle of Berlin on 2 May 1945, SS troops blew up the North-South tunnel of the S-Bahn at the Landwehr Canal, which in addition to flooding the S-Bahn tunnel also caused water to flow through connecting passages into the U-Bahn network. Line AI was completely under water between Alexanderplatz and Potsdamer Platz stations and it took a long time to repair the damage. = New beginning after the war = Mohrenstra√üe station (formerly Kaiserhof) was clad with Saalburg marble in 1950 The repair of the U-Bahn network began after the German surrender. On 14 May 1945, the first trains had already begun running in the area around Hermannplatz. The first shuttle trains were able to run on line AI on the section of line between Knie and Kaiserdamm as well as between Kaiserdamm and Ruhleben on 17 May. The stations renamed Reichskanzlerplatz and Sch√∂nhauser Tor during Nazi Germany were returned to their original names. In the following months, further sections were reopened on 18 September trains on line AI between Pankow and Potsdamer Platz and between Gleisdreieck and Ruhleben, while the section between Potsdamer Platz and Gleisdreieck was operated in shuttle mode. = The division of the city and 17 June 1953 = The beginning of the Cold War and its first major escalation, the Berlin Blockade in 1948/1949, caused great uncertainty among Berliners. Many West Berliners avoided East Berlin. This created new traffic flows that bypassed the eastern sector. Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe, the operator of the U-Bahn, was split in 1949 into an eastern and a western company. While bus and tram lines now ended at the sector border, the U-Bahn continued to operate in both sectors. Kaiserhof station was returned to operation under the name of Th√§lmannplatz on 18 August 1950, the sixth anniversary of Ernst Th√§lmann‚Äôs death. This made line AI fully operational again. The station in Wilhelmplatz in the heart of the government district was called after the Hotel Kaiserhof, because the name Wilhelmplatz had already been assigned to a U-Bahn station that had been built in Charlottenburg a few years earlier (now called Richard- Wagner-Platz). The wife and daughter of Th√§lmann, Rosa and Irma, attended the opening ceremony and the renaming of the square as Th√§lmannplatz. Since the government of East Germany mainly occupied offices in the old government district of Wilhelmstrasse, it wanted an impressive station. It is unique in Berlin because of its construction in Saalburg marble in the style of the 1950s. The East Berlin press described it as the most beautiful in Berlin. At the beginning of 1953, the Western BVG installed loudspeakers at the last stations in the western sectors, warning of the crossing into the Soviet sector. Turnback facilities were set up at these stations to allow the trains to terminate there if necessary. In addition, the timetable was designed so that when a U-Bahn train ran east, another train ran west at the same time. As a result, the West would lose only a few U-Bahn sets to the East in the event of an incident. This proved itself in June of the same year, when East Berlin workers responded with protests to an increase in the Arbeitsnorm (\\"work norm\\": the quantity of work required to be performed in a shift). News of the 17 June 1953 uprising spread like wildfire across the GDR. About 20,000 strikers demonstrated not only against the norm increases, but also against the general conditions in the country. The BVG East stopped U-Bahn operations and Deutsche Reichsbahn stopped S-Bahn operations at the border at 11 am. The western trains now ended in the new turnback facilities. In total, the West Berlin BVG lost only 18 trains due to the well thought-out timetable. The northern section of line D, including the stations of Voltastra√üe and Gesundbrunnen, which had no connection to the rest of the West network, was closed. The traffic situation returned to normal after a few days after the bloody suppression of the uprising. As a consequence of the experience of 17 June, the Western BVG established a new route of the AII from Krumme Lanke to Kottbusser Tor which was independent of East Berlin, but which was soon abandoned. In addition, the Sch√∂neberg line now ran only as far as Nollendorfplatz, not as previously to Warschauer Br√ºcke. = The construction of the Wall = East-Berlin transport network with the two U-Bahn lines (shown in blue), 1984 The construction of the Berlin Wall to seal off the sector boundary between the two parts of Berlin resulted in line A also being split into two, as it crossed the city from east to west. On the orders of the then GDR Interior Minister Karl Maron, trains on the section of line A (now U2) in East Berlin terminated at Th√§lmannplatz station (now Mohrenstra√üe). Lines C and D (now U6 and U8) of the West Berlin BVG were left alone, but the stations located in the eastern sector were closed (becoming ghost stations). Connections were not allowed from the eastern section of line A and lines C and D or at Stadtmitte and Alexanderplatz stations. Maron had originally assumed that the West Berlin BVG would terminate their trains on the western section of line A at Potsdamer Platz, but in fact the trains were terminated one stop earlier, at Gleisdreieck. Tracks to allow trains to change direction here had been built in the early 1950s as a precaution. Therefore, the East Berlin BVG used the reversing tracks at Potsdamer Platz and occasionally even ran its trains into West Berlin. The splitting of line A and the closure of those stations on lines C and D under East Berlin completed the split of the unified Berlin public transport network, as the trams and buses had not crossed the sector border since 1953. The Berlin S-Bahn ran throughout Berlin at the direction of the GDR-controlled Deutsche Reichsbahn and therefore never formed part of the unified public transport network. One consequence of the 13 August 1961 crisis was that the S-Bahn was increasingly boycotted in West Berlin. Often the slogans chanted were, \\"The S-Bahn driver pays for the barbed wire\\" or \\"No more pennies for Ulbricht\\". So West Berliners took the U-Bahn, the bus and‚Äîif still available‚Äîthe tram. = Line A (U2) in East Berlin = The split of the U-Bahn network left only two lines under the direction of BVG-Ost. The first was the whole of line E (now U5) from Alexanderplatz to Friedrichsfelde, which was opened in 1930. The second line was the eastern part of the line A, mainly opened through the city centre and to Pankow in 1908‚Äì1913. Both these lines crossed in the center of East Berlin at Alexanderplatz, where there was a connection to the S-Bahn. The other two lines in the district centre were under the control of West BVG. The stations located in the Eastern sector were closed and bricked-up, treated as ghost stations. These stations were patrolled by GDR security forces to stop East Berliners escaping to the West via the U-Bahn. The U-Bahn network played a less important role in East Berlin than in West Berlin. The focus in the East was more on the extensive S-Bahn and tram networks. In 58 years (1930‚Äì1987), only one new U-Bahn station (Tierpark) was built in the eastern part of the city, while the S-Bahn expanded and many new tram lines were built. Plans were made to use the part of line C (now U6) on East Berlin territory and to extend line A through the city centre in a tunnel along the Friedrichstra√üe, but these were not put into action. The stations of Stadtmitte, Hausvogteiplatz, Spittelmarkt, Rosa Luxemburg-Platz and Senefelderplatz were remodelled and given new wall tiles in the 1960s, all for show, as U6 ran through without stopping. In 1987, the stations of Markisches Museum and Klosterstra√üe were remodelled, as part of the rebuilding for the celebration of 750th anniversary of Berlin, with artistic representations of the urban development of historic buses and trams instead of the advertising space that was not required in the socialist economic system. Alexanderplatz station did not change and is still preserved almost in its original condition and Potsdamer Platz, which was unused for 32 years, also did not change. =New Station: Bismarckstra√üe= Due to the S-Bahn boycott and closure of the tram network, the U-Bahn was expanded in West-Berlin. However, this affected only the more modern large- profile network (today's U6 to U9). Construction projects on the small-profile network were limited to the construction of new interchanges on new U-Bahn lines. On the route of today's U2, work of this nature was carried out in 1978 in Charlottenburg between the current stations of Deutsche Oper and Sophie- Charlotte-Platz. During the construction of line 7, a line that connects several district centres with each other outside of the actual city centre, several existing lines were crossed. These included lines 4, 2 (now U3), and 1 (now U2). The intersection of lines 1 and 7 was in Bismarckstra√üe / Wilmersdorfer Stra√üe, 380 metres west of Deutsche Oper station. Despite the short distance between the sites, a new station was built to enable interchange. Before the beginning of work on line 7 and Bismarckstra√üe station, the shuttle line from Deutsche Oper to Richard-Wagner-Platz (called \\"line 5\\" in the timetable) was closed. This connection was replaced by the new line 7. As the already 70-year-old tunnel of Line 1 consisted only of weakly reinforced concrete, the BVG simply removed the existing tunnel and rebuilt it with a completely closed reinforced-concrete frame. After that the station was built as a multi-level structure, connecting to street level. The new line 7 platform was 110 metres long and 11.6 metres wide. In contrast, two uncomfortable side platforms, each of which was 4.5 metres wide, were built for the small-profile line. To enable the construction of a central platform, the tracks would have had to be separated and the line closed for a long time. The new station was opened under the name of Bismarckstra√üe together with the extension of line 7 on 28 April 1978. = Temporary uses of the elevated line =  Flea market, Turkish bazaar and museum tram  Wittenbergplatz and (in the background) Nollendorfplatz, 1988 Museum tram on class TM 33 on the elevated line at Nollendorfplatz, 1987 The line in West Berlin between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz near the border with the East had been disused since the wall was built on 13 August 1961. The section between Wittenbergplatz and Gleisdreieck via Nollendorfplatz and B√ºlowstra√üe was rarely used because it was no longer possible to continue to East Berlin at the time. For economic reasons, operations on that section of line, then designated as line 2, were also discontinued on 1 January 1972. Subsequently trains on line 2 from Krumme Lanke ended at Wittenbergplatz. The unused elevated railway line through the north of Sch√∂neberg was then used temporarily for several purposes. The tunnel from Wittenbergplatz towards Nollendorfplatz was used for reversing trains since there was no other way for trains on line 2 to reverse. A flea market popularly known as the Nolle operated at the elevated station of Nollendorfplatz in 16 decommissioned U-Bahn cars from 1973. There was a new restaurant on the tracks operated by Heini Holl, which was called Zur Nolle. An operation similar to Nollendorfplatz station was built at B√ºlowstra√üe‚Äîthis was where the Berliner Jahrmarkt (funfair) began in 1975. Since this project was unsuccessful, it closed a year later. A new business concept started on 28 May 1978. The U-Tropia ‚Äì Bahnhof der Nationen (station of nations) project was set up in two U-Bahn cars that were no longer required. The cars were equipped with toilets and many things were sold in the station itself. In order to increase the attractiveness of the two markets, the BVG established a shuttle service of museum trams on the elevated railway in August 1978. But U-Tropia closed during the next winter. As no new project had been established at B√ºlowstra√üe station, the shuttle service closed. In September 1980, the T√ºrkischer Basar (Turkish bazaar) project opened at B√ºlowstrasse station. This market was successful and continued until the elevated railway was reopened for U-Bahn traffic. The shuttle service on the elevated railway was discontinued on 28 February 1991.  Test track for automatic train operation  After installing Linienzugbeeinflussung (a cab signalling and train protection system) on the line U9, the SelTrac operating system of SEL was tested without passengers on part of the unused section of the elevated railway from 1977 to 1981. This made it possible to run at an absolute braking distance and thus allowed trains to run closer together. The tracks, excluding the section between the U-Bahn stations of B√ºlowstra√üe and Potsdamer Platz, which was being used for other purposes (markets and storage facilities), were equipped with inductive loops for this experiment. SelTrac equipment was installed on two small profile two-car sets. A system was installed with operations management, a dispatching centre, an operations centre, turnout controls and station facilities. The conductor loops were used to transfer movement authorities and other information, as well as location data. For this purpose, the maximum 3.2 km-long inductive loops intersected every 25 metres.  The M-Bahn  M-Bahn cars, here in the DB Nuremberg Transport Museum in 2006 Bridge over Sch√∂neberger Ufer carrying M-Bahn, 1991 U-Bahn services only operated on the upper platform of Gleisdreieck station used by line 1, while there were no passenger services on the lower level. At the request of the Senate of Berlin, the House of Representatives decided on 2 December 1980 to make available the section of the line that had been used in the automatic SelTrac test mode since 1977 to AEG for Maglev test operations. The Senate planned to convert the small profile network of the U-Bahn to magnetic levitation, but this raised considerable concerns in the BVG. Construction work on the new facilities began in December 1983. In addition to the lower platform of Gleisdreieck station, the stations of Bernburger Stra√üe (roughly at the site of today's Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park station) and Kemperplatz were established. The first measured trials on this 1.6 kilometre-long line started a year later. On 19 December 1988, there was an accident at the terminal station of Kemperplatz due to an operating error with the control system when an unoccupied M-Bahn test train went beyond the end of the track, broke through a glass wall and got stuck six metres above the ground. The public was allowed to try out the M-Bahn, as it was called from then on, for free from 28 August 1989. The final approval for the M-Bahn to operate as a new passenger transport system was given by the technical supervisory authority on 18 July 1991. As a result, passengers had to pay the usual BVG tariff for an M-Bahn journey. Just two weeks later, the M-Bahn had to stop operating to make room for construction work to reopen the section of the U2 U-Bahn line that had been closed 30 years earlier. The facilities of the M-Bahn were dismantled and initially stored, as it was intended that they would later be reused for a connection to Sch√∂nefeld Airport. This idea was later discarded and the material scrapped. There are no remains of the line. An M-Bahn car is displayed at the Oldtimer Museum R√ºgen in Prora on an original piece of the line. = Fall of the wall and reunification of the networks = After the opening of the border on 9 November 1989, numerous temporary measures were taken to cope with the huge cross-border traffic. While S-Bahn services were quickly restored at Friedrichstra√üe station, it was not possible to reconnect line A quickly after it had been disrupted for 28 years. However, the so-called \\"ghost stations\\" (closed stations, which were passed without stopping) on the U6 and U8 reopened, so interchange was enabled from East Berlin's line A to West Berlin's U6 and U8 at Stadtmitte and Alexanderplatz stations respectively. On 1 July 1990, East Berlin's lines A and E were integrated into the western numbering scheme of the BVG. Line A was given the line number \\"U2\\". That led to a three-year-long curiosity, since the two U2s were not yet connected. Three months later, on 3 October 1990, the day of the reunification, the Berlin U-Bahn network was largely free pf \\"Communist \\" station names, which were mostly replaced by politically-neutral names. This involved renaming two stations on the U2 line: \\"Dimitroffstra√üe\\" to \\"Eberswalder Stra√üe\\", and \\"Otto-Grotewohl-Stra√üe\\" to \\"Mohrenstra√üe\\". The new station name of Eberswalder Strasse resulted from a power struggle between the Senate and Prenzlauer Berg district: since the latter refused to rename the former Danziger Strasse, which was named after the Bulgarian Communist Party leader Georgi Dimitroff. The BVG, on the order of the senator responsible for transport matters, renamed the elevated station after the street opposite, even though Eberswalder Stra√üe was much less significant. It has retained its name after Dimitroffstrasse was returned to its original name in 1995. Against the resistance from the conservative side, however, one name was retained: since Rosa Luxemburg also has numerous streets and squares named after her in western Germany, it was not possible to rename Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz back to Sch√∂nhauser Tor. In 1991, work began on rebuilding the missing link between the two parts of the U2, the section from Wittenbergplatz via Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz to Mohrenstrasse. This required some obstacles to be overcome and problems to be solved. The interim uses applied in the Sch√∂neberg elevated stations described above had to be ended and the M-Bahn line had to be dismantled. In the area of Potsdamer Platz station directly below the former border, the numerous security and border installations had to be removed. Finally, after numerous renovations, conversions and demolitions, the two lines were reconnected on 13 November 1993. At the time of the reopening, services on the Berlin small profile network were rearranged: * U1, previously Ruhleben ‚Äì Schlesisches Tor, now Krumme Lanke ‚Äì Schlesisches Tor * U2, previously Krumme Lanke ‚Äì Wittenbergplatz (West) and Mohrenstra√üe ‚Äì Vinetastra√üe (Ost), now Vinetastra√üe ‚Äì Ruhleben. * U3, previously Uhlandstra√üe ‚Äì Wittenbergplatz, now as U15, Uhlandstra√üe ‚Äì Schlesisches Tor. * a new night service, U12, Ruhleben ‚Äì Schlesisches Tor, on the route of the former U1. However, the U12 was discontinued in 2003 when night services were introduced on the weekend on almost all Berlin U-Bahn lines. =Two new stations in late 1990s= When the U2 reopened in 1993, preliminary work had been carried out on a new station on it. At the time, the ramp between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz stations had to be built completely rebuilt to enable the 120-metre-long station to be completely horizontal. Therefore, the ramp was redesigned and built a little steeper. The need for this station arose from the completion of new developments around Potsdamer Platz. A station with the provisional name of Hafenplatz was built by the BVG with two side platforms and opened as Mendelssohn-Bartholdy-Park station on 1 October 1998. The construction works were done without impeding the operation of U2. The station, designed by the architects Hilmer & Sattler und Albrecht is 619 m from Potsdamer Platz and 469 m from Gleisdreieck stations. For decades, there had been plans for an extension of the U2 to Pankow S-Bahn station. In 1930, the line had been extended to Vinetastra√üe. A further extension towards the north was not built due to the Great Depression. Even during the Nazi era, the development plans always provided for the U2 to go at least to Pankow station or even to Pankower Kirche. It was the same in the GDR in the late 1980s, there were even announcements made about its construction. This was mainly because BVG lacked a workshop for small-profile rolling stock. All trains were serviced either in the Friedrichsfelde large-profile workshop or in the Reichsbahn's Schoeneweide workshop, which acquired the function of a main workshop. These premises were no longer considered acceptable and so space was sought for a new workshop, since the existing (very small) workshop at Rosa- Luxemburg-Platz station did not meet the requirements. This was to be built east of the Pankow freight yard on Granitzstra√üe. As part of these plans, the U-Bahn line would be extended by one station. Part of the planned tunnel extension was completed in 1988; after the fall of the wall, the tunnel has converted into a reversing facility. It was not until the mid 1990s that an extension began to be considered again. New interchanges were provided between the S-Bahn and U-Bahn at numerous points on the U-Bahn network, this included the extension of the U2 to Pankow. The groundbreaking ceremony for this new expansion of the network took place on 13 June 1997. The construction of a new small-profile workshop, as announced in GDR times, was also considered. While it was decided not to proceed with this project, since the current Grunewald workshop could carry out all work required without capacity problem, the foundations of a connection to a workshop were provided. Extremely difficult ground conditions, the high water table and the discovery of a medieval settlement slowed progress significantly. On 16 September 2000, the new line was opened with a new station providing interchange to the S-Bahn. The estimated cost of the works was DM 126 million, but it ended up costing only DM 105 million. During the planning, the new station was referred to as \\"Bahnhof Pankow\\", but the BVG opened it under the name \\"Pankow\\". The 110 metre-long U-Bahn station with its blue, white and yellow colour scheme had skylights, which were rare in the Berlin U-Bahn network, to enable natural light to penetrate into the station. It was designed by the architect Orlando Figallo. During the construction, a generous entrance building was built at the same time with a lift and escalators to provided convenient connections to S-Bahn line S2 to Bernau. There are also still plans according to which the U2 line would be extended to the old parish church in Breiten Stra√üe in Pankow. This plan is also included in the Berlin Senate's 2030 financial scenario. This is consider a medium-term priority. The two stations were the first built on Berlin's small-profile network in decades. = Further renovation and modernisation = Spittelmarkt station was restored to its original state. Alexanderplatz U-Bahn station to provide barrier-free access at all station levels. An extensive renovation program is currently being carried out on line U2 and this will continue for the next few years. The Senefelderplatz‚ÄìVinetastra√üe section was closed for several months for the opening of the section to Pankow station. Nevertheless, the stations and the track of the former line A suffered considerably during the GDR era, so the remaining stations in former East Berlin also had to be renovated. M√§rkisches Museum station was refurbished in 2003 and now also has a lift. The large interchange station of Alexanderplatz also received an all-round renovation and five lifts were installed. BVG had Olympia-Stadion station completely renovated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup for ‚Ç¨4.47 million. In addition to new platform slabs and the refurbishment of the entrance building, it received two lifts that can be reached by an independent bridge from the station forecourt. Another renovation project is also under way on the Alexanderplatz‚ÄìStadtmitte section. Here the BVG plans to restore Stadtmitte, Hausvogteiplatz and Spittelmarkt stations to their original condition. The renewal of Spittelmarkt station has already been completed. The window gallery has been reopened there and the walls at the rear of the track have been decorated with newly fired ceramic tiles displaying various historical cityscapes. In addition, the BVG found in 2005 that a bridge between the Gleisdreieck and B√ºlowstra√üe stations, which dates back to the early days of the Berlin U-Bahn and was not renovated after German reunification has been significantly damaged. The renovation of the structure, which lies directly above the tunnel mouth of the North‚ÄìSouth mainline tunnel, started on 18 August 2006 and was originally intended to last until the end of the year. Due to problems with the manufacturing of the new steel bridge, the BVG extended the construction work until March 2007. During this period, the U2 was interrupted: the eastern Pankow‚ÄìGleisdreieck section was operated almost independently‚Äîapart from the connection at Alexanderplatz U-Bahn station. Only push-pull trains ran every ten minutes between Gleisdreieck and Potsdamer Platz due to the difficult situation. The western Ruhleben‚ÄìWittenbergplatz section was extended to Warschauer Strasse and formed the new line U12. At this time the Nollendorfplatz‚ÄìB√ºlowstra√üe‚ÄìGleisdreieck section was closed. Line U1, on the other hand, was shortened to the Wittenbergplatz‚ÄìUhlandstra√üe section, as in earlier times, while services on line U3 was extended by two stations to Gleisdreieck during the peak. In a ‚Ç¨7‚Äì8 million reconstruction, the bridge was straightened at the same time, which enabled the top speed to be increased from 40 to 50 km/h. Other projects, such as the modernisation of the U1 elevated line or Jannowitzbr√ºcke station were delayed due to the ‚Ç¨8 million renovation that had not been included in the BVG budget. Regular traffic on the U2 line was resumed on 19 March 2007 after the construction work had been completed. After the fire at Deutsche Oper station, the BVG decided to retrofit all stations that had only one exit with a second exit for safety reasons. Since the spring of 2006, the stations of Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Sophie-Charlotte-Platz and Deutsche Oper have had a second exit installed at the other end of the platform. In addition to the renovation program, the installation of lifts continues. In recent years Sch√∂nhauser Allee, M√§rkisches Museum, Alexanderplatz, Stadtmitte, Gleisdreieck, Theodor-Heuss-Platz, Olympia-Stadion and, in early 2009, Potsdamer Platz station, which is very important for tourists, have been given a lift. The 1.7 km-long viaduct of the elevated railway between the stations of Pankow and Senefelderplatz was extensively renovated in 2009 and 2010 at a cost of almost ‚Ç¨100 million. Eberswalder Stra√üe station received a lift as part of this work. This means that 20 of the 29 stations had barrier-free access in 2015.  Timetable Since the timetable change on 12 December 12 2004, only every second train has operated to Ruhleben during peak and off- peak hours; the others stopped short at Theodor-Heuss-Platz. Since 1990, there has been continuous night services on Friday and Saturday nights on the Ruhleben‚ÄìWittenbergplatz route (then line U1). In 2003, this was extended to the entire U2 line. There was already a ten-minute night service on the Vinetastra√üe‚ÄìMohrenstra√üe (then Otto-Grotewohl-Stra√üe) route in East Berlin. { style=\\"background-color:#EFEFEF;\\" border=\\"0\\" cellspacing=\\"2\\" cellpadding=\\"3\\" - ! width=\\"140\\" Line ! width=\\"120\\" Mon‚ÄìThu (peak) (7:00‚Äì9:30 and 14:30‚Äì19:00) ! width=\\"120\\" Mon‚ÄìThu (shoulder) (6:00‚Äì7:00, 9:30‚Äì14:30 and 19:00‚Äì21:00) ! width=\\"120\\" Fri (peak) (7:00‚Äì9:30 and 14:30‚Äì18:30) ! width=\\"120\\" Fri (shoulder) (6:00‚Äì7:00, 9:30‚Äì14:30 and 18:30‚Äì22:30) ! width=\\"120\\" Sat (10.00‚Äì22:30) ! width=\\"120\\" Sun and public holidays (12:30‚Äì19:00) ! width=\\"120\\" Off-peak (Mon‚ÄìFri 4:30‚Äì6:00; Mon‚ÄìThu from 21:00; Fri+Sat from 22:30 and Sun 19:00‚Äì0:30/Sat 5:30‚Äì10:00 and Sun 7:00‚Äì12:30) ! width=\\"120\\" Night Fri/Sat and Sat/Sun and on nights before public holidays (Fri/Sat 0:30‚Äì5:30 and Sat/Sun 0:30‚Äì7:00) - style=\\"background-color:#FFFFFF\\" Pankow ‚Üî Theodor-Heuss-Platz 4 min school holidays: min 5 min 4 min school holidays: min 5 min 5 min 5 min 10 min 15 min - style=\\"background:#FFFFFF\\" Theodor-Heuss-Platz ‚Üî Ruhleben 8 min school holidays 9 min 10 min 8 min school holidays 9 min 10 min 10 min 10 min 10 min 15 min - style=\\"background:#FFFFFF\\"  colspan=\\"10\\" During the nights of Fri/Sat and Sat/Sun, the U2 trains run every 15 minutes between Pankow and Ruhleben from 0:30 a.m. to around 4:30 a.m. During the nights from Sun/Mon to Thu/Fri, night bus line N2 substitutes for the U-Bahn services. } = Increase in frequencies= Under the Berlin Senate's local transport plan for 2019‚Äì2023 the frequency is to be reduced to 3.3 minutes by 2023 during the peak hour. Future Plans There are still plans to extend the U2 towards Pankow Kirche or Rosenthaler Weg. This extension is the only development of the small- profile network included in the Berlin Senate's financial scenario for 2030. In the west, an extension is planned from Ruhleben to Stadtrandstra√üe, via Ruhlebener Stra√üe, Tiefwerder Weg, Rathaus Spandau, Flankenschanze, Zeppelinstra√üe, Westerwaldstra√üe, Falkenhagener Feld and Stadtrandstra√üe. It has been deferred to after 2030 because the expected patronage is not high enough to justify the extension.

It serves five stations, with only the two termini being step-free. History In 1903, the then-independent town of Sch√∂neberg, south-west of Berlin, planned to develop an underground railway line to improve public transportation. As the line promised less profit, the negotiations with the former () were unsuccessful. Consequently, Sch√∂neberg started to build the line itself on 8 December 1908. Two years later, the construction was finished and, on 1 December 1910, the line was put into operation, as Line BI. Because this line was separate from the pre-existing underground railway, new equipment was required; Sch√∂neberg chose to use tracks and trains compatible with the rest of the fledgeling network, allowing future connections. Although Sch√∂neberg owned the track, upon opening, it handed operations over to the Hochbahngesellschaft. The service depot, located after Innsbrucker Platz station, was expanded in 1926 upon the opening of the U-Bahn platforms of Nollendorfplatz station and was closed in 1932. After World War II a high school was built at the site of the former U4 depot. Nowadays, trains use a spur track that connects line U4 to line U1 where they can access the Warschauer Stra√üe Depot on the latter line. From 1985 until 1993 automatic train operation using the SelTrac system was trialled on line U4. The SelTrac system used on line U4 was manufactured by Standard Elektrik Lorenz (now part of Alcatel-Lucent), and allowed very tight headways of 50 to 90 seconds.  History  The city of Sch√∂neberg wanted to increase growth, and so decided in 1903 to build an U-Bahn line. There were talks with the Berlin Hochbahngesellschaft (U-Bahn operator). However, the interests of the operator and the city did not match, because the short distance wouldn't bring any profit. So the city of Sch√∂neberg took matters into its own hands and planned the first municipal U-Bahn in Germany. The route was intended as an underground railway from Nollendorfplatz, at which the elevated train station of the Berlin Hoch- und Untergrundbahn was already located, to the hauptstrasse in the south of Sch√∂neberg. An extension to the north was not excluded, even a route to Weissensee (following the proposed U3/U10 alignment) was proposed. First, however, the stations Nollendorfplatz (own tunnel station on Motzstra√üe in front of the existing station), Victoria-Luise-Platz, Bayerischer Platz, Stadtpark (today: Rathaus Sch√∂neberg) and Hauptstrasse (today: Innsbrucker Platz) planned. South of the station hauptstrasse, the workshop was to be built. Siemens & Halske AEG were given the responsibility of the entire construction, including the equipment of the track and the delivery of the vehicles. All standards were adapted to the already existing Berlin U-Bahn and subway, as in the future a direct connection to the City U-bahn Hochbahngesellschaft was planned. Therefore, the execution of the route was carried out with the dimensions and electrical equipment of the Berlin Kleinprofil (small-profile) network. The groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 8, 1908 in a folk festival-like atmosphere. Next to the construction of the subway was Rudolph Wilde Park, which at that time was called the station Stadtpark. As the park was built on a marshy fens that was up to 30 meters deep, the excavation of the tunnels with a total volume of around 850,000 m¬≥ was used to drain and fill it. After two years of construction, the line was opened on 1 December 1910. However, the festivities were very restrained, as the largest Sch√∂neberg sponsor of the underground, Mayor Rudolph Wilde, had died a month earlier. Since the Sch√∂neberg subway (initially) was completely separate from the (other) Berlin network, extra facilities had to be built for this. These included its own wagons and the depot with a workshop. At Nollendorfplatz, a pedestrian tunnel was built between the two stations. South of the station Innsbrucker Platz, the tunnel was continued into Eisackstra√üe. There was a three - track crossover and parking facility in the tunnel. From the western track, the workshop access line branched off to the workshop, which swung in to a private tunnel to Otzenstra√üe and reached the daylight on the workshop area. At the end of the tunnel in Otzenstra√üe, today there is still visible the tunnel exit. At the end of the workshop area there was another short tunnel where the access track ended. The workshop received a five-track wagon hall and a two-track workshop hall. The small Sch√∂neberg workshop was rendered unused with the opening of the new interchange station at Nollendorfplatz in 1926 and therefore decommissioned in 1932, as a permissive vehicle exchange and the achievement of the large workshops of the U-Bahn at the olympic-stadion station and at Warschauer Brucke were possible. On the workshop grounds, the Waldenburg High School was built after the Second World War. The city of Sch√∂neberg was indeed owner and owner of the route, but the operation was run by the Berlin Hochbahngesellschaft. Thus, the different ownership conditions did not matter at all for the passengers, since one day before the opening a collective agreement had been reached. On November 27, 2010, on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Sch√∂neberg subway, special traffic with historical rolling stock (type A1) took place.

It runs from Alexanderplatz in Mitte eastwards through Friedrichshain, Lichtenberg and Friedrichsfelde, surfaces in to pass Kaulsdorf and Hellersdorf above ground and finally reaches city limits at H√∂now. U5 at present only connects to other U-Bahn lines at its Alexanderplatz terminus, although work is ongoing to extend it across central Berlin to Berlin Hauptbahnhof, providing further U-Bahn and S-Bahn interchanges. History =Early history= Before control of the U-Bahn network was handed over completely to the BVG in 1929, the Hochbahngesellschaft started construction on a final line that, in contrast to its previous lines, was built as part of the Gro√üprofil network. It was supposed to be a branch for the U2, which starts from Klosterstra√üe in 1908. The E line ran under Frankfurter Allee, for which the company had received the concession in 1914, between Alexanderplatz and Friedrichsfelde before the World War II. The construction work proceeded since 1927 without delay or undue expense, and the first servicing station was established in the eastern part of the city; the line opened on 21 December 1930, named Line E. The several stations do include: *Alexanderplatz (interchange) *Schillingstra√üe *Strausberger Platz *Memeler Stra√üe (today's Weberwiese) *Petersburger Stra√üe (today's Frankfurter Tor) *Samariterstra√üe *Frankfurter Allee (interchange with S-Bahn) *Magdalenenstra√üe *Lichtenberg (interchange with Ringbahn) *Friedrichsfelde (end terminus and depot) =Tierpark extension= Heavy bomb damage caused by Allied air raids and invaded water at the end of the war severely curtailed operations in the first post-war months. Thereafter, the trains of this line had to be sent as reparations to Moscow and replaced accordingly. Only in the 1960s were comprehensively new trains procured, until 1968 still small profile trains were still in use. Line E was the only purely East Berlin line. For a long time, it was planned to extend it beyond its former terminus Friedrichsfelde and to lead via Karlshorst to Obersch√∂neweide. Karlshorst was especially known for its villa colony. There, after the war, the Soviet military administration established itself. But both reasons were not sufficient to extend the line E to Karlshorst. Due to the large demand for housing in Berlin, a large part of the construction capacity was needed for housing construction. The areas intended for housing included the areas west of the Tierpark zoo. For about 25,000 residents, 9,000 apartments were to be built here. To connect this residential area better to the city center, it was decided to extend the subway line E by one stop. In addition, about 2.5 million zoo visitors per year were expected. For these expected passenger flows, it was worthwhile to extend the subway. During the time when Berlin was divided, the U5 was the only line to fall entirely within East Berlin, and the only line to be actively extended by the East German authorities. Work on this extension was started in September 1969. On 6 June 1973, the first extension was opened, to Tierpark station, serving the zoo. =Final extension= Wuhletal, the connection between the S-Bahn and the U-Bahn In the 1970s, there were also plans to extend the line over to Hellersdorf. For this purpose, the then district Marzahn was divided into Marzahn and Hellersdorf. Due to the large extent of the developing area, a rapid transit connection to the centre of East Berlin, Alexanderplatz was needed. For this purpose, several proposals were developed. The idea to build the S-Bahn, as done previously for the new residential areas in Marzahn and Hohensch√∂nhausen, was rejected because the trams were already heavily utilised and could not accommodate another train group. An express tram, which was realised in Potsdam, would not have sufficient capacity. Only the extension of the subway (U5) fulfilled all the requirements. Again, there were several route variants. It was decided to run the underground above ground on the unused railway line of the VnK route (connection to Kaulsdorf). In addition, an interchange at Wuhletal for connection to the S5 S-Bahn line, was needed. The extension was planned in the years 1983 and 1984. It would be 10.1 kilometers long and have nine stations. The new building, which was almost completely above ground, was opened in two sections. Construction began on 1 March 1985. The final extension went into service on 1 July 1988 (Elsterwerdaer Platz) and 1 July 1989 (H√∂now). The last two stations of the extension, Louis-Lewin-Stra√üe and H√∂now, were originally located outside Berlin city limit, in Bezirk Frankfurt. The area was joined to Berlin at German reunification in 1990. All stations were designed by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (EVDR) design and surveying operations. For the first time, the stations were equipped with ramps to enable step-free access to platforms for passengers with prams and wheelchairs. At Hellersdorf a connection to the local tram was created: the stops islands can be reached via a tunnel, the crossing of the street is thus eliminated. =Signalling= After reunification, the U5 was upgraded to the new signalling system under Systemtechnik f√ºr den automatischen Regelbetrieb (STAR). The test stretch is from Friedrichsfelde to Biesdorf-S√ºd, using H-Zug trains, which were introduced from 1996 to April 2000. The Class H, used on the U5 can be converted to fully automatic train operation, and there is still a Bombardier test train, built in 1995, who can drive the train automatically. In contrast to the testing with LZB 501 on the U9 line as well as SelTrac on U2 and U4 lines, which used transmission of information between route control and the train using line conductor loops (Linienzugbeeinflussung), STAR made use of radio technology (Funkzugbeeinflussung). When the Berlin Senate reiterated in 2002 that the U5 should initially not be extended further, the BVG announced that it would no longer pursue the automatic operation project. An operation on the U5 Alexanderplatz - H√∂now would have made little sense according to the BVG. At that time, the BVG was the technology leader. The underground lines U2 and U3 of the Nuremberg U-Bahn are the first automated subway lines in Germany since 2008 and 2010, respectively. In the previous 1980s driverless operation on the U4 a driver continued to be present but supervised the ride only. =Refurbishment= At reunification, the line was renumbered as U5 to match the naming system in use in West Berlin. Between January 2003 and December 2004, reconstruction was conducted between Alexanderplatz and Friedrichsfelde in order to repair damage dating back to World War II. Not all the stations were preserved as monumental value. 1330 meters of railway track and tracks were relocated. For this purpose, the train traffic on the route was interrupted for three months. The aim was to improve the quality of stay at the stations. The lighting has been renewed and brighter, the technology has been brought up to date, the plaster has been extensively renovated and the walls have been clad in vandalism with enamelled sheet steel. The BVG took over Grenander's principle of identifying colors, but chose new color patterns. Numerous metro stations have been equipped with lifts and barrier- free. An example of a completely new design, including the rebuilding of the northern end of the station, is the Schillingstra√üe station. In time for the International Garden Exhibition 2017, and neighboring \\"gardens of the world\\", the station Neu Grottkauer Stra√üe was redeveloped in the spring of 2017 to provide a lift, new roof and new lighting, and renamed Kienberg (Gardens of the World). The renaming occurred at the timetable change in December 2016. The cost of all measures has been estimated at around ‚Ç¨ 6.6 million. The latest stations, built between 1973 and 1989 from Tierpark to H√∂now should be placed under monument protection, with the exception of this is the already significantly changed subway station Kienberg (Garten der Welt). A refurbishment of the other aboveground stations built in GDR times is not planned before the middle of the 2020s. Equipped with elevators for fully accessible access is not planned until the lift program is completed on the rest of the metro network. The existing ramp systems with a slope of around 10% are only considered as barrier-free. =Former U5= There used to be former U5 running from Deutsche Oper to Richard-Wagner-Platz, from 1 March 1966 to 1 May 1970. Before 1966, it was numbered AI and BI and the branch line as AIII. In 1970, the stretch was closed and in 1974, the station was demolished.  Plans  There have long been plans to extend the U5 westward. The short U55 line opened in August 2009, and runs from Berlin Hauptbahnhof via the Bundestag U-Bahn station to Brandenburger Tor station. The designation of the line as U55 indicates that it is ultimately intended to become part of the U5 line. Construction of the link to enable this commenced in April 2010 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The link will be in length, and connect the Brandenburger Tor terminus of the current U55 to the Alexanderplatz terminus of the current U5. Along its route it will serve new U-bahn stations at Berliner Rathaus, Museumsinsel and Unter den Linden, with the latter providing an interchange with line U6. = Further planning = In the long term, there are plans to extend the line from Berlin Hauptbahnhof, via Turmstra√üe and Jungfernheide to Flughafen Tegel. This plan was postponed due to the route being too long, the pending closure of Tegel Airport and the poor fiscal position of Berlin. An addition to the plan is extension towards Rathaus Reinickendorf via Cit√© Pasteur Nord, Scharnweberstra√üe and Eichborndamm. The stations that were involved in the extension include: *Alt- Moabit *Turmstra√üe *Huttenstra√üe *Goslarer Platz *Jungfernheide *Hakenfelde *Urban Tech Republic *Cit√© Pasteur Nord *Scharnweberstra√üe *Eichborndamm *Rathaus Reinckendorf In September 2016, the longer extension has been replaced by the tram extension from Hauptbahnhof, via Turmstra√üe, Mierendorffplatz, Jungfernheide, and towards the Tegel Airport, and it might be redeveloped into a new Urban Tech Republic development area, after Tegel Airport is closed, thus allowing the U5 to be shortened to just Berlin Hauptbahnhof. The possibility of extending the tram line to Cit√© Pasteur Nord, Scharnweberstra√üe and Eichborndamm to Rathaus Reinickendorf is still there in the vision stage. The tram extension was planned to be completed just before 2028. At Jungfernheide, two island platforms were constructed for the planned interchange station between U7 and U5. The finished section is used for firefighting exercises in conjunction with airport security and the BVG. Trains that are used include 2712/2713 ('9 Zoolog. Garten') and 2714/2715 (Jakob-Kaiser-Platz), of which they were vandalised with legal spray painting. During the opening of 1980, Jungfernheide was in a deadlock because of the Berlin Wall, that prevented U5 from extending towards the west.  Frequency U5's frequency is about 5 minutes during peak periods. Alternate trains will terminate at Kaulsdorf-Nord during off-peak periods, thus the lower demand section is 10 minutes. Since 2003, U5 has offered 15-minute weekend night service, the replacement bus service \\"N5\\" was offered during weekday nights.

Entrance to the Borsigwerke station U6 is a Berlin U-Bahn line, long line with 29 stations. It runs in a north-south direction from the Berlin locality of Tegel in the north via Friedrichstra√üe to Mariendorf, a locality in the southern part of the city. It is a so-called large profile (\\"Gro√üprofil\\") line.For historical reasons, the Berlin U-Bahn has cars of two different widths (designated small profile and large profile) despite their common track gauge (similar to the A and B Divisions of the New York City Subway). This necessitates independent operation of the lines on which they travel and a separate servicing infrastructure because of the different tunnel diameters and power supply systems. The narrower cars were built until 1930. During the Cold War, both U6 termini were in the former West Berlin but the line passed under East Berlin for a short section of its route. Five of its stations were sealed off by East German authorities and the trains went through these so-called ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù without stopping, while a sixth, Friedrichstra√üe, remained open primarily as a transfer station between the U6 and the S-Bahn lines using the north-south S-Bahn tunnel, but also as an official border crossing between East and West Berlin. It was formerly named \\"CI\\" from 1923 to 1928. Current routing U6 begins its journey from its northern terminus in central Tegel, first running in a southeasterly direction underground along the path of Berliner Stra√üe to the Borsigwerke station, after which it surfaces to run on an embankment beside Seidelstra√üe and Scharnweberstra√üe. Just after the Scharnweberstra√üe station it enters a tunnel and continues under M√ºllerstra√üe (which becomes Chausseestra√üe and then Friedrichstra√üe). From this point it runs in a distinctly southerly direction. After Mehringplatz at the Hallesches Tor station, U6 crosses under the Landwehr Canal and swings slightly westwards to run parallel to Mehringdamm, which changes its name to Tempelhofer Damm at the Platz der Luftbr√ºcke station, and then to Mariendorfer Damm after crossing the Teltow Canal. U6 crosses this canal in a conduit attached to and immediately below the road- traffic bridge. The line ends at the intersection of Reisseckstra√üe, Friedenstra√üe and Mariendorfer Damm at its terminus, the Alt-Mariendorf station.  History  = Beginnings = As early as 1901 the city of Berlin had plans for a subway running from north to south under Friedrichstra√üe. Werner von Siemens also had plans for a line under that impressive street, but at the time the city decided the transport system should be in public hands and began construction of the so-called North-South Line from Wedding to Tempelhof, with a branch to Neuk√∂lln. This work was delayed and finally abandoned due to difficulties associated with World War I. Relics of this early phase up to 1918 can still be found in the rolled-steel support pillars at the Oranienburger Tor station, still bearing the trade name of the supplying rolling mill, Rombach in Alsace-Lorraine. The North-South line (now U6/U7) showing its name and extent in 1930 In 1919 work was resumed, but during the post-war hyperinflation period the filling in of the already existing tunnel was proposed in 1921. However it was decided to continued construction after all, and on 30 January 1923 the first tunnel section was opened between Hallesches Tor and Stettiner Bahnhof (the latter going by the name of Naturkundemuseum station since 13 December 2009, replacing the name Zinnowitzer Stra√üe station). A northwest extension was opened on 8 March 1923 between Stettiner Bahnhof and Seestra√üe, with a maintenance workshop being built at the Seestra√üe station. At the junction Mohrenstra√üe and Friedrichstra√üe two subway lines intersected for the first time: the city‚Äôs North-South Line, renamed Line C, and the private Central Line (Centrumsline). But as the concept of a tower station (accommodating two lines stacked one above the other) was not well known, the city of Berlin built its own station, named Leipziger Stra√üe (now Stadtmitte),160 meters from the Central Line station. The result is that passengers transferring between the two lines still today have to walk through a long connecting pedestrian tunnel, popularly known by Berliners as the ‚Äúmouse route‚Äù (\\"M√§usetunnel\\"). At Belle- Alliance Stra√üe (now named Mehringdamm) where the line separated into two branches, three tracks were built. From the western track (side platform), trains ran to both termini, Tempelhof and Neuk√∂lln; the central platform was used for trains heading downtown, the middle track for those coming from Neuk√∂lln and the eastern track for trains coming from Tempelhof. In the course of constructing the U7 line, the station was completely redesigned and is now called Mehringdamm. Due to disputes with the administrative district of Tempelhof, the first route to be built was the branch to Neuk√∂lln. Work on the other branch only began in 1924, but just two years later, on 14 February 1926, the stretch from Belle-Alliance-Stra√üe to Kreuzberg (now the Platz der Luftbr√ºcke station) was opened. A year later this second branch extended to Tempelhof Airport (now the Paradestra√üe station). This now-closed airport was located to the east of the U6 track. In 1929 the line was extended to intersect with the S-Bahn‚Äôs Tempelhof station on the circle line (Ringbahn). A large ticket hall was erected for both S- and U-Bahn passengers. Since the station had to be built very deep to accommodate the subway line, there was room for a spacious ticket hall. =The northern extension= Even as construction of the North-South/C Line began there were plans to extend it to Berlin-Tegel, and 400 meters of tunnel had been prepared by 1929. This extension from the existing Seestra√üe station to the center of Tegel made several bus and tram lines redundant and for that reason this stretch was the first to be worked on after the war in the western part of the city. The first pile was driven on 26 October 1953 at M√ºllerstra√üe north of the Seestra√üe station. The stretch was built in two sections: *Seestra√üe to Kurt-Schumacher- Platz *Kurt-Schumacher-Platz to Tegel For reasons of cost and because of a very high water table there, north of Kurt-Schumacher-Platz it was decided to put the track on an embankment instead of in a cutting. A ramp raise the track 15 meters to an embankment and onward to Berlin‚Äôs first station for large profile cars, the Scharnweberstra√üe station. After passing the Holzhauser Stra√üe station on this northwestern stretch, the tracks return underground, following the course of Berliner Stra√üe to the center of Berlin-Tegel. The embankment station at Scharnweberstra√üe The underground northern terminus of U6, Alt-Tegel (formerly Tegel) As was the case before World War II, the stations had a very functional design with its surfaces covered with bright, pastel-colored ceramic tiles. The embankment stations were built of reinforced concrete, which was typical for the time. Nowadays this gives them a very bulky appearance so they do not radiate the charm of many of the suburban stations, such as those on the U3 line to the south. A first section was opened on 3 May 1956, the second on 31 May 1958. With the opening of the C Line the northern Berlin Transport Company (BVG) network was completely restructured and numerous tram lines in this area could be eliminated. = \\"Ghost stations\\" = The Schwartzkopffstra√üe station in 2004. It was one of the ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù closed from 1961 to 1990 After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, on the orders of German Democratic Republic interior minister Karl Maron all U6 stations inside East Berlin were closed to passenger traffic, except for the Friedrichstra√üe station. At that station, West-Berlin passengers could transfer to the S-Bahn or enter East Berlin via the established border crossing there. This order turned all remaining closed stations into so-called \\"ghost stations\\", through which trains were required to pass without stopping and which could only be entered by East German border and traffic policemen. To service the area formerly accessible to the East Berlin population via the U6, until the ghost stations were reopened a bus line 59 was established between the Walter Ulbricht-Stadium, later renamed World Youth Stadium (Stadion der Weltjugend), and Leipziger Stra√üe. The ghost stations did not appear on East German city maps. They were successively renovated and opened between 11 November 1989, the fall of the Berlin Wall (U8 Jannowitzbr√ºcke station) and 1 July 1990, the date of German reunification (the last U6 stations to open were Stadion der Weltjugend/Schwartzkopfstra√üe., Nordbahnhof/Naturkundenmuseum, Oranienburger Tor, Franz√∂sische Stra√üe and Stadtmitte).J√ºrgen Meyer-Kronthaler, Klaus Kurpjuweit. Berliner U-Bahn - In Fahrt seit uber hundert Jahren, be.bra verlag Berlin, pp. 142-143 A cold war curiosity: Schwartzkopffstra√üe station, renamed Walter-Ulbricht Stadion in April 1951 after the newly built sports field, was one of the five U6 ghost stations. Nevertheless, on 15 March, the 1973 East Berlin authorities did not hesitate to rename the underground station which had been deserted for eleven years Stadion der Weltjugend ‚Äì the signs with the station name visible only to (mostly West-Berlin) subway passengers as their train passed through the station. = Completion of line 6 = As with the northern extension to Tegel, ever since construction of Line C began it was planned to extend it to Alt- Mariendorf as the southern terminus. The Nazis had planned to extend the line even further south to the Mariendorf horse race track (Trabrennbahn Mariendorf). When work on the long-awaited extension began, there were debates about the cost and it was, for example, proposed to lay the track in a cutting next to the Tempelhofer Damm/Mariendorf Damm roads. The public transport company BVG objected, arguing that easy access to the Tempelhof municipal offices (Rathaus Tempelhof) and the main shopping street would only be possible with an underground line. Trimodal transport at the Teltow Canal near the Ullsteinstra√üe station: road vehicles, U-Bahn conduit and canal sightseeing barge The first pile for the 3.5-kilometer route was driven on 6 March 1961 and the Alt-Mariendorf terminus station was opened on 28 February 1966. The route is from the S-and U-Bahn station Tempelhof straight south along the Tempelhofer Damm to the Teltow canal. Similar to the construction of today‚Äôs U7 line to Rudow, the canal posed the biggest problem for the track in this area and an unusual solution was found. The U6 tracks are contained in a construction underneath and connected to the lower part of the road traffic bridge over the canal. The side with the northbound rail was built with enough space for the Ullsteinstra√üe station. Since the canal shipping required a vertical clearance of 4.6 meters, ramps were built to raise the road 1.2 meters above its original level. Ullsteinstra√üe station South of the Teltow Canal the U6 follows Mariendorfer Damm to the terminus station Alt-Mariendorf, which was built at the junction of the roads Rei√üeckstra√üe/Friedensstra√üe and Mariendorfer Damm. From here, several bus routes service the sparsely developed surroundings. This expansion completed the U6 line. Further extensions are not planned. Except for the Alt-Tempelhof station, all stations were designed by the architect Rainer G. R√ºmmler. As with the southern part of the U7 line, he used large rectangular ceramic tiles to surface the station walls. = Reopening = Station restoration and modification of the platforms and tunnels was started after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and all the former ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù had been opened by 1 July 1990. When the U6 was built between 1912 and 1923, money was scarce because of World War I and the subsequent hyperinflation period, and the tight budgetary situation of the city of Berlin as the owner of the new North-South line did not leave much of a financial margin. The stations for the small-profile trains, built earlier, had been more attractively designed, whereas the U6 merely had white plaster finishing. The only distinguishing feature for each station was a characteristic color for the columns and station signs. The length of the platforms was also reduced. Lengths of 110‚Äì120 meters were customary for the platforms built later, but at that time only 80-meter platforms were constructed. Already in the 1970s the first capacity problems arose because only four-car trains could be accommodated on these platforms. Therefore, in the 1960s and 1970s the West Berlin subway stations were modified to extend the platforms so longer trains could be used. But since modification of the U6‚Äôs three border stations, Friedrichstra√üe, Kochstra√üe and Reinckendorfer Stra√üe, was either not possible or would have involved paying a considerable sum of money to East Germany, and since the trains did not even stop at the 5 ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù, only four-car trains could be operated on the U6 line. As compensation, the trains arrived at 3-minute intervals during rush hours. The Friedrichstra√üe station needed longer platforms, and the difficult solution due to space restrictions causes inevitable congestion during rush hours In order to provide six-car trains to handle the traffic after German reunification in 1990, the Berlin Senate allocated 250 million DM to extend the platforms of the northern stations Schwartzkopffstra√üe and Reinickendorfer Stra√üe, and the southern stations Kochstra√üe, Stadtmitte, Franz√∂sische Stra√üe, Friedrichstra√üe, Oranienburger Tor, and Zinnowitzer Stra√üe (today Naturkundemuseum), The modifications took four years - from July 1992 to September 1996 ‚Äì without service interruption in various stations: *Oranienburger Tor - modified from July 27, 1992 to April 1994 *Friedrichstra√üe - modified from September 1992 to June 1995 *Reinickendorfer Stra√üe - modified from July 1993 to October 1995 *Kochstra√üe - modified from October 1993 to January 1996 *Stadtmitte and Franzoische Stra√üe - modified from 1994 to 29 September 1996 *Zinnowitzer Stra√üe and Schwartzkopffstra√üe - modified from 1995 to 29 September 1996  Plans for the future  The extension of the U5 line from Alexanderplatz to Brandenburger Tor to will include a station Unter den Linden at Friedrichstra√üe, offering an opportunity to transfer to the U6 line. This construction work required a discontinuation of service between the Friedrichstra√üe and Franz√∂sische Stra√üe stations between July 2012 and October 2013, and abandonment of the Franz√∂sische Stra√üe station when the U5 extension is opened in 2019. In the old 200 km plans it was known that U6 will be extended to Hennigsdorf, Lichterfelde-Sud and Teltow Stadt. The southern U6 extension goes from Alt- Mariendorf, Trabrennbahn Mariendorf, Tauernallee, Marienfelde S√ºd, Goethestra√üe, Barnetstra√üe and towards Alt-Lichtenrade.  Frequency  Trains were running at 4-min intervals during peak periods and 5-min intervals during off-peak periods. Night service was introduced in 2003 and it is running at 15-minute frequency.

It runs completely underground for a length of through 40 stations and connects Spandau, via Neuk√∂lln, to Gropiusstadt and Rudow. The line was originally the south-eastern branch of the Nord-S√ºd-Bahn (U6) that ran between the branching point at Belle-Alliance- Stra√üe (Mehringdamm) and Grenzallee; however, in the 1960s, this stretch was separated from the rest of the line and extended at each end to form a new line. As of 2007, the U7 is Berlin's longest underground line, both in terms of absolute length and total travel time, and one of the longest subterranean lines in Europe. Route Starting in Rudow, at the junction of Gross- Ziethener Chaussee and Neuk√∂llner Stra√üe, the U7 runs northwest below the road Alt-Rudow, before bearing west in the Gropiusstadt area. Because the settlement and underground construction there were planned simultaneously, the U7 follows no roads until it reaches Britz-S√ºd station, where it runs under Fritz-Reuter-Allee as far as Blaschkoallee station before joining the route of Buschkrugallee. It continues north, crossing the urban motorway and the Ringbahn while under Karl-Marx-Stra√üe, then heads north-west under Hasenheide, S√ºdstern, and Gneisenaustra√üe until it reaches Mehringdamm after a very sharp right curve. A tight left curve brings the U7 under the () to M√∂ckernbr√ºcke station, with another taking it back and below the area of the former (). The route continues west under Yorckstra√üe, Willmanndamm, Grunewaldstra√üe, Bayerischer Platz, and Berliner Stra√üe, then heads north under Brandenburgische Stra√üe to Adenauerplatz station. A curve into Wilmersdorfer Stra√üe takes the U7 north to Bismarckstra√üe station, where it makes a further turn into Richard-Wagner-Stra√üe, travelling under this road and its northern continuations Wintersteinstra√üe and S√∂mmeringstra√üe. At Jungfernheide station, the U7 crosses the Ringbahn for the second time before passing under the Westhafenkanal. The track then turns west through a wide arc and follows Siemensdamm and Nonnendammallee. It passes to the south of the Spandau Citadel below the road Am Juliusturm, runs under the Old Town of Spandau, and ends at Rathaus Spandau station. The U7 passes through 12 districts of Berlin: Rudow, Gropiusstadt, Britz, Neuk√∂lln, Kreuzberg, Sch√∂neberg, Wilmersdorf, Charlottenburg, Charlottenburg-Nord, Siemensstadt, Haselhorst, and Spandau. History = Construction of the North-South Underground: 1901-1930 = Map of the former Nord-S√ºd Bahn in 1930 Around 1901, the city of Berlin planned to build an underground railway line below Friedrichstra√üe to connect the north to the south. Werner von Siemens also had plans for a north‚Äìsouth line, under Nobelstra√üe, at the same time, but permission for these was declined on the grounds that public transport should be in municipal ownership. Consequently, Berlin started the construction of the Nord‚ÄìS√ºd-Bahn (North‚ÄìSouth railway) to link Wedding and Tempelhof (as of 2007, part of the U6), with a branch to Neuk√∂lln. World War I made the construction work difficult, and finally stopped it completely. In 1919, work started again, but not without further complications. In 1921, during the time of hyperinflation, filling up the existing tunnels was considered as financial turmoil hit hard. The construction work was continued, however, and the first tunnel section from Hallesches Tor to Stettiner Bahnhof (later renamed Naturkundemuseum) was opened on 30 January 1923. The history of the U7 began with the construction of the branch to Neuk√∂lln, when the stretch from Hallesches Tor to Gneisenaustra√üe was built; it opened on 9 April 1924. With inflation still taking its toll, the construction work proceeded in small steps only. The extension to Hasenheide station, named after a nearby park (and later renamed S√ºdstern), followed on 14 December of the same year. As the financial situation of Germany and Berlin improved, so too did the underground railway construction, including the branch to Neuk√∂lln. At Hermannplatz station, which resembles something of an U-Bahn cathedral, the first underground rail‚Äìrail crossing in Berlin was developed; transfer to the GN-Bahn (later the U8) was intended at this station. The station is also the first Berlin underground station to use escalators. The section from Hasenheide to Bergstra√üe (later Karl-Marx-Stra√üe) was put into operation on 11 April 1926. The final stage of the Neuk√∂lln branch at that time, the 1.5 kilometre-long (0.9 mi) extension to Grenzallee, was put into operation on 21 December 1930‚Äîthe same day of the opening of what would become the U5 line‚Äîduring one of the largest underground opening celebrations. Underground passengers could then travel from Seestra√üe (U6), through the city centre, to either Tempelhof or Grenzallee. The post-war underground lines were marked out from their 1901‚Äì1914 predecessors by their larger tunnels and trains, in order to provide greater competition with the privately run (). The new trains and tunnels, which were wider but used the same standard-gauge track, were described as (). =Connection to Rudow= Rudow terminus station platform. Following World War II‚Äîin which many of Berlin's residences were destroyed‚Äîlarge new housing developments were needed. Britz and Britz-Buckow-Rudow (BBR; later renamed Gropiusstadt), which were established in the south of West Berlin, required a new rapid-transit railway connection to the West Berlin city centre; the construction work for the underground railway began on 2 November 1959. The track from Grenzallee to Britz-S√ºd opened on 28 September 1963. Construction began from Britz-S√ºd to Rudow on 2 January 1965. Travel to Zwickauer Damm was made possible on 2 January 1970, and Rudow received connection to Line 7 on 1 July 1972. =Extension to the west= The branch station Belle-Alliance-Stra√üe (later renamed Mehringdamm), which opened in 1924, had three tracks: a connection to Tempelhof led from the first platform; to Neuk√∂lln from the second; and to the city centre from the third. A separation of the Neuk√∂llner branch from the North-South Line was decided upon in order to avoid an overload on the transfer station Hallesches Tor. Therefore, Line 7 was extended west from Belle-Alliance-Stra√üe. The construction work began in the middle of 1962, and was completed on 26 February 1966 with the link to M√∂ckernbr√ºcke station. Beside the construction of M√∂ckernbr√ºcke station, changes to Mehringdamm station‚Äîwhich would become a transfer point between unbranched lines‚Äîwere necessary. The further extension of Line 7 was accomplished with subsidy funds. The construction of the track from M√∂ckernbr√ºcke to Fehrbelliner Platz started on 1 July 1962, and finished on 29 January 1971. Altstadt Spandau: Last station before the terminus Rathaus Spandau =In three stages to Spandau: 1960-1984= At the end of the 1960s, ideas about an underground railway line to Spandau arose again. The planned extension to Line 7 through Mierendorffplatz, Jungfernheide, and Nonnendammallee was chosen to improve public transportation to Siemensstadt‚Äîimportant for its many jobs. Already at the time, there were plans to build a subway to Spandau. First steps were taken with the extension of the line of today's line U2 to Ruhleben. The terminus Ruhleben is located directly on the district border to Spandau. Feeder and distribution traffic, until 1967 by tram, replaced by several bus lines, provided solely for the development of Spandau on the subway station Ruhleben. The construction work for the section Fehrbelliner Platz‚ÄìRichard- Wagner-Platz began in 1969 which is H-West-II. By 1970, the then shortest and less frequented subway line of Berlin, line 5, oscillated between Deutsche Oper and Richard Wagner Platz. Their old route was shut down for passenger traffic, and a new station was built several meters below the old one. The remaining tunnels could be converted into an operating section, making it the second exchange line between small and large profile after the Waisentunnel at Alexanderplatz station. The route continues under the Brandenburgische Stra√üe and crosses the Kurf√ºrstendamm at Adenauerplatz, where a train station was also built. The station was created as a crossing station as it was (and officially still is) planned to extend the current U-Bahn line U1 from Uhlandstra√üe to Adenauerplatz. After Adenauerplatz, the track swings under Wilmersdorfer Stra√üe and passes under the Stadtbahn. Wilmersdorfer Stra√üe was constructed with a pedestrian passage to the Charlottenburg S-Bahn station. At Bismarckstra√üe, a new underground railway station had to be built, since the pre-existing tunnel of Line 1 (later renamed U2) was in a bad condition and necessitated extensive repair works. After Bismarckstra√üe, 23 houses had to be underpinned, therefore the shield drive was used for tunnelling this section. The stage from Fehrbelliner Platz to Richard-Wagner-Platz was put into operation on 28 April 1978. Earthworks and some motorway construction began at Charlottenburg-Nord on 3 July 1967, which is located at Siemensstadt. Construction began for the section to Rohrdamm from 1973. The construction work for the next section towards Spandau began in 1973. The route leads north of the station Richard-Wagner-Platz further under the S√∂mmeringstra√üe. Halfway to Mierendorffplatz, the Spree is underpassed using the caisson construction method. After a few meters, the station follows Mierendorffplatz. North of the station, the route makes a wide berth to reach the existing S-Bahn station Jungfernheide. Here, similar to the station Schlo√üstra√üe, the platforms were built on two levels. The other tracks are kept until today for a possible extension of the U5, which is to lead from Lehrter to Tegel Airport via Turmstra√üe and Jungfernheide. However, the plan was cancelled due to the budget situation, the longer length of the extension north of Jungfernheide station due to the planned closure of Tegel Airport. Trams will be replacing the U-Bahn extension. The finished extension is now used for firefighting exercises and is no longer usable for any future line. The extension to Rohrdamm followed on 1 October 1980, providing the district of Spandau with its first underground connection. The costs of the extension to the Spandau city centre rose to unexpected heights: it consumed 680 million German marks as a result of the need to undercut the Havel river and the swampy ground in the surrounding area. Construction began on 4 July 1977. Several variants were investigated. One plan was to lead the subway through the Haselhorster village center, with a downside that the Havel had to be undercut at one of its widest points. Another variant was that the subway would cross the existing Spandau suburban railway of the S-Bahn and the subway would be led from the south to Spandau city hall. This plan crystallized very late, as the 200-kilometer plan envisaged to lead the U7 over Falkenseer Platz into Falkenhagener Feld. This resulted in the disadvantage that the Spandau old town could not be connected, which was the main goal of the extension. Finally, they decided to continue the route along the Nonnendammallee or the street Am Juliusturm, south past the Spandau Citadel and then directly to the old town and on to the Spandau town hall, with the development of Falkenhagener Feld taken over by the extension of the small profile route of the line U2 of Ruhleben. On 1 October 1984, the last section of the U7 from Rohrdamm to Rathaus Spandau was opened, with the then Federal Chancellor of Germany, Helmut Kohl, in attendance. Future plans In 2014, the Berlin city government published the Berlin U-Bahn 2014 Plan, according to which the long-postponed northern extension of the U7 to Staaken is expected to begin construction in 2021 and be completed in 2025. A southern extension from Rudow to Berlin Brandenburg Airport via Neuhofer Stra√üe, Lieselotte-Berger-Stra√üe, and Sch√∂nefeld has already been shelved as the expected patronage was not high enough to justify such an expansion. However, in light of the ballot measure aimed at keeping Tegel Airport open after the opening of the new Brandenburg Airport, governing mayor Michael M√ºller suggested an extension of U7 towards Sch√∂nefeld and/or the new airport which was greeted with enthusiasm by local politicians in Sch√∂nefeld and the Berlin district of Neuk√∂lln. Line colour and name In 1966, the branched C line had a violet map colour. After it was separated from the rest of the line and line names were changed from letters to numbers, this route was called (), and was represented by a grey line. After 1978, however, it was changed to a bright blue, because it is more easily discerned on the map. Since 1984, when all the underground lines received a \\"U\\" prefix, it has been called \\"U7\\". Station signages use the Helvetica font which is widely used in subway systems globally. In popular culture In March 2009, TML-Studios released 'World of Subways Vol. 2: U7 - Berlin' for Windows, which gives players the opportunity to operate a train on the U7 Line in either F90 or H01 rolling stock.

The U8 is one of two north-south Berlin U-Bahn lines, and runs from Wittenau to Neuk√∂lln via Gesundbrunnen. The original proposal was for a suspended monorail like the Wuppertal Schwebebahn.  Colouring and naming  left The U8 line has had dark blue as its distinguishing colour since it first opened in 1927. It initially ran between Gesundbrunnen and Neuk√∂lln and was therefore known as the GN-Bahn. Until 1966 it was designated the D line; when the U-Bahn then changed to a numeric designation system, it was renamed Line 8. In 1984, the letter U was added as part of efforts to better distinguish the S-Bahn from the U-Bahn.  History  = Gesundbrunnen to Neuk√∂lln: the GN-Bahn = Leinestra√üe station on the U8 line In 1902, a Nuremberg company, the Continentale Gesellschaft f√ºr elektrische Unternehmungen, approached Berlin's executive council, the Magistrat, about building a monorail like the one that had already been built in Elberfeld-Barmen (now part of Wuppertal). Their preferred route ran from Gesundbrunnen to Rixdorf (later renamed Neuk√∂lln). However, the Magistrat and city council were sceptical about the project, above all fearing accidents. In 1907, AEG made a competing proposal for almost the same route, in the form of an underground line within the city and an elevated railway in the suburban districts. After lengthy negotiations, in March 1912 the City of Berlin and AEG finally agreed upon a contract for the construction and operation of the line. Agreement was ultimately reached under considerable time pressure, because planning authority in matters of transport was to pass in April 1912 to the Greater Berlin Association and their position on this project was undetermined. The line was to begin as elevated track on Schwedenstra√üe and then continue to Humboldthain via Badstra√üe. From there it would run underground to Hermannplatz via Brunnenstra√üe, Rosenthaler Stra√üe, Weinmeisterstra√üe, M√ºnzstra√üe, Kaiser-Wilhelm-Stra√üe, Neue Friedrichstra√üe, Br√ºckenstra√üe, Neanderstra√üe, Dresdener Stra√üe, Luisenufer, Reichenberger Stra√üe, Kottbusser Stra√üe and Kottbusser Damm. AEG intended to build the line for the wider of the two train formats, known as Gro√üprofil (large profile), like the first north-south line. Construction began in 1912. Like Siemens, AEG had formed a subsidiary elevated railway company, AEG-Schnellbahn-AG. However, in the short period before and during the First World War, only a few tunnel sections were completed, among them the tunnel under the River Spree, between the Waisenbr√ºcke and the Jannowitzbr√ºcke. Finally, AEG's financial situation became so difficult that they ceased all construction work in October 1919. Thereupon the City of Berlin brought a successful legal action against AEG, as a result of which AEG-Schnellbahn-AG was liquidated. The city then received all the tunnel sections which had been built and planned to complete the line itself, but was at the time still in the process of constructing the first north-south U-Bahn. At that time plans were considered for eventually extending the line, some of them adventurous, for example a connection to the Heidekrautbahn railway to the north and another to the Neuk√∂lln-Mittenwald Railway to the south, so that theoretically a mass transit line would have been created extending from Gro√ü Sch√∂nebeck in Schorfheide through Berlin to Mittenwalde. Work did not resume on the GN-Bahn until 1926. The change of oversight had advantages for Berlin, because it made it possible to correct some sections of the route, for example, the northern elevated section, which was entirely eliminated, and the location of the tunnel at the Alexanderplatz. The first work was on the southern portion of the GN-Bahn, so that service began on 17 July 1927 between Boddinstra√üe and Sch√∂nleinstra√üe. Between these stations was the Hermannplatz station, which had been built as part of the simultaneous construction of the first north-south U-Bahn, finished 4 years earlier; here passengers were now for the first time able to transfer from one \\"large profile\\" (wide-body) line to another. A switching track was built between the two. Construction then progressed north. At the Kottbusser Tor station, the existing elevated station was relocated to make changing trains easier. Operation of the trunk line continued on wooden trestles. It now seemed natural to continue the line via Dresdener Stra√üe and the Oranienplatz to Neanderstra√üe (now Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe) - perhaps too natural: the stretch to Kottbusser Tor would have been very short. In addition, noting the Karstadt store at Hermannplatz, the Wertheim department store had realised the advantages of a connection to the U-Bahn and reputedly paid 5 million Reichsmarks for a change in the plans. The GN-Bahn would now be diverted to Moritzplatz and then round a sharp curve to Neanderstra√üe. So Wertheim in Moritzplatz also acquired an entrance from the U-Bahn. The shell of a station at Oranienplatz, which had already been constructed by AEG, remains unused to the present day.Oranienplatz on Florian Schulz' Berlins blinde Verkehrsbauten site, retrieved 18 October 2010 After Moritzplatz, the route follows the Neanderstra√üe and provisionally terminated at the station of that name (renamed Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe in 1960). The segment between Sch√∂nleinstra√üe and Neanderstra√üe was opened on 12 February 1928 as far as Kottbusser Tor and on 6 April of the same year to Neanderstra√üe. A year later, an additional station opened south of Boddinstra√üe, Leinestra√üe (in August 1929). Beyond the Neanderstra√üe station was the previously constructed tunnel under the Spree. However, since this needed to be altered and the Jannowitzbr√ºcke was in bad condition, a completely new bridge was constructed with a new U-Bahn crossing beneath it. The old tunnel was later put to use for a service connection between the U5 and U8 (sometimes called the \\"orphan tunnel\\"). Alexanderplatz station: an early underground shopping arcade The U-Bahn construction at Alexanderplatz took a long time, because the opportunity was taken to completely re-design the square. Some adjustments were also made to the line of the route, and the GN-Bahn thus appreciably better integrated into the remainder of the public transport system. At Alexanderplatz, a large transfer terminal was created for the U-Bahn, S-Bahn, trams and buses. At that time also, the so-called \\"mother of all underground shopping concourses\\" was created. Today, in contrast, it seems rather small in comparison to, for example, the arcade at the Hauptwache station in Frankfurt. Alexanderplatz station now has the form of an 'H'. The eastern leg of the 'H' is the U-Bahn station already opened in 1913 for what is today the U2. The western leg is the GN-Bahn station (today the U8). The crosspiece is the U-Bahn under the Frankfurter Allee, then under construction. Two platforms were built, used by what is today the U5 and projected to be used by a planned line from Potsdamer Platz to Weissensee. There were no further major problems; for the most part, AEG tunnels already existed. The section from Neanderstra√üe to Gesundbrunnen opened on 18 April 1930. As with the other wide-format line, operation was transferred to the elevated railway company. = Dividing Berlin into two: 1961-1990 = After the construction of the Berlin Wall in 1961, on the orders of German Democratic Republic interior minister Karl Maron all U8 stations inside East Berlin were closed to passenger traffic. This order turned all remaining closed stations into so-called \\"ghost stations\\", through which trains were required to pass without stopping and which could only be entered by East German border and traffic policemen. These stations were closed: Bernauer Stra√üe, Rosenthaler Platz, Weinmeisterstra√üe, Alexanderplatz, Jannowitzbr√ºcke and Heinrich-Heine-Stra√üe from 13 August 1961 till the fall of the Berlin Wall. To serve the area formerly connected by U8 for the East Berlin, a bus line 78 was introduced from Arkonaplatz to M√§rkisches Museum. After the building of the Berlin Wall in 1961, the U8 line was not in great shape. It began with 6 stations in West Berlin, followed by an equally long section underneath East Berlin ('ghost stations') and ended at Gesundbrunnen after 2 more stations in the western sector. As a result, the line was of little use for public transport, and was also potentially open to disruption by the GDR. In 1962, plans were known for a new residential district in West Berlin, the M√§rkisches Viertel. Like Gropiusstadt, this ought naturally to have U-Bahn service. The S-Bahn to Frohnau, which passed nearby, was ignored; West Berliners boycotted it because it was operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn, an arm of the GDR government,T.H. Elkins with B. Hofmeister, Berlin: The Spatial Structure of a Divided City, London: Methuen, 1988, , e-edition Taylor & Francis 2005, , p. 106. plus the East Germans did not have money to spend building a new station.Elkins, p. 173. After extensive deliberation, it was decided to extend the U8. When Line 9 was extended to Osloer Stra√üe, a lower-level platform for the U8 was constructed at the same time. Work on that extension began in 1973, and the extension was opened on 5 October 1977. Pankstra√üe's other purpose as an emergency shelter is hardly discernible Beyond the Gesundbrunnen station, the line continues under Badstra√üe. At the junction with Pankstra√üe a station with the same name was constructed. The Pankstra√üe U-Bahn station was constructed to be usable as a shelter (e.g. in case of war). To this end Pankstra√üe has sanitary facilities, an emergency kitchen, a filtered ventilation system, et c. In an emergency it can shelter 3,339 people. The additional costs for these facilities were paid by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The walls are tiled in brown and the columns clad in aluminium sheeting. One curiosity remains at Pankstra√üe station: the silver letters affixed to the walls spell the name as \\"Pankstrasse\\", transliterating the eszett and ignoring the correct German spelling (\\"Pankstra√üe\\"). The line continues along Schwedenstra√üe to the previously prepared Osloer Stra√üe station. A service track was added here so that trains can also be transferred from the U8 to the U9. Residenzstra√üe station are intended to recall carpets in the now destroyed Stadtschlo√ü Not until 10 years later, on 27 April 1987, was it possible to open the next section of the line, to Paracelsus-Bad (construction had begun on 12 September 1980). The extensions on the other lines had proceeded significantly faster; here work lasted an unusually long time. After Osloer Stra√üe station, the line continues along Schwedenstra√üe, which changes its name to Residenzstra√üe shortly before it intersects Reginardstra√üe. A station was built near the Sch√§fersee lake. There were many disputes over what to name it; the name finally agreed upon is Franz-Neumann-Platz (Am Sch√§fersee) (Franz-Neumann- Platz (at the Sch√§fersee). Like the following stations on the line, this station bears the unmistakable stamp of station architect Rainer R√ºmmler. On its walls are trees, intended to symbolise the parkland surrounding the lake. To better integrate the line into the district of Reinickendorf, it then detours slightly, not continuing beneath the industrial area to the Wilhelmsruh S-Bahn station, but instead taking a route via the Karl Bonhoeffer Neuropsychiatric Clinic and the Reinickendorf town hall. It then continues under Residenzstra√üe, where again a station of that name was built, makes a wide curve under the junction of Residenzstra√üe and Lindauer Allee, and a few hundred metres later comes to the Paracelsus-Bad station. Paracelsus-Bad station is intended to be reminiscent of a swimming pool The Residenzstra√üe station, intended to be reminiscent of the Berlin Imperial palace, is decorated with plans of the now destroyed Stadtschlo√ü. The supporting pillars are decorated in very bright colours and probably intended to evoke the rich carpets of the residence. Paracelsus-Bad station was designed to evoke associations with the nearby swimming baths. In addition there are pictures on the wall, one of which shows the doctor and philosopher Paracelsus (Theophrastus Bombastus von Hohenheim). This new section of the line was actually intended to be inaugurated on the precise 750th anniversary of the city of Berlin, 30 April 1987. However, since the festivities that day were to begin with a celebration at the ICC, the then Executive Mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, would not be able to attend and hence the opening was brought forward by 3 days. Once more, a long time passed before the next extension of the line towards M√§rkisches Viertel. It was 1994 before it was possible to take the U8 to the Wittenau S-Bahn station. = Completion of the U8 = Wittenau station, provisional and probably eventual terminus of the line The residents of M√§rkisches Viertel had been promised a U-Bahn connection ever since the late 1960s. After examination of several options, the decision was to extend the U8. By 1987, two stages in this extension had been completed: Gesundbrunnen ‚Äì Osloer Stra√üe and Osloer Stra√üe ‚Äì Paracelsus-Bad. The third stage still remained to be built. After the BVG took over operation of the S-Bahn in West Berlin and the Frohnau section of line was reopened on 1 October 1984, there was increasing criticism of the U8 extension, which would run almost parallel to the S-Bahn. However, the Senate of West Berlin was not to be dissuaded and resumed construction on the U-Bahn. Even a directive from the government of the Federal Republic in Bonn to instead invest in badly needed renovations of the S-Bahn, coupled with a warning that subsidies to Berlin would be reduced, was dismissed with the argument that cessation of the U-Bahn construction would cause severe economic harm to the city. Construction began on 27 February 1985, while the preceding segment of the U8 was also still under construction. The intended terminus of the third stage of the line extension was Wilhelmsruher Damm, near the Wittenau S-Bahn station. This was apparently to distinguish the U-Bahn from the S-Bahn. Only shortly before dedication of the new segment did the Senate correct the name of the station, which has since been called Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm), but is commonly known simply as Wittenau. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, three stations were opened simultaneously - Bernauer Stra√üe, Rosenthaler Platz and Jannowitzbr√ºcke. Station restoration was started after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and all the former ‚Äúghost stations‚Äù had been opened by 1 July 1990. After Paracelsus-Bad, the line continues under Lindauer Allee to Lindauer Allee station, the only one on the U8 to have outside platforms. After a long curve, the U8 is running under the S-Bahn. The location of the next station requires a long walk to transfer between the two. There was also disagreement concerning the name of this station: the S-Bahn station at this point was called Wittenau (Kremmener Bahn), to distinguish it from Wittenau (Nordbahn) (which is now Wittenau (Wilhelmsruher Damm) to match the U-Bahn station). The U-Bahn station was to be called Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik after the psychiatric clinic. This was a mouthful that was only slowly accepted. On the S-Bahn, to this day \\"Karl- Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik\\" is announced but the shorter \\"Karl-Bonhoeffer-Klinik\\" appears on signs. The subway line then continues under the clinic. To minimise disturbance, this stretch of tunnel was excavated using a shield, and rubber sound baffling was also needed. This attracted repeated criticism from those who would have preferred open tunnelling with shoring up of buildings. Other problems also arose during construction of this stretch of line: the Brandenburg sand made work particularly difficult and numerous oversized boulders (glacial erratics) caused delays. After Karl-Bonhoeffer-Nervenklinik the U8 turns onto Eichborndamm, where the Rathaus Reinickendorf station was built. 1,101 m further, it reaches its current and probably ultimate terminus, Wittenau. The intention still remains today to extend this line to M√§rkisches Viertel. However, as with other U-Bahn construction projects, the extreme budgetary crisis in the state of Berlin is preventing further construction. The completed extension, which is long and comprises 4 new stations, was opened on 24 September 1994. Construction cost 600 million DM. As with other newly built sections of the U-Bahn in this period, Rainer R√ºmmler was responsible for the design of the stations. Critics say that this section would represent his peak, but that R√ºmmler had a tendency to excess. This is particularly evident in the Lindauer Allee station, where he primarily made use of the symbol on the coat of arms of the city of Lindau, the linden tree. At the Wittenau U-Bahn station, the colours green and yellow were supposed to radiate a certain peace, which he associated with the intended station name Wilhelmsruher Damm. Hermannstra√üe station, planned since 1910 Plans for a U-Bahn to the Hermannstra√üe S-Bahn station had existed since 1910. When the so-called GN-Bahn was opening in stages between 1927 and 1930, plans to extend it were not abandoned. The first work on a southwards extension began in 1929; but the economic crisis prevented its continuation. Ultimately, the City of Berlin cancelled the project in 1931. At that point, the tunnel from the Leinestra√üe station and approximately one third of the future platform for the Hermannstra√üe station had been completed. In 1940 the station, still only a shell, was converted into an air-raid shelter, since it was located very deep underground because the line crossed under the Ringbahn, which at this point runs in a cutting. To this day, relics in the station recall that time. After 1961, the extension plans were no longer pursued, since there was no demand for transfer capability to the S-Bahn, operated by the GDR's Reichsbahn. BVG used the stubs of tunnel which had already been built to park surplus trains. After reunification in 1990, many things seemed possible. The S-Bahn Ringbahn, shut down by the Reichsbahn after a 1980 strike, was to be re-opened. The re- opening was scheduled for 17 December 1993, which meant that the Senate and BVG had to work very fast, because construction had to begin on the U-Bahn before the Ringbahn re-opened. During work on the station, the trains which had been parked there in the 1960s were discovered. Many U-Bahn fans were delighted that one of the discoveries was an antique BI train. The work included renovation of the old tunnel and existing platform section as well as construction of the remainder of the platform and a 320-meter turnaround beyond it to the south. In addition, transfer access to the S-Bahn platform above and possible stairways to a planned regional station had to be accommodated. Hermanstra√üe station dating to its conversion into an air-raid shelter in 1940 Finally, on 13 July 1996, the 168th Berlin U-Bahn station opened. Here too, Rainer R√ºmmler was responsible for the design of the station, incidentally for the last time. He referred very strongly to the stations on the preceding stretch of line and designed a very sparse station lined with turquoise tiles. So that the historic shelter signs would remain visible, glass was substituted for the tiles in some places. With the commissioning of this station, the U8 reached what is up to now its final form. Even though an extension to M√§rkisches Viertel is planned, it is unlikely that it will become a reality for decades. The previously planned extension towards Britz was cancelled because the U7 follows a parallel route. Frequency U8 trains run every five minutes, with the exception of the stretch between Paracelsus-Bad and Wittenau, where they run every ten minutes. Since 2003, the U8 also runs at night on the weekends. During weekdays, the N8 bus replaces the train service during night hours.

The line was opened on 28 August 1961 as Line G. Route The path of the U9 is completely under-surface. It starts in the north at Osloer Stra√üe in Gesundbrunnen and runs through Wedding before underpassing the Berlin Ringbahn and running through Moabit, reaching Hansaplatz and Tiergarten before crossing the Berlin Stadtbahn at the Zoo and Kurf√ºrstendamm, eventually leaving western central Berlin by heading to Friedenau and finally Steglitz at Rathaus Steglitz. History =First stage of construction= After the division of Berlin in 1948, the citizens of West Berlin preferred buses and trams that bypassed East Berlin. Furthermore, the highly populated boroughs of Steglitz, Wedding and Reinickendorf were in need of a rapid transit relation to the new center of West Berlin south of the Zoo. This prompted the construction of a completely new line, then called line G, becoming the third north-south line after line C (modern U6) and line D (modern U8). Ground-breaking was on 23 June 1955 at Tiergarten. Path construction was difficult as it was to underpass four U-Bahn lines (U1, U2, U3, U6), two S-Bahn lines (Stadtbahn, Ringbahn twice) and three waterways (Spree River, Landwehr Canal, Berlin-Spandau Canal). Line G from Leopoldplatz to Spichernstra√üe was supposed to be opened 2 September 1961. This was backdated to 28 August 1961 after the construction of the Berlin Wall proved the necessity of this new line. To accommodate the U9, the N√ºrnberger Platz station was closed. It was replaced by Spichernstra√üe (opened 2 June 1959) and Augsburger Stra√üe (opened 8 May 1961) stations respectively. The new stations do include: *Leopoldplatz (today: U6) *Amrumer Stra√üe *Putlitzstra√üe (today: Westhafen; S-Bahn /Ringbahn) *Birkenstra√üe *Turmstra√üe *Hansaplatz *Zoologischer Garten (heute: U2; S-Bahn /Stadtbahn) *Kurf√ºrstendamm (today: U1) *Spichernstra√üe (today: U3) It will also interchange with the smaller profile station, but it was opened at the same day when U9 is opened: *Kurf√ºrstendamm =Second stage= Since the subsidies from the Federal Republic still went to West Berlin, was further built on the busy subway. On 29 January 1971, the longest subway extensions was implemented. The U7 takes the lead of the M√∂ckernbr√ºcke to Fehrbelliner Platz, Line 9 of the Spichernstra√üe to Walther-Schreiber-Platz. Nine kilometers of track with eleven new stations went into operation on that day. Groundbreaking began 1 July 1962. For the Steglitz and Neuk√∂lln a fast connection to the western center and no longer had the buses in claim take. The route follows the U9 from the previous terminus Spichernstra√üe the Bundesallee and crosses line U7 on Berliner Stra√üe. The lower platform is a central platform, the U9 has here. This however is not in the usual sense: On one side of the platform, climb‚Äîat the station Berliner Stra√üe usually on the right side, but on the left side‚Äîseen in the direction of travel. It could also be seen as apart Laid central platforms the platforms thus. Only one transition at the north end of both platforms interconnects. This construction project was necessary because the subway construction, a road tunnel between the two side platforms was built. Similar to the Berliner Stra√üe railway station also encloses the then- newly-built Bundesplatz a road tunnel, which is why no central platform was also built here. The tracks split up shortly before the station to bypass the tunnel and there were two side platforms. All stations were built designed by Rainer G. R√ºmmler. Here, instead of the current ceramic tiles, large-format colorful fiber cement plates are used, such as the station Walther-Schreiber- Platz. Even should associations by the color scheme is always new are awakened. From Bahnhof Berliner Stra√üe, the colors are white and red on the Coat of arms of Berlin remember, at the station Eisenacher Stra√üe U7 the green faces on the Thuringian Forest at Eisenach. Another reason why the architect is very controversial. =Final extension= Between Walther-Schreiber-Platz station and the Schlo√üstra√üe the U9 changes to the tunnel section of U10. In Schlo√üstra√üe station itself, the tracks are heading north on the top, in the direction of Rathaus Steglitz on the lower level, however, the offices on the eastern edge of the platform on which was supposed to take the U10. The western edge of the platform each is separated by a fence from the passenger traffic. In track trough unused tracks are laid without power rail. To date, there hangs the sign \\"No trains\\". By this enormous constructed provisions, the cost of one meter underground route exorbitantly to 78,000 Mark (adjusted for purchasing power in today's money). Behind the Schlo√üstra√üe ends the U9 at the Rathaus Steglitz. The paths of U9 and U10 here separate again. Both lines should keep in Steglitz at separate stations, viewed from Schlo√üstra√üe from an end opening \\"V\\" would form. The intended actually for the U9 station Part (Rzo) is equipped with side platforms, located in the minus-1 level until now has been completed only in the shell and is cut off as a storeroom for the civil protection used. The original platform is operated for the U9 instead of planned for the U10 Station part (Rzu) in the minus-2 level. Background for this management is the intersection of planned U9-line and Wannseebahn immediately south of the station. In the 1970s, it has not been possible, Deutsche Reichsbahn in the negotiations on the railway line to the to come, the operation of the Steglitz station here an agreement. So as the sweeping system, the BVG considered behind the station for necessary not be created. In the west extending U10 there was not this problem, which is why the U9 has been carried out on the U10 route and provided with a reversing facility. When in January 1984 on the operation went right for the S-Bahn in West Berlin to the BVG, the chance to drive under the S-Bahn, without risking renewed problematic negotiations with the Reichsbahn offered. Since this condition was guaranteed from the perspective of 1984, only ten years (so long was the contract period), the mid-1980s the functionless tunnel was extended through under the railway embankment. A reversing facility or at least one part of it is not built into this piece‚Äîthis should be done only in a further section of the tunnel. The section to Rathaus Stegliz was definitely opened on 30 September 1974, its construction began on 7 July 1969. The addition is from Leopoldplatz to Osloer Stra√üe. It was opened on the 30 April 1976, construction began on 6 November 1969. Since this was not feasible but due to the political situation, they let the U9 only to cross Osloer Stra√üe/Swedener Stra√üe construct. They were provided for two new stations: Nauener Platz, Turmstra√üe, and Osloer Stra√üe. Until then, the U8 can be extended. This resulted in the situation that this tower station could be built without regard to existing underground services. It has also helped build a spacious, bright basement distribution, in which there are several shops and snack bars. Future Extensions In the old 200 km it was planned to be extended via Filandastra√üe, Halskestra√üe, Lankwitz and Lankwitz Kirche, and may be planned to be extended to Lichterfelde Ring via Gallwitzallee, Blankenhainer Stra√üe, Maximilian-Kaller-Stra√üe and Hildburghauser Stra√üe, directly planned to the Berlin external boundary area. The further northern extension was dropped after the fall of the Berlin Wall in favour of tram line M13. The route was suggested to go via Holzstra√üe, Wollankstra√üe and will be divided into two options - *Going to Pankow Kirche, it will be via Rathaus Pankow, Pankow Kirche, Hadlichestra√üe and towards Quartier am Pankower Tor *Going to Pankow, it will be via Florapromenade, Pankow, Neumannstra√üe and towards Quartier am Pankower Tor All of the extensions were abandoned as the patronage is not high enough to justify for these expansion.

It opened during the Victorian era, in 1885, replacing earlier stations situated a little further west. Since the closure of the former Rugby Central station on the now-abandoned Great Central Railway route through the town, it is Rugby's only station. Between 1950 and 1970 the station was known as Rugby Midland before reverting to its original title. The station underwent an extensive upgrade during 2006‚Äì2008, with extra platforms added, and a new ticket office and entrance building constructed, however the original Victorian part of the station was retained in the upgrade. Rugby station is at the centre of two important junctions of the West Coast Main Line (WCML) connecting London to Birmingham and North West England and Scotland. The junction of the Trent Valley Line to the North West, and the Rugby-Birmingham- Stafford Line to Birmingham is a short distance west of the station. East of the station, the Northampton Loop Line diverges at a junction from the direct line to London. Until the 1960s it also had routes to , and but these have all since been closed. The present station, managed by Avanti West Coast, is located roughly half a mile north of Rugby town centre. On the WCML as a whole, it is located north of London Euston, and south of .

However, as the WCML divides here on either side of the station, it provides an interchange between the routes and consequently many trains stop here. In the chainage notation traditionally used on the railway, the station is from Euston.Engineer's Line References RailwayCodes.org Hillmorton Junction To the southeast of the station, the original London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) line (opened 1838), which runs directly to London, is joined at a grade separated junction near Hillmorton by the Northampton loop line (opened 1881) which runs to Northampton before rejoining the line to London at Hanslope Junction. This junction is from Euston. Trent Valley Junction To the northwest of the station the WCML diverges again between the original London and Birmingham line, now referred to as the Birmingham Loop, which runs westwards to Coventry and Birmingham, and the Trent Valley Line (opened 1847) which diverges at a flyover junction northwestwards towards Stafford and the North West of England and Scotland. It is from Euston. =Closed Lines= Until the 1960s Rugby station served several other railway lines, which were closed mostly as part of the Beeching Axe. At one time railway lines diverged from Rugby station in seven different directions. The closed lines were: *The Midland Counties Railway (later Midland Railway) line to and the East Midlands which opened in 1840. In the mid-19th century this was an important main line, as the junction at Rugby provided the Midland Railway with its only link to London. Nearly all rail traffic between London and the north passed through Rugby, making it one of the most important railway junctions in the country. Increasing congestion at Rugby meant that Midland Railway opened its own route from Leicester to London in the late 1860s. The Leicester to Rugby line lost its earlier importance, and became little more than a country branch line, it continued to operate as such for nearly a century until it was closed on 30 December 1961. A remaining relic of this line locally is the disused viaduct across the Avon valley, which is a local landmark. *The Rugby and Stamford Railway which was a secondary cross-country line owned by the London and North Western Railway which ran from Rugby to Peterborough via . The line was opened on 29 April 1850. It originally ran to Stamford where it joined the Midland Railway's Syston and Peterborough Railway. But later on, in order to gain a more direct route, the LNWR gained permission to build a line from to the Northampton and Peterborough Railway near Wansford, part of which survives as the Nene Valley Railway. Traffic was never heavy, and Doctor Beeching viewed it as an unnecessary duplication of the Birmingham to Peterborough Line and it was closed on 6 June 1966. *The Rugby to Leamington Line which was a country branch line to Leamington Spa which was opened on 1 March 1851. Local passenger services were withdrawn in 1959, and the line closed as a through route in 1966. The Great Central Main Line (GCML) also ran through the town and had its own station at , but as this was built by a rival company, it never had any connection to the other railways in Rugby. It was opened in 1899 and closed between 1966 and 1969.  History  =First station (1838‚Äì40)= The first railway station to be built in Rugby was a wooden temporary structure located around half a mile to the west of the present station. It opened on 9 April 1838 when the London and Birmingham Railway was constructed. However great difficulty in constructing the Kilsby Tunnel in Northamptonshire delayed the full opening of the line, which was not finished in time for the coronation of Queen Victoria on 28 June 1838. Aware of the lucrative traffic the event would generate, the company opened the north end of the line, between Birmingham and Rugby, and the south end from London to a temporary station at near Bletchley, with a stagecoach shuttle service linking the two parts to allow through journeys to London. The line was officially fully opened on 17 September 1838, with the first passenger train from London to Birmingham arriving that day. The original station was located on the western side of where the railway crossed Newbold Road (the Rugby to Leicester turnpike road, now the A426) because at the time this was the only road north from Rugby. =Second station (1840‚Äì1885)= The first station lasted only a few years. When a junction was made with the Midland Counties Railway in 1840, a new station was built at the site of the junction, which opened on 4 July 1840; it was to the east of the original station, and to the west of the present station. A new road, Railway Terrace had to be built to link it to the town centre, because at the time it was located in open countryside. This second station was effectively managed by two companies ‚Äì the London and North Western Railway and the Midland Railway ‚Äì and for this reason grew up in a haphazard fashion. It was at first no more than a temporary wooden structure, but was gradually rebuilt into a more permanent structure over the following decade. This station consisted of platforms at each side of the track with one bay platform. The platforms were rather low and passengers complained of having to perform an \\"acrobatic feat\\" to board trains. The station was at the centre of a busy junction and often saw chaotic scenes. It featured, only lightly disguised, in Charles Dickens's story Mugby Junction. = The present station (1885‚Äì) = Rugby Station in 1917 The station in 1959 The second station lasted until the 1880s, when a new line from Rugby to Northampton (the Northampton loop) was built, the old station was deemed by the LNWR to be no- longer satisfactory, and in 1882, ¬£70,000 was allocated to replace it with the current station which opened on 5 July 1885. Another ¬£30,000 was allocated to build a hotel, although this was never built. The Midland Railway retained the part of the older station which it had managed, however. One platform of the old station, separate from the new station, continued to be used by local trains on the Midland Railway's branch to Leicester until 8 March 1930. No trace of this now remains, however, as it was demolished in the 1960s to make way for the postal sorting office. When constructed the station consisted of one large island platform with bay platforms at each end for terminating local services. The main island platforms are accessed from a tunnel at road level and a ramp leading to the platforms. When constructed the station had a large steel and glass trainshed roof which consisted of 117 ft (35.6 m) wide spans on each side, covering the station platforms and tracks. Originally the sides of the station had glass side screens but these were later removed. The condition of the roof deteriorated, and in the 1980s the glass over the tracks was removed, and finally the entire structure was dismantled in 2000 when it became unstable, and was replaced with modern canopies over the platforms.Rugby local history.org A electric multiple unit at one of the former northbound bay platforms at Rugby in 1975. The station had one of the longest platforms of any British railway station, at , but the two main island platforms were both shortened as part of the 2007‚Äì08 station upgrade. The platform was long enough to allow two trains to call at it at the same time. This unusual feature was enabled by 'scissors crossings' halfway along the platforms. The scissor crossings were X-shaped junctions which allowed one train to pass another one already in the platform, and call into the same platform ahead of it, and allowed the train to the rear to pull out of the station, effectively doubling the capacity of the platform. The scissor crossings remained in use until the railway was electrified in the 1960s. In 1899 a second station, , was opened in Rugby. To distinguish it from the other station, the present station became known as Rugby Midland. Rugby Central closed in 1969, and Rugby Midland reverted to being called just Rugby in 1970. The station came under the management of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) (1885‚Äì1923), and then the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) (1923‚Äì1948), and then the nationalised British Railways (1948‚Äì1997). It is now owned by Network Rail.  2006‚Äì2008 upgrade  As a part of the West Coast Main Line modernisation programme carried out by Network Rail, major track restructuring work was carried out to allow higher speed running through Rugby. Previously non-stopping trains passing through Rugby were limited to 75 mph, the track upgrades raised the speed to 125 mph, thus eliminating another bottleneck from the WCML. The station itself also underwent a major ¬£170 million upgrade which included:BBC Coventry and Warwickshire *The addition of three new through platforms, bringing the total up to five, including a new platform on the south side of the station and a second island platform on the north side. *The construction of a new entrance building and ticket office: Historically all of the station's facilities, including the ticket office were concentrated on the station's single island platform, which was accessed from street level by a subway. The main entrance to the station therefore consisted of a simple opening to the subway. The additional platforms required that the ticket office be moved to a new entrance building at the front of the station. It was at one time thought that remodelling of the track layout would entail complete demolition of the present station, but the final plans involved retention of the existing island platform and buildings. Work began in September 2006 and was completed late in 2008. The platform on the south side of the station opened for use on 29 May 2007, and as a result all of the platforms were renumbered. This platform became Platform 1, the former Platform 1 became Platform 2 and 2 became 4. The additional platforms on the north side of the station are numbered Platforms 5 and 6 and they opened on 27 August 2008. Platform 8 became Platform 3. At the same time the former westbound bay platforms originally numbered 3, 6 and 7 were removed. Another distinctive feature of the local railway landscape also vanished at this time ‚Äì the 'bird cage' bridge. This was a 'heavy' girder bridge of two substantial spans over the West Coast Main Line to the east ('up' side) of the station. This was the means by which the Great Central Main Line crossed the London & North Western Railway competing line.

Situated to the south of the station and erected in 1895, it spanned three tracks and carried forty-four semaphore arms. Every arm was duplicated due to sighting difficulties that resulted from the Great Central Railway's 'Birdcage' bridge crossing the WCML behind the gantry's location. The gantry acquired the nickname of \\"the Rugby Bedstead\\" on account of its appearance. The \\"Rugby Bedstead\\" signalling gantry in 1895, prior to the construction of the Great Central viaduct In 1939, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway resignalled the Rugby area with colour light signals, although the mechanical signal boxes were retained. The famous signal gantry became redundant, following which it was divided up into smaller pieces to form a number of smaller structures for re-use elsewhere. SGE was awarded a contract to resignal the Rugby area in preparation for electrification. Rugby Power Signal Box (PSB) opened in 1964. It is located east of the station, on the south (Down) side of the railway. The whole station area, together with part of the WCML stretching as far south as Castlethorpe, was controlled from this new box. It was equipped with an 'NX' (entrance-exit) panel. In 1991, Rugby PSB took over control of the Northampton area using Solid State Interlocking (SSI). Rugby PSB closed in May 2012 when control of Northampton was transferred to Rugby SCC. Rugby Signalling Control Centre (SCC), located north-west of the station, opened in 2004. Initially, its area of control was limited to a portion of the WCML between Kings Langley and Linslade Tunnel. The current area of control is Kings Langley, Hertfordshire to Armitage in Staffordshire. Area of control also includes small portions of branch lines around Nuneaton; these include the Coventry-Nuneaton (from Three Spires to Nuneaton) and part of the Arley/Hinckley lines (Arley Tunnel to Padge Hall). In March 2016, the WCML South Rail Operating Centre (ROC) was opened at Rugby ‚Äì this will supervise the signalling on the entire southern end of the WCML and associated branch routes.Network Rail ‚Äì Our Future Vision Network Rail Media Centre press release; Retrieved 2013-08-30 =Motive Power Depots= Inside the Repair Shops at Rugby Locomotive Depot in 1953 A shed for three locomotives was opened here in 1838 by the London and Birmingham Railway and another in 1847. These were demolished to make way for two larger sheds in 1852, one for the use of the Northern Division locomotives and one by the Southern Division. The LNWR replaced these with a single 12-road shed in 1876, which was closed in 1965, but used for stabling diesel shunters. An adjoining 12-road shed was opened in 1886, but was closed and demolished by British Railways in 1960.  Connections  Bus route 4, operated by Stagecoach Midlands, connects the railway station with Rugby town centre and the suburbs of Cawston and Bilton. Bus route D1 and D2, operated by Stagecoach Midlands, previously connected the railway station with Rugby town centre, now replaced on this section by services 1 and 2, which connects with buses D1 and D2 to the suburbs of Barby, Braunston, Brownsover, DIRFT, Hillmorton, and Kilsby. The service then continues onto serve the nearby town of Daventry.

Description and classification  Dried thistle flowers at the end of summer Members of this genus grow as annual or biennial plants. The erect stem is tall, branched and furrowed but not spiny. The large, alternate leaves are waxy-lobed, toothed and thorny, as in other genera of thistle. The lower leaves are sessile (attached to the stem without petiole). The upper leaves have a clasping base. They have large, disc-shaped pink-to-purple, rarely white, solitary flower heads at the end of the stem. The flowers consist of tubular florets. The phyllaries under the flowers occur in many rows, with the outer row with spine-tipped lobes and apical spines. The fruit is a black achene with a white pappus.Flora of North America, Vol. 19, 20 and 21 Page 164, Blessed milkthistle, Silybum marianum (Linnaeus) Gaertner, Fruct. Sem.

Milk thistle is believed to give some remedy for liver diseases (e.g. viral hepatitis) and the extract, silymarin, is used in medicine. Mild gastrointestinal distress is the most common adverse event reported for milk thistle. The incidence is the same as for placebo. A laxative effect for milk thistle has also been reported infrequently.  Claims of health benefits  Flowerhead of Silybum marianum For many centuries extracts of milk thistle have been recognized as \\"liver tonics.\\" Milk thistle has been reported to have protective effects on the liver and to greatly improve its function. It is typically used to treat liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation), toxin-induced liver damage including the prevention of severe liver damage from Amanita phalloides ('death cap' mushroom poisoning), and gallbladder disorders. Reviews of the literature covering clinical studies of silymarin vary in their conclusions. A review examining studies with a double-blind protocol concluded that milk thistle and its derivatives has no significant effect on mortality or course of disease in individuals with alcoholic and/or hepatitis B or C disease.

It was the last propeller-driven fighter to serve with the Royal Navy, and one of the fastest production single reciprocating engine aircraft ever built. Developed during the Second World War, the Sea Fury entered service two years after the war ended. It proved to be a popular aircraft with a number of overseas militaries, and was used during the Korean War in the early 1950s, as well as against the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion of Cuba. The Sea Fury's development was formally initiated in 1943 in response to a wartime requirement of the Royal Air Force (RAF), with the aircraft initially named Fury. As the Second World War drew to a close, the RAF cancelled their order for the aircraft; however, the Royal Navy saw the type as a suitable carrier aircraft to replace a range of increasingly obsolete or poorly-suited aircraft being operated by the Fleet Air Arm. Development of the Sea Fury proceeded, and the type began entering operational service in 1947. The Sea Fury has many design similarities to Hawker's preceding Tempest fighter, having originated from a requirement for a \\"Light Tempest Fighter\\"; both the Sea Fury's wings and fuselage originate from the Tempest but were significantly modified. Production Sea Furies were fitted with the powerful Bristol Centaurus engine, and armed with four wing-mounted Hispano V cannons. While originally developed as a pure aerial fighter aircraft, the definitive Sea Fury FB.11 was a fighter-bomber, the design having been found suitable for this mission as well. The Sea Fury attracted international orders as both a carrier and land-based aircraft. It was operated by countries including Australia, Burma, Canada, Cuba, Egypt, West Germany, Iraq, and Pakistan. The type acquitted itself well in the Korean War, fighting effectively even against the MiG-15 jet fighter.Wheeler 1992, p. 87. Although the Sea Fury was retired by the majority of its military operators in the late 1950s in favour of jet-propelled aircraft, a considerable number of aircraft saw subsequent use in the civil sector, and several remain airworthy in the 21st century as heritage and racing aircraft. Development =Origins= Sea Fury T.20 at 2014 Reno Air Races The Hawker Fury was an evolutionary successor to the successful Hawker Typhoon and Tempest fighters and fighter-bombers of the Second World War. The Fury's design process was initiated in September 1942 by Sydney Camm, one of Hawker's foremost aircraft designers, to meet the Royal Air Force's requirement for a lightweight Tempest Mk II replacement; the Tempest, while a successful aircraft, had been viewed as being heavy and oversized for typical fighter duties. Developed as the \\"Tempest Light Fighter (Centaurus)\\", the semi-elliptical wing of the Tempest was incorporated, but was shortened in span by eliminating the central bay of the wing centre-section, the inner part of the undercarriage wells now extending almost to the aircraft centreline, instead of being situated level with the fuselage sides.Goulding 1986, pp. 130‚Äì131.Brown 1980, p. 82.Buttler 2000, p. 46. The fuselage was broadly similar in form to that of the Tempest, but was a fully monocoque structure, while the cockpit level was higher, affording the pilot better all-round visibility.Bridgman 1998, p. 127. The project was formalised in January 1943 when the Air Ministry issued Specification F.2/42 around the \\"Tempest Light Fighter\\".Darling 2002, pp. 12‚Äì13. This was followed up by Specification F.2/43, issued in May 1943, which required a high rate of climb of not less than 4,500 ft/min (23 m/s) from ground level to 20,000 feet (6,096 m), good fighting manoeuvrability and a maximum speed of at least 450 mph (724 km/h) at 22,000 feet (6,705 m). The armament was to be four 20mm Hispano V cannon with a total capacity of 600 rounds, plus the capability of carrying two bombs each up to 1,000 pounds (454 kg). In April 1943, Hawker had also received Specification N.7/43 from the Admiralty, who sought a navalised version of the developing aircraft; in response, Sidney Camm proposed the consolidation of both services' requirements under Specification F.2/43, with the alterations required for naval operations issued on a supplemental basis. Around 1944, the aircraft project finally received its name; the Royal Air Force's version becoming known as the Fury and the Fleet Air Arm's version as the Sea Fury.Darling 2002, pp. 12‚Äì14. Six prototypes were ordered; two were to be powered by Rolls- Royce Griffon engines, two with Centaurus XXIIs, one with a Centaurus XII and one as a test structure. Hawker used the internal designations P.1019 and P.1020 respectively for the Griffon and Centaurus versions, while P.1018 was also used for a Fury prototype which was to use a Napier Sabre IV.Darling 2002, p. 13. The first Fury to fly, on 1 September 1944, was NX798 with a Centaurus XII with rigid engine mounts, powering a Rotol four-blade propeller. Second on 27 November 1944 was LA610, which had a Griffon 85 and Rotol six- blade contra-rotating propeller. By now, development of the Fury and Sea Fury was closely interlinked so that the next prototype to fly was a Sea Fury, SR661, described under \\"Naval Conversion.\\" NX802 (25 July 1945) was the last Fury prototype, powered by a Centaurus XV. LA610 was eventually fitted with a Napier Sabre VII, which was capable of developing 3,400 to 4,000 hp (2,535‚Äì2,983 kW); this aircraft became possibly the fastest reciprocating- engine Hawker aircraft after reaching a speed of around 485 mph (780 km/h).Mason 1991, pp. 342‚Äì347. =Naval version= Sea Fury FB.11 VR930 with wings folded, at Kemble Airfield, Gloucestershire, England. Operated by the Royal Navy Historic Flight. With the end of the Second World War in Europe in sight, the RAF began cancelling many aircraft orders. Thus, the RAF's order for the Fury was cancelled before any production examples were built because the RAF already had large numbers of late Mark Spitfires and Tempests and viewed the Fury as an unnecessary overlap with these aircraft. Although the RAF had pulled out of the programme, development of the type continued as the Sea Fury. Many of the Fleet Air Arm's carrier fighters were Lend-Lease Corsairs or Seafires. The Seafire had considerable drawbacks as a naval aircraft, notably the narrow undercarriage, whilst the Corsairs had to be returned or purchased. The Admiralty opted to procure the Sea Fury as the successor to these aircraft.Darling 2002, p. 14.Mackay 1991, pp. 4‚Äì5. While the RAF contract had been cancelled, the Fury prototypes were completed and used for work in developing the Sea Fury as well as for the export market. The first Sea Fury prototype, SR661, first flew at Langley, Berkshire, on 21 February 1945, powered by a Centaurus XII engine. This prototype had a \\"stinger\\"-type tailhook for arrested carrier landings, but lacked folding wings for storage. SR666, the second prototype, which flew on 12 October 1945, was powered by a Bristol Centaurus XV that turned a new, five-bladed Rotol propeller and featured folding wings. Specification N.7/43 was modified to N.22/43, now representing an order for 200 aircraft. Of these, 100 were to be built at Boulton-Paul's Wolverhampton factory.Darling 2002, pp. 13‚Äì15. In 1945, the original order to specification N.22/43 was reduced to 100 aircraft; as a result, the manufacturing agreement with Boulton-Paul was ended and all work on the Sea Fury transferred to Hawker Aircraft's facilities at Kingston. This included the construction of what was intended to be a Boulton-Paul built Sea Fury prototype, VB857, which was transported to Kingston in January 1945; this aircraft, built to the same standard as SR666, first flew on 31 January 1946. Immediately upon completion of the first three airframes, the flight testing programme began at Kingston. It was soon discovered that the early Centaurus engine suffered frequent crankshaft failure due to a poorly designed lubrication system, which led to incidents of the engine seizing while in mid- flight. The problem was resolved when Bristol's improved Centaurus 18 engine replaced the earlier engine variant.Darling 2002, pp. 15‚Äì16. =Into production= The first production model, the Sea Fury F Mk X (later Sea Fury F.10), flew in September 1946. With the completion of flight testing at Boscombe Down in 1946, the trials process was repeated aboard the aircraft carrier . Carrier testing revealed directional stability issues related to rudder effectiveness during landing, and this was resolved by the adoption of a tail wheel lock, which also improved the wheel retraction behaviour. Several rectifying design changes were made by Hawker in response to feedback from the test pilots, including the adoption of a five-bladed Rotol propeller to greatly reduce overspeed tendencies; a re-designed rudder assembly, to increase rudder effectiveness; Dynafocal engine mountings to reduce vibration at low speeds, and an improved undercarriage with greater flexibility. These changes greatly improved the aircraft's deck landing characteristics. Arrestor hook trials initially revealed the Sea Fury to be prone to missing the wires; this was rapidly resolved by modifications to the hook dampener mechanism.Darling 2002, pp. 15‚Äì17.Mackay 1991, p. 5. By March 1947, production Sea Furies were already being produced for the Fleet Air Arm. The fourth and sixth production aircraft were used in further trials with HMS Illustrious, and the main change from the earlier aircraft was the adoption of a longer, stiffer arrestor hook. Fifty Mk X Sea Furies were produced. These were identical to the SR666 prototype except for the Centaurus 18 engine and four- bladed propeller. At least 20 of the 50 aircraft performed in the aircraft's intensive trials programme. Following the successful completion of weapons trials at the A&AEE; Boscombe Down, the Sea Fury was cleared for operational use on 31 July 1947.Darling 2002, pp. 18‚Äì19. Hawker Aircraft continued to develop and refine the Sea Fury Mk X, resulting in the more capable Sea Fury Mk 11, also known as the Sea Fury FB.11. This upgraded model had several improvements, most notable being the hydraulically powered wing folding mechanism which eased flight deck operations and the adoption of new weapons for performing air-to-ground combat. Iraq ordered a two-seat Sea Fury model and the British Admiralty followed suit. During testing, the rear canopy collapsed, leading to a redesign of the type's two-seat cockpit prior to entering service. Designated as the Sea Fury T.20, a total of 60 trainers were manufactured for the Fleet Air Arm between 1950 and 1952.Darling 2002, p. 20.Mackay 1991, p. 23. The Royal Navy bought a total of 615 Sea Furies, mostly of the Mk 11 standard.Mackay 1991, p. 10. =Export market= Hawker Aircraft was keen to market the Sea Fury to foreign operators, and conducted an intense sales drive for their export version of the aircraft, designated Sea Fury F.50. On 21 October 1946, the Royal Netherlands Navy placed an order for ten F.50 aircraft, which were basically identical to the FAA's Sea Fury Mk X aircraft, to equip the aircraft carrier HNLMS Karel Doorman (ex-).Darling 2002, p. 73. The Dutch also ordered twelve of the later Fury FB.60s in 1948 and these were delivered in 1950. A manufacturing licence was also acquired for the production of twenty-five Sea Fury FB.51s by Fokker Aircraft in the Netherlands, which were delivered from 1951 onwards.Wilson 1993 Sea Fury FB.11 Miss Merced modified for unlimited racing. It had previously served in the Royal Canadian Navy. The Sea Fury became an export success, being purchased both to operate on foreign aircraft carriers and for purely land-based roles by a number of nations, including Australia, West Germany, Iraq, Egypt, Burma, Pakistan and Cuba. Several of the nations that did not have active aircraft carriers often had the tail hooks and catapult hooks removed from their aircraft. A final variant, the Sea Fury T.20S was developed by Hawker for West Germany as target tow aircraft; these remained in service into the 1970s. Upon the type's withdrawal from military service, a large number of Sea Furies were sold to private individuals, often as a racing aircraft due to its high speed.Mackay 1991, pp. 28, 35‚Äì37, 41. The final production figures for all marks reached around 860 aircraft. Design Sea Fury FB.11 fighters of the Royal Canadian Navy The Sea Fury is a navalised aircraft, capable of operating from the aircraft carriers of the Royal Navy. It was heavily based on preceding Hawker fighter aircraft, particularly the Tempest; features such as the semi-elliptical wing and fuselage were derived directly from the Tempest but featured significant refinements, including significant strengthening to withstand the stresses of carrier landings. While the Sea Fury was lighter and smaller than the Tempest, advanced aspects of the Sea Fury's design such as its Centaurus engine meant it was also considerably more powerful and faster; the Sea Fury has the distinction of being the final and fastest of Hawker's reciprocating engine aircraft, as well as being one of the fastest production reciprocating engine fighters ever produced.Darling 2002, pp. 22‚Äì26, 28. The performance of the Sea Fury was striking; in comparison with the 15 years older Hawker Fury biplane the Sea Fury was nearly twice as fast and had double the rate of climb despite far heavier equipment and greater range. The Sea Fury Mk X was capable of attaining a maximum speed of 460 mph and climb to a height of 20,000 feet in under five minutes. The Sea Fury was reportedly a highly aerobatic aircraft with favourable flying behaviour at all heights and speeds, although intentional spinning of the aircraft was banned during the type's military service.Darling 2002, pp. 42‚Äì43. During flight displays, the Sea Fury could demonstrate its ability to perform rapid rolls at a rate of 100 degrees per second, attributed to the spring tab equipped ailerons. For extra thrust on takeoff Jet Assisted Take Off (JATO) could be used.Darling 2002, pp. 36‚Äì38.Mackay 1991, p. 16. RAN FB.11 aircraft in 2011 The Sea Fury was powered by the newly developed Bristol Centaurus reciprocating engine, which drove a five-bladed propeller. Many of the engine's subsystems, such as the fully automated cooling system, cockpit gauges, and fuel booster pump were electrical, powered by an engine-driven generator supplemented by two independent batteries. The hydraulic system, necessary to operate the retractable undercarriage, tail hook, and flaps, was pressurised to 1,800 psi by an engine-driven pump. If this failed, a hand pump in the cockpit could also power these systems. A pneumatic pump was driven by the engine for the brakes. Internal fuel was stored in a total of five self-sealing fuel tanks, two within the fuselage directly in front of the cockpit and three housed within the wings.Darling 2002, pp. 22‚Äì23, 27. Various avionics systems were used on Sea Furies; in this respect it was unusually well equipped for an aircraft of the era. Many aircraft would be equipped with on-board radar, often the ARI 5307 ZBX, which could be directly integrated with a four-channel VHF radio system. Several of the navigational aids, such as the altimeter and G2F compass, were also advanced; many of these subsystems would appear on subsequent jet aircraft with little or no alteration.Darling 2002, p. 38. Other aspects of the Sea Fury, such as the majority of the flight controls, were conventional. Some controls were electrically powered, such as the weapons controls, on-board cameras, and the gyro gunsight. Although the Sea Fury had been originally developed as a pure air superiority fighter, the Royal Navy viewed the solid construction and payload capabilities of the airframe as positive attributes for ground attack as well; accordingly, Hawker tested and cleared the type to use a wide range of armaments and support equipment.Mackay 1991, p. 7. Each aircraft had four wing-mounted 20 mm Hispano V cannon, with up to 16 rocket projectiles, or a combination of 500 lb or 1000 lb bombs being carried too. Other loads included 1000 lb incendiary bombs, mines, type 2 smoke floats or 90 gallon fuel tanks.Darling 2002, p. 19. The Sea Fury could also be fitted with both vertical and oblique cameras with a dedicated control box in the cockpit, for photo reconnaissance missions. Other ancillary equipment included chaff to evade hostile missile attack and flares.Darling 2002, pp. 23, 36‚Äì38. Operational history =United Kingdom= A Sea Fury FB.11 launches from in 1951 Sea Fury T.20 two-seat trainer of No. 1831 Squadron RNVR at RNAS Stretton, Cheshire, in 1951 778 Naval Air Squadron was the first unit of the Fleet Air Arm to receive the Sea Fury, with deliveries commencing in February 1947 to the squadron's Intensive Flying Development Unit, while 787 Squadron, the Naval Air Fighting Development Squadron, received the Sea Fury in May that year.Williams Aeroplane Monthly January 1986, p. 33.Sturtivant and Balance 1994, pp. 98‚Äì98, 109. The first operational unit to be equipped with the Sea Fury was 803 Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Canadian Navy, which replaced Seafires with Sea Furies in August 1947, with 807 Naval Air Squadron was the first operational Royal Navy Sea Fury squadron when it received the aircraft in September that year. The Seafire was ill-suited to carrier use, as the pilot's poor view of the deck and the aircraft's narrow undercarriage made both landings and takeoffs difficult. Consequently, the Sea Fury F Mk X replaced the Seafire on most carriers.\\"Hawker Sea Fury aircraft profile.\\" Aircraft Database of the Fleet Air Arm Archive 1939‚Äì1945. Retrieved: 23 March 2006. For some years the Sea Fury and Seafire operated alongside each other, with the shorter-range Seafire operating as a fleet defence fighter while the Sea Fury was employed as a longer-range fighter-bomber.Darling 2002, pp. 19‚Äì20. Sea Furies were issued to Nos. 736, 738, 759 and 778 Squadrons of the Fleet Air Arm. The F Mk X was followed by the Sea Fury FB.11 fighter-bomber variant, which eventually reached a production total of 650 aircraft. The Sea Fury remained the Fleet Air Arm's primary fighter-bomber until 1953, at which point jet-powered aircraft, such as the Hawker Sea Hawk and Supermarine Attacker, were introduced to operational service.Mackay 1991, pp. 10, 17. The Sea Fury FB.11 entered service with the fighter squadrons of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR) in August 1951. The RNVR units also operated the Sea Fury T.20 two-seat trainer version from late 1950 to give reserve pilots experience on the type before relinquishing their Supermarine Seafire aircraft. RNVR units which were equipped with the Sea Fury were Nos. 1831, 1832, 1833, 1834, 1835 and 1836 Squadrons. No. 1832, based at RAF Benson, was the last RNVR squadron to relinquish the type in August 1955 for the jet-powered Supermarine Attacker.Mackay 1991, p. 17. Korean War Following the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950, Sea Furies were dispatched to the region as a part of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea, Britain's contribution to the United Nations multinational task force to assist South Korea following an invasion by North Korea. Sea Furies were flown throughout the conflict, primarily as ground-attack aircraft, from the Royal Navy light fleet carriers , , , and the Australian carrier .\\"Sea Fury History\\". Unlimited Air Racing. Retrieved: 9 March 2007. After a Fleet Air Arm Seafire was shot down by a United States Air Force Boeing B-29 Superfortress on 28 July 1950, all Commonwealth aircraft were painted with black and white invasion stripes.Hobbs 2011, pp. 30‚Äì36. The first Sea Furies arrived with 807 Naval Air Squadron embarked on Theseus, which relieved in October 1950. Operations on Theseus were intense, and the Sea Furies of 807 Squadron flew a total of 264 combat sorties in October. During a brief rest period at the Japanese port of Iwakuni the catapult was found to be excessively worn, necessitating the launch of Sea Furies with RATOG assistance until it was repaired. In December 1950, Sea Furies conducted several strikes on bridges, airfields, and railways to disrupt North Korean logistics, flying a further 332 sorties without incurring any losses. At this early point in the war little aerial resistance was encountered and the biggest threats were ground-based anti-aircraft fire or technical problems.Darling 2002, pp. 51‚Äì52. In addition to their ground attack role, Sea Furies also performed air patrols. In this role a total of 3,900 interceptions were carried out, although none of the intercepted aircraft turned out to be hostile. During the winter period, the Sea Furies were often called upon as spotter aircraft for UN artillery around Inchon, Wonsan, and Songiin.Darling 2002, pp. 52‚Äì53. In April 1951, 804 Naval Air Squadron operating off Glory, replaced 807 Squadron, which in turn was replaced by Sydney in September 1951 with 805 and 808 Squadron RAN. The Australian carrier air group flew 2,366 combat sorties. In January 1952, Glory with 804 NAS returned to relieve Sydney following a refit in Australia. For the rest of the war Glory and Ocean relieved each other on duty. In 1952, the first Chinese MiG-15 jet fighters appeared. On 8 August 1952, Lieutenant Peter \\"Hoagy\\" Carmichael, of 802 Squadron, flying Sea Fury WJ232 from HMS Ocean, was credited with shooting down a MiG-15, marking him as one of only a few pilots of a propeller-driven aircraft to shoot down a jet during the Korean War.Mackay 1991, p. 2. The engagement occurred when Sea Furies and Fireflies were engaged by eight MiG-15s, during which one Firefly was badly damaged while the Sea Furies escaped unharmed. Some sources claim that this is the only successful engagement by a British pilot in a British aircraft during the Korean War, although a few sources claim a second MiG was downed or damaged in the same action.\\"UN Air-to-Air Victories during the Korean War, 1950‚Äì1953\\".

Australia was one of three Commonwealth nations to operate the Sea Fury, with the others being Canada and Pakistan. The type was operated by two frontline squadrons of the Royal Australian Navy, 805 Squadron and 808 Squadron; a third squadron that flew the Sea Fury, 850 Squadron, was also briefly active. Two Australian aircraft carriers, HMAS Sydney and HMAS Vengeance, employed Sea Furies in their air wings. The Sea Fury was used by Australia during the Korean War, flying from carriers based along the Korean coast in support of friendly ground forces. The Sea Fury would be operated by Australian forces between 1948 and 1962.Mackay 1991, p. 31. =Burma= Between 1957 and 1958, Burma received 21 Sea Furies, the majority of them being ex-FAA aircraft. The Sea Fury was frequently employed as a counter-insurgency platform in Burmese service and on 15 February 1961, a Republic of China Air Force Consolidated PB4Y Privateer was intercepted and shot down by a Sea Fury near the Thai-Burmese border. Of the aircraft's crew, five were killed and two were captured.

It is believed that the Burmese Sea Furies were retired in 1968, and replaced by armed Lockheed T-33 Shooting Stars.Mackay 1991, p. 38. =Canada= Canadian Sea Fury FB.11 serial number WG566 The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) became a significant customer of the Sea Fury, and many of its aircraft were diverted from existing Royal Navy contracts. On 23 June 1948, the first aircraft was accepted at RCAF Rockcliffe. The type was quickly put to use replacing Canada's existing inventory of Seafires, taking on the primary role of fleet air defence operating from the aircraft carrier . Two Canadian squadrons operated the Sea Fury, Nos. 803 and 883 Squadrons, which were later renumbered as 870 and 871. Pilot training on the Sea Fury was normally conducted at the RCN's HMCS Shearwater land base. Landing difficulties with the Sea Fury were experienced following the RCN's decision to convert to the U.S. Navy's deck landing procedures, which were prone to overstressing and damaging the airframes, as the Sea Fury had been designed for a tail-down landing attitude.Darling 2002, pp. 73‚Äì74. The Sea Fury would be operated between 1948 and 1956 by the RCN, whereupon they were replaced by the jet-powered McDonnell F2H Banshee. The retired aircraft were put into storage, and some were subsequently purchased by civilians.Mackay 1991, p. 28. =Cuba= Museo Giron, Cuba in 2006 In 1958 during the Cuban Revolution, the Fuerza A√©rea del Ejercito de Cuba (FAEC) purchased a total of 17 refurbished (ex-Fleet Air Arm) Sea Furies from Hawker, comprising fifteen FB.11s and two T.20 trainers. The aircraft were briefly flown by FAEC prior to the ousting of President Fulgencio Batista and the assumption of power by Fidel Castro. Following the change in government, the Sea Furies were retained by the Fuerza A√©rea Revolucionaria (\\"Revolutionary Air Force\\"; FAR); these aircraft proved difficult to keep operational, partially because the new military lacked personnel experienced with the type. In April 1961, during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, air support for the Cuban exiles' Brigade 2506 was provided by ex-USAF, CIA-operated Douglas B-26B Invaders; United States President John F. Kennedy had decided against involving U.S. Navy aircraft.Ferrer 1982, p. 184. The only FAR fighter aircraft to see combat were three Sea Furies and five Lockheed T-33 armed jet trainers belonging to the Escuadr√≥n Persecuci√≥n y Combate (\\"Pursuit & Combat Squadron\\"), based at the San Antonio de los Ba√±os and Antonio Maceo air bases.Mario E. \\"Bay of Pigs: In the Skies Over Gir√≥n\\". 2000, (18 March 2014.)Cooper, Tom. \\"Clandestine US Operations: Cuba, 1961, Bay of Pigs\\". 2007, (18 March 2014.) Museum of the Revolution in Havana In pre-emptive attacks on 15 April, two Sea Furies were destroyed on the ground, one at Ciudad Libertad and one in a hangar near Moa. During the ensuing aerial combat, a single airborne Sea Fury was lost during the Invasion.Mackay 1991, p. 39. In the early hours of 17 April, Brigade 2506 began to land at Playa Gir√≥n. Around 06:30, a FAR formation composed of three Sea Furies, one B-26 and two T-33s started attacking the exiles' ships. At about 06:50, south of Playa Larga, the transport ship Houston was damaged by rockets and cannons from FAR aircraft, including Sea Furies piloted by Major Enrique Carreras Rojas and Captain Gustavo Bourzac; Houston caught fire and was abandoned. While attempting to land at an airbase, Carreras Rojas's Sea Fury was attacked and damaged by a CIA B-26; he was able to abort his approach and escape. Carreras Rojas later shot down another B-26. While attempting to shoot down a Curtiss C-46 transport aircraft, Nicaraguan-born pilot Carlos Ulloa crashed in the Bay of Pigs around 08:30, either due to an engine stall or being hit by anti-aircraft fire. Around 09:30, multiple FAR aircraft destroyed an ammunition ship, Rio Escondido. A Sea Fury piloted by Lieutenant Douglas Rudd also destroyed a B-26. =Netherlands= The Netherlands was the first export customer for the Sea Fury, and the Netherlands Royal Navy operated the aircraft from two of their aircraft carriers, both of which were named HNLMS Karel Doorman as they were operated at separate periods from one another. It was common for Royal Netherlands Navy vessels to operate alongside Royal Navy ships, thus Dutch Sea Furies also regularly operated from FAA land bases and RN carriers. During 1947, Dutch Sea Furies operating from HNLMS Karel Doorman were employed in a ground support capacity against insurgent fighters in the Dutch East Indies. The Dutch procured and licence-built additional Sea Furies for carrier operations, although the type was ultimately replaced by the jet-powered Hawker Sea Hawk from the late 1950s onwards.Mackay 1991, p. 33. =Pakistan= One of the largest export customers for the type was Pakistan. In 1949, an initial order for 50 Sea Fury FB.60 aircraft for the Pakistan Air Force was placed. A total of 87 new-build Sea Furies were purchased and delivered between 1950 and 1952; some ex-FAA and Iraqi Sea Furies were also subsequently purchased. The aircraft was operated by three frontline squadrons, Nos. 5, 9, and 14 Squadrons. The Sea Fury began to be replaced by the jet-powered North American F-86 Sabre in 1955, and the last Sea Furies in Pakistani service were ultimately retired in 1960.Mackay 1991, pp. 35‚Äì36.

Sea Furies were overhauled by Hawker Aircraft at their factory at Blackpool during 1959 and supplied to civil companies in Germany, equipped with target-towing gear for Luftwaffe contract flying. Some of these aircraft survive.

These include Dreadnought and Furias, which have had Wasp Major engines installed. Ex-Iraqi Fury 326 (C/N 41H/643827) restored in New Zealand in the 1980s was painted as WJ232, the aircraft 'Hoagy' Carmichael flew during the 9 August 1952 action which resulted in him being credited with the destruction of a MiG-15 jet fighter,.Take Off magazine, Part 84, pp. 2338‚Äì2339. The aircraft was sold in Australia in its Royal Navy markings, with civil registration VH-SHF. The original WJ232 was sold by the Royal Navy back to Hawker, refurbished and delivered to Burma as UB467 in 1958. Many additional airframes remain as static displays in museums worldwide. One of these, ex-RCN WG565, is on display in Calgary, Alberta, in Canada. It was ferried to Alberta for instructional use in the Alberta Provincial Institute of Technology by Lieutenant Commander Derek Prout. On 1 April 1958, Flying Officer Lynn Garrison, of the 403 City of Calgary Squadron, RCAF, made the final Canadian military flight for this aircraft type. An airframe is on display outside the Granma Memorial, as part of the Museum of the Revolution in Havana. A second airframe forms an outside part of the Museo Giron in Playa Gir√≥n. During the 1989 Prestwick (Glasgow) Air Show, a Sea Fury had to be ditched in the sea as the port landing gear was stuck. The pilot parachuted to safety.Sea Fury - RNHF documentary On 31 July 2014 a Hawker Sea Fury T.20 (VX281) owned by Royal Navy Historic Flight made a controlled crash landing at the RNAS Culdrose Air Day. During the display, smoke was seen coming from the plane's engine. During an approach for an emergency landing, the undercarriage extended but failed to lock, leading to a belly landing. Lt Cdr Chris Gotke, 44, the pilot, suffered no injuries and was later awarded the Air Force Cross for his decision to continue to fly the aircraft to safety rather than parachute out and abandon it; he later stated that \\"The safety of the crowd was never a factor because the aircraft was fully controllable.\\" This aircraft returned to the air in September 2017 following repairs.BBC News Cornwall ‚Äì Aircraft crashes on to runway at Royal Navy Air Day retrieved 13 August 2014.

This should not be confused with the unrelated notion (widely used in algebraic topology) of a compactly generated space -- one whose topology is generated (in a suitable sense) by its compact subspaces.  Definition  A topological group G is said to be compactly generated if there exists a compact subset K of G such that :\\\\langle K\\\\rangle = \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} (K \\\\cup K^{-1})^n = G. So if K is symmetric, i.e. K = K ‚àí1, then :G = \\\\bigcup_{n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}} K^n.  Locally compact case  This property is interesting in the case of locally compact topological groups, since locally compact compactly generated topological groups can be approximated by locally compact, separable metric factor groups of G. More precisely, for a sequence :Un of open identity neighborhoods, there exists a normal subgroup N contained in the intersection of that sequence, such that :G/N is locally compact metric separable (the Kakutani-Kodaira-Montgomery-Zippin theorem).

Parts of the hemelytra of a typical bug An elytron (; from Greek ·ºîŒªœÖœÑœÅŒøŒΩ \\"sheath, cover\\"; plural: elytra ). is a modified, hardened forewing of certain insect orders, notably beetles (Coleoptera) and a few of the true bugs (Hemiptera) such as the family Schizopteridae; in most true bugs, the forewings are instead called hemelytra (sometimes alternatively spelled as \\"hemielytra\\"), as only the basal half is thickened while the apex is membranous. An elytron is sometimes also referred to as a shard. Description The elytra primarily serve as protective wing-cases for the hindwings underneath, which are used for flying. To fly, a beetle typically opens the elytra and then extends the hindwings, flying while still holding the elytra open, though some beetles in the families Scarabaeidae and Buprestidae can fly with the elytra closed. In some groups, the elytra are fused together, rendering the insect flightless. Some of the ground beetles (family Carabidae) are a good example of this.

It was the evolution of a prototype called the SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) that was developed at the IBM Palo Alto Scientific Center in 1973. In January 1978, IBM announced the IBM 5110, its larger cousin, and in February 1980 IBM announced the IBM 5120. The 5100 was withdrawn in March 1982. When the IBM PC was introduced in 1981, it was originally designated as the IBM 5150, putting it in the \\"5100\\" series, though its architecture was unrelated to the IBM 5100's. SCAMP, the prototype In 1973, Bill Lowe was instrumental in fostering an engineering prototype called SCAMP (Special Computer APL Machine Portable) created by Dr. Paul Friedl and a team at the IBM Los Gatos Scientific Center. SCAMP has been dubbed in PC Magazine as \\"the world's first personal computer\\" Friedl, Paul J., \\"SCAMP: The Missing Link in the PCs Past\\", PC Magazine, PC 2, No. 6, November, 1983, pp.190-197 The IBM Los Gatos engineering prototype and a design model by IBM Industrial designer Tom Hardy, were utilized internally by Lowe in his early efforts to demonstrate the viability of creating a single-user computer.Atkinson, P, (2013) DELETE: A Design History of Computer Vapourware, London: Bloomsbury Publishing. Description The IBM 5100 is based on a 16-bit processor module called PALM (Put All Logic in Microcode). The IBM 5100 Maintenance Information Manual also referred to the PALM module as the controller. The PALM could directly address 64 KiB of memory. Some configurations of the IBM 5100 had Executable ROS (ROM) and RAM memory totalling more than 64 KiB, so a simple bank switching scheme was used. The actual APL and BASIC interpreters were stored in a separate Language ROS address space which the PALM treats as a peripheral device. Prices ranged from $11,000 (16k model) to $20,000 (64k). =Portable personal computer= BYTE in December 1975 stated \\"Welcome, IBM, to personal computing\\". Describing the 5100 as \\"a 50-lb package of interactive personal computing\\", the magazine stated that with the company's announcement \\"personal computing gains an entry from the industry's production and service giant\\", albeit \\"at a premium price\\". A single integrated unit provided the keyboard, five-inch CRT display, tape drive, processor, several hundred KiB of read-only memory containing system software, and up to 64 KiB of RAM. It was the size of a small suitcase, weighed about 55 lb (25 kg), and could be transported in an optional carrying case, hence the \\"portable\\" designation. In 1975 it was an amazing technical accomplishment to package a complete computer with a large amount of ROM and RAM, CRT display, and a tape drive into a machine that small; it was two more years before the similar but much cheaper Commodore PET was released - and it was not portable. Earlier desktop computers of approximately the same size, such as the HP 9830, did not include a CRT nor nearly as much memory. =Display= The 5100 has an internal CRT (5\\" diagonal) and displays 16 lines of 64 characters. IBM provided an option switch to allow the user to display all 64 characters of each line, or only the left or right 32 characters (interspersed with spaces). Also there was a switch to display the first 512 bytes of main memory in hexadecimal for diagnostic purposes. =Mass storage= Mass storage was provided by removable quarter-inch cartridge (QIC) magnetic tape drives that use standard DC300 cartridges to store 204 Kbytes. One drive was installed in the machine and a second (Model 5106) could be added in an attached box. The data format included several types and were written in 512 byte records. =External monitor= An external video monitor (or modified television receiver) could be connected to the IBM 5100 via a BNC connector on the back panel. While the 5100 had a front panel switch to select between white on black or black on white for the internal display, this switch did not affect the external monitor, which only offered bright characters on a black background. The vertical scan rate was fixed at 60 Hz. =Communications adapter= Also in September 1975 IBM announced the IBM 5100 Communications Adapter, that allowed the 5100 to transmit data to and receive data from a remote system. It made the 5100 appear the same as an IBM 2741 Communications Terminal and was designed to be able to communicate with IBM 2741 compatible machines in start- stop mode using the EBCD (Extended Binary Coded Decimal) notation. EBCD was similar to the more common IBM EBCDIC code, but not identical. =Research Device Coupler= In Volume 16, Number 1, Page 41 (1977) of the IBM Systems Journal the article \\"The IBM 5100 and the Research Device Coupler ‚Äî A personal laboratory automation system\\" read: \\"A small laboratory automation system has been developed by using the IBM 5100 Portable Computer in conjunction with the Research Device Coupler. This compact system provides a dedicated, high-level- language computer and a versatile data acquisition and control interface for experiments in which data rates do not exceed 9600 baud. Two experiments exemplify the use of the system. The Research Device Coupler described in this paper is a prototype of the IBM 7406 Device Coupler.\\" =Different models= Available with 16 KB, 32 KB, 48 KB or 64 KB of main storage, the 5100 sold for between $8,975 and $19,975 (between c. $ and $ in today's dollars). Programming languages The 5100 was available with APL, BASIC, or both programming languages. At the time of introduction, APL was generally available only on mainframe computers, and most desktop sized computers such as the Wang 2200 or HP 9830 offered only BASIC. Machines that supported both languages provided a toggle switch on the front panel to select the language. When the engineers at IBM asked one beta tester, Donald Polonis, for his analysis, he commented that if folks had to learn APL to use it, the IBM 5100 would not make it as a personal computer. He tried to impress the fact that a personal computer had to be easy to use to be accepted. Presumably, the special APL character set and APL keyboard were the primary obstacles to newcomers learning APL easily. APL had powerful features for manipulating data as vectors and matrices, while the competing HP 9830 had to offer language extensions on an add-on ROM for matrix operations. Although not meant for regular users, the maintenance manual described a keyboard sequence to switch the 5100 into a maintenance mode. In this mode it was possible to read and write directly in RAM memory, video memory, CPU registers, interrupt vectors, clock counter, etc, using hexadecimal codes equivalent to assembly language. This allowed writing sophisticated programs directly into RAM. As this mode was a single-user system effectively running without an operating system, a determined user could manage the memory space and write stable multi-tasking programs using interrupts. Problem-solver libraries IBM offered three problem-solver libraries, contained in magnetic tape cartridges, with the IBM 5100 to provide more than 1000 interactive routines applicable to mathematical problems, statistical techniques and financial analyses. Emulator in microcode The 5100 was based on IBM's innovative concept that, using an emulator written in microcode, a small and relatively cheap computer could run programs already written for much larger, and much more expensive, existing computers, without the time and expense of writing and debugging new programs. Two such programs were included: a slightly modified version of APLSV, IBM's APL interpreter for its System/370 mainframes, and the BASIC interpreter used on IBM's System/3 minicomputer. Consequently, the 5100's microcode was written to emulate most of the functionality of both a System/370 and a System/3. IBM later used the same approach for its 1983 introduction of the XT/370 model of the IBM PC, which was a standard IBM PC XT with the addition of a System/370 emulator card.

After the death of his grandfather Emperor Frederick III, Wilhelm became crown prince at the age of six, retaining that title for more than 30 years until the fall of the empire on 9 November 1918. During World War I, he commanded the 5th Army from 1914 to 1916 and was commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince for the remainder of the war. Crown Prince Wilhelm became head of the House of Hohenzollern on 4 June 1941 following the death of his father and held the position until his own death on 20 July 1951. Early life Wilhelm was born on 6 May 1882 in the Marmorpalais of Potsdam in the Province of Brandenburg. He was the eldest son of Wilhelm II, the last German Kaiser (Emperor) (1859‚Äì1941), and his first wife, Princess Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein (1858‚Äì1921). When he was born, his great-grandfather Wilhelm I was the emperor and his grandfather Crown Prince Frederick was the heir apparent, making Wilhelm third in line to the throne. His birth sparked an argument between his parents and his grandmother Crown Princess Victoria. Before Wilhelm was born, his grandmother had expected to be asked to help find a nurse, but since her son did everything he could to snub her, the future Wilhelm II asked his aunt Helena to help. His mother was hurt and his grandmother, Queen Victoria, who was the younger Wilhelm's great-grandmother, furious.Queen Victoria's Family, A Century of Photographs, Charlotte Zeepvat When his great-grandfather and grandfather both died in 1888, six-year-old Wilhelm became the heir apparent to the German and Prussian thrones. Wilhelm was a supporter of association football, then a relatively new sport in the country, donating a cup to the German Football Association in 1908 and thereby initiating the Kronprinzenpokal (now L√§nderpokal), the oldest cup competition in German football.\\"Kick it like Kronprinz\\" Spiegel Online. Retrieved 11 June 2009 The German club BFC Preussen was also originally named BFC Friedrich Wilhelm in his honour. In 1914, the Kaiser ordered the construction of Schloss Cecilienhof in Potsdam for Prince Wilhelm and his family. The Schloss was loosely inspired by Bidston Court in Birkenhead, England, resembling a Tudor manor. Completed in 1917, it became the main residence for the Crown Prince for a time. World War I Wilhelm had been active in pushing German expansion, and sought a leading role on the outbreak of war. Despite being only thirty-two and having never commanded a unit larger than a regiment, the German Crown Prince was named commander of the 5th Army in August 1914, shortly after the outbreak of World War I. However, under the well-established Prussian/German General Staff model then in use, inexperienced nobles who were afforded commands of large army formations were always provided with (and expected to defer to the advice of) experienced chiefs of staff to assist them in their duties. As Emperor, Wilhelm's father instructed the Crown Prince to defer to the advice of his experienced chief of staff Konstantin Schmidt von Knobelsdorf.Chief of Staff: Napoleonic Wars to World War I, David Zabecki In October 1914 Wilhelm gave his first interview to a foreign correspondent and the first statement to the press made by a German noble since the outbreak of war.Elter page 74Wiegand page 3 He denied promoting military solutions to diplomatic problems, and said this in English: From August 1915 onwards, Wilhelm was given the additional role as commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince. In 1916 his troops began the Verdun Offensive, a year-long effort to destroy the French armies that would end in failure. Wilhelm relinquished command of the 5th Army in November of that year, but remained commander of the Army Group German Crown Prince for the rest of the war. 1918‚Äì34 After the outbreak of the German Revolution in 1918, both Emperor Wilhelm II and the Crown Prince signed the document of abdication. On 13 November, the former Crown Prince fled Germany, crossed into the Netherlands at Oudvroenhoven and was later interned on the island of Wieringen (now part of the mainland), near Den Helder. In the autumn of 1921, Gustav Stresemann visited Wilhelm, and the former Crown Prince voiced an interest in returning to Germany, even as a private citizen. After Stresemann became chancellor in August 1923, Wilhelm was allowed to return after giving assurances that he would not engage in politics. He chose 9 November 1923 for this, which infuriated his father, who had not been informed about the plans of his son and who felt the historic date to be inappropriate. In June 1926, a referendum on expropriating the former ruling Princes of Germany without compensation failed and as a consequence, the financial situation of the Hohenzollern family improved considerably. A settlement between the state and the family made Cecilienhof property of the state but granted a right of residence to Wilhelm and Cecilie. This was limited in duration to three generations. The family also kept the ownership of Monbijou Palace in Berlin, Ole≈õnica Castle in Silesia, and Rheinsberg Palace until 1945. Meeting Adolf Hitler in 1933 Wilhelm broke the promise he had made to Stresemann to stay out of politics. Adolf Hitler visited Wilhelm at Cecilienhof three times, in 1926, in 1933 (on the \\"Day of Potsdam\\") and in 1935. Wilhelm joined Der Stahlhelm, which merged in 1931 into the Harzburg Front, a far-right organisation of those opposed to the democratic republic. The former Crown Prince was reportedly interested in the idea of running for Reichspr√§sident as the right-wing candidate against Paul von Hindenburg in 1932, until his father (who privately supported Hindenburg) forbade him from acting on the idea. After his plans to become president had been blocked by his father, Wilhelm supported Hitler's rise to power. 1934‚Äì51 After the murder of his friend Kurt von Schleicher, the former Chancellor, in the Night of the Long Knives (1934), he withdrew from all political activities. When Wilhelm realised that Hitler had no intention of restoring the monarchy, their relationship cooled. Upon his father's death in 1941, Wilhelm succeeded him as head of the House of Hohenzollern, the former German imperial dynasty. He was approached by those in the military and the diplomatic service who wanted to replace Hitler, but Wilhelm turned them down. After the ill-fated assassination attempt on 20 July 1944, Hitler nevertheless had Wilhelm placed under supervision by the Gestapo and had his home at Cecilienhof watched. In January 1945, Wilhelm left Potsdam for Oberstdorf for a treatment of his gall and liver problems. His wife Cecilie fled in early February 1945 as the Red Army drew closer to Berlin, but they had been living apart for a long time. At the end of the war, Wilhelm's home, Cecilienhof, was seized by the Soviets. The palace was subsequently used by the Allied Powers as the venue for the Potsdam Conference. At the end of the war, Wilhelm was captured by French Moroccan troops in Baad, Austria and was interned as a (World War I) war criminal. Transferred to Hechingen, Germany, he lived for a short time in Hohenzollern Castle under house arrest before moving to a small five-room house at F√ºrstenstra√üe 16 in Hechingen where he died on 20 July 1951, of a heart attack. Three days later, his opponent in the Battle of Verdun, Marshal Philippe P√©tain, died in prison in France.The Life Of Crown Prince William by Klaus Jonas, 1961 pp. 214-30. Wilhelm and his wife are buried at Hohenzollern Castle. Family and children With his father and his son, Prince Wilhelm, in 1927 Wilhelm married Duchess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (20 September 1886 ‚Äì 6 May 1954) in Berlin on 6 June 1905. After their marriage, the couple lived at the Crown Prince's Palace in Berlin in the winter and at the Marmorpalais in Potsdam. Cecilie was the daughter of Grand Duke Frederick Francis III, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg- Schwerin (1851‚Äì1897) and his wife, Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia (1860‚Äì1922). Their eldest son, Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, was killed fighting for the German Army in France in 1940. However, during the early stages of his marriage the crown prince had a brief affair with the American opera singer Geraldine Farrar, and he later had a relationship with the dancer Mata Hari, as well as with actress Ossi Oswalda.

He was the longest serving justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.  Early life and career  Born in Meaford, Canada West (now Ontario) to a Congregationalist minister, Duff received a Bachelor of Arts in mathematics and metaphysics from the University of Toronto in 1887. After graduation, he taught at Barrie Collegiate Institute while studying for the bar. Duff later took courses at Osgoode Hall Law School and was called to the Ontario Bar in 1893. Duff practiced as a lawyer in Fergus, Ontario after being called to the bar. In 1895, Duff moved to Victoria, British Columbia and continued his career there. In 1895, he was made a Queen's Counsel. In 1903, he took part, as junior counsel for Canada, in the Alaska Boundary arbitration. In 1923 Mount Duff (Yakutat), also known as Boundary Peak 174 was named after him. Judicial and other appointments Bust of the Rt. Hon. Sir Lyman Duff in the Supreme Court of Canada building. In 1904, he was appointed a puisne judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia. In 1906 was appointed a justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. On January 14, 1914, he was appointed to Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council.Appointment notice at Duff was the first and only Puisne Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada to be appointed to the Imperial Privy Council. In 1924 he was elected honorary bencher of Gray's Inn, at the recommendation of Lord Birkenhead. In 1931, he served as Administrator of the Government of Canada between the departure of Lord Bessborough for England and the arrival of Lord Tweedsmuir. Duff took on the position, as the Chief Justice was unavailable. As Administrator, Duff opened Parliament and read the Speech from the Throne on 12 March 1931, becoming the first Canadian-born person to do so. In 1933, Duff was appointed Chief Justice of Canada, succeeding to Chief Justice Anglin. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St. Michael and St. George the following yearAppointment notice at as a result of Prime Minister Richard Bennett's temporary suspension of the Nickle Resolution. When Governor General Lord Tweedsmuir died in office on February 11, 1940, Chief Justice Duff became the Administrator of the Government. He held the office for nearly four months, until King George VI appointed Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone as Governor General on June 21, 1940. Duff was the first Canadian to hold the position, even in the interim. A Canadian-born Governor General was not appointed until Vincent Massey in 1952. Duff also heard more than eighty appeals on the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, mostly Canadian appeals; however, he never heard Privy Council appeals from the Supreme Court of Canada while he served on the latter. The last Privy Council appeal heard by Duff was the 1946 Reference Re Persons of Japanese Race. In 1942, Duff served as the sole member of a Royal Commission constituted to examine the Liberal government's conduct in relation to the defence of Hong Kong. The resulting report, which completely exonerated the government, proved to be controversial, and was seen by many as a whitewash. Upon reaching the mandatory retirement age for judges in 1939, his term of office was extended by three years by special Act of Parliament; in 1943, his term of office was extended for another year by Parliament. He retired as Chief Justice in 1944. Impact J.L. Ilsley, J.C. McRuer, Sir Lyman Duff, John T. Hackett, K.C., W.L. Mackenzie King, Thibaudeau Rinfret. Duff employed a conservative form of statutory interpretation. In a 1935 Supreme Court judgment, he detailed how judges should interpret statutes: Duff has been called a \\"master of trenchant and incisive English,\\" who \\"wrote his opinions in a style which bears comparison with Holmes or Birkenhead.\\" at 51 A former assistant of Duff, Kenneth Campbell, argued that Duff was \\"frequently ranked as the equal of Justices Holmes and Brandeis of the United States Supreme Court,\\"Campbell 1974, at 243 and Gerald Le Dain asserted that Duff \\"is generally considered to have been one of Canada's greatest judges.\\"Le Dain 1974, at 261 Other writers have taken a less favourable view, instead arguing that Duff's reputation is largely unearned; his biographer concluded that he was not an original thinker, but essentially a \\"talent student and exponent of the law rather than a creator of it.\\" More recent commentary has focused on Duff's legal formalism and its effect on Canadian federalism. Bora Laskin attacked Duff's decisions, arguing that Duff used circular reasoning and hid his policy-laden decisions behind the doctrine of stare decisis., at 1069-70.

This is primarily a Mediterranean genus, occurring in desert and coastal habitats of Southern Europe, North Africa, the Canary Islands and the Middle East. The range of one species extends eastward into Central Asia. The genus consists of annual or biennial herbaceous plants with white, sub-silky hairs on the soft stems, growing to a height of 20‚Äì50 cm. They grow on uncultivated or disturbed land and roadsides. They are hardy, surviving in dry to very dry environments or cold spells. The small, alternate, entire leaves are elliptic to obovate. They have short petioles at the base of the stem but are sessile in the upper half. The solitary inflorescence grows at the top of the branches. The large, slightly convex receptacle shows numerous, yellowish orange, hermaphrodite disc florets and two whorls of yellow ray florets. They flower from March to July. The long, villous, involucral bracts end in an apical sharp-pointed spine. The achene is glabrous or is covered with short hairs. The essential oil of Pallenis spinosa consists for the main part of oxygenated sesquiterpenoids. Pallenis maritima is a protected plant in southern France.

The umbilical vein provides convenient access to the central circulation of a neonate for restoration of blood volume and for administration of glucose and drugs. The blood pressure inside the umbilical vein is approximately 20 mmHg.Wang, Y. Vascular biology of the placenta. in Colloquium Series on Integrated Systems Physiology: from Molecule to Function. 2010. Morgan & Claypool Life Sciences. Fetal circulation The unpaired umbilical vein carries oxygen and nutrient rich blood derived from fetal-maternal blood exchange at the chorionic villi. More than two-thirds of fetal hepatic circulation is via the main portal vein, while the remainder is shunted from the left portal vein via the ductus venosus to the inferior vena cava, eventually being delivered to the fetal right atrium. Closure Closure of the umbilical vein usually occurs after the umbilical arteries have closed. This prolongs the communication between the placenta and fetal heart, allowing for a sort of autotransfusion of remaining blood from the placenta to the fetus. Within a week of birth, the neonate's umbilical vein is completely obliterated and is replaced by a fibrous cord called the round ligament of the liver (also called ligamentum teres hepatis). It extends from the umbilicus to the transverse fissure, where it joins with the falciform ligament of the liver to separate segment 4 from segments 2 and 3 of the left hepatic lobe. Recanalization Under extreme pressure, the round ligament may reopen to allow the passage of blood. Such recanalization may be evident in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. Patients with cirrhosis experience rapid growth of scar tissue in and around the liver, often functionally obstructing nearby vessels. Vessel occlusion increases vascular resistance and therefore leads to hypertension. In portal hypertension, the vessels surrounding the liver are subjected to abnormally high blood pressure--so high, in fact, that the force of the blood pressing against the round ligament is sufficient to recanalize the structure. This leads to a condition called Caput medusae. Catheterization A newborn baby has a patent umbilical vein for at least a week after birth. This umbilical vein may be catheterised for ready intravenous access. It may be used as a site for regular transfusion in cases of erythroblastosis or hemolytic disease. It also provides a route for measuring central venous pressure. Additional images Image:Gray31.pngModel of human embryo 1.3 mm. long. Image:Gray39.pngScheme of placental circulation.

An alpine garden tries to imitate the conditions of the plants' place of origin. One example of this is using large stones and gravel beds, rather than the soil that naturally grows there. Though the plants can often cope with low temperatures, they dislike standing in damp soil during the winter months. The soil used is typically poor (sandy) but extremely well-drained. One of the main obstacles in developing an alpine garden is the unnatural conditions which exist in some areas, particularly mild or severe winters and heavy rainfall, such as those present in the United Kingdom and Ireland. This can be avoided by growing the plants in an alpine house or unheated greenhouse, which tries to reproduce the ideal conditions.

The genus is named after the dryads, the tree nymphs of ancient Greek mythology. The classification of Dryas within the Rosaceae has been unclear.. The genus was formerly placed in the subfamily Rosoideae, but is now placed in subfamily Dryadoideae.. The species are superficially similar to Geum (with which they share the common name avens), Potentilla and Fragaria (strawberry). However, Dryas are distinct in having flowers with eight petals (rarely seven or up to ten), instead of the five petals found in most other genera in the Rosaceae. The flowers are erect and white with a yellow centre (Dryas integrifolia, Dryas octopetala) or pendulous and all-yellow (Dryas drummondii), and held conspicuously above the small plants. This makes them very popular in rockeries and alpine gardens. The hybrid Dryas √ó suendermannii, with cream coloured flowers, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit. Dryas tolerates a wide variety of unshaded habitats, including alpine situations with sand or gravel substrate, similar substrates in flat tundra lowlands, and also fen habitats upon organic substrate where some shading from adjacent sedges or shrubs may occur. The Younger Dryas and Older Dryas stadials are geological periods of cold temperature that are named after Dryas octopetala, which flourished during that time and is used as a fossil indicator of those periods.

In 1951, a freelance salesman pitched G.W. a sketch of some proposed bank-type partitions for the United Auto Workers headquarters in Detroit. The company won the contract to manufacture the floor-to-ceiling movable walls. In 1954, the focus of Modern Products shifted toward office environments, in response to the development of modular office partitions. To reflect this new focus, the company changed its name to Modern Partitions By 1956, the business had annual revenues of $472,000 and a workforce of 50 employees, whom G.W. called ‚Äúmembers.‚Äù In 1961, G.W.‚Äôs teenage son, Dick Haworth, began working at the family business, sweeping floors and operating plant machinery. By 1964, he was an assistant sales manager, and within two years he was promoted to vice president for research and development. When he left in 1966 to serve in the U.S. Army, the company had 90 employees and annual sales of $2 million. When Dick returned from his military service in 1969, he assumed responsibility for manufacturing and new product development. His goal was to produce a new type of office furniture ‚Äî the office module system.\\"Lifetime Achievement Dick Haworth\\" Grand Rapids Business Journal, 2002-6-21 ‚ÄúMy father ended up going to a hardware store, getting a lot of bits and pieces and dumping them on a table ‚Äî and inventing the prewired partition.

In 1971, Dick introduced the Modern Office Modules (MOM) system and significantly altered the company's direction.\\"So, who is Dick Haworth?\\"(video), Interior Design Magazine, 2015-9-14 Sales grew to $6 million the following year. In 1976, Dick, then 33, took over for his dad as president and CEO. G.W.‚Äôs role shifted to board chairman. Under Dick's leadership, the company's name changed to Haworth. He grew the company by 400 percent over the next 20 years. The company focused exclusively on contract office furniture and sold its partition and movable-wall business to Trendway. Dick patented the first cubicle wall panels with internal wiring.Dukcevich, David (2000) \\"Richard Haworth Prefers Not To Take Stock\\", Forbes.com, September 29, 2000.

The top-selling panels, called Uni-Group, could be easily snapped together and eliminated the client's need to pay electricians to wire office spaces. In 1977, Haworth International Inc. was formed to set up foreign licenses for the manufacture and marketing of office interior systems. A year later, Haworth opened a national showroom in Chicago's Merchandise Mart. =1980‚Äì2000: Rapid rise and expansion= During the next two decades, Haworth developed several industry firsts ‚Äî from the first mobile office system to panel-to-panel cabling systems. Haworth also earned awards for its business and design practices, such as environmental sustainability, leadership, community service, and member job satisfaction. Under Dick's leadership, the company grew at twice the industry average.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 39. St. James Press, 2001 By 1980, Haworth had 830 employees and annual sales of $67 million. A year later, the company moved to its headquarters to One Haworth Center in Holland. Showrooms were open or renovated in 18 North American cities and four international locations. In the early 1980s, when office seating was added to Haworth product offering being built at the Holland, Michigan Haworth Plant, the company continued its movement toward providing complete workspace solutions. By 1986, Haworth had become the third- largest office furniture manufacturer in the U.S., with sales topping $300 million and a workforce of 2,600 employees. Along with the popular panels, products include office chairs, filing cabinets, and fabrics. Later in the 1980s, Haworth pursued an aggressive expansion in North America, Europe, and Asia. In 1988, Haworth became a global company, undertaking a strategic expansion.\\"\\"Dick Haworth tells story of his family business\\" MLive.com 2010-11-3 The business acquired 15 companies in Europe and North America, then built in Asia to expand its sales and dealer network.

It means we have high- quality jobs in all of the markets that we are involved in.‚Äù The company grew dramatically in the 1990s with the acquisition office and business furniture makers around the globe such as Mueller Furniture Co., Kinetics, and Lunstead. Haworth almost quadrupled in size in the early 1990s, while the percentage of income spent on sales, administrative, and other expenses went down significantly. By 1990, Haworth had 4,240 employees and $600 million in sales. The next year, it reorganized into four regions: North America, Europe, the Middle East/Africa, and the Asia Pacific & Central America/South America. In 1992, Dick's son, Matthew Haworth, formally joined the team as a dealer associate ‚Äî the same year Haworth became the first furniture manufacturer to achieve ISO 9001 certification. Haworth reached $1 billion in annual revenue in 1994. In 1995, the company's Ideation Group formed, applying user-based research to breakthrough concepts and products such as Crossings, Irrigator, Flo, Eddy, Drift, and Wake. That same year, 30 percent of sales come from overseas. In 1996 competitor Steelcase was found at fault in a patent infringement suit brought by Haworth in 1985. Steelcase was ordered to pay $211.5 million in damages and interest. In 1997, manufacturing expanded with production at its Shanghai plant. Over a 10-year period, the company acquired 25 companies in Europe, North America, and Asia. Dick Haworth developed a lengthy process of getting to know possible acquisition targets. He explained his system in an article he authored for the January/February 1995 Mergers & Acquisitions magazine, detailing how his firm sometimes worked for five or six years with companies it hoped to buy, moving cautiously toward formal acquisition talks. For Haworth, the long period of getting to know the target company paid off. =2000 to Present: a global focus= In 2000, Haworth passed the $2 billion mark in annual revenues.

(; 8 October 1850 ‚Äì 17 September 1936) was a French chemist of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He devised Le Chatelier's principle, used by chemists and chemical engineers to predict the effect a changing condition has on a system in chemical equilibrium. Early life Le Chatelier was born on 8 October 1850 in Paris and was the son of French materials engineer Louis Le Chatelier and Louise Durand. His father was an influential figure who played important roles in the birth of the French aluminium industry, the introduction of the Martin- Siemens processes into the iron and steel industries, and the rise of railway transportation. Le Chatelier's father profoundly influenced his son's future. Henry Louis had one sister, Marie, and four brothers, Louis (1853‚Äì1928), Alfred (1855‚Äì1929), George (1857‚Äì1935), and Andr√© (1861‚Äì1929). His mother raised the children by regimen, described by Henry Louis: \\"I was accustomed to a very strict discipline: it was necessary to wake up on time, to prepare for your duties and lessons, to eat everything on your plate, etc. All my life I maintained respect for order and law. Order is one of the most perfect forms of civilization.\\"L. Guillet, R√©vue de m√©tallurgie, special edition, January 1937 As a child, Le Chatelier attended the Coll√®ge Rollin in Paris. At the age of 19, after only one year of instruction in specialized engineering, he followed in his father's footsteps by enrolling in the √âcole Polytechnique on 25 October 1869. Like all the pupils of the Polytechnique, in September 1870, Le Chatelier was named second lieutenant and later took part in the Siege of Paris. After brilliant successes in his technical schooling, he entered the √âcole des Mines in Paris in 1871. Le Chatelier married Genevi√®ve Nicolas, a friend of the family and sister of four fellow students of the Polytechnique. They had seven children, four girls and three boys, five of whom entered scientific fields; two died preceding Le Chatelier's death. Career Despite training as an engineer, and even with his interests in industrial problems, Le Chatelier chose to teach chemistry rather than pursue a career in industry. In 1887, he was appointed head of the general chemistry to the preparatory course of the √âcole des Mines in Paris. He tried unsuccessfully to get a position teaching chemistry at the √âcole polytechnique in 1884 and again in 1897. Biblioth√®que de La Sorbonne, NuBIS) At the Coll√®ge de France, Le Chatelier succeeded Sch√ºtzenberger as chair of inorganic chemistry. Later he taught at the Sorbonne university, where he replaced Henri Moissan. At the Coll√®ge de France, Le Chatelier taught: :*Phenomena of combustion (1898) :*Theory of chemical equilibria, high temperature measurements and phenomena of dissociation (1898‚Äì1899) :*Properties of metal alloys (1899‚Äì1900) :*Iron alloys (1900‚Äì1901) :*General methods of analytical chemistry (1901‚Äì1902) :*General laws of analytical chemistry (1901‚Äì1902) :*General laws of chemical mechanics (1903) :*Silica and its compounds (1905‚Äì1906) :*Some practical applications of the fundamental principles of chemistry (1906‚Äì1907) :*Properties of metals and some alloys (1907) After four unsuccessful campaigns (1884, 1897, 1898 and 1900), Le Chatelier was elected to the Acad√©mie des sciences (Academy of Science) in 1907. He was also elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1907. In 1924, he became an Honorary Member of the Polish Chemical Society. Scientific work In chemistry, Le Chatelier is best known for his work on his principle of chemical equilibrium, Le Chatelier's principle, and on varying solubility of salts in an ideal solution. He published no fewer than thirty papers on these topics between 1884 and 1914. His results on chemical equilibrium were presented in 1884 at the Acad√©mie des sciences in Paris. Le Chatelier also carried out extensive research on metallurgy and was one of the founders of the technical newspaper La revue de m√©tallurgie (Metallurgy Review). Part of Le Chatelier's work was devoted to industry. For example, he was a consulting engineer for a cement company, the Soci√©t√© des chaux et ciments Pavin de Lafarge, today known as Lafarge Cement. His 1887 doctoral thesis was dedicated to the subject of mortars: Recherches exp√©rimentales sur la constitution des mortiers hydrauliques (Experimental Research on the Composition of Hydraulic Mortars). Le Chatelier in 1901 attempted the direct combination of the two gases nitrogen and hydrogen at a pressure of 200 atm and 600 ¬∞C in the presence of metallic iron. An air compressor forced the mixture of gases into a steel Berthelot bomb, where a platinum spiral heated them and the reduced iron catalyst.4\\\\. \\"Henri Le Chatelier: His Publications,\\" Ceram. Abs., 16, (Oct., 1937) A terrific explosion occurred which nearly killed an assistant. Le Chatelier found that the explosion was due to the presence of air in the apparatus used. And thus it was left for Haber to succeed where several noted French chemists, including Thenard, Sainte Claire Deville and even Berthelot had failed. Less than five years later, Haber and Claude were successful in producing ammonia on a commercial scale, acknowledging that the account of Le Chatelier's failed attempt had accelerated their research. Near the end of his life, Le Chatelier wrote, \\"I let the discovery of the ammonia synthesis slip through my hands. It was the greatest blunder of my scientific career‚Äù. =Le Chatelier's principle= Le Chatelier's Principle states that a system always acts to oppose changes in chemical equilibrium; to restore equilibrium, the system will favor a chemical pathway to reduce or eliminate the disturbance so as to restabilize at thermodynamic equilibrium. Put another way, > If a chemical system at equilibrium experiences a change in concentration, > temperature or total pressure, the equilibrium will shift in order to > minimize that change. This qualitative law enables one to envision the displacement of equilibrium of a chemical reaction. For example: a change in concentration of a reaction in equilibrium for the following equation: :N2(g) + 3H2(g) ‚áå 2NH3(g) If one increases the pressure of the reactants, the reaction will tend to move towards the products to decrease the pressure of the reaction. However consider another example: in the contact process for the production of sulfuric acid, the second stage is a reversible reaction: :2SO2(g) + O2(g) ‚áå 2SO3(g) The forward reaction is exothermic and the reverse reaction is endothermic. Viewed by Le Chatelier's principle a larger amount of thermal energy in the system would favor the endothermic reverse reaction, as this would absorb the increased energy; in other words the equilibrium would shift to the reactants in order to remove the stress of added heat. For similar reasons, lower temperatures would favor the exothermic forward reaction, and produce more products. This works in this case, since due to loss of entropy the reaction becomes less exothermic as temperature increases; however reactions that become more exothermic as temperature increases would seem to violate this principle. His time in politics It was typical for scientists and engineers of the time to have a very scientific vision of the industry. In the first issue of La revue de m√©tallurgie, Le Chatelier published an article describing his convictions on the subject,H.L. Le Chatelier, \\"Role of Science in Industry\\" in La revue de m√©tallurgie, n¬∞1, 1904 page 1 to 10 discussing the scientific management theory of Frederick Winslow Taylor. In 1928, he published a book on Taylorism. Le Chatelier was politically conservative. In 1934, he published an opinion on the French forty-hour work week law in the Brussels publication Revue √©conomique internationale. However, in spite of certain anti-parliamentarian convictions, he kept away from any extremist or radical movements. His brother Alfred Le Chatelier, a former soldier, opened the Atelier de Glatigny in the rural area of Glatigny (Le Chesnay), near Versailles in 1897. The workshop made sandstone ceramics, high-quality porcelain and glassware. In 1901 the critic Henri Cazalis (alias Jean Lahor), listed the workshop as one of the best producers in France of Art Nouveau ceramics. Henry Louis Le Chatelier seems to have encouraged Alfred's workshop and assisted with experiments in the composition of porcelain and the reactions of quartz inclusions, and also designed a thermoelectric pyrometer to measure temperature in the kilns.

Acting career Glover's first acting job came playing Mr Sugden, the comically overbearing sports teacher in Ken Loach's film Kes (a job offered to him when Barry Hines, who wrote the film, suggested him to the director). Although untrained, Glover proved to be a skilled and flexible character actor, using techniques learnt during his wrestling career. His large bald head, stocky build, and distinctive voice, with his Yorkshire accent, garnered him many roles as tough guys and criminals. He played Bottom in A Midsummer Night's Dream (BBC TV, 1981) and had a recurring role in the classic sitcom Porridge as dim-witted prison inmate Cyril Heslop who, when accused of being illiterate, utters the memorable line \\"I read a book once! Green, it was.\\" He played Quilp in The Old Curiosity Shop, and lent his voice to a number of animated characters, including the \\"gaffer\\" of the \\"Tetley Tea Folk\\" in a long-running series of television advertisements for Tetley tea, the voice behind the advertising slogan \\"Bread wi' nowt taken out\\" for Allinson bread, and the voice of \\"Big Pig\\", the mascot for the long-running Now That's What I Call Music! album series, appearing on the TV adverts for Now 3, Now 4 and Now 5. He also appeared in An American Werewolf in London, The First Great Train Robbery, Jabberwocky, Alien 3, Leon the Pig Farmer and as General Douglas in a Bollywood hit 1942: A Love Story. He appeared seven times in Play for Today, in three of them as part of a recurring trio of Yorkshiremen: The Fishing Party, Shakespeare or Bust and Three for the Fancy. Glover's performance in Kes led to parts at the Royal Court Theatre, London, notably in Lindsay Anderson's The Changing Room (1971). A season with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company followed, where his roles included Charles the wrestler (and, drawing on his wrestling experience, the fight arranger) in As You Like It, and a robust Peter in Romeo and Juliet. For the Royal National Theatre he appeared in The Mysteries (as God, creating the world with the help of a real fork-lift truck), Saint Joan and Don Quixote. In the film Brannigan he claimed to have lost the only fight in his acting career, fighting John Wayne. His performance in The Mysteries secured additional work in the commercial theatre. The Canterbury Tales (\\"Chaucer wi' nowt taken owt\\")(West End) was followed by a return to television and the Play for Today series, both as writer and performer and, in turn, more screen roles. Glover wrote a horror themed episode of Theatre Box called Death Angel, which aired in 1981. He went on to play Lugg, the endearing rogue manservant to Albert Campion in the series Campion, and the role of a crook, Griffiths, in the Doctor Who story Attack of the Cybermen in 1985. He played Edouard Dindon in the original London cast of La Cage aux Folles. In 1991 he starred in the second episode of Bottom, in the episode \\"Gas\\", as the perpetually angry neighbour Mr Rottweiler. At the end of his life he acted in John Godber's rugby league comedy Up 'n' Under (1998). He was also the voice for the UNO Upholstery TV adverts in 1995 and 1996. Glover also wrote over 20 plays and short films. In 1982 he was a guest presenter in series six of Friday Night Saturday Morning, a late-night BBC chat show. Gravestone Personal life Glover was married twice, secondly to television producer Tara Prem, the daughter of TV actor Bakhshi Prem. He had two children, one daughter from his first marriage and one son from his second marriage. Glover developed a brain tumour and died in a London hospital on 24 July 1997. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London.

Growing up as part of her father's church choir in Halifax, Nova Scotia, White competed in local singing competitions as a teenager and later trained at the Halifax Conservatory of Music. In 1941 and 1944, she made her national and international debuts as a singer, receiving critical acclaim for her performances of both classical European music and African-American spirituals. White later completed tours throughout Europe, the Caribbean, and Central and South America. When vocal difficulties and cancer eventually contributed to her retirement in 1952, White settled in Toronto and subsequently taught young Canadian musicians such as Lorne Greene, Dinah Christie, Don Francks, Robert Goulet and Anne Marie Moss. One of White's final major public appearances was a special command performance for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1964. White was declared a person of national historic significance by the Government of Canada. Her original supporters in Nova Scotia went on to establish the Nova Scotia Talent Trust, awarding annual arts scholarships to both emerging and established local artists, and the government of Nova Scotia continues to award an annual Portia White Prize. In 2007, White was posthumously awarded a lifetime achievement award by the East Coast Music Association. Early life and family The alt=Photograph of the front of the New Horizons Baptist Church Portia May White was born June 24, 1911, in Truro, Nova Scotia, the third of 13 children born to Izie Dora (White) and William Andrew White. Her mother was a descendant of Black Loyalists in Nova Scotia, while her father was the son of former slaves from Virginia; he moved to Canada independently. William attended Acadia University in Nova Scotia, later becoming the first Black Canadian to graduate from Acadia with a Doctorate of Divinity. After World War I, the White family moved to Halifax, and William became the minister of Cornwallis Street Baptist Church. Many other members of Portia White's family went on to achieve distinction in Canadian political and cultural life, including her brothers Jack, a noted Canadian labour union leader; Bill, the first Canadian of African heritage to run for political office in Canada; and Lorne, a regular performer for television show Singalong Jubilee. White also became aunt to Senator Donald Oliver and political commentator Sheila White. Portia White began her musical career at the age of six as a choir member at Cornwallis Street Baptist Church, where her mother was also the musical director. As White grew older, she became the choir director and assisted with church fundraising by singing on her father's weekly radio show. In an interview later in life, White explained that her love of music and performing had developed early: > Nobody ever told me to sing, I was born singing. I think that if nobody had > ever talked to me, I wouldn't be able to communicate in any other way but by > singing. I was always bowing in my dreams and singing before people and > parading across the stage as a very little girl. As a teenager, White entered a local singing competition with her sister June, the pair performing an aria from Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor. They won first prize. Although White wanted to pursue a singing career, she could not afford professional training at the time. White entered Dalhousie University in 1929, studying to become a teacher. From the early 1930s she taught in Africville and Lucasville, two small Halifax communities that were predominately Black Nova Scotian, and during this time White was finally able to begin paying for vocal lessons. She competed regularly at the Halifax Music Festival, winning the Helen Kennedy Silver Cup in 1935, 1937 and 1938, until the festival organizers finally decided to award her the cup permanently. In 1939, White won a scholarship to continue her musical training at the Halifax Conservatory of Music with noted Italian baritone Ernesto Vinci, and Vinci taught her using the bel canto vocal style. White soon gave her first formal recital, and after the start of World War II she continued singing in concerts and radio shows. She won awards at provincial music festivals, and in mid-1941 she met Edith Read, a visiting headmistress from a Toronto school who offered to arrange new performing opportunities for White. Singing career and later life The alt=Photograph of an audience watching a performance inside the Eaton Auditorium In November 1941, with the support of Read, 30-year-old White made her national debut as a singer in Toronto at the Eaton Auditorium. She was favourably received by audiences, even receiving a career management offer from Oxford University Press the day after her performance. Despite encountering racism as she sought out new performance bookings, White subsequently toured across Canada, performing concerts at venues that included the Governor General's Rideau Hall residence. Portia White, c. 1945 White sang both classical European music and African-American spirituals, and works by Harry T. Burleigh were a constant part of her concert repertoire. Alongside English pieces, she performed music in Italian, German, French and Spanish, and White's three-octave range attracted critical acclaim. Hector Charlesworth's review in The Globe and Mail observed White's \\"pungent expression and beauty of utterance,\\" while a critic with the Toronto Evening Telegram said she had a \\"coloured and beautifully shaded contralto... It is a natural voice, a gift from heaven.\\" White was compared to noted American contralto Marian Anderson. After auditioning for Metropolitan Opera general manager Edward Johnson, White made her international debut in New York City in 1944, becoming the first Canadian to perform at New York's Town Hall performance space. The New York Times reported her performance as \\"remarkable,\\" and Paul Bowles of the New York Herald Tribune wrote that \\"White, contralto, showed the public... that she not only has a magnificent vocal instrument, but that she also has sufficient musicianship and intelligence to do what she wishes with it.\\" White went on to sing at many more concerts across the United States. The province of Nova Scotia and the city of Halifax provided new financial support for the rising star, purchasing a white fox cape for White to wear at performances. In 1945, she signed a contract with artist agency Columbia Concerts Incorporated. A three-month tour of Central and South America and the Caribbean followed in 1946, and she sang in France and Switzerland in 1948. White was the first Black Canadian concert singer to achieve international fame. Vocal problems, an exhausting itinerary, and an eventual diagnosis of breast cancer later contributed to White's early retirement from public singing in 1952, and she settled in Toronto, where she studied with sopranos Gina Cigna and Irene Jessner at the Royal Conservatory of Music. As a vocal instructor herself, White also went on to teach some of Canada's up-and-coming musical talent, and her students included singers Lorne Greene, Dinah Christie, Don Francks, Robert Goulet, Anne Marie Moss and Judith Lander. White appeared in Halifax for a few rare performances during the 50s; although she announced her intention to resume a full-time singing career, her return to the concert circuit never fully materialized. In 1964, she sang in a command performance for Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, at the opening of the Confederation Centre of the Arts in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. This was one of her last major concerts. White died in Toronto on February 13, 1968, aged 56. Legacy and honours In 1944, White's supporters in Nova Scotia formed the Nova Scotia Talent Trust to provide her with financial assistance for her singing career. The Trust went on to establish annual scholarships for other Nova Scotian artists, and continues to award the Portia White Award to artists who show \\"exceptional commitment and potential in voice.\\" The Nova Scotia provincial government also awards a Portia White Prize for \\"cultural and artistic excellence,\\" and the 1998 inaugural Portia White Prize was awarded to Nova Scotian poet George Elliott Clarke, White's great nephew. White has been declared a person of national historic significance by the Government of Canada, and she was featured in a special issue of Millennium postage stamps celebrating Canadian achievement. At the 2007 East Coast Music Awards, White was posthumously honoured with a Dr. Helen Creighton Lifetime Achievement Award. She is the namesake of Portia White Court, a Halifax street, as well as the Portia White Atrium in Citadel High School. In 2017, the Portia White Youth Award was established as part of the African Nova Scotian Music Awards. White has been the subject of Lance Woolaver's play Portia White: First You Dream (also known simply as Portia), Sylvia Hamilton's documentary Portia White: Think on Me, and George Elliott Clarke's book Portia White.

It was discovered on 20 May 1999, by Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico, United States. It is also a Mercury-crosser and the closest known binary system to the Sun with a perihelion of just 0.2 AU.  Orbit  The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.2‚Äì1.1 AU once every 6.18 months (188 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.69 and an inclination of 39¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. A first precovery was taken by 2MASS at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in 1998, extending the body's observation arc by one year prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro. As a potentially hazardous asteroid, it has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which corresponds to 5.4 lunar distances. On 25 May 2036, it will pass from Earth.  Numbering and naming  This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 10 September 2003. It was named from Mohegan legend, after Moshup, a giant who lived in the coastal areas of New England. The asteroid's companion is named Squannit, after the wife of Moshup and a medicine woman of the Makiawisug (little people). The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 27 August 2019 ().  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, the asteroid a characterized as a stony S-type asteroid. = Satellite = Simulated animation of the Moshup binary system. The simulation speed is approx. 12,000 times real-time. Moshup has a minor-planet moon orbiting it. The moon, named Squannit and designated , is approximately 360 metres in diameter, and orbits its primary in every 16 hours at a mean-distance of 2.6 kilometers. The presence of a companion was suggested by photometric observations made by Pravec and ≈†arounov√° and was confirmed by radar observations from Arecibo observations and announced on 23 May 2001 (also see below). Based on radar imaging, Squannit's dimensions are estimated to be meters. = Diameter and shape = Goldstone Collage of radar images taken at Arecibo in May 2019 According to radiometric observations from Arecibo Observatory, the asteroid has a mean diameter of 1.317 kilometers. The observations were taken from May 21‚Äì23, 2001, by Lance A. M. Benner, Steven J. Ostro, Jon D. Giorgini, Raymond F. Jurgens, Jean-Luc Margot and Michael C. Nolan. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts a diameter of 1.3 kilometers and derives an albedo 0.26 with an absolute magnitude of 16.5. The shapes of the two bodies and their dynamics are complex.NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory Asteroid Radar Research , retrieved May 3, 2007 With a dimension of approximately kilometers for a simple triaxial ellipsoid, the asteroid has an oblate shape, which is dominated by an equatorial ridge at the body's potential-energy minimum. This bizarre property of the equatorial region means that it is close to breakup: raising a particle a meter above the surface would put it into orbit. As seen in the image at above right, the gravitational effects between the moon and the asteroid create a gigantic mountain extending in the equatorial plane around the entire asteroid. It was the first asteroid to be described as \\"muffin-shaped\\",CBS News - Scientist: Asteroid To Return In 2036, which is now understood to be a very common shape for asteroids in critical rotation, including 101955 Bennu and 162173 Ryugu. = Lightcurves = During 19‚Äì27 June 2000, a rotational lightcurve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by Petr Pravec and Lenka ≈†arounov√° at Ond≈ôejov Observatory.

The distinction is particularly significant in two-party systems. In any case \\"third\\" is often used figuratively, as in \\"the third parties\\", where the intent, literally stated, is \\"the third and succeeding parties\\". For instance, in the United Kingdom a third party is a national political party, other than the Conservatives and Labour, which has at least one member in the House of Commons. From 1922 to 2015, Liberal Democrats and its predecessor Liberals was the third party. Since 2015, it is used for the Scottish National Party (SNP). In Scotland, SNP has been the dominant parliamentary party beginning with the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, with the Conservative the next largest party and Labour becoming Scotland's third party ever since. In the United States of America, there have been numerous \\"third parties\\". The largest since the mid-20th century are the Libertarian and Green Parties. In Canada provinces such as Ontario, Prince Edward Island and Quebec, nearly 50+ active political parties exist throughout the nation with several them both provincial and federal levels either did elected, formed or joined during cross-flooring. The term \\"third parties\\" is used mostly in countries with first-past-the-post voting systems, as those systems tend to create a two- party system, so that successful smaller parties are rare to stronger two- party systems like the United States. Countries using proportional representation give little advantage to the largest two parties, so they tend to elect many parties. Therefore, in those countries, three, four, or more political parties are usually elected to legislatures. In such parliamentary systems, coalitions often include smaller parties; since they may participate in a coalition government, there is not a sharp distinction with a 'major' party. In two-party systems, on the other hand, only the major parties have a serious chance of forming a government. Similarly, in presidential systems, third-party candidates are rarely elected president. e In some categorizations, a party needs to have a certain level of success to be considered a third party. Smaller parties that win only a very small share of the vote and no seats in the legislature often are termed minor or fringe parties.  Structural barriers to power  Third parties face an uphill battle in terms of electoral success due to incentives placed on voters by election algorithms. Even in instances where the potential supporter may align themselves most with a certain third party, in the face of overwhelming odds against impacting the election it makes more sense to just stay home or back a coalition party in compromise. These disincentives exist primarily in the United States perpetuating two-party rule and can be alleviated through adopting electoral reform measures in the form of voting system adaptations, which, predictably, are often backed by third parties and opposed by the primary parties. In some countries like the United States, parties with low win probability also face frequent exclusion from major debates and media coverage and denial of ballot access as well as hamstrung campaign budgets.  Canada  In Canada politics are similar to United Kingdom politics but it does instead have either one or occasionally two and three national and provincial third parties since last few decades in Canadian politics like the national New Democratic Party and most its provincial chapters, the national Green Party of Canada and some its provincial chapters, Quebec's the Parti Qu√©b√©cois since 2018, New Brunswick's the People's Alliance of New Brunswick since 2018, Ontario's the Ontario Liberal Party since 2018, Alberta's the Alberta Party since 2015, Manitoba's the Manitoba Liberal Party since 2016, and the Prince Edward Island Liberal Party since 2019.  United States  In U.S. politics, a third party is a political party other than the Democrats or Republicans, such as the Libertarians and Greens. The term \\"minor party\\" is also used in a similar manner. Such third political parties rarely win elections, as proportional representation is not used in federal or state elections, but only in some municipal elections. But however since 2018, Maine as become first state for adopted Majoritarian favor ranked-choice voting system to deduced spoiler effect nor vote splitting made under First-Past-The- Post system for both federal and primary elections, but not state elections due of their state's constitution only favor plural voting systems. A similar situation occurs with the presidential Electoral College, where Electoral College votes are often given the candidate who receives a plurality of the vote, thus bringing up accusations that certain third party presidential candidates are \\"spoiling\\" the election or splitting up segments of voters.  Parliamentary two-party systems  Third parties usually have little chance of forming a government or winning the position of head of government. Nevertheless, there are many reasons for third parties to compete. The opportunity of a national election means that attention will be paid to the positions of third parties. The larger parties might be forced to respond and adapt to their challenges, and often the larger parties copy ideas from them. Most third parties try to build their support to become one of the dominant parties, as the Labour Party in Britain and New Democratic Party in Canada did. In the Westminster system there is also the possibility of minority governments, which can give smaller parties strength disproportional to their support. Examples include the Irish Parliamentary Party which pushed for Home Rule in Ireland in the late 19th century. Challenging parties also usually appeal for votes on the basis that they will try to change the voting system to make it more competitive for all parties.

It sits at an elevation of . The population (est 2004) was 86,800, mostly ethnic Russians, Armenians and Azeris. As the terminus of the Trans-Caspian Railway, it was an important transportation center. History In 1717, Russian Prince Alexander Bekovich-Cherkassky landed and established a secret fortified settlement on this location, where the dry bed of a former mouth of the Amu-Darya River once emptied into the Caspian Sea. His intent was to march an army up this dry riverbed and conquer the Khanate of Khiva. The expedition failed, and the Russians abandoned the settlement for over 150 years. =Krasnovodsk= Railway station in Krasnovodsk, 1902 The same railway station in T√ºrkmenba≈üy in 2015 In 1869, the Russians invaded a second time.

The fort, Krasnovodsk, served as Imperial Russia's base of operations against Khiva and Bukhara, and the nomadic Turkmen tribes. The railway had originally begun from Uzun-Ada on the Caspian Sea, but the terminus was shifted north to the harbour at Krasnovodsk. It fell to the Red Army in February, 1920. On November 21, 1939 was formed Krasnovodsk Oblast with the administrative center in Krasnovodsk. The oblast was repeatedly liquidated and restored (January 23, 1947 liquidated; April 4, 1952 restored; December 9, 1955 liquidated; December 27, 1973 restored; August 25, 1988 eliminated). =T√ºrkmenba≈üy= Hotel Serdar in the Awaza tourist zone January 10, 1991 in the former Krasnovodsk region formed Balkan Region (May 18, 1992 - velayat) with the center in Balkanabat. In 1993, Krasnovodsk was renamed by President for Life Saparmurat Niyazov, after his self-proclaimed title T√ºrkmenba≈üy (\\"Leader of all Turkmen\\"). Second President of Turkmenistan Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow pledged, in July 2007, to invest one billion dollars into a project slated to turn T√ºrkmenba≈üy into a major tourist resort ‚Äì the center of the Awaza tourist zone with 60 modern hotels to be built along a stretch of the Caspian Sea shoreline.Avaza Tourist Zone around Turkmenbashi The T√ºrkmenba≈üy city has two modern hotels - T√ºrkmenbashi Hotel and Charlak Hotel and old soviet Hazar Hotel. In recent years, the city made large-scale reconstruction historic district, entrance roads, vital infrastructure. A new Turkish Park and the cascade of fountains. By the end of 2012 Magtymguly Avenue had been completely renovated, the new route merged with the city's waterfront Bahry Hazar, providing the west motorway junction Balyk√ßy double out of the city along the dike, paved across the Soymonov bay speed motorway Turkmenbashi Airport‚ÄîAwaza. In 2014, the Oilworkers Palace of Culture, which was built in 1951, was renovated. The city housed the State Service of Maritime and River Transport of Turkmenistan, part of the Government of Turkmenistan.  Administrative divisions  In July 2013 as part of the city of Turkmenbashi was created two etraps - Avaza Etrap and Kenar Etrap. In Avaza Etrap, an area of 9660 hectares and includes the national tourist zone Awaza, Turkmenbashi International Airport and a few small towns. In Kenar Etrap, an area of 7262 hectares, entered the main part of the city of Turkmenbashi and the territory of the village of Kenar.

He has also written several books on some of the more sordid events in the history of Bristol, his home town, as well as guides to rugby. He was nominated for the Booker Prize in 1971 for his first novel, Goshawk Squadron. After attending Cotham Grammar School, Robinson served in the Royal Air Force as a fighter plotter, during his National Service. He has a History degree from Cambridge University, where he attended Downing College, has worked in advertising in the UK and the US and as a broadcaster on radio and television. He was a qualified rugby referee for over thirty years and is a life member of Bristol Society of Rugby Referees. He was married in 1964.

The defining characteristic of a close vowel is that the tongue is positioned as close as possible to the roof of the mouth as it can be without creating a constriction. A constriction would produce a sound that would be classified as a consonant. The term \\"close\\" is recommended by the International Phonetic Association. Close vowels are often referred to as \\"high\\" vowels, as in the Americanist phonetic tradition, because the tongue is positioned high in the mouth during articulation. In the context of the phonology of any particular language, a high vowel can be any vowel that is more close than a mid vowel. That is, close-mid vowels, near-close vowels, and close vowels can all be considered high vowels.

A near-close vowel or a near-high vowel is any in a class of vowel sound used in some spoken languages. The defining characteristic of a near-close vowel is that the tongue is positioned similarly to a close vowel, but slightly less constricted. Other names for a near-close vowel are lowered close vowel and raised close-mid vowel, though the former phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as low as close-mid (sometimes even lower); likewise, the latter phrase may also be used to describe a vowel that is as high as close. Near-close vowels are also sometimes described as lax variants of the fully close vowels, though, depending on the language, they may not necessarily be variants of close vowels at all. It is rare for languages to contrast a near- close vowel with a close vowel and a close-mid vowel based on height alone. An example of such language is Danish, which contrasts short and long versions of the close front unrounded , near-close front unrounded and close-mid front unrounded vowels, though in order to avoid using any relative articulation diacritics, Danish and are typically transcribed with phonetically inaccurate symbols and , respectively. This contrast is not present in Conservative Danish, which realizes the latter two vowels as, respectively, close-mid and mid . It is even rarer for languages to contrast more than one close/near- close/close-mid triplet. For instance, Sotho has two such triplets: fully front and fully back . In the case of this language, the near-close vowels tend to be transcribed with the phonetically inaccurate symbols , i.e. as if they were close central. It may be somewhat more common for languages to contain allophonic vowel triplets that are not contrastive; for instance, Russian has one such triplet: * close central rounded , an allophone of between soft consonants in stressed syllables; * near-close central rounded , an allophone of between soft consonants in unstressed syllables; * close-mid central rounded , an allophone of after soft consonants.

The IPA divides the vowel space into thirds, with the close-mid vowels such as or and the open-mid vowels such as or equidistant in formant space between open or and close or . Thus a true mid front unrounded vowel can be transcribed as either a lowered (with a lowering diacritic) or as a raised (with a raising diacritic).

The \\"university\\" is not an educational institution: it is, in fact, a licensing and accreditation body that sets standards for schools operating in New York State, from pre-kindergarten through professional and graduate school, as well as for the practice of a wide variety of professions. The group of people who make decisions about and for USNY is known as the New York State Board of Regents.  History  The Board of Regents of the USNY was established by statute on May 1, 1784, to re-establish and oversee King's College as Columbia University - and any other colleges and academies incorporated in the state thereafter. On April 13, 1787, the legislature enacted a law that allowed individual educational institutions to have their own trustees (making Columbia a private institution) and gave the Regents broader responsibilities for overseeing education in New York. The new law empowered the Regents to \\"visit and inspect all the colleges, academies, and schools\\" in the state, award higher academic degrees, hold and distribute funds, and exercise other powers of a corporation. Early in the 19th century, the Regents established standards for incorporating private academies and colleges, including specifying the texts or subjects that academies must teach to qualify for state aid. Aid was restricted to those students who had passed local entrance examinations. To combat the problem of academies lowering their standards in order to attract students and get state aid, during the later nineteenth century the Regents developed and instituted educational standards for high schools statewide, through use of the Regents examinations and syllabi. The legislature gave the Regents responsibility for the New York State Library and New York State Museum in 1844 and 1845, respectively, and in 1889 and 1892 expanded the USNY's responsibilities significantly to include the incorporation and supervision of all libraries, museums, correspondence schools, and other educational institutions. An 1872 statute authorized the Regents to appoint examining and licensing boards in the state's medical schools, and in 1890 the Regents were given the exclusive power to license physicians. Also starting in 1890, the Secretary to the Board of Regents - then Melvil Dewey, also head of the State Library - supervised full-time inspectors of secondary schools, libraries, colleges, and other institutions reporting to the Regents. Starting in 1910, private trade schools were required to be licensed and inspected, and in 1923 licensing requirements were extended to correspondence schools operating in the state. In 1948, New York State established a system of support organizations known as Boards of Cooperative Educational Services (BOCES) across the state. The head of each BOCES, known as the District Superintendent, acts as the New York State Commissioner of Education's, and by extension, the Chancellor of the Board of Regents', field representative. =Regents College= A key former initiative of the Board of Regents, created to better bring higher education to New York State's nontraditional adult learners, was the Board of Regents' Regents External Degree Program, or REX, which became Regents College in 1984 and then the separate and independent Excelsior College in 1998-2001\\\\. This program was an outgrowth of the practice of giving World War II veterans school and college credit in recognition of their military education and experience. In 1963 the Regents introduced College Proficiency Examinations, now called Excelsior College Examinations (ECEs), initially to help teachers and nurses complete educational requirements. First named the \\"Regents External Degree Program,\\" it was established in 1971 with financial support from the Ford and Carnegie Foundations. Degrees could be granted based on a combination of college proficiency exams and classroom and correspondence courses, or on a variety of exams alone. The first degrees were conferred in 1972. This program became independent of the Education Department in 1991 but continued to be governed by the Board of Regents until 1998, at which time it fully separated from the Board of Regents to become a private, independent college. This was a scam thought up to protect the elite status of the university of the state of new york. Acdemic elites jealously guard their elite status because without it they couldn't even get a job flipping burgers at Mickey D. The school, prohibited by the terms of its \\"independence\\" agreement from continuing to use the name Regents College, adopted the name Excelsior College in 2001. Excelsior College is now a constituent member of USNY in the same way, and in only the same way, that other institutions of higher education (including private colleges) in New York State are. Like them, it has its own charter and Board of Trustees.  Current structure and functions  The Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York oversees USNY. The Board includes 17 members elected by the New York State Legislature for five-year terms. Thirteen of the Regents represent the state's 13 judicial districts (one appointed from each district), and four are at-large. The Regents serve without salary. USNY's affiliation and oversight are very broad. As a legal technicality, USNY includes all of the state's more than 7,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools; approximately 250 public and private colleges and universities; another approximately 250 proprietary (for-profit) schools; nearly 7,000 libraries; about 750 museums; all of the state's local historical societies; and 25 public broadcasting facilities. Also included in USNY are the State Archives; a special school for the blind and another special school for the deaf; as well as vocational rehabilitation and special education services. Additionally, USNY has the affiliation of, and oversight for, more than half a million professionals practicing in 58 licensed professions, ranging from accountancy to architecture to engineering to massage therapy to hair styling, as well as 200,000 public certified school teachers, counselors, and administrators. Certain education-related institutions (such as most museums) could exist in New York State without being part of USNY; however, as an example, most museums in New York State choose to be part of USNY (i.e., be chartered by the Board of Regents) in order to obtain tax-exempt nonprofit status and other benefits.About the University of the State of New York = Relationship to the state education department = The state Education Law makes the Regents the head of the New York State Education Department. The Regents select a Commissioner of Education who both runs the Education Department and is president - that is, chief executive officer - of the University. The Board of Regents also elects a chancellor from among its members, who presides over the Regents' meetings and appoints its committees. The New York State Education Department (NYSED) was created at the behest of former New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. USNY has, as a subordinate unit, NYSED, including NYSED's various administrative personnel ‚Äî furthermore, the various schools, colleges, libraries, museums, teachers, etc., of USNY form constituent units of USNY, whereas NYSED forms a constituent and subordinate component of USNY. USNY, through its Board of Regents, generally uses NYSED as a vehicle to carry out policy created by the Regents. In other words, USNY's Board of Regents generally creates policy, whereas NYSED generally administers policy and the BOCES' District Superintendents help facilitate the roll-out of that policy in the field. The New York State Legislature can also create some education policy; such statutory education policy would become official education policy that the Commissioner of Education would also be responsible for administering. = Regents examinations and diplomas = Regents Examinations, tests administered to high school students to demonstrate mastery of various subjects, were established by the Regents and first administered in 1865. The Regents of USNY have set standards by which students may earn various levels of Regents diplomas for high school performance. = Honorary degrees = USNY can also issue honorary degrees; the honorary degrees that can be issued come from an established list contained in Rules of the Board of Regents (\\"Regents Rules\\"). USNY also has the power to directly issue (as opposed to through some other institution) diplomas, certificates, and degrees. Today, for a variety of reasons, USNY directly issues diplomas to individuals meeting graduation requirements at several postsecondary institutions in New York State.  State University of New York  Not to be confused with USNY is the State University of New York (SUNY), which is one of New York State's systems of public higher education, the other being the City University of New York (CUNY). Like all colleges and universities in the state, the 64 SUNY and 23 CUNY campus units are all part of USNY. However, the power of SUNY and CUNY units to grant degrees exists by mandate of the State Legislature; a private college or university in New York State would be allowed to grant degrees by virtue of a charter granted by the USNY Board of Regents.

There are sixteen people in the line of succession to the Belgian throne. The monarch is considered to have acceded to the throne upon her/his taking of the oath as required by article 91 of the constitution.  Eligibility  Since 1991, Belgium practises absolute primogeniture among the descendants of King Albert II (then Prince of Li√®ge). Descendants of earlier monarchs and princes are only eligible to succeed if male and descended from King Leopold I in male-line (i.e. according to agnatic primogeniture), meaning that descendants of all Belgian princesses not descended from Albert II are barred from the throne. There are no living princes of Belgium who are not descended from Albert II, so agnatic primogeniture de facto doesn't apply to anyone anymore and the right to succeed is effectively limited to Albert II's descendants. A person is deprived of his or her rights to the crown if he or she marries without the consent of the monarch (or the consent of those exercising the monarch's powers). The lost right may be re-established by the monarch (or by those exercising the monarch's powers) in the event of parliamentary agreement.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 85 Should there be no eligible descendant of King Leopold I, the reigning monarch may name his or her heir presumptive with the approval of the Parliament, but if she or he doesn't name the heir presumptive, the throne would eventually become vacant.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 86 In the case of a vacancy, Parliament would appoint a Regent (see below), then elections would happen within two months, and the next Houses of Parliament would jointly appoint the next monarch.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 95 When King Albert II's daughter Astrid married Archduke Lorenz of Austria-Este in 1984, agnatic primogeniture being in effect, she had no succession rights and therefore did not seek the consent to her marriage. Following the introduction of absolute primogeniture among her father's descendants in 1991, it was deemed that she had obtained the necessary consent and thus assumed her place in the line along with her children.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, title IX, section I When Prince Amedeo married in 2014, it was reported that he did not ask his uncle King Philippe's permission,http://www.hln.be/hln/nl/947/Royalty/article/detail/2406328/2015/07/28/Prins- Amedeo-niet-meer-troongerechtigd.dhtml and had therefore lost his right to the Belgian throne. However, on November 12, 2015, a Royal Decree was published which showed that consent had been given after the marriage retroactively. No head of a different state may become King (or Queen) of the Belgians, unless both Houses of Parliament separately agree to it, two-thirds of the Members being present in each House, and a two-thirds majority being required in each House.Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 87  Accession  Upon the King'sSo far.

There can only be one Regent. Belgian Constitution, coordinated 1994, 2005 version, art. 92-94 In other words, unlike in the Commonwealth, in Belgium there is an interregnum between each monarch's demise (usually by death, twice so far by abdication: Leopold III and Albert II) and his successor's accession (by taking the constitutional oath of office).

Castration anxiety is an overwhelming fear of damage to, or loss of, the penis‚Äîone of Sigmund Freud's earliest psychoanalytic theories.Schwartz, Bernard J. (1955) The measurement of castration anxiety and anxiety over loss of love. Journal of Personality, 24 204-219. Although Freud regarded castration anxiety as a universal human experience, few empirical studies have been conducted on the topic. The theory is that a child has a fear of damage being done to their genitalia by the parent of the same sex (e.g. a son being afraid of his father) as punishment for sexual feelings toward the parent of the opposite sex (e.g. a son toward his mother).Farlex Partner Medical Dictionary 2012 It has been theorized that castration anxiety begins between the ages of 3 and 5, otherwise known as the phallic stage of development according to Freud.Feiner, K. (1988) A test of a theory about body integrity: Part 2. Psychoanalytic Psychology. 5(1), 71‚Äì79. Although typically associated with males, castration anxiety is theorized to be experienced in differing ways for both the male and female sexes. Literal Castration anxiety is the conscious or unconscious fear of losing all or part of the sex organs, or the function of such. In the literal sense, castration anxiety refers to the fear of having one's genitalia disfigured or removed to punish sexual desires of a child. In Freudian psychoanalysis, castration anxiety (Kastrationsangst) refers to an unconscious fear of penile loss originating during the phallic stage of psychosexual development and lasting a lifetime. According to Freud, when the infantile male becomes aware of differences between male and female genitalia he assumes that the female's penis has been removed and becomes anxious that his penis will be cut off by his rival, the father figure, as punishment for desiring the mother figure.Freud, S. (1954). The Origins Of Psycho-Analysis: Letters To Wilhelm Fliess, Drafts And Notes: 1887-1902. Edited by Marie Bonaparte, Anna Freud, Ernst Kris. Translated by Eric Mosbacher and James Strachey. New York: Basic Books. In 19th-century Europe, it was not unheard of for parents to threaten their misbehaving sons with castration or otherwise threaten their genitals. This theme is explored in the story Tupik by French writer Michel Tournier in his collection of stories entitled Le Coq de Bruy√®re (1978) and is a phenomenon Freud documents several times.Freud, Sigmund. \\"The Dissolution of the Oedipus Complex.\\" On Sexuality. Vol. 7 of Penguin Freud Library. Trans. James Strachey. Ed. Angela Richards. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1976. 313-322. In this same period, Dr. Kellogg and others in America and English-speaking countries offered to Victorian parents circumcision and in grave instances, castration of their boys and girls as a terminal cure and punishment for a wide variety of perceived misbehaviours (such as masturbation), becoming very popular over time. Metaphorical Castration anxiety can also refer to being castrated symbolically. In the metaphorical sense, castration anxiety refers to the idea of feeling or being insignificant; there is a need to keep one's self from being dominated; whether it be socially or in a relationship.Sarnoff, I., & Corwin S.M., (1959) Castration anxiety and the fear of death. Journal of Personality, 27(3), 374. Symbolic castration anxiety refers to the fear of being degraded, dominated or made insignificant, usually an irrational fear where the person will go to extreme lengths to save their pride and/or perceives trivial things as being degrading making their anxiety restrictive and sometimes damaging. This can also tie in with literal castration anxiety in fearing the loss of virility or sexual dominance. Relation to power and control According to Freudian psychoanalysis, castration anxiety can be completely overwhelming to the individual, and can often breach other aspects of their lives. A link has been found between castration anxiety and fear of death. Although differing degrees of anxiety are common, young men who felt the most threatened in their youth tended to show chronic anxiety. Because the consequences are extreme, the fear can evolve from potential disfigurement to life-threatening situations. Essentially, castration anxiety can lead to a fear of death, and a feeling of loss of control over one's life. To feel so powerless can be detrimental to an individual's mental health. One of the most concerning problems with all of this is the idea that the individual does not recognize that their sexual desires are the cause of the emotional distress. Because of unconscious thoughts, as theorized in the ideas of psychoanalysis, the anxiety is brought to the surface where it is experienced symbolically. This will lead to the fear associated with bodily injury in castration anxiety, which can then lead to the fear of dying or being killed. Counterpart in females It is implied in Freudian psychology that both girls and boys pass through the same developmental stages: oral, anal, and phallic stages. Freud, however, believed that the results may be different because the anatomy of the different sexes is different. The counterpart of castration anxiety for females is penis envy. Penis envy, and the concept of such, was first introduced by Freud in an article published in 1908 titled \\"On the Sexual Theories of Children\\". The idea was presumed that females/girls envied those (mostly their fathers) with a penis because theirs was taken from them‚Äîessentially they were already \\"castrated\\". Freud entertained that the envy they experienced was their unconscious wish to be like a boy and to have a penis.Fancher, Raymond E. & Rutherford, Alexandra Pioneers of Psychology, W.W. Norton & Company, Inc. New York, London. 2012 Penis envy, in Freudian psychology, refers to the reaction of the female/young girl during development when she realizes that she does not possess a penis. According to Freud, this was a major development in the identity (gender and sexual) of the girl. The contemporary culture assumes that penis envy is the woman wishing they were in fact a man. This is unrelated to the notion of \\"small penis syndrome\\" which is the assumption by the man that his penis is too small. According to Freud's beliefs, girls developed a weaker superego, which he considered a consequence of penis envy. Among his many suggestions, Freud believed that during the phallic stage, young girls distance themselves from their mothers and instead envy their fathers and show this envy by showing love and affection towards their fathers. According to Cohler and Galatzer, Freud believed that all of the concepts related to penis envy were among his greatest accomplishments. However, these are also his most criticized theories as well‚Äîmost famously by Karen Horney. Empirical testing Sarnoff et al. surmised that men differ in their degree of castration anxiety through the castration threat they experienced in childhood. Therefore, these men may be expected to respond in different ways to different degrees of castration anxiety that they experience from the same sexually arousing stimulus. The experimenters aimed to demonstrate that in the absence of a particular stimulus, men who were severely threatened with castration, as children, might experience long- lasting anxiety. The researchers claimed that this anxiety is from the repressed desires for sexual contact with women. It was thought that these desires are trying to reach the men's consciousness. The experimenters deduced that unconscious anxiety of being castrated might come from the fear the consciousness has of bodily injury. The researchers concluded that individuals who are in excellent health and who have never experienced any serious accident or illness may be obsessed by gruesome and relentless fears of dying or of being killed. In another article related to castration anxiety, Hall et al. investigated whether sex differences would be found in the manifestations of castration anxiety in their subject's dreams.Hall, C., & van de Castle, R. L. \\"An empirical investigation of the castration complex in dreams\\", Journal of Personality, 1965, 33(1), 20. The researchers hypothesized that male dreamers would report more dreams that would express their fear of castration anxiety instead of dreams involving castration wish and penis envy. They further hypothesized that women will have a reversed affect, that is, female dreamers will report more dreams containing fear of castration wish and penis envy than dreams including castration anxiety. The results demonstrated that many more women than men dreamt about babies and weddings and that men had more dreams about castration anxiety than women.

It is usually a subset of the full executive cabinet of ministers. It is also quite common for a war cabinet to have senior military officers and opposition politicians as members. The War Cabinet is an English idea. When authority over the appointment of a Prime Minister shifted from the King to The House of Commons in 1782, coupled with the Reform Act of 1832, England entered the age of democracy.Britannica online, English democracy Consequently, the number of cabinet agencies began to grow. Due to dissatisfaction with the Crimean War in 1855, Prime Minister Disraeli proposed that the number of cabinet agencies never exceed 10 (he had 12 at the time). However, this didn't happen, and the number of agencies continued to grow: 15 in 1859, 21 in 1914, and 23 in 1916.Schuyler, The British War Cabinet, pg. 380 Despite talk of, \\"inner circles\\" within the Asquith Administration, all committees reported to the 23 cabinet heads, whose priorities were all civil and diverse in nature, and who had final say over war policy formation for the first two years of World War I. This cumbersome arrangement could not stand; a more efficient way of prosecuting the war was needed.  United Kingdom  = First World War = The 1916 War Cabinet The British War Cabinet During the First World War, lengthy cabinet discussions came to be seen as a source of vacillation in Britain's war effort. In December 1916 it was proposed that the Prime Minister H. H. Asquith should delegate decision-making to a small, three-man committee chaired by the Secretary of State for War, David Lloyd George. Asquith initially agreed (provided he retained the right to chair the committee if he chose) before changing his mind after being infuriated by a news story in The Times which portrayed the proposed change as a defeat for him. The political crisis grew from this point until Asquith was forced to resign as Prime Minister; he was succeeded by David Lloyd George who thereupon formed a small war cabinet. The original members of the war cabinet were:LeMay, British Government, pg. 233 *David Lloyd George *Lord Curzon of Kedleston (Lord President of the Council) *Bonar Law (Chancellor of the Exchequer) *Arthur Henderson (December 1916 ‚Äì August 1917) *Lord Milner (December 1916 ‚Äì April 1918) Lloyd George, Curzon and Bonar Law served throughout the life of the war cabinet. Later members included: *Jan Smuts (June 1917 ‚Äì January 1919) *George Barnes (May 1917 ‚Äì January 1919) *Edward Carson (July 1917 ‚Äì January 1918) *Austen Chamberlain (April 1918 ‚Äì October 1919) *Sir Eric Geddes (January 1919 ‚Äì October 1919) Unlike a normal peacetime cabinet, few of these men had departmental responsibilities ‚Äì Bonar Law, and then Chamberlain, served as chancellors of the exchequer, but the rest had no specific portfolio. The title of, \\"Minister Without Portfolio\\" was important. It allowed total devotion to war duties, without the distraction of civil cabinet responsibilities. Among others, the Foreign Secretary, Arthur Balfour, was never a member of the war cabinet, nor were the service ministers Lord Derby (Army) and Sir Edward Carson (Navy). The latter did join, but only after leaving the Admiralty. Whenever these specialties were needed, they were summoned. The legality of the war cabinet was brought into question in 1917. Previously, all cabinet members were paid based upon their cabinet status. With the creation of Ministers Without Portfolio, it was suggested that these positions go unpaid. Indeed, Lord Lansdowne, while a member without portfolio in Prime Minister Asquith's government, received no pay. The debate, which took place in the House of Commons on 13 February 1917, was decided in the new government's favor.Schuyler, Political Science Quarterly, pg. 384 Appropriations of ¬£5,000 a year (¬£350,000 in 2020) were made.CPI index The British War Cabinet marked the first time minutes were recorded of official meetings.UK Gov. blog, 9 December 1916 This innovation set the trend for all important corporate and governmental meetings since.UK National Archives, World War I war cabinet minutes The Imperial War Cabinet Imperial War Cabinet, 22 Mar 1917 Imperial War Cabinet, June 1918 From the spring (in the northern hemisphere) of 1917, the Imperial War Cabinet was formed. It's goal was to strengthen imperial federation by upgrading the status of the Dominions and India to an equal footing with that of England when coordinating war strategy. The Imperial War Cabinet met three times: from March to May of 1917, from June to August of 1918, and from October to December of 1918. Its original members included: * Arthur Henderson (British War Cabinet) * Lord Alfred Milner (British War Cabinet) * George Curzon (British War Cabinet) * Bonar Law (British War Cabinet & future Prime Minister) * Lloyd George (British War Cabinet & Prime Minister of Great Britain) * Robert Borden (Prime Minister of Canada) * W.F. Massey (Prime Minister of New Zealand) * Jan Smuts (Minister for Defence, South Africa) * S.P. Sinha (Representative of Bengal) * Maharajah of Bikanir (King of (Northern) India) * James Meston (Assistant to the Secretary of State for India, Great Britain) * Austen Chamberlain (Secretary of State for India, Great Britain) * Robert Cecil (Minister of Blockade, Great Britain) * Walter Long (Secretary of State for the Colonies, Great Britain) * Joseph Ward (Finance Minister of New Zealand) * George Perley (Overseas War Minister of Canada) * Robert Rogers (Minister of Public Works, Canada) * J.D. Hazen (Minister of the Navy, Canada) * Leopold Amery (Assistant Secretary from Great Britain) * Admiral Jellicoe (Admiral of the Navy, Great Britain) * Edward Carson (First Lord of the Admiralty (civilian head of the Navy), Great Britain) * Lord Derby (Secretary of State for War, Great Britain) * General Maurice (Director of Military Operations, Great Britain) * Maurice Hankey (Assistant Secretary from Great Britain) * Henry Lambert (Colonial Office, from Great Britain) * Major Storr (Assistant Secretary from Great Britain) To strengthen ties between countries, the writing of an Imperial Constitution was a significant priority in 1917. However, the delegates postponed the matter for another time, and they failed to take it up later. Minutes to the Imperial War Cabinet meetings are held at the National Archives (Kew), and are available online. =Second World War= Germany invaded Poland early on 1 September 1939, and after to-ing and fro-ing with French Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet, an ultimatum was presented to the Germans and on its expiry war was declared at 11am on 3 September 1939.  Chamberlain war ministry  On 3 September 1939, Neville Chamberlain announced his War Cabinet. *Prime Minister: Neville Chamberlain (Cons) *Lord Privy Seal: Sir Samuel Hoare (Cons) *Chancellor of the Exchequer: Sir John Simon (Nat. Liberal) *Foreign Secretary: Viscount Halifax (Cons) *Secretary of State for War: Leslie Hore-Belisha (Nat. Liberal) *Secretary of State for Air: Sir Kingsley Wood (Cons) *First Lord of the Admiralty: Winston Churchill (Cons) *Minister for the Coordination of Defence: Lord Chatfield (Nat.) *Minister without Portfolio: Lord Hankey (Nat. ) Dominated largely by Conservative ministers who served under Chamberlain's National Government between 1937 and 1939, the additions of Lord Hankey (a former Cabinet Secretary from the First World War) and Winston Churchill (strong anti-appeaser) seemed to give the Cabinet more balance. Unlike Lloyd George's War Cabinet, the members of this one were also heads of Government Departments. In January 1940, after disagreements with the Chiefs of Staff, Hore-Belisha resigned from the National Government, refusing a move to the post of President of the Board of Trade. He was succeeded by Oliver Stanley. It was originally the practice for the Chiefs of Staff to attend all military discussions of the Chamberlain War Cabinet. Churchill became uneasy with this, as he felt that when they attended they did not confine their comments to purely military issues. To overcome this, a Military Co-ordination Committee was set up, consisting of the three Service ministers normally chaired by Lord Chatfield. This together with the Service chiefs would co-ordinate the strategic ideas of 'top hats' and 'brass' and agree strategic proposals to put forward to the War Cabinet. Unfortunately, except when chaired by the Prime Minister, the Military Co- ordinating Committee lacked sufficient authority to override a Minister \\"fighting his corner\\". When Churchill took over from Chatfield, whilst continuing to represent the Admiralty, this introduced additional problems, and did little to improve the pre-existing ones. Chamberlain announced a further change in arrangements in the Norway debate, but this (and the Military Co-ordination Committee) was overtaken by events, the Churchill War Cabinet being run on rather different principles.Martin Gilbert, Finest Hour, Winston S Churchill 1939‚Äì1941, Book Club Associates, London 1983 page 40  Churchill war ministry  When he became Prime Minister during the Second World War, Winston Churchill formed a war cabinet, initially consisting of the following members: * Prime Minister & Minister of Defence: Winston Churchill (Conservative) * Lord President of the Council: Neville Chamberlain (Conservative) * Lord Privy Seal: Clement Attlee (Labour) * Foreign Secretary: Lord Halifax (Conservative) * Minister without Portfolio: Arthur Greenwood (Labour) Churchill strongly believed that the War Cabinet should be kept to a relatively small number of individuals to allow efficient execution of the war effort. Even so, there were a number of ministers who, though they were not members of the war cabinet, were \\"Constant Attenders\\".Winston Churchill, The Hinge of Fate, p.78. Boston, Houghton Mifflin 1950. As the War Cabinet considered issues that pertained to a given branch of the service or government due input was obtained from the respective body. The War Cabinet would undergo a number of changes in composition over the next five years. On 19 February 1942 a reconstructed War Cabinet was announced by Churchill consisting of the following members:Winston Churchill,The Hinge of Fate, p.76. Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company 1950. *Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Winston Churchill (Conservative) *Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Dominions Affairs: Clement Attlee (Labour) *Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons: Sir Stafford Cripps (Labour) *Lord President of the Council: John Anderson (National) *Foreign Secretary: Anthony Eden (Conservative) *Minister of Production: Oliver Lyttelton (Conservative) *Minister of Labour: Ernest Bevin (Labour) This War Cabinet was consistent with Churchill's view that members should also hold \\"responsible offices and not mere advisors at large with nothing to do but think and talk and take decisions by compromise or majority\\"Winston Churchill, The Hinge of Fate, p.75. Boston, Houghton Mifflin Company 1950.

Left to right: John Curtin, Sir Frederick Sheddon, Ben Chifley, 'Doc' Evatt, Norm Makin, Arthur Drakeford At the Imperial Conference in London in 1937, the Australian government had agreed to form a War Cabinet on the outbreak of war. The Full Cabinet approved the formation of the War Cabinet on 26 September 1939. As neither Earle Page's Country Party nor John Curtin's Australian Labor Party would join in a coalition government with Menzies' United Australia Party, the War Cabinet initially consisted of: * Robert Menzies (Prime Minister and Treasurer) * Richard Casey (Minister for Supply) * Geoffrey Street (Minister for Defence) * George McLeay (Minister for Commerce) * Henry Gullett (Minister for Information) * William Hughes (Attorney-General) In November 1939, the Department of Defence was split up. Street became Minister for the Army, Menzies also became Minister for Defence Coordination, and three more ministers joined the War Cabinet: * James Fairbairn (Minister for Air) * Frederick Stewart (Minister for the Navy) * Harry Foll (Minister for Interior) Following the deaths of Fairbairn, Stewart and Gullett in the Canberra air disaster, 1940 and the loss of seats in the 1940 Australian federal election the War Cabinet of October 1940 consisted of: * Robert Menzies (Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Coordination) * Arthur Fadden (Treasurer) * John McEwen (Minister for Air) * Percy Spender (Minister for the Army) * Billy Hughes (Attorney-General and Minister for the Navy) * Harry Foll (Minister for Interior) * Philip McBride (Minister for Munitions) (from 26 June 1941) The government was replaced by a Labor one on 3 October 1941. A new War Cabinet was formed, consisting of: * John Curtin (Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Coordination) * Frank Forde (Minister for the Army) * Ben Chifley (Treasurer) * H. V. Evatt (Attorney-General and Minister for External Affairs) * Jack Beasley (Minister for Supply) * Norman Makin (Minister for the Navy and Minister for Munitions) * Arthur Drakeford (Minister for Air) * John Dedman (Minister for the Interior) (from 11 December 1941) Frederick Shedden, the Permanent Secretary of the Department of Defence, served as secretary of the War Cabinet, which met regularly throughout the war. It held its last meeting in Canberra on 19 January 1946. While the Australian war cabinets included only members of the governing party, the Advisory War Council which was established in October 1940 included members of the opposition as well. This body did not have executive powers, but from the formation of the Labor Government in October 1941 it was agreed that its decisions would be treated as War Cabinet decisions, with only some issues being formally referred to the War Cabinet for separate decision. As a result, the Advisory War Council had significant influence on Australia's war effort. United States In response to the September 11 attacks, President George W. Bush created a War Cabinet. They met at Camp David on the weekend of 15 September to shape what became the War on Terrorism.

Dicion√°rio Liter√°rio Brasileiro. Rio de Janeiro: LTC, 1978. Career overview Carpeaux was born Otto Karpfen in 1900 in Vienna, Austria- Hungary, to a Jewish family, and lived there until 1939. At the age of 20, he enrolled at the University of Vienna to study Law. In 1925, he received a PhD in letters and philosophy and began working as a journalist. Later, he also studied exact sciences and mathematics in Leipzig, sociology and philosophy in Paris, comparative literature in Naples, and politics in Berlin. At some point in his life, Karpfen converted to Roman Catholicism, adding Maria to his name and using Fidelis as his surname for some time. This conversion was evident in his political books (such as Wege Nach Rom) and his thinking, and led to his participation in the right-wing government of Engelbert Dollfuss.Carvalho, Olavo de. \\"Introdu√ß√£o,\\" Ensaios Reunidos, 1942-1978, (Vol.1). Rio de Janeiro: UniverCidade Editora, 2005. When the Anschluss occurred and the Nazis took over Vienna, Carpeaux fled to Belgium.Kestler, Izabela Maria Furtado. Ex√≠lio e Literatura: Escritores de Fala Alem√£ durante a √âpoca do Nazismo, EdUSP, 2003. He stayed there for about a year and, at the break of the Second World War, he went to Brazil.Miguel, Salim. \\"Carpeaux Revisitado,\\" Di√°rio Catarinense, 20 de Maio de 2006. Carpeaux did not speak Portuguese at first, and he mastered the language on his own, eventually also frenchifying his lastname to \\"Carpeaux\\", considering that it would seem more prestigious among Brazilian intellectuals. At first, he was given a simple rural job, but he gradually established himself as a literary critic. His first published article was on Franz Kafka, on the newspaper Correio da Manh√£, something he did out of desperation when living under severe conditions. He was to introduce writers such as Robert Musil and Kafka to Brazilian audiences, along with the literary criticism of Wilhelm Dilthey, Benedetto Croce, Walter Benjamin and others. His first book in Portuguese came in 1942, A Cinza do Purgat√≥rio. Two years later, he became director of Funda√ß√£o Get√∫lio Vargas library. He also published essays on philosophers and sociologists such as Friedrich Engels and Max Weber, as well as on Brazilian writers he came to discover when in the country, writing on Carlos Drummond de Andrade e Graciliano Ramos. Perhaps the peak of Carpeaux's production was his eight-volume Hist√≥ria da Literatura Ocidental (History of Western Literature),Muggiati, Roberto. \\"Carpe Carpeaux!,\\" Gazeta do Povo, Janeiro de 2012. available only in Portuguese, in spite of being in public domain. Carpeaux took eight years to write his masterwork, from 1941 to 1947. Late critic Jos√© Lino Gr√ºnewald labelled it one of the brightest moments of the language in prose, despite the fact that Carpeaux was not a native speaker. It is also unique in that it focuses on creating links between all periods, in order to create an organic vision of the literary history he is telling. The book also include more than 8,000 brief criticisms and expositions of the majority of the figures discussed along the way, minus the ones cited in passing; all are dealt with in their original languages, both in expositions and quotations and in the bibliography offered. The total bibliographical amount of cited works is on the merge of 30,000 books or more. In this series, Carpeaux begins with an analysis of classical Greek and Latin literatures and proceeds until the twentieth century avant-garde movements such as surrealism and dadaism, encompassing every major literary establishments in between. For this reason, it has been called \\"definitive, encyclopaedic and multidisciplinary, a fundamental work in Brazilian literary and cultural bibliography\\". To Antonio Candido, Carpeaux's \\"universal vision allows him to surmount the eventual limitations of critic nacionalism, whose historic function is important in certain moments, but which must not serve to obliterate the true dimension of the literary phenomena, which, through its own nature, is transcendental as well as national. Carpeaux demonstrates in other moments how Brazilian literature benefits from being seen in a double perspective, such as his, capable of increasing insight and break routine.\\" Never abandoning his abomination to militarism and tyranny, Carpeaux opposed to the Brazilian Military Regime and abandoned his literary writings by 1968, in order to participate more actively on political debate. However, he did participate in the composition of an encyclopedia called Mirador. He maintained his convictions as a right-wing thinker, and died of a heart attack in 1978. Recently, his essays have been compiled by Brazilian journalist Olavo de Carvalho,Guimar√£es, J. C. \\"O Destino de Otto Maria Carpeaux,\\" Revista Bula, Dezembro de 2008. with an added introduction. Critic Mauro Souza Ventura released De Karpfen a Carpeaux, a study in the life and work of Carpeaux. Carpeaux's other works include a dense history of German literature, several books of literary criticism, a popular history of Western music and various political writings. Works * (1942).

Davis also spent multiple seasons as a third baseman and center fielder, and lesser amounts of time at other positions. He broke into the major leagues in 1890 and played through 1909. He is ranked among the top 100 players of all-time in several statistical categories. Davis was a switch hitter. After his playing career, Davis managed the Amherst College baseball team for several years. He died in a mental institution, suffering the effects of syphilis. Not much was known about Davis's life or career until the 1990s, when he gained some recognition from the city historian of his hometown of Cohoes, New York. He was elected to the Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee in 1998. Early life Born on August 23, 1870 in Cohoes, New York, Davis was one of seven children born to Abram and Sarah Davis. His father had immigrated from Wales and his mother came from England. Davis was playing amateur baseball in Albany when he was 16 years old and he could bat from both sides of the plate. By 1889, Davis was on a team of semiprofessional and amateur players near the Hudson River in Albany. The squad was managed by Tom York, a former major league player. York recommended Davis for major league service with the Cleveland Spiders. The team signed Davis for the 1890 season. Early playing career Davis patrolled center field for the first two seasons of his career, leading the National League (NL) in outfield assists with 35 in 1890. He made three brief appearances as a pitcher in 1891, giving up seven earned runs in four innings and recording one save. That year he was among the league's top ten players in hits, doubles, triples, total bases, runs batted in (RBI), plate appearances and assists as an outfielder. Davis never appeared as a pitcher again, but his strong arm did lead the team to move him to third base in 1892, a position he played for the next five seasons. His batting average dropped almost 50 points to .241 in 1892, but he recorded 82 RBI and 36 stolen bases. New York Giants The Spiders traded Davis to the New York Giants for aging star Buck Ewing shortly before the 1893 season, and Davis blossomed in New York City. With league rules moving the pitcher's mound back to 60 feet, 6 inches that season, offensive totals jumped across the league, and Davis was at the forefront of the surge. He compiled a .355 batting average and set career highs with 27 triples and 11 home runs. He also collected 22 doubles and 37 stolen bases, while scoring 112 runs and driving in 119. He became the first player to hit a triple and a home run in the same inning. George Davis baseball card (1909‚Äì1911) Davis continued to perform at an elite level throughout the 1890s, regularly ranking among the league leaders in doubles, triples, RBI, and stolen bases. He had a batting average of more than .300 for nine consecutive seasons beginning in 1893. He began playing more shortstop in 1896 and moved to the position full-time the next season. In 1897, Davis hit .353 and registered a league-best 135 RBI. He led the league in double plays and fielding percentage four times each. During his playing career, Davis enjoyed a reputation as an intelligent and hard- working player who did not participate in dirty play. On their way to practice at the Polo Grounds on April 26, 1900, Davis and teammates Kid Gleason and Mike Grady stumbled upon a raging tenement fire. The players rushed into the building and rescued two women and a three-year-old child. The fire left 45 families homeless. Davis said, \\"I didn't do much. I just went up the ladder the same as the rest of the boys and helped to carry down women and children... I didn't do half as much as Grady and Gleason.\\" His face blistered from the heat, Davis helped his team earn a 10‚Äì10 tie with the Boston Beaneaters that evening. Later career The formation of the American League provided new financial opportunities to ballplayers, and induced by a $4,000 salary, Davis jumped to the Chicago White Sox in 1902. He attempted a return to the Giants the following season for a further raise to $6,700 (the second- highest figure in the league, after that of Nap Lajoie), but was prevented by the implementation of a peace agreement between the warring leagues. Davis sat out the bulk of the season before returning to the White Sox, with whom he spent the remainder of his career. His raw offensive statistics from this time pale before those of his earlier career, but when properly compared to a drastic league-wide decline in offense, they remain impressive. Davis stole home in Game 5 of the 1906 World Series for the champion White Sox. He also had three runs batted in for the Sox in the title-clinching Game 6 against the crosstown Chicago Cubs. His decline began for real in , though, and he retired after the season. His career totals in several statistical categories rank in the top 100 players all-time, including games played, at bats, hits, runs, doubles, triples, RBI and stolen bases. Later life Davis returned to the minor leagues for one season as player-manager of the 1910 Des Moines Boosters. He managed a bowling alley in the early 1910s. He was the Amherst College baseball coach from 1913 to 1918, then he became a car salesman. The circumstances of his death remained a mystery until baseball historian Lee Allen discovered its details through a campaign to track down historical baseball players, run in part in The Sporting News. Davis was admitted to a Philadelphia mental institution in 1934 suffering from paresis due to tertiary syphilis. He died in the institution in 1940. Davis was survived by his wife Jane, who was said to have been angry at him when he died. They had no children. His wife spent $41 to have him buried within a day at nearby Fernwood Cemetery. Legacy In a 1995 book, baseball author Bill James referred to Davis as baseball's best player who had not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Also in 1995, Davis was featured in David Pietrusza's television film Local Heroes in the segment \\"Knocking on Cooperstown's Door.\\" In 1997, baseball researcher Frederick Ivor-Campbell said that Davis was \\"the most neglected player of the 19th century. He's definitely the best eligible player not in the Hall, and he's a lot better than a lot of guys already in.\\" Around the same time, Davis was rated the 21st best baseball player of all time in the official baseball encyclopedia, Total Baseball. Davis was up for a vote before the Hall of Fame's Veterans Committee in 1998. Before the committee voted, sportswriter Dave Anderson wrote an article in The New York Times on Davis's Hall of Fame candidacy. He pointed out the work of Cohoes city historian Walt Lipka, which favorably compared Davis to almost all of the shortstops in the Hall of Fame. Anderson supported Davis's election, saying, \\"It's as if he were discarded nearly a century ago into a time capsule that was forgotten until now... For too long, George Stacey Davis has been his era's most forgotten best player.\\" He was selected for induction that year. Prior to his Hall of Fame induction, a Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) chapter in New York put out a call to locate a descendant of Davis to be present at the induction ceremony and announced plans for a historical marker in Cohoes. As a great deal of time had passed since his death, no relatives could be located, but a group of about 50 people from Cohoes traveled to the ceremony in support of Davis.

Wrigley which existed from 1943 to 1954. The AAGPBL is the forerunner of women's professional league sports in the United States. Over 600 women played in the league, which consisted of eventually 10 teams located in the American Midwest. In 1948, league attendance peaked at over 900,000 spectators. The most successful team, the Rockford Peaches, won a league-best four championships. The 1992 motion picture A League of Their Own is a mostly fictionalized account of the early days of the league and its stars. Founding and play All-American Girls Professional Baseball League members performing calisthenics in alt= With the entry of the United States into World War II, several major league baseball executives started a new professional league with women players in order to maintain baseball in the public eye while the majority of able men were away. The founders included Philip K. Wrigley, Branch Rickey, and Paul V. Harper. They feared that Major League Baseball might even temporarily cease due to the war because of the loss of talent, as well as restrictions on team travel due to gasoline rationing. The women's initial tryouts were held at Wrigley Field in Chicago. Scouted from amateur softball games across the country, over 200 women were invited to try- out, and about 60 were selected for the league roster. Like the male major- league, the 'girls' league was also informally segregated, thus no African Americans were recruited or hired. Women were selected for their skilled play, but the player also needed to fit what was seen by marketers as a wholesome feminine ideal. The first league game was played on May 30, 1943. Scouts for the Chicago-based All-American Girls Professional Baseball League initially sought and recruited talent from the Chicago softball Metropolitan League, among with several others. However, after seeing many of their players leave for the AAGPL, it was decided to then turn the amateur Metropolitan League to a professional league. The result was the creation of the six-team National Girls Baseball League, which began in 1944, composed entirely of Chicago-area teams. The National Girls baseball League was founded by Emery Parichy, Charles Bidwill, owner of the Chicago Cardinals football team and politician Ed Kolski. Pirachy operated the Metropolitan League. Football star Red Grange was hired to preside over the league. The NGBL was much less publicized than the AAGPL, but it paralleled the AAGPL, as it also lasted until 1954 and drew up to 500,000 fans per season. For a time, the two leagues were involved in a strong rivalry for players, before meeting and calling a poaching truce in 1946. Many players and several managers appeared in both leagues.https://sabr.org/journal/article/the-international-girls-baseball- league/ In the winter of 1952‚Äì1953, players from both the AAGPL and National Girls Baseball League played together in the four‚Äìteam International Girls Baseball League based in Miami, Florida. The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League went through three periods of ownership. It was owned by chewing gum mogul Wrigley from 1943 to 1945, wealthy publicist Arthur Meyerhoff from 1945 to 1951, and the teams were individually owned from 1951 to 1954. The teams generally played in Midwestern cities. The South Bend Blue Sox and the Rockford Peaches were the only two teams that stayed in their home cities for the full period of the AAGPBL's existence. In the first season, the league played a game that was a hybrid of baseball and softball. The ball was 12 inches in circumference, the size of a regulation softball (regulation baseballs are 9 to 9 inches). The pitcher's mound was only forty feet from home plate, closer even than in regulation softball and much closer than the baseball distance of 60 feet, 6 inches. Pitchers threw underhand windmill, like in softball, and the distance between bases was 65 feet, five feet longer than in softball, but 25 feet shorter than in baseball. Major similarities between the AAGPBL and baseball included nine player teams and the use of a pitcher's mound (softball pitchers throw from flat ground). By 1948, the ball had shrunk to 10 inches, overhand pitching was allowed, and the mound was moved back to 50 feet. Over the history of the league, the rules continued to gradually approach those of baseball. By the final season in 1954, the ball was regulation baseball size, the mound was moved back to 60 feet, and the basepaths were extended to 85 feet (still five feet shorter than in regulation baseball). Teams were generally managed by men who knew competitive athletics and were former major league players, in part to demonstrate to fans that the league was serious. Salaries were above average for women and ranged from $45‚Äì$85 (or $‚Äì$ in dollars) a week during the first years of play to about $125 (or $ in dollars) per week in later years. The women's league generally went along with the men's late spring to early autumn season.[Johnson, Anne Janette. Great Women in Sports. Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 1996.] The uniforms worn by the female ballplayers consisted of a belted, short-sleeved tunic dress with a slight flare of the skirt. Rules stated that skirts were to be worn no more than six inches above the knee, but the regulation was most often ignored in order to facilitate running and fielding. A circular team logo was sewn on the front of each dress, and baseball caps featured elastic bands in the back so that they were one-size-fits-all. During spring training, the girls were required to attend Helena Rubinstein's evening charm school classes. The proper etiquette for every situation was taught, and every aspect of personal hygiene, mannerisms, and dress code was presented to all the players. In an effort to make each player as physically attractive as possible, each received a beauty kit and instructions on how to use it. As a part of the league's 'Rules of Conduct', the 'girls' were not permitted to have short hair, they could not smoke or drink in public places, and they were required to wear lipstick at all times. Fines for not following the league's rules of conduct were five dollars for the first offense, ten for the second, and suspension for the third. In 1944, Josephine \\"JoJo\\" D'Angelo was fired for cutting her hair short. The women's contracts were much stricter about behavior than in the men's league, and each team was also assigned its own chaperone by the league. The AAGPBL received extensive publicity from its inception throughout the 1940s. The league was featured in both national periodicals such as Time, Life, Seventeen, Newsweek, and American Magazine, as well as in local city newspapers. Philip Wrigley, the league's founder, believed in the value of advertising, which may have attributed to the league's extensive exposure and marketing focus. Wrigley learned to appreciate advertising from his father, William Wrigley, who had success with his chewing gum company in large part due to marketing methods. The league remained under Wrigley's advertising influence until 1951, when individual team directors took over the publicity.Fidler, Merrie A. \\"Establishing the Public Image: Publicity and Promotion, 1943 - 1944.\\" In The Origin and History of the All- American Girls Professional Baseball League, 50-68. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2006. The league's principle advertising agent was Arthur E. Meyerhoff who handled the league's publicity from 1943 through 1950. Meyerhoff's promotional efforts focused on the value of national exposure in popular periodicals. These magazine articles attracted new fans and new players to the AAGPBL. The major publicity themes that characterized the league were ‚ÄúRecreation for War Workers,‚Äù ‚ÄúFemininity,‚Äù ‚ÄúCommunity Welfare,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFamily Entertainment.‚Äù The league shifted to decentralized league administration from 1951 to 1954. Thus, the responsibility was on individual team management to publicize and promote the teams. However, local managers were not always effective due to their lack of expertise in advertising. In the 1951 season, the league president Fred Leo asked all team presidents to provide publicity on games and training events. Only one team complied with Fred Leo's request, which led to an early 1952 preseason board meeting to discuss inadequate promotion.Fidler, Merrie A. \\"Decentralization of Publicity and Promotion, 1951-1954.\\" In The Origin and History of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, 136-142. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2006. Due to the decentralized league administration, many of the promotion efforts from team management were aimed exclusively at local populaces. There were many promotional events with players, children's benefits, civic groups, and holiday celebrations. Along with daily newspaper reports, the primary advertising strategy was radio broadcasts. The AAGPBL peaked in attendance during the 1948 season, when 10 teams attracted 910,000 paid fans. The Rockford Peaches won the most league championships with four (1945, 1948, 1949, 1950). The Milwaukee/Grand Rapids Chicks were second with three (1944 in Milwaukee, 1947 and 1953 in Grand Rapids). The Racine Belles (1943 and 1946) and the South Bend Blue Sox (1951 and 1952) each won two, and the Kalamazoo Lassies won in the league's final season (1954). Legacy The 1992 film A League of Their Own, although fictionalized, covers the founding and play of this league. Geena Davis, Lori Petty, Rosie O'Donnell, Madonna, and Tom Hanks were the stars of the film, which was directed by Penny Marshall. The league is the forerunner of later- day professional league sports played by women. Lois Siegel documented the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in her film Baseball Girls, which was produced by the National Film Board of Canada.

Although the AAGPBL was the first recorded professional women's baseball league, women had played baseball since the nineteenth century. The first known women's baseball team played at Vassar College in 1866,Debra A.

Women in Baseball. (sometimes including menRitter, Lawrence S. The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played It. ) Baseball Hall of Fame members Max Carey and Jimmie Foxx managed teams in the AAGPBL. The character of Jimmy Dugan, played by Tom Hanks in A League of Their Own, was loosely based on Foxx's tenure in the league. However, several of his former AAGPBL players said that, unlike Hanks‚Äô character in the movie, Foxx was always gentlemanly around them. Logo of the All-American Girls Softball League, 1943The league went through a series of name changes during its history. It was founded as the All-American Girls Softball League, but midway through its first season of 1943, the name was changed to the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL). After the 1943 season, the official League name was again changed, to the All-American Girls Professional Ball League (AAGPBL), reflecting that players were paid from the start and further separating it from existing amateur leagues. This name was used until the end of the 1945 season, when the league reverted to All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL), which it would use through 1950. When teams were sold to independent owners at the end of the 1950 season, the official League name was changed to the American Girls Baseball League (AGBL), although it continued to be popularly identified as the All-American League or the All-American Girls Baseball League (AAGBBL). When the Players' Association organized in 1986, and gained recognition by the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1988, it was finally named All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (AAGPBL). Rules of play Uniforms Reproduction 1944 Milwaukee Chicks uniform on display at Miller ParkThe uniform was a one-piece short-skirted flared tunic with a team patch in the center of the chest. The base uniform was designed by Wrigley Company art director Otis Shepard, assisted by Wrigley's wife Helen and Chicago softball player Ann Harnett, the first player signed by the league. Shepard was also the longtime art director for the Chicago Cubs and spearheaded a series of innovative uniforms beginning in 1937. Shepard designed all visual elements of the league, including game scorecards and promotional materials. For his work on the AAGPBL and the Cubs, Shepard was called the \\"chief visualizer of mid-century baseball.\\" Shepard modeled the uniform after the figure skating, field hockey, and tennis outfits of the period. The uniforms included satin shorts, knee-high baseball socks, and a baseball cap. The team patches were modeled after each respective city's seal. In the beginning, each team was issued one uniform style, to be worn in all games. Shepard unveiled the inaugural uniforms in a palette of pastel colors: green for Kenosha; yellow for Racine; blue for South Bend; and peach for Rockford. The accessories (cap, belt, stirrups) were bold darker shades of the team color. As new teams were added, they were given a new distinctive team color (gray for Milwaukee, pink for Minneapolis). Road uniforms were introduced to the league starting with the 1948 season. Theme song The theme song made famous in the 1992 film A League of Their Own was the official song of the All-American Girls Baseball League, co-written by Pepper Paire and Nalda Bird (although in the movie, the word \\"Irishmen\\" was changed to \\"Irish ones\\"). In their annual reunions since 1998, it is usual to hear the original AAGPBL players singing the song.

Many people in the 1950s thought that women were not supposed to play baseball, so most female athletes competed on other fields of endeavor. Finally, in 1980, former pitcher June Peppas launched a newsletter project to get in touch with friends, teammates, and opponents that resulted in the league's first reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. The Players Association was formed after a 1986 Reunion held in Fort Wayne as part of Run, Jane, Run, a local Women's Bureau event. Historian and Baseball card publisher Sharon Roepke (author of Diamond Gals) who was circulating a petition to get the Baseball Hall of Fame to recognize the All American Girls Baseball League asked the players at the Reunion to organize to help the effort. A meeting was held at the South Bend home of Fran Janssen, and the Player's Association was born. June Peppas was nominated President.

Succession is by a change in the law in 2009 governed by absolute primogeniture. Law of succession Dynasts lose their right to the throne if they marry without the permission of the monarch, to be given in the Council of State. Individuals born to unmarried dynasts or to former dynasts who married without royal permission, and their descendants, are excluded from the throne. Further, when approving a marriage, the monarch can impose conditions that must be met in order for any resulting offspring to have succession rights. If there is no eligible person(s) to inherit the throne, the Danish Parliament (the Folketing) has the right to elect a new monarch and determine a line of succession. Line of succession * 15px King Frederick IX (1899‚Äì1972) **15px Queen Margrethe II (born 1940) *** (1) Crown Prince Frederik (b. 1968) **** (2) Prince Christian (b. 2005) **** (3) Princess Isabella (b. 2007) **** (4) Prince Vincent (b. 2011) **** (5) Princess Josephine (b. 2011) *** (6) Prince Joachim (b. 1969) **** (7) Prince Nikolai (b. 1999) **** (8) Prince Felix (b. 2002) **** (9) Prince Henrik (b. 2009) **** (10) Princess Athena (b. 2012) ** (11) Princess Benedikte (b. 1944) =Note= The consent to Princess Benedikte's marriage to Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg in 1968 was given on the condition that their children (and further descendants) would have to take up permanent residence in Denmark during the age of mandatory education if they were to retain their succession rights. Since the condition was not met, Princess Benedikte's children are not deemed to have succession rights and are not included in the official line of succession. It is unclear whether their own descendants will have succession rights if residing in Denmark during the age of mandatory education. One Danish constitutional scholar, the late Professor Henrik Zahle, claimed that the children of Princess Benedikte do have succession rights, but without providing any arguments for the claim. History From the London Protocol in 1852 till 1953, various male-line descendants of King Christian IX had succession rights in Denmark except George I of Greece (former Prince William of Denmark) and subsequent kings of Greece, whose rights to the Danish throne were blocked by article VI of the 1863 treaty between Denmark, France, Great Britain and Russia recognizing George I as king of the Hellenes. The new Act of Succession terminated succession rights but left the excluded individuals in possession of their titles. This created a class of people with royal titles but no rights to the throne. As a distinction, those entitled to inherit the throne are called \\"Prins til Danmark\\" (Prince to Denmark, although this distinction is not made in English) while those without succession rights are referred to as \\"Prins af Danmark\\" (Prince of Denmark). From 1853 until 1953, the crown passed according to agnatic primogeniture. The monarch in 1953, King Frederick IX, had three daughters but no sons. Before the 1953 act, the heir presumptive to the throne was Hereditary Prince Knud, the King's younger brother. The Hereditary Prince was far less popular than the King was. Further, his mother- in-law, Princess Helena, was accused of supporting the Nazi movement during the Second World War. These factors, combined with a belief that the Salic Law was outdated, resulted in the movement to change the succession law so that Frederick's eldest daughter, the then Princess Margrethe, could inherit the throne. Thus, the Salic law was changed to male-preference primogeniture in 1953, meaning that females could inherit, but only if they had no brothers. Prince Knud had three children. His sons married without the monarch's permission and lost both their royal titles and succession rights. Only Knud's daughter, the unmarried Princess Elisabeth, retained her rights to the throne. Since her death, the line of succession has consisted only of descendants of King Frederick IX. Queen Margrethe II's youngest sister, Anne-Marie, married King Constantine II of Greece in 1964. In view of the fact that she was marrying a foreign ruler, although he was himself a Prince of Denmark, consent to the marriage was given on the condition that Anne-Marie renounced her and her descendants' rights to the Danish throne. In 2008, the Danish parliament voted in favour of a new royal succession law that allows a first-born child to one day ascend the throne regardless of whether it is a boy or a girl, similar to that of Sweden and Norway. The bill was voted through two successive parliaments, and submitted to a referendum, ensuring that, in future, the heir apparent to the throne of Denmark would be the monarch's first-born child. However, the 'yes' did not change the actual line of succession at that time. The Crown Princess gave birth to twins on 8 January 2011. Upon their birth, the twins assumed the fourth and fifth place in the line of succession, according to the absolute primogeniture principle adopted, thereby not giving Prince Vincent precedence over his older sister Princess Isabella.A Prince and a Princess are born .

It is a coming- of-age story about a child (Astrid) who is separated from her mother (Ingrid) and placed in a series of foster homes. It deals with themes of motherhood. The book was selected for Oprah's Book Club in May 1999, after which it became a national bestseller. It was adapted as a 2002 film. Plot summary Astrid Magnussen is a 12-year-old girl living in Los Angeles, California with her mother, Ingrid Magnussen, a self-centered and eccentric poet. Astrid's father, Klaus Anders, left before Astrid was old enough to remember him. Ingrid begins dating a man named Barry. Eventually, Ingrid discovers that Barry is cheating on her with younger women, so she breaks into Barry's house and poisons him with a mixture of DMSO and oleander sap. Barry dies, and Ingrid is charged with his murder. Sentenced to life in prison, she promises her daughter that she will come back. Astrid is shuffled from one foster home to another for years. First, she joins Starr, a former stripper, and recovering drug addict and alcoholic. Starr has two children of her own, as well as two other foster children. Astrid (who is 14 by this time) has a sexual relationship with Starr's live-in boyfriend, Ray. As his interest in Starr diminishes, Starr relapses. One night, after confronting Ray over his relationship with Astrid (out of jealousy and not concern), Starr shoots Astrid with a .38. Astrid is hospitalized for a few weeks, at which time she begins abusing the prescription drug Demerol. After recovery Astrid is sent to live with Ed and Marvel Turlock, and their two small children, essentially as an unpaid babysitter. Astrid dislikes the couple, partially due to her dislike of the house, and partially due to Marvel's tendency to make racist statements about minorities, particularly their next-door neighbor, a beautiful African- American prostitute named Olivia Johnstone, whom Astrid befriends. Astrid admires Olivia's beauty, wealth, and hedonistic lifestyle. The Turlocks send Astrid away when they discover she associates with Olivia. Next, Astrid is sent to the home of a Hispanic woman named Amelia Ramos. Despite her wealth, Amelia starves her foster children, and Astrid resorts to eating from the garbage at school. Astrid eventually gets a new caseworker who finds her a new placement. A former actress, Claire Richards, and her husband, Ron, are Astrid's next foster parents. Claire ensures Astrid's comfort. For once, Astrid is doing well in school and pursuing art. Astrid continues corresponding with Ingrid in prison but becomes increasingly bitter towards her mother. Meanwhile, Claire suspects that Ron is having an affair. Claire, emotionally disturbed, commits suicide by overdosing. Astrid, now 17, is placed in MacLaren Children's Center (known as \\"Mac\\") where she meets an artistic boy named Paul Trout. They bond, but Astrid is sent to a new home. Astrid's final home is with Russian immigrant Rena Grushenka. Astrid, still underage, has a sexual relationship with Rena's boyfriend, Sergei. One day, after getting high on acid, Astrid begins to have memories of a woman named Annie. Meanwhile, Ingrid and her lawyer begin to build a case to get Ingrid released from prison. However, their case depends on Astrid: if she testifies that Ingrid did not murder Barry, Ingrid will likely not be sentenced. Astrid realizes that she is in a position of power over her mother and asks Ingrid who Annie is. Ingrid reveals that Annie was a babysitter with whom Ingrid left Astrid for over a year. Astrid is upset and gives Ingrid a choice: to have her testify or to see her daughter return to the person her mother knew her as. Ingrid makes the choice not to ask Astrid to lie for her. Two years later, Astrid is 20 and living with Paul in a rundown flat in Berlin, Germany. Astrid spends her time buying suitcases and transforming them into individual art pieces representing her different foster homes. Ingrid is released from prison after a new trial acquits her. Astrid realizes that if she returns to California to reunite with Ingrid, she must abandon Paul. She chooses to stay with him but longs to go. Major characters **Astrid Magnussen** : the main character, she is twelve years old when the novel opens. Artistic, shy and in the sway of her manipulative mother. The novel depicts her loss of naivety, sexual awakening, and attempts at self-definition. **Ingrid Magnussen** : Astrid's manipulative mother, who is jailed early in the novel for her murder of her lover Barry. When with Astrid, she often forgets she has a daughter and focuses on her eclectic art. Later, she attempts to control Astrid from jail. **Starr** : Astrid's first foster mother, she is a former stripper turned outspoken Christian. She is recovering from alcoholism and drug use and lives in a trailer with her children. She first shows kindness to Astrid but later grows jealous of Astrid's relationship with Ray. **'Uncle' Ray** : Starr's boyfriend, whose children call him \\"Uncle Ray.\\" A seemingly kind mechanic, he begins a sexual relationship with Astrid who is, at the time, 14. Thus the relationship is an example of sexual predation. **Olivia Johnstone** : An African-American high-class prostitute Astrid befriends while living with her second foster family, the Turlocks. Olivia introduces Astrid to a luxurious, hedonistic, and irresponsible lifestyle. **Claire Richards** : Astrid's fourth foster mother, who notices Astrid's artistic talent and encourages her to pursue school. Claire has a weak relationship with her husband, poor self- esteem, and commits suicide after encouragement from Ingrid. **Paul Trout** : An artistic boy Astrid meets while staying at MacLaren Children's Center (known as \\"Mac\\"), a facility for foster children who can't find placements. Astrid later develops a romance with Paul. **Rena Grushenka** : Astrid's final foster mother, a tough, business-savvy Russian woman. She is abrasive but encourages Astrid to make sound financial decisions and to become a good negotiator. Major themes Motherhood is a primary theme of the novel. Astrid struggles to define herself against her biological mother and her various foster mothers, while still searching for the love and acceptance her mother cannot provide from jail. The art pieces Astrid creates at the end of the novel are metaphors for her various mothers and homes. Other major themes include the nature of art; self-reflection and creation; survival of the fittest; and perfection versus imperfection. Reception The novel received good reviews and had a typical publication run for a debut novel. After being named to Oprah's Book Club in 1999, the popularity of the book skyrocketed. It became a national best seller. Currently, it has a 3.95 out of 5 star rating on GoodReads. Adaptations Fitch originally wrote the novel as a short story, which was distinguished in the 1994 edition of \\"Best American Short Stories\\". The novel was adapted into a film, White Oleander, released in 2002 starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Ren√©e Zellweger.

Previously, he had served as the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. Cardozo is remembered for his significant influence on the development of American common law in the 20th century, in addition to his philosophy and vivid prose style. Born in New York City, Cardozo passed the bar in 1891 after attending Columbia Law School. He won an election to the New York Supreme Court in 1913 but joined the New York Court of Appeals the following year. He won election as Chief Judge of that court in 1926. As Chief Judge, he wrote majority opinions on cases such as Palsgraf v. Long Island Rail Road Co. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to the Supreme Court to succeed Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. Cardozo served on the Court until his death in 1938, and formed part of the liberal bloc of justices known as the Three Musketeers. He wrote the Court's majority opinion in notable cases such as Nixon v. Condon and Steward Machine Co. v. Davis. Early life and career =Early life and family= Cardozo, the son of Rebecca Washington (n√©e Nathan) and Albert Jacob Cardozo, was born in 1870 in New York City. Both Cardozo's maternal grandparents, Sara Seixas and Isaac Mendes Seixas Nathan, and his paternal grandparents, Ellen Hart and Michael H. Cardozo, were Western Sephardim of the Portuguese Jewish community, and affiliated with Manhattan's Congregation Shearith Israel. Their ancestors had immigrated to the British colonies from London, England before the American Revolution. The family were descended from Jewish-origin New Christian conversos. They left the Iberian Peninsula for Holland during the Inquisition. There they returned to the practice of Judaism. Cardozo family tradition held that their marrano (New Christians who maintained crypto-Jewish practices in secrecy) ancestors were from Portugal, although Cardozo's ancestry has not been firmly traced to that country.Mark Sherman, 'First Hispanic justice? Some say it was Cardozo', The Associated Press, 2009. But \\"Cardozo\\" (archaic spelling of Cardoso), \\"Seixas\\" and \\"Mendes\\" are the Portuguese, rather than Spanish, spelling of those common Iberian surnames. Benjamin Cardozo had a fraternal twin, his sister Emily. There were four other siblings, including an older sister Nell and older brother. Benjamin was named for his uncle, Benjamin Nathan, a vice president of the New York Stock Exchange. He was murdered in 1870 and the case was never solved. Among their many cousins, given their deep history in the US, was the poet Emma Lazarus. Other earlier relations include Francis Lewis Cardozo (1836-1903), Thomas Cardozo, and Henry Cardozo, free men of color of Charleston, South Carolina. Francis became a Presbyterian minister in New Haven, Connecticut after education in Scotland, and was elected as Secretary of State of South Carolina during the Reconstruction era. Later he worked as an educator in Washington, DC under a Republican administration.Richardson, Joe M. \\"Francis L. Cardozo: Black educator during reconstruction.\\" Journal of Negro Education 48.1 (1979): 73‚Äì83. in JSTOR Albert Cardozo, Benjamin Cardozo's father, was a judge on the Supreme Court of New York (the state's general trial court) until 1868. He was implicated in a judicial corruption scandal, sparked by the Erie Railway takeover wars, and forced to resign. The scandal also led to the creation of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. After leaving the court, the senior Cardozo practiced law for nearly two decades more until his death in 1885. When Benjamin and Emily were young, their mother Rebecca died. The twins were raised during much of their childhood largely by their sister Nell, who was 11 years older. Benjamin remained devoted to her throughout his life. One of Benjamin's tutors was Horatio Alger. =Education= At age 15, Cardozo entered Columbia University where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.Supreme Court Justices Who Are Phi Beta Kappa Members , Phi Beta Kappa website. Retrieved Oct 4, 2009 He was admitted to Columbia Law School in 1889. Cardozo wanted to enter a profession that could enable him to support himself and his siblings, but he also hoped to restore the family name, sullied by his father's actions as a judge. Cardozo left law school after two years without a law degree. =Legal practice= Cardozo passed the bar in 1891 and began practicing appellate law alongside his older brother. Benjamin Cardozo practiced law in New York City until year-end 1913 with Simpson, Warren and Cardozo. Interested in advancement and restoring the family name, Cardozo ran for a judgeship on the New York Supreme Court. In November 1913, Cardozo was elected by a large margin to a 14-year term on that court, taking office on January 1, 1914. New York Court of Appeals In February 1914, Cardozo was designated to the New York Court of Appeals under the Amendment of 1899.Designation, The New York Times, February 3, 1914 He was reportedly the first Jew to serve on the Court of Appeals. In January 1917, he was appointed by the governor to a regular seat on the Court of Appeals to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Samuel Seabury. In November 1917, he was elected on the Democratic and Republican tickets to a 14-year term on the Court of Appeals. In 1926, he was elected, on both tickets again, to a 14-year term as Chief Judge. He took office on January 1, 1927, and resigned on March 7, 1932 to accept an appointment to the United States Supreme Court. His tenure was marked by a number of original rulings, in tort and contract law in particular. This is partly due to timing; rapid industrialization was forcing courts to look anew at old common law components to adapt to new settings. In 1921, Cardozo gave the Storrs Lectures at Yale University, which were later published as The Nature of the Judicial Process (On line version), a book that remains valuable to judges today. Shortly thereafter, Cardozo became a member of the group that founded the American Law Institute, which crafted a Restatement of the Law of Torts, Contracts, and a host of other private law subjects. He wrote three other books that also became standards in the legal world. While on the Court of Appeals, he criticized the Exclusionary rule as developed by the federal courts, saying: \\"The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.\\" He noted that many states had rejected the rule, but suggested that the adoption by the federal courts would affect the practice in the sovereign states.People of the State of New York v. John Defore, 150 N.E. 585 (1926). . United States Supreme Court Justice Cardozo in his robes Cardozo's Supreme Court nomination In 1932, President Herbert Hoover appointed Cardozo to the Supreme Court of the United States to succeed Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes. The New York Times said of Cardozo's appointment that \\"seldom, if ever, in the history of the Court has an appointment been so universally commended.\\" Democratic Cardozo's appointment by a Republican president has been referred to as one of the few Supreme Court appointments in history that was not motivated by partisanship or politics, but strictly based on the nominee's contribution to law. At the time Hoover was running for re-election, eventually against Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, so he may still have been considering a larger political calculation. Cardozo was confirmed by a unanimous voice vote in the Senate on February 24.(The New York Times, February 25, 1932, p. 1) On a radio broadcast on March 1, 1932, the day of Cardozo's confirmation, Clarence C. Dill, Democratic Senator for Washington, called Hoover's appointment of Cardozo \\"the finest act of his career as President\\".(The New York Times, March 2, 1932, p. 13) The entire faculty of the University of Chicago Law School had urged Hoover to nominate Cardozo, as did the deans of the law schools at Harvard, Yale, and Columbia. Justice Harlan Fiske Stone strongly urged Hoover to name Cardozo, even offering to resign to make room for him if Hoover had his heart set on someone else (Stone had suggested to Calvin Coolidge that he should nominate Cardozo in 1925 before Stone).(Handler, 1995) Hoover originally demurred; he was concerned that there were already two justices from New York, and a Jew on the court. Justice James McReynolds was known as a notorious anti-Semite. When the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, William E. Borah of Idaho, added his strong support for Cardozo, however, Hoover finally bowed to the pressure. Cardozo was a member of the Three Musketeers, along with Brandeis and Stone, who were considered to be the liberal faction of the Supreme Court. In his years as an Associate Justice, Cardozo wrote opinions that stressed the necessity for the tightest adherence to the Tenth Amendment. Death In late 1937, Cardozo had a heart attack, and in early 1938, he suffered a stroke. He died on July 9, 1938, at the age of 68. He was buried in Beth Olam Cemetery in Queens.

Honors Cardozo received the honorary degree of LL.D. from several colleges and universities, including: Columbia (1915); Yale (1921); New York (1922); Michigan (1923); Harvard (1927); St. John's (1928); St. Lawrence (1932); Williams (1932); Princeton (1932); Pennsylvania (1932); Brown (1933); and Chicago (1933). Personal life Cardozo had an apartment in this building in Washington, D.C. As an adult, Cardozo no longer practiced Judaism (he identified as an agnostic), but he was proud of his Jewish heritage.Benjamin Cardozo., Jewish Virtual Library, Of the six children born to Albert and Rebecca Cardozo, only his twin sister Emily married. She and her husband did not have any children. Constitutional law scholar Jeffrey Rosen noted in a The New York Times Book Review of Richard Polenberg's book on Cardozo: =Ethnicity= Cardozo was the second Jewish justice to be appointed to the Supreme Court. The first was Louis Brandeis, whose family was Ashkenazi. Cardozo was born into the Spanish and Portuguese Jewish community, which had traditions distinct from the Ashkenazi. Since the appointment of Justice Sonia Sotomayor in the 21st century, some commentators have suggested that Cardozo should be considered the 'first Hispanic justice.' But he did not grow up in Hispanic culture. In 1492 the Spanish Crown expelled resident Jews who would not convert, and persecuted some who did. In response to this controversy, Cardozo biographer Kaufman questioned the usage of the term \\"Hispanic\\" in Justice Cardozo's lifetime, stating: \\"Well, I think he regarded himself as a Sephardic Jew whose ancestors came from the Iberian Peninsula.\\" After centuries in British North America, Cardozo \\"confessed in 1937 that his family preserved neither the Spanish language nor Iberian cultural traditions\\". Ancestors had lived in England, the British colonies, and the United States since the 17th century. Some Latino advocacy groups, such as the National Association of Latino Elected Officials and the Hispanic National Bar Association, consider Sonia Sotomayor to be the first Hispanic justice, as she was raised in Hispanic culture.

A doorway page will affect the index of a search engine by inserting results for particular phrases while sending visitors to a different page. Doorway pages that redirect visitors without their knowledge use some form of cloaking. This usually falls under Black Hat SEO. If a visitor clicks through to a typical doorway page from a search engine results page, in most cases they will be redirected with a fast Meta refresh command to another page. Other forms of redirection include use of JavaScript and server side redirection, from the server configuration file. Some doorway pages may be dynamic pages generated by scripting languages such as Perl and PHP. Doorway pages are often easy to identify in that they have been designed primarily for search engines, not for human beings. Sometimes a doorway page is copied from another high ranking page, but this is likely to cause the search engine to detect the page as a duplicate and exclude it from the search engine listings. Because many search engines give a penalty for using the META refresh command, some doorway pages just trick the visitor into clicking on a link to get them to the desired destination page, or they use JavaScript for redirection. More sophisticated doorway pages, called Content Rich Doorways, are designed to gain high placement in search results without using redirection. They incorporate at least a minimum amount of design and navigation similar to the rest of the site to provide a more human-friendly and natural appearance. Visitors are offered standard links as calls to action. Landing pages are regularly misconstrued to equate to Doorway pages within the literature. The former are content rich pages to which traffic is directed within the context of pay-per-click campaigns and to maximize SEO campaigns. Doorway pages are also typically used for sites that maintain a blacklist of URLs known to harbor spam, such as Facebook, Tumblr and Deviantart. Cloaking Doorway pages often also employ Cloaking techniques for misdirection. Cloaked pages will show a version of that page to human visitor which is different from the one provided to crawlers - usually implemented via server side scripts. The server can differentiate between bots, crawlers and human visitors based on various flags, including source IP address and/or user-agent. Cloaking will simultaneously trick search engines to rank sites higher for irrelevant keywords, while displaying monetizing any human traffic by showing visitors spammy, often irrelevant, content. The practice of cloaking is considered to be highly manipulative and condemned within the SEO industry and by search engines, and its use can result in massive penalty or the complete removal of sites from being indexed Redirection Webmasters that use doorway pages would generally prefer that users never actually see these pages and instead be delivered to a \\"real\\" page within their sites. To achieve this goal, redirection is sometimes used. This may be as simple as installing a meta refresh tag on the doorway pages. An advanced system might make use of cloaking. In either case, such redirection may make your doorway pages unacceptable to search engines. Construction A content rich doorway page must be constructed in a Search engine friendly (SEF) manner, otherwise it may be construed as search engine spam possibly resulting in the page being banned from the index for an undisclosed amount of time. These types of doorways utilize (but are not limited to) the following: * Title Attributed images for key word support * Title Attributed links for key word support In culture Doorway pages were examined as a cultural and political phenomenon along with spam poetry and flarf.

Asparagus is its only food plant. The beetle is 6.0 mm to 9.5 mm long and slightly elongated. It is metallic blue-black in color with cream or yellow spots on its red-bordered elytra. The larvae are fat gray grubs with dark heads. The adult beetles and the larvae strip the needle-like leaves off the asparagus fronds, depriving the plants of the ability to photosynthesize and store energy for future years. They also chew the spears and lay generous amounts of eggs on them, making the crop unmarketable. The larvae feed on the plants for a few weeks, then drop to the ground to pupate. One year may see two or three generations of the beetle. The adults overwinter in a dormant state underground or in nearby leaf litter. The parasitic wasp, Tetrastichus coeruleus, occurring mainly in the United States and Europe, can cause up to 71% mortality in the field and has been successfully used for biological control. Various insecticides (such as carbamates, pyrethroids, spinetoram, and spinosad) can be considered for pest control. The similar spotted asparagus beetle (Crioceris duodecimpunctata) is also a pest as an adult, feeding on tender shoots and leaves, but since the larvae feed only on the asparagus berries it is not considered to be as important.

He played John Wayne's adversary Bart Jason in the 1966 Western El Dorado. He has played Santa Claus in several films, notably in 2003's Elf. In 2009, he starred as the voice of Carl Fredricksen in Pixar's animated film Up, and made a guest appearance on CSI: NY in the episode \\"Yahrzeit\\".

He later made frequent guest appearances with the successor to Compass, The Second City. In New York City, Asner played Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum in the Off-Broadway revival of Threepenny Opera, scored his first Broadway role in Face of a Hero alongside Jack Lemmon in 1960, and began to make inroads as a television actor, having made his TV debut in 1957 on Studio One. In two notable performances on television, Asner played Detective Sgt. Thomas Siroleo in the 1963 episode of The Outer Limits titled \\"It Crawled Out of the Woodwork\\" and the reprehensible ex-premier Brynov in the 1965 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea episode \\"The Exile.\\" He made his film debut in 1962, in the Elvis Presley vehicle Kid Galahad.

In 1977, after the series, Asner's character was given his own show, Lou Grant (1977‚Äì82). In contrast to the Mary Tyler Moore series, a thirty-minute award- winning comedy about television journalism, the Lou Grant series was an hour- long award-winning drama about newspaper journalism.

Asner was acclaimed for his role in the ABC miniseries Roots, as Captain Davies, the morally conflicted captain of the Lord Ligonier, the slave ship that brought Kunta Kinte to America. The role earned Asner an Emmy Award, as did the similarly dark role of Axel Jordache in the miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man (1976). In contrast, he played a former pontiff in the lead role of Papa Giovanni: Ioannes XXIII (Pope John XXIII 2002), an Italian television film for RAI.

In July 2010, Asner completed recording sessions for Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders; a documentary on the 1974 DeFeo murders in Amityville, New York. Asner served as the narrator for the film, which covers a forensic analysis of the murders, the trial in which 23-year-old DeFeo son Ronald DeFeo Jr., was convicted of the killings, and the subsequent \\"haunting\\" story which is revealed to be a hoax. Also in 2010, Asner played the title role in FDR, a stage production about the life of Franklin Delano Roosevelt; he has subsequently continued to tour the play throughout the country.

He subsequently toured for the next three years in \\"concert readings\\" of the play in more than a dozen cities across the United States. In 2019, PBS flagship station WNET filmed the concert reading at New York's Center for Jewish History for their All Arts channel. The performance, which is available for free, world-wide live-streaming, co-stars Tovah Feldshuh, Ned Eisenberg, and Liba Vaynberg. Further plans for Asner to perform the play have been postponed during the Coronavirus pandemic.

He endorsed Barack Obama during the 2008 United States presidential election. He was formerly a member of the Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee (DSOC) and is a member of DSOC's successor, the Democratic Socialists of America. The sudden cancellation of Lou Grant in 1982 was the subject of much controversy. The show had high ratings‚Äîthe level of which should have justified its ongoing presence in primetime (it was in the ACNielsen top ten throughout its final month on the air). However, the CBS television network declined to renew it. It has been Asner's consistent position that his left-wing political views, as well as the publicity surrounding them, were the actual root causes for the show's cancellation. Asner endorsed Democratic candidate Marcy Winograd in the 2011 California 36th Congressional district special election. From 2011 to 2015, Asner worked with filmmaker Nicole Zwiren on the feature-length documentary Behind the Fear which addresses HIV/AIDS denialism.

Asner was adamantly opposed to such a merger, arguing that the planned merger would destroy the SAG's health plan and disempower actors. Asner and a group of fellow actors and voice-actors, including Martin Sheen and Ed Harris, filed (but later dropped) a lawsuit against SAG president Ken Howard and several SAG vice presidents, seeking to have the merger overturned, and the two unions separated to their pre-merger organizations.

He is the creator of the iconic underground characters The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers, Fat Freddy's Cat, and Wonder Wart-Hog.  Biography  = Early life and education = Shelton was born in Houston, Texas. He graduated from Lamar High School in Houston. He attended Washington and Lee University, Texas A&M; University, and the University of Texas at Austin, where he received his bachelor's degree in the social sciences in 1961. His early cartoons were published in the University of Texas' humor magazine The Texas Ranger. = Career = Directly after graduation, Shelton moved to New York City and got a job editing automotive magazines, where he would sneak his drawings into print. Early work of his was published in Warren Publishing's Help! The idea for the character of Wonder Wart-Hog, a porcine parody of Superman, came to him in 1961. The following year, Shelton moved back to Texas to enroll in graduate school and get a student deferment from the draft. The first two Wonder Wart-Hog stories appeared in Bacchanal, a short-lived college humor magazine, in the spring of 1962. That same year, he published (in zine form) Frank Stack's The Adventures of Jesus, one of the first underground comix; Stack wrote and drew the comic strip under the name Foolbert Sturgeon. Shelton then became editor of The Texas RangerShelton entry, Who's Who of American Comic Books, 1928‚Äì1999. Accessed Nov. 5, 2016. and published more Wonder Wart-Hog stories.

Accessed Dec. 22, 2016. for two years, he was finally drafted, but Army doctors declared him medically unfit after he admitted to taking psychedelic drugs. After this, in 1964 and 1965, he spent some time in Cleveland, where his girlfriend Pat Brown (another UT alum)Holland, Richard A. The Texas Book: Profiles, History, and Reminiscences of the University (University of Texas Press, 2006), pp. 223‚Äì299. was going to the Cleveland Institute of Art. He applied for a job at the Cleveland-based American Greeting Card Company (where a fellow underground comic artist Robert Crumb had worked) but was turned down. The period of 1965‚Äì1968 was an itinerant one for Shelton: he moved to New York to work for the underground East Village Other, and to Los Angeles to work for the Los Angeles Free Press. Around this time Shelton became art director for the Vulcan Gas Company, a rock music venue in Austin, Texas, where he worked with Jim Franklin. He created a number of posters in the style of contemporary California poster artists such as Victor Moscoso and Rick Griffin. After a year of this, he moved to San Francisco in 1968, hopeful that being closer to the action would enable him to do more poster work; as it turned out, he finally got his break in the world of underground comix. That same year, Millar Publishing Company, who had been publishing regular Wonder Wart-Hog stories since 1966, published two issues of Wonder Wart-Hog. 140,000 copies of each were printed, but distributors did not pick up the magazine, and only 40,000 of each were sold. In 1968 Shelton self-publlished Feds 'n' Heads, a collection of strips first published in the Austin underground paper The Rag (Feds 'n' Head was later re-issued multiple times by the Print Mint),Estren, Mark. A History of Underground Comics: 20th Anniversary Edition (Ronin Publishing, 2012), p. 54. Feds 'n' Heads featured Wonder Wart-Hog and what became his most famous strip, The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Shelton created a spin-off strip, Fat Freddy's Cat in 1969, when he also co-founded Rip Off Press with three fellow \\"expatriate\\" Texans: Fred Todd, Dave Moriaty, and cartoonist Jack Jackson. Shelton was also a regular contributor to Zap Comix and other underground titles, including Bijou Funnies, Yellow Dog, Arcade, The Rip Off Review of Western Culture, and Anarchy Comics He did the cover art for the 1973 album Doug Sahm and Band, as well as The Grateful Dead's 1978 album, Shakedown Street. He also illustrated the cover of the early classic computer magazine compilation The Best of Creative Computing Volume 2 in 1977. His most recent work, in collaboration with French cartoonist Pic, is Not Quite Dead, which appeared in Rip Off Comix #25 (Rip Off Press, Winter 1989) and in six Not Quite Dead comic books. A new Wonder Wart-Hog story appeared in Zap Comix #15 (Last Gasp, 2005), as well as The Complete Zap boxed set (Fantagraphics, 2014) which contained Zap #16; and a new Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers story appeared in Zap #16 as well. The Freak Brothers' antics are reportedly being turned into a Broadway musical, after a stop motion animated film, titled Grass Roots, fell through. Fifty Freakin' Years with the Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers was published in 2017, containing new strips by Shelton, as well as his written introduction. = Music = In 1966 Shelton formed the Gilbert Shelton Ensemble and released a 45 record on ESP Records, \\"If I Was A Hells Angel\\" b/w \\"Southern Stock Car Man\\" backed by members of Austin psychedlic-rock band The Conqueroo, Tom Bright, Bob Brown and Ed Guinn.

It lies in a farming area of the Wairarapa in New Zealand's North Island. It is located southwest of Masterton and northeast of Wellington. The town has a population of ), out of a total district population of . Carterton was founded in 1857. Originally known as Three Mile Bush, it served as housing for workers building the road between Wellington and Masterton. It was later renamed after Charles Carter, who was in charge of the building of the Black Bridge over the Waiohine River south of the town. The town describes itself as New Zealand's daffodil capital, holding a Daffodil Festival each year on the second Sunday in September, with the main event taking place at Middle Run along Gladstone Road. History Carterton was the first place in the world to elect a transgender mayor, Georgina Beyer. Beyer went on to set another world's first record, becoming the MP for Wairarapa in 1999. On 7 January 2012, a hot air balloon crashed just north of the town, killing eleven people and making headlines around the world. The balloon came into contact with a high-voltage power line supplying the town, resulting in the balloon catching fire and the town losing power briefly. In 1956, along with Masterton, Carterton became the joint first town in New Zealand to use the 111 Emergency Number. Demographics Carterton District had a population of 9,198 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 963 people (11.7%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 2,097 people (29.5%) since the 2006 census. There were 3,645 households. There were 4,524 males and 4,674 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.97 males per female. Of the total population, 1,740 people (18.9%) were aged up to 15 years, 1,281 (13.9%) were 15 to 29, 4,113 (44.7%) were 30 to 64, and 2,064 (22.4%) were 65 or older. Figures may not add up to the total due to rounding. Ethnicities were 91.4% European/PƒÅkehƒÅ, 13.4% MƒÅori, 1.8% Pacific peoples, 2.2% Asian, and 1.9% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity. The percentage of people born overseas was 16.6, compared with 27.1% nationally. Although some people objected to giving their religion, 53.1% had no religion, 35.5% were Christian, and 3.2% had other religions. Of those at least 15 years old, 1,350 (18.1%) people had a bachelor or higher degree, and 1,620 (21.7%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $29,800. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 3,492 (46.8%) people were employed full-time, 1,242 (16.7%) were part-time, and 240 (3.2%) were unemployed. Landmarks Carterton's town clock is located on High Street next to the post office. The existing tower was put into operation in September 1962, replacing the original clock tower atop the post office that was damaged in the 24 June 1942 Wairarapa earthquake. The Bank of New South Wales, showing confidence in Carterton, built a beautifully ornate bank building on the corner of Park Road and High Street North in 1912. This building is listed in the historic buildings list found in the Wairarapa Combined District Plan. In 1982, the Bank of New South Wales became Westpac and continued to occupy the building until a devastating earthquake in Christchurch (6.3 on the Richter scale) severely damaged many unreinforced masonry buildings in February 2011. After an unfavourable engineers' assessment the bank shifted out of the building approximately 150 metres south in High Street North. The building underwent substantial seismic strengthening and re-opened as the Carterton Free Presbyterian Church in July 2017. Historic Carterton Railway Station Historic Carterton railway station is located west of the town centre off Belvedere Road. The station building at the station is original, having been built when the railway opened in 1880, and has accepted passenger services ever since. It is currently leased from KiwiRail Network by the Wairarapa Railway Restoration Society. The Carterton District library on Holloway Street is New Zealand's oldest purpose-built library that is still in use as a library today. The Carterton Events Centrehttp://www.cartertonec.co.nz is also on Holloway Street. Opened in October 2011, this state-of-the-art, multi-purpose community facility is available for community and commercial use. Centrally located in the Wairarapa region, the Centre provides modern, flexible, spaces for all manner of events, shows, exhibitions, meetings and community gatherings. Interconnection of spaces throughout the Centre allows for separation and opening up of spaces to cater for different needs. The Events Centre belongs to the Carterton community, through the Carterton District Council. Carterton's Memorial Square is on the corner of High Street and Park Road and holds Carterton's World War One memorial, positioned centrally. The red granite pillar, apparently broken off at the top, symbolising the lives cut short by the war. The memorial was unveiled on 13 February 1921 by Minister of Internal Affairs George Anderson. Since the 1930s Memorial Square has been administered under an act of parliament ‚Äì the Carterton and District Memorial Square Act (1932). On Sundays from 22 February 2015, the Square began to host Carterton Farmers' Market. This weekly produce and craft event was born of the 2014 Place Making Carterton project, initiated by the Carterton District Business (Inc) group and Carterton District Council. Located 10 minutes from the Square is Stonehenge Aotearoa, built by members of The Phoenix Astronomy Society, it is a modern adaptation (opened in 2005) of the Stonehenge ruins on the Salisbury Plain of England. Education Carterton has three primary schools: * Carterton School, a state full primary (Year 1‚Äì8) school with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1861. * South End School, a state full primary (Year 1‚Äì8) school with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1962. * St Mary's School, a state-integrated Catholic full primary (Year 1‚Äì8) school with a roll of students as of The school opened in 1917 and integrated into the state education system in the early 1980s. Ponatahi Christian School a state-integrated composite (Year 1‚Äì13) Christian school, is also located in Carterton. It has a roll of students as of It was founded as a private school in 1978 and was originally sited at Ponatahi, southwest of Carterton. The school moved to its current site over the 1996‚Äì97 summer holidays, and integrated into the state education system in April 1998. There are no state secondary schools in Carterton. The nearest secondary schools are Kuranui College, 10 km away in Greytown, and Wairarapa College and Makoura College 14 km and 15 km away respectively in Masterton. Transport =Roads= The main street through Carterton is High Street - split on either side of Holloway Street into High Street North and High Street South. Other main streets include Park Road, Belvedere Road, Brooklyn Road, Pembroke Street and Holloway Street (which all run approximately east-west) and Lincoln Road (which runs approximately north-south). Other notable streets include Costley Street, Kenwyn Drive and Frederick Street. Carterton District is a rapidly expanding area which, according to inter-census dates (i.e. between 2006 and 2013) is the fastest growing local government area in the North Island with respect to population. A number of new subdivisions have assisted in this expansion such as Hartley Avenue, Daffodil Grove, Armstrong Avenue, Tararua Crescent, Carrington Drive and Mill Grove. Carterton is served by State Highway 2, the main highway between Wellington and Masterton. The highway runs the length of High Street. Carterton is served by Metlink bus route 200, which connects Carterton with Masterton, Greytown, Featherston and Martinborough. =Rail= Carterton lies on the Wairarapa Line, and is served by the Wairarapa Connection operated by KiwiRail and Transdev on behalf of Metlink, connecting Carterton to Wellington. The train serves both Carterton railway station and Matarawa railway station southwest of the township. Churches Carterton has eight congregations that regularly meet in the township.

Judaism In rabbinic Judaism sanctification means sanctifying God's name by works of mercy and martyrdom, while desecration of God's name means committing sin.Jewish Encyclopedia: Sanctification of the Name This is based on the Jewish concept of God, whose holiness is pure goodness and is transmissible by sanctifying people and things.Jewish Encyclopedia: Holiness Christianity In the various branches of Christianity sanctification usually refers to a person becoming holy, with the details differing in different branches. Justo L. Gonz√°lez, Essential Theological Terms, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2005, p. 155 =Roman Catholicism= The Catholic Church upholds the doctrine of sanctification, teaching that: According to the Catholic Encyclopedia \\"sanctity\\"Catholic Encyclopedia: Sanctity differs for God, individual, and corporate body. For God, it is God's unique absolute moral perfection. For the individual, it is a close union with God and the resulting moral perfection. It is essentially of God, by a divine gift. For a society, it is the ability to produce and secure holiness in its members, who display a real, not merely nominal, holiness. The Church's holiness is beyond human power, beyond natural power. Sanctity is regulated by established conventional standards. =Eastern Orthodoxy= Orthodox Christianity teaches the doctrine of theosis, whereby humans take on divine properties. A key scripture supporting this is 2 Peter 1:4. In the 4th century, Athanasius taught that God became Man that Man might become God.Athanasius: \\"On the Incarnation\\", Crestwood: Saint Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1989. p.93 Essentially, Man does not become divine, but in Christ can partake of divine nature. This Church's version of salvation restores God's image in man.Robert V. Rakestraw: \\"On Becoming God: An Evangelical Doctrine of Theosis,\\" Journal of Evangelical Theological Society 40/2 (June 1997) 257-269 One such theme is release from mortality caused by desires of the world.Veli- Matti K√§rkk√§inen: \\"One With God: Salvation as Deification and Justification,\\" Collegeville: Liturgical Press, 2004. p.18 =Lutheranism= Martin Luther, taught in his Large Catechism that Sanctification is only caused by the Holy Spirit through the powerful Word of God. The Holy Spirit uses churches to gather Christians together for the teaching and preaching of the Word of God.Lutheran Dogmaticians consider this the broad sense of sanctification. See Luther's Large Catechism, the Apostle's Creed, paragraph 53 and following Luther also viewed the Ten Commandments as means by which the Holy Spirit sanctifies. > \\"Thus we have the Ten Commandments, a commend of divine doctrine, as to what > we are to do in order that our whole life may be pleasing to God, and the > true fountain and channel from and in which everything must arise and flow > that is to be a good work, so that outside of the Ten Commandments no work > or thing can be good or pleasing to God, however great or precious it be in > the eyes of the world...whoever does attain to them is a heavenly, angelic > man, far above all holiness of the world. Only occupy yourself with them, > and try your best, apply all power and ability, and you will find so much to > do that you will neither seek nor esteem any other work or holiness.\\"From > Luther's Large Catechism, the Ten Commandments, paragraph 311 and following. > For further reading of Lutherans on Sanctification, see Sanctification in > Lutheran Theology by David P.

Lange, and Apostles‚Äô Creed, Third Article - Of Sanctification: > The Holy Ghost Works Through The Word by A. J. Kunde Pietistic Lutheranism heavily emphasizes the \\"biblical divine commands of believers to live a holy life and to strive for holy living, or sanctification.\\" =Anglicanism= A 2002 Anglican publishing house book states that ‚Äúthere is no explicit teaching on sanctification in the Anglican formularies‚Äù.Owen C. Thomas, Ellen K. Wondra, Introduction to Theology, 3rd ed (Church Publishing, 2002), 222. A glossary of the Episcopal Church (USA) gives some teaching: ‚ÄúAnglican formularies have tended to speak of sanctification as the process of God's work within us by means of which we grow into the fullness of the redeemed life.‚ÄùDon S. Armentrout and Robert Boak Slocum, eds, An Episcopal Dictionary of the Church (Church Publishing, 2000), s. v. \\"Sanctification\\", 467. Online at http://www.episcopalchurch.org/library/glossary/sanctification-0 Outside official formularies sanctification has been an issue in the Anglican Communion since its inception. The 16th century Anglican theologian Richard Hooker (1554-1600) distinguished between the ‚Äúrighteousness of justification‚Äù that is imputed by God and the ‚Äúrighteousness of sanctification‚Äù that comprises the works one does as an ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù result of being justified.Gibbs, Lee W. \\"Richard Hooker's Via Media Doctrine of Justification\\" in The Harvard Theological Review 74, no. 2 (1981): 211-220. https://www.jstor.org/stable/1509447 (accessed June 10, 2010). Jeremy Taylor (1613-1667) argued that justification and sanctification cannot be separated; they are ‚Äútwo steps in a long process‚Äù.Ralph McMichael, ed, The Vocation of Anglican Theology: Sources and Essays (SCM, 2014), 214-215. A 19th century Church of England work agreed with Jeremy Taylor that justification and sanctification are ‚Äúinseparable‚Äù. However, they are not the same thing. Justification is ‚Äúfound in Christ‚Äôs work alone‚Äù. ‚ÄúSanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit in us, and is a progressive work.‚ÄùAn Explanation of the Articles of the Church of England, Part 1 (Church of England, 1843), 53. Online at https://books.google.com/books?id=yTJWAAAAcAAJ&source;=gbs_navlinks_s =Reformed= Calvinist theologians interpret sanctification as the process of being made holy only through the merits and justification of Jesus Christ through the work of the Holy Spirit that are then reflected in man. Sanctification cannot be attained by any works-based process, but only through the works and power of the divine. When a man is unregenerate, it is his essence that sins and does evil. But when a man is justified through Christ, it is no longer the man (in his essence) that sins, but the man is acting outside of his character. In other words, the man is not being himself, he is not being true to who he is.Gerhard O. Forde, Donald L. Alexander, Sinclair B. Ferguson: \\"Christian spirituality: five views of sanctification\\", InterVarsity Press, 1988. p. 47-76 =Methodist= In Wesleyan-Arminian theology, which is upheld by the Methodist Church as well as by Holiness Churches, \\"sanctification, the beginning of holiness, begins at the new birth\\". With the Grace of God, Methodists \\"do works of piety and mercy, and these works reflect the power of sanctification\\". Examples of these means of grace (works of piety and works of mercy) that aid with sanctification include frequent reception of the sacrament of Holy Communion (work of piety), and visiting the sick and those in prison (work of mercy). Wesleyan covenant theology also emphasizes that an important aspect of sanctification is the keeping of the moral law contained in the Ten Commandments. As such, in \\"sanctification one grows to be more like Christ.\\" This process of sanctification that begins at the new birth (first work of grace) has its goal as Christian perfection, also known as entire sanctification (second work of grace), which John Wesley, the progenitor of the Methodist faith, described as a heart \\"habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor\\" and as \\"having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked\\". To John Wesley the work of entire sanctification was distinctly separate from regeneration and was \\"wrought instantaneously, though it may be approached by slow and gradual steps.\\" A more complete statement of Wesley's position goes like this: > \\"It is that habitual disposition of soul which, in the sacred writings, is > termed holiness; and which directly implies, the being cleansed from sin, > 'from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit;' and, by consequence, the > being endued with those virtues which were also in Christ Jesus; the being > so 'renewed in the spirit of our mind,' as to be 'perfect as our Father in > heaven is perfect.'\\"Wesley, J. (1872). The Works of John Wesley (Third > Edition, Vol. 5, p. 203). London: Wesleyan Methodist Book Room. This is the doctrine that by the power of God's sanctifying grace and attention upon the means of grace may cleanse a Christian of the corrupting influence of original sin in this life. It is expounded upon in the Methodist Articles of Religion:The United Methodist Church: The Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church - Of Sanctification Justification is seen as an initial step of acknowledging God's holiness, with sanctification as, through the grace and power of God, entering into it. A key scripture is Hebrews 12:14: \\"Follow after...holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord.\\" The Wesleyan Church (formerly known as the Wesleyan Methodist Church) states that sanctification has three components‚Äîinitial, progressive, and entire: John Wesley taught that outward holiness in the form of \\"right words and right actions\\" should reflect the inner transformation experienced through the second work of grace. =Pentecostalism= There are two Pentecostal positions on sanctification, entire sanctification and progressive sanctification. Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, USA, 2004, p. 319 Entire sanctification as a second work of grace, is the position of Pentecostal denominations that originally had their roots in Wesleyan-Arminian theology, such as the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, Church of God (Cleveland), Christian and Missionary Alliance , and the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel. William Kostlevy, Historical Dictionary of the Holiness Movement, Scarecrow Press, USA, 2009, p. 148 These denominations differ from the Methodist Churches (inclusive of the Holiness Movement) in that they teach the possibility of a third work of grace-- glossolalia. Progressive sanctification is the work of sanctification of the believer through grace and the decisions of the believer after the new birth. Roger E. Olson, The Westminster Handbook to Evangelical Theology, Westminster John Knox Press, USA 2004, p. 319 This is the position of other Pentecostal denominations, such as the Assemblies of God. Keith Kettenring, The Sanctification Connection: An Exploration of Human Participation in Spiritual Growth, University Press of America, USA, 2008, p. 29 Cecil M. Robeck, Jr, Amos Yong, The Cambridge Companion to Pentecostalism, Cambridge University Press, UK, 2014, p. 76 =Quakerism= George Fox, the founder of Quakerism, taught Christian perfection, also known in the Friends tradition as \\"Perfectionism\\", in which the Christian believer could be made free from sin. In his Some Principles of the Elect People of God Who in Scorn are called Quakers, for all the People throughout all Christendome to Read over, and thereby their own States to Consider, he writes in section \\"XVI. Concerning Perfection\\": The early Quakers, following Fox, taught that as a result of the New Birth through the power of the Holy Spirit, man could be free from actual sinning if he continued to rely on the inward light and \\"focus on the cross of Christ as the center of faith\\". George Fox emphasized \\"personal responsibility for faith and emancipation from sin\\" in his teaching on perfectionism. For the Christian, \\"perfectionism and freedom from sin were possible in this world\\". Some Quaker denominations were founded to emphasize this teaching, such as the Central Yearly Meeting of Friends. =Keswickianism= Keswickian theology, which emerged in the Higher Life Movement, teaches a second work of grace that occurs through \\"surrender and faith\\", in which God keeps an individual from sin. Keswickian denominations, such as the Christian and Missionary Alliance, differ from the Wesleyan-Holiness movement in that the Christian and Missionary Alliance does not see entire sanctification as cleansing one from original sin, whereas holiness denominations espousing the Wesleyan-Arminian theology affirm this belief. =The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints= In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, sanctification is viewed as a process and gift from God which makes every willing member holy, according to their repentance and righteous efforts, through the Savior Jesus Christ's matchless grace. Mark Juergensmeyer, Wade Clark Roof, Encyclopedia of Global Religion, SAGE Publications, USA, 2011, p. 1116 To become Sanctified, or Holy, one must do all that he can to live as Christ lived, according to the teachings of Christ. One must strive to live a holy life to truly be considered Holy.See D. Todd Christofferson, \\"Justification and Sanctification,\\" Ensign, June 2006; C. Eric Ott, \\"Sanctification,\\" Encyclopedia of Mormonism. In the Church's scriptural canon, one reference to sanctification appears in Helaman 3:35, in the Book of Mormon: Elder Dallin H. Oaks, then of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, also expounded on the meaning of sanctity. Islam In Islam, sanctification is termed as tazkiah, other similarly used words to the term are Islah-i qalb (reform of the heart), Ihsan (beautification), taharat (purification), Ikhlas (purity), qalb-is-salim (pure/safe/undamaged heart). Tasawuf (sufism), basically an ideology rather than a term, is mostly misinterpreted as the idea of sanctification in Islam and it is used to pray about saints, especially among Sufis, in whom it is common to say \\"that God sanctifies his secret\\" (\\"qaddasa Llahou Sirruhu\\"), and that the Saint is alive or dead.

H√∂rbiger did not arrive at his ideas through research, but said that he had received it in a \\"vision\\" in 1894. According to his ideas, ice was the basic substance of all cosmic processes, and ice moons, ice planets, and the \\"global ether\\" (also made of ice) had determined the entire development of the universe.https://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/the-weird-ice-world-cosmology- passionately-believed-by-hitler-and-other-top-nazis History By his own account, H√∂rbiger was observing the Moon when he was struck by the notion that the brightness and roughness of its surface was due to ice. Shortly after, he experienced a dream in which he was floating in space watching the swinging of a pendulum which grew longer and longer until it broke. \\"I knew that Newton had been wrong and that the sun's gravitational pull ceases to exist at three times the distance of Neptune,\\" he concluded. He worked out his concepts in collaboration with amateur astronomer and schoolteacher Philipp Fauth whom he met in 1898, and published it as Glazial-Kosmogonie in 1912. Fauth had previously produced a large (if somewhat inaccurate) lunar map and had a considerable following, which lent H√∂rbiger's ideas some respectability. It did not receive a great deal of attention at the time, but following World War I H√∂rbiger decided to change his strategy by promoting the new \\"cosmic truth\\" not only to people at universities and academies, but also to the general public. H√∂rbiger thought that if \\"the masses\\" accepted his ideas, then they might put enough pressure on the academic establishment to force his ideas into the mainstream. No effort was spared in popularising the ideas: \\"cosmotechnical\\" societies were founded, which offered public lectures that attracted large audiences, there were cosmic ice movies and radio programs, and even cosmic ice journals and novels. During this period, the name was changed from the Graeco-Latin to the more Germanic [WEL] (\\"World ice theory\\"). The followers of WEL exerted a great deal of public pressure on behalf of the ideas. The movement published posters, pamphlets, books, and even a newspaper The Key to World Events. Companies owned by adherents would only hire people who declared themselves convinced of the WEL's truth. Some followers even attended astronomical meetings to heckle, shouting, \\"Out with astronomical orthodoxy! Give us H√∂rbiger!\\" One of the early supporters of H√∂rbiger's ideas was Houston Stewart Chamberlain, the leading theorist behind the early development of the National Socialist Party in Germany in 1923. Two organizations were set up in Vienna concerned with the idea: the and the H√∂rbiger Institute. The first was formed in 1921 by a group of enthusiastic adherents of the idea, which included engineers, physicians, civil servants, and businessmen. Most had been personally acquainted with H√∂rbiger and had attended his many lectures. Among H√∂rbiger's followers was Viennese author Egon Friedell, who explained the World Ice Theory in his 1930 Cultural History of the Modern Age. Premise According to the idea, the solar system had its origin in a gigantic star into which a smaller, dead, waterlogged star fell. This impact caused a huge explosion that flung fragments of the smaller star out into interstellar space where the water condensed and froze into giant blocks of ice. A ring of such blocks formed, that we now call the Milky Way, as well as a number of solar systems among which was our own, but with many more planets than currently exist. Interplanetary space is filled with traces of hydrogen gas, which cause the planets to slowly spiral inwards, along with ice blocks. The outer planets are large mainly because they have swallowed a large number of ice blocks, but the inner planets have not swallowed nearly as many. One can see ice blocks on the move in the form of meteors, and when one collides with Earth, it produces hailstorms over an area of many square kilometers, while when one falls into the Sun, it produces a sunspot and gets vaporized, making \\"fine ice,\\" that covers the innermost planets. It was also claimed that Earth had had several satellites before it acquired the Moon; they began as planets in orbits of their own, but over long spans of time were captured one by one and slowly spiralled in towards Earth until they disintegrated and their debris became part of Earth's structure. One can supposedly identify the rock strata of several geological eras with the impacts of these satellites. It was believed that the destruction of earlier ice-moons were responsible for The Flood. The last such impact, of the \\"Tertiary\\" or \\"Cenozoic Moon\\" and the capture of our present Moon, is supposedly remembered through myths and legends. This was worked out in detail by H√∂rbiger's English follower Hans Schindler Bellamy; Bellamy recounted how as a child he would often dream about a large moon that would spiral closer and closer in until it burst, making the ground beneath roll and pitch, awakening him and giving him a very sick feeling. When he looked at the Moon's surface through a telescope, he found its surface looking troublingly familiar. When he learned of H√∂rbiger's idea in 1921, he found it a description of his dream. He explained the mythological support he found in such books as Moons, Myths, and Man, In the Beginning God, and The Book of Revelation is History. It was believed that our current Moon was the sixth since Earth began and that a new collision was inevitable. Believers argued that the great flood described in the Bible and the destruction of Atlantis were caused by the fall of previous moons. H√∂rbiger had various responses to the criticism that he received. If it was pointed out to him that his assertions did not work mathematically, he responded: \\"Calculation can only lead you astray.\\" If it was pointed out that there existed photographic evidence that the Milky Way was composed of millions of stars, he responded that the pictures had been faked by \\"reactionary\\" astronomers. He responded in a similar way when it was pointed out that the surface temperature of the Moon had been measured in excess of 100 ¬∞C in the daytime, writing to rocket expert Willy Ley: \\"Either you believe in me and learn, or you will be treated as the enemy.\\" Astronomers generally dismissed his views and the following they acquired as a \\"carnival\\". As Martin Gardner in Chapter Three of his Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science, H√∂rbiger's ideas have much in common with those of Immanuel Velikovsky.

Goehr was born in Berlin in 1932, the son of the conductor and composer Walter Goehr, a pupil of Arnold Schoenberg. In his early twenties he emerged as a central figure in the Manchester School of post-war British composers. In 1955‚Äì56 he joined Olivier Messiaen's masterclass in Paris. Although in the early sixties Goehr was considered a leader of the avant- garde, his oblique attitude to modernism‚Äîand to any movement or school whatsoever‚Äîsoon became evident. In a sequence of works including the Piano Trio (1966), the opera Arden Must Die (1966), the music-theatre piece Triptych (1968‚Äì70), the orchestral Metamorphosis/Dance (1974), and the String Quartet No. 3 (1975‚Äì76), Goehr's personal voice was revealed, arising from a highly individual use of the serial method and a fusion of elements from his double heritage of Schoenberg and Messiaen. Since the luminous 'white-note' Psalm IV setting of 1976, Goehr has urged a return to more traditional ways of composing, using familiar materials as objects of musical speculation, in contrast to the technological priorities of much present-day musical research.from the profile of Alexander Goehr on the Cambridge University Music Faculty: http://www.mus.cam.ac.uk/directory/alexander-goehr Life and works =Youth and studies = Alexander Goehr was born on 10 August 1932 in Berlin, and his family moved to Britain when he was only a few months old. Alexander came from an extremely musical family: his mother Laelia was a classically trained pianist, and his father was a Schoenberg pupil and pioneering conductor of Schoenberg, Messiaen (he conducted the UK premiere of the Turangal√Æla Symphony in 1953) and Monteverdi. As a child, Alexander grew up in a household permanently populated by composers, including M√°ty√°s Seiber and Michael Tippett. Although these premises point all too clearly to Goehr's future as a composer, his efforts as a composer were not much encouraged by his father, and he initially intended to study classics at Oxford University, but went instead to study composition at the Royal Manchester College of Music, with Richard Hall. In his composition classes Goehr became friends with young composers Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle and pianist John Ogdon, with whom he founded the New Music Manchester Group. A seminal event in Goehr's development was hearing the UK premiere of Messiaen's Turangal√Æla Symphony, conducted by his father. The interest in non-Western music (for instance Indian raga) sparked by the meeting with Messiaen's music combined with the interest in medieval modes shared with Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle largely influenced Goehr's first musical imaginings. His first acknowledged compositions date from these years: Songs for Babel (1951) and the Sonata for Piano, Op. 2, which was dedicated to the memory of Prokofiev, who had died that year. In 1955, Goehr left Manchester to go to Paris and study with Messiaen, and he remained in Paris until October 1956. The music scene of Paris would make a great impression on Goehr, who became good friends with Pierre Boulez and was involved in the serialist avant-garde movement of those years. Goehr experimented with Boulez's technique of bloc sonore, particularly in his first String Quartet of 1956‚Äì57. Boulez was a sort of mentor to Goehr in the late fifties, programming his new compositions in his concerts at the Marigny Theatre in Paris. It was not meant to last. Eventually Goehr's sensibility parted from Boulez's serialism. What disturbed Goehr was mainly his perception that by the mid-fifties, serialism had become a cult of stylistic purity, modelling itself on the twelve-tone works of Anton Webern. Reference to any other music was forbidden and despised, and spontaneous choice replaced with the combinatorial laws of serialism: > Choice, taste and style were dirty words; personal style, one could argue, > is necessarily a product of repetition, and the removal of repetition is, or > was believed to be, a cornerstone of classical serialism as defined by > Webern's late works [...] All this may well be seen as a kind of negative > style precept: a conscious elimination of sensuous, dramatic or expressive > elements, indeed of everything that in the popular view constitutes > music.Alexander Goehr, \\"A Letter to Pierre Boulez\\", in Finding the Key: > Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr, edited by Derrick Puffett (London and > Boston: Faber and Faber, 1998), 5. = Return to the UK, 1956‚Äì76 = Upon his return to Britain, Goehr experienced a breakthrough as a composer with the performance of his cantata The Deluge in 1957 under his father's baton. This is a big, ambitious work inspired by the writings of Sergei Eisenstein‚Äîone of Goehr's many extra- musical sources of inspiration. The soundworld could be seen to have derived from the twelve-tone cantatas of Webern, but it implicitly strives for the imposing harmonic tautness and full sonority of Prokofiev's Eisenstein cantatas. The genre of the cantata is one that Goehr would explore over and over again throughout his career. Indeed, following the success of The Deluge, Goehr was commissioned a new cantata, Sutter's Gold for choir, baritone and orchestra. However, the new work proved highly unpopular particularly with the singers, who found it impossibly difficult to perform. Indeed, the difficulty of performance is one of the reasons why Sutter's Gold was dismissed by critics upon its performance at the Leeds festival in 1961. This d√©bacle, however, had a constructive impact on Goehr: rather than dismissing criticism as the mere result of incompetence on the part of critics and performers, he genuinely faced the questions of the position of the avant-garde composer and his music: > If one wishes, one can just say that music has to be autonomous and self > sufficient; but how to sustain such a view when people who sing for pleasure > are deprived of true satisfaction in the performance of new work? [...] We > can talk about music in terms of the ideas that inform it; we can talk about > structure and techniques; we can talk about aesthetics or ethics or > politics. But we have to remember that while all this, realistic or not, is > of great importance to composers and to anyone who likes to follow what > composers are doing, what is being discussed is not the music itself but the > location of the music, the place where it exists.Alexander Goehr, \\"A Letter > to Pierre Boulez\\", in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr > (London: Faber and Faber, 1998), 5. Despite this, Goehr continued to compose choral works. Encouraged by his friendship with the choral conductor John Alldis, who was strongly committed to new music, Goehr composed his Two Choruses in 1962, which used for the first time the combination of modality and serialism which was to remain his main technical resource for the next 14 years. His search for a model of serialism that could allow for expressive freedom led him to his famous Little Symphony, Op. 15 (1963). It is a memorial to Goehr's conductor/composer father, who had unexpectedly died, and it is based upon a chord-sequence subtly modelled upon (but not quoting) the \\"Catacombs\\" movement from Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition (Goehr senior had made a close harmonic analysis of this unusual movement).Alexander Goehr, \\"Finding the Key\\", in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr (London: Faber and Faber, 1998), 291‚Äì292. This flexible approach to serialism, integrating harmonic background with bloc sonore and modality is very representative of the type of writing that Goehr developed as an alternative to the strictures of total serialism. It is no coincidence that Boulez‚Äîwho had earlier facilitated the performance of Goehr's music‚Äîrefused to programme Little Symphony: by 1963 Goehr had neatly departed from the style of his Parisian days. The sixties saw Goehr founding the Wardour Castle Summer School in Wiltshire with Peter Maxwell Davies and Harrison Birtwistle in 1964, and most importantly, the beginning of Goehr's preoccupation with opera and music theatre. In 1966 he wrote his first opera, Arden Must Die (Arden Muss Sterben), a thoroughly Brechtian setting of a Jacobean morality play which had uncomfortably contemporary political and social resonances. Goehr's striking setting of a text composed by Erich Fried in rhyming duplets makes the most of the idea of simple musical ideas that are continually distorted to a sinister and sarcastic effect. In 1967 he founded the Music Theatre Ensemble, and in 1971 he completed a three-part cycle for music theatre‚ÄîTryptich‚Äîmade up of three works: Naboth's Vineyard (1968) and Shadowplay (1970) were both explicitly written for Music Theatre Ensemble while the later Sonata about Jerusalem (1971) was commissioned by Testimonium, Jerusalem and performed by the Israel Chamber Orchestra and Gary Bertini. The end of the sixties also saw the beginning of a string of prestigious academic appointments for Goehr. In 1968‚Äì9 he was composer-in-residence at the New England Conservatory of Music, Boston, and went on to teach at Yale University as an associate professor of music. Goehr returned to Britain as visiting lecturer at Southampton University (1970‚Äì71). In 1971 he was appointed West Riding Professor of Music at the University of Leeds. Goehr left Leeds in 1976 when he was appointed Professor of Music at Cambridge University where he taught until his retirement in 1999. In Cambridge he became fellow of Trinity Hall. = 1976‚Äì96 = The year of Goehr's appointment at Cambridge coincided with a turning point in his output. In 1976, Goehr wrote a 'white-note' setting of Psalm IV. The simple, bright modal sonority of this piece marked a final departure from post-war serialism and a commitment to a more transparent soundworld. Goehr found a way of controlling harmonic pace by fusing his own modal harmonic idiom with the long abandoned practice of figured bass‚Äîthus achieving a highly idiosyncratic fusion of past and present. The output of the ensuing twenty years testified to Goehr's desire to use this new idiom to explore ideas and genres that had already become constant features of his work, such as the exploration of symphonic form: Goehr returned to symphonic form in his Sinfonia (1979) and Symphony with Chaconne (1987). Yet these years' output is disseminated most notably with a great number of ambitious vocal scores. A common feature of many of the vocal compositions of these years is the choice of subjects that function as allegories for reflection upon socio-political themes. The Death of Moses (1992) uses Moses' angry refusal to die as an allegory for the destiny of the victims of the Holocaust; while the cantata Babylon the Great is Fallen (1979) and the opera Behold the Sun (1985)‚Äîfor which Babylon the Great can be considered to be a sketch study‚Äîboth explore the themes of violent revolution via the texts from the Anabaptist uprising in M√ºnster of 1543. There are also non-political works such as the Sing, Ariel, that recalls Messiaen's stylised birdsong and sets a kaleidoscope of English poetry, and the opera Arianna (1995)‚Äîwritten on a Rinuccini libretto for L'Arianna, a lost opera by Monteverdi‚Äîis a typically idiosyncratic exploration of the soundworld of Italian Renaissance. Indeed, Goehr's engagement with Monteverdi's music dates back to the cantata The Death of Moses, which he described as \\"Monteverdi heard through Var√®se\\".Alexander Goehr, Programme note for The Death of Moses, BBC Proms 1992, Sunday 2 August 1992, p. 8. Arianna is also the piece that most overtly displays Goehr's intent to turn his reinvention of the past into a musical process that the audience can hear and identify: > The impression I aim to create is one of transparency: the listener should > perceive, both in the successive and simultaneous dimensions of the score, > the old beneath the new and the new arising from the old. We are to see a > mythological and ancient action, interpreted by a 17th-century poet in a > modern theatre.Alexander Goehr, Programme note for Arianna, The Royal Opera > House September/October 1995. = 1996‚Äì2014 = Although the last fifteen years of Goehr's output have not received the generous coverage (both in terms of academic writing and frequency of performance) of his previous work, they arguably represent the most interesting of Goehr's compositional phases. This last decade's output is heralded by the striking opera Kantan and Damask Drum of 1999, premiered at the Dortmund Opera. This opera consists in fact of two plays from the Japanese Noh theatre tradition, separated by a short kyogen humorous interlude. Typically for Goehr, the Japanese texts date back to the 15th century and have been adapted by the composer for setting. The lusciously tonal idiom does not indulge in orientalism, but rather the relationship between music and drama in Noh animates the whole work. Again, with Kantan and Damask Drum the search continues for an expressive synthesis; in this case, it is one of western and eastern, past and present. In the following years, Goehr devoted himself almost exclusively to chamber music. This is perhaps a response to the difficulties he experienced in the staging of his operas: the limited amount of financial support needed for a chamber music performance allows for music and performance venues that stray off the beaten path while allowing the composer more control over the quality of the performance.Interview given on 3 November 2007 for the BBC Music Matters Series. Through the chamber music medium Goehr gains an unprecedented rhythmic and harmonic immediacy, while his music remains ever permeable by the music and imagery of other times and places: the Piano Quintet (2000) and the Fantasie for cello and piano (2005) are haunted by rich sonorities of a thoroughly Ravel-like quality. The set of piano pieces Symmetries Disorder Reach (2007) is a barely disguised baroque suite haunted by the spirit of early Berg. Marching to Carcassonne (2003) flirts with neoclassicism and Stravinsky, and Manere for violin and clarinet (2008), based on a fragment of medieval plainchant, is a typical foray into the art of musical ornament. Also written in 2008 is Since Brass nor Stone for string quartet and percussion (2008), a memorial to Pavel Haas. Inspired by a Shakespeare sonnet, from which it borrows its title, this work is representative of the inventiveness of Goehr's recent chamber work. One reviewer described the soundworld of the work as 'hiccupping fugal patterns overlaid with intricate, delicate percussion [...] a magical garden of dappled textures'.Geoff Brown, review of the premiere of Since Brass Nor Stone on 10 July 2008 in St Andrew Holborn, London; published in The Times, 16.07.08 After an almost ten-year hiatus from the operatic medium, Goehr returned to the form with Promised End (2008‚Äì09), first performed by English Touring Opera in 2010 and based on Shakespeare's King Lear.English Touring Opera's website In the same year came When Adam Fell, a BBC commission for orchestra based on the chromatic bass from the Bach chorale 'Durch Adam's Fall ist alles Verderbt', first introduced to Goehr by his teacher Olivier Messiaen. To These Dark Steps/The Fathers are Watching (2011‚Äì12), written for tenor, children's choir and ensemble, sets texts by Israeli poet Gabriel Levin concerning the bombing of Gaza during the Iraq war and was premiered in a concert marking Goehr's 80th birthday. Largo Siciliano (2012) is a trio praised for its mastery of aural balance between the unusual combination of violin, horn and piano, 'from opening crepuscular melancholy to an ending which just seems to vanish into oblivion.'Christopher Morley, review of the premiere of Largo Siciliano on 5 July 2012 as part of Cheltenham Music Festival; published in Birmingham Post, 13 July 2012 The chamber symphony ...between the lines... (2013), the latest commission in a long-standing relationship with Birmingham Contemporary Music Group, is a monothematic work of four movements played without a break, in direct acknowledgement of Arnold Schoenberg's own Chamber Symphony op. 9. In 2004 Goehr was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Plymouth University.  Musical style  = Eclecticism and synthesis = All of Goehr's works are, in one way or another, studies in the synthesis of several, different elements. This is already apparent in his breakthrough piece, The Deluge (1957‚Äì58), which is inspired by Eisenstein's notes for a film based on a writing by Leonardo da Vinci; in other words Goehr writes music about a director's notes for a film based on the writings of a painter! Similarly, his inspiration for new compositions have ranged from the formal proportions of a late Beethoven Piano Sonata (Metamorphosis/Dance, 1973-4) to a painting by Goya (Colossus or Panic, 1990), to the sinister humour of Bertolt Brecht (Arden Must Die, 1966) or to the Japanese Noh theatre (Kantan and Damask Drum, 1999).Robin Holloway, 'Alexander Goehr at 70', in: Latham, Alison (ed.). 2003. Sing, Ariel: Essays and Thoughts for Alexander Goehr's Seventieth Birthday. With compact disc. Aldershot, England; Burlington, VT: Ashgate, pp. 3‚Äì4 Another red-thread element of The Deluge is that it takes its cue from an unfinished project‚ÄîEisenstein never carried out this particular project. Goehr will return time and again to the idea of carrying out a synthesis of fragments or unfinished projects left by other artists, albeit in a metaphorical way: the cantata The Death of Moses resonates with Schoenberg's unfinished Moses und Aron; the opera Arianna (1995) is the setting of the libretto of a lost opera by Monteverdi; and the posthumously published prose fragments by Franz Kafka lurk behind Das Gesetz der Quadrille (1979), Sur terre en l'air (1997) and Schlussgesang (1990). From a strictly technical musical level, Goehr's endeavour has long been that of unifying the contrapuntal rigour and motivic workings of the First Viennese School and Second Viennese School with a strong sense of harmonic pacing and sonority. It is indicative that Goehr should go to Paris not only to attend the classes of Messiaen at the Paris Conservatoire, but also to study counterpoint and serialism with Schoenberg scholar and composer Max Deutsch; even more indicative is the anecdote that Deutsch threw Goehr out of his house upon hearing that the young man intended to study with Messiaen as well as with him. Goehr's indebtedness to Messiaen is very strong, as is apparent in Goehr's lifelong commitment to modality as an integration to both serialism and to tonality, as well as his often bird-song inspired melodic writing, particularly in the cantata Sing, Ariel. = Engagement with the past = Goehr's interest in the musical past is far from an empty mannerism or a sign of musical conservatism, but rather an earnest, and constantly renewed exploration of his own musical roots. The music of the past does not hinder, in Goehr's view, the search for an innovative musical language: > In the composer's mind, vague memories fuse and grow into a new, conscious, > creative idea. An artist is realated to the tradition from which he comes, > and this bond has little to do with time or progress.Alexander Goehr, \\"A > Letter to Pierre Boulez\\", in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander > Goehr (London: Faber and Faber, 1998), 21. This attitude is concisely expressed by Goehr's striking assertion that \\"all art is new and all art is conservative\\". Understood in this way, his musical imagination of the past can be traced to three fundamental sources:  Walter Goehr  Although Goehr's personal relationship to his father was not unproblematic, Walter Goehr had a determining influence on his son via his work as a conductor: the composers whose work Walter championed‚ÄîArnold Schoenberg, Claudio Monteverdi, Modest Mussorgsky, Olivier Messiaen‚Äîfeature as a red-thread throughout Alexander's output. For instance, Goehr's Arianna uses the libretto of a lost opera by Monteverdi, Arianna abbandonata, and conjures up sonorities reminiscent of the Italian Renaissance. The quintet Five Objects Darkly (whose title is borrowed from a work by the painter Giorgio Morandi is a set of variations based on a musical fragment by Mussorgsky,Williams, Nicholas. 2001. \\"Goehr (2): (Peter) Alexander Goehr\\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ed. S. Sadie and J. Tyrrell. London: Macmillan. and the earlier Little Symphony uses the chordal structure of Mussorgsky's Catacombs' from Pictures at an Exhibition as a harmonic backbone.Alexander Goehr, 'Finding the Key' in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr(London: Faber and Faber, 1998), 291‚Äì292  Early twentieth-century modernist composers  Walter Goehr had studied with Schoenberg and was constantly surrounded by high calibre composers such as Seiber, Tippett, and others. Goehr's strong sense of indebtment to this generation, particularly to Schoenberg, had a lot to do with his ambivalent reaction to the Darmstadt School avant-garde of the fiftiesCf. 'I was originally attracted to serialism [...] But even as a student I felt a number of reservations. I couldn't share [Boulez's] attitude towards Webern [...]. Having been brought up in a very Schoenbergian household I preferred to see Webern's achievement as an extension of Schoenberg's ideals.'. Alexander Goehr, \\"A Letter to Pierre Boulez\\", in Finding the Key: Selected Writings of Alexander Goehr (London: Faber and Faber, 1998), (in which his friend and mentor Pierre Boulez was heavily involved).  Music of the baroque and classical tradition  Goehr's interest in these musics is surely part of his Schoenbergian heritage. Just like Schoenberg, Goehr refuses to view current composition as a practice that is independent of any musical tradition, but rather, he seeks in tradition the elements for the innovation of musical language. Alexander's search for a means of controlling structure and harmony in music led him in the late seventies to an innovating interpretation of the late baroque practice of figured bass in conjunction with his personal blend of modality and serialism. This is exemplified in his setting of Psalm IV and the ensuing correlated works: Fugue and Romanza on the notes of the fourth Psalm (1976 and 1977, respectively). Goehr is also committed to the reinvention of classical forms such as the Symphony, the classical Concerto, and the Baroque Suite (from his Suite Op. 11 of 1961 right up to Symmeteries Disorder Reach of 2007). Further sources of inspiration are the treatises on musical ornamentation by Carl Philip Emanuel Bach, and Monteverdi, whose synthesis of renaissance polyphony with the early baroque move towards homophony and the control of harmony clearly mirrors Goehr's own commitment to a harmonically expressive serialist practice.

Autoionizing states are usually short-lived, and thus can be described as Fano resonances rather than normal bound states. They can be observed as variations in the ionization cross sections of atoms and molecules, by photoionization, electron ionization and other methods. As examples, several Fano resonances in the extreme ultraviolet photoionization spectrum of neon are attributed to autoionizing states.Codling, K., Madden, R.P. and Ederer, D.L. (1967), Resonances in the Photoionization Continuum of Ne I (20-150 eV), Phys. Rev. 155, 26-37 DOI: https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRev.155.26 Some are due to one-electron excitations, such as a series of three strong similarly shaped peaks at energies of 45.546, 47.121 and 47.692 eV which are interpreted as 1s2 2s1 2p6 np (1P) states for n = 3, 4 and 5. These states of neutral neon lie beyond the first ionization energy because it takes more energy to excite a 2s electron than to remove a 2p electron. When autoionization occurs, the np ‚Üí 2s de- excitation provides the energy needed to remove one 2p electron and form the Ne+ ground state. Other resonances are attributed to two-electron excitations. The same neon photoionization spectrum considered above contains a fourth strong resonance in the same region at 44.979 eV but with a very different shape, which is interpreted as the 1s2 2s2 2p4 3s 3p (1P) state. For autoionization, the 3s ‚Üí 2p transition provides the energy to remove the 3p electron. Electron ionization allows the observation of some states which cannot be excited by photons due to selection rules. In neon for example again, the excitation of triplet states is forbidden by the spin selection rule ŒîS = 0, but the 1s2 2s2 2p4 3s 3p (3P) has been observed by electron ionization at 42.04 eV.Bolduc, E., Qu√©m√©ner, J.J. and Marmet, P. (1972) Autoionizing 2s2 2p4 3s 3l States of Ne and Related Ne‚àí Resonances, J. Chem. Phys. 57, 1957-66 DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.1678515 If a core electron is missing, a positive ion can autoionize further and lose a second electron in the Auger effect. In neon, X-ray excitation can remove a 1s electron, producing an excited Ne+ ion with configuration 1s1 2s2 2p6. In the subsequent Auger process a 2s ‚Üí 1s transition and simultaneous emission of a second electron from 2p leads to the Ne2+ 1s2 2s1 2p5 ionic state. Molecules, in addition, can have vibrationally autoionizing Rydberg states, in which the small amount of energy necessary to ionize a Rydberg state is provided by vibrational excitation.

It succeeded the Resettlement Administration (1935‚Äì1937). The FSA is famous for its small but highly influential photography program, 1935‚Äì44, that portrayed the challenges of rural poverty. The photographs in the FSA/Office of War Information Photograph Collection form an extensive pictorial record of American life between 1935 and 1944. This U.S. government photography project was headed for most of its existence by Roy Stryker, who guided the effort in a succession of government agencies: the Resettlement Administration (1935‚Äì1937), the Farm Security Administration (1937‚Äì1942), and the Office of War Information (1942‚Äì1944). The collection also includes photographs acquired from other governmental and nongovernmental sources, including the News Bureau at the Offices of Emergency Management (OEM), various branches of the military, and industrial corporations. In total, the black-and-white portion of the collection consists of about 175,000 black-and-white film negatives, encompassing both negatives that were printed for FSA-OWI use and those that were not printed at the time. Color transparencies also made by the FSA/OWI are available in a separate section of the catalog: FSA/OWI Color Photographs. The FSA stressed \\"rural rehabilitation\\" efforts to improve the lifestyle of very poor landowning farmers, and a program to purchase submarginal land owned by poor farmers and resettle them in group farms on land more suitable for efficient farming. Reactionary critics, including the Farm Bureau, strongly opposed the FSA as an alleged experiment in collectivizing agriculture‚Äîthat is, in bringing farmers together to work on large government-owned farms using modern techniques under the supervision of experts. After the Conservative coalition took control of Congress, it transformed the FSA into a program to help poor farmers buy land, and that program continues to operate in the 21st century as the Farmers Home Administration. Origins Walker Evans portrait of Allie Mae Burroughs (1936) The projects that were combined in 1935 to form the Resettlement Administration (RA) started in 1933 as an assortment of programs tried out by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. The RA was headed by Rexford Tugwell, an economic advisor to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. However, Tugwell's goal moving 650,000 people into of exhausted, worn-out land was unpopular among the majority in Congress. This goal seemed socialistic to some and threatened to deprive powerful farm proprietors of their tenant workforce. The RA was thus left with only enough resources to relocate a few thousand people from and build several greenbelt cities, which planners admired as models for a cooperative future that never arrived. The main focus of the RA was to now build relief camps in California for migratory workers, especially refugees from the drought-stricken Dust Bowl of the Southwest. This move was resisted by a large share of Californians, who did not want destitute migrants to settle in their midst. The RA managed to construct 95 camps that gave migrants unaccustomed clean quarters with running water and other amenities, but the 75,000 people who had the benefit of these camps were a small share of those in need and could only stay temporarily. After facing enormous criticism for his poor management of the RA, Tugwell resigned in 1936. On January 1, 1937, with hopes of making the RA more effective, the RA was transferred to the Department of Agriculture through executive order 7530. On July 22, 1937, Congress passed the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. This law authorized a modest credit program to assist tenant farmers to purchase land, and it was the culmination of a long effort to secure legislation for their benefit. Following the passage of the act, Congress passed the Farm Security Act into law. The Farm Security Act officially transformed the RA into the Farm Security Administration (FSA). The FSA expanded through funds given by the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act. Relief work One of the activities performed by the RA and FSA was the buying out of small farms that were not economically viable, and the setting up of 34 subsistence homestead communities, in which groups of farmers lived together under the guidance of government experts and worked a common area. They were not allowed to purchase their farms for fear that they would fall back into inefficient practices not guided by RA and FSA experts.Baldwin 1968 The Dust Bowl in the Great Plains displaced thousands of tenant farmers, sharecroppers, and laborers, many of whom (known as \\"Okies\\" or \\"Arkies\\") moved on to California. The FSA operated camps for them, such as Weedpatch Camp as depicted in The Grapes of Wrath. The RA and the FSA gave educational aid to 455,000 farm families during the period 1936-1943. In June, 1936, Roosevelt wrote: \\"You are right about the farmers who suffer through their own fault... I wish you would have a talk with Tugwell about what he is doing to educate this type of farmer to become self-sustaining. During the past year, his organization has made 104,000 farm families practically self-sustaining by supervision and education along practical lines. That is a pretty good record!\\"Sternsher 272 The FSA's primary mission was not to aid farm production or prices. Roosevelt's agricultural policy had, in fact, been to try to decrease agricultural production to increase prices. When production was discouraged, though, the tenant farmers and small holders suffered most by not being able to ship enough to market to pay rents. Many renters wanted money to buy farms, but the Agriculture Department realized there already were too many farmers, and did not have a program for farm purchases. Instead, they used education to help the poor stretch their money further. Congress, however, demanded that the FSA help tenant farmers purchase farms, and purchase loans of $191 million were made, which were eventually repaid. A much larger program was $778 million in loans (at effective rates of about 1% interest) to 950,000 tenant farmers. The goal was to make the farmer more efficient so the loans were used for new machinery, trucks, or animals, or to repay old debts. At all times, the borrower was closely advised by a government agent. Family needs were on the agenda, as the FSA set up a health insurance program and taught farm wives how to cook and raise children. Upward of a third of the amount was never repaid, as the tenants moved to much better opportunities in the cities.Meriam pp. 290‚Äì312 The FSA was also one of the authorities administering relief efforts in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico during the Great Depression. Between 1938 and 1945, under the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration, it oversaw the purchase of 590 farms with the intent of distributing land to working and middle-class Puerto Ricans. =Modernization= The FSA resettlement communities appear in the literature as efforts to ameliorate the wretched condition of southern sharecroppers and tenants, but those evicted to make way for the new settlers are virtually invisible in the historic record. The resettlement projects were part of larger efforts to modernize rural America. The removal of former tenants and their replacement by FSA clients in the lower Mississippi alluvial plain‚Äîthe Delta‚Äîreveals core elements of New Deal modernizing policies. The key concepts that guided the FSA's tenant removals were: the definition of rural poverty as rooted in the problem of tenancy; the belief that economic success entailed particular cultural practices and social forms; and the commitment by those with political power to gain local support. These assumptions undergirded acceptance of racial segregation and the criteria used to select new settlers. Alternatives could only become visible through political or legal action‚Äîcapacities sharecroppers seldom had. In succeeding decades, though, these modernizing assumptions created conditions for Delta African Americans on resettlement projects to challenge white supremacy.Jane Adams and D. Gorton, \\"This Land Ain't My Land: The Eviction of Sharecroppers by the Farm Security Administration,\\" Agricultural History Summer 2009, Vol. 83 Issue 3, pp. 323‚Äì51 =FSA and its contribution to society= The documentary photography genre describes photographs that would work as a time capsule for evidence in the future or a certain method that a person can use for a frame of reference. Facts presented in a photograph can speak for themselves after the viewer gets time to analyze it. The motto of the FSA was simply, as Beaumont Newhall insists, \\"not to inform us, but to move us.\\" Those photographers wanted the government to move and give a hand to the people, as they were completely neglected and overlooked, thus they decided to start taking photographs in a style that we today call \\"documentary photography.\\" The FSA photography has been influential due to its realist point of view, and because it works as a frame of reference and an educational tool from which later generations could learn. Society has benefited and will benefit from it for more years to come, as this photography can unveil the ambiguous and question the conditions that are taking place.Bill Ganzel, \\"FSA photography,\\" Farming in the 1930s (2003): 1‚Äì3. =Photography program= The RA and FSA are well known for the influence of their photography program, 1935‚Äì1944. Photographers and writers were hired to report and document the plight of poor farmers. The Information Division (ID) of the FSA was responsible for providing educational materials and press information to the public. Under Roy Stryker, the ID of the FSA adopted a goal of \\"introducing America to Americans.\\" Many of the most famous Depression-era photographers were fostered by the FSA project. Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, and Gordon Parks were three of the most famous FSA alumni. The FSA was also cited in Gordon Parks' autobiographical novel, A Choice of Weapons. =Photographers= Eleven photographers came to work on this project (listed in order in which they were hired): Arthur Rothstein, Theo Jung, Ben Shahn, Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Carl Mydans, Russell Lee, Marion Post Wolcott, Jack Delano, John Vachon, and John Collier.

The photographers produced images that breathed a humanistic social visual catalyst of the sort found in novels, theatrical productions, and music of the time. Their images are now regarded as a \\"national treasure\\" in the United States, which is why this project is regarded as a work of art. Chicago's rail yards by Jack Delano, circa 1943 Together with John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath (not a government project) and documentary prose (for example Walker Evans and James Agee's Let Us Now Praise Famous Men), the FSA photography project is most responsible for creating the image of the Depression in the United States. Many of the images appeared in popular magazines. The photographers were under instruction from Washington, DC, as to what overall impression the New Deal wanted to portray. Stryker's agenda focused on his faith in social engineering, the poor conditions among tenant cotton farmers, and the very poor conditions among migrant farm workers; above all, he was committed to social reform through New Deal intervention in people's lives. Stryker demanded photographs that \\"related people to the land and vice versa\\" because these photographs reinforced the RA's position that poverty could be controlled by \\"changing land practices.\\" Though Stryker did not dictate to his photographers how they should compose the shots, he did send them lists of desirable themes, for example, \\"church\\", \\"court day\\", and \\"barns\\". Stryker sought photographs of migratory workers that would tell a story about how they lived day-to-day. He asked Dorothea Lange to emphasize cooking, sleeping, praying, and socializing.Finnegan 43‚Äì44 RA-FSA made 250,000 images of rural poverty. Fewer than half of those images survive and are housed in the Prints and Photographs Division of the Library of Congress. The library has placed all 164,000 developed negatives online. From these, some 77,000 different finished photographic prints were originally made for the press, plus 644 color images, from 1600 negatives. Documentary films The RA also funded two documentary films by Pare Lorentz: The Plow That Broke the Plains, about the creation of the Dust Bowl, and The River, about the importance of the Mississippi River. The films were deemed \\"culturally significant\\" by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. World War II activities During World War II, the FSA was assigned to work under the purview of the Wartime Civil Control Administration, a subagency of the War Relocation Authority. These agencies were responsible for relocating Japanese Americans from their homes on the West Coast to Internment camps. The FSA controlled the agricultural part of the evacuation. Starting in March 1942 they were responsible for transferring the farms owned and operated by Japanese Americans to alternate operators. They were given the dual mandate of ensuring fair compensation for Japanese Americans, and for maintaining correct use of the agricultural land. During this period, Lawrence Hewes Jr was the regional director and in charge of these activities.Laurence I. Hewes, Final Report of the Participation of the Farm Security Administration in the Evacuation Program of the Wartime Civil Control Administration Civil Affairs Division Western Defense Command and Fourth Army, Farm Security Administration, United States Department of Agriculture, (San Francisco: 1942) Reformers ousted; Farmers Home Administration After the war started and millions of factory jobs in the cities were unfilled, no need for FSA remained. In late 1942, Roosevelt moved the housing programs to the National Housing Agency, and in 1943, Congress greatly reduced FSA's activities. The photographic unit was subsumed by the Office of War Information for one year, then disbanded. Finally in 1946, all the social reformers had left and FSA was replaced by a new agency, the Farmers Home Administration, which had the goal of helping finance farm purchases by tenants‚Äîand especially by war veterans‚Äîwith no personal oversight by experts. It became part of Lyndon Johnson's war on poverty in the 1960s, with a greatly expanded budget to facilitate loans to low-income rural families and cooperatives, injecting $4.2 billion into rural America.Baldwin 403 The Great Depression The Great Depression began in August 1929, when the United States economy first went into an economic recession. Although the country spent two months with declining GDP, the effects of a declining economy were not felt until the Wall Street Crash in October 1929, and a major worldwide economic downturn ensued. Although its causes are still uncertain and controversial, the net effect was a sudden and general loss of confidence in the economic future and a reduction in living standards for most ordinary Americans. The market crash highlighted a decade of high unemployment, poverty, low profits for industrial firms, deflation, plunging farm incomes, and lost opportunities for economic growth.

Biography Goehr was born in Berlin, where he studied with Arnold Schoenberg and embarked on a conducting career, before being forced as a Jew to seek employment outside Germany after working for Berlin Radio in 1932. He was invited to become music director for the Gramophone Company (later EMI), so he moved to London. In 1937, he conducted the London Philharmonic Orchestra in the premiere recording of Bizet's Symphony in C.CHARM (Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music). In London at Studio No. 1, Abbey Road for HMV, on 26 November 1937. During his years as a staff conductor for EMI, he conducted the orchestra for many recordings, including accompaniments for arias sung by Beniamino Gigli, Richard Tauber and Joseph Schmidt. In more popular items, his name appears on the record labels as 'G. Walter' or 'George Walter'. In addition, he conducted for many concerto recordings, including some by Benno Moiseiwitsch, Myra Hess and others. After the war he conducted for several smaller recording companies based in Europe, including for the concerto recordings of the short-lived Australian pianist Noel Mewton-Wood. As well as teaching composition in Britain he also instructed pupils in conducting, one of whom was the young Wally Stott, later known as Angela Morley. In England he worked for the Columbia Record Company, and between 1945 and 1948 was conductor of the BBC Theatre Orchestra (the predecessor of today's BBC Concert Orchestra); he was also a skilled arranger. He was one of many musicians of European origin and training recruited by Michael Tippett for the staff of Morley College. Goehr conducted many important premieres at Morley, including the first British performance of Monteverdi's Vespro della Beata Vergine of 1610. His first successful composition was Malpopita in 1931, an opera especially designed for radio broadcast. This work was not scheduled for its first live performance until 6 May 2004, in Berlin, Prenzlauer Berg, Abspannwerk Humboldt. In 1942, he made a new arrangement of Mussorgsky's piano suite Pictures at an Exhibition with a subsidiary piano part. In 1946, he arranged a number of Mussorgsky's piano pieces into the orchestral suite Pictures from the Crimea. In 1947, Goehr composed the music for the much acclaimed film Great Expectations, directed by David Lean. He wrote several other film scores. He was also well known for conducting film soundtracks, including A Canterbury Tale, for which his friend Allan Gray had composed the score.

The fraternity has over 225 chapters and colonies across the United States and abroad with over 15,500 undergraduate members over 300,000 lifetime initiates. The fraternity's vision statement is \\"To set the standard of integrity, intellect, achievement for our members, host institutions, and the communities in which we live.\\" History Georgia Institute of Technology Pi Kappa Alpha was founded on March 1, 1868, at 47 West Range (The Range) at the University of Virginia by six graduate students: Robertson Howard, Julian Edward Wood, James Benjamin Sclater Jr., Frederick Southgate Taylor, Littleton Waller Tazewell (Bradford) and William Alexander. On March 1, 1869, exactly one year after the Alpha chapter at the University of Virginia was formed, the Beta chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was founded at Davidson College. Theta chapter, at Rhodes College, took over the responsibilities of Alpha chapter when the Fraternity was in decline in its infancy. John Shaw Foster, a junior founder from Theta chapter, helped to reestablish Alpha chapter at the University of Virginia. Theta chapter is the longest continual running chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha, having been founded in 1878. After almost a decade of decline, Pi Kappa Alpha was \\"re-founded\\" as part of the Hampden‚ÄìSydney Convention, held in a dorm room at Hampden‚ÄìSydney College. The four delegates to the Hampden‚ÄìSydney Convention are referred to as the Junior Founders. Pi Kappa Alpha was not originally organized as a sectional fraternity; however, by constitutional provision it became so in 1889. It remained a southern fraternity until the New Orleans Convention in 1909 when Pi Kappa Alpha officially declared itself a national organization. Like many other social fraternities at the time, Pi Kappa Alpha limited its membership to white men. The race restriction was removed in 1964. Rituals Its rituals are based on Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Shield & Diamond Shield & Diamond is the official quarterly publication of Pi Kappa Alpha. It was first printed in December 1890 by Robert Adger Smythe, the then Grand Secretary and Treasurer, under the name The Pi Kappa Alpha Journal. The name was changed to Shield & Diamond in 1891. Foundation and educational programs =Pike University= Pike University is the name used for all of the fraternity's leadership programs. The program is administered by the fraternity's professional staff. Founded in 1948 as a 501(c)(3) tax exempt organization for charitable, literary & educational purposes. Events held by the university include International Convention, the Academy, the Chapter Executives Conference, and several regional Leadership Summits. Pike University grants more than $100,000 in scholarships each year. =The Pike Foundation= In 1948, Pi Kappa Alpha established and chartered the \\"Pi Kappa Alpha Memorial Foundation\\" as a 501(c)(3) organization. The foundation grants $350,000 in scholarships and grants to undergraduate members each year. It also provides funding to the fraternity and its chapters for leadership programs, scholarships, and chapter house facilities. The foundation grants initiation fee scholarships to undergraduates inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, Omicron Delta Kappa, Order of Omega, Phi Kappa Phi, and Tau Beta Pi honoraries. The Pike Foundation also maintains and operates the Memorial Headquarters in Memphis, Tennessee. This facility houses professional staffs, the Harvey T. Newell Library, and the Freeman Hart Museum. The building is a war memorial built in 1988 to recognize the military services of members who died in the line of duty. A Gold Star Memorial was dedicated on August 1, 2008. Some controversies and sexual assault cases In 1976, Samuel Mark Click, a pledge at Texas Tech University, was killed participating in a scavenger hunt as part of a hazing event. He was trying to collect a letter that was under a railroad tie when he was hit by a train. In 1988, three Pi Kappa Alpha members at Florida State University were charged in the sexual battery of a freshman female student. The victim was left in the hallway of another fraternity house. The case made national headlines for weeks. The fraternity members all struck plea deals, and the fraternity was banned from the school for twelve years. Pi Kappa Alpha was allowed to return to the school in 2000 despite strong protests. In 1988, several members of Pi Kappa Alpha were arrested for a sexual assault that took place at Stetson University. In 2002, Albert Santos, a pledge at the University of Nevada at Reno, drowned in a lake participating in a hazing ritual. He and several pledges were told to swim in a lake in their underwear but Santos could not swim. The fraternity was banned from the campus after his death. Santos' family sued the university and fraternity for negligence. In 2007, the chapter at the University of Central Florida was shut down after the fraternity racked up more than 20 misconduct and hazing violations. In 2008, 10 Pike members were arrested at Tulane University for pouring boiling hot water on pledges. The chapter was also accused of drugging and sexually assaulting several female students at the fraternity's annual bacchanal. Florida International University suspended the fraternity in 2013 after the discovery of photos on Facebook of hazing and drug deals, as well as sexually explicit photos of women taken without their consent. The UNC-Charlotte chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha was suspended after student placed in IC for alcohol-related hazing in 2013. In 2014 a county judge dismissed charges against three members, and found the fourth not guilty. The university found the fraternity guilty of hazing, and suspended its charter for eight years. In 2010, the chapter at Cornell University was placed on suspension for four years ‚Äúdue to its history of alcohol and hazing-related infractions over several years, which culminated in a Jan. 22, 2010, incident involving underage and high-risk drinking,‚Äù according to the Cornell Chronicle. The chapter was suspended again in March 2017 for violating university rules. In October 2012, the fraternity was suspended at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville following the hospitalization of a member for alcohol poisoning due to alleged \\"butt- chugging\\". In 2012, Pi Kappa Alpha pledge David Bogenberger died of a cardiac arrhythmia triggered by alcohol poisoning. According to police, Bogenberger and other pledges at an unsanctioned Northern Illinois University event were pressured into drinking large quantities of alcohol in a two-hour time. Bogenberger and 18 other pledges drank to unconsciousness. Five fraternity officers and 17 other members were convicted of misdemeanors in one of the largest hazing prosecutions in U.S. history. The chapter was suspended by the fraternity. In 2014, the leaders of the fraternity's University of Arkansas chapter were asked to resign following an unauthorized Martin Luther King, Jr. Day party that incorporated racist stereotypes. In 2014, the fraternity lost its charter at the University of Southern Mississippi following a hazing incident that led to the death of two mated flamingos. Pledges stole a flamingo from the local zoo, and in the struggle to defend its mate to her dying breath, the male was killed. The next morning, after being left on a bicycle path, the other died.Southern Mississippi fraternity rush prank goes awry, flamingo dies In 2018, the fraternity was allowed to return to the school. In April 2014, the fraternity lost its charter at the University of Virginia due to hazing pledges, however the school and the national fraternity agreed to let the chapter return for fall 2014 under an agreement that moved most Juniors and Seniors to early Alumni status and appointed a board of local fraternity alumni to oversee the group. In 2015, the former fraternity chapter president at Utah State University was charged with forcible sexual abuse, a felony, after allegedly inappropriately touching a female fellow student passed out at a party. In 2015, one member and four pledges of Pi Kappa Alpha from the University of Mississippi were arrested and charged with assault for leaving a Sigma Pi fraternity member with a concussion, broken ear drum, and broken teeth after a violent beating. The Pi Kappa Alpha member and pledges were trying to steal a donkey statue from the Sigma Pi house as part of a fraternity initiation task before the fight. The students involved were dismissed/expelled from the fraternity. In March 2015, the chapter at the University of South Carolina was suspended after a Pike member was found dead in a private home near campus that had beer kegs and St. Patrick Day decorations on the porch. The Richland County Coroner's Office called it a \\"suspicious death\\". In November 2016, the chapter at Louisiana State University placed itself voluntary suspension after a woman reported to authorities she was a victim of sexual battery by an unidentified white man in the backyard of the fraternity house during a \\"PIKE's Peak\\" party. However, the school's investigation of the chapter was closed in early December due to insufficient evidence and lack of contact with the victim. In March 2017, a Harris County Grand Jury indicted the University of Houston chapter for extreme hazing. Their pledges were severely deprived from adequate water, food, and sleep, and one was body slammed resulting in a lacerated spleen. The chapter was placed under suspension until 2023 and given a $10,000 fine. In May 2017, the chapter at California State University, Chico was charged with illegally cutting down 32 trees in the Lassen National Forest during an initiation of new pledges. They were also charged with possession of a firearm and conspiracy to commit offense or defraud the United States. The chapter was placed on suspension pending the outcome of the federal investigation. In October 2017, the chapter was sentenced to 9,800 hours of community service and a $4,000 fine after pleading guilty to cutting down and damaging trees in the Lassen National Forest by the U.S. District Court. On October 2, 2017 the chapter at Kennesaw State University was issued a cease and desist order by the university administration for repeatedly violating the student codes of conduct. In September 2017, the chapter at Iowa State University was suspended for misuse of alcoholic beverages, and for failure to appear at a university adjudication. The suspension was lifted on August 20, 2018. The chapter was placed on social probation for one year immediately after being lifted from suspension. In the fall of 2017, the chapter at University of Massachusetts Amherst was indefinitely suspended for hazing allegations. Members of the chapter were procuring alcohol for a minor during a hazing ritual which led to hospitalization due to alcohol poisoning.https://www.gazettenet.com/National- organization-suspends-UMass-fraternity-20411933 In March 2018, the chapter at Southern Methodist University was suspended for four and a half years for hazing pledges that included forcing them to drink alcohol, and forcing them to eat foods like onions and habanero peppers and drink milk.

The first game, Ridge Racer (1993), was originally released in arcades for the Namco System 22 hardware, later ported to the PlayStation two years later as a launch title. It was met with several sequels and spin-off games for multiple platforms, the latest being the iOS game Ridge Racer Draw & Drift (2016). Gameplay involves the player racing against computer-controlled opponents to be the first to finish in a race. Drifting is a core aspect of the series, and is used to keep speed while turning corners. Ridge Racer is a spiritual successor to Sim Drive (1992), a racing simulation game met with a limited release in Japanese arcades. Originally meant as an F-1 racing game, similar to Namco's own Pole Position and Final Lap series, it was instead replaced with racing on mountain roads, a popular trend for Japanese car enthusiasts at the time. The PlayStation version was a launch title for the console and an astounding success for Namco, prompting the creation of several sequels for arcades and home platforms. After Namco merged with Bandai in 2005, the series would become exclusive to consoles and later mobile phones. Several games in the franchise were released as launch titles for consoles. Earlier Ridge Racer games received critical acclaim for their graphics, gameplay and musical score, many citing it as a contributing factor to the success of the PlayStation in its early years. Later entries were criticized for straying too far from the source material and lack of content, with Ridge Racer Vita (2011) being listed among the worst video games ever made. The series is considered influential to the racing game genre. Games * Ridge Racer (1993) is the first entry in the series, originally released for arcades and running on the Namco System 22 arcade system. A PlayStation conversion was released in 1994 and 1995 as a launch title for the console. Two other versions of the game were released for arcades: Ridge Racer Full Scale, which featured a replica Eunos Roadster that the player sat in to control the game, and Ridge Racer: 3-Screen Edition, which used three different monitors to provide a peripheral vision effect, similar to Namco's earlier game Driver's Eyes (1991). A Japanese mobile phone version was released in 2000. * Ridge Racer 2 (1994) was released for arcades, running on the Namco System 22 hardware. It serves as an update to the original game, featuring multiplayer, a rear-view mirror, and a remixed soundtrack composed by Shinji Hosoe. * Rave Racer (1995) was released for arcades. It features two new tracks alongside the two present in the original Ridge Racer, and had linkable arcade cabinets that allowed for up to eight-person multiplayer. Home conversions for both the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows were announced in 1996, but were later cancelled. * Ridge Racer Revolution (1995) was released for the PlayStation. It is a modified home release of Ridge Racer 2 with three completely new and different tracks than the arcade and original games, new music, additional vehicles and multiplayer via the PlayStation Link Cable peripheral. * Rage Racer (1996) was released for the PlayStation. Alongside the introduction of series mascot Reiko Nagase, it featured customizable cars and a retries rule, both of which have become prominent throughout the franchise. It also features a more gritter and darker graphical style, a departure from the series' more colorful art style. * Pocket Racer (1996) is a spin-off arcade game released exclusively in Japan. Gameplay is near identical to the original Ridge Racer, however all the cars have instead been replaced with \\"super-deformed\\" Choro-Q- esc vehicles. A similar concept was included with Ridge Racer Revolution, titled Buggy Mode, which served as the inspiration for Pocket Racer. * R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 (1998) was released for the PlayStation, titled Ridge Racer Type 4 in Europe. It marks the debut of racing teams, which became a core aspect for all games to follow, and is the first in the series to use Gouraud shading for its graphics. Multiplayer modes are also present, being displayed in a split-screen orientation. In 2018, it was released as one of the built-in games on the PlayStation Classic mini console. * Ridge Racer 64 (2000) was released for the Nintendo 64 in North America and Europe; it was not developed by Namco, but by Nintendo Software Technology. It includes tracks from Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer Revolution, alongside new tracks and cars. * Ridge Racer V (2000) was released as a launch title for the PlayStation 2. An arcade version was released a year later, subtitled Arcade Battle. The original Ridge Racer game's free-form structure is instead replaced with Grand Prix races found in Ridge Racer Type 4. * R: Racing Evolution (2003) was released for the GameCube, PlayStation 2 and Xbox, serving as a spin-off of the franchise.

Common elements Gameplay of Ridge Racer (1994) The basic gameplay of the Ridge Racer series has remained relatively consistent throughout each installment. The objective is to race against computer-controlled opponents to finish each track in first place ‚Äî the player begins the game in last place, and have a limited number of laps around the track to complete where they can overtake opponents. Some entries have a time limit that the player must race against, with each completed lap extending the timer; if the timer reaches zero, the game ends regardless of which lap the player was on. Later entries remove the timer and instead requires the player to finish the race in a minimum-assigned place to advance to the next course. Unlike other racing games, which usually feature closed circuits, Ridge Racer instead has races laid out on streets, beaches, cities and mountains, taking place in the fictional coastal metropolis \\"Ridge City\\" ‚Äî circuit tracks are included in some entries. Nearly every entry in the series features the original tracks from Ridge Racer and Ridge Racer 2, sometimes modified to accompany for certain mechanics. Players can drift their car around corners to maintain speed, as most of the tracks were based on real-world locations that were not intended for race speeds. Ridge Racer Unbounded (2012) removes the drifting mechanic in favor of vehicular combat, similar to the Burnout franchise. The playable cars each have their own stats and mechanics, such as a faster speed or improved drifting. Many of these are also named after older Namco video games, including Dig Dug, Xevious, NebulasRay, Rolling Thunder, Bosconian and Solvalou. The PlayStation sequel R4: Ridge Racer Type 4 introduces the concept of racing teams for the series, all being named after Dig Dug, Mappy, Pac-Man, Xevious and Galaga. Similar to Namco's own Tekken series, several games feature classic Namco arcade games as short minigames that play during loading screens, a mechanic that was later trademarked by Namco ‚Äî the PlayStation home port of the original Ridge Racer features Galaxian, while Ridge Racers features New Rally-X. Completing these minigames will award the player with new tracks or cars, sometimes unlocking a full emulated version of the minigame to play. Reception The original Ridge Racer was very well received by critics for its 3D graphics, audio, and the drifting mechanics. It also received an admirable port to the PlayStation, where it became one of the best selling titles in the console's early lifetime. It is also considered as playing a part in giving Sony's system an edge over rival Sega's Saturn during 1994‚Äì1995. Its sequels during the 1990s were also highly successful, in particular Ridge Racer Type 4, often considered the series' best. Its sequel Ridge Racer V received more mediocre reviews, but the subsequent PSP title achieved very high praise. The series' 'idol' mascot Reiko Nagase, who has appeared in most games since 1995's Rave Racer, has often been rated among the most recognizable female characters in video games. In 1999, Next Generation listed the Ridge Racer series as number 11 on their \\"Top 50 Games of All Time\\", commenting that, \\"There are certainly better car simulations, but when it comes to fun, Ridge Racer, the game that helped make PlayStation cool, is the one we come back to.\\" 2006's Ridge Racer 7 is considered to have been the series' peak before declining in popularity - the Vita title was negatively received for various reasons, whilst the latest console game, Ridge Racer Unbounded, was marked with a departure from the drifting style and mechanics of what the series is known for, experimenting with a more destructive style similar to the Burnout series. The game was never as popular as its previous main titles and never had a Japanese release either.

Soda straw. A soda straw (or simply straw) is a speleothem in the form of a hollow mineral cylindrical tube. They are also known as tubular stalactites. Soda straws grow in places where water leaches slowly through cracks in rock, such as on the roofs of caves. Soda straws in caves rarely grow more than a few millimetres per year and may average one tenth of a millimetre per year.Hill, C A, and Forti, P, (1997). \\"Speleothem Growth Rates\\", Cave Minerals of the World, (2nd edition). [Huntsville, Alabama: National Speleological Society Inc.] pp 285 - 287 A soda straw can turn into a stalactite if the hole at the bottom is blocked, or if the water begins flowing on the outside surface of the hollow tube. Soda straws can also form outside the cave environment on exposed concrete surfaces as a type of calthemite, growing significantly faster than those formed on rock.  Formation  These tubes form when calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate dissolved in the water comes out of solution and is deposited. In soda straws, as each drop hovers at the tip, it deposits a ring of mineral at its edge. It then falls and a new drop takes its place. Each successive drop of water deposits a little more mineral before falling, and eventually a tube is built up. Stalagmites or flowstone may form where the water drops hit the cave floor. Soda straws are some of the most fragile of speleothems. Like helictites, they can be easily crushed or broken by the slightest touch. Because of this, soda straws are rarely seen within arms' reach in show caves or others with unrestricted access. Kartchner Caverns in southern Arizona has well-preserved soda straws because of its recent discovery in 1974 and highly regulated traffic. Outside the cave environment Straws can also form beneath man-made structures and grow significantly faster than in the natural cave environment.Hill, C A, and Forti, P, (1997).

In science fiction circles, however, it is commonly known to mean the hardware or machine parts implanted in the human body and acting as an interface between the central nervous system and the computers or machinery connected to it. More formally: :Cyberware is technology that attempts to create a working interface between machines/computers and the human nervous system, including the brain. Examples of potential cyberware cover a wide range, but current research tends to approach the field from one of two different angles: interfaces or prosthetics. Interfaces (\\"Headware\\") thumb The first variety attempts to connect directly with the brain.Fromherz, Peter; \\"Neuroelectronic Interfacing: Semiconductor Chips with Ion Channels, Nerve Cells, and Brain\\"; Nanoelectronics and Information Technology, pp. 781‚Äì810, Editor R. Waser, Wiley-VCH, Berlin, 2003 The data-jack is probably the best-known, having heavily featured in works of fiction (even in mainstream productions such as Johnny Mnemonic, the cartoon Exosquad, and The Matrix). It is the most difficult object to implement, but it is also the most important in terms of interfacing directly with the mind.Hooper, Simon (October 21, 2004) Brain chip offers hope for paralyzed CNN In science fiction the data-jack is the envisioned I/O port for the brain. Its job is to translate thoughts into something meaningful to a computer, and to translate something from a computer into meaningful thoughts for humans. Once perfected, it would allow direct communication between computers and the human mind. Large university laboratories conduct most of the experiments done in the area of direct neural interfaces. For ethical reasons, the tests are usually performed on animals or slices of brain tissue from donor brains. The mainstream research focuses on electrical impulse monitoring, recording and translating the many different electrical signals that the brain transmits. A number of companies are working on what is essentially a \\"hands-free\\" mouse or keyboard.Lusted, HS and Knapp, \\"RB Controlling Computers with Neural Signals\\". Scientific American, October 1996 This technology uses these brain signals to control computer functions. These interfaces are sometimes called brain-machine interfaces (BMI). The more intense research, concerning full in-brain interfaces, is being studied, but is in its infancy. Few can afford the huge cost of such enterprises, and those who can find the work slow-going and very far from the ultimate goals. Research has reached the level where limited control over a computer is possible using thought commands alone. After being implanted with a Massachusetts-based firm Cyberkinetics chip called BrainGate, a quadriplegic man was able to compose and check email.Khamsi, R. (2004). Paralyzed man sends e-mail by thought News@nature, doi:10.1038/news041011-9 Prosthetics (\\"Bodyware\\") thumb The second variety of cyberware consists of a more modern form of the rather old field of prosthetics. Modern prostheses attempt to deliver a natural functionality and appearance. In the sub-field where prosthetics and cyberware cross over, experiments have been done where microprocessors, capable of controlling the movements of an artificial limb, are attached to the severed nerve-endings of the patient. The patient is then taught how to operate the prosthetic, trying to learn how to move it as though it were a natural limb.Houston, V. L., Mason, C. P., Beattie, A. C., LaBlanc, K. P., Garbarini, M., Lorenze, E. J., & Thongpop, C. M. (1995). The VA- cyberware lower limb prosthetics-orthotics optical laser digitizer. Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development, 32(1), 55. Crossing over between prostheses and interfaces are those pieces of equipment attempting to replace lost senses. An early success in this field is the cochlear implant. A tiny device inserted into the inner ear, it replaces the functionality of damaged, or missing, hair cells (the cells that, when stimulated, create the sensation of sound). This device comes firmly under the field of prosthetics, but experiments are also being performed to tap into the brain. Coupled with a speech-processor, this could be a direct link to the speech centres of the brain.Branwyn, Gareth \\"The desire to be wired\\".

It has the greatest range and concentration of any of the 17-year cicadas. Every 17 years, Brood X cicadas tunnel en masse to the surface of the ground, lay eggs, and then die off in several weeks. The combination of long dormancy, simultaneous emergence of vast numbers, and short period before the nymphs' burrowing underground to safety, allows the brood to survive even massive predation. A periodical cicada from brood X 2004 - Princeton, NJ 2004 Brood X swarm in Ohio Detail of swarm Emergence holes located under flagstone Brood X's most recent appearance was in the spring and early summer of 2004 throughout an area roughly enclosed by Illinois, Michigan, New York and Georgia. The next regular appearances will be in 2021 and 2038. However, significant numbers of periodical cicadas, believed to be Brood X emergents that were four years early, appeared throughout the brood's range in 2000 and in the Baltimore, Maryland-Washington, D.C., area in May 2017. .  History  The first known description of an emergence of Brood X appeared a May 9, 1715, entry in the journal of Rev. Andreas Sandel, the pastor of Philadelphia's \\"Gloria Dei\\" Swedish Lutheran Church. In 1737, botanist John Bartram wrote a letter that described the periodicity of the brood's emergences and his 1732 observations of the insect's insertion of their eggs into the small branches of trees northwest of Philadelphia.(1) (2) Kritsky, 2004, pp. 44-46. Bartram later recorded in greater detail within two manuscripts the brood's May 1749 emergence.(1) Kritsky, 2004, pp. 46-47. (2) Pehr Kalm, a Swedish naturalist visiting Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1749 on behalf of his nation's government, observed in late May an emergence of Brood X. Republished by Knowledge Bank: The Ohio State University Libraries and Office of the Chief Information Officer. Retrieved 2012-10-02. When reporting the event in a paper that a Swedish academic journal published in 1756, Kalm wrote: > The general opinion is that these insects appear in these fantastic numbers > in every seventeenth year. Meanwhile, except for an occasional one which may > appear in the summer, they remain underground. > There is considerable evidence that these insects appear every seventeenth > year in Pennsylvania. Kalm then described documents (including that of Rev. Sandel and one that he had obtained from Benjamin Franklin) that had recorded in Pennsylvania the emergence from the ground of large numbers of cicadas during May 1715 and May 1732. He noted that the people who had prepared these documents had made no such reports in other years. Kalm further noted that others had informed him that they had seen cicadas only occasionally before the insects appeared in large swarms during 1749. He additionally stated that he had not heard any cicadas in Pennsylvania and New Jersey in 1750 in the same months and areas in which he had heard many in 1749. The 1715 and 1732 reports, when coupled with his own 1749 and 1750 observations, supported the previous \\"general opinion\\" that he had cited. Kalm summarized his findings in a book translated into English and published in London in 1771,Kalm, 1771, pp. 212-213. stating: > There are a kind of Locusts which about every seventeen years come hither in > incredible numbers .... In the interval between the years when they are so > numerous, they are only seen or heard single in the woods.(1) Kalm, 1771, > pp. 6-7. > (2) Moses Bartram, a son of John Bartram, described the 1766 emergence of Brood X in his Observations on the cicada, or locust of America, which appears periodically once in 16 or 17 years. Bartram noted that upon hatching from eggs deposited in the twigs of trees, the young insects ran down to the earth and \\"entered the first opening that they could find\\". He reported that he had been able to discover them below the surface, but that others had reportedly found them deep. In April 1800, Benjamin Banneker, who lived near Ellicott's Mills, Maryland, wrote in his record book that he recalled a \\"great locust year\\" in 1749, a second in 1766 during which the insects appeared to be \\"full as numerous as the first\\", and a third in 1783. He predicted that the insects \\"may be expected again in they year 1800 which is Seventeen Since their third appearance to me\\".(1) (2)  Popular culture  This is apparently the brood that emerged in 1936, inspiring Ogden Nash's poem \\"Locust-Lovers, Attention!\\", published in The New Yorker on June 20, 1936, and later reprinted in his collection I'm a Stranger Here Myself. Bob Dylan's song \\"Day of the Locusts\\" on his 1970 album New Morning refers to the Brood X cicadas that were present in Princeton, New Jersey, in June 1970 when Dylan received an honorary degree from Princeton University.(1) (2) (3) (4)  Notes   References   Further reading  * \\"Selected Internet Resources ‚Äì 17-Year Periodical Cicadas (2004)\\", Science Reference Services, Library of Congress  External links  * Brood X map * 2011 Tennessee Cicadas: Noise and Mating * Cicadas Fauna of the Eastern United States ","title":"Brood X"},{"id":"594944","text":"Frederick Reiken (born 1966) is an American author from Livingston, New Jersey He has published three novels to critical acclaim, and he teaches creative writing at Emerson College.  Early life and education  Reiken was born in New Jersey in 1966, and he attended the Pingry School. He earned a B.A. in Biology at Princeton University in 1988, where for his senior thesis he researched the behavioral ecology of island feral horses. He earned an M.F.A. at the University of California, Irvine, in 1992. Reiken is married and has two daughters.  Career  Reiken began thinking of himself as a writer after a poetry class at Princeton with J. D. McClatchy. In addition, Paul Auster's introductory fiction course and John McPhee's \\"Literature of Fact\\" course encouraged him to follow both his passions, science and writing. Following graduation in 1988, he went to the Negev desert as a wildlife biology researcher studying the population dynamics of Persian onagers, a species of wild ass. After completing his M.F.A., in 1992‚Äì1993 he was an artist-in- residence and then assistant director at Cummington Community of the Arts. From 1992 to 1998, he was a reporter, nature writer, and columnist at the Daily Hampshire Gazette. In 1997 he published his first novel. In 1992, he began writing sketches that would eventually become his second novel, published in 2000. His third novel was published in 2010. Reiken's essays and short stories have been published in The New Yorker, Western Humanities Review, Glimmer Train, and The Writer's Chronicle. Since 1999, Reikea has taught creative writing at Emerson College in Boston.  Critical response  Reiken's first novel, The Odd Sea (1998), won the Hackney Literary Award and was selected one of the best first novels of the year by Library Journal and Booklist. Jane Vandenburgh of The New York Times said the novel covers \\"mainly psychological terrain\\", of a family \\"who must somehow cope with the mysterious disappearance of the oldest son, 16-year-old Ethan...which eloquently remind us that the unfathomable can indeed happen, that the unbearable must be bravely withstood\\". Judith Rosen wrote it is \\"a contemporary tale of loss based loosely on The Odyssey\\". Christopher Lehmann-Haupt said it is \\"a haunting first novel that takes a horrifying family calamity and turns it into a form of magic... [Reiken] has skillfully balanced this pain against the hopefulness of the narrator.\\" Reiken's second novel, The Lost Legends of New Jersey (2000), was listed on The New York Times \\"Notable Book\\" list. Critic Gary Krist wrote, \\"Whether he's depicting the mournful uneasiness of two siblings on a last moonlit bike ride or the bewilderment of an estranged father giving himself over to the healing power of a Jacques Cousteau special, Reiken knows how to charge the quietest domestic scenes with consequence and emotion.\\" His third novel, Day for Night (2010), was favorably reviewed by Patrick Ness of The Guardian, who wrote it is \\"a portmanteau novel: discrete stories from different points of view that combine to tell a larger narrative\\". S. Kirk Walsh of The Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"A thought- provoking, intricate portrait of the far-reaching, intergenerational implications of the Holocaust ‚Äîand how fortuitous circumstances can bring people from both sides of a tragedy closer together, and, in some cases, further apart.\\"  Awards and honors  * 1997 Hackney Award for First Novel, The Odd Sea * 2000 New York Times Notable Books of the Year, The Lost Legends of New Jersey * 2000 Los Angeles Times Best Books of the Year, The Lost Legends of New Jersey * 2010 Finalist for the Los Angeles Times, Book Prize, Day for Night * Best novels of 2010, The Washington Post, Day for Night References  External links  NPR interview with Scott Simon, May 8, 2010 20th-century births Living people 20th- century American male writers 21st-century American male writers 20th-century American novelists 21st-century American novelists American male novelists Emerson College faculty Novelists from Massachusetts People from Livingston, New Jersey Pingry School alumni Princeton University alumni University of California, Irvine alumni ","title":"Frederick Reiken"},{"id":"594945","text":"The year 1886 in architecture involved some significant architectural events and new buildings.

A car dealership can either be a franchised dealership, which is a retailer that sells new and used cars, or a used car dealership which only sells used cars. In most cases franchised dealerships include certified pre-owned vehicles, employ trained automotive technicians, and offer financing. In the United States, direct manufacturer auto sales are prohibited in almost every state by franchise laws requiring that new cars be sold only by dealers. Used car dealers carry cars from many different manufacturers, while new car dealerships are generally franchises associated with only one manufacturer. Some new car dealerships may carry multiple brands from the same manufacturer. In some locales, dealerships have been consolidated and a single owner may control a chain of dealerships representing several different manufacturers. New car dealerships also sell used cars, and take in trade-ins and/or purchase used vehicles at auction. Most dealerships also provide a series of additional services for car buyers and owners, which are sometimes more profitable than the core business of selling cars. Selling cars Maxwell, Briscoe dealership A Monroney sticker on window Most car dealerships display their inventory in a showroom and on a car lot. Under U.S. federal law, all new cars must carry a sticker showing the offering price and summarizing the vehicle's features. Salespersons, usually those who only work on commission, negotiate with buyers to determine a final sales price. In many cases, this includes negotiating the price of a trade-in‚Äîthe dealer's purchase of the buyer's current automobile. Negotiation from the dealership's perspective is the actual to-and-fro that occurs when a salesperson works out a deal to a point where the customer is seriously considering the vehicle and makes an offer on the new vehicle, often including the customer's current vehicle as part of the deal. The salesperson then brings the offer, plus a sign of good faith from the customer, which can be a check with a deposit or a credit card to the sales manager where the monthly payment options and various pricing options that result are returned after the sales manager enters the information received from the salesperson into a CRM (customer relations management) computer program. The result is referred to as \\"desking\\" the deal. This is the final step of the negotiation process. The information generated during the desking phase includes payment and pricing options and it usually requires the customer and sales manager to sign off on the option chosen. The next step is a purchase and sales agreement or a sales agreement and the actual monetary downpayment is generated. The manager and customer sign this paperwork and then the customer is handed off to the \\"box\\" or the finance and insurance office where various add-ons are often sold that include special waxing, wheel protection, or often, extended warranty services. The final paperwork is also printed out at this phase. While some may believe that desking is part of the negotiation process, it only occurs once the salesperson has a legitimate offer on the vehicle from the customer and is able to hand the sales manager a token of good faith, as noted. A car dealer orders vehicles from the manufacturer for inventory and pays interest (called flooring or floorplanning). Dealer holdbacks are a system of payments made by the manufacturers to their dealers. The holdback payments assist the dealer's ability to stock their inventory of vehicles and improve the profitability of dealers. Typically the holdback amount is around 1% to 3% of the vehicles' manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP). Hold- back is usually not a negotiable part of the price a consumer would pay for the vehicle, but dealers will \\"give up\\" the dealer holdback to get rid of a car that has been sitting in its inventory for a long time, or if the additional sale will bring them up to the manufacturer's additional incentive payments for reaching unit bonus targets. The holdback was originally designed to help offset the cost the new car dealer has for paying interest on the money that is borrowed to keep the car in inventory but is in effect lowering the dealer's gross profit, and thus the sales commissions paid to employees. The holdback allows dealerships to promote at- or near-invoice price sales and still achieve comfortable profits on such transactions. With the advent of the Internet, the process of selling cars has undergone a considerable change. More than 70% of car purchases in the United States start with research on the Internet. This empowers the buyers with the knowledge of features of comparable cars and the prices and discounts offered by different dealers within the same geographic area. This helps the buyers during price negotiations and puts further pressure on the profit margin of the dealer.  Trading for cars  To an average dealer, the actual cash value of a trade is an opinion of what the vehicle could reasonably be sold for at auction in six weeks to three months time, less any reconditioning costs should the dealer be unable or unwilling to re-sell the trade to the public. Since most states have requirements for a dealer to warranty or even guarantee a used vehicle for a certain amount of time and or mileage if sold to the public at a certain price, a dealer must make a profit selling the previously traded car (now a used car). Trade in value is an important facet of the car deal. Trade value estimates can be found at sites such as NADA,KBB, Edmunds, CarGurus and Consumer Reports. However, most of these values are estimated from a theoretical chart that may or may not be based on recent average sales prices of a particular make and model. If a particular make and model has less accurate data available from recent auction prices the dealer will be more cautious in the appraisal of the car. Inputting an identical used car on each of the above sites will render different values. Sometimes these values will differ slightly, while at other times their sites may differ significantly. A dealer may have a manager who appraises each vehicle offered for trade. This person will often be the person who also attends used car auctions, often buying and selling on behalf of the dealer. This person will have a realistic idea of the actual cash value of the trade. A dealer will look at a trade for body damage, windshield damage, engine noise, and known problems with a particular model, and price it to re-sell it at a profit. The better way to get a real idea of what a trade car's value is to go to at least three dealers and ask them what they would pay for a trade outright. One or more dealers that handle that particular make and model when sold new should be consulted.  Additional services  Most car dealers offer a variety of financing options for the purchase of cars, including loans and leases. Financing can be highly profitable for dealerships. There have been some scandals involving discriminatory or predatory lending practices, and as a result, vehicle financing is heavily regulated in many states. For example, in California, there must be several signs prominently posted on the premises,California Vehicle Code Sections 11709, 11709.1, 11709.2 and 11709.3. and the contract must contain several prominent warnings, such as the words \\"THERE IS NO COOLING-OFF PERIOD.\\" Although the terms of installment contracts are negotiated by the dealer with the buyer, few dealers actually make loans directly to consumers. In the business such dealers are called \\"Buy Here Pay Here\\" dealerships. These stores are able to make loans directly to customers because they have some means of recovering the vehicle if the customer defaults on the loan. The means by which \\"Buy Here Pay Here\\" dealers can recover a vehicle vary by state. Most dealers utilize indirect lenders. This means that the installment loan contracts are immediately \\"assigned\\" or \\"resold\\" to third-party finance companies, often an offshoot of the car's manufacturer such as GM Financial, Ally Financial, or banks, which pay the dealer and then recover the balance by collecting the monthly installment payments promised by the buyer. To facilitate such assignments, dealers generally use one of several standard form contracts preapproved by lenders. The most popular family of contracts for the retail installment sale of vehicles in the U.S. are sold by business process vendor Reynolds and Reynolds; their contracts have been the subject of extensive (and frequently hostile) judicial interpretation in lawsuits between dealers and customers. Sometimes the dealer has the option of marking up the interest rate of the contract and retaining a portion of that markup. For example, a bank may give a wholesale money rate of 6.75% and the dealer may give the consumer an interest rate of 7.75%. The bank would then pay the dealer the difference or a portion thereof. This is a regular practice because the dealership is selling the contract to a bank just like it sold a car to the customer. Most banks or states strictly limit the amount a contract rate may be marked up (by giving a range of rates at which they will buy the contract). In many cases this amounts to little difference in the customer's payment as the amount borrowed is small by comparison to a mortgage and the term shorter. Customers may also find that a dealer can get them better rates than they can with their local bank or credit union. However, manufacturers often offer a low interest rate OR a cash rebate, if the vehicle is not financed through the dealer. Depending upon the amount of the rebate, it is prudent for the consumer to check if applying a larger rebate results in a lower payment due to the fact that s/he is financing less of the purchase. For example, if a dealer has an interest rate offer of 7.9% financing OR a $2000.00 rebate and a consumer's lending source offers 8.25%, a consumer should compare at the credit union what payments and total interest paid would be, if the consumer financed $2000.00 less at the credit union. The dealer can have their lending institution check a consumer's credit. A consumer can also allow his or her lending source to do the same and compare the results. Most financing available at new car dealerships is offered by the financing arm of the vehicle manufacturer or a local bank. Dealers may also offer other services, typically through the Finance and Insurance office. These additional services can include: * Service contracts: While any vehicle sold in the United States now comes standard with some degree of manufacturer's warranty coverage, customers have a wide range of choices to cover their vehicle from mechanical failure beyond that point. Service contracts may have the same terms of coverage as the vehicle's original manufacturer's warranty, but often they do not. Often service contracts carry a deductible as might any insurance contract. Because of the vast number of choices, it is important for consumers to be aware of the coverages before entering into an agreement. Usually these service contracts do not cover regular maintenance items such as brakes, fluids, or filters. In some states, particularly Florida, the cost of such agreements is heavily regulated. There are three main types of service contracts offered. The first is offered by the manufacturer through the dealership and is usually good at any dealership in the US that has that same franchise. When warranty repair work is required, the dealer submits a claim to the manufacturer and is reimbursed for the repair less the deductible paid by the consumer. Under this type of service agreement there is usually no incentive for the dealer to do anything but repair the car as reimbursement from the manufacturer is usually profitable. The second service contract is usually a simple insurance policy that the dealer purchases wholesale and is administered through a third party working for the dealer. This \\"third party\\" can often be a major insurance company. This money collected by the dealer from the consumer is put in a \\"reserve\\" fund for the length and / or term of the service contract. When a repair is required the dealer authorizes the repair with the third party administrator, usually before the repair is done. The third party deducts the repair expense from the dealer's reserve fund. The fewer payments or deductions made on the service contract the greater the profit to the dealer as any unused portion of the \\"reserve\\" is given back to the original selling dealer less an administration fee when the service contract retires. The third type of service contract can be purchased directly from a few automobile insurance companies. * GAP insurance: GAP insurance is protection for the loan in the event that the vehicle is lost as the result of an accident or theft. A GAP policy ensures that in the event of a total loss, the remaining payments are made on the loan so that a customer does not have to pay for a vehicle he or she no longer possesses. Many states regulate GAP insurance (New York, for example, does not allow dealerships to profit from the sale of GAP insurance). * Credit/Life/Disability insurance: It is important to note that this kind of insurance is a profit center for the dealership, working similarly to the second type of service contract described above in this article and cannot be required as a condition of the loan. Customers / Borrowers often have the option of purchasing protection for their loan should the borrower become disabled and unable to work for a period during the time the borrower is required to make payments. Often the coverage begins on the 31st or 32nd day of disability: Meaning the borrower has to be unable to work for a period greater than 30 days before a claim can be filed. Often the borrower is required to submit paperwork to validate a disability claim. Credit Life insurance will usually cover the entire remaining balance of a loan if the borrower dies within the term of the contract. Customers can often obtain this coverage from their own insurance companies. Consumers should compare rates and policies with their own insurance companies. See Consumer Reports for their opinion * Aftermarket accessories: Many dealerships offer accessories that are not offered by the manufacturer directly. These can be dangerous for consumers as some dealerships engage in illegal \\"payment packing\\"---that is, quoting an inflated monthly payment for the car in order to entice customers to agree to purchase aftermarket products offered at inaccurately low costs. One salesman for an accessories distributor was fired after he started asking questions about the legality of this practice; the resulting jury verdict of $480,003 against his former employer for wrongful termination in violation of public policy was upheld in full by a California appellate court in 2007.Casella v. SouthWest Dealer Services, Inc., 157 Cal. App. 4th 1127 (2007). As with Credit/Life/Disability insurance, there are many ways a consumer can purchase these options outside the dealership. * Maintenance agreements: Many dealerships that have their own service shops will offer pre- paid maintenance agreements. These are sometimes offered directly through the manufacturer (such as Saturn's Basic Care or Car Care programs) or by the dealership alone. Because of the vast differences in programs that can exist from dealership to dealership, it is important to know what is covered under the plan and what are the recommended service intervals (see below). *Lease Here Pay Here Contracts: With lease to purchase programs, customers are given a vehicle to lease for a time period that can range from 12 months up to 36 months. What makes this unique is the fact that these vehicle are used as opposed to new vehicle typically obtained from a new car dealer. The dealership that leases these cars is often scrutinized due to the fact that they normally serve the public that do not have strong financial abilities to maintain the obligation. The dealers are not held to the lending standards that most banks are, and also at times of bankruptcy are completely exempt in times of default leading the car dealership with the opportunity to repossesses at any time regardless of breach of contract. Some other pro- advocates say the monthly obligation on leases are cheaper because there is no sales taxes on the vehicle as opposed to the amount a buyer may pay if they are making loan payments on a new or used car purchase. Car dealers also provide maintenance and in some cases, repair service for cars. New car dealerships are more likely to provide these services, since they usually stock and sell parts and process warranty claims for the manufacturers they represent. Maintenance is typically a high-margin service and represents a significant profit center for automotive dealers.  Regulation  In the United States, most aspects of operating a car dealership are regulated at the state level. Car titles are issued and transferred by the individual states through their respective Departments of Motor Vehicles. The purchase price of a vehicle usually includes various fees which the dealer forwards to the state DMV to transfer the vehicle's title to the buyer. In many states, the DMVs also license and regulate car dealerships. In many states, car dealerships are capable of submitting all necessary forms to the DMV on behalf of the customer and are authorized to issue temporary paperwork to the customer to prove that the transaction is in process, allowing the customer to avoid a trip to the nearest DMV office. Consumer complaints against car dealerships are usually investigated by the Attorney General's office in the state where the dealership is located. In states where the DMV licenses and regulates car dealerships, the DMV may have responsibility for initially handling consumer complaints and the state AG's office becomes involved only when there is evidence that a dealer may have committed a crime. Perceptions =Customer experience= According to one survey, more than half of dealership customers would prefer to buy directly from the manufacturer, without any monetary incentives to do so. An analyst report of a direct sales model is estimated to cut the cost of a vehicle by 8.6%.Economic Effects of State Bans on Direct Manufacturer Sales to Car Buyers, U.S. Department of Justice This implies an even greater demand currently exists for a direct manufacturer sales model. However, state laws in the United States prohibit manufacturers from selling directly, and customers must buy new cars through a dealer. =Discrimination= Studies have found that some auto dealerships charge higher interest rates or otherwise raise their prices to females and ethnic minorities, including Asians, and African Americans. These issues have sometimes resulted in lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, against the dealers on the basis of discrimination based on nationality.

The current, permanent campus came into use in 1971. Herkimer College offers programs leading to associate degrees or certificates in several dozen program areas. The college has partnered with Cazenovia College to offer a bachelor's degrees in \\"Criminal Justice and Homeland Security\\" and Inclusive Early Childhood on the Herkimer campus. The College's Internet Academy offers 20 degrees, three certificates and more than 150 courses, as well as support services, completely online.  On-campus housing  Campus Meadows Campus Meadows is the largest residential quad and offers several different styles of apartments including townhouses (two double bedrooms), one-bedroom flats (one double bedroom), two-bedroom flats (two double bedrooms) and dorm-style flats (one bedroom w/ four students). Each apartment includes a full kitchen, living room and bathroom. Furnished four- person apartments, double occupancy bedrooms College Hill Apartments College Hill offers several styles of apartments including two single bedrooms, two bedrooms shared (one single bedroom and one double bedroom) and one double bedroom. Each apartment includes a full kitchen, living room and bathroom. Reservoir Run The newest of the on-campus housing quads is Reservoir Run, featuring four‚Äìperson suite style apartments. Each apartment includes a living room, full kitchen with microwave, laundry room, four single bedrooms and two bathrooms. This residential community is primarily reserved for second-year students. Furnished four-person apartments, single occupancy bedrooms  Athletics  Herkimer's athletic program began with five sports in 1970, under the direction of Tom LaPuma, and has grown to include 19 varsity offerings. With its growth has come great success with 52 NJCAA National Championships, 100 Region III titles, 142 Mountain Valley Collegiate Conference championships and 29 NJCAA Academic Team of the Year awards. In 2013-14 and 2014‚Äì15, Herkimer ranked first in the nation among two-year non-scholarship athletic programs by winning the National Alliance of Two-Year College Athletic Administrators (NATYCAA) Cup. The award recognizes excellence in two-year colleges, based on athletic success in championship competition.

She read history at St Hilda's College, Oxford. She now lives in Ely, Cambridgeshire, with her husband, the poet Lachlan Mackinnon. Biography Cope was born in Erith in Kent (now in the London Borough of Bexley), where her father Fred Cope was manager of the local department store, Hedley Mitchell. She was educated at West Lodge Preparatory School in Sidcup and Farrington's School, Chislehurst, both in Kent. Following her graduation from St Hilda's College, Oxford Cope spent fifteen years as a primary-school teacher. In 1981, she became Arts and Reviews editor for the Inner London Education Authority magazine, Contact. Five years later she became a freelance writer and was a television critic for The Spectator magazine until 1990. Five collections of her adult poetry have been published, Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis in 1986, Serious Concerns in 1992, If I Don't Know in 2001, Family Values in 2011, and Anecdotal Evidence in 2018. She has also edited several anthologies of comic verse and was a judge of the 2007 Man Booker Prize. In 1998, she was voted the listeners' choice in a BBC Radio 4 poll to succeed Ted Hughes as Poet Laureate. When Andrew Motion's term as Poet Laureate came to an end in 2009, Cope was again widely considered a popular candidate, although she believes the post should be discontinued. Carol Ann Duffy succeeded Motion as Poet Laureate. Cope was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2010 Birthday Honours. In April 2011, the British Library purchased Cope's archive including manuscripts, school reports and 40,000 emails, the largest email archive they have bought to date. The papers also includes 67 poetry notebooks and unpublished poems. Cope commented \\"I wanted to find a good home for my archive. The timing was dictated because we had to move home, so we needed some money to buy a house, and the space. So this was the moment. I asked Andrew Motion what I should do, and he told me someone to approach at the British Library. I wasn't sure they would want it, but they did.\\" When the collection is catalogued and organised, the archive will be available to researchers.The Guardian \\"Wendy Cope's archive sold to British Library\\" 20 April 2011 In 2013, after 19 years of living together, Cope married Lachlan Mackinnon in a register office, although she has stated that she would have preferred a civil partnership. In January 2019 she was the guest on BBC Radio 4's long-running programme Desert Island Discs. Her book choice was The Compleet Molesworth, her luxury item was writing materials and her favourite track was Bach's Concerto for Two Violins and Strings in D minor. Critical reception Despite her slight output, her books have sold well and she has attracted a popular following with her lighthearted, often comical poetry, as well as achieving literary credibility winning two awards and making an award shortlist over a fourteen-year period. She has a keen eye for the everyday, mundane aspects of English life, especially the desires, frustrations, hopes, confusions and emotions in intimate relationships. Dr Rowan Williams is a well known fan of her work, writing that: \\"Wendy Cope is without doubt the wittiest of contemporary English poets, and says a lot of extremely serious things\\".\\"poetryarchive.org\\" A Tour of the Archive with Dr Rowan Williams Three haiku from Making Cocoa for Kingsley Amis, where they are presented as being written by the (fictional) Tulse Hill poet Jason Strugnell, were set by the composer Colin Matthews in 1990 as Strugnell's Haiku.Matthews, Colin (1990). Strugnell's Haiku. London: Faber Music. In 2008 Cope's poem \\"After The Lunch\\" was used as the lyric of the song \\"Waterloo Bridge\\" by jazz composer and musician Jools Holland and singer Louise Marshall. Style Some of her poems are written in the persona of a struggling male poet, Jason Strugnell, a slightly seedy figure from Tulse Hill. She displays her talent for parody with targets ranging from the sonnets of Sir Philip Sidney: > My true love hath my heart and I have hers > We swapped last Tuesday and felt quite elated > But now whenever one of us refers > To 'my heart' things get rather complicated. > to reducing T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land to limericks: > In April one seldom feels cheerful; > Dry stones, sun and dust make me fearful; > Clairvoyants distress me, > Commuters depress me‚Äî > Met Stetson and gave him an earful. > Her style has been compared to that of John Betjeman and Philip Larkin.

It was developed by a team led by food scientist Edwin Traisman (1915‚Äì2007). While many sources give its national debut as 1953, it was advertised by Kraft and retailers in several states in late 1952. Orangish-yellow in color, it usually comes in a glass jar and is used as a topping for various foods, including corn chips, and hot dogs. It is also frequently used as the cheese in a Philadelphia-style cheesesteak. It is marketed in Canada, Mexico, the Philippines, the United States, and Venezuela. Cheez Whiz is one of a number of \\"processed cheese foods\\", a category including some types of individually wrapped cheese slices. These products contain regular cheese that has been reprocessed along with additional ingredients such as emulsifiers and stabilizing agents, such as xanthan gum or carrageenan, and derive their tanginess and flavor from additional ingredients, such as citric acid and flavoring compounds. Annatto is used for coloring.  Ingredients  As of 2016, Kraft describes Cheez Whiz as a \\"cheese dip\\" with the word cheese spelled correctly. According to a Kraft spokesman, the product does include cheese, but the company has chosen to list its parts‚Äîsuch as cheese culture and milk‚Äîinstead of cheese as a component itself.  Sizes  In some markets, the product has been sold in a narrow jar that tapered narrower towards the base, and sold as a spread. When Cheez Whiz is advertised as a dip or a sauce, the jars are larger and more of a squat cylindrical shape.  Varieties  Varieties include: * Cheez Whiz * Cheez Whiz Light * Cheez Whiz Tex Mex * Salsa Con Queso * Cheez Whiz Italia * Cheez Whiz Bacon * Cheez Whiz Pimento Cheez Whiz can also be found in \\"Handi Snacks\\" products such as Ritz Cheez Whiz 'n' Crackers in Canada. Cheez Whiz was reformulated in the early 21st century. The new formula is used for Cheez Whiz Light (15.5 oz) as well as the Original Big Cheese (15 oz). The products' jars were also widened to allow dipping.  Formula change  Over the years since its creation, Kraft had altered its recipe due to changes in dairy sourcing and the regulatory environment, resulting in a reduction of cheese content. Kraft also made a change in the way that it lists its ingredients; away from listing components (like cheese) to listing its parts (such as milk and cheese culture). Such changes are common throughout the food industry, and are often done without announcement.

They are found in places that are permanently cold, such as the polar regions and the deep sea. They can be contrasted with thermophiles, which are organisms that thrive at unusually high temperatures. Psychrophile is Greek for 'cold-loving'. Many such organisms are bacteria or archaea, but some eukaryotes such as lichens, snow algae, fungi, and wingless midges, are also classified as psychrophiles. Biology The lichen Xanthoria elegans can continue to photosynthesize at ‚àí24 ¬∞C. =Habitat= The cold environments that psychrophiles inhabit are ubiquitous on Earth, as a large fraction of our planetary surface experiences temperatures lower than 15 ¬∞C. They are present in permafrost, polar ice, glaciers, snowfields and deep ocean waters. These organisms can also be found in pockets of sea ice with high salinity content. Microbial activity has been measured in soils frozen below ‚àí39 ¬∞C. In addition to their temperature limit, psychrophiles must also adapt to other extreme environmental constraints that may arise as a result of their habitat. These constraints include high pressure in the deep sea, and high salt concentration on some sea ice. =Adaptations= Psychrophiles are protected from freezing and the expansion of ice by ice-induced desiccation and vitrification (glass transition), as long as they cool slowly. Free living cells desiccate and vitrify between ‚àí10 ¬∞C and ‚àí26 ¬∞C. Cells of multicellular organisms may vitrify at temperatures below ‚àí50 ¬∞C. The cells may continue to have some metabolic activity in the extracellular fluid down to these temperatures, and they remain viable once restored to normal temperatures. They must also overcome the stiffening of their lipid cell membrane, as this is important for the survival and functionality of these organisms. To accomplish this, psychrophiles adapt lipid membrane structures that have a high content of short, unsaturated fatty acids. Compared to longer saturated fatty acids, incorporating this type of fatty acid allows for the lipid cell membrane to have a lower melting point, which increases the fluidity of the membranes. In addition, carotenoids are present in the membrane, which help modulate the fluidity of it. Antifreeze proteins are also synthesized to keep psychrophiles' internal space liquid, and to protect their DNA when temperatures drop below water's freezing point. By doing so, the protein prevents any ice formation or recrystallization process from occurring. The enzymes of these organisms have been hypothesized to engage in an activity-stability-flexibility relationship as a method for adapting to the cold; the flexibility of their enzyme structure will increase as a way to compensate for the freezing effect of their environment. Certain cryophiles, such as Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio and Aeromonas spp., can transition into a viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. During VBNC, a micro- organism can respirate and use substrates for metabolism ‚Äì however, it cannot replicate. An advantage of this state is that it is highly reversible. It has been debated whether VBNC is an active survival strategy or if eventually the organism's cells will no longer be able to be revived. There is proof however it may be very effective ‚Äì Gram positive bacteria Actinobacteria have been shown to have lived about 500,000 years in the permafrost conditions of Antarctica, Canada, and Siberia. =Taxonomic range= The wingless midge (Chironomidae) Belgica antarctica. Psychrophiles include bacteria, lichens, fungi, and insects. Among the bacteria that can tolerate extreme cold are Arthrobacter sp., Psychrobacter sp. and members of the genera Halomonas, Pseudomonas, Hyphomonas, and Sphingomonas. Another example is Chryseobacterium greenlandensis, a psychrophile that was found in 120,000-year-old ice. Umbilicaria antarctica and Xanthoria elegans are lichens that have been recorded photosynthesizing at temperatures ranging down to ‚àí24 ¬∞C, and they can grow down to around ‚àí10 ¬∞C. Some multicellular eukaryotes can also be metabolically active at sub-zero temperatures, such as some conifers; those in the Chironomidae family are still active at ‚àí16 ¬∞C. Penicillium is a genus of fungi found in a wide range of environments including extreme cold. Among the psychrophile insects, the Grylloblattidae or ice crawlers, found on mountaintops, have optimal temperatures between 1-4 ¬∞C. The wingless midge (Chironomidae) Belgica antarctica can tolerate salt, being frozen and strong ultraviolet, and has the smallest known genome of any insect. The small genome, of 99 million base pairs, is thought to be adaptive to extreme environments.  Psychrotrophic Insects  Insects that are psychrotrophic can survive cold temperatures through several general mechanisms (unlike opportunistic and chill susceptible insects): (1) chill tolerance, (2) freeze avoidance, and (3) freeze tolerance. Chill tolerant insects succumb to freezing temperatures after prolonged exposure to mild or moderate freezing temperatures. Freeze avoiding insects can survive extended periods of time at sub-freezing temperatures in a supercooled state, but die at their supercooling point. Freeze tolerant insects can survive ice crystal formation within their body at sub-freezing temperatures. Freeze tolerance within insects is argued to be on a continuum, with some insect species exhibiting partial (e.g., Tipula paludosa, Hemideina thoracica ), moderate (e.g., Cryptocercus punctulatus), and strong freezing tolerance (e.g., Eurosta solidaginis and Syrphus ribesii), and other insect species exhibiting freezing tolerance with low supercooling point (e.g., Pytho deplanatus). Psychrotrophic Bacteria Psychrotrophic microbes are able to grow at temperatures below , but have better growth rates at higher temperatures. Psychrotrophic bacteria and fungi are able to grow at refrigeration temperatures, and can be responsible for food spoilage. They provide an estimation of the product's shelf life, but also they can be found in soils, in surface and deep sea waters, in Antarctic ecosystems, and in foods. Psychrotrophic bacteria are of particular concern to the dairy industry. Most are killed by pasteurization; however, they can be present in milk as post- pasteurization contaminants due to less than adequate sanitation practices. According to the Food Science Department at Cornell University, psychrotrophs are bacteria capable of growth at temperatures at or less than . At freezing temperatures, growth of psychrotrophic bacteria becomes negligible or virtually stops.Steven C. Murphy, \\"Shelf LIfe of Fluid Milk Products -- Microbial Spoilage\\", Food Science Department, Cornell University.. Retrieved 22 November 2009. All three subunits of the RecBCD enzyme are essential for physiological activities of the enzyme in the Antarctic Pseudomonas syringae, namely, repairing of DNA damage and supporting the growth at low temperature. The RecBCD enzymes are exchangeable between the psychrophilic P. syringae and the mesophilic E. coli when provided with the entire protein complex from same species. However, the RecBC proteins (RecBCPs and RecBCEc) of the two bacteria are not equivalent; the RecBCEc is proficient in DNA recombination and repair, and supports the growth of P. syringae at low temperature, while RecBCPs is insufficient for these functions. Finally, both helicase and nuclease activity of the RecBCDPs are although important for DNA repair and growth of P. syringae at low temperature, the RecB-nuclease activity is not essential in vivo. Psychrophile Versus psychrotroph In 1940, ZoBell and Conn stated that they had never encountered \\"true psychrophiles\\" or organisms that grow best at relatively low temperatures. In 1958, J. L. Ingraham supported this by concluding that there are very few or possibly no bacteria that fit the textbook definitions of psychrophiles. Richard Y. Morita emphasizes this by using the term psychrotroph to describe organisms that do not meet the definition of psychrophiles. The confusion between the terms psychrotrophs and psychrophiles was started because investigators were unaware of the thermolability of psychrophilic organisms at the laboratory temperatures. Due to this, early investigators did not determine the cardinal temperatures for their isolates. The similarity between these two is that they are both capable of growing at zero, but optimum and upper temperature limits for the growth are lower for psychrophiles compared to psychrotrophs. Psychrophiles are also more often isolated from permanently cold habitats compared to psychrotrophs. Although psychrophilic enzymes remain under-used because the cost of production and processing at low temperatures is higher than for the commercial enzymes that are presently in use, the attention and resurgence of research interest in psychrophiles and psychrotrophs will be a contributor to the betterment of the environment and the desire to conserve energy.

In a career which lasted from 1930 until 1935, he ran fifty-one times and won twenty-nine races. A leading two-year-old in 1930, he missed most of the next season, including two of the three American Triple Crown races through injury and illness. \\"Ekky\\" returned to the track in 1934 and proved to be a dominant champion, winning numerous important stakes races in the next three years. Equipoise died in 1938 after a short but promising stud career. Background Equipoise was a chestnut bred in the United States by Harry Payne Whitney and owned by his son, Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. He was called the \\"Chocolate Soldier\\" by his fans, due to his elegance and symmetry. His sire, Pennant, won the Belmont Futurity Stakes for Harry Payne Whitney in 1913. Equipoise's dam, Swinging, was a descendant of The Oaks winner Miami, placing him in the same Thoroughbred family as the 1897 English Triple Crown winner Galtee More and the 1902 Epsom Derby winner Ard Patrick as well as some well-known American runners, such as Intentionally and Seabiscuit. As a yearling, Equipoise was an unimpressive individual. C. V. Whitney thought so little of the ugly duckling that he sent him to his second-string trainer, Fred Hopkins. Racing career =1930-1931: early career= As a two-year-old, Equipoise ran sixteen times, claiming his first stakes victory when he won the Keene Memorial Stakes at Belmont Park. In September, he ran in the Belmont Futurity the most valuable two-year-old race of the season in which he was beaten a nose by Jamestown. Although Jamestown's victory was regarded by some as having decided the identity of the best two-year-old, he did not race again in 1930, while Equipoise went on to further success. On November 5, he beat Twenty Grand by half a length with Mate a neck away in third in the Pimlico Futurity. After starting slowly, he settled the race in the straight with what the New York Times described as \\"a brilliant burst of speed\\" to reverse two earlier defeats by Twenty Grand. When his jockey, Sonny Workman, was asked if this was his greatest race, Workman replied: \\"My greatest race? Hell, it may have been the greatest race anybody ever saw.\\" Although there were no formal awards for Thoroughbred racing in 1930, press opinion was that Equipoise's win at Pimlico entitled him to \\"a share of the 2 year old championship honors\\" Equipoise started 1931 as the favorite for the Kentucky Derby and won on his reappearance at Havre de Grace, Maryland. At the same track on April 26, he finished last of the six runners in the Chesapeake Stakes, after which he was reported to be suffering from a kidney ailment described as \\"azoturia\\" or \\"blackwater\\". Later reports ascribed his defeat to problems with his \\"shelly\\" feet. In the Preakness Stakes, which was the first of the Triple Crown races in 1931, he finished fourth behind Mate. A week later, he was withdrawn from the Derby on the day of the race and did not race again that year. =1932-1935: later career= As a four-year-old in 1932, Equipoise won ten of his fourteen starts. On May 21, he won the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont Park from Sun Meadow, with Mate third. Equipoise, who started 3/5 favorite, won by two and a half lengths despite being eased down by Workman near the finish and was received with \\"thunderous applause\\". On May 31 at Arlington Park, Chicago, Equipoise set a world record of 1:34.4 for a mile when winning the Delavan Purse. In the Stars and Stripes Handicap at the same course four days later, he \\"outclassed\\" his opponents. On August 13, Equipoise led all the way to win the Whitney Stakes by three lengths from the three-year-old Gusto. According to the New York Times report, the win confirmed his status as the best horse in the handicap division. At five, Equipoise won seven more races. On June 3, he gave 26 pounds to the runner-up, Okapi, in again winning the Metropolitan, living up to his reputation as the \\"king of the handicap horses\\". Four days later, he ran in the Suburban Handicap carrying 132 pounds over a mile and a quarter. He won by two lengths from Osculator, with Apprentice five lengths back in third. In August, he faced the highly regarded Gallant Sir in the Hawthorne Gold Cup and won a \\"thrilling\\" race by two lengths to record his sixth successive win. His other wins included April's Philadelphia Handicap at Havre de Grace Racetrack which he won again in 1934. In September he won the Saratoga Cup in which he raced beyond a mile and a quarter for the first time and won from Gusto and Keep Out. As a six-year-old, Equipoise was kept in training with the aim of beating Sun Beau's earnings record. In the spring, he won the Philadelphia Handicap at Havre de Grace and the Dixie Handicap at Pimlico before being rested till autumn. On November 6, he overcame a wet and muddy Belmont track (described as a \\"sea of slop\\") to beat Faireno in the Whitney Gold Trophy. At the start of 1935, the seven-year- old Equipoise was sent to California for the inaugural running of the world's richest race, the Santa Anita Handicap, which was to be his final race. He showed some promise in defeat in two prep races and started favorite despite top weight of 130 pounds against what was described as \\"the greatest field of horses ever assembled\\". Equipoise's challenge ended in disappointment: according to Sonny Workman, he \\"simply wouldn't run\\" as he finished seventh to the Irish-bred Steeplechase specialist Azucar. Whitney later revealed that Equipoise had suffered a recurrence of the tendon injury which had kept him off the track in the previous summer. He was retired to stud with earnings of $338,610, the second highest in racing history up to that time. Assessment His career was greatly restricted by hoof problems, but he was still regarded by contemporary observers as the outstanding American horse of his era. Although there were no formal awards at this time, he was regarded as United States Horse of the Year in both 1932 and 1933 and as the best older horse in 1932, 1933, and 1934. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, which ranked only horses that ran in North America, Equipoise was ranked #21. In their book A Century of Champions, the British writers Tony Morris and John Randall placed Equipoise at #163 in their global ranking of 20th Century Thoroughbreds. Equipoise was also inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York, in 1957. Stud record Equipoise stood as a stallion for only four seasons before his death on August 4, 1938, at the age of ten. Four years later, the success of his progeny, notably the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes winner Shut Out, saw him become America's Champion sire. References in popular culture In \\"Fugue for Tinhorns,\\" the opening number of the musical Guys and Dolls, Equipoise is referred to as the great- grandfather of one of the song's fictional racehorses. Equipoise is also one of the racing mice in the movie Stalag 17.

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Representative (1937-1944) and a U.S. Senator (1944-1981) from Washington. He served over 36 years in the Senate, and was the most senior member of the body during his final two years in office. Early life and education Warren Magnuson was born in Moorhead, Minnesota. His birth date is given as April 12, 1905, but the actual records of his birth are sealed. He apparently never knew his birth parents; according to various sources, his parents either died within a month of his birth, or his unmarried mother put him up for adoption. He was adopted by William Grant and Emma (n√©e Anderson) Magnuson, who gave him their name. The Magnusons were second-generation Scandinavian immigrants who operated a bar in Moorhead, and who adopted a daughter named Clara a year after adopting Warren. His adoptive father left the family in 1921. Magnuson attended Moorhead High School, where he played quarterback on the football team and was captain of the baseball team. While attending high school, he ran a YMCA camp, worked in the wheat farms, and delivered newspapers and telegrams in Moorhead and in nearby Fargo, North Dakota. He graduated in 1923, and then enrolled at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. In 1924, he transferred to the North Dakota Agricultural College in Fargo, which he attended for a year. He then traveled through Canada for a period of time, riding freight trains and working with threshing crews. Magnuson followed a high school girlfriend to Seattle, Washington, where he entered the University of Washington in 1925. He was a member of the Theta Chi fraternity, and worked delivering ice as a member of the Teamsters under Dave Beck. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1926, and earned a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Washington School of Law in 1929. A Democrat, he first became active in politics in 1928, volunteering for A. Scott Bullitt for governor and Al Smith for president. Early career In 1929, Magnuson was admitted to the bar and joined the law office of Judge Samuel Stern in Seattle. He served as secretary of the Seattle Municipal League from 1930 to 1931. He served as special prosecutor for King County in 1932, investigating official misconduct. He also founded the state chapter of the Young Democrats of America that same year. He was a leading supporter of repealing state Prohibition laws and establishing the state Liquor Control Board. From 1933 to 1934, Magnuson served as a member of the Washington House of Representatives from the Seattle-based 37th Legislative District. As a state legislator, he sponsored the first unemployment compensation bill in the nation. He was a delegate to the state constitutional convention in 1933. He briefly served as Assistant United States District Attorney before being elected prosecuting attorney of King County, serving from 1934 to 1936. Congressional career Magnuson was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1936, filling a vacancy caused by the sudden death of fellow Democrat Marion Zioncheck on August 7, 1936. In 1937, along with senators Homer Bone and Matthew Neely, Magnuson introduced the National Cancer Institute Act, which was signed into law by Franklin Roosevelt on August 5 of that year. He won re-election in 1938, 1940, and 1942. After the Attack on Pearl Harbor Magnuson was a staunch supporter of the U.S. war effort.Magnuson was instrumental in securing a commission in the U.S. Army for Bob Struble in 1942. Magnuson served in the United States Navy during World War II. He was aboard the aircraft carrier for several months, seeing heavy combat in the Pacific Theatre until President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered all congressmen on active duty to return home in 1942. In 1944, Magnuson successfully ran for the U.S. Senate. He was appointed on December 14, 1944 to fill the vacancy created by Homer Bone's appointment to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, thus resigning from the House and starting his service in the Senate a month early. He was re-elected in 1950, 1956, 1962, 1968, and 1974. He served on the Senate Commerce Committee throughout his tenure in the Senate, and the Senate Appropriations Committee during his final term. Magnuson served most of his tenure in the Senate alongside his friend and Democratic colleague from Washington State, Henry M. \\"Scoop\\" Jackson. Magnuson was defeated in a bid for re-election by state attorney general Slade Gorton in 1980. In August 1950, Magnuson proposed voluntary enlistment for the Japanese in the American armed forces and sent a cable request to General Douglas MacArthur on the practicality of the proposal.Arming of Germans, Japanese Proposed to Meet Red Threat (August 5, 1950) In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy visited Seattle and was an honored guest at a celebration honoring Magnuson's first 25 years in Congress. Nearly 3,000 people paid $100 each to attend the dinner. At the end of August 1966, after President Johnson announced the nominations of Charles F. Luce for Undersecretary of the Interior, John A. Carver for Federal Power Commission membership, and David S. Black for BPA administrator, Magnuson announced the Senate Commerce committee would hold hearings into the Carver nomination on September 1 and described Luce as \\"one of the most able, dedicated, productive public servants I know\\". On November 7, 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967, noting Magnuson as one of the members of Congress to \\"have been part of the team that has brought this measure to the White House to make it the law of our land.\\" At least three important pieces of legislation bear his name: the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Chinese Exclusion Repeal Act of 1943 (commonly referred to as the Magnuson Act), and the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act. He was also instrumental in keeping supertankers out of Puget Sound, by slipping an amendment to a routine funding reauthorization bill through on the Senate and House consent calendars.HistoryLink.org, the online encyclopedia of Washington State history. Accessed July 19, 2006 The bill that became the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was referred to the Committee on Commerce. Magnuson played a key role in getting that bill to the floor and enacted into law despite vigorous opposition by Senator William Fulbright and other staunch segregationists. Magnuson was responsible for special legislation that allowed Poon Lim, a Chinese sailor who in 1942 survived 133 days alone at sea as a castaway, to immigrate to the U.S. Magnuson attended the May 5, 1978 dedication ceremony for Riverfront Park in Spokane. Shortly thereafter, during a town hall meeting, President Jimmy Carter said, \\"No one could be in a better political position than to be preceded and introduced by men like Tom Foley and Senator Warren Magnuson. I know of no one in the Congress than these two men who are more respected, more dedicated to serving their own people well, but who have also reached, because of their experience and knowledge, sound judgment and commitment, a position of national and even international renown and leadership.\\" Personal life In 1928, Magnuson married Eleanor Peggy \\"Peggins\\" Maddieux, who had been crowned Miss Seattle the previous year. They remained together until their divorce in 1935. Magnuson dated a number of glamorous women, including heiress and cover girl June Millarde and actress Carole Parker. In 1964, he married Jermaine Elliott Peralta (1923-2011), widowed as a teenager, in a ceremony conducted by Rev. Frederick Brown Harris at the Omni Shoreham Hotel. The couple remained together until his death, and he helped raise Peralta's daughter from her previous marriage, Juanita. Magnuson and his wife are interred in Acacia Memorial Park in Lake Forest Park, north of Seattle. Namesakes *Warren G.

In the battle, an Athenian fleet commanded by eight strategoi defeated a Spartan fleet under Callicratidas. The battle was precipitated by a Spartan victory which led to the Athenian fleet under Conon being blockaded at Mytilene; to relieve Conon, the Athenians assembled a scratch force composed largely of newly constructed ships manned by inexperienced crews. This inexperienced fleet was thus tactically inferior to the Spartans, but its commanders were able to circumvent this problem by employing new and unorthodox tactics, which allowed the Athenians to secure a dramatic and unexpected victory. Slaves and metics who participated in the battle were granted Athenian citizenship. The news of the victory itself was met with jubilation at Athens. Their joy was tempered, however, by the aftermath of the battle, in which a storm prevented the ships assigned to rescue the survivors of the 25 disabled or sunken Athenian triremes from performing their duties, and a great number of sailors drowned. A fury erupted at Athens when the public learned of this, and after a bitter struggle in the assembly six of the eight generals who had commanded the fleet were tried as a group and executed. At Sparta, meanwhile, traditionalists who had supported Callicratidas pressed for peace with Athens, knowing that a continuation of the war would lead to the re-ascendence of their opponent Lysander. This party initially prevailed, and a delegation was dispatched to Athens to make an offer of peace; the Athenians, however, rejected this offer, and Lysander departed to the Aegean to take command of the fleet for the remainder of the war, which would be decided less than a year later by his total victory at Aegospotami.  Prelude  = Callicratidas and Conon = In 406 BC, Callicratidas was appointed as the navarch of the Spartan fleet, replacing Lysander.Unless noted otherwise, all details of the prelude to the battle and the battle are drawn from Xenophon, Hellenica 1.6.1-34. Callicratidas was a traditionalist Spartan, distrustful of Persian influence and reluctant to ask for support from the Persian prince Cyrus, who had been a strong supporter of Lysander. Thus, Callicratidas was forced to assemble his fleet and funding by seeking contributions from Sparta's allies among the Greek cities of the region. In this fashion, he assembled a fleet of some 140 triremes. Conon, meanwhile, in command of the Athenian fleet at Samos, was compelled by problems with the morale of his sailors to man only 70 of the more than 100 triremes he had in his possession.Xenophon, Hellenica 1.5.20 Callicratidas, once he had assembled his fleet, sailed against Methymna, on Lesbos, which he laid siege to and stormed. From Methymna, Callicratidas could potentially move to capture the rest of Lesbos, which would clear the way for him to move his fleet to the Hellespont, where he would be athwart the all-important Athenian grain supply line. To defend Lesbos, Conon was forced to move his numerically inferior fleet from Samos to the Hekatonnesi islands near Methymna.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 451 When Callicratidas attacked him, however, with a fleet that had swollen to a size of 170 ships, Conon was forced to flee to Mytilene, where, in the Battle of Mytilene, he was blockaded with his fleet after losing 30 ships in a clash at the mouth of the harbor. Besieged by land and sea, Conon was powerless to act against the vastly superior forces that surrounded him, and was only barely able to slip a messenger ship out to Athens to carry the news of his plight. = The relief force = When the messenger ship reached Athens with news of Conon's situation, the assembly wasted no time in approving extreme measures to build and man a relief force. The golden statues of Nike were melted down to fund the construction of the ships,Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 452 and slaves and metics were enlisted to crew the fleet. To ensure a sufficiently large and loyal group of crewmen, the Athenians even took the radical step of extending citizenship to thousands of slaves who rowed with the fleet.Hunt, The Slaves and Generals of Arginusae, 359-64 Over a hundred ships were prepared and manned through these measures, and contributions from allied ships raised the fleet's size to 150 triremes after it reached Samos. In a highly unorthodox arrangement, the fleet was commanded collaboratively by eight generals; these were Aristocrates, Aristogenes, Diomedon, Erasinides, Lysias, Pericles, Protomachus, and Thrasyllus. After leaving Samos, the Athenian fleet sailed to the Arginusae islands, opposite Cape Malea on Lesbos, where they camped for an evening. Callicratidas, who had sailed south to Malea with most of his fleet upon learning of the Athenians' movements, spotted their signal fires and planned to attack them by night, but was prevented from doing so by a thunderstorm, and so was forced to delay his attack until morning.  The battle  At dawn the next day, Callicratidas led his fleet out to meet the Athenians. He had 140 ships to match the Athenians' 150, having left 50 to watch Conon at Mytilene. For the first time in the war, the Spartan crews and commanders were more experienced than their Athenian opposites, as the Athenians' best crews had been at sea with Conon.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 454 To counter the Spartans' superior skill and maneuverability, the Athenian commanders implemented several new and innovative tactics. First, the Athenian fleet was divided into eight autonomous divisions, each commanded by one of the generals; second, they arranged their fleet in a double line instead of the traditional single line in order to prevent the Spartans from using the maneuver known as the diekplous, in which a trireme raced into a gap between two enemy ships and then wheeled to strike one of them in the side; if the Spartans attempted this against a double line, a ship from the second line could move up to attack the Spartan ship.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 454-56 The Athenians (yellow) used an unusual tactic with which they prevented a diekplous As the Athenians advanced, they extended their left flank out to sea, outflanking the Spartans. The superior Athenian numbers, combined with the tactics they had implemented, created a dangerous situation for the Spartans, and Callicratidas' helmsman advised him to retire without a fight, but the navarch insisted on pushing on. Dividing his force in two to meet the threat of encirclement,Diodorus Siculus, Library 13.98.4 Callicratidas led his fleet into battle. Heated fighting ensued for some time, but eventually Callicratidas, leading the Spartan right, was killed when his ship rammed an opposing ship, and resistance on the right collapsed. The left continued to resist for longer, but was unable to stand up to the entire Athenian fleet and soon joined the right wing in flight. All told, the Spartans lost some 70 ships, and the Athenians 25.Diodorus Siculus, Library 13.99.6  Aftermath  In the immediate aftermath of the battle, the Athenian commanders had to decide which of several pressing tasks to focus their attention on. Conon was still blockaded at Mytilene by 50 Spartan ships, and decisive action against those ships could lead to their destruction before they had a chance to join the remainder of Callicratidas' fleet. At the same time, however, the survivors from the 25 Athenian ships sunk or disabled in the battle remained afloat off the Arginusae islands.For the dilemma of the generals, see Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 459-60. To address both of these concerns, the generals decided that all eight of them would sail with the majority of the fleet to Mytilene, where they would attempt to relieve Conon, while the trierarchs Thrasybulus and Theramenes would remain behind with a smaller detachment to rescue the survivors; both of these missions, however, were thwarted by the sudden arrival of a storm which drove the ships back into port. The Spartan fleet at Mytilene escaped, and rescuing the drowning sailors proved impossible.Xenophon, Hellenica 1.6.35-36 = Trial of the generals = At Athens, the public relief at this unexpected victory was quickly subsumed in a bitter rhetorical battle over who was responsible for the failure to rescue the sailors. When the generals learned that the public was angry over the failed rescue, they assumed that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to the city, were responsible, and accordingly wrote letters to the assembly denouncing the two trierarchs and blaming them for the disaster.The broad account followed here and in the following paragraph is that of Diodorus, 13.101. Xenophon, at 1.7, gives a different account which places much more of the blame for the trial and execution on Theramenes' shoulders. Modern scholars (see Fine The Ancient Greeks, 514-15, Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 461-66, and Hornblower, The Greek World, 151) have generally preferred Diodorus' account at certain key points. Xenophon, however, offers more specific detail of many events, and unless otherwise noted, details given here are from his account, at Hellenica, 1.7.1-35. The trierarchs responded successfully to the allegations brought against them, and public anger now turned against the generals instead.Diodorus Siculus, Library 13.101.4 The eight generals were deposed from their office and ordered to return to Athens to stand trial; two of them, Aristogenes and Protomachus, fled, but the other six returned. Upon their return, they were imprisoned, and one of them, Erasinides, was brought to trial and convicted of several charges involving misconduct in office; this trial may represent an attempt by the generals' enemies to test the wind, since Erasinides, who had proposed abandoning the survivors altogether during the deliberations after the battle, may have been the easiest target among the six.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 462 The question of how the generals should be tried for their failure to rescue the survivors was then brought before the assembly. On the first day of debate, the generals were able to win the sympathy of the crowd by placing the blame for the tragedy entirely on the storm that had thwarted the rescue attempts. Unfortunately for them, however, this first day of debate was followed by the festival of the Apaturia, at which families met together; in this context, the absence of those drowned at Arginusae was painfully evident, and when the assembly next met the initiative passed to those who wished to treat the generals harshly. A politician named Callixeinus proposed that, without further debate, the assembly should vote on the guilt or innocence of the generals. Euryptolemus, a cousin of Alcibiades, and several others opposed the motion on the grounds that it was unconstitutional, but they withdrew their opposition after another politician moved that the same penalty applied to the generals be applied to them. With the opposition from the floor now silenced, the generals' accusers sought to bring their motion to a vote. The presiding officers of the assembly were the prytaneis, randomly selected councilmen from whichever tribe was assigned to oversee the assembly in a given month; at each meeting of the assembly, one of the prytaneis was appointed epistates, or president of the assembly.Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 465 By chance, the philosopher Socrates, holding public office for the only time in his life, was epistates on the day that the generals were tried. Declaring that he would \\"do nothing that was contrary to the law\\",Xenophon, Hellenica 1.7.15 Socrates refused to put the measure to a vote. Emboldened, Euryptolemus rose again to speak, and persuaded the assembly to pass a motion ordering that the generals be tried separately. Parliamentary maneuvering, however, undid this victory, and in the end the original motion was carried; a vote was taken, and all six generals were found guilty and executed, including Pericles the Younger. The Athenians soon came to regret their decision in the case of the generals, and charges were brought against the principal instigators of the executions. These men escaped before they could be brought to trial, but Callixeinus did return to Athens several years later; despised by his fellow citizens, he died of starvation.Xenophon, Hellenica 1.7.35 = Peace offer = At Sparta, the defeat at Arginusae added to a long list of setbacks since the war in the Aegean had begun in 412 BC. The fleet, now stationed at Chios, was in poor condition, Spartans at home were discouraged, and supporters of Callicratidas were displeased by the notion that his rival Lysander would rise to power again if the war were to continue (Sparta's allies in the Aegean were demanding his return).Kagan, The Peloponnesian War, 467-68 With all these concerns in mind, the Spartan government dispatched an embassy to Athens, offering to surrender the Spartan fort at Decelea in return for peace on the basis of the status quo in the Aegean.Aristotle, Constitution of the Athenians, 34 This proposal, however, was rejected by the Athenian assembly at the urging of Cleophon. The war continued, but Athens' decision was to prove costly less than a year later when Lysander, in command of the Spartan fleet once more, decisively defeated the Athenian fleet at Aegospotami; within two years of the dramatic Athenian victory at Arginusae, the city surrendered and its walls were torn down.

The game progresses by counting up from 1 to 21, with the player who calls \\"21\\" suffering a drinking penalty before the next round starts. The loser may add one new rule to the game, and starts the new round. Rules Players are arranged in a circle, facing inwards. The game begins with one player calling the direction of play by saying, \\"I propose a game of XXXX! To my left...\\" or \\"To my right...\\" followed by a sequential series of numbers beginning with one. Variations exist for the proposal of the game depending on personal rules; this is due to some variants calling for any person who says the number \\"21\\" to drink. For example: * \\"I propose a game of 21!\\" * \\"I propose a game of 20...22!\\" * \\"I propose a game of twenty plus one!\\" * \\"I propose a game of the unspeakable number!\\" As the game progresses, each player in turn must recite one to four numbers, counting in sequence from where the previous player left off: * Saying one number (e.g. \\"one\\") passes the game to the next player in the circle in the initial direction. * Saying two numbers (e.g. \\"one, two\\") passes to the next player, but reverses direction. * Saying three numbers (e.g. \\"one, two, three\\") passes in the initial direction, but skips a player. * Saying four numbers (e.g. \\"one, two, three, four\\") reverses direction and skips a player. If a player makes a mistake, then they suffer a small to moderate drinking penalty (e.g. 2 fingers of drink) and then restart the game from 1. Mistakes include: * Hesitating to continue the game. * Calling the wrong number. * Calling a number out of turn. * Breaching any original or instated rule. Assuming there are no mistakes, the game will continue in sequence up to 21. The player who calls 21 suffers a heavy drinking penalty (e.g. finishing their drink), creates a new rule, then restarts the game from 1. Additional rules Variations on the standard rules include: * Prohibiting three players calling single numbers in a row. * \\"Doubling a double\\" - prohibits saying two numbers after two numbers. * \\"Tripling a triple\\" - prohibits either saying three numbers after three numbers, or after 2 sets of three numbers. * \\"Reversing into a hole\\" - prohibits saying two numbers after three numbers. * Prohibiting calling out a series of numbers that sum to 21 (e.g. \\"6, 7, 8\\" or \\"10, 11\\") Examples of new rules that could be instated by a player forced to call 21: * Swapping two numbers around (e.g. 3 and 13 are switched) * Replacing a number with a humorous phrase (e.g. replacing 5 with \\"skin\\" - causing the sequence 1, 2, 3, \\"foreskin\\") * Instating an underlying set of rules (e.g. left hand drinking) * Thumb master - the last player to place their thumb on the table following the thumb master must drink. * Head master - as with thumb master, but replacing the thumb with the head * Pose master - the last player to strike a pose following the pose master must drink. It is also commonplace to declare (either at the start of the game or as an additional rule) that the game be played according to the so-called \\"International Drinking Rules\\". These are a body of generally accepted but not entirely uniform rules that players understand to apply to all drinking activity and include rules for example, that drinkers must keep their little finger up whilst drinking, only drink with their left hand and, in some circles, that using the word 'drink' be prohibited and replaced with words such as 'consume' or 'imbibe'. Example The events of the example game. Andy, Bill, Cath, Dan, Ed and Fran are sitting with Andy at 12 o'clock, and the other players arranged clockwise in alphabetical order: # Andy: I propose a game of 21!

She is penalised 2 fingers of drink. # Cath drinks # Cath: I propose a game of 21! To my right: 1. {‚Üí Bill} # Bill: 2. {‚Üí Andy} The game ultimately finishes when all the numbers have been replaced, by rule changes instigated by the person who drinks on 21. Variations * Using Roman numerals. Replacing the Roman numerals with other humorous or explicit phrases can make the game more interesting (e.g. replace I with \\"No\\", V with \\"Daddy\\" and X with \\"Don't touch me!\\") * Using the binary number system. * Replacing numbers with themed sets of phrases.

In the field of molecular biology, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are a group of nuclear receptor proteins that function as transcription factors regulating the expression of genes. PPARs play essential roles in the regulation of cellular differentiation, development, and metabolism (carbohydrate, lipid, protein), and tumorigenesis of higher organisms.  Nomenclature and tissue distribution  Three types of PPARs have been identified: alpha, gamma, and delta (beta): * Œ± (alpha) - expressed in liver, kidney, heart, muscle, adipose tissue, and others * Œ≤/Œ¥ (beta/delta) - expressed in many tissues but markedly in brain, adipose tissue, and skin * Œ≥ (gamma) - although transcribed by the same gene, this PPAR through alternative splicing is expressed in three forms: ** Œ≥1 - expressed in virtually all tissues, including heart, muscle, colon, kidney, pancreas, and spleen ** Œ≥2 - expressed mainly in adipose tissue (30 amino acids longer than Œ≥1) ** Œ≥3 - expressed in macrophages, large intestine, white adipose tissue. = History = PPARs were originally identified in Xenopus frogs as receptors that induce the proliferation of peroxisomes in cells. The first PPAR (PPARŒ±) was discovered during the search of a molecular target for a group of agents then referred to as peroxisome proliferators, as they increased peroxisomal numbers in rodent liver tissue, apart from improving insulin sensitivity. These agents, pharmacologically related to the fibrates were discovered in the early 1980s. When it turned out that PPARs played a much more versatile role in biology, the agents were in turn termed PPAR ligands. The best-known PPAR ligands are the thiazolidinediones; see below for more details. After PPARŒ¥ (delta) was identified in humans in 1992, it turned out to be closely related to the PPARŒ≤ (beta) previously described during the same year in other animals (Xenopus). The name PPARŒ¥ is generally used in the US, whereas the use of the PPARŒ≤ denomination has remained in Europe where this receptor was initially discovered in Xenopus.  Physiological function  All PPARs heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and bind to specific regions on the DNA of target genes. These DNA sequences are termed PPREs (peroxisome proliferator hormone response elements). The DNA consensus sequence is AGGTCANAGGTCA, with N being any nucleotide. In general, this sequence occurs in the promoter region of a gene, and, when the PPAR binds its ligand, transcription of target genes is increased or decreased, depending on the gene. The RXR also forms a heterodimer with a number of other receptors (e.g., vitamin D and thyroid hormone). The function of PPARs is modified by the precise shape of their ligand-binding domain (see below) induced by ligand binding and by a number of coactivator and corepressor proteins, the presence of which can stimulate or inhibit receptor function, respectively. Endogenous ligands for the PPARs include free fatty acids, eicosanoids and Vitamin B3. PPARŒ≥ is activated by PGJ2 (a prostaglandin) and certain members of the 5-HETE family of arachidonic acid metabolites including 5-oxo-15(S)-HETE and 5-oxo- ETE.Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1736:228-236, 2005 In contrast, PPARŒ± is activated by leukotriene B4. Certain members of the 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid family of arachidonic acid metabolites, including 15(S)-HETE, 15(R)-HETE, and 15-HpETE activate to varying degrees PPAR alpha, beta/delta, and gamma.Mol. Pharmacol. 77-171-184, 2010 PPARŒ≥ activation by agonist RS5444 may inhibit anaplastic thyroid cancer growth. SeeCurr. Mol. Med. 7:532-540, 2007 for a review and critique of the roles of PPAR gamma in cancer.  Genetics  The three main forms are transcribed from different genes: * PPARŒ± - chromosome 22q12-13.1 (OMIM 170998) * PPARŒ≤/Œ¥ - chromosome 6p21.2-21.1 (OMIM 600409) * PPARŒ≥ - chromosome 3p25 (OMIM 601487). Hereditary disorders of all PPARs have been described, generally leading to a loss in function and concomitant lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and/or acanthosis nigricans. Of PPARŒ≥, a gain-of-function mutation has been described and studied (Pro12Ala) which decreased the risk of insulin resistance; it is quite prevalent (allele frequency 0.03 - 0.12 in some populations). In contrast, pro115gln is associated with obesity. Some other polymorphisms have high incidence in populations with elevated body mass indexes.  Structure  Like other nuclear receptors, PPARs are modular in structure and contain the following functional domains: * (A/B) N-terminal region * (C) DBD (DNA-binding domain) * (D) flexible hinge region * (E) LBD (ligand binding domain) * (F) C-terminal region The DBD contains two zinc finger motifs, which bind to specific sequences of DNA known as hormone response elements when the receptor is activated. The LBD has an extensive secondary structure consisting of 13 alpha helices and a beta sheet. Natural and synthetic ligands bind to the LBD, either activating or repressing the receptor.  Pharmacology and PPAR modulators  PPARŒ± and PPARŒ≥ are the molecular targets of a number of marketed drugs. For instance the hypolipidemic fibrates activate PPARŒ±, and the anti diabetic thiazolidinediones activate PPARŒ≥. The synthetic chemical perfluorooctanoic acid activates PPARŒ± while the synthetic perfluorononanoic acid activates both PPARŒ± and PPARŒ≥. Berberine activates PPARŒ≥, as well as other natural compounds from different chemical classes.

Acknowledgments are distinct from jurats, verifications, and attestations. A jurat differs from an acknowledgement in that a jurat lacks the statement that the instrument is the act or deed of the party executing it. A verification is distinct in that it seeks to verify the factual contents of the instrument, rather than the instrument itself. Finally, an attestation occurs where a third person gives his or her name as a witness to the actual execution of an instrument.

He is regarded as one of the most important Barbary corsairs.  Early career  Born into an Albanian family on Rhodes in 1534 he began his career when he joined the crew of Turgut Reis at a very young age. He also fought alongside Piri Reis in several expeditions. In 1534 Murat Reis accompanied Hayreddin Barbarossa Pasha to Constantinople where they were received by Suleiman I and appointed to take command of the Ottoman fleet. While in Constantinople, Murat Reis participated in the construction of new warships at the naval arsenal on the Golden Horn.  Battle of Preveza  Murat Reis fought in the center-rear wing of Turgut Reis at the naval Battle of Preveza in 1538 Murat Reis took part in all of the early naval campaigns of Turgut Reis. On September 25 and 26, 1538, he was assigned with the task of preventing the ships of the Holy League under the command of Andrea Doria from landing at Preveza, and he successfully repulsed them from the shoreline. On September 28, he took part in the main combat and played an important role in the Ottoman victory at the Battle of Preveza, where he fought along with Turgut Reis in the center-rear wing of the Ottoman fleet which had a Y-shaped battle configuration. He continued to accompany Turgut Reis until being assigned as the Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Ocean fleet.  Siege and conquest of Cyprus  In 1570 Murat Reis, in command of a fleet of 25 galleys, was assigned with the task of clearing the area between Crete, Rhodes and Cyprus for the build-up of the naval siege and eventual conquest of Cyprus. He was also assigned with the task of blocking the Venetian ships based in Crete from sailing to Cyprus and assisting the Venetian forces in that island. He continued to undertake this task until the eventual surrender of Famagusta, the final Venetian stronghold on the island.  Canary Islands  In 1585 he led the first expedition of the Barbary corsairs in the Atlantic ocean and captured several of the Canary Islands. During the attacks, among others he captured the Spanish governor of Lanzarote, who was later ransomed and released.  Mediterranean campaigns  Murat Reis was later assigned with the task of controlling the lucrative trade routes between Egypt and Anatolia which were often raided by the Venetians, the French and the Maltese Knights. In 1609, he heard of the presence of a joint French-Maltese fleet of ten galleys, including the famous Galeona Rossa, a large galleon armed with 90 cannons which was known among the Ottomans as the Red Inferno, under the command of a knight named Fresine, off the island of Cyprus, and sailed there to engage them. After successfully striking the enemy ships with cannons from both long distance and close range, he severely damaged the Red Inferno and captured the ship. Six out of the ten French-Maltese galleys were captured, along with the 500 soldiers aboard, and the total of 160 cannons and 2000 muskets which they carried. During the battle Murat Reis was seriously injured. In 1609 he took part in the siege of Vlor√´, during which he died.  Legacy  Several submarines of the Turkish Navy have been named after Murat Reis (see Oru√ß Reis class submarine). One of the municipalities that form the City of Algiers, which was once the regional capital of the Ottoman Vilayet of Algeria (1517‚Äì1830), is named Bir Mourad Ra√Øs (Murat Reis' well) in his honor. Under the name 'Morato Arr√°ez, he is mentioned in several literary works of the Spanish Golden Age, for example by Miguel de Cervantes and Lope de Vega.

On 27 July 1765, he was initiated into the Masonic Order. In the late summer of 1767, on his way to Genoa, the duke fell ill and had to be landed in the harbour of Monaco. Despite the care and attention he was given, he died in the Palace of Honor√© III, Prince of Monaco, on 17 September. The state bedchamber where the ill duke died has since been known as the York Room. After his death, his body was returned to London aboard , and is interred in Westminster Abbey.

The dedication reads: *Prince Edward is an important character in Norah Lofts' historical novel The Lost Queen (1969), chronicling the life of his youngest sister, Caroline Matilda, Queen Consort of Denmark and Norway as wife of King Christian VII. Edward is mentioned as having had a special link with her, stronger than with his other siblings.

Born Giovanni Dionigi Galeni, he was also known by several other names in the Christian countries of the Mediterranean and in the literature also appears under various names. Miguel de Cervantes called him Uchali in chapter XXXIX of his Don Quixote de la Mancha. Elsewhere he was simply called Ali Pasha. John Wolf, in his The Barbary Coast, refers to him as Euldj Ali.  Early life  Giovanni Dionigi Galeni was born to the seaman Birno Galeni and his wife Pippa de Cicco, in the village of Le Castella (near modern Isola Capo Rizzuto) in Calabria, southern Italy.Corsari nel Mediterraneo: Ulu√ß Ali Reis (Occhiali, Uluj Ali) His father wanted him to receive a religious education, but on 29 April 1536, when he was about 17, Giovanni was captured by Ali Ahmed, one of the corsair captains of Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha, and was forced to serve as a galley slave. As an oar slave in an Ottoman galley, he participated in the Battle of Preveza in 1538. Within a few years, he converted to Islam and became a corsair in the fleet of Turgut Reis by 1541. This was by no means unusual; many Muslim corsairs (privateers) were captured slaves who later converted to Islam. He was a very able mariner and soon rose in the ranks, gaining sufficient prize booty to buy a share in a corsair brigantine sailing out of Algiers. Further success soon enabled him to become the captain and owner of a galley, and he gained a reputation as one of the boldest corsair reis on the Barbary Coast. Uluj Ali was in the fleet of Turgut Reis, one of the most famous corsairs in the Mediterranean, as well as an Ottoman admiral and Bey of Tripoli. Sailing with Turgut Reis, he also impressed the Ottoman admiral Piyale Pasha, with whom Turgut joined forces on a number of occasions. Due to his success in battles, the administration of the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea was awarded to him in 1550. In 1560, he was among the forces of Turgut Reis and Piyale Pasha during the Battle of Djerba.Bizimsahife.com: Battle of Djerba (1560) In 1565 he was promoted to the rank of Beylerbey (Chief Governor) of Alexandria. The same year he joined the Siege of Malta with the Ottoman Egyptian fleet, and when Turgut Reis was killed during the siege, Piyale Pasha appointed Uluj Ali to become Turgut's successor as Bey of Tripoli. Uluj took Turgut's body to Tripoli for burial, assumed control of the province, and was subsequently confirmed as Pasha of Tripoli by Sultan Suleiman I. In the following years he conducted numerous raids on the coasts of Sicily, Calabria and Naples.  Pasha of Algiers  In March 1568, the vice-regency of Algiers fell vacant, and upon the recommendation of Piyale Pasha, Sultan Selim II appointed Uluj Ali to become the Pasha and Beylerbey of Algiers, the most powerful of the increasingly autonomous Ottoman eyalets in North Africa, which were governed by the corsair-admirals appointed by the Sultan. In October 1569 he turned upon the Hafsid Sultan Hamid of Tunis, who had been restored to his throne by Spain. Marching overland with an army of some 5000, he quickly sent Hamid and his forces fleeing and made himself ruler of Tunis. Hamid found refuge in the Spanish fort at La Goulette outside Tunis. In July 1570, while ostensibly en route to Constantinople to ask the Sultan for more ships and men in order to evict the Spaniards from all of North Africa, Uluj Ali encountered five Maltese galleys, commanded by Francisco de Sant Clement, then the captain-general of the Order's galleys, near Cape Passaro in Sicily and captured four of them in the action of 1570. (Sant Clement escaped, but on returning to Malta was condemned, strangled and his body put in a sack and dumped into the harbor.) This victory caused Uluj to change his mind and return to Algiers in order to celebrate. There, in early 1571, he was faced with a mutiny of the janissaries who demanded overdue pay. He decided to put to sea, leaving the mutinous soldiers to take their pay from anyone they could find and rob. Having learned of the presence of a large Ottoman fleet at Coron in the Morea, he decided to join it. It was the fleet commanded by M√ºezzinzade Ali Pasha that was to meet disaster at Lepanto a few months later.  Lepanto  On 7 October 1571, Uluj Ali commanded the left flank of Ali Pasha's fleet in the Battle of Lepanto. He kept his squadron together in the melee, outmaneuvered his direct opponent, Giovanni Andrea Doria, and captured the flagship of the Maltese Knights with its great banner. When the Ottoman defeat became obvious, he succeeded in extricating his ships, and gathered up the scattered remaining ships of the Ottoman fleet (some forty galleys and fustas) and others along the way to Constantinople, where he arrived with 87 vessels. There he presented the great flag of the Knights of Malta to Sultan Selim II, who gave him the honorary title of Kƒ±lƒ±√ß (\\"Sword\\") and on 29 October 1571 appointed him as Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral) and Beylerbey of the Isles. He was subsequently known as Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha.  Kapudan Pasha (1572 ‚Äì 1587)  Piyale Pasha and Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha immediately began to rebuild the Ottoman fleet. Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha placed special emphasis on the construction of a number of heavier ships modeled upon the Venetian galleasses, heavier artillery for the galleys, and firearms for the soldiers on board. In June 1572, now Kapudan Pasha, he set out with 250 galleys and a large number of smaller ships to seek revenge for Lepanto. He found the Christian fleet anchored in an inlet of Morea, but his strategy of trying to lure the enemy out and inflicting damage through repeated quick thrusts meant that a full-fledged battle never materialized, because the Christian fleet was too cautious to be trapped and encircled. In 1573 Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha commanded the naval campaign on the coasts of Italy. In that same year, the regency of Algiers was transferred to Arab Ahmed, and Don Juan of Austria, the victor of Lepanto, recaptured Tunis. In July 1574, Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha sailed to Tunis with a fleet of 250 galleys and a large army under the command of Cigalazade Sinan Pasha, captured the port fortress of La Goleta on 25 August 1574, and the city of Tunis on 13 September 1574. During this expedition, on 26 July 1574, the forces of Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha constructed an Ottoman fortress on the coastline of Morocco, facing Andalusia in mainland Spain.Tarih Sitesi: Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa In 1576 he raided Calabria and in 1578 put down another mutiny of the janissaries in Algiers who had assassinated Arab Ahmed. In 1584 he commanded a naval expedition to Crimea. In 1585 he put down revolts in Syria and Lebanon with the Ottoman Egyptian fleet based in Alexandria. Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pasha died on 21 June 1587 in Constantinople (Istanbul). He is buried at the Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa Mosque (1580), designed by the renowned architect Mimar Sinan.  Legacy  * He built the Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Ali Pa≈üa Mosque (1580) and Baths (1583) in Istanbul. * Several warships and submarines of the Turkish Navy have been named after him (see Kƒ±lƒ±√ß class fast attack missile boat and Oru√ß Reis class submarine). * His statue is in the center square of Le Castella in Calabria, Italy, where he was born.

After Argentinian President Juan Per√≥n died, the students from the left of the Peronist political party organized with fervor within the country's universities and with workers, were persecuted and imprisoned. There was a military coup in 1976 and people began to disappear. Partnoy was one of those who suffered through the ordeals of becoming a political prisoner. She became an activist of the Peronist Youth Movement while attending Southern National University (see Education). She was taken from her home, leaving behind her 18-month-old daughter, on January 12, 1977, by the Argentinian Army and imprisoned at a concentration camp named The Little School (La Escuelita). For three and a half months, Partnoy was blindfolded. She was brutally beaten, starved, molested, and forced to live in inhuman conditions. She was moved from the concentration camp to the prison of Villa Floresta in Bah√≠a Blanca where she stayed for six months only to be transferred to Villa Devoto prison in Buenos Aires. She spent two and a half years as a prisoner of conscience, with no charges. In 1979, she was forced to leave the country, coming to the U.S. as a refugee with her daughter where they were reunited with her husband in Seattle, Washington. In 1985, she told her story of what had happened to her at The Little School, in an eponymous book. The world began to open its eyes to the treatment of women in reference to the disappearances of Latin Americans. Alicia Partnoy has testified before the United Nations, the Organization of American States, Amnesty International, and the Argentine Human Rights Commission. Her testimony is recorded in a compilation of testimonials by the National Commission for the Investigation of the Disappeared. She currently lives in Los Angeles, California, CA and teaches at Loyola Marymount University. In June 2007, a collection of her poems appeared in the second issue of the avant-garde Hebrew poetry and criticism magazine Daka rendered by Eran Tzelgov.  Education  Alicia Partnoy worked towards a bachelor's degree in Literature at the Universidad Nacional del Sur, in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina. After her three years as a political prisoner, once in exile, she would continue her studies at the University of the District of Columbia and at the American University, where she obtained a Certificate in Translation. She holds a Master's degree and a PhD from the Catholic University of America.  Career  Over the years, Alicia Partnoy has served as part-time lecturer and visiting professor at several institutions. Since 1998 she has been at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, California, where she is a professor in the Department of Modern Languages and Literatures.  Publications  Alicia Partnoy is the author, translator or editor of twelve books and a chapbook. Partnoy's most famous work is her book The Little School: Tales of Disappearance and Survival in Argentina, written originally in Spanish (La Escuelita: Relatos testimoniales), but published in her home country, Argentina, twenty years after the English edition was released in the U.S. and England. A French translation has been published by Zinnia Editions, and a Bengali translation by an alternative publishing house in Kolkata, was published in 2015. A Hebrew translation is forthcoming. Partnoy also authored the following poetry collections: Flowering Fires / Fuegos florales, Venganza de la manzana / Revenge of the Apple, and Volando bajito / Little Low Flying, as well as the chapbook Ecos l√≥gicos y otros poemares and, with her daughter Ruth Irup√© Sanabria, the children's book ¬°Escuch√°! Cuentos y versitos para los m√°s chiquitos, which includes poetry and short stories sent to Ruth from the Villa Devoto prison where her mother was held prisoner. Additionally, Partnoy edited the books Para mi hija Silvia / For My Daughter Silvia (by author Evangelina Arce, a mother of Ciudad Juarez), Las ramas hacia el mundo: antolog√≠a familiar, You Can't Drown the Fire: Latin American Women Writing in Exile, and, with Christina Fialho and Kristina Shull, Call Me Libertad: Poems between Borders. Partnoy has written numerous academic articles and has contributed chapters to Women Writing Resistance: Essays on Latin America and the Caribbean, Loss and Hope: Global, Interreligious and Interdisciplinary Perspectives, and Representing Humanity in an Age of Terror. Partnoy most recently co-authored with Martina Ramirez Happier as a Woman: Transforming Friendships, Transforming Lives.

She was given a life sentence for the attempted assassination and was released from prison on December 31, 2007, after serving 32 years. Moore and Lynette \\"Squeaky\\" Fromme are the only two women to have attempted to assassinate an American president; both of their attempts were on Gerald Ford and both took place in California within three weeks of one another. Background Moore was born in Charleston, West Virginia, the daughter of Ruth (n√©e Moore) and Olaf Kahn. Her paternal grandparents were German immigrants. Moore had been a nursing school student, Women's Army Corps recruit, and accountant. Divorced five times, she had four children before she turned to revolutionary politics in 1975. Moore comes from a Christian background. She later began practicing Judaism. Moore's friends said that she had a fascination and an obsession with Patricia Hearst. After Hearst was kidnapped by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA), her father Randolph Hearst created the organization People In Need (PIN) to feed the poor as a response to the SLA's claims that the elder Hearst was \\"committing 'crimes' against 'the people. Moore, a volunteer bookkeeper for PIN, had been serving as an FBI informant there until the moment she attempted to assassinate Ford. Attempted assassination of Gerald Ford Reaction right after the assassination attempt Moore had been evaluated by the Secret Service earlier in 1975, but agents decided that she posed no danger to the president. She had been picked up by police on an illegal-handgun charge the day before the Ford incident, but was released. The police confiscated her .44 caliber revolver and 113 rounds of ammunition. Moore's assassination attempt took place in San Francisco on September 22, 1975, just 17 days after Lynette \\"Squeaky\\" Fromme's attempted assassination of Ford. She was standing in the crowd across the street from the St. Francis Hotel, and was about away from Ford when she fired a single shot at him with a .38 caliber revolver. She was using a gun she bought in haste that same morning and did not know the sights were 15 cm (6 inches) off the point-of-impact at that distance, and she narrowly missed. After realizing she had missed, she raised her arm again, and Oliver Sipple, a former Marine, dived towards her and grabbed her arm, possibly saving Ford's life. Sipple said at the time: \\"I saw [her gun] pointed out there and I grabbed for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off.\\"Seattle Times. \\"Ford 'won't cower' after shooting.\\" September 23, 1975. The bullet from the second shot ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver. Ludwig survived.Caught in Fate's Trajectory, Along With Gerald Ford, Lynne Duke, The Washington Post, December 30, 2006, p. D01. U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti, who sentenced Moore, voiced his opinion that Moore would have killed Ford had she had her own gun, and it was only \\"because her gun was faulty\\" that the president's life was spared. Trial and imprisonment Moore pleaded guilty to attempted assassination and was sentenced to life in prison. At her sentencing hearing Moore stated: \\"Am I sorry I tried? Yes and no. Yes, because it accomplished little except to throw away the rest of my life. And, no, I'm not sorry I tried, because at the time it seemed a correct expression of my anger.\\" She served her term at the federal women's prison in Dublin, California, where she worked in the UNICOR prison labor program for $1.25 per hour as the Lead Inmate Operating Accountant. Moore had the Federal Bureau of Prisons register number 04851-180.\\"Sara Jane Moore.\\" Federal Bureau of Prisons. Retrieved on January 9, 2010. In an interview in 2004, former President Ford described Moore as \\"off her mind\\" and said that he continued making public appearances, even after two attempts on his life within such a short time, because \\"a president has to be aggressive, has to meet the people.\\" =Release= On December 31, 2007, at age 77, Moore was slated to be released from prison on parole after serving 32 years of her life sentence. Ford had died from natural causes on December 26, 2006, one year and five days before her release. Moore has stated that she regrets the assassination attempt, saying she was \\"blinded by her radical political views\\". Moore was released under a federal law that makes parole mandatory for inmates who have served at least 30 years of a life sentence and have maintained a satisfactory disciplinary record. When asked about her crime in an interview, Moore stated, \\"I am very glad I did not succeed. I know now that I was wrong to try.\\" In February 2019, Moore was arrested for violating her parole by failing to tell her parole officer of a trip out of the country. Media On May 28, 2009, Moore appeared on NBC's Today program, her first television appearance since leaving prison on parole.NBC News msnbc.com Moore also discussed her 1979 escape from prison. She revealed that an inmate told her, \\"when jumping the fence just put your hand on the barbed wire, you'll only have a few puncture wounds.\\" She went on to say, \\"If I knew that I was going to be captured several hours later, I would have stopped at the local bar just to get a drink and a burger.\\" Excerpts from an interview with Moore by Latif Nasser appear on an episode of the radio program Radiolab titled \\"Oliver Sipple\\", which was released on September 22, 2017. In the interview, Moore discusses the scene from the day she attempted to assassinate President Ford and her perspective of being stopped by Oliver Sipple. Trivia Moore's story is one of nine assassins starring in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman's musical Assassins. Moore, John Wilkes Booth, Charles J. Guiteau and Leon Czolgosz appear in \\"The Gun Song\\". A biography of Moore called Taking Aim at the President was published in 2009 by Geri Spieler, a writer who had a correspondence with Moore for 28 years.

Established in the 1980s in Roy, Utah, as Iomega, LenovoEMC has sold more than 410 million digital storage drives and disks. It was formerly a public company. The Zip drive was Iomega's most notable product.International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 21. St. James Press, 1998. Operations Lenovo announced the construction of a research and development facility near S√£o Paulo, Brazil, in November 2013. This facility will be dedicated to enterprise software and supporting LenovoEMC's development of high-end servers and cloud storage. Construction will cost $100 million and about 100 will be employed at the facility. It will be located in the University of Campinas Science and Technology Park, about 60 miles from S√£o Paulo.  History  Iomega logo Iomega started business in Roy, Utah in 1980 (the firm moved its headquarters to San Diego in 2001). For many years, the firm was a significant name in the data storage industry. Iomega's most famous product, the Zip Drive, was revolutionary as it offered relatively large amounts of storage on easily portable compact cartridges. The original Zip disk's 100MB capacity was a huge improvement over the 1.44MB limitation of floppy disks. The Zip Drive became a common internal and external peripheral for IBM-compatible computers and Macs. However, Zip disk cartridges sometimes failed after a short period, (commonly referred to as the \\"click of death\\"). This problem, combined with competition from CD-RW drives, caused Zip Drive sales to decline dramatically, despite later efforts to introduce larger 250MB and 750MB disk versions. Iomega eventually launched a CD-RW drive. Without the revenue from its proprietary storage cartridges, Iomega's sales and profits declined considerably. Iomega's stock price, which was over $100 at its height in the 1990s, dipped to around $2 in the mid-2000s. Trying to find a niche for itself, Iomega released devices such as the HipZip MP3 player, the FotoShow Digital Image Center, and numerous external hard drives, optical drives, and NAS products. None of these products were successful. In 2012, reporter Vincent Verweij of Dutch broadcaster Katholieke Radio Omroep revealed that the contents of at least 16,000 Iomega NAS devices were publicly available on the internet. This was due to the devices being sold with password security disabled by default. Among those affected were KLM, ING Group, and Ballast Nedam, who all had confidential material leaked in this manner. Iomega USA acknowledged the problem and said future models (starting February 2013) would come with password security enabled by default. The company said it would clearly instruct users about the risks of unsecured data.\\"A Gift for the Hackers\\", produced by Katholieke Radio Omroep, distributed on YouTube by Journeyman Pictures =Acquisition by EMC= The signing ceremony that created LenovoEMC joint venture On April 8, 2008, EMC Corporation announced plans to acquire Iomega for US$213 million.Press release EMC To Acquire Iomega.

The document has been lost and now only survives in two sets of photographs. The text purports to be an epistle of Clement of Alexandria and contains the only known references to a \\"Secret Gospel of Mark\\". Discovery and disappearance In 1973 Morton Smith published a book on a previously unknown letter of Clement of Alexandria.Morton Smith, Clement of Alexandria and a Secret Gospel of Mark (Harvard University Press) 1973 He stated that, while cataloging documents at the ancient monastery of Mar Saba in the summer of 1958, he discovered the text of the letter handwritten into the endpapers of Isaac Vossius' 1646 printed edition of the works of Ignatius of Antioch. This letter is consequently referred to as the Mar Saba letter of Clement of Alexandria. Smith also published a second book for the popular audience in 1974.Morton Smith, The Secret Gospel: The Discovery and Interpretation of the Secret Gospel According to Mark, London Victor Gollancz Ltd. 1974 . Smith's books reproduced black-and-white photographs which he stated he had taken at the time of the discovery. In 1976 a group of four scholarsProfessors David Flusser and Shlomo Pines, both of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Archimandrite Meliton of the Patriarchate, and G.A.G. Stroumsa, at the time a Harvard graduate student. visited Mar Saba, and viewed the manuscript. This visit remained unknown until 2003 when one of the party, G.A.G. Stroumsa, published an account of the visit.Gedaliahu A. G. Stroumsa, \\"Comments on Charles Hedrick's article: a testimony\\", Journal of Early Christian Studies 11.2 (Summer 2003), pp 147-53. In 1977 the volume containing the manuscript was taken to the library of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchate in Jerusalem. That same year, the manuscript pages were removed from the bound volume by the librarian Kallistos Dourvas, to be photographed and kept separately. These photographs were published in 2000. Subsequent attempts by scholars to view the manuscript have been unsuccessful. Paleographers, working from Smith's photographs, have assigned dates from the late seventeenth to the early nineteenth centuries.Merkel, Helmut. Auf den Spuren des Urmarkus? Ein neuer Fund und seine Beurteilung. Zeitschrift f√ºr Theologie und Kirche 71 (1974): 123-144. p. 106 Text The letter, addressed to one Theodore, discusses a \\"Secret Gospel of Mark\\" and quotes two excerpts from this gospel, one of which mentions \\"the mystery of the kingdom of God.\\" Clement begins by commending Theodore's actions against the Carpocratians. He then turns to address questions posed by Theodore regarding the Gospel of Mark, a secret variant of which the Carpocratians claim to have. Clement admits to knowledge of a second secret or mystical version of the gospel, written by Mark for \\"those being perfected\\". However, he asserts that the version promoted by the Carpocratians is not an accurate representation of this; they have corrupted the original with their own false additions. To illustrate this, two ostensibly genuine excerpts from the gospel are supplied. The letter breaks off abruptly as Clement begins to explain the passages. Controversy over authenticity Scholars Philip Jenkins and Robert M. Price noticed parallels between The Secret Gospel of Mark and a novel by James Hunter published in 1940 entitled The Mystery of Mar Saba.Hypotyposeis blogEvans, Craig A. Exploring the origins of the Bible: canon formation in historical, 2008 p. 272: \\"The entire story ‚Äî finding a long-lost document in the Mar Saba Monastery that is potentially embarrassing to Christianity ‚Äî is adumbrated by James Hunter's The Mystery of Mar Saba. Indeed, one of the heroes of the story, who helps to unmask the perpetrators and expose the fraud, is Scotland Yard Inspector Lord Moreton.\\" In 1980 the Mar Saba letter was included in the revision of the standard edition of works of Clement of Alexandria: Otto St√§hlin and Ursula Treu, Clemens Alexandrinus, vol. 4.1: Register, 2nd ed. (Berlin:Akademie-Verlag, 1980), XVII‚ÄìXVIII. Nevertheless, doubts have been expressed about its authenticity. In a 1975 review of Smith's book, Quentin Quesnell raised doubts about the original manuscript and suggested that it was a forgery executed sometime between 1936 and 1958. Though Quesnell did not specifically accuse Smith, in the view of Charles W. Hedrick he \\"broadly hinted\\" that Smith was the culprit. When Quesnell wrote this, no scholar other than Smith had reported having seen the manuscript. In 2005 Stephen Carlson published Gospel Hoax: Morton Smith's Invention of Secret Mark, which also asserted that the manuscript was a hoax. By this time independent confirmation of the manuscript's existence and appearance had been presented by Hedrick and others; Carlson argued that Smith had himself written the text into the book. Earlier in the same year, Scott Brown published Mark's Other Gospel: Rethinking Morton Smith's Controversial Discovery. In this book he wrote that the Secret Gospel of Mark was an authentic writing of the evangelist. Many scholars who accept the letter as a copy of an ancient manuscript believe that it is not the work of the historical Clement. There seems to have been another pseudo-Clement, who was mentioned in the Decretum Gelasianum as \\"the other Clement of Alexandria.\\"The Development of the Canon of the New Testament - The Decretum Gelasianum The central element of initiation and progress to \\"the innermost sanctuary of that truth hidden by seven veils\\" is common to Gnostic writings and to the mystery religions of the period. Even so, Clement believed Christianity to be the pure representative of God's true Mysteries which others had stolen and corrupted: > Haste, Tiresias; believe, and thou wilt see. Christ, by whom the eyes of the > blind recover sight, will shed on thee a light brighter than the sun; night > will flee from thee, fire will fear, death will be gone; thou, old man, who > saw not Thebes, shalt see the heavens. O truly sacred mysteries! O stainless > light! My way is lighted with torches, and I survey the heavens and God; I > become holy whilst I am initiated. The Lord is the hierophant, and seals > while illuminating him who is initiated, and presents to the Father him who > believes, to be kept safe for ever. Such are the reveries of my mysteries. > If it is thy wish, be thou also initiated; and thou shall join the choir > along with angels around the unbegotten and indestructible and the only true > God, the Word of God, raising the hymn with us. ‚Äî Clement, Exhortation to > the Heathen, xii Whether or not the document is a forgery, and if so, who the forger might be remains unresolved.Solow, Andrew R., and Woollcott K.

His book Innumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and its Consequences (1988) was a bestseller and A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper (1995) extended the critique. In his books Paulos discusses innumeracy with quirky anecdotes, scenarios and facts, encouraging readers in the end to look at their world in a more quantitative way. He has also written on other subjects often \\"combining disparate disciplines\\", such as the mathematical and philosophical basis of humor in Mathematics and Humor and I Think, Therefore I Laugh, the stock market in A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market, quantitative aspects of narrative in Once Upon a Number, the arguments for God in Irreligion, and most recently \\"bringing mathematics to bear on...biography\\" in A Numerate Life. Paulos also wrote a mathematics-tinged column for the UK newspaper The Guardian and is a Committee for Skeptical Inquiry fellow. Paulos has appeared frequently on radio and television, including a four-part BBC adaptation of A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper and appearances on the Lehrer News Hour, 20/20, Larry King, and David Letterman. In 2001 Paulos taught a course on quantitative literacy for journalists at the Columbia University School of Journalism. The course stimulated further programs at Columbia and elsewhere in precision and data-driven journalism. His long-running \\"ABCNews.com\\" monthly column Who's CountingWho's Counting at ABC News deals with mathematical aspects of stories in the news.

According to the Book of Mormon, Alma () was a Nephite prophet who established the Church of Jesus Christ in the Americas during the reign of the wicked King Noah. One of the Book of Mormon's greatest figures, he is sometimes referred to as \\"Alma the Elder\\" as seen on the website of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to avoid confusion with his son, also named Alma, who is often called \\"Alma the Younger.\\" It is believed that he was born in roughly 174 BC. and his son Alma the Younger was born in roughly 126 BC. Narrative =Alma's conversion= While a young man, Alma was one of several corrupt priests who served King Noah in the land of Nephi. About 148 BC, a prophet named Abinadi was arrested for preaching repentance and condemning the wickedness of Noah and his people. Brought before the king and his priests, Abinadi emphatically urged them to repent and obey the gospel of Jesus Christ. Of all who heard him, only Alma was touched by Abinadi's words. When Alma began to defend Abinadi the king had Alma cast out and Abinadi burned alive. Fleeing for his life, Alma went into hiding and wrote down what Abinadi had said before the court. Alma began to preach the gospel in secret, emphasizing Abinadi's teachings \\"concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven\\" (). =Alma's followers= At a hidden retreat in the wilderness called the waters of Mormon, Alma baptized his listeners and organized the church of Christ among them. In time, King Noah found out where Alma's congregation was meeting, and, fearing insurrection, sent his army to destroy them. Being warned by God of the army's coming, Alma quickly led his band of approximately 450 converts into the wilderness for eight days, finally stopping in an uninhabited land which they named Helam. The people of Alma established the city of Helam there and prospered for many years, remaining faithful to God's commandments. =Return to Zarahemla= As the years passed, Alma and his people were discovered by the Lamanites and enslaved, placed under the authority of Amulon‚Äîa former priest of King Noah now united with the Lamanites‚Äîwho began to persecute Alma‚Äôs people, ‚Äúput[ting] tasks upon them, and put[ting] task- masters over them‚Äù (). Finally, in about 120 BC, Alma's people escaped the Lamanites and were led by God through the wilderness for twelve days until they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, then the chief Nephite population center. The people of Alma joyfully united with the Nephites and helped to strengthen the church of Christ in Zarahemla. Zarahemla's King Mosiah soon authorized Alma to serve as the first high priest over the Church in Zarahemla. Alma continued in this capacity for many years. When Alma's son, Alma the Younger, and the four sons of King Mosiah came of age they rebelled against the church and \\"were numbered among the unbelievers\\" (). However, as they went about to destroy the church an angel appeared and, in an experience similar to that of Saul on the road to Damascus, they were all converted. Like Saul, their subsequent efforts on behalf of the church overshadowed their previous efforts to destroy the church. Shortly before his death, Alma conferred the office of high priest upon his son. The Book of Mormon states that Alma the Elder \\"lived to fulfil the commandments of God\\" (). He died in about 91 BC. Descendants Alma had several notable descendants in the Book of Mormon narrative as shown in the family tree below:  Name  At the time Joseph Smith dictated the Book of Mormon, Alma was known only as a woman's name. Recent historical research indicates it may have been a masculine name among Jewish people around 600 B.C., which is the time Lehi left Jerusalem according to the Book of Mormon. A potential Hebrew meaning of the name may be \\"lad of God\\" and ‚ÄúHe [God] is bound.‚Äù Alma may possibly be traced to the Arabic root ‚Äòalama/‚Äô ‚Äòalima, suggesting ‚Äúknowing, erudite; distinguished; chief, chieftain.\\"  See also  * Book of Mosiah * The Record of Zeniff Notes References *.

Founded in 1919, the Moore School is located in Columbia, South Carolina and currently enrolls over 5,500 undergraduate and 800 graduate students in degree-seeking programs, including bachelor's, master's and doctorate degrees. The school is well known for its consistent high rankings in its program for international business. History The University of South Carolina (USC) began efforts to open a school of commerce as early as 1914. USC founded the school in 1919 and dean George Olson firmly established the school by the early 1920s. The school grew with the university, and by 1958, the school established the Master of Business Administration program. By 1963, AACSB gave the school full accreditation. The Professional Master of Business Administration (then called MBA-ETV) started in 1970. The Professional MBA program allows people in South Carolina to receive an MBA by taking part-time classes at remote locations and over the internet. Then in 1974 the school established its Master of International Business (MIBS). National publications hold the program in high esteem and the program continuously garners high rankings in international business. In 1998, Wall Street financier and USC graduate Darla Moore donated $25 million to the business school. In her honor the school was renamed Darla Moore School of Business, although sometimes shortened to the Moore School. The school combined its MIBS and MBA programs to form the International MBA program in 2002. The same year, the school started offering a specialization in international business for undergraduate students as a major. On April 23, 2004 the Moore School announced another gift by Darla Moore. She donated $45 million with the challenge to the university to match that sum. On September 22, 2011, the University of South Carolina broke ground on the new Darla Moore School of Business on Assembly Street next to the Carolina Coliseum. The new Darla Moore School of Business includes 35 classrooms and 136 offices for university faculty. Facilities The new Darla Moore School of Business building In August 2014, the Moore School took occupancy of its new home located at the corner of Assembly and Greene streets in downtown Columbia, SC. The building has created buzz not only for its iconic design by Rafael Vi√±oly Architects of New York, but also for its green features. The building's cantilevered and glass design maximize natural light within and, with its open interior, encourage openness and collaboration. The main level houses a visitors' center, a cafe, a trading room, and an expansive, open-air courtyard. The third and fourth levels will provide views below of the Palmetto Court, a green space that features groupings of sable palms, and the Pavilion, which will be used for lectures and special events. The new school was designed with interaction and collaboration in mind. Every level will have open spaces with flexible furnishings, outlets for technology and white boards that students, faculty, staff and others can use and adapt for meetings or team projects. Even the large open stairwells are designed to encourage interaction. The first floor is the learning level. It will feature a variety of classrooms, all designed with technology and flexibility for student collaboration in mind. It also will feature a 500-seat lecture and performance hall, the result of a partnership with, and support from, the School of Music. The cafe will have extended hours for serving visitors who attend events in the hall. The third floor will feature executive education, classrooms outfitted with advanced telepresence technology, administrative offices and a conference center with meeting spaces. Faculty offices and a research lab are located on the fourth floor. The roof, which will feature green turf to reduce heat and improve energy efficiency, is one of the myriad sustainable features of the building. Its design will maximize natural light and shade for cooling. Occupants will benefit from outdoor views and light, pristine air quality and control of heating, air and lighting in their own spaces. The building's design incorporates goals for earning a LEED Platinum and a Net-Zero rating, meaning that it will generate as much energy as it consumes. The Moore School was selected by the U.S. Energy Department to partner with its national laboratories in its Net-Zero Energy Commercial Building Partnership program. As a result of the partnership, the Moore School has benefitted from expertise in energy technologies and building systems and design and operating practices. Academics =Rank and reputation= U.S. News & World Report in its 2018 annual survey \\"America‚Äôs Best Colleges Guide\\" ranked the Moore School's undergraduate international business degree first in the United States. In the specialty of international business, the publication ranked the school No. 1 in the United States, a position the school has held for sixteen years. On the national level, in the latest ranking of graduate programs by U.S. News & World Report, the Moore School continued as the #1 American university in the international business category. The publication ranked the school #55 in the US in overall graduate business education. The Wall Street Journal ranked the Moore School 49th out of 51 national business schools in a \\"Regional Ranking\\" in the September 20, 2007 edition of the Journal. In the 2010 QS Global 200 Business Schools Report, the Darla Moore School of Business was placed 28th in North America. In the 2010 Public Accounting Report, the Masters of Accounting program was ranked 25th in the country. =Programs= Undergraduate After four years of study, undergraduate students finish their careers at the Darla Moore School of Business with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree. The program consist of 121 credit hours and combines a strong liberal arts background with practical business education. The core curriculum that every student studies includes marketing, management, finance and management science. After the core, usually in their junior year, students can choose a major or majors from the following areas: accounting, finance (corporate, investments, or financial services track), insurance and risk management, international business, management (entrepreneurship or human resources track), economics, marketing, management science (business information systems or global supply chain and operations management track), and real estate. The Undergraduate International Business major at the Moore School solidifies its international business rankings. Graduate =MBA Programs= International MBA The International Masters of Business Administration at the Darla Moore School of Business combines traditional business education with intensive language training in one of eight languages ‚Äì Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, or Spanish. In addition to the language tracks, the global track allows students to study the business and cultural issues of regions around the world without learning a language other than English. All tracks are 20‚Äì22 months, with the exception of Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese, which require 29‚Äì34 months of study to give students added exposure to the more complex languages and cultures of these countries. Students may also volunteer with the Peace Corps during the IMBA program, extending the program length to approximately 48 months. Students must be accepted separately to the Peace Corps' Masters' International Program. Students begin the program with an intensive core of business courses. The core lasts from July to December. In January, students begin language training in the country that natively speaks the language they are learning. Then around April 1, students begin a mandatory internship, ideally in the language they studied. After their internships are completed, students in both the language and global tracks return to the Moore School to continue their business education. Students take elective classes during their final two semesters either at USC or they may choose to complete a one-semester exchange. Professional MBA The Moore School designed the Professional MBA program as a part-time, 28-month MBA program for working professionals. Students have the options of taking classes in 20 locations throughout SC and one location in Charlotte, NC. Some classes are also broadcast over South Carolina's public television system, ETV. Although the program is over 36 years old, email and the internet are critical tools for students. The professors that teach in the program are the same professors who teach full- time students. =Other programs= Master of Accountancy The Master of Accountancy program is designed for students who have an undergraduate degree in accounting from an accredited university. The additional education provides the opportunity to specialize in a particular field of accounting, complete the professional examinations while in school, and meet the specific educational requirements to qualify for the CPA designation in some states. Although this program is a natural extension of study for students who have completed an undergraduate degree in accounting, it is open to anyone who satisfies the school's admission standards regardless of their undergraduate major. Master of Arts in Economics The Master of Arts in Economics program is designed to prepare a student for a career as a professional economist in government or business. The program also serves as an avenue toward further graduate work in the field of economics. Graduate course offerings in economics include business economics, human capital and manpower economics, quantitative economics, public finance, money and banking, economic history, economic theory, developmental economics, international economics, and industrial organization and public policy. Masters of Human Resources The MHR Program consists of 36 hours of course work plus a required six-hour internship. All internships are professional level, last at least eight weeks (most last 12 or more) and provide on-the-job experience in an actual human resources environment. Limited enrollment (approximately 30-35 new students per year) and small class size provide students with individualized attention. Master of International Business The Master of International Business Program is an interdisciplinary program that combines the development of international business expertise with an advanced understanding of international studies. The program is unique in its focus on political, economic, and socio-cultural dimensions of global business. The curriculum is designed to provide a broadened and integrative understanding of business and government interactions globally. Doctoral For those students who wish to enter academia, the Moore School offers two basic doctoral programs: Ph.D. in Business Administration and Ph.D. in Economics. These programs have a large amount of flexibility to suit the needs of each students. Graduates currently hold positions at University of Memphis, Cambridge University, Indiana University, University of Houston‚ÄìClear Lake, College of Charleston, University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Furman University, East Carolina University, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, the International Monetary Fund, BellSouth, and Bank of America.

The small removable disks store 35, 70, or 120 gigabytes and are hard-drive technology. Like a standard hard drive, the REV system uses a flying head to read and write data to a spinning platter. The removable disks contained the platter, spindle, and motor, while the drive heads and drive controller are contained within the REV drive. The drives allow for data transfer rates of about 25 megabytes per second. The REV was available as an external desktop model with FireWire, SCSI or USB 2.0 interfaces, an internal model with SCSI, ATAPI, or SATA interfaces, or an external server model which features a cartridge autoloader and SCSI interface. Iomega also offered a 320 GB network-attached storage appliance which features a built-in REV. The drives are compatible with Macintosh, Windows, and Linux operating systems, although some only with particular models or interfaces. This product, especially the server model, was marketed as a replacement of tape drive technology for enterprise data backup, with claims of higher reliability, greater speed, and random access capability. The REV was in many ways a successor to Iomega's Jaz drive, which uses a similar removable hard-disk-platter concept. However the Jaz design does not put the drive motor in the disk case. In some circles, REV drives are referred to as \\"RRD,\\" for \\"Removable Rigid Disk,\\" because SCSI REV drives identify themselves as \\"RRD\\" drives to the host OS. The disks are formatted with the UDF file system on Windows and Unix/Linux. On Apple systems, they may be formatted as HFS+ or UDF in Mac OS X. A seemingly-similar competing technology is RDX Technology. A key distinction, however, is that the REV drive heads and drive controller remain inside the drive when the hard-disk platter is removed from it. In RDX Technology, the drive heads are contained within the cartridge along with the platter and are removed along with it.

On February 22, 1974, he attempted to hijack a plane flying out of Baltimore/Washington International Airport, intending to crash into the White House in the hopes of killing President Richard Nixon. During the incident, Byck killed a policeman and a pilot but was shot by another policeman. Byck died by suicide. Early life Born to poor Jewish parents in South Philadelphia, Byck dropped out of high school in the ninth grade in order to support his impoverished family. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1954 and was honorably discharged in 1956. He married shortly thereafter, and fathered four children. Background In 1972, Byck began to suffer from severe bouts of depression after his wife divorced him and several job-related financial failures. He admitted himself to a psychiatric ward, for a two-month stay. Byck began to harbor the belief that the Nixon administration was conspiring to oppress the poor. Byck came to the notice of the Secret Service in 1972, when he threatened Nixon, whom he had resented since the Small Business Administration had turned down his loan application. Byck had also sent tape recordings to various other public figures including scientist Jonas Salk, Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut, and composer Leonard Bernstein; and had tried to join the Black Panthers. The Secret Service considered Byck to be harmless, and no action was taken at that time. Assassination attempt In early 1974, Byck made his decision to assassinate Nixon. He planned to do so by hijacking an airliner and crashing it into the White House on a day when Nixon would be there. It has been suggested (for instance, by the 2004 film dramatization of his life) that Byck was inspired by news reports of the buzzing of the White House by U.S. Army soldier Robert K. Preston in a stolen UH-1B Huey helicopter on February 17. Since Byck was already known to the Secret Service and because legal attempts to purchase a firearm might have resulted in increased scrutiny, Byck stole a .22 caliber revolver from his friend to use in the hijacking. Byck also made a bomb out of two gallon jugs of gasoline and an igniter. All through this process, Byck made audio recordings explaining his motives and his plans; he expected to be considered a hero for his actions and wanted to fully document his reasons for the assassination.Sam Byck Audio Tapes at YouTube On Friday morning, February 22, 1974, Byck drove to the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Shortly after 7:00 a.m. EST, he shot and killed Maryland Aviation Administration policeman George Neal Ramsburghttps://www.odmp.org/officer/10989-officer-george-neal-ramsburg before storming a DC-9, Delta Air Lines Flight 523 to Atlanta, which he chose because it was the closest flight that was ready to take off. After pilots Reese (Doug) Loftin and Fred Jones told him they could not take off until wheel blocks were removed, he shot them both and grabbed a nearby passenger, ordering her to \\"fly the plane\\". Jones died as he was being removed from the aircraft after the event was concluded; Loftin survived the attack. Byck told a flight attendant to close the door, or he would blow up the plane. Anne Arundel County policemen attempted to shoot out the tires of the aircraft to prevent its take-off, but the .38 caliber bullets fired from their police- issued Smith & Wesson revolvers failed to penetrate the aircraft's tires and ricocheted off, some hitting the wing of the plane. After a standoff between Byck and police on the jetway, AAC police-officer Charles Troyer fired four shots through the aircraft door at Byck with a .357 Magnum revolver taken from the deceased Ramsburg. Two of the shots penetrated the thick window of the aircraft door and wounded Byck; before the police could gain entry to the plane, Byck committed suicide by shooting himself in the head. According to a special on the History Channel, he lived for a few minutes, dying after saying \\"help me\\" to one of the policemen who entered the plane after he had been shot. A briefcase containing the gasoline bomb was found under his body. The plane never left the gate, and Nixon's schedule was not affected by the assassination attempt, although he was in the White House at the time. It was subsequently discovered that Byck had sent a tape recording detailing his plan, which he called \\"Operation Pandora's Box\\", to news columnist Jack Anderson. A review of records disclosed that Byck had been arrested twice for protesting in front of the White House without a permit, and that he later dressed in a Santa Claus suit for another protest. Loftin, the flight's captain, recovered and resumed flying airliners several years later. In 1987, an FAA document entitled \\"Troubled Passage: The Federal Aviation Administration During the Nixon‚ÄìFord Term 1973‚Äì1977\\" was produced, which mentioned Byck's failed hijacking: \\"...though Byck lacked the skill and self- control to reach his target, he had provided a chilling reminder of the potential of violence against civil aviation. Under a more relaxed security system, his suicidal rampage might have begun when the airliner was aloft.\\" Legacy After Byck's failed assassination attempt and subsequent death, he faded into relative obscurity except among members of security organizations. The 9/11 Commission Report mentioned Byck's attempted assassination of Nixon on page 561 in note 21: In popular culture Byck is one of the (failed) assassins portrayed in Stephen Sondheim's and John Weidman's 1991 musical Assassins. His role in the musical is built largely around his tapes sent to Leonard Bernstein and other famous public figures, which he is depicted recording during two scene-length monologues, the first addressed to Bernstein and the second to Nixon himself. Byck also wears a Santa suit throughout the play in reference to a photograph of him protesting Nixon. A film based on his story, The Assassination of Richard Nixon, was released in 2004.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0364961/ The Assassination of Richard Nixon. Internet Movie Database (2004).

It forms the basis for much of modern chocolate, and is used in ice cream, hot chocolate, and baking.  History  The Dutch process was developed in the early 19th century by Dutch chocolate maker Coenraad Johannes van Houten, whose father Casparus was responsible for the development of the method of removing fat from cocoa beans by hydraulic press around 1828, forming the basis for cocoa powder. These developments greatly expanded the use of cocoa, which had been mostly used as a beverage in Europe until that time.  Taste and cooking properties  Dutch processed cocoa has a neutral pH, and is not acidic like natural cocoa, so in recipes that use sodium bicarbonate (often known as bicarbonate of soda, baking soda, or bicarb) as the leavening agent‚Äîwhich relies on the acidity of the cocoa to activate it‚Äîbuttermilk, yoghurt or sour milk should be substituted for the milk in the recipe, or a dash of cream of tartar can be used to provide some acidity in the batter. There is no need to add acidity when Dutch process cocoa is used in recipes that use baking powder instead of soda for leavening. The Dutch process: * Lowers acidity * Increases solubility * Changes color * Smoothes flavor Reduction of antioxidants and flavonols Compared to other processes, Dutch process cocoa contains lower amounts of flavonols (antioxidants). The effect this has on nutritional value is disputed. Professor Irmgard Bitsch of the Institut f√ºr Ern√§hrungswissenschaft, Justus-Liebig-University Giessen claims that the reduction of antioxidants due to the process is not significant and enough polyphenols and procyanidins remain in the cocoa. One study determined that 60% of natural cocoa's original antioxidants were destroyed by light dutching and 90% were destroyed by heavy dutching. However, natural cocoa has such high levels of antioxidants that even a 60% reduction leaves it high on the list of antioxidant-rich foods.

Born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway, he lived most his life in Copenhagen, Denmark. Svendsen's output includes two symphonies, a violin concerto, a cello concerto, and the Romance for violin, as well as a number of Norwegian Rhapsodies for orchestra. At one time Svendsen was an intimate friend of the German composer Richard Wagner. Life His father was a music teacher and Svendsen learned both the violin and clarinet from him. By the time he finished school, he was working as an orchestral musician, and occasionally made short concert tours as a violinist. In L√ºbeck, on one of his tours, he came to the attention of a wealthy merchant who made it possible for him to study from 1863-67 at the Leipzig Conservatory. He began his studies with Ferdinand David, but problems with his hand forced him to switch to composition, which he studied with Carl Reinecke. He completed his studies in Leipzig in 1867, receiving first prize in composition. During this period, Svendsen had a son out of wedlock, Johann Richard Rudolph (1867‚Äì1933). Gradually his attention turned to conducting. After spending time in Paris (1868‚Äì70) and Leipzig (1870‚Äì72), he returned to Christiania. In the summer of 1871, he went to New York City to marry Sarah (Sally, later changed to Bergljot) Levett Schmidt, whom he had met in Paris. He was conductor of the Musical Society Concerts in Christiania (1872‚Äì77), then spent three years in Germany, Italy, England and France. He returned to teach and conduct in Kristiania (1880‚Äì1883). In 1883, he was appointed principal conductor of the Royal Theater Orchestra in Copenhagen, where he lived until his death. Johan Svendsen, c.1890; portrait by Hans Heyerdahl. In 1884, he and his wife separated, and she moved to Paris. Their relationship had been chaotic for several years. A famous anecdote would have it that in 1883, in a fit of anger, she had thrown the only copy of his Symphony No. 3 in the fire. This incident was used by Henrik Ibsen in Hedda Gabler. If anything was caught up in the fire at all, it is rather unlikely it was anything near a complete symphony. However, some sketches, most likely for a symphony, were found by conductor Bjarte Engeset in 2007. They were elaborated and orchestrated by Bj√∏rn Morten Christophersen and premiered by the Bergen Philharmonic Orchestra and Engeset in 2011. Following a divorce from Sarah (10 December 1901), he married (23 December 1901) Juliette Haase, with whom he had been living and had three children. His younger son from this marriage was the famous Danish actor Eyvind Johan-Svendsen (1896‚Äì1946). 1898 Music festival in Bergen by Agnes Nyblin.

While Grieg composed mostly for small instrumentation, Svendsen composed primarily for orchestras and large ensembles. His most famous work is his Romance for violin and orchestra, Op. 26. He was very popular in Denmark and Norway during his lifetime, both as a composer and a conductor, winning many national awards and honors. However this popularity did not translate into acceptance into the international repertory of classical music. He died in Copenhagen, aged 70. Svendsen's first published work, the String Quartet in A minor, Op. 1, achieved great popular success. He quickly followed with the String Octet, Op. 3 and String Quintet, Op. 5, both of which added to his early fame. All of Svendsen's chamber music was written while he was at the Leipzig Conservatory, yet these works are not considered student works. By general consensus, Svendsen was regarded as one of the most talented students then at the Conservatory. His works won prizes and received public performances to much acclaim.

It is located in the historic region of Slavonia, near the border to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The first word in the name means New, and there's also an Old Gradi≈°ka nearby, the village of Stara Gradi≈°ka and the Bosnian town of Gradi≈°ka, previously known as Bosanska Gradi≈°ka. History Nova Gradi≈°ka in 1906 Nova Gradi≈°ka is often referred to as The Youngest Town. The town of Nova Gradi≈°ka was founded in 1748 as an outpost in the Military Frontier and was first named Friedrichsdorf in German. Already in 1750 it was renamed Neu-Gradischka which later became Nova Gradi≈°ka in the Croatian language. The Hungarian name is √öjgradiska. Before 1881, Nova Gradi≈°ka (named NEU-GRADISKA before 1850) was part of the Austrian monarchy (Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia after the compromise of 1867), in the Slavonian Military Frontier, Gradiskaner Regiment N¬∞VIII.Map of the Corinphila-Auktionen 2003. The first building constructed was the church of Saint Tereza, which is an important monument of baroque architecture in Slavonia. The old core of the town comprises the church of Saint Terezija and the old court house and prison from the 18th century. Between 1881 and 1918, Nova Gradi≈°ka was a district capital in the Po≈æega County of the Kingdom.

The church was damaged by the forces of the Republic of Serbian Krajina during the Croatian War of Independence. In XIX century the new Church of Virgin Mary on the town square was initiated. Aulic Council prevented the authorities of the Slavonian Military Frontier from destroying the church with intention to build a school at its place. Historically, there were also two Serbian Orthodox Churches in Nova Gradi≈°ka, one of them destroyed during the World War II and one during the Croatian War of Independence. Those were the Church of Saint Nicolas and the Church of the Holy Trinity. The Church of the Holy Trinity was the central orthodox church located at the town square. It was erected in 1824 at the spot of an earlier wooden church from 1955. The church was destructed by quisling Ustasha regime in 1941. The new neo-Byzantine Church of the Holy Trinity was complete in 1982 but it was detonated 9 times and destroyed during the Croatian War of Independence.

It is currently (as of 2012) published by Flying Buffalo, and has inspired several expansions. It is a satirical simulation of an end-of-the-world scenario fought mostly with nuclear weapons.  Gameplay  The game is a multiplayer game, with each player having a small cardboard playmat upon which cards are placed and revealed. It is intended to be played by 3 or more players, but can also be played with only 2. At the start of a game, each player is dealt a number of \\"population cards,\\" ranging in denomination from 1 million to 25 million people. Players must protect their population, as the total loss of population leads to player elimination. They are then dealt a number of cards, which may be of the following types: *Secrets which usually steal or reduce another player's population. *Propaganda which steal another player's population, but have no effect once war has started. *Delivery Systems usually missiles and bombers, which stay in play ready to hold a warhead. Later expansion sets add submarines and other options. *Warheads which are fitted to a Delivery System, or discarded if there is not one available for them. *Specials which are usually defensive cards to shoot down incoming missiles, or cards to increase the devastation caused by attacks. Initially, players take turns playing secrets. Once all players have played all secrets and replaced cards from the deck they can announce 'no secrets' and place two cards face down. Players then take turns during which they will play a third face-down card, and then reveal the oldest face-down card (first in, first out) and resolve it. Secrets and propaganda cards are resolved immediately upon being exposed, while missile launches take more than one turn to properly set up. The game begins in a Cold War, in which no one is yet at war and propaganda cards have full effect. Once players have a warhead fitted to a delivery system (for example by revealing a missile on one turn, then revealing a warhead on their next turn), they must launch an attack. When someone launches an attack, the threat of war is imminent. If the attack is successful, resulting in a nuclear detonation, (regardless if actual appreciable loss of life takes place) \\"war is declared,\\" the Cold War is over, and propaganda cards are now worthless until a player is eliminated, at which time the Cold War resumes. A truly successful attack reduces the target player's population; (bomb shelters and other civil defenses may mitigate against this); when a player's population reaches zero due to nuclear war, they may launch an immediate retaliatory attack (called \\"final retaliation\\") but they are noted as defeated. Often, a final retaliation will end another player's game, leading to a final retaliation by that player, and so on. Hence, in some cases, many players can be defeated in a series of tragedy in a single turn (via this mutual assured destruction method). If a player is knocked out with a propaganda card, no retaliation is allowed. If a player is eliminated by a secret while war is not declared, no final retaliation is allowed. The object of the game is to be the sole player remaining after all attacks are resolved. More often, final retaliation strikes remove all players in a chain reaction. Also, if the one and only 100-megaton bomb is exploded full force (not a \\"MIRV\\" device) and strikes a nuclear stockpile (very unlikely), a chain reaction ensues that destroys all life on the planet: everybody loses. If all players are eliminated from play, then there is no winner. Alternatively, a variant scoring system has been developed that determines a winner via a point system ‚Äî 1 point for a knock out, 2 points for a propaganda knock out, 3 points for a retaliation knock out, a variable number of points for position depending on number of players, and finally 2 points for surviving (with the survivor not necessarily being the points winner). This point system is seen by some game enthusiasts as a betrayal of the original sense of purpose for this game: to illustrate that nuclear war is a winless proposition no matter what. The delivery systems in the game reflect some of those in the American arsenal at the time each set was released, including the Polaris, Atlas and Saturn rockets. Other available delivery systems include the XB-70 Valkyrie deep penetration bomber, which had been cancelled several years prior to the base game's release, but which had two operational prototypes at the time; and the Convair B-58 Hustler, out of service for 35 years by the time it was introduced in 2004's Weapons of Mass Destruction.  Expansions  Flying Buffalo has released a number of expansions, many of which can be played separately or with the original game. Each expansion highlights the worries of the end-of-the-world scenarios‚Äîincluding actual, theoretical, and feared weapons‚Äîat the time of their releases. ;Nuclear Escalation (1983): Adds deterrents and defensive capabilities, space platforms, the \\"glow-in-the-dark nuclear death die\\", and more. ;Nuclear Proliferation (1992): Each player now represents a different country with unique special powers. Adds submarines, atomic cannons, and more. ;Nuclear War Booster Packs (1995): Packs of 8 random cards from a set of 47 new cards. ;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #1: 9 new countries, warhead cards, a set of population cards, a bumper sticker, and a player assistance chart. ;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #2 ‚Äî India/Pakistan War Variant (1999): Combines the Nuclear War game with the India Rails game. ;Weapons of Mass Destruction (2004): More cards for the game including new cards usable as either a missile or a warhead and a Deluxe Population deck featuring characters from Nodwick, Kenzer & Company and Dork Tower. ;Nuclear War Bonus Pack #3: Same as Bonus Pack #1 but with new style of deluxe population cards from Weapons of Mass Destruction. Reception In the December 1980 edition of The Space Gamer (Issue No. 34), Steve Jackson commented, \\"This is NOT an 'introductory' wargame ‚Äì it's not a wargame at all. It's a card game. Recommended for a quick social game or for when everyone is too sleepy to play anything complex.\\" In the December 1993 edition of Dragon (Issue 200), Allen Varney considered Nuclear War a classic. \\"It‚Äôs a sin for a multi-player design to throw out a player before the game is over, but in this venerable game, that‚Äôs the whole point.\\"  Awards  *Nuclear Escalation - Charles Roberts Award for Best Science Fiction Boardgame of 1983 *Nuclear Proliferation - Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Boardgame of 1992 *Nuclear War - inducted into the Origins Adventure Gaming Hall of Fame In 1999 Pyramid magazine named Nuclear War as one of The Millennium's Best Card Games.

The method may involve pyrolysis or thermolysis, or it may not (for instance, a simple mixture of ice and glass could be separated without breaking any chemical bonds, but organic matter contains a greater diversity of molecules, some of which are likely to break). If there are no chemical changes, just phase changes, it resembles classical distillation, although it will generally need higher temperatures. Dry distillation in which chemical changes occur is a type of destructive distillation or cracking. Uses The method has been used to obtain liquid fuels from coal and wood. It can also be used to break down mineral salts such as sulfates () through thermolysis, in this case producing sulfur dioxide (SO2) or sulfur trioxide (SO3) gas which can be dissolved in water to obtain sulfuric acid. By this method sulfuric acid was first identified and artificially produced. When substances of vegetable origin, e.g. coal, oil shale, peat or wood, are heated in the absence of air (dry distillation), they decompose into gas, liquid products and coke/charcoal. The yield and chemical nature of the decomposition products depend on the nature of the raw material and the conditions under which the dry distillation is done. Decomposition within a temperature range of 450 to about 600¬∞C is called carbonization or low-temperature degassing. At temperatures above 900¬∞C, the process is called coking or high-temperature degassing. If coal is gasified to make coal gas or carbonized to make coke then Coal tar is among the by-products. =Wood= When wood is heated above 270¬∞C it begins to carbonize. If air is absent, the final product (since there is no oxygen present to react with the wood) is charcoal. If air (which contains oxygen) is present, the wood will catch fire and burn when it reaches a temperature of about 400‚Äì500¬∞C and the fuel product is wood ash. If wood is heated away from air, first the moisture is driven off. Until this is complete, the wood temperature remains at about 100‚Äì110¬∞C. When the wood is dry its temperature rises, and at about 270¬∞C, it begins to spontaneously decompose. This is the well known exothermic reaction which takes place in charcoal burning. At this stage evolution of the by-products of wood carbonization starts. These substances are given off gradually as the temperature rises and at about 450¬∞C the evolution is complete. The solid residue, charcoal, is mainly carbon (about 70%) and small amounts of tarry substances which can be driven off or decomposed completely only by raising the temperature to above about 600¬∞C. In the common practice of charcoal burning using internal heating of the charged wood by burning a part of it, all the by-product vapors and gas escapes into the atmosphere as smoke. The by-products can be recovered by passing the off-gases through a series of water to yield so-called wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid) and the non- condensible wood gas passes on through the condenser and may be burned to provide heat. The wood gas is only usable as fuel and consists typically of 17% methane; 2% hydrogen; 23% carbon monoxide; 38% carbon dioxide; 2% oxygen and 18% nitrogen. It has a gas calorific value of about 10.8 MJoules per m3 (290 BTU/cu.ft.) i.e. about one third the value of natural gas. When deciduous tree woods are subjected to distillation, the products are methanol (wood alcohol) and charcoal. The distillation of pine wood causes Pine tar and pitch to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal. Birch tar from birch bark is a particularly fine tar, known as \\"Russian oil\\", suitable for leather protection. The by-products of wood tar are turpentine and charcoal. Tar kilns are dry distillation ovens, historically used in Scandinavia for producing tar from wood. They were built close to the forest, from limestone or from more primitive holes in the ground. The bottom is sloped into an outlet hole to allow the tar to pour out. The wood is split into dimensions of a finger, stacked densely, and finally covered tight with dirt and moss. If oxygen can enter, the wood might catch fire, and the production would be ruined. On top of this, a fire is stacked and lit. After a few hours, the tar starts to pour out and continues to do so for a few days.

Background According to the history compilation Samguk Sagi, he was the son of the previous king Gaeru. He became king upon Gaeru's death in 166 which was the 39th year of his reign.Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23 Relations between Baekje and the rival kingdom Silla became hostile after Gaeru had given refuge to a Sillan traitor Gilseon in 165, shortly before Chogo inherited the throne.Samguk Sagi, Scroll 23 Reign Chogo began attacking Silla in 167, and captured two castles, but the Sillans drove him and his army off. Chogo ran another campaign (188-190) against Silla, and captured several castles (Castles Mosan, Guyang, Wonsanhyang, and Yogeo). In 204, he destroyed Yocha. He also built new castles, including Castle Jeokhyeon and Sado, in captured territory, and settled people there in 210. The battles occurred around the Sobaek Mountains. In 214, he waged war against the Mohe. He led 1.000 soldiers to capture Castle Seokmun of Mohe, but the Mohe counter-attacked in the Sulcheon region of Baekje. In July 214 Silla also invaded Baekje, and captured Castle Sahyeon. Samguk Sagi: * 167 AD, autumn, seventh month. Troops secretly attacked two castles in Silla's western district. He captured 1,000 men and women and then returned. Eighth month. The King of Silla dispatched Ilgilcan Heungseon at the head of 20,000 troops to come and invaded several castles in the east of the country. The Sillan King also personally led 8,000 spirited cavalrymen and accompanied Heungseon. They went as far as the Han river when the King of Baekje determined the Sillan host was impossible to repel and returned that which had been plundered earlier. * 170 AD, spring, third month. On the last day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. Winter, tenth month. Troops were dispatched to invade the border with Silla. * 186 AD, winter, tenth month. There were no clouds but there was lightning. A comet was seen in the northwest. It disappeared after 20 days. * 187 AD, spring, fifth month. The wells of the capital and the Han River were all dry. * 188 AD, spring, second month. Extensive repairs were made to the palace. Troops were dispatched to attack the Mosan Fortress (Î™®ÏÇ∞ÏÑ±/ÊØçÂ±±Âüé) in Silla. * 189 AD, spring, fourth month. On the first day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. Autumn, seventh month. Baekje troops fought with Silla Guyang. They were defeated and more than 500 died. * 190 AD, spring, eighth month. Soldiers were dispatched to attack the district of Wonsan in the west of Silla. They advanced and surrounded Bugok Fortress. General Gudo of Silla then led 500 mounted troops to repel them, so Baekje forces feigned a retreat. Gudo pursued them to Wasan Fortress (ÏôÄÏÇ∞ÏÑ±/ËõôÂ±±Âüé) where the troops turned and gave battle and had a great victory. * 191 AD, autumn, ninth month. Chiugi (a type of comet) was seen in the horn and gullet constellations. * 199 AD, autumn, seventh month. There was an earthquake. Troops were dispatched to attack the Sillan border. * 204 AD, autumn, seventh month. Troops were dispatched to attack Yocha Fortress in Silla and sacked it. They killed the lord of the fortress, Seolbu. The King of Silla, Naehae of Silla, was furious and ordered Ibeolcan Rieum to become general and lead six squadrons of spirited troops to come and attack Baekje's Saheyon Fortress. Winter, tenth month. A comet was seen in the Eastern well. * 205 AD, autumn, seventh month. Venus intersected with the moon. * 208 AD, autumn. Because of locusts and drought the crops did not mature. There were many incidents of thievery but the king consoled them. * 209 AD, winter, tenth month. There was a typhoon that uprooted trees. * 210 AD, spring, second month. The two fortresses of Jeokhyeon and Sado were built, and residents from the east were moved there. Winter, tenth month. The Malgal came and attacked Sado Fortress but were unable to take it. They burned down the fortress gate and then escaped. * 211 AD, autumn, eighth month. In the south of the country locusts damaged the crops and the people starved. Winter, 11th month. There was no ice. * 212 AD, summer, sixth month. On the last day of the month, there was a solar eclipse. * 213 AD, autumn, seventh month. In the western district a man named Hoehoe caught a white deer and presented it to the King. The King deemed it a felicitous omen and gave him 100 stones of grain. * 214 AD, autumn, ninth month. The King ordered Jin Gwa of the northern district to lead 1,000 soldiers to attack and take the Mohe castle of Seokmun. In the winter a powerful cavalry of Malgal came and attacked, coming as far as the Sul River. The King died. Legacy The 8th king Goi is said to be Chogo's younger brother.

Its mission is to collect samples from the atmosphere for the purpose of detecting and identifying nuclear explosions. It is also informally referred to as the \\"weather bird\\" or \\"the sniffer\\" by workers on the program and international media respectively. Operational history A WC-135B at Fairford in 1988. This aircraft remains in service as a WC-135W. The same aircraft seen at RAF Alconbury in 1992 The WC-135 was introduced in December 1965, replacing Boeing WB-50 aircraft in the weather-reconnaissance and air-sampling mission. Ten aircraft were initially converted from C-135B transport aircraft and were placed in service with the 55th Weather Reconnaissance Squadron at McClellan Air Force Base, California, with the Military Airlift Command (MAC). Detachments were located at various bases throughout the United States and worldwide. The aircraft occasionally took on other roles throughout their careers; several aircraft were temporarily assigned to the 10th Airborne Command and Control Squadron at RAF Mildenhall in the late 1980s and early 1990s as training aircraft so that the unit could slow the accumulation of flight hours on its EC-135Hs, while others served as staff transports on an as-needed basis. Upon retirement from frontline weather reconnaissance service in the early 1990s, five were retained for further use. Serial no. 61-2666 was converted to an NC-135 and remains in service as a testbed for RC-135 equipment upgrades. Serial no. 61-2667 was upgraded to a WC-135W, given the project name Constant Phoenix, and remains in service with the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron at Offutt Air Force Base, Nebraska. Serial no. 61-2674 was converted to the first OC-135B Open Skies observation aircraft, reentering service in 1993. It was later stored in 1997 and replaced with two additional aircraft also converted from WC-135s. In 1998, a former EC-135C, serial no. 62-3582, was converted into a WC-135C, also designated Constant Phoenix. In April 2018 it was announced that three KC-135R tanker aircraft would be converted as WC-135R Constant Phoenix aircraft to replace the two aircraft operated by the 45th Reconnaissance Squadron. The first aircraft is scheduled to be converted by L3 Technologies at Greenville, Texas starting in September 2019.Air Force Times \\"Air Force to start transforming tankers into WC-135 \\"nuke sniffers\\" in FY19\\" dated April 26, 2018 Mission The WC-135B and WC-135W Constant Phoenix atmospheric-collection aircraft support national- level intelligence consumers by collecting particulate debris and gaseous effluents from accessible regions of the atmosphere in support of the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963. Features The Constant Phoenix's modifications are primarily related to the aircraft's on-board atmospheric collection suite, which allows the mission crew to detect radioactive debris \\"clouds\\" in real time. The aircraft is equipped with external flow-through devices to collect particulates on filter paper and a compressor system for whole air samples collected in high-pressure holding spheres. Despite the different designations, both the C and W carry the same mission equipment (similar to the RC-135V and W aircraft). The interior seats 33 people, including the cockpit crew, maintenance personnel, and special equipment operators from the Air Force Technical Applications Center. On operational sorties, the crew is minimized to just pilots, navigator, and special- equipment operators, to reduce radiation exposure to mission-essential personnel only. =Vela Incident= WC-135B aircraft flew 25 sorties in 1979 to try to ascertain whether a double flash in the South Atlantic that was detected by a Vela satellite was a nuclear weapons test, however, the result was inconclusive. =Pakistan & India= The Constant Phoenix aircraft was used to gather information on the nuclear tests conducted by Pakistan and India in 1998. =North Korea= On October 6, 2006, Japan's Kyodo News agency reported that a US military aircraft, equipped to detect radiation from a nuclear test, took off from southern Japan. This was believed to be part of US efforts to prepare to monitor a North Korean nuclear test. On October 9, 2006, North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported that the country had performed a successful underground nuclear test. On October 13, 2006, CNN reported: \\"The U.S. Air Force flew a WC-135 Constant Phoenix atmospheric collection aircraft on Tuesday to collect air samples from the region. A preliminary analysis of air samples from North Korea shows 'radioactive debris consistent with a North Korea nuclear test', according to a statement from the office of the top U.S. intelligence official. The statement, from the office of Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte, was sent to Capitol Hill but not released publicly. CNN obtained it from a congressional source. The national intelligence office statement said the air samples were collected Wednesday, and analysis found debris that would be consistent with a nuclear test 'in the vicinity of Punggye' on Monday. The South Korean Defense Ministry told CNN that the United States has informed it that radioactivity has been detected.\\" The aircraft was based at Offutt AFB and was sent to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa to operate during the sampling missions.Timesonline.co.uk, Cold War aircraft searches the sky for proof of test. On June 17, 2009, JoongAng Daily reported, in reference to a purported May 25 nuclear test by North Korea: \\"The U.S. Air Force twice dispatched a special reconnaissance jet, the WC-135 Constant Phoenix from Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan, to collect air samples.\\"joongangdaily.joins.com, U.S. finds that North test in May was nuclear. On November 23, 2010, Sankei Shimbun reported that a WC-135 had been moved to Kadena Air Base in September 2010, in anticipation of a North Korean nuclear test. On January 31, 2013, the WC-135W was reported to be conducting surveillance flights out of Kadena Air Base in anticipation of another North Korean nuclear test. On January 6, 2016, the United States Air Force confirmed plans to soon deploy the WC-135 to test for radiation near North Korea to examine North Korea's claim that they had successfully conducted a hydrogen- bomb test on January 5 (EST). On September 8, 2016, it was reported that the WC-135 would soon begin surveillance flights near the Korean Peninsula after South Korean officials confirmed that North Korea conducted its fifth nuclear test at approximately 0:30 UTC. On April 12, 2017, it was deployed to Okinawa amid rising tensions with North Korea. North Korea conducted a missile test on April 3, 2017. On May 19, 2017, two Chinese Su-30 fighter jets intercepted a WC-135 over the East China Sea, prompting a formal complaint from the Pentagon. =Japan= On March 17, 2011, CNN reported that the WC-135W had been deployed from Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska to Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska. From there it assisted in detecting radioactive materials in the atmosphere around Japan, monitoring radioactivity released from the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant caused by the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami of March 11, 2011. =Europe= In 1986, the WC-135C was deployed to Europe to help monitor the air after the Chernobyl disaster. On February 17, 2017, it was reported that the WC-135C had been deployed to RAF Mildenhall. It was conjectured that this came in response to several reports of anomalous levels of iodine-131 coming from the Norwegian-Russian Border. As of April 10, 2017, there was no official cause of the iodine-131 release.

In the form of Œ≥-anhydrite (the anhydrous form), it is used as a desiccant. One particular hydrate is better known as plaster of Paris, and another occurs naturally as the mineral gypsum. It has many uses in industry. All forms are white solids that are poorly soluble in water.Franz Wirsching \\"Calcium Sulfate\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2012 Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. Calcium sulfate causes permanent hardness in water. Hydration states and crystallographic structures The compound exists in three levels of hydration corresponding to different crystallographic structures and to different minerals in nature: * CaSO4 (anhydrite): anhydrous state. * CaSO4 ¬∑ 2 H2O (gypsum and selenite (mineral)): dihydrate. * CaSO4 ¬∑ H2O (bassanite): hemihydrate, also known as plaster of Paris. Specific hemihydrates are sometimes distinguished: Œ±-hemihydrate and Œ≤-hemihydrate.Taylor H.F.W. (1990) Cement Chemistry. Academic Press, , pp. 186-187. Uses The main use of calcium sulfate is to produce plaster of Paris and stucco. These applications exploit the fact that calcium sulfate which has been powdered and calcined forms a moldable paste upon hydration and hardens as crystalline calcium sulfate dihydrate. It is also convenient that calcium sulfate is poorly soluble in water and does not readily dissolve in contact with water after its solidification. =Hydration and dehydration reactions= With judicious heating, gypsum converts to the partially dehydrated mineral called bassanite or plaster of Paris. This material has the formula CaSO4¬∑(nH2O), where 0.5 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 0.8. Temperatures between are required to drive off the water within its structure. The details of the temperature and time depend on ambient humidity. Temperatures as high as are used in industrial calcination, but at these temperatures Œ≥-anhydrite begins to form. The heat energy delivered to the gypsum at this time (the heat of hydration) tends to go into driving off water (as water vapor) rather than increasing the temperature of the mineral, which rises slowly until the water is gone, then increases more rapidly. The equation for the partial dehydration is: : CaSO4 ¬∑ 2 H2O -> CaSO4 ¬∑ H2O + H2O‚Üë The endothermic property of this reaction is relevant to the performance of drywall, conferring fire resistance to residential and other structures. In a fire, the structure behind a sheet of drywall will remain relatively cool as water is lost from the gypsum, thus preventing (or substantially retarding) damage to the framing (through combustion of wood members or loss of strength of steel at high temperatures) and consequent structural collapse. But at higher temperatures, calcium sulfate will release oxygen and act as an oxidizing agent. This property is used in aluminothermy. In contrast to most minerals, which when rehydrated simply form liquid or semi-liquid pastes, or remain powdery, calcined gypsum has an unusual property: when mixed with water at normal (ambient) temperatures, it quickly reverts chemically to the preferred dihydrate form, while physically \\"setting\\" to form a rigid and relatively strong gypsum crystal lattice: :CaSO4 ¬∑ H2O + H2O -> CaSO4 ¬∑ 2 H2O This reaction is exothermic and is responsible for the ease with which gypsum can be cast into various shapes including sheets (for drywall), sticks (for blackboard chalk), and molds (to immobilize broken bones, or for metal casting). Mixed with polymers, it has been used as a bone repair cement. Small amounts of calcined gypsum are added to earth to create strong structures directly from cast earth, an alternative to adobe (which loses its strength when wet). The conditions of dehydration can be changed to adjust the porosity of the hemihydrate, resulting in the so-called Œ±- and Œ≤-hemihydrates (which are more or less chemically identical). On heating to , the nearly water-free form, called Œ≥-anhydrite (CaSO4¬∑nH2O where n = 0 to 0.05) is produced. Œ≥-Anhydrite reacts slowly with water to return to the dihydrate state, a property exploited in some commercial desiccants. On heating above 250 ¬∞C, the completely anhydrous form called Œ≤-anhydrite or \\"natural\\" anhydrite is formed. Natural anhydrite does not react with water, even over geological timescales, unless very finely ground. The variable composition of the hemihydrate and Œ≥-anhydrite, and their easy inter-conversion, is due to their nearly identical crystal structures containing \\"channels\\" that can accommodate variable amounts of water, or other small molecules such as methanol. =Food industry= The calcium sulfate hydrates are used as a coagulant in products such as tofu. For the FDA, it is permitted in Cheese and Related Cheese Products; Cereal Flours; Bakery Products; Frozen Desserts; Artificial Sweeteners for Jelly & Preserves; Condiment Vegetables; and Condiment Tomatoes and some candies. It is known in the E number series as E516, and the FAO knows it as a firming agent, a flour treatment agent, a sequestrant, and a leavening agent. = Dentistry = Calcium sulfate has a long history of use in dentistry. It has been used in bone regeneration as a graft material and graft binder/extender and as a barrier in guided tissue regeneration. It is an unusually biocompatible material and is completely resorbed following implantation. It does not evoke a significant host response and creates a calcium-rich milieu in the area of implantation. =Other uses= Drierite When sold at the anhydrous state as a desiccant with a color-indicating agent under the name Drierite, it appears blue (anhydrous) or pink (hydrated) due to impregnation with cobalt(II) chloride, which functions as a moisture indicator. Up to the 1970s, commercial quantities of sulfuric acid were produced in Whitehaven (Cumbria, UK) from anhydrous calcium sulfate. Upon being mixed with shale or marl, and roasted, the sulfate liberates sulfur trioxide gas, a precursor in sulfuric acid production, the reaction also produces calcium silicate, a mineral phase essential in cement clinker production.Whitehaven Coast Archeological Survey : CaSO4 \\\\+ SiO2 -> CaSiO3 \\\\+ SO3 Production and occurrence The main sources of calcium sulfate are naturally occurring gypsum and anhydrite, which occur at many locations worldwide as evaporites. These may be extracted by open-cast quarrying or by deep mining. World production of natural gypsum is around 127 million tonnes per annum.Gypsum, USGS, 2008 In addition to natural sources, calcium sulfate is produced as a by-product in a number of processes: *In flue-gas desulfurization, exhaust gases from fossil-fuel power stations and other processes (e.g. cement manufacture) are scrubbed to reduce their sulfur oxide content, by injecting finely ground limestone or lime. This produces an impure calcium sulfite, which oxidizes on storage to calcium sulfate. *In the production of phosphoric acid from phosphate rock, calcium phosphate is treated with sulfuric acid and calcium sulfate precipitates. *In the production of hydrogen fluoride, calcium fluoride is treated with sulfuric acid, precipitating calcium sulfate. *In the refining of zinc, solutions of zinc sulfate are treated with lime to co-precipitate heavy metals such as barium. *Calcium sulfate can also be recovered and re-used from scrap drywall at construction sites. These precipitation processes tend to concentrate radioactive elements in the calcium sulfate product. This issue is particular with the phosphate by-product, since phosphate ores naturally contain uranium and its decay products such as radium-226, lead-210 and polonium-210. Calcium sulfate is also a common component of fouling deposits in industrial heat exchangers, because its solubility decreases with increasing temperature (see the specific section on the retrograde solubility). Retrograde solubility The dissolution of the different crystalline phases of calcium sulfate in water is exothermic and releases heat (decrease in Enthalpy: ŒîH < 0). As an immediate consequence, to proceed, the dissolution reaction needs to evacuate this heat that can be considered as a product of reaction. If the system is cooled, the dissolution equilibrium will evolve towards the right according to the Le Chatelier principle and calcium sulfate will dissolve more easily. The solubility of calcium sulfate increases thus when the temperature decreases. If the temperature of the system is raised, the reaction heat cannot dissipate and the equilibrium will regress towards the left according to Le Chatelier principle. The solubility of calcium sulfate decreases thus when temperature increases. This contra-intuitive solubility behaviour is called retrograde solubility. It is less common than for most of the salts whose dissolution reaction is endothermic (i.e., the reaction consumes heat: increase in Enthalpy: ŒîH > 0) and whose solubility increases with temperature. Another calcium compound, calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2, portlandite) also exhibits a retrograde solubility for the same thermodynamic reason: because its dissolution reaction is also exothermic and releases heat. So, to dissolve higher amounts of calcium sulfate or calcium hydroxide in water, it is necessary to cool down the solution close to its freezing point instead of increasing its temperature. Temperature dependence of the solubility of calcium sulfate (3 phases) in pure water. The retrograde solubility of calcium sulfate is also responsible for its precipitation in the hottest zone of heating systems and for its contribution to the formation of scale in boilers along with the precipitation of calcium carbonate whose solubility also decreases when CO2 degasses from hot water or can escape out of the system. On planet Mars 2011 findings by the Opportunity rover on the planet Mars show a form of calcium sulfate in a vein on the surface. Images suggest the mineral is gypsum.

She was sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment at the Nuremberg Doctors' trial, but served only five. A survivor of Ravensbr√ºck termed her, \\"a beast masquerading as a human\\". Education and Nazi Party membership In 1937, Oberheuser obtained her medical degree in Bonn, having specialized in dermatology. Soon thereafter she joined the Nazi Party as an intern, and later served as doctor for the League of German Girls. In 1940, Oberheuser was appointed to serve as an assistant to Karl Gebhardt, then Chief Surgeon of the Schutzstaffel and Heinrich Himmler's personal doctor. War crimes Oberheuser and Gebhardt came to Ravensbr√ºck in 1942 in order to conduct experiments on its prisoners, with an emphasis on finding better methods of treating infection. They conducted gruesome medical experiments (treating purposely infected wounds with sulfanilamide, as well as bone, muscle, and nerve regeneration and transplantation) on 86 women, 74 of whom were Polish political prisoners in the camp.  Trial  Herta Oberheuser was the only female defendant in the Nuremberg \\"Doctors' trial\\", where she was convicted of crimes against humanity and sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Later life  Oberheuser was released in April 1952 for good behaviour and became a family doctor in Stocksee, near Kiel, in West Germany. She lost her position in August 1958 after a Ravensbr√ºck survivor recognized her, and the interior minister of Schleswig-Holstein, Helmut Lemke, revoked her medical license and shut down her practice. Oberheuser appealed to the Schleswig- Holstein administrative court, which rejected the appeal in December 1960. She did not practice medicine again and was fined as punishment. She died in January 1978 at the age of 66.

He shared one-half of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1989 for this work with Hans Georg Dehmelt; the other half of the Prize in that year was awarded to Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr. Early life Wolfgang Paul was born on 10 August 1913 in Lorenzkirch, Germany. He grew up in Munich where his father was a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry. After the first few years at the Technical University of Munich, he changed to the Technical University of Berlin in 1934 where he finished his Diploma in 1937 at the group of Hans Geiger. He followed his doctorate adviser Hans Kopfermann to the University of Kiel and after being drafted to the air force he finished his PhD in 1940 at the Technical University of Berlin. During World War II, he researched isotope separation, which is necessary to produce fissionable material for use in making nuclear weapons. Academic career For several years he was a private lecturer at the University of G√∂ttingen with Hans Kopfermann. He became a professor of Experimental Physics at the University of Bonn and stayed there from 1952 until 1993. For two years from 1965 to 1967 he was director of the Division of Nuclear Physics at CERN. Scientific results He developed techniques for trapping charged particles mass spectrometry by electric quadrupole fields in the 1950s. Paul traps are used extensively today to contain and study ions. He developed molecular beam lenses and worked on a 500 MeV electron synchrotron, followed by one at 2500 MeV in 1965. Later he worked on containing slow neutrons in magnetic storage rings, measuring the free neutron lifetime. He humorously referred to Wolfgang Pauli as his imaginary part. G√∂ttingen Manifesto In 1957, Paul was a signatory of the G√∂ttingen Manifesto, a declaration of 18 leading nuclear scientists of West Germany against arming the West German army with tactical nuclear weapons.

Its local government area is the City of Manningham. At the , Warrandyte had a population of 5,520. At the 2016 census, Warrandyte had a population of 5,502 and a median age of 43 years old. Warrandyte is bounded in the west by the Mullum Mullum Creek and Target Road, in the north by the Yarra River, in the east by Jumping Creek and Anzac Road, and in the south by an irregular line from Reynolds Road, north of Donvale, Park Orchards and Warrandyte South. Warrandyte was founded as a Victorian town, located in the once gold-rich rolling hills east of Melbourne, and is now on the north-eastern boundary of suburban Melbourne. Gold was first discovered in the town in 1851 and together, with towns like Bendigo and Ballarat, led the way in gold discoveries during the Victorian gold rush. Today Warrandyte retains much of its past in its surviving buildings of the Colonial period and remains a twin community with North Warrandyte, which borders the Yarra River to its north. Etymology In Australian Aboriginal mythology (see dreamtime), a Wurundjeri dreamtime story tells of a great eagle; \\"the all powerful, ever watchful creator of the world\\", named Bunjil, who \\"once gazed down upon his people from the star Altair and saw their wrong doing. Awaiting their return, with a mighty crash of thunder, he hurled down a star to destroy them\\". Where the star struck created a gorge in which much of the town today is located. Bunjil's people remembered the spot, and referred to it as Warrandyte, speculated to mean \\"that which is thrown\\".Warrandyte Diary, Number 389, August 2006.\\" History In 1851, gold was first discovered in Victoria, in Warrandyte, at Anderson's Creek, by Louis Michel, the approximate location of the site is marked by a cairn on Fourth Hill, in the Warrandyte State Park. While some mining did occur in the area throughout the peak of the gold rush, it was not until the late 19th century, after gold discoveries reduced in the more popular regions, that the area around Warrandyte was intensively mined, particularly around Fourth Hill and Whipstick Gully. Some areas continued to be mined up until the 1960s. Warrandyte Post Office opened on 1 August 1857. Clara Southern, The Road to Warrandyte, ca. 1905‚Äì1910 In the early 20th century, Warrandyte became a popular destination for artists of the Heidelberg School, who sought subject matter further into the bush. This led to the development of an artists camp and small colony. Though not as substantial as the older colonies at Heidelberg and Box Hill, several artists, such as Clara Southern and Walter Withers, who were associated with the Heidelberg School, took up residence in Warrandyte.Hammond, Victoria; Peers, Juliet. Completing the Picture: Women Artists and the Heidelberg Era. Artmoves, 1992. , p. 26 Others followed, including Penleigh Boyd, Harold Herbert, Jo Sweatman and Gus McLaren. =Bushfires= Major bushfires have swept through Warrandyte throughout history, and the town was at the centre of the Black Friday bushfires in 1939, in which 71 people lost their lives. The 1962 fires also devastated North Warrandyte. Many houses were destroyed and many lifes lost. In 2009 the Black Saturday fires in Kinglake were 15 minutes away from North Warrandyte. On February 9th of 2014, a bushfire broke out in Warrandyte burning approximately 10 hectares and destroying 3 houses. Major bushfires to have swept through Warrandyte include: *1851 - 6 February \\"Black Thursday\\" *1939 - 13 January \\"Black Friday\\" *1962 - 14‚Äì16 January *2014 - 9 February Geography Pound Bend Tunnel was created by gold miners during the gold rush to divert the Yarra River Warrandyte is situated on the southern banks of the Yarra River. The river and hills surrounding the town were once rich in gold and the ruins of mineshafts and tunnels can be found throughout the Warrandyte State Park, amongst other locations. While the central town itself is nestled into a gorge on the river, the suburb covers a reasonably large area of land and can be divided up into the following sections: Central Warrandyte comprises the main street of Ringwood-Warrandyte Road and Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (Yarra Street), Pound Bend and the southern banks of the Yarra River. Andersons Creek flows from neighbouring South Warrandyte and Warranwood into the Yarra just before the beginning of Pound Bend. This area is where several gullies converge and create a geographical hole, with Fourth Hill to the east and the hills on the eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek to the west. This becomes evident when driving through Warrandyte on Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road, as the hills guide the road down towards Andersons Creek. The Eastern banks of the Mullum Mullum Creek were home to vast orchards overflowing from neighbouring East Doncaster and as a result, much of the vegetation has been cleared. Today the area is covered in large residential properties due to local council regulations allowing land to be subdivided into larger sites. Transportation Deciduous trees alongside the main street in Warrandyte during autumn Warrandyte is serviced primarily by the private car, however a bus service actively operates along the main roads of Ringwood-Warrandyte Road and Heidelberg-Warrandyte Road (Yarra Street). Community The Warrandyte Festival, one of the last remaining volunteer-run festivals in Victoria, is held every year in mid March. Typically, the festival features a variety of attractions. Many stalls sell local produce or crafts and there are numerous historical exhibits, as well as safety demonstrations by the CFA. Facilities Warrandyte contains a general post office, tennis courts, a community centre, an RSL, several bed and breakfasts, restaurants, a police station, a CFA Fire Station, two kindergartens, two recreational ovals (AFL Football and Cricket), Warrandyte Community Church, Uniting and Anglican places of worship, Andersons Creek Cemetery and a Scout hall, canoe launching ramps, a skatepark, nurseries and tearooms and the Crystal Brook Holiday Centre.Melways Street Directory, 33rd Edition 2006. It also has a thriving arts community including theatre, pottery and painting centred at the Mechanics Institute Hall.

Using cryo-electron microscopy it has been found that a much smaller periplasmic space is also present in gram-positive bacteria., Matias, V. R., and T. J. Beveridge. 2005. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals native polymeric cell wall structure in Bacillus subtilis 168 and the existence of a periplasmic space. Mol.

J Bacteriol. 188:6652-6660. The periplasm may constitute up to 40% of the total cell volume of gram-negative bacteria, but is a much smaller percentage in gram-positive bacteria. Several types of enzyme are present in the periplasm including alkaline phosphatases, cyclic phosphodiesterases, acid phosphatases and 5‚Äô-nucleotidases. Although the bacteria are conventionally divided into two main groups‚Äîgram-positive and gram-negative, based upon their Gram-stain retention property‚Äîthis classification system is ambiguous as it can refer to three distinct aspects (staining result, cell-envelope organization, taxonomic group), which do not necessarily coalesce for some bacterial species.Gupta, R.S. (1998) Protein phylogenies and signature sequences: A reappraisal of evolutionary relationships among archaebacteria, eubacteria and eukaryotes. Microbiol. Mol. Biol.

A phylum level perspective on bacterial cell envelope architecture. Trends Microbiol. 18:464-470. However, although Gram-staining response of bacteria is an empirical criterion, its basis lies in the marked differences in the ultrastructure and chemical composition of the two main kinds of bacteria. These bacteria are distinguished from each other based on the presence or absence of an outer lipid membrane, which is a more reliable and fundamental characteristic of the bacterial cells.Gupta, R. S. (1998). What are archaebacteria: life‚Äôs third domain or monoderm prokaryotes related to Gram- positive bacteria? A new proposal for the classification of prokaryotic organisms. Molecular Microbiology.29(3):695-707. All gram-positive bacteria are bounded by a single unit lipid membrane; they generally contain a thick layer (20-80 nm) of peptidoglycan responsible for retaining the Gram-stain. A number of other bacteria which are bounded by a single membrane but stain gram-negative due to either lack of the peptidoglycan layer (viz., mycoplasmas) or their inability to retain the Gram-stain due to their cell wall composition, also show close relationship to the gram-positive bacteria. For the bacterial (prokaryotic) cells that are bounded by a single cell membrane the term \\"monoderm bacteria\\" or \\"monoderm prokaryotes\\" has been proposed. In contrast to gram-positive bacteria, all archetypical gram- negative bacteria are bounded by a cytoplasmic membrane as well as an outer cell membrane; they contain only a thin layer of peptidoglycan (2‚Äì3 nm) between these membranes. The presence of both inner and outer cell membranes forms and define the periplasmic space or periplasmic compartment. These bacterial cells with two membranes have been designated as diderm bacteria. The distinction between the monoderm and diderm prokaryotes is supported by conserved signature indels in a number of important proteins (viz. DnaK, GroEL).Gupta, R. S. (2011). Origin of diderm (Gram-negative) bacteria: antibiotic selection pressure rather than endosymbiosis likely led to the evolution of bacterial cells with two membranes. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 100:171-182. In diderm bacteria, the periplasm contains a thin cell wall composed of peptidoglycan. In addition, it includes solutes such as ions and proteins, which are involved in wide variety of functions ranging from nutrient binding, transport, folding, degradation, substrate hydrolysis, to peptidoglycan synthesis, electron transport, and alteration of substances toxic to the cell (xenobiotic metabolism). Importantly, the periplasm is devoid of ATP. References Further reading * D. White, The Physiology and Biochemistry of Prokaryotes, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000, pp. 22\\\\.

It advocates for the independence of Saskatchewan and libertarian ideals. The party is led by Neil Fenske and is not affiliated with any federal party.  History  The WIP of Saskatchewan was formed on July 12, 2003, and nominated 17 candidates for the November 5, 2003 provincial election. These candidates won a total of 2,735 votes, or 0.64% of the provincial total. The former party president was Frank Serfas, and the former deputy leader was David Sawkiw. The party nominated eight candidates for the 2007 election, two in the 2011 election, and four in the 2016 election. The party is not affiliated with the Western Canada Concept Party of British Columbia or the British Columbia-based Western Block Party, and has made considerable effort to distance itself from Doug Christie, the leader of those parties. Whereas Christie has been mired in controversy for defending Holocaust deniers and has been accused of being an anti-Semite, the WIP of Saskatchewan has made an explicit statement in support of the State of Israel. The WIP of Saskatchewan also has no ties with the Separation Party of Alberta, the Western Canada Party, or the Alberta Independence Party.  Ideology  The WIP of Saskatchewan's platform is libertarian and secular in nature, a distinguishing feature from some of the other separatist parties in Western Canada. It supports fiscally conservative and socially moderate policies. Though the party was originally established with a pro-independence stance, in recent years it has focused less on separatism and has instead advocated for strengthened political power at the federal level for Saskatchewan, to combat the perceived notion of Western alienation.

The first aircraft was delivered to the 89th Airlift Wing at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland in late June 1998. Two further second-hand Boeing 757s were acquired in 2010 for government use although it is not clear which agency they are operated by; they have been frequently associated with the Foreign Emergency Support Team of the U.S. State Department.\\"Foreign Emergency Support Team (FEST)\\". US Department of State. Retrieved on May 8, 2013 The additional two aircraft, designated C-32B, have been modified with aerial refueling equipment and extended range fuel cells giving them a range.

Byeonhan was one of the Samhan (or \\"Three Hans\\"), along with Mahan and Jinhan. History This early part of the Three Kingdoms period is sometimes called the Proto‚ÄìThree Kingdoms period. Byeonhan, like the other Samhan confederacies, appears descended from the Jin state of southern Korea. Archaeological evidence indicates an increase in military activity and weapons production among the Byeonhan in the 3rd century, especially an increase in iron arrowheads and cuirasses (Barnes 2000). This may be associated with the decline of Byeonhan and the rise of the more centralized Gaya Confederacy, which most Byeonhan states joined. Gaya was subsequently annexed by Silla, one of the Three Kingdoms of Korea. Culture and trade The Chinese Records of Three Kingdoms state that the language and culture of Byeonhan was essentially the same as Jinhan, and archaeological artifacts show little difference. Byeonhan may have simply referred to the chiefdoms in the south and west of the Nakdong River valley which were not formal members of the Jinhan confederacy. According to the 3rd-century Chinese chronicle Records of Three Kingdoms, Byeonhan was known for the production of iron; it exported iron to the Han commanderies to the north, Yamato Japan and the rest of the Korean peninsula. It was also a center of stoneware manufacture. Member statelets According to the Records of Three Kingdoms, Byeonhan consisted of 12 statelets: * Mirimidong (), present-day Miryang. * Jeopdo (), present-day Haman. * Gojamidong (), present-day Goseong. * Gosunsi (), present-day Jinju, Sacheon or Goseong. * Ballo (), present-day Seongju. * Nangno (), present-day Hadong or Namhae. * Gunmi (), present-day Sacheon. * Mioyama (), present-day Goryeong. * Gamno (), present-day Gimcheon. * Guya (), present-day Gimhae. * Jujoma (), present-day Gimcheon. * Anya (), present-day Haman. * Dongno (), present-day Dongnae.

In 1961 it was merged into the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). The word \\"STRAC\\" was also used to describe a well organized, well turned-out soldier or unit. Background STRAC was a designation given to the XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in 1958. The designation was, in reality, the assignment of an additional mission rather than a true designation. The additional mission was to provide a flexible strike capability that could deploy worldwide on short notice without declaration of an emergency. The 4th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, Washington, Combat Command A of the 1st Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, and the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, were designated as STRAC's first-line divisions, while the 1st Infantry Division at Fort Riley, Kansas, and the 82d Airborne Division at Fort Bragg were to provide backup in the event of general war. The 5th Logistical Command (later reflagged as 1st Logistical Command), also at Fort Bragg, would provide the corps with logistics support, while Fort Bragg's XVIII Airborne Corps Artillery would control artillery units.Mark A.

The 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment returned to the United States from Germany in February 1958, and was once again stationed at Fort Meade. The regiment became part of STRAC and, from 1958 to 1961, it was the recipient of four STRAC streamers, awarded for superior readiness and training. In reaction to the Berlin Crisis, the regiment redeployed to Germany in October 1961. Alerted for movement on 10 October, although scattered at different training sites along the Eastern Seaboard, the regiment arrived at its new duty stations of Baumholder and Kaiserslautern exactly thirty days later.http://www.hood.army.mil/3d_acr/docs/part_2.pdf STRAC and the XVIII Airborne Corps provided the Army forces to the Navy's CINCLANT as unified commander during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Flexible response September 1961, Fort Hood again became the home for the III Corps, and in February 1962, III Corps was assigned as part of the STRAC.http://pao.hood.army.mil/Sub/Hood_History.htm In March 1962 the 2nd Infantry Division was designated as a Strategic Army Corps (STRAC) unit. Following this the Division became engaged in intensified combat training, tactical training, and field training exercises, in addition to special training designed to improve operational readiness. Limitations Although the STRAC mission was to provide an easily deployable force for use in a limited war or other emergency, its ability to deploy overseas was limited by airlift constraints. Without the declaration of a national emergency, the required lift assets would not be released to support a STRAC deployment. The Army faced problems with both the Air Force who would provide the expected transportation and from foreign governments for the expected use of their airspace and airports.p.240 O'Connell, Aaron B.

He was also the President of Vanuatu for two brief periods lasting about a month each, during 1994 and 2004.  Biography  Maseng had been acting president of Vanuatu from January 30 to March 2, 1994, while he was speaker of parliament and an acting president was needed in the interval between the expiry of a president's term and the next presidential election. In the 2004 presidential elections, Maseng was one of 32 candidates, and a two-thirds majority in parliament was needed to win. Balloting started on April 8, but this session and another session on April 10 failed to result in the required majority for any candidate. In the fourth round of balloting on April 12 (Easter Monday), Maseng defeated the government's candidate, Kalkot Mataskelekele, by a vote of 41 to 16, and was sworn in immediately. He was removed as president on May 11, 2004, by the Supreme Court, which ruled that the election was invalid because of a rule banning people with criminal records from being elected. It had been revealed that he was serving a suspended sentence on corruption charges, including receiving stolen goods. He was a member of the conservative Francophone Union of Moderate Parties.

Until the building of Highbury Square it was the most developed garden square in London built as private housing. At one time it was home to more than 70 MPs, and at least 10 Lords. At the time of its construction its 1,250 upmarket flats were billed by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as the \\"largest self-contained block of flats in Europe\\". To an extent, their design has been a model for later municipal developments. History Grosvenor Road entrance to Dolphin Square Dolphin Square is on the site of the former works of the developer and builder Thomas Cubitt, who created the surrounding Pimlico district in the 19th century. An Army clothing factory was built on the site after Cubitt's death, and stood until 1933, when the leasehold on the site reverted to the Duke of Westminster. An American company, the Frederick French Corporation, bought the freehold for the site from the Duke, with plans to build a large residential development, Ormonde Court. The precarious financial situation of the Frederick French Corporation resulted in the sale of the site to Richard Rylands Costain (founder of the nascent Costain Group), who began to construct his own development in 1935. Lord Amulree formally opened the building on 25 November 1936. A. P. Herbert, writing in Dolphin Square (a promotional booklet produced for Costains in 1935, with illustrations by H. M. Bateman) described the Square as \\"a city of 1,250 flats, each enjoying at the same time most of the advantages of the separate house and the big communal dwelling place\\". The provision of a restaurant made him fear that \\"fortunate wives will not have enough to do. A little drudgery is good for wives, perhaps. The Dolphin lady may be spoiled\\". On purchasing the site, Costain remarked to a colleague: \\"in two or three years we'll either drive up to this spot in a Rolls-Royce, or we'll be standing here selling matches\\". In 1958, Costains sold Dolphin Square, as it was now known, for ¬£2.4 million to Sir Maxwell Joseph, who sold it to Lintang Investments in 1959 for ¬£3.1 million. Westminster City Council bought the lease of the block for ¬£4.5 million in the mid-1960s, and subsequently sub-let it to the Dolphin Square Trust, an effective housing association, which had been newly created for the purpose. In January 2006, the Trust and the Council sold Dolphin Square to the American Westbrook Holdings group for ¬£200 million. Accommodation is provided in 13 blocks (or \\"houses\\"), each named after a famous navigator or admiral. At the south (Thames) side of the Square the houses are Grenville, Drake, Raleigh and Hawkins. Moving from the river up the west side, there are Nelson, Howard, Beatty, and Duncan. A hotel and administration offices, on the north side of the Square, are in Dolphin House, previously known as Rodney. Heading south from the hotel there are Keyes, Hood, Collingwood and Frobisher. The estate contains a swimming pool, bar, brasserie (all of which were renovated in 2008), gymnasium, and shopping arcade. In the basement are a launderette and car park. A tennis court and croquet lawn overlook the River Thames. Until 21 January 1970, London Transport bus route 134 showed PIMLICO Dolphin Square as a destination and terminated in Chichester Street.  Architecture  Costains appointed the architect Gordon Jeeves to design Dolphin Square and he was assisted by Cecil Eve. Oscar Faber was the consultant engineer. Up to that point, Dolphin Square was Jeeves's largest project and he had played a part in designing other London buildings such as the National Radiator Building and later at Berkeley Square House. Dolphin Square is a neo-Georgian building and has a reinforced concrete structure with external facings of brick and stone. Original sound proofing was provided by compressed cork insulation in the floors. The original cost for the construction of Dolphin Square and its 1,310 flats was around ¬£2,000,000. In total, it was estimated that 200,000 tonnes of earth was moved, 125,000 tons of concrete used, 12 million bricks used on the external walls and 6,700 Crittal windows installed during construction. When it opened it had flats varying in size from one-bedroom suites to flats with five bedrooms, a maid's room and three bathrooms. Onsite facilities provided for residents when completed included shops, a children‚Äôs centre and nursery, library and, in the basement, a garage for up to 300 cars. The planned riverside wharf, which would have included a cafe, marina and a terraced garden leading from Grosvenor Road to the Thames, was never built. The 3.5 acres (1.4 ha) of communal gardens were designed by Richard Sudell, president of the Institute of Landscape Architects, and since 2018 are (unlike the building) Grade II listed. The gardens are a mix of formal and informal planting with expanses of lawn, with areas themed to reflect garden styles from different parts of the world. The gardens and buildings form part of the Dolphin Square conservation area. Residents Dolphin Square The proximity of Dolphin Square to the Palace of Westminster and the headquarters of the intelligence agencies MI5 (Thames House) and MI6 (Vauxhall Cross) has attracted many politicians, peers, civil servants and intelligence agency personnel as residents. Politicians who have lived in the development include Harold Wilson, David Steel, William Hague, Estelle Morris, Beverley Hughes, Michael Mates, John Langford-Holt and Iain Mills. (Mills died in his flat in the square's Duncan House.) Other notable residents have included comedians Ben Lyon and Bud Flanagan, actor Peter Finch, writer Radclyffe Hall, former Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard, journalist Norman Cliff, tennis writer Bud Collins, Anne, Princess Royal, and Profumo affair topless showgirls Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies. Australian tennis player Rod Laver stayed here for the 1969 Wimbledon championships during his Grand Slam season. ;Soviet spy arrest John Vassall, the Soviet spy, was arrested at apartment 807 in the square's Hood House in 1962. Oswald Mosley and his wife Diana Mitford, Lady Mosley, left their apartment at Dolphin Square for internment in 1940 during the Second World War. ;Wartime base for Free French Government Grenville House was the headquarters of General De Gaulle's Free French during World War II and number 308 Hood House was used by MI5 section B5(b) responsible for infiltrating agents into potentially subversive groups from 1924 to 1946. ;Allegations by John Mann of abuse in 1998 and 2014 and discredited allegation In November 2014, Labour MP John Mann told the Daily Mail that he handed evidence of \\"abuse parties\\" by prominent MPs at Dolphin Square to the police in 1998 but that the case was quickly shelved on the orders of \\"those at the top\\". The Metropolitan Police Service opened an inquiry the same month under Operation Fairbank into allegations that prominent MPs used the block of flats as a venue for child abuse. Carl Beech, then known publicly under the pseudonym \\"Nick\\", made false allegations against several prominent men, claiming that he was taken to Dolphin Square regularly as a young boy and abused. Exaro and the BBC News both carried interviews with Beech in which he lied about being abused at Dolphin Square. The force simultaneously launched a related murder inquiry under the name Operation Midland, in relation to Beech's claims that he saw an MP strangle a child to death. On 21 March 2016, the Metropolitan Police announced that this had been closed without any charges. That year it emerged that Beech's statements were fabrications, and the police's coverage was rebuked for being seen to legitimise the claims. In 2019, Beech was convicted of making up allegations of a VIP paedophile ring. In popular culture Scenes in the 1967 sci-fi horror The Sorcerers were filmed in and around Dolphin Square. British jazz baritone saxophonist Ronnie Ross released the jazz album Cleopatra's Needle (1968), containing its first track titled \\"Dolphin Square\\", which, according to the sleeve notes, was \\"dedicated to a party, at which Zoot Sims was present, once held in a flat there ('It must have been a good one, because I don't remember it')\\". In the video for Culture Club's 1982 UK number one single \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", scenes were filmed in the swimming pool inside the Dolphin Square complex. In British novelist Kate Atkinson's 2018 spy novel Transcription, MI5 runs a small counterespionage operation from Nelson House in Dolphin Square.

Biography  Brooks was born in Rome, New York. He attended college at the University of Rochester and subsequently studied homeopathic medicine in New York City. He dropped out after two years, however, and returned to Rochester where he married Anne Shepard in 1909. He found employment with an advertising agency in Utica, and then \\"retired\\" in 1911, evidently because he came into a considerable inheritance. His retirement was not permanent; in 1917, he went to work for the American Red Cross and he later did editorial work for several magazines, including \\"a nonfiction stint with The New Yorker 1932‚Äì1933\\". In 1940, he turned to writing for his full-time occupation. He married Dorothy Collins following the death of Anne in 1952. The first works that Brooks published were poems and short stories. Among these were a series of short stories featuring \\"a talking horse and his drunken owner\\" which was the basis for the 1960s television comedy series Mister Ed. His most enduring works, however, are the 26 books that he wrote about Freddy the Pig and his friends. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas praised Freddy and the Spaceship because it \\"offers wit, sound structural plotting, genuine character-humor, and admirable English prose\\".\\"Recommended Reading\\", The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, January 1954, p. 95. Brooks died of a heart attack at his home in Roxbury, New York at age 72. He is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in Hamilton, New York. In 2009, Overlook Press published Talking Animals and Others: The Life and Work of Walter R. Brooks, Creator of Freddy the Pig by Michael Cart . Mister Ed stories The first story that he published featuring the character Mister Ed was ‚ÄúThe Talking Horse‚Äù, featured in Liberty magazine for September 18, 1937, which contained two illustrations by Tony Sarge. The last in the series was ‚ÄúWith Teeth and Tail‚Äù, which appeared in the August 1945 issue of Argosy magazine. The short story ‚ÄúEd Signs the Pledge‚Äù in Argosy, June 1944, was reportedly the story that Arthur Lubin used to sell the concept for the Mister Ed comedy series to TV executives. The series was produced by Filmways and was syndicated initially. It was picked up by CBS in 1961 and ran on the network until 1966. In January 1963, Bantam in New York City published a paperback collection of the Mister Ed stories entitled The Original Mr. Ed which featured illustrations by Bob Bugg.Patten, Fred.
