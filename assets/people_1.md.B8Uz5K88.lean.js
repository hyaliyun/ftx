He was a major figure during the Urabi revolt with many considering him the voice of the revolution. Al-Nadeem was brought up in Alexandria. Poverty played an important role in his life, as he did not receive a formal education and came from the poor districts of Egypt at a time of financial and economic crisis.Malaṭāwī, Ḥasan. al-Hụrrīyah Wa-Al-ʻadālah Fī Fikr ʻAbd Allāh Al-Nadīm. al-Qāhirah: al-ʻArabī, 1981 Corruption in the state, foreign intervention, and exploitation in political power were main aspects of al-Nadeem's political writings and speeches. He sought to overthrow the government that depended on foreigners and advocated for protecting the nation. His nationalists ideologies and political activism was greatly influenced by Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and Muhammed Abduh. Al-Nadeem considers himself a self-taught scholar as he mentioned in his book “Kan wa yakoon”; (Was and Is being).  Early life  Abdullah al-Nadeem (born Abdullah Bin Mesbah) was born in Alexandria in 1843 to a poor Egyptian family. His father Mesbah Bin Ibrahim el-Hosni was a baker. Al-Nadeem grew up in a poor neighbourhood in Alexandria called El-Gomrok district, which is close to the main port of Alexandria. His Father sent him to the district's “kottab” which was a simple form of schooling at that period of time. He learned how to read and write and was able to learn the Qur’an by heart when he was only nine years old. In 1855, when he was a bit older the poor conditions of his family deprived him from studying at Al-Azhar so his father sent him to “El Noor” mosque which was close to his home. He excelled at Islamic jurisprudence, logic, religious studies, and Arabic grammar. He studied under the like of Ibrahim El Sersi, Ibrahim El Shaf’ai, and Mohammed Al-‘Ashry. However, al-Nadeem was not thrilled by the education he was receiving at the mosque and decided to drop out. Instead, he decided to roam the streets and towns in Alexandria in search for intellectual seminars, poetry recitals, and lectures at local cafes and ventures. During this time he excelled in writing and speech. He became famous for his style and was considered a local celebrity in Alexandria. When word reached his father, he refused to support him financially unless he returned to the mosque. Nadim decided to leave Alexandria and headed south. When he was 17, al-Nadeem learned the telegraph and got a job as an operator in Banha and was later transferred to Qasar al-Ali in Cairo, which was the residential palace of Hoshiyar Hanim, mother of the Khedive Ismail. = Before political activism = Al-Nadeem settled in Cairo for a while. He attended many seminars of literature, poetry, and culture. He befriended Al-Azhar writers and scholars along with well-known figures such as Mahmoud Sami el-Baroudi (who later on became the 5th prime minister of Egypt), Abdullah Fekry Pasha, Sheikh Abou Al- Nasr, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Rizkani, Mohammed Said Bey, and Mahmoud Safwat. Through their company al-Nadeem was exposed to Al-Azhar education and thought. At the same time Jamal al Din al-Afghani came to Cairo and began to lecture about the reformation of Islam. When he heard about him, he attended his lectures and was deeply impacted by his bold ideas. He became a recurring member of al- Afghani's councils and engaged in his seminars and learned from him reformation of religion, freedom of research, criticism and boldness in defending the right. Al Afghani was quick to recognise al-Nadeem's capabilities so he began to privately tutor him, which influenced al-Nadeem's political and nationalist ideologies greatly. His recurrent visits to al- Afghani led to his termination from his job at the palace. Once again he was on the road. He resided at Mansoura where he found residence at the “Omada” of a small village and took a job as a private tutor for the Omda's children teaching them writing, reading, and religious studies. At that time he managed to learn more about the peasants living in Mansoura and the poor conditions that they suffered from. He didn't last long at this job, which led to his departure from Mansoura. When he finally found a job again as a government employee he head back to Cairo where he was reunited with al-Afghani who began to take a more nationalist approach in his teachings and lessons. And since then al-Nadeem's political life began.  Background  During the period of Khedive Ismail Egypt was on the verge of modernisation and connections with Europe increased specifically after the opening of the Suez Canal. Many Europeans came to Egypt to take advantage of the problematic fiscal situation that emerged during that time hoping to make huge fortunes from loaning the government money. Foreigners began to take part in the cultural and economic life in Egypt. At the same time, the prominent Islamic ideologist and political activists Jamal al-Din al-Afghani came to Egypt. His teachings included religious reform and opposing foreign intervention promoting nationalists ideologies. Concurrently, reform and nationalist ideologies were spreading in many parts in Egypt. Al-Afghani had a major impact on nationalists and helped spread national political thought along with religious reformation. The spread of national ideologies and religious reform played an important role in the emergence of political newspapers. Many newspapers emerged during that period due to al-Afghani's advocacy. Yaqub Sanu founded the satirical newspaper “Abu Naddara Zarqqa”. It is considered the first satirical political newspaper that appeared in Egypt. Sanu's use of colloquial language and cartoons made it very popular in Egyptian culture. Using this newspaper, Sanu criticized the Khedive's policies and his entourage. He also criticized the government and the people for not calling for their rights. His emerging popularity irritated the Khedive who recognized the danger of Sanu and confiscated the newspaper and banished him. Sanu resided in Paris and managed to publish his newspaper and send many copies to Egypt. In that period from 1876 – 1879, al-Afghani supported the emergence of more newspapers and journalists such as Mekhail Abdel Sayyid who founded the “Watan” (nation) newspaper, Adeeb Isaiah the founder of “Misr” (Egypt) newspaper, also Selim Al Naqqash who founded the newspaper “Al Tejara” (commerce), brothers Selim and Beshara Tuqla who founded “Al-Ahram”, and Selim Anhory “Mira’at Al Shark” (mirror of the East). More newspapers appeared such as “Al Mahrousa”, “Al Asr Al Jadeed”. These newspapers arose from popular culture using language and anecdotes that Egyptians were able to relate to. They called for reform of government, and also opposed foreign intervention not just in politics but also social life. Journalists wrote from the empowerment of al-Afghani. The situation in Egypt was unstable due financial problems because the Khedive's expenditures that were on efforts to modernize Egypt in a European way. Money was spent on projects, luxury goods, and tributes to the Ottoman Sultan. More money was spent on the Suez Canal project and opening. The end of the American Civil War attributed to the decrease in cotton prices, which was Egypt's major revenue.  Political life  Al-Nadeem returned to Alexandria, which was full of nationalists associations and Arabic newspapers. He wrote in the newspapers \\"Misr\\" Egypt and \\"Al-Tejara\\" Commerce many articles in the voice and principles of Al-Afghani. Al-Nadeem began to search for more political involvement so he searched for secret political movements in Alexandria, and in 1879 he joined the movement “Misr Al- Fatah”. It was a political organization working in secret and planning to overthrow the Khedive Ismail. They handed out political publications spreading nationalist ideologies and thought. They also wrote about the critical economic and political situation that was the result of the corrupt Khedive. Due to the secrecy, the organization's capabilities were limited and ineffective, but al-Nadeem was able to learn more about the discourse of patriotism and began to mingle more with people on the streets teaching and spreading nationalists’ and patriotic ideologies and lecturing people about the importance of democracy and a constitution. During that time, al-Nadeem founded his first newspaper \\"Al- Tankeet w Al-Tabkeet\\", which was a weekly newspaper with satirical content projecting hidden political messages. He then replaced it with \\"al-Tayef\\" (الطائف) newspaper which was more serious paper with a nationalist tone. On 26 June 1979, the European governments were able to pressure and convince the Ottoman Sultan Abdel Hamid II to depose Ismail Pasha and appoint his son Tewfik Pasha instead with Riyad Pasha serving as prime minister. Many were optimistic with this decision including al-Nadeem, the military officers, and al-Afghani. Tewfik Pasha was one of many students of al-Afghani and had many times attended seminars and lectures with national figures and writers including al-Nadeem. Tewfik's era did not improve Egypt's situation. On the contrary, there was more British and French intervention in domestic affairs. = Urabi Revolt = Military officers under the leadership of Ahmed Urabi began to form secret movements spreading awareness of the foreign intervention in Egyptian affairs. They persuaded al-Nadeem to join them. Al-Nadeem found that the officers were targeting reformation and independency from foreign influence. He participated with his writings and speeches. With his style and articulation, al-Nadeem was able to summon people to the Urabi movement and he spoke of the importance of political activism and social reformation. Urabi appointed al-Nadeem as his personal advisor and through his writings and speeches, al-Nadeem enforced many people to join the military movement. In 1879 they formed the Egyptian Nationalist Party in the hopes of fostering a stronger national identity. After years of discrimination, the military officers under the leadership of Urabi sent a petition to Riyad Pasha in January 1881. It was a demand to depose all discriminatory acts against Egyptians. Urabi asked al-Nadeem to write a charter to the Egyptian people requesting authorization to represent them. The movement had two public demands; the deposition of Riyad Pasha's government, and the formation of a council of representatives. Al-Nadeem was a major component of a demonstration led by Urabi consisting of military officers and Egyptian civilians that headed to Abdeen Palace where the Khedive resided. The demands were met and Riyad's government was dissolved. Mohamed Sherif Pasha was appointed as prime minister and head of government. He saw great danger from al-Nadeem and his writings as someone who was able to shape public opinion and sway people to the officers’ movement. Al-Nadeem mentioned in an article entitled “Bashing idiots” that it was the time in which laws protected citizens from the oppressors. Al-Nadeem kept writing about nationalism and the role of a nation in his articles. He supported the development of political associations specifically in Alexandria. However, his paper \\"al-Tayef\\" had become very popular and according to Ahmed Samir who was one of his students and who wrote a biography of al-Nadeem, the newspaper was used by the military officers to spread their political movement and ideologies without the al-Nadeem's consent; something that al-Nadeem was not very fond of. = British Occupation = The British were especially concerned that Urabi would default on Egypt's massive debt and that he might try to regain control of the Suez Canal. So they placed their warships on the shore of Alexandria. Meanwhile, Tewfik fled to their protection, moving his court to Alexandria. The strong naval presence spurred fears of an imminent invasion. The French fleet was recalled to France. The British warships in the harbor opened fire on the city's gun emplacements after the Egyptians ignored an ultimatum from Admiral Seymour to remove them. In September 1882 the British army headed by Sir Archibald Alison landed in Alexandria were met by Egyptian forces headed by Urabi at the Battle of Kafr El Dawwar. Another army, led by Sir Garnet Wolseley, landed in the Canal Zone and on 13 September 1882 they defeated Urabi's army at the Battle of Tell El Kebir. From there, the British cavalry advanced on Cairo which surrendered without a shot being fired and the British occupation would start in Egypt.  Later life  According to Samir al-Nadeem was with Urabi at the Battle of Tell El Kebir, and he returned with Urabi to Cairo after the defeat where Samir met him at Urabi's house. Al-Nadeem sneaked out during the night and left for Kafr Al-Dawar with his father. Urabi had considered to go Alexandria and surrender to Tewfik Pasha in hope for pardon. Samir says in his biography that it was the last time he saw al-Nadeem for ten years. Al-Nadeem disappeared growing his beard and wearing large turbans so that no one could recognize him. He was finally arrested in a small town called \\"Meet al- Gharqa\\". = Al-Nadeem during the British occupation = Al Nadeem was exiled to Jaffa for the first time in September 1891, although he did roam in many cities in this region including Nablus and Qalqilya. He remained in between these cities till the Khedive died in January 1982. After Tewfik Pasha died his son Abbas II Helmy Bey assumed the throne and he allowed al-Nadeem to return to Egypt. Abbas II was supportive of Egyptian nationalists and al- Nadeem resumed his active role as a nationalist writer and founded the newspaper \\"al-Ostaz\\" (الأستاذ) the Professor in May 1893. Through his articles and writings in \\"al-Ostaz\\" he criticized the British occupation and the idea of colonization. He specifically attacked many Egyptians who aided the British as he wrote a piece in \\"al-Ostaz\\" saying \\"I am your brother, why do you deny it?\\". He criticized their role in helping the British and the Europeans \\"who are tearing the East apart watching us burn like the lodges\\".Nadīim, ʻAbd Allāh. Hadhihi maqalāt ʻAbd Allāh Al-Nadīm. This piece which was published in \\"al-Ostaz\\" infuriated Lord Cormer himself who demanded from the Khedive to exile al-Nadeem again. And through the British pressure, al-Nadeem's paper was dissolved and he was exiled for the second time to Jaffa.Jumayʻī, ʻAbd al- Munʻim Ibrāhīm al-Dusūqī. ʻAbd Allāh Al-Nadīm Wa-Dawruhu Fī Al-hạrakah Al- siyāsīyah Wa-Al-ijtimāʻīyah. al-Tạbʻah 1. ed. al-Qāhirah: Dār al-kitāb al- jāmiʻī, 1980 However, after returning to Alexandria for a short while he was summoned to the Sultan's court and remained there working at the information Bureau. = Al-Nadeem's political thought and legacy = Al-Nadeem was a nationalist by heart. He was inspired by Al-Afghani's reformation ideologies and relied on journalism and speech to deliver his thoughts and opinions. His student Ahmed Samir and writers who have mentioned him have all claimed that his vocal abilities and linguistic capacities were immense.سيرة عبدالله النديم بقلم تلميذه أحمد سمير بنصها المنشور في سلافة النديم، ١٨٩٧ He was able to gather people and criticize them while they were standing listening to him very attentively. His publications and writing styles were popular. He was still effective and inspiring after he disappeared ten years and returned from exile when he founded his final newspaper. Many state that Ahmed Urabi himself was impacted by al-Nadeem's nationalist views and ideologies. He believed in economic and religious reforms. He was a strong opposer to foreign intervention and colonization believing that the Arabs should not be subject to foreign rule.  Death  Al-Nadeem died in October 1896 at the age of 54. He was given an official funeral by the Sultan and many figures attended most prominently al-Afghani and Sheikh Mohammed al-Zafer. He was buried in Yehia Affandi cemetery in Beşiktaş in what is today Istanbul.Malaṭāwī, Ḥasan. al- Hụrrīyah Wa-Al-ʻadālah Fī Fikr ʻAbd Allāh Al-Nadīm. al-Qāhirah: al-ʻArabī, 1981.

Four days later, UFC president Dana White announced via a letter to employees shared to the public that this event \\"is still scheduled as planned, but the location may change\\". On March 18, the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC) announced that the event would not be sanctioned to take place at the event's original site, the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. On March 23, White revealed that he already had a new location for this event, but would only confirm that it will be held behind closed doors. White subsequently added on March 25 that the card could feature a different lineup, depending on the logistics. Khabib Nurmagomedov stated on March 30 that he was in Dagestan and his participation at the event could be jeopardized due to travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It is equivalent to a broad circumscription of the genus Lycopodiella in other classifications. Like all lycophytes, members of the Lycopodielloideae are vascular plants that reproduce by spores. Description The sporophytes of Lycopodielloideae species are relatively short herbaceous plants. They have stems with pseudomonopodial branching in which unequal binary branching produces the appearance of a main stem with secondary side branches. The main stems are indeterminate and of various forms, including rhizomatous, creeping and upright. The branches are usually determinate (i.e. of limited growth and extension). Sporangia are borne at the bases or in the axils of special spore- bearing leaves (sporophylls), which are notably different from the normal leaves, and are grouped into compact terminal structures (strobili). The strobili may be either upright or drooping. Taxonomy The family Lycopodiaceae was first established in 1802. Although other genera now placed within the family (in particular Huperzia, published in 1801) had been described, until the mid-1900s, Lycopodium was often the only genus recognized. Work by Josef Holub and Benjamin Øllgaard in the 1980s established three clear divisions within the family. This has since been supported by molecular phylogenetic studies. Several different ways of representing this situation taxonomically have been used, and are still in use , including three subfamilies with multiple genera, and three genera with multiple subgeneric divisions. Three subfamilies, including Lycopodielloideae, were first suggested by Warren Wagner, Jr. and Joseph Beitel in 1992, but were not validly published under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature as it was then. The names were validated by Benjamin Øllgaard in 2015. The entire subfamily Lycopodielloideae in the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I) corresponds to the single genus Lycopodiella in other classifications. =Phylogeny= Within the family Lycopodiaceae, there is support for three subgroups. In 2016, Field et al. proposed that the primary division is between Lycopodielloideae plus Lycopodioideae (which comprised their Lycopodioideae) and Huperzioideae (subfamilies sensu PPG I). Field et al. (2016) included eight species of Lycopodielloideae in their analysis, which suggested the relationships among the genera shown in the following cladogram, where the number of species included in the study is shown in parentheses: =Genera= In the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I), the Lycopodielloideae comprises the following genera: *Lateristachys Holub *Lycopodiella Holub *Palhinhaea Franco & Vasc. *Pseudolycopodiella Holub All of these genera are submerged into a single genus Lycopodiella sensu lato in other systems of classification.

Hogenhout FRES (born 1969), is an Dutch professor of entomology and ecology specialising in molecular plant, microbe and insect interactions.  Education and career  Hogenhout was educated at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam with an MSc in Biology in 1994, her PhD looked at the molecular basis of luteovirus-aphid interactions and was awarded at Wageningen University in 1999. She moved to Ohio State University to be assistant and then associate professor and since 2007 has been Group Leader in plant health at the John Innes Centre in Norwich. In 2013, she was appointed honorary professor at the University of East Anglia, and in 2018, she was made professor by special appointment at the University of Amsterdam.  Research  Hogenhout's research looks at the interactions between insects and plants and how microorganisms can manipulate this. Her group discovered the key virulence protein SAP54 which phytoplasma bacteria use to manipulate the flowering of plants, the bacteria is carried between plants by plant feeding insects such as leafhoppers. Her work looks at other insects that transmit plant diseases such as the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae, this aphid can carry many different plant viruses and feeds on a wide range of plants and can manipulate plants to benefit the aphids by producing virulence proteins. Her group have sequenced the genome of the peach potato aphid and were surprised to find that it was smaller than the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, a species with many fewer host plants. Hogenhout found that the aphid can adapt the virulence proteins it produces in response to the plant species it is feeding on; and as it can reproduce asexually, producing a clone of genetically identical offspring, local populations of aphids can adapt quickly to their environment. Hogenhout's research has also looked at the responses of plants to insect feeding, she showed that plants take in calcium to damaged plant cells in the site where aphid feeding stylets penetrate, the cells would then mobilise further calcium in response to this alarm. Hogenhout is leading a major UK consortium project BRIGIT carrying out research into transmission of the bacterial pathogen Xylella fastidiosa, which has caused widespread plant disease in Southern Europe. The research will find out more information about the disease such as symptoms and epidemiology, and look into how the disease may be transmitted by insects such as leafhoppers and the transport of commercial plants by humans.

Corellon is also considered a member of the default D&D; pantheon. Corellon is the creator and preserver of the elven race, and governs those things held in the highest esteem among elves. Corellon's symbol was originally a crescent moon; in the 4th edition Corellon's symbol is a silver star on a blue field. The 5th edition Player's Handbook describes Corellon as \\"androgynous\\" and Deities and Demigods (1980) explains that Corellon is \\"alternatively male or female, both or neither.\\" The 2018 rule book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes introduced the \\"blessed of Corellon\\" characteristic which allows player character elves to change their sex any time they take a \\"long rest\\" (a mechanic which is at least eight hours of in- game rest). This ability for players and 5th edition's affirmation that \\"you don't need to be confined to binary notions and gender,\\" make Corellon an important fictional character for LGBTQ inclusivity.

Corellon is also the seasonal god of spring and the patron god of the eladrin.Heinsoo, Rob, Andy Collins, and James Wyatt. Player's Handbook. (Wizards of the Coast, 2008) Corellon also appears in the Forgotten Realms Campaign Guide and Forgotten Realms Player's Guide as one of the Greater Deities of the Realms. This version of Corellon is Good (as opposed to Unaligned), and is more similar to earlier portrayals of the god. Corellon's consort is Angharradh, as the Faerunian version of Sehanine is revealed to be an aspect of Selûne. =Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition (2014–)= The \\"blessed of Corellon\\" mechanic was introduced in 5th edition in Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes (2018).  Fictional description  =Relationships= In many campaign settings, the elven pantheon of gods (also known as the Seldarine) consists of the leader Corellon Larethian, as well as Aerdrie Faenya, Deep Sashelas, Erevan Ilesere, Fenmarel Mestarine, Hanali Celanil, Labelas Enoreth, Rillifane Rallathil, Sehanine Moonbow, and Solonor Thelandira. Other elven gods may be present in different campaign settings. Corellon is considered to be foremost among the Seldarine. Corellon's consort is Sehanine Moonbow. Some myths claim that Corellon gave birth to the rest of the elven pantheon while in a female aspect, while others claim that Corellon fathered them with Sehanine Moonbow. Corellon raised Ye'Cind to the status of demigod by infusing him with a spark of Corellon's own power. Gruumsh One-Eye, god of the orcs, is the god's greatest enemy, because Corellon took his eye in an ancient battle. The entire orc pantheon hates Corellon intensely. Corellon also opposes the deities of the goblinoids. Corellon was also the one to banish the drow goddess Lolth (Araushnee in the Forgotten Realms setting) to the Abyss. For this, Corellon can count all evil drow gods as enemies. Because of the god's keen friendship with the Seelie Court, Corellon is often at odds with the Queen of Air and Darkness. Corellon's truest friends are the rulers of the other demihuman pantheons: Moradin, Yondalla, and Garl Glittergold. Together, they work to ensure that the gods of the human and monstrous pantheons don't grow strong too quickly. Corellon is also allied with Cyrrollalee, Ehlonna, Emmantiensien, Oberon, Pelor, Skerrit, and Titania. Corellon is also on good terms with Vanathor, Bahamut's gold dragon advisor and bard. In the Forgotten Realms, Corellon has most often been at odds with Cyric, Talos, Malar, and Moander. With the 2004 publication of \\"The Complete Divine\\", Corellon Larethian added the domain of \\"Community\\" to his existing domains of Good, War, Protection and Chaos. In 4th edition, Corellon is one of the \\"Four Free Gods\\", along with a spouse Sehanine, Avandra and Melora. Corellon is on good terms with Ioun (Corellon is patron of arcane magic and she of its study), and is therefore a potential foe of Vecna. Corellon maintains cordial relationships with the other seasonal gods, Pelor and the Raven Queen. Corellon's most hated enemies, of course, are Gruumsh and Lolth. =Realm= Corellon lives in the realm of Arvandor on the plane of Arborea. Also called Arvanaith in its role as the elven afterlife, Arvandor is said to have been taken from the gods of the giants after a lengthy war. Ruins of giant citadels still dot the land there. The elven gods are thought to have invaded from the plane of Ysgard, hungry for a realm of their own. The realm is a place of deep forests and fey beauty. Corellon dwells in a magnificent tower of marble in the center of the realm. In Elven, it is called Gwyllachaightaeryll, the Many-Splendored. The art that decorates the tower's many rooms is constantly changing. Only the central throne room is a constant. =Dogma= Corellon desires to protect and preserve the elven race, return to the elven people their lost artistic heritage, and to thwart the schemes of the drow and the orcs. This also means guarding against the corruption within that resulted in the creation of the drow. Corellon advises his faithful to guard against stagnation as well, continually seeking out new experiences. They seek to bring out beauty through art, craft, and magic. Corellon is surprisingly humble, for a regent of his stature. =Worshippers= Elves, and half-elves (as well as many bards) worship Corellon. Corellon favors those who kill orcs and the followers of Lolth. Corellon blesses those who aid others and is upset at those who defile the dead, or flee from their foes. Clergy Corellon's clerics wear silver circlets and gossamer robes of the brightest azure. They often wear blue cloaks. Corellon's favored weapon is the longsword. Fellowship of the Forgotten Flower The Fellowship of the Forgotten Flower is a loosely structured organization made of elven knights dedicated to the recovery of lost elven relics from long-abandoned elven realms. Members must be elven warriors or elven paladins. Seekers of the Misty Isle The Seekers of the Misty Isle are an elite order of elves dedicated to finding the Misty Isle which was whisked away by the deities Gruumsh and Kurtulmak. =Temples= In large elven cities such as Enstad, temples to Corellon Larethian may be alabaster wonders with soaring spires. In smaller communities, they may be built among the branches of a large tree such as an ipp. Most temples are happy to lend aid to traveling elves and any other race that plans to do harm to the drow. =Holy Days= Most of Corellon's holy days are tied to celestial events and occur only once every few years or decades. Once per month, when Luna is at its quarter phase, followers of Corellon gather in moonlit glades for a ceremony known as Lateu'quor, the Forest Communion of the Crescent Moon. There, they praise their Creator through song and dance and offerings of beautiful art. The art is not destroyed; sometimes it is physically transferred to the Upper Planes for elves to enjoy in the afterlife, while other times it is used to decorate Corellon's temples. Sometimes the very landscape of the glade is reshaped into a work of art. Once per year, on the fourth of Richfest, the holiday of Agelong is celebrated. Elves hunt for orcs to slay in memory of Corellon's battle against the god of the orcs, Gruumsh. =Rituals= Corellon Larethian is worshipped at natural geological formations. Corellon's rituals are integrated with the major events of elven life, such as births, coming of age rites, weddings, and funerals. Prayers to Corellon, which are always in Elvish, begin \\"Hei-Corellon shar- shelevu,\\" which means, \\"Corellon, by your grace grant...\\" Before battle, worshippers of Corellon recite a prayer called the Litany of Arrows. =Campaign settings=  Greyhawk  Corellon appears in first edition AD&D; Deities and Demigods. As such, the god is considered a \\"default\\" deity for the realm of Oerth. Forgotten Realms Following the War of the Spider Queen series, Lisa Smedman's The Lady Penitent trilogy continues the story of drow in the Forgotten Realms. In book 1, Sacrifice of the Widow, Eilistraee slays Vhaeraun and acquires Corellon's portfolio and thus many of the god's priests. Cavatina Xarann, a Darksong Knight, recovers the Crescent Blade and uses it to slay Selvetarm, Lolth's champion. In book 2, Storm of the Dead, Vhaeraun's clergy have been warily accepted into Eilistraee's faith, and the goddess now is known as the Masked Lady. A small faction of Vhaeraun's remaining clerics believe that, instead, Vhaeraun slew Eilistraee and is masquerading as her. A mixed force of Eilistraee's Protectors, Nightshadows and drow wizards go on a raid on the main temple of Kiaransalee, the drow death goddess. High magic is used to erase Kiaransalee's name from memory, causing the goddess' death from lack of worship. Qilué, uncharacteristically, orders the slaughter of the helpless former cultists of Kiaransalee. In book 3, Ascendancy of the Last, the Promenade is beset by the cultists and oozes of Ghaunadaur. The attackers have been baited by uncontented Nightshadows and the Balor, Wendonai, acting through the Crescent Blade and Qilué. In the ensuing battle the Promenade and the followers of Eilistraee are almost annihilated and Ghaunadaur's followers are rendered feebleminded. Qilué and Eilistraee try to save entire drow race from Wendonai's taint, but Qilué is killed by Halisstra Melarn while Eilistraee is possessing her body (supposedly killing the goddess as well), dooming their attempt to failure. Meanwhile, Q'arlynd Melarn succeeds in re-transforming the descendants of Miyeritar and followers of Eilistraee from drow to dark elves, whereafter Corellon Larethian takes this new elven subrace under his protection. During the event known as The Sundering, Eilistraee manages to return to life alongside her brother Vhaeraun, and is one of the deities with whom Mystra is currently sharing the Weave. Eilistraee has directly manifested to her followers through her avatar, and the dark elves whom her father protected during her absence have returned under her protection.Kim Mohan ed. (2015) Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide. (Wizards of the Coast) pp 23, 108 Reception James Vincent of The Independent identified Corellon as an example of D&D;'s embracing of LGBT characters, as the god is \\"often seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic,\\" and some elves are made in the god's image. As one study of gaming notes, Corellon's cosmogony represents a design decision that \\"Dungeons & Dragons is now explicitly welcoming towards queer play.\\" One veteran player and LGBTQ parenting author explained Correlon's significance in terms of representation: \\"D&D; has long attracted LGBTQ players, among others, as these examples of gay and transgender players (and my own experiences) show. Many of us have been bending our characters’ genders and sexual orientations for years, but it’s terrific to see the game officially embrace this. Kudos to the makers of D&D;, Wizards of the Coast.\\" Geek and Sundry notes that Correlon's significance is that gender and sex fluidity is \\"built into the lore\\" of the game. However, some critics of Baldur’s Gate: Siege of Dragonspear criticized the game for \\"LGBT tokenism\\" because it included 5th edition cosmogony and transgender characters.

The centre is located in the coastal village of Laulasmaa in Lääne-Harju Parish, Estonia, about to the west from Tallinn. It was established in 2010 by the Pärt family. In October 2018 the new building of the centre, designed by Spanish architects Fuensanta Nieto and Enrique Sobejano from the architecture and design firm Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos, was opened to the public.  History  = Founding and early years = The idea to create a separate institution for the personal archive of Arvo Pärt arose from the need to ensure the composer permanent access to his collections and at the same time to prepare these collections for long- term preservation and for public research. The centre was established by Arvo Pärt and his family in 2010 when the composer had returned to Estonia after living in Germany since 1981. It was originally named the International Arvo Pärt Centre (), with 'international' dropped from the name in 2014. The Arvo Pärt Centre was founded in the village of Laulasmaa because at his return to Estonia Arvo Pärt had chosen this coastal location as his permanent place of residence. In 2009 a residential building was bought to house the archive and to serve as a future location of the centre. The house was later named Aliina after Arvo Pärt's first piece in tintinnabuli-technique, Für Alina (1976). For the first eight years the main tasks of the centre were organising the archive, creating metadata and a digital information retrieval system. Due to the preparatory stages of work and general lack of space the centre was in most part closed to the public until late 2018. = New building = To create facilities for research and educational programmes and to develop the centre into a meeting place for music lovers with a proper concert hall, an international two-stage architectural competition was announced in 2013. Altogether 71 designs from 24 countries were submitted. A Spanish architecture and design firm Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos (led by Fuensanta Nieto and Enrique Sobejano) was declared the winner of the competition on 20 June 2014 by the President of Estonia Toomas Hendrik Ilves. The preparations for the construction of the new building started in March 2017. The cost of the construction works, funded by the Estonian government, was 6.7 million Euros. The work was carried out by construction company Ehitustrust. The cornerstone was laid on 19 June 2017 at a festive ceremony attended among others by Arvo Pärt, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas and Minister of Culture Indrek Saar. The construction was finished in mid-2018. The inauguration ceremony took place on 13 October 2018 in the form of three concerts by invitation. The guests were greeted by Arvo Pärt, Chairman of the Board Michael Pärt, Managing Director Anu Kivilo, and architects Fuensanta Nieto and Enrique Sobejano. The main guests speaking at the event were President of Estonia Kersti Kaljulaid, Vice- President of the European Commission Andrus Ansip and Minister of Culture Indrek Saar. Arvo Pärt's new choral work And I Heard a Voice... had its Estonian premiere. Some parts of the inauguration ceremony were broadcast live by public broadcasting channels Eesti Televisioon and Klassikaraadio. The first public concert in the centre took place the following day, 14 October 2018, with American violinist Anne Akiko Meyers accompanied on a piano by Akira Eguchi. = Access = The Arvo Pärt Centre opened its doors to the public on 17 October 2018. The aim has been that the Centre should be open to anyone interested in Arvo Pärt’s music and world of ideas. The Arvo Pärt Centre provides guided tours introducing the life and work of Arvo Pärt. There are also educational programmes available both for children and adults. The centre also organises lectures and seminars on various topics related to Arvo Pärt's music and worldview. Various research activities and conferences are organised in collaboration with other institutions of research and higher education. In 2020 the centre closed to the public in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In April 2020, after receiving an award from the BBVA Foundation, Pärt gave an interview to the Spanish newspaper ABC concerning the coronavirus crisis. He was quoted as saying that nobody knows how we will emerge from this, but we feel that nothing will be the same (\\"Nadie sabe cómo saldremos de esto, pero todos sentimos que nada permanecerá como estaba\\"). The centre reopened in May 2020.  Functions  = Archive, library, information centre = At the core of the Arvo Pärt Centre are the personal archive and the personal library of the composer. The majority of the archival materials are original documents from the composer’s family – handwritten documents related to his creative work date back to 1970s. Many earlier documents from 1950s to 1970s are currently located at other memory institutions of Estonia or in private hands but the Arvo Pärt Centre has either paper or digital copies of most of them. The most valuable items in the archive are Arvo Pärt's handwritten scores, sketches, schemes, and music diaries. Researchers can view lists of the archive content on the centre's web site but even digital materials are accessible only on location. The library contains more than 2,000 books from the personal collection of Arvo Pärt and his wife Nora. The composer's personal collection has two focuses – music and theology. The majority of books in the collection are on Orthodox theology and spirituality, which has been an important source of inspiration for Arvo Pärt. The library also collects and stores CDs with Arvo Pärt's music, printed scores of his works, and books about his life and music. Based on the personal collections in the centre and on close collaboration with the composer and his family the centre also operates as an international information centre on Arvo Pärt, making available the most authoritative and up-to-date information on his life and works. = Music and films = The new building of the Arvo Pärt Centre houses also a concert hall with 150 seats, ideal for chamber music concerts. The centre organises its own concerts as well as offers performing space for musicians not invited by the centre. The focus of the concert programme is on introducing musicians from Estonia and abroad who have had a close collaboration with Arvo Pärt over the years. In the first two seasons there have been concerts by violinist Anne Akiko Meyers, countertenor David James from the Hilliard Ensemble, the Estonian Philharmonic Chamber Choir, the Tallinn Chamber Orchestra, early music ensemble Hortus Musicus, vocal ensemble Vox Clamantis, and many others. Every August since 2011 the Arvo Pärt Centre has organised film evenings with a selection of films featuring Arvo Pärt's music. The activity has been conducted in collaboration with cinema Sõprus in Tallinn, however, after the opening of the new building in 2018 some screenings have been also organised at the premises of the centre. = Publishing = Since 2014 the Arvo Pärt Centre has also published a number of books about Arvo Pärt's life and music, as well as an edition of his songs for children: * 2014 – In Principio : The Word in Arvo Pärt's Music. . * 2015 – Lapsepõlve lood. Songs from Childhood. (CD and sheet music). . * 2017 – Leopold Brauneiss. Arvo Pärdi tintinnabuli-stiil : arhetüübid ja geomeetria. . * 2018 – Joonas Sildre. Kahe heli vahel : graafiline romaan Arvo Pärdist. .  Architecture  The Arvo Pärt Centre is also known for its modern building, completed in 2018. The architects themselves have described their design as \\"searching a balance between the intimacy of the Estonian artist’s compositions and the serene beauty of the landscape\\". The design responds to the natural setting in a pine forest with a structure which is lower than the tree canopy apart from an observation tower. The helical tower provides a view of the Baltic Sea. The building makes use of various geometrical (mostly pentagonal) structures and shapes, and largely due to the sinuous curved walls forms a continuity without a clear beginning or end. The extensive use of glass walls brings together the oak-panelled interior and the exterior dominated by its forest setting. The centre has another unusual architectural element apart from the tower, a small Orthodox chapel in one of the patios. = Nominations and awards = * Construction Project of the Year 2018 (by the Estonian Association of Architectural and Consulting Engineering Companies and the Estonian Association of Civil Engineers) * Shortlisted for the Mies van der Rohe Award 2019 * Architecture Endowment 2019 (by the Cultural Endowment of Estonia) * Nominated to the 2019 Annual Award of the Estonian Association of Architects * Nominated to the 2019 Annual Award of the Estonian Association of Interior Architects  References   External links  * Arvo Pärt Centre (in Estonian and English) Music organizations based in Estonia Archives in Estonia Buildings by Nieto Sobejano Arquitectos Music archives Libraries in Estonia Concert halls in Estonia Towers in Estonia Lääne-Harju Parish ","title":"Arvo Pärt Centre"},{"id":"62581480","text":"James Oliver Wild (born 5 January 1977) is a British Conservative Party politician.

Ha! is a particularly developed cove over a length of eleven kilometers on the Saguenay River in the region of Saguenay–Lac- Saint-Jean in Quebec, Canada. At the end of this natural corridor which was originally called in French the \\"Grande Anse\\", then the \\"Grande Baie\\", the Ha! Ha! River and Rivière-à-Mars. According to the Second Saguenay theory, this vast depression is the extension of the fault and collapse ditch of the Kenogami Lake which is located upstream less than twenty kilometers.  History  Long before the landing in 1838 of the Charlevoix settlers, founders of the Saint-Alexis-sur-l'Islet parish, this haven sheltered at the end of the bay constitutes a place of meeting and exchanges for the Amerindian populations. The two villages that have become modest urban centers in the 20th century merge before finding themselves in the center of the district of La Baie within the big city of Saguenay. It is through this bay that the bauxite of the aluminum smelters of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean transits to the port facilities of to be discharged subsequently carried by train to the various factories of Rio Tinto Alcan. Since September 2009, the tourist potential of the bay has been exploited with the inauguration of a port of call for cruise ships. During the winter for thousands of generations, when the ice is solid there, they practice ice fishing. The Saguenay flood, in July 1996 caused a significant deposit of sediment in this bay.  Toponymy  The term Ha! Ha! Does not come under the trivial onomatopoeia, but probably from an alteration of a Montagnais toponym almost unpronounceable in French which means in Algonquin place where bark is exchanged. Other linguists think of a possible derivation of the term French haha which means unexpected obstacle on a path.Rivière Ha! Ha!,Commission de Toponymie du Québec But in this specific case, we do not perceive the obstacle in question. In Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, certain places, moreover, correlated with the hydrographic basin leading towards the bay on the homonymous Saguenay also use this appellation: * Ha! Ha! River; * Lake Ha!

It originally aired in December 2003 on DR2, and has since been rebroadcast in 2004, 2009, and 2013. The Christmas calendar is satire on the way Christmas is traditionally presented in TV, by instead presenting drug- addicts, gangsters and religious fanatics, and a social realistic parody on the underclass. It is based an radio show by Matthesen of the same name, sent in 1999 on DR P3. When DR 2 in December 2003 became the third most viewed TV- channel in Denmark, DR considered Jul på Vesterbro one of the factors. In 2004 it was named \\"innovation of the year\\" by the Danish Producers' Association. It is considered to have attained cult status.  Plot  Stewart Stardust lives in an apartment in Vesterbro with his wife Vivian. Their son, Danny, is a drug addict just released on parole, and he moves in with them. A sociologist for the public authorities, Arne Nougatgren, is checking up on Danny, as a condition for his parole is that he has a well-functioning home, and that somebody can provide for him. Stewart own a mobile hot dog stand (pølsevogn) placed on Christiansborg square, but his income is threatened when its engine is stolen. The family's financial troubles increases when Danny make Randi, a drug-addict prostitute, pregnant, and she starts demanding child support from Danny after giving birth two days later, and when their landlord Greta threatens to kick them out if they do not pay the rent they are behind on. A Muslim named Kafir offers to repair the hot dog stand for free, and have a Russian, Igor, providing him spare parts. At the same time, a news speaker reports of fear of a terror attack against an international summit held at Christiansborg, specifically from a terror organisation called \\"Yellow Crescent\\" that seemingly cooperates with weapon smugglers from the former Soviet Union. While Stewart and Danny attempts to convince Arne that family is bonding, Arne decides to get more involved with the family, much to Stewart and Danny's dismal. The repair of the hot dog stand is delayed, as Kefir's spare parts keep getting stolen. Danny sells some \\"firecrackers\\" found in the garage (where the hot dog stand is located) to some scouts, and Arne gives them a Christmas decoration made of plastic explosive (thinking it is clay); in both instances the news report of explosions involving scouts. Kefir buys spare parts from Igor for two million kroner, who is handed to him in a red suitcase. While Igor passes out from drinking, Stewart opens the box with spare parts and finds something that resembles a bomb or a missile, and he and Danny concludes that is must be a new engine. Shortly thereafter, news report that nuclear warheads from the Soviet Union cost several millions kroner on the black market. Danny can not unlock the suitcase, and sells it locked for 300 kroner. When Igor finds out, he demands it back and threatens to kill Danny. Danny finds out that Randi have not actually given birth, thought she is still pregnant. Arne reveals that there are public grants for young families, so Stewart sends Danny on a date with Randi so he can make amends. Greta gives Stewart respite on the rent, in exchange for Stewart working as caretaker, and a share of the income from the hot dog stand, once it has been repaired. Arne have sex with Stewart's wife Vivian, and Stewart becomes angry and beats both Arne, the scouts, Randi, Kefir, Igor, and Greta. He kicks Arne out of the apartment and quit the agreement with Greta, so Arne demands that Danny return to jail and Greta that Steward leaves the apartment. They instead decide to \\"fight the system\\", and barricade themselves in the apartment with heavy weapons provided by Kefir. After multiple earlier failed attempts by Igor, he returns again to kill Danny and Stewart, but is met with a grenade. Randi is allowed in, as she and Danny have become close. When the police demand to enter the building, Stewart, Danny, and Randi plans to flee in the hot dog stand, but is stopped by Kefir and his group. Igor joins and demand to be given either his suitcase or his nuclear bomb, and Kefir shoot and kill Igor. Kefir admits to be part of Yellow Crescent, and that their plan is to blew up Christiansborg with the hot dog stand. He orders his men to kill Stewart, Danny, and Randi, but Arne shows up before the order can be carried out. He sings a song about Christmas peace and love that moves everybody. Kefir and Stewart become friends again, and Stewart forgives Arne for sleeping with Vivian. Kefir's wife, who wears a Niqāb, remove the veil and reveal himself as an Israeli Mossad agent named Ibrahim who have infiltrated Yellow Crescent. He is killed by Greta, who show up in full Nazi uniform and announce her intention to build a new world order based on pork. She picks up a sausage from Stewart's disgusting pack of sausages, take a bit, and demand that everybody else do the same. Kefir is about to take a bite, but then Greta dies of food poisoning. The police raid the garage and arrests Kefir and his men. With all problems solved, Stewart, Danny, Randi and Arne returns to the apartment to celebrate Christmas Eve together. They run out of pickled cabbage and Stewart go to the hot dog stand to fetch some more. The story ends with Stewart accidentally detonating the nuclear bomb when he tries to heat the pickled cabbage in the microwave oven, blowing up all of Copenhagen. The show have a number of recurring elements. Each episode starts with an archeologist in the future recapping the story, and finding an artifact relevant to the story of the episode. They end with a narrator listing some unanswered questions, and the characters interrupting and comment on the voice's words. Every day Stewart opens his Advent calendar, and is always surprised when it turns out to be a beer. Other recurring elements include Stewart mixing up Kefir's name with other dairy products (kefir is a dairy product), Vivian loudly yelling \\"go away\\" every time somebody opens the door to her room (only her hand is shown on screen), Stewart offering his increasingly disgusting sausages to the other characters, and Stewart having fond flashbacks of wise words from his \\"Papa\\", when he used to beat Stewart. Characters Besides extras, all roles are played by comedian Anders Matthesen. The main characters are: * Stewart Stardust: an alcoholic sailor, who lives in Vesterbro with his aggressive wife Vivian. * Danny Stardust: the drug-addictive son of Stewart and Vivian, who is on parole * Arne Nougatgren: a social worker from the municipality who checks on Danny. * Randi: A prostitute who claim to have a son with Danni * Greta: The fascist landlord of Stewart and Vivian's apartment * Kefir: Engineer from Syria, repairing Stewart's hot dog stand * Igor: Former Colonel in the Russian army, providing spare parts to Kefir Sune Svanekier was standin for Matthesen.

It is named after the Moravian missionary F. Weber who acquired the set from an Afghani merchant in Ladakh, and then forwarded it to the German Indologist and philologist Rudolf Hoernlé in Calcutta. The manuscripts consist of 76 page-leaves, written in Northwestern Gupta and Central Asian Nagari (Turkestanic Brahmi, slanting Gupta) scripts. They were copied before the end of 7th-century, likely in the 5th-century or the 6th–century.; The original texts that were copied to produce these manuscripts were likely considerably older Indian texts, at least one between 3rd-century BCE and pre-2nd-century CE. The Weber Manuscript is notable for having been written on two types of paper – Central Asian and Nepalese, attesting to the spread of paper technology outside of interior China and its use for Indian religious texts by the 5th– or 6th-century. The Weber Manuscripts include fragments of: * a manuscript of a Sanskrit dictionary (kosha), * an astronomical treatise based on the movement of the moon with Vedic terms and 28 nakshatras (lunar zodiacs), * a goddess Parvati stotra with Rudra and Shiva–related Hindu mythology treatise in the style of Puranas, * an eulogistic text on Vedic rishi Angirasa but with some Buddhistic terms, * a Buddhist dharani and sorcery treatise in a \\"barbarous mixture of Pali and Sanskrit\\" according to Hoernle, * a Buddhist treatise on snake charm (dharani) that praises the Buddha and claims the charm was taught by the Buddha to Mahayaksha Manibhadra, includes a list of names of some Nagas (snakes) * another Buddhist treatise on snake charm (dharani) quite similar to the previous treatise in content, also includes a list of names of some Nagas * a treatise for treating some disease by fasting, penance, then preparing and taking a prescription, includes medical charms * an unclear text in a different language but with Sanskrit words, possibly a Buddhist tantric work The scribes were likely Buddhist because the Weber Manuscript was discovered in the ruins of a Buddhist monastery, the treatises include verses that praise the Buddha though the predominant language isn't Pali, is either mostly accurate classical Sanskrit or occasionally a crude mix of Pali and Sanskrit. Even the Sanskrit dictionary includes a phrase ksatriyair Buddha-nirjitaih, or \\"Kshatriyas conquered by Buddha\\", which suggests that the author was probably Buddhist. The Weber Manuscripts are currently preserved in the collections of the Bodleian Library in Oxford. Discovery The Weber Manuscript was found in Kucha, China (red dot above), the same location as the Bower Manuscript. Hoernle received the Weber Manuscript from Leh-based F. Weber in 1893. At that time, based on what he was told, he reported that the manuscript was discovered 60 miles south of Yarkand. However, interviews and surveys conducted between 1893 and 1900, persuaded Hoernle that the Weber Manuscript came from Kucha, the same location as the Bower Manuscript. These were found by the same Muslim treasure hunters who were digging up Kucha area Buddhist ruins in late 19th-century. These manuscript bundles were likely opened by the treasure hunters, carelessly examined, got jumbled as they put them back into separate parts to sell. They sought different buyers for each part. Two of the parts were bought in India and another by a buyer from Russia. The India-based buyers forwarded them to Rudolf Hoernle, and these came to be called the Weber Manuscript and McCartney Manuscript. The Russian portion came to be called the Petrovski Manuscript and became a part of the Sanskrit manuscripts collection in Saint Petersburg. Some of the folio leaves of these various manuscripts are of the same treatise. The Petrovski Manuscript – also referred to as Petrovsky Manuscript, St Petersburg Asiatic Museum catalog number SI P/33 – was studied by the Indologist Sergey Oldenburg in the 1890s and thereafter. He identified some parts as portions of some sutra and the start of the appendix. These were established by Fukita Takamichi in 1989 as parts of Nidanasutra and Nagaropomasutra (dharani).

Career He had been a timber merchant and a director of the Wisbech Gas Light & Coke company His earliest dated photograph Is that of 12 October 1852. His work dates between that year and 1864. Many images are of buildings long since disappeared, such as the stone Town bridge, Butter Cross, Old Workhouse and Octagon Church. The General Cemetery Chapel built in 1848 would have followed as the roof had been removed by Fenland District Council, and it was in danger of demolition, however Wisbech Society carried out a restoration project and it can now be compared with Smith's image of 1856. His image of Leach's eight-sail mill (c1853) captures the mill before the sails were removed. Smith was a member of the Wisbech Working Men's Institute as was another photographer William Ellis (missionary). After Ellis's death Smith printed some of his photographs. Legacy The majority of Smith's surviving images are held in two collections. 190 negatives and over 100 prints are in the Wisbech & Fenland Museum and 125 other negatives and about 70 prints at the Kodak museum. These were acquired by Kodak in 1971 and compared to those held at Wisbech. An exhibition in Peckover House in 1973 was followed by others in London and the USA.

The title is possibly derived from Christ's parable of the hidden treasure from , which is followed by the parable of the pearl in ; incidentally, pearls are a major metaphor used in Mani's teaching. It enjoyed popularity and was referred to by many anti-Manichaean polemic writers, including Hegemonius and Augustine of Hippo. The main theme appears to be Mani's anthropology of man, teaching “what parts of the Soul came from the pure Light, and what parts proceed from the vicious Darkness”. Duncan Greenlees states that Mani probably wrote The Treasure of Life while traveling through Greater Khorasan. The Treasure of Life is central to one miraculous event surrounding the prophet Mani: when Mar Ammo was halted by a frontier spirit in the land of Sogdia, the disciple fasted and prayed for two days. Perhaps through a vision, Mani sensed his disciple's trouble and appeared at the watch-post on the frontier of Greater Khorasan. The prophet then taught Mar Ammo a passage from The Treasure of Life to recite. This appeased the spirit of the frontier, who saw that Mar Ammo was different from the similarly religious men of her land (probably Buddhists) and then allowed the disciple to resume his missionary work in the region.

It lies on the border between Nigeria and Benin. Its elevation is 600 feet (183 metres) above sea level. Ilara Yewa is about 50 kilometers by road from Ketu, a major trading town in Benin. The second-largest settlement, Ilara, merges into Kanga in Benin.  History  = Settlement = Ilara-Ogudo Yewa is an offshoot community of Ketu, a town situated in the present-day Benin Republic. History has it that, Ketu people migrated from Ile-Ife under the leadership of Sopasan (Alaketu), son of Oduduwa, progenitor of the Yoruba race, to found the Ketu Kingdom. Ilara had maintained the affinity with Ketu until Ketu lost Ilara to the British protectorate as a result in boundary demarcation. Alaketu of Ketu from time immemorial is the prescribed Authority over the Oloola of Ilara chieftaincy matters in towns and the villages of the Ketu speaking people. The town has tow Ruling houses before, but later the elders in the town met and agreed that the ruling houses should increase to four. The names of the Ruling houses are Idogbede Ruling House, Otesu Ruling House, faningbe eleba Ruling House, isako / igbaka ruling house. = Legend = People under the leadership of Baba Obosu, Aduitan, Ogbe and Dosunmu to mention just a few left Ketu in search of wild-life. On getting to the forest they killed an elephant, and as they opened its the stomach they found “Ose Sango and Edun Aara”. They were amazed and afraid of the turn of events as such they consulted Ifá the oracle who told them not to eat the elephant but bury it instead and settle in that place. The elephant was buried in the forest and they called the name of the place Ogudo and the forest was called Igbo-Ogudo (Ibiti Ogun ni ki ndo abi Tedo), meaning: \\"the place where Ogun(god of iron) said I should settle\\". = Colonial years = The European powers divided West Africa between them at the Berlin Conference of 1884-85. The Ketus had earlier been conquered by Dahomey in 1886, and they went to the French who restored Ketu in 1893 under a protectorate. The flag was hosted. The French colonist asked if there were other communities who wanted to join, which made the Ketus reach out to Ilara during the reign of Regent Alaba Ida the then Alaketu in 1893-1894. She selected some of her chiefs to accompany the colonial Master to Ilara. However, the Ilara people were unwilling to join the French Colony. To signify their interest or displeasure, the flag of French and British was hoisted so that the people should choose the flag of the country they wished to follow. The then Baale Aseje stood up to choose a British flag because they had previously consulted the Oracle Ifá who instructed them to go with the British. The Alaketu delegates were furious about the decision of the Ilara people and decided that, since Ilarahad has chosen to follow British against the wishes of Alaketu the prescribing authority over Ilara, the British flag would be hoisted at her backyard. That is why Ilara was divided.  Governance  The Imeko-Afon local government was created from the old Egbado North local government in December 1996, during the military regime of General Sani Abacha. Chief Lawrence Sunday Fatokun was the first Executive Chairman of Imeko Afon Local government an indigen of Ilara Indigenes from the town include the Hon Owolabi Àsàmú, member of the House of Representatives, Abuja 1999-2003 under the SDP party.

The soil is fertile for tomatoes, cucumber, golden melon, cocoa, cassava, and other crops like pepper, maize, groundnuts, yam, and teak-timber. There has been a market in the town since about 1898.  Culture and community  Among the annual cultural festival are Oro, Gelede, Bolojo, Iwe cultural Dance, Kete, Sakara, ere Olode, Egungun.

History Gall, a son of printer David Gall, first came to public notice in 1889 with a series on the newly-developed irrigation colony at Renmark. He was previously employed as assistant to McLean Brothers, Rigg and Co., ironmongers in Hindley Street, but finding the work tiresome, decided to turn his hobby of photography into a full-time occupation. He was the first in South Australia to do half-tone prints. He was successful in supplying photographs for illustrated catalogues. He was one of the oldest members of the South Australian Photographic Society, having joined before 1889. From around 1900 he was mostly involved in judging and exhibiting non- competitively. By 1893 he was working for Walter Scott-Barry, (c. 1849 – 5 October 1911) ex-Government photographer who had studios at 146 Rundle Street from 1890 to 1896, moved to Mount Gambier, then Warrnambool, Victoria. In 1894 he made a glass-plate copy of Henry Jones's 1872 mosaic collection of Old Colonists, in which 24 portraits are somewhat different from Jones's original held by the State Library. The circumstances around this work are not explained. By 1895 he had his own studio in Grenfell Street, later at Alma Chambers in Pirie Street, and was official photographer for many high-profile events, including balls at Government House and at Federation conventions. In 1898 he began using flash illumination. In later years he concentrated on portraiture, working from a studio at his home, \\"Woodbridge\\" at Tynte Street east, North Adelaide. He was active in promoting North Adelaide as a part of the city, rather than a suburb. It was there he died, on 19 April 1925. Though courteous and urbane, he was of a shy and retiring nature, played no part in public affairs, and never married.

Life  Schnitzer was born in Ratzersdorf (then Kingdom of Hungary, today a district of Bratislava, Slovakia). He began studying philosophy in Pest, but soon worked as a journalist. From 1857 he lived in Vienna and wrote for various newspapers, such as the Pester Lloyd and the ', and as an editor for the newspaper Der Fortschritt. In 1867 he returned to Budapest and was first a member of the editorial board of Bécsi Debatte. In 1869 he founded together with Zsigmond Bródy (1840-1906)Bródy, Zsigmond. In Encyclopaedia Judaica, 1972, volume 4, the daily newspaper Neues Pester Journal, which he headed as editor-in-chief for a decade. Besides he worked on Hungarian plays for German theatres; in 1879 he translated Ede Zsigligeti's Rauschgold for the Viennese Burgtheater and Mór Jókais Held Pálffy for the Carltheater. After the sale of his share in the Neue Pester Journal he moved back to Vienna in 1881 and worked mainly as a librettist and translator. Schnitzer was particularly acclaimed for his translations and poems of the works of Sándor Petőfi into German. His friendship with Johann Strauss II led him to the libretto of his Zigeunerbaron and the cultural-historical and partly biographical work Bunte Geschichten aus der Johann-Strauß-Zeit. As co-owner of the amusement park Venice in Vienna founded by Gabor Steiner, he organized the financing and operated the construction of new sights, such as the Vienna Giant Ferris Wheel. In 1894 he had the idea of commissioning a circular painting entitled \\"Kaiser Franz Joseph und seine Zeit\\" (Emperor Franz Joseph and his Time) for the fiftieth anniversary of the reign of Emperor Franz Joseph I in 1898. It was executed by the history painter Philipp Fleischer, and exhibited at the Ausstellungsstraße 143 in a circular building specially designed for this purpose by Oskar Marmorek.Wiener Rundgemälde-Gesellschaft.

Majority of the inhabitants are Christians. Agriculture is the primary occupation of the inhabitants. Most of the arable land in the village got submerged after commissioning of the Mapithel dam since Riha is one of the closest upstream villages. Moreover, most of the residents had to relocate to higher ground before commissioning of the dam.

The election was subsequently annulled by the Central Election Commission during the 2020 Kyrgyzstan protests.  Background  Due to party infighting between supporters of current President Sooronbay Jeenbekov and former President Almazbek Atambayev, the governing Social Democratic Party of Kyrgyzstan did not contest the election, and new parties split off and ran in their stead: the pro-Jeenbekov Unity, and the pro-Atambayev Social Democrats of Kyrgyzstan. Ata-Zhurt, which had previously split with the Respublika Party, partnered up with My Homeland Kyrgyzstan and both parties ran under the latter's name. The Ata Meken Socialist Party entered into a coalition called \\"New Breath\\" with the Liberal Democratic Party, New Breath Youth Association, and the Association \\"Green Alliance of Kyrgyzstan\\". The election took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Electoral system The 120 seats in the Supreme Council are elected by proportional representation in a single nationwide constituency. To win seats, parties must pass a national electoral threshold of 7% of the votes cast, and receive at least 0.7% of the vote in each of the seven regions.Kyrgyz Republic: Election for Jorgorku Keneshg (Kyrgyz Supreme Council) IFES No one party is allowed to hold more than 65 seats.Electoral system IPU Party lists are required to have at least 30% of the candidates from each gender, and every fourth candidate had to be of a different gender. Each list is also required to have at least 15% of the candidates being from ethnic minorities and 15% of under 35 years old, as well as at least two candidates with disabilities.THE CONSTITUTIONAL LAW On Presidential and Jogorku Kenesh Elections in the Kyrgyz Republic  Conduct  Several opposition parties called on the government to postpone the election due to the COVID-19 pandemic prior to the campaign period in September. During the elections, several parties were accused of buying votes. Several journalists also reported that they had been harassed or attacked. The costs associated with filing to run for the elections and campaigning were also criticized, with critics saying it was impossible for smaller parties without ties to an oligarch to afford. Preliminary results Unity received a plurality of votes, beating out the Ata-Zhurt–My Homeland Kyrgyzstan alliance by under one percent, with 46 seats. Ata-Zhurt–My Homeland Kyrgyzstan received 45 seats, while other parties lagged behind. The Kyrgyzstan Party received 16 seats, while United Kyrgyzstan entered parliament for the first time with 13. Several other parties failed to meet the 7% threshold, including Ata Meken, which had been a part of every parliament since the 2010 Kyrgyz Revolution. Out of the parties that made it into parliament, only United Kyrgyzstan consistently opposes the incumbent government led by President Jeenbekov.  Aftermath  The Ata Meken Socialist Party and the Social Democrats both disputed the results, and staged a brief protest in Bishkek. One other party also disputed the result. Around 4,000 people also staged a protest in Bishkek when the results were announced, with smaller protests held in two other cities. Around 16 people were injured as police attempted to disperse the crowds. A total of 12 parties also signed a document urging the government to annul the elections as a result of irregularities and hold new ones. One group protesting in Bishkek managed to free ex-President Atambayev from jail on late in the night on 5 October, where he had been serving an 11-year-and-two-month sentence for a corruption since June. Protestors also occupied the building housing the parliament and presidential administration. There were also reports that part of the parliament building was set ablaze. Protests continued throughout the day on 6 October, eventually resulting in one death and around 590 injuries. A further several hundred were injured on the following day as well as protests continued. Atambayev was re-arrested on 10 October. Following continued protests, the results were annulled by the Central Election Commission on 6 October. Prime Minister Kubatbek Boronov and parliament speaker Dastan Jumabekov also tendered their resignation on 6 October. The parliament announced opposition figure Sadyr Zhaparov of the nationalist Patriotic party as acting Prime Minister, and Myktybek Abdyldayev as the new speaker of parliament. Zhaparov had been serving an 11-year and six-month prison sentence for taking a government official hostage in 2013 until his appointment. The mayors of Bishkek and Osh, as well as the governors of the Naryn, Talas, and Issyk-Kul regions also resigned. A group of 13 opposition parties said that they had formed the Coordinating Council of Popular Trust which would assume responsibility for formulating ideas to find a way out of the deadlock. It was later announced that Zhaparov did not have the backing of enough parties to be installed as the new PM, resulting in further confusion. Zhaparov eventually ended up being elected PM with the necessary quorum (51 MPs were present and 10 were voting by proxy) in the early hours of the morning on 11 October. President Jeenbekov vetoed the nomination on 12 October, but later accepted it after parliament voted to confirm him again on 13 October. Abdyldayev resigned as speaker on 10 October only a few days after he was appointed, with Kanatbek Isaev taking over the speakership on 13 October. On 15 October, President Jeenbekov announced that he would resign to prevent further bloodshed. His resignation will take effect should parliament approve it. It was approved on 16 October, and Prime Minister Zhaparov was installed as interim President by the parliament until new elections could be held, despite the Kyrgyz Constitution saying that the next person in the line of succession is the speaker of the parliament. Speaker Isaev had previously stated that he was not interested in the position. New elections were tentatively scheduled for 20 December.

Paul Getty Museum Emanuel W. Bonavia (also spelt Emmanuel) (15 July 1829, Valletta – 14 November 1908) was a Maltese surgeon in the Indian Medical Service who wrote on many aspects of natural history, economic botany, and pioneered horticultural research in Lucknow. He was the first superintendent of the Lucknow Provincial Museum and the founder of the Lucknow Horticultural Gardens.  Life and work  Illustrations of Assyrian sacred trees by Bonavia (1888) Bonavia was born in Valletta, the third son of Mary née Hobson and Calcedonio Bonavia. An older brother Giuseppe Bonavia became an architect in the Royal Engineers while another brother George became an artist. Emanuel studied medicine at the Malta University and at the University of Edinburgh qualifying MRCS in 1857. He was commissioned Assistant Surgeon in the Indian Medical Service on 4 August 1857 and was present at the capture of Lucknow in March 1858 and saw action at the trans-Gogra campaign. He was promoted Surgeon Major in 1876 and Brigade Surgeon in 1885, retiring in 1888. He served as Principal of the medical school at Balrampur in 1873. Trained in medical botany, he came to take charge of the Lucknow garden in 1876. The Lucknow botanical garden began as a park after 1857. He then began to study the cultivation of citrus, date palms (an interest in date palms also led to studies on floral depiction in Assyrian monuments, suggesting that the Assyrian sacred tree was based on multiple trees of value including a date palm as the trunk) and other plants of economic importance. He wrote a book examining the prospects of cultivating date palms in India and The Villager's Domestic Medicine (1885). He speculated on the ancestry of Indian acid lime. He also published on sericulture in Oudh. He was also interested in other aspects of natural history and wrote a book on evolution which examined such aspects as the evolution of spots and stripes in wild cats and the origins of other animal skin patterning. He speculated that these patterns were derived from armoured ancestors such as glyptodonts with the ancestral rosette as seen in the leopard consolidated into spots in cheetahs, blotches, and stripes in other cats. In his Contributions to Christology (1869) he attempted to identify rational explanations for miracles involving animals. He corresponded with Charles Darwin, and naturalists in India such as Allan Octavian Hume to whom he sent bird specimens. He was one of the founders of the Lucknow museum (Oudh provincial museum), established in 1863. He contributed specimens to the museum, including that of a pink-headed duck, obtained from the local market. Bonavia also maintained careful records of weather and examined long-term variation in the patterns of rains, supporting the theory that linked them to sun-spots. He also served as a Civil Surgeon at Etawah and worked on public sanitation, making attempts to stop open defecation in Lucknow. Bonavia retired in 1888 and lived on Richmond road, Worthing, Sussex, continuing to take an interest in gardening and hybridization of ornamental plants, publishing in the Gardener's Chronicle, until his death.

She was the leading juvenile filly in Japan in 2019 when she was unbeaten in three starts including the Fantasy Stakes and the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies. In 2020 she ran second in both the Oka Sho and the NHK Mile Cup. Background Resistencia is a bay filly with a white blaze bred in Japan by Northern Farm. During her racing career she was trained by Takeshi Matsushita and raced in the green, white and red colours of the Northern Farm affiliate U Carrot Farm. She was from the ninth crop of foals sired by Daiwa Major, an outstanding miler whose wins included the Tenno Sho, Mile Championship and Yasuda Kinen. As a breeding stallion he has also sired Major Emblem, Curren Black Hill (NHK Mile Cup), Reine Minoru (Oka Sho) and Admire Mars. Resistencia's dam Malacostumbrada was a successful racehorse in her native Argentina, winning the Group 1 Gran Premio Gilberto Lerena in 2014. She came from a female-line family which had produced numerous major winners in South America as well as Hawk Wing, La Lorgnette, Bayakoa and Kitasan Black. Racing career =2019: two-year-old season= Resistencia was ridden in all of 2019 starts by Yuichi Kitamura. Resistencia made her track debut in a contest for previously unraced juveniles over 1400 metres at Kyoto Racecourse on 14 October and won from Key Dia and sixteen others. On 2 November, over the same course and distance, the filly was stepped up in class for the Grade 3 Fantasy Stakes and started at odds of 12.6/1 in a fifteen-runner field. After racing in second place for most of the way she took the lead early in the straight and kept on well to win by a length from the favourite Dream Castle with Clear Sound a neck away in third place. On 8 December at Hanshin Racecourse Resistencia was moved up to the highest level for the Hanshin Juvenile Fillies over 1600 metres and was made the 10.2/1 fourth choice in the betting behind Ria Amelia (Artemis Stakes), Woman's Heart (Niigata Nisai Stakes) and Cravache d'Or (runner-up in the Saudi Arabia Royal Cup). Of the other twelve runners only Christie, Maltese Diosa, Yamakatsu Mermaid and Lotus Land started at odds of less than 160/1. Resistencia took the lead from the start and was never challenged, drawing away from her opponents in the straight to win by five lengths and a nose from Maltese Diosa and Cravache d'Or. Her winning time of 1:32.7 was a new record for the race, beating the 1:33.1 set by Vodka in 2006. After the race Kitamura commented \\"I knew she had the necessary speed as long as she broke well so I concentrated on keeping her relaxed in the middle stages. We were hoping she would mature mentally and I'm happy to see that she was calm and relaxed today. She was so strong and has so much potential. Her future is definitely something to look forward to\\". In January 2020, at the JRA Awards for 2019, Resistencia was unanimously named Best Two-Year-Old Filly, taking all 274 votes. In the official Japanese rankings Resistencia was rated the best two-year-old filly of 2019, six pounds ahead of Ria Amelia and Woman's Heart. =2020: three-year-old season= On her first run as a three-year-old Resistencia started 2/5 favourite for the Grade 2 Tulip Sho over 1600 metres at Hanshin on 7 March but after leading for most of the way she sustained her first defeat as she was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third, beaten a nose and one and a quarter lengths by Maltese Diosa and Cravache d'Or. Despite her defeat in the Tulip Sho the filly started favourite for the Oka Sho over the same course and distance five weeks later. With Yutaka Take taking over the ride from Kitamura she settled in second place behind the front-running Smile Kana before taking the lead in the straight but was run down in the final strides and beaten into second place by Daring Tact. Christophe Lemaire took the ride when Resistencia was matched against colts in the Grade 1 NHK Mile Cup at Tokyo Racecourse on 10 May and started the 2/1 favourite in an eighteen-runner field. The race was dominated from the start by Resistencia and the colt Lauda Sion, with the filly getting the better of an early struggle for the lead before succumbing in the closing stages and finishing second, beaten one and a half lengths by her male rival.

Both are also known as \\"nudism\\". Naturist organisations have existed in New Zealand since the 1930s. Although not a daily feature of public life, social nudity is practised in a variety of other contexts in New Zealand culture.  New Zealand Naturist Federation  An attempt to set up a nudist club in Dunedin in 1933 was unsuccessful, attracting hostility from clergy, women's groups, and the police. Nudist clubs (known as \\"sun clubs\\") were successfully established in Dunedin and Auckland in early 1938; the Auckland Sun Group went into recess shortly afterwards due to the outbreak of World War II. In 1953 the allied nudist clubs of New Zealand gathered at Whanganui to hold a festival, called a \\"rally\\", which became an annual event. At the 1957 rally, held at the Canterbury Sun and Health Club's grounds in Rolleston near Christchurch, the affiliated clubs agreed to form the New Zealand Sunbathing Association, which was formally established on 1 January 1958. In 1977 the Association was renamed the New Zealand Naturist Federation. In 2016 the Federation in conjunction with Tourism New Zealand hosted the World Congress of the International Naturist Federation (INF) at the Wellington Naturist Club, marking the second time the Congress had ever been held in the Southern Hemisphere. This Congress was marked by political unrest, as sitting INF president Sieglinde Ivo was voted out in favour of French delegate Armand Jamier by a narrow majority. The vote was overturned and Ivo returned to the presidency at a special World Congress in 2017, held in Vienna. In December 2019 the Federation voted to withdraw from the INF, retaining the right to rejoin at some future date. The Federation today includes 17 affiliated clubs with a total membership, in 2012, of 1,600 people. Numbers at the annual rally have been dwindling in recent decades. = gonatural magazine = The New Zealand Naturist Federation published a quarterly magazine from 1956 to 2020. It was launched by Stewart Ransom under the title The National Review, which became The National Naturist Review in 1958, The New Zealand Naturist in 1961, and gonatural in 2005. gonaturals content was largely devoted to lifestyle articles, along with news articles on events related to social nudity, and occasional opinion pieces. The National Naturist Review first printed photo illustrations in 1960, and the New Zealand Naturist began featuring a cover photo for each issue in 1963. The photos were retouched, to avoid legal repercussions, until after the 1968 Indecent Publications Tribunal finding that nude photos were not unlawful in New Zealand. From the 1990s until 2018, full nudity was kept off the covers so that the magazine could be sold by newsagents without a plain wrapper. In 2018, due to costs, gonatural was withdrawn from newsagents and became a subscriber-only magazine; however, it continued to make a loss for the Federation, and was discontinued in August 2020.  Social nudity in New Zealand culture  = Early history = Māori men and woman perform a (1857) Māori people prior to European colonisation wore woven cloaks and kilts for protection from the weather and to denote social status. However, very little of the human body had to be concealed for modesty's sake as such. According to reports by Captain James Cook and Joseph Banks upon their visit to New Zealand in 1769–70, Māori men frequently went casually naked except for a belt with a piece of string attached holding their foreskin shut over their glans penis, the only part that they showed any reluctance to uncover in social settings, whereas Māori women covered their entire pubic area with small aprons or bunches of fragrant plant material, and reacted with shame when caught uncovered in the presence of men. There was no shame or modesty attached to women's breasts, and therefore no garments devoted to concealing them – the colourful woven bodices () worn by women in performances are a colonial-era invention, which became standard costume only in the 1950s. Pre-pubescent children wore no clothes at all. The shock value of exposing the female genitals gave it power as a form of protest, a gesture known in Māori as . One notable modern example was performed by Mihi Kōtukutuku Stirling in Rotorua in 1917. Mita Taupopoki, a Te Arawa chief, objected to her standing on \\"his\\" marae as she was a woman. Stirling replied that she outranked him by birth; that she was not on his marae, he was on her marae; and finally that he came from a woman's genitals – showing her own by way of illustration. This countered the insult that he had given her. Those present were asked to repudiate her speech but no-one came forward. The European colonists regarded nudity as an obscenity. The nakedness of Māori was cited, often in the phrase \\"naked savages\\", as a sign of their racial inferiority (which in turn was seen as casting into doubt the validity of the Treaty of Waitangi). In 1939, when a young woman was convicted of \\"willfully and obscenely exposing her person\\" for swimming nude in public at Takapuna in Auckland, the presiding magistrate described her as \\"a disgrace to her sex\\" and speculated that only \\"an element of insanity\\" could explain her behaviour. = Present attitudes = A 2008 poll by Research New Zealand reported that 54% of New Zealanders supported the right of naturists to go nude on beaches at least in designated areas, with over half that number finding nudity acceptable on any beach. However, there remains a contingent of New Zealanders who consider nudity obscene. Naturists who engage in casual public nudity, even in places where this is lawful, run the risk of having the police called on them by disapproving members of the public. In 2019, a man was convicted of willful damage after chainsawing the phallus off a Māori carving on a walking track at Woodville near Palmerston North; he claimed that the statue \\"promoted sex for pleasure\\" and that he had support from God. When a small group of Taupō residents called for public signage banning G-strings at the local Spa Thermal Park in early 2020, the strength of opposition to their proposal made national news. In February 2016, complaints were laid with the Judicial Conduct Commission over photographs of a District Court judge playing pétanque in the nude at Pineglades Naturist Club. Though the judge's name was never published, the case drew national attention, with negative commentary from former government minister Rodney Hide and the Sensible Sentencing Trust, and support from TV host and self-declared nudist Paul Henry. The Judicial Conduct Commissioner does not report on the outcomes of individual complaints made against judges, and no further action was made public with regard to the case. Social nudity in New Zealand has no specific political alignment; it is associated with hippie culture, with social justice causes like Free the Nipple, and also with \\"politically incorrect\\" public figures such as Paul Henry and Marc Ellis. = National Nude Day = \\"National Nude Day\\" was a mock public holiday created when TV personality and former rugby player Marc Ellis challenged viewers of the TV2 talk show SportsCafe to streak in front of then Prime Minister Helen Clark. The show ran an event each year inviting viewers to submit photos and video of themselves performing daily activities in the nude, which was continued on the internet (rebranded as \\"World Nude Day\\" or \\"International Nude Day\\") until around 2009. A number of student pubs in Ellis' home town of Dunedin offered special deals for nude patrons on the day. Internet collections of world holidays mark the day as 14 July; in fact it was held at the organisers' whim, having variously fallen on 19 September and 6 February. = Student traditions = Since 2006, veterinary science students at Massey University have marked the midpoint of their five-year course by posing for a nude calendar, titled the Barely There Calendar, to raise money for a class trip and a selected charity. Charities supported have included Retired Working Dogs NZ, Pet Refuge, and the animal hospital at Wellington Zoo. Second-year law students at the University of Otago attend an annual summer camp organised by the Society of Otago University Law Students (SOULS), which, by 2017, featured a regular talent show including male striptease. In 2018, the University withdrew support for the camp after an investigation reported nudity and \\"drunken and sexualised\\" behaviour, with the result that it was cancelled. The investigation found no evidence of sexual misconduct or criminal activity. In order to avoid cancellation the following year, SOULS implemented changes to the camp including banning nudity and holding the camp in a secret location away from media scrutiny. = Nudity in sport = A nude rugby match was held in Dunedin each winter from 2002 to 2014 as pre-match entertainment for the first professional rugby game of the season. In more recent years it has become sporadic as organisers have other demands on their time. When A J Hackett opened the world's first commercial bungy jumping site at Kawarau Bridge near Queenstown, customers who performed the jump in the nude were granted free entry. This offer was later withdrawn because too many jumpers were taking advantage of it, but the site remains clothing-optional. Billy Connolly famously bungy-jumped nude from the bridge during his 2004 World Tour of New Zealand. Nambassa festival 1978 = Festivals = The music festival Nambassa, held from 1976 to 1981 near Waihī in the Hauraki District, at its 1979 peak attracted an audience of 75,000, of whom an estimated 35% chose to attend partially or completely nude. The event began a tradition of nudity at New Zealand summer festivals which continues today at Convergence, Kiwiburn, Luminate, Rhythm & Vines, Splore, and elsewhere. Nudity at Rhythm & Vines made international news in 2018 with a viral video capturing an incident in which a male festival-goer groped a topless woman who retaliated by striking him in the face. = Boobs on Bikes = Boobs on Bikes was a mostly annual parade of topless men and women riding on motorcycles through large New Zealand cities in the 2000s, most prominently Auckland. One main aim of the parade was to draw attention to the fact that toplessness is legal in New Zealand, so that women have the same right to go bare-chested as men; this aligns both with the general philosophy of naturism and with feminist causes such as Free the Nipple. The other, however, was to publicise the Erotica Lifestyles Expo, which is erotic in character and thus not strictly in keeping with the naturist principle of non-sexual social nudity. = International nude events = New Zealand naturists participate in international nude events including the World Naked Bike Ride, World Naked Gardening Day, and the International Day Without Swimsuits (known in New Zealand as the \\"International Day Without Togs\\"). = Beaches = New Zealand has no official nude beaches, as nudity is legal on any beach where it is \\"known to occur\\" (see below). The naturist organisations Free Beaches NZ Inc. and Nude Beaches New Zealand maintain lists of such places.  Legality  The Police Offences Act 1908 prescribed imprisonment with hard labour for anyone who \\"willfully and obscenely exposes his person in any public place or within the view thereof\\". Male offenders could, at the court's discretion, also be sentenced to be whipped. This was replaced in 1981 by the Summary Offences Act, in which the hard labour and whipping were abolished, and the specification of the offence in question was changed to \\"in or within view of any public place, intentionally and obscenely exposes any part of his or her genitals\\". The new wording implies that it is possible to expose one's genitals in a public place without it being \\"obscene\\" (since otherwise the word \\"obscenely\\" would not have needed to be specified); it also excludes exposure of the buttocks or female breast from the offence. The Indecent Exposure provision is now in practice largely reserved for cases of public sexual gratification. Public nudity may be prosecuted under the Offensive Behaviour provision of the Act, which prescribes a fine for anyone who \\"behaves in an offensive or disorderly manner\\". In 1991 an Auckland man was convicted of offensive behaviour in the District Court for sunbathing nude on the beach at Fitzpatrick Bay in the presence of a group of visiting schoolchildren. On appeal to the High Court his conviction was quashed, on the grounds that, since Fitzpatrick Bay was \\"a place where it was not uncommon for persons to sunbathe in the nude\\", a reasonable person would \\"regard the conduct... as inappropriate, unnecessary, and in bad taste, but not arousing feelings of anger, disgust, or outrage.\\" In 1995, the same man was convicted of offensive behaviour for going nude in a public street; this time the High Court upheld the conviction, since the street was not a place where public nudity was common or known to occur. New Zealand is a common law country, which means that judicial decisions determine the law that subsequent cases must follow.

It may also be called a food hack, and is a type of life hack, although the concept of a kitchen hack predates the coinage of either term. Multiple kitchen hacks posted to social media have become popular, and some have been shown not to work, not to be worth the effort, or to be dangerous.  History  Kitchen or food hacks are techniques used by home cooks and culinary professionals to make food preparation tasks easier, faster, or more efficient. The idea of a kitchen hack is not new. Kitchen hacks have been used throughout history to adapt to lack of equipment by those living in prisons, dorms, and under conditions of poverty or scarcity. NPR called Robinson Crusoe the \\"patron saint of the kitchen hack\\", because he managed to produce bread with none of the normally required tools, such as a plow, scythe, mill, or oven. Gourds were used by enslaved people in the American South to replace dippers and other cooking utensils. During World War I, Salvation Army cooks in France used shell casings as rolling pins and helmets as deep fryers. Edna Lewis recalled her family used coins to measure baking powder. Mahatma Gandhi used a glass bottle to roll out rotis while imprisoned in the 1930s. Ruth Reichl jokingly claims she invented the microplane when, as a young impoverished new cook, she used a rasp to grate Parmesan. The term kitchen hack is an offshoot of life hacks, a term coined in 2003 by technology journalist Danny O'Brien. Like life hacks, which O'Brien characterizes as \\"a way of cutting through an apparently complex system with a really simple, non-obvious fix\\", kitchen hacks solve a commonly encountered kitchen problem. Eater said kitchen hacks represent \\"our hope that, one day, we won’t have to put in the work\\" in the kitchen and promote the idea that anyone can become an expert at a kitchen task immediately. Food52 said kitchen hacks \\"should solve (or purport to solve) a tangible problem, to make the task at hand either possible or easier\\" and \\"are creative for the purpose of utility and resourcefulness.\\" They noted that Google searches for food and drink hacks increased 300% between 2011 and 2016.  Notable hacks  Some kitchen hacks become popular on social media and YouTube, either when someone posts a hack or posts about trying and failing to replicate the hack. Alice Zaslavsky, an Australian food commentator, attributes the popularity of food hacks on social media to them being \\"educational and inspiring\\", and because there is a \\"novelty factor.\\" A video showing how to use a water bottle to separate eggs became popular in August 2012. In 2016 Food52 called it a hack that works. Scientific American used the method in 2017 as one of their Bring Science Home series. In March 2019 a hack showing how to eat a pineapple without first peeling or coring it was popular. In October a video showing how to seed a pomegranate was popular. There are multiple hacks for peeling garlic. One method involves shaking garlic between two metal bowls or in a mason jar. Good Housekeeping called the method \\"not a win.\\" In June 2019 a video of a method whereby cloves are 'plucked' with the tip of a knife from a whole head of garlic and come away peeled was popular. Mashable reported that a crucial preparatory step had been omitted. Eater's Jaya Saxena said the popularity of garlic hacks was due to garlic being integral to multiple cuisines and to the fact preparing garlic is an especially tedious task.  Hoaxes and dangerous hacks  Food52 in 2016 called the term \\"out of control\\", noting that media companies, trying to benefit from the increase in Google searches for the term, had titled increasing numbers of posts as hacks, even when the content of the post did not qualify as ways to make kitchen tasks faster, easier, or more efficient but were instead simply recipes or gadgets. That same year Food52 investigated multiple popular kitchen hacks and found that some simply did not work at all, many did not work well, and of those that worked, some did not improve speed, ease, or efficiency. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2019 on multiple kitchen hacks that were either scientifically impossible, such as using warm milk to repair broken china, or were dangerous, such as cooking foil-wrapped bacon in an upright toaster, which toaster manufacturers said could cause fires or electrical shock. In 2019 Today investigated multiple popular cooking hacks and declared some of them dangerous.

He was the first head of Saint Joseph's College to have been an alumnus of the school.  Early life  Cornelius Gillespie was born on September 12, 1851 in County Donegal, located in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. He immigrated to the United States at the age of sixteen, and was accepted to Saint Joseph's College in Philadelphia; the school was officially closed while a new campus was being constructed, however, and he studied under one of the school's Jesuit professors. He entered the Society of Jesus, proceeding to its novitiate in Frederick, Maryland in 1873. He then spent time as a missionary throughout the Eastern United States, and was ordained a priest in 1887. He then served for two years as the vice president of Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.  Ministry and leadership  = Gonzaga College = Gillespie was appointed the sixteenth president of Gonzaga College and pastor of St. Aloysius Church in Washington, D.C., succeeding Edward A. McGurk. He took office on November 18, 1890. As president, he announced on January 29, 1893 that a new building for the college would be built; three years later, the new hall was complete. A second building was erected, with the cornerstone being laid on May 24, 1896. The building was complete by October 1896. That year being the school's golden jubilee, Gillespie created the school's first alumni society. The first school musical band was organized that year as well. Gillespie's term as president and pastor came to an end in 1898, and he was succeeded by John F. Galligan. = Saint Joseph's College = Gillespie twice served as president of Saint Joseph's College in Philadelphia. He became the eighth president of the college on August 20, 1900, succeeding William F. Clark. He was the college's first president to have been an alumnus of the school, and served until September 1907, when he was replaced by Denis T. O'Sullivan. O'Sullivan died soon thereafter, and Gillespie again became the tenth president on June 16, 1908, serving until his health deteriorated. Charles W. Lyons was succeeded him on July 9, 1909 following year. In his two terms, Gillespie separated St. Joseph's Preparatory School from the rest of the university in 1904, and the first varsity athletics programs were begun in 1909. Gillespie died on January 28, 1912 in St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore. He was distantly related to Saint Joseph's University's future president, Kevin Gillespie.

Alexander was supported by the minority Sadducees, while the Pharisees under Nasi Joshua ben Perachiah were briefly backed by the Seleucid Empire. Background The civil war began after a decade of expansionist military campaigns by Alexander, whose dual role as both King of Judea and High Priest of the Jewish Temple resulted in a dereliction of his religious responsibilities in Jerusalem, which became the root of criticism by the Pharisees. After suffering a defeat by the Arab Nabateans in the Battle of Gadara in 93 BC, Alexander returned to Jerusalem to officiate the festival of Sukkot. He demonstrated his displeasure against the Pharisees by refusing to perform the water libation ceremony properly: instead of pouring it on the altar, he poured it on his feet. The crowd responded with shock at his mockery and showed their displeasure by pelting him with etrogim (citrons). Outraged, he ordered soldiers to kill those who insulted him, which lead to the massacre of six thousand people in the Temple courtyard. With further frustration, Alexander had wooden barriers built around the temple and the court with the sacrificial altar, to which only priests had access. This incident during the Feast of Tabernacles was a major factor leading up to the Judean Civil War by igniting popular opposition against Alexander. War After Alexander succeeded early in the war, the rebels relocated to Sepphoris, in the heavily pro-Pharisee region of Galilee, and appealed for Seleucid assistance. Judean insurgents joined forces with Demetrius III Eucaerus to fight against Alexander. Alexander had gathered six thousand, two hundred mercenaries and twenty thousand Jews for battle as Demetrius had forty thousand soldiers and three thousand horses. There were attempts from both sides to persuade each other to abandon positions but were unsuccessful. The Seleucid forces defeated Alexander at Shechem, and all of Alexander's mercenaries were killed in battle. This defeat forced Alexander to take refuge in the mountains. In sympathy towards Alexander, six thousand Judean rebels ultimately returned to him. In fear of this news, Demetrius withdrew. Nevertheless, war between Alexander and the rebels who returned to him continued. They fought until Alexander achieved victory. Most of the rebels died in battle, while the remaining rebels fled to the city of Bethoma until they were defeated. Aftermath Alexander brought the surviving rebels back to Jerusalem where he had eight hundred Jews, primarily Pharisees, crucified. Before their deaths, Alexander had the rebels' wives and children executed before their eyes as Alexander ate with his concubines. Alexander later returned the land he had seized from the Nabateans in order to have them end their support for the Jewish rebels. The remaining rebels, who numbered eight thousand, fled by night in fear of Alexander. However, Alexander's military victory failed to translate into a political one. In 87 BC, Alexander's queen, Salome Alexandra, was the sister of deputy Pharisee leader Simeon ben Shetach, and ordered Simeon's return from exile in Egypt. In a soft coup, Simeon and Alexandra forced Alexander to relinquish most of his power, and by 80 BC the Pharisees had retaken control of the Great Sanhedrin with Simeon as Nasi (literally \\"President,\\" but equivalent to modern \\"Prime Minister\\"), while the King was served mainly as head of the Judean army. Alexander Jannaeus died in 76 BC, making Salome Alexandra Queen Regnant of Judea, and assassinations of Sadducee leaders who had served in the civil war became common. These retributions would later contribute to the Hasmonean Civil War.

This college has been variously described as the first dental college in the United States, in the world, and in North America. Biography Baxley was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in June 1803. There, he was educated at St. Mary's College before beginning medical school at the University of Maryland, from which he received his M. D. in 1824. In 1826, he began working as an attending physician at the Baltimore General Dispensary, where he continued to work until 1829. From 1830 to 1831, he was the attending physician at the Maryland Penitentiary. He was named a demonstrator of anatomy at the University of Maryland in 1834, and replaced Eli Geddings as professor of anatomy and physiology at this institution in 1837. In 1839, Baxley worked with Chapin A. Harris, Horace H. Hayden, and Thomas E. Bond to found the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. For a year afterward, Baxley taught anatomy and physiology there. He served as professor of surgery at Washington University of Baltimore from 1842 to 1847, and he worked as a physician at the Baltimore Almshouse from 1849 to 1850. In 1850, he moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, where he became chair of anatomy at the Medical College of Ohio. He became chair of surgery there in 1852, and served as the government's inspector of hospitals in 1865. He lived in Europe from 1866 until returning to Baltimore in 1875. He died in Baltimore on March 13, 1876. In his will, he bequeathed $23,836.52 to the trustees of Johns Hopkins University for an endowed professorship. In 1901, Johns Hopkins used this money to establish the Baxley Professorship of Pathology, the first ever endowed chair in the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. It was first held by William Henry Welch.

She is the first black woman to win the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize at Sundance.  Early life  Chukwu was born in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. When she was just over a year old, her family moved to Oklahoma, and moved again to Fairbanks, Alaska when she was six. They visited Nigeria often. Growing up in Alaska, Chukwu was often the only person of color in her classes, and she struggled to fit in. Throughout her childhood she dealt with depression, which was exacerbated by limited wintertime daylight in Alaska. To cope, she read Maya Angelou and joined the weight-lifting club. Chukwu always wanted to make movies. In her teen years she carried around a journal that she would write down ideas for films and music videos. She often wrote stories about Nigerian-American girls reconnecting with loves or lost siblings. She received her bachelor's degree in English from DePauw University, where she joined Zeta Phi Beta. She then enrolled in film school at Temple University.  Career  Chukwu directed The Dance Lesson in 2010, about a young black girl who struggles to become a ballerina in an increasingly gentrified community. Her first feature film, Alaska-Land (2012), told the story of two estranged Nigerian-American brother and sister who eventually reunite in their hometown of Fairbanks, Alaska. The film was rejected from every festival and lab program she applied to. In 2013 she directed A Long Walk (2013), a short film about a child who is publicly ridiculed by his father. Clemency (2019) was written and directed by Chukwu. The death row drama stars Alfre Woodard as a prison warden coming to terms with the demands of her profession and Aldis Hodge as one of her inmates bound for execution. Her inspiration for the film came from the case of Troy Davis, a prisoner executed in 2011. She moved to Los Angeles in 2017 to shoot the film. She received the U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize at 2019 Sundance, the first black woman to do so. Chukwu is slated to direct A Taste Of Power, a film based on the memoir of Elaine Brown.

Location Newcastle West's main square, with Desmond Castle at centre. Desmond Hall and Castle are located on south of the main square in the western end of Newcastle West. History View of Desmond Castle Castle buildings overlooking the River Ara A castle was built in the 13th century by the FitzGerald Earls of Desmond. Local folklore also connects it with the Knights Templar, perhaps confusing them with their house at Askeaton. By 1298, the castle had curtain walls and defensive towers surrounding the complex, with thatched houses, cattle byres and fishponds in the centre. Newcastle West was sacked in 1302 and destroyed in 1315. The present structure dates to the 15th century, with the hall and chamber built on the site of the earlier structure, and used for banqueting and entertainment. In 1591, during the Desmond Rebellions, the castle was seized by the Crown and granted to Sir William Courtenay on condition that 80 English colonists be settled in the area as part of the Munster Plantation. James FitzThomas FitzGerald retook the castle in 1598 but lost it again the next year. It was regranted to Sir William's son Sir George Courtenay, 1st Baronet in 1639. In 1643, during the Irish Confederate Wars, the castle was besieged for four months, then taken by the Irish Catholic Confederation. They burned it and executed the garrison. The castle buildings were attacked by Oliver Cromwell’s forces in 1645, and further damage during the Williamite war in Ireland in the late 17th century. In the 17th and 18th century the castle was occupied by the Mahony family, while the Courtenay Earls of Devon lived in Courtenay Castle; much of what had survived of the Desmond Castle was demolished in the 18th century to make room for Courtenay Castle. The banqueting hall was restored in early 19th century, a replacement fireplace being found in Kilmallock. By the 19th century, the Earl of Devon's agent Charles Curling was living in Courtenay Castle, and the Curlings bought Desmond Castle in 1910. It was burned down on 8 August 1922 during the Irish Civil War. It was owned by the Curlings until the 1940s. Later, it was used as a Masonic hall and as a cinema. The site was taken into state care in 1989, and renovation began in 1990 under the auspices of the Office of Public Works.patrickcomerford.com/2017/09/the-castle-in-newcastle- west-that-has.html Castle A spacious medieval hall of two storeys, with a vaulted lower chamber and adjoining tower.

From Crema to Senigallia  The history of the Mastais, who were originally entrepreneurs and merchants, began in Lombardia, probably to Crema or Brescia,^ Francesco Dall'Ongaro, Giovanni Maria Mastai Papa Pio IX, Torino, Unione tipografico-editrice, 1861, p. 7; Il Cittadino di Brescia, 1º maggio 1878; Flavio Solazzi, Gabriela Solazzi e Antonio Maddamma, Giovanni Anastasi a Senigallia, 2006 librisenzacarta.it; Yves Chiron, Pio IX papa moderno, Napoli, Grafite, 2001; Angelo Mencucci, La genealogia della famiglia Mastai-Ferretti dal Mille ad oggi, Senigallia, Rotary Club, 1992. where its founder Francesco Mastai was born in 1520. Then Federico, who moved from Crema to Venice, married the young lady Santa, with whom he had two kids, Pompeo e Giovanni Mastai, giving birth to the dynasty. Then the family moved to Senigallia, where the Fiera Franca began to attract every kind of merchants.  Giovanni Maria I  Here Giovanni Maria Mastai married Caterina di Claudio Garimboldi, who brought in dowry some land and the fourteenth-century palace where they established in 1579, since then known as Mastai Palace. The wellness came with the ability of Mastai brothers in affairs making the family one of the most important Italian families and Giovanni even became a senator. Only nobles could accede to that charge. Unfortunately, Pompeo's branch soon came to an end. Between Giovanni and Caterina's eleven kids just six survived: Leonilde and Agnese, that entered in the convent, Porzia and Camilla, that married Beliardi and Fagnani, Andrea who became archpriest of the chapter and apostolic prothonotary, while Francesco continued the mimeage. He married Benedetta Bruni and had three children: Giovanni Battista, who entered the clergy, Agnese, that married Alessandro Mariotti from Fano and Giovanni Maria, who became a merchant.  Giovanni Maria Mastai II  Giovanni Maria Mastai II (1625-1688) entered, as well as his ancestors, in Senigallia municipal council, which at the time returned under the Papal State, and was gonfalonier several times. after the death of his wife, Eleonora Benedetti, he married on 9 September 1653 the countess Margherita Minerva Ferretti from Ancona in second marriage, marry into a line of high lineage. Six years later Margaret, after her brother's death on 12 December 1659, inherited the palace in Ancona, some property in Castelferretti and the title of count for her children. Since then, according to the testament, their descendants call themselves ‘Mastai Ferretti counts’. Of their children the firstborn Francesco Filippo (1647-1688) entered the clergy, becoming advisor of the Holy Office, while the fortunes of the family were managed by the other two sons: Antonio Maria Andrea (1656-1732) and Gerolamo (1659-1713). The first one who was commonly known as “Abbot Andrew”, remained unmarried, he became the head of the family and started living with his brother in Avito palace that he decorated to make it more suited to the increased wellness of the family. To do that he asked Giovanni Anastasi from Senigallia, a paint at the end of 1600 biblical scenes, to paint walls and woodworks. Gerolamo has been gonfalonier several times and married Felicita Maria de Rossi from Montaboldo, with whom he had nineteen kids. Among the survivors, five became monks and the others, except for the firstborn Giovanni Maria, who continued the line, entered the clergy. Pope Pio IX in a portrait of the 1871.  Giovanni Maria Mastai III  Giovanni Maria III, born in 1687 as Antonio Maria was sent by his father and uncle to Francesco Farnese Duke of Parma's court, where he was page for six years, obtaining the degree of count and the title of lord of the chamber. Giovanni married Maria Isabella daughter of Ercole Maria Ercolani, marquis of Fornovo and Rocca Lanzona, with whom he had six children and who died in 1738. After the death of his wife, Giovanni became a cleric and dedicated himself to the passing of the local history by copying manuscripts and by writing some himself. Among his children Margherita became a nun, Maria Benedetta married Guido Consalvi from Macerata, Anna Maria Tommasa married Francesco Boni who was, like her, noble origin Ercole had nine children woman Caterina Guglielmini Balleani, a noble from Jesi, continuing the lineage. Of Ercole's children Andrea became the bishop of Pesaro in 1806, Gabriele was canon in Senigallia and Paolino in Rome. The firstborn Gerolamo married Caterina Solazzi in 1780 and been gonfalonier multiple times and a member of the R. Cesareo Magistrato. His son Giovanni Maria will become pope Pio IX.  Habemus papam: Giovanni Maria Mastai IV  In 1792, the year of birth of the fourth Giovanni Maria, the Mastai family was judged \\"quite noble and wealthy for those countries\\". This is how the Democrat Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina summarized its history in 1861: The Mastai family was aggressive and always active in civil discord; ready for espionage if there were opportunities. The Mastai family began to have great importance in the city. The marriage of Giovanni Maria Mastai with a girl from the Ferretti family from Ancona was added to this, having a great heritage. So the Mastai- Ferretti family rose in the province.Ferdinando Petruccelli della Gattina, Storia arcana del pontificato di Leone XII, Gregorio XVI e Pio IX, Milano, Francesco Colombo, 1861, pp. 138-139. The social ascent had not stopped, since the peak of fame came for the Mastai-Ferretti thanks to the cadet branch that distinguished itself in the ecclesiastical sphere. Even in this sector, many Mastai had already obtained titles and awards, much so that the fourth Giovanni Maria could count 3 uncles \\"Monsignors\\", including the bishop of Pesaro. Appointed priest in 1819, in 1827 he became archbishop of Spoleto, to which he added, after 5 years, the title of bishop of Imola and in 1840 the purple cardinal. The conclave of 1846 acclaimed him pope with the name of Pius IX and his pontificate was among the longest in the history of the Catholic Church. The mentioned \\"progressive\\" tendencies were not lacking in the family of the Counts Mastai-Ferretti even in the nineteenth century. Pius IX himself, despite his controversial judgment on his figure, was often referred to as a \\"liberal\\" pope.Carlo Belviglieri, Storia d'Italia dal 1804 al 1866. Vol. 24-29. Milano, Corona e Caimi, 1867, p. 278. On 3 September 2000, Giovanni Maria Mastai-Ferretti was proclaimed blessed by Pope John Paul II.

Incorporated by Joseph L. Hall in 1867, the Hall’s Safe & Lock Co. of Cincinnati, Ohio quickly grew to become the largestIndustrial Monthly: A Practical Journal for Manufacturers, Mechanics, Builders, Inventors, Engineers, Architects, with a Record of Railway Progress, Volumes 1-2 safe and vault manufacturer in the world. By 1892 it was responsible for “one-half the entire output of fire proof and burglar proof safes and vaults in the United States” and had offices throughout the United States and much of the rest of the world.  History  = Early years (1846–1866) = Joseph L. Hall cycled through a number of business partners and company names in the earliest years prior to incorporating and establishing Hall’s Safe & Lock Co. E. & J. L. Hall (1846–1850), E. Hall & Co. (1850–1851) : Joseph L. Hall first began in business with his father Edward H. Hall in a small and largely inconsequential way in Pittsburgh, PA in 1846 before moving the business to Cincinnati in 1848. Hall & Dodds (1852–1854), Hall, Dodds, & Co (1854–1856): William B. Dodds bought Edward Hall’s interest and partnered with Joseph L. Hall in 1851 to form the firm Hall & Dodds. They employed 15 people and produced two safes per week. Hall & Carroll (1856–1858), Hall, Carroll, & Co. (1858–1862): William Carroll and Charles Carroll partnered with Joseph L. Hall under the name Hall, Carroll & Co. Around 1862 the factory was moved to the southwest corner of Pearl and Plum streets in Cincinnati, Ohio where it would remain and grow. Joseph L. Hall & Co. (1862–1867): During the American Civil War demand for safes waned. As always, Joseph L. Hall adapted to the times and took a government contract to alter and rifle five thousand Austrian muskets. Having no machinery or experience he managed to deliver in the requisite thirty days. This success would lead to other government contracts during those years. Hall's Safe & Lock Co. 1867–1892: In 1867, Joseph L. Hall incorporated the Hall’s Safe & Lock Co. and become its President and Treasurer, O.Y. Cone became Vice President, and J.B. Marling became Secretary. = Laying the foundation (1867–1870) = At this time the factory was only \\"100 feet square and two stories high\\"Records and Briefs of the United States Supreme Court, Volume 208 and in 1868, Joseph L. Hall’s eldest son Edward C. Hall, Sr. would enter full time employment in the firm as a clerk. One of the firms earliest employees was Henry Gross and in 1869 he was granted a patent for a combination lock that would become known as the Hall Premier. This well- positioned Hall for competition against the leading lock manufacturers of the time Yale & Town Mfg. Co. and Sargent & Greenleaf. And he was up to the task as seen in a series of correspondence and news articles between Hall's and Sargent in regards to a lock-picking challenge instigated by James Sargent in 1870. = Company expansions (1871–1880) = Following the great Chicago fires of October 1871, Hall’s safes were the only ones “proven to be secure”, protecting their contents inside through fires that lasted for as much as ten days. Hundreds of customer testimonials surfaced which Hall would use to his advantage in advertisements far and wide. As a result, the company began to grow immensely in both reputation and size and was known to be four times the capacity of similar factories Cincinnati past and present, or, Its industrial history as exhibited in the life-labors of its leading men. By 1872 the firm had grown to 460 employees and produced between 20-25 safes per day.Whig and tribune. 3/2/1872 And as of 1874, twenty percent of new banks in the U.S. were using Hall’s safes and two-thirds of bankers in Chicago were using Hall’s Safes.Chicago Tribune March 11, 1874Cut of Burglar Room. Hall's Safe & Lock Co. Factory circa 1878 In 1874, Joseph L. Hall's third son, William H. Hall, would begin working for the firm in the Lock Department. By 1878 he would be in charge of the shipping department. Due to increasing litigation surrounding the safe and lock industry, Hall hired Milton Dalton in 1873 \\"to pursue what must be one of the boldest and broadest acts of corporate espionage ever.\\"American Genius: Nineteenth Century Bank Locks and Time Locks He set out to interview every active safe maker in the United States and Europe and managed to gather evidence detailing the development and progress of the industry in detail. The evidence in this book would help to prove that Hall held a patent for the use of conical bolts in safe manufacture that pre-dated safe maker MacNeale & Urban as detailed in a court case that began in 1875 and was decided in Hall's favor in 1883. Hall's Safe & Lock Safe - Mercantile Building, Cincinnati, Ohio According to President Ulysses S. Grant's papers, in 1875, Joseph L. Hall was in correspondence to acquire the President’s farm in St. Louis as a possible new location for the factory. Though these talks bore no fruit and the seriousness of Joseph L. Hall’s true interest in moving the factory is in doubt.The Papers of Ulysses S. Grant In 1875 Hall’s Safe & Lock Co. entered the nascent time lock business. = Controlling the industry (1880–1889) = In 1880, Joseph L. Hall created the Consolidated Time Lock company to house the time lock portion of his business. That same year the Berkshire Savings bank was sued by Yale for using a Consolidated time lock which Yale claimed infringed on its patent. In an unprecedented move at the time, Joseph L. Hall, knowing that Consolidated was the \\"real party in interest\\", petitioned the court to have Consolidated substituted as the defendant in the case. The case would eventually end up in the Supreme Court. In 1883 rumors again circulated that Hall’s factory was going to move from Cincinnati. Joseph L. Hall dismissed these rumors stating that he never intended to move but always found the press about them to be favorable advertisement.The Daily City News Jan 25, 1883 The Hall's Safe & Lock Co. factory continued to grow to over 8 acres. It employed up to 1,365 people and produced 65 safes per day. Every month it consumed 800,000 pounds of iron and 450,000 pounds of steel.Chicago First Half Century Hall's Safe & Lock Co Vault Door - Milwaukee circa 1886 = Final years (1889–1892) = In March of 1889 Joseph L. Hall died from a heart attack at his home in Walnut Hills at the age of 66. His safe company was at its peak and his legal battle with Sargent and Yale would not be resolved by the Supreme Court until later that year – and it would be resolved in his favor, albeit posthumously. Joseph L. Hall's eldest son Edward C. Hall, Sr. took over as President and though the company continued to grow, the family looked to sell the business. In 1892 they would accomplish that goal through the formation and merging of 5 firms to form the Herring-Hall-Marvin Company.  Legacy  * Herring-Hall-Marvin Co. * The Hall's Safe Co.

It was built as a high altar for the collegiate church in Herrenberg in the state of Württemberg, now part of southwest Germany. Today the altarpiece, which has only survived in part, is in the possession of the Stuttgart State Gallery.  History  Copy of the altarpiece in the collegiate church in Herrenberg – with wings folded The altarpiece bears a date of 1519. The eight panel images were painted by artist, Jerg Ratgeb (c. 1480–1526) who was executed during the German Peasants' War. The carved shrine, the front of the predella and the decorated carvings above the altarpiece have been lost. Ratgeb's idiosyncratic and expressive style of painting was, for a long time, little appreciated and it has only recently been appropriately recognized. The altarpiece in Herrenberg was only in place for a relatively short time. After the Reformation was introduced to the town in 1534, the first Lutheran pastor in Herrenberg had it dismantled in 1537. In 1548, at the time of the Augsburg Interim, Spanish troops had the altar rebuilt. After 1552, it was simply suspended from the ceiling for a few centuries. In 1891, the town council sold the altarpiece to the \\"State Collection of National Antiquities\\" in Stuttgart \\"in view of its, in places, unattractive images\\". The surviving elements have been in the Stuttgart State Gallery since 1924. A copy may be seen in the collegiate church in Herrenberg. The Herrenbilder Altar is a winged altarpiece, the front of which has two outer wings (A) that can be opened out to the left and right and two inner wings (I) that can also be opened.

The University of Iowa started to admit African American students in the 1870s, but they were rare before the 1910s. The university constructed dormitories in the 1910s, but they did not allow African Americans to live in them until 1946. Completed in 1914 for Charles and Dorothy Alberts, this house was Iowa City's first rooming house that was built for black tenants and owned by black landlords. Charles Alberts was a stonemason and he operated a cement block manufacturing business. He might have built the house himself. The first black university student started to reside here in 1920. The building was acquired by local attorney Edward F. Rate, who was white, in the 1920s and he continued to rent to African Americans. From c. 1928 to c. 1932 the house was known as the Williams Hotel after its proprietor James Williams, who also owned a car wash. Elizabeth “Bettye” Tate and Junious “Bud” Tate bought the house in 1940. Bud operated a janitorial service, and Bettye had operated a rooming house for black male students in their previous home at East Prentiss Street. She later spent 22 years working at the University of Iowa's cardiovascular laboratory. After the Tate's bought this 12-room house they changed the name to the Tate Arms and housed up to 20 male students a year. Bettye was known for her disciplined residence and did not permit liquor, women in the bedrooms, and tenants were expected to make their beds. The Tate Arms continued as a black student boarding house until 1961 when the Tates divorced. It continued to house students after this time, but they were not necessarily black. Housing discrimination in Iowa City continued until the Fair Housing Amendment to the Iowa Civil Rights Act was passed in 1967. Prior to that there was no history of city ordinances requiring racial segregation in housing, it was just a fact. In 1979 Bettye Tate sold the building, which had been vacant since 1970, and it was slated for demolition several times until 2014 when it was designated an Iowa City Historic Landmark.

After working as a clerk during his young adult life, Martin immigrated to Philadelphia and started studying English. He married fellow Belgian immigrant Fannie Gillon there in 1853; the couple had their first child in 1855 or 1856. The family moved to Red River, Wisconsin in 1859 and took up residence there.

Martin was among the first Belgian-Americans from northeastern Wisconsin to make it to the Assembly; the group also included Joseph Wery, Benjamin Fontaine, John B. Eugene and Grégoire Dupont. Martin moved on from elected positions to become a government assessor in 1867, something that tied in well with Martin's previous experience as a prominent real estate dealer in northeastern Wisconsin. 1870 was a pivotal year in Martin's life; his wife had a second child but then perished along with both children later in the year.

Description Lineodini comprise medium-sized moths, mostly with moderately broad wings, whereas in the slender, long-legged Atomopteryx and Lineodes, the wings are narrow and almost pterophorid-like. Females exhibit only one frenular bristle on the hind wing base, with the exception of Rhectosemia, where two frenular bristles are present. The sacci tympani of the tympanal organ are ventrally open. In the male genitalia, the valvae are of variable shape, from very slender to relatively broad and triangular with a broad valva base or paddle-shaped with a narrow valva base. The valva apex is rounded to somewhat acute. The costa is straight to concave, as in other non-euspilomeline species. The fibula is variable in shape, being either slender and emerging from the costa base or shorter and emerging more from the centre of the valva; in Euleucinodes and Proleucinodes, the fibula is absent. The valva sacculus is usually simple, whereas in Leucinodes there is a distal sacculus process that is in close association with the fibula. The posterior phallus is simple and unmodified or with sclerotized appendages. In the female genitalia, the ductus bursae is normally unsclerotized – a synapomorphy of Lineodini. However, in Leucinodes and Neoleucinodes the posterior ductus bursae, the colliculum and the antrum are often partially sclerotized often have a thickened mesocuticle. The corpus bursae is membranous, but at least Rhectosemia antofagastalis and R. striata exhibit a small sclerotized signum. Leucinodes cordalis, adult female Leucinodes orbonalis caterpillar feeding inside an eggplant fruit Neoleucinodes elegantalis, adult with abdomen bent over the head Food plants As far as known, Lineodini feed exclusively on Solanaceae plants like tomato, eggplant, potato, Capsicum (pepper), Physalis and numerous others. The caterpillars tie leaves together or bore in the plant, especially in fruits, by which they diminish or ruin the marketable value of the fruits. Distribution Except for the Old World Leucinodes, all Lineodini have a Neotropical to temperate Nearctic distribution. Species feeding on globally traded Solanaceae fruits are frequently transported by accident through fruits occupied by larvae. In Europe, the Asian Leucinodes orbonalis as well as the Afrotropical L. africensis, L. pseudorbonalis and L. rimavallis are frequently intercepted at ports of entry. Systematics The tribe Lineodini was proposed in 1956 by Hans-Georg Amsel in his \\"Microlepidoptera Venezolana\\" monography. He erected the tribe for the genus Lineodes for its outstanding habitus, genitalia and wing venation, and further included Stenoptycha in the group, which is now considered a synonym of Atomopteryx. The proposed tribe did not gain much acceptance and was considered a synonym of Pyraustinae, and later of Spilomelinae, a split-off of Pyraustinae., mostly due to a lack of a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary relationships among the very species-rich Spilomelinae. Lineodini in its current circumscription was mentioned by Hayden et al. (2013) as \\"Leucinodes genus group\\", and was reinstated as tribe in 2019. Capps (1948) split off three Neotropical genera from the Old World Leucinodes: Euleucinodes, Neoleucinodes and Proleucinodes. Seven genera, altogether comprising 94 species, are currently placed in Lineodini: *Atomopteryx Walsingham, 1891 (synonyms Zellerina Torre & Callejas, 1958, Stenoptycha Zeller, 1863) *Euleucinodes Capps, 1948 *Leucinodes Guenée, 1854 (synonyms Hyperanalyta Strand, 1918, Sceliodes Guenée, 1854; misspelling Leuctinodes South, 1897) *Lineodes Guenée, 1854 (synonyms Ciraphorus Dyar, 1910, Scoptonoma Zeller, 1873) *Neoleucinodes Capps, 1948 *Proleucinodes Capps, 1948 *Rhectosemia Lederer, 1863 (misspelling Rhectosomia Lederer, 1863) References Spilomelinae Lepidoptera tribes ","title":"Lineodini"},{"id":"62583597","text":"Lesley Fennell is an Irish Postwar and Contemporary portrait artist.

Landry in Landry, Roque-Albelo & Hayden, 2011 *Conchylodes Guenée, 1854 (synonyms Ledereria Snellen, 1873, Nonazochis Amsel, 1956) *Deana Butler, 1879 (= Adena Walker, 1863, Nesarcha Meyrick, 1884) *Ercta Walker, 1859 (= Erota Walker, 1859) *Mnesictena Meyrick, 1884 *Sisyracera Möschler, 1890 *Tanaophysa Warren, 1892 *Udea Guenée in Duponchel, 1845 (synonyms Melanomecyna Butler, 1883, Notophytis Meyrick, 1932, Protaulacistis Meyrick, 1899, Protocolletis Meyrick, 1888, Stantira Walker, 1863) - type genus of the tribe *Udeoides Maes, 2006 The name Udeini was proposed by Patrice Leraut in 1997 in Pyraustinae. However, the proposed name was not accompanied by a description to differentiate the taxon, and therefore lacking a requirement issued by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature in their article 13.1 for names published after 1930. Description The tribe is circumscribed by three synapomorphies: In the male genitalia, the depth of the central vertical split of the juxta is 10-60% of the juxta length. In the female genitalia, the colliculum, i.e. the posteriormost section of the ductus bursae, situated between the antrum and the attachment of the ductus seminalis, is strongly sclerotised. Furthermore, the corpus bursae usually bears an elongate rhombical, an ovate or an \\"ediacaroid\\" signum, named after the Ediacaran biota from the Neoproterozoic Era, which exhibit body shapes similar to the shape of the signum in Udeini. Udeini is one of the four so-called non-euspilomeline tribes, which share several plesiomorphic morphological characters with the sister group of Spilomelinae, the Pyraustinae. For example, female imagines of some species show a reduction of the frenular bristles in the wing coupling mechanism to only one bristle, e.g. in the Udea alpinalis and U. itysalis species groups (sensu ). The uncus shape in the male genitalia is very diverse, ranging from unicapitate in the Udea genus group (comprising Deana, Mnesictena, Tanaophysa, Udea and Udeoides) to conical in Conchylodes, reduced to a triangle in Sisyracera and Ercta, or even reduced to a slim transverse band over the tegumen in the monotypic genus Cheverella. The Conchylodes genus group is characterised by hair-like monofilament chaetae on the uncus of the male genitalia, as opposed to the thick bifid chaetae present in most other Spilomelinae. The valva costa is slightly concave, with the ventral sacculus edge being parallel to the costa (which is inflated in Cheverella), and apical of the sacculus, the valva tapers towards a rounded apex. The female genitalia exhibit a strongly sclerotized antrum except for Cheverella, where it is weakly sclerotized. A membraneous appendix bursae is present in Conchylodes, Ercta and Sisyracera, which is attached to the anterior end of the corpus bursae in the former two genera, and to the posterior end in the latter genus. In all Udea species groups except the Udea ferrugalis group, an accessory signum is present in the conjunction of ductus bursae and corpus bursae. Food plants Species of Udeini feed on a broad spectrum of food plants. Some species like Udea rubigalis are highly polyphagous, feeding on plants from a wide variety of plant families. The caterpillars of Mnesictena feed on Muehlenbeckia (Polygonaceae), Urtica and Australina (Urticaceae). Conchylodes larvae have been recorded from Annonaceae, Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, Cordiaceae, Malvaceae and Platanaceae, and the caterpillars of Sisyracera and Cheverella are recorded from Boraginaceae. Distribution Several genera are geographically confined, e.g. Deana and Mnesictena to New Zealand, Udeoides to the Afrotropical realm and Sisyracera to the Neotropical realm. Udea on the other hand, with its 214 species, is found on every continent except Antarctica, and members of the Udea ferrugalis species group are especially abundant on oceanic islands.

Description Niphopyralis chionesis, adult Pseudebulea fentoni, adult male Adult Wurthiini are small to medium-sized moths with wing spans of normally 20 to over 30 mm, whereas adults of Niphopyralis are usually somewhat smaller, with wingspans of 12 to 22 mm, and the males being smaller than the females. In the male genitalia, the uncus consists of a single head bearing stiff chaetae, or it is bicapitate (Niphopyralis). The tegumen-vinculum complex is more or less elongate rounded. The valvae are slender and tapering towards the apex, with the costa weakly to strongly concave (e.g. in Apilocrocis novateutonialis; see ). The juxta is usually deeply split or divided into two juxta arms (a synapomorphy of the tribe). The fibula is broad triangular and ventrally directed. On its mesal side, the valva sacculus is produced as a strongly sclerotised arm that usually ends dorsally in a broad, spinulose tip or a needleshaped projection, and in Aristebulea, Mimetebulea and Pseudebulea, the mediodorsal sacculus bears a medially directed process. The male genitalia of Niphopyralis are highly derived. The female genitalia exhibit a strongly sclerotised lamella antevaginalis and usually a short, membraneous ductus dursae (strongly sclerotised in Niphopyralis). The signum in the corpus bursae is either absent (Mimetebulea, Niphopyralis) or present as a small to large rounded to short transverse sclerotisation. The larvae and pupae of Wurthiini are only known for Niphopyralis; see there for a morphological description. Food plants Very little is known about the food plants of Wurthiini. The caterpillars of Apilocrocis glaucosia feed on Celtis iguanaea (Cannabaceae). The larvae of Niphopyralis are myrmecophilous brood parasites in nests of nest-weaving ants of the genera Oecophylla and Polyrhachis, where they feed on their hosts' eggs, larvae and pupae. Distribution The genera Apilocrocis and Diaphantania are found in the Americas, with the latter one confined to the Antilles, whereas the other four genera are distributed in the Oriental and the Australasian realm. Systematics Wurthiini currently contains six genera, altogether comprising 29 species: *Apilocrocis Amsel, 1956 *Aristebulea Munroe & Mutuura, 1968 *Diaphantania Möschler, 1890 (synonym Diaphantia Wolcott, 1924) *Mimetebulea Munroe & Mutuura, 1968 *Niphopyralis Hampson, 1893 (synonym Wurthia Roepke, 1916, the type genus of Wurthiini) *Pseudebulea Butler, 1881 Wurthiini was erected by Walter Karl Johann Roepke in 1916 as subfamily Wurthiinae in Arctiidae (now Arctiinae), with Wurthia (a synonym of Niphopyralis) as its type genus. The placement of Niphopyralis, and with this the status of Wurthiini, was long unclear due to its unusual Limacodidae-like habitus and the lack of a proboscis. In 1923, the back then still valid genus Wurthia was transferred to Schoenobiinae, where also Niphopyralis had been described in 1893 by George Hampson. In 1981, Niphopyralis was transferred to Pyraustinae, while Wurthia remained in Schoenobiinae. It was not until 1996 that Wurthia was recognized as synonym of Niphopyralis. Regier et al. (2012) found Niphopyralis to be an ingroup of Spilomelinae, and they consequently synonymised the name Wurthiinae with Spilomelinae. Eventually, in 2019 the name Wurthiini was re-erected as tribe in its current form within Spilomelinae.

Biography He was born to one of the leading families of English Jewry at the time, which held many official positions until the final expulsion in 1290. His family had its origin in the Rhineland, unlike most English Jews whose family origin was in France. His father was Moses of London. His brother was Berechiah de Nicole.

In 1251 he wrote his commentary to the Mishnah, and then returned to London. For the next three decades he engaged in business, finance, and real estate in England. Many details of his business history are recorded, including dealings with the king and queen. In the Second Barons' War his family lost much property, but were physically unharmed and apparently managed to escape to Normandy. When the fighting ceased, they returned to England and resumed business. When legal restrictions were placed on the Jews in the 1270s, Eliyahu and his brothers were given an exemption from some of them. In addition to business, he also served as a doctor. He was known among Jews as a leading halachic authority, quoted under the name R\\"M meLondrish or HaRav meLondrish in such works as that of Mordechai ben Hillel.

In the Overwatch League, Park signed with the Titans in their first year of existence. With the Titans, he reached the 2019 Grand Finals, where they fell to the San Francisco Shock. Kim received the first-ever OWL \\"Rookie of the Year\\" award in the 2019 regular season.  Professional career  = RunAway = Kim began his professional Overwatch career as one of the founding players of Korean team RunAway and played his first official match on October 26, 2016. He quickly made a name for himself as a talented Genji player in OGN's APEX Season 1. The team competed in all four seasons of the APEX tournament series and reached the finals twice – in Season 2 and Season 4. Although they failed to take the championship both times, Kim was named the APEX Season 4 Most Valuable Player. After the inception of the Overwatch League, the APEX series ended, and RunAway began to compete in the newly formed Overwatch Contenders (OWC) series.

Although he was best known for his talents playing the damage heroes like Genji, Kim spent the majority of his play time on the support hero Brigitte due to the prominent three support, three tank meta in the OWL throughout the first three stages of the season. Kim picked up a Stage 1 title and reached the Stage 2 finals with the team. After the introduction of the 2-2-2 role lock in Stage 4, in which teams were locked-in to playing two damage, two tank, and two support heroes, Kim returned to playing damage heroes and had the highest player impact rating, an official rating is a system used by Overwatch League statisticians, in the stage. In a 4–0 sweep over the Florida Mayhem, Kim amassed 27 Dragonblade kills on Genji to set an Overwatch League record for most Dragonblade kills per 10 minutes. For his excellent play throughout the season, Kim was selected for the 2019 All-Star Game, named an OWL Role Star for DPS, and named the 2019 OWL Rookie of the Year. The Titans reached the 2019 Grand Finals where they faced the San Francisco Shock; Kim went head-to-head against the OWL MVP Jay \\"sinatraa\\" Won throughout the match, but the Titans lost the match.

She first appears in 1793 in readily accessible records as the privateer cutter Rattler. The British Admiralty hired her and employed her as HM Hired armed cutter Rattler. During this time she was present at the largest naval battle of the French Revolutionary Wars. The Navy purchased her in 1796 for the Royal Navy and renamed her HMS Sparrow. She was sold for breaking up in 1805. Rattler Although records report that she was launched in 1780, she at no times appeared under that name in Lloyd's Register, suggesting that she may have been launched under another name. She first appeared in 1793 when Captain Robert Griggs acquired a letter of marque on 30 April, shortly after the outbreak of war with France. The Navy hired Rattler on 6 April 1793. Under the command of Lieutenant J.Wynne she was present at the battle of the Glorious First of June. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the NGSM with clasp \\"Glorious First of June\\" to all the surviving claimants from the action. Rattlers contract ended on 8 February 1796. HMS Sparrow The Admiralty purchased Rattler in 1796. There being a in service, it renamed the cutter Rattler Sparrow. The Navy commissioned Sparrow in July under Lieutenant John Cornet Pears. On 2 October he captured Coureur, Peter de Lang, master. Courier, Large, master, from Rotterdam, arrived at Plymouth the next day.Lloyd's List 7 October 1796, №2865, Ship arrivals and departure (SAD) data. In 1797 and Sparrow captured two French privateers, each of six guns: Resolu and Revanche. Various other sources give the date of capture of Resolue or Revanche (or Resource, as 30 June or 1 July, but by that time Tartar had been lost. Head money for the crews of the privateers was paid on 13 January 1838. On 1 April Tartar grounded on a sandbank off Puerto Plata, filled with water, and had to be abandoned. Sparrow and the prizes took off the crew. On 19 August 1797 the French privateer Rencontre, Captain Lenau, seized the American brig Harriot and put a prize crew on board. Two days later, Sparrow, Lieutenant Hugh Wylie, captured Harriot , and sent her for Cape Nicola Mole. The next day the French privateer Enfant Trouve, Captain Pierre Brard, captured Harriot and sent her into Port-de-Paix. The court at the Cape condemned vessel and cargo in prize on 3 September. The Court found that as Harriot had been in British hands for 26 hours, and as the British didn't respect the rights of neutrals, and as retaking Harriot had involved an hard fighting against the British, Harriot was a lawful prize. The loss to John Holmes, owner of the cargo, inclusive of the cost of insurance, was US$4,587.50. In 1799 Sparrow was still on the Jamaica station and still under Wylie's command. On 30 March a party of seamen and marines from stormed a five-gun battery overlooking a small bay about seven leagues northward of Cape Roxo, Puerto Rico. As the landing party destroyed the battery, boats from Trent captured a Spanish ship and schooner sheltering under the battery's guns. Their crews scuttled two other schooners in the bay. Sparrow was able to get into shallower water than Trent and so provided during the operation. British casualties were only three men wounded. During the period 26 June 1979 and 21 July, Sparrow captured a French schooner of four guns (pierced for 14). The schooner was sailing from Cape François to Europe with a cargo of coffee and cocoa. During the period 21 July and 27 October, Sparrow captured three prizes: *A Spanish Schooner from Porto Rico, supposedly bound for Jamaica with a cargo of cotton. Sparrow took her for carrying 2400 dollars not on her Bill of Lading. *The brig Nancy, under the American flag, from to Aux Cayes. Sparrow took Nancy as she was going into Jacmel. *A Dutch schooner from Anacoa to Mangirane. She was carrying provisions and \\"Russian Duck\\". (Russian duck is a canvas cloth made of fine white linen.) When Michael Fitton, captain of the schooner Ferret, tender to , cruised the Mona Passage in company with Sparrow, commanded by Mr. Whylie, the two accidentally separated for a few days. On rejoining, Fitton invited Whylie by signal to come to breakfast, and while waiting caught a large shark that was under the stern. In its stomach was found a packet of papers relating to an American brig Nancy. When Whylie came on board, he mentioned that he had detained an American brig called Nancy. Fitton then said that he had her papers. 'Papers?' answered Whylie; 'why, I sealed up her papers and sent them in with her.' 'Just so,' replied Fitton; 'those were her false papers; here are her real ones.' And so it proved. The papers were lodged in the Admiralty Court at Port Royal, and by them the brig was condemned. The shark's jaws were set up on shore, with the inscription, 'Lieut. Fitton recommends these jaws for a collar for neutrals to swear through.' The papers were preserved in the museum of the Royal United Service Institution. Between 27 October 1799 and 20 February 1800, Sparrow took four prizes: *French Schooner Lean: Sparrow took 2,200 dollars out of her and then scuttled her as she was of no value; *French Schooner Lean Pierre, carrying coffee: Sparrow took 2,100 dollars out of her *Spanish sloop carrying salt; and, *Spanish sloop Nelson, carrying tobacco, pork, mules, and 400 dollars. Between 9 March 1800 and 20 March, Sparrow captured a Spanish brig carrying mules and fustic. Fate Sparrow was broken up in 1805.

She was arrested and interned in three French-run camps before being helped to escape. Biography =Early to interwar years= Netter was born to Blanche Isaac and Mathieu Netter, an industrialist from the Alsace region of France whose business was processing bird down. Her mother died when she was 14. After gaining her higher certificate at school she followed secondary school studies for girls at the Sorbonne. She married Pierre Isaac Gompel in 1911 and the following year gave birth to her son, Didier Gompel-Netter. Her husband had poor health and was not sent to the front to fight in World War I; he was employed as a driver before being demobilised because of illness between 1915 and 1916. Netter worked as a military nurse until 1917, assigned to :fr:l'Hôpital Militaire Complémentaire de Meaux. In 1918, her husband left the family home. She divorced him the following year and, with her father's support, returned to studies, becoming an advocate in 1920. In 1923, Netter co-founded the Jewish Women's Union for Palestine with Suzanne Zadoc-Kahn, wife of doctor and chair of the Central Committee of Keren Hayesod, Léon Zadoc-Kahn; the Union later became the French section of the Women's International Zionist Organization; she was also active in other women's Jewish groups. Between the late 1920s and the onset of World War II, she travelled widely in Europe and North Africa promoting Zionism at conferences. From the 1920s in particular, she fought passionately for the right of women to work and vote [only realised in France 27 years after other major European nations]. She was involved in feminist groups such as la Ligue française pour le droit des femmes (French League for Women's Rights), the Société pour l’amélioration du sort de la femme et la revendication de ses droits (Society for the improvement of the lot of women and the assertion of their rights), which she chaired in 1932 in 1934, and other women's associations such as L'Union Féminine des carrières libérales et commerciales (Union of women in liberal and commercial careers)., the Soroptimist Club and L'Association française des femmes diplômées des universités (French association of women university graduates). Netter and other French feminists linked their goals to wider anti-colonial ones pursued in the international milieu of Paris, for example, in political and satirical pieces on race and gender for La Française, a feminist journal, and La Dépêche Africaine [The African Dispatch]. Netter was known amongst black Parisians before La Dépêche Africaine was first published. French-speaking Africans were – like French women – also unable to vote, despite their families' sacrifices for France in the war. In contrast to her feminist credentials, Netter was one of the advocates who successfully defended the :fr:Fédération Féminine Sportive de France against Violette Morris, a world-class French athlete, who was banned from competing or earning from her sports primarily because of her usual style of dress (wearing trousers). Netter was quoted as saying, \\"Women do not have the right to wear shorts in the street.\\" =World War II= In 1940, shortly after the defeat of France to the Nazis, Madeleine Fauconneau du Fresne – an activist for the Moral Re-Armament movement begun by Frank Buchman – was advised by a friend to engage the services of Netter after she was called to court to answer charges of defamation following an argument with a neighbour. The two became good friends and this led Netter to convert to Catholicism, but nonetheless she was banned from her advocacy in 1941 because of her Jewish background. For the same reason, she was arrested on 4 July 1942 by French police and a Gestapo agent and interned at :fr:Caserne des Tourelles. On 13 August, she was transferred to Drancy and finally, on 1 September, to Pithiviers. While she was in the Pithiviers hospital, due to severe dysentery, Fauconneau du Fresne was able to visit and pass on details of an escape plan arranged with Line Piguet, the wife of Dr.Robert Piguet, and with the help of a laundry worker there. While attending mass, Netter wore a friend's jacket and escaped with Henri Tessier, a market gardener, to stay awhile with the Tessier family in Pithiviers before staying with Tessier's friend, Joseph- Marie Cardin. Cardin's daughter, Josèphe-Marie Cardin Massé took Netter to her parents' home where she remained hidden. The Cardins provided money and false documents for her planned trip to the southern zone where she could join her brother, Léo. Madame Piguet – who also helped Netter's son, Didier – was arrested by the Gestapo after she was found to be hiding a jew. Fauconneau Du Fresne had been arrested for arranging Netter's escape and was interned for several months in Beaune-la-Rolande wearing a white Star of David marked \\"Friend of the Jews\\". When freed by the on 11 June by the préfet de Loiret (for lack of evidence), she joined Yvonne Netter and went to Toulouse with her, remaining with her brother until 1943. Her brother, his wife Antoinette and their children were intercepted and arrested on a journey from Revel to Toulouse. Fauconneau du Fresne entrusted Netter to friends in Vendée and returned to Paris, where Netter joined her again later. Netter was in hiding until Paris's liberation, but despite this was part of the Comet Line resistance group as a liaison officer from July to December 1943 and from June to August 1944. Her brother Leo's family were transported from Toulouse on 30 July 1944 by convoy No. 81; he and his son were moved to Buchenwald concentration camp and his wife and daughter to Ravensbrück concentration camp [some sources erroneously say Bergen-Belsen and Auschwitz respectively]. Antoinette was murdered in Ravensbrück, a fate shared by Line Piguet. Leo and his two children survived to return to France. =Post-War Period= After the liberation of France, Netter recommenced her advocacy from her base in Paris. She and Fauconneau du Fresne remained close for the rest of their lives. She died on 30 August 1985 in Paris, survived by her son. In 2018, Fauconneau du Fresne was given the title Righteous Among the Nations for saving Netter, a title also previously granted to the Tessier, Piguet and Cardin families for saving her and others. A commemorative plaque in Netter's honour is installed on the exterior of 3 Quai aux Fleurs, Paris 4e.

The tribe was erected by Richard Mally, James E. Hayden, Christoph Neinhuis, Bjarte H. Jordal and Matthias Nuss in 2019. Description Adult Trichaeini are characterised by a single synapomorphy in the male genitalia: a raised sclerotised ridge is present on the sacculus, running from the basal to the dorsodistal part. Further characteristics of Trichaeini are the weakly sclerotised, lens-shaped valvae, the strongly (in Trichaea and Archernis humilis) to weakly sclerotized fibula with simple hairs, and the scaly sacculus. In the female genitalia, the ductus bursae is broad, but narrowing at the posterior end, and the corpus bursae bears a slim longitudinal signum. In some Prophantis species, the anterior end of the signum is split into two anterolateral legs – a condition that is also found in Syngamia in the Nomophilini. Food plants The caterpillars of Trichaeini primarily feed on plants of the Rubiaceae family. The coffee berry moths Prophantis longicornalis, P. octoguttalis and P. smaragdina are considered pests on Coffea arabica, the Arabian coffee. They are known to also feed on the Rubiaceae plants Bertiera zaluzania, Gardenia, Ixora coccinea and Tricalysia, the Verbenaceae Duranta plumieri, and Triclisia in the Menispermaceae. Trichaea larvae feed on species of Psychotria, on Morinda panamensis and Margaritopsis microdon (all Rubiaceae), but were also recorded from Urticaceae and Celastraceae. Recently, Archernis humilis was discovered to feed on the skunk vine Paederia foetida. It was investigated as a potential biological control agent against this invasive plant species in North America, but was found to not be hostplant-specific enough for this purpose, as the caterpillars also feed on the North American endemic Paederia ciliata. Distribution The species of Archernis and Prophantis are distributed in the tropics and subtropics of Australia and the Old World, i.e., Africa and Asia. The species of the other three genera are found in the tropics and subtropics of the Americas. Systematics The tribe currently comprises 36 species in five genera: *Archernis Meyrick, 1886 *Prophantis Warren, 1896 *Sacculosia Amsel, 1956 *Trichaea Herrich-Schäffer, 1866 (= Acridura Butler, 1875, Phryctena Oberthür, 1881) *Zenamorpha Amsel, 1956 The larval feeding on Rubiaceae is shared with the tribe Nomophilini, which might be the sister group of Trichaeini.

Farmer was born February 9, 1798 in Halfmoon, New York. In 1821 he taught map drawing in schools in Albany, New York. Later that year he was recruited to Michigan by the Regents of the University of Michigan to serve as principal of a Lancastrian school in Detroit. In 1824 he was employed by surveyor and land speculator Orange Risdon to work with him on a detailed map of Michigan to be completed that year. Anticipating a flood of immigrants from the east when the Erie Canal was scheduled to open the following year, Farmer decided to go into the map trade himself, producing his own map of Michigan in 1825. Farmer found the delay and cost of sending his manuscripts east to be engraved in copper for printing time-consuming and expensive. So he taught himself the skill of engraving copper plates, and beginning in 1835 engraved his own plates. Over the following 24 years Farmer produced dozens of maps of Michigan, Wisconsin, and several cities. He also continuously revised and released new editions of his Michigan maps. The anticipated flood of settlers did arrive, and updated detailed maps showing the public land survey were popular with new arrivals as they contained extraordinary detail of every surveyed township and section. One of his most notable works was Map of the State of Michigan and the Surrounding Country, first issued in 1844 and revised eleven times before his death. His wife, Roxanne Farmer, and son Silas Farmer later issued additional revisions until 1874. All editions after the 3rd were labeled as the \\"23rd edition,\\" though the year often varied in the cartouche, which caused some confusion among map collectors and historians. In 1826 Farmer married Roxanne Hamilton, also of Halfmoon, NY, and had three children, Silas, John, and Esther. Upon Farmer's death on March 24, 1859, Roxanne took over the business as produced several maps, then was succeeded by their oldest son Silas.

Frost worked as a lawyer on matters relating to the mining industry, which was a major employer in Southern Colorado prior to the Great Depression. Colorado Coalfield War On 26 October 1913, Governor of Colorado Elias M. Ammons ordered the Colorado National Guard to deploy to the southern coalfields near Trinidad and Walsenburg in response to violence associated with the United Mine Workers of America strike against the Colorado Fuel and Iron company that had begun on 23 September. Captain Frost led Company A in the strike zone, one of several units deployed. Like other units of the National Guard in the strike zone, Company A began incorporating CF&I; mine guards into its ranks. Company A would remain deployed through the departure of the congressional committee visit and publication of the military report on the strike zone, returning home on 17 April 1914. However, the company's first sergeant and two lieutenants remained and participated in the Ludlow Massacre, where roughly 20 strikers and their families were killed. Cpt.

Chhotelal Srivastava was most famous for organizing the Kandel Nehar Satyagraha, a rebellion against the British Raj. Leading the peasants, they demonstrated against the tyranny of the British Raj. This was the first time a demonstration of such nature was organized against English imperialism. In the year 1921, he established the Khadi Production Center for the Swadeshi movement. A Jungle Satyagraha was held in Sihawa in 1922 under the leadership of Shyam Lal Som, where Babu Chotelal Srivastava gave full support. When the Jungle Satyagraha was decided to be in Bandwagon near Rudri in 1930, Babu Sahib played an active role in it. He was then arrested and sent to jail where he was tortured, bringing additional attention to the Satyagrahis. This drew Mahatma Gandhi to join the independence movement. In 1933, Gandhi, on his second visit to Chhattisgarh, went to Tamarind. There, he praised the leadership of Babu Chhote Lal. In the year 1937, Srivastava was elected the President of Dhamtari Municipality Corporation. Babu Sahib also had an active role in the Quit India Movement of 1942. Babu Chotelal Srivastava died on 18 July 1976 in Kandel, an area of great pilgrimage of the Indian independence movement.

They were caused by natural disasters in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and Henan. At the same time, the She-An Rebellion and Jurchen invasions forced the Ming government to cut funding for the postal service, which resulted in the mass unemployment of men in the provinces hit hard by natural disasters. Unable to cope with three major crises at the same time, the Ming dynasty collapsed in 1644. Origin In 1618, the Jurchens under Nurhaci started attacking the Ming dynasty in the northeast region of the empire. By 1627, the war with the Jurchens as well as the eruption of the She-An Rebellion in 1621 had drained Ming treasuries to dangerously low levels, with just seven million taels left in the Taicang Vault. The Ming realm was also suffering from natural disasters in Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan. In 1627 widespread drought in Shaanxi resulted in mass starvation as harvests failed and people turned to cannibalism. Natural disasters in Shaanxi were not unusual but in the last 60 years of the Ming, they were especially bad, and there was not a single year in which Shaanxi did not experience a natural disaster. The entire region was a natural disaster zone. Shanxi too suffered from windstorms, earthquakes, and famines. In the south, Henan also experienced starvation and it was said that \\"grains of rice became as precious as pearls.\\" The Chongzhen Emperor's petty and mercurial ways exacerbated the situation by constantly switching grand secretaries, which prevented a coherent government response from coalescing. Chongzhen's reign alone saw around 50 grand secretaries appointed to the post, representing two thirds of all holders of that post throughout the entire Ming dynasty. To prevent further depletion of the imperial treasury, Chongzhen cut funding for the Ming postal service, which saw the mass unemployment of large numbers of men from the central and northern provinces around the Yellow River region. This in turn contributed to the overall deterioration of government control and the formation of bandit groups, which became endemic in the last decades of the Ming. Rebellion In the spring of 1628, Wang Jiayin started a revolt in Shaanxi with some 6,000 followers, one of whom was Zhang Xianzhong, who would go on to depopulate Sichuan in the future. The rebellion posed no threat to the Ming army, but due to the rugged mountain terrain of Shaanxi, the Ming pacification army of 17,000 was unable to effectively root out the rebels. Another bandit leader Gao Yingxiang rose up in revolt and joined Wang Jiayin soon after. In early 1629 the veteran anti-rebel leader Yang He was called into service and made Supreme Commander of the Three Border Regions. What he found was that situations were even more dire than they appeared. Salaries for soldiers of Shaanxi were three years in arrears, and their own soldiers were deserting to join the rebels. Yang was unable to suppress Wang Jiayin's rebels, who took several isolated fortresses as late as 1630. Yang's policy of amnesty for surrendered peasants was generally ineffective. Once surrendered, the peasants would go back to their homes and join other rebel bands. Despite Ming victories in battle, peasant rebellions would remain a major problem for the remainder of the Ming dynasty. Yang He was eventually impeached and arrested for ineffectiveness. He was replaced with Hong Chengchou who would later defect to the Qing dynasty. His subordinates, in particular the brothers Cao Wenzhao and Cao Bianjiao were reckless. Soldiers slaughtered rebels as well as civilians alike to turn in heads for rewards. At one point an official even submitted female heads, claiming they were bandits. He was demoted. It was estimated that by 1631 there were roughly 200,000 rebels operating in 36 rebel groups. =Zhang Xianzhong= Zhang Xianzhong was a native of Yan'an, Shaanxi. He was said to be strong, valiant, but also hairy and had a lust for killing. In his official biography, it is said that \\"if a single day went by and he did not kill someone, then he was really unhappy.\\" When his family disowned him for getting into repeated fights with his peers, he joined the army, which sentenced him to death for breaking military law. An officer named Chen Hongfan spared him due to being impressed by his valiance. Zhang Xianzhong then joined the rebellion and followed Ma Shouying, who made him a petty officer and named him the \\"Yellow Tiger\\". Eventually hardship struck in the winter of 1631 and Zhang was forced to surrender with Luo Rucai, the first of several times he would do so out of expedience. =Li Zicheng= Li Zicheng was the second son of Li Shouzhong and hailed from Mizhi, Shaanxi. Li showed an aptitude for horse archery at an early age but was forced to become a shepherd at the age of ten due to poverty. He became an orphan when his mother died three years later. Li joined the army at the age of 16 but later left and entered the postal service in 1626. At some point Li became an outlaw for killing a man he found in bed with his wife after returning from an extended business trip. He was arrested and jailed until his nephew Li Guo freed him, and together they fled the area. In Gansu, Li Zicheng joined the army again and became a squad commander of 50 men. After taking part in the suppression of the rebel Gao Yingxiang, Li himself became a rebel due to charges of stealing rations. =Rebel movements= By 1633, the rebels had spread into Huguang, Sichuan, Shanxi. Chen Qiyu was made Supreme Commander of Shaanxi, Shanxi, Henan, Huguang, and Sichuan. He drove out Zhang Xianzhong and Luo Rucai from Sichuan. The rebels in Henan were driven west until they were bottled up in the southwestern corner of Henan in Chexiang Gorge. Heavy rains battered the rebels for 40 days. After weeks of deprivation, 13,000 rebels, including Li Zicheng, surrendered to Chen Qiyu. They were returned to their homes under supervision, but when 36 rebels were killed and their heads hung up on the city walls, a full-scale revolt broke out again. Li Zicheng besieged Longzhou but was driven away by Zuo Guangxian. Despite the inability of the rebels to take well- defended cities, the Ming army was also unable to decisively defeat them, so the Ming started building blockhouses in towns to fortify the countryside. In 1635, a meeting between major rebel groups took place at Rongyang in Central Henan. Zhang Xianzhong and Gao Yingxiang were tasked with taking Southern Zhili, Luo Rucai with defending the Yellow River, and Ma Shouying with leading the mobile division. Zhang and Gao sacked Fengyang, the ancestral home of the Hongwu Emperor and the location of his tomb. Over 4,000 Ming officials were killed and 2,600 structures were burned down. During the operation, a dispute occurred between Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong on whether or not to kill the eunuchs, which led to the dissolution of the rebel alliance. They split up with Li moving west and Zhang to the east. Zhang Xianzhong failed to take the city of Luzhou, which was heavily defended with cannons that dealt heavy casualties to the rebels, killing 1,100. Li Zicheng continued his rebel activity throughout 1635 and 1636 with modest success; however, his lieutenant defected to the Ming and took Li's girlfriend along with him. Li lost Xianyang to the Ming after that. To the north, a 43,000 strong Ming army arrived in Henan under the command of Hong Chengchou but he failed to rout the rebels and even suffered a defeat. Lu Xiangsheng was put in charge of rebel pacification in Huguang. Meanwhile the Ming suffered a major defeat when rebel forces surrounded Cao Wenzhao when he overextended and ran into rebel cavalry forces. Cao killed himself. The rebels had become better organized and even had heavy cannons by 1636. Gao Yingxiang moved towards Taozhou and crushed a Ming army on his way to Nanjing. Gao was then defeated in a series of battles against Lu Xiangsheng but escaped. Lu was unable to follow up on his victories and he was called back to the northern frontier to deal with the Qing dynasty's invasion. Sun Chuanting was made Grand Coordinator of Shaanxi. Sun captured Gao Yingxiang when he invaded Shaanxi and sent him to Beijing where he was dismembered. His followers joined other rebel leaders such as Li Zicheng and Lao Huihui. The rebel situation deteriorated even further as the Chongzhen Emperor raised taxes in 1637 to fund the military. A new Vice Minister of War, Xiong Wencan, was put in charge of overall rebel pacification activities, but Hong Chengchou and Zuo Liangyu basically ignored all his orders. Hong was able to defeat Li Zicheng in Sichuan, but victory in battle meant little against the rebel forces, and sometimes the army would even loot and rape in the area evicted of rebels. Ming forces continued to score victories against Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong without being able to kill or capture them. At one point Zhang Xianzhong was even surrendered and was awarded troops and supplies on the promise that he would fight against Li Zicheng. Throughout 1638 and 1639, earthquakes rattled Sichuan and locusts ravaged Suzhou. The rebel movement gained momentum as even more refugees joined them to increase their odds of survival. Li Zicheng kept losing battles and fled into the mountains. Luo Rucai surrendered to the Ming. It appeared for a time that ultimate victory was within grasp for the Ming forces. The Qing invaded again in 1638, exacerbating the Ming's already depleted resources. In 1639, Zhang Xianzhong rebelled again after having recuperated in Gucheng. He opened the prisons of Gucheng and killed the local officials. Joining forces, Zhang and Luo attacked the nearby town of Fangxian and then moved towards the heavily forested mountains of the Shaanxi border. Zuo Liangyu was sent against the renewed rebellion. He was ambushed near Mount Luoying and suffered 10,000 losses. Xiong Wencan was impeached and replaced by Yang Sichang. Although Yang Sichang and Zuo Liangyu clashed on policy, they scored a number of victories against the rebels from 1639 to 1640. It appeared once again that the Ming were finally turning the tide. Zuo inflicted a major defeat on Zhang Xianzhong near Mount Manao, killing 3,500 and capturing several commanders. Zhang escaped to western Sichuan. Yang became wary of Zuo's successes and tried to promote another general, He Renlong, as his equal. When that didn't work, both generals were alienated. By the winter of 1640, Sichuan was being ravaged by Zhang Xianzhong, and Ming forces were deserting on a daily basis. Yang requested to be relieved from his post. The Chongzhen Emperor refused and instead sent him more funds for medicine and famine relief. =Rise of Li Zicheng (1641–1644)= Li Zicheng's rebellion 1637–1644 In 1641, Zhang Xianzhong captured Xiangyang and Li Zicheng captured Luoyang. Li soon lost Luoyang to Ming forces but he was recognized by then as the foremost rebel leader. With his large following he besieged Kaifeng. Upon hearing this, Yang stopped eating and died in spring. He was replaced by Ding Qirui. Meanwhile Zhang Xianzhong was beaten back and forced back west from Yunyang. Even as the Ming armies collapsed from 1641 to 1644, they were still scoring local victories over the rebels. Ding Qirui was unable to control his starving men who looted the towns they crossed. Some simply deserted to scrounge for food. Ding was impeached and replaced by Fu Zonglong. Zhang Xianzhong's army had welled upward of 100,000 but he was unable to score any major victories against Ming forces except in the taking of cities in Sichuan, which they slaughtered. Luo Rucai left Zhang and joined Li Zicheng. Li captured both Xincai and Nanyang, and in the process killed Fu Zonglong and Meng Ruhu. He Renlong was executed for being suspected of aiding the rebels. In 1642, Xiangcheng, Shucheng, Runing, Xiangyang, De'an, and Chengtian all fell to Li Zicheng. Zhang Xianzhong took Luzhou. Li's siege of Kaifeng went badly as he tried again and again to take the heavily defended city. During one attack, he lost an eye to an arrow. The city was finally taken on 7 October 1642 by diverting a river and flooding the city, killing 270,000 people. The rebels looted whatever was left of the city and retreated. By 1643, the rebels had coalesced into just two major factions in Li Zicheng in Central China and Zhang Xianzhong in Sichuan. Li declared himself Prince of Shun and Zhang declared himself Prince of the West. Wuchang, Hanyang, and Changsha fell to Zhang. Li felt threatened by Zhang's growing success so he put a bounty on his head. Li also consolidated power within his own faction by eliminating Luo Rucai and other local bandits. In the autumn, the Chongzhen Emperor ordered Sun Chuanting to attack Li. This turned out to be the last Ming offensive as the Ming army was completely destroyed and Sun killed in battle. Li followed up the victory by capturing Xi'an, which surrendered without a fight. In 1644, Li Zicheng declared the formation of the Shun dynasty. In Beijing, Chongzhen made a last ditch effort to raise an army from the civilian population and sent them out against Li. More than half the army deserted before they were even 100 li away from Beijing. Li advanced on the Ming capital in two directions, taking Taiyuan, Datong, and Changping in the process. On 24 April, one of Chongzhen's eunuchs ordered the gates to be opened for the rebels but the guards refused. The defense shot off their cannons in a large show of force, but they had no ammunition. When the rebels realized that only powder was being fired, they attacked in force and took the city gates in a brief struggle. The Chongzhen Emperor ordered the imperial family to commit suicide. Before hanging himself, Chongzhen cut off the arm of one of the princesses who could not bring themselves to suicide. She was still alive the next day when the rebels found her. Li Zicheng's victory was short lived. The next month the northern general Wu Sangui defected to the Qing dynasty and together they defeated Li at the Battle of Shanhai Pass. Li's Shun dynasty was dismantled the following year with Li himself disappearing in the chaos. Zhang Xianzhong was killed by Qing forces in 1647.

It is currently used mostly for association football matches and is the home stadium of Skive Idrætsklub (association football) and Skive Atletik- og Motionsklub (athletics). The stadium is part of a sport center, which since 2007 has also consisted of a multi-purpose hall named Spar Nord Arena, while the stadium itself includes IAAF certified athletics and sports facilities such as six round lanes, eight straight lanes, starting blocks, electronic timing, two tracks for the long jump and triple jump, pole vault and three throw cages surrounding an association football field. The ground has a lighting installation with a light intensity of 500 lux and have been approved for televised Danish 1st Division matches by the Danish FA. Apart from hosting matches for the second highest football league, the stadium has also staged two men's youth friendlies and two European women's youth qualification games, one for the Danish national youth team. It has been known as Hancock Arena for sponsorship reasons since July 2018 and have previously been referred to as Sparbank Arena (2010–2012), Spar Nord Arena (2012–2018) and SIK Arena (2018).  History  The construction of the stadium at Engvej broke ground in May 1941, with the last details coming into place in the spring of 1943, and the new stadium was finished in 1944 at a total cost of DKK 130,000. As part of the agreement between Skive IK and Skive Municipality, a new club house was built at the ground at a cost of DKK 12,000 and the club officially moved to Engvej in the spring of 1944. The stadium, with a total area of 9.5 barrels of land located at the meadow referred as Rosens Eng next to Karup River, consisted of an exhibition field with athletics courses, two training fields and four tennis courts. In the years leading up to the construction of the stadium, the meadow had already been filled up by the municipality as relief work for the unemployed. The inauguration of the stadium at Engvej took place on 5 June 1944 (Constitution Day) with a programme consisting of a large athletics event with participation of many of the country's strongest athletes and an association football match in front of nearly 4,000 spectators. Skive IK, participating in the 1943–44 JBU's Mesterskabsrække, lost their association football match against the best placed Jutlandish league team in the 1943–44 season, Aarhus GF. Arbejdernes Idrætsforening (AIF), which was the competing sports team in the city, had their own inauguration of the stadium on 18 June 1944 with music, singing and association football, and their first team in the JBU's Mellemrække played an exhibition match against the local rivals Holstebro BK from the JBU's Mesterskabsrække. The City Council of Skive made a unanimous decision on 12 June 1944 to prohibit the presence of non-paying spectators at the north lying hillside, with the residence of the Skive Museum, during association football matches. Proposed by the then Street and Road Committee, the ban was meant to discourage potential free riders from viewing the matches from outside that stadium's gates, which could cost revenue for Skive IK and Skive Municipality. However, the local police have never enforced the ban nor spend resources on it, which have not had any significant impact. In the spring of 1945, the German occupying forces seizes the stadium facilities and on 8 May 1945 a large parade was held by the Danish resistance movement. Although the construction of a covered spectator stand had to be abandoned due to the stringent rationing of building material during World War II, it was finally built starting from the summer of 1965 to spring 1966 using voluntary labor and with partial financial support from Skive Municipality for the building materials, and was attached to Skive IK's new club member's house next to the football field — the house was inaugurated on 28 March 1966. The stadium holds 10,000 people of which 523 are seated at the covered grandstand in the south west side. The stadium's record attendance was recorded on 19 May 1955 (Ascension Day), when sold-out stadium crowd of nearly 10,000 spectators watched the last decisive league match in the 1954–55 Jutland Series between the two highest placed teams in the northern division, Skive IK and local rivals Viborg FF, competing for the division title and hence a spot in the 1954–55 Jutland Championship Final and qualification for the 1954–55 Kvalifikationsturneringen (popularly known as the Danish 4th Division). The level 4 league match, that Viborg FF won 3–2 in windy rain, is reportedly the largest match attendance to a lower ranking Danish league game, outside of the top three divisional structure. Large renovations and expansions to the stadium began in 1998. At that point, club members referred to the 55 years old ground as the most outdated division stadium in Denmark. As a consequence of the first phase, that involved the running tracks for the athletes having synthetic coating installed by 1999 and hence upgrading them to international standards, Skive IK was forced to relocate their professional association football home matches to Egeris Idrætsanlæg (more specifically Bane 1) in the south part of the city — the team played a last game at the stadium, before the renovations commenced, against Skovshoved IF in the fall of 1997 as part of their 1997–98 Danish 2nd Division campaign. The club's professional senior team played at their temporary ground until the reconstruction was completed in 2003, while Skive AM was the only club to use the stadium facilities after the completion of phase one. After a 5.5 year displacement period, Skive IK inaugurated the renovated stadium on 11 May 2003 with a derby against Holstebro BK in front of 1,720 spectators as part of a larger celebration program that included speeches, cycling and athletics competitions. The first phase had cost Skive Municipality DKK 10 million, which delayed the second phase of the project due to lack of funds. The task of completing phase two was handed to a local Skive contractor, Kaj Ove Madsen A/S. The second phase involved renovations to the buildings by 2003, resulting in a two-story extension of the building's wings totaling 190 m², 520 covered seatings and other facilities at the grandstand, a more contemporary scoreboard and a new grass blanket on the football field was laid. The existing changing rooms were renovated with additional changing rooms installed for the referees. Changes also included facilities such as an exercise room, public toilets, a cafeteria with an extended terrace, a kitchen at the building's ground floor, while the first floor got VIP rooms for sponsors, press and meetings, a speakerbox, and rooms for the local athletics and cycling clubs, Skive AM and Skive Cykelklub. Plankings were erected around the stadium as part of the modernisations to the stadium, with the support of Skive IK's then chairman, to prevent matches being viewed from Engvej, and the Skive Committee on Culture and Industry took the initiative to beautify the planking with climbing plants. The running tracks were renovated again in 2009 due to wear and tear together with the buildings in 2010, and included the installation of a balcony at the grandstand and, due to security reasons, a designated area for the away fans at association football matches and better sponsor facilities. On 7 and 10 April 2016, the stadium hosted two 2016 UEFA Women's Under-19 Championship qualification games, and have previously staged two men's friendlies for the Danish national youth teams in 1961 and 2015. An upgrade of the existing floodlights of 150 lux to 500 lux was done in the late 2000s to better support the minimum requirements of 1000 lux set forward for evening TV-transmissions at level 2. New demands for under-soil heating at all professional matches in the Danish 1st Division were implemented beginning with the 2017/18 season, and Skive IK could no longer rely on a several years long dispensation from the Danish FA. Hence, in the summer of 2017 Skive Municipality decided to invest DKK 2.6 million in installing a total of 25 kilometers of pipes under the municipal owned facility's football field as part of the new heating system provided by Danjord. In the years leading up to 2010, both Skive IK Elite A/S and Skive AM had been paying Skive Municipality an annual rent of DKK 100,000 and in the years leading up to 2019, SIK Elite were paying DKK 318,999 in annual rent for the usage of Skive Stadium, but the latest investments to the ground heating and recent overpayments from Skive IK meant an adjustment of the annual rent down to DKK 295,000 not including the payment for using the new heating system. The watering system at the stadium, installed in the summer of 2010, makes use of the nearby river, Karup Å, which lowers the cost of water to a minimum.  Name, sponsorships and logos  On 8 September 2009, the Finance Committee of Skive Municipality approved the sale of the rights to naming sponsorships at Skive Stadium to Skive IK Elite A/S for DKK 25,000 for four years in addition to having the rights to sell banner ads at Skive Stadium. On 1 July 2010 the regional bank, Sparbank, obtained the naming rights for the stadium, renaming it Sparbank Arena, creating matching names with the indoor athletics hall next to the stadium, that was constructed in 2007. When the regional Skive-based bank merged with the Aalborg-based bank Spar Nord Bank in the fall of 2012, the sponsorship agreement was continued in the new financial constellation, with the stadium name being changed to Spar Nord Arena, beginning 18 November 2012. The bank announced a withdrawal from its main sponsorship of Skive IK Elite A/S and its naming rights to the stadium in the fall of 2017, which was made public in February 2018, but would continue having the naming rights for the stadium in 2018 until a new sponsor was found. Due to uncertainty surrounding the withdrawal, for a short period in March 2018, the stadium was hence temporarily referred to as SIK Arena. On 1 July 2018, Skive Stadium officially changed its name to Hancock Arena, when a sponsorship deal was reached between the local brewery Hancock Bryggerierne A/S and SIK Elite, that is set to expire on 1 January 2022. At FIFA and UEFA matches, it is still known under its original name, Skive Stadium, due to sponsorship restrictions.

Margaret C. Whiting and Ellen Miller formed the society in 1896 as a way to help residents boost the town's economy by reviving American needlework from the 1700s. This society was inspired by the crewel work of 18th-century women who had lived in the Deerfield, Massachusetts area. Members of the Blue and White Society initially used the patterns and stitches from these earlier works, but because these new embroideries were not meant to replicate the earlier works, the embroidery soon deviated from the original versions with new patterns and stitches, and even the use of linen, rather than wool, thread. The society disbanded in 1926 for several reasons. Ellen Miller was in declining health, the trained stitchers were getting old and couldn't continue, Margaret Whiting's sight was fading, and the design and quality of commercially produced items was increasing.  Founding  Margaret C. Whiting and Ellen Miller were descended from Colonial families, though they were not originally from Deerfield. The Miller family, with two daughters, had come to Deerfield from the nearby town of Hatfield in 1893, and in 1895 Mrs. Calvin Whiting arrived with her two daughters from Holyoke. The families were already friends, and Margaret and Ellen may have known each other while both were students at the New York Academy of Design. By the middle of the 19th century, Deerfield's population was declining, with young people moving away. There was a focus amongst those who stayed on Deerfield's history, and this was reflected in the establishment in 1870 of the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial Association, which actively collected local artifacts, which formed the basis of the Memorial Hall Museum, which opened to the public in 1880. This local interest in heritage served as the setting for the founding of the Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework. Whiting and Miller carefully examined historical crewel embroidery of the area as found in the possession of residents and in Memorial Hall Museum. Using these pieces as learning tools, they mastered the stitches and motifs used by the colonial embroiderers. As their work became known, not only were people interested in buying it, but also learning to produce it. Whiting and Miller formed a cooperative, the Deerfield Society of Blue and White Needlework, in which the stitching members shared in the proceeds of the sales.  The business  Miller and Whiting hired workers—four to start—and provided them with the needed materials. They offered classes for beginners, in order to train additional qualified women. Eventually, between 25 and 30 women, ranging in age from 19 to 70, actively participated in the Society at a given time. Women were paid based on the work that they did. The time that would be needed to complete each element of each pattern was determined, so workers who were quick and precise would be at an advantage. The average earning was 20 cents per hour, and average annual earnings ranged from 75 cents and $139. Prices for completed items were based on the cost of the materials, the time to design a project, and the stitching time. In 1904, costs ranged from $1.50 for a 6\\" doily to table squares up to $30. These costs were many times more expensive than manufactured linens of high quality. Initially, the Society members based their work on the historical examples. The designs were taken from those in the local museum and from those owned privately. Motifs were used as needed for design purposes, and therefore deviated from the source pieces. At the start, blue threads were used on white fabric. Different sources report that these threads were of linen or wool. Both Whiting and Miller, using their design training, soon developed new designs, and eventually started using threads in other colors, such as greens, madder (red), and fustic (yellow). They experimented with applique and cross-stitch. Works emanating from the Society were trademarked with a letter \\"D\\" in the center of a spinning wheel.  Arts and Crafts influence  The Arts and Crafts movement influenced the Deerfield Society both in its organization and its use of materials. The Society engaged in hand craftsmanship, something that was waning in the Industrial Age. In connection with this rejection of mass produced materials, members of the Society sought out handmade materials. Whiting and Miller used vegetable dyes in order to create the colors of the wool threads, and handwoven linen fabric was bought for use as the background from Berea College and weavers in Vermont and Georgia.  Impact on other arts and crafts in Deerfield  The Society's founding had an impact on other craft revivals in the town: rag rugs and linens were woven, baskets were woven by two groups, one that called themselves the Deerfield Basket Makers and another at the north end of town, the Pocumtuck Basket Makers. Individuals worked with iron, silver and copper, and photography.

She served as a community health worker, living in a rural town with a mixed population of Christians, Muslims, and practitioners of Vodun, the local traditional faith. During these years, the United States was at war in Afghanistan and Iraq. The experience of deep cultural immersion, coupled with hearing firsthand her Beninese neighbors’ criticism of the wars, caused Beckett to view her home country with new eyes.

History  The Open Insulin Project was started in 2015 by Anthony Di Franco, himself a Type-1 diabetic. He started the project in response to the unreasonably high prices of insulin in the US. The project has been housed in Counter Culture Labs, a community laboratory and maker space in the Bay Area. Other collaborators include ReaGent, BioCurious and BioFoundry.  Goals  The project aims to develop both the methodology and hardware to allow communities and individuals to produce medical-grade insulin for the treatment of diabetes. These methods will be low-cost in order to combat the high price of insulin in places like the US. There is also potential for small-scale distributed production that may allow for improved insulin access in places with poor availability infrastructure. Access to insulin remains so insufficient around the globe that \\"Half of all people who need insulin lack the financial or logistical means to obtain adequate supplies\\".  Motivation  Researcher Frederick Banting famously refused to put his name on the patent after discovering insulin in 1923. The original patent for insulin was later sold by his collaborators for just $1 to the University of Toronto in an effort to make it as available as possible.https://www.diabetes.org/blog/history-wonderful- thing-we-call-insulin Despite this, for various reasons, there remains no generic version of insulin available in the US. Insulin remains controlled by a small number of large pharmaceutical companies and sold at prices unaffordable to many who rely on it to live, particularly those without insurance. This lack of availability has led to fatalities, such as Alec Smith who passed away in 2018 due to lack of insulin. The Open Insulin Project is motivated by the urgent need to protect the health of those with diabetes regardless of their economic or employment status by developing low-cost methods for insulin production available for anyone to use.  Progress and status  The project has made significant progress via genetically-engineered yeast, and according to their most recent release the \\"first major milestone ― the production of insulin at lab scale ― is almost complete\\". The cost to produce insulin via Open Insulin methods is estimated by the project to be such that \\"roughly $10,000 should be enough to get a group started with the equipment needed to produce enough insulin for 10,000 people\\".

Title page of Songs In The New Opera Call'd Hydaspes, 1710 Aria from Songs In The New Opera Call'd Hydaspes, 1710 Hydaspes (also L’Idaspe fedele) is an opera by Francesco Mancini with a libretto by Giovanni Pietro Candi. It was first performed at the King's Theater in the Haymarket, London, on 23 March 1710. It was the second opera in England to be sung entirely in Italian, after Almahide, and was an early London success for the famous castrato Nicolò Grimaldi in the title role. Development The original libretto by Giovanni Pietro Candi and Giulio Convò was revised by Silvio Stampiglia and staged at the teatro San Bartolomeo in Naples in 1705, with the title Gli amanti generosi. Nicolò Grimaldi brought the score with him when he came to London, and had considerable say over how the music was selected and adapted for a new London version. This work was undertaken by Johann Christoph Pepusch and the modified work was given the title Idaspe fedele. Among the material introduced by Pepusch were two arias borrowed from Giovanni Bononcini’s Regina creduta re. While Almahide (1710) is generally described as the first Italian opera in England, it had comic intermezzi in English between the acts. By not having these interludes, Idaspe fedele offered the first Italian-only opera experience to London audiences. This development came about as a result of an increasing taste for Italian style opera seria, with no comic scenes at all. The same libretto used in the London version of Idaspe was employed by Riccardo Broschi for his 1730 work Idaspe at the Teatro S Giovanni Grisostomo that starred Farinelli. Roles and plot *Artaserse, king of Persia *Dario, brother of Artaserse *Idaspe, nephew of Artaserse, disguised as Acrone *Arbace, captain of the guard *Mandane, daughter of the king of Media *Berenice, a Persian princess. Idaspe and his brother Artaserse are rivals for the affections of Berenice. The king condemns Idaspe to fight a lion in the amphitheatre with Berenice watching. Idaspe strangles the lion and the people demand mercy for him, leading to a general reconciliation. Performance history The first season saw performances on 23 and 30 March, 1, 15, 18, 21 and 28 April, and 2, 5, 12, 23, 30 May 1710. The original cast was Nicolo Grimaldi (Idaspe), Giovanni Cassani (Artaserse), Valentino Urbani (Dario), Lawrence (Arbace), Isabella Girardeau (Mandane) and Margherita de L’Epine (Berenice). The sets were designed by the Venetian Marco Ricci. The orchestra during the first season was composed of a mix of English and foreign players, mostly Italian and French. Performances were held in the second season on 22, 25 and 29 November, 2, 20, 27 and 30 December 1710, followed by 7, 10 and 17 February, 4 and 7 April and 30 May 1711. Elisabetta Pilotti-Schiavonetti replaced Margherita de L’Epine (Berenice) and Giuseppe Maria Boschi made his English debut replacing Cassani (Artaxerxes). The other cast members were Urbani (Dario), Grimaldi (Idaspe), Lawrence (Arbaces) and Girardeau (Mandane). The opera was revived at the Haymarket in 1712 and again on 27 August 1715 in a revised version. Altogether there were 46 performances of Idaspe between 1710 and 1716. At the end of May 1710 Walsh, Randall, and Hare published Songs in the new Opera, Call’d Hydaspes, consisting of the overture and 40 arias. In January 1711 they published new arias written for Boschi in The Additionall Songs in the new Opera, Call’d Hydaspes. Critical reception The scene in which Idaspe (dressed in a flesh-coloured costume to simulate nakedness) strangles a lion caused a sensation and ensured that the opera achieved a tremendous box office success, despite the unusually high price of the tickets. Nevertheless it was also the focus of criticism and satirical comment. In The Spectator (no. 13) Addison ridiculed it, and concluded that “audiences have often been reproached by writers for the coarseness of their taste, but our present grievance does not seem to be the want of a good taste, but of common sense.” The historian of opera Sutherland Edwards commented 'after appealing to the monster in a minor key, and telling him that he may tear his bosom, but cannot touch his heart, he attacks him in the relative major, and strangles him.' He suggests that “the ridiculous opera of Hydaspes could only have succeeded, despite its absurdities, because of the outstanding singing of Nicolini. “Hydaspes with much vocal effort begs the lion to ‘come on’. The lion... accepts the challenge and there is a struggle, Hydaspes and the lion pausing in the combat while Hydaspes declares his love for Berenice and explains matters generally in florid Italian singing. Hydaspes strangles the lion and... asks if any other monster is available.” Harlequin Hydaspes In 1719 a burlesque English-language parody of the opera, called Harlequin Hydaspes had a single performance on 27 May at Lincoln’s Inn Fields. The work was written by Isabella Aubert, who had sung the role of Mandane in the 1715 production of Idaspe. In Harlequin Hydaspes Aubert herself took the role of harlequin (based on Idaspe). Christopher Bullock played ‘the doctor’ (Artaserse). Much of the music from Idaspe was reused in Harlequin Hydaspes, together with arias from Alessandro Scarlatti’s Pyrrhus and Demetrius, Almahide, Handel’s Rinaldo and Amadigi and the pasticcio Clearte.(1716).

Her major contributions to her university's program was her research and work with local prostitutes to prevent HIV/AIDS transmission. Ngugi is described as the first Kenyan nurse to become a professor.  Early career and education  Ngugi started nursing at the Kenyatta National Hospital in 1960, as the Sister in Charge of paediatric health. In 1979 she was promoted to deputy chief nursing officer at the Ministry of Health. In 1981, while still practicing as a nurse, Ngugi presented a paper about the emerging, new role of nurses in the Kenyan health system. She emphasized that the role of a nurse is not only caring for the patient, but engaging with and caring for the patient's family members as well. Ngugi studied at Columbia Pacific University for her BA and Masters in Nursing Administration from 1983–1985, and earned a PhD in social work in 1989. In 1986 she became a lecturer in the University of Nairobi, School of Public Health and was eventually promoted to the position of Kenyan national AIDS coordinator.  Work against HIV/AIDS  Ngugi was involved in an international collaboration in Nairobi to engage with sex workers and help them to tackle sexual transmitted diseases. She joined in 1984 as a nurse, and made efforts to reach out to sex workers instead of stigmatising them. Much of Ngugi's research focused on these vulnerable communities, and she provided them with medical care, advice and free condoms in return for participation. She was involved in research that studied the efficacy of a contraceptive sponge in preventing new HIV infections about Nairobi sex workers. The study found no evidence in the effectiveness of the contraceptive sponge in reducing infections. By helping the sex workers to collectively demand condom use from their clients, their utilisation has soared from 4% to 90%, even though men often offer more money for unprotected sex. Her empowering approach has been praised by public health experts. In 1984, Ngugi in collaboration with Frank Plummer from the University of Manitoba, helped establish the Majengo Clinic in Majengo, Kenya. The clinic has gone on to serve as a site for a multitude of HIV/AIDS research and as a site for sex workers to receive treatment and prevention services for sexually transmitted diseases. Through this clinic, Ngugi worked in the forefront of treating sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and chlamydia. Ngugi and Frank Plummer from Manitoba published a study indicating levels of long-lived HIV resistance among Kenyan sex workers who work in Majengo, Nairobi. Ngugi decried the fact that these women contribute so much to research but are still living in poverty and must sell their bodies to survive. In 1991 she became director of the collaborative HIV/AIDS effort with the University of Manitoba, a role she held until 2006. Ngugi was promoted to Associate Professor of Community Health Sciences at the University of Manitoba in her final year of directorship. In 1992 Ngugi established HerStory (initially as the Kenya Voluntary Women Rehabilitation Centre) to support sex workers to escape prostitution with training, support and microfinance. Now HerStory also looks after AIDS orphans. In 1992, Ngugi with Peter Piot, Jonathan Mann, Bila Kapita, Robert Colebunders co-authored \\"AIDS IN AFRICA: A manual for physicians\\" and published it through WHO for the purpose of aiding physicians in diagnosis and treatment of HIV/AIDS. The manual also served as an educational material for physicians on what should be expected and on the possible transmission methods of HIV.Piot, Peter, Kapita, Bila M, Ngugi, Elizabeth N, Mann, Jonathan M, Colebunders, Robert. et al.

She also led the implementation of government efforts against HIV/AIDS including the building of ten drop-in centres for vulnerable populations in Northern/Eastern Kenya.  Awards  For her contributions to public health in Kenya Ngugi has been awarded many accolades, including: * 2004 UN Kenyan of the Year. * 2004/5 Order of the Golden Warrior Presidential Award.

Her research investigates the regulation of tuberculosis in HIV prevalent populations and improving access to HIV self-testing.  Early life and education  Corbett studied natural sciences at the University of Cambridge and graduated in 1985. She remained there for her Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery and completed her training in 1989. In 1992 Corbett completed her membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) before earning a Diploma of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1996. She moved to the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine for her postgraduate research where she earned her PhD from the University of London in 2000. Her doctoral research investigated tuberculosis in relation to HIV in South African gold mining communities. That year she completed her specialist training in infectious diseases at the London Deanery. At the time she completed her training, medical services in developing countries were overwhelmed with deaths from HIV and tuberculosis.  Research and career  Corbett joined the faculty at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in 2000 and moved to Harare, Zimbabwe in 2001. She joined the LSHTM as a Wellcome Trust Fellow and established the country's first tuberculosis laboratory. Corbett decided to start in Zimbabwe as the country has quality medical education and good public health infrastructure, and Corbett recruited scientists and technicians from the local community. In 2005 she was awarded a Senior Research Fellowship which allowed her to evaluate tuberculosis screening protocols. Corbett worked with the World Health Organization HIV Department in Geneva to investigate the access that healthcare workers in African countries have to HIV testing and care. At the time HIV self-testing was not very accessible, but was the primary form of diagnosis for healthcare workers. Corbett worked with the World Health Organization to support self-testing for healthcare workers. The success of this project meant that Corbett moved to Malawi. Since 2009 Corbett has worked as an Epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and part of the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust program based in Blantyre. She was promoted to Professor in 2012 and led the world's first large evaluation of HIV self-testing. She has since lobbied Unitaid and Population Services International to provide self-testing in six African countries, raising over $72 million to support research and community-level implementation. The HIV self-testing kits have since been taken up by 59 countries, and over 6 million were used in 2018. Alongside HIVself-testing, Corbett is interested in tuberculosis management in HIV prevalent populations. She has investigated whether sputum microscopy or X-ray based diagnostics could be used to diagnose cases of tuberculosis in communities impacted by high rates of tuberculosis and HIV, as well as whether HIV self-testing should be offered to people who have tuberculosis-like symptoms. She has investigated the epidemic of long-term survivors of perinatal HIV transmission. Alongside her scientific research, Corbett has designed research training and taught students at the Malawi College of Medicine. = Awards and honours = In 2018 Corbett was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. She delivered the 2018 Stephen Lawn Memorial Lecture. Corbett has served on various advisory boards within the World Health Organization, including membership of the Strategic & Technical Advisory Group.

She has released four solo albums of traditional Syrian music, and toured internationally since 2010. She is a founding instructor-performer for the project \\"Orpheus XXI – Music for life and dignity,\\" supporting refugee musicians in Europe. In 2018, she was made a chevalier (knight) in the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres.  Biography  Bouhassoun was born in 1979, and grew up in Shaqqa, a small Druze village near As-Suwayda in Southern Syria. She began playing the oud at age seven, taught by her father. In high school, she began to play in regional competitions, and by age 18 had travelled widely in Syria as a performer. She then entered the Higher Institute of Music in Damascus, where she studied for three years. There were no courses in Eastern singing, so she studied opera. She was asked to learn a Western instrument to play in the Syrian National Symphony Orchestra, but continued to study the oud instead. In 2005, Bouhassoun had her first performance in France, at the Festival de l’imaginaire (\\"Festival of the Imaginary\\"), where she sang and played the oud as part of a play. To prepare for a solo performance at the next Festival de l’imaginaire, Bouhassoun travelled to Aleppo to train further as a singer wth traditional musicians. In 2007, Bouhassoun was invited to perform at the Festival of Sacred World Music in Fez, Morocco. In 2010, Bouhassoun moved to Paris to begin a masters' degree in ethnomusicology researching Syrian Druze funerals, supervised by the ethnomusicologist Jean Lambert. As of 2016, she was a doctoral student in ethnomusicology at Paris Nanterre University, and a member of the (CREM). Beginning in 2016, Bouhassoun was one of the founding instructor-performers for the project \\"Orpheus XXI – Music for life and dignity,\\" a program led by Jordi Savall to support refugees in Europe with traditional music training. The program was funded by the European Commission as part of the Creative Europe Programme on 29 September 2016. The project provides employment for refugee musicians, and teaches refugee children traditional music from their countries of origin, allowing for the preservation of cultural heritage and positive personal opportunities for participants. The first concerts took place in the summer of 2017, featuring Bouhassoun on the oud. In 2018, Bouhassoun was made a chevalier (knight) in the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (Order of Arts and letters). Bouhassoun remains based in Paris, but continues to return to Syria annually to visit family and research ethnomusicology.  Music  Bouhassoun is an alto. She has released four solo albums, each featuring little more than her own voice and oud-playing. Her music has been praised for preserving Syria's rich cultural history, and for the intimate, minimalist beauty of her songs. Her third album, La voix de la passion (The Voice of Passion), features Nabatean Bedouin dialect poetry from the North of Syria where she has conducted field surveys for her masters' degree. Bouhassoun has also contributed to three albums published by Jordi Savall. = Solo Albums = * La voix de l’amour (A Voice for Love) (2009), released by the Arab World Institute and distributed by Harmonia Mundi – selected as a \\"coup de coeur\\" for the year by the Académie Charles Cros. * L'âme du luth (The Soul of the Lute) (2014), Buda Musique – named a \\"coup de coeur\\" by the Académie Charles Cros * La voix de la passion (The Voice of Passion) (2017), Buda Musique. * Les ames retrouvees (Souls Found) (2019), Buda Musique. = Group albums = * Orient Occident II - Homage to Syria (2013), Alia Vox. * Ramon Llull (2016), Alia Vox. * Granada (2016), Alia Vox.

Biography Born on October 18, 1953 in Paris to a Swiss-German mother and an Alsatian father, Julien Weiss, a guitarist of classical training which he learned from École Normale de Musique de Paris as a student, had fallen in love with Arabic music in 1976 when he met Munir Bachir, the Iraqi grand master of the oud (oriental lute). He then embarked on the study of this instrument and of the refined laws governing oriental micro- tonal music. Abandoning the oud for the qanûn, a sort of oriental zither which he had learned from great masters in various countries of the Middle East, Julien Weiss had founded in 1983 the instrumental ensemble Al-Kindi conceived as a takht (grouping of soloists) devoted to music of the Arab world. Three years later, in 1986, he converted to Islam and took the name Julien Jâlal Eddine Weiss as a homage to Jalāl ad-Dīn Muhammad Rūmī. During his career, Weiss performed at more than five hundred concerts, notably at the Théâtre de la Ville de Paris, the Institut du monde arabe in Paris, the Beiteddine Festival in Lebanon, Carnegie Hall in New York, and at Nuits de Fourvière in Lyon, as well as in cities such as Hong Kong, São Paulo, and Washington.

The effort was launched as an initiative of the Tribune Publishing Company by its chairman, David Dreier, at the National Press Club Journalism Institute in June 2019. That marked the first anniversary of the deadliest assault against journalists in United States history. On June 28, 2018, a gunman killed five employees in the newsroom of The Capital in Annapolis, Maryland. Tribune Publishing is the parent company of The Capital. The FJM Foundation is housed at the National Press Club Journalism Institute, the club's non-profit educational affiliate, with Barbara Cochran serving as president of the foundation. Dreier, who is a former senior member of the United States House of Representatives (1981-2013) and a longtime champion of press freedoms, has said that he looks forward to leading this multi-year effort to its completion. The only memorial commemorating journalists located in Washington, D.C. resided at the Newseum, which closed at the end of 2019. Dreier has said that, in addition to the mass shooting at The Capital in 2018, the closing of the Newseum provided inspiration for the FJM project. The Annenberg Foundation and the Michael and Jackie Ferro Foundation have provided initial funds for the FJM Foundation.  Legislation  The enactment of federal legislation is required to authorize the establishment of a commemorative work in Washington, D.C. The approval of the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission is required as well. On June 25, 2019, a bipartisan and bicameral group of members of the United States Congress introduced the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act of 2019 (H.R. 3465 and S. 1969), which would permit the construction of a Fallen Journalists Memorial in Area I (not including the \\"Reserve\\") or Area II of Washington, D.C., as depicted by U.S. National Park Service map number 869/86501 B dated June 24, 2003. This permissible area includes all of Washington, D.C. except the \\"Reserve\\" (shaded red on the map), which stretches from Lafayette Park neighboring the White House (north) to the Jefferson Memorial (south), and from the Capitol (east) to the Lincoln Memorial (west). In accordance with the Commemorative Works Act of 1986, the FJM project will be funded with private donations.Map Number 869/86501 of Washington, D.C., and its environs produced by the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior. This map shows the three areas used by the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, U.S. National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission, U.S. National Capital Planning Commission, and U.S. National Park Service to site commemorative works in the D.C. metropolitan area. This map is cited in the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act of 2019 designating acceptable locations for the Fallen Journalists Memorial. In the House of Representatives, Grace Napolitano (D-California) and Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma) sponsored H.R. 3465, which has been referred to the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands. In the Senate, Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) sponsored S. 1969, which has been referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. As of July 2020, 49 representatives and 12 senators have cosponsored the legislation in the 116th Congress. = Progress = On September 24, 2019, representatives from the FJM Foundation, including President Barbara Cochran, testified before the National Capital Memorial Advisory Commission in support of a permanent memorial to fallen journalists. The Commission tentatively voted to support the effort. On December 4, 2019, the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands heard testimony on the memorial from Cochran and Representative Napolitano. On January 15, 2020, the House Committee on Natural Resources voted to advance the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act so that the legislation will be considered by the full House of Representatives. On September 21, 2020, the House of Representatives passed the Fallen Journalists Memorial Act of 2019.

He was one of those at the forefront in North America of the movement for moral treatment of mental patients. Earlier in life, he was a settler, farmer, physician, scientist, and explorer in Western Australia, and then he became a naval surgeon in South Africa. Early years Henry Landor was born in 1815 in Anglesey in Wales. He was educated in Liverpool under the care of Dr Prince. He graduated in the session of 1835–36 from the Aldersgate School of Medicine in London, England, receiving a Silver Medal.H M Hurd: The Institutional Care of the Insane in the United States and Canada (Volume 4) onlineThe American Journal of Insanity, p.206 Western Australia Landor and his brothers Edward Wilson Landor, a lawyer, and George W Landor, arrived in the Colony of Western Australia on 27 August 1841.Rica Erickson: Dictionary of Western Australians Landor was appointed a magistrate on 16 November 1841. Landor farmed in partnership with Nathan Elias Knight, occupying a grant \\"on the Dale\\",Inquirer 29 September 1841,p.1; 13 October 1841, p.6. and advertised for sheep and cattle \\"on shares.\\" They also leased Rivett Henry Bland's farm in York. While there, Landor became concerned with the spread of disease among the Aboriginal people. It was his opinion that contact with white settlers had been the cause of the virulent diseases. He took it upon himself to gather as many Aboriginals as he could to look after them properly, and he applied unsuccessfully for government money for a hospital, though received some funds for medical treatment.John E Deacon: A Survey of the Historical Development of the Avon Valley with Particular Reference to York, Western Australia During the Years 1830–1850, UWA, 1948, p.118-119; CSC Inward Letters, 30 May 1842.

Knight and Landor got Bland's corn-mill functioning and continued to farm Merino sheep on their property as Bland and Trimmer had done before. Landor and Knight won the York Agricultural Society's first prize for the best merino ram.Inquirer 25 October 1843, p.3. Landor was involved in the early discussions on behalf of the Society with the Government with a view to bringing convicts to Western Australia. Inquirer 17 April 1844, p.3; Perth Gazette and Western Australian Journal 20 April 1844, p.3. Landor's partnership with Nathan Knight was dissolved on 2 September 1844. In 1842, Henry Landor and Henry Maxwell Lefroy explored to the east of King George's Sound, taking with them to help translate, the 10 year old Aboriginal boy Cowits, who was living in the Landor household. They discovered a \\"very large tract of excellent land, well-watered and abounding with herbage.\\" In December 1844, Landor explored the Deep River and reported that the country he passed over was well adapted for sheep and stock grazing and well supplied with water and timber, including a \\"tree so high (63 paces to the first branch) that he could not look over it\\", being Karri. Medical career In 1845, he took up a position as Government Surgeon to the British Naval Forces at Cape Coast Castle, Cape Town, South Africa. He developed malaria and had to return to England to convalesce, where he developed an interest in insanity. Caring for the Insane In 1850, he became the resident physician of the Higham Retreat in Norwich, England. In 1859 he became a member of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh. In the fall of 1860, he emigrated to Canada and settled in London, Ontario. He engaged in private general practice until 1868. From 1868 to 1870, he was appointed medical superintendent of the Malden Lunatic Asylum in Amherstburg, and then in 1870 he became the first Medical Superintendent, Asylum For The Insane, London, Ontario, which was built to his specifications.C L Krasnick: \\"In charge of loons, a portrait of the London, Ontario Asylum for the Insane, 1984\\", Ontario History, 74(3), 138–184 \\"With so many incurables\\", he wrote, \\"treatment is confined to taking care of comforts (including) good and nourishing food, clothing [the insane] well, and working with those who have the strength to work, exercising out of doors those who can walk.\\" He believed in amusement and occupation \\"daily dances in the afternoon for an hour or two, music, stereoscopic views, etc and [the patients] spin, knit, and make all the socks and stockings used.

The cottages were small satellite buildings on asylum grounds which eased overcrowding and afforded greater freedom of activity to chronic, quiet patients.T J W Burgess, Institutions for the Care of the Insane in Canada, Toronto, 1898, p.35 Landor expressed resentment at the control exerted by Inspector John Woodburn Langmuir, who was responsible for Prisons and Public Charities, complaining in 1876 that the system had become \\"too unbearably military for endurance.\\" Landor died at the London Asylum for the Insane, Ontario, on 6 January 1877 \\"burdened by diabetes, depressed and disillusioned.\\" The London Daily Free Press described him as \\"a gentleman universally respected on account of his attainments, and independence and sincerity of character and those with whom he was on intimate friendship felt an affection for him which may be said to be rare.\\"Website: https://www.lib.uwo.ca/archives/virtualexhibits/londonasylum/landor.html Academic work Landor's publications or other academic work included: *Observations on the physiology of the aborigines (1842), which were controversial.e.g. *Experiments on the poisonous Blackadder Creek Plant (1842). *A pamphlet entitled \\"The only way to stop the slave trade\\", , which was favourably received by the public. *\\"Insanity in Relation to the Law\\", a paper presented to the Association of Officers of Asylums for the Insane in the United States and Canada (1871). *\\"Hysteria in Children as Contrasted with Mania\\", published in London, Ontario (1873). *Observations on ground-ice as a carrier of stones and debris.Cambridge Core, Vol 3, Issue 10, October 1876, pp.459-463.

From the 1920s through his death in 1971, Armin maintained a high profile in Chicago's artistic community. Art critic Samuel Putnam, of the Chicago Evening Post, described Armin as \\"perhaps the most finely sensitized artist in Chicago…with a soul of a peasant and poet and the mind of a philosopher.\\" Early life and education Armin was born in Rădăuți, Austria-Hungary (now Romania) in 1883. His grandfather was a Jewish scribe, copying sacred scrolls for the local temple. Armin began drawing at the age of five and presumably learned woodcarving from his father, Hirsch Lieb, who was an amateur artist. When Armin was 10, his parents died, leaving him an orphan. He was raised by older siblings until he got a full-time job at a restaurant at age 14 and moved into the home of the owner. After a restaurant patron encourage him to attend art school, he moved to Chernivtsi in 1901 at age 18 to study art. In 1905, Armin emigrated to the United States, to join his brother Sigmund and his sister Frieda in Chicago, where he continued to draw sketches whenever he could while unhappily working in a wealthy cousin's store. Armin began his studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1908, and he continued working and studying whenever possible, even through periods of great economic struggle. In 1916, having saved four hundred dollars from his many jobs, he transitioned from taking only night classes to taking day classes as a full-time student, pausing only once during World War I to take a job making artillery harnesses at eighteen dollars a week. He studied under, and was inspired by, George Bellows, Randall Davey and Herman Sachs. Other instructors included Albert Henry Krehbiel, Antonin Sterba, and Harry L. Timmins. In the Spring of 1920, at age 36 and twelve years after he first enrolled in a night class, Armin graduated. =Early work= File:Emil-Armin-Fairyland-1922-Oil-Painting.jpgFairyland (1922), Bernard Friedman Collection File:Emil-Armin-Irene-1922.jpgIrene (1922), The Art Institute of Chicago File:Emil-Armin-Miriam- Sculpture-1923.jpgMiriam (1923), Smart Museum of Art, University of Chicago File:Wood_Lake,_Emil_Armin,_1924.jpgWood Lake (1924), Lakewood, Michigan File:City_Scene,_Emil_Armin,_1924.jpgCity Scene (1924), Hand-Carved Frame File:The_Dream,_Emil_Armin,_1924.jpgThe Dream (1924), Smart Museum, University of Chicago File:Untitled_Mountain,_Emil_Armin,_1924.jpgUntitled (Mountain) (1924), Richard Norton Gallery File:Frances-Strain-Portrait-by- Chicago-Modernist-Emil-Armin-1924.jpgFrances Strain (1924), Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts Collection Career Armin's artwork included paintings, woodcuts, woodcarvings, sculptures, cartoons and etchings, but he is best known for his paintings. He was a modernist painter, with a fondness for painting landscapes, primitive peoples, flowers and animals. In his work, Armin synthesized contemporary artistic trends with inspiration drawn from his Jewish roots and from the peasant traditions of the American Southwest and his native Eastern Europe. Most of his work was completed in Chicago. After finishing his studies, Armin joined a group of artists, including Gertrude Abercrombie, Francis Strain and Charles Biesel, at the 57th Street Art Colony in Hyde Park, near Stony island Avenue, where he lived and worked until 1925. (This group of artists was called the Fifty Seventh Street Group and were also known as the Jackson Park Colony.. Other notable artists that joined included Frances Foy, Gustaf Dalstrom and Beatrice S. Levy.) Armin then shared an art studio with fellow modernist Todros Geller at 59 East Adams from 1926 to 1930. He then briefly moved to the North Side of Chicago, where he worked and lived at 927 Sunnyside Avenue before permanently relocating back to the South Side on Harper Avenue in Hyde Park. His Chicago exhibits in the 1920s included the No-jury Society, Cor Ardens, Neo-Arlimusc, and the Chicago Society of Artists. In the 1930s he entered the Grant Park Art Fair, and he worked as an easel painter for the Works Progress Administration (WPA). In 1940, Armin secured a job working for the Illinois Art Project. In this post Armin visited other artists working for the Project offering advice and criticism. It was also in 1940 that Armin, along with other local Jewish artists, formed the American Jewish Art Club and continued to exhibit with them until his death. Expanding his horizons beyond Chicago, Armin also traveled to work, briefly relocating to Dayton and making trips to the Indiana Dunes, the Wisconsin Dells, New Mexico, Maine and later in life to Lake Chapala in Mexico. Over time, Armin was able to make a modest living as an artist, selling his art and making ends meet with occasional jobs teaching art, including working with the Jewish Board of Education and teaching at Hull House. Armin exhibited regionally and nationally until he died at age 88. =Works Progress Administration (WPA) artwork= File:July_Morning,_Emil_Armin,_1940,_WPA.jpgJuly Morning (1940), WPA, Federal Art Project File:River_and_Clouds,_Emil_Armin,_1941.jpgRiver and Clouds (1941), WPA, Federal Art Project Approach to art Armin believed that \\"the way an artist finds it necessary to live in modern times will automatically assert itself in his work, if he is a true and independent artist.\\" Critical response Armin made an impression with the local Chicago art critics. J. Z. Jacobson, an art critic for The Chicagoan, covered Armin's work and eventually wrote a full book on Armin called Thirty-Five Saints and Emil Armin, in which he described Armin as \\"Playful as a child. Solemn as a prophet. Funny as a clown. Poor as St. Francis of Assisi and almost as happy. Taking the slings and arrows of outrageous fate with stoic calm.\\" Role in Chicago Modernism Ad designed by Armin for the No-Jury Society's 1923 Cubist BallFollowing his graduation in 1920, Armin became an active member in Chicago's emerging modernist art community, which emphasized freedom of individual expression as its sole doctrine. (Art historian Sue Ann Price has described the Chicago Modernism movement as the \\"city's vitriolic struggle between an old guard who advanced the ideals of traditional nineteenth-century art and an avantgarde of painters, illustrators, photographers, and sculptors who espoused the new modernist art from Europe.\\") In 1913, Armin had visited the controversial Armory Show when it was exhibited at the Art Institute, and he fell under the sway of European and American modernism. Inspired by the modernist movement, Armin and other Chicago artists formed their own open and free groups—including The Introspectives, the Cor Ardens, Chicago No-Jury Society of Artists, and Neo-Arlimusc—to provide an alternative to the conservative Art Institute of Chicago. Active in all of these groups, Armin exhibited in every one of the No-Jury Society's shows beginning with the second, and eventually served as president of the Society. He also exhibited with the Chicago Society of Artists, which had taken a contentious turn to modernism in 1923. Marriage and family In 1945, at the age of 65, Armin married Hilda Rose Diamond, a social worker for the Jewish Family and Community Service in Chicago.

Contents  In it al-Hakim al-Samarqandi has developed sixty-two credal statements, and states that the failure to observe them means that one cannot be regarded among the majority of Muslims (al-Sawad al-A'zam), an idea which he based on the Hadith containing al-Sawad al-A'zam (the great majority). The text is a particularly important work in the development of Hanafi-Maturidi theology, as it attempts to faithfully represent the theological beliefs of Abu Hanifa two centuries after his death to a Persian/Central Asian audience then wrestling with the rise of Mu'tazili thought. The text was well-circulated in the centuries after its composition, both in the original Arabic and a Persian translation, along with a later Turkish translation during the Ottoman era. Al-Sawad al-A'zam had been commissioned in the early part of the tenth century by Isma'il b. Ahmad (r.279/892–295/907), the real founder of the Samanid polity in Transoxiana and Khurasan, in order to define the parameters of the Sunni 'orthodoxy' the Samanids were committed to upholding. Blunt in style and authoritarian in tone, al-Sawad al-A'zam was in effect a Hanafite catechism consisting of responses to a large number of doctrinal questions. Like Tafsir al-Tabari, it was translated anonymously, indicating that its contents were not tied to any individual authorial view but rather represented the collective position of the Hanafite theologians of Transoxiana. According to the introduction, the purpose of al-Sawad al-A'zam was to counter the growth of sectarianism in the Samanid realm by setting out clearly the consensus of the theologians of Central Asia regarding specific points of Hanafite doctrine. In the process of doing so, it condemned the beliefs of groups it deemed heretical. These included not just the usual Isma'ilis – but also Mu'tazilites, Kharijites, Murji'ites, Jabarites, Qadarites, and Karramites.  Influence and Popularity  Kitab al-Sawad al-A'zam (The Book of the Great Masses) enshrined Hanafism in Transoxiana during the reign of the influential Samanids. As a result of the acceptance and influence of this statement of belief, the Turkic tribes north of Transoxiana were converted to Hanafism, including the Oghuz Turks, who would eventually become the great Seljuk rulers of Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Anatolia during the 11th to 13th centuries.

She is Professor Emerita in Language Education at Aston University (UK) and Professor of TESOL at the University of New South Wales (Australia). The TESOL International Association named her one of the '50 at 50', leaders who had made a significant contribution to TESOL in its first 50 years.  Biography  Burns was born and educated in Wales, UK. She received a Bachelor of Arts with Honors in English Literature from the University of Wales (1966); PhD, Macquarie University (1994); and Master of Education, also from Macquarie University (1996). She was formerly the Associate Director of the National Centre for English Language Teaching and Research (NCELTR), the Commonwealth Government's Key Research Centre for the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) (2000-2005), Director of the Applied Linguistics and Language in Education (ALLE) Research Centre, Macquarie University (2005–2010), and Dean of Linguistics and Psychology at Macquarie University (2000–2005). Currently she holds named chair appointments and distinguished professor appointments at several academic institutions in the UK, Australia, and Hong Kong. She also has been a Visiting Professor in New Zealand, Sweden, Japan and Thailand. Some other recent appointments include Academic Adviser for the Applied Linguistics Series, Oxford University Press (2012–present), chair of the TESOL Research Standing Committee (2009–2012), Chair and Editor for the AILA Applied Linguistics Series (AALS) (2014–2016) and Senior Consultant to Cengage_National Geographic.  Contribution to linguistics  Burns has published extensively in the field of TESOL on the teaching of speaking and grammar from a genre/Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) perspective. She is internationally known for her pioneering work in action research for language teachers, many of whom have focused on genre-based pedagogy in EAP/ESP. = SFL/genre theory = Burns' edited book with Caroline Coffin, Analysing English in a global context (2001, Routledge), was part of a Masters in Education and Masters in Applied Linguistics Program offered respectively by the Open University (UK), and Macquarie University (Australia). It was adopted extensively by other university programs also as a book of readings. In addition, with Helen Joyce, she adapted the three part Teaching-Learning Cycle (Callaghan and Rothery 1988) to a four part cycle relevant to TESOL (Hammond et al, 1992). With Jenny Hammond and Helen de Silva Joyce, she conducted two national AMEP projects on the teaching of speaking from a genre/SFL perspective in language classrooms. = Action research = Burns' books Collaborative action research for English language teachers (1999, CUP) and Doing action research: A guide for practitioners (2010, Routledge) are widely cited in the field of language teacher education. Her work in this area has had a major impact on the growth of the concept of language teacher research. Much of the action research she has conducted with teachers in Australia has included research on genre-based pedagogy/text-based syllabus design and the applications of SFL in the language classroom. She is much admired for her mentorship and engagement with teachers in action research: \\"her mentorship on the English Australia Action Research Project has helped front-line teachers change their attitudes and approaches in fundamental ways\\" (English Australia Journal 2017).Burns, Anne. Ten questions for Anne Burns [online]. English Australia Journal, Vol. 33, No. 1, 2017: 70-75.  Awards and distinctions  Since 2010, she has been a consultant through English Australia and Cambridge Assessment English to the English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) sector for their annual Action Research in ELICOS Program. In 2013, this program won an International Education Association of Australia award for best practice/innovation. In 2019, English Australia established an annual award, The Anne Burns Action Research Grant, to acknowledge an ELICOS institution that has taken up or integrated action research as part of their curriculum or staff professional development program.

It is an adaptation of the 1924 short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\", written by Richard Connell, with a plot that follows a big-game hunter who invites employees from a modeling agency to his estate, where he hunts them. The film stars Richard Smedley, Lori Rose, Vincent Stevens, Sandy Dempsey, Barbara Mills, and Norman Fields. The Suckers was filmed in the Bronson Canyon area of California over the course of three days, and was released in the United States in 1972. The only surviving print of the film, from a 1976 re-release, appears to contain at least two instances of missing footage.

The film's budget is estimated to have been around $30,000, and the crew was reportedly made up of \\"less than ten\\" people. According to director Stu Segall, the film was \\"very cheaply made\\", with the crew making around $50 a day and the cast members making around $150. During filming one day, actor Norman Fields swallowed a bee before he was able to finish his scenes. He was taken to a hospital and returned to the set several hours later.

An important facet to how telomeres function in these roles is their involvement in cell cycle regulation.  Telomere shortening in eukaryotic cells during the cell cycle  Because eukaryotic chromosomes are linear and because DNA replication by DNA polymerase requires the presence of an RNA primer that is later degraded, eukaryotic cells face the end-replication problem. This problem makes eukaryotic cells unable to copy the last few bases on the 3’ end of the template DNA strand, leading to chromosome—and, therefore, telomere—shortening every S phase. Measurements of telomere lengths across a variety of cell types in people at various ages suggest that this gradual chromosome shortening results in a gradual reduction in telomere length at a rate of approximately 25 nucleotides per year. The mechanism of telomere shortening is detailed in the main page on telomeres.  Telomeres as cell cycle enablers and regulators  The telomere-shelterin complexes that cap all eukaryotic chromosomes ensure that healthy cells can progress through the cell cycle by preventing the cellular DNA damage response from identifying chromosome ends as double-stranded breaks (DSBs). Without a protective cap, chromosome ends would appear identical to intrachromosomal DSBs. These DSBs activate a DNA damage response pathway that halts the cell cycle until the breaks are repaired. This checkpoint pathway is initiated in S. cerevisiae by recruitment of protein kinases Mec1 and Tel1 and in mammals by recruitment of protein kinases ATR and ATM. Regarding DSB repair, eukaryotes generally use two strategies: non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), which involves rapid reattachment of the broken ends; and homologous recombination (HR), which involves the use of a homologous DNA sequence to repair the break. Because HR requires a homologous sequence, its use is restricted to S/G2 phase. (Interestingly, as with many other aspects of the cell cycle, cyclin-dependent kinases are responsible for downregulating NHEJ during S/G2 phase to ensure use of the more accurate HR.) As shown in Figure 1A, telomere-shelterin complexes contain motifs that inhibit the DNA damage checkpoint, NHEJ, and HR. Initial work on the role of telomere-bound protein complexes in S. cerevisiae elucidated the mechanism by which these complexes prevent checkpoint activation and DSB repair of chromosome ends. The two major protein complexes that bind to telomeric DNA in S. cerevisiae are (1) the Cdc13-Stn1-Ten1 (CST) complex, which binds the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) of the 3’ G-rich overhang at the end of the telomere, and (2) the Rif1-Rif2-Rap1 complex, which binds the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) preceding the 3’ overhang. The CST complex and Rif1 prevent Mec1 recruitment, thereby preventing checkpoint activation. Meanwhile, Rif2 and Rap1 inhibit NHEJ: knocking out Rif2 or Rap1 results in longer telomeres as measured by PCR, indicating that NHEJ occurred. These knockout strains (unlike strains lacking functional CST or Rif1) continue to cycle, further suggesting that Rif2 and Rap1 are not involved in inhibiting checkpoint activation. Analogously, proteins that bind to human telomeres as part of the shelterin complex enable cell cycle progress and prevent erroneous DSB repair. POT1 protein binds to ssDNA, prevents checkpoint activation through inhibiting ATR recruitment, and prevents HR; RAP1, a GTPase, binds to dsDNA and prevents HR; and TRF2 protein (also known as TERF2) binds to dsDNA, prevents checkpoint activation through inhibiting ATM recruitment, and prevents NHEJ. TRF2 is unique among these proteins in its role in the formation and maintenance of T-loops: lariat structures formed by the folding of the ssDNA overhang back onto the dsDNA. T-loops may further inhibit the binding of checkpoint activation proteins. Figure 1. (A) Telomere-bound proteins involved in preventing the activation of the DNA damage response checkpoint and of DSB repair mechanisms in S. cerevisiae (top) and in humans (bottom). (B) Overview of the normal function of telomere-shelterin complexes and the pathways activated by telomere shortening. As telomeres shorten, as a natural consequence of cell division or due to other factors, such as oxidative stress, shelterin proteins lose the ability to bind to telomeric DNA. When telomeres reach a critically short length, there are no longer enough shelterin proteins to inhibit checkpoint activation, although NHEJ and HR generally remain inhibited at this point. This loss of inhibition is one reason why telomere shortening causes senescence (Figure 1B). Future work in this area should involve clarifying the signaling pathway that connects checkpoint activation and senescence. For example, researchers should investigate the mechanism by which proteins involved in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway, such as p53, are activated by shortened telomeric ends.  Telomeres and cell cycle deregulation  Almost all cancer cells have shortened telomeres. This may seem counter-intuitive, as short telomeres should activate the ATR/ATM DNA damage checkpoint and thereby prevent division. Resolving the question of why cancer cells have short telomeres led to the development of a two-stage model for how cancer cells subvert telomeric regulation of the cell cycle. First, the DNA damage checkpoint must be inactivated to allow cells to continue dividing even when telomeres pass the critical length threshold. This requirement follows not only from the discussion above but also from in vivo evidence showing the function of this checkpoint in precancerous lesions and its dysfunction in late-stage tumors. Second, to survive after disabling the DNA damage checkpoint, precancerous cells must activate mechanisms to extend their telomeres. As a result of the continued division past the point of normal senescence, the telomeres of these cells become too short to prevent NHEJ(Non Homologous End Joining) and HR(Homologous Recombination) of chromosome ends, causing a state known as crisis. The application of these DSB (double strand breaks)repair mechanisms to chromosome ends leads to genetic instability, and while this instability can promote carcinogenesis, it induces apoptosis if experienced for too long. To survive and replicate, precancerous cells must stabilize their telomere lengths. This occurs through telomerase activation or the activation of a telomere-recombination pathway (i.e., the ALT pathway). Thus, cancer cells have short telomeres because they progress through an intermediate stage of telomere shortening—caused by division after DNA damage checkpoint inactivation—before enabling mechanisms for maintaining telomere length. Since the late 1990s, researchers have proposed using telomerase inhibitors as cancer treatments. While such inhibitors have been seriously considered for cancer therapy since the late 2000s, they are not commonly used. Two concerns with applying telomerase inhibitors in cancer treatment are that effective treatment requires continuous, long-term drug application and that off-target effects are common. For example, the telomerase inhibitor imetelstat, first proposed in 2003, has been held up in clinical trials due to hematological toxicity. Despite these concerns, the development of telomerase- based cancer treatments remains an active research area.  Cell cycle timing of telomere elongation  Although telomerase activation does not occur during the cell cycle of normal somatic human cells, the association between telomere elongation (especially elongation by telomerase) and tumor development emphasizes the importance of understanding when such elongation can occur during the cell cycle. Work with S. cerevisiae has identified telomerase activity as restricted to late S phase. Researchers generated S. cerevisiae strains with galactose-inducible shortened telomeres. They then used α factor to block cells with induced short telomeres in late G1 phase and measured the change in telomere length when the cells were released under a variety of conditions. They found that when the cells were released and concurrently treated with nocodazole, a G2/M phase cell cycle inhibitor, telomere length increased for the first few hours and then remained constant. In comparison, when cells were released and allowed to cycle, telomere length increased linearly with time. These data suggest that telomere elongation occurs only in S phase. Additional experiments with greater time resolution support this hypothesis and narrow the timeframe to late S phase. Researchers tied telomere elongation in these experiments to telomerase activity by observing that in an S. cerevisiae strain with a dysfunctional ALT pathway telomere elongation still occurs.

St. Thomas moved to its present site on Whitney Avenue in 1939.  History  On February 24, 1848, a meeting was held by sixteen lay Episcopalians in New Haven, Connecticut to discuss the opening of a third Episcopal church in the city. The first services were held in a room that belonged to Center Church on April 23, 1848, where they remained until 1849. The rector purchased a lot on Elm Street that year, and began construction of a temporary chapel. Five months later, the first services were held in the chapel on August 12, 1849. The congregation decided that a new, larger church would be built on the site of the existing chapel, and the last services in the chapel were held on March 12, 1854. One month later, the cornerstone of the new church was laid, with Bishop John Williams in attendance. In the meantime, services were held in Brewster Hall. The completed church was consecrated on April 19, 1855. It was constructed in the English Gothic Revival style out of Portland stone. A parish house was not built until 1888. The cornerstone was laid on May 21, and the building was dedicated on February 3, 1889. In 1923, the rector proposed that the church relocate to another part of New Haven, as since the founding of the church, Elm Street had become entirely commercial. The congregation purchased a lot on Whitney Avenue, between Odgen and Cliff Streets in 1923. There, a new parish house was constructed in 1931. A new church was constructed there, and consecrated on October 8, 1939.

However, before the commendation order could arrive to any of his selected officials, the emperor and Luoyang were captured by Liu Yao during the Disaster of Yongjia(五年，帝遣使拜車騎大將軍、開府儀同三司。榮命未至，而劉曜攻陷長安，遷晉帝于平陽。) Annals of the Sixteen Kingdoms, Volume 7. After the emperor's capture, Wang Jun chose an unknown candidate as the new Crown Prince and claimed that he has an imperial edict to grant appointments. He appointed himself as Prefect of Master of Writings and gave a few other officials new offices, even appointing the future Emperor Yuan of Jin, Sima Rui as Grand General(秋，七月，王浚設壇告類，立皇太子，布告天下，稱受中詔承制封拜，備置百官，列署征、鎭，以荀藩爲太尉，琅邪王睿爲大將軍。浚自領尚書令，以裴憲及其壻棗嵩爲尚書，以田徽爲兗州刺史，李惲爲青州刺史。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 87. The same year, Wang Jun fought with Liu Kun once more. As Bingzhou's population declined, Liu Kun sent his kinsman Liu Xi (劉希) to gather men from Wang Jun's territory in the commanderies of Dai, Shanggu and Guangning (廣寧郡, in present-day Hebei and Beijing). When Wang Jun discovered the intrusion, he was furious. He sent Hu Ju (胡矩) and Duan Jilujuan (Duan Wuwuchen's son who succeeded him as chieftain of the Duan tribe after his father's death some time between 310 and 311) to deal with Liu Xi and the two men killed him in battle(劉琨長於招懷而短於撫御，一日之中，雖歸者數千，而去者亦相繼。琨遣子遵請兵於代公猗盧，又遣族人高陽內史希合衆於中山，幽州所統代郡、上谷、廣寧之民多歸之，衆至三萬。王浚怒，遣燕相胡矩督諸軍，與遼西公段疾陸眷共攻希，殺之，驅略三郡士女而去。疾陸眷，務勿塵之子也。猗盧遣其子六脩將兵助琨戍新興。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 87. Downfall and death = Losing support from the Xianbei and Wuhuan = Although Wang Jun was initially successful against Shi Le, the tide shifted in favor of Shi Le in 312. After Han's city of Yuanxiang (苑鄕, in present-day Hebei and Beijing) surrendered to Wang Jun, Shi Le laid siege on the city. In response, Wang Jun sent Wang Chang (王昌) and Duan Jilujuan to attack Shi Le's base at Xiangguo. However, Duan Jilujuan's cousin, Duan Mopei was captured in battle. Shi Le used this as an opportunity to win over the Duan tribe to his side. He sent Jilujuan gifts and treated Mopei with courtesy. Jilujuan was charmed with Shi's actions and withdrew his troop.(勒質末柸，遣使求和於疾陸眷，疾陵眷許之。文鴦諫曰：「今以末柸一人之故而縱垂亡之虜，得無爲王彭祖所怨，招後患乎！」疾陸眷不從，復以鎧馬金銀賂勒，且以末柸三弟爲質而請末柸。諸將皆勸勒殺末柸，勒曰：「遼西鮮卑健國也，與我素無仇讎，爲王浚所使耳。今殺一人而結一國之怨，非計也。歸之，必深德我，不復爲浚用矣。」乃厚以金帛報之，遣石虎與疾陸眷盟于渚陽，結爲兄弟。疾陸眷引歸，王昌不能獨留，亦引兵還薊。勒召末柸，與之燕飲，誓爲父子，遣還遼西。末柸在塗，日南嚮而拜者三。由是段氏專心附勒，王浚之勢遂衰。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 88 Later, Shi Le led a few skirmishes against Wang Jun and killed Wang's Inspector of Jizhou and Inspector of Qingzhou on two separate occasions. When Wang Jun was planning to attack Shi Le again the same year, Duan Jilujuan refused to comply with Wang. Wang Jun was insulted by Jilujuan's reaction, and riled up their rival Xianbei tribes, the Tuoba and Murong to attack the Duan but they repelled the attackers. (王浚使棗嵩督諸軍屯易水，召段疾陸眷，欲與之共擊石勒，疾陸眷不至。浚怒，以重幣賂拓跋猗盧，幷檄慕容廆等共討疾陸眷。猗盧遣右賢王六脩將兵會之，爲疾陸眷所敗。廆遣慕容翰攻段氏，取徒河、新城，至陽樂，聞六脩敗而還，翰因留鎭徒河，壁青山。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 88 Losing the support of his powerful Xianbei allies, Wang Jun also began to lose the favour of his Wuhuan troops to Shi Le. Consecutive droughts, floods and locust infestations caused poor crop yields which weakened his armies and left his populace discontent. Furthermore, Wang Jun's poor administration in contrast with Murong Hui's benevolent rule in Liaodong convinced many to migrate over to the latter’s territory from the former.(初，中國士民避亂者，多北依王浚，浚不能存撫，又政法不立，士民往往復去之。段氏兄弟專尚武勇，不禮士大夫。唯慕容廆政事脩明，愛重人物，故士民多歸之。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 88 = Capture by Shi Le = Despite the setbacks, Wang Jun only became more arrogant and prouder. Subscribing to a prophecy that the one to replace Han bears the name 'High Road', Wang Jun considered taking the imperial title for himself in 313. He had many of his officials executed for criticizing his imperial ambition. The gentry was disturbed by Wang Jun violent impulses and distanced themselves from him. Wang Jun also began to neglect political affairs, leaving them in the hands of his corrupted and heinous officials such as Zao Song (棗嵩), Zhu Shuo (朱碩) and Tan Heng (貪橫). The three men's policies were so troublesome that many of Wang Jun's people fled to the Xianbei.(王浚以其父字處道，自謂應「當塗高」之讖，謀稱尊號。前勃海太守劉亮、北海太守王摶、司空掾高柔切諫，浚皆殺之。燕國霍原，志節清高，屢辭徵辟。浚以尊號事問之，原不答。浚誣原與羣盜通，殺而梟其首。於是士民駭怨，而浚矜豪日甚，不親政事，所任皆苛刻小人，棗嵩、朱碩，貪橫尤甚。北州謠曰：「府中赫赫，朱丘伯；十囊、五囊，入棗郎。」調發殷煩，下不堪命，多叛入鮮卑。從事韓咸監護柳城，盛稱慕容廆能接納士民，欲以諷浚；浚怒，殺之。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 88 Hearing Wang Jun's situation, Shi Le wondered if he should strike at him. At the advice of Zhang Bin, Shi Le pretended to appear weak, sending gifts and offering his surrender to Wang Jun through letter in 313. As Wang Jun was in need of a talented figure after having lost most of his subordinates at the time, he was delighted by his surrender and accepted it without a doubt.(浚始者者唯恃鮮卑、烏桓以爲強，旣而皆叛之。加以蝗旱連年，兵勢益弱。石勒欲襲之，未知虛實，將遣使覘之，參佐請用羊祜、陸抗故事，致書於浚。勒以問張賓，賓曰：「浚名爲晉臣，實欲廢晉自立，但患四海英雄莫之從耳；其欲得將軍，猶項羽之欲得韓信也。將軍威振天下，今卑辭厚禮，折節事之，猶懼不信，況爲羊、陸之亢敵乎！夫謀人而使人覺其情，難以得志矣。」勒曰：「善！」十二月，勒遣舍人王子春、董肇多齎珍寶，奉表於浚曰：「勒本小胡，遭世饑亂，流離屯厄，竄命冀州，竊相保聚以救性命。今晉祚淪夷，中原無主；殿下州鄕貴望，四海所宗，爲帝王者，非公復誰！勒所以捐軀起兵，誅討暴亂者，正爲殿下驅除爾。伏願殿下應天順人，早登皇祚。勒奉戴殿下如天地父母，殿下察勒微心，亦當視之如子也。」又遺棗嵩書，厚賂之。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89 To show his loyalty, Shi Le declined an offer from Wang Jun's general You Tong (游統) to rebel against Wang.(游綸兄統，爲浚司馬，鎭范陽，遣使私附於勒；勒斬其使以送浚。浚雖不罪統，益信勒爲忠誠，無復疑矣。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 88 The next year, when Wang Jun's envoy went to Shi Le's headquarters in Xiangguo, Shi Le hid his strongest troops to further give the implications that he was weaker than Wang. When presented with an elk tail by Wang Jun, Shi Le pretended to be afraid to grasp and instead hung it on a wall to show his respect to him. Finally, Shi Le sent a petition to visit Wang Jun intending to submit and hail him as emperor later that year.(壬辰，王子春等及王浚使者至襄國，石勒匿其勁卒、精甲，羸師虛府以示之，北面拜使者而受書。浚遺勒麈尾，勒陽不敢執，懸之於壁，朝夕拜之，曰：「我不得見王公，見其所賜，如見公也。」復遣董肇奉表于浚，期以三月中旬親詣幽州奉上尊號；亦脩牋于棗嵩，求幷州牧、廣平公。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89 With the petition, Wang Jun was ready to accept Shi Le into his ranks. Before arriving at Jicheng, Wang Jun killed You Tong's brother You Lun (游綸) when passing at Bairen to prevent the plan from leaking. Shi Le also sent letter to Wang Jun's rival Liu Kun, asking permission to attack Wang to which Liu allowed.(遂以火宵行，至柏人，殺主簿游綸，以其兄統在范陽，恐泄軍謀故也。遣使奉牋送質于劉琨，自陳罪惡，請討浚以自效。琨大喜，移檄州郡，稱「己與猗盧方議討勒，勒走伏無地，求拔幽都以贖罪。今便當遣六脩南襲平陽，除僭僞之逆類，降知死之逋羯，順天副民，翼奉皇家，斯乃曩年積誠靈祐之所致也！」) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89 As Shi Le drew closer, Wang Jun's generals and advisers insisted him to immediately attack Shi but Wang scolded them and threatened to execute anyone who disobeys him. Once he arrived, Wang Jun ordered the gatekeepers to let him in. Shi Le flooded the city with cattle and sheep seemingly as offerings to Wang Jun but his true intention was to block the exits so that Wang could not escape. Wang Jun began to panic when he realized this but it was too late. Shi Le entered the city, where he let loose his soldiers and sacked the place.(三月，勒軍達易水，王浚督護孫緯馳遣白浚，將勒兵拒之，游統禁之。浚將佐皆曰：「胡貪而無信，必有詭計，請擊之。」浚怒曰：「石公來，正欲奉戴我耳；敢言擊者斬！」衆不敢復言。浚設饗以待之。壬申，勒晨至薊，叱門者開門；猶疑有伏兵，先驅牛羊千頭，聲言上禮，實欲塞諸街巷。浚始懼，或坐或起。勒旣入城，縱兵大掠，浚左右請禦之，浚猶不許。勒升其聽事，浚乃走出堂皇，勒衆執之。勒召浚妻，與之並坐，執浚立於前。浚罵曰：「胡奴調乃公，何凶逆如此！」勒曰：「公位冠元台，手握強兵，坐觀本朝傾覆，曾不救援，乃欲自尊爲天子，非凶逆乎！又委任姦貪，殘虐百姓，賊害忠良，毒徧燕土，此誰之罪也！」使其將王洛生以五百騎送浚于襄國。浚自投于水，束而出之，斬于襄國市。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89 Wang Jun retreated to his chambers but was eventually arrested along with his wife by Shi Le's men. When brought face to face with Shi Le, Wang scolded him and said, \\"How dare a barbarian like you make a fool of me? What wicked treason is this?\\" Shi Le replied: = Aftermath = Wang Jun was sent to Xiangguo to be executed. On the way, Wang Jun attempted suicide by drowning in a river, but the guards managed to restrain him. Once at Xiangguo, Wang Jun was beheaded in the marketplace(三月，勒軍達易水，王浚督護孫緯馳遣白浚，將勒兵拒之，游統禁之。浚將佐皆曰：「胡貪而無信，必有詭計，請擊之。」浚怒曰：「石公來，正欲奉戴我耳；敢言擊者斬！」衆不敢復言。浚設饗以待之。壬申，勒晨至薊，叱門者開門；猶疑有伏兵，先驅牛羊千頭，聲言上禮，實欲塞諸街巷。浚始懼，或坐或起。勒旣入城，縱兵大掠，浚左右請禦之，浚猶不許。勒升其聽事，浚乃走出堂皇，勒衆執之。勒召浚妻，與之並坐，執浚立於前。浚罵曰：「胡奴調乃公，何凶逆如此！」勒曰：「公位冠元台，手握強兵，坐觀本朝傾覆，曾不救援，乃欲自尊爲天子，非凶逆乎！又委任姦貪，殘虐百姓，賊害忠良，毒徧燕土，此誰之罪也！」使其將王洛生以五百騎送浚于襄國。浚自投于水，束而出之，斬于襄國市。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89 and his head was presented to the Han emperor Liu Cong as a gift.(勒至襄國，遣使奉王浚首獻捷于漢；漢以勒爲大都督、督陝東諸軍事、驃騎大將軍、東單于，增封十二郡；勒固辭，受二郡而已。) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 89 After his death, many of Wang Jun's underlings were also executed by Shi Le.

History In 1980 Larry Fishman made a prototype acoustic pickup in his basement. By 1981 Fishman had taken orders for pickups from the Guild Guitar Company. In 1982 the C.F. Martin Guitar Company called to order Fishman pickups. With the Martin order, the Fishman company rented a larger manufacturing space. They began making pickups for other music instruments: banjos, mandolins, violins, cellos, basses. The Fishman company has produced amplifiers and other guitar-related equipment since its beginning in 1981. They have been known for producing high-quality acoustic amplifiers. =Fishman Fluence pickups= In 2012 the Fishman company began working on a new pickup for guitars. They began designing a pickup that uses circuit boards. With circuit-boards, the guitar pickup could be programmed. Most guitar pickups are made with wire coiled around a magnet: the Fishman Fluence pickup is a solid core (2 Two 48-layer circuit boards) with a conventional magnet. The Fluence pickup represented a complete change in the electric guitar pickup. They called the new pickup Fishman Fluence. Fishman used techniques previously used in the aerospace and telecommunications sectors to make their pickup. In addition Fishman hired Ching-Yu Lin, Ph.D. to analyze and charge the magnets used in their pickups. The company was able to control the consistency of the magnets, and the stacked solid core parts of their pickups to make each pickup sound the same. By 2014 Fishman was manufacturing the Fluence pickup. Soon Fishman was designing pickups for guitar makers. They manufacture pickups for Paul Reed Smith guitars. Fishman designed an acoustic guitar pickup for the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. ESP Guitars sells guitars with Fishman Fluence pickups installed. Gibson installs Fishman pickups in its G-45 Series acoustic guitars. in 2019 Ibanez Guitars began selling a guitar model with Fishman pickups.

He was a partisan of the Plantagenets in their conflict with the French crown and held fiefs from them. A younger son, he governed the County of Perche on behalf of his father and brother during their absence on crusade. He himself joined the Fourth Crusade in 1202 and travelled to the Holy Land. Afterwards, he went to the Latin Empire and was appointed duke of Philadelphia in Asia Minor in 1204. He died in battle against the Bulgars. Early life Born before 1173, Stephen was the second of five sons of Count Rotrou IV of Perche and his wife Matilda, daughter of Theobald, count of Blois and Chartres. He was named after his uncle, Stephen, archbishop of Palermo. His younger brothers entered the church. His father and older brother, Geoffrey III, joined the Third Crusade in 1189. During their absence, Stephen shared the administration of the county with the seneschal Warin of Lonray. After Geoffrey's return in 1192 or 1193, Stephen accompanied him to England. It has sometimes been thought that Stephen and Geoffrey divided the Perche between themselves, but this is based on a misreading of a document of 1202. Around 1200, Stephen gave land he possessed at Arponnel and in the forested gâtines (wasteland) between Chartres and Thiron-Gardais to the Knights Templar. Anglo-Norman service By the early 1190s, Stephen held rights to a portion of the comital revenues of the manors at Rivray, Montlandon and Nonvilliers, the mills at La Poterie and the salt works at Nogent-le-Rotrou. By 1195, he had entered the service of King Richard I of England, who was also Duke of Normandy. He was receiving arrears of payments from the Exchequer of Normandy as late as 1200. At some point prior to 1198, Stephen was granted temporary control of the lands of Fulk of Aunou in the Hiémois. In August 1198, Stephen was with Richard at Orival. A little later in 1198, Richard granted Stephen a money fief and Stephen fought for Richard in the war with France that year. In July 1200, King John of England, Richard's successor, appointed Stephen castellan of Châteauneuf-sur-Sarthe in the County of Anjou. Stephen, however, had to give up the royal grant of lands he had received at Chambois, where he was reaping the profits of a Jewish moneylender he had brought in from the Île-de-France. These lands were passed on to William Marshal. In the autumn of 1201, when King John returned to Anjou after a circuit of the Duchy of Aquitaine, Stephen stood as a guarantor of the settlement reached between John and one of his most powerful Angevin vassals, Juhel III of Mayenne, who had supported John's rival for the throne, Arthur of Brittany, in 1199. Fourth Crusade In 1200, Stephen's brother Geoffrey joined the Fourth Crusade. He spent much of the next two years preparing, but he died just before Easter 1202. Among his pious acts of preparation was the grant of a charter to Le Mans Cathedral promising comital protection for its property at Courgenard in the Perche. Stephen swore to respect Geoffrey's promise to Le Mans. He had committed to the crusade by January 1202, when he mortgaged his properties at Langeais to cover his expenses. Geoffrey, on his deathbed at Le Theil, entrusted command of the Percheron contingent to Stephen. In May 1202, King John stood as surety for a loan to Stephen from the Templars and Hospitallers. During the interval between his brother's death and his departure, Stephen seems to have governed the county of Perche again. After his departure, Geoffrey's widow Matilda took over the regency for her minor son, Thomas. In June, Stephen and the Percheron contingent joined the main French force massing at Chartres. He made several religious bequests before departing,For an annotated list of all Stephen's surviving acts, see Thompson 1995, pp. 203–204. including the endowment of a memorial requiem mass for himself to be celebrated in Chartres Cathedral annually on the anniversary of his death. In June, he also confirmed his sister-in-law's endowment of an annual requiem for his brother. He probably travelled in the company of his cousin Count Louis I of Blois. Stephen made the rendezvous at Venice in October 1202, but he was physically incapable of leaving with the army. His ship, the Violet, sank shortly after sailing and it is unclear if Stephen was injured in the wreck or if he had not been aboard because of an illness. In this way he avoided the controversial siege of Zara in November. In March 1203 he decided not to rejoin the main army and went to southern Italy with Rotrou of Montfort and Yves of La Jaille. From there they sailed directly to the Holy Land, possibly in the same flotilla or ship as Simon of Montfort. Baron in Greece Only after the sack of Constantinople did Stephen rejoin the army to help defend the conquests. He returned from the Holy Land with Renaud of Montmirail. In 1204, after the partition of the Byzantine Empire by the crusaders, the new emperor Baldwin I granted Stephen the duchy of Philadelphia in Asia Minor as an imperial fief. It is not likely that much or any of this fief was under crusader control at the time. Nevertheless, Stephen distributed fiefs to his own vassals within his duchy. The grant of a large and autonomous fief, as connoted by the term \\"duchy\\", is an indication that Stephen was considered among the first rank of crusaders. The actual ruler of Philadelphia, Theodore Mangaphas, was defeated by the imperial regent Henry of Flanders at the battle of Adramyttion on 19 March 1205, bringing at least part of the region briefly under crusader control. Stephen was one of twelve barons who sat on the council that advised the emperor. In Constantinople, he seems to have rejoined the following of Louis of Blois. On 3 April 1205, he was at the siege of Adrianople, which had been occupied by Tsar Kaloyan of Bulgaria. He joined Louis and Renaud of Montmirail on a foraging expedition and, on 14 April, all three were killed while pursuing a Cuman force. According to the necrology of Chartres, however, his requiem was celebrated on 17 April. Stephen's participation in the crusade and his brief career in Greece is narrated in Geoffrey of Villehardouin's chronicle and the Devastatio Constantinopolitana.
