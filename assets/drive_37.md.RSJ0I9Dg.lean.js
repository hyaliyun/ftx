It entered service in 1885. The light was deactivated in 1986 but the tower still serves as a day beacon. Roter Sand Lighthouse was the first building ever to be erected directly on the sea floor. On 1 October 2010, the structure was awarded the title \\"Historical Monument of Engineering in Germany\\" (Historisches Wahrzeichen der Ingenieurbaukunst in Deutschland) by the Federal Chamber of Engineers.  Description  Including the foundation, Roter Sand Lighthouse is tall. At low tide, it measures above sea level. Its focal height is above mean high tide, while the tower as such is tall. The three oriel windows of the tower. The hoisted flag shows that guests are staying in the lighthouse over night. The foundation is cylindrical and protrudes from the sea at low tide. The tower above is conical. It is painted with red and white bands above a black base. The order of colours is white-red-white-red-white whereby the coloured section also marks the five floors inside the tower. The entrance is located at the lower rim of the lowest white band. The basement serves as a storage. A stairway leads from there to the sleeping room. Further up is the kitchen with a coal-heated oven, and a living and service room. The latter has three oriel windows, two of which have the same height as the room itself while the third one leads even higher. The oriels used to host minor lights and point towards North-west, South and North-east. From the service room, a balcony around the lantern can be reached via a stairway. However, it is not possible to walk all around the lantern because the higher oriel window blocks one part of the balcony. During the 1940s, the rooms used to be different with the inside of the black sector being accessible as storage. At the entrance level, there used to be the equipment for the generation of electrical power.  Tourism  Day trips to the lighthouse, from Bremerhaven via the vessel \\"Lev Taifun\\", can be taken in June, July, and August. Staying overnight is also possible.

It is found on the southern shoreline of Lake Lefroy. The location of the original townsite is on Kingswood Street, which runs at the rear of the Widgiemooltha Roadhouse. The Coolgardie-Esperance Hwy now bypasses the original townsite. In August 2015, the only evidence of the original township was the remains of the hotel. In the 1890s gold was discovered in the area and the townsite was gazetted in 1897 as Widgemooltha, the spelling being amended to the current form in 1944. In 1898 the town had a population of 112 (100 males and 12 females). The name of the town is Aboriginal in origin and is thought to be the name of a nearby hill and rock-hole. It is thought to be related to the beak of an emu. The goldfields around the area were home to the Golden Eagle nugget which was found in 1931 by Jim Larcombe. It weighed , the biggest nugget found in the history of Western Australian goldfields. The find sparked a gold fever and shortly afterward 1,000 men were working the field unearthing other reefs and nuggets. In 1956, Widgiemooltha had a small population. These included railway fettlers and their families (there were 4 fettler families, complete with children), Listers' Salt Works (now WA Salt Supply) employees, a schoolteacher, a shopkeeper and a few hotel staff.

He was a pastor of The Journey, a megachurch in St. Louis, Missouri, which he founded in 2002. He served as the chaplain to the St. Louis Cardinals and was the author of several books. A prominent figure within New Calvinism, he was the vice-president of the Acts 29 Network, an international church planting organization, and a council member of The Gospel Coalition.  Personal background  Patrick was born in Marion, Illinois. He became a Christian while in high school, where he was an all-conference, all-area catcher on the baseball team. After beginning a successful ministry in high school, he pursued pastoral training rather than a college baseball career. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in Bible and Biblical Languages from Southwest Baptist University (1994), graduated summa cum laude from Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary (M.Div., 1997), and received a Doctor of Ministry degree from Covenant Theological Seminary (2010). He married in 1993 and had four children.  Ministry  Patrick moved from suburban Kansas City, Missouri to St. Louis in 2002 to plant The Journey in the urban core. The church has seen unprecedented growth in the city of St. Louis and the broader metropolitan region. The Journey is now a multi-site ministry with 6 churches in Missouri and Illinois, including Patrick's hometown of Marion. The church has been scrutinized for its cultural engagement by the Missouri Baptist Convention and received national media attention regarding one of its outreach ministries, \\"Theology at the Bottleworks,\\" for being held at Schlafly Bottleworks, a brewery in Maplewood, MO. In his role as the chaplain to the St. Louis Cardinals, Patrick regularly led chapel services and Bible studies during the baseball season. He was present for the players either before or after home games. Shortly after the end of the 2013 season, Patrick officiated the wedding of Cardinals pitcher Shelby Miller. As a chaplain, Patrick was a part of Baseball Chapel, an international ministry recognized by Major and Minor League Baseball, which is responsible for the appointment and oversight of all team chapel leaders (over 500 throughout professional baseball). Patrick was a vice-president of the Acts 29 Network, and was a council member of The Gospel Coalition, a group of Reformed Evangelical leaders from around the United States, including D. A. Carson, Tim Keller, and John Piper. He has written for Christianity Today and The Leadership Journal, and contributed to The Resurgence blog. He has been interviewed by The Christian Post. He has also appeared on Fox & Friends, and has been discussed by The New York Times, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, and BBC News Online.  Removal from ministry  On April 13, 2016, it was announced that the Board of Elders of The Journey had removed Patrick from his position and required him to step down from all internal and external leadership positions. The reasons given were \\"pastoral misconduct\\" and a \\"historical pattern of sin\\". A letter from the elders made it clear that the misconduct did not involve adultery, but there was a violation of the \\"high standard for elders in marriage through inappropriate meetings, conversations, and phone calls with two women\\". In addition, the historical sins were listed and included lack of self-control, manipulation and lying, domineering, misuse of power, and refusal of personal accountability. The elders indicated that they had raised these issues with Patrick over a period of a few years, but he had repeatedly failed to address them.Letter to all attenders Patrick's name was removed from The Gospel Coalition's councilhttps://www.thegospelcoalition.org/about/council and the board of directors of the Acts 29 Network.http://www.acts29.com/about/ His disciplining was reported in the Christian press.http://www.christianitytoday.com/gleanings/2016/april/darrin-patrick- removed-acts-29-megachurch- journey.htmlhttp://www.christiantoday.com/article/megachurch.pastor.darrin.patrick.suspended.over.misconduct.and.historical.pattern.of.sin/83922.htm In a conference in Las Vegas, in 2017, Patrick talked about the lessons he learned in losing his church. https://media.arcchurches.com/2017/09/14/lessons-learned-from-losing-my- church/  Restoration to ministry  After a restoration process led by Seacoast Church Founding Pastor Greg Surratt, Patrick joined the staff of Seacoast in June 2017 as a teaching pastor. He cofounded The Pastors Collective podcast with Greg Surratt in 2019. Patrick led Enneagram intensives as a coach through Crosspoint Ministries. He also worked with The Association of Related Churches (ARC), coaching pastors on building a healthy culture.

The Squadron was activated again in 1973 to replace Operating Location F of the 630th Radar Squadron at Lake Charles AFS as part of the Southern Air Defense System (SADS). SADS had been established because of the inadequacy of the radar coverage to the south of the United States that had been dramatically illustrated whan a Cuban MiG-17 went undetected before it landed at Homestead AFB,Leonard, p. 172 and two years later, an An-24 similarly arrived unannounced at New Orleans International Airport. As a result, ADC established SADS with the squadron operating a manual control center at the Houston ARTCC and added radars to supplement the existing Federal Aviation Administration coverage in the area.

Within 18 months of establishing Halifax, the British also took firm control of peninsula Nova Scotia by building fortifications in all the major Acadian communities: present-day Windsor (Fort Edward); Grand Pre (Fort Vieux Logis) and Chignecto (Fort Lawrence).

He was accused of being a pagan and was executed. The main sources about him are Syriac chronicles, in particular the Chronicle of Michael the Syrian and the Chronicle of 1234.. The source of both accounts was the lost chronicle of Dionysius Telmaharensis.. Biography Acindynus was reportedly a governor of Carrhae (Harran) in Osroene. The term used, \\"hegemon\\", typically implies a civil governor, but the civil governors of Osroene were usually stationed at Edessa. Acindynus was probably a military commander stationed in the secondary city. The Syriac accounts agree that Emperor Maurice himself authorized Stephen, Bishop of Harran, to persecute the pagans of his area. During the persecution, the accused were given a choice between a forced conversion to Christianity and death. Acindynus was known to be a Christian, but his scribe/secretary Iyarios (elsewhere called Honorius) accused him of secretly practicing paganism. Stephen proceeded to have Acindynus executed, either by impalement or crucifixion. The deceased governor was succeeded by Iyarios. Iyarios Michael the Syrian offers some additional information on Iyarios. According to his account, Iyarios was an orphan abandoned by his parents. He believed the birthplace of the man to be in Armenia Prima (First Armenia). Iyarios was raised and educated in the vicinity of Nicopolis, trained to be a scribe. Interpretation The events can be dated to circa 589. John Liebeschuetz connects the narrative to a wave of religious persecutions which started in 578. Emperor Justinian I (r. 527‚Äì565) had initiated the search for crypto-pagans among the ranks of the Christians. But the enforcement of his laws on the subject was \\"spasmodic\\". In other words, sudden bursts of activity in persecuting pagans alternated with periods where nobody was actively seeking suspects. In 578, the Byzantine authorities had received reports on an impending revolt of crypto-pagans in Baalbek. Theophilus, an official who had previously faced revolts by Jews and Samaritans, was tasked with locating said crypto-pagans. Suspects were arrested, interrogated under torture, and forced to name other \\"pagans\\". Soon, Theophilus had lists of names, including prominent citizens spread throughout the eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire. The persecution spread to the rest of these provinces.. Theophilus himself had visited Edessa in the course of his investigations. He claimed to have interrupted a sacrifice to Zeus taking place within the city. He proceeded to arrest Anatolius and Theodore, respectively the provincial governor of Osroene and his second-in-command. They were transported first to Antioch for their interrogation and secondly to Constantinople for their trial. Liebeschuetz sees these activities as a regular \\"witch-hunt\\", where everyone is a suspect. He points out that many of the \\"pagans\\" executed were probably actual Christians. Liebeschuetz and other modern historians point to the involvement of the Monophysites in these events. The last reign favorable to them was that of Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491‚Äì518). Since 518, they were seen as heretics, with \\"their churches and monasteries ... liable to be confiscated, and their bishops to be exiled and imprisoned\\". Yet they participated enthusiastically in the search for crypto- pagans. They probably saw it as an opportunity to discredit their enemies, since many of the \\"suspects\\" happened to be prominent Chalcedonians. For example, Gregory, Patriarch of Antioch (term 571‚Äì593) was accused of participating in a human sacrifice.

They were the first major artist to hold a concert in the city after the end of the Bosnian War. Approximately 45,000 fans attended the show. The band first became involved with Sarajevo in 1993 on their Zoo TV Tour; approached by aid worker Bill Carter about bringing attention to the Siege of Sarajevo, the band conducted nightly satellite transmissions with Bosnians during their shows. These link-ups were the subject of criticism from journalists for mixing entertainment with human tragedy. Although the war made it impractical for U2 to visit Sarajevo at the time, they vowed to eventually play a concert in the city. After the conflict ended in November 1995, they made arrangements to visit Sarajevo, and with help from United Nations ambassadors and peacekeeping troops, they scheduled and played the concert in 1997. The band offered to hold a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but it was requested that they stage a full PopMart concert. The performance consequently featured the tour's extravagant stage, and the band played a set list typical of the tour. The show brought together people of different ethnicities who had previously clashed during the war, and train service was temporarily resumed to allow concertgoers to attend. Among the songs played was \\"Miss Sarajevo\\", written by U2 and Brian Eno about a beauty pageant held during the war. Although the band were displeased with their performance and lead vocalist Bono had vocal difficulties, the concert was well received and was credited with improving morale among Bosnians. The members of U2 consider the show to be among their proudest moments. The concert was lauded by Bosnians. Background =War in Sarajevo= Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was composed of six constituent republics: Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. In 1991, Croatia, and Slovenia seceded from Yugoslavia. Bosnia-Herzegovina‚Äîa republic with a mixed population consisting of Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats‚Äîfollowed suit in March 1992 in a highly controversial referendum, creating tension in the ethnic communities. Bosnian Serb militias, whose strategic goal was to secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina and unite with Serbia, encircled Sarajevo with a siege force of 18,000 stationed in the surrounding hills, from which they assaulted the city with weapons that included artillery, mortars, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy machine-guns, rocket launchers, and aircraft bombs. From 2 May 1992 until the end of the war in 1996, the city was blockaded. The Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, numbering roughly 40,000 inside the besieged city, was poorly equipped and unable to break the siege. Meanwhile, throughout the country, thousands of predominantly Bosniak civilians were driven from their homes in a process of ethnic cleansing. In Sarajevo, women and children attempting to buy food were frequently terrorized by Bosnian Serb sniper fire. =U2's reaction= In 1993, U2 were in Europe for the \\"Zooropa\\" leg of their Zoo TV Tour. Before their 3 July show in Verona, Italy, the band received a fax from Radio and Television of Bosnia and Herzegovina asking for an interview regarding the situation in Bosnia. The band agreed and met with an American aid worker named Bill Carter, who acted as the station's foreign associate, due to Serbian travel restrictions.McCormick (2006), pp. 252‚Äì253Flanagan (1996), p. 277 Carter described his experiences in Sarajevo helping Bosnians while surviving the dangerous living conditions. Lead vocalist Bono was unnerved to hear that those living in makeshift bomb shelters in the city played music, including U2's, at loud volumes to drown out the sound of explosions. While in Sarajevo, Carter had seen a television interview on MTV in which Bono mentioned the theme of the Zooropa tour leg was a unified Europe. Feeling that such an aim was empty if ignoring the Bosnians' plight, Carter sought Bono's help.Carter (2005), p. 170 He requested that U2 go to Sarajevo to bring attention to the war and break the \\"media fatigue\\" that had occurred from covering the conflict. Bono agreed to Carter's request without asking the rest of the band, and when informed of the idea, the other members gave only tacit approval. They briefly considered playing an impromptu concert in the city, with Bono suggesting that they perform in the bunker where Carter and his friends hid during the siege. He said, \\"even if all we get is some extra attention for Bosnia on MTV, that's something\\".Jackson (2008), p. 47 The idea fell through when it was pointed out that the logistics of transporting their equipment into the city were impossible, as the only way into Sarajevo was on a United Nations plane. Manager Paul McGuinness realized that even if the band managed to organize a concert, it would endanger their lives and those of the audience and the Zoo TV crew. As he explained, \\"U2's effort to discuss any humanitarian issue have sometimes been accompanied by a false instinct that U2 is also obliged to resolve that issue. Going to Sarajevo seems to me to fall into that category. I think it would endanger the people we go with, endanger the tour, and endanger the band.\\"Flanagan (1996), p. 294 Drummer Larry Mullen, Jr. feared that the move would look like a publicity stunt. \\"Sniper Alley\\", pictured in 1995. During U2's Zoo TV Tour, Carter had to cross this area nightly to broadcast a satellite video feed from Sarajevo to the band. Instead, the group agreed to use the tour's satellite dish to conduct live video transmissions from their concerts to Carter in Sarajevo. Carter returned to the city and assembled a video unit. The band purchased a satellite dish to be sent to Sarajevo and paid a ¬£100,000 fee to join the European Broadcasting Union (EBU). Once set up, the band began satellite link- ups to Sarajevo on nearly a nightly basis, the first of which aired on 17 July 1993 in Bologna, Italy.Flanagan (1996), pp. 300‚Äì306 To connect with the EBU satellite, Carter and two co-workers were forced to visit the Sarajevo television station at night and to film with as little light as possible to avoid the attention of snipers and bombers. To reach the building, they had to traverse an area known as \\"Sniper Alley\\".Jackson (2008), pp. 48, 49 This was done a total of 12 times over the course of a month. During the broadcasts, Carter discussed the deteriorating situation in the city, and Bosnians often spoke to U2 and their audience. These grim interviews starkly contrasted with the rest of the show; concerts on the Zoo TV Tour were elaborately staged multimedia events that satirised television and the audience's over- stimulation. Most of the shows were scripted, but the link-ups to Sarajevo were not, leaving the group unsure who would speak or what they would say. U2 stopped the broadcasts in August 1993 after learning that the Siege of Sarajevo was being reported on the front of many British newspapers. Though this trend had begun before the band's first Sarajevo transmission, Nathan Jackson suggested that U2's actions had brought awareness of the situation to their fans and to the British public indirectly. Reactions to the transmissions were mixed. Many fans felt the transmissions disrupted the flow of the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, \\"The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting.\\" Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career.Flanagan (1996), pp. 307‚Äì308 Guitarist The Edge said, \\"We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us.\\" Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, \\"We know you're not going to do anything for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die.\\" During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, \\"We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women.\\"Rolling Stone (1994), p. 207 Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.McCormick (2006), pp. 277, 279 The band contributed to Bosnian relief efforts to enhance humanitarian and public awareness of the issue,Flanagan (2005), p. 201 and Bono and Carter subsequently collaborated on the documentary Miss Sarajevo, which showcased the war-torn city during Carter's six months living there. In 1995, U2 and Eno wrote the song \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" as a response to \\"the surreal acts of defiance that had taken place during the siege of Sarajevo\\".McCormick (2006), p. 262 One such act was a beauty pageant organized by Bosnian women who planned to fight the war with their \\"lipstick and heels\\". During the pageant, all of the participants walked onto the stage carrying a banner that said, \\"Don't let them kill us\\". The winner of the pageant, 17-year-old Inela Nogiƒá, later said the pageant \\"was a crazy thing to do during a war. But we tried to live a normal life. It was some kind of a defence mechanism we all had.\\" Years later, Bono said, \\"It was pure Dada and it deserved to be celebrated in song.\\" Of the song's meaning, he said, \\"Everywhere people had heard their call for help‚Äîbut help never came. That was the feeling. I had tried to tackle subjects like this head-on, but I'd learnt a lesson. You have to try and make the same points, in a different, less direct, more surrealist way.\\"Stokes (2005), pp. 198‚Äì199 \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" was recorded with Luciano Pavarotti and released as the first single from U2's side-project with Eno entitled Original Soundtracks 1; the record was released under the pseudonym \\"Passengers\\". Scheduling and preparations As the Bosnian War ended in 1995 and the Siege of Sarajevo in 1996, the stability of the region began to improve. Realizing this, U2 began to plan a concert for Sarajevo that would take place on their 1997 PopMart Tour. Although they were the first major musical artist to perform in the city following the war, China Drum had played a concert in July 1996.de la Parra (2003), pp. 211‚Äì212 Music journalist Andrew Mueller described China Drum's experience in a single van as a \\"logistical and administrative nightmare\\". Muhamed Sacirbey, the Bosnian Ambassador to the United Nations, helped U2 make arrangements, playing an informal role as promoter and organizer. McGuinness said, \\"We thought it was going to be quite difficult. But it's been quite straightforward. People have just wanted to help. We've blagged a lot of equipment, forklifts and so on, from the military, and the local crew have been incredibly supportive.\\" Scheduling the concert meant a financial loss of ¬£500,000 for the band, despite sponsorship from Coca-Cola and GSM. Ticket prices were set at just DM 8 (, ), because of the 50 percent unemployment rate in the city. Bono offered for the group to perform a benefit concert or small show in Sarajevo, but the city requested they hold the full PopMart show. Bono said, \\"We offered to do a charity gig here, just turn up and do a scratch gig, but they wanted the whole fucking thing. They wanted the lemon!\\" McGuinness added, \\"we felt it was important that we treat this as another city on the tour, to pay them that respect. To come here and not do the whole show would have been rude.\\" According to news releases following the concert, the total net income for the show was US$13,500; however, tour promoter John Giddings noted that price did not include the costs of the production or transportation. For the Sarajevo concert, U2 stayed at the city's alt=A 12-story hotel building with a yellow- and brown-coloured exterior. Trees are visible in the foreground, and the building reads \\"Holiday Inn\\" at the top. As late as July 1997, U2 were pressured to accept an offer of approximately $4 million to perform in Basel, Switzerland on the date scheduled for the Sarajevo show. At the time, rumours about the region's instability persisted. To ensure the Sarajevo show was not canceled, Sacirbey appeared at many of the band's preceding shows to lobby on behalf of the city. For the stage to reach Sarajevo, the road crew had to drive the equipment and stage through war-torn Bosnia. Although the trip was without incident, they had to pass through towns such as Mostar, which had been \\"obliterated\\" during the war. Stage and lighting designer Willie Williams commented that \\"when the truck drivers arrived you could see that they were changed men\\". The only trouble in transporting the stage came when a border control agent prevented them from crossing the border for hours. The trucks reached Sarajevo two days prior to the concert, arriving to the cheers and applause of the city's residents; their arrival was the first concrete evidence that the band were keeping their promise to play there. McGuinness explained, \\"This is a city that's been disappointed so many times there were a lot of people who weren't prepared to believe the gig was going to take place until they saw the stage going up.\\" Until then, tickets had sold very slowly, but within 24 hours of the trucks' arrival, another 8,000 tickets were sold. Despite this, a day before the concert, 15,000 tickets remained unsold. Three- hundred local residents were employed to help assemble the stage and promote the show. Several hundred members of the international \\"Stabilisation Force\\" (SFOR) were tasked with upholding the Dayton Agreement for the concert. The band were overwhelmed by the sights they saw when arriving. During the war, Ko≈°evo Stadium was used as a morgue, and graveyards were present on either sides. Although the venue had escaped the worst of the shelling, the nearby Olympic Hall Zetra had been badly damaged during the war. Despite its condition, U2 used the building for their dressing rooms and offices. Following the concert, it was used to provide lodging for 3,000 fans. The band's hotel, a nearby Holiday Inn, had been shelled during the siege, and part of the building had been destroyed as a result. The walls in Mullen's room were punctured with mortar shrapnel, and sections of the floor were also missing. Prior to the show, Sacirbey took Mullen on a tour of the city, showing him the Sarajevo Roses embedded in the streets. On the day of the concert, trains ran into Sarajevo for the first time since the start of the war. Two lines were opened, one from Mostar to Sarajevo and the other from Maglaj to Sarajevo. Although the railways had been functional for the duration of the war, Muslim and Croat politicians could not decide who would operate them. As a result, the trains were only run on the date of the concert to bring fans to the city, and the day after to take them home again. Visa requirements were temporarily suspended. An effort was made to include all of the country's ethnic groups at the concert. Approximately 500 fans crossed the ethnic boundary lines between Bosnia's Serb Republic and the Moslem-Croat Federation. People from several of the other Yugoslavian republics went to Sarajevo for the concert, with buses carrying fans from Zagreb, Croatia and Ljubljana, Slovenia. Security around the event was strict. SFOR soldiers searched for bombs with sniffer dogs, and the buildings around the stadium contained troops in case violence broke out. Concert overview The concert took place at Ko≈°evo Stadium (pictured in 2003), which was previously used as a morgue during the war. The concert was held on 23 September 1997, and approximately 45,000 people attended. It was broadcast in Bosnia by local television networks, as well as globally by BBC. During the event, 10,000 soldiers stood on the left side of the stadium to ensure no conflicts broke out. At showtime, a decision was made to open the stadium gates to all, allowing approximately 10,000 more fans who could not afford the concert or who had not purchased tickets in time to attend. In addition to the local and foreign fans, 6,000 off-duty SFOR soldiers attended the event in uniform. Inela Nogiƒá attended the concert and arrived in a limo with the band. The concert was broadcast live internationally on radio, and all proceeds from the radio sales were donated to the War Child project. Three opening acts played before U2, beginning with the Gazi Huzrev-Beg choir, an Islamic choir from a local high school. Their performance was followed by two local bands, Protest and Sikter, one of which was chosen personally by Sacirbey, and the other which was selected through a radio contest. Following the opening acts, musician Howie B performed a DJ set before U2 took the stage. The band's set list was similar to that of most shows on the PopMart Tour, but with \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" in place of The Edge's karaoke segment and the addition of \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" in the second encore. The night was a celebration of the end of the war, with Bono setting the tone by shouting out \\"Viva Sarajevo! Fuck the past, kiss the future!\\" at the beginning of \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\". Bono had struggled with his voice throughout the tour, and the morning of the concert he woke up \\"without a voice\\". There was no intent to cancel, and the show went ahead as planned. Though Bono had few difficulties through the opening quartet of \\"Mofo\\", \\"I Will Follow\\", \\"Gone\\", and \\"Even Better Than the Real Thing\\", his voice gave out during \\"Last Night on Earth\\". In 2006, The Edge suggested that Bono's vocal troubles had been caused by laryngitis or by the stress of the previous few months of touring, though he later remarked that \\"it didn't really matter that our lead singer was under the weather because every member of the audience seemed to join in on every song. There was a mass chorus for the whole concert.\\" The PopMart Tour set (pictured in Belfast) included a golden arch, mirrorball lemon, and the world's largest video screen. At various points during \\"Until the End of the World\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\", Bono gestured for the audience to help him with the vocals, and by the eighth song of the night, \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\", he was reduced to speaking the lyrics instead of singing them. The band continued with their standard set list by playing \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\", \\"Stand By Me\\", \\"All I Want Is You\\", and \\"Staring at the Sun\\". U2 considered playing \\"Desire\\" after \\"All I Want Is You\\", but they chose not to perform the song. The Edge then performed a solo version of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\". The rendition was slower and quieter than the studio version. During the song, Bono went backstage for cortisone injections, which helped to improve his voice for a short time. Brian Eno was prepared to go on stage to replace Bono if he could not continue, or to sing alongside him. Bono ultimately returned to the stage alone for the next song, \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\", and the band continued with renditions of \\"Please\\" and \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", which concluded the main set. In the interlude before the first encore, U2 had a worried discussion over the introduction to \\"Miss Sarajevo\\". The song had only been played once prior‚Äîat a benefit concert in 1995 with Bono, The Edge, Eno, and Pavarotti.de la Parra (2003), p. 174 They returned to the stage and played \\"Discoth√®que\\", \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\", \\"With or Without You\\", and a rough version of \\"Miss Sarajevo\\". Pavarotti was not at the concert to sing his part and so an antique gramophone was brought onto the stage in his place. Eno came on stage to sing backing vocals, and Bono invited Nogiƒá on stage during the chorus. During the song, the video screen showed images from Carter's Miss Sarajevo documentary, including footage of the girls taking part in the beauty contest and the banner reading \\"Please don't let them kill us\\". Bono apologized for the rocky performance at the end of the song, saying \\"Sarajevo, this song was written for you. I hope you like it, because we can't fucking play it.\\" The concert concluded with a second encore of \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\\", \\"Mysterious Ways\\", \\"One\\", and an abbreviated cover of \\"Unchained Melody\\". After the band had walked offstage, in a move described by NME as the most meaningful of the concert, the audience faced the troops in the stadium and broke into a spontaneous round of applause, which quickly turned into an ovation‚Äîan act which the soldiers mimicked in turn. Reaction The day after the concert in Sarajevo, a local newspaper carried an editorial which was headlined, \\"Today was the day the siege of Sarajevo ended\\". In reaction to the event, a Bosnian student told members of the international press, \\"I felt excluded from the world for so long. It's not only about U2. It's the feeling of being part of the world.\\" A local resident said that the concert was \\"proof that we have peace here, that everything is OK\\". Fans from outside the former Yugoslavia described Sarajevo as \\"an oasis of light\\" in the midst of destroyed and fire-damaged buildings, and deserted villages. Despite the subpar performance, the Associated Press said, \\"For two magical hours, the rock band U2 achieved what warriors, politicians and diplomats could not: They united Bosnia.\\" Andrew Mueller of The Independent wrote, \\"For the first time since the start of the war in 1992, people more accustomed to seeing each other through the sights of a rifle were converging on the capital to listen to music together. It was a reminder of prewar Sarajevo, home to some of old Yugoslavia's best rock bands.\\" Sacirbey stated that he was satisfied that the concert \\"was held to promote a sense of normalcy, peace and reconciliation in Sarajevo and not to raise money.\\" He also expressed thanks on behalf of President Alija Izetbegoviƒá, who described the concert as a \\"landmark event\\". Mullen and The Edge both agreed that playing the Sarajevo concert had been the highlight of their careers; Mullen said, \\"[t]here's no doubt that that is an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life. And if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, [...] I think it would have been worthwhile.\\" Bono described it as \\"one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life\\", saying of the audience, \\"I think they wanted, more than anything, a return to normalcy. That's what these people want, it's what they deserve.\\" He also speculated that the loss of his voice had \\"allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us. They could see that things could go horribly wrong, they'd gone to a lot of trouble to come here, and they were just going to make it happen. And they did.\\" After the completion of the PopMart Tour, he said, \\"it was amazing and confounding to discover that on our most 'pop' of tours some of the best shows were in political hotspots like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv [...] anywhere music meant more than entertainment\\". Following the concert, President Izetbegoviƒá presented Bono with an honorary Bosnian passport, in recognition of his humanitarian efforts during the war. Legacy The peaceful nature of the U2 concert was fleeting, as violence flared up in the region the following year with the Kosovo War. NATO troops remained in Sarajevo until 2004, while European Union peace-keeping troops remain in the city. Following the Sarajevo concert, The Edge's solo performance of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" was performed at the majority of shows for the remainder of the tour, and a recording of the song from the Sarajevo concert was released on the CD single for \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" on 8 December 1997; The Edge later stated the band had \\"rediscovered\\" the song in Sarajevo after his solo performance. A short documentary about the concert, Missing Sarajevo, was included on the DVD release of U2's 2002 video compilation, The Best of 1990-2000. After U2 first performed \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" at the Sarajevo concert, it was not performed again until the second leg of the Vertigo Tour in 2005. U2 did not return to perform in any country in the former Yugoslavia until August 2009, when they performed two shows in Zagreb during the U2 360¬∞ Tour. During the Zagreb shows, Bono stated that his honorary Bosnian passport was one of his \\"most treasured possessions\\", which prompted the country's Council of Ministers to announce that his passport was to be revoked, citing how country's laws do not allow honorary citizenships to be conferred.

He sided originally with the Parliamentarian side in the English Civil War, but the strength of his allegiance was in doubt. Owen was the son of John Owen of Orielton, Pembrokeshire and his wife Dorothy Laugharne, daughter of John Laugharne of St Brides, and sister of Rowland Laugharne.Welsh Biography Online Owen Family of Orielton He was educated at Lincoln's Inn (1622). He sat on the Pembrokeshire bench as a Justice of the Peace from 1629 to 1643 and from 1656 until his death and was also a JP for Anglesey from 1637 to 1643, 1649 to 1653 and 1656 until his death. He was appointed High Sheriff of Pembrokeshire for 1633‚Äì34, 1653‚Äì54, 1663‚Äì44, Custos Rotulorum of Anglesey for 1642‚Äì43 and Deputy Lieutenant for Pembrokeshire from 1637 to at least 1642 and again in 1661. Owen was elected Member of Parliament for Pembroke Boroughs in 1626 and again in 1628, sitting until 1629 when King Charles decided to rule without parliament for eleven years. In April 1640, Owen was elected MP for Haverfordwest in the Short Parliament. In November 1640 he was elected MP for Pembroke again for the Long Parliament. He was created baronet of Orielton in the County of Pembroke on 11 August 1641. At the beginning of the Civil War, Owen supported the Parliamentary cause with his cousin Rowland and John Poyer at Pembroke. In February 1644, he was imprisoned by Sir Henry Vaughan after the Royalist defeat at Pill, Milford Haven. He then changed sides and joined the king at Oxford, abandoning Pembrokeshire for Anglesey when the cause was lost. However he remained in parliament until 1648. After the restoration of the monarchy he was again re-elected MP for Pembroke for the Convention Parliament in March 1660. Owen married firstly Frances Philipps, daughter of Sir John Philipps, 1st Baronet of Picton Castle, and secondly Catherine Lloyd, daughter of Sir Evan Lloyd of Yale, Denbighshire.

Travel cots are typically much lighter than a standard cot, with soft sides to provide comfort to the baby when sleeping. Benefits The United Kingdom Department of Health's guide Reducing the Risk Of Cot Deathhttp://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_096299.pdf states that babies should always sleep by themselves, and are much safer in their own cot. The Foundation for the Study of Infant Deaths states that it is preferable that each new baby has his or her own new mattress to avoid the risk of infection spreading between children which has been a contributing factor in some cases of SIDS. In addition to the health benefits, a travel cot can also provide benefits to the child. Regular use of a travel cot means that a baby will become used to a sleeping environment outside the usual cot which means that they are more likely to go to sleep quicker when they are travelling and sleep for longer and more soundly when they have gone to sleep. If using a bassinet or pop-up travel cot, the travel cot can eliminate the need to buy a separate Moses basket for the baby. Such a travel cot can be used in the first few months of a baby's life either in any part of the house so that parents can closely monitor their new born baby and can place their baby in the cot without straining to the bottom of the back - which can cause harm to a new mothers recovering body. Types # Standard travel cot: This is the usual type of travel cot with collapsible frame and removable mattress. It usually has a rectangular shape, but different styles are now being developed. This can be used as a travel cot and a playpen and is suitable for babies from birth until 6.5 kg (approximately 3 years old). Though a Standard travel cot is usually quite cumbersome to carry, Lightweight travel cots have now been designed ideal for camping, hiking or taking on airplanes when weight is at a premium. # Pop-up travel cot: this is a much smaller version of the travel cot which is suitable from birth until the baby can support themselves on their hands and knees. A pop-up travel cot is constructed in the same manner as a pop up tent which immediately 'pops up' when it is removed from its bag and is folded down to a compact size about the size of a large shopping bag. A pop-up travel cot is easier to construct and is more portable as it is lighter and more flexible than other models, but is only suitable for very young babies. # Bassinet travel cot: A bassinet travel cot is a standard travel cot with a bassinet included for a smaller baby. Much like the pop-up travel cot, the bassinet is smaller and softer, and is designed for new babies, however when the baby can support himself on his hands and feet, parents can remove the bassinet and use the travel cot as they would a standard travel cot, without having to buy a new travel cot. Bassinet travel cots can come with added extras including a vibrating mattress, lights and music, which are intended to support the baby in its efforts to sleep.

Early life and First World War Born the son of a butcher in Scotforth, Lancashire the family nevertheless had domestic servants (his namesake grandfather having died the same year, leaving ¬£18,700 ‚Äì ¬£1million in 2011 prices). He attended Lancaster Royal Grammar School and Rydal Penrhos boarding school in North Wales. He matriculated as an undergraduate into Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he was a member of the Officer Training Corps. On 18 December 1914 he was gazetted as a temporary second lieutenant from the OTC into the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) Although intended to be an award for the rank of Major and above, Happold was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in June 1916 while a second lieutenant (signifying he had narrowly missed a Victoria Cross). The citation, for his actions during the Battle of Vimy Ridge, read: > Temp. 2nd Lt. Frederick Crossfield Happold 9th Bn., N. Lan. R. For > conspicuous gallantry. When the enemy exploded a mine, he at once collected > a few men, rushed up and out-bombed a far larger force of the enemy in the > crater until reinforcements arrived. After being wounded he continued to > lead and encourage his party. Career as a teacher and educationalist After the war he taught at the Perse School, Cambridge (while remaining in the Territorial Army as a Captain)) from 1922 to 1928. It was here he started writing for public consumption with the publication of Two plays from the Perse School. He was then appointed Headmaster at Bishop Wordsworth's School, Salisbury in 1928 and married his wife Dorothy in the city in 1933. In 1936, their son David was born, who became a notable mammalogist. Frederick Happold was to remain as Headmaster of the school until his retirement in 1960. Regarding one of Happold's innovative educational techniques ‚Äì the Company of Service and Honour ‚Äì intended to improve his pupils' understanding of the community, Father Kenelm Foster O.P. wrote \\"[the Company is] a sort of modernist Grail (for Boys) or Solidarity which Dr Happold founded in 1935 at Bishop Wordsworth's School, Salisbury. This is his nucleus, his 'order', his new aristocracy, which is to permeate England: a little cohort of leaders, of seers, of doers.\\" (Cited in Happold, 1964, pp. 33). He sailed to Australia where he was awarded an honorary LLD by the University of Melbourne in 1937 for his pioneering work and publications on education. A year previously he oversaw the school becoming a public school and joining the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. In April 1941, two months after its foundation during the Second World War, Happold was commissioned into the Training Branch of the Royal Air Force as a Pilot Officer, a role he would fulfil for 5 years. In keeping with his interest in educational techniques he was a founding member of the New Education Fellowship (now called the World Education Fellowship). He strongly advocated source-based history study and the Oxford Local Examinations amended their History 'O' Level syllabus to include source- based exam questions. During his time at BWS and in his retirement he wrote many books (often through publishers Penguin and Faber) on education and religion, the latter becoming staples of undergraduate theology reading lists. He died in Salisbury, Wiltshire in 1971.

The foundation The society began functioning formally almost 45 years ago with meetings at the late capt.(Dr.) K.A.J. Lalkaka's residence at Kemp's corner. Guest speakers, discussions on interesting cases and academic subjects were the content of their short meetings. From these meetings sprang the concept of holding luncheon meetings at the K.E.M Hospital hosted jointly by Dr. N.S. Vahia and Dr. V.N. Bagadia . As the attendance increased the meetings became regular monthly meetings with all 4 medical colleges i.e., Topiwala National Medical College, Seth G. S. Medical College, Lokmanya Tilak Medical College and Sir J. J. Medical college. Later Invitations were being extended to all Psychiatrists and Psychologists in private and non- teaching set-ups. Around 1965 it was felt the body was now strong enough and the Bombay Psychiatric Society was formally named and constitution adopted. At the first general body meeting Dr. Lalkaka was elected president and Dr. K. R. Saraf became the first Hon. Secretary of the Society. BPS celebrates its 50th year in 2015-16. A host of programs showcasing the work of mental health professionals were organized in Mumbai as a prelude to the golden jubilee year. The golden jubilee year started with a theme of \\"taking psychiatry ahead\\". Justice AP Shah, Chairman, Law Commission, Govt of India; Mr ST Ramesh, DGP Karnataka & Chairman Alcoholics Anonymous, India; Svati & Satyajeet Bhatkal, Directors Satyameva Jayate graced the function. Work The organisation has played very important role time to time in research and awareness work in the city. Various workshops and seminars are held regularly and a monthly meeting is held in all the medical colleges in the city where unique cases are discussed and budding psychiatrists are given a chance to show their talent while presenting cases. After a spate of suicides by students in 2010, BPS had initiated a campaign along with additional municipal commissioner Manisha Mhaiskar, KEM Hospital dean Dr Sanjay Oak and the BMC‚Äôs education department. The Bombay Psychiatric Society by taking help from the local psychiatrists and counselors, residing near the school areas aim to build a bridge between local mental health professionals and the schools, where psychiatrists visit the schools to conduct workshops thus reducing the stigma or reservations in minds of teachers about taking psychiatric help for issues such as depression in students. Management The society is managed by a core committee composed of the President, a vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer and the Executive committee members.

The body and forewings are dark olive green to reddish-brown and to light ochreous-brown. The dorsum of the abdomen is broadly of the same colour as the thorax. There are three large quadrate blackish lateral spots. The forewings have irregular dark transverse bands which are usually much better developed in the olive or ochreous specimens than in the reddish ones. The terminal area has a greyish tinge, usually in distinct contrast with the remainder of the wing and clearly defined proximally by a regular blackish submarginal line running from the apex to the tornus. In the typical form, the stigma is a prominent silvery white reversed comma with its curve towards the base of the wing and its extremities towards the termen. This stigma is even more dilated posteriorly and reduced anteriorly in form charoba and is reduced to a tiny dot or altogether absent in form derasa. The hindwings are various shades of olive, with a darker margin. Food plants The larvae feed on the leaves of Carissa species.

To get from a pilot station to an approaching ship, pilots need to use fast vessels to arrive in time, i.e. a pilot boat. History Historically, pilot stations would often be found on an island or other point at sea near a harbor, giving pilots ample time to transfer to an approaching boat. Two boats would rotate and operate around the clock. Pilot boats would stay at a station for up to a week. It was typical that up to six pilots would be on a boat to board incoming vessels. Pilots would be dropped off at the pilot station after bringing a boat in so they could pick up another outgoing vessel. Today Modern pilot boats being much faster, most pilot stations are now on the mainland. The Ambrose Pilot Station is an example of a pilot station used today by the Sandy Hook Pilots. Ships will notify the pilot station by radio when they are expected to enter the harbor. The pilot station has a radio and radar so it can talk to the captain of the ship and see the ship as it approaches. The pilot station will then send a pilot to meet the ship and guide it into the harbor. After the pilot is on board the vessel the pilot boat will return to the pilot station. Occasionally pilot station can refer to a place on the bridge of a ship where a pilot is positioned while guiding a ship, for example a pilothouse, but this use is less common.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. The church is to the northeast of Louth, and to the west of the A1013 road. With its tall spire rising from a flat landscape, it has been called \\"The Queen of the Marsh\\". History The church dates from about 1200, with additions and alterations in each of the following three centuries. It underwent restorations in 1866 and 1896. The church has suffered from subsidence, and since being vested in the Churches Conservation Trust it has been underpinned. Architecture =Exterior= St Peter's is constructed in a mixture of limestone, greenstone and ironstone, with some red brick. The roofs are in lead and slate, and are topped by red ridge tiles. Its plan consists of a nave with north and south aisles and a south porch, a chancel and a west tower with a spire. The tower stands on a plinth and has diagonal buttresses and a single string course. On the west side is a 15th-century doorway inserted into the lower part of a 14th-century window. The window has three lights containing Y-tracery. The top stage contains some patching with brick and a two-light bell opening in each side. Above this is a coped parapet. The spire is recessed and octagonal. It contains a doorway on the east side and two tiers of lucarnes, the lower tier having two lights and the upper tier a single light. In the north aisle wall is a two-light window to the west, and a doorway and two three-light windows to the east. In the north wall of the chancel is a three-light round-headed window and a blocked doorway. At the east end of the church are corner buttresses, and the east window has a round head and three lights.

It is located north of Republic, Washington. It was closed in 1959. History Curlew Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. The 638th Tactical Control Squadron was redesignated as the 638th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron and activated at Mount Bonaparte AFS (LP-6), Washington on 5 May 1950.Cornett & Johnson, p. 95 By March 1951 the squadron was operating an AN/TPS-1B medium-range search radar, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The permanent site (P-6) was moved to Bodie Mountain (Curlew AFS) on 1 December 1953, and the 638th AC&W; Squadron began operating an AN/FPS-3 long-range search radar and an AN/FPS-5 height-finder radar beginning in January 1952. An AN/FPS-6 height-finder radar was installed in 1957. In 1959 the 638th AC&W; Squadron was inactivated, and the station was converted to an unmanned gap-filler radar site (P-60C) to support Colville AFS (P-60) until the site was finally closed in December 1960. Today, the radar site itself is obliterated, a few foundations and some crumbling concrete is all that remains.

Website of the International Centre for the Prevention of Crime. requested on: 3rd of February 2011. It does this in three main ways: # through the collation of global knowledge about crime prevention developments and effective strategies and practices, including the development of compendiums of good practice, tool development, and comparative analysis of specific approaches and issues; # by promoting the exchange of information and experiences between policy makers, practitioners and researchers through seminars and regular colloquia on specific topics; # and by providing technical assistance on the ground. Its main working languages are English, French and Spanish. Since it was created ICPC has worked closely with UN- HABITAT and its Safer Cities Programme in particular, and with UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime), both of which are members of the Centre. ICPC is also a member of the Programme Network Institutes affiliated with the UN Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (UNODC), a network of institutions around the world which aim to assist Member States and the work of the Commission. In this capacity ICPC has supported the work of the Crime Commission including through the organization of workshops on crime prevention at the 10th, 11th and 12th UN Crime Congresses, and through the development of a crime prevention Handbook and an assessment tool.

Other museums are not entirely dedicated to architecture but do contain architecture sections (such as Museums of Metz in Metz, France), architecture halls (such as Chicago Athenaeum, in Chicago, Illinois, US), or architecture galleries (such as University of South Australia's Architecture Museum in Mount Gambier, South Australia). The International Confederation of Architectural Museums is an international organization for architecture museums. Members consist of museums, centers, collections and other institutions that offer permanent exhibitions or dedicated galleries on architecture.  Ownership, venues, size and exhibitions  As for ownership and operation, some architecture museums, such Galleri Rom, in Oslo, Norway, are privately owned. Others, like Museo Nacional de Arquitectura, in Mexico City, are a publicly owned national patrimony. Still others, like the National Building Museum, in Washington, D.C., are public institutions but privately operated. In terms of the venues for these museums, some architecture museums are located in former houses, mansions, or residences, such as Museo de la Arquitectura Ponce√±a. Other museums, on the other hand, are housed in structures specifically designed to accommodate an architecture museum, such as the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA). The museum architecture in such architecture museums has been specifically designed and tailored to the purpose for that space. Architecture museums can also be \\"housed\\" in the open air, such as Japan's Meiji-mura. Overall, house-based architecture museums abound: other examples of house-based architecture museums are Schifferstadt, in Frederick, Maryland, Rietveld Schr√∂der House, in Utrecht, Netherlands, and Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner House-Museum in Canet de Mar, Spain. As for displays and exhibitions, architecture museums may display exhibitions relating the history of architecture of a certain region, such as German Architecture Museum (diachronic), but others, such as the Museum of Ponce Architecture focuses on a particular architectural style (Ponce Creole) - synchronic.Sites of the Uncanny: Paul Celan, Specularity and the Visual Arts. Eric Kilgerman. Berlin: Walter DeGruyter, Publishers. 2007. p. 255. Accessed 25 January 2019. Some architecture museums are based in very large cities or large metropolitan areas, but the architecture museum itself may be quite small; one example of this is the Skyscraper Museum in New York City. Awards The biennial International Highrise Award, is granted in Frankfurt am Main to the \\"a structure that combines exemplary sustainability, external shape and internal spatial quality, not to mention social aspects, to create a model design.\\" The award was first given in 2003 and it was the brainchild of a partnership between the City of Frankfurt, the German Architecture Museum and DekaBank.IHP 2004, Jury, Ingeborg Flagge - IHP The prize, a statuette and EUR 50,000 is awarded to the planners and developers jointly. The award consists of a statuette and EUR 50,000, which are awarded jointly to the planners and developers winning the award. The American Society of Landscape Architects grants professional awards every year to architecture museums and art displays. Some of the award-winning projects have been: Perez Art Museum Miami, that won the award for Resiliency by Design, the Teardrop Park, winner in the General Design Category and Mesa Arts Center, a General Design Honor Award winner.

Hone spent the 1969 VFL season with the Melbourne Football Club as an amateur and played 18 of a possible 20 games during year, mostly as a defender. An honours graduate from Monash University, Hone chose to continue his studies in England and became a student at Worcester College, Oxford, in 1970. His father Brian Hone had been a famous educator. He made three first- class cricket appearances for the university in 1970, as an opening bowler. The first was against Hampshire, who were being captained by former West Indian Test cricketer Roy Marshall. In a drawn match, Hone took the wicket of Hampshire opener Richard Lewis but managed no further dismissals from his 36 overs. He went wicket-less from his two other first-class matches, against Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire, to finish with a disappointing average of 284. Hone returned to Australia in 1971 and although he began training again with Melbourne, he never played another VFL game. He would have a highly successful career in secondary education, both as a Headmaster and teacher. During the early 1980s he was the Head of History at Melbourne Grammar and from 1986 until 1993 served as the Headmaster of Scotch Oakburn College in Launceston. In 1994 he joined Adelaide's Westminster School as Principal and remained in that position until 1999. He was then the Head of the Senior School at Beaconhills College before retiring and taking up a role with the University of the Third Age.

The initiative came from Brucan, who discussed the plan with Apostol and then discussed it with B√ÆrlƒÉdeanu, the architect of Romanian economic development of the 1960s.Durandin, p.72 After these first contacts, Brucan paid visits to the embassies of the United States and of the United Kingdom in Bucharest.Durandin, p.73 Unusually, the Securitate did not arrest him and the government allowed him to visit the United States in June 1988. The Department of State was enthusiastic about the letter, but he was advised to publish it after returning to Romania, or else he would be forced to remain in exile. After this a tour of the United Kingdom followed, where he held conferences in Oxford and at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and had meetings at the Foreign Office; Brucan then went to Moscow, where he met Gorbachev (or according to other accounts, Alexander Yakovlev) in an hour-long meeting, being given assurances that if Ceau»ôescu was ousted, the Soviet Union would not intervene.Durandin, p.76 During his return by train in November 1988, Brucan was arrested at the border, but he was let go. B√ÆrlƒÉdeanu disputed the account of Brucan, arguing that, while they discussed the letter, it was called off after it proved impossible to gather enough signatures.Durandin, p.78 B√ÆrlƒÉdeanu claims that Brucan betrayed the other co-signatories by going to the American embassy without telling the others. The letter's content Addressed to President Nicolae Ceau»ôescu,Durandin, p.65 the letter was a left- wing critique of Ceau»ôescu's policies.Neumann, p.180; TismƒÉneanu, Stalinism pentru eternitate, p.262-263 It appealed to the type of humanism supported by Mikhail Gorbachev, although the latter was not mentioned by name.Durandin, p.66 The text of the letter was very clear in its practical demands and set a stark tone, particularly the part in which they compare Romania with Africa, hinting to a future of underdevelopment. Broadcast The document was immediately broadcast on Radio Free Europe, BBC Radio, and Voice of America. Authorities' reaction The broadcast of the letter led to the swift arrest and interrogation of the signatories by the Securitate (the secret police), and then to their house arrest at various locations. Between 11 March and 7 May 1989, Brucan was interrogated 51 times.Durandin, p.77 The Securitate depicted Brucan as one of several \\"hostile, inveterate, elements\\" and \\"the agent of foreign imperialist secret services\\". Four of the six were moved from their houses in the exclusivist district of PrimƒÉverii to places like the outskirts of Bucharest and the other two were detained: * Brucan was sent to a location on the outskirts of Bucharest, in DƒÉmƒÉroaiaDennis Deletant, Ceau»ôescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965-1989, M.E.

Nevertheless, political scientist Michael Shafir argues that the act of collective dissent within the Party was \\"too little, too late\\" and that if it had been done in the mid-1970s, it might have had some consequences and could have been a starting point for some real changes.Durandin, p.70  Notes   References  *  External links  *The Letter of the Six: destinies before and after the year 1989 (essay by Pompiliu-Nicolae Constantin) *The Unique Experience of Romania - Making the History of 1989 *The Securitate Files: Silviu Brucan and the Communist Regime in Romania in the 1980s *The December Revolt and the Coup D'Etat - 1989 Origins Of The National Salvation Front (NSF) Category:Romanian Revolution Category:1989 in Romania Category:Romanian Communist Party Category:Socialist Republic of Romania Category:1989 documents Category:Open letters Category:Works originally published in newspapers ","title":"Letter of the Six"},{"id":"30653822","text":"WBSB may refer to: * WBSB (FM), a radio station (89.5 FM) licensed to Anderson, Indiana, United States. * WZFT, a radio station (104.3 FM) licensed to Baltimore, Maryland, United States, which held the call sign WBSB from 1980 to 1993. * World Buddhist Scout Brotherhood. * The ICAO airport code for Brunei International Airport.

The treaty arose after assemblies of Corsican notables met in Bastia, Saint-Florent, and L'√éle- Rousse, and sent an invitation to Bentinck to send troops and take control of Corsica from French imperial forces. Bentinck sent British troops to Corsica, which drove out the French. Recalling the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom of 1794-1796, Bentinck signed the Treaty of Bastia.Gregory, pp 182-183 Bentinck was also an advocate of Italian unification and may have regarded the treaty as a step towards Corsica later joining Italy. The British Foreign Secretary, Castlereagh, rejected any revival of the Anglo-Corsican Kingdom. He was a strong supporter of Bourbon Restoration in France and all its former dominions. As it had already been agreed by Britain and her allies that Louis XVIII was to rule Corsica, he sent an order to repudiate the treaty. The treaty was not universally accepted by Corsicans. The Court of Appeals in Ajaccio specifically rejected its legality. References Bibliography * Gregory, Desmond. The Ungovernable Rock: The Anglo-Corsican Kingdom. Associated University Press, 1985.

General Information The aim of the German Congress on Crime Prevention (GCOCP) is to present and strengthen crime prevention within a broad societal framework. Thus it contributes to crime reduction as well as reducing both the fear of crime, and the number of victims of crime. As an annually organised congress, the main objectives of the Congress are: * Presenting and exchanging current and basic questions of crime prevention and its effectiveness * Bringing together partners within the field of crime prevention * Functioning as a forum for the practice of crime prevention and for fostering the exchange of expertise * Helping to get into contact at the international level and to exchange information * Discussing implementation strategies * Developing and disseminating recommendations for practice, politics, administration and research in the field of crime prevention In 2007 the Annual International Forum (AIF) within the GCOCP was established to address an international audience and to share their experiences in crime prevention. Both the GCOCP and AIF are geared to people from all over the world working in all areas of crime prevention: administration, health system, youth welfare, judiciary, churches, local authorities, media, politics, police, prevention committees, projects, schools, organizations and associations, science etc. So far the following congresses took place: * 1.

It is located east-northeast of Colville, Washington. It was closed in 1961. History Colville Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. This site took over coverage once provided by the temporary \\"Lashup\\" site L-28, Spokane, Washington, which operated between 1950-1952. The 760th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) was activated at the new station on 27 November 1950. The squadron began operating an AN/TPS-1B medium-range search radar in March 1951 at the then Lashup-Permanent site LP-60, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In November 1951 an AN/TPS-1C replaced the -B model. This radar was subsequently replaced by an AN/FPS-3 long-range search radar and an AN/FPS-5 height-finder radar at this now Permanent site (P-60) in February 1952. In 1956 the AN/FPS-5 height-finder radar was retired and replaced by an AN/FPS-6 model. Also in 1956 an AN/GPS-3 search radar was installed. In 1958 the 760th AC&W; Sq operated a newly installed AN/FPS-20 radar, and the AN/FPS-3 radar was retired. An AN/FPS-6A height-finder was added also in 1958. In 1960 the AN/FPS-20 was modified to the AN/FPS-20A model. During 1960 Colville AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-15 at Larson AFB, Washington. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 760th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In addition to the main facility, Colville operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Ione, WA (P-60A) * Northport, WA (P-60B) * Curlew AFS, WA (P-60C) * Okanogan, WA (P-60D) * Mazama, WA (P-60E) In November 1960 this site was closed due to budget constraints. Today the site remains standing, abandoned and severely deteriorated.

Before 1830s, shivrai was valued at 1/74 to 1/80 of a rupee. There are 150 different types of shivrai extant till date. In 1885, the British government ordered all local revenue collectors (Mamlatdars) to collect all shivrais and deposit them in treasury. The purpose of this was to bring the new pice, worth 1/64 of rupee, in currency by eliminating this native rival. In 1890, Rev. Abbott collected and studied around 25,000 shivrais. He mentions that they were still in circulation. The shivrai remained in circulation till the end of the 19th century.

The Kaiserpalast was a five-storey neo-Baroque building in Dresden, which stood on the north side of the Pirnaischer Platz between Moritzring and Amalienstra√üe. It was built between 1895 and 1897 as the Gesch√§ftshaus Ilgen by the architects Schilling und Graebner for the businessman Hermann Ilgen. It had one tower and on its gable were statues by Hans Hartmann-MacLean. Its porch had a huge window designed by Josef Goller. The ground and first floors were faced with sandstone and the other floors' facades were plastered. It housed a restaurant and a bank. It was destroyed in February 1945 during the bombing of Dresden and the remaining ruins were demolished in 1951. History and description The Kaiserpalast was supposed to replace the restaurant and caf√© Pirnaischer Platz of the operator Otto Scharfe after the development of the surrounding area made this establishment unattractive. The new building was financed by the pharmacist Hermann Ilgen. He bought the property on which the future building was to stand and in 1894 put out an architectural competition for which he created clear usage guidelines that adhered to the Dresden building regulations of the time, which required a representative design for the square, as well as a representative design, who had to be trained at least on the front sides of the Moritz and Amalienring. Scharfe was to run a restaurant again in the four-story new building. The upper floors should either be used as a hotel or rented out as offices and studios. In the tender, Ilgen asked for a two-story basement on the side facing Amalienstra√üe so that the drinks store of the future restaurant could be kept cool, and also a passage between Amalienstra√üe and Ringstra√üe on the ground floor, a third of which would be reserved for the restaurant and the rest of it to Pirnaischer Platz, should be occupied with shops. The entire area of the first floor should be available for the restaurant and have a balcony, the second floor was intended for offices, 113 drafts had been submitted by the deadline of March 15, 1895. 103 were discarded, and Ilgen, one Mr. Rossbach and Professors Wallot and Gottschaldt dealt more intensively with ten drafts. They awarded the third prize of 500 marks to the architect Metzendorf from Elberfeld, and a second third prize to the Dresden architects Hermann Richter and Otto F√∂rster. Two other designs that were not implemented were also shortlisted. One came from the Dresden architect Johannes Fischer, the other had the Saxon name \\"B√§rnsche Dor\\". The first prize went to Th. Martin from Freiberg, who found a clever solution for the light shaft, but had equipped the planned office floors with bathtubs. It was finally decided. The architects Schilling and Graebner , who based themselves on the selected design by Lossow & Viehweger, received the contract for the new building and had it built under their direction from 1895. The ground floor and the first floor were clad in sandstone . In contrast to the award-winning design, the balcony on the first floor was laid out all around. The upper floors were plastered and decorated with rich figurines, which were soon criticized as exaggerated. In an openwork gable in front of the dome of the building was an allegorical representation of the variety theater by Hans Hartmann-MacLean . [1] Three wall paintings and one ceiling painting in the main hall of the Imperial Palace came from Otto Fischer . The windows, especially a colossal window in the vestibule, were designed by Josef Goller . Otto Scharfes Restaurant was opened in December 1897. It was located in this building until around 1920, after which its premises were used by Commerzbank . In 1940 the Frenzel, Schindler and Krumm shops were also rented in the building, as well as Deutsche Gasolin AG and the lawyers Barmann and Hennig, the Horst Meier photo studio and the singing teacher Doris Winkler. An apartment under the roof was used by the stoker of the Kaiserpalast. During the air raids on Dresden in February 1945, the Kaiserpalast was badly hit and burned down. In the course of clearing large areas in 1951, the ruins were torn down. The space that was freed up was used for road traffic towards the main train station and for a green area. The cellars of the building are below these areas, although filled, but still there.https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiserpalast_(Dresden) Gallery Kaiserpalast Dresden, Architekten Schilling & Graebner, Dresden.jpgGeneral view from Pirnaischer Platz Aurig James Kaiserpalast Ostseite Dresden.jpgEast side of the Kaiserpalast Aurig James Kaiserpalast Dresden.jpgEntrance  Bibliography  * Stadtlexikon Dresden A‚ÄìZ.

Early life and family background Morris was born on December 7, 1916 in Maple Shade, New Jersey and grew up in Chicago. His father, John Dale Morris, born in 1869 on a Missouri farm, was a salesman who started out selling dictionaries, then encyclopedias. He founded a book publishing company named John D. Morris & Company of Philadelphia but went broke during the Panic of 1907. His father later worked for Chicago-based La Salle Extension University that provided extension courses. His mother, Ina Arabella Godfrey, was the daughter of a doctor in Colon, Michigan. She studied Greek and Latin classics and joined the Grand Tour of Europe before working for John D. Morris & Company. She met John Dale Morris and they married in 1908, giving birth to their first child, a girl, in 1909. Career At the University of Chicago, John G. Morris and friends issued a student newspaper Pulse in September, 1937 which they published until March, 1941, when America became involved in WW2. It was a bold attempt to launch their careers in journalism, described by Morris as; \\"a radically different college publication, its news section modelled on Time, a monthly survey in the manner of Fortune, and photographs of the candid-camera type, like those in Life‚Äù The colleagues went into professional careers: Paul Berg became a staff photographer for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, John Corcoran for Science Illustrated, Myron Davis for Life, and David Eisendrath for the Chicago Times and New York's PM. Morris graduated in 1938, then obtained a job in the mailroom of Time-Life publications before moving up to a role as Life‚Äôs Hollywood correspondent, working for the weekly picture magazine throughout World War II and becoming Life's London picture editor. There, he was responsible for the coverage of the invasion of France on June 6, 1944 ‚Äì D-Day, and edited the historic photographs of Robert Capa. After the war he became successively the picture editor of the U.S. monthly Ladies' Home Journal, executive editor of Magnum Photos,1976: Magnum: Image and Reality. Text by Harvey V. Fondiller. 35mm Photography, Winter 1976. assistant managing editor for graphics of The Washington Post in the 1960s and picture editor of The New York Times from 1967-73. He continued his career during the Vietnam War. In 1968 he insisted that a photo by Eddie Adams of the Associated Press (AP), showing a South Vietnamese police official in the act of executing a Viet Cong prisoner with a shot to the head, be run on the front page of the New York Times. Four years later, he selected another photo by Nick Ut, showing a naked and screaming Vietnamese girl fleeing a napalm attack. In 1983, Morris moved to Paris, as the European correspondent of National Geographic. As a freelance writer and editor, his primary concern was working for peace. He turned 100 in December 2016. Personal life Morris was married three times, first to Mary Adele Crosby who died in 1964 in childbirth along with the baby. His second wife, Marjorie Smith, died in 1981. His third wife, photographer Tana Hoban, died in 2006. He was survived by his partner, Patricia Trocme from Paris, along with four children (two children from his first marriage and another two from his second marriage) and four grandchildren. He died on July 28, 2017 at a hospital in Paris, aged 100. Awards *1971: Joseph A.

Later that night, Hiart's colleague, Magda Hassingham (Patricia Laffan), discusses the incident with him. Magda's drunkard husband (Frank Lawton), the major landowner in the area, is ignorant of her involvement with enemy agents. Intending to bury Reimann the next day, Robert finds Peter Sandorski (Herbert Lom), a Polish operative for British military intelligence is there. Sandorski enlists his help with a secret operation to foil a gang out to steal atomic secrets. British Colonel Cartwright (Cyril Raymond) introduces Robert and his wife Cecily (Evelyn Keyes) to government official Randall (Roland Culver) who confirms Sandorski's identity and story and instructs Robert to cooperate with Sandorski. When Randall leaves, Robert confesses to Cecily he has accidentally killed a man. Cecily insists on accompanying her husband and Sandorski to a nearby field where an enemy agent is expected to land an aircraft. While Cecily stays in the car, Robert and Sandorski see Hiart, Magda and their assistants arrange landing beacons. When he overhears that the agent, identified as Lex (David Hurst), will only be in town for 48 hours, Sandorski decides to capture him. By moving a beacon, the landing is disrupted, allowing Sandorski who is impersonating Hiart to grab the spy. Sandorski tosses grenades so they cannot be followed. While Robert and Cecily impersonate the Hassinghams, Sandorski drugs Lex so he will sleep. The next morning police discover Reimann's body. Diss, meanwhile, attempts to locate Lex and learns about Robert and Cecily's unusual houseguests from their housekeeper's son, Tommy Powell (Robert Dickens). After police inspectors Matthews (Jack McNaughton) of Dorchester and Sullivan (Clement McCallin) of Scotland Yard question Robert and take one of his boots to compare to the prints found near Reimann's body. Robert insists they all leave for London, where Lex has a meeting. On Robert's instruction, Mrs. Powell (Megs Jenkins) contacts Randall with a request to call off Scotland Yard. Hiart pursues Robert, Cecily, Sandorski and Lex who arrive at a train station where Randall makes contact with Cecily, who admits that her husband killed Reimann. While on the train to London, Cecily takes Lex's briefcase while he is asleep. At the London train station Hiart manages to alert Lex, who escapes. However, the next day at London's Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum, Randall and Sandorski arrest Lex after he passes an envelope to an unidentified spy. Lex and the spy are arrested, but Hiart and Diss flee. Sandorski shoots Diss during a pursuit in a stairwell, and Hiart is killed when he opens Lex's briefcase, triggering an explosion. Randall later reveals to Robert and Cecily that Lex, a scientist, was brought to England to interpret stolen reports about British atomic weapons trials in Australia. He and Sullivan then inform a relieved Robert that it was Hiart who killed Reimann. Before departing, Sandorski cautions Cecily that any future strange behaviour by her husband may be related to espionage. Cast * Joel McCrea as Lt. Col.

Denmark has an embassy in Jakarta, and Indonesia has an embassy in Copenhagen. Bilateral relations are strong, as well as the humanitarian response to the December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which claimed the lives of 45 Danes. In 2015, after focusing on China and South Korea, Denmark is gearing up to enhance its relations with Indonesia, hoping that it will help Denmark to build strong ties with the whole Southeast Asian region. History =Danish settlers= Relations between Danish explorers to Java's inhabitants obviously could be traced back to pre-Colonial era in the 17th Century following successive waves of Europeans‚Äîthe Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch and British‚Äîsought to dominate the spice trade at its sources in 'Spice Islands' (Maluku) of Indonesia. Danish merchants also arrived from Tranquebar, in search of pepper, to Bantenese/Bantamese land in Java. The Danish extended their commercial activities from their settlement in Tranquebar on the Coromandel Coast to various parts of Indonesia. These relations, to a small extent, came into being through the cooperation and advice of Dutchmen who found the road to Asia barred to their own enterprises because of the Dutch East India Company monopoly. The Danish merchants asked Banten's rulers permission to settle and trade. =Sultan of Banten's Letters to Danish Kings= In order to extend the trade relation, Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa of Banten sent some official letters to King Frederick III of Denmark and to King Christian V of Denmark. Dated on January 7, 1675, both the Sultan and the Shahbandar of Banten (Western Java) wrote the first letter to King Frederick III of Denmark. The Sultan asked for cannon and powder and mentioned that 176 bahara (a weight) of pepper, for which there had been no room in the Danish ship Faerae, were being kept in store. Another letter from the Sultan of Banten to King Christian V of Denmark dated February 15, 1675. The Sultan again mentions the 176 baharas of pepper which had been deposited by Captain Adeler with the Banten nobleman, Duke Angab√®hi Cakradana of Bantam. Due to massive Dutch traders approaching Java, Dutch conquered Bantam. The Danish no longer had permission to trade in Sunda Kelapa. =Modern era= Diplomatic relations between Kingdom of Denmark and Republic of Indonesia were established. A Danish embassy were opened in 1974. Political Cooperation In 2007, President of Indonesia, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono met with the Danish Prime Minister, Anders Fogh Rasmussen in New York City. Danish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Per Stig M√∏ller visited Indonesia in 2007. High level visits On 17 December 2009, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono visited Copenhagen to attend the United Nations Climate Change Conference. Her Majesty the Queen of Denmark Margrethe Alexandrine √û√≥rhildur Ingrid and His Royal Highness the Prince Consort, in 21‚Äì24 October 2015 visited three Indonesian cities, Jakarta, Surabaya and Yogyakarta. The Danish Royal visit was meant to strengthen the Indonesian-Danish relationship in culture and trade. They headed a Danish business delegation of around 50 companies that mainly represented 4 sectors; maritime, urban and clean technology, agri-business, design and lifestyle.

It is derived from the evolutionary basis for human cognition. According to proponents of the field such as Paul Rubin, in the evolutionary environment of our forebears life was mostly static; there was almost no economic growth or innovation. Moreover, there was relatively little specialization (except by age and gender) and the economy was simple. It is proposed that our brains evolved to understand this sort of economy, which may cause a mismatch with more recent market economies based on international trade, complex hierarchies, and industrialization. One of the most important implications of this model is that humans have evolved to be zero-sum thinkers. That is, when faced with an economic issue our natural tendency is to view it in zero-sum terms, which means one party must lose something for the other to benefit. This leads to fallacies such as the belief that trade is never mutually beneficial, and the dislike of international trade and immigration. It has been suggested that zero-sum thinking is one of the most relevant sources of inefficient economic policies. The field arose recently from the work of psychologists and economists inspired by evolutionary theory, but speculations on the nature of human economic reasoning go back at least as far as Adam Smith, who suggested that \\"The instinct to barter and exchange one thing for another is common to all men, and to be found in no other race of animals. No dog exchanges bones with another. This is why human needs are met\\". More recently, psychologists such as Steven Pinker suggested that the persecution of middlemen professionals throughout history may be partly explained by the fact that the human mind evolved in an ancestral environment in which the production and trade of goods was not mediated, which leads people to presume that tradesmen and other middleman professionals are exploiters.New York: Viking. Pinker, Steven. The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature. New York: Viking, 2002.New York: Penguin. Pinker, Steven. The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined. New York: Penguin, 2011. The economist and Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek was also interested in the cognitive underpinnings of human economic thinking, and wrote extensively on how people have systematically false beliefs which diverge from accepted economic theories.

Life and work He was the youngest of five children. A year after his birth, his family moved to Dresden, where he grew up. At the age of six, he was sent to a private school and, at fourteen, attended the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts where he was taught drawing by Karl Gottlieb Peschel. After graduating in 1845, he became one of the master pupils in the studio of sculptor Ernst Rietschel. In 1851 and 1852, he went to Berlin to continue his studies with Christian Daniel Rauch and Friedrich Drake. In 1852, he returned to Dresden, where he worked in the studios of Ernst Julius H√§hnel. From 1854 to 1856, he took a study trip to Rome. Finally, in 1857, he established his own studio. That same year, he married Louise Arnold, daughter of the late publisher Ernst Sigismund Arnold (1792-1840). Among their children were Rudolf Schilling, an architect and co- owner of the construction firm Schilling & Graebner, and Katharina Susanna Schilling, who became the wife of chemist Arthur Hantzsch. The writer and historian Heinar Schilling was a child of his second marriage to Minna Neubert. In 1868, he became a Professor at the Academy, a position he held until his death. By 1888, he was sufficiently famous to establish a museum (designed by his son, Rudolf) to display his models and designs. It was destroyed in 1945, as was most of Dresden by the fire bombing of Dresden by the British/Americans. After his death, as a part of his legacy, the city of Mittweida was directed to build a private museum, but these plans had not been realized by 1914 and were put on hold at the outbreak of World War I. His legacy was not fulfilled until 2005, when the Schilling House was established. References Further reading * Gedenkschrift zum 100. Geburtstag von Johannes Schilling.

He was the bass player for 90% of the Plan B's album alongside Jodi Milner, and also did backing vocals, piano and additional guitars. The bulk of the material on The Defamation of Strickland Banks was recorded by Eric Appapoulay and co-owner David McEwan at their own studio in South London, The Sanctuary Recording Studio. Partly because they were simultaneously working on its hip-hop counterpart. =Making of the album= Prominent in both The Sanctuary Recording Studio and on The Defamation of Strickland Banks is Appapoulay's upright piano. Ben Drew explained that \\"Because of how old it is, and some things are slightly out of tune, it reminded me of those old hip-hop records where the sampled piano does sound a little but gritty,\\" \\"That's why I loved it. It looks great and it's got a proper resonance.\\" In a SOS interview, Appapoulay described their process during recording sessions: \\"It was just Ben and myself and Richard and Tom. We would be in the room together, Ben‚Äôd be on his acoustic guitar in that little doorway bit with his mic, setting down the guides. I had guitar in the Fender Twin, drums just clean, and then the bass I put through the LA2A, because I love the way it warms it up. Then we were using the bass amp as well, because we had the whole band in one room ‚Äî the control room was in the drum room that you see now ‚Äî so we were jamming like in a rehearsal. It had a band feeling, like Motown, where they just used to sit in one room and record together. That was the idea with this place, I wanted the whole band to feel like it was a gig scenario, playing as a band.\\" After the album's completion it shot to the top of the European charts, won several awards in 2010, and is nominated for February 2011's Brit Award for two awards including the MasterCard British Album of the Year.

Lawson owned an experimental farm in Cumberland between the years 1862 and 1872. Early life William Lawson was born at Brayton, Aspatria, in Cumberland in 1836. Together with other members of his family, he received his education at home, where he later declared: \\"I learned as little as possible.\\" His parents, Sir Wilfrid and Caroline Lawson, he remarked, \\"were more anxious that their children should be happy and good than that they should be learned and great.\\"Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.14 However, the children did acquire considerable learning; and at least one member later became great. In his youth, Lawson travelled extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East. At home, he took an active role in field sports, where he managed the Cumberland Foxhounds for his brother, who had acquired some hounds from the famous pack belonging to John Peel. In 1861, he became a vegetarian, and gave up hunting and shooting, which he henceforth called ‚Äòbarbarous sports‚Äô. Later he recalled: \\"I found himself in my 25th year, without an occupation, without many acquaintances, except amongst the poor, whom I had not learned to despise because they spoke bad grammar and took their coats off to work.\\" Seeking for a worthwhile occupation, he packed his saddlebags, mounted a pony at his father's gate, and set off for London, to experience his own ‚Äòrural rides‚Äô. The journey via Caldbeck, Penrith, Appleby, Leeds, Sheffield, Chatsworth, Nottingham, Leamington, Oxford and Uxbridge took thirty-three days. During his travels, he visited old acquaintances and made many new ones. He visited steel works at Sheffield and lace manufacturers in Nottingham. As a member of a rural community, he took a particular interest in agricultural matters and noted in his journal that the highest wages earned by farm labourers was two shillings and eight pence (13p) per day. Upon his arrival in London, he learned of Alderman Mechi's experimental farm at Tiptree Hall, Kelvedon, Essex, and sought to visit it. Mechi's modern methods, his technique of irrigation using liquid manure, his advanced sowing procedures and the novelty of housing livestock on boards above the ground left a memorable impression. Upon his return, he tried to convince his father to adopt modern scientific solutions. Although his father preferred the traditional methods, he allowed his son to experiment on a farm in his own right.The West Cumberland Times 2 September 1916 In 1863 Lawson and George Moore of Whitehall, Mealsgate invited Mechi to explain his methods to an invited audience of fifty practical farmers.The Carlisle Journal 18 September 1863 Agriculturalist In his autobiographical journal, ‚ÄòTen Years of Gentleman Farming‚Äô,Lawson and Hunter (1874) published in 1874, Lawson humorously alluded to his three big mistakes; the purchase of a steam plough; the procurement of low priced guano; and the elevation of his father's coachmen to the position of headman. All of these occurred upon his possession of Blennerhasset Farm in 1862; an estate his father had previously purchased for the sum of ¬£17,000. The estate comprised , and incorporated a water wheel, a group of cottages, and a number of derelict farm buildings. In the weeks before assuming control of the farm Lawson travelled extensively throughout Britain seeking agricultural advice, visiting many good farms and farming districts; particularly those that applied ‚Äòmodel farming‚Äô techniques. Lawson began a programme of improvement. He bought an additional of land. He changed the title to the ‚ÄòModel Farm‚Äô, then to Mechi, and later back to the Blennerhasset Farm. He removed miles of unwanted fences, thousands of tons of stone, constructed miles of new roads, and drained the waterlogged land. Besides the farming scheme, he also established a market garden, artificial manure works, a laboratory, a free library, a free school, a gas works, a medical dispensary and several grocery stores. He also contracted the steam cultivator, and founded a flax business. Co-operator Following conversations with the farming fraternity, Lawson began to formulate a procedure for dealing with the difficulties of managing the farm labourers. It occurred to him that the best way of overcoming these obstacles was to make the labourer a direct partaker of the farm profits. He became acquainted with the ways of Sir John Gurdon, who in 1831 sponsored a co-operative farm at Assington Hall, Suffolk. Co-operation became an obsession, and the farm a vehicle for studying the subject. He acquainted himself with its many forms. Those designed to maximise the profits of the shareholders; those devised for increasing the wages of the workers; and those developed to secure the maximum dividend for the purchaser. Lawson wished to introduceLawson and Hunter (1874), p.21 a system that encapsulated these ideals, a system to benefit the vast majority of the public; a system he affectionately termed the ‚ÄòPublic Good‚Äô. Using public meetings, he helped to establish a Cooperative Store System in the town of Aspatria, an establishment that prospered for over a century. Largely through his efforts, the local inhabitants of Dearham, Wigton and Alston adopted similar stores in their districts. However, when Lawson tried to convert these theories into practice by offering equally to share a portion of his profits amongst his workers he met strong opposition. He genuinely believed that his workers would embrace the opportunity and was astonished by their indifference. He attempted to allay their consternations, posing the question, \\"Is it desirable that the workers on this farm should be the direct partakers of its proceeds?\\" He referred to the previously mentioned ‚ÄòSociety Farm‚Äô at Assington, Suffolk where thirty labourers had successfully tenanted a farm using an interest free loan from the owner. He encouraged self-expression and a vote by secret ballot but to no avail. Of the eleven voters, only one voted for ‚Äòco-operation‚Äô, while the remainder voted for ‚Äòevery man for himself‚Äô. He tried to relieve their consternations by inviting the entire community to work with him as cultivators of the soil, not for him as master, where all comers would participate in the generated profits. Of the fifty-three eligible voters, forty-seven initially expressed an interest, however, after he published the value of the investment and the anticipated rewards from its success, their apathy increased and they withdrew their support. The villagers held the opinion: ‚ÄòIf all the people were equal to-day, they would be unequal to-morrow‚Äô. Lawson persevered. In 1866, he published a new statement, offering, ‚Äòco-operation to all comers regardless of their opinion‚Äô, declaring that he would donate all that year's profits above 2.5 per cent to the public good. He included profit exchangeable tickets with wages, a response that captured their imagination such that when he deliberately forgot to include a ticket, they quickly reminded him of the error. At the end of the qualifying period, the balance sheet showed an excess of ¬£181 over the set target. However, since he had already allocated ¬£142 to the public good, this left ¬£39 for profit sharing. After discussions, each full-time worker voted to receive a sum of fifteen shillings. They donated the remaining ¬£9 to a fund to establish a cottage hospital at Aspatria. Those administering the fund later bestowed the grant for ambulance work in the Franco-Prussian War. In 1870, ‚Äòthe year of the great bonus‚Äô Lawson finally achieved his objective. He began by issuing the following address. ::TO MY WORKERS ::\\"I shall give, as bonus, to ordinary time-worker, in proportion to time worked (exclusive of extra and overtime), one-quarter of this year's declared income arising from my present capital, clear of all current expenses, for public good; but should such income exceed ¬£1,000, I shall give as bonus half its excess over ¬£500.\\"The Carlisle Journal, 21 November 1874 When put to the vote, thirty-one members favoured implementation, while seventeen remained unconvinced. The wording of the notice depicted a significant change, for he would now base the final calculation upon his entire capital, inclusive of his outside investments. When later published, the balance sheet showed a profit of ¬£1,715. He awarded ¬£546 to his full-time workers, each of whom received ¬£11. However, in the final year of the scheme, there were no further payments, primarily because of the blighting of the potato crop and the devastation caused by the ‚ÄòGreat Fire‚Äô. The disastrous fire began after the gas works manager repaired a fault with a lighted candle. Although no one suffered injury, the subsequent explosion ignited a heap of loose hay, and quickly spread to the dutch barn, packed to the roof with the recent harvest. The intensity of the blaze was such that within half an hour the flames were visible to the inhabitants of Wigton. The insurance company paid damages of ¬£1,000. Regarding co-operation, in many respects Lawson took a huge gamble. He was, in the words of George Jacob Holyoake, probably the only man in England prepared to commit his entire fortune to promote a scheme that many regarded as folly.Lawson and Hunter (1874) p. 3 The sign over the doorway of the former Blennerhasset post office In 1863, Lawson opened a 'people's shop' or co-operative store in the village of Blennerhassett, which for many years displayed the words \\"William Lawson, Licensed Dealer in Tea and Tobacco\\", chalked on a blackboard over the entrance door.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.41 This curiosity originated after the registrar of the Companies Act refused to register him as a ‚Äògentleman‚Äô. The administrator refused to accept a ‚Äògentleman‚Äô as the promoter of a company of rustic provision dealers.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p. 8 On the gable end of the shop, he painted, in gold letters on a brown background, a larger and more significant emblem, ‚ÄòThe Snuff Shop & General Mart‚Äô. The shop window also advertised a variety of wares, including seeds, specimens of manure, crushed bones, mint lozenges, notepaper and envelopes. During this period the storekeeper was elected by the village parliament using a system of universal suffrage.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.76 Although the total turnover for the small store exceeded ¬£5,200, the accumulated loss totalled ¬£43. The shop remains open for business today and has a sign above the entrance door stating its history. To help dispose of the farm produce Lawson later established three other shops in Newcastle, Ireby and Carlisle. The northeast store closed in 1869, with accumulative debts of ¬£545. Village Parliament Following the failure of the co-operative offer of 1866, Lawson established an ‚ÄòOpen Council‚Äô, later renamed the ‚ÄòVillage Parliament‚Äô, so called because it evolved from the remnant of the previous council, thrown open to include all the members of the village. It had one primary objective, to convert the people into prosperous and intelligent self-directing people. The council held their daily meetings after dinner and restricted the duration to thirty minutes. However once they became popular the committee rescheduled them to a three- hour period on a Saturday afternoon, resulted in the workers receiving payment for debating. He also introduced a suggestion scheme whereby labourers could receive 2s 6d for every adopted proposition. Although the members held the right to vote for wage increases they rarely abused this privilege. They were very aware that any unjustifiable increase would diminish the amount of money available to the fund for the ‚ÄòPublic Good.‚Äô One successful resolution proposed the establishment of a village post-office. This led to an inspection by a government official, and the subsequent installation of a receiving box. On another occasion, a labourer posed the question \\"Is the manager fit to manage?\\" What an unpleasant experience, a manager having to argue and prove the worthiness of his position to not only his workforce but also to the entire village. From a commercial perspective, the Blennerhasset Parliament was a romantic institution. While from the citizen's viewpoint of enlarging ideas, interest and independence, it was a remarkable undertaking. Besides settling disputes about the running of the farm, it reconciled arguments within the neighbourhood. Such that if Jane Jones had grievance against her next door neighbour, Mary Smith, she could give notice to the secretary of her intentions to bring it before the Parliament; on condition that the grievance be paraded before the village, on the day before the confrontation. This procedure allowed the plaintiff sufficient time to reflect and adjust or temper her original language. Another advantage occurred after an aggrieved worker wished to make long-winded complaints privately. The listeners found it very convenient to refer him to the Parliament. Where the greatest talker in private, often became the person with the least to say, when asked to speak in public. Steam cultivation Lawson decided to commence farming from a modern perspective and as such placed great emphasis on the inventions of the new industrial age, with particular reference to steam cultivation. In February 1862, No 95 of John Fowler's Patent Steam Ploughing Tackle arrived at Aspatria railway station. The affectionately named ‚ÄòCyclops,‚Äô the first of its kind in Cumberland, comprised a portable steam engine, with the capacity to drive a grubber, plough, cultivator, and scarifier. Once unloaded, the 10-ton curiosity astonished onlookers when it travelled along the road without the aid of horses. On that monumental day a rustic voice called out from the crowd, \\"She'll nivver git up Thompson's Brow.\\" However, it did and upon the successful ascent of what is now called ‚ÄòStation Hill‚Äô, a second voice cried, \\"well she's gitten up, but she'll nivver ploow!\\" The engine continued to promenade the streets of Aspatria, accompanied by a large concourse of people, finally arriving at Brayton Hall, the scene of the inaugural trials. After a series of mishaps, misfortunes, breakages and repairs, ploughing commenced, which provoked a bystander to remark, \\"Well she's gitten up Thompson's Brow, and she's ploow'd 'er fust furro', but she'll nivver pay.\\"Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.42-43 This criticism proved correct; for Lawson only achieved a profit in two of the ten working years. However Lawson attributed the majority of the losses to inexperience, and with the knowledge of hindsight the consensus opinion was that steam cultivation could work at a profit. In ten years, the loss upon the steam plough alone stood at ¬£850. This was not surprising, since the cost for breakages and repairs exceeded ¬£1,500. This figure would have reduced had the calculation considered the value of the permanent improvements to the land. They should have also offset the loss by costing the value of the unearthed stones, which Lawson used for erecting buildings and constructing roads. The early days of the engine were not without incident. The most serious occurred in 1864 after the hire of the engine to plough at Shotton Lodge. During the descent of Baggrow Brow the travelling gear failed, and the cogwheels slipped their moorings. The engine having no brake rushed headlong down the incline, gaining momentum. Although the driver and his assistant jumped to safety, they rose to see the engine trundling towards a cottage at high speed. Fortunately for the occupants, the steering wheel made contact with an obstacle on the road, causing the engine to veer to the left and collide with a railway bridge, causing damage which is still visible today. In September 1866, Lawson exchanged the engine for a Fowler's patented double engine system. The two contraptions affectionately known as ‚ÄòCain‚Äô and ‚ÄòAbel‚Äô required 1.5 tons of coal to journey a distance. Although the pair, working together in tandem brought immediate improvements, they were plagued with breakages and a catalogue of catastrophes, and consequently failed to show a profit. In 1867, after critical complaints, Lawson recalled the parliament, and proposed the removal and sale of the steam cultivator. This motion infuriated the membership, as they argued that the plough epitomised their role as ‚ÄòModel Farmers‚Äô. However, at the following meeting a packed audience voted overwhelmingly to overthrow this proposal. This threat appeared to have the desired effect and swiftly transformed an annual loss of ¬£343 into a profit of ¬£260. Shortly after the sale of the farm, Lawson sold the equipment for ¬£900, half its new value. In retrospect, Lawson's success with steam cultivation is arguable. The use of the engines undoubtedly improved the quality of the land; the appliance removed vast quantities of stones, and converted the fields into manageable plots. In a ten-year period, he successfully ploughed , grubbed , and harrowed . However, as with all technological innovations, someone had to take the initiative and resolve these early defective systems. Had no one accepted this challenge, then it is doubtful that inventors and manufacturers would have developed the machines we use today. Had Lawson's establishment existed solely for the generation of profits the results would have been catastrophic. However existing as it did for the public good, he could claim a measure of success.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.42-72 Public Good ‚ÄòPublic Good‚Äô was a term used to classify all expenditure incurred for the public advantage, whether the recipients were workers on the farm or not. In the first four years of operation, there are no accounts to record the level of expenditure. However, in the years between 1866 and 1872 Lawson spent more than ¬£1,736 of his capital, sponsoring a variety of pioneer schemes. He gave ¬£2 to sponsor co-operative meetings; ¬£208 towards agricultural experiments; ¬£340 to fund free libraries and reading rooms; ¬£299 to promote free schooling; ¬£7 to provide free bath rooms; ¬£225 to establish the Noble Temple; ¬£318 towards public assistance; and ¬£339 to finance festivals and excursions. Although the expenditure on agricultural experiments represents a considerable proportion of the sum, benefits came with in the development of manures and the management of crops.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.101 The Free Library and Reading Rooms offered perhaps the most beneficial use to the wider public. The library was open to all comers, and had its one and only rule on a slip of paper pasted to the front endpaper of every volume; warning the recipient, that after a loan of one month, an imposed weekly fine of one penny would obtain on the non-return of each volume. Notwithstanding the election of a lenient librarian, the institution collected an annual sum of ¬£3 for late returns. The institution was highly successful, with a total membership subscription of 660. At its peak, the library contained over 1,800 volumes; and annually loaned over 2,400 books. The library provided a wide choice of reading material, good fiction, all forms of religious matters, history, travel, biography and poetry; it also included works by ‚Äòundesirable, controversial, banned‚Äô writers. For example, the complete works of Tom Paine, which so infuriated the committee that they condemned them to the fla.mes. After a protracted debate, lasting almost two years, Lawson ignited a large bonfire on the village green and although he personally disagreed with the verdict, he personally condemned his prize possessions to the flames.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.102-108 After the sale of the farm, Lawson removed the library to the Mealsgate district. William's sister Elizabeth Lawson also donated a similar collection to the village of Aspatria. Lawson failed in his attempts to establish Reading Rooms in the neighbouring towns of Wigton and Maryport, notwithstanding his offer of ¬£50 to any individual or organisation willing to promote such institutions. In 1871, he allocated an annual grant of ¬£45 to initiate Reading Rooms in Aspatria, Bolton Gate, Blennerhasset, Ireby, Plumbland and Bothel. The latter two rejected the offer after Lawson insisted that access be open to all comers; and demanded a veto on the choice of reading material. The remainder accepted a weekly allowance of two shillings and sixpence. Each institution displayed a wide selection of national and provincial newspapers, while Lawson personally provided four American periodicals, The Nation, The Boston Investigator, The Communist and The Circular.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.108 The supply of education and books over a five-year period cost the fund almost ¬£300. Lawson also planned to establish his ideal school. He wanted to create an environment where children would hunger for knowledge, with short hours, and the exclusion of corporal punishment. Although the free day school had seventy names on its register, the average attendance approximated fifty. The free school experiment ended in 1870, superseded by the 1870 Education Act. He also established a well- attended night school with forty-five students of mixed sexes, a revolutionary institution offering scholars the luxury ‚Äòto vote for their lessons‚Äô. In the winter of 1868, Lawson converted a small corner of the ‚Äòturnip house‚Äô into a bathhouse, comprising a spray, a douche, a wooden plunge bath, and a changing trestle, a facility sadly destroyed in the 1871 fire.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.116 Lawson also offered a group of London missionaries, free access to the farm for recreational purposes at an annual cost to the fund for the public good of ¬£60. To the credit of the workforce, they voted to entertain these visitors to the detriment of their bonus.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.8, 78-9 Some of the ‚Äòpersonal incidents‚Äô experienced by Lawson bordered on the ludicrous. One afternoon, he recited the complete script of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' to a group of labourers, who all but slept through the ordeal. He also occasionally read from 'Talpa,' 'The Chronicles of a Clay Farm,' and 'The Co-operator'. As he remarked, \\"The hearers listened as long as they could.\\"Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.95 Vegetarian festivals A committed vegetarian, it was Lawson's desire to employ only like-minded people on his estate. Yet despite his efforts, he managed to enrol or convert only two confederates. Nevertheless, this did not prevent him from sponsoring his ideals on every available occasion. On Christmas Day, 1866, he held the first of his annual Vegetarian Festivals, intending to show the public the possibility of supplying a satisfactory meal for less than one penny per head. This festival of festivals captivated the imagination of the media; ridiculed in Punch, The Times, and almost every daily newspaper, including one in Nova Scotia. Entrance was open to all on the show of a free ticket, available in advance by post, or on the payment of fourpence on the day. The advertisements requested, musicians to bring their instruments; and guests their spoons. Almost five-hundred people received advance tickets; with an equivalent number bought at the gate. The tickets, curiosities in their own right, headed ‚ÄòChristmas Morn, 1866‚Äô comprised a whimsical verse. ::THE SONG OF THE TICKET ::By ten precisely, ::Be in sight; ::Show when required, ::But keep till night.The Carlisle Journal, January 4, 1867. Upon arrival the guests found all three granary buildings decorated with evergreens, flags, banners, and bunting. Lawson used the largest room, with seating arrangements for over one thousand guests for music and dancing; assigning the two smaller rooms, each with a seating capacity for 400 guests, for lectures and the serving of refreshments. The formalities began with James Burns, the celebrated London gymnast reciting an amusing sketch entitled, ‚ÄòHow to read a man like a book‚Äô. At noon Lawson served a ‚Äòfruit, grain, and vegetable meal‚Äô, consisting of raw turnip, boiled cabbage, boiled wheat, boiled barley, shelled peas, oatmeal gruel, boiled horse beans and boiled potatoes. He also presented a salad, made from chopped carrot, turnip, cabbage, parsley and celery, served with a congealed sauce made from boiled linseed. There were no condiments and since everything was cold except the potatoes, one can only imagine the guest's apprehension, as they sat down to dinner. To compensate for the poorly prepared meal each guest upon rising from the table received an apple and a biscuit. The total cost of the ingredients was less than ¬£8. The entertainment continued in the afternoon with a colourful concert comprising gymnastic displays, music, songs and speeches. During the afternoon, the two steam engines set off with whistles screaming to lead a procession through the farm. Around five in the afternoon guests received an ‚Äòevening meal‚Äô, followed by a lecture entitled, ‚ÄòDiet and the Health of the Human Body‚Äô. However unpalatable these proceedings may appear today the guests appreciated the proceedings. The problems arose from lack of experience, a shortage of cooking facilities, and from Lawson's insistence that the food comprise a truly national flavour, thus excluding rice, raisins, currants, pepper, sugar, salt and other readily available imports. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, public opinion suggested that the lectures and experiments were ample compensation for the dissatisfaction caused by the bland food. The second festival was equally successful, and although Lawson levied a small charge for food, he did provide bread and beef. Lawson hailed the third festival as a Social Science Congress, with a series of lectures covering a wide variety of scientific topics. Again, food was free and although beef and ham were available, the meal consisted in the main of rice boiled with currants and raisons. On this occasion, the application for free tickets was so immediate and numerous that after receiving almost 3,000 requests he closed the offer on December 3, although ruined by rain, observers recalled two novel events, labourers using Cain's boiler to heat the water to mash tea, and an attempt by Lawson to introduce a non-smoking policy. In total, Lawson sponsored five festivals, the first four on consecutive Christmas days, while the fifth celebration took place in July, in a meadow adjoining the River Ellen. In addition to festivals, there was the annual mid summer outing, which saw fifty excursionists sitting on wooden planks and bails of straw travelled the sixteen-mile distance in open farm carts to Keswick, where they were ‚Äòencouraged to enjoy their own entertainment‚Äô. The single journey over bare hills and wooded roads took almost six hours to complete. In contrast, in 1867, Lawson sponsored a visit to the Paris Exhibition, offering a grant of ¬£3 for every male and ¬£4 10s for every female who made the journey. Lawson did not confine the grant to his workforce; almost half of the twenty attendees came from the immediate neighbourhood. Sunday Lectures In 1871, Lawson initiated the final part of his experimental programme. He had long desired to extend his festival lectures into something more permanent and regular; and as such he promoted a series of Sunday Lectures on an array of ‚Äòpeculiar‚Äô and ‚Äòcontroversial‚Äô subjects including Witchcraft, Geology, Atheism and Evolution. After he submitted the list of proposed lectures to Sir Wilfrid Lawson, the custodian of the only suitable meeting room in Aspatria, his brother rejected the request for a variety of reasons.The Carlisle Journal 20 May 1872 Undeterred Lawson proposed the erection of a new Public Hall. He first suggested purchasing land in the centre of the town and conceived plans to erect a handsome building capable of seating 550 people, with shops and houses below. Although the scheme failed to attract the required backing, it encouraged an influential body of residents to proceed to form a company to build a market house and assembly room on the old Market Square. However, arguments erupted after Lawson demanded that every shareholder should have only one vote regardless of the number of shares owned. The meeting was extremely rowdy. Lawson led an opposition labelled ‚Äòcommunists‚Äô by their opponents; and from this turmoil came a race to establish two rival Public Halls to serve this small community.The Carlisle Journal 10 May 1872 Lawson purchased a parcel of land for ¬£220 and immediately offered it free of charge with an additional sum of ¬£100, to any group of people willing to build a Public Hall. However, the specification demanded that the room be capable of seating 500 people with an air capacity of . He also gave a written undertaking that if they could obtain a stated number of shareholders by a certain date he would take all the remaining unallotted shares. His only proviso demanded the use, free of charge on Sundays and Christmas days for thirty years.The Carlisle Journal 10 May 1872 He laid the foundation stone in April 1872 and formally opened the building twelve months later. The name Noble Temple may confound contemporary residents. While touring America, Lawson noted that local inhabitants referred to public buildings as Temples; and since the chosen site stood on Noble Fields, close to Noble Bridge, hence the name Noble Temple.Lawson and Hunter (1874), p.116 The elected committee sponsored the well-attended lectures every alternate Sunday. These continued until 1885 and the necessary expenditure primarily came from the ‚ÄòPublic Good‚Äô business.The West Cumberland Times 27 March 1885 The lectures featured both religious and secular subjects. It was generally found that the lectures that were the least orthodox and the least given to religious intolerance were the most instructive and the most appreciated. As a paying concern, the Noble Temple always paid a minimum dividend of 5 per cent per annum to the shareholders. After Lawson left for America, he sold most of his shares by auction at considerably below the purchased price. The building is now a Freemasons Hall. Blennerhasset Farm Blennerhasset Farm now known locally as ‚ÄòMechi‚Äô remains a farm today, situated on the western fringes of the village sharing its name. In Lawson's time the buildings were substantial, covering the area of a small village; fitted with modern facilities to make it almost an autonomous community. He erected the new farmhouse and buildings in a different part of the farm and constructed the walls from the large stones removed from fields by the steam grubber. Lawson converted the original buildings into labourer's cottages and extended the village by more than twenty dwellings. He also erected a row of five new terraced cottages, each comprising three large rooms a kitchen and outhouse; they cost ¬£132 each to build and realised a weekly rent of two shillings and sixpence. Shortly after assuming the role of a farmer, Lawson rearranged the largest field of about into a modern market garden, from where he grew a wide variety of crops. of turnips, of potatoes, of flax, of cabbages, with smaller plots of fruit trees, peas and beans; all types of cereal and a wide choice of berries. In one part a steam engine worked, continuously, preparing food for the livestock. In another, Town Gas was manufactured to illuminate the farm buildings and a substantial part of the village. There was also a smithy and small iron foundry. Lawson divided the interiors of the extensive animal sheds into avenues, appropriately fitted with stalls to house the cattle, horses and pigs. He raised the asphalt floors above the ground allowing water to flush the waste and carry it away along underground pipes into the liquid manure tanks. Metal feed troughs, with pipes carrying water ran along the fronts of the stalls. A stable with stalls for twelve animals ran along the side. An adjoining building housed the steam machinery and included a storehouse for wheels, shares, and other ancillary equipment. To distribute the large quantity of food and bedding required by the cattle throughout the estate Lawson constructed a small railroad fitted with turntables and the necessary rolling stock. To supply the water required to create the energy needed to power the machinery and distribute the liquid manure Lawson dug a cutting from the River Ellen, which he connected to a deep underground stream, thirty feet below the site of the turbine, before pumping it into a large cistern, attached to a high tower. He used the power to saw wood, pulp turnips, crush oats, chop straw, power the flourmill, lathes and tramway's. He laid enormous quantities of iron pipes fitted with hoses made from gutta percha over the land to distribute the liquid manure. He fitted gas pendants, suspended along the stalls and stables, to light the buildings. He also erected a dairy to process the milk into butter. The laboratory was housed in a large room on the upper storey of the building and was fitted with benches and shelves containing bottles and many chemicals. This room also housed the Free Library and a printing press, which he used to produce circulars and commodity price lists. The farm had no stacks; Lawson stored all the hay in a large Dutch barn.The Carlisle Journal 26 May 1865 In 1865, Lawson's father transferred the Prior Hall Farm to his sons name, a estate, situated four miles from Blennerhasset. Two years later, he also received the adjoining farms of Park House (), Newbigin, (), and the Littlethwaite estate in the Vale of Lorton. He promptly sold the latter at auction and raised ¬£3,010. He later bought the Prior Hall Mill estate and amalgamated all four farms. In 1868, he sold the complete for ¬£28,600. Financial failures Although his agricultural transactions proved to be of great interest, they were far from remunerative, and ceased altogether in 1872. A glance at the balance sheet for the ten-year period shows that of the 17 defined departments only four were profitable and the total loss amounted to ¬£18,622, a figure equivalent to almost ¬£2,000 per year, or five percent on the average capital. He lost over ¬£2,000 while processing cattle; the market garden showed a loss of ¬£340, the flax works ¬£331, the starch mill ¬£308, and the previously mentioned shops an aggregate loss of ¬£838. The list was extensive. The loss on land was the most disheartening; new buildings and machinery required a significant outlay, as did the extensive drainage and the uprooting of hedges. This policy of improvements should have been self-financing. It cost him ¬£15,000 to carry out the programme of renovation and all he realised upon the resale was an additional ¬£9,000 over the purchase value, realising a loss of ¬£6,000. The declared loss of ¬£7,000 accredited to the Blennerhasset Farm is a little more difficult to comprehend. The majority of these losses accrued in the first four years. Had the farm continued after 1872 these losses may have reduced. However, there were minor successes; the manure works made ¬£235, the Prior Hall farm ¬£1,341, cottage property ¬£190, and American investments ¬£1,170. Living in America After the failure of the Mechi experiment Lawson left Cumberland and resided for many years in America, where he met and later married Miss Emilie Jane Tyler, of Wanick, Massachusetts. According to a report published in the Rocky Mountain News, Lawson purchased the Swansea Smelting Works of Denver Colorado. Immediately afterwards he placed an advertisement in the South Wales newspapers seeking recruits for the business.The West Cumberland Times 5 February 1875 Public Good Part 2 Lawson never lost his affection for ordinary people from the Aspatria district, and continued with the grants for the Public Good for a number of years. In 1874, the value of Lawson's award stood at ¬£452. The grant included ¬£100 for free education; ¬£48 for free libraries; ¬£220, subsequently lost in an attempt to establish an overseas co-operative store in Naples, Italy, ¬£10 for the printing of manifesto's, ¬£11 for gifts to needy people, ¬£128, for the publication of his book, ¬£4 to administer the Aspatria Parliament, and ¬£11 to ventilate the Noble Temple. He also awarded a four-year annual grant to the committee of the Aspatria Parliament, valued at ¬£100 on the proviso that the committee seek annual re-election and present an official account of their stewardship. During the initial two years, the committee used the grant in support of a free school in the Noble Temple. When a clique of scurrilous characters took control of the Parliament in the following year they closed the school and transferred the children to two local schools, Lawson's agent, Miller Tiffin, aroused public awareness and rescued the endowment by securing the election of a new committee.The West Cumberland Times 20 December 1874 The statements for the years 1874-76 demonstrate the extent of Lawson's business misgivings. In 1874, the principle investment of ¬£21,300 in Wisconsin Bonds became worthless. While in 1876, his remaining investments in American securities decreased in value by ¬£6,300; a slight improvement on the previous performance when he lost ¬£9,000.The West Cumberland Times 7 April 1876 The committee expended the 1878 grant in the following manner. They sent 129 children to the Board School, Aspatria, 16 to the Infant School, and 29 to the Blennerhasset School. They also divided equally a sum of ¬£5 between the reading rooms in the two villages. Lawson's donation continued after 1879, under the stipulation that the committee would consist of both men and women. A statement of the results for 1882, showed that the business suffered a loss of ¬£5,322, which reduced the capital from ¬£4,288 to a deficit of ¬£1,034. The report also stipulated that the valuation of the different kinds of property was reasonable, and these would probably realise a profit. The report also observed the loss of ¬£1,422 besides the ¬£25,000 set apart in 1872, to operate for the Public Good. However he still had ¬£20,225 capital in the business, and remained optimistic of retrieving past losses. Later life In the long tradition of the Lawson family, he held advanced views on most subjects. He was a dedicated advocate of the temperance movement, a supporter of free trade, and strongly opposed to militarism. In later life his views occasionally appeared in newspapers. In 1905, he dispatched a series of ‚Äòpeace packages‚Äô composed of thirteen leaflets denouncing the violence of war. One leaflet contained the following rhyme. ::To die for your country is all very fine, ::And it makes her to you seem a debtor; ::But I stick to the doctrine that's yours and that's mine, ::That to live for your country's far better!The West Cumberland Times 5 May 1905 Another asked the younger generation to uphold the following pledge. \\"I promise to do no murder, and to enter neither the Army nor the Royal Navy.\\" He distributed hundreds of these packages; 1,500 throughout the United Kingdom, while numerous others went to Russia, Japan, France, Germany, New Zealand, Bulgaria, Brazil, San Salvador and South Africa. Although the editors of 27 leading newspapers received portfolios, only the Westminster Gazette gave any coverage. His dispatched his final composition from the Bay Hotel, Falmouth in 1916.

History Clawdd Coch is documented as having some degree of importance as a Roman settlement and it is believed to be the final resting place of Ostorius. One of the roads leading into the hamlet was built by the Romans, known as Via Media. A notable smelting operation of lead and copper took place in the vicinity at what was known as \\"Dol-y-felin-blwm\\". In the mid 19th century, the hamlet was known to be owned by a Mr. Asterley who farmed the land here. Presumably he lived in what is Clawdd Coch guest house, a long farmhouse which was built in the 1650s.

It was the home station of the 637th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron (AC&W; Sq) (later the 637th Radar Squadron) and the 637th Air Defense Group, closing in 1975. History Othello Air Force Station was one of twenty-eight stations built as part of the second segment of the Air Defense Command permanent radar network. Prompted by the start of the Korean War, on July 11, 1950, the Secretary of the Air Force asked the Secretary of Defense for approval to expedite construction of the permanent network. Receiving the Defense Secretary's approval on July 21, the Air Force directed the Corps of Engineers to proceed with construction. This site took over coverage once provided by the temporary \\"Lashup\\" site L-28, Spokane, Washington, which operated between 1950‚Äì1952. The 637th AC&W; Sq had moved to Saddle Mountain, Washington by 1 January 1951.Cornett & Johnson, p. 155 The squadron began operating an AN/FPS-3 long-range search radar and an AN/FPS-5 height-finder radar in January 1952, assuming coverage from the temporary \\"lashup\\" sites L-29 at Larson AFB and L-30 at Richland, Washington. Initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. The site was renamed Othello Air Force Station on 1 December 1953. In 1956 ADC replaced the height-finder radar with an AN/FPS-6. In 1958 the 637th AC&W; Sq operated an AN/FPS-20 search radar and added an AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar. In July 1960 the joined the regional Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) center, the squadron being redesignated as the 637th Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 1 September. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-40. In 1963 the AN/FPS-20 radar was replaced by an AN/FPS-7C set featuring an ECCM capability (the AN/FPS-7C was later modified to the AN/FPS-107 version). Also in 1963 the AN/FPS-6 was retired as an AN/FPS-26A height-finder radar was being installed, completed in 1964.

Edward soon begins to have flashbacks to the murders committed by the previous owner Andrew (Hardy as well). As the story unfolds it sheds light on the events of 30 years or so before when Andrew had planned to leave his wife Victoria (Jean Marsh) for the younger and more attractive governess of their two children. In desperaration Victoria had encouraged the two children to murder the governess whilst she attempted to seduce Andrew in the bedroom. In a fit of rage Andrew strangled his wife and killed the children with a sword before bricking all four corpses up behind a wall with the two cases of money. Edward eventually strangles Sarah and kills Dr. Mandeville with a pick axe before getting arrested and led away by police.

Mansfield's father was a tenant farmer who was evicted. The son became principal of the national school in Cullen, County Tipperary, where his wife was also a teacher. He was president of the Irish National Teachers' Organisation (INTO) in 1910‚Äì11, and later its first full-time general secretary. He was dismissed as principal in October 1912 after his 1911 INTO president's address criticised W. H. Welpy, a school inspector who was reputed to give poor assessments to keep salaries down. Thomas O'Donnell and other Irish Parliamentary Party MPs campaigned for his reinstatement; Mansfield and his wife continued to teach without pay until this was achieved in 1915. He was later Chairman of the Wages Board c.1921. On 7 December 1922, the day after the Irish Free State came into existence, the members of the Third D√°il (TDs) voted to choose 30 members of the newly created Seanad. With Labour Party support, Mansfield was elected in 23rd place, thereby securing a three- year term to expire at the 1925 election. The Irish Civil War was in progress, and the same day, two pro-Treaty TDs were shot, one fatally. The following day, four imprisoned anti-Treaty leaders were executed in reprisal. On 12 December, Mansfield sent a telegram resigning from the Seanad \\"on account of Friday's reprisal\\" and stating that \\"peace is Ireland's only hope\\". Ernest Blythe suggested later that Mansfield had resigned in panic at anti-Treaty commander Liam Lynch's order to assassinate all Senators. Mansfield was later a member of the Commission of Agriculture, and was consulted in the drafting of the Land Acts of 1923 and 1933. In 1935, he was a member of a commission of inquiry into the sale of cottages and plots to agricultural labourers, as representative of the Cottier Tenants' and Rural Workers' Association. He was a lay commissioner on the Appeals Tribunal of the Irish Land Commission from 1934 to 1950. When Kathleen Browne complained in the Seanad about his appointment, his expertise and impartiality were commended by minister Joseph Connolly and senators Michael Comyn, James Charles Dowdall, and William Cummins. As commissioner, he was an influential advocate of land division, and the rights of evicted tenants.

By choosing cards it answered arithmetical problems and spelled out words. The \\"learned pig\\" caused a sensation in London during the 1780s. It became a common object of satire, illustrated in caricatures and referred to in literature. The original \\"learned pig\\" was followed by other trained pigs, which subsequently became a feature of fairs and other public attractions in Europe and America during the 19th century. In the words of G.E. Bentley, \\"They served as subjects for cartoons by Rowlandson and moral essays in children's books and savage doggerel by Blake, and they illustrated the manners of the English in works by Joseph Strutt and Robert Southey and Thomas Hood. These freaks of learning clearly exercised a fascination among the literary geniuses of the age as they did among the swinish multitude.\\"G.E. Bentley, \\"The Freaks of Learning\\", Colby Quarterly, Vol. 18, Iss. 2, 1982, Art. 3, pp.88-104. The original pig The original Learned Pig was trained by a Scotsman Samuel Bisset, who ran a travelling novelty show. The idea of an \\"intellectual\\" animal was not new. A similar attraction known as \\"Marocco the thinking horse\\" (c.1586‚Äìc.1606) had been exhibited over a century earlier; there were also contemporary examples of the \\"horse of knowledge\\", exhibited for example at Astley's Amphitheatre.Barbara M. Benedict, Curiosity: A Cultural History of Early Modern Inquiry, University of Chicago Press, 2002, p.206. But performing horses were nothing unusual. No performing pigs are known to have been trained before. The pig was shown with great success in Dublin. After Bisset's death the pig was taken over by a Mr Nicholson, who toured it in Britain.Jan Bondeson, The feejee mermaid and other essays in natural and unnatural history, Cornell University Press, 1999, pp.20-28 It was exhibited in Nottingham in 1784, coming to London in the following year.\\" According to publicity at the time, > This entertaining and sagacious animal casts accounts by means of > Typographical cards, in the same manner as a Printer composes, and by the > same method sets down any capital or Surname, reckons the number of People > present, tells by evoking on a Gentleman's Watch in company what is the Hour > and Minutes; he likewise tells any Lady's Thoughts in company, and > distinguishes all sorts of colours. The show was a great success, and the pig later toured the provincial towns, returning to London later in the year and then moving on to the continent of Europe. After a career of four years a report stated that the pig died in 1788. However, a later report claimed that it had just returned from France following the revolution of 1789, and was ready to \\"discourse on the Feudal System, the Rights of Kings and the Destruction of the Bastille\\". The phenomenon caused much comment. James Boswell recalls conversations with Samuel Johnson in which he joked about the pig's scholarship. Johnson never saw the pig. He died just before it came to London, but he commented on a report of its show in Nottingham. He suggested that \\"the pigs are a race unjustly calumniated. Pig has, it seems, not been wanting to man, but man to pig. We do not allow time for his education, we kill him at a year old.\\" Another man present joked that Alexander Pope would not have used the pig as a symbol of \\"the lowest degree of grovelling instinct\\" in his works if this creature had been known to him, but added that the pig had probably been subject to some form of torture to force it to respond to commands. Johnson replied that at least it had escaped slaughter: \\"the pig has no cause to complain; he would have been killed the first year if he had not been educated, and protracted existence is a good recompence for very considerable degrees of torture.\\"Boswell, Life of Johnson, July 12, 1784. The discussion about how the pig had been trained also led to disputes about the cognitive abilities of pigs; whether the animal actually recognised letters or even words, or whether it was simply responding to direct prompting. The phenomenon was also discussed in instructional literature aimed at children, to describe the essential difference between human and animal capacities and to warn against cruelty to animals, on the assumption that the pigs were badly beaten by their trainers to force them to behave. Mrs Trimmer in her children's book The Robin Redbreasts (1788), \\"designed to teach children the proper treatment of animals\\", mentions the pig in chapter entitled \\"The Cruel Boy\\": aiming to teach that animals are not \\"mere machines, actuated by the unerring hand of Providence\\", it says that the sight of the Learned Pig, \\"which has lately been shown in London, has deranged these ideas, and I know not what think\\". Later pigs Poster for Toby the Sapient Pig In 1798 a learned pig appeared in the United States. William Frederick Pinchbeck displayed a \\"Pig of Knowledge\\" in New England. He claimed to have toured all the major towns of the Union and introduced the pig to President John Adams, to \\"universal applause\\".David Morgan, Sally M. Promey, The visual culture of American religions, University of California Press, 2001, p.212. Pinchbeck later explained his methods of training the pig in a pamphlet.F. W. Pinchbeck, The Expositor, or, Many Mysteries Unravelled. Delineated in a Series of Letters, between a Friend and his Correspondent. Comprising the Learned Pig, Invisible Lady and Acoustic Temple, Philosophical Swan, Penetrating Spy Glasses, Optical and Magnetic, and Various other Curiosities on similar Principles: Also, A few of the most wonderful Feats as performed by the Art of Legerdemain: With Some Reflections on Ventriloquism, Boston, 1805. He denied that any form of torture was involved, insisting that it was better to \\"coax\\" the pig to follow instructions. The animal would soon learn to respond to the slightest hints of movement from the trainer. He stated that credulous spectators accused him of using witchcraft, one stating that \\"his performances were the effects of the Black Art; that the Pig ought to be burnt, and the Man banished, as he had no doubt but...[his trainer] familiarly corresponded with the devil.\\" Others suggested that the pig was evidence of reincarnation: \\"the spirit of the grunting philosopher might once have animated a man.\\" In the early 19th century, Nicholas Hoare, an illusionist, exhibited \\"Toby the sapient pig\\" in London. Toby could \\"discover a person‚Äôs thoughts\\", a skill \\"never heard of before to be exhibited by an animal of the swine race\\". Around 1817 Toby also published an autobiography, The life and adventures of Toby, the sapient pig: with his opinions on men and manners. Written by himself. A pig owned by Pinchbeck was shown in London between 1818 and 1823. According to his publicity, the pig had acquired his wisdom from \\"Souchanguyee, the Chinese Philosopher.\\" He answered questions by \\"pointing to cards, letters, and persons in the audience.\\"R. D. Altick, The Shows of London (1978), p. 37-9. \\"Toby\\" became a standard name for a learned pig. The writer Harrison Weir depicts a learned pig called Toby, which he saw a \\"year ago at Camberwell Fair\\" for a penny. According to Harrison, the pig carried a correctly numbered card to a person who had called out a number; it spelled \\"vittels,\\" and then it left to have some, \\"with a joyful grunt, and the show was over.\\" Caricature The Downfall of Taste and Genius (1784). The classical muses flee while the Learned Pig leads an assault on the arts, as Shakespeare's and Pope's works are cast aside. The original learned pig inspired a large number of satirical comments and comic prints. Thomas Rowlandson published a caricature of \\"The Wonderful Pig\\" in 1785, in which the pig is shown displaying his erudition to a crowd of amazed ladies and gentlemen. A placard states \\"The Surprising PIG well versed in all Languages, perfect Arethmatician Mathematician & Composer of Musick.\\"Mary George, Catalogue of the Political and Personal Satires preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum, Vol. VI 1784‚Äî 1792, British Museum, 1938, pp. xxvi, 197; 259. Other caricatures used the appeal of the pig to poke fun at theatrical fads of the day. The Theatrical War satirises the actor-impresario John Palmer, dressed in Shakespearean costume, being threatened by other attractions including the pig. The 1784 print The Downfall of Taste and Genius, or, The World As it Goes by Samuel Collings ridicules \\"the taste that prefers the Dancing Dogs, the Learned Pig, and Harlequin to Shakespeare\\". This was a \\"recurrent theme\\" of prints at the time. The print depicts the pig leading a procession of performing animals who knock over figures representing the fine arts while copies of Shakespeare's and Pope's works are trampled underfoot by the animals.Paul Keen, \\"The 'Ballonomania': Science and Spectacle in 1780s England\\", Eighteenth-Century Studies, 39/4, 2006, p.527. An anonymous print entitled \\"The Wonderful Pig of Knowledge\\" shows a pig performing in a parlour apparently engaged in spelling the word \\"PORC[INE]\\" Politicians were also satirised by being compared to the pig. William Pitt was referred to as \\"the Wonderful Pig\\" on several occasions. One satirical print showed Pitt with the body of a pig; the caption asserted that among his powers was the ability to explain recent Acts of Parliament, a feat \\"before never having been even attempted in these our realms!!!\\" In one print Pitt and his opponent Charles James Fox were both depicted as competing learned pigs. Literature The concept of the \\"learned pig\\" became a common motif in satirical literature by the late 18th century, playing on the implied contrast between gross physicality and intellectual superiority. The poet William Cowper lamented that his fame had been unfavourably compared to both the pig and a \\"prostitute\\" (the notoriously promiscuous actress Anne Bellamy). A poem published in 1785 referred to the fact that the pig had arrived in London just after Johnson's death, :Though Johnson, learned Bear, is gone, :Let us no longer mourn our loss, :For lo, a learned Hog is come, :And wisdom grunts at Charing Cross. The Story of the Learned Pig by an Officer of the Royal Navy, 1786 The anonymous pamphlet The Story of the Learned Pig, By an officer of the Royal Navy (1786), the author using the pseudonym Transmigratus,https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4849762 picked up the theme of reincarnation. This presents itself as the personal reminiscences of the pig, as told to the author. He describes himself as a soul that has successively migrated from the body of Romulus into various humans and animals before becoming the Learned Pig. He recalls his previous incarnations. After Romulus he became Brutus, and then entered several human and animal bodies. Adapting the Shakespeare theme, the pamphlet states that he became a man called \\"Pimping Billy\\", who worked as a horse-holder at a playhouse with Shakespeare and was the real author of his plays. He then became a famous British aristocrat and general ‚Äî identified only by asterisks ‚Äî before entering the body of a pig.McMichael, George L.; Glenn, Edgar M. (1962), Shakespeare and His Rivals: A Casebook on the Authorship Controversy, Odyssey Press, p.56. Puns on the name \\"Bacon\\", referring to the philosopher Francis Bacon, also appeared in the literature. In the poem \\"The Prophetic Pig\\", in The Whim of the Day (c.1794) a believer in reincarnation states, \\"I can easily trace...A metempsychosis in this pig's face!...And in transmigration, if I'm not mistaken,/This learned pig must be, by consanguinity,/Descended from the great Lord Bacon.\\"Reprinted under the title \\"The Fortune Teller\\" in Thomas Tegg, The Vocal Annual, or Singer's own book for 1831: a collection of the newest and most popular songs of the day, London Tegg, 1831, p.275-7. Thomas Hood's poem The Lament of Toby, The Learned Pig also uses the Bacon pun, adding another on the poet James Hogg. He describes the thoughts of a learned pig forced to retire from his intellectual pursuits to be fattened for slaughter. The pig says \\"Goodbye to the poetic Hogg!/The philosophic Bacon!\\": :In this world, pigs, as well as men, :Must dance to fortune's fiddlings, :But must I give the classics up, :For barley-meal and middlings? William Blake attacked debased public taste in a poem (c. 1808-11) dedicated to the artist James Barry, writing that the nation which neglected Barry might \\"give pensions to the Learned Pig / Or the Hare playing on a Tabor\\".V.A.C. Cattrell, City of laughter: sex and satire in eighteenth-century London, Atlantic, 2006, p.42-3. He also alludes to it in his 1784 satire An Island in the Moon.Peter Ackroyd, Blake, London: Vintage, 1995, pp.92-5 In 1807 Robert Southey parodied the contrast between real genius and meretricious celebrity by referring to the pig, noting that \\"the learned pig was in his day a far greater object of admiration to the English nation than ever was Sir Isaac Newton.\\" William Wordsworth refers to the pig in The Prelude, describing it as one of the \\"freaks of nature\\" to be seen at Bartholomew Fair: :...Albinos, painted Indians, Dwarfs, :The Horse of knowledge, and the learned Pig :All out-o'-the- way, far-fetched, perverted things, :All freaks of nature, all Promethean thoughts :Of man, his dulness, madness, and their feats :All jumbled up together, to compose :A Parliament of Monsters.William Wordsworth, The Prelude, Book VII, lines 715-721 John Leech, 1840s The pig continued to be a common reference point for writers such as Mary Wollstonecraft and Charles Dickens. In the 1837-8 The Mudfog Papers Dickens describes a moving lecture given at the Mudfog Society for the Advancement of Everything by Mr Blunderum on the dying moments of the learned pig. The lecturer was asked whether the learned pig was related to the Pig-faced Lady, causing embarrassment to an audience member who was related to the lady, but who refused to admit a family connection to the learned pig. Mrs Beeton begins her recipe for cooking sucking pig, from her 1861 bestseller Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management, with the observation that pigs are capable of \\"education\\" \\"and though, like the ass, naturally stubborn and obstinate, that he is equally amenable with other animals to caresses and kindness\\". This is proven by \\"the instance of the learned pig, first exhibited about a century since, but which has been continued down to our own time by repeated instances of an animal who will put together all the letters or figures that compose the day, month, hour and date of the exhibition, besides many other unquestioned evidences of memory.\\"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management (Nicola Humble, editor), Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2000 [1861], p. 196. Most recently, the \\"Learned Pig\\" has made a reappearance of sorts in popular culture; in 2003 he was the subject of a song, \\"The Learned Pig,\\" which was part of a concept concert and recording by the UK band the Tiger Lillies, based on a poem by Edward Gorey. The musical \\"Toby the Incredible Learned Pig\\", written by Daniel Freedman, was a finalist in the Wonderland One Act Festival at Theater Works 42nd St. NYC in 2007. In 2011 there appeared a novel, Pyg: The Memoirs of a Learned Pig, by Russell Potter, based on the career of the original \\"Toby\\".

It is located east-northeast of Mica, Washington. It was closed in 1975 by the Air Force, and turned over to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Today the site is part of the Joint Surveillance System (JSS), designated by NORAD as Western Air Defense Sector (WADS) Ground Equipment Facility J-79. History Mica Peak Air Force Station was initially part of Phase II of the Air Defense Command Mobile Radar program. The Air Force approved this expansion of the Mobile Radar program on October 23, 1952. Radars in this network were designated \\"SM.\\" The station was logistically supported by the 9th Air Division at Geiger Field, Spokane, Washington. The station became operational on 1 July 1956 when the 823d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron was assigned to the new station on 1 July 1956. The squadron started operating AN/FPS-20 search and AN/MPS-14 radars, and initially the station functioned as a Ground-Control Intercept (GCI) and warning station. As a GCI station, the squadron's role was to guide interceptor aircraft toward unidentified intruders picked up on the unit's radar scopes. In 1959 Mica Peak AFS received an AN/FPS-6A height-finder radar, and began performing air-traffic-control duties for the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). During 1960 Mica Peak AFS joined the Semi Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system, initially feeding data to DC-15 at Larson AFB, Washington. After joining, the squadron was redesignated as the 823d Radar Squadron (SAGE) on 15 July 1960. The radar squadron provided information 24/7 to the SAGE Direction Center where it was analyzed to determine range, direction altitude speed and whether or not aircraft were friendly or hostile. In June 1963, the SAGE feed was switched to DC-12 at McChord AFB. In 1962 the search radar was upgraded and redesignated as an AN/FPS-67. A year later, an AN/FPS-90 height-finder radar was added. The AN/MPS-14 was later retired. On 31 July 1963, the site was redesignated as NORAD ID Z-141. In addition to the main facility, Mica Peak operated several AN/FPS-14 Gap Filler sites: * Porthill, ID (SM-151C) * Moyie Springs, ID (SM-151D) * Yaak AFS, MT (SM-151E) Over the years, the equipment at the station was upgraded or modified to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the information gathered by the radars. In 1967 the search radar was upgraded to an AN/FPS-67B. Routine operations were performed until 1975 when the 823rd Radar Squadron (SAGE) was inactivated on 1 July. Although the squadron was inactivated and most of the facility was closed, Mica Peak remained in operation manned by various operating locations / detachments of the 25th Air Defense Squadron at McChord AFB. Circa 1977 the AN/FPS-90 was converted to an AN/FPS-116. The 25th ADS shut down operations on 1 October 1979. The FAA assumed control of the station on 1 October 1979, however the Air Force maintained the height-finder radar until 1988 when that radar was retired. Through the mid-1990s, the FAA continued to operate the AN/FPS-67B set at this site. That radar was then replaced by an ARSR-4 in the late 1990s. Mica Peak remains an active Joint Surveillance System (JSS) site today.

While born in Venice, Nicola worked for years in Rome under Carlo Fontana, including as a foreman (Capomaestro) in the reconstruction of the Basilica of Santi Apostoli. Nicola independently submitted a proposal for the Trevi Fountain (1704), however, the winning commission went to Salvi. Nicola performed smaller architectural projects in Rome, including the altar and the architecture of the Sacripante chapel (1712) in Sant'Ignazio. In 1715, he submitted a losing design against competitors like Juvarra, Canevari and others to be able to design a new sacristy of St. Peter's Basilica. That same year, he designed and help build a chapel of the church of Santa Maria in Transpontina and for the Rospigliosi chapel in the church of San Francesco a Ripa (which hosts an altarpiece by Chiari). Between 1718 and 1723, Michetti moved to Russia, and became employed by Tsar Peter the Great as court architect. His main work of these years is the garden and the cascading fountain of the Peterhof Palace near St Petersburg. He made designs for the Kadriorg Palace in Tallinn and the Constantine Palace in Strelna. His plan for a monumental lighthouse on the Black Sea was never executed. Many of his designs from the Russian era are now in the Hermitage Museum . Returning to Rome, Michetti was inducted into the Accademia di San Luca in 1725 and appointed architect of the Apostolic Chamber and of the Theatine Order. During these few years in Rome, he completed other important commissions including the renovation of Palazzo Colonna (1731-1735), as well as much work in ephemeral scenography in the theater.

This exhibition gave credit to the people of Grenoble in general, and the industrialist Aristide Berg√®s in particular, for harnessing the driving force of water rushing down from the mountains.

As he cast his mother's ashes in the sea, he thought of his childhood: his father always blurt out that Min-ki was not his own son whenever he was drunk. Min-ki believed that his father was telling the truth because he had seen his mother tearing up and looking at an old photograph of a man often.

Its name is covered by a protected designation of origin (PDO). It is made from full-fat, unpasteurized cows' milk from specific breeds, namely Asturian Mountain (Asturiana de la Monta√±a, a.k.a. Casina), Asturian Valley (Asturiana de la Valles), Friesian and any crosses between these breeds. Specifically the geographic area of manufacture is the southern part of Asturias which includes the Redes Natural Park (Parque Natural de Redes) and associated land, this is within the municipalities of Caso, Sobrescobio and Pilo√±a. Professional Cheesemakers Organisation - in Spanish The cheese is classified as hard and semi-hard, and can be semi-cured or cured. It takes its name from one of the breeds of cattle whose milk is used, in turn named after the town of Caso. The shape of the cheese is a thick disc-shape, sometime more conical, of 10‚Äì20 cm diameter and 4‚Äì7 cm in height. The weight is between . Spanish Government Regulatory Board - Translation Manufacturing process The milk used must come from suppliers who are registered with the regulating council. The cows must have fed on local, natural foodstuffs. The milk is coagulated by using animal products, fermenting products are also used along with calcium chloride. The milk is heated to a temperature of for the coagulation, this takes about 45 minutes. The curd is then cut with lyres and the temperature is raised by 2 ¬∞C and at the same time the curd is stirred for a minimum of 10 minutes, until it has become coarsely granular, the grains being the size of a hazel nut. It is then left to rest for about 10 minutes. Next the broken curd is put into sacking bags or plastic containers with fine holes to allow the whey to drain. The cheese is then placed in ventilated rooms at for 3 or more days during which they are turned over daily. The cheese is then moulded into its characteristic shape either manually or mechanically. At this time a little salt is added. It is then stored in ventilated rooms for a period of between 5 days to 2 weeks, each piece being turned over daily. Finally the cheeses are given another pressing to give them an aesthetic appearance and the decoration and the mark of the manufacturer is added on the rind. They are left a further 2 more days in the ventilating room. The final maturation takes place in a room between and a humidity of 80%. A period of 2 months is necessary between the coagulation of the milk and final maturity. The cheese is wrapped before sale to protect the surface of the cheese as it is intended that all the cheese will be eaten. It can be wrapped in paper, cardboard, wood or culinary grade plastic. Properties Cas√≠n cheese has a strong dairy flavour. It is slightly acid and peppery in well matured cheese, and less so in less matured cheese. The flavour is long-lasting in the mouth. Texture Its texture is firm and friable but slightly rubbery and homogeneous. It should have no cavities within the cheese but may have tiny cracks running through the body of the cheese. Rind Cas√≠n cheese has a smooth, thin rind. It is a yellowy, cream colour, sometimes with whitish patches. It should be clean and dry but slightly greasy. On the surface will be decorations in the form of flowers, plants or geometric figures and the symbol or name of the manufacturer.

It marks the northern entrance to Moreton Bay and Brisbane and also serves as the rear light for the North Point Range. With its two distinctive red bands, it also serves as a daymark. It is the oldest lighthouse in Queensland, and the only one to be built by the New South Wales Government before the separation of Queensland, which took place in 1859. It is also the only lighthouse in Queensland to be built of stone. The lighthouse was established following an increase in traffic through the northern entrance to Moreton Bay in the 1840s. It was designed by Edmund Blacket in 1854 and established in 1857. Over the years the light source went through several changes, from oil wick, to kerosene, to acetylene gas, to electricity, and finally to solar power. The structures also went through various modifications, the major one being an increase in the lighthouse height and rebuilding of several structures, in 1928‚Äì1930. The station includes the lighthouse, three lighthouse keeper residences, and various buildings. The lighthouse is made of sandstone and topped by a concrete gallery and a cast iron lantern. The residences and most other structures are timber framed and fibro clad.  Establishment  In 1825, Brisbane was established as a penal settlement. In spite of the hazards, the preferred access to Moreton Bay and Brisbane was through the southern entrance, between Moreton Island and North Stradbroke Island, mainly due to shorter shipping route and better shipping conditions. The southern entrance was therefore marked in 1825 and a pilot station was established at Amity Point on North Stradbroke Island in 1827. Although the northern entrance was considered in the 1830s, it was only with the increased shipping activity due to the proclamation of Moreton Bay as a free settlement in 1842 that vessels began to use the northern entrance. Buoys marking the entrance were laid in 1846‚Äì1847, and in 1848 the Pilot Station was moved to Bulwer on Moreton Island. By then the northern entry was regarded as the main entry. Lighthouse in 1917, note the original sandstone keeper cottage (replaced in 1928‚Äì1930) on the left and the lack of bands which were added in 1942 In 1850, Brisbane residents petitioned the New South Wales Government, which controlled the Queensland area until Queensland's separation in 1859, to establish a lighthouse on Cape Moreton. The government also wanted to encourage ships to use the broader and safer northern passage. Planning for the structure, therefore, commenced in 1852. The site was selected and surveyed in 1853, and the lighthouse was designed in 1854 by Edmund Blacket the New South Wales Colonial Architect of the time. However, Blacket resigned on 10 June 1854, for the private market, and left the office on 25 August. The office remained vacant until 1 October 1854, when Blacket was succeeded by William Weaver. Drawings for the tower which were completed in September 1854 were signed by Alexander Beazeley, Foreman of Works in the Colonial Architect's office. The tower was finally built during the office of Alexander Dawson who succeeded Weaver in 1856, and signed further drawings made in April 1856. The tower was constructed by a contractor, Mark Farrell, for the cost of , using prison labor, and supervised by Beazeley. Both the lighthouse and three sandstone lighthouse keeper cottages were constructed from locally quarried sandstone. The lighthouse was first displayed in February 1857, though tenders for painting the tower were called for only in December 1858. The original optical apparatus was a catoptric system consisting of 21 oil wick lamps with parabolic reflectors. The lighthouse was , visible for . = Development = In 1859, control of the lightstation passed to the Government of Queensland, but it continued to be managed by the New South Wales Marine Board until the formation of the Queensland Department of Ports and Harbours in 1862. In 1864 a telegraph office was opened at the Cape. In 1873, the oil wick lamps were replaced with kerosene. During the 1860s and 1870s some further structures were constructed in the station including a schoolhouse (opened in 1879), a stable, and other storage buildings. A telegraph line was constructed during the 1890s, and a Morse lamp visible for was installed in the 1910s. In 1913 the timber parts of the structures, which were damaged by ants, were replaced. A 1911‚Äì1913 survey found the light in good shape, though the apparatus was found out of date and needing replacement. This replacement was to be delayed for a long time due to the transfer of all coastal lights to the Commonwealth, occurring officially October 1913, though practically in July 1915. A post office was operated by the light keepers between 1915 and the early 1920s. In 1928, the tower was extended and the lighthouse reached its current height of to increase its range. In 1928‚Äì1930, the keepers' cottages were replaced with timber framed fibro clad structures. puts this in 1928. puts this in 1930. In 1930, the lantern underwent major modification.

The light source was replaced by an AGA incandescent gas mantle operated by acetylene gas, and a sun valve was also installed. Lighthouse and surrounding buildings, 1951 = Electricity = In 1937, the light was converted to 110 V DC electricity. The two distinctive red bands were painted in 1942. In 1967 the power source was replaced with 240 V AC power, being supplied by two diesel alternators, and a new lens, pedestal, bearing and optic drive may have been installed. The range of the 1967 light was . The light was modernised in July 1988, with the installation of a 120 V 1 Kw tungsten halogen lamp. In 1990, the handrails and stanchions of the balcony and external staircase were replaced and an access ladder to the dome was installed. On 8 December 1993, the light was converted to solar powered operation and a VRB-25 apparatus was installed.

The red light, shown at 192¬∞-244¬∞ and 258¬∞-294¬∞, is visible for .List of Lights  Structures  The structures of the station are built in three levels. On the highest level is the lighthouse, surrounded by the workshop, former powerhouse and fuel store, the head keeper cottage to the north and an office further north. On the second level is the first assistant keeper residence and two sheds, a garage and a powerhouse. On the bottom level is the second assistant keeper residence, some distance to the south, and a fuel store to the north. = Lighthouse = The 1854 drawings of the lighthouse The circular tower, high from the ground to the lantern, is made of sandstone blocks laid in regular courses. The ground level has thicker walls, topped by a timber floor. The tower shaft tapers slightly toward the top, where the cast iron lantern sits. Entrance to the tower is either through a timber door on the ground level, or through a timber door on the top of the original 1857 external masonry staircase (with a modern 1990 handrail) that circles the first floor, leading to the first floor. Two horizontal bands are painted close to the top, and the tower is otherwise unpainted, showing the sandstone colour. Both the ground floor and the lantern floor are made of concrete. Access from the ground floor to the lantern is first via a ladder leading to a trapdoor in the first floor, then via the original internal cast iron spiral stair, ending in a landing below the lantern, and finally, another short ladder leading to a trapdoor in the lantern floor. The internal is painted, and lit by small square glass panels in timber frames. The tower is topped by the 1930 diameter Chance Brothers lantern, painted white. The lantern cylindrical wall is made of six bolted cast iron panels. These support a continuous band of curved glass with cast iron glazing bars, and a small catwalk between the wall and the glazing. The cupola on top of the lantern is made of sheet copper, painted red, and it is topped by ball vent and a wind vane. An access ladder and safety rails, installed in 1990, provide access to the cupola. In the center of the lantern is the VRB-25 apparatus, mounted on steel box. Surrounding the lantern is a concrete gallery, accessible through a door in the lantern wall, with a white painted balustrade, and a 1990 railing. The solar panels are mounted on the gallery. = Other structures = Aerial view of the station showing all structures except the second assistant residence which is to the south (left) The three keepers' cottages were constructed in 1928‚Äì1930. The head keeper's house is located close to the lighthouse, and on the tallest ground, and also includes a small fenced garden. The assistant keeper residence is located right to the west, but geographically lower. The second assistant residence is located at some distance from the main cluster of buildings, to the south, and even lower. The residences are square one storey structures, timber-framed and fibro clad, with central rooms, no corridors, enclosed verandahs and hipped roofs. The head keeper's house and the second assistant's house have corrugated fibrous cement rood while the first assistant house has a newer corrugated zinc/aluminium alloy (Zincalume) metal roof. A museum was set in the second assistant's quarters in 1988. Two spherical steel rainwater tanks are set next to each of the houses. The three sheds surrounding the lighthouse are the workshop to the south, the former powerhouse to the west and the fuel store to the north. They are all rectangular structures, timber-framed and fibro clad with corrugated fibrous cement gable roofs. The workshop appears to be built on the remains of one of the early stone buildings, lying on a plinth with sandstone steps. It consists of two rooms with pivoting sash windows and timber framed doors and no internal lining. The former powerhouse and the fuel store have reinforced concrete floors, fibro lining, double-hung sash windows and double timber framed doors. The office to the north of the head keeper house is a small square room raised on short concrete pillars, constructed of timber-framed fibro clad walls and corrugated fibrous cement roof. It has a continuous band of windows. The last three buildings, the garage, powerhouse and fuel store, are small brick buildings with metal roofs and reinforced concrete floors.  Site operation and visiting  The site and the light are operated by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. The island can be reached by ferry service from Scarborough, though visiting requires a permit and a four-wheel drive is mandatory. The station is accessible, but the lighthouse is closed to the public. Heritage listing The lighthouse was added to the Queensland Heritage Register in 2004.
